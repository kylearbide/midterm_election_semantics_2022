No. 128 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 21, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable NIKEMA 
WILLIAMS to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
SLAVERY REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. I rise as a person 
who is proud to live in a country where 
we celebrate the ideal of liberty and 
justice for all; government of the peo-
ple, by the people, for the people. 
I rise today with grateful thoughts 
on my mind and in my heart. I rise 
with gratitude. I am thankful to those 
persons, the many, who have signed on 
to H. Res. 517. 
H. Res. 517, Madam Speaker, is a res-
olution that would allow us to remem-
ber 
slavery, 
Slavery 
Remembrance 
Day. 
Slavery Remembrance Day would be 
a day that we would set aside, not for 
celebration, but for commemoration, 
for memorialization, to remember the 
atrocities that were imposed upon peo-
ple, human beings, how they were made 
chattel. Slavery Remembrance Day. 
And for those who may not be aware, 
we have a 9/11 Remembrance Day. We 
have a Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
Day. We have a Holocaust Remem-
brance Day. But we don’t have a Slav-
ery Remembrance Day. 
Hence, on August 20 of this year, we 
will commemorate the first Slavery 
Remembrance Day, because it was on 
that day in 1619 that the White Lion 
landed in this country with some 20 
persons who were held in captivity as 
slaves. Slavery Remembrance Day. 
So I am rising today to thank the 
many persons who have already signed 
on to the resolution. And I want you to 
know that we will be sending you 
something 
very 
special, 
something 
comparable to this. It will have the 
resolution cited on one side of the 
page. Each of your names will be high-
lighted on the other side of the page. 
And each of you will have a special 
place for your name that will be high-
lighted. 
This is historic, and we have to treat 
it as such. This is something that those 
who will look back on this time 
through the vista of time, they will 
look, and they will conclude that we 
did not forget, that we made it a point 
to remember that those who, unfortu-
nately, don’t learn the lessons of his-
tory sometimes repeat history. 
We never want to repeat slavery. 
Hence, we will have a Slavery Remem-
brance Day resolution. 
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS ALIVE 
AND WELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 2 
miles down the road from this very 
Chamber, in 1963, Martin Luther King, 
Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln 
Memorial and proclaimed his vision for 
the future: 
‘‘I have a dream that my four little 
children will one day live in a Nation 
where they will not be judged by the 
color of their skin, but by the content 
of their character.’’ 
Nearly 60 years later, radical far-left 
Democrats are doing everything pos-
sible to eliminate this dream through 
the implementation of critical race 
theory. 
Instead of equality, critical race the-
ory frames race, not character, as the 
focal point of the human construct, im-
plying that one’s racial identity de-
fines who they are and who they will 
ever be. 
To these CRT believers, your fate has 
already been decided by your skin 
color. 
To the average American living out-
side the swamp bubble, this idea is lu-
dicrous. 
Everyday Americans have seen indi-
viduals of all races and backgrounds 
succeed. They know hard work and 
character are the biggest determinants 
of success, and the American Dream is 
alive and well for everyone. 
But critical race theory wants to poi-
son our classrooms by pushing an agen-
da which revolves around race, not 
character. They want to teach young 
minds that racism persists even if no 
individual or institution acts in a rac-
ist way or holds any racist beliefs. 
This toxic teaching squashes hope, 
stifles growth, and fuels anger and de-
spair.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3760 
July 21, 2021 
What began as a theory for civil 
rights lawyers to debate has trans-
formed into harmful messages that ul-
timately seek to further divide our Na-
tion. 
CRT and The 1619 Project have no 
place in our schools, our workplaces, or 
our military. 
Our Nation’s founding principles of 
equality and freedom are worth fight-
ing for and protecting. While our Na-
tion isn’t perfect, we always strive for 
that more perfect Union. We have made 
progress in the last 100 years and are 
still the greatest Nation in the world. 
This progress would be lost should we 
allow the divisive, racist rhetoric of 
critical race theory into our class-
rooms. 
As a mother and a former teacher, I 
believe our education system is at its 
best when we inspire our young people 
to be all they can be and share with 
them 
the 
principles 
showcased 
in 
America’s 
traditional 
motto, 
‘‘e 
pluribus unum,’’ which means, out of 
many, one. That is the unique great-
ness of our country, the idea of being a 
melting pot of people from different 
countries, races, and backgrounds, but 
we become one as Americans. 
Our schools should never stifle the 
growth of our children, belittle them 
based on the color of their skin, or 
teach them that they themselves or 
their families are racist regardless of 
their individual beliefs. 
The American Dream is alive and 
well and should be fanned into flames, 
not crushed by critical race theory’s 
restrictive 
and 
damaging 
rhetoric. 
That is the last thing our children 
need. 
Since critical race theory has entered 
the national discussion, Missourians 
and parents across the country have 
expressed strong disdain for teaching 
our students that this country is inher-
ently racist and that minority groups 
are unable to succeed within our coun-
try’s current systems and institutions. 
Today, I stand by those parents. I 
cannot condone an education system 
that teaches students to be ashamed of 
our country and to judge each other 
based on the color of our skin. And I 
believe neither would Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Our kids deserve better. 
f 
PAYMENT PAUSE FOR STUDENT 
LOANS SHOULD BE EXTENDED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, 
last January, in one of his first execu-
tive orders, President Biden extended 
the student loan pause on monthly 
payments through the end of Sep-
tember. 
This order allowed all direct student 
loans issued by the Federal Govern-
ment through the U.S. Department of 
Education, again, to have a grace pe-
riod during the recession that we are 
still experiencing. Even with a good job 
growth last month, 800,000 jobs added 
to the economy, a 5.6 percent unem-
ployment 
rate, 
and 
having 
people 
starting to again recover, the need for 
that pause was blindingly obvious. 
A couple weeks ago, myself and Con-
gresswoman AYANNA PRESSLEY wrote 
to President Biden and the Secretary 
of Education calling on the President 
to extend that pause again. We are 
about 60 days away from all these stu-
dent loans snapping back with very 
high interest rates, and again, at a 
time when the economy is still recov-
ering. 
Madam Speaker, this is exactly what 
the Small Business Administration did 
for disaster loans issued during COVID 
when they extended the grace period 
allowed of 1 year, when those loans 
were issued during COVID, to have that 
grace period extended into 2022. That 
was a smart, wise move recognizing 
that this is the wrong time to add debt 
burden on individuals and businesses as 
the U.S. economy starts to recover. 
Again, we understand that at some 
point we are going to have to have a re-
turn to student loan debt payments, 
but, again, there are additional reasons 
why this pause makes sense. 
Two of the largest debt servicers, the 
Pennsylvania Higher Education Assist-
ance Agency, which services a large 
number of student loan debts, an-
nounced a couple of weeks ago they are 
withdrawing from the program, which 
means that borrowers are going to be 
shifted to new servicers, as well as the 
New Hampshire Higher Education Loan 
Corporation. 
So again, the dislocation and the 
change that is happening with student 
loan servicers are additional reasons 
why 
the 
President 
and 
Secretary 
Cardona should agree to our request. 
Moving forward, it is time for Con-
gress to act to fix some of the problems 
within the student loan space. 
Congressman DUSTY JOHNSON and I, 
on a bipartisan basis, back in January, 
introduced the Recognizing Military 
Service in the Public Service Loan 
Forgiveness Act. A companion bill in 
the Senate was introduced by Senator 
RUBIO and Senator HASSAN. 
Again, the Public Service Loan For-
giveness Program was created back in 
2007 basically to allow teachers, nurses, 
people serving in the military, cops— 
who will, again, make 10 years of pay-
ments on their student loans while 
holding down public service jobs—to be 
eligible for discharge of their student 
loan debt. 
The last administration butchered 
this program. People who, again, for 10 
years abided by the rules were refused 
and denied student loan discharge, in-
cluding people serving in the military. 
Our bill will untangle that bottle-
neck, will recognize that people who 
are on Active Duty overseas, away 
from their families, who again, were al-
lowed a grace period in terms of 
monthly payments, those months will 
be credited towards public service loan 
forgiveness. It has been endorsed by 
every 
veteran 
service 
organization 
from VFW to the Iraq and Afghan War 
Veterans, and again, is a smart bipar-
tisan bill which will help a population 
of people who perform the highest form 
of public service; namely, wearing the 
uniform of this country. 
We should also, as Congress, change 
the law to allow people to refinance 
down the interest rate on their student 
loan debt. When these loans snap back, 
we are looking at 6 percent, 7 percent, 
8 percent interest on legacy student 
loan debt. 
The rest of the economy with a zero 
percent benchmark at the Federal Re-
serve is refinancing debt on homes, on 
consumer loans, on auto debt, but stu-
dent loan borrowers are trapped unless 
Congress acts. 
H.R. 3024 allows the Department of 
Education to refinance down the inter-
est rates on student loan debt so that 
people, again, in a very low-interest 
rate environment—and the chairman of 
the Federal Reserve announced the 
other day he is going to keep the 
benchmark at zero through 2021. Stu-
dent loan borrowers should get the ben-
efit of those low interest rates just like 
every other middle class family that 
refinances their home or their con-
sumer debt. 
So, extend the pause. Let’s fix the 
problems in the meantime. Congress 
can act. 
The millennials, the young people of 
this country deserve our help, both to 
act with the tools that we have, and 
also, calling on the administration to 
provide an additional grace period just 
like we did for small businesses.

HONORING DOUG WRIGHT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a law enforce-
ment officer from Summerville, South 
Carolina, who spent his career ensuring 
the safety of South Carolina residents 
and our neighborhoods. 
Doug Wright began his career in 1997 
by joining the Summerville Police De-
partment. He has since dedicated over 
20 years of his career to protecting our 
community, and I can think of no bet-
ter thing to do today than to recognize 
the good work that our law enforce-
ment does every single day in our com-
munities and keeping us safe. 
Through his career, Doug has worked 
diligently as a patrol team watch com-
mander, uniform patrol division com-
mander, and supervisor of the K–9 unit. 
And I would be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion Doug’s 6 years as a Marine reserv-
ist. 
In April, Chief Wright was promoted 
to chief of police for Summerville after 
serving as deputy. The vote by town 
council members was unanimous. This 
is a glowing endorsement of the work 
that Doug has done in his career for 
Summerville over the last 20 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3761 
July 21, 2021 
Most recently, last week I was hon-
ored to award Chief Wright with a com-
mendation from Congress for his work, 
and I was also able to watch and wit-
ness some of the less-than-lethal work 
that the Summerville Police Depart-
ment is doing with the BolaWrap dur-
ing that time. 
Chief Wright exemplifies service in 
the Lowcountry in South Carolina’s 
First Congressional District. 
A NOTABLE RESCUE 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and highlight a no-
table rescue that took place off the 
coast of South Carolina’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Many of us in the Lowcountry took 
for granted tropical storm Elsa when it 
hit our shores. 
On July 7, as Elsa was beginning to 
strengthen at the beginning of this sea-
son’s hurricane season, a family of six 
was visiting the Lowcountry from West 
Virginia. They were caught in 6-foot 
waves north of St. Helena. 
That afternoon, the family had sailed 
their 21-foot Carolina skiff to tiny 
Otter Island from Edisto Beach. 
As the weather worsened and the 
wind picked up, the boat drifted off the 
island into stormy waters. 
Unfortunately, there was no SOS sys-
tem available to the family, and the fa-
ther actually decided to jump in the 
water and swim out for help after spot-
ting a shrimp boat. The emergency was 
radioed in, and Skipper Clay Emminger 
of Beaufort Water Search and Rescue 
answered the call of duty. 
Ultimately, the Coast Guard was able 
to reach the family, despite deterio-
rating visibility, and a woman and four 
female children were hoisted to safety 
in a Dolphin helicopter. 
I am pleased this family was rescued, 
and I wish to extend my sincerest 
thanks to the U.S. Coast Guard, the 
Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office Ma-
rine Unit, and South Carolina’s Depart-
ment of Natural Resource. 
b 1015 
RECOGNIZING GREGG RUSSELL 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the efforts and tal-
ents of Hilton Head’s very own folk 
musician and, indeed, a South Carolina 
legend by the name of Gregg Russell. 
For 40 years, Gregg has highlighted 
and delighted families around the Old 
Liberty Tree at Harbor Town in Hilton 
Head Island. 
While these days Gregg is singing 
songs for families and children, he 
shared the stage with many celebrities 
over the years. He even wrote the hit 
song, ‘‘Come Away Home’’ about Hil-
ton Head Island, which inspired the 
movie of the same name. 
His performances are renowned to 
locals and tourists alike who visit Hil-
ton Head Island, and he has received a 
nomination for an Angel Award and 
won Best Children’s Live Action Video 
in 2000. 
Gregg doesn’t just contribute with 
his music to our community, through 
his charity, Hilton Head Heroes, Gregg 
and his wife, Wendy, provide needy and 
sick children every year with a vaca-
tion to Hilton Head Island as well. 
On Gregg’s 40th year anniversary— 
and it actually might be a few more 
than that—I am happy to draw atten-
tion to his career here on the House 
floor and thank him for everything he 
has done for the Hilton Head Island 
community. 
f 
PFAS ACTION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the PFAS Action 
Act, a bill that I am proud to cosponsor 
and that will address a critically im-
portant issue in my district and across 
the country, PFAS contamination. 
This bill will take bold action to ad-
dress PFAS contamination and it con-
tains a number of provisions in par-
ticular that will affect our smallest 
communities; and I want to share those 
today. 
From the very early days when I be-
came a Member of Congress, one of the 
issues that my residents were talking 
about more than anything else was the 
need to access clean water. In par-
ticular, Michiganders are concerned 
about increasing levels of PFAS and 
other toxic chemicals that we are con-
tinuing to find in our drinking water. 
In Michigan, water is our identity. 
We are the home of the Great Lakes, 
and protecting our water and our 
waters is one of the most bipartisan 
issues you will find in the State of 
Michigan. 
I have always believed that environ-
mental security is homeland security, 
because it is about the safety and secu-
rity of our kids and the preservation of 
our way of life in Michigan. 
If you can’t take your grandchildren 
fishing in the lakes you grew up on, or 
can’t safely hand your child a glass of 
water without knowing they might get 
a learning disability, that is a threat 
to your family. 
We have kicked the can down the 
road long enough when it comes to fi-
nally addressing the PFAS issue, and I 
am happy to stand here today to fight 
for a bill that will make a real dif-
ference in people’s lives when it comes 
to clean water. 
Today, the House is going to vote on 
several amendments that I drafted and 
introduced and come directly from on- 
the-ground conversations I have had 
with residents in my district. Here is a 
story for you: 
In Michigan, roughly 25 percent of 
our households get our water from pri-
vate wells, including myself and my 
family farm. And even though there is 
a great deal of public reporting on 
PFAS contamination in our public 
water sources, those of us who have 
private wells do not have a ton of ac-
cess to best practices, information, 
how we test. 
So back in 2020, I went on a wells and 
waterways tour in my district and 
hosted an evening in Davisburg, in 
Oakland County, right before COVID 
came to us to talk directly with people 
who have private wells about how we 
can make sure that our water is pro-
tected, clean, safe, and tested. 
The response was overwhelming. We 
had 150 people on a weekday to talk 
about how we protect those of us on 
private wells. Most people do not have 
the resources, information, or tools 
they need to get their private wells 
tested. 
These questions led to a bill that I 
am proud to cosponsor called the Test 
Your Well Water Act, which ended up 
being included in the PFAS Action 
Act. It requires the EPA to set up a 
website with information for residents 
on private wells, including how to get 
your water tested, treatment options, 
and financial assistance to help home-
owners afford the necessary treatment. 
I also wrote an amendment to the 
PFAS Action Act to ensure that this 
website 
also 
contains 
information 
about the health risks associated with 
PFAS. My goal was to create a re-
source that would be able to answer 
the questions I received from my con-
stituents a little over a year ago in 
Davisburg. 
The fight to protect safe drinking 
water for all Michiganders actually 
starts usually with local advocacy 
from people in our districts who are di-
rectly impacted by that PFAS con-
tamination. This includes people like 
Stacy Taylor. 
Stacy is a resident of my town of 
Holly, Michigan, and she gets her 
water directly from a well on her prop-
erty. When she and her husband started 
experiencing serious health effects, she 
suspected there may be PFAS in her 
water supply. 
Stacy conducted intense research on 
her well and Holly’s history, digging 
through old documents, deeds, and 
maps to figure out where the problem 
may lie. When she presented her find-
ings to our office—and she was diligent 
about coming to find me everywhere I 
was in the district—we reached out to 
the State agency that is responsible for 
testing our water sources in Michigan, 
and it turns out Stacy was right. There 
was PFAS in her water supply—in our 
water supply. 
But discovering the contamination 
isn’t the end of the story. We have to 
make sure that our towns and cities 
can clean up these chemicals and pro-
vide their residents with clean water, 
even our smallest communities. 
Because of Stacy’s dogged advocacy 
and countless other local folks across 
my district, one of my amendments to 
the PFAS Action Act will beef up as-
sistance to local and community gov-
ernments that would otherwise really 
struggle to pay for PFAS cleanup. The 
cost can often be prohibitive. 
The stories my constituents have 
shared have helped shape this bill to be 
more effective and impactful. In the

have to be able to lead healthy lives,

my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to do the same.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF BILLY 
BARKER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a very distinguished 
American and longtime public servant 
of the people of Southeastern North 
Carolina as well as the United States 
Congress. 
Billy Barker has served this institu-
tion for 24 years, 18 years for former 
Congressman Mike McIntyre and 6 
years with me as agriculture field di-
rector. 
He also served a number of years for 
North Carolina’s longtime Commis-
sioner of Agriculture, the late Jim Gra-
ham. Following more than three dec-
ades of serving the citizens of North 
Carolina, Billy recently retired from 
his work in public service. 
Billy was one of my first hires after 
I was elected to Congress in 2014. He is 
a great friend who has been an incred-
ibly valuable source of information for 
me and many others. The contributions 
he has made to the agriculture commu-
nity and our farm families cannot be 
measured. Sometimes it was help on a 
pressing issue with USDA; other times, 
it was just a friendly visit to talk local 
scuttlebutt and take a break from the 
stresses on the farm. 
It is no exaggeration to say that 
North 
Carolina’s 
farm 
economy 
wouldn’t look the same without Billy’s 
hard work and influence. Through nu-
merous hurricanes and other storms, 
the COVID–19 pandemic, and every 
other challenge, Billy Barker has been 
a constant presence on the ground, pro-
viding our farm families and rural 
communities a steady hand to guide 
them through recovery and ensuring 
they have the resources they need. 
Without question, the citizens of 
North Carolina are better off for his 
service. I wish him a well-deserved re-
tirement and a relaxing and rewarding 
next chapter of life. I am grateful for 
his service to the State, and I am proud 
to call him my friend. 
TRIBUTE TO BOB SUTTER, CEO OF NORTH 
CAROLINA PEANUT GROWERS ASSOCIATION 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my longtime 
friend, Bob Sutter, who will be retiring 
after serving 28 years as the CEO of the 
North Carolina Peanut Growers Asso-
ciation. 
Prior to his lifelong career in agri-
culture, 
Bob 
honorably served his 
country for 2 years in the U.S. Navy 
and 5 years in the U.S. Navy Reserve. 
From there, he worked for the USDA 
Farm Service Agency, and then later 
took the helm of the North Carolina 
Peanut Growers Association as its CEO 
in 1993. 
Bob has made countless contribu-
tions to the North Carolina agriculture 
community, everything from the for-
mation of the National Peanut Board, 
educating the public on health benefits 
of peanuts, and advocating for research 
to improve yields. He leaves behind a 
successful legacy of helping peanut 
farmers and their families establish 
and maintain successful farms that 
support our Nation’s abundant food 
supply. 
Bob has also been a leading voice for 
North 
Carolina 
producers 
when 
it 
comes to developing strong national 
farm policy. His advocacy in the halls 
of Congress and the executive branch of 
the Federal Government, as well as the 
State legislature and beyond, has been 
critical to the development and imple-
mentation of policies that have helped 
many of our farmers survive major 
challenges and succeed—whether they 
were caused by the weather, trade dis-
tortions, or the market. 
Bob has had a remarkable career, and 
on behalf of the agriculture community 
and the fine citizens of North Carolina, 
I thank him for his dedicated service to 
the State and to the many farm fami-
lies he has represented all these years. 
I wish him and his wife, Sylvia, the 
best as they move into their next chap-
ter of life. 
HYDE AMENDMENT 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the long-
standing Hyde amendment. For nearly 
45 years, the Hyde amendment has re-
ceived support from Republicans and 
Democrats alike. Lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle understood that no 
taxpayer money should be used to fund 
abortion. Every President since Jimmy 
Carter has signed the Hyde amendment 
into law, including President Obama. 
As a Senator, President Biden was a 
strong supporter of the amendment. 
Yet, in his latest budget proposal, he 
removed Hyde protections that would 
enable taxpayer funding support for 
abortions, meaning that tax dollars 
taken from those who oppose it will 
now be used for just that. Regardless of 
where one stands on the issue, it is fun-
damentally wrong to take taxpayer 
dollars of someone who is opposed to 
abortion and use their hard-earned tax 
dollars to fund the same. 
On the question of life itself, the 
Hyde amendment is credited with sav-
ing more than 2.4 million innocent 
lives from abortions since 1976. It is our 
moral obligation to fight for and pro-
tect the lives of those who cannot 
speak for themselves, the lives of those 
who are no different than our own. 
I call on my colleagues to pass H.R. 
18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act, to stand up for pro-life Amer-
icans, preserve the Hyde amendment, 
and ensure taxpayer dollars are not 
used to fund abortion. 
PANDEMIC OF THE UNVACCINATED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I have 
two unrelated topics that really got me 
going this morning. 
The first is vaccinations. Over 40 per-
cent of Americans are still not vac-
cinated. I mean, come on, what is going 
on? We need to wake up, America. We 
need to get vaccinated. 
People are saying, ‘‘I want to live 
free or die.’’ Well, people are living free 
and other people are dying. We need to 
get everyone vaccinated. Cases are ris-
ing every day. It is becoming a pan-
demic of the unvaccinated. 
Madam Speaker, 97 percent of hos-
pitalizations are unvaccinated; 99 per-
cent 
of 
the 
COVID 
deaths 
are 
unvaccinated. We need to wake up. 
There are people using social media 
poisoning the American people’s minds 
and jeopardizing their health in the 
process. We need to work together to 
convince people that vaccinations are 
safe and that it makes sense to get vac-
cinated. 
I want to applaud STEVE SCALISE and 
MITCH
MCCONNELL
for getting vac-
cinated and promoting it to the Amer-
ican people. We need everyone in this 
body to please do the same. You need 
to get vaccinated, not only for your-
self, not only for your family, do it for 
other families, do it for the country, do 
it so the economy can stay strong. 
Please, get vaccinated. 
DACA PROGRAM 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, the 
second topic I would bring up is the 
Dreamers; the DACA program. 
So many families are living every 
day with so much stress and anxiety 
because of their immigration status. 
Last week, a Federal judge ruled that 
DACA must end, causing more anxiety 
and stress for these families. Congress 
should fix this. Give a pathway to le-
galization and citizenship, for Dream-
ers, for TPS recipients, and for the 
farm workers and other essential work-
ers that make our country work. This 
is personal for me. 
Madam Speaker, 100 years ago, Au-
gust 22 of 1921, my father was born in a 
small medieval village on the moun-
tains of Southern Italy. He immigrated 
to the United States as a young boy. 
He was the first kid from the neighbor-
hood to go to college. He fought in 
World War II as a navigator on a B–24 
and 
got 
the 
Distinguished 
Flying 
Cross. He came home and went to Har-
vard Law School on the GI Bill. 
b 1030 
My father would always say, ‘‘What a 
country.’’ He went on to live a great 
American success story. So, like I said, 
this is personal for me. 
Twenty-seven years ago, I served as 
the young mayor of my hometown, the 
city of Glen Cove, New York. I ad-
dressed the growing issue of new immi-
grants from Central and South Amer-
ica who were gathering on street cor-
ners looking for work by creating the

first day-workers site anywhere on the 
East Coast of the United States of 
America in 1994. 
I relied on a fundamental American 
principle: All men and women are cre-
ated equal. It is not that all men and 
women with a passport are created 
equal, or all men and women with a 
green card are created equal. Every 
human being should be treated with 
human respect and dignity, and we 
have failed to address this problem for 
30 years. 
Those same men who gathered on the 
street corners 27 years ago now have 
their own businesses, own their own 
homes, and their children went to 
school with my children. 
One Dreamer graduated high school 
with my daughter, went on to graduate 
from college with a degree in bio-
medical engineering, got a master’s de-
gree in biomedical engineering, and is 
now pursuing a doctorate in the same 
subject. But, now, he is suffering every 
day, worrying about his immigration 
status, worried about how this court 
ruling will affect him and his family. 
Dreamers 
have 
been 
shaken 
yet 
again. Let’s fix this. Let’s do it. 
Dreamers are ready to live the same 
American success story that my father 
lived. 
Let’s give Dreamers, TPS recipients, 
farmworkers, and other essential work-
ers a path to citizenship, and let’s do it 
now. 
f 
STANDING WITH PEOPLE OF CUBA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. STEEL) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Cuban people 
and in opposition to communism. 
In the last week, we have seen thou-
sands of people in Cuba rise up in pro-
test against the decades-long com-
munist regime that has oppressed mil-
lions. 
Since these protests began, more 
than 100 people have been detained by 
the communist government or have 
been reported missing. In response to 
these protests, the government has 
shut down communications, turning off 
internet service to their own people. 
When I see what is happening in 
Cuba, I am reminded again why Amer-
ica is the greatest country on Earth. In 
our country, a first-generation Korean 
American 
can 
build 
an 
American 
Dream here and become a Congress-
woman. In our country, we respect and 
value our freedom of speech and expres-
sion. 
My parents fled North Korea and the 
country’s communist rule. My family 
knows what it was like to have to wait 
in line for basic necessities. That is not 
how people deserve to live, and that is 
how the people of Cuba are forced to 
live every day under communist rule. 
We should stand with the people of 
Cuba. I stand with those fighting for 
freedom, justice, and democracy. 
ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the crisis on our 
southern border. As an immigrant to 
this country, I strongly support legal 
immigration and a system that is 
grounded in the rule of law. 
The United States is a nation of im-
migrants. They add to the rich fabric 
of our country. However, we are also a 
nation of laws. The crisis on our south-
ern border is not law and order. 
As a Representative from California, 
a border State, I often hear from my 
constituents about their concerns with 
the chaos at our border created by the 
Biden administration’s policies. The 
security of our borders and enforce-
ment of our immigration laws are vital 
to the safety and security of our Na-
tion. 
We must contain this crisis and make 
it clear to the people that to come to 
America, you must do it legally. 
f 
REIMBURSE NATIONAL GUARD IM-
MEDIATELY FOR CAPITOL RE-
SPONSE MISSION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, ‘‘Al-
ways Ready, Always There.’’ That is 
the motto of our National Guard, our 
citizen soldiers, who, since 1636, have 
been prepared at all times as the first 
line of defense for our country. 
When a natural disaster strikes—hur-
ricanes, 
wildfires, 
tsunamis, 
earth-
quakes, volcanic eruptions—who do we 
call? We call the National Guard. 
When 
a 
human-made 
disaster 
strikes—chemical 
spills, 
large-scale 
electrical power outages—who do we 
call? We call the National Guard. 
When States and local governments 
get overwhelmed because of situations 
beyond their control, who do those 
Governors, mayors, and State legisla-
tures call? They call the National 
Guard. 
When a global health pandemic crip-
ples the country, who do we call? We 
call the National Guard. 
And when an assault on our Nation’s 
Capitol, a deadly insurrection, hap-
pens, who do we call to protect this 
hallowed beacon of democracy, to en-
sure a safe, peaceful transfer of power 
can occur? We called the National 
Guard. 
Every single time—‘‘Always Ready, 
Always There’’—the National Guard 
has answered the call. Our National 
Guard keeps us safe and has done so 
since the inception of our democracy. 
Following the deadly January 6 in-
surrection and leading up to the inau-
guration of our President and Vice 
President on January 20, Congress 
called upon the National Guard, and an 
unprecedented 26,700 guardsmen from 
across the country were deployed to se-
cure our Nation’s Capitol and protect 
the very lawmakers and staff that 
work in this Capitol. 
The Guard then continued to serve 
and support civil authorities in Wash-
ington, D.C., for the next 137 days. 
They left their families. Many took un-
expected leave from their civilian jobs 
during a health pandemic to report to 
our Nation’s Capitol. They stood watch 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, many 
times in the frigid cold in the dark of 
night. 
Many of us got to know them person-
ally. We brought them food, coffee. We 
met them on the ramp at Andrews Air 
Force Base. We took pictures on the 
Capitol steps. We shook their hands 
and thanked them and their families 
for their service. 
Our National Guard fulfilled their 
duty bravely and completed their mis-
sion. Now, it is Congress’ turn to not 
only pay our respects but pay the bill 
that is due. What bill? What am I talk-
ing about? Well, it cost $521 million to 
protect our Nation’s Capitol for those 
137 days. 
National Guard leadership, adjutant 
generals, and State Governors sent 
their guardsmen to our Nation’s Cap-
itol with the promise that those funds 
would be repaid in a timely manner. As 
a result, the Army and Air National 
Guard paid for the Capitol Response 
mission and fronted the money from 
their own fiscal year 2021 funding. 
Time is of the essence, and we must 
pay them the money that we owe im-
mediately and before August 1. 
The reality is, if we fail to issue re-
imbursements by August 1, there will 
be real consequences. The National 
Guard Bureau has already sent out no-
tices to States regarding canceling the 
remaining annual training days and/or 
canceling August and September drills. 
If training is canceled, several thou-
sand guardsmen will not have enough 
service time this fiscal year to receive 
credit for a good year toward military 
retirement. 
Approximately 2,000 functional and 
occupational training schools will be 
canceled, 
affecting 
their 
readiness, 
pay, and career progression. Ground ve-
hicle and rotary wing operations and 
maintenance will be halted. Air Na-
tional Guard flying operations will be 
negatively impacted, as they just only 
now begin the recovery from the effects 
of the pandemic. The 54th Security 
Forces 
Assistance 
Brigade 
combat 
training center rotation next month, in 
August, will be canceled. 
Without reimbursement by August 1, 
it will take years to recover our readi-
ness, which will be immediately im-
pacted and decrease by up to 20 per-
cent. 
Those are some of the operational 
and readiness impacts of not meeting 
that August 1 deadline. But the real 
damages, Madam Speaker, are the pro-
found personal impacts, which will 
have an immediate effect on the mo-
rale of those soldiers and airmen, their 
families, and retention across the 54 
States and territories. 
The increased psychological stress on 
our National Guard servicemembers 
and families in an already highly 
stressed environment is absolutely un-
acceptable. They are being asked to 
suffer, to sacrifice, because this body,

Congress, is unable to meet its end of a 
good-faith agreement with State lead-
ers fully expecting to be reimbursed 
and not having to ‘‘take it out of 
hide,’’ which is what the National 
Guard is being asked to do now. 
To put it simply, guardsmen—and I 
hear from them every single day—are 
in absolute disbelief that after all they 
have done this last year, answering our 
Nation’s call, this is how they are 
being treated. 
Madam Speaker, today is July 21. We 
have 11 days. We must take immediate 
action. I urge all of us in Congress to 
swiftly come to an agreement on an ap-
propriations emergency bill that in-
cludes full reimbursement of $521 mil-
lion for our National Guard by August 
1. That is the least we can do for our 
citizen soldiers and their families who 
are always ready and always there.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
CHARLES ‘‘CHUCK’’ POETTKER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Charles 
‘‘Chuck’’ Poettker who passed away 
suddenly on Saturday. 
I had the honor of calling Chuck a 
friend. And I know that he is leaving a 
legacy that has impacted so many. 
A U.S. Army veteran, Chuck served 
in the 101st Airborne Division sta-
tioned at Camp Evans in South Viet-
nam. At just 20 years old, he and his 
unit were given orders for a rescue mis-
sion in Laos. They were tasked with 
rescuing two door gunners and recov-
ering the bodies of a downed helicopter 
pilot and co-pilot. Because of his heroic 
actions during the mission and journey 
back to safety, Chuck was awarded the 
U.S. Army Bronze Star. 
A man of faith, Chuck prayed that if 
he made it out alive, he would dedicate 
his life to building something of value 
for others. He did just that. 
He returned home and began a career 
as an apprentice carpenter, taking 
night classes in construction manage-
ment at what is now the Southwestern 
Illinois College. He went on and found-
ed Poettker Construction, leading the 
company for 41 years. Today, the com-
pany employs over 200 families across 
26 States. 
He was also committed to his com-
munity and giving back to the Metro 
East area there in southern Illinois 
through numerous charities. 
Madam Speaker, my prayers go out 
to Chuck’s wife, Linda, and his family 
and many friends during this difficult 
time. 
SUPPORTING APPRENTICESHIPS FOR VETERANS 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I also 
rise today to talk about the fact that 
when I ran Bost Trucking company for 
10 years, many of our hardest workers 
and most trusted employees shared 
something in common. They were vet-
erans. 
The military teaches servicemembers 
invaluable skills, leadership, team-
work, and dedication to compete and 
complete the missions that they are as-
signed. But many veterans are facing 
challenges 
in 
finding 
work 
after 
COVID–19 shutdowns. That is why I 
have introduced the Veterans’ Agricul-
tural Apprenticeship Act. 
This bipartisan bill will help connect 
out-of-work veterans with farmers and 
ranchers who are in need of on-the- 
farm labor. It will help farmers and 
ranchers expand their operations while 
also offering the veterans new skills 
and career paths once they return 
home. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from Florida (Mr. LAWSON) and 
our bipartisan group of 15 additional 
cosponsors for supporting this criti-
cally important bill. I hope that more 
of our colleagues will join us in helping 
advance a win-win solution to an ever- 
growing problem. 
f 
INVESTING IN RURAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I stand 
today before this deliberative body to 
talk about the importance of rural in-
frastructure; more specifically, water-
shed and flood control infrastructure. 
Our Nation’s watershed dams play a 
critical yet silent role in many of our 
daily lives. Across the Nation, water-
shed projects provide an estimated an-
nual benefit of $2.2 billion in reduced 
flood and erosion damage and improv-
ing wildlife, habitat, recreation, and 
water supply for more than 47 million 
people. 
In my home State of Oklahoma 
alone, there are more than 2,000 water-
shed dam projects that help Oklaho-
mans meet a myriad of public needs: 
public safety, water supply, soil health, 
and fish and wildlife management, just 
to name a few. 
b 1045 
In fact, the country’s first upstream 
flood control dam, Cloud Creek Site 
No. 1, was built right in the backyard 
of my district in Washita County. Built 
in 1948, following the passage of the 
Flood Control Act of 1944, the dam al-
lowed for the preservation of farmland, 
wildlife, and several municipal serv-
ices. 
Fast forward to today, and many of 
our country’s 12,000 watershed dams 
have exceeded their designed lifespan. 
Like so much of the public infrastruc-
ture investments across this country, 
our watershed dams are aging and need 
to be upgraded to remain safe and con-
tinue to provide benefits for genera-
tions to come. 
Seeing the need to rehabilitate many 
of our dams, in 2000 I authored the 
Small 
Watershed 
Rehabilitation 
Amendments which have provided im-
portant investments to help countless 
dams in need of repair. 
After more than two decades of fund-
ing through the Small Watershed Re-
habilitation Amendments, more than 
$900 million has been appropriated for 
rehabilitating aging dams. In the 2018 
farm bill alone, we provided $50 million 
per year in mandatory funding for wa-
tershed rehabilitation and manage-
ment. 
I am proud to mark the 20th anniver-
sary of the Small Watershed Rehabili-
tation Amendments being signed into 
law this past year, but we must not 
delay the continued need to rehabili-
tate and repair other aging dams and 
water infrastructure. These silent sen-
tinels are vital to public safety, eco-
nomic prosperity, community viability 
and must not be allowed to fail. 
We learned a lot of lessons 20 years 
ago in passing the dam rehabilitation 
bill. Now we must continue this mis-
sion as we debate and consider infra-
structure legislation. 
Madam Speaker, to aid in these ef-
forts, I include in the RECORD
the 
brought forth report at damsafety.org \ 
smallwatershed. 
In closing, as Congress negotiates on 
how best to invest in our Nation’s in-
frastructure, we must continue to in-
vest in the rehabilitation of these 
aging public works. 
It is time to put the lessons of past 
appropriate investment to good use and 
build the capacity of a new generation 
to protect critical infrastructures for 
decades to come.

RECOGNIZING TIMOTHY J. BURKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the hard work and 
success of Timothy J. Burke, who re-
tired from the Omaha Public Power 
District on July 2 after serving the 
company for 24 years. He began his ca-
reer with OPPD in 1997 as vice presi-
dent and in 2015 took over as the com-
pany’s 12th President and CEO. 
During his time with OPPD, Tim 
faced some tough challenges, but with 
his 
tenacity 
and 
great 
leadership 
skills, he overcame them all. 
Burke’s tenure as CEO will be re-
membered as one of transition. He 
made several decisions early on that 
set the future for OPPD. When he be-
came the CEO, OPPD initiated utility- 
wide lean financial work to make the 
utility financially efficient and strong. 
Burke also made what he called the 
most difficult decision he ever made or 
had been involved with, recommending 
the closure of Fort Calhoun Nuclear 
Generating Station due to financial 
concerns and economies of scale at the 
country’s smallest nuclear plant. 
In addition, under Burke, the com-
pany continued to achieve financial 
stability and 5 straight years of no gen-
eral rate increase—which is amazing— 
which is now in its fifth year of no rate 
increases. Further, Burke’s time at 
OPPD included a transition to more re-
newable energy and the commitment 
to be a net zero-carbon emitter by 2050.

July 21, 2021 
Throughout his career, Burke has re-
mained active in local and industry or-
ganizations. His recent involvement in-
cludes the American Public Power As-
sociation, Large Public Power Council, 
Nebraska Power Association, the Busi-
ness Ethics Alliance trustee, and the 
past chair and executive committee of 
the Greater Omaha Chamber of Com-
merce and United Way of the Midlands. 
He has also been heavily involved with 
Offutt Air Force Base and STRATCOM 
and 
has 
served 
as 
chair 
of 
the 
STRATCOM Consultation Committee. 
He is on the executive committee of 
the Offutt Air Force Base Advisory 
Council, and he has been a civic leader 
with the Air Force Chief of Staff and 
the Air Force Global Strike Command 
Civic Leader program. 
I had 16 assignments in the Air Force 
and found the local community around 
Offutt to be the most supportive and 
welcoming of all, and Tim embodies 
that patriotic welcoming spirit to the 
fullest. 
Family is extremely important to 
Tim. He and his wife, Terri, have three 
sons, five grandchildren, and a sixth 
grandbaby on the way. 
Post retirement, Tim is looking for-
ward to first spending more time with 
his family and then finding ways to 
keep himself busy in the local area. He 
has been heavily involved in the local 
area, and I am sure he will continue to 
do so, and we need him. 
On top of all of this, one of Tim’s pas-
sions is music, especially playing with 
his Irish pub band, the Shenanigans, 
with two of his sons. Burke is an excep-
tional leader and a skilled communi-
cator and has served the Omaha area 
with honor and distinction. 
We thank Tim for his time with 
OPPD and for keeping the power on for 
those living in southeast Nebraska.

HYDE AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my strong opposition to 
President Biden’s budget proposal for 
its exclusion of the Hyde amendment, 
which for 45 years has protected Ameri-
cans from forced financial complicity 
in abortion and abortion services. 
When 
Congress 
passed 
the 
Hyde 
amendment in 1976, our country’s law-
makers had the sense and decency to 
agree that if abortions were going to 
take place in this country, then at 
least dissenting Americans wouldn’t 
get stuck with the bill. Forcing people 
to pay for the killing of babies with 
their tax dollars is unconscionable. 
That is why the Hyde amendment was 
passed. 
Now, the President wants to revoke 
this protection, as if his $6 trillion 
budget—which would blatantly require 
us to raise taxes or print money unto 
bankruptcy—wasn’t already disastrous 
enough. 
I believe that life begins at concep-
tion and that unborn children in our 
country have a right to live. Every 
Member of Congress should, but one 
does not need to in order to support the 
Hyde amendment, which prohibits the 
Federal Government from forcing the 
American public to do something that 
we should never ask them to do: pay 
for abortions. 
HUTCHINSON FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the First District’s Hutch-
inson 
Community 
College 
football 
team on their National Junior College 
Athletic Association National Cham-
pionship. 
Earlier this month I spoke on this 
very floor about playing eight-man 
football in rural Kansas. I indicated 
there were clear winners and losers in 
the game. On June 5, 2021, the Blue 
Dragons finished the regular season as 
clear winners, undefeated, and ranked 
number one. On top of that, first year 
Head Coach Drew Dallas went on to be 
named the 2020 through 2021 NJCAA 
Football Coach of the Year. 
This is the program’s first national 
championship and third undefeated 
season. The talent, time, and effort 
that these student athletes put into 
playing football while obtaining a col-
lege education is remarkable. 
Congratulations again to the Hutch-
inson 
Community 
College 
football 
team and to Coach Dallas.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTHONY 
CAZILLO III 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Anthony 
Cazillo, III, who passed away last 
month at the young age of 26 years old. 
Anthony made an exceptional impact 
in his short life in the lives that he 
touched and in the community that he 
lived. He served as a township super-
visor in Pequea Township, Lancaster 
County, and he was running for reelec-
tion this year. 
To serve in elected office at such a 
young age speaks to the life of service 
that Anthony lived and the passion 
that he had for improving his commu-
nity. One of Anthony’s goals as a su-
pervisor was to ‘‘make Pequea Town-
ship boring again.’’ This is just one ex-
ample of his wit, his sense of humor, 
and I believe indicative of the servant’s 
spirit that he carried as a local elected 
official. 
Anthony 
was 
a 
graduate 
of 
Millersville University and the Penn 
Manor School District. He is survived 
by his wife, Katelyn; his parents; and 
his sisters. 
My condolences and prayers of com-
fort are with the Cazillo family, his 
friends, and all those who grieve for 
Anthony. 
I was really thankful to have gotten 
to know him in recent years. We cer-
tainly wished that Anthony could have 
been with all of us longer, but we do 
give thanks for the time spent with 
him. 
UTZ’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an iconic business and 
household brand name from Pennsylva-
nia’s 11th Congressional District. 
Utz Brands of Hanover—the ‘‘Snack 
Food Capital of the World’’—is cele-
brating its 100th year in business and 
now has the fifth generation of family 
members as part of the company. 
Founded as Hanover Home Brand Po-
tato Chips by Bill and Salie Utz in 1921 
with just $300, the company used hand- 
operated equipment to produce up to 50 
pounds of potato chips per hour from 
their home. 
Quickly outgrowing the volume they 
were able to produce from their home, 
the company changed its name to Utz 
Potato Chip Company and purchased 
land to build their first factory on Car-
lisle Street in Hanover in 1947. 
Fifty pounds of potato chips per hour 
in 1921 has grown to 5.5 million pounds 
of snacks produced each week. Utz 
Brand operates 15 factories in the 
United States, generating over $1 bil-
lion in sales annually. The company’s 
headquarters and six manufacturing fa-
cilities, as well as 1,800 employees who 
staff those facilities, call Pennsylva-
nia’s 11th District home. 
Utz is certainly one of the key fami-
lies and companies that have earned 
Hanover the moniker of the ‘‘Snack 
Food Capital of the World.’’ They have 
made an extraordinary impact on the 
community that I represent through 
their business and charitable efforts. 
I want to congratulate them on this 
remarkable milestone of 100 years in 
business and wish them continued suc-
cess in the next century as well. 
EIGHTEEN DAYS FOR H.R. 18 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of life and our Na-
tion’s unborn children. 
For over 40 years, the Hyde amend-
ment has kept taxpayer money from 
funding abortions, and it is estimated 
to have saved at least 2.4 million lives. 
Polling consistently shows that a 
majority of Americans oppose being 
forced to pay for abortions with their 
tax money. This is something that we 
all should be able to agree on. However, 
House Democrats recently passed a 
spending bill for the Department of 
Health and Human Services that, for 
the first time since 1976, does not in-
clude the Hyde amendment. 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, would make the prohibi-
tion against Federal funding for abor-
tions permanent and government-wide. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18. 
Life is a precious gift, and we must 
do all that we can to ensure that we de-
fend the unborn who have no voice to 
speak for themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 21, 2021 
RECOGNIZING VFW POST 7814 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 75th anniversary of 
the Thomas-Fields Veterans of Foreign 
Wars Post 7814, which was founded on 
July 11, 1946. 
When African-American veterans of 
World War II returned to their homes 
in the Staunton-Augusta area, they 
were, unfortunately, excluded from 
their local VFW Post. Following their 
denied admittance, a group of 42 vet-
erans then applied for a charter to or-
ganize their own post, which would 
carry the namesakes of Charles Thom-
as and Glenwood Fields, two African 
Americans from Staunton who died 
while serving their country in World 
War II. 
Since its formation, the Thomas- 
Fields Post has been an active civic or-
ganization in the African-American 
community of Staunton and Augusta 
County, as well as playing an active 
and significant role in local area vet-
erans’ activities. 
While the post welcomes all veterans, 
it continues to highlight the heritage 
of African-American and minority vet-
erans who have served our Nation. 
Recently, Post 7814 was recognized as 
a Meritorious Post by the State VFW 
Federation for its outstanding work 
over the last 5 years and was also 
named an All-American Post by the 
National VFW Council for the first 
time in its history. 
The Thomas-Fields VFW Post is to 
be commended for its work in our com-
munity and their efforts to aid those 
who served. I congratulate them on 
this historic milestone and wish them 
another successful 75 years.

SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF CUBA 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
offer my support for the Cuban people 
who have taken to the streets to pro-
test the oppressive Communist regime 
there, a regime that has stripped them 
of their basic human rights. 
Since its inception 62 years ago, the 
Communist Party has caused immeas-
urable harm and created unbearable 
conditions in Cuba. 
Cuba’s people want freedom. They 
want to provide for their families and 
know that their kids will be safe and 
healthy—and Cuba is not that place, 
and it hasn’t been that place for far too 
long. 
Right now, its people are facing wide-
spread power outages, the most severe 
food shortage since the 1990s and infla-
tion rates nearing 500 percent. 
In an effort to contain the truth 
about what is really going on, the gov-
ernment cut off its citizens’ access to 
the internet to silence the dissent. 
Instead of trying to address the 
issues plaguing the island nation, they 
have, instead, decided to suppress those 
voicing concern. Since the protest 
began, more than 100 people have been 
detained or have gone missing, includ-
ing artists, peace activists, and priests. 
It should be no surprise that Cubans 
are marching in the streets demanding 
their rights. 
We have all seen the images of people 
waving American flags and fleeing in 
makeshift boats overflowing with folks 
willing to risk their lives to experience 
freedom. They want what we are so 
blessed to have, and, yet, there is a seg-
ment of our society bent on pushing 
the United States toward the failed no-
tion of communism and socialism. It is 
mind-boggling. 
We must stand strongly for freedom, 
stand firmly with the people, and stand 
boldly with a free Cuba. 
f 
DEFENDING THE UNBORN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in defense of the precious lives of 
our unborn. Last week, my colleagues 
in the Appropriations Committee voted 
to authorize taxpayer-funded abortions 
by passing a spending bill that omits 
the Hyde amendment. 
The Hyde amendment prohibits tax-
payer dollars from being used to fund 
abortions and it has saved an esti-
mated 2.5 million lives. It has been in-
cluded in every appropriations package 
since 1976 until now. The move to 
eliminate Hyde is another blatant at-
tack on the sanctity of life, following 
this administration’s budget proposal 
that has also failed to include the Hyde 
amendment and other pro-life policies 
in Federal programs. 
This is a crucial moment for all of us 
to uphold the inherent dignity of 
human life. Every unborn child should 
have the right to life. There are few 
greater priorities. I will continue to do 
everything in my power to protect the 
vulnerable, to safeguard taxpayer con-
sciences, and to preserve the sanctity 
of life. We must protect the Hyde 
amendment. 
LIBERTY FOR CUBA 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to advocate for liberty, for free-
dom. For over 60 years, the Cuban peo-
ple have been oppressed by the worst 
impulses of a brutal regime and the 
failed promises of Communist propa-
ganda. What we are seeing today is 
those people are saying ‘‘enough is 
enough.’’ The Cuban people are shout-
ing ‘‘libertad’’ for freedom, waving 
American flags and rising up to finally 
demand independence and autonomy 
over their own lives. 
Cuba is showing us in real time. In 
fact, they are showing the world in real 
time that massive government control 
over society simply does not work, and 
how its demise quickly spirals into 
deadly conditions of poverty, starva-
tion, and hopelessness. 
I recently had the chance to speak to 
a Cuban American and a Cuban. Their 
stories are horrific about the atrocities 
that their own government is using, 
the violence, that they are using to 
control the society. 
This is causing enough desperation 
that Cubans will stare down their op-
pressors in the streets. They will risk 
their lives, crossing treacherous waters 
on homemade rafts to reach the shores 
of America, the shores of freedom. 
The truth is clear: The United States 
remains the beacon of freedom and de-
mocracy around the world. We must do 
everything in our power to keep it that 
way and valiantly support liberty at 
home and abroad. 
FLEEING OF TEXAS DEMOCRATS 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express disappointment in the 
dereliction of duty of Texas Democrats 
who last week in the State legislature 
decided to flee the State to keep the 
Texas House from taking any action 
during the special session. 
This stunt, complete with private 
jets 
and 
plenty 
of 
congratulatory 
media coverage, slows the passage of 
initiatives including: family violence 
prevention, property tax relief; support 
for our teachers; and a widely sup-
ported bill to strengthen election in-
tegrity. 
The majority of Texans support safe-
guarding our elections. Unfortunately, 
colleagues in the Texas House are ped-
dling lies about the election integrity 
bill. In reality, this measure merely 
disbands COVID–19 voting protocols 
that had never been used prior to 2020, 
while creating a more secure voting 
process. 
Showing ID, proving who you are in a 
State and Federal Government election 
allows thousands of people to enter il-
legally every single day, and ending 
voting at 4 o’clock in the morning. It is 
time for the media and the Washington 
elites who are cheering on this charade 
to see it for what it really is: political 
theater. Texans deserve better.

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, last year, in my hometown of 
Buffalo, New York, we experienced a 90 
percent increase in gun violence; 355 
people were involved in this. 
As of July of this year, 46 people have 
lost their lives to gun violence. This 
morning, the Gun Violence Prevention 
Task Force heard from experts in com-
munity violence interventions. These 
experts affirmed what we know; that 
gun violence in our country is tearing 
families 
and 
neighborhoods 
apart. 
Their testimony adds support for our 
efforts to provide $5 million in the 
American Rescue Plan Act funding to 
groups in Buffalo to prevent and reduce 
violence before it occurs. 
This funding will support trusted 
messengers, good messengers, credible 
messengers; 
a 
coalition 
of 
peace-
keeping organizations who will work 
on our streets to stop violence before it 
occurs. 
Congress passed the American Rescue 
Plan to deliver relief to communities 
ravaged by the pandemic. Now our 
communities are facing a spike in vio-
lence that began during the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, they need help, and 
they need help now. 
f 
INFLATION IS TAXATION 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
impact of rising inflation on American 
consumers. 
The Consumer Price Index jumped by 
5.4 percent this year through June, the 
largest year-over-year gain since 2008. 
From the higher cost of gas, to the 
higher price of used cars, to the price 
of food at your local grocery store, 
small businesses and Americans are 
paying more for goods and services, due 
in large part to government spending 
during COVID–19 and now Democrats’ 
reckless economic agenda. 
It is as simple as this: Inflation is 
taxation. 
As a small business owner for 50 
years, I can tell you these increased 
prices are creating challenges for con-
sumers 
whose 
budgets 
are 
being 
stretched thinner and thinner every 
single month. 
The Democrat solution to all of this? 
Ram through a partisan $3.5 trillion 
package that will further increase 
taxes on the American people and com-
pletely disregard rising inflation. 
It is pretty simple. 
Raising taxes, less jobs. 
Lower tax, more jobs. 
Congress must return to some fiscal 
sanity and Democrats must resist the 
temptation to spend our way out of 
this situation, as rising inflation and 
the growing national debt become an 
unrelenting enemy. 
In God we trust. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on the 200th day 
of the House Democrats delivering for 
the people. 
Madam Speaker, over the years, I 
have had the opportunity to mentor 
young girls from hard-pressed families, 
and I will tell you this, they taught me 
more than I ever could teach them. 
And I learned that even with mothers 
working two jobs, there were weeks of 
just peanut butter in their pantry and 
having to move place to place just to 
find affordable rent. 
That is why I celebrate the historic 
expansion of the child tax credit in the 
American Rescue package, because it 
has the power to lift millions of chil-
dren out of poverty, give them the fu-
tures they deserve. It is going to help 
our families thrive and our economy to 
recover. We can build back better by 
lifting our children. 
f 
HONORING JIM STABERG 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, be-
fore I begin my remarks here, I want to 
wish my eldest daughter, Karlyn Tif-
fany, a happy birthday. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a 
great American and resident of my dis-
trict in Wisconsin. Jim Staberg of Hud-
son served in the Army from March of 
1943 to June of 1946, and again Sep-
tember 1950 to July 1952. 
During his first tour of duty, Mr. 
Staberg was originally assigned to the 
Army band, but as America was drawn 
into World War II, he found himself re-
assigned and serving as a gunner dur-
ing vehicle patrols throughout Europe. 
Mr. Staberg was involved in a heroic 
defensive stand by the Allies against 
Hitler’s last charge at the Battle of the 
Bulge. He also served at the historic 
Nuremburg trials following the war, 
but this was not the end of Mr. 
Staberg’s service. 
Jim was shipped off to Korea for a 
second tour of duty, where he would, 
once again, defend freedom in the face 
of communist aggression. After his 
time in service, Jim married and had 
three children in Hudson, Wisconsin, 
which he still calls home today. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grate-
ful State and Nation, I thank Jim 
Staberg for his service. 
f 
200 DAYS OF WORK FOR THE 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, today marks the 200th day of 
this Congress and of House Democrats 
working for the people. 
Working together with the Biden ad-
ministration, we have put our economy 
back on track, curbed the spread of 
COVID–19, and put money into the 
pockets of our constituents. It was 
only Democrats that voted for the 
American Rescue Plan, which helped 
create 3 million jobs, deliver stimulus 
checks, and extend the child tax credit. 
The American Rescue Plan also de-
livered on one of my most urgent prior-
ities, ending the maternal mortality 
crisis. Allowing States to extend Med-
icaid coverage for postpartum care 
from 
60 
days 
to 
one 
full 
year 
postpartum will save lives. 
Outside of the recovery package, we 
have continued working on other prior-
ities, like advancing a pathway to citi-
zenship for Dreamers and passing com-
monsense 
gun 
violence 
prevention 
measures to protect and improve the 
lives of everyday Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3768 
July 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, in just 200 days, we 
have accomplished so much, but rest 
assured, we are just getting started. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to defend the conscience of 
American taxpayers. Since 1973, both 
sides of the aisle have agreed that tax-
payers should not be forced to fund the 
taking of an unborn child’s life through 
abortion. This consensus was enshrined 
in the Hyde amendment. The Hyde 
amendment has saved the lives of al-
most 2.5 million children, including 
over 65,000 in my home State of North 
Carolina. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
unfortunately, 
President 
Biden 
and 
Congressional 
Democrats have decided to abandon the 
Hyde amendment in this year’s budget. 
This is a grave mistake that will cost 
the lives of more innocent children, 
and therefore, it must be reversed. 
Madam Speaker, let’s show that this 
House stands with life, believes in 
science, and opposes the evil of abor-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and I 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KELLY of Illinois). Under the guidelines 
consistently 
issued 
by 
successive 
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of 
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair 
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the 
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships. 
f 
DELIVERING FOR THE PEOPLE 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
today, we mark 200 days of the 117th 
Congress and 200 days of delivering for 
the people. 
From day one, House Democrats have 
prioritized the needs of everyday Amer-
icans, working families, and our chil-
dren. 
We 
have 
delivered 
trans-
formative, lifesaving legislation that 
focuses on our recovery from this pan-
demic. 
The American Rescue Plan has been 
successful in getting shots in arms, 
workers back to work, and money in 
the pockets of families, and children 
back to school. This was one of the big-
gest jolts to our health and our econ-
omy in history, and we cannot let up 
on our efforts. 
We must build on this momentum 
and pass President Biden’s American 
Families Plan and the American Jobs 
Plan, and we must seize this moment, 
rebuild strong, and rebuild by making 
bold, sustained investments in our Na-
tion and in our future. 
f 
CZECH DEPOT EXPLOSION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this month, I was grateful to 
participate in a Congressional delega-
tion of the OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly led by Senator ROGER WICKER 
and Senator BEN CARDIN. It was inspir-
ing to see the extraordinary economic 
advances of Estonia and Bulgaria. 
In Tallinn, Estonia, we were wel-
comed by the dynamic Prime Minister, 
Kaja Kallas, and the dedicated Foreign 
Minister, Eva-Maria Liimets. While in 
Tallinn, we learned that Russian dip-
lomats had been expelled in April 
across the Baltics to join the protest of 
the 
Czech 
Prime 
Minister, 
Andrej 
Babis, exposing the irrefutable evi-
dence that two Russian GRU agents 
were behind the 2014 ammunition depot 
explosion at Vrbetice, which killed two 
persons. 
The same two Russian agents named 
by the Czech Republic are suspected by 
British 
authorities 
for 
poisoning 
former Russian double agent Sergei 
Skripal and his daughter in England in 
2018. The Czech Republic has correctly 
demanded Russia pay for damages. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chalmers and 
Lori Anne Carr of Titan Farms for 
their annual delivery of South Carolina 
peaches to Capitol Hill. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
18, the No Taxpayer Funding For Abor-
tion Act. This bill would make the 
Hyde amendment permanent and gov-
ernment-wide. 
Mr. Speaker, Hyde saves lives. For 
more than 40 years, this amendment 
has protected vulnerable, unborn life 
by preventing taxpayer dollars from 
funding abortions. Named after Illinois 
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Hyde 
amendment has enjoyed decades of 
broad, bipartisan support. 
During 
this 
time 
the 
Charlotte 
Lozier Institute estimates the Hyde 
amendment has saved over 2 million 
lives. I am proud to stand up for vul-
nerable life. As the father of a beau-
tiful two-year-old girl, I have come to 
appreciate the sanctity of newborn life 
in a profound way. We owe it to them, 
and to each other, to protect their lives 
in every way possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE). As the Chair previously advised, 
the request cannot be entertained ab-
sent appropriate clearance.

SUPPORTING FREEDOM-LOVING 
CUBANS 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, freedom-loving Cubans have 
taken to the streets to protest the so-
cialist, Marxist Castro regime that has 
held a deadly grip over Cuba for 60 
years. 
Cubans are protesting to secure the 
blessings of liberty that now so many 
in this country are showing disdain for. 
The socialist Castro regime embraces a 
backward economy that prides itself on 
taking everything it can from the peo-
ple until there is nothing left. There 
are no means for justice, no opportuni-
ties for success outside the bounds of 
tyranny, and no consideration for the 
God-given rights of their people. 
Let this be a lesson to the world and 
to my socialist colleagues across the 
aisle. Communism does not work. 
There is no example in history of any 
modern society benefiting from Marx-
ist rule, and any attempt to paint so-
cialist and communist dictatorships as 
anything but cruel is peddling lies and 
fiction. 
The pro-democracy demonstrations 
in Cuba are sending a powerful mes-
sage: Communism is oppressive and de-
nies people their basic freedom. 
Cubans deserve our strong, unwaver-
ing support, and I will always stand up 
for freedom fighters around the world.

TAX PLAN WILL SET BACK 
ECONOMY 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share my concerns with the 
far-left tax hikes proposed by the ma-
jority. 
To help pay for their partisan spend-
ing sprees, the President and Demo-
crats in Congress have proposed to dou-
ble the tax on investment and raise our 
business tax rate to the highest in the 
developed world. 
On top of this, they wish to repeal 
the stepped-up basis, a move that will 
disproportionately hurt family-owned 
farms and businesses. 
The radical tax agenda will stifle in-
vestment and slow down our economic 
recovery at a time when communities

across our country continue to feel the 
effects of the pandemic and govern-
ment lockdowns. 
It will also hurt American competi-
tiveness abroad and force even more 
businesses and jobs overseas. Increas-
ing taxes on Americans while prices 
are rising faster than they have in 
more than a decade isn’t just irrespon-
sible; it is dangerous. 
The Democrat tax plan will hurt 
workers and small businesses, diminish 
our position as a global business lead-
er, and set our economy back for dec-
ades to come.

VACCINATING TO STOP RISE OF 
DELTA VARIANT 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to discuss the issue of vac-
cinations, vaccine hesitancy, and the 
rising rates of the COVID–19 delta vari-
ant. 
For the last few months, I have trav-
eled across my district administering 
vaccines to Iowans. It has been a pleas-
ure to see my constituents and the en-
tire country have a renewed sense of 
freedom and begin to return to normal. 
But fully engaged living is threat-
ened by the delta variant, which is 
causing increased hospitalizations and 
death, 
especially 
among 
those 
unvaccinated. Those vaccinated have a 
much milder course of disease. 
It is miraculous to have three safe 
and effective vaccines for COVID–19 so 
rapidly. However, this speed of develop-
ment may give some Americans pause. 
Therefore, it is critical to emphasize 
that no safety shortcuts were taken 
and reassure our constituents that 
they are safe and effective. 
Decades of research informed the de-
velopment of these breakthrough vac-
cines, and millions have been vac-
cinated with tremendously low risk. 
Given the rise in the delta variant, I 
would once again encourage everyone 
to get a vaccine as soon as possible so 
that we continue our path to normalcy 
and not go back to lockdowns and 
mask mandates. 
This vaccine is how we get back to 
normal and get our lives back. If you 
have questions or concerns, please talk 
to your doctor. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
take this time to wish the youngest of 
10 in our family, Mari-Eleanor Martino, 
a happy birthday. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KATIE 
NAGEOTTE 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, after postponing 1 year due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I am excited that, 
on Friday, the Olympic Games in 
Tokyo will officially begin. 
What better way to mark this occa-
sion than by recognizing the incredible 
accomplishment of Katie Nageotte, 
who will be one of the many Olympians 
competing 
in 
this 
year’s 
summer 
games. 
A native of Olmsted Falls, Katie is a 
graduate of Olmsted Falls High School 
and Ashland University who will be 
representing our community and coun-
try in this summer’s games, competing 
in the women’s pole vault event. 
Her victory at the U.S. trials in the 
women’s pole vault event caps a 5-year 
campaign to reach the Olympic Games, 
and she joins an elite list of northeast 
Ohioans to qualify for the games. 
I am incredibly proud of Katie for 
earning this opportunity to represent 
not only our community but the 
United States. 
Congratulations to Katie and her 
family. We look forward to watching 
her make northeast Ohio proud.

HONORING MOHAMMAD HOSSEIN 
MEHRMAND 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor my constituent, Mr. Moham-
mad Hossein Mehrmand. 
Mr. Mehrmand was a lieutenant gen-
eral in the Imperial Iranian Air Force. 
Prior to the revolution in 1979, Iran 
and the United States were close allies. 
U.S. fighter jets were based in Iran, 
and a number of U.S. military per-
sonnel were as well. When the revolu-
tion occurred, the U.S. Embassy rec-
ommended that all Americans imme-
diately evacuate. Mr. Mehrmand was 
instrumental in negotiating the evacu-
ation of American citizens from Iran, 
and ultimately, nearly 5,000 Americans 
were successfully evacuated from the 
country. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Mehrmand paid a 
very high price for that loyalty. He was 
accused as a traitor. He lost his prop-
erty. Ultimately, he was forced to flee 
to the United States. 
Today, Mr. Mehrmand is 92. He lives 
in my district in California, and he is 
proud to be a United States citizen. 
I join my colleagues in thanking Mr. 
Mehrmand for his service to the people 
of the United States and his loyalty to 
the people with whom he served. 
f 
REMOVING QUALIFIED IMMUNITY 
IS MISGUIDED 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I was in 
my mom’s home county of Madison 
County last week to announce the de-
tails of my new bill, the Local Law En-
forcement Protection Act, H.R. 4500. 
I made this announcement standing 
alongside 
the 
respected 
men 
and 
women of our local law enforcement 
departments across the region, includ-
ing our great Madison County sheriff, 
Todd Hood. 
My bill protects those who protect 
our communities every day by prohib-
iting States and localities that roll 
back or eliminate qualified immunity 
from receiving certain Federal grants. 
Law enforcement officers risk their 
lives to defend our homes, families, and 
our neighborhoods. They face real dan-
ger. In 2020, 264 police officers were 
killed tragically in the line of duty. As 
of July 2021, that number already 
stands at 148. 
As the defund the police movement 
goes mainstream in liberal cities and 
State capitals, and failed progressive 
policies like bail reform make our 
streets less safe, it is more important 
now than ever to stand with our law 
enforcement officers. 
Police should always be accountable 
to the communities they serve, but 
they should never be subjected to un-
fair attacks or harassment simply for 
doing their job. Efforts to remove 
qualified immunity are misguided and 
ultimately hurt honorable officers who 
serve with integrity. 
That is why I introduced this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this commonsense bill.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Hyde 
amendment and urge us to be warriors 
for human dignity and human value. 
We 
must 
cherish 
every 
person’s 
unalienable human right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
With technology today, we can look 
into the womb and watch the develop-
ment of a baby day by day. Doctors are 
able to administer lifesaving care to 
babies before they are born. It is a mir-
acle to witness, and it is proof that life 
begins at conception. 
Our laws should reflect this science 
and the truth. For decades, my col-
leagues across the aisle, including 
President Joe Biden, agreed. I urge 
them to join us to protect life. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, the request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2467, 
the PFAS Action Act of 2021.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2467, the PFAS Ac-
tion Act of 2021, is a comprehensive 
package of strategies to regulate PFAS 
chemicals, clean up contamination, 
and protect public health. I am proud 
to support this bipartisan bill which 
will deliver the tools communities 
across the country need to get PFAS 
out of our environment and out of the 
pathways that lead to our bodies. 
PFAS are an urgent public health 
threat. They are toxic, persistent, and

being found in the environment across 
the country. 
Just how common are they? 
A recent report from the Agency for 
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
concluded that ‘‘Most people in the 
United States have been exposed to 
PFAS and have PFAS in their blood.’’ 
That finding is pretty astounding and 
incredibly 
concerning 
to 
families 
across the Nation. 
After all, these forever chemicals 
have long been linked with adverse 
health effects including cancer, im-
mune system effects, infertility, im-
paired child development, high choles-
terol, and thyroid disease. 
Industry has known about these dan-
gers for decades, but we still have no 
Federal protections from PFAS in 
drinking water, no limits on PFAS air 
emissions, no Federal cleanup require-
ments on PFAS sites, and no limits on 
dumping PFAS into our waterways. We 
don’t even have labeling of PFAS in-
gredients to allow consumers to pro-
tect themselves. 
Right now, the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency is playing catch-up 
after 4 years of little action by the 
Trump administration, but this bill 
will help EPA tackle the complex chal-
lenge of PFAS by taking direct action 
on the two most studied PFAS, PFOS 
and PFOA, right away, while setting a 
reasonable timeline to study and evalu-
ate other PFAS. This approach puts 
the focus on following the science by 
tailoring testing to relevant subgroups 
of PFAS and focusing regulation on the 
riskiest chemicals. 
Mr. Speaker, over a decade ago, 
PFOA and PFOS were voluntarily 
phased out by industry. While no 
longer in use, they continue to threat-
en public health because of widespread 
environmental 
contamination. 
This 
bill will drive environmental cleanups 
of that contamination and drinking 
water treatment, addressing the threat 
of PFOA and PFOS to communities 
across the country. 
Now, all other PFAS will be tested as 
appropriate. And where that testing re-
veals risk, this bill will ensure that 
EPA takes timely action to prevent 
and mitigate environmental contami-
nation. 
In the meantime, this bill will pause 
the introduction of untested new PFAS 
while providing guidance and labels to 
help first responders and consumers 
limit their risk. 
Mr. Speaker, the longer we delay ac-
tion on PFAS, the worse the problem 
becomes. It is time for Congress to act 
and use every tool available to stop the 
flow of PFAS pollution into our envi-
ronment and into our bodies. 
A version of this bill was passed over-
whelmingly last Congress with signifi-
cant bipartisan support. It is cham-
pioned—and I can’t underestimate how 
much Representatives DINGELL
and 
UPTON of Michigan have worked on this 
bill. I commend them for their contin-
ued leadership. 
I also thank Environment and Cli-
mate Change Subcommittee Chairman 
TONKO and Ranking Member MCKINLEY 
for their continued support. 
We can’t delay any longer. We should 
pass this bipartisan legislation today. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the 
PFAS Action Act so that we can fi-
nally take action on these dangerous 
forever chemicals. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing ‘‘no.’’ 
The decision to oppose H.R. 2467 was 
not easy, but this version is not the 
right approach. 
PFAS contamination is a serious 
problem in many congressional dis-
tricts. That is true for me, too. My dis-
trict has PFOA and PFOS contamina-
tion at Fairchild Air Force Base in Air-
way Heights, Washington, and I very 
much want it cleaned up. 
I have problems, though, with H.R. 
2467’s 
overwhelming, 
heavy-handed, 
and unscientific approach. I am strug-
gling with why this aggressive expan-
sion of Federal power and spending is 
the best answer that the people’s House 
can provide. 
What does this massive proposal 
mean, and are we ready to go this far? 
I cannot stress this enough: what we 
are addressing today is not about one, 
two, or just a handful of legacy chemi-
cals. PFAS are, instead, an enormous 
and diverse class of manmade chemi-
cals. EPA’s ‘‘Master List of PFAS Sub-
stances’’ contains more than 9,000 dis-
tinct chemicals, and the definition in 
this bill would apply to every one of 
those 9,252 chemicals and their uses. 
Since the late fall of 2020, Congress 
has enacted 31 separate provisions to 
address PFAS. Congress has compelled 
cleanup of PFAS at military installa-
tions, banned certain uses of PFAS 
chemicals in products, pushed coopera-
tive agreements for cleanups with 
States, and authorized $500 million for 
removing emerging contaminants, es-
pecially PFAS, from drinking water. 
Similarly, EPA has advanced nine 
major regulatory efforts for PFOA, 
PFOS, and some of the other PFAS 
chemicals. 
EPA Administrator Regan also has 
commissioned a multiyear review proc-
ess at EPA to consider any necessary 
modifications and to identify new 
strategies and priorities related to 
PFAS. 
I want strong scientific backing for 
anything that we do to address PFAS 
chemicals. I am concerned that the 
mandates in the PFAS Action Act will 
frustrate EPA’s existing science-based 
plans. This bill instead will cement 
policy choices with long-range implica-
tions. It will overwhelm EPA’s existing 
resources to tackle environmental and 
public health challenges beyond PFAS. 
The PFAS Action Act is not a meas-
ured approach. It prejudges outcomes, 
showing little regard for objective 
science, risk assessment, transparency, 
and public input. 
For example, the bill requires EPA to 
make regulatory determinations with-
in 5 years on 9,250 PFAS chemicals— 
and without public participation. 
This impossible deadline is a lawsuit 
waiting to happen. It requires every 
manufacturer and processor to conduct 
comprehensive testing on all 9,252 
PFAS. This will overwhelm existing 
domestic laboratory capacity to focus 
on any other scientific or public health 
matter. 
Like it or not, some PFAS chemicals 
have specific properties that aren’t eas-
ily addressed with other chemical 
types, like stability and water, oil, 
stain, and heat resistance. This makes 
them crucial in making semiconduc-
tors, lithium ion batteries in electric 
vehicles, solar panels, wind turbine 
parts, medical devices and drugs, and 
protective gear for our military and 
law enforcement. 
This bill would create a hostile envi-
ronment in the United States of Amer-
ica for their manufacture and use. It 
will create a de facto ban in the mar-
ketplace and a boon for trial lawyers. 
It prevents new PFAS from coming on 
to the market for 5 years. This will re-
sult in the drying up of investment in 
safe PFAS chemicals and PFAS prod-
uct purchases. It also will signal to 
trial courts that all PFAS are haz-
ardous. 
It singles out PFAS manufacturers 
and uses a complex and expensive regu-
latory approach. It uses an unattain-
able standard to ban incineration of 
PFAS-contaminated 
material. 
This 
will federalize local trash collection 
and clog our Nation’s remaining land-
fill capacity. 
It attaches permanent, open-ended 
cleanup liability to any person who has 
ever been associated with PFAS, re-
gardless of whether you were a good 
actor. 
Mr. Speaker, cleanup liability is: 
‘‘Strict,’’ so your intent is irrelevant; 
‘‘Joint and several,’’ so you are not 
just responsible for your fair share, you 
are responsible for everyone’s shares; 
And, ‘‘retroactive,’’ so it doesn’t 
matter if the liability occurred 5 years, 
10 years, 20 years, or 50 years ago or 
even further back. 
Given the compliance costs, the side-
lining of investment, the endless liabil-
ity under CERCLA, tort lawsuits, and 
the inability to make or finance safer 
replacement chemicals and products, it 
is not hard to see how H.R. 2467 creates 
a de facto ban on 9,252 chemicals. It 
threatens the viability of every indus-
try that needs these chemicals and 
products that benefit our society. 
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this 
bill essentially bans the materials that 
are necessary for America to win the 
future. That includes protective gear 
for law enforcement at a time when 
violent crime is surging in our country. 
In drafting this legislation over two 
Congresses, the majority never called

EPA to testify on the bill. Now we are 
left with the opinions of the politicians 
and the White House, not the career 
scientists and the experts who will 
have to implement it. So much for 
trust the science. 
In addition, the Congressional Budg-
et Office has had trouble scoring this 
bill and a nearly identical bill from 
last Congress. That is because there 
are so many PFAS chemicals, and the 
mandates in this bill have no limits on 
either the Federal Treasury or the pri-
vate sector. The bill also poses a sig-
nificant burden on EPA’s time and the 
lack of additional resources EPA will 
have to tackle other issues critical to 
their mission. 
We all want to have a good solution 
to address PFAS contamination, but 
this bill falls short, unfortunately. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in opposing this approach. We can 
do better. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), who has done so 
much to protect our environment. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
him for his extraordinary leadership as 
chair of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and I thank him for bring-
ing this important legislation to the 
floor. I thank Mr. TONKO for his leader-
ship as chair of the subcommittee of 
jurisdiction, the Environment and Cli-
mate Change Subcommittee, and I 
thank Mr. MCKINLEY, the ranking 
member on that subcommittee. 
I respectfully disagree with the rank-
ing member of the full committee, and 
I will tell you why. I join our col-
leagues in support of the PFAS Action 
Act to address the serious public 
health issue that is a threat; PFAS 
chemicals, which are contaminating 
the water we drink, the air we breathe, 
and the food we eat. 
First, I salute Representative DEBBIE 
DINGELL, a crusader in our mission to 
protect our communities from dan-
gerous 
PFAS 
chemicals. 
I 
thank, 
again, as I said, Chairman PALLONE, 
Chairman TONKO, and Ranking Member 
MCKINLEY. 
Mr. Speaker, PFAS are referred to as 
‘‘forever chemicals’’. They are so called 
because they do not easily break down 
and even accumulate over time. Right 
now, they are exposing millions of 
Americans to health risks ranging 
from cancer to asthma, and liver dis-
ease to thyroid dysfunction. 
For babies, they can be particularly 
devastating with prenatal exposure po-
tentially leading to abnormal growth 
in utero, low birth rate, and increased 
risk of childhood obesity and infec-
tions. Our distinguished chairman enu-
merated other threats to the health 
and wellbeing of the American people. 
When people ask me: What are the 
three most important issues facing the 
Congress, I always say the same thing: 
Our children, our children, our chil-
dren, their health, their education, the 
economic security of their families, 
and a safe and clean environment 
where they can thrive in a world of 
peace in which they can reach their 
fulfillment. 
Mr. Speaker, PFAS chemicals are 
clearly and seriously harming to our 
children’s health. 
A coalition of public health groups, 
including the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, American Public Health As-
sociation, National Medical Associa-
tion, and Children’s Environmental 
Health Network, have written: ‘‘These 
ubiquitous 
substances 
pose 
severe 
health risks across the United States 
and represent a growing threat to pub-
lic health.’’ 
They further state: ‘‘PFAS are par-
ticularly dangerous . . . widespread 
and likely present in the drinking 
water of tens of millions of Ameri-
cans.’’ 
Further: ‘‘Developing infants and 
children are particularly vulnerable to 
PFAS exposure. . . . 
‘‘Of concern, almost all fetuses and 
infants will have some degree of expo-
sure to PFAS. . . . 
‘‘PFAS exposure before birth or in 
early childhood has been associated 
with decreased birth weight, effects on 
renal function and lipid serum levels, 
and immune system dysfunction.’’ 
That statement was from the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics, American 
Public Health Association, National 
Medical Association, and the Children’s 
Environmental Health Network. 
In addition to our children and young 
people, PFAS also poses a serious risk 
to America’s servicemembers. There is 
an epidemic of contamination on mili-
tary sites with more than 400 sites 
across the United States affected. 
I have had the privilege, Mr. Speaker, 
of hearing the concerns of many of 
these families. It is not just about the 
servicemembers, it is about their chil-
dren who are affected. 
It is unacceptable that the men and 
women who sacrifice to keep us safe 
around the world face this danger to 
their health and that of their children 
here at home. Yet, despite these obvi-
ous and well-known risks, big corpora-
tions have for decades failed or refused 
to prevent their spread. 
b 1245 
A new study published last week 
shows that based on EPA data, an esti-
mated 30,000 industrial sites are known 
or suspected of using toxic PFAS; 12 
times what had been previously esti-
mated. We cannot accept a situation 
where big special interests’ bottom line 
comes before the public’s lives. 
To address this crisis, 2 years ago, 
Democrats crafted strong legislation to 
rid our communities of PFAS. Many 
Democrats, and many Members here, 
played a key role in crafting PFAS-re-
lated bills that were included in the bi-
partisan NDAA agreement reached in 
the House that year. 
I thank Chairman SMITH
and the 
members of the committee. Unfortu-
nately, the GOP Senate then refused to 
support full protections against PFAS 
chemicals and cut those key provisions 
from the NDAA; that is, the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
Last year, House Democrats passed 
the PFAS Action Act of 2019, which 
passed with strong bipartisan support, 
but did not become law because MITCH 
MCCONNELL senselessly refused to take 
it up in the Senate. 
Now the Democratic House will, once 
again, pass the PFAS Action Act and 
send it to the Senate. We are making 
clear that this legislation is a priority 
for the American people, and we will 
not relent until it is enacted. 
This legislation will clean up our 
communities by designating the two 
most-studied PFAS as a hazardous sub-
stance by the EPA and setting a dead-
line for the EPA to make designation 
decisions about all other PFAS chemi-
cals. 
Next, it will create new, well-funded 
grants and partnerships with States to 
help clean up and remedy sites. It will 
stem the tide of further contamination 
with tough new testing, reporting, and 
monitoring requirements; strict limits 
on the introduction of new PFAS 
chemicals; limits on air pollution; ban-
ning unsafe incineration; and strong 
measures to hold contaminating com-
panies accountable. 
I spent the time to be so specific be-
cause this is such a threat to the 
health and well-being of our children, 
our children, our children. I urge a 
strong vote for this legislation, which 
honors our first responsibility of Con-
gress, to keep our American people 
safe. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BUCSHON), an exceptional leader 
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and a cardiothoracic surgeon. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the bill in its 
current form. I support the efforts to 
address dangerous, high levels of PFAS 
in our drinking water systems and 
other areas of our environment. That is 
why I submitted a bipartisan amend-
ment with Mr. SCHRADER that would 
simply exempt PFAS used to manufac-
ture medical devices and drugs that are 
approved by the FDA. It was a very 
limited amendment. 
Polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, 
seen in the graph on the board behind 
me, is used to treat atrial septal de-
fects, most of the time in young chil-
dren. Thanks to great advancements in 
medical technology like this proce-
dure, it is now done in an outpatient 
setting, rather than open-heart sur-
gery. For years, I did open-heart sur-
gery on people with ASDs, and now 
they can repair them with a device. 
This is one device that could be 
banned. 
Vascular grafts to repair aneurysms 
or bypass blocked arteries are another 
example. I implanted hundreds of these 
type of devices in patients. The fact of

the matter is, it has been shown over 
and over that PTFE in devices poses no 
risk to people or to our environment. 
The bill in its current form fails to 
consider that fact and jeopardizes pa-
tient access to lifesaving drugs and de-
vices, leaving physicians and patients 
with no viable alternative or an infe-
rior alternative. Would anyone want to 
be treated with an inferior alternative 
when we are unnecessarily banning the 
best treatment? I would argue no. 
Unfortunately, my commonsense, bi-
partisan, lifesaving amendment was 
not made in order. I hope this bill does 
continue to move through the legisla-
tive process and that we can work to 
address this issue. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PALLONE for yielding, and I 
thank him for his work on this piece of 
legislation, along with Mrs. DINGELL, a 
member of the committee. Obviously, 
the gentlewoman’s deceased husband 
was chairman of this committee and 
ranking member for many, many years 
and was a leader in many respects on 
addressing environmental challenges. 
This is an environmental challenge. 
There is no disagreement on that. 
There, obviously, is disagreement on 
specifics. 
The gentleman who just spoke, in a 
very knowledgeable and thoughtful 
way, said he hopes this legislation 
moves forward, but he is in opposition 
to it. I understand he does not want it 
to pass. But his comment was that, 
hopefully, this would be perfected in 
the legislative process. 
Now, I do not claim to be, Mr. Speak-
er, an expert on this chemical. I do 
know, however, that it affects my dis-
trict, and every single congressional 
district in our country is affected by 
this challenge. That is because every 
district has faced the challenge of 
PFAS contamination, which has af-
fected nearly 2,800 communities ac-
cording to an analysis by the Environ-
mental Working Group. I heard a figure 
of about 9,200 sites as well from the 
ranking member. 
Like countless other districts in the 
country, Maryland’s Fifth District, 
which I have the privilege of rep-
resenting, contamination has been de-
tected at military installations. We are 
proud of our military installations. 
Pax River is a, I think, world leading 
air test, research, and evaluation cen-
ter for naval air, as well as other air, 
including helicopters of the Army. Also 
in my district is the Naval Research 
Laboratory, Chesapeake Bay Detach-
ment. 
The citizens surrounding them are 
concerned, rightly, about what the con-
tamination may have done to the 
water they and their children drink or 
bathe in. Thankfully, the defense au-
thorization that we enacted in 2019 re-
quired our military to transition away 
from the use of PFAS chemicals in 
firefighting fluids, a major source of 
contamination. 
However, the PFAS pollution that 
has already occurred needs to be 
cleaned up, and this legislation would 
set requirements and deadlines for EPA 
to do so. Our citizens deserve to have 
that done. We must prevent PFAS 
chemicals 
from 
entering 
drinking 
water used by our communities. I 
think there is no disagreement on that. 
PFAS has been called a forever chem-
ical. Apparently, the biological fact of 
life is that it does not degrade over 
long periods of time, because they can 
linger in the human body for a whole 
lifetime, causing health effects ranging 
from cancers to reproductive and im-
mune system deficiencies. 
For 4 years, the previous administra-
tion claimed that it would take action 
through the EPA to protect Americans 
from PFAS contamination. Perhaps if 
they had done so, we wouldn’t have 
this legislation; but they did not do so. 
They failed to protect the American 
people from these harmful chemicals. 
So the committee has acted in this in-
stance and previously. 
Now it is time for Congress to act. 
Again, I am not an expert on this legis-
lation, but I do know that the com-
mittee has carefully weighed how to 
make sure that we move forward, and 
in the view of people more expert than 
I, will not preclude every chemical 
from being utilized in needed and im-
portant items that we use every day in 
our society, but will provide, because 
of the designation as a hazardous mate-
rial, that it be cleaned up where it is 
necessary to do so. 
It ensures that EPA finally takes 
measures to prevent future release of 
PFAS chemicals into our environment 
and clean them up where such contami-
nation has occurred. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to join me, not just because 
this is so important to the people liv-
ing in Maryland’s Fifth District, but 
because it is critical to all Americans 
living in each and every one of our dis-
tricts. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage the Senate 
to join us in taking this step to protect 
Americans’ access to drinking water 
and look carefully at the issues that 
have been raised by the ranking mem-
ber, legitimate issues in the sense that, 
yes, we ought to make sure that we are 
doing the right thing and that the good 
is not outweighed by the bad. 
In this instance, I think it is very 
clear that the good of this bill, the ob-
jectives of this bill, and the specifics of 
this bill, will redound to the benefit of 
the American people and each and 
every one of our communities, and I 
urge my colleagues, therefore, to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to clarify that the 
previous administration, as well as the 
current administration, has been tak-
ing several actions in connection with 
PFAS; this large group of chemicals. 
We are talking about 9,252 chemicals; 
not just one. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
WALBERG), a member of the committee 
and a problem solver. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been working to 
combat PFAS in the Great Lakes State 
that, truthfully, led the Nation in 
PFAS efforts for many years, including 
with my Michigan colleagues and spon-
sors of this bill. 
Back in 2017, we hosted EPA staff at 
several contaminated sites in south-
east Michigan so they could see first-
hand the extent of the problem. We 
formed the Congressional PFAS Task 
Force and pushed for essential re-
sources for PFAS research and cleanup 
efforts. 
Many of our efforts have, actually, 
been enacted into law during the last 
administration and countless cleanup 
efforts are currently ongoing at all lev-
els of government. In fact, over half of 
the provisions in this bill are already 
underway at EPA. 
Unfortunately, other provisions in 
this bill would require the EPA to take 
a misguided approach by considering 
the group of more than 600 PFAS cur-
rently on the market, and the thou-
sands 
of 
other 
unknown 
potential 
PFAS chemistries as if they were all 
the same. 
Make no mistake, I believe this is a 
serious problem and it deserves serious 
solutions, but the bill before us today, 
although sincerely well-intended, goes 
too far. H.R. 2467 is so expansive that 
the CBO was unable to assign it a budg-
etary score, underscoring the untold 
cost and liability that it will impose on 
thousands, if not millions of manufac-
turers and consumers alike. 
H.R. 2467 represents the largest ex-
pansion of regulatory authority at the 
EPA or perhaps any Federal agency in 
decades. But even more so, this bill 
will hamstring our small businesses, 
manufacturers, and water utilities by 
forcing them to take on so much cost 
and liability that they will be unable 
to comply or forced to raise prices and 
hire armies of attorneys all because 
Congress decided to substitute its po-
litical agenda for objective scientific 
judgment. 
The Great Lakes Water Authority re-
cently wrote to me regarding their con-
cerns about the bill. A leading drinking 
water and wastewater treatment pro-
vider for southeast Michigan commu-
nities, Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides clean drinking water to nearly 
40 percent of Michiganders. They told 
me this bill could likely cause them to 
be liable for trying to dispose of PFAS 
even if they are using current best 
practices. 
As many would say, we ought to fol-
low the science by letting the experts 
at EPA do their jobs and refrain from 
prejudging outcomes, overhauling ex-
isting regulatory structures, and most 
importantly, crippling our economy. I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’

b 1300 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DEFAZIO), the chairman of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee who has always been so co-
operative with us on both this bill and 
so many others. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding and for the 
cooperative work we have done on this 
bill, clean water bills, and many other 
issues. It is great to work with him and 
the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this legislation. The health effects 
that are known, are, you know, just a 
few things: cancer, kidney disease, 
pregnancy-related disorders, low birth 
weights, and immune system repres-
sion. But that is just what we know, so 
I guess we shouldn’t worry about this 
too much. 
Once it is in the environment, it 
breaks down. Once it is in your body, it 
doesn’t go away. You get to certain 
levels and, then, you are going to start 
having these health effects. They are 
forever chemicals. 
But, right now, there are no strin-
gent requirements to test or monitor 
for PFAS. We don’t know the extent of 
the pollution. 
This bill is critical to address this 
legacy and public health risk and put 
us on a path to addressing the perva-
sive threat to our health, our citizens, 
and our environment. 
I want to highlight a few sections 
that fall within the jurisdiction of my 
committee, the provisions which des-
ignate PFAS-related chemicals as haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, 
and 
Liability 
Act, 
CERCLA, commonly known as Super-
fund. 
We did put in a very limited exemp-
tion, which goes to firefighting at air-
ports. Right now, the foam they use 
contains PFAS, and if they follow the 
FAA rules, they won’t have liability. 
But DOD, FAA, and others are re-
searching 
alternatives 
for 
foam 
retardants, and hopefully, they won’t 
have to use this stuff in the near fu-
ture. 
There are two Clean Water Act 
amendments that will limit the addi-
tional release of PFAS; the first by the 
gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. 
PAPPAS), who has been very persistent 
on this issue, closing a Clean Water 
Act loophole for discharges. Today, 
companies can legally discharge al-
most unlimited quantities of PFAS-re-
lated chemicals into rivers, streams, 
and lakes because the EPA has not set 
limits for discharging into our aquatic 
environment. This is unacceptable. The 
gentleman’s amendment will set statu-
tory guidelines for the EPA to act and 
set those limits. 
Section 17 prioritizes the industry 
sectors with the greatest likelihood of 
discharging harmful quantities. The 
gentleman did great work on this. We 
worked with wastewater utilities and 
industry 
representatives, 
and 
they 
agree with our approach. 
I also rise in support of section 13, 
another Clean Water Act provision, by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
DELGADO), a member of my committee, 
to prevent our sewers from being 
dumping grounds. Industrial discharges 
can now be discharged into local mu-
nicipal systems, and if it is not known, 
then they can’t deal with it. They can’t 
pretreat it, and they can’t get it out. 
So, I rise in strong support of this 
bill, and I thank everyone who partici-
pated in its writing. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG), another dynamic member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. 
ARMSTRONG. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
throughout the consideration of this 
bill in committee, at Rules, and now 
here, several of my Democratic col-
leagues have argued CERCLA liability 
only attaches to two legacy chemicals, 
and we don’t have to worry about oth-
ers. Unfortunately, that is not the 
case. 
This bill requires regulatory deter-
mination on 9,250 different chemicals, 
individually or in groups, on whether 
they will be CERCLA hazardous sub-
stances. 
My colleagues argue that people 
don’t have to worry about Superfund 
liability if they don’t cause environ-
mental harm. This argument is false. 
Superfund liability is strict liability. 
If a party has any involvement, they 
are liable, period, end of story. That 
strict liability is what causes concern 
and is why Mr. BURGESS offered an 
amendment to make only those who 
cause the pollution pay for its cleanup. 
For some reason, the majority found 
issue with that amendment and pre-
vented its commonsense consideration. 
If there is interest on the other side 
of the aisle in changing the overall 
rules of Superfund liability, I am sure 
we would be happy to consider it. Short 
of that improvement, my colleagues 
should not take comfort that only 
reckless, willful, or irresponsible par-
ties will be held liable under future 
CERCLA designations. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TONKO), the chairman of the 
Environment and Climate Change Sub-
committee, who has worked very hard 
on this issue for a number of years. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for 
yielding and for his leadership on this 
bill. 
We know the health effects of PFAS 
exposure can be severe: cancer, thyroid 
problems, birth defects, and immune 
system disruptions, amongst others. 
Sadly, there are many communities 
and individuals across our great coun-
try who are suffering these health con-
sequences. 
Despite knowing the dangers of these 
forever chemicals, the Federal Govern-
ment has been slow to act. I say 
enough is enough. 
The PFAS Action Act would require 
significant steps to ensure that our 
Federal 
Government 
is 
responding 
comprehensively and reducing the risk 
of exposure through our air, water, and 
consumer products. 
It includes actions under numerous 
environmental statutes, including des-
ignating the two most well-studied 
PFAS, PFOA and PFOS, as hazardous 
substances and setting a deadline for a 
national drinking water standard to, at 
a minimum, ensure vulnerable groups, 
including pregnant women, infants, 
and children, are protected. 
The bill includes other critical provi-
sions to reduce exposure, empower con-
sumers, and expedite cleanups. 
Despite what some may want to sug-
gest, designating PFOA and PFOS as 
hazardous substances under CERCLA is 
not a ban. There are literally hundreds 
of hazardous substances that continue 
to be used in manufacturing processes 
and commerce broadly. 
What it will do is ensure that pol-
luters are held accountable to clean up 
their messes when toxic releases occur 
and ensure that remediation is done to 
an acceptable level. 
We have waited far too long already 
for action. Despite promising initial 
steps from the Biden administration, I 
fear the EPA will not adequately ad-
dress PFAS without clear direction 
from Congress. As the administration 
recognized, this bill supports the com-
mitment across the branches of govern-
ment to take on this challenge. 
This is the bill our constituents and 
those living with PFAS in their com-
munities need. 
I thank Representatives DINGELL and 
UPTON for their commitment to ad-
dressing 
these 
dangerous 
forever 
chemicals, and I encourage Members to 
support this bill. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER), 
our policy chairman and a member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 2467. 
This misguided bill treats all PFAS 
chemicals the same way, creating a de 
facto ban on many lifesaving products 
that Americans rely on. 
By voting for this bill, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are ignoring the 
science, including peer-reviewed re-
search that clearly shows that certain 
fluoropolymers, including some that 
have been used for more than 50 years, 
do not present a concern for human 
health or the environment. 
Despite this evidence, my Democrat 
colleagues have refused to make rea-
sonable changes to this bill so that 
fluoropolymer chemicals used in FDA- 
approved medical devices are not la-
beled 
hazardous 
substances 
under 
CERCLA and the Clean Air Act. 
Let me put it bluntly. By not ex-
empting the fluoropolymers used in 
medical devices already approved by

July 21, 2021 
the FDA, you are denying people access 
to lifesaving products such as heart 
valves for infants and grafts for aortic 
aneurysm repairs. 
I ask my Democrat colleagues: Are 
you so opposed to all categories of 
PFAS chemicals that you commit to 
refusing all medical devices and drugs 
containing the fluoropolymers you are 
banning? 
If you must have open-heart surgery, 
will you instruct your doctor to avoid 
using any device or surgical instru-
ment that has fluoropolymers regard-
less of the implications for the out-
come? 
If your child or grandchild needs an 
FDA-approved heart valve, do you com-
mit to denying them that care since it 
contains fluoropolymers? 
That is what you are trying to force 
on the general population with this 
legislation. 
Furthermore, this bill will put mil-
lions of Americans who have already 
received medical devices containing 
fluoropolymers at risk. As noted in 
committee by my colleague, Dr. LARRY 
BUCSHON, with the passage of this bill, 
the FDA might have to designate all 
devices with any fluoropolymers as 
hazardous and recall them. 
There is bipartisan agreement on the 
need to protect the public from harm-
ful PFAS chemicals, but there is no ra-
tional 
reason 
why 
lifesaving 
fluoropolymers could not be exempted. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), who is the 
sponsor of the bill and who has really 
brought our attention to this issue and 
prioritized it from the very beginning. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for being such a strong 
leader and getting us to where we are 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
here in support of this very important 
piece of bipartisan legislation, which I 
am leading with my good friend and 
colleague, Representative FRED UPTON. 
This is a meaningful bill that is the 
product of good bipartisan work by the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. It 
passed the House with strong bipar-
tisan support in the last Congress, and 
it is an example that bipartisanship 
does exist on Capitol Hill. This bill em-
bodies it, and today’s vote will once 
again validate that. 
PFAS chemicals are an urgent threat 
to public health. This class of man-
made chemicals is extremely persistent 
in the environment and has long been 
linked with adverse health effects, in-
cluding cancer. 
These chemicals were birthed out of 
the Manhattan Project, and, now, near-
ly every American, almost every Amer-
ican, has PFAS coursing through their 
blood after generations of use of these 
drugs in our modern society. 
The EPA has understood the risks 
posed by PFAS since 1998. The Defense 
Department has understood the risks 
since the 1970s. The FDA has under-
stood the risks since the 1960s. And in-
dustry has known about the dangers 
for decades. 
But we still do not have a strong 
Federal policy to combat these forever 
chemicals, which are a crisis. We have 
yet to set a national drinking water 
standard for PFAS that our water util-
ities need to meet. We have yet to des-
ignate them as hazardous substances 
under Superfund to jump-start cleanup. 
We have yet to regulate industrial dis-
charges of PFAS into our water and 
our air. And we have yet to establish 
simple labeling that PFAS is in a prod-
uct to allow consumers to protect 
themselves. 
This can all change if we pass the 
PFAS Action Act. 
According 
to 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group, over 200 million Amer-
icans are drinking water now contami-
nated with PFAS, and we are finding 
more and more contamination regu-
larly. Just today, the Environmental 
Working Group reported that PFAS 
have been detected in 2,800 commu-
nities, including 2,411 drinking water 
systems, and at 328 military installa-
tions nationwide. 
Listen to me: The Pentagon is not 
going to prioritize cleanup of these 
military sites until these chemicals are 
listed as the hazardous substances that 
they are. 
I want to be clear: I love my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
but there is nothing in this bill that 
would ban PFAS used in drugs, medical 
devices, or PPE. It will not ban masks. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
bill. It is time we protect Americans. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW), another member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee and a deco-
rated Navy SEAL. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to highlight a dangerous im-
plication of this bill and urge my col-
leagues to vote against it. 
There is no disagreement that the 
Federal Government has a role to play 
in cleaning up the most heavily con-
taminated sites and establishing stand-
ards so that our water is safe to drink. 
We are united in this, both Republicans 
and Democrats. 
While this bill shares the spirit of 
that, frankly, it got hopelessly lost 
along the way. Instead, it creates a 
mess of lawsuits. 
We could have fixed this. Republicans 
have pointed out the pitfalls. Demo-
crats say those pitfalls don’t exist. Ex-
perts say, yes, they do. We could fix 
this. 
b 1315 
In committee we discussed how this 
impacts a full suite of products, from 
medical devices to computer chips. 
But there is one element that is par-
ticularly concerning to me. Under this 
legislation, a police department that 
purchases one of the most popular bul-
letproof vests to protect its officers 
against rising crime would now be sub-
ject to environmental lawsuits. 
And here’s why: A bulletproof vest 
becomes increasingly ineffective if it is 
exposed to moisture. As a result, it is 
protected by a waterproofing PFAS 
chemical to keep it dry and effective 
against bullets. 
By imposing a de facto ban—and it is 
a de facto ban—on all PFAS chemicals, 
even those that pose no risk to human 
health or the environment, this legisla-
tion will significantly reduce the avail-
ability of lifesaving equipment. 
Manufacturers, or others in the sup-
ply chain, will seek to avoid the PFAS 
liabilities created by this bill under 
CERCLA. So police departments, rath-
er than worrying about protecting our 
communities, will now have to worry 
about whether or not they will be sub-
ject to an environmental lawsuit. 
Instead, police departments them-
selves will be forced to make impos-
sible 
decisions; 
continuing 
to 
use 
PFAS-containing, lifesaving equipment 
or risk huge legal liability when the 
equipment is disposed of. 
This bill will bring entities like po-
lice departments, and anyone and ev-
eryone who is even remotely involved 
with PFAS material, under the wide 
dragnet of litigation that they don’t 
have the resources to fight. 
As Democrats seek to defund police 
across the country, police departments 
are already strapped for cash. So under 
this bill, we are forcing police depart-
ments to decide whether to defend 
themselves against lawsuits or pur-
chase the material they need to keep 
their officers safe. 
That is why I introduced a simple 
amendment that would limit the liabil-
ity of police departments, first re-
sponders, and our military from being 
endlessly sued if they require these ma-
terials to protect themselves. 
My 
amendment 
didn’t 
limit 
the 
EPA’s ability to actually regulate 
these chemicals or even determine 
which ones are safe or unsafe. Nor did 
it allow police departments to dispose 
of these products in an unsafe way and 
be shielded from consequences. 
It just said, if a police department or 
first responder follows the letter of the 
law in dealing with these materials, 
they shouldn’t be threatened with end-
less lawsuits. But, sadly, my colleagues 
didn’t make my amendment in order. 
So while my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are desperately trying 
to prove that they support our police 
officers after a year of demonizing 
them, the bill shows that really noth-
ing has changed. 
But there is one more chance to 
make this right. I will be offering my 
amendment as the motion to recommit 
for this legislation. Our police officers 
need to know that Congress has their 
back, especially now. This motion to 
recommit is a chance to do just that. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this bill and vote for my amendment to 
protect our police and our military and 
our first responders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3779 
July 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2467, the 
PFAS Action Act. 
PFAS compounds do not naturally 
break down in the environment. Expo-
sure to even small amounts of PFAS 
has been linked to diseases, birth de-
fects, and developmental disorders. 
These chemicals have been used in 
consumer products for decades and 
have, thus, been allowed to spread and 
accumulate throughout the environ-
ment, into our air, our water, and our 
soils. 
In my own district, PFAS has been 
detected in multiple drinking water 
systems, which puts the health and 
safety of my constituents at risk. The 
same can be said for millions of people 
in communities across the country. 
Until recently, the extent of the 
problem was underestimated in my 
home State. With expanded testing, we 
now know that California is one of the 
most impacted States in the country. 
A recent investigation by the State 
Water Resources Control Board showed 
PFAS contamination in almost 100 
public water systems serving about 7.5 
million Californians. 
We need a national strategy to pre-
vent exposure to these toxic sub-
stances. This bill sets a deadline for 
the EPA to take action on establishing 
standards, limits the introduction of 
new PFAS into commerce and the envi-
ronment, and provides support for com-
munities to install treatment tech-
nologies. This bill is needed both to 
clean up pollution now and to prevent 
it from getting worse in the future. 
I want to thank Representative DIN-
GELL
and Representative UPTON
for 
their leadership on H.R. 2467 and Chair-
man PALLONE, Chairman TONKO, for 
helping to move this important legisla-
tion. I also want to thank the com-
mittee staff for their work on this bill. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE), a physician and member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 
2467, the PFAS Action Act. This bill 
takes the wrong approach to dealing 
with these complex and complicated 
chemicals. 
A de facto ban on all PFAS sub-
stances will do nothing but prevent se-
cure disposal of existing chemicals and 
harm innovation of new, safer prod-
ucts. 
As a physician, I have personally 
seen the benefits provided by these 
products. PFAS materials have a vari-
ety of uses in healthcare, ranging from 
heart valves, cardiac stents, to coat-
ings on contact lenses. 
Thanks 
to 
technology 
developed 
using PFAS materials, surgeries, such 
as those that are needed to repair a 
child’s congenital heart defect, no 
longer require risky open-heart surgery 
and can simply be done through the 
arm. 
Of course, we don’t want dangerous 
chemicals in our water supply. But to 
outright ban an entire family of prod-
ucts is not the answer. We would not 
ban the entire periodic table because it 
includes arsenic and mercury. We need 
a 
science-grounded, 
risk-based 
ap-
proach that identifies the most harm-
ful chemicals and treats them as such, 
rather than have Congress regulate the 
entire family as a single group. 
Inclusion in the Comprehensive Envi-
ronmental 
Response, 
Compensation, 
and Liability Act has the potential to 
slow down the cleanup process of 
PFAS, divert resources from current 
higher-priority public health issues and 
create another unfunded mandate for 
critical public utilities and local gov-
ernments. 
Instead of interfering, it is time to 
let government agencies do their work. 
And so I urge my colleagues, join me, 
vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2467. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who chairs 
the House Select Committee on the 
Climate Crisis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act. 
These PFAS chemicals, synthetic, 
manmade chemicals, have now, accord-
ing to the science, evolved into a very 
significant public health threat, and it 
is time that Congress act to protect 
our neighbors back home, families, 
communities all across America with 
the passage of this bill. 
This is a bipartisan bill, and I want 
to thank my colleagues, Congress-
woman 
DINGELL
and 
Congressman 
UPTON, for leading the charge here, be-
cause what they propose and what we 
will vote on today will protect our 
communities by instituting some new 
oversight and regulations of these for-
ever chemicals in PFAS, help us clean 
up these chemicals from our drinking 
water, and protect the public health. 
These PFAS chemicals are not regu-
lated in any way right now. They are 
often used in firefighting foam, in 
nonstick surfaces, stain-resistant sur-
faces, and food packaging. The Agency 
for Toxic Substances and Disease Reg-
istry has determined that PFAS expo-
sure is associated with low birth 
weight babies, an increased rate of can-
cer, lower fertility rates, and develop-
mental issues in young children and in-
fants. 
A new study out of the Yale School 
of Public Health recently found that 
exposure increases the risk of mis-
carriage by 80 to 120 percent in preg-
nant women. The CDC also issued a dis-
closure regarding a potential intersec-
tion between PFAS and COVID–19. 
These chemicals now have been de-
tected in communities all across the 
country. This bill will help us rely on 
the science, provide some safeguards, 
make sure we are gathering the sci-
entific data we need to keep our com-
munities safe back home. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, most 
folks have never heard of PFAS. In 
Michigan we found out the hard way. 
Again. 
Sadly, we know a little bit about 
water 
contamination. 
Think 
Flint, 
think lead. PFAS is bad, too. Really 
bad. 
The EPA has been slow at the switch. 
Three years ago, I stepped off the plane 
coming back from D.C. for the August 
break, and I got a call. It was bad. It 
was from one of my State senators. 
One of my towns had been identified 
just a few hours earlier with having 
alarming PFAS parts per trillion num-
bers. 
We had to act right away. I drove 
straight to the sheriff command center, 
prompted the immediate notification 
of thousands of residents. It was nearly 
midnight. Before they could make in-
fant formula or coffee in the morning 
or even water their vegetable garden, 
they had to stop. They had to unplug 
their icemakers in their refrigerators. 
For months they had to line up at 
churches and schools to get cases of 
water for human consumption. 
We had a bipartisan bill to require 
the EPA to set a minimum standard 
for PFOA and PFAS, which House Re-
publicans agreed to, but we were later 
denied. It would have started the 
EPA’s clock, which is why we need to 
act now. 
We know this stuff is bad. We know 
this causes cancer. This bill is not per-
fect. It needs to see a number of con-
structive changes before it reaches the 
President’s desk, but I want to thank 
DAN KILDEE and BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
the two co-chairs of the bipartisan 
Congressional PFAS Task Force. 
I want to thank Chairman PALLONE. I 
also want to thank my colleague 
DEBBIE DINGELL for authoring this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time remains on

July 21, 2021 
from the majority of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, with the excep-
tion of my good friend Mr. UPTON, is 
that they just want a little more toxic 
chemicals in your water. 
That simply cannot be true. 
In my district on Long Island, we 
have long struggled with PFAS water 
contamination, and many communities 
have already incurred substantial re-
mediation costs. 
That is why I am pleased that the 
PFAS Action Act includes my provi-
sion to reimburse these local commu-
nities for their past expenses. Commu-
nities that could not wait for Federal 
action and redirected their resources to 
address this health threat should not 
be punished for doing the right thing. 
This is a situation that the Federal 
Government has failed to address for 
decades. We have the opportunity to do 
it now. 
I want to thank my good friends, 
Representatives DINGELL
and UPTON, 
and the chairman of the committee for 
bringing this commonsense bill to the 
floor. I urge my colleagues to support 
it. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN), a leader on the Natural 
Resources Committee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2467, 
but not necessarily in defense or in cri-
tique of PFAS. 
Unfortunately, this legislation puts 
the cart before the horse. It would es-
tablish a PFAS standard before the 
EPA has the information to determine 
the best regulatory action. 
While written and passed by the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, this 
bill contains provisions within the ju-
risdiction of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, of which I 
am also a member. However, T&I never 
considered this bill, which greatly con-
cerns me. Our committee didn’t hold 
one hearing or one markup on this bill 
or on the provisions contained in it. 
T&I Democrats completely ceded the 
committee’s authority and expertise. 
b 1330 
If we had held a hearing or a markup, 
Republicans would have pointed out 
that the Clean Water Act, which is 
squarely in the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, grants ample authority to 
the EPA and contains a long-estab-
lished process for evaluating chemicals 
and regulating the discharge of those 
substances when they pose a signifi-
cant risk to water quality. 
We would have noted that the EPA 
already has efforts under way to evalu-
ate PFAS substances pursuant to the 
Clean Water Act, including managing 
risks from PFAS. 
However, this bill short-circuits the 
long-established 
regulatory 
review 
process under the Clean Water Act and 
it ignores the expertise of the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee. 
H.R. 2467 imposes unrealistic dead-
lines on the EPA and asks the EPA to 
regulate before it has the necessary 
data to make a legally and scientif-
ically sound regulatory plan. 
Legislating in this careless fashion 
undermines the confidence in both the 
bill and the legislative process to de-
velop it. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, and I 
encourage us to continue looking at 
this issue. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the PFAS Action Act 
of 2021 because this overdue legislation 
will save lives. 
We know that PFAS chemicals, oth-
erwise known as forever chemicals, 
have been linked to harmful health ef-
fects, including increased rates of can-
cer. 
Yet, for far too long, they have been 
unchecked and unregulated. 
Now, these same chemicals are being 
discovered at toxic levels in drinking 
water supplies in communities that I 
represent and across our country. 
In fact, as many as 200 million Amer-
icans are currently drinking PFAS- 
contaminated 
water, 
often 
without 
even knowing it. 
While my home State of Massachu-
setts has led the way in responding to 
PFAS contaminations in recent years, 
including the groundbreaking of a new 
10,000-square foot treatment plant in 
my district in Littleton, most States 
are falling further and further behind, 
leaving their residents at risk. 
Madam Speaker, we have the ability 
to change that today. 
Passage of the PFAS Action Act will 
bolster State and local initiatives like 
those already under way in Massachu-
setts. 
This legislation will provide the re-
sources and policies necessary to clean 
up contaminated drinking water sites, 
support families who have been exposed 
to PFAS chemicals, and take critical 
steps to prevent future exposures. 
I am grateful to Representatives DIN-
GELL and UPTON, as well as our chair-
man of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, Mr. PALLONE, for their bipar-
tisan work on this issue. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, not because it will hurt 
corporations who want to continue the 
unregulated use of these dangerous 
chemicals, but because the health and 
well-being of the hardworking families 
they represent are at stake if they 
don’t. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
COMER), the lead Republican on the 
Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the PFAS Action Act. 
As the ranking member of the House 
Oversight and Reform Committee, I 
have participated in many hours of 
hearings during the previous Congress 
where we explored issues involving 
PFAS materials and heard from wit-
nesses spanning many perspectives on 
this important issue. 
As legislation and regulations are ad-
vanced to address PFAS issues, it is 
critical that we ensure that these ef-
forts define the chemicals of concern 
consistently, adequately, and properly 
as supported by sound science. In the 
current bill, however, what is ulti-
mately classified as a PFAS material 
is either left open to interpretation by 
EPA or broadly defined. Using either 
approach risks subjecting potentially 
thousands of chemicals to unnecessary 
regulation or restriction. 
As we have heard previously in the 
House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, and as we have heard on the 
floor this week during debate on var-
ious amendments, a broad definition of 
PFAS could subject such key products 
as lithium-ion batteries, semiconduc-
tors, refrigerants, and medical devices, 
to name just a few, to regulation and 
restriction. All these products provide 
important benefits, and some, in the 
case of batteries and semiconductors, 
have been specifically highlighted by 
President Biden as part of his efforts to 
review and reshore critical supply 
chains. 
It is, therefore, essential that we 
properly define PFAS, so that imple-
menting regulations can focus on those 
materials, such as PFOA and PFOS, 
where there is scientific consensus for 
regulation, while also ensuring that 
unnecessary regulations are not placed 
on key uses of PFAS. 
I urge my colleagues to carefully 
consider the definitions and criteria 
that are being put forward as the basis 
for PFAS regulation and to take steps 
to ensure that these classifications are 
carefully tailored and supported by 
sound science. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak on this issue. And still I rise. 
And I rise today because, as a Mem-
ber of Congress, I believe we have a 
duty, a responsibility, and an obliga-
tion to act when industry is not acting, 
and the health of the American people 
is at risk. 
It is time for Congress to do what it 
should have done, what EPA has not 
done, what we can do. I believe that 
there is no option but to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
No is not an option when it comes to 
the health and safety of the American 
people. 
I will vote ‘‘yes.’’ I will vote for the 
American people and their safety. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS). 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for his leadership on this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3781 
July 21, 2021 
I rise in support of the PFAS Action 
Act, a landmark bill that will protect 
millions of Americans from these toxic 
forever chemicals. 
We know PFAS persists in the envi-
ronment and the human body, and it is 
making our constituents sick. This leg-
islation addresses legacy contamina-
tion and its associated health effects. 
Importantly, this bill will also go to 
the source, and halt active contamina-
tion and work to hold polluters ac-
countable. 
That is exactly what my provision is 
designed to do. This legislation in-
cludes my bill, the Clean Water Stand-
ards for PFAS Act, which addresses 
toxic PFAS discharges and invests in 
local infrastructure. 
No polluter should be able to dump 
PFAS unchecked into our waterways 
and 
into 
our 
wastewater 
systems. 
PFAS should be handled like other 
toxic substances that have been regu-
lated through the Clean Water Act. 
We must also support wastewater 
systems to make necessary infrastruc-
ture upgrades that will stop PFAS 
from poisoning our environment and 
our water. This bill would authorize 
$200 million a year for these grants. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan 
issue, and it is an issue that literally 
affects every State and every district 
across this country. 
Just yesterday I joined a round table 
of concerned leaders in my district 
whose message was crystal clear: Pass 
this bill and protect the health and 
well-being of our communities and our 
families. 
I heard from the town manager in 
Bedford, New Hampshire, who spoke to 
me about residents receiving bottled 
water for the past 3 years because their 
wells are contaminated. Families and 
businesses in several neighboring com-
munities face the same situation. How 
many more years are we going to let 
these people wait for clean water? 
A constituent of mine named Lisa, 
from the Seacoast region of New Hamp-
shire, has two kids who drank PFAS- 
laced water for a number of years when 
they were growing up. They faced a 
number of unimaginable health im-
pacts as a result of that. 
How many more households like 
Lisa’s will there be in this particular 
situation if we allow more PFAS out 
into the environment? 
Far too many Americans are drink-
ing from contaminated systems and 
wells. Far too many Americans are at 
the mercy of industrial polluters and 
have brought this problem to our door-
step. 
I urge passage of this bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Unfortunately, this bill is not just 
limited to legacy contamination. It 
creates a hostile environment for the 
manufacture and use of PFAS, present 
and future. 
The ban in this bill is a de facto ban 
on 9,252 PFAS, as well as numerous 
lifesaving and critical products con-
taining PFAS. 
A de facto ban is a system where 
many suppliers of a product are al-
lowed, but the environment is so com-
pletely hostile to its existence, that 
the product might as well not be made. 
The aggressive, unscientific regu-
latory approach in this bill, coupled 
with its extremely limited exemptions, 
will create stigma and uncertainty, 
and that will result in increased litiga-
tion in trial courts for products con-
taining PFAS. 
If you start stacking up the negative 
market pressures created through: 
One, increased compliance costs; 
Two, limited disposal options; 
Three, sidelined investments; 
Four, unquantifiable and permanent 
liability under CERCLA; 
Five, tort lawsuits aided by legisla-
tive stigma; 
Six, marketplace challenges; 
Seven, the inability to make or fi-
nance a safer replacement chemical or 
product, it is not hard to see how H.R. 
2467 creates a de facto ban on 9,252 
chemicals and threatens the viability 
of these industries and the industries 
that need them and the products con-
taining them that benefit our society. 
Unfortunately, this is not a new tac-
tic. It has been done before with the 
war on coal under the Obama adminis-
tration, and now we are seeing it with 
the rest of fossil fuels and any product 
that some decide they don’t like. 
The word ‘‘ban’’ may not appear, but 
by creating massive costs through reg-
ulatory barriers and mandates, uncer-
tainty, and taxes, a de facto ban is cre-
ated by the cost of doing business. The 
cost of doing business becomes too high 
and we, as Americans, become depend-
ent upon other countries, dangerously 
dependent upon other countries. It 
jeopardizes manufacturing in our coun-
try, and then we wonder why people are 
not 
manufacturing 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
It has been done on coal, it has been 
done on fossil fuels, and today it is 
being done on American manufactur-
ers. 
We can do better. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Let’s 
go back, let’s do better. We all want to 
protect clean drinking water. That is a 
shared goal. Let’s stay focused on that 
goal. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This comprehensive bill reflects the 
hard work of many of my colleagues. I 
want to thank some of the leaders in 
the House who have made this bill pos-
sible. 
Representative DINGELL has led this 
bill for several years now, never losing 
sight of the communities she rep-
resents who have been impacted by 
PFAS in their environment and in 
their water. 
The bill builds on legislation from 
Representative SEAN PATRICK MALONEY 
to require health effects testing on all 
PFAS chemicals. This critical testing 
forms the basis of required decisions 
throughout this package. 
The legislation also sets a morato-
rium on new PFAS until EPA has the 
science it needs to properly evaluate 
them and will ensure that all new 
PFAS are properly reviewed before 
going forward. This provision was au-
thored and led through the committee 
process by Representative KUSTER and 
also reflects the hard work of Rep-
resentative DEAN. 
Another essential piece of this bill 
builds on bipartisan legislation from 
Representatives 
BOYLE
and 
FITZPATRICK to set a national drinking 
water standard that protects public 
health, including the health of preg-
nant women, infants, and children. 
The legislation also takes important 
steps to address air emissions of PFAS. 
It incorporates legislation from Rep-
resentative STEVENS to address PFAS 
emissions under the Clean Air Act and 
legislation 
from 
Representatives 
KHANNA and LEVIN to restrict unsafe 
incineration of PFAS wastes, including 
firefighting foam. 
Next, the bill includes a provision by 
Representative SOTO to create a volun-
tarily PFAS-free label for cookware, so 
consumers can take steps to protect 
themselves from exposure. I also thank 
Representative SLOTKIN for her work to 
expand that label. 
The bill includes a provision by Rep-
resentative FLETCHER requiring EPA to 
issue guidance for first responders to 
both minimize the use of PFAS in fire-
fighting foam and turnout gear and 
also minimize their risks. That provi-
sion was improved last year with input 
from Representative GOLDEN. Risks to 
first responders are also a very serious 
concern, and I thank Representative 
FLETCHER for her work on that impor-
tant issue. 
Lastly, the bill incorporates two pro-
visions related to the Clean Water Act 
from Representatives DELGADO
and 
PAPPAS. Those important provisions 
will protect our natural resources and 
stem the flow of contamination into 
our waterways. 
Madam Speaker, I include the fol-
lowing documents in the RECORD: A 
letter from the Sierra Club; a letter 
from the United States Conference of 
Catholic Bishops; a letter from the Co-
alition of NGO’s; a letter from Defense 
Communities; a letter from the League 
of Conservation Voters; and an article 
from Environmental Health News ti-
tled: ‘‘The real story behind PFAS and 
Congress’ effort to clean up contamina-
tion.’’ That is an op-ed.

July 21, 2021 
support of H.R. 2467 the PFAS Action Act of 
2021. We ask that you vote in support of this 
critical package and strengthening amend-
ments. 
Communities around the United States are 
facing grave threats to their drinking water 
and health due to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl 
Substances (PFAS). This class of chemicals 
is widely used to make carpets, fabrics for 
furniture, Teflon coatings for cookware, 
paper packaging for food and other everyday 
materials. They’re even used in firefighting 
foam (aqueous film forming foam; AFFF) for 
both civilian and military purposes. 
PFAS chemicals can’t be broken down in 
an environment and effectively poison water 
sources. Right now, scientists estimate that 
more than 100 million Americans are drink-
ing PFAS-contaminated water. This con-
tamination is strongly linked to cancer, im-
mune system suppression, thyroid problems, 
reproductive system damage and harming of 
children’s growth and development. 
The PFAS Action Act takes critical steps 
in ensuring our communities are protected 
from dangerous chemicals. There are 9 im-
portant amendments that extend important 
protections against PFAS chemicals. How-
ever, two stand out as critical in dealing 
with PFAS contamination. First, Rep. Andy 
Levin’s Amendment #8 to prohibit inciner-
ation of PFAS-based firefighting foams. Sec-
ond, Rep. Sarbanes and Fitzpatrick’s Amend-
ment #15 which would require chemical com-
panies to provide the analytical standards 
that allow chemists to measure new PFAS 
chemicals in people and the environment. 
Everyone, no matter zip code, gender or 
race, deserves clean drinking water and a 
healthy environment. We must safeguard 
frontline communities from the damage of 
PFAS. We need to stop emitting PFAS into 
the environment and protect those popu-
lations most susceptible to chemical con-
tamination—like women, children and mili-
tary service members. The PFAS Action Act 
is an important step in that process. 
Sierra Club urges you to support the PFAS 
Action Act. 
Sincerely, 
MICHAEL BRUNE, 
Executive Director, Sierra Club. 
UNITED STATES CONFERENCE 
OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS, 
Washington, DC, July 19, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
United 
States 
Conference 
of 
Catholic 
Bishops (USCCB) Committee on Domestic 
Justice and Human Development and Com-
mittee on Pro-Life Activities, we write in 
support of the PFAS Action Act of 2021 (H.R. 
2467). This bipartisan legislation aims to re-
duce human and environmental exposure to 
toxic chemicals. 
Per-fluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) are a diverse class of com-
pounds containing thousands of individual 
chemicals. Useful for non-stick and water-re-
pellent properties, certain PFAS have been 
integrated into numerous household prod-
ucts. PFAS have also been employed in fire-
fighting foam across the United States. 
PFAS are resistant to degradation and bio-
accumulate in the environment and the 
human body. Prolonged exposure to these 
chemicals can cause cancer, thyroid prob-
lems, birth defects, and reproductive, devel-
opmental, and immune system disruptions. 
Of particular concern is a growing body of 
research that indicates pregnant and nursing 
mothers, and their children, are especially 
affected. Such exposure occurs through pol-
luted drinking water, food, soil, dust and the 
use of consumer products manufactured 
using PFAS. The widespread utilization of 
these ‘‘forever chemicals’’ has resulted in 
significant environmental contamination. 
The USCCB has consistently promoted in-
tegral human development, where tech-
nology and human ingenuity are directed to-
wards the common good. Human and envi-
ronmental 
health 
concerns 
are 
inter-
connected, and we must not forget that 
‘‘human life is itself a gift which must be de-
fended from various forms of debasement’’ 
(Laudato Si’, no. 5). The PFAS Action Act of 
2021 both upholds the dignity of human life 
and preserves ecological health. It regulates 
PFAS, enacts drinking water standards, and 
designates contaminated sites as eligible for 
Superfund cleanup. 
Access to safe, potable water is an indis-
pensable human right and government lead-
ers have a moral responsibility to safeguard 
society from poisonous chemical contamina-
tions. Addressing U.S. Congress in 2015, Pope 
Francis declared that ‘‘you are called to de-
fend and preserve the dignity of your fellow 
citizens in the tireless and demanding pur-
suit of the common good.’’ We pray for your 
efforts to protect the life and health of 
mothers, the unborn, all of society, and 
God’s creation.

OF
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: On behalf of our 
millions of members and supporters, the un-
dersigned non-governmental organizations 
write today to urge you to vote YES on H.R. 
2467, the PFAS Action Act. 
Toxic PFAS chemicals have now been con-
firmed in the water of nearly 2800 commu-
nities, including over 300 military installa-
tions, and studies have linked PFAS to seri-
ous health problems, including cancer. H.R. 
2467 will build on the progress made in the 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY 
2020 by restricting industrial releases of 
PFAS into our air and water, setting a 
drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS 
in tap water, and by kick-starting the proc-
ess of cleaning up legacy PFAS contamina-
tion by designating PFOA and PFOS as haz-
ardous substances under the federal Super-
fund law. 
The science is clear: PFAS have been 
linked to serious health problems through 
decades of animal, worker, and human stud-
ies. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to take 
steps to restrict air and water releases, re-
duce PFAS in our tap water, or clean up the 
nation’s most contaminated sites. H.R. 2467 
will set clear deadlines requiring EPA to do 
just that. Designating PFOA and PFOS as 
hazardous substances, as proposed by H.R. 
2467, will not ban PFAS—but will instead en-
sure that the most contaminated sites are fi-
nally cleaned up. 
We urge you to vote YES on H.R. 2467, the 
PFAS Action Act.

PROTECT OUR DEFENSE COMMUNITIES FROM 
PFAS POLLUTION—DESIGNATE
PFOA AND 
PFOS AS HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES 
JULY 20, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: Our communities 
host many of the hundreds of military in-
stallations that are now contaminated with 
the toxic ‘‘forever chemicals’’ known as 
PFAS. While Congress has acted to end the 
use of firefighting foam made with PFAS, 
Congress has not yet taken steps to ensure 
that legacy PFAS pollution is cleaned up. 
To protect our defense communities from 
toxic pollution, we urge you to designate 
PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Liability, and Compensation Act. 
Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous 
substances under CERCLA will ensure that 
the Defense Department treats PFAS pollu-
tion at military installations as a priority. 
Some members of Congress have argued 
that designating PFOA and PFOS as ‘‘haz-
ardous substances’’ under CERCLA will ban 
the use of these two chemicals from medical 
devices, semiconductors, lithium batteries 
and even surgical masks. This is not correct. 
First, PFOA and PFOS are no longer used in 
commerce. Second, designation of a chemical 
as a hazardous substance does not result in a 
ban of the chemical. Nearly 80 percent of the 
chemicals designated as hazardous sub-
stances are still used in commerce. 
CERCLA regulates the cleanup of chemi-
cals, not the use of chemicals. In particular, 
designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous 
substances under CERCLA will ensure that 
they are a priority for clean up at military

PFAS has been confirmed in the ground-

Re: Support H.R. 2467, a critical step in pro-
tecting our health from toxic chemicals. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, The League of Con-
servation Voters (LCV) works to turn envi-
ronmental values into national priorities. 
Each year, LCV publishes the National Envi-
ronmental Scorecard, which details the vot-
ing records of members of Congress on envi-
ronmental legislation. The Scorecard is the 
nationally accepted yardstick used to rate 
members of Congress on environmental, pub-
lic health, and energy issues and is distrib-
uted to LCV members, concerned voters, and 
the media. 
LCV urges you to vote YES on H.R. 2467, 
the ‘‘PFAS Action Act of 2021,’’ which would 
take important steps in addressing the grow-
ing national PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances) crisis threatening the health of 
millions of people across the country. 
PFAS are a class of chemicals used in 
many everyday consumer products and in-
dustrial applications to make water and 
stain repellant coatings, but communities 
continue to discover that their drinking 
water, food, soil, and surroundings have been 
contaminated with PFAS. Also called ‘‘for-
ever chemicals’’ in recognition of their per-
sistence in the environment and our bodies, 
PFAS have been linked to numerous health 
problems like certain cancers, thyroid dis-
ease, neurological development issues, weak-
ened immune systems, and more. The federal 
government has been slow to take the ac-
tions necessary to protect our communities, 
especially communities of color who bear a 
disproportionate impact from this lack of re-
sponse. 
H.R. 2467 will take critical steps forward 
that are needed to reduce PFAS use, clean 
them up, and hold polluters accountable for 
the damage to our health and the environ-
ment. The bill would require the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a 
drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS 
within two years, designate PFOA and PFOS 
as hazardous air pollutants, limit industrial 
discharges of PFAS into waterways, and pro-
vide funding for water treatment. Addition-
ally, it would provide consumers with knowl-
edge of products containing PFAS by adding 
PFAS to the EPA’s Safer Choice Program. 
H.R. 2467 also would designate PFOA and 
PFOS as hazardous substances and make a 
determination on other PFAS within five 
years—key to holding polluters accountable 
and ensuring that our nation’s most con-
taminated sites are finally cleaned up. 
Again. we urge you to SUPPORT H.R. 2467, 
which will take critical steps in tackling the 
PF AS crisis, as well as all pro-environment 
amendments. We will strongly consider in-
cluding votes on this legislation in the 2021 
Scorecard. If you need more information, 
please contact a member of our government 
relations team. 
Sincerely, 
GENE KARPINSKI, 
President. 
ENVIRONMENTAL
HEALTH
SCIENCES—THE 
REAL STORY BEHIND PFAS AND CONGRESS’ 
EFFORT TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATION: OP- 
ED BY JIM JONES 
Former EPA official Jim Jones sets the 
record straight on ‘the forever chemical’ as 
lawmakers take up the PFAS Action Act 
Jim Jones 
When the U.S. House of Representatives 
takes up the bipartisan PFAS Action Act 
this week, some members of Congress may 
contend that the bill would ban some uses of 
PFAS. 
In particular, some members of Congress 
may argue that designating PFOA and PFOS 
as ‘‘hazardous substances’’ under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, Liabil-
ity, and Compensation Act, or CERCLA, will 
ban the use of these two chemicals from 
medical devices, semiconductors, lithium 
batteries and even surgical masks. 
This is not correct. 
PFAS & PFOS NO LONGER USED IN COMMERCE 
First, PFOA and PFOS are no longer used 
in commerce. 
As an Assistant Administrator for the 
EPA, I was involved in the implementation 
of a 2006 stewardship agreement with the 
chemical industry to phase out the use of 
these 
two 
members 
of 
this 
class 
of 
fluorinated chemicals. Simply put, as a re-
sult of this agreement, PFOA and PFOS are 
no longer used in these products or take 
make these products. 
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE 
Second, designation of a chemical as a haz-
ardous substance does not result in a ban of 
the chemical. 
A quick review of EPA records reveals that 
nearly 80 percent of the chemicals des-
ignated as hazardous substances by Congress 
since the law was passed in 1980 are still used 
in commerce. That’s because CERCLA does 
not force manufacturers to stop using chemi-
cals. Sulfuric acid, one of the most widely 
used chemicals in commerce, has been des-
ignated as a hazardous substance for more 
than 40 years. Many other chemicals des-
ignated as hazardous substances are used in 
many products, including medical devices. 
CERCLA regulates the cleanup of chemi-
cals, not the use of chemicals. A different 
statute, the Toxic Substances Control Act, 
or TSCA, governs the use of chemicals. 
CRITICAL STEP TO CLEAN UP PFAS & PFOA 
Simply put, no one—not Congress, not the 
states, not the EPA—is trying to ban PFOA 
and PFOS by statute. 
So, if Congress is not trying to ban PFOA 
and PFOS, why then does the bipartisan 
PFAS Action Act designate them as haz-
ardous substances? 
Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous 
substances is a critical step in efforts to ac-
celerate the clean-up process at contami-
nated sites, especially Department of De-
fense installations. 
FIREFIGHTING FOAM CONTAMINATION 
PFAS has been confirmed in the ground-
water at more than 300 military installations 
where firefighting foams made with PFAS 
were used. Congress directed the DOD to end 
the use of these PFAS-based foams in 2020, 
but efforts to clean up legacy contamination 
at these bases has not yet been undertaken. 
Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous 
substances will ensure that the DOD treats 
these contaminants as a priority for cleanup.

That’s not only reason Congress should 
enact the PFAS Action Act. While EPA is 
now treating PFAS as a priority, that has 
not always been the case. To guard against 
delay, the PFAS Action Act sets deadlines 
for EPA to finalize a national drinking water 
standard for PFOA and PFOS and to place 
limits on discharges of PFAS into the air 
and water. The bill also sets a deadline for 
EPA to decide whether or not to list other 
PFAS as hazardous substances. 
PFAS: TIME TO TAKE ACTION 
A lot is at stake. PFAS has been detected 
in thousands of drinking water systems and 
has been linked to serious health problems. 
No wonder chemical companies and public 
health groups agree that it is time to take 
action to address PFAS pollution. Hopefully, 
members of Congress will agree as well. 
PFAS: WHO TO CALL 
Editors note: The PFAS Action Act of 2021, 
by Rep. Debbie Dingell, D–Mich., is set to be 
debated by the U.S. House of Representatives 
sometime this week. 
To set the record straight and voice con-
cern that the latest science is not being con-
sidered as lawmakers debate effort to clean 
up our environment, contact Republican 
Reps. Cathy McMorris Rogers and Buddy 
Carter.

Madam Speaker, let me just say in 
closing, the PFAS Action Act is a 
strong and balanced bipartisan bill 
that will make a real difference for 
countless 
communities 
across 
the 
country. 
You have heard today that this bill 
may not be that necessary because the 
administration is already doing things, 
but I just point out that the adminis-
tration has sent a Statement of Admin-
istration Policy saying why the Presi-
dent would sign this bill. So obviously, 
he feels that it is necessary. 
And this is a quote from that State-
ment of Administration Policy that 
says, ‘‘The administration led by the 
EPA is working to collaborate on 
cross-cutting strategies, advanced new 
design, develop coordinated policies, 
regulations and communications; and 
continue engagement with affected 
States, Tribes, communities stake-
holders, and H.R. 2467 would further en-
hance those efforts.’’ 
Madam Speaker, like the administra-
tion, I am proud to support this bill. I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Each further amendment printed in 
part B of House Report 117–95 not ear-
lier considered as part of amendments

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 535, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO) 
and the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this en bloc of 10 amendments. As was 
done in the 116th Congress, the PFAS 
Action Act was subject to a sub-
committee markup, a full committee 
markup, and debate and amendment on 
the House floor. 
During these processes in the 116th 
and 117th Congresses, there has been an 
effort to continue to strengthen the 
proposal at each and every stage. The 
ten amendments included in this en 
bloc, which includes several bipartisan 
amendments, would build upon this 
past work and make further improve-
ments to the underlying bill. 
Several of the amendments help pro-
tect Americans from PFAS in their 
drinking water, especially those rely-
ing upon private wells, which would 
not be subject to the national drinking 
water standard required to be devel-
oped by this bill. 
We know communicating the risks of 
PFAS is challenging: What are safe lev-
els? What is a reliable testing tech-
nique? And what do you do if your 
water is contaminated? 
These amendments would help ensure 
people have better, clearer, and more 
accessible information on this and 
other issues. This en bloc also includes 
amendments that would increase grant 
funding to community water systems 
and ensure all communities dealing 
with PFAS contamination can access 
these funds, including insular terri-
tories. And it would establish a new 
grant program to support PFAS test-
ing and filtration at schools. 
We know the cost of PFAS remedi-
ation can be significant. Ensuring 
these costs do not fall squarely upon 
the households that rely upon these 
water systems, who are not responsible 
for the contaminations, should be a 
high priority of this effort. More Fed-
eral funding can help in this regard. 
Finally, the en bloc would expand the 
PFAS-free labeling program to cover 
food package material, luggage, and 
cleaning products. This will allow 
Americans to make certain that they 
have more informed choices on the 
products they choose to purchase. 
Overall, these are good improvements 
to the bill, and I do not believe they 
should be controversial. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage Mem-
bers to support the en bloc, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I claim the time in 
opposition, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES), who has been out-
spoken on this issue. 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
FITZPATRICK, for joining in this bipar-
tisan proposal. PFAS chemicals, as we 
have been hearing today, are harmful, 
manmade forever chemicals that are 
persistent, 
bio-accumulative, 
and 
toxic. 
These 
chemicals, 
which 
threaten 
more than 100 million Americans, pose 
serious risks to human health, includ-
ing cancer, immune disorders, and re-
productive system maladies. 
The PFAS Action Act will take crit-
ical steps to protect all Americans 
from PFAS chemicals by helping clean 
up contaminated sites under the Super-
fund program, limiting the exposure of 
PFAS chemicals, and establishing a 
health-protective 
drinking 
water 
standard that limits the amount of 
PFAS in our water systems. 
My amendment would strengthen the 
PFAS Action Act by expanding EPA’s 
ability 
to 
use 
the 
best-available 
science to address PFAS risks by re-
quiring manufacturers to provide ref-
erence standards for all PFAS chemi-
cals. This effort will help reduce PFAS 
pollution and keep our families safe. 
My amendment will provide the EPA 
with critical data about PFAS chemi-
cals and help the agency better iden-
tify these toxic substances in our com-
munities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the amendment and 
the underlying bill and vote in favor of 
this important legislation. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), who, along with 
Mrs. DINGELL, has really brought great 
focus to this issue in committee. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I still 
remember how I felt when I learned 
that one of the worst PFAS sites in the 
entire country was discovered right in 
my backyard in my district at the Mar-
athon petroleum refinery. Shock, hor-
ror, and a sinking feeling in the pit of 
my stomach just happened instantly. 
I called Congresswoman DINGELL, be-
cause that site borders our districts. 
And it is a community that continues 
to struggle with air quality and clean 
water. That ZIP Code, where Marathon 
Oil Refinery is now, that is the most 
polluted ZIP Code in all of the State of 
Michigan. So we wonder why the for-
ever chemical was found right there 
and how it is impacting people’s public 
health. 
We are finding in Michigan, as folks 
know, where we lead in the country in

PFAS testing, if you start looking for 
these toxic forever chemicals, you are 
going to find them. 
Madam Speaker, we have an urgent 
crisis in front of us that requires swift 
and decisive action. So it is great news 
that the House is now considering pass-
ing PFAS Action Act of 2021 today. 
The bill will require EPA to take ur-
gent PFAS action by requiring site 
cleanups, identifying health risks, and 
developing a drinking water standard 
to keep our community safe. We can-
not wait another day to start taking 
strong action to protect our residents 
from forever chemicals. 
As a Member of Congress, I was 
shocked—I think many of my residents 
were shocked—that we weren’t pro-
tected from PFAS in the Clean Air Act. 
Today, we, at least, get closer to 
changing that. Again, our residents de-
serve to live without being poisoned. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ), 
who has great concern for this issue. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, PFAS chemicals are life- 
threatening. They are forever chemi-
cals and need to be cleaned up. We will 
act today to regulate these chemicals 
and protect public health. 
Highland Dairy is a family-owned op-
eration that has served the eastern 
part of my district for four genera-
tions. In 2018, Highland learned that 
PFAS from the nearby Air Force base 
leaked into the shared aquifer that wa-
tered the grass which fed the cows. The 
PFAS 
contamination 
poisoned 
the 
cows and the dairy could not sell the 
milk or the cows. Highland is on the 
brink of disaster merely by being a 
neighbor to the Air Force base. We can-
not allow PFAS to work itself into our 
food system. 
Madam Speaker, my amendment re-
quires the EPA to consider the risk 
PFAS poses to water used for agricul-
tural purposes, like that at Highland. 
Madam Speaker, the EPA’s work 
must be inclusive of farmers, rural 
America, and the food we eat. I urge 
my colleagues to adopt the amendment 
and pass this bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
TONKO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
stand, again, in strong support of the 
en bloc amendment and, certainly, the 
measure to which we are amending. 
Basically, we have here an oppor-
tunity to address ills that we see 
across America, contaminants, forever 
dangerous elements that cause all sorts 
of diseases and destruction, and it is 
important for us to move forward, I 
think, to take responsibility and make 
certain that these forever chemicals 
that don’t break down, that cause can-
cer and other diseases, are addressed. 
We move forward with the oppor-
tunity here, assigning the great re-
sponsibilities to EPA so that we have a 
strong outcome. I think the amend-
ment makes the bill even stronger. I 
have seen situations in my given re-
gion of Upstate New York where com-
munities have been impacted. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage every-
one to support the amendment and the 
bill at hand, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we all believe that 
we must have clean water. Unfortu-
nately, this is not a thoughtful or sci-
entific approach. 
H.R. 2467 is opposed by a broad di-
verse, collection of interests that are 
concerned about its aggressive, over- 
the-top, unforgiving, and simultaneous 
mandates, obligations, and expenses.

JULY 21, 2021. 
Re Opposition to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action 
Act of 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of orga-
nizations representing the nation’s munic-
ipal governments and drinking water and 
wastewater systems, we write in opposition 
to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021. 
While we support taking action to reduce the 
prevalence of PFAS in the environment, the 
legislation would run counter to the impor-
tant ‘‘polluter pays’’ principle that guides 
Superfund site cleanups under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, Com-
pensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and 
would step back from the transparent, 
science-based process of regulating drinking 
water contaminants under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act (SDWA) and clean water oper-
ations under the Clean Water Act (CWA). We 
urge you to vote against this legislation in 
its current form. 
H.R. 2467 would require EPA to designate 
PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances 
under CERCLA within one year, and to make 
a determination on designating all remain-
ing PFAS within five years. These hazardous 
substance designations are intended to make 
sure polluters are held responsible for paying 
for the cleanup of contaminated Superfund 
sites, which we support. But the bill as cur-
rently structured would also mean that mu-
nicipal drinking water and wastewater util-
ity ratepayers could face staggering finan-
cial liability to clean up PFAS that was le-
gally disposed of following the water treat-
ment process. We believe water and waste-
water utilities, when acting in accordance 
with all applicable laws, should be provided 
an exemption to protect the utilities and 
water customers from bearing the costs of 
cleanup. 
In the case of drinking water systems, if 
PFAS is removed from source water in order 
to comply with a drinking water regulatory 
standard, the utility then becomes the pos-
sessor of filtration media that contain those 
PFAS. The utility must then dispose of these 
PFAS-laden filters, typically by sending 
them to a hazardous waste landfill in accord-
ance with applicable law. However, should 
that landfill ever become a Superfund site, 
then the water utility could be treated as a 
PFAS polluter—and be responsible for a por-
tion of the cleanup costs—forcing local rate-
payers to cover the cleanup bill after they 
already paid to remove the contaminants 
from their source water. 
Wastewater utilities would face similar li-
ability through no fault of their own because 
they receive PFAS chemicals through the 
raw influent that arrives at the treatment 
plant. This heterogenous influent can come 
from domestic, industrial, and commercial 
sources and may contain PFAS constituents 
ranging from trace to higher concentrations, 
depending on the nature of the dischargers 
to the sewer system. In any case, the influ-
ent is not generated by the utility, but the 
utility is responsible for treating it under 
scientific and regulatory authorities pro-
vided for under the CWA. Because waste-
water utilities cannot halt treating con-
tinual industrial or domestic wastewater in-
puts which likely contain PFAS in some con-
centration, they should be protected through 
a targeted CERCLA liability exemption. 
It is particularly disappointing that H.R. 
2467 would offer a CERCLA liability shield to 
airports that release PFAS into the environ-
ment through their use of firefighting foam. 
It defies logic that the legislation fails to ex-
tend that same liability protection to water 
and wastewater systems that have no choice 
but to dispose of PFAS found in water sup-
plies, and whose ratepayers would be ulti-
mately responsible for all of the costs associ-
ated with a Superfund site cleanup. As pas-
sive receivers of PFAS, water and waste-
water utilities should be afforded the same 
liability protections that the legislation 
would award airports in order to keep 
CERCLA liability focused on the corpora-
tions that created the pollution in the first 
place. Our organizations have repeatedly 
asked Congress for CERCLA liability shields 
in the legislation similar to those for air-
ports but have been rebuffed. 
Additionally, many of our organizations 
oppose provisions in H.R. 2467 that would 
amend SDWA by requiring EPA to promul-
gate a national primary drinking water regu-
lation for PFOA and PFOS within two years, 
establishing a unique and expedited drinking 
water contaminant regulatory process for 
other chemicals in the PFAS family, and 
eliminating EPA’s discretion on whether to 
issue drinking water health advisories re-
lated to PFAS. In sum, these changes would 
undermine the development of transparent, 
science-based drinking water standards, and 
would place undue cost burdens on our com-
munities and ratepayers while leading to 
premature regulatory decisions that lack 
public review and scientific validity. 
While we share the goal of addressing 
PFAS contamination and holding account-
able those entities that are responsible re-
leasing it into the environment, H.R. 2467

Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PALLONE
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER MCMORRIS RODGERS, On behalf of 
the nation’s mayors, cities and counties, we 
write to express our concerns with the As-
sistance, Quality, and Affordability Act of 
2021 (AQUA Act, H.R. 3291) and the PFAS Ac-
tion Act of 2021 (H.R. 2467). Our organizations 
strongly support provisions in H.R. 3291 that 
would reauthorize the Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund and authorize grants to sup-
port lead pipe replacement and PFAS treat-
ment. However, the legislation also includes 
provisions that would require the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set 
National Primary Drinking Water Regula-
tions for PFAS and other chemicals and reg-
ulate PFAS under the Comprehensive Envi-
ronmental Response, Compensation, and Li-
ability Act (CERCLA). These provisions 
could have unintended consequences for 
local governments and place an undue cost 
burden on communities and our residents. 
In general, our organizations support pro-
visions in the 1996 Amendments to the Safe 
Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which require 
that drinking water standards be based on 
sound science, public health protection and 
occurrence of contaminants in drinking 
water supplies at levels of public health con-
cern to reduce risk while balancing costs. 
Congress should not circumvent this process 
in any way for select contaminants. 
Moreover, CERCLA ensures that hazardous 
substances that may endanger public health 
or the environment are cleaned up by hold-
ing responsible parties financially liable. 
Local governments, including municipal air-
ports and fire departments, which were re-
quired by federal law to use firefighting 
foam containing PFAS chemicals, and drink-
ing water and wastewater utilities and mu-
nicipal landfills, which serve as receivers of 
PFAS chemicals and did not cause or con-
tribute to contamination, should not be held 
liable for PFAS contamination or cleanup 
costs. 
The nation is just emerging from a deadly 
pandemic that has left local governments 
and many of our residents and small busi-
nesses reeling financially. Our communities 
need financial assistance to address our 
drinking water infrastructure challenges, 
but we can not absorb costly unfunded man-
dates that will become an additional burden 
to local budgets and our residents. While we 
acknowledge the public health risks associ-
ated with PFAS chemicals and urge Congress 
and the Administration to examine PFAS 
contamination holistically and to take com-
prehensive action to address the problem, 
the federal government should avoid passing 
costs onto local governments and ratepayers 
for PFAS treatment and cleanup. 
We agree with the sentiment outlined in 
the comment letter from the American 
Water Works Association, Association of 
Metropolitan Water Agencies, National Asso-
ciation of Water Companies and the National 
Rural Water Association to the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee on June 15, 
which raises similar concerns. 
Specifically, we offer the following com-
ments on the AQUA Act and the PFAS Ac-
tion Act of 2021: 
Local governments, water utilities and 
their ratepayers should not be held finan-
cially liable under CERCLA for PFAS con-
tamination. CERCLA was established to 
make polluters and manufacturers of these 
pollutants pay for the contamination they 
caused. At a minimum, the legislation 
should extend a similar CERCLA liability 
exemption to local governments that is of-
fered to airports. 
We are opposed to Congress modifying 
EPA’s impartial contaminant regulatory 
process on an ad-hoc basis to establish a 
unique and expedited regulatory process for 
specific chemicals. The legislation would re-
quire EPA to rush to finalize drinking water 
regulations for PFOA, PFOS, and other 
chemicals in the PFAS family within two 
years of the bill’s enactment. We believe 
that an expedited time frame would come at 
the expense of public transparency and sci-
entific rigor and would lead to inequitable 
regulations that force the lowest-income 
water ratepayers to shoulder a greater pro-
portion of the new compliance costs that are 
passed on by their water systems. 
Repealing section 1412(b)(6) of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act, a key provision that al-
lows EPA the opportunity to ensure that the 
public health benefits of a drinking water 
regulation are reasonably balanced with the 
compliance costs that water system rate-
payers will incur, will directly shift the bur-
den to pay for these upgrades to local gov-
ernments. Under current law, if EPA deter-
mines that the benefits of a proposed max-
imum contaminant level (MCL) do not jus-
tify 
the 
costs 
of 
compliance, 
section 
1412(b)(6) gives EPA the option, following no-
tice and opportunity for public comment, to 
promulgate an MCL ‘‘that maximizes health 
risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justi-
fied by the benefits.’’ 
The PFAS infrastructure grant program as 
proposed in H.R. 2467 includes the limitation 
of eligible treatment technologies to those 
that are certified to remove ‘‘all detectable 
amounts’’ of PFAS from water supplies is ad-
mirable. We are concerned about this re-
quirement, however, since no technology is 
available today that can reliably meet this 
standard. 
As it pertains to the replacement of lead 
service lines, there is language included in 
the grant authorization that would require 
‘‘any recipient of funds . . . shall offer to re-
place any privately owned portion of the lead 
service line at no cost to the private owner.’’ 
This language is potentially problematic for 
several reasons. First, as the water associa-
tions pointed out in their letter, the lan-
guage could be interpreted to require any 
water system that receives any amount of 
program funds to permanently pay for all fu-
ture private-side lead service line replace-
ment costs, even after this federal grant as-
sistance has been exhausted. Second, we are 
also concerned that authorization does not 
mean full appropriations at the levels nec-
essary to replace all private residences’ lead 
service lines. Including this language could 
potentially hamper local government long- 
term efforts to develop a program to replace 
all lead service lines. Finally, we are con-
cerned that potential new EPA testing and 
replacement rules will trigger lead pipe re-
placement without the necessary Congres-
sional funds. For these reasons, we agree 
with the water associations’ recommenda-
tion—that the legislation should specify that 
‘‘none of the funds made available’’ through 
this program may be spent in a manner in-
consistent with conditions specified by Con-
gress. 
Thank you for considering the local gov-
ernment perspective as you move this legis-
lation forward. We look forward to working 
with you to address our nation’s drinking 
water needs. If you have any questions, 
please don’t hesitate to contact our staff: 
Judy Sheahan (USCM) Carolyn Berndt (NLC) 
or Adam Pugh (NACo).

DEAR
MEMBERS
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
REP-
RESENTATIVES: We, the undersigned organiza-
tions, strongly oppose H.R. 2467, the ‘‘PFAS 
Action Act.’’ Our organizations are com-
mitted to ensuring the safety of our employ-
ees and the communities where we live and 
operate. This legislation would delay and 
complicate 
contamination 
remediation 
issues. 
Product safety provides the foundation of 
consumer trust, and our members devote sig-
nificant resources to achieve this effort. 
Every member of the value chain has an im-
portant part to play to ensure the products 
consumers use are safe and sustainable. We 
remain committed to advancing effective, 
science-based solutions to PFAS challenges. 
This spring, we sent a letter to EPA Ad-
ministrator Michael Regan regarding pos-
sible designation of PFOA and PFOS as haz-
ardous substances under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA). As stated then, 
CERCLA is not an effective policy tool to 
fulfill the goal of accelerating cleanup in 
communities. 
Moreover, EPA has existing authority to 
meet the intent of this legislation and 
should be provided the time, resources, and 
flexibility to make its determination regard-
ing how best to address PFAS concerns. This 
approach should be made with guidance from 
the new PFAS Council review process, con-
sistent with sound science and accepted prin-
ciples for protecting public health and the 
environment. 
Finally, a bill of H.R. 2467’s magnitude and 
complexity, including the proposed sector- 
based wastewater effluent guidelines, de-
serves the opportunity to be examined at 
length in a committee setting. Many major 
stakeholders, including EPA, the Depart-
ment of Defense, other federal agencies and 
states have all taken significant actions to 
address PFAS since the last time we had a 
venue to discuss within a committee. 
We oppose the PFAS Action Act and ask 
that the House of Representatives do so as

DEAR CHAIRMAN TONKO AND RANKING MEM-
BER MCKINLEY: We, the undersigned organi-
zations, strongly oppose H.R. 2467, the 
‘‘PFAS Action Act.’’ Our organizations are 
committed to ensuring the safety of our em-
ployees and the communities where we live 
and operate. Product safety provides the 
foundation of consumer trust, and our mem-
bers devote significant resources to achieve 
this effort. Every member of the value chain 
has an important part to play to ensure the 
products consumers use are safe and sustain-
able. 
With these goals in mind, earlier this 
spring we sent a letter to EPA Adminis-
trator Michael Regan expressing our con-
cerns 
regarding 
possible 
designation 
of 
PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA). As stated then, CERCLA is not 
an effective policy tool to fulfill the goal of 
accelerating cleanup in communities and 
may delay cleanups already in process. 
EPA has existing authority to meet the in-
tent of this legislation and should be pro-
vided the time, resources, and flexibility to 
make its determination whether and how to 
address PFAS. This approach should be made 
under the new PFAS Council, consistent 
with sound science, and to protect human 
health and the environment. 
Finally, a bill of H.R. 2467’s magnitude and 
importance deserves a hearing before going 
to markup. The subcommittee has not held a 
hearing on PFAS for approximately two 
years. Since that time, EPA, the Department 
of Defense, other federal agencies, and the 
states have all taken significant actions to 
address PFAS challenges. The subcommittee 
should hear from those government agencies, 
the business community, and other key 
stakeholders before members decide on the 
proper scope and substance of any legisla-
tion. Moreover, the committee has gained 
many new members who deserve an oppor-
tunity to hear from such stakeholders before 
making policy decisions. 
We oppose the PFAS Action Act and ask 
the members of your subcommitte to do so 
as well. We stand ready to assist you 
throughout the legislative process.

The amendments en bloc is a collec-
tion of 10 individual amendments. In 
fact, some parts of it are indicative of 
the underlying bill. It is provisions you 
don’t need a bill to accomplish because 
EPA is already doing them. 
Other parts of this amendment high-
light, for me, why the overall bill 
should be opposed, and many do oppose 
it. Let me give you some examples. 
The amendments en bloc contains a 
provision that would create a website 
at EPA containing household well 
water testing. Ironically, EPA already 
has that website. For those interested, 
it is www.epa.gov/privatewells. 
Among its existing resources are 
items called for in these amendments: 
PFAS testing, health effects discus-
sion, and third-party certification rec-
ommendations. Any other issues could 
be solved by updating this website. 
The amendments en bloc also doubles 
down on certain consumer product 
problems the underlying bill creates 
and then kicks it up a notch. It adds 
luggage, umbrellas, and food packaging 
materials to section 10’s expansion of a 
program never designed for articles and 
would force significant changes and ad-
ministrative effort. 
It also requires every manufacturer 
or importer of a PFAS chemical in the 
last 10 years to send a sample of it to 
EPA and to each State. Notwith-
standing that this could make EPA 
subject to hazardous waste storage re-
quirements under section 9, EPA is al-
ready compelling comprehensive tox-
icity testing from the same people for 
the same ultimate purpose under sec-
tion 3 of the bill. 
The amendments en bloc authorizes 
funding for things that appear to be 
covered already. It increases the fund-
ing authorization in section 7 for 
grants by 600 percent. That is a hike 
before we even know how well the pro-
gram works or if the money is needed. 
It also provides reimbursement to 
communities that installed equipment 
to remove PFAS from drinking water 
when those upgrades were made with-
out expectation of Federal money. 
The amendments en bloc creates, 
similar to lead, a Federal grant pro-
gram for PFAS testing at schools, 
drinking water filters, and disposal ef-
forts. But there is nothing to suggest 
PFAS enters drinking water like lead, 
and the used filters are not protected 
from Superfund liability if they are 
safely disposed. 
I wish we would take the time to 
make the real reforms that would im-
prove this bill—amendments like the 
one offered by Mr. BILIRAKIS to protect 
the bill from harming semiconductor 
production in the United States of 
America. PFAS are essential to etch-
ing and cleaning semiconductors, and 
we don’t want this bill to prevent the 
formation of a domestic supply chain 
in the United States of America. 
I am also thinking about bipartisan 
amendments offered by Dr. BUCSHON 
and Mr. SCHRADER to protect PFAS 
used in FDA-approved drugs and de-
vices. Pediatric and adult heart pa-
tients have PFAS to thank for stents 
and heart valves that keep them alive 
today. 
Mr. CARTER, too, had an amendment 
to save chlorine production from ex-
tinction in this country. There are 
only three ways to make it: mercury, 
which is being phased out; asbestos, 
which EPA has considered banning; 
and PFAS. Coming out of a pandemic, 
killing chlorine should be the last 
thing we are trying to do. 
Mr. CRENSHAW also had an amend-
ment to protect the use of PFAS in 
protective gear. Crime is surging in our 
cities. Now more than ever, our police 
personnel and military should not be 
put in danger because the chemicals 
necessary to keep them safe are a cas-
ualty of this bill. 
These amendments were not made in 
order. The Congressional Budget Office, 
CBO, score of H.R. 2467 was indetermi-
nate, stating its administration would 
cost the Federal Government $280 mil-
lion, but it is impossible to know how 
it impacts Federal spending. 
No matter how well-intended or well- 
meaning this bill may be, its impacts 
are broad, unknown, and depend on 
things Congress hasn’t yet established 
and must think through. 
The amendments en bloc does not im-
prove this bill, and I oppose it and urge 
others to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 535, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 226, nays 
195, not voting 9, as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Crenshaw moves to recommit the bill, 
H.R. 2467, to the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
The material previously referred to

In section 2— 
(1) redesignate subsections (d) and (e) as 
subsections (e) and (f), respectively; and 
(2) insert after subsection (c) the following: 
(d) PROTECTIVE GEAR.—No person shall be 
liable under the Comprehensive Environ-
mental Response, Compensation, and Liabil-
ity Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) for the 
costs of responding to, or damages resulting 
from, a release to the environment of a 
perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substance 
designated as a hazardous substance under 
section 102(a) of such Act that is related to 
the manufacture of individual protective 
equipment, including body armor, that is de-
signed to protect members of the United 
States military, law enforcement personnel, 
or first responders (including Federal, State, 
local, territorial, and Tribal law enforce-
ment personnel and first responders) from— 
(1) threats posed by ballistic, edged, chem-
ical, biological, or other weaponry; or 
(2) hazards posed by extreme weather. 
Page 9, line 14, strike ‘‘For a period’’ and 
insert ‘‘Except as provided in paragraph (3), 
for a period’’. 
Page 10, after line 2, insert the following: 
‘‘(3) PROTECTIVE
GEAR.—This subsection 
shall not apply with respect to a notice de-
scribed in paragraph (1) that is related to the 
manufacture of individual protective equip-
ment, including body armor, that is designed 
to protect members of the United States 
military, law enforcement personnel, or first 
responders (including Federal, State, local, 
territorial, and Tribal law enforcement per-
sonnel and first responders) from threats 
posed by ballistic, edged, chemical, biologi-
cal, or other weaponry, or hazards posed by 
extreme weather.’’. 
Section 8(b) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: ‘‘In revising such list, the 
Administrator shall exclude from any cat-
egory or subcategory so listed a source 
whose emissions of such a substance are re-
lated to the manufacture of individual pro-
tective equipment, including body armor, 
that is designed to protect members of the 
United States military, law enforcement per-
sonnel, or first responders (including Fed-
eral, State, local, territorial, and Tribal law 
enforcement personnel and first responders) 
from threats posed by ballistic, edged, chem-
ical, biological, or other weaponry, or haz-
ards posed by extreme weather.’’. 
Page 25, after line 13, insert the following: 
‘‘(3) EXEMPTION.—Paragraph (1)(C) shall 
not apply with respect to individual protec-
tive equipment, including body armor, that— 
‘‘(A) 
contains 
perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances; and 
‘‘(B) is designed to protect members of the 
United States military, law enforcement per-
sonnel, or first responders (including Fed-
eral, State, local, territorial, and Tribal law 
enforcement personnel and first responders) 
from— 
‘‘(i) threats posed by ballistic, edged, 
chemical, biological, or other weaponry; or 
‘‘(ii) hazards posed by extreme weather.’’.

TO 
MAKE 
CORRECTIONS 
IN 
EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 2467, PFAS 
ACTION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that, in the en-
grossment of H.R. 2467, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers, 
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the actions of 
the House, including striking lines 13

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
New York? 
There was no objection.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS OF PAM HOWELL-BEACH 
TO GREATER TOLEDO 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and pay tribute to 
the contributions of Pam Howell-Beach 
to the greater Toledo community. 
During her tenure with the Toledo 
Community Foundation, Pam guided 
the organization to a strong financial 
future, increasing its assets by over $80 
million. 
Later, as executive director of the 
Stranahan Foundation, Pam oversaw 
grant distributions of more than $71 
million to organizations working in 
education, health, and the arts. 
Pam’s leadership in the nonprofit 
world was as wide as it was appreciated 
and as big as her heart. From working 
with the Zonta Club of Toledo, Philan-
thropy Ohio, Ability Center of Greater 
Toledo, and Mercy Health Partners, to 
the Early Childhood Funders Collabo-
rative, and Susan G. Komen Founda-
tion, her impassioned service touched 
the lives of thousands upon thousands 
of Toledoans. 
As Pam confronts a challenging 
health situation, I want to convey, on 
behalf of all Toledoans, how grateful 
we are for her work, her life, her dedi-
cation and her love for community. We 
are all the better as a result of her life-
long commitment to others. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Pam, and 
may God bless her today and always. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST KEEP THE 
BIPARTISAN SPIRIT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, throughout this Con-
gress, the House Agriculture Com-
mittee has had countless discussions 
on ways that we can empower our farm 
families and build a robust rural econ-
omy. 
Earlier this month, we made good on 
our word. I am proud to be able to work 
with all members of our committee and 
support the Broadband Internet Con-
nections for Rural America Act, which 
provides significant investments into 
the deployment and development of 
broadband to rural America. 
This legislation reflects many of our 
shared priorities and shared work. And 
in many ways, it is similar to the bi-
partisan legislation I introduced ear-
lier this year. 
I thank all of the members of the Ag-
riculture Committee for their work and 
enthusiasm to meet the needs of rural 
Americans. I know this issue is so per-
sonal for each of us and the constitu-
ents we represent. 
The House Agriculture Committee is 
often considered the most bipartisan 
committee in the House. This markup 
bill is proof that we can still reach an 
agreement under extraordinary times, 
and I hope we can keep this bipartisan 
spirit as infrastructure talks continue. 
f 
200 DAYS OF DEMOCRATS 
WORKING TO BUILD BACK BETTER 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, today marks 200 days of this 
Congress; 200 days of House Democrats 
working to build back better. 
Madam Speaker, our constituents 
want us to meet this moment. 
That is why we have passed historic 
legislation to strengthen our democ-
racy, ensure equal pay, guarantee the 
rights of LGBTQ-plus Americans, ad-
vance racial justice, prioritize gun 
safety and more. 
We started this Congress by passing 
the American Rescue Plan, a historic 
investment in workers and families 
that included the expanded and im-
proved child tax credit, one of the most 
important antipoverty measures of this 
generation. 
Last week, I met with parents in 
Chula Vista who had tears in their eyes 
talking about what a difference the 
new child tax credit would make for 
their families. 
They talked about not only being 
able to pay for rent and childcare and 
school supplies, but also for the first 
time being able to start saving for 
their kids to go to college. 
Madam Speaker, that is worth cele-
brating, and it is worth protecting. 
Let’s build on the progress we have 
made, make permanent the expanded 
child tax credit, and make sure Amer-
ican families truly can build back bet-
ter.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the right 
to life is one of the founding principles 
of our Nation. Every human being, 
born or unborn, is entitled to life, lib-
erty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Yet today, we see this right under at-
tack as the Biden administration con-
tinues their war on the unborn by seek-
ing to remove the Hyde amendment, a

longstanding pro-life protection that 
has saved 2.5 million lives from abor-
tion since 1976. 
Not too long ago, President Joe 
Biden stated: ‘‘Those of us who are op-
posed to abortion should not be com-
pelled to pay for them.’’ But his pro-
posed budget fails to include the Hyde 
amendment, 
making 
it 
clear 
that 
President Biden does not continue to 
value the life of the unborn. 
This is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 
18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act. I, like many Tennesseans, be-
lieve taxpayer dollars should never be 
used to fund abortions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.

DELIVERING FOR THE PEOPLE 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to join you in marking 200 days since 
the start of the 117th Congress, and a 
productive 200 days it has been. Our 
majority in the House has risen to this 
challenge, delivering lifelines to mil-
lions of Americans, putting shots in 
arms and saving countless lives, and 
sustaining thousands of businesses, and 
helping our State and local govern-
ments keep our communities going. 
We built on that momentum with 
legislation to establish paycheck fair-
ness and universal background checks 
on gun sales, build greater justice into 
our policing and our economy, stop 
voter disenfranchisement, and restor-
ing the principle of one person, one 
vote, and protecting Americans from 
the devastating effects of PFAS. 
Just in the past several weeks, mil-
lions of families started receiving the 
improved child tax credit expected to 
lift one-half of America’s poorest chil-
dren out of poverty. 
Madam Speaker, before I close, let 
me recognize one other milestone; The 
1 year anniversary of the passing of my 
dear friend, and a hero and a friend to 
many, Congressman John Lewis. 
I hope that he smiles down upon us 
favorably for this work, much of it 
building on a legacy he carried on his 
mighty shoulders throughout his life. 
Brother John, we do miss you. Even 
as we work in your mighty shadow, 
may we always be guided by your light. 
LIBERTY AND FREEDOM FOR 
CUBANS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
want to express my full support for the 
brave Cubans who are demanding free-
dom from their tyrannical communist 
government. 
For over 60 years, the regime in Cuba 
has run the country into the ground. It 
doesn’t recognize the basic human 
rights of its citizens, and Cuban people 
don’t have access to food, economic op-
portunities, or COVID–19 vaccines. 
The Cuban people are now taking to 
the streets to fight for individual lib-
erty and freedom. As authoritarians 
do, the regime has arrested hundreds of 
demonstrators and cut off their com-
munication with the outside world. 
Madam Speaker, a communist gov-
ernment will do whatever it takes to 
keep 
the 
Cuban 
people 
under 
its 
thumb. The Cuban Government has a 
lot in common with the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Both will stop at noth-
ing to hold on to power and have no re-
gard for the rights of the people they 
govern. 
The Cuban government wants to si-
lence its citizens’ demands for freedom, 
just as the Communist Chinese Party 
silences those in Hong Kong and 
Xinjiang who simply want to be free. 
Cubans, and Cuban Americans espe-
cially, know communism does not 
work. It only brings poverty and op-
pression. It is our privilege as Ameri-
cans to live in a country that values 
freedom, the Lord, and we must sup-
port those brave Cubans who want the 
same in our own backyard only 90 
miles off the coast of the Florida.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of our most vulner-
able Americans; the unborn. They do 
not have a voice. It is up to us to be 
their champion and fight for their 
right to life. 
I am deeply concerned by the actions 
of the majority and the current occu-
pants of the White House. They are ac-
tively destroying decades of progress 
and protections for the unborn, which 
is why it is essential to pass the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR 
ABORTION ACT 
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, here 
we go again. The majority Democratic 
party 
wants 
to 
kill 
our 
children 
through abortion. 
I rise today to discuss the impor-
tance of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding For Abortion Act. For over 
two decades, lawmakers have passed 
the Hyde amendment in a bipartisan 
fashion to ensure Americans aren’t 
forced to fund abortion on demand with 
their hard-earned tax dollars. 
We have had a strong majority of 
Americans—Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans alike in the past have agreed to 
this. Folks, it is a sad day in America, 
as a father and a grandfather, to have 
this embarrassing example of the kill-
ing of our children. Unborn children 
are no less alive than I am. All life is 
a gift that begins at conception, and 
develops rapidly before birth. To ex-
pect Americans to subsidize these inhu-
mane killings is a complete disgrace. 
That is why I have always fought for 
the sanctity of life, and I will continue 
to fight. 
I ask for the passage of H.R. 18 so the 
ban on Federal funding for abortions is 
not only permanent, but Government- 
wide. 
f 
GREEN NEW DEAL FOR PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BOWMAN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, this 
afternoon, we are focused on the Green 
New Deal. And I want to be very clear 
about why we need a Green New Deal. 
Our fossil fuel-driven economy is mak-
ing us sick and literally killing us. But 
with historic investments in green in-
frastructure and the care economy, we 
can do the opposite. We can repair the 
damage done and give every person 
what they need to flourish. 
In the Pacific Northwest, we just saw 
a brutal heat wave that took the lives 
of 116 people in Oregon, 112 people in 
Washington, and hundreds more in 
British Columbia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3793 
July 21, 2021 
We saw catastrophic floods across 
Europe that killed nearly 200 people, 
and record-shattering rains that caused 
deaths in India and China. We are liv-
ing with wildfires that destroy commu-
nities and suffocate us with smoke. Af-
rica is being battered by drought, and 
Siberia is in flames. We literally saw 
the ocean on fire. 
We now live in a world in which ex-
treme 
weather 
driven 
by 
climate 
change is killing 5 million people per 
year. And in parts of my district, you 
are three times more likely to die from 
asthma than anywhere else in the 
country. We need to be crystal clear 
about the fact that our economic sys-
tem created this emergency, while our 
political system subsidizes and pro-
tects the fossil fuel industry. That has 
to change now. 
The Green New Deal provides the 
framework we need to rebuild our econ-
omy, society, and democracy from the 
ground up. The Green New Deal recog-
nizes 
that 
climate 
change, 
public 
health, systemic racism, and economic 
inequality are all deeply connected. 
And as you will hear tonight, it gives 
us a road map for tackling these crises 
together in a holistic manner. 
As a lifelong educator, I see the per-
fect place to kickstart this process, our 
K–12 public schools. 
Think about it, there is no single in-
stitution that touches the lives of more 
people. We are talking about 50 million 
young people, plus parents, teachers, 
staff, workers, and neighbors. Our 
schools are the heartbeat of our com-
munities, and they must become the 
epicenter of transformative climate 
change. 
For decades, we have allowed these 
precious places to be neglected, par-
ticularly in redlined parts of the coun-
try. We are leaving Black and Brown 
students and low-income students be-
hind. We over-test the academic ability 
of our children, but we do not support 
and engage them as human beings. 
And on a physical level, our schools 
have fallen into a state of disrepair. In 
my 20 years as a teacher and principal, 
I saw this every single day. We have 
schools with no running hot water or 
drinking fountains that do not work. 
Schools where the drinking fountains 
that do work are poisoning our chil-
dren with lead. 
We have schools that are infested 
with asbestos, mold, and rodents, and 
that lack proper ventilation. So every 
day our children face a whole spectrum 
of urgent health harms. And even as 
young people march and organize re-
lentlessly for climate action, schools 
are failing to protect them from cli-
mate impacts, like extreme heat. Out-
dated, inefficient HVAC systems are 
contributing to carbon pollution and 
burdening schools with $8 billion in an-
nual energy costs. 
Last week, I introduced a bill called 
the Green New Deal for Public Schools. 
This is a $1.43 trillion investment over 
10 years designed to fundamentally 
transform our public education system 
for the 21st century. It will create and 
support more than 1 million green jobs 
every year, and it centers the most pre-
cious resource in any healthy democ-
racy, our children. 
With this legislation, we are going to 
upgrade and retrofit every single public 
school in the country, beginning in the 
poorest and most vulnerable districts. 
Every school will become a safe, 
healthy, accessible, and zero-carbon 
center of the community. 
We will remove toxic materials, elec-
trify school facilities, and make them 
energy-efficient, comfortable, and dis-
aster-proof. We will install solar panels 
and batteries so that every school gen-
erates and controls its own renewable 
energy. We will create community gar-
dens 
and 
green 
spaces, 
and 
offer 
healthy food options to nourish our 
children, and so much more. 
These investments will be game- 
changing for schools in a variety of 
ways. They could see their energy bills 
roughly cut in half and reinvest the 
money that they save in the mental 
and behavioral health resources that 
our children and families need. 
In fact, this bill provides comprehen-
sive funding for healing the trauma of 
our communities. It will allow schools 
to hire hundreds of thousands more 
educators, mental health professionals, 
school counselors, and other support 
staff, especially from the local commu-
nity. It also provides significant re-
sources for school districts to form 
strong community partnerships and de-
velop curricula that are responsive to 
unique local needs. 
The legislation tackles school in-
equality at the regional level by quad-
rupling Title I funding. And it greatly 
increases IDEA funding for students 
with disabilities. This is about care; 
caring for ourselves, each other, our 
families, our communities, and the 
planet. That is what the Green New 
Deal is all about. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my other 
colleagues who will highlight the many 
other ways the Green New Deal frame-
work addresses our Nation’s urgent 
needs. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (CAROLYN B. 
MALONEY), the chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank my 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
JAMAAL
BOWMAN, and the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus for bringing 
us together today to highlight the im-
portance of the Green New Deal. 
Madam Speaker, climate change is 
one of the single most pressing threats 
facing this country and the global com-
munity, and our most vulnerable com-
munities are bearing the brunt of the 
consequences. That is why today, as 
chair of the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, I held a hearing on 
President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative. 
During this hearing, we heard from 
experts about the need to swiftly and 
effectively implement this initiative to 
ensure that the communities hardest 
hit by pollution, poverty, and public 
health risks receive a fair share of our 
Nation’s climate and infrastructure in-
vestments. 
b 1545 
As chair of the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee, I am committed to 
ensuring that the administration and 
all Federal agencies have the tools 
they need to implement the Justice40 
Initiative. This is crucial to ensuring 
that our climate investments advance 
racial and economic justice. 
Beyond the Justice40 Initiative, we 
need to prioritize policy solutions here 
in Congress that really focus on cli-
mate justice. For New York City, that 
means investing in a green future for 
public housing and for our public 
schools. 
This past Earth Day, I reintroduced 
the Public Housing Solar Equity Act, 
which would guarantee that any solar 
energy generated on public housing 
land benefits the residents of those de-
velopments first. 
Looking beyond solar energy, all 
public housing repairs and moderniza-
tion projects should be green, which is 
exactly what the Green New Deal for 
Public Housing does. This bill will pro-
vide funding to electrify all buildings, 
add solar panels, and secure renewable 
energy sources for all public housing 
energy needs. In short, it will make 
Federal housing cleaner, safer, and 
greener. 
Housing is a human right that no 
New Yorker, no American, should go 
without. As we work to make sure ev-
eryone has access to the clean afford-
able housing they need and deserve, 
let’s expand our goals to make these 
communities green, too. 
For the health of our residents and 
for our environment, we cannot afford 
to do anything less. 
For the health of our students, we 
need a Green New Deal for Public 
Schools, a transformative and unprece-
dented investment that will not only 
make our schools greener but also ex-
pand services for our students. My col-
league, JAMAAL BOWMAN, is a former 
educator and has authored this impor-
tant bill, of which I am a cosponsor. 
We are in a state of emergency. The 
West is burning; cities are flooding; 
and extreme weather events are becom-
ing all too common. We need to act 
now, and we need to act boldly. 
For the health and safety of all 
Americans, for environmental and so-
cial justice, let’s make a Green New 
Deal. We can’t afford to do anything 
less. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from New York (Mr. BOWMAN) 
for focusing on education and our envi-
ronment and putting both of them to-
gether creatively with the Green New 
Deal for Public Schools. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I

York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ), who is the 
original Green New Deal champion in

Congress and who has done so much in 
collaboration with social movements 
to inject this vision into the conscious-
ness of America. Her Green New Deal 
for Public Housing was a major inspira-
tion for my schools legislation. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is such an honor to be here 
just over 2 years after we introduced 
the original Green New Deal resolu-
tion, which has now inspired a great 
deal of similar resolutions and Green 
New Deal resolutions adopted and in-
troduced 
into 
municipalities 
and 
States across the country. 
Not only have similar resolutions 
been introduced, but we also have seen 
inspiration for other forms of Green 
New Deal legislation, like the Green 
New Deal for Public Housing, the 
Green New Deal for Public Schools, and 
beyond. 
But I think one thing that is very 
important for us to discuss is a very 
urgent matter, which is the infrastruc-
ture package that is right here before 
Congress that is being negotiated by 
both the House and the Senate. 
While I certainly wish sometimes 
that our legislation was informed pri-
marily by the legislators that are here 
writing this legislation, by commu-
nities that are impacted by this legis-
lation, it goes without saying that 
there is a great deal of dark money in-
volved in the fight on climate change, 
and that dark money is intended for us 
to not act in this situation. 
We have lobbyists from companies 
like ExxonMobil bragging about their 
role in shaping our Federal legislation 
and curtailing our ambitions and in 
fighting against key provisions to draw 
down our carbon emissions. 
Whenever I see something like this, 
whenever I see how dark money and 
lobbyists act as a wedge and a cudgel 
between elected officials and public 
servants and the people that we are 
supposed to represent, not only do I 
think it is heartbreaking, but it is very 
much tragic. 
There is a key issue that we have 
here in acting on climate, and the big 
part of that issue is something that we 
call kind of a principal-agent problem 
where the people in charge of making 
decisions are simply not aligned and 
not incentivized to make the right ones 
because they are not feeling the impact 
of it. 
I get concerned when we have con-
versations that the politics of the day 
get involved and intercede, and they 
complicate the policy for a generation. 
It is so critically important because I 
can’t help but imagine that so many of 
the people that are in charge of block-
ing action on climate will not see the 
world that they are leaving to genera-
tions to come. 
We have a moral responsibility to 
leave this world better than we found 
it. This is not about theory anymore. 
This is not about challenging the 
science anymore. 
In New York City just yesterday, 
people woke up having a harder time 
breathing and having a harder time 
seeing the horizon because of the 
smoke from the Bootleg fires out in Or-
egon coming out to our city. 
Wildfires will come and impact all of 
us. Floods and waters will come to im-
pact all of us. But they will not impact 
all of us equally. The most vulnerable 
communities will be left behind, and 
we can stop it. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. Not 
only can we stop it, and not only can 
we draw down our emissions, but we 
can create millions of jobs doing so— 
millions of good union jobs. 
We can create a civilian climate 
corps. We can transition to renewable 
energy. We can build infrastructure 
that all people can enjoy that is not 
just attuned to the wealthy. We can re-
store our land. We can live in harmony 
with an economy where we can care for 
one another instead of extracting off of 
each other. 
We can build this world, and this 
world is close. It is so close. It is so 
close. That is why we see dark money 
mobilizing the way that it is right now, 
because they know that we can win. 
Hopefully, in this package, we will 
continue to win. But this fight does not 
stop now. It does not stop with this in-
frastructure package. It will not stop, 
frankly, throughout the course of our 
lives because we have a responsibility 
to leave this world a better place for 
ourselves and our children. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. TAKANO), the chair of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative 
BOWMAN
for 
yielding, and I fully appreciate an op-
portunity to be in partnership with a 
fellow teacher for the cause of climate 
change. 
Climate change is infrastructure. Our 
buildings, roads, and transportation 
are directly impacted by the impending 
climate crisis. 
In this 1 year, we have seen our 
oceans on fire; a pipeline broke in the 
Gulf of Mexico; our bridges are crum-
bling; our buildings are collapsing; 
wildfires and heat waves have been 
paired with rolling blackouts in my 
district. 
Unfortunately, my constituents and I 
have experienced this for decades with-
out much progress, but we cannot con-
tinue to accept this as a reality, a con-
tinuing reality. 
In addition to losing power in my dis-
trict, some of the worst air quality in 
the country exists in my district. De-
spite California leading the Nation in 
investing in renewable energy, we still 
are not doing enough. 
As co-chair of the Congressional En-
ergy Storage Caucus, I know how crit-
ical it is for us to invest in renewable 
microgrids that are powered by solar 
and wind energy and backed by battery 
energy storage. Congress must provide 
municipalities, businesses, and resi-
dents with the ability to purchase and 
build their own energy grids that are 
resilient to our frequent natural disas-
ters. 
We have the technology to catch up 
to the modern industrial world. We 
cannot afford not to use this tech-
nology. We must invest. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with my colleagues to con-
tinue calling attention to the survival 
of our planet and our future genera-
tions, the well-being of our commu-
nities, and the critical importance of 
passing legislation across the board 
that reflects our values, which are em-
bodied in the Green New Deal. 
The science is clear. We must ur-
gently address climate change now. We 
must address our greenhouse gas foot-
print and the causes of climate change 
now. We must mitigate the impacts of 
climate change now. And we must sup-
port and center and empower and in-
vest in our communities now. 
That is what the Green New Deal is 
all about, building a world that is more 
just, more equitable, and more cli-
mate-resilient for future generations, 
for our children, for our parents, and 
for everyone across our communities. 
To do so, we have to invest in our 
communities, critical infrastructure, 
and all the things that will make it 
possible for our communities to thrive. 
The time is now to be decisive, to be 
brave in our policymaking, to be bold 
in our investments, and to lean into 
the science. 
We must do so now in the budget rec-
onciliation and infrastructure pack-
ages that this body is working to pass 
right now. 
This is especially critical for my 
home State of New Mexico, where we 
are already experiencing the impacts of 
extreme drought, catastrophic fires, 
heat waves, and an uncertain future, 
and where our communities are already 
struggling daily to make a living. Our 
families are struggling to put food on 
the table and struggling to support 
people across our community. 
It is absolutely critical that we sup-
port and center our communities in 
this conversation and that we invest in 
the resilient infrastructure that will 
make it possible for us to live resil-
iently: our electric grid, broadband in-
frastructure, drinking water, irrigation 
infrastructure, and green infrastruc-
ture, and to lean into our clean energy 
future. 
We must also invest in the infra-
structure of our communities, our care 
economy, because that is the infra-
structure of our economy and the well- 
being of our people, our schools, and 
our families. 
b 1600 
We must do all of this through the 
lens of social, racial, and economic jus-
tice, investing in good paying jobs, lift-
ing up the voices of and listening to 
the people in our communities and en-
suring that their livelihoods and well-

being are at the center of these con-
versations. 
That is why we need bold action now 
in the budget, in reconciliation, and in 
the infrastructure package to ensure 
that we are investing in things that are 
not only shovel-ready but shovel wor-
thy and worthy of our communities 
and their future. 
The time for action is now. We need 
climate action now, and I am proud to 
stand shoulder to shoulder with my 
colleagues here in the House and in the 
Senate to ensure that we are making 
good on our commitment to our future. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. BOWMAN for reserving the 
time on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives so that we can speak the 
truth about what too many families 
and too many people—mostly poor peo-
ple—have to endure, not only in Amer-
ica but around the world. 
I was born and raised in the north-
east San Fernando Valley, and I am 
very, very proud to say, in the Senate 
I have a colleague who grew up in 
Pacoima just like I did. His parents 
were immigrants of Mexico, and so 
were mine. We went to the same ele-
mentary school and the same high 
school, but yet at the same time we 
ended up being on the city council to-
gether for some years, he as a council 
president and I as a new member. 
He said to me: Tony, what committee 
do you want to chair? 
I said: I want to chair the committee 
that oversees the airport, the ports and 
the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power. 
At that time the Los Angeles Depart-
ment of Water and Power was the larg-
est water and power district in Amer-
ica. 
Why did I want to be on those com-
mittees? 
Because those three entities are 
spewing more into our atmosphere 
than any other organizations in Los 
Angeles. It gave me the opportunity to 
live my values, to be able to grow up in 
a poor community, yes, in the hood, in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley, on 
that side of town where there are more 
dumpsites in that part of L.A. Coun-
ty—a county of 10 million people—but 
they 
have 
concentrated 
more 
dumpsites in my backyard than any 
other place in that county. 
For ALEX PADILLA, our families, and 
me, we had to endure that for genera-
tions. But here Alex is, a city council 
member, the president of the council, 
choosing to put me as the chairman of 
that committee. And while I was on 
that committee, I forced the Los Ange-
les Department of Water and Power to 
finally clean up their act. 
Believe it or not, the progressive Los 
Angeles Department of Water and 
Power belongs to the city of Los Ange-
les, the people of Los Angeles. We were 
fooled into believing that we are a pro-
gressive community and that we would 
not be spewing out dirty fossil fuels to 
create the electricity that we depend 
on every day. But we did, Madam 
Speaker. 
Approximately 60 percent of all of 
the energy that was being produced for 
our city and for our community was 
coming from fossil fuels. Under the 
presidency 
of 
President 
ALEX 
PADILLA,—who 
is 
now 
our 
United 
States Senator from California—he 
gave me the mantle of being the chair-
man of that committee, we forced the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power to cut their emissions in half, to 
literally divest themselves of dirty 
coal plants, and to finally clean up our 
act. 
I am very, very proud to say that as 
the first council member to represent 
that community to be born and raised 
in Pacoima, I was the first council 
member to tell a company that owned 
a private dumpsite when they wanted 
to expand it again and again and again, 
I was the first council member to say: 
No, you are not. 
We denied them their expansion. 
That was the first time it had ever hap-
pened. 
Again, Madam Speaker, for far too 
long we were being represented by peo-
ple who didn’t realize or understand 
what it is like to grow up in a commu-
nity where environmental injustice 
prevails and proliferates. We suffer 
from asthma rates that other commu-
nities don’t suffer. Our children do. Our 
families do. We suffer from ground-
water that is more contaminated than 
any other place in America. 
We finally brought the grants from 
Washington, from city hall, and from 
Sacramento, our State capital, to clean 
up our act and to clean up our ground-
water. 
Those are the kinds of things that we 
are doing in Congress. Those are the 
kinds of things that the Green New 
Deal has brought to light where before 
only certain people experienced it and 
only certain people cared. 
Now, today, we are talking about 
something that I am very proud of. I 
am very proud to be one of the original 
cosponsors of the Green New Deal in 
this Congress, but equally proud, with 
my colleague Congressman BOWMAN, to 
be an original cosponsor of the Green 
New Deal for Public Schools Act. These 
are the kinds of investments that we 
need to make as Congress. 
Equally important, we need to make 
sure that we continue to remind every 
single person that we are in this to-
gether. As go our communities, as goes 
our country, and as goes the environ-
ment, so does the planet. Even though 
some billionaires are flying up into the 
sky and getting into outer space, this 
is our planet, Madam Speaker. We can-
not escape it. 
Why try to escape it? 
Why not just look in the mirror and 
see what we all can do about it? 
That is the responsible thing to do. 
That is something that we can and 
should be proud of. 
So I stand here today to encourage 
every single one of us to help clean up 
our act and to, once again, thank my 
colleague, Congressman BOWMAN, for 
inviting me and the rest of us to speak 
the truth on this floor today about how 
important it is that we have a Green 
New Deal for all. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Ms. BUSH), to whom I want to 
wish a very happy birthday today. 
Ms. BUSH is another powerful Green 
New Deal champion who has intro-
duced a fantastic Green New Deal For 
Cities bill. I also had the pleasure of 
working with Ms. BUSH on our public 
power resolution. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today because the 
Green New Deal cannot wait, and my 
brother, Representative BOWMAN, un-
derstands that. I thank him for push-
ing this, and I thank him for speaking 
up and speaking out. It is not an easy 
place to speak out from. Especially as 
Black Americans in this country, it is 
not usually one of the things that peo-
ple think that the Black community 
will speak out about, but this is our 
work to speak out about it to make 
sure that our communities are made 
whole. 
Yes, today is my 45th birthday. 
Birthdays are both a time of celebra-
tion and a time of reflection. 
Today, there are 11 more 90-degree 
days per year in St. Louis than the 
year that I was born. I am thinking 
about that St. Louis heat, the heat 
under which Michael Brown Jr.’s body 
lay for more than 41⁄2 hours on the hot 
asphalt in August of 2014. 
I am wondering how many more 90- 
degree days we will have when I turn 
50. 
What about when I turn 55? 
When I turn 60? 
I am wondering how many more 
times Black bodies will lie dead in the 
summer heat on that asphalt from the 
environmental injustice of police mur-
der. Yes, that is an environmental in-
justice. 
I am thinking about how in the dec-
ade I was born the city of St. Louis 
pledged to prioritize elimination of 
lead pipes. But today Black children in 
the city of St. Louis are 2.4 times more 
likely than White children to test posi-
tive for lead in their blood. For my en-
tire lifetime, we have been promised 
that this problem would be fixed. But 
today it still persists. 
I am thinking about what the world 
will look like when my son and my 
daughter turn 45. I am thinking about 
the opportunity we have right now to 
deliver them a better world. I am 
thinking about how blessed I am to be 
in a position to do something about it. 
Earlier this year, Congresswoman 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ and I in-
troduced the Green New Deal for Cities 
Act to fund the environmental justice 
work of a Green New Deal in every 
community. Our bill would create good 
paying jobs in our communities to

solve the environmental racism that 
we face each and every day. It will 
clean up our polluted creeks and our 
vacant lots. Many don’t know that 
when you drive in some communities, 
Madam Speaker, where it looks like 
the community doesn’t care, some-
times it is not that the community 
doesn’t care, sometimes it is because 
the ground is contaminated in our 
Black and in our Brown communities 
that those lots sit there vacant. Those 
lots sit there like they are unattended 
to, but there is more to the story, and 
financially that is the issue. 
When we look at cleaning up our pol-
luted creeks and our vacant lots—every 
move further we have to make sure 
that we replace fossil fuels with renew-
able energy. 
Why are we still having that con-
versation? 
I don’t want my 46th birthday to 
come next year and our communities 
are still waiting for the people with the 
power of the pen and the people with 
the power of the purse to deliver the 
lifesaving changes that the people de-
serve. We need a Green New Deal. 
For my birthday, please join me in 
fighting for one everywhere. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
amazing, whether we are talking about 
the Bronx, New York; St. Louis, Mis-
souri; or New Mexico, it is obvious that 
a Green New Deal is needed now. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to close 
by returning to one particular aspect 
of the Green New Deal for Public 
Schools because I think it highlights 
something about the framework as a 
whole. For me, one of the most excit-
ing parts of the Green New Deal for 
Public Schools is how the learning en-
vironment in every school will be en-
riched, putting our young people at the 
center of the green energy revolution. 
Students will delve into every aspect 
of the building retrofit process and im-
merse themselves in the broader sus-
tainability and social challenges that 
we are tackling as a society. Each 
school will become a living lab for the 
Green New Deal. I cannot think of a 
better way to nurture the curiosity, in-
genuity, and imaginations of our chil-
dren. We will be kick-starting climate, 
STEM, and STEAM careers across the 
United States, and our country will 
reap the benefits of all that creativity. 
The Green New Deal for Public 
Schools and the entire Green New Deal 
framework is built on the foundation of 
care and healing and allowing everyone 
in this country to unlock their full po-
tential. 
This is an idea that is expressed in 
Tupac Shakur’s brilliant poem ‘‘The 
Rose That Grew from Concrete.’’ 
Did you hear about the rose that grew from 
a crack in the concrete? 
Proving nature’s law is wrong it learned to 
walk without having feet. 
Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams, 
it learned to breathe fresh air. 
Long live the rose that grew from concrete 
when no one else ever cared. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. NEHLS) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the great State 
of Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration and Democrat 
House leadership want to cap off their 
first 6 months with an additional $3.5 
trillion in massive bills which will be 
the largest expansion of government 
ever. 
Let’s review the past 6 months. Prior 
to the Biden administration, on a bi-
partisan basis we here in this Congress 
allocated $3.7 trillion for COVID relief 
and recovery on a bipartisan basis. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
through a completely partisan spend-
ing bill spent $1.9 trillion, three times 
more than many thought was nec-
essary, and many Democrat economists 
also felt that way, especially since 
GDP growth was hitting record levels, 
clearly indicating American recovery. 
b 1615 
Now we are experiencing inflation at 
really historic levels. Milk, bread, 
fruit, gasoline, among other items, 
have seen price increases, taxing all 
Americans. 
Unemployment 
remains 
very high in States that continue to 
extend and enhanced unemployment 
insurance. Meanwhile, virtually all em-
ployers have a shortfall in their work-
force and are looking for employees. 
Additionally, illegal immigration is 
at an all-time high. We see the mess at 
the border with no real corrections 
being made by the Biden administra-
tion or the Democrat-led House. Crime 
is hitting record levels in urban and 
suburban American. Oil imports from 
Russia are at an all-time high while we 
restrict energy production here at 
home, and China’s economy is roaring. 
We receive no cooperation from the 
CCP or the WHO, regarding investiga-
tions into the origins of COVID–19. Ad-
ditionally, 
cyberattacks 
originating 
from China and Russia have presented 
a huge threat to American businesses 
large and small, yet, we have little to 
no response from the Biden administra-
tion or from our Democratic leadership 
here in the House. 
Now the Democrats are putting a bi-
partisan transportation infrastructure 
bill in jeopardy that was agreed upon 
because they insist on spending $3.5 
trillion-plus for all kinds of govern-
ment expansion initiatives, including 
expansions in Medicaid, ObamaCare, 
EPA, IRS, and I could go on. 
This reckless expansion of govern-
ment after $5 trillion in spending will 
rock our economy, destroy career op-
portunities, create permanent depend-
ency on government, and saddle our fu-
ture American generations with debt 
well beyond what the eye can see or 
what the mind can contemplate. 
Say ‘‘no’’ to reconciliation. Say 
‘‘yes’’ to a bipartisan transportation 
infrastructure bill. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my dear friend for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. JACKSON), my 
great friend. 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to a seri-
ous issue facing my home State of 
Texas and millions of Americans, the 
Biden border crisis. Things at our 
southern border have gotten worse by 
the day since Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS have taken office. 
For example, illegal immigration 
numbers were up 450 percent in June 
compared to June of last year. June 
was the fourth straight month with 
over 170,000 apprehensions. Border Pa-
trol officials have seized more fentanyl 
so far in 2021 than all of 2020. 
COVID cases among illegal immi-
grants are up 900 percent in the Rio 
Grande Valley. Numbers don’t lie. The 
Biden administration’s reckless ap-
proach to immigration has caused a 
full-blown crisis at the border, and 
there is absolutely nothing being done 
to stop it. 
To be clear, the public health and 
drug crises that have been exacerbated 
by what is happening at the border are 
not just a problem for border States. 
The drugs being smuggled in at the 
border are coming to a neighborhood 
near you, courtesy of Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
Their hypocrisy on the public health 
threat, in particular, couldn’t be more 
appalling. 
While 
pushing 
stringent 
COVID rules on the American people, 
the Biden administration is simulta-
neously pushing an open-border agenda 
that includes placing COVID-infected 
illegal immigrants all over this coun-
try. It is absolutely unbelievable. 
Every American will ultimately be 
impacted in some way by this Biden 
border crisis. I plea with the President 
to reverse his failed immigration plan 
and start protecting the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. JACKSON for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I 
will address tonight the many, many 
serious issues facing our country: the 
unprecedented crisis at our southern 
border; the highest inflation we have 
seen in 13 years; the Democrats’ out-of- 
control spending and tax increases; the 
Democrats’ undermining of the Hyde 
amendment; and the Democrats’ de-
fense of the Communist Cuba regime.

July 21, 2021 
It is important we discuss these 
issues as Republicans, because our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
they just won’t. We owe it to the Amer-
ican people to do better than this; to 
ensure there is still a country left 
when our children grow up. 
The way the Democrats and the 
Biden 
administration 
are 
spending 
money, and our open borders, should 
not just concern Republicans, but 
every American. That is why I am 
proud of the way my colleagues and I 
will bring these issues straight to the 
American people in the people’s House. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleagues for their partici-
pation tonight. I know that we don’t 
have anyone else here, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ RECKLESS SPENDING 
AGENDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, when you pull into a 
gas station or visit a grocery store this 
week, you will notice something dif-
ferent. Consumer prices are up across 
the board. Make no mistake, this fi-
nancial strain is a direct result of the 
Biden administration’s out-of-control 
spending. It is hurting millions of 
Americans across the Nation. In fact, 
nearly 9 in 10 Americans have reported 
a serious concern about the rise in 
prices. The reality is inflation, perhaps 
more accurately called Biden-flation, 
which is climbing at the highest rate in 
13 years. Gas prices are up 45 percent; 
used car prices up 45 percent; and the 
cost of breakfast, lunch, and dinner has 
gone up for every single family. 
These staples are necessities for 
every family in this country and their 
prices are rising because of the Demo-
crats’ reckless spending agenda. There 
is no doubt that the Democrats’ non-
stop Big Government spending is plac-
ing tremendous financial stress on the 
American 
family. 
What 
is 
worse, 
Democrats have failed to acknowledge 
that their outrageous spending has the 
most devastating impact on low-in-
come Americans, many of whom have 
to spend beyond their means to afford 
the basic cost of goods and services. 
Let me make this very clear. Infla-
tion is a regressive tax that dispropor-
tionately affects the poor. Democrats 
are completely out of touch with the 
American people. To them, inflation is 
transitory; nothing to worry about. To 
the North Carolinians that I represent 
and speak with every day, inflation is 
now a real and present problem. 
What is the Democrats’ solution to 
soaring prices and high prices? Bor-
rowing more money, another $3.5 tril-
lion of taxpayer money to put toward 
new spending and tax hikes. 
There is a life lesson here. If you are 
in a hole, stop digging. 
Republicans understand that in most 
households, every dollar counts. But in 
Biden’s economy, all Americans are 
having to pay more now to get less. We 
must reverse these disastrous policy 
decisions to save jobs, protect long- 
term investments, sustain economic 
progress, and most importantly, keep 
more money in taxpayers’ pockets. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
SUPPORTING CUBAN PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
ROUZER) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in absolute and unequivocal sup-
port of the Cuban people protesting 
their evil and oppressive Communist 
regime. Unfortunately, there is noth-
ing new about their brutality and will-
ful violations of universally recognized 
human 
rights. 
The 
United 
States 
should make it very clear that we 
stand on the side of the Cuban people 
as thousands have joined one of the 
biggest 
anti-Communist 
demonstra-
tions the country has witnessed during 
its 62-year dictatorship. 
Since the protests began, hundreds 
have been detained or are missing, in-
cluding: artists, peace activists, and 
priests. The Cuban people deserve and 
need our help. In the words of the late 
Senator Jesse Helms: 
The United States must speak out clearly 
on behalf of those whose own voices are 
choked by Communist repression. 
Despite what many of our own people 
have been brainwashed by our edu-
cation systems to believe, America is 
the greatest force for freedom and lib-
erty that the world has ever known. I 
implore this administration, the Biden 
administration, and this Congress to 
utilize every tool of the U.S. Govern-
ment to support the Cuban people in 
their effort to defeat the Communist 
regime and break the shackles of its 
oppressive government. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ad-
dress the Chamber on what I believe is 
the 
biggest 
crisis 
facing 
America 
today. I spent last week down at the 
McAllen section of the U.S.-Mexico 
border, and what I saw horrified me. 
Late at night, from 10 to 11 o’clock, I 
watched people from all around the 
world walking on a pathway from the 
Rio Grande River to the Border Patrol 
station. We are right now at a point 
where I believe over 70,000 people a 
month are being allowed in the coun-
try. Many of these people have no ID at 
all, so there is no way to confirm who 
they are, to even see if they have a 
criminal record. 
b 1630 
Upon being processed through the 
border station, even without an ID, we 
buy them plane tickets for all around 
the country. 
Scandalously, at a time when we are 
talking about COVID again, even if 
they test positive, people are held in 
apartments or hotels and not guarded, 
so they turn around and are being re-
leased. At a time in which we are sup-
posed to be more careful than ever, we 
have a situation in which people who 
are coming here illegally are allowed 
in the country. 
Furthermore, we watch as we have 
hit new records for the number of peo-
ple who are killed in this country by il-
legal 
drug 
overdoses, 
including 
fentanyl. We are up to 90,000 people in 
the last year. I believe the reason we 
are hitting all-time records is because, 
as bad as heroin is, fentanyl is far 
worse. And all or virtually all of that 
fentanyl is coming across the southern 
border. 
Meanwhile, we cede control of our 
immigration policy to Mexican drug 
gangs. These gangs charge, depending 
upon where you are coming from, 
$3,000, $10,000, $20,000 to come across 
the border. They are so heartless that 
it is not uncommon that if Border Pa-
trol approaches them on a boat from 
the Mexican side to the American side, 
whether it is with people or with drugs, 
they will throw a 3- or 4-year-old child 
into the Rio Grande River, knowing 
that our Border Patrol will fight to 
save that child rather than go after the 
people sneaking in the country or 
going after the drugs. This is the bru-
tal type of people we are assisting by 
continuing the current policy or lack 
of a policy. 
I strongly urge the Biden administra-
tion to step up to the plate to make 
sure that COVID-positive people are no 
longer let into the country; bring back 
the old policy, the migrant protection 
protocol, when we had only 6,000 people 
a month rather than 70,000 people a 
month crossing the border; require 
some sort of photo ID, like every other 
American would have before they get 
on an airline. 
Good grief, who knows what type of 
criminal records these people have. Of 
course, we can only check criminal 
records in the United States. Nobody 
has any idea if these people have hor-
rific criminal records in Honduras, El 
Salvador, Brazil, or all the other coun-
tries that people are coming here from. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age the Biden administration to step 
up. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the freedom 
fighters in Cuba and against com-
munism, the very system of social, po-
litical, and economic oppression that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 21, 2021 
has brought misery, poverty, and death 
to the Cuban people. 
As the struggle of the Cuban people 
continues, I am calling on President 
Biden and his administration to take 
decisive measures in support of the 
Cuban protestors. 
Specifically, I am calling on him to: 
condemn the communist Cuban regime 
for their decades of oppression; con-
demn the communist Cuban regime for 
any acts of violence against peaceful 
protestors; condemn the evils of com-
munism that have led to misery, pov-
erty, and stifled basic and fundamental 
human rights; support the mission of 
the protesters in Cuba, which includes 
establishing free and democratic elec-
tions, releasing all political prisoners, 
and establishing a free and independent 
press; and commit to the United States 
continuing its policy of maximum pres-
sure on the communist Cuban regime 
until fundamental democratic reforms 
take hold. 
On a personal note, I immigrated to 
this country with my family when I 
was a young boy, just 6 years old. I 
lived through the indoctrination cur-
riculum in elementary school. I wit-
nessed my birth country crumble to 
the woes of communism. Luckily, my 
family and I had the opportunity to 
immigrate to this great country. 
In just one generation, my family 
went from Cuba to Congress. I believe 
with all my heart and soul that in no 
other country in the world is that 
achievement possible. 
I am heartened to see my fellow Cu-
bans on the island wave the symbol of 
freedom, our American flag, as they de-
mand the same freedoms that we take 
for granted. 
For that reason, I will always stand 
firmly on the side of all who yearn for 
freedom and democracy. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to share my concerns for 
the crisis we are seeing at the southern 
border and the obvious unwillingness of 
the 
Biden-Harris 
administration 
to 
provide solutions. 
Illegal border crossings are at their 
highest level in two decades. Yet, this 
administration not only won’t address 
it; they actually exacerbate it because 
they cut the CBP budget over $900 mil-
lion. 
In June alone, border agents actually 
encountered over 188,000 people at our 
southern border. Madam Speaker, that 
is a 450 percent increase over last June. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration created this invasion, this bor-
der crisis. This year alone, over 80,000 
kids have crossed the border, with 
15,000 remaining in government cus-
tody. 
Fixing the crisis at the border re-
quires an investment in manpower, in-
frastructure, technology, and strong 
policy. That is why I asked this body 
to plus-up $300 million in next year’s 
budget for Operation Stonegarden, to 
reimburse border States like Texas 
that are actually stepping up at the 
State level to provide security for their 
constituents. 
We must finish the wall, reinstate 
the remain in Mexico policy, and never 
bring back catch and release, which the 
Biden administration is rumored to be 
bringing back in the coming months. 
A strong America begins and ends 
with a strong, safe, and secure border. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 20 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the horrible inflation 
crisis we are seeing in this country. 
I can remember back to the terrible 
inflation period of the 1970s, and I al-
ways hoped we would never return 
back to those times. Unfortunately, 
what I see coming lately, it is looking 
very similar. 
With the lifting of the pandemic re-
strictions and the increasing rate of 
vaccinations, many Americans are get-
ting back to their normal routine. 
Many are dining out, traveling, and en-
joying social events again. 
While this is great news, virtually 
every American is noticing a massive 
increase in the price of nearly every-
thing because of the unprecedented in-
flation caused by the Biden administra-
tion’s reckless spending and willing-
ness to pay people to sit at home in-
stead of work. 
Inflation has increased every single 
month since Biden has taken office. 
The Consumer Price Index has in-
creased more than 5 percent over a 
year ago, which is the largest jump 
since just before the 2008 financial cri-
sis. 
Gas prices have increased 45 percent 
compared to last year; food prices have 
increased more than 2 percent; and 
consumer prices overall are up near 5 
percent. 
While these numbers may not con-
cern President Biden, they are abso-
lutely killing the working class. The 
Biden administration’s failures have 
real consequences, and his policies are 
crushing the working- and middle-class 
families across Alabama and through-
out our Nation. 
The working class is the backbone of 
this Nation, so I urge President Biden 
and my colleagues across the aisle to 
get serious about addressing this crisis 
and get to work building the economy 
that benefits all Americans. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise to-
night because I am outraged by the 
Biden administration’s lack of effort to 
protect our Nation from the invasion of 
illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico 
border. 
I have visited our southern border 
twice now this year, and I can say, 
without a shadow of a doubt, it is a 
full-blown catastrophe on every front: 
humanitarian, national security, and 
public health. 
President Biden’s irrational reversal 
of the Trump administration’s border 
security policies, like canceling con-
struction of the border wall, reversing 
the remain in Mexico policy, and send-
ing mixed messages about America’s 
southern border, is why we face this 
unmitigated disaster today. 
There has been a surge of crossings, 
with more than 188,000 border crossings 
reported in June, a 450 percent increase 
from just a year ago. 
On top of that, more than 7,500 new 
COVID cases were reported in deten-
tion centers from April through the be-
ginning of July—a surge at the border, 
a surge of COVID. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
agents have seized 7,450 pounds of 
fentanyl so far this year, enough to kill 
every American several times over, and 
it is just getting worse. 
States across the country are feeling 
the consequences of the border crisis, 
including my home State of Tennessee. 
Although our State is 1,000 miles from 
the southern border, Tennesseans will 
bear the brunt of this disaster in many 
ways, including in our school systems, 
healthcare systems, and police depart-
ments, as planeloads of illegal immi-
grants are offloaded in our commu-
nities. 
We must reestablish law and order at 
the southern border by finishing the 
border wall, fully reinstating the re-
main in Mexico policy, robustly imple-
menting title 42 authority, and sending 
a clear message that our borders are 
not open to illegal crossings. 
When it comes to the border crisis, 
Americans, including Tennesseans, are 
looking for leadership, not denials, de-
flections, and distractions from our 
sleepy leaders in the White House. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, Americans are seeing the im-
pacts of inflation every day, with ris-
ing costs everywhere from the gas 
pump to the grocery store. California 
workers and families are bearing the 
brunt of this nationwide, 13-year infla-
tion high. 
Prices of everyday goods in my State 
are, in many cases, higher than the na-
tional average. For example, the aver-
age price of a gallon of regular gasoline 
in California’s 39th District is more 
than $1 higher than the national aver-
age. 
Additionally, these higher costs come 
in addition to high State and local 
taxes, cost of living, and astronomical 
housing costs. June statistics showed 
the median housing price in my dis-
trict rose more than 20 percent, with 
the median price of a single-family 
home being more than $800,000. 
That is why I am disappointed that 
instead of working with Republicans to 
address inflation, get Americans back

to work, and support small businesses, 
Democrats are moving forward with 
trillions more in Federal spending on a 
partisan wish list that will cause in-
creased Federal debt, an even higher 
cost of living, and more money out of 
the pockets of hardworking taxpayers. 
We should be making life more af-
fordable, not less. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona 
(Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I want 
to talk about the border. I live in a 
border State. I have been to the border 
a number of times. But last week, I got 
to go to the border again in Nogales, 
Arizona. I can attest firsthand that 
there is a crisis at our border. 
I talked to Customs and Border Pa-
trol agents and other officials, and 
they all have said that this is the worst 
that they have seen it in their entire 
career, and some of them have worked 
for 30 years for Customs and Border 
Protection. 
I went down in a tunnel with the CBP 
officers, and it smelled. There was 
trash everywhere. And these Customs 
and Border Protection officers have to 
monitor the tunnels for human traf-
ficking, sex trafficking, and drug traf-
ficking. 
b 1645 
At one of the ports of entry in 
Nogales, the Mariposa port of entry, 
they have seized, in the first 12 days of 
July, 500,000 fentanyl pills. Do you 
know how many people that can kill? 
I call on the Biden administration to 
do something about the border crisis. 
The policies that he has set forth are 
causing this problem. 
I visited parts of the border fence 
where there are just big openings, but 
the material is laying there right on 
the ground. We have already paid for 
it. This is insanity. It is total insanity. 
I also heard that the Biden adminis-
tration wants to repeal title 42, which 
is the one thing that is causing it from 
being more of a disaster. 
Madam Speaker, I ask Mr. Biden, 
KAMALA
HARRIS, Democrats, please 
help us secure the border. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. WITTMAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, our 
Nation should be in the midst of a 
booming economic recovery. 
Unfortunately, what we see is the 
exact opposite. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have 
consistently 
warned 
against 
wasteful government spending, and the 
real harm that it would cause not only 
to our economy, but to the everyday 
lives of Americans. 
And this was even before President 
Biden began pushing through this reck-
less government spending agenda that 
will raise taxes on American families, 
destroy jobs, and saddle future genera-
tions with a massive debt. 
It has also created another crisis: in-
flation—something House Republicans 
warned would occur as a result of the 
President’s massive increase in govern-
ment spending and mismanagement of 
the economy. Inflation is a tax on all 
Americans, and it has increased every 
month since President Biden took of-
fice. 
The Consumer Price Index increased 
5.4 percent from a year ago. This is the 
largest jump since just before the 2008 
financial crisis. 
Business owners are worried. Nearly 
half of America’s small businesses have 
no choice but to raise their prices be-
cause the cost to do business is sky-
rocketing. And that means consumers 
end up paying more. 
The Biden administration has at-
tempted to downplay the harmful ef-
fects of inflation, claiming it will re-
solve itself in the next few months, but 
top economists project that inflation is 
here to stay. 
Worse yet, now our Democratic col-
leagues 
are 
attempting 
to 
push 
through a partisan $3.5 trillion package 
that is nothing more than a reckless 
tax-and-spending spree, which will in-
deed stick more families with higher 
taxes and lower wages. 
Madam Speaker, make no mistake 
about it, these are not just numbers. 
Americans across the country are 
spending more money on everyday 
goods and services. 
Now more than ever it is critical that 
we are supporting our workers and 
families and making sure they succeed. 
We should be focused on supporting 
policies that create more jobs, spur 
growth and innovation, and put more 
money in the pockets of hardworking 
Americans. 
The President’s and our Democratic 
colleagues’ plans are doing the oppo-
site. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, in October of 2019, California 
passed legislation requiring public uni-
versities to provide chemical abortion 
pills to female students starting in 
2023. 
Chemical abortions have increased. 
Actually, it has skyrocketed in the 
past 20 years from just 5 percent in 2001 
to 39 percent of all abortions in 2017. 
We want women across the country 
to know that we are there for them as 
a pro-life movement, and there are so 
many other safe options other than 
choosing abortion. 
Congress must act now, not just to 
protect innocent babies from abortion, 
but to protect the vulnerable women 
from the lies of the abortion industry 
and the potential horrible physical, 
emotional, and spiritual damage of 
having a chemical abortion. 
This is why I have joined Congress-
man CHIP
ROY
and Senator STEVE 
DAINES in introducing the Protecting 
Life on College Campus Act. 
The Protecting Life on College Cam-
pus Act would uphold the Hyde amend-
ment and prohibit Federal funds to go 
to universities that provide chemical 
abortion pills to students. 
This would be another step in the 
right direction to save the lives of the 
unborn and protect the safety of 
women and our families. 
The fight for life in the United States 
has never been more important than 
today. For the first time in 40 years, 
the Hyde amendment was excluded 
from the spending bill introduced in 
Congress. 
Further, it was even cleared by the 
House Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Labor and Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
The rest of my Republican colleagues 
and I are ready to fight and demand 
that Hyde be reinstated into this year’s 
bill. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to express my support for the 
Cuban people. 
After decades of enduring an oppres-
sive Communist regime, the people of 
Cuba deserve freedom. 
Last week, we watched as Cubans 
proudly 
waved 
the 
American 
flag 
through the streets and peacefully ad-
vocated for the freedom our flag rep-
resents. 
Unfortunately, as Cubans marched, 
many of my colleagues across the aisle 
have remained silent or, worse, they 
have wrongfully blamed the United 
States or even suggested these protests 
were in response to COVID–19. 
Let me be clear: The embargo isn’t 
responsible for young children who 
have been forced into joining the police 
force. The embargo isn’t responsible for 
cutting off internet access. It is the 
failed Communist system, a system so 
full of corruption and greed that medi-
cine, food, and gas shortages are sadly 
the norm. 
Crowds 
chanting 
‘‘Freedom’’ 
and 
‘‘Down with the dictatorship’’ are clear 
cries for relief from six decades of suf-
fering. 
History has shown us that com-
munism has always failed, leaving 
those who must live under its restric-
tive rule to suffer. 
I have witnessed these atrocities and 
failure of communism firsthand, and I 
have dedicated my life to fighting 
against it. 
I am proud to stand in solidarity 
with the people of Cuba as they fight to 
end the Communist rule that has ru-
ined their nation. I hope my colleagues 
will consider doing the same. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a free Cuba. As the 
Cuban people cry out to the free world 
for democracy, communism works re-
lentlessly 
to 
silence 
their 
voices 
through violence and censorship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3800 
July 21, 2021 
Among my best friends growing up in 
Arkansas were the wonderful Villalon 
family, who fled Cuba and escaped the 
tyranny of Castro. I was best friends 
with the kids in elementary school. 
The father of the family was a leader in 
our church and our Boy Scout troop, 
and the mother was my Spanish teach-
er. 
The Villalon family had the oppor-
tunity to grow up in a free country, 
one that provided jobs, opportunities, 
and freedoms that every human should 
have access to. Unfortunately for my 
friends in Arkansas, it took them flee-
ing their homeland and escaping the 
grips of communism to get a taste of 
the freedoms that we Americans enjoy 
each and every day. 
During my career I have seen first-
hand the systematic destruction of 
commerce, community, and human 
spirit by communism. 
So, Madam Speaker, I stand with the 
Cuban people, and I call on our Na-
tion’s leaders to do what we can to sup-
port a new and free Cuba. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Americans everywhere are feeling the 
real effects of inflation due to the 
Democrats’ reckless spending spree. 
Basic 
and 
time-tested 
economics 
show that more money in the market-
place leads to inflation, especially 
when it is created by new debt. 
Families across the country are pay-
ing $10, $20, $30 more on groceries each 
week. Gas prices are up nearly 50 per-
cent. 
Remember the ads for the $6 burger 
that used to be $3.99? You used to see it 
on TV. Well, they are actually going to 
be $6 pretty soon the way things are 
going. 
Democrats claim that they are work-
ing for the American people. Their 
policies are, in fact, hitting middle- 
class families hard. The American peo-
ple are noticing. 
It is no coincidence that inflation has 
increased every month during the 
Biden administration. They need to un-
derstand that all the money they keep 
spending directly and negatively im-
pacts real Americans. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the troubling impact 
that inflation is having on the Amer-
ican people. 
Raising a family during good eco-
nomic times is hard enough, but times 
of high inflation make it even more 
difficult. With prices rising at paces 
not seen since 1991, families are being 
forced to make tough decisions and 
stretch their paychecks even further. 
During his Presidential campaign, 
Joe Biden promised not to raise taxes 
on anyone making less than $400,000 per 
year. However, his spending habit is 
fueling inflation, which is a tax on 
every American. In fact, it is worse 
than an ordinary tax because it is re-
gressive, hitting the working class the 
hardest. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Democrats 
would have the American people be-
lieve that debt doesn’t matter, and 
that the government can spend an end-
less amount of money on whatever 
they like. However, that could not be 
further from the truth. 
To stop the cost of things from accel-
erating even higher, we must end our 
spending addiction and get the na-
tional debt under control. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time we have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the remainder to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to stand for the 
people of Cuba who are marching 
against the Communist government 
that has oppressed them for decades. 
In recent weeks, the Cuban activists 
have been kidnapped, jailed, and mur-
dered for daring to stand against the 
Communist regime. 
Now is the time to stand against this 
brutality. We must urge world leaders 
to cease all support for the Communist 
regime in Cuba. 
We must ensure that Cubans can 
communicate freely with each other 
and with the outside world. We must 
forcefully denounce the Cuban dicta-
torship 
that 
has 
committed 
these 
crimes. 
The Cuban people are rising up in the 
name of opportunity, the opportunity 
that they see just 90 miles away on the 
American shores. 
As the Cuban people protest in the 
streets, they are chanting, ‘‘Libertad,’’ 
liberty. They are carrying American 
flags, and they are calling out for free-
dom. 
Now is the time for us to stand with 
them. It is time to put an end to the 
murderous regime that has held the 
people of Cuba hostage for the past 61 
years. 
Freedom. Freedom for all. Freedom 
for Cuba. Let them see what we have 
here. Let them attain that freedom.

Let us pray. 
Almighty God, who remains the same

Guide our Senators in the footsteps 
of those who were willing to risk all for 
freedom, who carved tunnels of hope

Lord, uphold our Nation with Your 
wisdom and might, enabling it to con-
tinue to be a city of refuge for those 
whose hearts yearn for freedom. 
Keep us all from untimely and self-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
before I get into the substance of my 
remarks, I just heard Leader MCCON-
NELL’s statements on debt ceiling. 
The leader’s statements on debt ceil-
ing are shameless, cynical, and totally 
political. This debt is Trump debt. It is 
COVID debt. Democrats joined three 
times during the Trump administra-
tion to do the responsible thing. The 
bottom line is that Leader MCCONNELL 
should not be playing political games 
with the full faith and credit of the 
United States. Americans pay their 
debts. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, now, let’s get into 
what is happening here in the Senate 
this afternoon. 
The Senate will hold a procedural 
vote to get the legislative process 
started on a bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. I have been very clear about what 
this vote is. This vote is only the first 
step in the legislative process on the 
Senate floor. It is merely a vote about 
whether the Senate is ready to begin 
debating a bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. 
I have also been very clear about 
what this vote is not. This vote is not 
a deadline to have every final detail 
worked out. It is not an attempt to jam 
anyone. If Senators agree to adopt the 
motion 
to 
proceed, 
the 
bipartisan 
group of Senators will have many op-
portunities to make their agreement 
the base of the bill, even if they need a 
few more days to finalize the language. 
My colleagues are well aware that we 
often agree to move forward with de-
bates on issues before we have the final 
text of the bill in hand. We have done 
it twice this year already: the anti- 
Asian hate crimes bill and the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act. Both 
times, the Senate produced successful 
bipartisan legislation. There is no rea-
son we can’t repeat that process here 
on infrastructure. 
We are now in the fourth week of ne-
gotiations since the bipartisan group of 
Senators reached an agreement with 
the White House on an infrastructure 
framework—4 weeks. According to the 
negotiators, spurred on by this vote 
this afternoon, they are close to final-
izing their product. Even Republicans 
have agreed that the deadline has 
moved them far more quickly. 
Given the process of the bipartisan 
negotiations, I believe Senators should 
feel comfortable voting to move for-
ward today. I know that, since I set a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4992 
July 21, 2021 
date for the vote and announced it, my 
colleagues on both sides have worked 
very hard on finishing this legislation. 
I am grateful for their work. We all 
want the same thing here: to pass a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. But in 
order to finish the bill, we first need to 
start. 
So I hope my Republican colleagues 
will join Democrats this afternoon in 
voting to move forward on an infra-
structure package. As majority leader, 
I have every intention of passing both 
major infrastructure packages, the bi-
partisan infrastructure framework and 
a budget resolution with reconciliation 
instructions, before we leave for the 
August recess. That is the schedule I 
laid out at the end of June, and that is 
the schedule I intend to stick to. 
Now, if Senators had any doubt about 
the impact of this important work, 
they should be assured by a new report 
this morning by the chief economist at 
Moody’s, Mark Zandi. Having analyzed 
both the bipartisan bill and the agree-
ment by Senate Democrats on the 
Budget Committee, Mark Zandi con-
cludes that the twin legislative pack-
ages will provide a massive boost to 
the economy and that both—both—are 
essential. 
Specifically, his report says that the 
two bills are ‘‘designed to lift the 
economy’s longer-term growth poten-
tial and ease’’—ease—‘‘inflation pres-
sures.’’ Again, despite the sometimes 
hysterical warnings about inflation 
from Republicans, the chief economist 
at Moody’s concludes that those con-
cerns are ‘‘misplaced,’’ ‘‘overdone,’’ 
and that our two infrastructure bills 
are designed to ‘‘ease’’—his words—‘‘in-
flation pressures.’’ 
The report goes on to say that our in-
vestments in infrastructure and social 
programs will ‘‘lift productivity and 
labor force growth’’ and ‘‘direct the 
benefits of the stronger growth to 
lower-income Americans and address 
the long-running skewing of the in-
come and wealth distribution.’’ 
In other words, it will help strength-
en the middle class and those trying to 
get there and not have all the income, 
so much of the income, disproportion-
ately flowing to the top 1 and 10 per-
cents. 
I hope my colleagues are listening to 
those benefits: long-term economic 
growth, easing inflation pressures, lift-
ing productivity, strengthening the 
labor force, reducing income inequal-
ity. That is what one of the Nation’s 
leading economists predicts our two in-
frastructure bills will achieve. 
The report by Moody’s should light a 
fire under all of us. I will be sending 
the full report to the Senate Demo-
cratic conference, and I commend it to 
my Republican colleagues to read as 
well. 
It has been decades since this Cham-
ber has made significant stand-alone 
investment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. We are the largest economy in 
the world, but our infrastructure ranks 
13th. You would find better infrastruc-
ture in the United Arab Emirates than 
in the United States. Meanwhile, mid-
dle-class and working Americans have 
watched the American dream fall out 
of reach as globalization, technology, 
and vicious inequalities of income have 
sapped much of America’s fundamental 
promise 
of 
equal 
economic 
oppor-
tunity. 
We must restore that promise, that 
hope, that American dream. If we want 
Americans to prosper in the 21st cen-
tury, if we want to restore that funda-
mental promise, we need to invest in 
our infrastructure, create jobs, support 
families, strengthen the backbone of 
the middle class, help underserved 
communities, and rekindle the sunny 
optimism that has been a hallmark of 
the American spirit for more than two 
centuries. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, the Democratic leader appears 
to be intent on calling a vote he knows 
will fail. For several weeks now, Re-
publican 
and 
Democratic 
Senators 
have been working together, trying to 
assemble a bipartisan package for our 
Nation’s infrastructure. 
It is an important and a complex sub-
ject. 
They 
are 
talking 
about 
big 
projects and big sums of money. They 
are still talking, still working, still ne-
gotiating in good faith across the aisle. 
But these discussions have yet to con-
clude. There is no outcome yet, no bi-
partisan agreement, no text, nothing 
for the Congressional Budget Office to 
evaluate, and, certainly, nothing on 
which to vote, not yet. 
So, obviously, if the Democratic 
leader tries to force a cloture vote on a 
bill that does not exist, it will fail. 
Around here, we typically write the 
bills before we vote on them. That is 
the custom. Of course, here in the Sen-
ate, a failed cloture vote does not mean 
no forever. 
In the middle of the early COVID cri-
sis, back in March of 2020, with Ameri-
cans under stay-home orders and finan-
cial 
markets 
plummeting, 
Senate 
Democrats withheld cloture on the 
CARES Act multiple times so they 
could continue haggling behind the 
scenes. 
Now, this was during a real emer-
gency. Every day, every hour, was cru-
cial. But Senate Democrats blocked 
cloture multiple times until various 
details were fine-tuned to their liking. 
Here is what the Democratic leader 
said while his side tanked those cloture 
votes last March—March of 2020: 
The Majority Leader was well aware of 
how this vote would go before it happened, 
but he chose to move forward with it any-
way, even though negotiations are con-
tinuing. So who is playing games? 
That was the Democratic leader in 
March of 2020, in the middle of a na-
tional emergency. 
That, of course, was a fast-moving 
global crisis, with bipartisan text al-
ready in hand. There was a bill. Yet 
Senate Democrats insisted on taking 
their time in the middle of this na-
tional 100-year pandemic. Now, we are 
talking about long-term infrastructure 
investments that will play out over 
many years, but he wants to vote be-
fore any agreement even exists. 
So this stunt is set to fail. The 
Democratic leader will be free to 
change his vote and move to reconsider 
whenever a bipartisan product actually 
exists. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, President Biden campaigned on a 
pledge not to raise income taxes on the 
vast majority of Americans. But the 
latest 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree that Democrats are cooking up 
would crush our country with a his-
toric set of sweeping tax hikes. 
Here is one of the targets in their 
crosshairs: Family farms. 
It appears our colleagues’ plan will 
eliminate tax rules that allow family 
property to be passed down to the next 
generation without facing a new dev-
astating tax burden. 
Without the fix in question—the so- 
called stepped-up basis for capital 
gains taxes—scores of family busi-
nesses across America will feel a mas-
sive squeeze. 
In States like mine, family farms 
drive the rural economy. But as I have 
heard from many of my State’s family 
farmers, it is operations like theirs 
that 
are 
especially—especially—at 
risk. 
One Kentucky farmer said his family 
has worked the same land in Muhlen-
berg County for 150 years. He had 
hoped—hoped—to one day pass his 
property along to his children, just like 
it was passed along to him. But after 
generations spent improving and in-
vesting in the same farm, he is worried 
it could all be gone in the blink of an 
eye. 
Another Kentuckian described how 
her family, like many farmers, is asset 
rich but cash poor. If the stepped-up 
basis is eliminated, her family could 
lose the home, barns, machinery, and 
fields that have been their life’s work. 
The Farm Bureau in my State 
warned that what Washington Demo-
crats are trying to do would penalize 
farmers for wanting—for wanting—to 
continue a tradition, which we all de-
pend upon. If the stepped-up basis is 
eliminated, generations of accumu-
lated work would be ripped—literally 
ripped from the hands of America’s 
farming families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4993 
July 21, 2021 
Family farming in the Common-
wealth isn’t just a way of life; it is con-
sidered a birthright. But if Democrats 
foist this bill for their reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree on rural America, a 
lot of this heritage could be literally 
ripped out of families’ hands and put 
on the auction block. 
And who will gobble it up then? Who 
will buy this land? 
One recent report suggested that one 
of the biggest bidders for American 
family farmland these days is actually 
the Chinese. 
Later today, Ranking Member BOOZ-
MAN and some of our colleagues on the 
Agriculture Committee will be coming 
to the floor to sound the alarm about 
the ways that Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spend spree could threaten farm 
families and rural America. 
Deaths should not be a taxable event. 
The family farms that help feed us de-
serve our support, not sabotage from 
Washington. 
IRAN 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
earlier this month, the FBI uncovered 
a 
plot 
by 
Iranian 
intelligence 
operatives to kidnap a journalist and 
vocal critic of the regime from her 
home in New York. 
Let me say that again: Iran tried to 
abduct a U.S. citizen right here—right 
here—on American soil. 
For years, Masih Alinejad has made a 
habit of getting under the mullahs’ 
skin. She has called out injustices and 
organized protests like White Wednes-
days, when women across Iran would 
challenge their nation’s strict dress 
code. 
The regime tried to lure Ms. Alinejad 
out of the U.S. to make her an easier 
target. That failed. So they decided to 
try something even more brazen. 
Federal prosecutors have charged 
four Iranians in a plot to kidnap Ms. 
Alinejad. But with the exception of one 
accomplice, those responsible for this 
outrageous planned assault on a U.S. 
citizen right here on U.S. soil won’t see 
the inside of a courtroom anytime 
soon. So without nonjudicial steps to 
impose consequences on the Islamic 
Republic, there will likely be no justice 
for Ms. Alinejad and her family. 
And why should Tehran think twice 
about trying again? 
Sadly, this has a familiar ring to it. 
Flagrant disregard for international 
law is certainly not a new addition to 
Tehran’s playbook. Remember, back in 
2011, Iranian intelligence was caught 
up in a plot to murder the Ambassador 
of Saudi Arabia to the United States 
by blowing up a restaurant right here 
in Washington. One of the Iranian offi-
cials indicted in that case is, actually, 
still at large. 
Of course, extrajudicial activities on 
American soil aren’t the only bits of 
Iranian behavior that read like old 
news. Ms. Alinejad has been vocally re-
minding us that Iran’s disgusting dis-
regard for human rights is not unique 
to American soil. Obviously, it is felt 
in Iran itself and throughout the Mid-
dle East. 
This spring, the skies over Israel 
were filled with reminders of Iran’s 
longstanding 
support 
for 
terrorist 
groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Bat-
tlefields in Syria and southern Arabian 
Peninsula testify to the strength of 
Iran’s proxies. 
And just this year, on President 
Biden’s watch, we have seen a surge—a 
surge—in attacks on U.S. interests and 
facilities in Iraq not seen since the 
height of our military presence in that 
country. 
So history continues to repeat itself 
in Tehran. And, unfortunately, the 
Biden administration appears keen— 
keen—to follow a familiar playbook of 
its 
own. 
Inexplicably, 
the 
White 
House’s response to Iran’s latest trou-
blemaking—now listen to this—has 
been to consider lifting sanctions and 
offering new concessions to produce a 
new nuclear deal. 
Iran just tried to kidnap an Amer-
ican right here in America. This is not 
the occasion to desperately reward bad 
behavior. It is time to work even more 
closely with our allies and partners in 
the regions to stare it down. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. CHIPMAN 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, I came down to the floor to dis-
cuss how the ‘‘defund the police’’ move-
ment has contributed to the surging 
crime we see around the country. And 
as I noted, the Democratic Party bears 
a substantial degree of responsibility 
to the situation we find ourselves in 
because this is a party that either ac-
tively contributed to defund the police 
rhetoric 
or 
implicitly 
endorsed 
it 
largely by staying silent. 
Now, however, Democrats have come 
to realize that attacking the police and 
the sharp spike in crime could hurt 
their electoral chances next year. And 
so the President and other Democrat 
leaders have, all of a sudden, an-
nounced their concern about rising 
crime rates. 
But as I said last week, they are still 
trying to have their cake and eat it, 
too, because missing from their mes-
saging is any real condemnation of 
defund the police rhetoric and the toll 
it has taken on our cities and police de-
partments. And their plans for con-
fronting the surge in crime are long on 
punishing gun dealers and gun manu-
facturers and short on going after 
those actually committing crimes. 
It is typical of Democrats, for whom 
fighting crimes seems to involve con-
trolling guns—specifically, guns owned 
by law-abiding gun owners—more than 
it involves controlling criminals. What 
Democrats should be doing is training 
their attention on violent offenders, 
traffickers, and gangs, and illegal 
straw purchases; not finding ways to 
saddle law-abiding gun owners with 
burdensome regulations because it is 
not law-abiding gun owners who are re-
sponsible for most of the gun crimes in 
this country. 
The majority of gun crimes are com-
mitted by individuals who have ob-
tained their guns illegally—illegally— 
which is why fighting these crimes 
should involve improving enforcement 
of our laws and increasing prosecution 
of those who violate them, not creating 
new laws that will only serve to fur-
ther burden the constitutionally guar-
anteed Second Amendment right of 
law-abiding individuals. 
Unfortunately, as I said, Democrats 
are following their usual playbook dur-
ing this recent crime surge, which they 
seem to see as a convenient excuse for 
pushing some of their gun control pri-
orities. 
The President recently delivered re-
marks on crime, and the first priority 
he discussed at length was going after 
federally 
licensed 
firearms 
dealers. 
That is right, firearm dealers. 
While we can all agree that firearms 
dealers who violate the law should be 
punished, the rogue gun dealers that 
the President refers to are only respon-
sible for a tiny fraction of guns being 
used in crimes. 
Going after gun dealers as one of 
your top law enforcement priorities is 
not going to do much to stem the ille-
gal flow of weapons or their use in 
crimes. Enforcement dollars and en-
forcement personnel are not endless. 
You can waste a lot of money and a lot 
of man-hours conducting checks of law- 
abiding gun dealers while criminals 
continue to use their illegally obtained 
weapons unchecked. 
Nowhere are President Biden’s prior-
ities more clear than in his choice of 
nominee to lead the ATF, which is the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives. 
David Chipman would come to the 
ATF directly from an organization 
where he has spent the past 5 years as 
a gun control advocate. He is well 
known for his at times extreme views 
on gun control and restricting the Sec-
ond Amendment, including his support 
for banning probably the most popular 
rifle in the United States. He supports 
a so-called assault weapons ban, which 
usually refers to banning certain guns 
for their accessories and their appear-
ance of lethality. But, alarmingly, he 
could not give a clear representation of 
how he would define such a policy in 
his confirmation hearing. 
Equally 
as 
troubling 
is 
Mr. 
Chipman’s clear disdain for gun own-
ers. He claimed that most individuals 
with concealed carry permits are either 
untrained or irresponsible. During the 
pandemic, he mocked law-abiding gun 
owners and condescendingly said that 
first-time gun owners should put their 
guns away in their cabinets behind the 
beef jerky—behind the beef jerky—that

they have presumably been saving for 
the apocalypse and only take out the 
weapons if ‘‘the zombies start to ap-
pear.’’ 
I appreciate Mr. Chipman’s long serv-
ice as an ATF special agent, but I have 
serious concerns that, as the head of 
the ATF, he would spend more time 
going after law-abiding gun owners 
than actual criminals. 
The fact that he spent years as a gun 
control advocate gives us a pretty 
strong indication of what his priorities 
are likely to be if he ends up heading 
this 
Bureau. 
While 
Mr. 
Chipman 
couldn’t make new gun laws as head of 
the ATF, he would certainly—I should 
say he could certainly have a hand in 
writing a whole lot of new regulations, 
regulations that could end up substan-
tially burdening Americans’ Second 
Amendment rights. 
ATF has already gotten away with 
the Biden gun control agenda with pro-
posed rules against firearms parts kits 
often used by hobbyists and widely 
used stabilizing braces, often referred 
to as pistol braces, first designed to 
help a disabled veteran safely fire a 
weapon. These regulations would turn 
millions of legal gun owners into po-
tential criminals, and David Chipman 
would be in charge of seeing them 
through. 
Moreover, his demeaning attitude to-
ward gun owners should also disqualify 
him from the ATF position. An indi-
vidual who regards law-abiding, gun- 
owning Americans as a bunch of un-
trained and irresponsible doomsday 
preppers waiting for the zombie apoca-
lypse has no business—no business— 
leading a gun enforcement Agency. 
The President, the Vice President, 
and Mr. Chipman may not like it, but 
the plain language of the Bill of Rights 
clearly guarantees the right of law- 
abiding Americans to own firearms. 
That right, like every other right guar-
anteed by our Constitution, must be re-
spected and protected, and those who 
exercise 
their 
Second 
Amendment 
rights deserve to be respected as well. 
I do not believe we can rely on Mr. 
Chipman to respect our Second Amend-
ment rights or the Americans who ex-
ercise them, which is why I cannot 
vote to confirm him as Director of the 
ATF. I encourage supporters of the 
Second Amendment on both sides of 
the aisle to oppose his nomination. 
Law-abiding, 
gun-owning 
Americans 
deserve better than Mr. Chipman to 
handle the ATF. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER ANN ABRUZZO 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you 
know, this pandemic has made it clear-
er than ever that our economy is work-
ing great for those at the very top but 
not for our workers. 
Saturday actually marks the 12th an-
niversary of the last time that we 
raised our Federal minimum wage. 
Twelve years. That is unacceptable, 
and our workers really deserve better. 
No one working 40 hours a week should 
be making wages so low, their family is 
living in poverty and they can’t even 
afford to pay for even their most basic 
needs. It is past time that we finally 
give workers, who are the backbone of 
our economy and have kept us going 
through this pandemic, a hard-earned 
and much deserved raise. 
Another important step the Senate 
can take to build back an economy 
that is stronger and fairer and works 
for everyone is to ensure that Agencies 
like the National Labor Relations 
Board work effectively and protect 
workers’ rights. Jennifer Abruzzo is 
the type of dedicated public servant 
who will make sure the NLRB is en-
forcing the law and protecting the 
rights of workers. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in voting to confirm her as general 
counsel of the NLRB. She has dedi-
cated her career to upholding the law 
and protecting workers from unfair 
treatment. 
She 
has 
won 
victories 
against companies that attempted to 
undermine workers’ right to organize 
and call for better wages. She has 23 
years of experience at the NLRB, in-
cluding her time serving as acting gen-
eral counsel, the role she is now nomi-
nated to fill. 
It is clear she has the right experi-
ence, qualifications, and values for the 
job, and we need her to be able to get 
to work right away because we have 
seen 7 years of—we have seen years of 
unprecedented Republican obstruction 
of the NLRB nominees. There has been 
an empty Democratic seat on the 
NLRB for nearly 3 years, and there 
wasn’t a single Democrat on the Board 
from late 2019 to mid-2020. That ob-
struction tipped the scales of justice in 
favor of big corporations, and workers 
have suffered the consequences. 
When workers stand together to form 
a union, it is the NLRB that makes 
sure the election is fair. If a worker is 
fired or unfairly punished because they 
want to join or form a union, the NLRB 
is tasked with protecting their rights. 
If companies refuse to negotiate fairly 
with unions fighting for higher wages 
and better benefits or a secure retire-
ment or safer working conditions, it is 
the NLRB that protects unions and 
union workers who have helped build 
our country’s middle class. 
Working families simply cannot af-
ford an NLRB that fails to protect 
workers’ rights when they are threat-
ened. So we have to confirm nominees 
like Jennifer Abruzzo who will protect 
workers’ rights and make sure their 
voices are heard if we are serious about 
building back a stronger, fairer econ-
omy. If we are serious about standing 
with working families, then we need to 
confirm Jennifer Abruzzo as general 
counsel of the NLRB and then get to 
work increasing our Federal minimum 
wage. 
I yield the floor.

unanimous 
consent

JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
there is a reason that the JOHN LEWIS 
Voting Rights Advancement Act bears 
his name, and the reason is that John 
Lewis was truly a civil rights hero, an 
icon, a trailblazer, a model, and a men-
tor to so many of us, not because of 
what he said but because of what he 
did. 
In marching across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, where he was beaten 
and bloodied in leading those civil 
rights activists, in fighting for equality 
and justice here in the Halls of Con-
gress, he set a model of courageous 
public service that inspires us today. 
It has inspired voting rights since 
1965, when those acts of courage led the 
Congress to adopt that Voting Rights 
Act of 1965. It was bipartisan then; it 
has been a bipartisan cause since then. 
In fact, it was most recently reauthor-
ized in 2006 by an overwhelming bipar-
tisan vote. 
There should be nothing partisan 
about voting rights, which go to the 
core of our democracy. They are the 
lifeblood of our democracy, as we know 
better or as well as anyone in this 
Chamber, because we know that we act 
here with authority by the consent of 
the governed, as the Founders said. We 
govern by the consent of the people 
who elect us, hopefully fairly. That is 
the reason we need now the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, be-
cause the U.S. Supreme Court, in two 
decisions, Shelby County v. Holder and 
Brnovich v. Democratic National Com-
mittee, has in effect eviscerated—more 
bluntly, gutted—two key sections, 5 
and 2, of the Voting Rights Act. 
Now, we have the opportunity—in 
fact, we have the obligation to make 
sure that the memory and the cause of 
John Lewis in advancing voting rights 
are upheld. We have that obligation 
not for ourselves but for the country, 
which is why John Lewis fought so 
hard and so well. 
Today, State legislatures are taking 
advantage of the gaps and defects 
opened by those two Supreme Court de-
cisions to attack America’s right to 
vote. What we are seeing is the great-
est assault on voting rights in the his-
tory of this country, maybe with the 
exception of Jim Crow. 
I know some have called these laws a 
second Jim Crow. It may be the son of 
Jim Crow or the nephew or niece of 
Jim Crow, but the goal is the same: 
suppression of voting rights, discrimi-
nating against individuals who have 
that right to vote. 
Last week, I chaired a hearing in the 
Constitution Subcommittee on the im-
pact of these two Supreme Court deci-
sions on voting rights. What we heard 
from the witnesses appearing there was 
nothing less than a call to action to 
protect our democracy and live up to 
America’s founding ideals. We heard 
from men and women who have been 
litigating—in the trenches, on the 
frontline of this battle to preserve vot-
ing rights—about the impact of these 
two Supreme Court decisions and the 
lower court decisions that have been in 
their wake. 
Since Shelby County in 2013, approxi-
mately 21,000 polling places nationwide 
serving the people of the United States 
on election day have been eliminated. 
Millions of voters have been purged 
from the voter rolls. This year alone, 17 
States have passed 28 laws to restrict 
voting rights. 
This assault on the right to vote, this 
effort to suppress men and women who 
by law should have that right, is pur-
poseful, relentless, unremitting, and it 
is supported, unfortunately, by elected 
officials across the country. We have 
seen it in Arizona, in Florida, Texas, 
but many more State legislatures are 
moving in this direction. The voting 
rights of this Nation are at stake be-
cause what we are seeing is a delib-
erate, systematic attempt to make it 
harder and more difficult to register to 
vote and particularly for people of 
color to have this right. It is an at-
tempt to subvert our democracy and 
attack the lifeblood of our Nation. 
We know in theory that the Founders 
intended that, in fact, our government 
‘‘derives [its] just powers from the con-
sent of the governed.’’ But more than 
an exercise in theory, this effort is a 
direct, clear attempt to defend against 
the tsunami of voter suppression bills 
now crashing on our Nation. That is 
why the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act should be bipartisan. I 
have no illusions about it being so, but 
one way or the other, we ought to fol-
low the advice of John Lewis, who said: 
The right to vote is precious, almost sa-
cred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool 
or instrument we have in a democratic soci-
ety. 
In memory of what he said but more 
in tribute to the ideals of democracy 
that he advanced by his actions, we 
should stand up to this assault on our 
democracy and pass the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. There 
is no time to waste. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN R. STEITZ 
Mr. KENNEDY. This is one of those 
days that we often have, at least for 
me, that is both happy and sad. 
A couple of weeks ago, I was back 
home in Louisiana. I was sitting at my 
dining room table, minding my own 
business, drinking a cup of coffee, pet-
ting my two dogs—dogs are the best 
people—and I got a phone call from one 
Mr. John R. Steitz, who is my deputy 
chief of staff for policy and my legisla-
tive director. I knew this phone call 
was coming someday. I knew it. I

July 21, 2021 
didn’t know it was coming so soon, but 
I knew someday I would get this call. 
John said: Senator, they made me an 
offer I can’t refuse. I am going to take 
it. 
I have to be honest. I thought to my-
self: Damn, you know, Steitz is leav-
ing. Another part of me was saying: 
God, I am so happy for him. I am really 
pleased with his new position in the 
private sector. 
I wanted to suggest to him that if he 
needed any help picking out a new Mer-
cedes, I could come help him. If he gets 
it down to this color or that color, he 
could just buy two. 
I have known some folks in public 
service. The Presiding Officer has too. I 
have known some people in business— 
to each his own—who are often afraid 
to hire people more capable than them 
or smarter than them, and that is 
human nature, you know. I get it. I 
will have a lot to answer for on judg-
ment day, but doing that is not one of 
the things. I have always tried to hire 
people who were smarter than me or 
more capable than me or had talents 
that I don’t have. But there is a price 
you pay when you do that. You are 
going to lose them at some point be-
cause you can’t keep a good person 
down. And that is John Steitz. So I 
knew this day was coming. That is why 
it really is bittersweet. 
John is—most of you know him— 
John is a graduate of SMU. 
When we are joking around, I like to 
say that the closest John ever got to a 
4.0 at SMU was his blood-alcohol level, 
but that is not accurate. John, as we 
all know—and we are kidding—is whip- 
smart. He finished SMU in public pol-
icy and business administration. I 
think he had a minor in cheerleaders, 
but he never neglected his studies. He 
is a very smart guy. He is whip-smart. 
Don’t ever let him try to kid you. 
Brooks, his better half, who is here 
with us today, is an accomplished pro-
fessional in her own right; and they are 
a team, I can assure you. When you 
work the hours that John Steitz works, 
you had better do it as part of a team. 
They have two children. Eleanor is 
their oldest. I am told that Eleanor’s 
very first words were ‘‘vote-arama.’’ 
She said ‘‘vote-arama’’ before she said 
‘‘Mama’’ or ‘‘Daddy.’’ That is an exag-
geration, but probably not by much. 
They have a young son, John, Jr., 
whom they call Jack. 
If I taught a class or if the Presiding 
Officer taught a class, and if we told 
the truth about how a bill becomes a 
law, I think a lot of Americans would 
be surprised. This is not ‘‘Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington.’’ It is hard to pass 
a bill in the U.S. Senate. It is supposed 
to be, because that is our job, to not 
act on the basis of feelings but to act 
on the basis of logic. It is a lot of work 
to get a bill passed. I have been able to 
pass a couple, and I wouldn’t have 
passed one single, solitary one of them 
without John Steitz. 
I made a list here—and I am not 
going to read all of it—of stuff, like the 
National Flood Insurance Program Ex-
tension Act, the Justice Against Cor-
ruption on K Street Act, the RBIC Ad-
visers Relief Act, the Holding Foreign 
Companies Accountable Act, and the 
Rebuilding Small Businesses After Dis-
asters Act. 
You know, this isn’t all my doing. 
This has John Steitz’s fingerprints all 
over it—on every one of these bills. 
John has a rare combination, and he 
is going to do really well in the private 
sector. I mentioned that he is whip- 
smart, and he is, but it takes more 
than that to succeed around here. 
First, you have got to have a work 
ethic. You have got to be willing to put 
in the hours. I can’t tell you the num-
ber of times I looked around when I 
was working late and I would see Steitz 
there. 
I would say: Steitz, go home for 
God’s sake. Brooks is going to change 
the locks on you. She may already 
have. 
He was there constantly. I don’t 
know when he found the time to father 
Eleanor and Jack. I mean, he was al-
ways in the office. 
So you have got to have a work 
ethic, but it is more than that. You 
have got to like people; you have got to 
understand people; and you have got to 
respect people. You have got to know 
which bridge to burn and which bridge 
to cross. You have got to understand 
when to go forward and say, ‘‘To hell 
with it. We are going full speed ahead,’’ 
and when to back off a little bit. 
It is a lot more art than science, and 
everybody in this Chamber knows what 
I am talking about. That is not some-
thing you pick up in a week. 
When I asked John to be my legisla-
tive director before he became deputy 
chief of staff, he didn’t have all of this. 
I mean, he was as green as a gourd. I 
was too. He learned it. He learned it on 
the job, and, boy, did he do an incred-
ible job. 
There is one other quality you have 
got to have to succeed around this 
place aside from smarts, work ethic, 
respect for other people, and integrity, 
all of which John Steitz has. You have 
got to care. You have really got to 
care. You can’t fake it, you know. You 
can’t be motivated by moving up an-
other rung on the ladder, though some 
people are. I get it. We are all human. 
Sometimes that may be a part of it, 
but if that is your sole motivation, you 
are not going to make it. People up 
here on Capitol Hill are smart. They 
can smell it. So you can’t be guided by 
ambition. You have got to be guided by 
knowledge, yes; by wisdom, yes; but 
also by empathy. 
John knows what he believes. He be-
lieves what he believes, and he is will-
ing to fight for it. But he is also willing 
to listen to another point of view. 
There were many times he would come 
to my office and say: You know, here is 
what is going on. Look at it this way, 
but listen to it from this perspective. 
He is also sneaky. Now, I don’t mean 
that in a bad way. By sneaky, I mean 
he is a great strategist in terms of he 
can figure out how to go from point A 
to point B to point C, do a half gainer, 
get to point D, and circle back to point 
A. 
There are some times when John has 
come to my office and said: Here is how 
we are going to get this amendment 
done, or here is how we are going to get 
this passed. 
Then he will lay out the plan. I wish 
I could use examples, but I would tip 
my hand. He would lay out the plan, 
and I would say: John, this isn’t col-
lege. Have you been smoking dope 
around here? This isn’t college. We 
can’t do that. It will never ever work. 
It won’t work. 
It usually did. But I always said: 
Well, heck. Let’s try it. If you want to 
try it, I am willing to try. It is legal; it 
is honest; but it is just such a long 
shot. 
But it worked, and I was appreciative 
of that. That didn’t just happen. That 
came from smarts, hard work, and car-
ing. 
I guess I will end. 
Thank you, Brooks, for sharing your 
time and for sharing John with us. I 
know it wasn’t easy for you. We are 
going to—I started to say that we are 
going to miss you, but we expect you 
to come back around and bring Eleanor 
and bring Jack and bring Chili. John 
has a great dog. Chili became the mas-
cot in the office. Chili is the best beg-
gar you have ever seen. I am going to 
miss him. 
I want to thank John here today for 
giving so much. He could have made a 
lot more money in the time he has 
been here in the private sector because 
he is that talented, but he is moving to 
the private sector. It is their gain and 
our loss. He is welcome back any time. 
Thank you, John. Thank you, thank 
you, thank you not just on my behalf, 
but on behalf of the people of Louisiana 
and on behalf of the American people 
for giving so much to your country. 
God bless you. Godspeed. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TAX INCREASES 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, Amer-
ica’s family farmers and ranchers have 
faced unprecedented challenges in re-
cent years. They have been caught in 
the middle of trade wars, repeatedly 
lost harvests and livestock to one cata-
strophic natural disaster after another, 
and faced a whole new set of unparal-
leled complications when COVID–19 
took hold. 
Now a new threat to their future 
looms, the Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spend agenda for which family 
farmers and ranchers are being told to 
foot the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4997 
July 21, 2021 
The 
Democrats 
are 
proposing 
changes to capital gains tax rates, 
stepped-up basis, and the use of like- 
kind exchanges that put the future of 
our family farms and ranches at risk. 
The next generation of family farmers 
will face devastating consequences if 
the Democrats have their way, as their 
proposed changes put the future of 
nearly 2 million family-owned farm op-
erations at risk. 
The President and his allies in Con-
gress will tell you that family farms 
and ranches will not be impacted by 
their proposed changes. In fact, they 
make a very specific claim that 98 per-
cent of farms will not be impacted. Yet 
they have provided no evidence to sup-
port that claim, and they have been 
asked to provide that directly by my-
self and a majority of the Republican 
side of the Ag Committee. 
We essentially asked USDA to show 
its math. That request has gone unan-
swered. It seems unlikely that we will 
ever get a response, so we took it upon 
ourselves to find out if there was any 
legitimacy to their claim. 
We asked the highly respected team 
at the Agricultural and Food Policy 
Center at Texas A&M University to 
conduct a study on the legislation that 
mirrors tax increases President Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats 
have 
floated to pay for their massive human 
infrastructure plan. 
The results confirm exactly what we 
expected. These proposed changes are 
going to crush rural America. 
Remember 
the 
administration’s 
claim that 98 percent of family farms 
and ranches will be protected? Well, 
AFPC’s research showed just the oppo-
site when it comes to changes to 
stepped-up basis, which allows the tax 
basis of an inherited asset to be 
stepped up at death to the fair market 
value as of the date of death. 
If these changes were to be imple-
mented, 92 of AFPC’s 94 representative 
farms would be impacted with an aver-
age additional tax liability of more 
than $720,000 per farm. That means 98 
percent of family farms included in 
AFPC’s study are hurt by these tax in-
creases, not protected by them. 
And as you can see on this map, this 
chart, those changes hit rural America 
very, very hard. We are looking at over 
half a million dollars in additional tax 
liabilities per farm in the Southwest 
and in the Southeast, which includes 
my home State of Arkansas. In fact, 
the average tax liability for the five 
Arkansas farms represented in the 
study is over $800,000. In the Northeast 
and out West, these changes would re-
sult in over $700,000 in additional tax li-
abilities per farm. And look at the Mid-
west. It is over $1 million in additional 
tax liabilities per farm. 
These obligations will take literally 
years to pay off. And, again, that is 
just when you take into account 
changes to stepped-up basis, just that 
one particular part. 
Add in the higher capital gains tax 
rates Democrats have proposed and 
limitations to like-kind exchanges, 
which allow taxpayers, including fam-
ily farmers, to exchange property and 
defer the capital gains tax, and you can 
see why so many literally fear for their 
livelihood. 
Farmers are land rich and cash poor. 
Farmland is equivalent to a farmer’s 
401(k). Instead of traditional retire-
ment accounts, farmers and ranchers 
invest in cropland and pastureland and 
tirelessly work that land in an effort to 
create a more prosperous future for 
their loved ones. 
That lifetime of hard work, planning, 
and sacrifice will all be for naught if 
these changes are allowed to be imple-
mented. 
On top of that, these Tax Code 
changes will dry up the farmland mar-
ket, lead to further consolidation in 
the agricultural sector, create barriers 
to entry for new or beginning farmers, 
and stunt reinvestment in rural com-
munities. 
Ultimately, agriculture as a whole 
and rural America will suffer. That is 
why my colleagues and I are down here 
today. If changes of these magnitude 
are implemented, the economic harm it 
will cause will have a lasting impact on 
rural America. 
These tax increases, which again are 
only being proposed because the Demo-
crats are determined to force their 
reckless spending agenda through Con-
gress, certainly need to be rejected. 
With that, I yield to Senator GRASS-
LEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to fi-
nance their big spending agenda, Presi-
dent Biden and Members of his party in 
Congress have called for over $3 trillion 
in new taxes. 
This group claims that these tax 
hikes are targeted solely to the very 
wealthy. However, deep down, embed-
ded in their tax-hike proposal, is a di-
rect attack on family farms and result-
ing ruination of rural communities. 
If Democrats get their way, family 
farms would be decimated through the 
enactment of a second death tax that 
operates on top of the existing estate 
tax. This second death tax would sub-
ject the paper gains of business and in-
vestment assets to tax upon transfer to 
the next generation. At the same time, 
the current long-term capital gains 
rate would be nearly doubled. 
Now, as a result, decades of paper 
gains in farmland and other property 
could be subject to capital gains taxes 
at a rate as high as 43.4 percent. 
Given inflation as well as the esca-
lating value of farmland over the past 
several decades, some Iowa farms could 
easily generate a half-a-million-dollar 
tax bill or even more based upon land 
values alone. And those land values 
have gone up as a result of inflation 
and nothing else. 
Moreover, according to an analysis 
by KPMG, family farms captured both 
by this new death tax and the existing 
estate tax could see tax rates exceeding 
66 percent. 
Now, it is pretty simple. That is not 
taxation; that is confiscation. 
Proponents claim this new tax—or 
you might say this new confiscation— 
is needed to close a loophole that al-
lows the appreciation in value of prop-
erty over one’s lifetime to go untaxed, 
but death isn’t a loophole, and it 
shouldn’t be a taxable event. 
In fact, rather than solving a prob-
lem, this proposal would resurrect 
failed policy from a decade past. 
As part of the Tax Reform Act of 
1976, Congress experimented with a 
similar attempt to subject paper gains 
in inherited assets to tax. This change 
was immediately met with outcries 
from farmers, ranchers, and small busi-
ness owners, resulting in its repeal in a 
few years. 
In fact, it is such a complicated proc-
ess, it is probably impossible to admin-
ister such a tax; at least that was the 
main point made in the late 1970s 
against that 1976 legislation. 
Now, as problematic as this change 
was for farmers in 1976, what Demo-
crats have in store would actually be 
far worse. Where in 1976 no tax was due 
until an asset was eventually sold by 
an heir, current proposals could result 
in a tax bill due in the year of that per-
son’s death. 
As is often said, and with a lot of 
truth to it, farmers are land rich and 
cash poor. This means it is unlikely for 
a decedent’s estate to have cash on 
hand to satisfy a six-figure tax bill. 
Now, as a result, all or portions of a 
family farm might have to be sold to 
satisfy an oversized tax bill. 
This would endanger the continu-
ation of family farms from one genera-
tion to the next, and it would dev-
astate rural communities along with it 
because, you see, most people, if you 
invest in farmland, you don’t invest 
today because you are going to sell it 
tomorrow; you invest in it to work it 
and you work it for a generation and 
you pass it on to the next generation. 
Now, we had one recent study that 
found subjecting paper gains to a tax 
at death could cost as much as 80,000 
jobs each year over the next decade. 
So I say to my Democratic col-
leagues, pursue this policy at your own 
peril. I assure you, farmers, ranchers, 
and small business owners are paying 
close attention. If you aren’t, you bet-
ter. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have 
the privilege of representing Kansas in 
the U.S. Senate and Kansans and espe-
cially the opportunity, the privilege of 
representing farmers and ranchers. It 
is a huge component of our State’s 
economy and a significant way that we 
live our lives. Agriculture has molded 
the nature of our State generation to 
generation. 
In agriculture, farming and ranching 
is one of the few remaining professions 
where sons and daughters still can 
work alongside moms and dads. They 
can work alongside their grandparents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4998 
July 21, 2021 
I still remember a video that a farm-
er proudly showed me of him and three 
generations of his family, so four 
total—him and three other genera-
tions—cutting wheat in Kansas one 
July summer and how proud he was to 
look out and see that his son was in 
one combine, he was in another, his fa-
ther in another, his grandfather in an-
other. 
Family farming and ranching is not 
just important for food production. We 
are productive in that family farm set-
ting. It is not just important for food 
production for our country and for the 
rest of the world, but it also is impor-
tant for us in preserving our values and 
principles which are passed down from 
generation to generation. 
The love of life, respect for others, 
the joy of earning a living, the idea 
that what you do every day has a con-
sequence in feeding the world—those 
characteristics of Kansas farmers need 
to be around for the country not only 
today but into the future. But unfortu-
nately, the tax-and-spend spree, the 
Democrats’ tax proposal, is a direct as-
sault on multigenerational farms and 
ranches in Kansas and across the coun-
try. These proposals threaten the abil-
ity of producers to be able to pass on 
their operations to that next genera-
tion. 
I have watched farmers talk to their 
kids about where the future lies for 
them, and sometimes it is positive in 
the sense that there is hope for a 
bright future, and at other times, in 
difficult days in agriculture, it is the 
worry about whether or not the next 
generation can afford to be on that 
farm. 
For the past century, this thing 
called stepped-up basis—so that the 
value of a piece of property for its in-
heritance tax purposes is valued at the 
date of the death of the person—the 
farmer in this case and rancher in this 
case. For this past century, stepped-up 
basis has been a cornerstone of our Tax 
Code, and it has protected family farms 
and ranches in their plan to transition 
to the next generation. 
Farm- and ranchland have tripled in 
value since the late nineties, so even a 
second generation, somebody currently 
just now coming to the farm because of 
the death of a parent, could be dev-
astatingly impacted. 
For example, a 2,000-acre farm pur-
chased in the midnineties in Kansas by 
a first-generation producer—kind of a 
typical-size farm, particularly in west-
ern Kansas. Even with a modest capital 
gains exemption, the inheriting farmer, 
the son or daughter, could face a tax li-
ability close to a fourth of the present- 
day value of the land. 
To keep the farm in operation to sat-
isfy the tax liability, the son or daugh-
ter inheriting the farm would be faced 
with the difficult decision of either to 
sell a significant portion of the land 
that was farmed by their parents or 
take on even more debt in a business 
that is faced with increasingly tight 
margins. The damage would only get 
increasingly worse for family farms 
and ranches passed down through addi-
tional generations. 
If the proposed changes in stepped-up 
basis are implemented, the big farms 
will get bigger by purchasing land from 
the smaller operations unable to meet 
that tax liability. The consequences 
would certainly be felt by the small 
farmer and his or her family, who are 
forced to sell the land, but also 
throughout the entire rural commu-
nity in which the farms are built 
around. 
We need those family farmers on land 
in Kansas producing food, fiber, and 
fuel for the well-being of our country 
and its economy, but we need them es-
pecially for the well-being of the com-
munity’s future. In the absence of 
those family farmers and their kids, 
the family ranchers and their children, 
the ability to keep a grocery store, to 
have a farm store, to have an imple-
ment dealership, to support the local 
bank, to pay the taxes for the school— 
we lose those things when we lose fam-
ily farmers. 
Our farmers and ranchers should not 
be forced to shoulder the Democratic 
trillion-dollar spending spree to expand 
social programs. Our Tax Code should 
work 
for 
American 
families, 
not 
against them, and especially for family 
farms and ranches that often lack the 
cash flow to make ends meet. 
I urge my colleagues, my Democratic 
colleagues, to reject imposing taxes, to 
changing the issue of stepped-up basis 
that is so valuable and viable for farm-
ers’ and ranchers’ future, and it would 
endanger their ability to pass on land 
to the next generation of producers. It 
would be a bad thing for the farmers 
and ranchers and their families, it 
would be a bad thing for the commu-
nity in which they live, and it would be 
a terrible thing for our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Mis-
souri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, a lot of 
time when people come to Washington, 
they come up with ideas for new poli-
cies, and they have a theory of how 
those policies are supposed to work. 
What they don’t always know are the 
unintended consequences of what that 
law is going to produce. As a matter of 
fact, I have said on occasion that the 
most certain thing that will happen 
when we pass a law is unintended con-
sequences, and I haven’t been proved 
wrong very many times on that. 
The unintended consequences are 
things that nobody saw coming. They 
are things you didn’t expect to happen 
the way they did. Smart people writing 
the laws may do all they can to antici-
pate everything they can, but there is 
always something never thought of. So 
it is helpful to have information that 
tells us what the consequences are 
likely to be. 
The topic we are talking about here 
today is filled with intended con-
sequences if you look just beyond the 
comment you are making at the im-
pact it is going to have. 
In this case, the proposed laws are a 
couple of ideas my Democratic col-
leagues have as to how to pay for the 
spending spree they are on right now. 
The tax-and-spend plans include a lot 
of bad ideas, but two of the tax ideas 
are particularly bad and will have par-
ticularly devastating impact. 
First is a proposal from Senator 
SANDERS
to raise the death tax on 
farmers and ranchers, to change the ex-
emption and do things that simply 
raise that tax. The second would be to 
impose the double-death tax by elimi-
nating what Senator MORAN was just 
talking about, the stepped-up basis in 
calculating how much families have to 
pay. 
The research tells us what we can ex-
pect to happen if these two bills pass. 
Research was done at the Texas A&M 
University that looked at a representa-
tive group of 94 farms in 30 States. You 
can look at this research. You can 
verify my facts. With 94 farms, 30 
States, they found that under current 
law, 2 of those 94 farms could expect to 
be hit by a big death tax when the farm 
goes from one generation to the next. 
But if the step-up basis tax hike pro-
posed by President Biden and Demo-
crats in Congress were enacted, the re-
searchers found that 92 of 94 farms 
would be hit hard. The average addi-
tional tax liability would be $726,000. 
So 94 farms; 30 States; 92 farms af-
fected; the average tax, $726,000. That 
is not the total taxes; that is just the 
additional taxes if these two bills pass. 
If these tax hikes favored by the 
other side were allowed to pass, we 
would have 92 farms paying a higher 
tax bill. That average additional tax 
would add up to more than $1.5 million. 
Many families would be forced to sell 
all or part of their farm. And these 
aren’t families who are inheriting big 
stock portfolios or families who are in-
heriting 
multimillion-dollar 
beach 
houses. They are not families who 
focus on every way you can think of to 
cheat the tax law. They are not billion-
aires looking for every way they can 
use a loophole. These are farmers and 
ranchers who have put their lives into 
the effort to make their farms work. 
I will point out also that these same 
statistics would apply to many small 
businesses. Give this same speech for 
small businesses with many of the 
same considerations. 
According to the Missouri Depart-
ment of Agriculture, our State has 
95,000 farms. They cover two-thirds of 
the State’s total land acreage. The av-
erage Missouri farm is 291 acres, and 
almost all of them are owned by fami-
lies. Between the investment there and 
the efforts that have been made, those 
families can be devastated in what 
they have worked hard to put together. 
So for my friends on the other side of 
the aisle, I point out that unintended 
consequences are one thing, and unin-
tended consequences often happen, but 
here we know what the consequences

are. So if these bills pass, this is in-
tended consequences to make a big dif-
ference for family farms, for ranches, 
and, frankly, for small businesses as 
well. 
I hope my colleagues will not go for-
ward with these tax hikes on family 
farms. We know what damage it will 
cause. It is easy to verify. Don’t make 
the family sell the farm. Don’t make 
the small business sell the farm to a 
bigger business. Don’t make these mis-
takes that have clear and intended con-
sequences if this is what the Senate 
and the Congress will do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my good friend from Ar-
kansas, JOHN
BOOZMAN, who is the 
ranking member on our Ag Committee. 
He has organized this colloquy that we 
have to talk about how important it is 
that we support our farmers and ranch-
ers. I mean, in my home State of North 
Dakota right now, we have terrible 
drought, and our farmers and ranchers 
are up against it. I think the Presiding 
Officer—I think in your State, you are 
having real drought as well. 
So it is a tough time for our farmers 
and ranchers, and we need to be out 
there doing everything we can to help 
them and support them, but instead, 
the Biden administration is looking at 
tax increases. That is going to be a big, 
big problem for them. So we are here 
today to talk about that. 
Our farmers and ranchers produce 
the highest quality, lowest cost food 
supply in the world, and they continue 
to navigate bottomed-out commodity 
prices, complex global trade uncertain-
ties, unpredictable weather, as I said, 
including drought this year in North 
Dakota and across much of the West, 
and also the COVID pandemic. So they 
have been dealing with all of these 
things. 
Throughout these numerous chal-
lenges, our producers have continued 
to put food on the shelves at super-
markets and on the tables of families 
around the world, not just in this coun-
try but around the world. In this coun-
try, every single American benefits 
every single day from what our farmers 
and ranchers do, and that is, produce 
the highest quality, lowest cost food 
supply in the world. 
Yet, rather than help improve the 
economic outlook for our producers 
and strengthen our ag supply chain, 
the Biden administration has put forth 
tax-and-spend policy proposals that 
would further increase the cost of food 
production, harm family farmers and 
ranchers, and reduce our economic 
growth, all as we are working to re-
cover from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The trillions that Democrats in Con-
gress have already spent this year have 
led to a $2.2 trillion deficit through the 
first 9 months of the fiscal year, and we 
are on track to end the year with a def-
icit of more than $3 trillion, the second 
largest deficit since World War II. With 
our national debt already at $28 tril-
lion, we simply cannot afford to spend 
more. 
The American people are beginning 
to feel the impact of those spending 
policies. The prices of consumer goods 
are increasing at the fastest rate since 
2008. Just last week, the Department of 
Labor released data showing that infla-
tion has increased to 5.4 percent, the 
largest year-over-year gain since 2008. 
This includes farm country, where pro-
ducers are facing increased costs for 
everything from fertilizer to fencing 
supplies, to combines and tractors. 
As we watch inflation grow faster 
than American workers’ paychecks, 
wiping out wage gains and leaving 
American families behind, the Biden 
administration is planning an even 
larger, $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend pack-
age that will bring economic harm to 
American workers, small businesses, 
and farmers and ranchers. 
For example, the Biden administra-
tion and Democrats in Congress have 
proposed to eliminate stepped-up basis, 
a tax provision that prevents family- 
owned farms and ranches from being 
hit with a crippling tax bill when a 
family member passes away. 
Under current law, when passing 
down a family farm or ranch to the 
next generation, the tax basis is 
stepped up to fair market value, pre-
venting a large tax bill on the next 
generation of farmers. 
In addition to increasing the tax bill 
on multigeneration farmers and ranch-
ers, repealing stepped-up basis would 
add significant complexity to farmers’ 
and ranchers’ tax-filing process. In 
fact, when a Democratic Congress pre-
viously tried to repeal stepped-up basis 
in the 1976 Tax Reform Act, it was la-
beled by the New York Times as ‘‘im-
possibly unworkable.’’ Congress at the 
time must have agreed because the pro-
vision was never implemented and was 
ultimately repealed 4 years later in 
1980. 
The impacts of a repeal of stepped-up 
basis would not only be felt by our 
farmers and ranchers, but it would also 
impact small businesses and their em-
ployees and supplementary services. 
A recent report from Ernst & Young 
estimates the repeal of stepped-up 
basis would result in the loss of 80,000 
jobs in each of the first 10 years after 
the repeal and the loss of 100,000 jobs in 
each subsequent year—80,000 jobs to 
100,000 jobs. 
Similarly, a study by the Texas A&M 
Agricultural and Food Policy Center 
determined that more than 97 percent 
of the representative farms in its 30– 
State database, including North Da-
kota, would be impacted by a proposal 
to eliminate stepped-up basis, with an 
average additional tax liability total-
ing nearly $725,000 per farm. 
While 
the 
administration 
claims 
these changes would impact only 2 per-
cent of farms, they have provided no 
explanation or data to support those 
assertions. 
With the average age of farmers in 
our country now nearing 60 years old, 
now is not the time to burden the next 
generation of young farmers and ranch-
ers with massive, complex tax bills. 
In addition, the Biden administration 
has proposed to eliminate the use of 
1031 like-kind exchanges, a provision 
that has been in the Tax Code since 
1921, which allows farmers and ranch-
ers to defer taxes on land transfers 
when they continue their investment 
in similar land assets. 
Farmers and ranchers use the 1031 
like-kind exchanges for many reasons. 
This includes consolidating land par-
cels to reduce time and money they 
spend moving equipment, supplies, and 
commodities from one place to an-
other. Producers also consolidate crop-
land closer to their livestock barns, 
crop storage facilities, or even as part 
of the estate planning process to help 
young or beginning farmers join their 
business. 
In short, in the middle of the recov-
ery from a global pandemic, President 
Biden is proposing a massive tax-and- 
spend bill that will harm our economic 
recovery, increase the cost of consumer 
goods, reduce American competitive-
ness globally, and disproportionately 
hurt our small businesses, our farmers, 
and our ranchers. 
Instead, we need to get our debt and 
deficit under control and ensure U.S. 
competitiveness in the global market-
place, while positioning our farmers, 
ranchers, and ag supply chain to con-
tinue to produce the highest quality, 
lowest cost food supply in the world. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, in 
the last few weeks, I have been back 
home, and many, many people were fin-
ishing up wheat harvest. It is abso-
lutely one of the joys of the entire 
year, when a year’s work of hard work 
comes to fruition. Every corner of the 
State was speckled with combines, 
tractors, grain carts, and trucks, all 
doing their part in the harvest process. 
Inside those implements were fathers 
and sons, sisters, mothers, brothers, 
and my cousins, all working side by 
side to harvest the crop that will pro-
vide the financing for land payments, 
equipment loans, operating loans, and 
next year’s inputs, like seed and fer-
tilizer. 
Now, agriculture is a capital-inten-
sive industry, much more than I could 
have ever imagined. Harvesting wheat 
requires at least four different pieces of 
machinery, 
many 
costing 
$250,000, 
$500,000, or more each. It takes years 
for a farmer building up equity to pur-
chase a new piece of equipment or land. 
And for many families, it is only by 
passing down the land and equipment 
that a family farm can remain viable. 
This is the only way a young farmer 
can truly survive. 
Now, the common saying in Kansas is 
that farmers live poor but die rich. 
Across this great Nation, contrary to 
most people’s beliefs, 98 percent of 
farms and ranches are family-owned—

July 21, 2021 
98 percent, family-owned. Those fami-
lies produce much of the food, fuel, and 
fiber we consume here in the United 
States and around the globe. These 
family farms, many in their fourth, 
like mine, fifth generation—and even 
sixth and seventh generation farms and 
ranches are out there now. They en-
dure turbulent weather, inconsistent 
market conditions, and tight labor 
markets. It seemed like, growing up, a 
week never passed that my dad never 
looked at me and said: You know, 
farming has to be the biggest gamble 
there is in America. 
In 2017, Republican-led government 
passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
which provided sweeping tax changes 
to encourage private entrepreneurship 
and economic growth. Under the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, the exemptions for 
the estate tax—as we call it, the death 
tax—more than doubled, keeping most 
family farms safe from redundant gov-
ernment taxation. 
But now, the current administration 
and some of my friends across the aisle 
want to tax hard-working agricultural 
producers with the financing of their 
roughly $5 trillion reckless tax-and- 
spending bill. I think President Eisen-
hower—or Ike, as we call him, a fellow 
Kansan—hit the nail on the head when 
he said: ‘‘You know, farming looks 
mighty easy when your plow is a pen-
cil, and you’re a thousand miles from a 
corn field.’’ 
First, they proposed not only elimi-
nating stepped-up basis on realized 
property but also on unrealized assets 
at the time of the owner’s death. Their 
proposal would tax unrealized capital 
gains over $1 million at ordinary in-
come tax rates, which would be levied 
at the top marginal rate of 39.6 per-
cent. That means the next generation 
inheriting land and equipment would 
have to pay taxes on the increase in 
value, even if the property is never 
sold. 
Secondly, the administration has 
proposed lowering the exemption to the 
death tax from $11.7 million, under the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to $3.5 million 
per person and increasing the top tax 
rate from 40 to 45 percent. Con-
sequently, a family farm commonly 
would have to sell off a third of their 
land to keep going from generation to 
generation. And the buyers, unfortu-
nately, will be large corporations or 
foreign entities. 
According to a report published by 
Texas A&M’s Agriculture and Food 
Policy Center, under current law only 2 
of their 94 representative farms would 
be impacted by an event triggering a 
generational transfer of property—2 
out of 94. To contrast this, up to 98 per-
cent of their representative farms 
would see new higher tax burdens if 
certain parts of the administration’s 
plan were enacted. 
From 1997 to 2020, in Kansas, crop-
land values have risen 220 percent. In 
some parts of the United States, they 
have increased over 500 percent. If 
there was a 20-percent capital gains tax 
on those valuation increases, the aver-
age Kansas farmer would have a new 
tax obligation of nearly a quarter of a 
million dollars. These numbers are 
simply unbearable. 
I stop and pay homage to my grand-
father and both of my grandfathers, 
who have had fourth and fifth genera-
tion family farms. These farms were 
bought in the early 1900s. Both farms 
have been in the family over 100 years. 
I would suppose my grandfathers paid 
less than $100 per acre. Today, those 
farms maybe are worth $1,000 or $2,000 
an acre. But if you can imagine the tax 
burden of trying to pass down that 
farm and pay for that stepped-up basis, 
for the tax on the increase of net prop-
erty, it simply isn’t going to happen. 
None of us have brothers and sisters 
and cousins that have that type of cash 
available. We want to encourage the 
next generation to return home to the 
family farm, not tax them into bank-
ruptcy. 
America will see millions of acres of 
land and billions of dollars of equip-
ment change hands over this next dec-
ade. While the current administration 
contests that only a small percentage 
of our farm families will be impacted 
by the proposed changes, all evidence 
really indicates otherwise. 
The administration fails to consider 
the several realities of multigenera-
tional farms, with some siblings stay-
ing on the farm and some selling their 
interest. Any changes to the estate tax 
and opportunities to pass assets from 
one generation to the next will lead to 
further consolidation in the ag indus-
try, fewer young families returning 
home to their rural communities, and 
more rural Main Street businesses clos-
ing shop. 
We can’t allow this administration to 
saddle our hard-working farming fami-
lies with the responsibilities of funding 
their socialist agenda. Agriculture is 
still responsible for 40 percent of the 
Kansas economy. We must all do what 
we can to ensure our family farms have 
every opportunity possible to continue 
their way of life and bring the next 
generation back to the farm and keep 
rural America alive and well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
appreciate the opportunity to join a 
number of my colleagues representing 
farm States to sound the alarm to the 
millions of rural Americans who will be 
harmed by proposed tax changes out-
lined in the American Families Plan. 
Described as a plan to help American 
families, it would do the exact opposite 
for farm families across the United 
States. 
The most concerning changes to the 
Tax Code include decreasing the estate 
tax exemption, increasing capital gains 
tax rates on transfers of property to 
heirs, and increasing taxes on appre-
ciated assets, such as farmland, which 
has increased in value very signifi-
cantly in recent years. 
These misguided proposals fail to 
take into consideration the fact that 
farmers in general are highly vulner-
able to these types of tax changes, as 
land and equipment comprise most of 
the farmer’s net worth. 
If enacted, these tax provisions would 
strongly discourage and make it more 
difficult for our next generation to get 
into farming. The provisions would cre-
ate significant hurdles from a financial 
perspective, to say the least. 
With the average age of U.S. farmers 
being nearly 60 years old, do we really 
want to force surviving spouses or 
heirs to sell half of the farm they in-
herited simply to continue farming the 
land that has been passed down for gen-
erations? 
Family farms are the backbone of 
American agriculture. Roughly 98 per-
cent of all U.S. farms are family owned 
and operated. Whether you like large 
family farming operations or not, they 
account for 44 percent of total U.S. 
farm production annually. That is a 
staggering figure, given that American 
farmers contributed $136 billion to the 
U.S. gross domestic product in 2019. 
These people who put food on our table 
and clothes on our back do not need to 
go out of business because they are 
being taxed at every turn, punished for 
their achievements and sacrifices. 
Initial reports from the Biden admin-
istration suggested that the proposed 
tax changes I am discussing would have 
very little impact on America’s farm-
ers and ranchers. However, recent re-
search 
and 
analysis 
conducted 
by 
Texas A&M University paints a very 
different picture. 
For instance, should the proposed 
capital gains tax changes and genera-
tional transfers become enacted into 
law, nearly all U.S. family farms would 
face higher taxes. Nationwide, the av-
erage additional tax liability per farm 
under the capital gains tax change 
would be $726,104. Mississippi would be 
the State most heavily affected, with 
an average additional tax liability per 
farm of $2.1 million. It is totally unbe-
lievable. 
Should the estate tax changes be-
come law, recent analysis also deter-
mined that nearly half of all U.S. fam-
ily farms would face higher taxes. The 
average additional tax liability per 
farm nationwide would be $2.2 million, 
and the fifth most heavily impacted 
State would again be Mississippi, with 
an average additional tax liability per 
farm of $4.6 million. That is totally in-
credible. As a former ag commissioner 
of Mississippi, I personally know these 
farmers and their families. This is 
truly unbelievable. 
More than 3 years of net cash farm 
income would be needed to meet these 
additional tax obligations alone. That 
is simply unmanageable. I am per-
plexed as to why Democrats want to 
place the highest tax burden on one of 
the most economically challenged and 
socially disadvantaged States in the 
Nation, my home State of Mississippi.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5001 
July 21, 2021 
Let’s not forget that in rural Amer-
ica, the primary source of jobs and in-
come are often associated with agri-
culture. It is the No. 1 industry in Mis-
sissippi, employing more than 17 per-
cent of the State’s workforce either di-
rectly or indirectly. 
If family farms are taxed out of busi-
ness, far more than the farmers will 
suffer. Low-income and minority popu-
lations across rural America will lose 
jobs and be forced to rely on govern-
ment support. I hope this is not the un-
derlying plan of my Democratic col-
leagues. 
Let me be clear. For those who are 
willing to pay for reckless spending by 
punishing 
America’s 
farmers 
and 
ranchers and everyone who relies on 
them, you will be doing far more than 
just that. You will be running off our 
next generation of farmers. You will be 
making it easier for large corporations 
owned by foreign adversaries, such as 
China, to buy up available farmland, 
and you will be ensuring that every 
American pays more for the food they 
eat and the clothes they wear. The list 
goes on. 
I know there is a deep desire on the 
other side of the aisle to enact a reck-
less tax-and-spending spree that makes 
Americans more dependent on the Fed-
eral Government, but family farms 
cannot be caught up in the administra-
tion’s punitive dragnet to find ways to 
pay for it. 
Any changes to the Federal Tax Code 
should be geared toward supporting 
economic growth and helping the next 
generation keep these family-owned 
operations alive. I hope that we can all 
come to our senses on this. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
NOMINATION OF BONNIE D. 
JENKINS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the nomination of Bonnie Jenkins to 
be the next Under Secretary for Arms 
Control and International Security. 
The position for which Ambassador 
Jenkins has been nominated is one of 
the most vital senior security positions 
in the Department of State. This indi-
vidual is responsible for overseeing nu-
clear policy and nonproliferation ef-
forts, directing U.S. arms sales and se-
curity assistance policy, dealing with 
the legacies of unexploded munitions 
and landmines, and orchestrating glob-
al cooperation among both allies and 
adversaries on critical national secu-
rity issues. 
As the United States is preparing for 
its first Strategic Stability Dialogue 
with Russia, which will occur later this 
month, it is absolutely critical we have 
a Senate-confirmed leader in the State 
Department 
to 
effectively 
compete 
with and confront Moscow’s challenges 
to our national security. This meeting 
will set the tone for U.S. diplomatic ef-
forts to limit Russia’s nuclear arsenal, 
which is crucial at a time when we are 
also witnessing the initial stages of a 
major build-up of Chinese nuclear 
forces. 
I am pleased to be supporting Ambas-
sador Jenkins’s nomination for this po-
sition, and I am confident that her ex-
tensive experience in the State Depart-
ment and her 22 years in the Air Force 
and Naval Reserves provide her with 
the type of background and knowledge 
required to meet the challenges that 
await her, if confirmed. 
During the Obama administration, 
Ambassador Jenkins’ spearheaded ef-
forts to fight nuclear terrorism. She 
helped coordinate four nuclear security 
summits which sought to persuade na-
tions around the world to secure vul-
nerable nuclear material that might 
fall into the hands of dangerous actors. 
For over 20 years, she served as an in-
telligence officer in the U.S. Naval Re-
serves, retiring as a lieutenant com-
mander. She also holds multiple de-
grees, including a Ph.D., a master of 
laws, a law degree, and a master in 
public administration. 
Outside of government she has con-
sistently 
empowered 
voices 
rarely 
heard in national security debates, pro-
viding a different but important per-
spective on how the United States 
should tackle the threats we confront. 
The fact that Ambassador Jenkin’s 
nomination, someone whose leadership 
is so essential to the State Department 
and to our national security, has lan-
guished on the Senate floor for 56 days 
is a travesty. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination and make sure that this 
critical national security position is 
filled without further delay.

REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise 
on the floor today to honor the legacy 
of one of the country’s most cherished 
heroes and a very dear and close friend 
of mine, John Lewis. 
This past Saturday marked 1 year 
since we said goodbye to Congressman 
Lewis. The pain of his loss is still very 
fresh for both my wife Marcelle and 
me, as it is for millions of Americans. 
He wasn’t just a moral giant and a 
guiding light for the world, he was, as 
he always told me, my brother, and I 
still have such a sense of emotion when 
I think of the time he introduced me as 
his brother. 
For more than six decades, John 
Lewis served the United States with an 
unyielding belief that we could be bet-
ter; that we have a responsibility to 
each other and the world to live up to 
our founding ideals. 
John didn’t spend his life fighting for 
Democrats or Republicans; he fought 
for the rights of all Americans and the 
dignity of all human beings. 
John’s principles were so much big-
ger than party and politics. When he 
saw suffering, he tried to end it; when-
ever he saw injustice, he tried to cor-
rect it; and wherever good trouble was 
needed, he delivered it. 
I knew John as more than just a gen-
erational leader; I knew him as a 
friend. And I can tell you that his dedi-
cation to justice was matched only by 
his fundamental decency as a person. 
John and I served in Congress for 
more than 30 years. In those years, I 
witnessed a tremendous humility and 
empathy that defined his lifetime of 
public service. 
Every day, John embodied the ideals 
he fought for through his unfailing 
generosity and dignity. So I consider 
John Lewis a brother, and it was an 
honor of a lifetime to have him con-
sider me one too. 
It is—I think when we walked down 
the street in Vermont, I just felt sud-
denly so much a person because I was 
walking beside John Lewis. 
But people are seeing where he had 
walked. Many Americans know the sto-
ries of John’s bravery in the face of 
brutality. He was beaten bloody, his 
bones broken, in the heroic efforts to 
bolster the ballot box for millions of 
Americans. 
John wasn’t just on the frontlines of 
our Nation’s great civil rights move-
ment; he was the frontline. John was 
there when the Freedom Riders were 
dragged off their buses and beaten and 
arrested; John was there to lead the 
march from—for freedom from Selma 
to Montgomery, AL; and John was 
there when millions of Americans gath-
ered in Washington to proclaim to the 
country that the time for justice and 
equality was now. John Lewis put his 
body and soul on the line for the 
mighty movement that changed the 
world. 
What fewer Americans may know is 
that John was beloved and respected by 
Members of both parties. It is because 
he believed in his heart that our Na-
tion’s greatest challenges must be 
faced together, regardless of party. 
When he stood there beside Lyndon 
Johnson as he signed the landmark 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, he was 
flanked by Democrats and Republicans. 
In that moment, he absorbed the les-
sons that reaching across the aisle 
wasn’t just a political necessity, it is 
the 
way 
to 
change—everlastingly 
change society. 
And throughout his career in Con-
gress, John embraced bipartisanship. 
He built friendships with Members of 
both parties. For years, John led bipar-
tisan groups of Members of Congress, 
including 
some 
of 
my 
Republican 
friends in this body, down to the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. He 
wanted to commemorate Bloody Sun-
day and the American struggle for 
equal rights. 
I will never forget the iconic photo of 
John. He is flanked on either side by 
Presidents Obama and George W. Bush; 
the three of them, heads bowed in si-
lent reflection, arms and hands linked 
on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for 
Bloody Sunday’s 50th anniversary. 
John Lewis didn’t just cross bridges; 
he built bridges. By bringing people to-
gether, he helped us forge a more per-
fect Union. 
So it is in John’s spirit today that I 
fervently urge my Republican friends 
to join me in restoring and reauthor-
izing the Voting Rights Act. I would 
remind everyone in this body that re-
authorizing 
the 
VRA, 
the 
Voting 
Rights Act, on a bipartisan basis is the 
way we have always done it. I say al-
ways done—the core provisions of the 
VRA have been reauthorized five times, 
and every single time it was with over-
whelming bipartisan support in Con-
gress. 
Look at the Presidents who signed it: 
President Nixon, President Reagan, 
George W. Bush. They all signed the 
Voting Rights Act reauthorizations 
into law because they spoke of the pro-
found importance of the landmark law 
for our democracy. 
I was here in 2006 for the most recent 
VRA reauthorization. Do you know 
what the vote was in this body in 2006? 
It was 98 to 0 in the Senate. In fact, 
many of the Republican Senators still 
serving today voted yes; 98 to 0. You 
can’t do much better than that. 
So let’s honor John Lewis’s legacy 
the way he would want to be honored, 
with solid justified action. I am com-
mitted to working with my Republican 
friends to find a bipartisan compromise 
around my John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, which I proudly re-
named in his honor last Congress. 
For those who knew John Lewis and 
for those who did not, I can say John 
would want us to come together and 
find a path forward to addressing the 
many 
threats 
facing 
Americans’ 
foundational right to vote. I will tell 
you what he wouldn’t accept. He 
wouldn’t accept inaction. So let’s put 
in the hard work and let’s try to live 
up to the memory of John Lewis, our 
hero and our colleague. 
Let’s remember the person who took 
me by the arm and walked me on to 
the floor of the other body one day and 
said to everybody: I am here with my 
brother. 
Every one of us thought of John as 
our brother, and we were proud of that. 
Let us be proud of our brother. Let’s be 
proud of his memory. Let’s be proud of 
America. Let’s be proud of our right to 
vote. Let’s pass and reauthorize the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PADILLA. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join Senator LEAHY and a 
number of our colleagues to remember 
our friend, John Lewis, and reflect on 
his legacy. 
It was a little over a year ago when 
John shared his final message to the 
American people. He wrote, ‘‘Democ-
racy is not a state. It is an act, and 
each generation must do its part to 
help build what we called the Beloved 
Community, a nation and world society 
at peace with itself.’’ 
John devoted his entire life to build-
ing that ‘‘Beloved Community.’’ And in

July 21, 2021 
his final moments, he called on all of 
us to carry that mission forward. He 
told us it is now ‘‘your turn to let free-
dom ring.’’ 
We have an obligation to live up to 
John Lewis’s legacy—and his call to 
action to protect our most funda-
mental freedom of all: the right to 
vote. And we can do that by restoring 
and revitalizing the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
When President Johnson signed the 
Voting Rights Act into law, it marked 
the beginning of a new era of American 
democracy. It ensured that our con-
stitutional rights were not merely 
sketched onto a piece of paper, but en-
forced as well. It ensured that poll 
taxes, literacy tests, and other Jim 
Crow laws could no longer be used to 
deny Black, Brown, and indigenous 
voters access to the ballot box. In the 
words of John Lewis, the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 ‘‘helped liberate not just a 
people but a nation.’’ It brought Amer-
ica closer to our foundational ideals. 
But today, this monument to Amer-
ican freedom is under attack. At this 
very moment, Republican State offi-
cials are working to pass laws that 
make it harder for people, particularly 
racial and ethnic minorities, to vote. 
Nearly 400 of these bills have been in-
troduced in 48 States. Some of these 
laws set new limits on voting by mail, 
others cut hours for polling locations, 
but the hundreds of restrictive voting 
provisions we have seen in recent years 
have 
achieved 
the 
same 
outcome: 
erecting new barriers to the ballot box. 
The proponents of these laws claim 
they are designed to help prevent so- 
called voter fraud. But the truth is, 
‘‘voter fraud’’ is nothing more than a 
fabricated phenomenon. Nearly every 
investigation into the 2020 election, for 
instance, has found no meaningful evi-
dence of voter fraud. The Department 
of Homeland Security called last year’s 
election ‘‘the most secure in American 
history.’’ And more than 80 judges, in-
cluding many conservative judges ap-
pointed by President Trump himself, 
have thrown out baseless challenges 
brought by the former President’s law-
yers. 
But even though the ‘‘Big Lie’’ of 
widespread voter fraud has been de-
bunked, many Republican lawmakers 
are still standing by it. In fact, they 
are using the Big Lie to wage an as-
sault on voting rights in America. You 
see, the laws I mentioned really aren’t 
about securing our elections; they are 
about preventing eligible Americans 
from voting. 
Under section 5 of the original Vot-
ing Rights Act, many of these efforts 
to suppress voters would have been pro-
hibited by the Department of Justice 
or Federal courts. But that authority 
has been greatly diminished. In 2013, 
the conservative majority on the Su-
preme Court essentially nullified sec-
tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act with its 
decision in Shelby County v. Holder. 
And just this month, the Supreme 
Court weakened a remaining key sec-
tion of the Voting Rights Act—section 
2—with its decision in Brnovich v. 
Democratic National Committee. 
This is the trend that has emerged 
over the past decade: State officials 
make it harder for Black, Brown, and 
indigenous Americans to vote, and the 
conservative majority on the Supreme 
Court upholds those laws by whittling 
away at the protections guaranteed 
under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
In her dissent to the Court’s ruling in 
Brnovich, Supreme Court Justice Elena 
Kagan wrote ‘‘in the last decade, this 
court has treated no statute worse’’ 
than the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
Those are unequivocal words. The Su-
preme Court has severely hobbled the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. And only 
Congress has the power—and the con-
stitutional obligation—to restore it to 
its full potential. 
You know, it really wasn’t that long 
ago that reauthorizing the Voting 
Rights Act was a unifying cause. Just a 
few years before the Supreme Court’s 
Shelby decision, the minority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, joined his Repub-
lican colleagues in supporting its reau-
thorization. In expressing his support 
he said, ‘‘This is a piece of legislation 
which has worked.’’ 
To him, and to all of my Republican 
colleagues, I say: Let’s make sure it 
can keep working. Let’s honor John 
Lewis’s legacy by joining together, on 
a bipartisan basis, to support a piece of 
legislation that will revitalize and 
strengthen the original Voting Rights 
Act: the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
I am proud to be working with Sen-
ator LEAHY and our counterparts on 
the House Judiciary Committee to up-
date and reintroduce this bill soon. 
Last Congress, it received bipartisan 
support, and we hope that we will be 
able to expand that support this year. 
What remains to be seen is whether the 
bill will receive the votes necessary to 
overcome a potential filibuster. 
For those of my Republican col-
leagues who have yet to decide where 
they stand on the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, let’s show 
the American people that we can stand 
together. This Senate has the power— 
and the responsibility—to protect our 
most fundamental right as Americans. 
Let’s heed John Lewis’s call and de-
fend it together. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, 1 year 
ago this week, our Nation lost a giant, 
a man with a righteous purpose and a 
remarkable legacy, John Robert Lewis, 
who dedicated his life to the cause of 
justice. 
From Troy, AL, to a bridge in Selma, 
to the Halls of this very Congress, he 
put his body on the line for every 
American’s sacred right to vote. 
John Lewis never stopped fighting 
because he understood that democracy 
is a commitment we have to make 
again and again and again. As he wrote 
in the last days of his life: 
The vote is the most powerful nonviolent 
change agent you have in a democratic soci-
ety. You must use it because it is not guar-
anteed. You can lose it. 
John Lewis understood the power and 
the fragility of our multiracial democ-
racy, because he did so much to build it 
in his lifetime. At the age of 25, he led 
peaceful protesters on a march through 
Alabama to demand their right to vote. 
As the world witnessed, they were at-
tacked, gassed, and beaten by police of-
ficers. 
They were attacked because the right 
to vote is power, and White suprema-
cists feared the power of people of color 
exercising that right. But out of the 
pain and outrage over this Bloody Sun-
day came one of our country’s greatest 
monuments to freedom, the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
For nearly 50 years, the Voting 
Rights Act stood as a guardian of our 
multiracial democracy. It outlawed lit-
eracy tests. It prohibited voting proce-
dures that would deny or abridge the 
right to vote on account of race or 
color. It gave the U.S. Department of 
Justice the power to review any new 
voting rules in places with a history of 
voter suppression and to block rules 
with discriminatory effects. 
Critically, the Voting Rights Act rec-
ognized the important role of the Fed-
eral Government in protecting the 
right to vote. It helped guarantee com-
munities of color their rightful voice in 
our democracy. 
Over time, the Voting Rights Act was 
reauthorized 
four 
times, 
including 
most recently in 2006, when Represent-
ative Lewis and a nearly unanimous 
Congress voted to affirm the continued 
need for its protections. That’s right. 
Passage of the Voting Rights Act and 
every reauthorization of the Act was 
always on a bipartisan basis. 
But in 2013, five conservative Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court overrode 
the bipartisan consensus of Congress. 
In spite of the voluminous record as-
sembled by the Congress and the re-
ality of the country around them, 
these five Justices effectively ended 
preclearance and gutted a key protec-
tion of the Voting Rights Act. 
As the late Justice Ginsburg wrote in 
her dissent, it was ‘‘like throwing away 
your umbrella in a rainstorm because 
you are not getting wet.’’ 
Well, the storm of voter suppression 
is most certainly pouring over us now. 
In 2020, in the midst of an ongoing 
global health pandemic, our Nation 
held one of the most successful and se-
cure elections in our history. Voters of 
color made their voices heard in record 
numbers and confirmed again that our 
democracy is strongest when all eligi-
ble Americans are able to participate. 
But instead of celebrating this re-
markable achievement, Republican leg-
islative leaders in statehouses around 
the country this year have proposed 
and passed bill after bill after bill re-
stricting the right to vote and restrict-
ing access to the ballot. They are doing 
this on the basis of lies about voter 
fraud and rooted firmly in the legacy of 
White supremacy. They continue to do 
so as we speak.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5004 
July 21, 2021 
The Supreme Court’s most recent 
anti-democracy 
decision 
in 
the 
Brnovich case, which eviscerated a key 
remaining protection of the Voting 
Rights Act, will only embolden these 
attacks. 
But, so far, in this Senate, our Re-
publican colleagues have turned a blind 
eye, choosing to be complicit in the 
outright assault on our democracy. 
Senate Republicans have refused to 
even open a debate on voting rights 
legislation. Instead, they prefer to 
abuse the filibuster to enable Repub-
lican legislative leaders across the 
country to continue their assault. 
Our democracy is on the line. The un-
finished work of John Lewis remains. 
We must summon the courage to act. 
That is why I am committed to passing 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, which will protect the 
right to vote for all people. I can think 
of no more fitting way to honor the 
memory of a man who chose our de-
mocracy as the struggle of his lifetime. 
When I was first elected California 
Secretary of State to serve as the Chief 
Elections Officer for the State of Cali-
fornia, I sought out the counsel of John 
Lewis. For more than 45 minutes dur-
ing our first meeting, and time and 
again after that, John guided me with 
his wisdom, taught me by his example, 
and inspired me through his courage. 
He was always gracious with his time, 
warm with his spirit, and true in his 
conviction. And he reminded me, as he 
reminded so many of us, that our 
struggle is a struggle of a lifetime. 
As he said, we cannot be afraid to 
make some noise and get into good 
trouble, necessary trouble, along the 
way. In fact, given the circumstances, 
it is exactly what we need to do today. 
As a bipartisan Senate, if we can, or as 
the elected Democratic majority, if we 
must, it is imperative that we pass leg-
islation to preserve our democracy. 
We must carry the torch that John 
Lewis carried for us for so long and 
build for all Americans a democracy 
that is as free, as fair, as accessible, 
and as inclusive as we can possibly 
make it. And we must remain hopeful 
in this pursuit. 
You see, despite the scars that he 
bore and the hatred that he faced 
down, John Lewis was fundamentally a 
hopeful man, a man who never aban-
doned the youthful spirit that carried 
him across that bridge in Selma, and 
he always looked to the next genera-
tion for leadership, for energy, and for 
inspiration to carry the cause forward. 
It is now on us to take up his work. 
There is no better way for us to honor 
the legacy of John Lewis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
join in the wonderful words of my col-
league from California, a true leader. 
He is someone who has served as an 
election official and the secretary of 
state for the biggest State in our Na-
tion. He knows how important it is to 
count the votes and to make sure we 
allow everyone to vote. 
I come to the floor today to join him 
and to join Senator LEAHY and other of 
our colleagues to honor the legacy of 
Congressman John Lewis and to con-
tinue his fight to make sure that every 
American can make their voice heard 
at the ballot box. 
As my colleagues have mentioned, it 
has been just over a year since John 
Lewis passed. I have always been in 
awe of him. This past week, I had the 
opportunity to reflect on his monu-
mental contributions to our Nation 
when the Senate Rules Committee held 
a field hearing on voting rights in his 
home State of Georgia at the National 
Center for Civil and Human Rights, a 
place that commemorates the civil 
rights movement. 
Today, as we celebrate his legacy, I 
am reminded of his persistence, his re-
silience, and his faith that this country 
could be better if only we put in the 
work. It was his faith in our country 
that led him to Selma, AL, where he 
helped lead 600 marchers across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge on that dark day 
that became known as Bloody Sunday. 
Several times, several years, including 
the last year that he came to that 
bridge before he died, I was able to 
stand with him on the bridge in awe of 
everything he had done. 
The horrific events of that day 
shocked the Nation, with marchers at-
tacked with clubs and tear gas. Con-
gressman Lewis’s skull was fractured. 
He bore the scars until the very end of 
his life. 
Soon after, President Lyndon John-
son came to the Capitol, and, as he 
said, ‘‘with the outrage of Selma still 
fresh,’’ urged Congress to guarantee 
the freedom to vote. Months later, with 
the help of former Minnesota Senator 
and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, 
the Voting Rights Act was signed into 
law. 
One of the times I visited was, in 
fact, the 48th year anniversary of that 
march. That weekend, after 48 years, 
the police chief of Montgomery handed 
his badge to Congressman Lewis and 
apologized for not protecting him and 
the other freedom marchers. Forty- 
eight years is a long time, and it only 
happened because Congressman Lewis 
never quit fighting for progress, for 
civil rights, for economic justice, and 
to defend the voting rights of every 
American. 
But now, more than five decades 
since that day in Selma and since the 
Voting Rights Act became the law of 
the land, so much of the progress that 
Americans have fought and even died 
for is at stake. Throughout our coun-
try’s 245-year history, we have had to 
course-correct and take action to en-
sure that our democracy—for the peo-
ple, by the people—actually lives up to 
its ideals. 
We all had that moment, that night 
after the insurrection when this Cham-
ber, which we are standing in, was 
taken over by those who did not be-
lieve in our election processes and in 
our democracy. And we not only came 
back to this Chamber that night, but, 2 
weeks later, we stood under a beautiful 
blue sky and declared—Democrats or 
Republicans or Independents—that we 
stood with our democracy. 
And as I said that day, that was a 
day where our democracy stood up, 
brushed itself off, and we went forward 
as ‘‘one nation under God, indivisible, 
with life and liberty for all.’’ 
That is why earlier this week, believ-
ing that the job is not done, especially 
when over 400 bills have been intro-
duced across this country in nearly 
every State, with 28 of them already 
signed into law, including an egregious 
example in Georgia—that is why—for 
the first time in two decades, we took 
the Senate Rules Committee on the 
road and held a field hearing in Atlanta 
to shine a spotlight on what is hap-
pening in Georgia and in States across 
the country to undermine the freedom 
to vote. 
We heard from State legislators and 
a former election official who had lost 
her job after a change in law meant 
that local election officials were taken 
away from their posts. And we heard 
from a voter, a veteran who had stood 
in line for hours and hours just to cast 
his vote. And when I asked him, when 
he signed up for the Air Force, was 
there a waiting line, he said no. 
Well, there shouldn’t be a waiting 
line to vote in the United States of 
America, and that is why it is so crit-
ical that Congress pass basic Federal 
standards—that is the For the People 
Act—to ensure that all Americans can 
cast a ballot in a way that works best 
for them and that is safe for them, 
whether it is early voting, whether it is 
vote by mail, which so many Ameri-
cans in red States and blue used across 
the country during the pandemic. 
And as we know the history of that, 
in States like the Presiding Officer’s 
State of Colorado, or States like Utah, 
known as a red State, or States like 
Oregon, that has been the way they 
have been doing business safely for a 
long time. And many of us, for the first 
time, voted in that way. 
But there are other ways as well, 
with dropoff ballot boxes. Some people 
have not registered way early because 
maybe they moved to a State, as we 
know happens in the United States, or 
maybe they are a young person at col-
lege, or maybe they forgot to register 
and they have to catch up and do it. 
None of those reasons, those simple 
reasons that could happen to anyone in 
their everyday life, should be reasons 
to ban people from voting, and that is 
why these basic Federal standards are 
so important. 
When we were in Georgia, we heard 
from Helen Butler, who I mentioned 
was a former election official from 
rural Morgan County, who pointed out 
that it was only after Black voters in-
creased their vote-by-mail numbers in 
the 2020 election that the Georgia Leg-
islature imposed new restrictions on 
mail-in ballots, after all those years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5005 
July 21, 2021 
Georgia State Senator Sally Harrell 
also testified about how the bill was 
rushed through—this restrictive voting 
bill—through the Georgia Legislature 
without meaningful debate. 
We heard about the provisions of the 
bill 
that 
basically 
say 
that 
non-
partisan—that is already required, and 
that is correct—nonpartisan volunteers 
can’t even give voters water when they 
stand in line, despite the fact that 
there were voters that we heard from 
the day before, with Senator MERKLEY 
and Stacy Abrams, and those voters 
stood in line for 3 hours, for 4 hours, 
and for 7 hours. 
We heard about the runoff changes. 
The runoff used to be 9 weeks in Geor-
gia. It was reduced to 28 days. And dur-
ing the runoff period, you can’t vote, 
under the new law, on Saturdays and 
Sundays. You can vote that way during 
the general election. All of this—all of 
this—is done, in the words of one North 
Carolina judge, many years ago, in a 
decision, who said: This law discrimi-
nates with surgical precision—literally 
going through ways that people voted, 
literally noticing that 70,000 new voters 
registered during the runoff, and then 
banning that because you have to reg-
ister now 29 days ahead, when the time 
for the runoff is 28 days. How obvious 
can you get? 
Where you live and what your ZIP 
Code is should not dictate whether or 
not you can vote for President or U.S. 
Senate or Congress or Governor or any 
election. We owe it to the people of this 
country, and to those across the coun-
try who stood in line for hours to cast 
a ballot, to take action and protect the 
fundamental right to vote. 
I know a little bit about that be-
cause, in my State of Minnesota, near-
ly every single election has the highest 
voter turnout in the country. And 
guess what. We have elected Repub-
lican Governors with those rules that 
allow for more people to vote and the 
highest voter turnout. We have elected 
Democratic Governors, and we have 
elected Jesse Ventura. What I have no-
ticed is not who wins, given that we are 
the only State in the country that has 
one State House that is Republican and 
one State House that is Democratic, 
given that our congressional delegation 
in the House is split evenly and has 
changed over time. It is not really who 
wins. It is how people feel about elec-
tions. They are part of the franchise we 
call democracy. 
So they will come up to me and say, 
‘‘You know, I didn’t vote for you, but 
whatever; you are doing OK,’’ or ‘‘I 
have this concern.’’ But they feel like 
they are part of the action. That is 
what our goal should be, to have all 
Americans feel like they are part of the 
action. 
We must meet this moment. As 
President Biden said in Philadelphia 
last week, this is the ‘‘test of our 
time.’’ So what do we do? Well, first, 
we must pass the For the People Act, 
which Senators SCHUMER and MERKLEY 
and I introduced, along with many oth-
ers, to ensure that all Americans can 
cast their ballot. 
It is nothing radical. You know why 
it is not radical? It is firmly based in 
the Constitution. On the basic voting 
rights, the Constitution literally says 
that Congress can make or alter the 
rules and the manner in which Federal 
elections occur. That has never been 
questioned. It has been affirmed time 
and time again. 
The other bill, the bill we are focused 
on today, Congressman Lewis’s bill, 
that is the Voting Rights Act, and you 
restore the Voting Rights Act after a 
Supreme Court decision struck down 
parts of that bill. I didn’t agree with it. 
I agreed with then-Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg’s dissent, but you fix it with 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
It is now Congress’s responsibility— 
the Supreme Court decision made that 
clear—to restore and modernize the 
Voting Rights Act and provide the Fed-
eral Government with the necessary 
tools to combat the assault on Ameri-
cans’ right to vote. We must recommit 
to the original goal of the Voting 
Rights Act to end discrimination in 
voting in America. We know this is 
something, historically, until recent 
years, that brought everyone together. 
The Senate reauthorized the Voting 
Rights Act in 1982 by a vote of 85 to 8, 
including 43 Republicans; in 1992, by a 
vote of 75 to 20, including 25 Repub-
licans; and in 2006—2006—with a unani-
mous 98 to 0 vote, including 51 Repub-
licans. And I don’t think anyone with a 
straight face can say: Well, the reason 
we don’t need to do this anymore is 
that we don’t have any discriminatory 
laws being enacted on the State basis 
or there aren’t any laws being enacted 
that limit voting. 
Truly, maybe you should read some 
of the court decisions, if you think 
that. 
I would say there is a stronger argu-
ment to do this, both sides of the aisle. 
John Lewis’s bill is so important, and 
it isn’t a substitute for passing the For 
the People bill, but we must do that, as 
well as include election infrastructure 
funding 
in 
the 
reconciliation 
bill, 
which I believe will be coming our way 
soon. 
I will end with this. Last Sunday, I 
had the privilege of attending services 
at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in At-
lanta, where I got to hear Reverend 
WARNOCK. There was a guest preacher, 
but for me it was like he was also 
preaching. And I got to hear him say 
something I will never forget. He said 
this: 
A vote is a prayer; it’s a prayer for a better 
world, a prayer for your kids’ education, a 
prayer that you’re going to finally be able to 
do something about this world’s environ-
ment. 
So during the last election, we saw 
an unprecedented number of people go 
to the polls to do just that. Not every 
one of their candidates won, but they 
believed enough in our democracy, in 
the middle of a public health crisis, 
that they went and cast their vote. 
In Congressman John Lewis’s words, 
‘‘The right to vote is precious and al-
most sacred, and one of the most im-
portant blessings of our democracy.’’ 
Today, we must be vigilant in pro-
tecting that blessing. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise 
here today to give emphasis to some-
thing I think is very important—it has 
been done basically annually—and that 
is talking about our Pledge of Alle-
giance. It is an expression of patriot-
ism and commitment to our great Na-
tion. 
The United States is a symbol of 
freedom around the world. It is a bea-
con for ‘‘the land of opportunity.’’ 
Today, let’s reaffirm our allegiance 
to the United States. I urge my col-
leagues to pass this annual resolution 
that simply expresses support for our 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
This resolution was first raised by 
Senator Tom Daschle back in 2002 and 
passed without objection. Now, nearly 
20 years later, this resolution is prob-
ably more important than ever. 
We have seen countless attacks on 
our flag and the values it represents. 
The American flag is a symbol of hope 
and perseverance across the world. 
Whether in Cuba, Hong Kong, or Ven-
ezuela, those suffering under tyran-
nical regimes proudly wave the Amer-
ican flag in protest. 
The U.S. Senate must stand in sup-
port of the Pledge of Allegiance, one of 
our most powerful expressions of na-
tional unity. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 309, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 309) expressing sup-
port for the Pledge of Allegiance. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 309) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. BRAUN. I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to discuss facts and fiction. Recently, 
FOX News reporter Peter Doocy asked 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki 
about a Biden administration official’s 
claim that Republicans have defunded 
the police by not voting to pass Biden’s 
wasteful $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. Ms. 
Psaki doubled down on the idea that it 
is Republicans and not Democrats who 
want to defund the police. 
When a White House Press Secretary 
gives a press briefing, you expect some 
spin. You expect some verbal bobbing 
and weaving if the topic is unflattering 
to the administration. But when Jen 
Psaki tried to blame Republicans for 
defunding the police, it wasn’t spin. It 
was horse manure. It was gaslighting. 
For over a year, Democrats and left-
wing activists have been calling over 
and over and over again to defund the 
police. And many Democrat-led city 
councils and Democrat mayors have 
done so, cutting and even slashing po-
lice budgets. As a result of those reck-
less policies, we are seeing a deeply 
concerning wave of violent crime in 
American cities across the country. 
The chief White House spokesperson 
blaming Republicans for defunding the 
police is like an arsonist showing up at 
the fire and blaming the firemen. It is 
like the Chinese Communist Party 
blaming America for the Wuhan virus. 
It is like OJ saying he is going to help 
find the real killer. It is absurd. It is ri-
diculous. And Democrats know it. 
Let’s look at the facts. Democrats 
have called explicitly to defund the po-
lice for over a year and have been suc-
cessful in doing it. New York Mayor 
Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, last sum-
mer pledged to cut the NYPD budget 
by $1 billion, and then he did so. New 
York City passed a budget that did in-
deed cut $1 billion from the police de-
partment. 
Just a couple of months ago, de 
Blasio was forced to backtrack. He re-
alized what a terrible decision it had 
been because now he is working to re-
verse it. 
AOC, the darling of the extreme left-
wing, has said: ‘‘Defunding [the] police 
means defunding [the] police’’ and 
‘‘The fight to defund [the police] con-
tinues.’’ There is not a lot of ambiguity 
in what AOC is saying. 
And she is not alone. How about Rep-
resentative RASHIDA
TLAIB. She has 
called for ‘‘no more policing.’’ Stop and 
think about that for a minute. This is 
an elected Democratic Member of Con-
gress whose policy objective is no more 
policing. Those are her own words. 
How 
about 
Representative 
ILHAN 
OMAR. She has said: ‘‘You can’t really 
reform a department that is rotten to 
the 
root.’’ 
An 
elected 
Democratic 
Member of Congress describing police 
departments as ‘‘rotten to the root.’’ 
Again, those are her words. 
And then there is Representative 
AYANNA PRESSLEY, who has introduced 
legislation to defund police officers in 
public schools. And she has said that 
defunding the police is about ‘‘true rep-
arations.’’ Well, maybe this is just a 
few fringe Democrats in the House of 
Representatives. Maybe it is not a 
broader 
policy 
of 
the 
Democratic 
Party. 
What about Joe Biden? Uncle Joe 
can’t possibly support defunding the 
police, right? Well, if you thought so, 
you would be wrong because Joe Biden 
nominated two of the leading advo-
cates of abolishing the police—Vanita 
Gupta and Kristen Clarke—to senior 
positions at the U.S. Department of 
Justice. One of them is the No. 3 offi-
cial at the Department of Justice. The 
other is the head of civil rights at the 
Department of Justice. Both had writ-
ten, as recently as last year, explicit 
calls for defunding the police, and they 
got rewarded with helping run the De-
partment of Justice. 
But surely, you might say, even if 
Joe Biden gave in to the activists and 
nominated these folks, there are Demo-
crats in this Chamber who would say 
defunding the police is too much; let’s 
not go that far. Well, if you would say 
that, you would be wrong because both 
of those nominees, two of the leading 
advocates for defunding the police, 
were confirmed when every single 
Democrat in this Chamber voted to 
confirm them—100 percent. 
The next time you see a Democrat 
describing themselves as moderate, 
reasonable, not one of those crazies 
saying things like ‘‘defund the police,’’ 
maybe you should ask them why they 
voted to confirm two of the leading ad-
vocates for defunding the police to sen-
ior positions at the Department of Jus-
tice. 
Democrat-led city councils all over 
the country are following the same 
game plan, and they have voted over 
and over and over again to defund the 
police. Last year, the Los Angeles City 
Council cut the police budget by $150 
million. Portland cut $15 million from 
its police budget. Minneapolis cut $8 
million from its police budget. Seattle 
cut its police budget by 18 percent. 
Now, what do these city have in com-
mon? They are run by Democrats. It is 
Democratic politicians who are slash-
ing police budgets. And what have the 
results been? Well, sadly, these Demo-
cratic-led cities are reaping what they 
sowed. Crime rates are skyrocketing. 
The New York Times—hardly a right-
wing outfit—the New York Times has 
reported that homicides in Los Angeles 
increased 36 percent, that homicides 
have increased in Portland more than 
82 percent, and that homicides in Min-
neapolis increased nearly 72 percent 
last year. By all appearances, these 
homicide spikes will continue through-
out this year. 
Just a few weeks ago, Democrats 
demonstrated that they couldn’t learn 
from the tragic failure of other cities 
that had slashed the police and seen 
homicides skyrocket. What did they do 
in Oakland, CA? The city council voted 
to cut over $18 million from the police 
department, and Oakland has already 
seen a 90-percent increase in homicides 
over last year. 
The New York Times has also re-
ported data showing that in 2020, homi-
cide rates increased more than 30 per-
cent in big cities. So far, they are in-
creasing again this year. 
According to the Guardian, some pre-
liminary data showed that there were 
4,000 more murders in 2020 than there 
were in 2019—4,000 men, women, and 
children who would be living, breath-
ing, living their lives, raising their 
kids, contributing to the diverse tap-
estry of our Nation if it were not for 
the radicals slashing police budgets be-
cause of extreme ideological commit-
ments 
and 
unleashing 
these 
crimewaves. 
Now, Democrats know that the poli-
tics and the policy of defunding the po-
lice aren’t working for them, which is 
why they are desperately trying to 
backtrack and blame and gaslight Re-
publicans. Yeah, yeah, it is the Repub-
licans who are doing this. Sure, sure, 
that is the ticket. 
Not only did some Democrats blame 
calls to defund the police for close 
races that they lost in November and 
for the razor-thin Democratic majority 
in the U.S. Senate, they also know it 
isn’t popular with the American peo-
ple. A recent USA TODAY poll found 
that only 18 percent of Americans sup-
port defunding the police, and a large 
majority of African Americans don’t 
support defunding the police. The same 
is true for Democratic voters. A large 
majority of Democratic voters don’t 
support defunding the police. But in de-
fiance of the interests of their con-
stituents, Democrats continue to go 
down that road. The facts are that 
Democrats have repeatedly called to 
defund the police, and they have done 
so—this isn’t a theory—they have done 
so in many cities. 
Crime is rising, and radical Demo-
cratic policies have had deadly con-
sequences. Not only have homicides 
risen, but there were more law enforce-
ment officer fatalities in 2020 than 
there had been in 46 years. In 2020, 264 
law enforcement officers tragically 
died in the line of duty, some from 
COVID–19 as a result of being first re-
sponders and others from getting shot 
while on duty. 
After Jen Psaki blamed Republicans 
for defunding the police, Peter Doocy 
asked her to name the Republicans who 
said they were voting against the 
American Rescue Plan—the massive 
leftwing spending plan—that had noth-
ing to do with the police. It was shov-
eling a lot of money to liberal special 
interests. It was giving money to State 
and local governments. So the White 
House argument was, well, some of the 
money to State and local governments 
could theoretically have gone to police, 
so therefore, if you don’t vote for the 
massive trillions of dollars in spending,

you really want to defund the police. 
Well, unsurprisingly, Psaki couldn’t 
name a single Republican who said 
they wanted to defund the police or 
who gave defunding the police as a rea-
son for not voting for Biden’s $1.9 tril-
lion, pork-filled spending bill. 
The fact of the matter is, Repub-
licans are proud to support the police, 
to stand with the men and women of 
blue, while Democrats are demonizing 
and vilifying the brave men and women 
of law enforcement. 
I want to say thank you to every law 
enforcement officer in this country, on 
the Federal level and on the State and 
local level. Thank you for answering 
the call each day, putting on the uni-
form, wearing the badge, and risking 
your life to keep us safe. 
This morning, all across this coun-
try, law enforcement officers woke up, 
they kissed their husband or wife good-
bye, they kissed their kids goodbye, 
and they went out to defend our com-
munities, and they did so not knowing 
if they would come home that night. 
We are proud to stand with the men 
and women of our police departments. 
When it comes to facts and fiction, it 
is a cynical and calculated lie from the 
Biden White House that it is anybody 
other than Democrats who are leading 
the foolhardy charge to abolish and 
defund the police. It is dangerous, 
crime rates are skyrocketing, and it is 
an exceptionally bad idea. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Maryland. 
HELSINKI COMMISSION 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time to talk about the work 
of the U.S. Helsinki Commission in a 
recent opportunity we had to partici-
pate in the OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly. 
I am joined on the floor by Senator 
WICKER, who is the Republican chair of 
the Helsinki Commission. The two of 
us have worked together in a non-
partisan, bipartisan manner in regards 
to the work of the Helsinki Commis-
sion. I just want to spend a few min-
utes, and then I am going to yield the 
floor and allow Senator WICKER to give 
his comments. 
The OSCE, as the chair is fully aware 
as a member of the Commission, rep-
resents the U.S. participation in the 
Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe—57 states, which in-
cludes all of Europe, all of the former 
Republics of the Soviet Union, and 
Canada and the United States. 
The Commission works on the prin-
ciple of three buckets: one for political 
affairs and security, another for eco-
nomic and environmental progress, and 
the third on democracy and human 
rights. But it recognizes—and I think 
this has been the hallmark of the Hel-
sinki Commission—that you can’t have 
advancements on political affairs or se-
curity or economic or environmental 
progress unless you make progress on 
democracy and human rights, that 
they are interwoven. In the Helsinki 
Commission, the OSCE is best known 
for its advancements for basic human 
rights. 
So I think of the initiatives that we 
have had in the Helsinki Commission 
for dealing with trafficking in humans 
and the legislation that came out of 
that and how we led the global re-
sponse to dealing with trafficking. I 
think about the efforts we made in re-
gards to tolerance, dealing with anti- 
Semitism, racism, and intolerance and 
how we have made progress throughout 
the entire OSCE region. I think about 
the issues we did in regards to sanc-
tions against human rights violators so 
they cannot use our banking system or 
visit our country, the Magnitsky-type 
sanctions. All of that came out of the 
work of the Helsinki Commission. 
So one of the major arms of our work 
is the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, 
which is the group of parliamentarians 
who meet every year and have meet-
ings throughout the year to exchange 
views and to carry out the principles of 
the Helsinki Final Act. 
For the last year and a half, we have 
been compromised because we haven’t 
had an opportunity to meet in person, 
and it required us to meet by internet, 
and we have, but we had a unique op-
portunity during the last recess period 
to actually travel and meet with the 
parliamentarians. We had an OSCE 
Parliamentary Assembly annual meet-
ing in Vienna. And we had a chance to 
do this in a hybrid manner. So we were 
able to travel 12-strong from the U.S. 
Congress to be at that meeting, and we 
were joined by five others here in the 
United States, including our Presiding 
Officer, to participate in the Par-
liamentary Assembly, and we were able 
to advance a lot of very important 
issues. 
But I must tell you, we were noticed 
at this meeting. The U.S. presence was 
critically important in dealing with 
some very timely issues. I know that 
Senator WICKER will talk about this. 
He is one of the great leaders of the 
Parliamentary Assembly. He is Vice 
President of the Parliamentary Assem-
bly. We are very proud of the leader-
ship position that he holds. 
By the way, his election was in Vi-
enna to be the Vice President of the 
Parliamentary Assembly. We had mul-
tiple candidates and several elected to 
Vice Presidents, but Senator WICKER 
led the ballot with the largest number 
of votes, which I think speaks to his 
well-thought-of 
respect 
among 
the 
OSCE parliamentarians. 
We wanted to make sure that this 
was 
a 
substantive 
meeting. 
Quite 
frankly, the leadership of the Par-
liamentary Assembly said: Let’s just 
get in there and get it over with and 
not bring up anything controversial. 
But that is not the way we operate. We 
have to take up current issues. 
So we took up the issue of tolerance. 
I was happy to sponsor a resolution 
that ultimately passed by unanimous 
vote that speaks to anti-Semitism, rac-
ism, intolerance, and the growth of 
hate in the OSCE region. But we also 
made sure that we considered the re-
cent elections in Belarus and how un-
fair those elections were and how Mr. 
Lukashenko has been acting in a way 
that is so contrary to the human rights 
of the people who live there, and the 
election results there do not reflect the 
will of the people. 
We also had a chance to make sure 
we took up the issues concerning 
Ukraine. Once again, there was a lot of 
controversy on why you should bring 
that up during this meeting. We did. 
We supported that to make it clear 
that Russia’s aggression and its occu-
pation of Crimea and its interference 
in eastern Ukraine will never be recog-
nized as legitimate by the United 
States or, by that matter, the Par-
liamentary Assembly, because we re-
sponded in all of those areas. 
I am pleased to tell you that we sup-
ported Margareta Cederfelt, who is 
going to be the President of the OSCE 
Parliamentary Assembly in Sweden, 
and we look forward to her visit here in 
the United States. 
RICHARD
HUDSON, 
Representative 
HUDSON, will be the chair of the first 
committee. So we are going to have ac-
tive participation in the Parliamen-
tary Assembly. 
We had the chance to visit some 
other countries. But if I might, I think 
I am going to yield the floor and give 
my good friend and the leader of our 
congressional delegation trip an oppor-
tunity to expand on some of the things 
we were able to do in the OSCE Par-
liamentary Assembly. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Maryland, 
who has been such a leader in the area 
of human rights and international rec-
ognition of the challenges that our 
world faces today. I do appreciate his 
leadership and his partnership. We 
have worked shoulder to shoulder on so 
many issues. 
Yes, I proudly rise with him this 
afternoon to talk about a very valuable 
series of meetings that our 12-member 
delegation had in 4 countries in Europe 
in recent days. This was Republicans 
and Democrats from the House and 
Senate, a truly bipartisan and bi-
cameral delegation—a very large dele-
gation—which I think my colleague 
will agree made a strong statement on 
behalf of the United States of America 
and on behalf of the U.S. House and 
Senate about the way we view Euro-
pean engagement and our partnership 
and friendship with the 50-plus member 
countries of the OSCE and their Par-
liamentary Assembly. 
We visited Vienna, Austria, for the 
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. 
As Senator CARDIN
mentioned, we 
met with great success. Yes, I was re-
elected to the position of vice presi-
dent, and I appreciate the support of 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
House and Senate in helping me get 
those votes to receive another 3-year 
term there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5008 
July 21, 2021 
RICHARD HUDSON, our colleague from 
the House of Representatives, has been 
very active as chairman of Committee 
No. 1 in the Parliamentary Assembly. 
He is highly regarded. He was reelected 
without opposition. So there are two 
bits of success there. 
And then the great piece of work, ac-
tually, was with regard to Senator 
CARDIN’s initiative on the rising hate 
and intolerance that we are seeing all 
around the world, particularly among 
member countries of the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope. Senator CARDIN actually took the 
lead in challenging the leadership of 
the Parliamentary Assembly in saying 
that issues should be discussed. 
Even though they weren’t in an im-
mediate, like, 3-week crisis mode, they 
deserved to be brought forward. And 
Senator CARDIN was able to get his res-
olution considered and passed over-
whelmingly, and we made a strong 
statement on behalf of countering the 
rising hate and intolerance and coun-
tering the use of these things to but-
tress authoritarianism and to stoke 
conflict around the world. 
We also passed a very important res-
olution about the tragedy, the outrage 
that has gone on in Belarus. I can tell 
you, the opposition party leader from 
Belarus was in this Capitol building 
just yesterday talking about the im-
portance of support from places like 
the United States Congress. 
I can tell you, Madam President, that 
Senator SHAHEEN and I are about to 
send a letter to our colleagues asking 
any and all of us to join a Freedom 
Caucus for the Belarusian people, the 
Belarus Freedom Caucus. We asked the 
opposition 
leader, 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, to tell us whether 
that would be helpful. She said the for-
mation of this caucus to support the 
freedom movement in Belarus would be 
a strong signal. It would be well re-
ceived and effective on behalf of the op-
position leadership there in Belarus. 
Then, again, we reiterated our oppo-
sition to what Russia has done in 
Ukraine and particularly to the recent 
Russian military buildup and ongoing 
aggression in Ukraine. We did a lot 
there with the Parliamentary Assem-
bly. 
We went on to Estonia, met with 
leadership there—a former President, 
the current Prime Minister, other lead-
ers. And, also, we had a chance to trav-
el to the very easternmost part of Es-
tonia and actually travel on the Narva 
River and look right across to Russia 
and the security guards there, under-
standing what our Estonian allies are 
up against with Putin’s Russia staring 
right across the river at their freedom 
and democracy. 
From there, we joined the Three Seas 
conference in Sofia, Bulgaria. I can tell 
you, this is a group of Eastern Euro-
pean former Soviet Bloc countries that 
are striving to be in charge of their 
own infrastructure and rely less on the 
Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. I 
think the fact that 12 Americans 
showed up, participated, met with 
Heads of state at that conference made 
a very strong statement of American 
support for freedom and for looking 
westwardly in trying to get their prob-
lems solved and their infrastructure 
needs met. 
We also had a very meaningful visit 
to Norway, where we saw some Amer-
ican-Norwegian defense initiatives. I 
am very proud of the partnership that 
this Helsinki Commission—our organ 
of the American OSCE PA—and the 
way that we joined together to express 
our support for freedom, for democ-
racy, for the rule of law, for opposing 
corruption, both at the petty local 
level and also at the larger State-spon-
sored level. 
One other thing before I yield back 
and let my friend close. Particularly in 
Bulgaria, but also all during our trip, 
we were met with hearty thanks for 
the United States leadership in the 
global Magnitsky Act. This began as an 
initiative with Senator CARDIN, Sen-
ator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and 
me several years ago directed—during 
the 
Obama 
administration—directed 
toward individual Russians who had 
violated human rights and individual 
liberty in a very outrageous and gross 
way, allowing us to sanction individ-
uals rather than causing harm to the 
people of Russia in that case. That has 
been expanded now to the global level 
and other countries are adopting this. 
But I can tell you, when we arrived 
in Bulgaria, we were met with great 
thanks from people who are trying to 
combat lawlessness and corruption at 
the top level of government. 
I just have to say, of course, BEN 
CARDIN has been the premier leader in 
this worldwide effort. It was gratifying 
to know and to learn firsthand on the 
ground there in Sofia, Bulgaria, that 
an initiative that began right here in 
this U.S. Senate years ago, and con-
tinues to this day, is having a bene-
ficial effect on the people all across Eu-
rope and particularly in some of the 
countries that we visited. 
I yield back to the Senator from 
Maryland. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let 
me 
again 
thank 
Senator 
WICKER. 
Thank you for your leadership on so 
many issues. 
But on this congressional delegation, 
for those who are not familiar, it is not 
easy to put together the type of oppor-
tunities to advance American values. 
And Senator WICKER took the responsi-
bility as the leader of our delegation to 
make sure that we had the opportuni-
ties to advance American values. I 
thank him for all the effort he put into 
it. It was certainly extremely success-
ful. 
I just want to emphasize a few things 
before closing. 
One, in Vienna, we did have an oppor-
tunity to meet with Rafael Grossi, who 
is the Director General of the IAEA. 
That is the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency, which has the responsi-
bility of monitoring the nuclear pro-
grams throughout the world. Obvi-
ously, it has played a bigger role in re-
gard to the program in Iran, and it was 
monitoring exactly what was hap-
pening in Iran under the JCPOA. They 
now don’t have the same access, and we 
had a chance to talk with the Director 
General as to the challenges with the 
Iranian program. And I think it was 
helpful for all of us to understand ex-
actly the role that the IAEA can play 
in regard to getting us information 
about what is happening on the ground 
in Iran. 
Senator WICKER
talked about our 
visit to Estonia, a strong ally partner, 
NATO partner. We showed our support 
by going to Narva, which is on the Rus-
sian border. It is a town that has a ma-
jority of Russian-speaking Estonians. 
It is an interesting community. But we 
could see across the river, very clearly, 
the Russian patrol boats. We know and 
heard firsthand of the concern of the 
Estonians. They saw what happened in 
Ukraine and they worry that same 
thing could happen in Estonia with 
Russian aggression. 
I must tell you, our presence to rein-
force the NATO commitment, I think, 
was an extremely important message 
that we gave to the Estonian people. 
Mr. WICKER. Would the gentleman 
yield on that point? 
Mr. CARDIN. I would be glad to 
yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. If I might add, people 
in Narva, Estonia, and people in the 
city across the river have access to 
each other across a bridge there. And it 
is clear to the people on the Russian 
side that their cousins and friends in 
Narva, Estonia, live a better life and 
have a better standard of living in this 
free country, this NATO ally called Es-
tonia, than the Russian cousins and 
friends have on the other side. 
I just thought I would add that to the 
discourse before Senator CARDIN moves 
on to discussing Norway and Bulgaria. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let 
me move onto Bulgaria very briefly. 
Senator WICKER did cover Bulgaria. 
The Three Seas Initiative, I wasn’t 
that familiar with it before traveling 
to Bulgaria. It is an initiative by 12 
States that are basically part of the 
Eastern 
European 
Coalition, 
states 
that are developing democratic institu-
tions and democratic economies after 
the fall of the Soviet Union. They need 
to build up their resilience as a collec-
tive entity in energy, transportation, 
and digital infrastructure. 
The Three Seas Initiative is to at-
tract investment to connect the 12 
countries together on infrastructure 
needs. It is for many reasons. It is for 
its own economic strength and growth, 
but also for resiliency against the ef-
forts of China on its Belt and Road Ini-
tiative, which is trying to infiltrate

these countries and convert their way 
of economy to more of the Chinese sys-
tem. 
The Three Seas Initiative is an effort 
to have their own independent way of 
attracting capital. The United States 
is participating in the Three Seas. We 
are not a member, but we are partici-
pating and providing resources for the 
fund that is being developed that would 
be leveraged for these type of invest-
ments. 
While we were in Bulgaria, we had a 
chance to have bilateral meetings. 
There were 12 Heads of state there. We 
had bilateral meetings with the Presi-
dent of Poland, Bulgaria, Latvia, and 
Romania. We had very constructive 
discussions about what is happening in 
their country. 
We raised Helsinki issues with all 
these countries. Senator WICKER
al-
ready talked about how we were wel-
comed by the Bulgarian leadership in 
regards 
to 
the 
imposition 
of 
the 
Magnitsky sanctions. We are heroes. 
They feel like they have a second 
chance to try to develop the type of 
anti-corruption mechanisms that they 
desperately need. 
Our visit to Varna, which is on the 
Black Sea, was very educational to see 
how Russia is trying to dominate the 
Black Sea area and one of the reasons 
why they are so aggressive in Ukraine 
and the Crimea. 
I think that was extremely helpful 
for us to understand the security risks 
and how we have to work with our 
NATO partners to protect the Black 
Sea area, particularly from the poten-
tial 
aggression—not 
potential—from 
the aggression of Russia. 
Also in Bulgaria, we had a chance to 
visit a Roma village. It is not my first 
visit to a Roma village. I have visited 
over the years. It is a real tragic situa-
tion. The Roma population have been 
in Europe for centuries. They lived in 
communities for hundreds of years, yet 
they do not have property rights. 
They have lived in their homes, and 
yet they do not have the opportunity 
to have their homes registered. And at 
any time, the government can come in 
and take away their property without 
compensation. 
They rarely have reliable utilities. 
The village we visited did not have 
water systems, so they had to use out-
houses, et cetera. They had limited 
availability of fresh water. Their util-
ity service is not reliable. And they go 
to segregated schools. They don’t have 
the same employment opportunities. 
So we, once again, will raise the 
rights of the Roma population as part 
of our commitment under the Helsinki 
Commission, and we are following up 
with the local officials to try to help in 
that regard. 
Then, lastly, on our way back, we 
visited Norway. I learned a lot because 
I did not know about the pre-posi-
tioning program. I know my friend 
Senator WICKER already knew about 
this from his Armed Services service, 
but it is where we pre-position equip-
ment so that we can respond rapidly to 
a circumstance anywhere in the world. 
The Norway pre-positioning is actually 
used to help us in regard to the Middle 
East and our needs in the Middle East. 
So it was an extremely, extremely, I 
think, productive visit to these coun-
tries. I think we did carry out our com-
mitment under the Helsinki Commis-
sion, and we advanced American val-
ues. I think we represented our country 
well, and we were very well noticed. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, one 
other thing that our colleagues might 
not understand about the OSCE is their 
role in election observation. 
As we were leaving Sofia on the 
morning of July 11, we crossed paths 
with some other representatives from 
the OSCE from European countries 
who were there to observe the par-
liamentary elections being held in Bul-
garia that very day. Also, on the same 
day, Moldova, another member of the 
OSCE, was having parliamentary elec-
tions. 
We have every hope that the results 
of these elections will be a further re-
solve in those two nation members to 
counter the corruption at the highest 
level, and we want to congratulate 
both of those member states of the 
OSCE for free and fair elections in Eu-
rope. 
With that, I thank my colleague. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
need for integrity in our elections. 
On Monday, the Democrats on the 
Rules Committee took a field trip. The 
Democrats went to Georgia. They con-
tinued their efforts there to start a 
panic about election laws. Now, I am 
sure they will take more field trips in 
the months ahead. Taking over State 
election laws seems to be the Demo-
crats’ No. 1 priority. It was their No. 1 
bill in the House, H.R. 1. It was their 
No. 1 bill in the Senate, S. 1. The 
Democrats claim that they are only re-
sponding to reforms passed in the 
States, and they say it is just the re-
forms passed in the States this year. 
Yet the election takeover bills that the 
Democrats have introduced were first 
drafted years ago. It is not in response 
to anything. 
Don’t let the Democrats kid you. It 
is an attack on States’ rights and an 
attempt to stack the deck. After 
Democrats took over Washington, they 
rushed this takeover bill right through 
the House of Representatives, with 
NANCY PELOSI at the helm. Then they 
tried to rush a similar bill through the 
Senate, and they failed. Senator SCHU-
MER continues to say the Democrats 
will try again. 
At the State level, most recently in 
Texas, the Democrats are obstructing 
the democratic process in order to 
block election reforms from becoming 
law. Rather than allow an election re-
form bill to pass, Texas Democrats fled 
the State. They took private jets to 
Washington, DC. They hobnobbed with 
the Vice President, and they hob-
nobbed with the Speaker of the House 
and with many Democratic Senators. 
They sent out a lot of fundraising 
emails in the process, and they did a 
lot of television interviews. They took 
a lot of pictures of themselves, pub-
lished them on social media, and told 
everyone they were making a heroic ef-
fort. They said it was a sacrifice. 
Well, six of the Democrats became 
infected with the coronavirus. Then 
they spread the virus. It wasn’t enough 
they infected each other; they spread 
the virus to staffers at the White House 
and here on Capitol Hill. It was a polit-
ical stunt, and it turned into a 
coronavirus superspreader event, and I 
am sure they still consider themselves 
heroes. The hypocrisy is astonishing. 
In the name of the democratic proc-
ess, they actually blocked the demo-
cratic process, disregarded the will of 
the voters, and shut down the function 
of State government. They took a joy-
ride on a private jet and endangered 
the health of many others. They be-
lieve in winning at any cost, and they 
put democracy in second place. This 
whole stunt is not about voter rights; 
it is about power. The Democrats are 
going to keep trying to keep the panic 
alive. 
President Biden went to Philadelphia 
last week, and he spread even more 
falsehoods about the law. Now, I can 
understand why President Biden is 
doing everything he can to change the 
subject from the failures of his current 
administration. 
We 
have 
an 
open 
southern border that Americans are 
very disturbed about; we have surging 
violence in Democratic cities in the 
streets; and we have rising inflation 
that is hitting every family in Amer-
ica. Of course, President Biden doesn’t 
want to talk about his one failure after 
another after another. So, instead, he 
throws rhetorical grenades at the Re-
publicans, and he tells stories. 
The Democrats’ scare tactics on 
State voting laws are not going to 
work. 
Their claims are false, and they have 
been repeatedly disproved. 
The American people are finding out 
what is in the Democrats’ election 
bills, and they do not like it. It is not 
pretty. It is ballot harvesting, which 
people reject. It is automatic voter reg-
istration, which many, many reject. It 
is taxpayer funding of political activi-
ties and campaigns, which Americans 
reject. It is giving the vote to felons on 
parole, which Americans reject.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5010 
July 21, 2021 
It is 800 pages of mandates, which 
Americans hate, and it is banning 
voter ID laws nationwide at a time 
when voters across the country from 
both parties, all political persuasions, 
think voter ID laws are critical to bal-
lot integrity and security. The more 
the American people find out what is in 
these bills, the more they oppose them. 
You know, it has never been easier to 
vote in the United States. You take a 
look at the statistics from this past 
election year, never been easier. The 
American people know it. 
American people support common-
sense laws, which make it easier to 
vote and harder to cheat, but they do 
not support the Democrats’ radical 
election takeover. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, we 
are seeing record numbers of people 
coming to the U.S. Mexican border. I 
am told 63 different countries have 
folks that have arrived at our border. 
In the latest numbers released by the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
CBP, they encountered almost 190,000 
people coming to the United States il-
legally through the southern border 
last month. That is the highest month-
ly number of encounters by CBP in two 
decades. 
This is where we are now. That num-
ber is up 471 percent from June 2020. 
Across the board, every category of 
CBP encounter at the southwest land 
border—single adults, unaccompanied 
children, individuals in a family unit— 
they are surging in 2021, including in 
the hot summer months, when it has 
traditionally been that is when it falls. 
It is important because these people 
coming across in the hot summer 
months are at increased risk for death 
from dehydration and heat exhaustion. 
With June’s tally, CBP’s migrant en-
counters surpassed 1 million for the fis-
cal year. 
Now, in context, the last fiscal year 
had 460,000 encounters; fiscal year 2019, 
980,000. That year was labeled a human-
itarian catastrophe. That was for the 
entire year. Now, we are speaking of 1 
million, and we have 3 months left to 
go in this fiscal year. 
On Monday, Texas and the national 
media broadcast videos of migrants 
trying to force their way past Texas 
border guards. Eight Federal agents 
and police officers pushed back on the 
gate to prevent a rush of about 300 peo-
ple just breaking through, coming 
across the border from Mexico. 
By any definition, this is a crisis—for 
the individual, who is at risk of dying 
of dehydration in the desert; for our 
country, which cannot control the bor-
der crisis; for the infection of the 
COVID and coronavirus situation in 
our 
country, 
because, 
obviously, 
coronavirus could be rampant among 
these folks. 
The 
Biden-Harris 
administration 
could not be doing worse if they inten-
tionally set out to mismanage the situ-
ation. This past weekend, it became 
clear that it is not just a situation on 
the border, but it is also a situation in 
Louisiana. 
On Friday, KTBS, a Shreveport news 
outlet, reported that U.S. Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement—ICE— 
dropped off approximately 80 Haitian 
immigrants with little or no warning 
to local government and law enforce-
ment officials. 
And, again, this is multiple levels. I 
presume that these folks are dropped 
off because we are out of capacity, but 
let’s think about the individual being 
dropped off. A source told KTBS that 
the men had money, but some of the 
women had little or no money—no con-
tacts, no money, they don’t speak the 
language, dropped off in a strange city. 
Multiple Louisiana outlets are re-
porting approximately 400 immigrants 
from 42 countries have been dropped off 
by ICE in Shreveport since the end of 
March, but this is the first we heard. In 
Baton Rouge, WBRZ, the ABC affiliate, 
had photos and video of a similar drop-
off in Baton Rouge on Friday, July 16. 
Monroe, LA, had a similar situation; 
Natchez, MS, similar as well. 
We called ICE over the weekend, and 
yesterday, they—we actually spoke to 
the acting director. He told me the 
dropoffs are ‘‘not our common prac-
tice.’’ I would argue that releasing mi-
grants without notifying local offi-
cials—at least the NGOs that can give 
them help, particularly when there 
isn’t—when some of them have no 
money, no contacts, no place to go, is 
not good. And he acknowledged that. 
In fairness, he acknowledged that that 
was a mistake and that the number of 
70 was too large a number. 
He denied that it was a problem of 
capacity, but, frankly, when we see 
what is happening at the southern bor-
der and then we see a whole group of 70 
being dropped off without the organiza-
tion required to make sure there is 
seamless entry into our society, that 
tells me that there probably is a capac-
ity problem. 
Again, you cannot imagine a worse 
immigration policy and execution of 
what we have seen in the first 6 months 
of this administration. It is incoher-
ence; it is dysfunction. It appears that 
Washington told ICE: Just send them 
someplace with, again, little or no no-
tice to State and local officials. 
We have to ask: Does the President, 
does the Vice President care about con-
trolling the border? Do they care about 
communities? Do they care about these 
immigrants? It is almost as if they are 
wishing that the issue be swept under 
the rug. 
Unfortunately, the crisis continues 
to worsen. I don’t know if there is a 
plan. I say that because if there is a 
plan, we have not yet seen it executed. 
What we have seen is that record num-
bers of people are now coming into our 
country. It is more as if hands are 
being thrown up in the air. 
I will also say there was a lot of criti-
cism of what President Trump did, but 
it is my observation, whatever the last 
thing the last President did was the 
first thing that worked because it is 
not as if they tried the immediate solu-
tion first off. It is like they worked 
through some things that didn’t work 
and they finally got to where they were 
able to stem the tide. 
So if it is the era of ‘‘let’s do the op-
posite of what President Trump did, 
even if it is the only thing that has 
ever worked,’’ we are in trouble. 
I do think it is time for the Biden ad-
ministration to admit they were wrong 
and to begin going back to that which 
appeared to work. 
I want to thank the people of Shreve-
port. They have been kinder than the 
Federal Government in terms of help-
ing people out—the churches, the NGOs 
that came out to help folks. As one of 
them said, the Scripture teaches us to 
help those who are aliens in our land. 
They have been willing to handle the 
situation 
when 
the 
administration 
failed. But the charity of the American 
people is not a substitute for a coher-
ent policy, and this is an issue for the 
executive branch, specifically Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President Harris, 
who was personally put in charge. 
We need to get it right. We need an-
swers. We need accountability. We need 
sound immigration and border policies, 
and it starts with securing our south-
ern border and enforcing our laws. 
Again, the current situation is unfair 
to everyone—the migrants, the com-
munity, our country. The situation in 
Shreveport, Monroe, and Baton Rouge 
shows the failure of the policies. I don’t 
think they are the only communities 
dealing with this, and we will continue 
to deal with it even more so until we 
have a controlled border. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

July 21, 2021 
NSCAI. This landmark report and its 
important recommendations are the re-
sult of the John S. McCain National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019, which established the NSCAI 
as an independent commission ‘‘to con-
sider the methods and means necessary 
to advance the development of artifi-
cial intelligence, machine learning, 
and associated technologies to com-
prehensively address the national secu-
rity and defense needs of the United 
States.’’ 
In March 2021, the Commission sub-
mitted its final report to Congress and 
the President, in part, warning of the 
dangers of the Chinese Government ob-
taining the personal genetic informa-
tion of U.S. citizens and the impor-
tance of ensuring U.S. leadership in 
biotechnology. As we complete our 
work on the United States Innovation 
and Competition Act that will enable 
us to maintain our technological edge 
over China, it is imperative that we ac-
knowledge the findings of this Commis-
sion regarding the critical importance 
of securing our biodata from China and 
its agents. To that end, allow me to 
cite warnings and recommendations di-
rectly from this Commission. I hope 
our State Department leadership, in-
cluding Secretary Blinken, take these 
into serious consideration and put 
them into action. 
On Page 53, the report finds: ‘‘[China 
understands the tremendous upside as-
sociated with leading the bio revolu-
tion. Massive genomic data sets at 
places like BGI Group (formerly known 
as the Beijing Genomics Institute), 
coupled with China’s now-global ge-
netic data collection platform and ‘‘all- 
of-nation’’ approach to AI, will make 
them a formidable competitor in the 
bio 
realm. 
BGI 
may 
be 
serving, 
wittingly or unwittingly, as a global 
collection mechanism for Chinese gov-
ernment genetic databases, providing 
China with greater raw numbers and 
diversity of human genome samples, as 
well as access to sensitive personal in-
formation 
about 
key 
individuals 
around the world. The United States 
cannot afford to look back in 10 years 
and 
be 
‘‘surprised’’ 
by 
the 
bio-
technology equivalent of Huawei.]’’ 
Later, on Page 586, the report finds: 
‘‘[BGI has also benefited from substan-
tial support from the Chinese govern-
ment, as well as its 2013 acquisition of 
a 
competing 
U.S. 
firm, 
Complete 
Genomics. There are indications that 
BGI’s links with the Chinese govern-
ment may run deeper than it publicly 
claims, as it built and operates China 
National GeneBank, the Chinese gov-
ernment’s national genetic database, 
and has used PLA-owned supercom-
puters to process genetic information. 
Chinese diplomats have pushed BGI- 
built COVID–19 testing kits, including 
in the United States, and by August 
2020 BGI had ‘‘sold 35 million rapid 
COVID–19 testing kits to 180 countries, 
and built 58 labs in 18 countries.’’ The 
highest levels of the United States gov-
ernment should publicly state these 
concerns so as to raise awareness 
among the U.S. commercial and aca-
demic biotechnology communities, as 
well as U.S. allies, many of which cur-
rently have partnerships or business 
dealings with BGI.]’’ 
The Commission then recommends 
on Page 587 that the State Department 
design a specific initiative to warn 
America and its allies about BGI. 
‘‘[Launch a strategic communications 
campaign to publicly highlight the 
links between the Chinese government 
and BGI. The Secretary of State should 
personally voice concern about BGI’s 
ties to the Chinese government and in-
struct the Department to conduct a 
strategic communications campaign to 
highlight those links and warn of the 
dangers of the Chinese government ob-
taining personal genetic information 
via BGI. The Department should also 
warn BGI and the Chinese government 
that it will closely monitor BGI’s ac-
tivities, and that should BGI be uti-
lized as a mass DNA-collection appa-
ratus for the Chinese government, it 
could face additional U.S. regulatory 
action.]’’ 
It is important to note that two sub-
sidiaries of BGI were placed on the en-
tity list by the Commerce Department 
last year for their role in aiding the 
genocide being perpetrated by the Chi-
nese Government against the Uyghur 
minority in Xinjiang, an issue that I 
and many of my Senate colleagues 
have been vocal on. 
In closing, I think it is important 
that this report be part of our RECORD 
today.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE FREDERICK DOUGLASS 
PARK 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize and celebrate the 
centennial of Indianapolis’ Frederick 
Douglass Park. 
In 
the 
early 
20th 
century, 
rec-
reational 
opportunities 
for 
Black 
Americans in Indianapolis were sepa-
rate and unequal. There were no public 
swings or slides for children to play on, 
no designated green spaces for commu-
nities to gather in. When the city’s 
government took notice of the polluted 
and dangerous swimming holes and 
streams in which citizens cooled off, it 
constructed sanitary swimming pools, 
in White neighborhoods only. 
There were, thankfully, Hoosiers who 
recognized these injustices and re-
solved to right them: the physician and 
city council member Sumner Furniss 
and journalist Marcus Stewart, who 
both lobbied for the creation of a park 
to accommodate the city’s growing 
Black population. And the family of 
local entrepreneur Edward Claypool, 
who donated the land on which to build 
it. 
Because of their efforts, in the sum-
mer of 1921, a new park opened on the 
northeast side of Indianapolis where 
African Americans were welcome. It 
was fittingly named for the great 
champion of freedom, Frederick Doug-
lass. 
A year later, a large swimming pool 
filled with clean water opened. There 
were slides, swings, and merry-go- 
rounds too. Next came the adjoining 
Douglass Park Golf Course. Originally 
six tomato cans in a cow pasture, it 
later grew to nine holes and par 34 and 
is one of the only golf courses in the 
Nation named after an African Amer-
ican. Tennis courts, basketball hoops, 
and baseball diamonds were added as 
well. 
When the doors to other communal 
gathering places across Indianapolis 
were closed and locked, Frederick 
Douglass Park didn’t just provide an 
alternative, it created a beloved insti-
tution that brought people together. 
Thousands of Hoosiers spent their 
weekends and holidays here. It was the 
site of civic gatherings, political ral-
lies, family reunions, basketball tour-
naments, little league championships, 
and jazz concerts. Across the park on a 
typical summer night the thump of 
basketballs 
on 
pavement 
competed 
with the echoes of brass instruments. 
It was not uncommon to see the likes 
of champion boxer Joe Louis playing a 
round of golf or future basketball leg-
ends Mel Daniels or George McGinnis 
working on their game. 
One hundred years later, Frederick 
Douglass Park continues to play an im-
portant role in the civic life of our cap-
ital city and bring joy to those who 
call it home. It is exactly the type of 
public place where Americans have al-
ways engaged, interacted, and found 
common ground. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing this milestone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5013 
July 21, 2021 
Supreme Court Justice Roger S. Bur-
dick. Roger has served Idaho’s judicial 
system with distinction and integrity 
for over 47 years. 
Roger graduated from Boise High 
School in 1965 and received his bachelor 
of science in finance from the Univer-
sity of Colorado in 1970. He graduated 
from the University of Idaho School of 
Law with a juris doctor degree in 1974. 
After graduation, he worked at the law 
firm of Webb, Pike, Burton & Carlson 
in Twin Falls, served as a deputy pros-
ecutor in Ada County, and as a partner 
for the law firm of Hart, Burdick & 
Healzer in Jerome. In 1980, Justice Bur-
dick was elected prosecutor for Jerome 
County. 
In 1981, Roger began his career as a 
judge, being appointed to magistrate 
judge for Jerome County. During that 
time, he became the first magistrate 
judge member of the Idaho Judicial 
Council. In 1993, he was appointed as a 
district judge in Twin Falls County. 
In Idaho, the saying, ‘‘Whiskey is for 
drinking and water is for fighting’’ fits 
all too well. Given his extensive legal 
and judicial experience, Judge Burdick 
was assigned one of the most difficult 
and challenging processes in Idaho in 
2001, presiding over water rights deter-
minations through the Snake River 
Basin Adjudication. During this time, 
he also became the administrative dis-
trict judge for the Fifth Judicial Dis-
trict. 
Roger was appointed to the Idaho Su-
preme Court in 2003 by Governor Kemp-
thorne. He won reelection three times, 
serving as vice chief justice of the 
court and two terms as chief justice. 
Before his retirement, he was again 
serving as vice chief justice. In retire-
ment, he will apply to serve as a senior 
judge, taking on periodic cases to help 
ease the workload across the judiciary. 
In addition to being a judge and at-
torney, Justice Burdick has contrib-
uted to the Idaho judicial system by 
serving on various Idaho Supreme 
Court advisory committees, as the dis-
trict judge member on the Idaho Judi-
cial Council, and as president of the 
Idaho District Judges Association. Na-
tionally, he served on the board of di-
rectors for the Conference of Chief Jus-
tices. 
As an avid waterfowl hunter, Roger 
makes time to enjoy this sport with 
family and friends. He also likes to 
spend time with his wife Rachel and his 
two grown sons, Phillip and Benjamin. 
Vicki and I wish you all the best in 
your retirement. Thank you for your 
outstanding service to Idaho and the 
Nation’s judicial and legal system. You 
make Idaho proud.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, and Mrs. SHA-
HEEN): 
S. 2412. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to protect cov-
erage for screening mammography, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Finance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the bipartisan 
‘‘Protecting 
Access 
to 
Lifesaving 
Screenings Act,’’ which would protect 
access to annual mammograms by en-
suring breast cancer screenings are 
covered through insurance for women 
starting at age 40. 
With the exception of skin cancers, 
breast cancer continues to be the most 
common cancer in American women 
and second leading cause of cancer 
death in women behind lung cancer. 
According to the American Cancer So-
ciety, in 2021, about 281,550 new cases of 
invasive breast cancer will be diag-
nosed in women and about 43,600 
women will die from breast cancer. 
Fortunately, we’re seeing the death 
rate for breast cancer go down with a 
decrease of 1 percent per year from 2013 
to 2018. According to the American 
Cancer Society, this has been largely 
credited to earlier diagnosis of breast 
cancer through screening and patient 
awareness, in addition to improve-
ments that have been achieved in 
breast cancer treatments. 
Mammography has been the best test 
we have at finding breast cancer early, 
providing a better chance of survival 
after diagnosis. According to the Kai-
ser Family Foundation, women with 
insurance coverage are more likely to 
report having had a mammogram in 
the past two years compared to unin-
sured women. But while regular breast 
cancer screenings have helped tremen-
dously in the early detection of breast 
cancer, health insurance coverage of 
these screenings for women in their 
forties is at risk. 
While leading medical groups, includ-
ing the American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists, the American 
Cancer Society, and the American Col-
lege of Radiology support women hav-
ing no-cost access to breast cancer 
screenings starting at age 40, the ac-
tual decision of coverage is typically 
determined using recommendations by 
an independent volunteer panel known 
as the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF). 
Unfortunately, when USPSTF up-
dated its breast screening guidelines in 
2015 to recommend that women should 
start mammography screenings at age 
50, health coverage without cost shar-
ing was put in jeopardy for women in 
their 40s. 
The ‘‘Protecting Access to Lifesaving 
Screenings Act’’ was first introduced 
shortly thereafter to postpone these 
recommendations that would have lim-
ited coverage for breast cancer screen-
ing. Congress has subsequently acted 
to extend this moratorium several 
times since then, most recently passing 
an extension in December 2020 that is 
set to expire January 1, 2023. 
The benefits of screenings are clear, 
and we need to ensure that women in 
their forties continue to have coverage 
for, and access to, these screenings. To 
that end, we are reintroducing the 
‘‘Protecting 
Access 
to 
Lifesaving 
Screening Act’’ to further protect ac-
cess to mammography screenings that 
are covered at no cost to patients ages 
40–49. If passed, the current morato-
rium on USPSTF breast cancer screen-
ing 
guidelines 
would 
be 
extended 
through 2028. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the total num-
ber of breast cancer screening tests re-
ceived by women through CDC’s Na-
tional Breast and Cervical Cancer 
Early Detection Program declined by 
87% during April 2020 as compared with 
the previous 5-year averages for that 
month. This decline is attributed to re-
duced routine medical visits due to 
COVID–19. Consequences of these pro-
longed delays in screening include de-
layed 
diagnoses, 
poor 
health 
con-
sequences, and an increase in cancer 
disparities among women already expe-
riencing health inequities. Further re-
moving barriers to screening by ensur-
ing patients are covered at no cost will 
be crucial as the public begins to re-
sume routine preventive health serv-
ices. 
I am honored to be joined by Sen-
ators BLACKBURN and SHAHEEN in intro-
ducing this legislation. I am also very 
grateful for supporters of this bill, in-

tricians and Gynecologists, American

Thank you Mr. President, and I yield

By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. MORAN): 
S. 2425. A bill to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to ensure the provi-
sion of high-quality service through 
the Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, unfortu-
nately, rates of suicide have risen to 
epidemic levels in the United States, 
with suicide now the tenth leading 
cause of death in the country. On aver-
age, there are 129 suicides every day, 
roughly one every eleven minutes, a 
staggering statistic. That is why I am 
pleased to be introducing the Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act 
with Senator MORAN to help turn the 
tide on this increasingly dire situation. 
This legislation would provide $568 
million in new funding over five years 
for the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline, delivering an infusion of new 
funds to help improve call capacity, 
make improvements to the Lifeline, 
and make the switch to a new, easy-to- 
remember, three-digit number, 9–8–8. 
The Lifeline has long been under-
funded, but we have worked on a bipar-
tisan basis to more than double the 
funding over the last three years. How-
ever, much more is needed, and this 
new legislation will help build on these 
efforts to ensure that the Lifeline is 
able to answer the calls of those seek-
ing help. 
In 2019, 47,500 Americans lost their 
lives to suicide. That same year, there 
were 1.4 million suicide attempts. We 
must renew our efforts on suicide pre-
vention. In 2004, working with my col-
league, former Senator Gordon Smith 
of Oregon, we authored the Garrett Lee 
Smith Memorial Act. This law author-
ized new youth suicide prevention pro-
grams in honor of Senator’s Smith son, 
who tragically died by suicide just a 
couple of weeks short of his 22nd birth-
day. For over a decade, these programs 
have funded college campus, state, and 
tribal efforts to prevent suicide among 
our youth and young adult populations, 
who are particularly at risk of suicide. 
During this time, youth suicide rates 
have decreased significantly in my 
home state of Rhode Island. However, 
nationwide, suicide rates have sky-
rocketed. 
That is why we must renew our at-
tention and focus on suicide preven-
tion, including by increasing funding 
for, and improving access to, the Na-
tional 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Lifeline. 
This effort is critical to ensuring that 
when people in crisis call looking for 
help, someone will be there on the

other end of the line to offer hope and 
counseling. Last Congress, I was able 
to work with my former colleague Sen-
ator Gardner, and Senators BALDWIN 
and MORAN on legislation to designate 
the Lifeline as an easy to remember, 
three-digit number, 988. This common- 
sense law will make it easier for people 
across the country to access the Life-
line when they really need it. I am glad 
that the bill was signed into law last 
year, paving the way for every state to 
implement the switch to 9–8–8 by July 
2022. This upcoming deadline, however, 
makes it all the more important that 
we provide more funding for the Life-
line. 
I am pleased to once again have the 
opportunity to partner with Senator 
MORAN on suicide prevention efforts. I 
look forward to working together with 
our colleagues, as well as stakeholders 
supporting these efforts, to pass this 
critical legislation.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
309—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mr. BAR-
RASSO, Mr. MARSHALL, Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH, Mr. RISCH, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, Mr. WICKER, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. HAWLEY, 
Mr. HAGERTY, and Mr. ROUNDS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 309 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
principles of religious freedom by the Found-
ers, many of whom were deeply religious; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States embodies prin-
ciples intended to guarantee freedom of reli-
gion through the free exercise thereof and by 
prohibiting the Government from estab-
lishing a religion; 
Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance was writ-
ten by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister, 
and first published in the September 8, 1892, 
issue of The Youth’s Companion; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress added the words 
‘‘under God’’ to the Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas, for more than 60 years, the 
Pledge of Allegiance has included references 
to the United States flag, to the United 
States having been established as a union 
‘‘under God’’, and to the United States being 
dedicated to securing ‘‘liberty and justice for 
all’’; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress believed it was 
acting constitutionally when it revised the 
Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas the Senate of the 117th Congress 
believes that the Pledge of Allegiance is a 
constitutional expression of patriotism; 
Whereas patriotic songs, engravings on 
United States legal tender, and engravings 
on Federal buildings also contain general 
references to ‘‘God’’; 
Whereas, in Elk Grove Unified School Dis-
trict v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), the Su-
preme Court of the United States overturned 
the decision of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Newdow v. 
U.S. Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2003), a 
case in which the Ninth Circuit concluded 
that recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance 
by a public school teacher violated the Es-
tablishment Clause of the First Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently con-
cluded that— 
(1) the previous opinion of that court in 
Newdow v. U.S. Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th 
Cir. 2003) was no longer binding precedent; 
(2) case law from the Supreme Court of the 
United States concerning the Establishment 
Clause of the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States had subse-
quently changed after the decision in Elk 
Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 
U.S. 1 (2004); and 
(3) Congress, in passing the new version of 
the Pledge of Allegiance, had established a 
secular purpose for the use of the term 
‘‘under God’’; and 
Whereas, in light of those conclusions, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit upheld the recitation of the Pledge of 
Allegiance by public school teachers: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Pledge of Allegiance has been a val-
uable part of life for the people of the United 
States for generations; and 
(2) the Senate strongly defends the con-
stitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.

S. RES. 310 
Whereas on July 11, 2021, thousands of 
Cuban citizens took to the streets to peace-
fully protest and to call for respect for basic 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
and the end of the dictatorship in Cuba; 
Whereas the demonstrations were the larg-
est protests witnessed on the island in 25 
years, with courageous Cuban men, women, 
and youth taking to the streets in at least 50 
different cities and towns across every prov-
ince to affirm a deep aspiration for demo-
cratic change and to denounce the regime’s 
corruption; 
Whereas the nationwide protests represent 
the full diversity of Cuban society, with 
demonstrators proudly proclaiming ‘‘Patria y 
Vida!’’ (Homeland and Life!) and calling for 
‘‘libertad’’ (liberty); 
Whereas the demonstrations in Cuba follow 
months of severe shortages of food and basic 
medicine, frequent power outages, record 
high rates of transmission of COVID–19, and 
the Cuban regime’s ineffective response, in 
addition to the Cuban regime’s continued re-
pression and arbitrary imprisonment of citi-
zens, peaceful activists, and artists; 
Whereas despite the authoritarian regime’s 
blocking of internet service to prevent the 
spread of information about the demonstra-
tions, Cubans witnessed examples of their 
compatriots demanding change in their 
country and courageously joined the growing 
protests; 
Whereas despite the peaceful nature of the 
demonstrations, Miguel Dı´az-Canel incited 
violence among Cubans and encouraged his 
supporters to attack peaceful protestors, de-
claring in a televised address, ‘‘the order to 
fight has been given – into the streets’’ and 
pledged his supporters’ lives: ‘‘Over our dead 
bodies. We are prepared to do anything’’; 
Whereas 
Dı´az-Canel 
has 
sought 
to 
delegitimize 
peaceful 
protesters, 
crudely 
stating they constitute a small group of 
‘‘vulgar criminals’’ that are ‘‘paid’’ to be dis-
ruptive; 
Whereas Dı´az-Canel sought to blame the 
endemic problems causing so much human 
suffering by the Cuban people on outside 
forces instead of on the Cuban regime’s long- 
standing corruption, mismanagement, and 
theft of public resources; 
Whereas the Cuban regime’s domestic se-
curity apparatus, including military and po-
lice, were recorded on video violently re-
pressing peaceful Cuban citizens, including 
by using live ammunition and attacking 
journalists; 
Whereas numerous reports indicate deaths 
of and injuries to Cuban protestors at the 
hands of the regime’s security forces, includ-
ing instances of police firing live ammuni-
tion into crowds and at least one docu-
mented police beating that led to a civilian 
death; 
Whereas independent Cuban civil society 
groups have reported that hundreds of indi-
viduals have been arrested, detained, or are 
missing; 
Whereas defying regime repression, contin-
ued internet shutdowns, and illegal searches 
of the homes of activists and protestors, 
Cuban men, women, and youth continued to 
peacefully protest throughout the island on 
Monday, July 12, using social media to orga-
nize themselves and document acts of regime 
repression; 
Whereas 
international 
human 
rights 
groups, including Human Rights Watch, Am-
nesty International, the United Nations Of-
fice of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, and the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights, have long condemned the 
Cuban regime for violating human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; 
Whereas for years the Cuban regime has 
exported its authoritarian methods to Ven-
ezuela, sending intelligence personnel to as-
sist Venezuelan security forces as they re-
pressed similar peaceful protests calling for 
democratic change; 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses its strong solidarity with the 
people of Cuba in their desire to live in a free 
and democratic country with uncensored ac-
cess to information, justice, and economic 
prosperity; 
(2) condemns the violence ordered by 
Miguel Dı´az-Canel against peaceful pro-
testers as violations of internationally rec-
ognized human rights that does nothing to 
address Cuba’s challenges; 
(3) calls on Cuban forces— 
(A) to respect the Cuban people’s exercise 
of freedom of assembly, freedom of expres-
sion, and other universal human rights; 
(B) to refrain from restricting internet ac-
cess and connectivity in the country; and 
(C) to permit Cuban citizens to freely com-
municate on digital platforms, as is their 
fundamental right; 
(4) calls for the immediate and uncondi-
tional release of all arbitrarily detained 
Cuban citizens and all Cuban political pris-
oners; 
(5) calls on members of the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Armed Forces, the Cuban Ministry of

Whereas Miss Zaila Avant-garde is a 14-

Whereas Miss Avant-garde is the first win-

Whereas the Scripps National Spelling Bee 
is the largest and longest-running edu-
cational promotion in the United States and

pany and local sponsors, most of whom pub-

Whereas the 2021 Scripps National Spelling 
Bee began with competitors from across the 
United States, American Samoa, the Baha-
mas, Canada, Europe, Guam, Jamaica, New 
Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, 
and each competitor had qualified for the 
contest by winning locally sponsored spell-
ing bees; 
Whereas Miss Avant-garde is the first Afri-
can American to win the Scripps National 
Spelling Bee; 
Whereas Miss Avant-garde has spent most 
of her days spelling around 13,000 words per 
day, yet has still found time to become an 
accomplished basketball player and holds 3 
Guinness World Records; 
Whereas Miss Avant-garde survived several 
rounds of fierce competition this year and 
won the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee 
by correctly spelling ‘‘murraya’’; and 
Whereas the achievement of Miss Avant- 
garde brings an immense sense of pride to 
her hometown of Harvey and the entire 
State of Louisiana: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate congratulates 
the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee cham-
pion Zaila Avant-garde.

MEMORATING THE TENTH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SOURIS RIVER 
FLOOD IN MINOT, NORTH DA-
KOTA 
Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 313 
Whereas, in late June 2011, the city of 
Minot, North Dakota, and surrounding com-
munities were inundated by widespread 
flooding; 
Whereas high soil moisture content, above- 
average snow pack, and persistent spring and 
summer precipitation produced record-level 
flooding throughout the Souris River Basin; 
Whereas, in June 2011, the Saskatchewan 
Watershed Authority informed communities 
downstream that ‘‘reservoirs [had] no capac-
ity to store further inflows’’; 
Whereas, on June 22, 2011, following contin-
ued releases from upstream reservoirs, water 
began to overtop levees in the city of Minot, 
resulting in a mandatory evacuation and the 
displacement of 11,000 Minot residents; 
Whereas nearly 11,500 acres in Ward Coun-
ty were covered in 2 to 15 feet of water, im-
pacting nearly 4,800 structures; 
Whereas the river’s flow peaked at 27,000 
cubic feet per second, resulting in almost as 
much water moving through Minot in June 
2011 as in the entire year of 1976, which was 
the previous all-time annual flow record; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2011, the river crested 
at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, a Minot 
record; 
Whereas the floodwater destroyed 4,100 
homes, 250 businesses, and numerous schools, 
parks, churches, and other public infrastruc-
ture at a cost of as much as $1,000,000,000; 
Whereas floodwater created national secu-
rity concerns by temporarily blocking access 
to some intercontinental ballistic missile fa-
cilities operated by personnel at Minot Air 
Force Base; 
Whereas the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency provided more than 1,500 tem-
porary housing units to address the agency’s 
third largest housing mission in its history 
to date; 
Whereas the people of Minot and sur-
rounding communities demonstrated resil-
ience and worked together to help their fel-
low neighbors in a time of need; 
Whereas Federal, State, and local officials 
and agencies coordinated to provide imme-
diate recovery assistance; 
Whereas Congress provided hundreds of 
millions of dollars in disaster relief and re-
covery funding to assist the city of Minot 
and the surrounding region; 
Whereas the people of Minot and sur-
rounding communities continue to deal with 
the effects of the flood, including efforts to 
construct permanent flood protection in the 
Minot area; and 
Whereas 2021 marks the tenth anniversary 
of the Souris River flood in Minot, North Da-
kota: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the tenth anniversary of 
the Souris River flood in Minot, North Da-
kota; 
(2) expresses sympathy to people in the 
Souris River Basin and condolences to the 
families who lost their homes or businesses; 
(3) commends the resilience of the people 
in the Souris River Basin and their commit-
ment to recovery and rebuilding; and 
(4) expresses gratitude and appreciation to 
State and local leaders, first responders, and 
the North Dakota National Guard for pro-
tecting the people of the Souris River Basin.

CONGRATULATING TOM BURRELL 
ON 23 YEARS OF SERVICE TO 
THE 
LAKE 
RIDGE 
OCCOQUAN 
COLES CIVIC ASSOCIATION 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Tom Burrell for his 23 
years of selfless service to the Lake Ridge- 
Occoquan-Coles Civic Association (LOCCA) 
and to congratulate him on his upcoming re-
tirement as Chairman. 
Mr. Burrell has been a member of LOCCA 
since 1993. In 1998, Mr. Burrell volunteered to 
serve as Chairman of LOCCA’s Planning, En-
vironment 
Land-Use 
and 
Transportation 
(PELT) Committee. He brought with him his 
leadership and organizational skills acquired 
from his military service training in the U.S. 
Army and West Point Military Academy. He 
served as chairman from 1998 to 2021, nearly 
23 years. 
As the PELT Committee Chairman for more 
than two decades, Mr. Burrell was directly re-
sponsible for coordinating and scheduling reg-
ular monthly PELT Committee review meet-
ings. Furthermore, he arranged special work 
sessions between citizens, homeowner asso-
ciation representatives, the development com-
munity, and their elected representatives, to 
engage in face-to-face dialogue to review var-
ious potential projects. 
As PELT Committee Chairman, Mr. Burrell 
participated in providing feedback to Planning 
Office staff, the Planning Commission, and the 
Board of County Supervisors at public hear-
ings. Mr. Burrell chaired meetings on a variety 
of topics ranging from educating citizens on 
county land-use, rezoning, special use permit 
applications and comprehensive plan land-use 
requests as well as a facilitating communica-
tion between residents and developers. 
Mr. Burrell also contributed to Prince William 
County 
in 
numerous 
capacities 
beyond 
LOCCA. He served as Vice Chairman on 
Prince William County’s Future’s Commission 
and as Vice Chairman on Prince William 
County’s Land Use Advisory Committee. Mr. 
Burrell has served as a member of his home-
owner association’s (HOA’s) Board of trustees 
for 15 years in Prince William County, serving 
2 years as Treasurer and 8 years as Presi-
dent. 
Because of his tireless and diligent work, 
Mr. Burrell was appointed by the Governor 
Northam to the Virginia Common Interest 
Community Board and has served as a Plan-
ning Commission member for the City of Fair-
fax. 
I congratulate Mr. Burrell and commend him 
for his outstanding service to the betterment of 
our local community. He has contributed 
greatly to make the community he lives in a 
better place for all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing Tom Burrell for his 
service, and in wishing him and his wife 
Bonnie continued health, happiness, and suc-
cess as they embark on a new chapter in life.

SEAMUS RILEY—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Seamus Riley for earning the rank 
of Eagle Scout. Seamus completed his Eagle 
Scout project December of last year. His 
project consisted of pouring ten 3 x 5 concrete 
slabs for entryways through a fenced in area 
that leads to a community recreational area 
where sporting events take place. Seamus co-
ordinated the entire project and solicited the 
funds and material. He learned how to utilize 
his leadership skills in order to apply engineer-
ing and math skills to his project. Seamus will 
be pursuing a college degree in Colorado ma-
joring in engineering. I wish Seamus the best 
of luck in his future endeavors and I know he 
will go on to achieve great things. God Bless 
Seamus and God Bless America.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill to correct a retirement issue for 
several categories of workers who used to be 
under the District of Columbia retirement sys-
tem. 
In 1997, Congress transferred several cat-
egories of workers who participated in D.C.’s 
defined contribution plan from 1987 to 1997 to 
the Federal Employees Retirement System 
(FERS). However, these workers’ service from 
1987 to 1997 was not counted for purposes of 
creditable service or annuity amount in FERS. 
In 2009, Congress gave these employees the 
right to have this service counted for cred-
itable service. 
My bill would correct this last retirement 
issue for these public servants. It would allow 
these workers to buy into the FERS annuity 
amount for 1987 to 1997 by paying 1.3 per-
cent of their base pay plus interest, essentially 
the employee contribution for this time, which 
would give them the full retirement benefit to 
which they are entitled. 
Our bill is an important step to assist these 
workers in getting the retirement benefits they 
deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALBERT

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of my dear friend, 
Albert Earl Brooks, Sr., a highly distinguished 
community leader who passed away on March 
25, 2021. 
Albert Brooks dedicated his life to serving 
others and participating in the struggle for ra-
cial equality, social and economic equity, and 
voting rights. Al was born in Tabor City, North 
Carolina and grew up in Buffalo, New York. 
He joined the United States Army and then re-
ceived his B.A. from the University of New 
York at Buffalo. 
After completing his service in the Army, Al 
served as the Executive Director of the Buffalo 
Affirmative Action Plan. He was then selected 
by Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York 
to work for the Department of Transportation 
in Washington, D.C. While working in the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Transportation, Al

served as a Civil Rights Specialist and Exter-
nal Complaints Coordinator. This experience 
allowed him to transition to the Department of 
Labor where he worked as an Equal Oppor-
tunity Specialist and Civil Rights Officer. Dur-
ing his time at the Department of Labor, he 
became Executive Director for a program 
under the A. Philip Randolph lnstitute’s Edu-
cational Fund. Under his leadership, the pro-
gram pushed for desegregation of labor 
unions and to provide training for African 
American men who were historically denied 
employment in the trades industry. 
His commitment to service extended beyond 
his professional life. Al was deeply involved in 
local politics and community activism. He was 
an active member of the Prince William Coun-
ty NAACP branch, the National Urban League, 
and the Prince William County Democratic 
Committee. 
Al served as Chairman of the Black Demo-
cratic Committee for several terms and was 
coordinator of the PWC Democratic Commit-
tee’s DMV early voting efforts for many years. 
During election season, Al would devote entire 
days to greeting voters at the DMV, passing 
out literature, and placing and removing can-
didate signs from the polling place. 
Voting rights, community engagement, and 
grassroots organization motivated Al in all of 
his endeavors. His efforts of founding the Afri-
can American Democratic Club helped in-
crease the number of African American elect-
ed officials in Prince William County. He was 
instrumental in numerous campaigns and 
helped many of Prince William County’s cur-
rent leaders win their elections. Al worked to 
ensure everyone’s voice was heard at the bal-
lot box and he fully understood the power of 
civic engagement. Because of this work, Al 
has made our community better. 
Madam Speaker, our community has lost a 
giant public servant, community icon, and a 
mentor to so many. A loving husband and fa-
ther, Al spent his life in service to our country 
and to his community. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing the memory 
and life of my dear friend, Albert Earl Brooks, 
Sr.

HONORING JEFF OLSON AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jeff Olson, a community pharmacist at 
Montross Pharmacy, as this week’s Iowan of 
the Week. Since 1995, Jeff has been the 
owner and operator of Montross Pharmacy in 
Winterset, Iowa, which this year is celebrating 
its 100th anniversary. 
If you were to ask Jeff what it means to be 
a community pharmacist, he’d emphasize one 
word: community. Every day, Jeff works to 
make sure nobody goes without the care they 
need—whether that means fielding questions 
at the pharmacy counter, delivering prescrip-
tions at home, or supporting local health as 
president of the Madison County Health Trust. 
Community pharmacies like Montross Phar-
macy are mainstays and integral parts of the 
health care system in our small towns. 
When COVID–19 forced us to adapt to dif-
ferent daily routines, Jeff and his staff at 
Montross Pharmacy redoubled their commit-
ment to serving Winterset. They knew the 
pandemic presented a once-in-a-lifetime chal-
lenge, but they resolved to get through it to-
gether. Together, Montross Pharmacy kept its 
doors open, providing continued access to 
pharmacy services for residents in a safe set-
ting. Jeff and his staff were on call 24/7. And, 
trust me, if there were more than 24 hours in 
a day to give, they’d have been there. 
They also quickly added new services for 
the 
community, 
including 
thousands 
of 
COVID–19 tests and vaccinations. It wasn’t al-
ways easy. When faced with a vaccine short-
age, Jeff took it upon himself to drive six 
hours to secure more doses for his friends 
and neighbors. His hard work did not go unno-
ticed. In fact, one resident—an older woman 
who had been homebound during the pan-
demic—exclaimed to Jeff that the vaccine he 
administered was ‘‘the best gift she could re-
ceive.’’ 
Jeff and his family have made a lasting 
mark on Winterset. Decades ago, Jeff’s grand-
father left his mark by welding on the cupola 
of the Madison County Courthouse. Today, 
Jeff is leaving a different kind of mark. In each 
COVID–19 vaccination he delivers, Jeff sees 
the things that make Winterset his home—a 
summer day enjoyed at the pool, a youth 
sports game, and his kids laughing over lunch 
with friends. 
Jeff’s selflessness is truly infectious, and I 
know that Winterset will see the impact of his 
hard work for years to come. I am sincerely 
grateful for Jeff’s commitment to his family, 
friends, and neighbors, and it is my honor to 
recognize Jeff Olson as Iowan of the Week.

ISLAMIC ACADEMY OF SOUTH 
JERSEY 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to speak about a wonderful non- 
profit, the Islamic Academy of South Jersey. 
The Islamic Academy of South Jersey first 
opened in 2014 and is the first and only full- 
time Islamic school in southern New Jersey. 
Their goal is to mold students into future lead-
ers through the practice of good manners and 
the understanding of leadership. The Academy 
constantly updates their academic curriculum 
and ensures that the students receive quality 
education. The Islamic Academy of South Jer-
sey’s vision is to teach students to be con-
structive, helpful, and beneficial in every as-
pect of their lives so it can be passed along 
to future generations. I wish the Islamic Acad-
emy of South Jersey nothing but success and 
it is my pleasure to be able to recognize them 
for their accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING LOU KENNEDY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Lou Kennedy and her substantial 
contributions to our home state of South Caro-
lina. 
A South Carolina native, Lou attended Lex-
ington High School and graduated from the 
University of South Carolina with a degree in 
Journalism. Lou has held a variety of mar-
keting and operation roles throughout her ca-
reer and currently serves as the President, 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer, 
and 
Owner 
of 
Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a phar-
maceutical manufacturer specializing in Blow- 
Fill-Seal technology. Lou joined Nephron Phar-
maceuticals in 2001 and quickly created a na-
tional sales force. She also headed the effort 
to move the company’s headquarters from Or-
lando to Columbia in 2014, creating over 800 
new jobs in the Palmetto State. 
Under Lou’s leadership, Nephron Pharma-
ceuticals 
has 
experienced 
unprecedented 
growth and now employs nearly 2,000 work-
ers. Lou recently announced the expansion of 
Nephron Pharmaceuticals and the opening of 
Nephron Nitrile, a new plant that will be 
produce American-made, medical-grade nitrile 
gloves and will be headquartered in Lexington 
County. This expansion is a continuation of 
the Nephron team’s efforts to support Gov-
ernor McMaster’s initiative to bring the produc-
tion of life-saving medications and supplies 
back home to the United States. Lifelong 
friend to Lou and CEO of Vikor Scientific, Sam 
Konduros said there is ‘‘not one passive bone 
in Lou’s body . . . she is very action-oriented, 
and very results-driven.’’ Lou’s long list of ac-
complishments proves this to be true. 
As a mother to a wonderful daughter and 
two-step daughters, Lou has instilled in her 
family a strong work ethic and a desire to find 
ways to succeed. Lou believes that hard work 
needs to be modeled, and she sets this exam-
ple for both her family and her employees. 
You’ll often find Lou spending her days in the 
office working alongside everybody in the 
plant to create a cohesive, hard-working team. 
In addition to her strong professional leader-
ship and go-getter attitude, Lou is an engaged 
and philanthropic individual. She serves on a 
variety of business and civic boards, including 
the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, 
the National Association of Manufacturers, and 
the Palmetto Business Forum. An avid Game-
cocks fan, Lou also serves on the USC Ath-
letic Department Board and has generously 
donated to her alma matter. For example, she 
and her husband helped establish the Ken-
nedy Pharmacy Innovation Center in conjunc-
tion with the USC School of Pharmacy. She is 
affectionately known as ‘‘Cockadoodle Lou’’ 
for her financial support and gracious engage-
ment with the institution. 
As a testament to her outstanding service, 
Lou is the recipient of numerous awards and 
honors, including the Outstanding Leadership 
Award from the National Association of Manu-
facturers and the Woman of the Year Award 
from the South Carolina Manufacturers Alli-
ance. She was also named Ambassador of 
the Year by the Greater Columbia Chamber of 
Commerce. Among other honors, Lou also re-
ceived the Order of the Palmetto, South Caro-
lina’s highest civilian honor, from former Gov-
ernor Nikki Haley. 
Lou Kennedy is a remarkable woman whose 
work has truly made a difference for the Mid-
lands region and for the entire state of South 
Carolina. On behalf of the 5th Congressional 
District, I congratulate and thank her for her 
continued service.

LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL 
PHILLIP 
JAMES 
DEVRIES II ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Phil-
lip James DeVries II on his retirement after 28 
years of honorable service to our Nation. I 
stand with the people of West Michigan in rec-
ognizing the tremendous impact Lieutenant 
Colonel DeVries has had on our Nation and 
abroad. 
Lieutenant Colonel DeVries began his serv-
ice at West Point, where he was commis-
sioned as Second lieutenant Field Artillery Of-
ficer. He then went on to become a Strategic 
Plans and Policies Officer in the United States 
Army, where he aided in strategizing and plan-
ning the future of the Army. Chosen for his 
dedication to international affairs, he also had 
the honor of attending the NATO Defense Col-
lege, where he gained the experience to par-
ticipate in multiple international assignments 
involving 22 countries. Lieutenant Colonel 
DeVries was deployed four times throughout 
his career and faithfully served his country 
through strategic operations and on the 
ground. 
Lieutenant Colonel Phillip DeVries truly is an 
American hero, and his service will have a 
lasting effect both nationally and internation-
ally. 
Madam Speaker, it is because of dedicated, 
honorable individuals such as Lieutenant Colo-
nel Phillip James DeVries II that I am incred-
ibly proud to serve Michigan’s 2nd Congres-
sional District. I join with those in West Michi-
gan and around the globe in thanking Lieuten-
ant Colonel DeVries for his many years of 
service and wish him a happy retirement.

KYLE FRANCIS LEAHY—EAGLE 
SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Kyle Francis Leahy who has been a 
scout since he was six years old, and recently 
achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. Kyle dem-
onstrated his leadership skills when he de-
signed and created an outdoor classroom for 
the Friends School in Mullica Hill, South Jer-
sey. Because of the pandemic, Kyle had mini-
mal assistance while he cleared an 800 foot 
wooded trail ending in an amphitheater sized 
classroom. This will allow future generations of 
students to learn in a natural outdoor environ-
ment. Kyle is currently a senior at Tower Hill 
School in Delaware and plans on attending 
the University of South Carolina in their Cap-
stone Leadership Program. Kyle wants to 
study economics and political science and has 
the hope to attend law school once he grad-
uates from college. I am proud of Kyle and his 
dedication to his community, and I look for-
ward to seeing what he accomplishes in the 
future. God Bless Kyle and God Bless Amer-
ica.

MARJORIE HASS LEAVING RHODES 
COLLEGE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to wish the best good fortune to a trans-
formational educator, Dr. Marjorie Hass, who 
is leaving as President of Rhodes College in 
Memphis to become President of the Council 
of Independent Colleges, a Washington-based 
association of independent colleges and uni-
versities. There she will be a leading voice in 
national discussions of issues in higher edu-
cation. In her four years at Rhodes, Dr. Hass 
has inspired the students, faculty and staff to 
maintain the stellar reputation it has gained 
over 173 years as one of the nation’s top lib-
eral arts institutions. Trained as a philosopher 
and guided by her Jewish faith, Dr. Hass has 
been a thoughtful decision maker as a college 
president, maintaining high standards in lead-
ership development and academics. In the last 
four years, Rhodes has been named one of 
the nation’s most innovative liberal arts col-
leges by U.S. News & World Report, a ‘‘best 
value’’ college by The Princeton Review, and 
Tennessee’s best liberal arts college by Niche, 
the lifestyle and culture magazine. Dr. Hass 
taught philosophy for over a decade at Muh-
lenberg College in Pennsylvania, where she 
also directed the Center for Ethics, and holds 
bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in 
philosophy from the University of Illinois— 
Champaign-Urbana. Before coming to Muhlen-
berg College, Dr. Hass served as president of 
Austin College in Sherman, Texas, where she 
worked to ensure talented students could suc-
ceed regardless of their financial background. 
Dr. Hass is married to Dr. Lawrence Hass, a 
former philosophy professor and sleight-of- 
hand magician, and she has two grown chil-
dren, Cameron and Jessica. After her con-
tributions to Rhodes and to our city, I look for-
ward to seeing Dr. Hass testifying before the 
education committees on Capitol Hill in her 
new leadership position and wish her the best 
in this new chapter of her life.

HONORING MR. MOHAMMAD 
HOSSEIN MEHRMAND 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Mohammad Hossein 
Mehrmand, a constituent of mine and a former 
Lieutenant-General of the Imperial Iranian Air 
Force. Prior to 1979, Iran, was a very different 
country than it is today. Iran and the United 
States were close friends and cooperated in 
both trade and military affairs. 
Because of this close cooperation between 
our two nations, Iranian military officers like 
Mr. Mehrmand had the opportunity to visit 
U.S. military installations and work closely with 
American servicemembers to train on U.S.- 
built fighter jets that were operated by the Im-
perial Iranian Air Force. 
While the Imperial Iranian Air Force oper-
ated a number of U.S. fighter jets, they were 
the sole foreign operator of one aircraft, in 
particular, the F–14 Tomcat. As a result of this 
program, Khatami Air Base was constructed 
by the Iranian government near the city of 
Isfahan in the early 1970s to cater to their new 
fleet of F–14s with support facilities built spe-
cifically for the Grumman Corporation. In fact, 
the entire region around Isfahan was booming 
for the American defense industry with other 
defense contractors like Raytheon, Lockheed, 
Boeing and Hughes Aircraft working on lucra-
tive projects for the Shah’s government. 
As a result of the massive presence of 
American enterprise in the region, Isfahan was 
home to at least 1,200 American military 
members and 8,000 civilian advisers at its 
peak in the mid-to-late 1970s. This presence 
could be felt quite evidently by the massive 
amount of new construction marketed towards 
the Americans working in the region. 
All of this changed in 1979 as revolutionary 
fundamentalists began to take over Iran. At 
the time, there were over 5,000 Americans liv-
ing in Iran with many residing around Khatami 
Air Base. As the situation in the country began 
to deteriorate, the U.S. Embassy in Iran ad-
vised all Americans to leave the country. 
At the time, Lt. General Mehrmand was the 
tactical commander of the Imperial Iranian Air 
Force and he had received information that 
many within the Iranian military had begun to 
go rogue and side with the fundamentalist rev-
olutionaries, with many of these rogue units 
attempting to prevent Americans from leaving 
Iran. 
Lt. General Mehrmand took action on behalf 
of our citizens and met with the rogue units to 
successfully negotiate the American exodus 
from Iran. He additionally made arrangements 
to allow for twenty-five special American pas-
senger planes to enter Iranian airspace to 
begin evacuating all Americans from Iran. As 
a direct result of his efforts, nearly 5,000 
Americans were safely and successfully evac-
uated out of the collapsing country. 
Within weeks of the evacuation flights, the 
Imperial Iranian government collapsed, and 
the fanatical government of Ayatollah Kho-
meini took over Iran. Under the new govern-
ment, Lt. General Melmnand was branded a 
traitor for securing the exodus of the American 
people and had his property, assets, and re-
tirement pension confiscated. Fortunately, Mr. 
Mehrmand was able to escape persecution in 
Iran and found refuge here in the United 
States. 
Mr. Mehrmand, despite not being an Amer-
ican citizen, had the boldness and courage to 
stand up against fanaticism in the name of 
freedom for the American people. Today, Mr. 
Mehrmand is 92 years old, and a proud Amer-
ican citizen living happily in California. I am 
delighted to have this opportunity to recognize 
his patriotic actions and I want to express my 
profound gratitude to him for his service to our 
country and to our national interests.

and Vermeer Midwest for celebrating the 50th 
anniversary as an outstanding company in the 
central Illinois area. 
Vermeer Midwest first opened its doors in 
1971. Founder Junior Kool, raised with hard-
working American values, successfully ex-
panded his business across four states with 
ten distinct locations. Providing excellent serv-
ice and ample charitable donations of money, 
time, and people, Junior’s legacy will have a 
lasting impact on the area. 
Vermeer Midwest is known throughout Cen-
tral Illinois not only for their quality under-
ground and environmental equipment but also 
for the lasting relationships they develop with 
their customers. Junior and his wife Beverly 
are fondly recognized for their pure commit-
ment to customer service and seeing their 
consumers through to success. Never are they 
hesitant to complete the job or get their boots 
dirty, and as their motto says, ‘‘It’s simply how 
business is done.’’ 
The Greater Peoria area has benefited from 
Vermeer Midwest’s goodwill and generosity 
since they first opened. I extend my sincere 
congratulations to Vermeer Midwest, Junior 
Kool, and all of the hard-working staff for a 
successful fifty years. I wish their family and 
company a successful future.

program. In 2016, the Fairfax County Fire and 
Rescue Department in partnership with Fairfax 
County Public Schools created its High School 
Firefighter Program to provide training to stu-
dents who are considering a career as a fire-
fighter. 
Students who participate in this program at-
tend courses taught by qualified instructors at 
the Fairfax County Fire Academy. In fact, they 
receive the same training as new professional 
and volunteer firefighters. The course is gruel-
ing but upon successful completion, the stu-
dents are eligible to receive six college credits. 
Should these students decide to apply to the 
Fairfax County Fire Academy, this program 
will make them competitive candidates and will 
have prepared them for recruit school. 
Fourteen seniors are graduating in the 
Class of 2021 of the High School Firefighter 
Program. It is my honor to include in the 
RECORD the names of the following graduates: 
Seth Ballard, William Beavers, Nicholas 
Carpio, Peyton Czikra, Moeed Ghazi, Matthew 
Hargrave, Mai Mohamed, Sarah Moummi, Mi-
chael Muldoon, Spencer Neyland, Robert 
Rupp, Joshua Scurlock, Isaac Spar, Jalen 
Wray. 
Madam Speaker, the Fairfax County Fire 
and Rescue Department is one of the best fire 
departments in the country and in the world. I 
commend the Department as well as the pub-
lic school system for partnering in the creation 
of this program. I also applaud these young 
people for their desire to learn more about the 
Department and for their interest in protecting 
our community. Northern Virginia is fortunate 
to have such dedicated young citizens. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
these students on the successful completion 
of this program and in wishing them success 
in their future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO SILVIA URIBE—CALI-
FORNIA’S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL 
WOMEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Silvia Uribe of Goleta, Cali-
fornia. 
Silvia is a language access advocate, who 
has devoted her business and community 
service providing language services and help-
ing people connect. Born and raised in Mexico 
City, Silvia and her family moved to Santa 
Barbara 28 years ago where she immediately 
began serving the community. Her business, 
TransilPro provides translation and interpreta-
tion services to businesses, government, com-
munity organizations, and beyond. She has a 
knack for creating programs that overcome 
language barriers, including writing Spanish 
curricula for the Adoption Center of Santa Bar-
bara. Silvia’s work in the community goes be-
yond her everyday activities. 
Her passion for communication extends to 
media, as a radio host, writer, Univision con-
tributor, and speaker. Whether she is invited 
as a guest lecturer at Santa Barbara Commu-
nity College, speaking to a church group, or in 
her former Univision segment, En confianza 
con Silvia, her objective is always to be of 
service by sharing information and bringing 
services and people together. Silvia gives her 
time and talents to a wide array of organiza-
tions. She started Latino Girl Scout troops in 
North and South Santa Barbara County and 
created Fun in the Sun in collaboration with 
the United Way. She expanded into the busi-
ness world as a co-founder of Lı´deres Latinos 
in Leadership Santa Barbara County. 
A longtime advocate for victims of crime in 
the Santa Barbara District attorney’s office, 
Silvia also created STESA’s Spanish cur-
riculum on sexual assault and delivers volun-
teer training to Spanish speaking volunteers 
with STESA and Just Communities. 
Silvia is also an active public servant. In ad-
dition to working for the DA’s Victim Witness, 
Silvia has served as a County Human Serv-
ices Commissioner and a Public Engagement 
Commissioner with the City of Goleta. The 
common thread across all these activities is 
Silvia’s commitment to connecting members of 
our community—to each other and to services. 
She is a worthy candidate for this honor and 
a role model for community leaders of all 
kinds. I am honored to recognize Silvia for her 
continued commitment to community and the 
residents of Santa Barbara County. 
I ask all Members to join me today in hon-
oring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Silvia Uribe, for 
her incredible service to her community.

HONORING MR. COLEMAN WALK-
ER’S INDUCTION TO THE TEN-
NESSEE RADIO HALL OF FAME 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Coleman Walker for his induction 
into the Tennessee Radio Hall of Fame. 
Mr. Walker, a well-known figure of long- 
standing in the Tennessee Broadcast commu-
nity, began his radio career in 1961 at the age 
of 21 as a broadcaster for WCOR–AM in Leb-
anon, TN. Since that time sixty years ago, ro-
bust audiences of Middle Tennesseans have 
tuned-in to listen whenever this talented man 
sits behind the microphone. 
During the course of those ensuing sixty 
years, Mr. Walker also became a licensed in-
surance agent, and he currently plies his trade 
for Walker and Phillips Insurance in Lebanon. 
But he never lost his love and enthusiasm for 
radio broadcasting, which manifests itself 
today when he hosts the daily morning radio 
show ‘‘Coleman and Company’’ on WANT–FM 
and WCOR–AM, focusing on community af-
fairs in Lebanon. 
Through his interviews of various elected of-
ficials, business leaders, community activists, 
and community volunteers on his show, this 
Middle Tennessee broadcast legend continues 
to keep his countless listeners informed on the 
important issues of the day. As a frequent 
guest on Mr. Walker’s show, I can attest to his 
fervent passion for his Lebanon, TN home-
town, where he and his wife Helen raised their 
three sons Clark, Brian, and Mike, and now 
enjoy their several grandchildren. 
His involvement with Lebanon and insight 
into the issues of the day throughout his ca-
reer are unmatched and serves as a shining

example of the positive difference a sincere, 
community-minded individual can make. I am 
very pleased that he is receiving this much de-
served recognition of his achievements. 
Madam Speaker, I hope you will join me in 
commending Mr. Coleman Walker, the dean of 
local radio in Middle Tennessee, for his many 
years of broadcasting excellence and his in-
duction into the Tennessee Hall of Fame.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
GRADUATION 
OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE 
AND 
RESCUE 
DEPARTMENT 
148TH RECRUIT CLASS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department and the graduates of the 
148th Recruit Class. As they prepare to join 
the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department, I encourage the 42 grad-
uates to reflect on the history of the depart-
ment and the contributions and dedication of 
the brave men and women who have served 
before them to protect our community. 
The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-
partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-
tensive and demanding 30-week program. In 
addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits 
completed twelve weeks of EMT training and 
sixteen weeks of fire suppression training. 
Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-
tified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Vir-
ginia Department of Fire Programs. 
These recruits have the distinct honor of 
joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-
partments in the United States. The efforts of 
the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment have been recognized across this coun-
try. Members from the Department serve on 
the elite VA Task Force I, which is among the 
first units called to disaster zones to provide 
search and rescue support. Members of that 
Task Force were recognized by the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs with the 
Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result 
of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-
astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 
2015. 
Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-
cellent ambassadors for our community and I 
commend them for all that they have done to 
protect lives and property not only here in 
Fairfax County, but around the world. As the 
newest members of the Fire and Rescue De-
partment, the 148th Recruit Class graduates 
join the department as integral parts of our 
community’s emergency response and public 
safety team. I am confident that this grad-
uating class will serve the residents of Fairfax 
County with honor and distinction. It is my 
great honor to include in the RECORD the 
names of the 148th Recruit Class: 
Paul Ayers, Juan Bailey, Jacob Biller, Jo-
seph Boccabello, Andrew Brinton, Timothy 
Cahill, Jason Cook, Zion David, Joshua David-
son, Andrew Duke, Matthew McKay, Ariel 
Molina Heredia, Gary Moore Jr, Ricardo 
Munoz Caceres, Charles Nelson III, Chris-
topher Ong-Hay, Kelly Paszkiewicz, Tyler Pen-
nington, Elijah Quiceno, Brandon Rafferty. 
Keith Fosco, Rachel Guszick, Jonas Holz, 
Timothy Hussey, Caroline Jarvis, Michael 
Kloosterboer, Cameron Kotwicki, Adam Ladd, 
Joseph Leis, Maria-Clarice Lingat, Tyler Mar-
tin, James Reed III, Darious Rush, Matthew 
Sisinni, Mark Taggart-Perez, David Tezza, 
Armin Saadi, Jason Vargas, Benjamin Welty, 
Taylor White, Matthew Wilson, Ian Wood. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the newest members 
of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment. I thank them for their service to their 
community and to all members of the Fire and 
Rescue Department, past and present, I say: 
‘‘Stay safe.’’

RECOGNIZING PAM HOWELL- 
BEACH 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the accomplishments of Pam 
Howell-Beach in my District. Pam has been a 
longtime leader of our community, leading ef-
forts and leaving her imprimatur on Northwest 
Ohio community organizations, and has come 
to retirement as the CEO of the Stranahan 
Foundation in Toledo, Ohio. 
Pam Howell-Beach grew up in the North-
west Ohio rural community of Archbold, Ohio. 
Upon her high school graduation, the family 
was required to relocate due to her father’s 
work. However, Pam chose to stay and sup-
ported herself, enrolling in evening and week-
end classes at the University of Toledo and 
working full time to cover the cost of tuition 
and expenses. The first in her family to obtain 
a higher degree, Pam achieved a Bachelor’s 
Degree in Social Work and Psychology. She 
later went on to Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity where she obtained her Master’s De-
gree in Social Work Administration, special-
izing in non-profit planning and management. 
Pam achieved this advanced degree earning a 
4.0 while leading the Toledo Community Foun-
dation as its director. 
Under the leadership of Pam Howell-Beach, 
she grew the assets of the Toledo Community 
Foundation from $20 million to nearly $100 
million. As a result, the Toledo Community 
Foundation’s reach extended into every facet 
of Toledo life including social services, the arts 
and education. 
After sixteen years at the helm of the To-
ledo Community Foundation, Pam was asked 
to become the first full-time executive director 
of the Stranahan Foundation. Thus, she 
oversaw the organization’s services while 
bringing forth many new initiatives. Among 
these efforts was an early childhood education 
enterprise that brought national recognition to 
the Stranahan Foundation. In the seventeen 
years of Pam Howell-Beach’s tenure at the 
Stranahan Foundation, more than $70.5 mil-
lion in funding has been disbursed to nonprofit 
organizations in our region and nationwide. 
Pam Howell-Beach’s strengths in the non- 
profit world and community at large brought 
her recognition as well. She was inducted into 
the inaugural class of 20 Under 40 in 1996 
and was named a YWCA Milestone Honoree 
in 2010. 
Accolades are well-deserved, but Pam has 
devoted her energies toward mentorship in the 
philanthropic world. She has particularly fo-
cused on raising up women. Pam has dedi-
cated countless volunteer hours toward these 
efforts, as well as serving as past president of 
the Zonta Club of Toledo, past chair of Philan-
thropy Ohio, former chair of the Ability Center 
of Greater Toledo, trustee for Mercy Health 
Partners, advisor for the Early Childhood 
Funders Collaborative, and grant reviewer for 
Susan G. Komen Foundation. 
In spite of Pam’s accomplishments in the 
philanthropic world, the role she most treas-
ures is the one in her family. Her biographer 
notes that she is a ‘‘devoted wife to her hus-
band, Bob. Together they have travelled the 
world, trekked thousands of miles on their 
bikes, and spent cherished time with a wide 
community of friends and associates. Pam has 
also served as a source of support and 
strength for her step-children and her neph-
ews. Beyond any doubt, Pam has led an ex-
emplary life, both personally and profes-
sionally.’’ 
Singer/songwriter 
Dolly 
Parton 
noted, ‘‘If your actions create a legacy that in-
spires others to dream more, learn more, do 
more and become more, then, you are an ex-
cellent leader.’’ Truly, Pam Howell-Beach has 
embodied this message throughout her jour-
ney. We wish her Godspeed.

FREEDOM AND LIBERTY FOR 
CUBA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, historic protests against the brutal 
communist Cuban regime are taking place 
across Cuba. I commend the courage of the 
Cuban people as they stand together to de-
mand basic human freedoms. Socialist op-
pression in Cuba has gone on long enough 
and the people of Cuba are standing for free-
dom and liberty. 
Cuba’s socialist dictatorship has tortured the 
people of Cuba for decades, forcing the entire 
country into shambles and economic turmoil. 
Now, as the people of Cuba peacefully protest 
this oppressive regime, Cuban regime thugs 
are taking protesters from their homes for 
nothing more than calling for freedom. These 
horrifying events are not uncommon, and it is 
time the Cuban regime be held responsible for 
their offences against Cuban families. 
It was inspiring to see American flags being 
flown during Sunday’s protests. Cubans have 
historically stood up against totalitarian com-
munism, and the United States stands with 
them.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Riley Quirk who achieved the rank 
of Eagle Scout. Riley’s Eagle Scout project 
was the replacement of a 140′ long timber 
bridge path through a swampy area located on 
Camp Edge. Riley was in charge of coordi-

farmer who manages a flock of 100 sheep, 
300 laying hens, broiler chickens, and a small 
market garden. Riley has aspirations to attend 
college and go on to expand his agriculture 
enterprises on his family farm. It is amazing to 
see our young people in South Jersey serving 
their community and I know Riley will achieve 
great things. God Bless Riley and God Bless

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARVIN 
WAGNER 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of my dear friend Marvin 
Wagner, a pivotal Northern Virginia leader 
who passed away on May 23, 2020, at the 
age of 90. 
Marvin Wagner grew up in the Williamsburg 
public housing projects in Brooklyn, New York. 
From a young age Marvin had to support his 
mother and sister by working to put food on 
the table for his family all while going to 
school. In 1946, Marvin enlisted in the Army 
and was able to utilize the GI Bill to then at-
tend Long Island University. After earning his 
four-year degree from LIU, he attended Brook-
lyn Law School and successfully passed the 
bar exam. Shortly after, he met and married 
the love of his life, Harriet, who became his 
partner and best friend for the next 66 years. 
Throughout his career, Marvin dedicated 
himself to service and strived to make the 
world a better and safer place. Marvin quickly 
became involved in Democratic politics and 
worked in local government on highway safety 
issues on Long Island. To learn new best 
practices for highway safety, Marvin traveled 
to Scandinavia to study their use of breath 
and blood alcohol tests to identify drunk driv-
ers and introduced the concept locally in the 
town of Oyster Bay and Nassau County, New 
York. Later, he would go on to introduce his 
ideas as a member of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Board within the Department of 
Transportation. Nationally, he helped formulate 
strategies that were instrumental in reducing 
drunk driving deaths such as: data-based test-
ing, implied consent laws, and the legalization 
of roadblocks. Marvin also helped create na-
tional standards by continuing to educate law-
makers and judges all over the country. 
In addition to his groundbreaking work in the 
public health and safety area, Marvin focused 
his attention on helping juvenile offenders as 
an attorney in Fairfax, Virginia. Marvin’s com-
mitment and service to youth offenders led 
two governors to appoint him to the Juvenile 
Justice Commission in Richmond, where he 
served for eight years. His personal experi-
ence with poverty and adversity at a young 
age allowed him to skillfully advocate for the 
children and young adults that came through 
the juvenile justice system. 
Public service was at the core of who 
Marvin was. In addition to his contributions in 
public safety and the juvenile justice system, 
Marvin served as a leader of party committees 
throughout his adult life, the last eight years 
as the chair of the Democratic Club at 
Greenspring retirement community in Spring-
field, Virginia. He was passionate about music, 
theater, and dance, and he channeled that by 
serving as a volunteer usher with his wife, 
Harriet, at Wolf Trap in Vienna for 30 years. 
Marvin also had an adventurous spirit—he 
loved to travel and made sure to take annual 
trips with his wife and family. But above all 
Marvin was a dedicated and loving husband, 
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Marvin 
Wagner. His leadership and commitment to 
public service helped save lives all over the 
country, and he will be missed by all who 
knew him. I also extend my deepest condo-
lences to his wife, Harriet; his loving children, 
Carole, Robert, Janet, and Steven; daughters- 
in-law, Laura and Jenny; son-in-law, Bill; and 
numerous grandchildren and great grand-
children. May his memory be a blessing.
