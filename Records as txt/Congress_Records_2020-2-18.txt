INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA COURTS AND PUB-
LIC 
DEFENDER 
SERVICE 
VOL-
UNTARY 
SEPARATION 
INCEN-
TIVE PAYMENTS ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 18, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts and 
Public Defender Service Voluntary Separation 
Incentive Payments Act. This bill, which 
passed the House in the 114th Congress, 
would make a small but important change to 
the authorities of the District of Columbia 
Courts (D.C. Courts) and the Public Defender 
Service for the District of Columbia (PDS), giv-
ing them the same authority federal agencies 
and federal courts already have to offer vol-
untary separation incentive payments, or 
buyouts, to their employees. 
We were able to get buyout authority for the 
D.C. Courts and PDS in fiscal year 2020 in 
the recently enacted spending bill. However, 
my bill is necessary to make this authorization 
permanent. Buyouts would allow the D.C. 
Courts and PDS to respond to future adminis-
trative and budgetary needs, and would pro-
vide the flexibility to extend buyout offers to 
their employees. 
The U.S. Government Accountability Office 
has determined that voluntary separation in-
centive payments may be made only where 
statutorily authorized. Federal agencies and 
federal courts already have the statutory au-
thority to offer buyouts, and there is no reason 
why the D.C. Courts and PDS should not have 
the same express authority in order to man-
age their workforce as budget conditions and 
needs change. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 18, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was absent from a vote which oc-
curred on February 13th. I was with the Vice 
President of the United States, meeting with 
constituents, in my congressional district and 
unable to make the vote. Had I been present, 
I would have voted Nay on Roll Call No. 70 
(H.J. Res. 79). 
GROVELAND FOUR MONUMENT 
DEDICATION 
HON. ROSS SPANO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 18, 2020 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
memory of four young African American men 
who in 1949 in Lake County, FL, were harshly 
and unjustly mistreated by our judicial sys-
tem—Charles Greenlee, Walter Irving, Samuel 
Shepherd, and Ernest Thomas. 
The Groveland Four case, as it become 
known, centered around the alleged sexual 
assault of a 17-year-old white girl and an at-
tack on her husband. Given the cruel reality of 
the social and racial divide of 1949 Florida, it 
would have been impossible for these young 
men to receive a fair and unbiased trial, de-
spite being represented by Thurgood Marshall. 
The incident lit a chain of events in our 
community that will forever be remembered as 
some of the most painful and scarring mo-
ments in our history. Almost 70 years later, 
the City of Groveland and Lake County apolo-
gized to their survivors and in 2019, Gov. Ron 
DeSantis officially pardoned the men—actions 
I commend. 
It is never too late for justice, and never too 
late to do what is right. We have grown since 
those times in Lake County, but we’re not 
done. I pray that the Groveland Four Monu-
ment brings some healing to their surviving 
family members, and that it is a constant re-
minder to us to always pursue truth and jus-
tice for all of our citizens.

CLIFF NOLAN 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 18, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and recognize Barnegat, New 
Jersey resident Cliff Nolan, and to remember 
his life and legacy. 
On Friday February 14, 2020, family and 
friends will gather to celebrate the life of Cliff 
Nolan at Thos L. Shinn Funeral Home, 
Manahawkin, New Jersey and reflect on his 
many achievements and compassion. 
Born in Kearny, New Jersey, in 1957, Cliff 
Nolan attended and graduated from Kearny 
High School before enlisting and proudly serv-
ing in the United States Army. Following his 
return stateside, Cliff pursued a career with 
the International Brotherhood of the Team-
sters. During his time with the union, Mr. 
Nolan served in several capacities with Team-
sters, including as a Drive Representative 
based out of the Washington, D.C. head-
quarters. 
After years of traveling the country for the 
International Brotherhood of the Teamsters, 
Mr. Nolan went on to work for the union’s 
Joint Council, Local 73 in New Jersey. Cliff 
then began to facilitate the union’s local polit-
ical organization efforts assisting campaigns in 
preparation for elections, while also lobbying 
elected leaders to support issues beneficial to 
his members. 
In his free time Mr. Nolan was actively in-
volved in the community, generously donating 
his time to volunteering with charities, includ-
ing the Heroes to Hearts Program which pro-
vides spiritual healing and peer support to mili-
tary personal and veterans with Post Trau-
matic Stress Disorder. Additionally, Mr. Nolan 
also volunteered with the Australian Challenge 
Program and was instrumental in setting up 
events for children with cancer to enjoy a ‘‘Trip 
of a Lifetime’’ during their time in the United 
States of America. 
Mr. Nolan’s family, including his loyal parrot 
bird Gus who never left his side, friends and 
union brothers were very important to him. 
Cliff is remembered by those close to him as 
being laid-back, always happy and always 
looking to make those around him happy. 
Whenever his friends or family called on him 
to help, he was there without any thought or 
hesitation. He is survived by his wife Nancy, 
his mother Dolores, his sister Tracey and his 
adored nephew Joseph, his stepchildren Rick 
Roeder and Kasi Shepard and his four step 
grandchildren 
Blake 
Roeder, 
Preston 
Shephard, Hayden Shephard, and Bryna 
Shephard and his many cousins. Cliff Nolan 
was a great American and his service to our 
country will not be forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Cliff Nolan, of Barnegat, New Jersey, 
an honorable friend, veteran, a dedicated 
union leader who fought tirelessly for the Inter-
national Brotherhood of Teamsters and dedi-
cated his life to serving his country, commu-
nity and all union workers.
