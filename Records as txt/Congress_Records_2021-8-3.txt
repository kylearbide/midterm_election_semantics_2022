PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, we come looking for 
You, longing for Your deliverance, 
straining to hear Your promises. We 
approach You in prayer, waiting, per-
haps even desperate, to hear a word 
from You. 
How long must we endure before we 
receive Your comfort? 
How long must we wait before we are 
assured of Your help? 
Speak Your word of hope. 
There are many who would fill the si-
lence with their own words of pride and 
arrogance, lies and falsehoods. 
When will You show judgment on 
their unfaithfulness? 
Speak Your word of truth. 
Those who persecute, jeer, and abuse 
without cause have consumed our en-
ergy and sapped us of strength. Speak 
Your word of comfort. 
May we refuse to yield to the pres-
sure to turn away from Your decrees. 
May we obey Your statutes and not for-
sake our trust in You. Speak Your 
word of guidance. 
In Your mercy, revive us. Speak Your 
life-giving word. 
O God, speak into this day and in all 
that it presents us, for we hope to hear 
Your word of love. 
For it is in Your word that we find 
our strength and in Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL
WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
God our shield, look with love upon 
us today. Enable us to go from strength 
to strength as we strive to live in day- 
tight compartments. Guide our Sen-
ators around the obstacles that hinder 
them from living for Your glory. As 
they seek to fulfill Your purposes for 
their lives, empower them to stand for 
right and leave the consequences to 
You. 
Lord, give them the grace to seek 
You with their whole hearts, knowing 
that those who passionately pursue 
You will find You. May they daily sur-
render themselves to You through 
prayer and obedience as they remember 
that victory comes from You. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior legislative clerk read the 
following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, August 3, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL WARNOCK, a 
Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Sen-
ators continue to work through the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill here on the 
floor. Members from both sides want to 
be able to consider as many germane 
amendments as possible, but we want 
to work efficiently to allow those 
votes. 
Yesterday was a positive day in that 
respect. Democrats and Republicans 
agreed to vote on three amendments, 
two of which were led by Republicans. 
Two bipartisan amendments—one led 
by Senators THUNE and TILLIS, another 
led by Senators PADILLA and MORAN— 
were adopted with over 90 votes. 
We have one—potentially two—more 
amendment votes lined up this morn-
ing. We can hold even more amend-
ment votes today if our Republican col-
leagues grant us the consent to do so. 
The bottom line is this: The Senate 
can work through amendments rather 
efficiently when we have cooperation 
between the majority and the minor-
ity, as we have had in this bipartisan 
legislation. It can go rather slowly, of 
course, without that cooperation. In ei-
ther case, the Senate is going to stay 
here until we finish our work. 
I will conclude my remarks now in 
order to give time to the other Mem-
bers waiting to speak, but I will come 
back to the floor shortly afterwards to 
join the chair and ranking member of 
the Rules Committee asking the Sen-
ate to award the Congressional Gold 
Medal to members of the Capitol Police 
force who defended us from a violent 
mob on January 6. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved.

grams, and transit programs, and for other

JANUARY 6 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, while 
we are awaiting others to come to the 
Senate floor, let me express my deep 
sorrow about learning of the deaths of 
two more police officers who responded 
to safeguard all of us in the Capitol on 
January 6. 
My heart goes out to their families 
and their fellow officers, both here on 
Capitol Hill and also in the District of 
Columbia police force. 
I am wearing a button that was given 
to me several years ago after the Cap-
itol Police, once again, acted hero-
ically. It says: ‘‘Thank you, Capitol Po-
lice.’’ 
I hope each and every one of us will 
take time today to thank these coura-
geous men and women who are working 
so hard to keep us safe and many of 
whom still bear the physical injuries 
and the emotional trauma of that dark 
day in our Nation’s history. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, I would like now to 
turn 
to 
briefly 
speak 
about 
the 
broadband provisions that are included 
in the infrastructure package. My 
friend and colleague Senator JEANNE 
SHAHEEN, from New Hampshire, and I 
worked with a number of our col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
craft this package. 
The pandemic that we have endured 
for more than a year laid bear the dis-
parities in access to high-speed inter-
net. It made it difficult for children to 
be educated online, impossible for some 
individuals to work at home, and re-
moved the possibility of telemedicine 
consultations for some of our sick and 
seniors. 
The fact is that approximately 19 
million Americans still lack access to 
high-speed internet. We talk a lot in 
this bill about bridges and building 
bridges, and we do need to do that. 
Well, it is time for us to bridge Amer-
ica’s digital divide and build a 21st-cen-
tury broadband infrastructure that will 
meet our country’s needs not only 
today but for years to come, to be fu-
ture-proof, if you will. 
The bipartisan infrastructure plan 
invests $65 billion to address our Na-
tion’s digital divide once and for all, 
and I would note that that is in addi-
tion to the previous funding that we 
provided in the COVID bills to help 
bridge the digital divide. 
Also, in the March $1.9 trillion bill, 
there is language that was authored by 
Senator MANCHIN that allows States to 
use some of the allocation that they re-
ceive to invest in broadband. In addi-
tion, I am hopeful that we will consider 
and adopt an amendment that Senator 
CORNYN has authored that will give 
more flexibility to States to invest in 
broadband, using some of the alloca-
tion that they received. 
Our bill, the bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act, would 
provide more than $42 billion in grants 
to States for deployment. It does not 
favor particular technologies or pro-
viders, and projects would have to meet 
a 
minimum 
download-upload 
build 
standard of 100 over 20 megabits per 
second. 
The funding includes a 10-percent set- 
aside for high-cost areas, and each 
State, territory, and the District of Co-
lumbia would receive an initial min-
imum allocation, a portion of which 
could be used for technical assistance 
and supporting or establishing a State 
broadband office. In my State of Maine, 
the Governor has used some of those 
COVID funds in order to establish a 
new Maine Connect Authority that will 
be very helpful. 
States would be required to prioritize 
deployment in unserved areas first. 
That is so important. Then they could 
move to underserved areas. 
I talked to a selectman recently from 
Swans Island off the coast of Maine. 
They 
desperately 
need 
access 
to 
broadband services, and they do not 
have it. I am thinking of what a dif-
ference it would make to the lives of 
the people who live on that island. I 
have also talked to people in Northern 
Maine, for example, in the town of Eas-
ton, ME, where one family told me that 
it would cost $15,000 for them to be con-
nected to the internet. They don’t have 
that kind of money. Few people in 
Maine do. 
That is why there is another part of 
our bill that speaks to affordability, 
and in this provision, we plussed up to 
$14.2 billion. Additional funds would be 
devoted to subsidize broadband service 
for 
eligible 
households 
that 
meet 
needs-based criteria. An example would 
be eligibility for school lunches. This 
allocation of funds is so important to 
rural America as well as unserved 
areas in our inner cities. 
The bill that we have before us in-
cludes $2 billion to support programs 
administered by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, including the ReCon-
nect Program that provides loans and 
grants or a combination to fund the 
construction, acquisition, and improve-
ment of facilities and equipment that 
provides broadband service in rural 
areas. 
Supplementing that are private ac-
tivity funds, where $600 million has 
been allocated. This is based on a bill 
that was introduced by Senator HAS-
SAN and Senator CAPITO, another bipar-
tisan bill that is called the Rural 
Broadband Financing Flexibility Act. 
It would allow States to issue private 
activity bonds to finance broadband de-
ployment, specifically, for projects in 
rural areas where a majority of the 
households do not have access to 
broadband. 
We also included an additional $2 bil-
lion 
for 
the 
Tribal 
Broadband 
Connectivity Program, which was es-
tablished by the COVID bill that we 
passed in December and is adminis-
tered by the NTIA in the Department 
of Commerce. 
Grants from this program will be 
made eligible—will be made available 
to eligible Native American, Alaska 
Native, and Native Hawaiian entities 
for broadband deployment as well as 
for digital inclusion, workforce devel-
opment, telehealth, and distance learn-
ing. 
Our bill also includes $2.75 billion for 
the Digital Equity Act, which was in-
troduced 
by 
Senators 
MURRAY, 
PORTMAN, and KING. 
It establishes two NTIA-administered 
grant programs that would help com-
munities that have not yet secured the 
skills, technologies, and support need-
ed to take advantage of broadband con-
nection. 
In that regard, I would note an arti-
cle that appeared this morning in Roll 
Call that is entitled ‘‘Industry groups, 
equity advocates applaud infrastruc-
ture bill’s broadband provisions.’’ I am 
proud of that. We worked very hard to 
make sure that there was widespread 
support for this legislation, particu-
larly the broadband provisions. 
We also included additional funding, 
$1 billion, for the so-called middle mile. 
This would create a State grant pro-
gram for the construction, improve-
ment, and acquisition of middle mile 
infrastructure. 
And I would note that eligible enti-
ties include telecommunications com-
panies, technology companies, electric 
utilities, utility cooperatives, a wide 
range of businesses and organizations 
that could help us with that middle 
mile. 
And that refers to the installation of 
a dedicated line that transmits a signal 
to and from the internet point of pres-
ence. 
Competition of middle mile routes is 
necessary—completion of those middle 
mile routes is necessary to serve areas 
and reduce capital expenditures and 
lower operating costs. 
So originally we had $500 million for 
this; the final package has $1 billion, at 
the request of certain Members from 
the Presiding Officer’s side of the aisle. 
So my point is that the broadband 
provisions in this bill are going to 
make such a difference. We are in an 
era where, I think most of us would 
agree, that access to high-speed inter-
net is another way that we connect, 
just as roads and bridges are ways that 
we connect. We connect to family 
members; we connect to friends; we 
connect to our colleagues at work; we 
connect to healthcare providers; we 
connect to educators; and it is abso-
lutely essential that we make this in-
vestment, and it is a generous invest-
ment, so that we can eliminate the dis-
parities that were laid bare by the pan-
demic and bring high-speed internet to 
every section of our country. 
The technologies may differ, the pro-
viders will certainly not be the same,

but this investment will make a real 
difference to so many Americans who 
today still lack access to high-speed 
internet. 
I see the Republican leader has ar-
rived on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
has been a little more than 6 months 
since the Biden administration and our 
Democratic-led Congress were sworn 
in. So let’s zoom out from the daily po-
litical drama and ask the simplest pos-
sible question: How is it going? How is 
the leadership working out for middle- 
class families? Or put more directly: 
What big aspects of our national life 
could Democrats even claim are headed 
in the right direction on their watch? 
In January, our Democratic friends 
inherited the most favorable trend 
lines that any incoming administration 
could possibly ask for. Three safe and 
effective vaccines had been discovered, 
developed, and were already spreading 
across our country. Our economy was 
packed with dry powder and ready for a 
historic comeback. It was already 
morning in America when this Demo-
cratic government showed up. Mostly 
what they had to do was not get in the 
way. 
So where are we 6 months in? The 
U.S. economy has broken some recent 
records, mostly the wrong ones. Infla-
tion just clocked its steepest 12-month 
increase in more than a decade. The 
month before, a separate measure of 
core inflation rose at its fastest rate 
since 1992—higher gas prices, higher 
grocery prices, soaring costs for every-
thing from household purchases, to 
automobiles, to housing itself. 
Inflation is painful enough, but it 
isn’t the only problem. Employment 
growth has not been fast enough. Last 
quarter, GDP grew much more slowly 
than anticipated. Six months and tril-
lions of dollars of government spending 
into the Democrats’ efforts at a recov-
ery, and Gallup says America’s eco-
nomic confidence is still only neutral. 
We are not—we are not—where we need 
to be. 
What about the rule of law? There is 
still a historic surge in people trying to 
come across our southern border, but 
administration officials have spent far 
more energy denying responsibility for 
the problem than trying to fix it. Catch 
and release is still the name of the 
game. 
According to news reports, out of 
tens of thousands of illegal immigrants 
who have simply been released into the 
interior of our country without a court 
date—now listen to this—just 13 per-
cent—13 percent have shown up at 
their mandatory meeting with ICE 
afterward. 
So the border is functionally open— 
especially absurd at a time when many 
leaders are asking American citizens to 
step up various COVID precautions. 
Not much testing, social distancing, or 
mask wearing is happening in the Rio 
Grande Valley. 
Meanwhile, a surge in violent crime, 
including recordbreaking murders in 
many places, has too many citizens 
afraid of their own city streets. 
Perhaps 
our 
Democratic 
friends 
think foreign policy is going well. I 
sure wish it were. The President’s 
rushed pullback from Afghanistan has 
left our friends and partners in the 
lurch and rolled out a red carpet for a 
Taliban takeover that is already under-
way. Its approach to Iran appears to be 
promising big concessions to our adver-
sary for no reason even as their ter-
rorist proxies continue to attack U.S., 
Israeli, and Arab interests all across 
the region. 
While I appreciate the administra-
tion’s tough talk on Russia and China, 
those words ring hollow when they fail 
to impose real consequences on cyber 
attacks and propose to cut our defense 
spending after inflation. 
So what about COVID–19 itself? Cer-
tainly, the pandemic is not the fault of 
any administration or any political 
party, but this administration boasted 
with great confidence they had a play-
book that was guaranteed to crush the 
virus. They have continued to roll out 
the vaccines the prior administration 
developed, and for that, they certainly 
deserve some credit. But, especially re-
cently, Americans have received far 
too many mixed messages and muddied 
communications about masks, vac-
cines, and what risks remain and for 
whom. 
Meanwhile, the Democrats’ allies in 
the teachers unions continue to specu-
late publicly that perhaps schools may 
not remain open this fall after all. 
They are flirting with another lost 
year for our kids even when there are 
safe and effective vaccines that can re-
duce adults’ risk of grave illness to al-
most nil and when we know that, mer-
cifully, this virus has mostly spared 
children from serious illness the whole 
time. 
So, look, everyone is rooting for 
America; everyone is rooting for the 
recovery that middle-class families de-
serve; but that is not what the Demo-
crats’ decisions and policies are deliv-
ering. No wonder America’s optimism 
has been in free fall the last few 
months. One survey found that a ma-
jority—55 
percent—are 
pessimistic 
about where the country is headed in 
the coming year. That pessimism has 
increased almost 20 percentage points 
since just this spring. 
The soul of America has not been re-
stored. It is anxious, it is uneasy, and 
in too many cases, the more the Demo-
crats’ policies have taken effect, the 
more problems American families have 
faced. 
Now, certainly, the 6-month mark 
still provides plenty of time for my 
Democratic colleagues to recalibrate. 
We have already notched some bipar-
tisan wins here in the Senate. Our col-
leagues could put away the partisan 
approach 
that 
has 
already 
super-
charged inflation, slowed rehiring, and 
is setting back our national security. 
But, alas, our Democratic colleagues 
are signaling they are still addicted to 
going it alone. 
My friends on the other side are sig-
naling that a few days from now, just a 
few days from now, they will begin the 
process of ramming through a reckless, 
multitrillion-dollar 
taxing-and-spend-
ing spree that will stick middle-class 
families with higher costs, more infla-
tion, fewer jobs, and lower wages. 
It is not the strategy that will turn 
around Democrats’ lackluster report 
card; it will do just the opposite. It al-
most seems designed to make every 
problem that families are facing con-
siderably worse. It would meet signifi-
cant inflation with another massive av-
alanche of printing and borrowing. It 
would hammer a tenuous economic re-
covery with historic tax hikes and job- 
killing Green New Deal regulations. It 
would, for some reason, respond to a 
live border crisis with a big amnesty to 
lure even more people here illegally. 
No working American in Kentucky or 
anywhere else would look at a plan like 
this and get on board, and neither will 
a single Republican. If Washington 
Democrats really want to take the re-
markable head start they inherited at 
the dawn of this recovery year and 
squander it through bad policy, they 
will need to do it all alone. 
Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll.

U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Well, Mr. President, 
as you know, as we all know, January 
6 unleashed many horrors, but it also 
revealed many heroes. A day that 
many of us remember for its violence, 
anger, and destruction was not without 
its share of bravery, sacrifice, and self-
lessness. 
I am, of course, talking about the 
Capitol Police and the Metropolitan 
Police. In a few moments, my col-
leagues 
Senators 
KLOBUCHAR
and 
BLUNT will ask the Senate to award 
them the Congressional Gold Medal. It 
is the highest expression of gratitude 
that Congress can bestow. I cannot 
imagine more worthy recipients than 
the men and women who put their lives 
on the line to defend this temple of de-
mocracy. 
I want to thank Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
the chair of the Rules Committee, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5686 
August 3, 2021 
Senator BLUNT, the ranking member of 
the Rules Committee, for working so 
hard on this. And I want to commend 
the House and Speaker PELOSI and the 
House Members who voted for it as 
well. 
Now I must mention that I am still 
stunned by what happened in the 
House, where 21 Members of the House 
Republican caucus voted against this 
legislation. The Senate is different. I 
expect this to pass unanimously. That 
is why we are here doing it today. But 
those folks in the House were some of 
the same folks who likened the Janu-
ary 6 attack to ‘‘a normal tourist 
visit,’’ who deny the events that day 
were an insurrection. The same folks 
who screamed the loudest about the 
dangers of defunding the police refused 
to defend the police—the very police 
that shielded them—from the vicious 
mob on January 6. 
For the life of me, I don’t know how 
they sleep at night. 
That is one of the many reasons this 
gold medal is so important. The gold 
medal is about setting the record 
straight and recognizing the true her-
oism on display that fateful day. 
My colleagues, we have a moral obli-
gation to never forget what our first 
responders faced down. A mob of White 
supremacists and domestic terrorists 
stormed the barriers with vicious force, 
using flag poles as spears and fences as 
battering rams. Capitol Police officers 
were swarmed, beaten, crushed between 
the doorways, and tasered repeatedly. 
One hundred forty officers were as-
saulted that day. Fifteen required hos-
pitalization. Seven people have lost 
their lives in connection with this at-
tack. 
Just this week, sadly—I read this 
story and I ached—two more police of-
ficers took their own lives, heaping 
tragedy upon tragedy. These past 6 
months have been the hardest in the 
history of the Capitol Police Force. 
And yet they still keep watch. They 
still stand guard. They do their jobs 
every single day with professionalism, 
excellence, and grace. 
Awarding the Congressional Gold 
Medal is a way to commemorate their 
sacrifice and make sure that the truth 
of January 6 is recognized and remem-
bered forever. 
To our Capitol and Metropolitan Po-
lice, thank you, thank you, thank you 
for all that you do. This recognition is 
the very least you deserve. 
Once again, I want to give real praise 
to my colleague from Minnesota as I 
yield to her. She has done an amazing 
job as head of the Rules Committee in 
many different ways and this is one of 
many. And I want to thank Senator 
BLUNT who always works in a spirit of 
bipartisanship. We are in quite a bipar-
tisan week here, and that is a good 
thing. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator SCHUMER for his leader-
ship. 
With that said, we in the Senate were 
able to come unanimously behind this 
important, 
important 
resolution, 
which I will describe in a minute. 
I also thank Senator MCCONNELL, and 
I certainly thank my friend Senator 
BLUNT for his leadership. 
We must pass this legislation hon-
oring the Capitol Police and other he-
roes who protected the Capitol on Jan-
uary 6 by awarding them this Congres-
sional Gold Medal. 
Senator BLUNT joined me from the 
beginning in sponsoring the Senate 
version of this legislation and worked 
with me on the Rules Committee. And 
I thank the Presiding Officer, Senator 
PADILLA, for his great service on that 
committee to continue the work of get-
ting to the bottom of the security, 
planning, and response failures that we 
saw on January 6. 
While that work goes on, it is impor-
tant that we recognize the bravery and 
patriotism of those who defended our 
democracy 
and 
our 
lives 
with 
Congress’s highest honor. 
The insurrection at the Capitol was 
more than an assault on democracy. 
Oh, it was that in a big, big way, but it 
was also an actual life-or-death situa-
tion for the many brave law enforce-
ment officers who show up here to do 
their work every day. 
We will never forget the haunting 
shrieks of the police officer pinned in 
between the doors at the hands of riot-
ers, pleading for help. We will never 
forget Officer Harry Dunn, who told his 
story again last week at the House se-
lect committee, recounting how he 
fought against the violent mob for 
hours and after it was all over, broke 
down in tears, telling fellow officers in 
the Rotunda that he had been called 
the N-word multiple times that day. 
And he looked at his friend, his fellow 
officer, and said: ‘‘Is this America?’’ 
These medals today, these Congres-
sional Gold Medals that will be dis-
played for millions to see—one at the 
Smithsonian, one in this Capitol, one 
at the Metropolitan Police, and one 
with the Capitol Police—they answer 
that question. 
No, Officer Dunn, that was not Amer-
ica, but these medals that recognize 
your bravery, this is America. 
Then our own Officer Eugene Good-
man, who after saving Senator ROMNEY 
from walking directly into the mob of 
insurrectionists, ran by himself to take 
on a group of rioters and then diverted 
that mob away. We have all seen it on 
the video. We know what he was doing: 
allowing the rest of us to safely depart. 
Tragically, the attack on the Capitol 
also cost the lives of four brave offi-
cers, including Capitol Police Officer 
Brian Sicknick, who died the day fol-
lowing the attack. And I had the honor 
to meet his family. 
Four other officers died following the 
events of January 6: DC Metropolitan 
Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, his col-
leagues Gunther Hashida and Kyle 
DeFreytag, whose passings were re-
ported just yesterday, and, of course, 
Capitol 
Police 
Officer 
Howard 
Liebengood. 
We are also so inspired by the work 
of their loved ones who have come to 
Capitol Hill to fight for a 9/11-style 
Commission to look at the insurrection 
and why it happened, to get to the bot-
tom of it and to advocate for the Cap-
itol Police to support their officers. 
It has been reported that at least 140 
more officers sustained injuries from 
defending the Capitol. The courage of 
these officers will be remembered for-
ever. 
We responded. Senator BLUNT and I 
joined with Senator PORTMAN
and 
Peters on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee to interview officials from mul-
tiple agencies and review thousands of 
documents. We convened major public 
hearings and then interviewed many, 
many other witnesses. 
Our resulting bipartisan joint report 
focused on the security, planning, and 
response failures related to the violent 
and unprecedented insurrection at the 
Capitol, and it includes key findings 
and recommendations that must be put 
in place without delay. I am pleased 
that we have introduced our bipartisan 
bill, which will make sure that the new 
Police Chief will be able to call in help 
from the National Guard without call-
ing a bunch of other people in the mid-
dle of a crisis. 
We have just passed, on a bipartisan 
basis, thanks to Senators LEAHY and 
SHELBY, major security funding that 
will help to give the police the re-
sources they need and fund the im-
provements needed to this Capitol. 
We also have put in place two new 
Sergeants at Arms, one in the Senate 
and one in the House, as well as a new 
Police Chief, Chief Manger, whom I 
just met with for a lengthy period of 
time yesterday to go over all of our 
recommendations. By the end of the 
year, I will appear in this Chamber 
with a checklist to make sure that 
they are either done being imple-
mented or in the process of being im-
plemented to be done soon. 
Another key priority that we called 
for in our report was advanced last 
week when the President signed into 
law, as I said, all of the funding that 
we need. And what that includes that I 
didn’t mention, $4.4 million for mental 
health support for Capitol Police offi-
cers and the many officers who are still 
dealing, as we can see, with trauma to 
this day. 
Passing this bill, which, of course, al-
ready passed the House—and, yes, I 
agree with Senator SCHUMER about how 
it is impossible to understand why 
some people voted against it, but it 
still passed with bipartisan support—is 
another step forward to honor the her-
oism and sacrifice of our law enforce-
ment. 
Those medals, when little kids walk 
by and see them at the Smithsonian, 
their parents are going to be able to 
tell them this happened. This attack 
happened, and there were brave police 
officers and staff and others in this

building that stood up that day and 
protected our democracy, and we will 
be forever thankful to them. 
We are hearing a lot about gold med-
als, and some of them by our own USA 
team that we are so proud of the last 
week at the Olympics. 
This is our Olympics. This is our gold 
medal. And it goes to them, to the Cap-
itol Police officers and the Metropoli-
tan Police officers and others that pro-
tected us that day. 
Thanks, Senator BLUNT, who is here 
with us as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am 
proud to join my friend and my col-
league Senator KLOBUCHAR as we intro-
duce and support this amendment. 
You know, every day when I come to 
work at the Capitol, the first person I 
see is almost always a U.S. Capitol Po-
lice officer, and no matter how late I 
leave at night, the last person I see is 
almost always a U.S. Capitol Police of-
ficer. 
I was working in this building on 9/11, 
and one of the last people to leave that 
morning as the Capitol Police encour-
aging us to get out of the building, but 
the last person I saw as I left the build-
ing who was still in the building was a 
Capitol Police officer. 
The Capitol Police have a hard job to 
do. They not only defend us, but they 
defend democracy in a way that other 
police officers are not asked to do, and 
they always do it at the highest level 
of professionalism and dedication. That 
was never more evident than it was on 
January 6. It was a difficult and sad 
day for Americans but especially for 
law enforcement officers who serve and 
protect the Capitol and for their fami-
lies. 
I have often said that, very possibly, 
the hardest job to do in America today 
is to be the family member of someone 
who works in law enforcement. Maybe 
the second hardest job is to be the per-
son working in law enforcement. But 
those families on that day were watch-
ing television, listening to the news, 
seeing their very worst fears play out 
for all the world to see on a day that 
was horrific for them, horrific for the 
person they love, and horrific for those 
who love this building and what it 
stands for. 
I am incredibly grateful for the he-
roic actions we saw that day from the 
Capitol Police, from the Metropolitan 
Police, who, along with Chief Conte, 
who was the Acting Chief at the time, 
were here within 10 or 12 minutes of 
being called and here in force in that 
period of time. 
Others came from around the region, 
and all those law enforcement people 
who were here to help that day, we are 
deeply appreciative of. 
The legislation we have here really 
calls on us to recognize the selfless-
ness, the dedication, the willingness to 
stand in the way of danger as others 
are able to try to get away from dan-
ger. It honors the sacrifices they make 
and their families make every day. 
I hope, by passing this Congressional 
Gold Medal bill by unanimous consent, 
we send a clear message to law enforce-
ment officers that we are united in our 
appreciation of all they do to keep us 
safe. 
I urge my colleagues to join not only 
in supporting the unanimous passage of 
this bill but also to be quick in talking 
about our deep appreciation for those 
who serve in such a special way as we 
try to do our work here every day. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration and the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
H.R. 3325. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3325) to award four congres-
sional gold medals to the United States Cap-
itol Police and those who protected the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 3325) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleagues, every 
single one of them, including Senator 
BLUNT and Senator COLLINS, who is 
here with us today, for supporting this 
legislation and honoring the heroism 
and patriotism of the courageous law 
enforcement officers who risk and in 
some cases sacrifice their lives to de-
fend our democracy. I also want to 
thank Senator BLUNT for his work on 
the Senate version of this legislation, 
as well as Senator SCHUMER and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, and I thank Senator 
BLUNT for joining me today. 
Now it is headed to the President’s 
desk. No more motions, and this is 
done. I look forward to seeing this bill 
signed into law. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
associate myself with the remarks of 
my colleagues who have just been here 
acknowledging the heroic work done by 
the Capitol Police on January 6. Clear-
ly, they are very deserving of all the 
recognition that they have received. 
What they went through on that very 
harrowing day I think is a reminder to 
all of us of the importance of the work 
they do day in and day out and just the 
challenge they face defending this Cap-
itol and people who work in it. I, like 
my colleagues, am enormously grateful 
and just want to join in recognizing 
that with the award they just received. 
I also point out that we are in the 
midst of a debate here on a bill that 
was negotiated in a bipartisan way. It 
is great to see Republicans and Demo-
crats working together, talking to-
gether, coming up with 
solutions, 
whether we agree with them or not. 
But the fact that there are people sit-
ting down across the table from each 
other and working through some of 
these big issues that we face here, one 
of which, obviously, in this country is 
maintaining a strong infrastructure, is 
encouraging, and in many ways, it is 
refreshing to see that happening here. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. President, it is sort of ironic, 
too, that in the light of that spirit of 
bipartisanship, that we continue to see 
nominees brought to the floor who 
don’t reflect that spirit. 
The Senate voted last week to bring 
Tracy Stone-Manning’s nomination to 
the Senate floor. It is difficult to know 
exactly what President Biden was 
thinking when he decided to nominate 
Ms. Stone-Manning for Director of the 
Bureau of Land Management. Perhaps 
the administration’s vetting wasn’t 
thorough enough. Otherwise, it is pret-
ty difficult to understand why the 
President would nominate an indi-
vidual with ties to an ecoterrorist or-
ganization—an ecoterrorist organiza-
tion—to head the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
That is not all. She was actually in-
volved in a tree-spiking plot during her 
time in graduate school, sending a 
threatening letter to the U.S. Forest 
Service at the request of one of the in-
dividuals involved in spiking trees in 
an Idaho forest. 
Tree spiking, as many know, involves 
hammering spikes into the trunks of 
trees to cripple chain saws or the 
equipment at the sawmill where the 
trees are processed. It poses a signifi-
cant threat to logging and mill equip-
ment, but most seriously, it poses a 
threat to human life. 
In a famous incident, a worker at a 
lumber mill in California was engaged 
in splitting logs when his saw hit a 
spiked log and the saw exploded. I will 
let a Washington Post story covering 
the incident speak for itself, and I 
quote from the Washington Post, as 
follows: 
He was nearly three feet away when the log 
hit his saw and the saw exploded. One half of 
the blade stuck in the log. The other half hit 
Alexander in the head, tearing through his 
safety helmet and face shield. His face was 
slashed from eye to chin. His teeth were 
smashed and his jaw was cut in half. 
Alexander had never even heard of a sabo-
tage tactic called tree spiking until he be-
came a victim of ‘‘eco-terrorism.’’ Someone 
who objected to tree cutting had imbedded a

huge steel spike in the log that violently 
jammed the saw. 
Then the Washington Post continued, 
and I quote again: 
Tree spikes are among the most vicious of 
the strategies. While the tree is still in the 
forest, the spike is driven in at an angle so 
the head is hidden in the bark. It can shatter 
a chain saw on impact, sending pieces of 
razor-sharp steel flying. 
It is very hard for me to believe that 
we 
are 
seriously 
considering 
con-
firming an individual to head the Bu-
reau of Land Management who was in 
any way involved with tree spiking. 
Furthermore, Ms. Stone-Manning ap-
parently initially refused to cooperate 
with the subsequent investigation into 
the tree-spiking incident, only coming 
clean after it became clear that she 
could face criminal charges for her role 
in the incident. Equally troubling is 
the less-than-forthright response that 
she provided to the Senate on her 
nominee questionnaire about whether 
or not she had ever been investigated 
by a law enforcement organization. 
Ms. Stone-Manning’s involvement in 
the tree-spiking incident is not the 
only reason to be concerned that she 
has extremist views. As a graduate stu-
dent, she also argued for population 
control, in one instance referring to a 
child as an ‘‘environmental hazard.’’ 
Last year, she took advantage of Twit-
ter to promote an article her husband 
wrote in which he expressed satisfac-
tion at the idea of seeing homes people 
have built in forests burn in fires. 
President Obama’s first Bureau of 
Land Management Director withdrew 
his support for Ms. Stone-Manning’s 
nomination over her involvement in 
the tree-spiking plot. A Deputy Direc-
tor at the BLM under President Obama 
also expressed his concern over the 
nomination, noting: 
Much of the focus seems to be whether this 
is a Democrat or Republican thing, but the 
lens I look at this through is as a 38-year ca-
reer person in both agencies. . . . [Y]ou need 
the career employees to implement your 
agenda successfully across the West. Your 
leader has got to be respected by career em-
ployees and across the landscape, in both 
blue and red states. 
His point is well-taken. How are BLM 
employees and the many Americans 
who regularly interact with the Bureau 
of Land Management going to feel 
about working with Ms. Stone-Man-
ning? Our public lands are used for a 
variety of purposes, including recre-
ation, livestock grazing, and timber 
harvesting. What kind of attitude 
should we expect from Ms. Stone-Man-
ning to display toward timber har-
vesting? Is this really the best Presi-
dent Biden can do when it comes to the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement? 
As 75 House Republicans said in a let-
ter to President Biden urging him to 
withdraw the nomination, ‘‘There is no 
doubt that someone with this history 
of extreme, violent views should not be 
in a position of authority at an agency 
responsible for managing 245 million 
acres of federal lands and 700 million 
acres of mineral estate.’’ 
I wish I could say that Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s nomination is an aberra-
tion, but, in fact, President Biden has 
nominated a number of candidates with 
extremist views for various offices. 
Last week, we voted on his nominee 
to head U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services, a nominee who failed to 
receive even a single bipartisan vote in 
committee, due in part to her refusal 
to say she won’t completely bypass 
Congress when fashioning policies to 
deal with those who are in the United 
States unlawfully. 
Then there is the President’s nomi-
nee for head of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, 
Firearms 
and 
Explosives, 
David Chipman, whose main interest 
seems to be targeting law-abiding gun 
owners and who has communicated a 
clear disdain for gun owners in public 
remarks. This nominee was also appar-
ently the subject of a complaint for 
making racist remarks while working 
at ATF. 
Then there are the multiple Presi-
dent Biden nominees now serving in 
the Department of Justice who have 
publicly expressed their support for 
defunding the police. That is right— 
President Biden filled key posts at the 
Justice Department, the Department 
charged with enforcing the law and 
prosecuting criminals, with individuals 
who have gone on the record with their 
support for defunding the police. 
I suppose it is no real surprise that 
President Biden nominated an indi-
vidual to the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment who once referred to a child as an 
‘‘environmental hazard’’ when you con-
sider who he nominated to head up the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra’s rab-
idly pro-abortion views put him far to 
the left of the majority of Americans. 
Polls consistently show that a strong 
majority of Americans believe that 
there should be at least some restric-
tions on abortion. President Biden’s 
HHS Secretary doesn’t seem to support 
any restriction on abortion, and if he 
does, I would sure like to hear about 
them. During his time in the House of 
Representatives, Secretary Becerra re-
peatedly voted against banning partial- 
birth abortion, an abortion procedure 
so heinous that I think most Ameri-
cans would rightfully shrink from see-
ing it performed on an animal, let 
alone a human being. 
As I said, given that, I suppose it is 
not hard to believe that President 
Biden nominated an individual to the 
Bureau of Land Management who once 
described a child as an ‘‘environmental 
hazard.’’ 
President Biden tends to present 
himself as a moderate and someone 
who will bring people together. He said 
in his inaugural address: ‘‘I pledge this 
to you: I will be a President for all 
Americans.’’ In practice, however, too 
often he has seemed to be a President 
for the far-left wing of the Democratic 
Party. 
I hope that my Democratic col-
leagues will think twice before con-
firming Ms. Stone-Manning as head of 
the Bureau of Land Management. In-
volvement with ecoterrorism should be 
a disqualifying factor for heading up 
this Agency. 
I yield the floor.

AMENDMENT NO. 2181 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, this 
amendment is the first step to deter-
mine how we invest in our infrastruc-
ture moving forward. 
Since 2008, we have repeatedly bailed 
out the highway trust fund. That 
makes it a trust fund that we cannot 
actually trust. 
A highway cost allocation study pro-
vides the data that we need in order to 
make long-term, sustainable, and fis-
cally sound decisions about how best to 
invest in our Nation’s aging infrastruc-
ture. These studies used to occur regu-
larly, but the last one was completed 
over 20 years ago. 
My amendment would direct the De-
partment of Transportation to carry 
out a study in 4 years, giving those of 
us here in Congress a full year to ana-
lyze the results before the highway 
programs expire once again. We can’t 
continue to burden future generations 
with out-of-control spending, and this 
amendment is a signal to future Con-
gresses that we must find lasting solu-
tions for infrastructure investment. 
I want to thank Senator KELLY and 
Senator CORNYN for their support in 
this effort, and I urge the rest of my 
colleagues to support this amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, as we 
work to pass this bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act to up-
grade and modernize our country’s in-
frastructure, I am glad to be here join-
ing Senator LUMMIS to introduce this 
amendment to include our Highway 
Cost Allocation Act. 
As a former engineer and astronaut, 
my career has taught me about the im-
portance of having the data to tackle a 
complex issue. 
This bipartisan amendment would re-
quire the Secretary of Transportation 
to conduct the first comprehensive 
study of vehicle highway usage in near-
ly 25 years. This information would in-
form decisions to address the Highway 
Trust Fund’s revenue shortfalls during 
its next reauthorization cycle. 
That 
is 
important 
for 
growing 
States, like Arizona and other Western 
States, and for our entire country, so I 
urge my colleagues to support our bi-
partisan amendment. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senator CAP-
ITO and I be allowed to speak briefly 
just before the amendment. 
Senator CAPITO.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5689 
August 3, 2021 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to 
support this amendment. 
This amendment, as we know, would 
require the Department of Transpor-
tation to conduct a highway cost allo-
cation study—the first one since 1997. 
Vehicles are different than they were 
in 1997, and roadway use has increased 
significantly. This study will help us to 
analyze the direct cost of highway use 
by different types of users, and then 
compare that to user fee revenue con-
tributions to the Highway Trust Fund. 
This is about gathering roadway use 
information to inform decisions to ad-
dress the Highway Trust Fund short-
falls. I encourage my colleagues to 
vote yes on the Lummis-Kelly-Cornyn 
amendment. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to join my voice with that of Ranking 
Member Senator CAPITO and say I rise 
in support of the amendment offered by 
Senator LUMMIS, Senator CORNYN, Sen-
ator KELLY to direct the U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation to conduct a 
highway user cost allocation study, 
that we are going to vote on here in 
just a minute or two. 
A cost allocation study helps deter-
mine the costs in terms of road use and 
damage that are attributable to the 
different types of vehicles that use our 
roads. This study will evaluate vehicle 
weights and miles that are traveled in 
each class to determine the use and 
damage done to roads, and then com-
pare them to the amount paid in user 
fees to the Highway Trust Fund. 
My colleagues know the Highway 
Trust Fund has been spending more 
than it collects for nearly two decades, 
and as we look to equitably address 
this growing shortfall, this study will 
help us better understand the extent to 
which different roadway users benefit 
from roads and how they should fairly 
contribute to the upkeep of those 
roads, highways, and bridges. 
This cost allocation will help Con-
gress ensure that our vehicles pay their 
fair share. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this very worthy 
amendment. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded.

(Ms.

Under the previous order requiring 60

The amendment (No. 2181) was agreed

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2255 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, infra-
structure is important. We all need it. 
We rely on it to get to and from our 
homes, to and from work. We rely on it 
for our day-to-day needs. It has to be 
there. Not all of it has to be Federal, 
and what is Federal can be made more 
efficient. My amendment today is di-
rected at exactly that set of objectives. 
It would finally resolve the fiscal in-
solvency of the highway trust fund and 
give Americans a tax cut. It would 
allow Americans to pay less and Fed-
eral, State, and local governments to 
build more. Pay less, build more—that 
is the emphasis of this entire amend-
ment. We should pay less for what we 
need, and we should build more of it. 
Specifically, my amendment would 
transfer $120 billion in unused COVID– 
19 funds to the highway trust fund. It 
returns the scope of the highway trust 
fund dollars so that they can be used 
only for projects on the Interstate 
Highway System. This was, after all, 
why the gasoline tax was created, and 
it ought to be what we use it for today. 
After all, most roads are not inter-
state, and most systems are not the 
Interstate Highway System. The Fed-
eral Government doesn’t need to do all 
of it. 
And, in fact, what we find is that, 
when States and localities do infra-
structure, they can do so more effi-
ciently, far less expensively as a result 
of the Byzantine labyrinth of Federal 
regulations that you have to comply 
with as soon as you are doing any kind 
of a road project that involves even a 
single dollar of Federal funds. My 
amendment also requires a 5-year plan 
to pay off all of our highway trust 
fund’s outstanding obligations. 
And, on day one, my amendment re-
duces the fuel tax from 18.4 cents to 7 
cents on gasoline and the diesel tax 
from 24.3 to 8.3 cents to keep pace with 
the current spending needs of the 
Interstate Highway System. 
We also can’t forget the burdensome 
Federal regulations and intervention 
that balloon the costs of our country’s 
infrastructure projects. The Competi-
tive Enterprise Institute has estimated 
that Federal regulations and interven-
tion cost American consumers and 
businesses nearly $2 trillion annually. 
We know that, within Federal infra-
structure projects, there are a mul-
titude of Federal regulations that drive 
up the cost of each project by as much

as 20 percent, in many cases more like 
30 percent, and I am told, in some 
cases, even more than that. 
Ultimately, we drive up infrastruc-
ture costs when we make the projects 
Federal. It doesn’t need to be this way, 
because most of these are not Federal 
projects. That is why my amendment 
also addresses two key regulatory chal-
lenges in our infrastructure context. 
One, it reforms the NEPA process to 
ensure 
projects 
are 
given 
certain 
timelines and not stalled out by frivo-
lous lawsuits. It reforms NEPA so that 
our infrastructure money actually goes 
to NEPA rather than resulting in end-
less delays brought about by NEPA and 
NEPA-related litigation. 
Two, it repeals the Davis-Bacon wage 
requirements that artificially increase 
the labor costs beyond what the mar-
ket demands—labor costs that are es-
pecially important and hard felt right 
now given the labor shortage. 
The Senate has a choice today. You 
can choose to pay less and build more. 
You can offer Americans a tax cut—a 
tax cut that will affect poor and mid-
dle-class 
Americans 
most 
acutely, 
most immediately, most directly—and 
it will also simultaneously provide 
long-term solvency to the highway 
trust fund and lower the costs of our 
Nation’s infrastructure projects. 
Or, alternatively, if you don’t want 
to vote for this, you can choose our 
current path, which is to continue to 
saddle the American people with debt, 
more inflation, financial insolvency, 
and more inevitable taxes. You can 
also vote against it and choose to con-
tinue the current practice of allowing 
for endless, needless, pointless delays 
in our infrastructure projects that 
really harm Americans. 
Look, at the end of the day, we just 
want more of our tax dollars going into 
funding steel and concrete to go into 
the ground so that America’s moms 
and dads can spend less time stuck in 
gridlock traffic and more time with 
their families. The choice seems very 
clear to me. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for 
this amendment to build more and pay 
less. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 2 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
have great respect for my colleague 
from Utah, but I am in firm opposition 
to his amendment. 
It would completely undo months of 
hard work, bipartisan hard work. The 
two major bipartisan infrastructure 
bills that Chairman CARPER and I and 
the EPW Committee passed unani-
mously would be totally undone here. 
The bipartisan gang spent months 
carefully and considerably negotiating 
this agreement with the White House. 
All of these meaningful investments 
that I talked about yesterday would be 
gone: the new bridge program—gone; 
supplemental funding for the Appa-
lachian Development Highway Sys-
tem—gone; broadband funding needed 
to help close the digital divide—gone. 
We have come too far to throw all of 
this bipartisan work away on this sub-
stitute. Time is of the essence. Let’s 
give our States the certainty that they 
need. 
By the way, there is permitting re-
form in this bill, right here, as we look 
at it. Let’s get this across the finish 
line. So I would urge my colleagues to 
vote no on this amendment. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I, 
too, rise in opposition to Senator LEE’s 
amendment. 
This amendment does not reform the 
Federal-aid highway system as we 
know it; it dismantles it. It eliminates 
the Federal funding that each of our 
States relies on to build, repair, and to 
maintain our Federal highways. It 
would strike the entire surface reau-
thorization in this bill before us and re-
place it with an interstate highway- 
only bill with top-line funding of less 
than $20 billion over 5 years. 
At a time when we already have some 
45,000 structurally deficient bridges in 
our Nation, this amendment would 
leave American travelers at risk due to 
serious disinvestment. 
Senators have come together, Demo-
crats and Republicans, to bring this in-
frastructure bill to the floor because 
we recognize that States are in need of 
serious 
investment 
to 
rebuild 
our 
crumbling infrastructure. 
This is not a partisan issue. On the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee, where Senator CAPITO and I 
lead, we voted unanimously to advance 
a highway bill out of committee on a 
unanimous vote—20 to nothing. That 
bill increases the top-line funding for 
our highway Federal programs by 34 
percent to a little over $300 billion—the 
highest amount of highway funding 
ever authorized by this Congress—and 
it is much needed. 
Senator LEE’s amendment would go 
in the exact opposite direction, unfor-
tunately. It would reduce the funding 
in our bill to less than $20 billion. That 
is a cut of about 95 percent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as a

important 
physical 
infrastructure— 
roads, bridges, water systems, waste-
water plants—are, and I am delighted 
that we are finally beginning to ad-
dress our long-neglected physical infra-
structure. That is enormously impor-
tant. 
But I will tell you what is even more 
important, and that is to address the 
human infrastructure, the needs of the

August 3, 2021 
working class of this country, the mid-
dle class of this country, the low-in-
come people of our country, whether 
they are Black or White or Latino or 
Native American, Asian American— 
needs that have been neglected for dec-
ades. 
It is no secret to the American people 
that, for a very long time, the U.S. 
Congress has paid keen attention to 
the needs of the people on top. Yet we 
have turned our backs on millions of 
people who are struggling to put food 
on the table, to take care of their kids, 
to take care of their parents. And on 
top of that, obviously, we have ignored 
the great existential crisis of our time, 
and that is climate change. 
And the result of all of that is that, 
today, the gap between the very, very 
rich and everybody else is wider than it 
has been in 100 years. Today, you have 
two 
people—two 
people—who 
have 
more wealth than the bottom 40 per-
cent. And for many of our billionaire 
friends, apparently they are increas-
ingly unconcerned about what happens 
here on Earth because they are off in 
outer space. But some of us who go 
home every weekend to our States and 
our districts, we kind of are worried 
about what is going on down on Earth 
and the needs of working families. 
So, Mr. President, as you know, as 
soon as we address this bipartisan 
physical infrastructure bill, we are 
going to move toward what I consider 
to be one of the most consequential 
pieces of legislation for working fami-
lies since FDR, the New Deal, and the 
Great Depression. And we are going 
there and addressing the needs of work-
ing families because we understand 
that real wages for workers have not 
gone up in 50 years. An explosion of 
technology, an explosion of worker pro-
ductivity, and yet, in real inflation ac-
counted-for 
dollars, 
many 
workers 
today are not making a nickel more 
than they did 50 years ago. 
We are going forward on the rec-
onciliation bill to address the needs of 
the working class because, in the rich-
est country in the history of the world, 
it is unacceptable that half of our peo-
ple are living paycheck to paycheck. 
They go to work, and at the end of the 
week they have got nothing in the 
bank, and maybe they are even further 
behind because they can’t afford their 
healthcare needs, the rent, and the 
educational costs of their children. 
We are going to go forward and pass 
this legislation because the time is 
long overdue for the U.S. Congress to 
begin to make sure the American peo-
ple understand that our job is not just 
to represent the corporate elites and 
wealthy campaign contributors but to 
address the needs of the struggling men 
and women of our country. 
On top of all of that, it would be in-
comprehensible to the people of our 
country who turn on the TV and they 
see the west coast burning; they see 
the drought in the Midwest; they see 
the floods all over Europe; Australia on 
fire—it would be incomprehensible and 
a real crime against future generations 
if we did not finally address, in a sig-
nificant way, the existential threat not 
only to our country but to the world in 
terms of climate. 
And I wanted to talk a little bit 
about some of the work that the Budg-
et Committee has done and what is 
going to be in that reconciliation pack-
age because my friends here in the 
media are very concerned about proc-
ess, which is fine, but the American 
people want to know: Hey, what is the 
Congress going to do for me? What is it 
going to do to improve my life, my 
children’s lives, my parents’ lives? 
What are we going to do to save the 
planet? 
For a start, we understand that it is 
absolutely imperative to end the ob-
scenity of some of the wealthiest peo-
ple in this country and the largest cor-
porations, in a given year, not paying a 
nickel in Federal income taxes. 
So what we have seen in the pan-
demic, what we have seen in recent 
years is the very, very wealthiest peo-
ple 
becoming 
phenomenally 
richer. 
And then there are studies that are 
coming out that show that, in a given 
year, some of the very wealthiest peo-
ple in this country—multi, multi-
billionaires—are not paying a nickel in 
Federal income tax. 
At a time when corporate profits are 
soaring, we are seeing many major cor-
porations, making billions a year, also 
not paying a nickel in Federal income 
tax. And we are also seeing the phar-
maceutical industry, which is enor-
mously profitable, which charges our 
people the highest prices in the world 
for the prescription drugs that we des-
perately need—we are seeing a situa-
tion where they can charge us any-
thing they want because of the power 
of their lobbyists and their campaign 
contributions. And we are going to put 
an end to that as well because we are 
going to demand that Medicare start 
negotiating prescription drug costs 
with the pharmaceutical industry. 
So my Republican colleagues say: 
Well, they are going to be raising 
taxes. 
Yes, we are going to be raising taxes 
on billionaires and on large, profitable 
corporations, and we are going to de-
mand that the pharmaceutical indus-
try stop ripping us off. But we are ad-
hering to President Biden’s belief, 
which I share, that nobody earning less 
than $400,000 a year should pay a nickel 
more in taxes. We are going to do ex-
actly what the American people want 
us to do and tell the billionaire class 
that they are going to have to start 
paying their fair share of taxes. 
What else are we going to do, and 
what are we going to use that money 
for? We are going to use that money to 
start protecting the needs of our chil-
dren, working families, and the elderly. 
I think many Americans now see 
what public policy can mean in their 
lives because we are providing a $300-a- 
month check per child. The United 
States has the highest rate of child-
hood poverty of almost any major 
country on Earth. That is a disgrace, 
and it should be unacceptable to every 
Member of the Senate. Well, we are 
going to end that. 
I am very proud to say, Mr. Presi-
dent, as I know you know, that as a re-
sult of the 1-year child tax credit ex-
tension, $300 per child, we have reduced 
childhood poverty in America by 61 
percent. Parents all over—in Vermont, 
California—now have the ability to 
start taking care of their children. Our 
job in reconciliation is either to make 
that $300 a month permanent, which I 
would like to see, or at the very least 
extend it for a number of years. 
Furthermore, in the United States of 
America, every person in this Chamber 
should 
be 
disgusted 
by 
the 
dysfunctionality of our childcare sys-
tem. This is not 1950. Mom is going out 
to work. Dad is going out to work. And 
they 
demand 
quality, 
affordable 
childcare, which does not exist today. 
What we say and what our goal is, is 
that no working family in this country 
should be paying more than 7 percent 
of their income for childcare. On top of 
that, we are going to make pre-K edu-
cation for 3- and 4-year-olds free. Yes, 
that is right—free. We are going to do 
what other industrialized countries do 
and understand that the most impor-
tant investment we can make is in the 
little children. 
By the way, when we do that, we are 
going to allow well over a million 
women to go back to work because 
they no longer have to stay home be-
cause of lack of affordable childcare. 
It is a bit embarrassing that our 
great country is the only major coun-
try on Earth not to guarantee paid 
family and medical leave. Imagine 
that. Every other country in the world, 
virtually, does that. In America, I have 
met with women, low-income women, 
who give birth, and then they have to 
go back to work in a week or two be-
cause they don’t have the money to 
stay home. We are going to end that. 
We are going to have, as a nation, 
guaranteed paid family and medical 
leave. 
We are going to address the reality 
that many of our younger people are 
unable to obtain the good-paying jobs 
that are out there because they lack 
the higher education. 
Now, I myself will go further than 
this bill is going to go. I think time is 
long overdue to make public colleges 
and universities tuition-free and cancel 
all student debt. That is not what is in 
this bill. But what is in this bill says 
that, at the very least, every American 
will have the right to get 2 years of 
community college, and they can use 
that to get the training they need, to 
get the good jobs. Maybe it is nursing. 
Maybe it is something else. But they 
will also get the credits they need so 
they can transfer into a 4-year school, 
making a big step forward in getting 
young people the ability to get the 
training they need and the education 
they need to obtain the good-paying 
jobs that are out there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5692 
August 3, 2021 
Mr. President, I know that you are 
aware that right here in this country, 
right here on Capitol Hill, Washington, 
DC, you have people sleeping out on 
the street, and they are sleeping out on 
the street in every State in this coun-
try. In fact, we have almost 600,000 peo-
ple sleeping out on the streets of the 
wealthiest country in the history of 
the world. Well, this legislation will 
create millions of jobs in housing and 
in other areas because we are going to 
build the lower income and affordable 
housing that we need. 
It is not only homelessness. You have 
18 million households spending 50 per-
cent of their limited incomes on hous-
ing. We need to build low-income and 
affordable housing, and when we do 
that, we will create a heck of a lot of 
good-paying jobs. 
Just today, I talked to a gentleman 
whose wife is very, very ill and who is 
having a hard time affording the home 
healthcare that he is paying for. 
We are an aging society, and whether 
people 
have 
severe 
disabilities 
or 
whether they are just getting old, peo-
ple would rather stay at home in many 
cases rather than be forced into nurs-
ing homes. What our legislation will do 
is 
significantly 
improve 
home 
healthcare in this country and make 
sure that those people who provide 
that important service, difficult serv-
ice, are adequately compensated. 
I know that many of my Republican 
colleagues don’t believe that climate 
change is real, don’t believe that we 
should do anything about it, but they 
are dead wrong. And we cannot go 
home and look our children and grand-
children in the eye knowing what we 
know, knowing that in many ways, the 
climate crisis turns out to be worse 
than what scientists predicted it would 
be. 
Climate 
ordinarily 
changes 
over 
thousands of years, hundreds of years. 
We are seeing the change in climate 
with our own eyes year by year. It is 
frightening. And if people think that 
the forest fires in Oregon, California, 
Montana, and elsewhere are an aberra-
tion, that they are once-in-a-lifetime, 
you are wrong. Everything being equal, 
we will see worse in years to come. 
The truth is, what makes this crisis 
so difficult, we can’t solve it alone. We 
are going to have to work with China 
and India and Europe. We have to bring 
the world together to save this planet 
for our kids and future generations. 
This legislation takes an important 
step forward. It doesn’t go as far as it 
should, but it is a major step forward 
in transforming our energy system 
away from fossil fuel to energy effi-
ciency and sustainable energy. 
I know we will be hearing from my 
Republican colleagues who are very 
upset that this will be a partisan bill, 
which it will be, but let me remind 
them that they use the so-called rec-
onciliation process recently in two 
areas—two areas. 
No. 1, they thought it important to 
go forward in a partisan way, without 
Democratic support, for the enor-
mously important goal of giving mas-
sive tax breaks to billionaires and 
large corporations. That is how they 
used the reconciliation process. 
Well, we have a little different idea. 
We are going to use the reconciliation 
process and the 50 votes we have with 
the Vice President to protect the work-
ing families of this country, not the 
billionaire class. 
The other effort that they made in 
terms of reconciliation was to try—and 
they came within one vote of doing it; 
the late John McCain—they would 
have thrown up to 30 million Ameri-
cans off of healthcare by ending the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
So they have used reconciliation, and 
we will use it, except we are going to 
use it to protect ordinary Americans— 
the children, the elderly, the sick, and 
the poor—rather than just the very 
wealthy or the pharmaceutical indus-
try. 
We are now in the midst of a debate 
over the physical infrastructure, the 
bipartisan bill—very important. We 
need to rebuild our roads and bridges, 
but more important is the need to ad-
dress the crises facing working families 
all over this country. When we go for-
ward and do that, when we protect our 
children and the elderly and the envi-
ronment, we are going to create mil-
lions of good-paying jobs, put people to 
work rebuilding this country in a way 
that is long, long overdue. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
where our country is in the fight 
against coronavirus. 
The 
simple 
message 
on 
the 
coronavirus is this: Vaccines work. The 
single most important thing you want 
to do to protect yourself and to protect 
your family is to get vaccinated. That 
is the only message we ought to be 
sending out. 
I am a doctor. I have been vac-
cinated. My wife has been vaccinated. 
Our kids have been vaccinated. There 
is overwhelming evidence that vaccines 
are highly effective against serious ill-
ness. 
Yet we are talking about this issue 
today because of the chaos and the con-
fusion that have come about due to 
messaging coming out of the White 
House and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. That is why, with 
limited floor time during this impor-
tant debate on spending, I come to the 
floor today to discuss this specific 
issue. 
President Biden and the CDC ought 
to be found guilty of medical mal-
practice for the comments that they 
have been making. Back in May, the 
Centers for Disease Control said, and 
the President repeated it at the White 
House, that if you have been vac-
cinated, if you have been fully vac-
cinated, you don’t need to wear a mask 
either indoors or outdoors. Now they 
are saying that even if you have been 
fully vaccinated, you need to wear a 
mask again indoors. 
At a time when we are trying to en-
courage people to get vaccinated, I ask, 
how is this going to help someone who 
hasn’t 
been 
vaccinated, 
encourage 
them to get vaccinated if you are tell-
ing them that even if you get vac-
cinated, you still have to wear a mask? 
This flip-flopping in policy is why 
Americans, I think, are very worried 
and concerned and somewhat anxious 
about the activities of this administra-
tion. They are wondering: What comes 
next—flip-flop on masks? Is this ad-
ministration 
going 
to 
flip-flop 
on 
lockdowns, on shutdowns, on closing 
schools? 
People say: Oh no, don’t worry about 
that. 
Well, Mr. President, let me tell you, 
just 
this 
past 
weekend, 
Randi 
Weingarten—she is the head of one of 
America’s biggest teachers unions, the 
American Federation of Teachers—she 
refused to commit to in-person learn-
ing this fall, this coming school year. 
The president of America’s biggest 
teachers union refused to commit to 
in-person learning this fall. So the 
American people have every right to be 
concerned and anxious and angry with 
the communications coming out of this 
administration and the directives this 
week. Parents are angry that kids have 
already lost too much. 
And think about this: Now NANCY 
PELOSI
is requiring fully vaccinated 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives to wear masks or they will be 
charged a fine. She has even threat-
ened—threatened—to tell the Capitol 
Police to arrest staff members—fully 
vaccinated staff members—who aren’t 
wearing masks. These are people who 
have been vaccinated. 
At the same time, the Biden adminis-
tration is throwing our southern border 
wide open to 180,000 illegal immigrants 
a month, with almost every disease 
known to man. We are talking about 
people who are undocumented and 
unvaccinated. 
When I went to the border earlier 
this spring, our border agents told me 
that they had arrested people from 50 
different countries. Of course, these 
people are all coming from places 
where vaccination rates are much 
lower than they are in our country. 
Since the start of the pandemic, 
more than 8,000 Border Patrol officers 
have tested positive for coronavirus. 
Thirty-two of these agents have died. 
When I visited the border, roughly 1 in 
10 of the unaccompanied children in 
custody had tested positive, and they 
were intermingled with others who had 
tested positive and those not tested

positive. They were all crammed in 
like sardines, and the testing occurred 
only when they were getting ready to 
be released and then sent all around 
America, spreading the coronavirus 
wherever they went. 
And it is interesting to listen to 
Democrats in the national media and 
on the Hill who want to blame Repub-
licans for any vaccine hesitancy that is 
out there. Well, let me set the record 
straight on that. 
Republican 
elected 
officials 
have 
gone out of our way to encourage vac-
cinations. It is the responsible thing to 
do. I have traveled from one vaccina-
tion site to another all around the 
State of Wyoming; made public service 
announcements with other doctors and 
doctors who are members of the Doc-
tors Caucus in Congress, in the House 
and the Senate; made public service 
announcements; put them out on vid-
eos and sent them around the country. 
The truth is that there are a large 
number of Democrats who are still 
unvaccinated. 
Forty 
percent—forty 
percent—as of today, of New York City 
public school employees have not been 
vaccinated, and it is ready for the 
school year to start. And yet we don’t 
have a commitment from the head of 
the teachers union to have in-person 
learning this year. Forty percent of the 
public hospital workers in New York 
City are unvaccinated. Forty-one per-
cent of Chicago residents are not vac-
cinated. If you take a look, city by 
city—Democrat-run cities—a high per-
centage of people are not vaccinated, 
and yet President Biden and the Senate 
majority leader continue to point fin-
gers. 
It does seem to me that Democrats 
have utterly failed to communicate a 
clear message to get the American peo-
ple vaccinated. In fact, I think Demo-
crat politicians have been a big part of 
the problem from the beginning. 
Early on, when the vaccine was cur-
rently being developed, people were 
hoping for a vaccine. We saw the Vice 
Presidential debate—57 million people 
watching—and then, at the time, Vice 
Presidential candidate, at the time 
Senator HARRIS, now Vice President 
HARRIS, said she would not get a vac-
cine developed under the Trump ad-
ministration. 
She said: ‘‘If Donald Trump tells us 
we should take it, I’m not going to 
take it.’’ 
Before Democrats point the finger at 
Republicans, they should get their own 
cities vaccinated. 
There is much more to talk about. 
There have been many mistakes 
made 
by 
this 
administration 
and 
Democrats over the last 6 months, but 
it is no coincidence that, over the last 
3 months, we have seen a historic drop 
in national optimism. A majority of 
the country says America is now on the 
wrong track. Just one in three Ameri-
cans is satisfied with the way things 
are going in this country. Fully, only 
one in five Americans has switched 
from optimistic about our future to 
pessimistic about our future in just 3 
months. 
Fully, one in five Americans flipped 
on their thoughts on the direction of 
the country, and it is easy to see why. 
They see inflation eating away at their 
paychecks. They see Democrats piling 
up debt on our kids and grandkids. 
They see their taxes are about to go up 
again. They see an open southern bor-
der. They see rising crime in Democrat 
cities. And independent voters are run-
ning away from Democrats as fast as 
they can. 
It is time for Democrats to get the 
message. We want to get the virus be-
hind us. The answer is not open bor-
ders. The answer is not more flip-flops, 
and it is not more mandates on the 
American people. 
It is time for the Democrats to stop 
pointing fingers. The school year re-
turns in just a matter of weeks. Every 
school in America must be open. It is 
time for Democrats to follow the 
science. No more flip-flops, no more 
mandates, 
no 
more 
lockdowns—no 
more excuses. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID CHIPMAN 
Madam President, I come to the 
floor, at this point, to oppose the nomi-
nation of David Chipman as Director of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives. 
David Chipman is an anti-gun ex-
tremist who would politicize one of the 
world’s greatest law enforcement Agen-
cies, the ATF. If confirmed, he would 
be the most radically anti-gun Director 
in ATF history. 
David Chipman’s views are com-
pletely out of touch with those of the 
American people. He opposed the Su-
preme Court case that struck down 
Washington, DC’s ban on handguns, the 
Heller case. He was party to a legal 
brief in the case which said the Second 
Amendment, he said, only protects mi-
litias. He supports bringing back the 
1994 assault weapons ban, which Presi-
dent Biden often brags that he wrote. 
Congress let that ban expire because 
there was never any proof that it 
brought down crime. 
During his hearing with the Judici-
ary Committee, Senator COTTON spe-
cifically asked Mr. Chipman to define 
what an ‘‘assault weapon’’ is. 
Mr. Chipman said: ‘‘An assault weap-
on would be whatever Congress defines 
it as.’’ 
Senator COTTON went on to ask Mr. 
Chipman for his own definition of an 
‘‘assault weapon.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Any semi-automatic rifle 
capable of accepting a detachable mag-
azine above a 22.’’ 
Well, as Senator COTTON
rightly 
pointed out, this would ban most sport-
ing rifles in America. If David Chipman 
made our gun laws, most sporting rifles 
would be banned. States could ban 
handguns. Private gun sales would be 
illegal. 
These views are completely out of 
touch with the views of more than 100 
million Americans who are law-abiding 
gun owners. 
Worst of all, David Chipman does not 
have the character and integrity to 
lead the ATF. He has repeatedly 
mocked gun owners and impugned peo-
ple’s motives for owning a gun. 
David Chipman said: Gun ownership 
‘‘is a way you can act patriotic without 
having to’’ serve in the military. 
He said: ‘‘I [would] compare gun own-
ership . . . to the same reason Ameri-
cans might want a muscle car.’’ 
This is not why people buy guns. The 
American people buy guns to protect 
themselves and to keep their families 
safe. 
The American people are buying guns 
by the millions right now because they 
are afraid of Democrats’ gun control 
policies, and they are afraid of crime in 
Democrat cities. 
Last year, Democrats cut $1 billion 
in police funding across America, and 
as a result, we saw the largest increase 
in murder in 60 years. In response, the 
American people bought more than 20 
million guns, including 8 million guns 
by first-time gun owners—first-time 
gun owners—because they realized they 
weren’t able to be protected when 
those are trying to defund the police. 
Gun ownership is still going up because 
the Democrats are still defunding po-
lice, and Democrat cities are in chaos. 
We don’t need an ATF Director who 
mocks nearly half of the country. 
Recently, we found out another seri-
ous concern about Mr. Chipman’s char-
acter. According to media reports, mul-
tiple ATF agents say David Chipman 
was accused of making racist com-
ments about African Americans. I 
won’t repeat them here. The comments 
are of great concern. According to the 
reports, the racist comments were re-
ported to the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission, and a com-
plaint was filed against him. 
Republicans on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee have called for another 
hearing in light of this new informa-
tion that has come out. I commend my 
colleagues for their due diligence. 
Yet I don’t think another hearing is 
necessary. What is necessary is for 
President Biden to withdraw this nomi-
nation. There are plenty of qualified 
Democrats out there who could be 
nominated to do this job. 
The men and women of the ATF de-
serve a leader with integrity and with 
respect for the Second Amendment to 
our Constitution. More than 100 mil-
lion legal gun owners in this country 
deserve it, too. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SINEMA). The clerk will call the roll.

Mr. CARPER. Madam President, un-
less someone else wishes to speak at 
this time, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
rise in opposition to the Duckworth 
amendment, 2140, and I want to talk 
about that briefly. 
First of all, I think there is probably 
very broad support in this Chamber, 
and I certainly support the idea that 
local transit agencies meet ADA stand-
ards wherever it is possible to do so. 
Of course, transit agencies got a 
truly massive, staggering amount of 
money over about a 12-month period 
ending in March—so much so that, cu-
mulatively, they are sitting on some-
thing very close to $40 billion that they 
just weren’t even able to spend. 
But despite all that, we dramatically 
increased the annual run rate of the 
Federal Government’s contribution to 
transit agencies; and then on top of 
that, the bipartisan negotiators agreed 
to a big, one-time plus-up above and 
beyond all the money that was sent to 
these transit agencies over the last 
year. 
In the course of these discussions, in-
cluded for transit agencies was a near-
ly $2 billion funding request to the Sen-
ator from Illinois—the junior Senator 
from Illinois—specifically for ADA up-
grades at big city transit systems. 
To my knowledge, it is the first time 
that the Federal Government has ever 
specifically appropriated substantial 
sums of money—nearly $2 billion this 
time—for the purpose of improving, up-
grading big city transit systems, in 
part, perhaps, because, of course, tran-
sit systems have their own sources of 
money, their own States that can pro-
vide them. 
But, anyway, that was—this agree-
ment was struck. Now, in the course of 
working out the terms and the details 
and negotiating over the language 
which would accompany this unprece-
dented funding for ADA upgrades, you 
know, there were negotiations. That is 
the nature of this process. So we asked 
for certain changes in the language 
that was initially proposed. Some of 
those requests were rejected, some 
were adopted, and that is how we got to 
a deal. 
And one of the changes that was 
adopted was an agreement that this 
amendment—this planning mandate re-
quirement that is contemplated in the 
amendment from the Senator from Illi-
nois, that plan would be dropped. 
If we were to go ahead and now adopt 
this amendment, it would completely 
violate the deal that was struck. 
Now, let me just briefly explain why 
we requested that that language be 
dropped. The amendment stipulates, 
among other things, that as a condi-
tion of receiving this nearly $2 billion 
that this agreement offers to transit 
agencies for this specific purpose—as a 
condition, it said a transit agency 
must commit to a new Federal race, 
age, and income equity mandate. 
This is a quote: 
. . . equity of service to all riders . . . tak-
ing into account historical and current serv-
ice gaps . . . 
This is politically correct virtue sig-
naling. This is people claiming that 
transit agencies are somehow racist, 
and that we have got to—I don’t 
know—we have got to make sure that 
escalators are not racist. 
It doesn’t take a very fertile imagi-
nation to think about how this lan-
guage could be used to impose a host of 
new requirements on agencies. You 
could have bureaucracies here micro-
managing 
who 
knows 
what—route 
planning, fair pricing, frequency of 
service—out of some presumed sys-
temic racism in transit agencies. 
If we adopted this, then decisions by 
transit agencies that should be guided 
by cost and ridership issues would end 
up being influenced by wokeism. 
Now, I think the people who run 
transit agencies are good and decent 
people who care about their commu-
nities. They are trying to do the best 
they can. They have now got stag-
gering amounts of money with which 
to do it, but they don’t need to be sec-
ond-guessed by social engineers who 
are insisting that their agency is rife 
with racism. 
So I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I want to 
stress that the ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment doesn’t reduce spending for 
ADA compliance by a dime. That is not 
what this is about. This is about avoid-
ing a ‘‘woke’’ planning mandate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 2 min-
utes of debate, equally divided, prior to 
the vote in relation to Duckworth 
amendment No. 2140. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
amendment is pending. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
last week, our Nation marked the 31st 
anniversary of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act. More than three decades 
have passed since President George H. 
W. Bush signed the ADA into law and 
proudly declared ‘‘[L]et the shameful 
wall of exclusion finally come tum-
bling down.’’ 
This past week was a time for cele-
bration and reflection on the progress 
we have made over the last 30 years. 
Yet, when it comes to the ADA’s guar-
antee of equal access to public trans-
portation for people with disabilities, 
many transit and commuter rail sys-
tems continue to fall short. 
This amendment is not racist. This 
amendment does not call any par-
ticular Agency racist. In fact, what 
this amendment does—the substitute 
amendment includes $1.75 billion to ex-
pedite accessibility upgrades at exist-
ing legacy rail fixed guideway public 
transportation systems. My amend-
ment simply ensures that recipients of 
these critical Federal resources fully 
consider the goals and requirements of 
the ADA and develop a plan to maxi-
mize accessibility across their systems. 
This is common sense and good gov-
ernment. 
It 
ensures 
accountability 
that taxpayer dollars are used to fulfill 
promises made decades ago and are 
used wisely, with maximum effective-
ness. 
Thirty years after we committed to a 
goal of inclusive and equitable trans-
portation, transit operators should be 
held accountable for meaningful acces-
sibility upgrades. It is not enough for 
grant recipients to add cosmetic up-
grades and pat themselves on the back. 
Disabled commuters deserve the acces-
sibility that others take for granted. 
This is not a partisan issue. I call on 
every Member in this Chamber to stand 
with me in supporting equity for people 
with disabilities and supporting good 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. May I be recognized 
for 2 minutes in opposition? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
One 
minute. 
Mr. TOOMEY. One minute. 
Well, listen, I just want to stress to 
my colleagues here that defeating this 
amendment does not prevent one dime 
from going to transit agencies for the 
purpose of upgrading their stations to

comply with the ADA. All it does is 
prevent a mandate for a ‘‘woke’’ plan-
ning provision that was dropped in the 
negotiations on this bill, so I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in support of the Duckworth 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Senator DUCKWORTH’s 
amendment. This amendment will en-
sure that recipients of funding to make 
systems more accessible have a plan in 
place to comply with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. 
Individuals with disabilities rely on 
public transit to get where they need 
to go, whether that is to go to work or 
to go to school or simply go about 
their daily lives. It is past time to up-
grade all of our transit stations to pro-
vide access to everyone who needs a 
ride. 
I support this amendment by Senator 
DUCKWORTH. I urge all of our colleagues 
to join me in voting yes. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). On this vote, the yeas are 48, the 
nays are 50. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is not agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2140) was re-
jected. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2300 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote in relation to the Cruz- 
Warnock amendment, No. 2300. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleague from Georgia, Sen-
ator WARNOCK, for leading this amend-
ment with me. 
The 
amendment 
is 
simple 
and 
straightforward: 
designating 
future 
Interstate 14 across Texas, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The 
amendment does not have any cost as-
sociated with it; rather, it is a first 
step in the process of upgrading this 
system of roads to add freight capacity 
and connect strategic military instal-
lations across our States. 
In Texas, our part of I–14 will be ex-
panded to the west so that it will serve 
San Angelo, Goodfellow Air Force 
Base, Midland-Odessa, and the Permian 
Basin. It will connect with I–20 at Mid-
land-Odessa, which runs westward to 
connect with I–10 and leads to El Paso 
and Fort Bliss. This will complete the 
linkage between six military facilities 
across three States, which is critical 
for economic development and national 
security. 
I would like to add that this amend-
ment has the support of the depart-
ments of transportation in Texas, in 
Louisiana, in Mississippi, in Alabama, 
and in Georgia, as well as untold num-
bers of local leaders and coalitions of 
businesses and local governments. 
So, again, I want to thank my col-
league Senator WARNOCK for leading 
this bipartisan amendment with me. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I am 
grateful for the opportunity to partner 
with my colleague from Texas on this 
infrastructure development, and I ask 
for the support of all of my colleagues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 1 minute on this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of this bipartisan amendment 
in the spirit in which it has been of-
fered. 
The amendment will designate five 
different 
States—Texas, 
Louisiana, 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia—as 
the future Interstate 14 corridor. The 
sponsors state that this would really be 
integral for economic development sup-
port, to support tourism and also pro-
vide an important link to our military 
facilities. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
yes on the Cruz-Warnock amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Could I have the atten-
tion of our colleagues. In addition to 
the meritorious points that have been 
made by the sponsors of this legisla-
tion and the ranking member of the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee—Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to address the Senate 
out of order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, anytime 
these two Members get together and 
offer legislation, how could any of us 
say no? Maybe we could get a voice 
vote; I don’t know. We will see. 
Thanks very much. Congratulations. 
You bring joy to this place. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent for a voice vote. Does the gen-
tleman from Texas mind getting a 
voice vote? 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, a voice 
vote would be fine if it would be fine 
procedurally. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw the 60- 
vote hurdle. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. There we go. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2300 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment, No. 2300. 
The amendment (No. 2300) was agreed 
to. 
Mr. CARPER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
all know by now, a bipartisan group of 
Senators worked with the White House 
over the last several weeks to nego-
tiate a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, 
and I know a lot of hard work went 
into it, a lot of late nights, and I want 
to thank all of our colleagues who have 
made a positive contribution in this de-
bate and discussion. It is particularly 
important at this time, I believe, that 
we do these things on a bipartisan 
basis, if we can. 
After much anticipation, we finally 
received the text Sunday night, and a 
lot of what we expected to see, we saw, 
like funding for roads, bridges, ports, 
waterways, airports, and broadband. 
But what we didn’t see were adequate

pay-fors for the bill. For example, we 
learned after the bill was announced 
that it would be essentially a supple-
mental to the current infrastructure 
bill, which would require another $118 
billion in general revenue to fill the 
gap left because of the inadequacy of 
the highway trust fund funding. 
Now, we have all known that that is 
a problem. We had to use general rev-
enue the last time we did a highway 
bill. But that hasn’t really been part of 
the discussion, and I think, once people 
begin to see an additional $118 billion 
in borrowed money in order to pass 
this bill, it causes significant concern. 
I guess the other part of it is that 
this bill seems to be moving at warp 
speed. Under normal circumstances, an 
infrastructure bill would go through a 
long and arduous subcommittee proc-
ess. And I know that the Environment 
and 
Public 
Works 
Committee 
has 
passed a highway bill reauthorization 
twice unanimously, once under Demo-
cratic leadership and once under Re-
publican leadership. So that is a posi-
tive sign. But this is really a huge 
amalgam of legislation that, frankly, 
only about 20 percent of the Senate is 
intimately familiar with. 
Ordinarily, in a committee, both 
sides would debate the bill in hearings, 
markups, evaluate the cost, and offer 
amendments before we get to this proc-
ess, but now we know that has not hap-
pened. Frankly, I think that is unfor-
tunate because I think our committees 
are not operating the way they should, 
which, in turn, I think helps us produce 
a better, more thoughtful product. 
We simply skipped the normal steps 
that would allow Members to raise con-
cerns about the bill long before we got 
here and offer changes to improve it. 
So, as I have said before and I know 
others have said as well, I hope the ma-
jority leader will offer ample time and 
opportunities for Members on both 
sides of the aisle to debate and amend 
this legislation. A robust amendment 
process is essential. 
Over the last few days, I have been 
working with colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to identify new pay-fors 
that could be adopted as amendments. 
We have come up with some, I think, 
promising ideas, and I hope these ideas 
can receive a vote on the Senate floor 
this week. 
For example, I have worked with 
Senator PADILLA, the Senator from 
California, to offer one bipartisan 
amendment 
to 
fund 
infrastructure 
projects in communities across the 
country without increasing the debt. 
Our amendment would simply give the 
State and local governments the flexi-
bility to use unspent COVID–19 funding 
on infrastructure projects. It would 
eliminate the sunset on the use of 
those funds, and it would take the 
guardrails off that say you can only 
use that money for COVID–19 because, 
to be honest, the States and counties 
and cities have more money than they 
know what to do with, at least con-
structively. I think we all would have 
an interest in making sure that money 
is spent well on long-term projects. 
What I just said is not necessarily a 
criticism of the bills that we passed to-
gether on a bipartisan basis. We were 
in the midst of a pandemic, and we 
were all operating in an emergency sit-
uation, trying to do the best we could. 
But we didn’t know how long this virus 
would last, how long it would take to 
get a vaccine, and how long the nega-
tive impact on our economy would last. 
Frankly, we overshot the mark, I 
think, in some aspects of the bill, thus 
leading to the surplus of funds at many 
of our State and local governments. 
Right now, there are limits on how 
that money could be spent. Qualifying 
expenses include things related di-
rectly to the pandemic, like COVID–19 
testing sites, vaccines, PSAs, and addi-
tional bed space for hospitals. 
But this funding can’t currently be 
used for expenses unrelated to the pan-
demic or items that were previously in-
cluded in a budget. They must be new, 
pandemic-related expenses. 
As I said, in theory, at the time we 
did this, it made a lot of sense. After 
all, this funding was meant to bolster 
the fight against COVID–19 in commu-
nities across our country. 
But not every community and not 
every State has the need for these 
types of projects. In many places, the 
most urgent needs aren’t related to the 
pandemic, but, rather, the failing infra-
structure. 
The pandemic interrupted infrastruc-
ture improvements across the country 
and forced many officials to put these 
projects on the back burner. Repairs, 
maintenance, 
and 
construction 
projects were put on hold until there 
was enough funding to get things back 
on track. 
I have heard from State and local 
leaders in my State who are frustrated 
by the lack of flexibility—by the hand-
cuffs, frankly—on their use of the Fed-
eral funding they have already re-
ceived. They want the option, not the 
mandate. They want the option to use 
this money when and where it is need-
ed most, but right now, as I said, their 
hands are tied. 
Many States and localities have re-
lief funds on hand but no necessary, 
qualifying expenses. They have to look 
at this big balance in their accounts 
knowing they won’t be able to spend it 
on the greatest needs of their commu-
nities. Frankly, they are frustrated, 
because I heard from them. 
That is especially the case in rural 
America. In places where COVID–19 
numbers are low, leaders don’t have 
the need or the opportunity to spend 
this money within the set timeline for 
the purposes that Congress has dic-
tated. They don’t need the full range of 
pandemic-related resources that might 
be necessary in other high-density 
urban areas with higher case counts. 
The amendment Senator PADILLA 
and I have offered would give leaders in 
rural areas alike the option of spending 
the funding on necessary infrastruc-
ture projects. This does not touch the 
negotiation between the White House 
and 
so-called 
G–20, 
the 
bipartisan 
group of Senators who came up with 
the substitute bill, which is the base 
bill that we are now debating. This 
would be in addition to it. 
And, frankly, this would be the most 
efficient way to fund many infrastruc-
ture projects in our States and commu-
nities because, as we know, once Con-
gress appropriates money, frequently, 
it takes years before that money 
makes its way to the need. Well, this 
could mean widening a highway, mak-
ing safety improvements on a bridge, 
expanding broadband access. Urban 
areas could even use these funds for 
public transit improvement systems. 
State and local leaders know the 
needs of their communities best, and 
they should have the flexibility to 
spend this money where it is needed 
most. The key here is flexibility. 
Here is the other benefit. It doesn’t 
cost another dime. This is money that 
we have already spent and already sent 
to the States, so the score is a big zero. 
How many times do we have the op-
portunity here to do something big and 
important that doesn’t run up the debt 
or deficit or cost us a lot more money? 
So the key here is flexibility. Our 
amendment doesn’t place a require-
ment or mandate on State and local 
governments to spend this funding on 
anything. 
Any place that has new COVID ex-
penses to cover can and should use this 
funding for that purpose, no questions 
asked. This simply gives leaders at the 
local and State level the option to 
spend those relief funds on urgent in-
frastructure projects that might other-
wise go unfunded or that might not be 
funded for years to come. 
I still remember President Obama, at 
one point after the Great Recession in 
2008 and the recovery, when he talked 
about shovel-ready projects. He said: 
Well, I guess shovel-ready doesn’t real-
ly mean shovel-ready. 
The truth is, we have seen it time 
and time again. Congress appropriates 
money to State and local governments, 
and it literally takes years before the 
money gets to the intended target. 
This short-circuits that project be-
cause the States and local governments 
already have that money and they can 
spend it for this purpose if we will pass 
this amendment. 
I am not alone in thinking this is a 
good idea. Back in March, nearly three 
dozen organizations wrote a letter to 
Secretary Yellen urging her to make 
transportation infrastructure an eligi-
ble expense. They talked about the im-
pact of COVID–19 on transportation 
revenues and noted that, last year, 18 
States and 24 localities announced 
delays or cancellations of transpor-
tation improvement projects totaling 
more than $12 billion. 
These same three dozen organiza-
tions noted the pandemic has impacted 
every 
State 
and 
community 
dif-
ferently, thus the key flexibility. They

said flexibility will be critical to ensur-
ing funds are used expeditiously and 
with maximum impact. That is really 
what we are talking about here. 
Secretary 
Biden’s 
own 
Transpor-
tation Secretary suggested as much. In 
testimony before Congress, Secretary 
Buttigieg said the American Rescue 
Plan ‘‘has some flexibility in it’’ that 
he thinks could be used ‘‘to support 
road budgets that have been im-
pacted.’’ 
States and cities shouldn’t just be 
able to spend this money. They should 
be able to invest it in projects and re-
sources our communities need the 
most. 
This 
is 
simply 
a 
commonsense 
change both sides should be able to get 
behind. It ensures money that has al-
ready gone out the door will be used 
before it expires. It puts decision-mak-
ing at the local level and gives leaders 
more flexibility to decide how to use 
this Federal funding on their most ur-
gent needs; and it does so, as I said, 
without increasing the national deficit 
at all. 
This amendment has earned the sup-
port of a broad range of organizations 
across the country, and I am proud to 
have worked with Senator PADILLA to 
craft this amendment in a way that 
both sides can get behind it. In the 
coming days, I hope this will be one of 
many amendments that will receive a 
vote on the Senate floor, perhaps as 
early as today. 
We have to ensure infrastructure in-
vestments are made fairly and paid for 
reasonably, and a robust amendment 
process is the only way to get there. 
I would just add in closing, some of 
my colleagues have said that they sup-
port this amendment, but they would 
be inclined to vote against it because 
they feel like this somehow violates 
the agreement that the bipartisan ne-
gotiating group had with the White 
House. But as I described it, it doesn’t 
touch—it does not touch that under-
lying substitute bill. 
What it does is it unleashes these 
funds 
in 
States 
like 
Connecticut, 
Michigan, West Virginia, Texas. And it 
lets our State and local leaders figure 
out, if they can’t use these funds, if 
they don’t need these funds for COVID– 
19, how they can use them in a way 
that will have the biggest, most signifi-
cant economic impact on the infra-
structure in their States. 
I hope my colleagues who somehow 
believe that they have sworn a blood 
oath with the White House not to sup-
port any amendments that change the 
underlying substitute—I don’t know 
why we are voting on amendments, un-
less it is to change the underlying sub-
stitute because that is our Constitu-
tional function. It is somehow a par-
allel universe in which the White 
House—a different branch of govern-
ment—is 
telling 
the 
Senate 
what 
amendments we can and cannot pass. 
As we all know, that is not the way 
the Constitution is written. The Con-
stitution said it is our prerogative, as 
Senators representing our States, to 
vote on policies that we think are best 
for our States and for the country. 
Yes, the President has an important 
role, but his role is to veto it if he 
doesn’t like it, not rewrite it, not to 
tell us what amendments we can vote 
on or not vote on. That is a perversion 
of the constitutional system. 
I think, for matters of institutional 
integrity and pride, Senators would be 
very jealous about guarding their au-
thorities under the Constitution rather 
than delegating these to the adminis-
tration. 
I expect this is going to be a long 
road. We have already heard Speaker 
PELOSI say she is not going to pass this 
bill once the Senate passes it until she 
has a chance to pass the $3.5 trillion- 
plus reconciliation bill at the same 
time. This is going to be a very bumpy 
process. 
But the idea that we cut off access 
that our States and local government 
have to hundreds of billions of dollars 
of unused funds to do, in their discre-
tion, what they think needs to be 
done—not a mandate, but, rather, a 
permission to do so. To turn down this 
opportunity to get this money where it 
is needed most in these big impact in-
frastructure projects makes no sense to 
me. I would encourage all our col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak about the bill in front of 
us. 
For a long time, the people in Michi-
gan have been waiting. For years, they 
have been told it is ‘‘infrastructure 
week.’’ Unfortunately, for all the talk, 
Michigan’s 
infrastructure 
remains 
weak. 
This lack of investment has real cost 
for our businesses and our communities 
and our families. I am thinking of the 
single mom who drives to work every 
day and can’t afford to keep making 
car repairs caused by massive potholes, 
an everyday occurrence. 
I am thinking of the small business 
whose deliveries keep being delayed be-
cause of the weight limits on a nearby 
bridge. 
I am thinking of the farmer who 
wants to harness the power of precision 
agricultural to include his bottom line. 
Unfortunately, he can’t because his 
internet is too slow. 
And I am thinking of that farmer’s 
children, who need the internet to keep 
up with their school work, but struggle 
to find a good connection. 
I am thinking of all the folks who 
would love to choose electric the next 
time they buy a car, but worry about 
finding a charging station. 
And I am thinking of the kids in 
Flint and families across the country, 
who should never have to worry that 
the water coming out of their kitchen 
sink is unsafe after traveling through 
lead pipes or becoming contaminated 
by PFAS. 
All these folks want some investment 
in that infrastructure. And now, 1,656 
days after President Trump was sworn 
in and promised swift action to rebuild 
our 
infrastructure, 
President 
Joe 
Biden, working with a hard-working 
group of Democrats and Republican 
Members in the Senate, is leading us to 
get this done. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle and their hard-working staff 
members deserve to take a bow. This 
legislation is chockful of bipartisan 
wins that will strengthen our country 
from Seattle to Saginaw, to Sarasota, 
and communities of every size in be-
tween. 
This legislation isn’t just going to fi-
nally fix our cracking roads and crum-
bling bridges and spotty internet; it is 
going to create good jobs, tackle the 
climate crisis, help us remain competi-
tive with other countries around the 
world that aren’t sitting around wait-
ing for us to catch up. 
As a Michigan driver, one of the 
parts I am most excited about is the 
money to fix our roads and bridges. 
Hey, Governor Whitmer, now you can 
get some help to fix those roads. 
And because we are the Great Lakes 
State, 
transportation 
in 
Michigan 
doesn’t just mean trucks and trains 
and cars. This bill uses $11.7 billion to 
modernize infrastructure, such as the 
aging Soo Locks—so critical to our 
economy, for the country, and for the 
Great Lakes region. 
And it includes $1 billion for the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to 
clean up contamination, restore wet-
lands, and fight invasive species. 
I want to thank my partner and co-
chair of the Great Lakes Restoration 
Caucus, Senator PORTMAN, for working 
on this. That is the single largest in-
vestment ever made in the Great Lakes 
Initiative. 
This will make a big dent in resolv-
ing areas of concern, like the Detroit 
River and the Rouge River, which were 
polluted decades ago. 
While we are on the subject of water, 
it is way past time for Michigan fami-
lies and families across the country to 
feel confident that the water coming 
from their taps is safe to drink, and 
this bill takes critical steps toward 
achieving just that. It includes $15 bil-
lion to replace lead pipes, and another 
$10 billion to tackle the PFAS con-
tamination that plagues our commu-
nities all over Michigan, as well as the 
country. 
Healthy families and a healthy econ-
omy also require high-speed internet. 
We are in 2021. The past 18 months 
proved that as our whole lives moved 
online. We saw all of the gaps in high- 
speed internet services across the coun-
try. So I am very pleased that this bill 
includes $65 billion to ensure that folks 
can get connected whether they live a 
block from Gratiot Avenue or 25 miles 
from Highway 31. 
This bill also takes action to change 
the trajectory of the climate crisis and 
invest in more resilient infrastructure. 
It invests in charging infrastructure so 
that folks who have been thinking

about buying that new F–150 Lightning 
or a Chevy Volt or a Jeep Wrangler can 
make the leap to electric with con-
fidence. We can’t wait any longer be-
cause China certainly isn’t waiting. 
Because this legislation also includes 
my Make It in America Act that I in-
troduced with Senator BRAUN, the 
American taxpayer dollars we will be 
investing will go to American manu-
facturers and American workers. It 
adds new guardrails so that Federal 
Agencies can’t buy products made in 
Mumbai instead of Monroe, MI, when 
those products are available in Michi-
gan. It also calls for products pur-
chased by Federal Agencies to be incor-
porating more domestic content. It 
makes the Made in America Director 
and the Made in America Office a per-
manent part of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget. That will ensure 
that American workers and American 
jobs receive preference regardless of 
who sits in the Oval Office. 
This legislation doesn’t just benefit 
big companies; it also calls for Agen-
cies to use the Manufacturing Exten-
sion Partnership, which is extremely 
effective in Michigan and across the 
country. That means small- and me-
dium-sized manufacturers will have 
more opportunities to sell their prod-
ucts to the Federal Government and 
provide materials for federally funded 
infrastructure projects, including all 
those roads and bridges we will be re-
building. 
I have often said of the farm bill that 
it has Michigan on every page. I have 
got to say this bill comes pretty darned 
close. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, to invest in America, and 
to finally get Infrastructure Week 
translated into action. 
I yield the floor.

DEMNING THE CUBAN REGIME’S 
ACTS 
OF 
REPRESSION, 
AND 
CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE OF ARBITRARILY DE-
TAINED CUBAN CITIZENS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am 
proud to come to the floor today to ask 
for unanimous consent on this bipar-
tisan resolution expressing solidarity 
with the people of Cuba. This resolu-
tion passed out of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee by a voice vote, with 
overwhelming bipartisan support. 
I want to thank the senior Senator 
from Florida for his partnership on this 
resolution, which has the support of 
Senators 
DURBIN, 
KAINE; 
Senator 
RISCH, the ranking member on the For-
eign Relations Committee; as well as 
many others on both sides of the aisle. 
In passing this resolution today, the 
U.S. Senate can send a powerful mes-
sage about the truly historic events oc-
curring in Cuba in recent weeks. 
On July 11, in an unprecedented wave 
of demonstrations across the island, 
the Cuban people peacefully took to 
the streets and raised their voices to 
call for freedom and an end to tyranny. 
We saw the courage of the Cuban peo-
ple. Images of Cubans chanting ‘‘abajo 
la dictadura,’’ which means ‘‘down 
with the dictatorship,’’ and singing 
‘‘Patria y Vida,’’ or ‘‘Fatherland and 
Life,’’ spread around the globe. Yet the 
Diaz-Canel regime responded with an 
authoritarian crackdown and violent 
repression out of fear of losing its iron 
grip over the Cuban people. 
The regime cut the internet to stop 
the Cuban people from accessing social 
media—a tool they were bravely using 
to open the eyes of the world. Who does 
that? Only a country that fears its peo-
ple shuts down the internet. But it was 
too late. The truth went viral. 
The regime has arrested more than 
700 people, and most remain incommu-
nicado. Dozens more are already being 
subjected to summary trials, without 
access to legal defense or even a veneer 
of due process. Human Rights Watch, 
Amnesty International, and the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
have all spoken out against the Cuban 
regime’s campaign of oppression. 
President Biden rightfully and re-
peatedly denounced the regime’s ac-
tions and has announced two rounds of 
Global Magnitsky sanctions on human 
rights 
abusers. 
The 
President 
has 
brought together allies of Cuban free-
dom both at home and abroad. On Fri-
day, the President convened a meeting 
of Cuban-American leaders to discuss 
this crisis and hear our suggestions on 
how to best support the pro-democracy 
efforts underway in Cuba. 
Last 
week, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Blinken led a coalition of 20 countries 
in a joint statement to express inter-
national solidarity with the Cuban peo-
ple and their rights to freedom of ex-
pression, freedom of assembly, freedom 
to determine their own future. 
While important steps are being 
taken, more needs to be done. The 
Cuban people, in this unprecedented 
hour of uncertainty and need, cannot 
afford anything less than our full sup-
port. 
With this resolution, the Senate will 
add its voice to the ongoing efforts and 
reinforce 
U.S. 
solidarity 
with 
the 
Cuban people and their efforts to re-
store democracy and human rights in 
their country. It is the same resolution 
that is also being offered in the House 
of Representatives on the same bipar-
tisan basis. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of Calendar No. 111, 
S. Res. 310; further, that the com-
mittee-reported substitute amendment 
to the resolution be agreed to; the reso-
lution, as amended, be agreed to; the 
preamble be agreed to; and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the resolution (S. Res. 310) ex-
pressing solidarity with Cuban citizens 
demonstrating peacefully for funda-
mental 
freedoms, 
condemning 
the 
Cuban regime’s acts of repression, and 
calling for the immediate release of ar-
bitrarily 
detained 
Cuban 
citizens, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, as follows: 
S. RES. 310 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of 
Cuban citizens took to the streets to peace-
fully protest and to call for respect for basic 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
and the end of the dictatorship in Cuba; 
Whereas the demonstrations were the larg-
est protests witnessed on the island in 25 
years, with courageous Cuban men, women, 
and youth taking to the streets in at least 50 
different cities and towns across every prov-
ince to affirm a deep aspiration for demo-
cratic change and to denounce the regime’s 
corruption; 
Whereas the nationwide protests represent 
the full diversity of Cuban society, with 
demonstrators proudly proclaiming ‘‘Patria 
y Vida!’’ (Homeland and Life!) and calling for 
‘‘libertad’’ (liberty); 
Whereas the demonstrations in Cuba follow 
months of severe shortages of food and basic 
medicine, frequent power outages, record 
high rates of transmission of COVID–19, and 
the Cuban regime’s ineffective response, in 
addition to the Cuban regime’s continued re-
pression and arbitrary imprisonment of citi-
zens, peaceful activists, and artists; 
Whereas, despite the authoritarian re-
gime’s blocking of internet service to pre-
vent the spread of information about the 
demonstrations, Cubans witnessed examples 
of their compatriots demanding change in 
their country and courageously joined the 
growing protests; 
Whereas, despite the peaceful nature of the 
demonstrations, Miguel Dı´az-Canel incited 
violence among Cubans and encouraged his 
supporters to attack peaceful protestors, de-
claring in a televised address, ‘‘the order to 
fight has been given—into the streets’’ and 
pledged his supporters’ lives: ‘‘Over our dead 
bodies. We are prepared to do anything’’; 
Whereas 
Dı´az-Canel 
has 
sought 
to 
delegitimize 
peaceful 
protesters, 
crudely 
stating they constitute a small group of 
‘‘vulgar criminals’’ that are ‘‘paid’’ to be dis-
ruptive; 
Whereas Dı´az-Canel sought to blame the 
endemic problems causing so much human 
suffering by the Cuban people on outside 
forces instead of on the Cuban regime’s long- 
standing corruption, mismanagement, and 
theft of public resources; 
Whereas the Cuban regime’s domestic se-
curity apparatus, including military and po-
lice, were recorded on video violently re-
pressing peaceful Cuban citizens, including 
by using live ammunition and attacking 
journalists; 
Whereas numerous reports indicate deaths 
of and injuries to Cuban protestors at the 
hands of the regime’s security forces, includ-
ing instances of police firing live ammuni-
tion into crowds and at least one docu-
mented police beating that led to a civilian 
death; 
Whereas independent Cuban civil society 
groups have reported that hundreds of indi-
viduals have been arrested, detained, or are 
missing; 
Whereas defying regime repression, contin-
ued internet shutdowns, and illegal searches 
of the homes of activists and protestors, 
Cuban men, women, and youth continued to 
peacefully protest throughout the island on

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today in solidarity with the 
brave Cuban people fighting for free-
dom. For decades, the Cuban people 
suffered 
atrocities, 
oppression, 
and 
misery at the hands of the illegitimate 
communist Castro regime. 
I have repeatedly told the story of 
Sirley Avila Leon, a Cuban woman who 
was attacked by communist Cuban se-
curity forces in 2015. They cut off her 
hand and stuck her arm in the mud to 
make sure it got infected. Her crime? 
She complained that the regime was 
going to shut down a school in her 
neighborhood. 
I have spoken to brave leaders like 
Jose Daniel Ferrer and the courageous 
members of his Patriotic Union of 
Cuba, who are fighting every day to de-
fend human rights, freedom, and the 
democratic movement in Cuba. Jose 
Daniel Ferrer is currently being de-
tained by the communist regime, and 
his family doesn’t know where he is. 
Activists like Jose Daniel Ferrer and 
the artists of the San Isidro Movement 
are the future of Cuba, not the ruthless 
communist regime. 
This is the same communist regime 
that for decades has been the root of 
the instability we see across Latin 
America. The communist Cuban re-
gime props up other dangerous dic-
tators, like Maduro in Venezuela and 
Ortega in Nicaragua, threatening the 
region and the national security of the 
United States. 
What we are seeing now in Cuba 
should send a clear message to the 
world: Communism is a failed ideology 
that does nothing but lead to suffering 
and oppression. Communism doesn’t 
work. Socialism doesn’t work. 
The people of Cuba are crying out for 
freedom. They are denouncing the op-
pressive 
communist 
rule 
that 
has 
brought ruin to their nation for more 
than 60 years. This disgusting assault 
on the people of Cuba cannot go un-
checked. 
I very much appreciate my col-
league’s efforts to condemn the atroc-
ities of the regime, but this resolution 
is missing one thing: These atrocities 
are undeniably linked to communism. 
I stand today to offer a friendly 
amendment 
that 
simply 
condemns 
communism in this resolution, labeling 
the Cuban dictators Diaz-Canel and 
Raul Castro what they are: a ruthless, 
communist Cuban regime. 
In America, we understand the value 
and importance of freedom in our ev-
eryday lives, and it is our duty to sup-
port and stand up for those who are op-
pressed by dictators and denied the 
right to live freely. It is our duty to 
speak the truth about communism. 
I stand proudly with the heroic free-
dom fighters across Cuba who have 
taken to the streets, determined to re-
gain their freedom and put an end to 
the communist Castro dictatorship. 
To the people of Cuba: You are not 
alone. Together, we will defeat com-
munism. 
The freedom of Cuba is closer than 
ever, and we are not going to stop until 
we see a new day of freedom, democ-
racy, and ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ in Cuba. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
important amendment today. There-
fore, I ask that the Senator modify his 
request to include my amendment, 
which is at the desk; that the resolu-
tion, as amended, be agreed to; that 
the preamble, as amended, be agreed 
to; and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I totally 
agree that the Castro regime and its 
prodigy is a communist-socialist dicta-
torship in tyranny. Before the Senator 
was ever in this institution or involved 
with the issue, for 30 years, I have been 
saying exactly that. 
The Senator, however, knows that in 
order to accept an amendment to a res-
olution that has been hotlined in both 
caucuses, this process could not move 
forward. I cannot simply accept the 
amendment. 
I 
would 
have 
to 
go 
through the whole process. And the 
fact of the matter is, I think there is a 
fierce urgency of now. This resolution 
already has the approval of 99 Sen-
ators, and if the Senator were to insist 
on his amendment, the junior Senator 
from Florida would be the only one 
standing in its way. 
This bipartisan resolution is cospon-
sored by 19 Senators. The initiative is 
co-led by Senator RUBIO, the senior 
Senator from Florida, the ranking 
member of the Senate Subcommittee 
on Western Hemisphere affairs. It is 
sponsored by Senator RISCH, the rank-
ing member of the full Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. It is supported by 
Senators 
CRUZ
and 
ROMNEY
and 
HAGERTY, all of them leading Repub-
lican voices on the Foreign Relations 
Committee. With this strong Repub-
lican backing, the Foreign Relations 
Committee passed this resolution last 
Wednesday on a voice vote, with over-
whelming bipartisan support. 
Now, intervening, we have had this 
infrastructure bill, and so we are here 
trying to get this finally done. We have 
an opportunity to act today and send a 
powerful, bipartisan message in sup-
port of the Cuban people and condemn 
the regime’s brutal repression. 
Now, I personally agree with the sen-
timent of the junior Senator from Flor-
ida, but that reality is the reality that

has existed. We are talking about the 
reality today of trying to send a bipar-
tisan, bicameral message. 
This resolution already condemns its 
present Cuban dictator, Miguel Diaz- 
Canel, by name for his direct role in or-
dering a violent crackdown against the 
Cuban people. It also documents the 
massive wave of arrests in Cuba. It de-
nounces in plain language the regime’s 
brutal violence and its use of summary 
trials to arbitrarily sentence protesters 
who have no access to a lawyer. 
So let me be clear. I have led U.S. 
and international efforts to oppose 
Cuba’s communist dictatorship for 30 
years in the Congress, including my 
role in helping create the Cuban De-
mocracy 
Act 
and 
drafting 
the 
LIBERTAD Act. No one in Congress 
has a longer or more unwavering track 
record than I do when it comes to con-
demning the Cuban regime. But this 
resolution is a strong rebuke of the re-
gime’s recent actions, and it also 
achieves the bipartisan opportunity we 
need for Senate approval. 
There comes a time when we have to 
put actions over words. Today, the 
Senate has a chance to act. We should 
not delay another hour in passing this 
resolution, and because that is exactly 
what would happen, I have to object to 
the Senator’s amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, let me 
just read this. All I am saying is, the 
resolution would add ‘‘condemns the 
murderous Communist party of Cuba 
for decades of oppression against the 
Cuban people, the destruction of the 
Cuban economy, and the destructive 
spread of communism in the Western 
Hemisphere.’’ 
I wish my colleague from New Jersey 
would accept my simple but important, 
friendly amendment, but I will consent 
to allowing this resolution to move for-
ward. 
I will always stand proudly with the 
brave people in Cuba, fighting for their 
freedom, and against the brutal com-
munist regime which continues to op-
press them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 310), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate that the Senator from Florida, 
while I share his sentiments, did not 
press forward on insisting on the 
amendment, which would have delayed 
this, and most importantly, I think the 
Cuban people are the ones who are 
going to thank him as well. 
I yield the floor.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to start by wishing our friend and col-
league Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM
a 
speedy recovery. Yesterday, Senator 
GRAHAM shared that he had tested posi-
tive for COVID–19. We are all relieved 
to hear his symptoms are mild, and we 
look forward to seeing him back in the 
Chamber once he recovers. 
I hope everyone at home follows Sen-
ator GRAHAM’s example by getting vac-
cinated. In Senator GRAHAM’s words, 
‘‘[W]ithout vaccination, I am certain I 
would not feel as well as I do now.’’ 
The Delta variant is no joke. COVID– 
19 cases and hospitalizations are surg-
ing across America, and they are surg-
ing the most in those parts of the coun-
try where large numbers of people are 
unvaccinated. 
Over 90 percent of the most recent in-
fections, hospitalizations, and deaths 
are among people who were not vac-
cinated. The good news is, vaccinations 
are starting to trend upward. Thanks 
to the leadership of the President and 
the urging of many health profes-
sionals, as of yesterday, it has been re-
ported that 70 percent of adults have 
received at least one dose of COVID–19 
vaccine. That is an important mile-
stone. Our Nation is slowly, slowly 
headed in the right direction, but we 
need to pick up the pace. 
Experts say that more than 80 per-
cent of the population needs to get vac-
cinated before we can start antici-
pating herd immunity. So please listen 
to my friend Senator GRAHAM’s advice 
and get vaccinated. It will save your 
life as well as the lives of those you 
love. 
DC METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
yesterday we received word that a 
fourth police officer who responded to 
the January 6 insurrection here in the 
Capitol has died by suicide. 
Officer Gunther Hashida was a mem-
ber of the DC Metropolitan Police De-
partment, and he was a hero. I also 
want to note that hours after Officer 
Hashida’s death was announced, the 
Metropolitan Police Department con-
firmed 
that 
another 
officer, 
Kyle 
DeFreytag, died by suicide last month. 
As we all witnessed last week, many 
of the Capitol and Metropolitan Police 
officers who defended us—defended us— 
and the Capitol on January 6 are still 
grappling with the physical and emo-
tional trauma of that day. We have to 
do everything we can to support them, 
from providing access to mental and 
emotional support to ensuring that ev-
eryone who bears responsibility from 
the January 6 insurrection is held ac-
countable. It is my understanding that 
600 people have already been charged 
with wrongdoing for what occurred on 
that day, and many more will be 
charged. 
The supplemental funding package 
that the Senate passed last week was a 
good starting point. To deny what Jan-
uary 6 was about is literally adding in-
sult to injury for those officers—brave 
officers—who defended us. They de-
serve better. They deserve justice, and 
we deserve the truth. 
To the friends and families of Offi-
cers Hashida and DeFreytag, we are so 
sorry for your loss. We grieve with you. 
We will honor their memory. 
To all of the other police officers and 
National Guard members who defended 
the Capitol on January 6, despite what 
you hear from some of the politicians 
in Congress, we thank you, and we ap-
preciate your valor and your sacrifice. 
Earlier this morning, Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and BLUNT introduced a bipar-
tisan resolution to award these heroes 
the Congressional Gold Medal. I am 
proud to support that effort. 
CLEAN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, on one more topic, 
‘‘forever chemicals.’’ It is a phrase that 
sounds ambiguous and ominous. Some 
of these pollutants—known as PFAS 
chemicals—are used in cleaning sup-
plies, 
stain-resistant 
clothing, 
cos-
metics, polishes, waxes, and the kind of 
foam that firefighters use to fight fires. 
And although they have their prac-
tical 
applications, 
these 
‘‘forever 
chemicals’’ present a major problem: 
They don’t go away. They don’t break 
down. Once they are introduced into 
the environment, they stick around 
forever. 
A growing body of research suggests 
that ‘‘forever chemicals’’ are linked to 
a whole host of human health com-
plications: cancer, kidney disease, liver 
damage, birth defects. Sadly, it is esti-
mated that most people already have 
trace amounts of these chemicals in 
their bodies. But imagine if you or 
your children were forced to ingest 
these toxic ‘‘forever chemicals’’ mul-
tiple times a day, every day. That is 
the dangerous reality for many Amer-
ican families. I am sorry to report that 
includes thousands of families in my 
home State of Illinois. 
On Friday, the Chicago Sun Times 
published a story on the presence of 
these chemicals in water systems in 
the Chicago area, Lake Forest, Wau-
kegan, and South Elgin. Water system 
managers in these areas have found 
enough evidence of chemicals that the 
Illinois EPA is calling for further test-
ing. That additional testing is just in 
the preliminary stage. 
As I mentioned, these contaminants 
are 
impressively 
imperishable, 
and 
they are being found everywhere. As an 
example, a few years ago, a dairy farm-
er in Maine discovered that one of 
these ‘‘forever chemicals’’ had seeped 
into his farmland through a fertilizer 
that he used. He only found out be-
cause the chemicals were showing up in

the milk of his cows. He ended up hav-
ing to shut down his dairy farm that 
had been in the family for generations. 
He had to destroy his dairy herd, and 
he lost his savings. 
If these contaminants are too dan-
gerous for a dairy farm, too dangerous 
for cows, they are certainly too dan-
gerous for our kids. We must protect 
our communities and families from 
‘‘forever chemicals’’ immediately. 
Unfortunately, eliminating this pub-
lic health threat is proving chal-
lenging. For one, in Illinois, it is not 
clear where it came from. According to 
the Sun Times article, ‘‘among the 
water system managers contacted by 
the [newspaper], none of them could 
identify the culprit causing the con-
tamination.’’ 
The Environmental Working Group 
has identified more than 1,700 potential 
sources in my State, from sewage 
treatment facilities to landfills. The 
culprit could be any one or a combina-
tion. As of now, there is no definitive 
answer. In other words, the analogy is, 
an arsonist is still running through the 
forest, and the only signs are the trees 
he leaves burning. 
The other difficulty in meeting this 
public health threat is that it costs 
money. As we all learned from Flint, 
MI, repairing and replacing the entire 
city’s drinking water system is no 
small 
task. 
Municipal 
officials 
throughout my State are still waiting 
on State officials to provide guidance, 
as well as funding, to remove these 
‘‘forever chemicals’’ from their water 
system. 
But when it comes to protecting our 
children’s health and well-being, solu-
tions cannot wait, and States like Illi-
nois cannot address this threat on 
their own. Pending before the U.S. Sen-
ate at this moment is the bipartisan 
infrastructure deal. This deal is good 
for us, good for America, and starts to 
address this problem. 
This historic bipartisan plan will 
make our Nation’s largest ever invest-
ment in clean water. That investment 
includes $10 billion for addressing the 
‘‘forever chemical’’ challenge and other 
emerging contaminants from drinking 
water 
and 
wastewater 
systems 
throughout America. That is a big 
deal. It is estimated that more than 200 
million Americans—nearly two-thirds 
of this country’s population—could be 
drinking ‘‘forever chemicals’’ in their 
tap water. 
With the bipartisan infrastructure 
deal, lawmakers on both sides of the 
aisle are coming together as we should, 
to help ensure every family in America 
has access to clean and safe drinking 
water. 
Because 
the 
infrastructure 
package will also invest billions of dol-
lars to replace dangerous decaying lead 
service lines throughout the country, 
it is a game changer. It is a game 
changer for the city of Chicago, which 
I am proud to represent in my home 
State of Illinois. 
You see, there is no acceptable level 
for 
lead 
consumption—none, 
zero. 
Much like ‘‘forever chemicals,’’ lead 
service lines that hookup the water 
main in the street to your home, busi-
ness, 
school, 
daycare 
center—these 
lead service lines can cause lasting 
harm to the growing bodies and minds 
of our kids. And, as lawmakers, we 
have an obligation to correct the mis-
takes made by previous generations of 
Americans. 
I understand that until about 35, 40 
years ago, lead service lines were man-
dated in construction in Illinois—in my 
State—in some areas. We made a mis-
take. Now we know it. What are we 
going to do about it? This bill address-
es this. 
I want to thank my colleague, Sen-
ator 
TAMMY
DUCKWORTH. 
When 
it 
comes to water infrastructure, she is 
just leading the pack in the U.S. Sen-
ate. She really cares about this, as a 
Senator, for sure, but equally impor-
tant as a mom with two lovely little 
girls. 
We can establish a new, healthier 
foundation for future generations if we 
pull together. That is exactly what this 
bill will do. Marshaling the resources 
of our Federal Government so that all 
of America’s kids can grow up and lead 
healthy, productive lives, that is what 
bipartisanship is all about. And I look

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the 
provisions of section 80603 for the Infra-

cluded in this amendment provide clar-
ity to information reporting require-
ments to improve tax administration 
and tax compliance with respect to 
trading and digital assets.

ing the nonpartisan Joint Committee 
on Taxation to make available to the 
public a technical explanation of sec-
tion 80603, ‘‘Information Reporting for 
Brokers and Digital Assets,’’ of the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
The technical explanation expresses 
these Senators’ understanding and leg-
islative intent behind this important 
legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the technical explanation of 
section 80603 from the Joint Committee 
on Taxation of the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF SECTION 
80603, ‘‘INFORMATION REPORTING FOR 
BROKERS AND DIGITAL ASSETS,’’ OF 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
Prepared by the Staff of the Joint 
Committee on Taxation—August 2021 
INFORMATION REPORTING FOR BROKERS AND 
DIGITAL ASSETS 
PRESENT LAW 
In general 
The IRS gathers independent information 
about income received and taxes withheld to 
verify self-reported income and tax liability 
reported on tax returns. The use of reliable 
and objective third-party verification of in-
come increases the probability of tax evasion 
being detected and increases the cost of eva-
sion to the taxpayer, thereby decreasing the 
overall level of tax evasion by taxpayers. 
Ample empirical evidence shows that the in-
troduction of third-party information report-
ing in tax administration leads to more ac-
curate reports of income on tax returns. 
Information reporting assists taxpayers re-
ceiving such reports to prepare their income 
tax returns and helps the IRS determine 
whether such returns are correct and com-
plete. The reporting of most relevance to the 
determination of individual income tax gen-
erally falls under one of two types. First, 
there are reports and disclosures required 
from taxpayers about themselves. Second, 
there are reports required to be reported to 
the IRS with respect to transactions with 
other persons, including employers, known 
as third-party information reporting. Third- 
party information reporting rules had prede-
cessors in early tax statutes. The first third- 
party information reporting requirement in 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amend-
ed, regarding payments by persons engaged 
in a trade or business of $600 or more in the 
course of the payor’s trade or business, is a 
successor to an almost identical provision in 
the 1939 Code, as is the provision requiring 
reporting of dividends and corporate earn-
ings and profits. 
Third-party information reporting has ex-
panded significantly since then, addressing 
numerous types of payments. These include 
reporting with respect to advance payments 
of credit for health insurance costs; gross 
proceeds paid to an attorney; substitute pay-
ments in lieu of dividends or tax-exempt in-
terest; and payments by a Federal executive 
agency for services. Congress continues to 
expand third-party information reporting, 
reflecting the importance of IRS access to 
reliable 
and 
objective 
third-party 
verification of payments in detecting non-
compliance. 
Persons required to submit such returns 
generally must furnish a statement that in-
cludes the information contained on such re-
turn to the person whose information was re-
ported to the IRS. If a reporter prepares 250 
returns or more, the reporter must do so 
electronically. The scope of reporting en-
compasses brokers of a variety of trans-
actions, including securities, real estate, and 
barter transactions, but to date, no regula-
tions under section 6045 have been issued to 
address transactions involving digital assets. 
Broker reporting 
Section 6045(a) requires brokers to file with 
the IRS annual information returns showing 
the gross proceeds realized by customers 
from various sale transactions, when re-
quired by the Secretary to do so. A return 
must provide such details regarding gross 
proceeds realized by customers from various 
sale transactions and other information as 
required by the Secretary. Brokers are re-
quired to furnish to every customer written 
statements with the same gross proceeds in-
formation that is included in the returns

filed with the IRS for that customer. These 
written statements are required to be fur-
nished by February 15 of the year following 
the calendar year for which the return under 
section 6045(a) is required to be filed. 
Because gross proceeds constitute income 
only to the extent that they exceed the sell-
er’s adjusted basis, reliable recordkeeping of 
original basis and necessary adjustments are 
required. In 2008, the reporting requirements 
for brokers were revised to provide that 
every broker that is required to file a return 
under section 6045(a) reporting the gross pro-
ceeds from the sale of a covered security 
must include in the return (1) the customer’s 
adjusted basis in the security and (2) wheth-
er any capital gain or loss with respect to 
the security is long-term or short-term. Spe-
cific rules for determining a customer’s ad-
justed basis are provided. 
Covered securities 
A covered security is any specified security 
acquired on or after an applicable date if the 
security was (1) acquired through a trans-
action in the account in which the security 
is held or (2) transferred to that account 
from an account in which the security was a 
covered security, but only if the transferee 
broker received a statement under section 
6045A (described below) with respect to the 
transfer. Under this rule, certain securities 
acquired by gift or inheritance are not cov-
ered securities. 
A specified security is any share of stock 
in a corporation (including stock of a regu-
lated investment company); any note, bond, 
debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness; 
any commodity, or a contract or a derivative 
with respect to the commodity, if the Sec-
retary determines that adjusted basis report-
ing is appropriate; and any other financial 
instrument with respect to which the Sec-
retary determines that adjusted basis report-
ing is appropriate. 
For stock in a corporation (other than 
stock for which an average basis method is 
permissible under section 1012), the applica-
ble date of section 6045(g) is January 1, 2011. 
For any stock for which an average basis 
method is permissible under section 1012, the 
applicable date is January 1, 2012. Con-
sequently, the applicable date for certain 
stock acquired through a dividend reinvest-
ment plan and for stock in a regulated in-
vestment company is January 1, 2012. A regu-
lated investment company is permitted to 
elect to treat as a covered security any stock 
in the company acquired before January 1, 
2012. For any specified security other than 
stock in a corporation or stock for which an 
average basis method is permitted, the appli-
cable date is January 1, 2013, or a later date 
determined by the Secretary. Consequently, 
for a note, bond, debenture, or other evi-
dence of indebtedness, or for a commodity or 
a contract or derivative with respect to the 
commodity, or for any other financial in-
strument treated as a specified security, the 
applicable date is January 1, 2013, or a later 
date determined by the Secretary. 
Time for providing statements to customers 
February 15 of the year following the cal-
endar year reporting period is the deadline 
for furnishing certain written statements to 
customers, including (1) statements showing 
gross proceeds (under section 6045(b)) or sub-
stitute payments (under section 6045(d)) and 
(2) statements with respect to reportable 
items (including, but not limited to, inter-
est, dividends, and royalties) that are fur-
nished with consolidated reporting state-
ments (as defined in regulations). The term 
‘‘consolidated reporting statement’’ refers to 
annual account statements that brokerage 
firms customarily provide to their customers 
and that include tax-related information. 
To enable brokers to comply with these re-
quirements, 
section 
6045A 
provides 
for 
broker-to-broker reporting under which a 
broker or applicable person within the scope 
of section 6045 that transfers to a broker a 
security that is a covered security when held 
by that transferor broker must furnish to 
the transferee broker a written statement 
that allows the transferee broker to satisfy 
the basis and holding period reporting re-
quirements under section 6045. Section 6045B 
requires the issuer of a covered security to 
file a return describing any organizational 
action (such as a stock split or a merger or 
acquisition) that affects the basis of the 
specified security, the quantitative effect on 
the basis of that specified security, and any 
other information required by the Secretary, 
and to provide copies of that return to hold-
ers of specified securities and nominees like 
brokers. 
Penalties for failure to comply with information 
reporting requirements 
A person who is required to file informa-
tion returns but who fails to do so by the due 
date for the returns, includes on the returns 
incorrect information, or files incomplete re-
turns generally is subject to a penalty of $250 
for each return with respect to which such a 
failure occurs, up to a maximum of $3,000,000 
in any calendar year, adjusted for inflation. 
Similar penalties, also with a $3,000,000 cal-
endar-year maximum, apply to failures to 
furnish correct written statements to recipi-
ents of payments for which information re-
porting is required. Brokers may be subject 
to such penalties for failure to file the re-
turns required under section 6045, or for fail-
ure to provide statements to others as re-
quired by section 6045A. 
Cash received in trade or business 
Section 6050I requires any person engaged 
in a trade or business to report any trans-
action (or two or more related transactions) 
in which the person receives more than 
$10,000 in cash. For this purpose, cash in-
cludes foreign currency and, to the extent 
provided by the Secretary, any monetary in-
strument (whether or not in bearer form) 
with a face amount of not more than $10,000. 
Returns required under section 6050I parallel 
reports required from merchants and serv-
ices providers under the Bank Secrecy Act. 
Failure to file such returns and failure to 
provide customers with copies of such re-
turns are subject to the penalties under sec-
tions 6721 and 6722, respectively. 
Current guidance on digital assets 
Most of the statutory provisions requiring 
third-party information reporting predate 
the advent of digital assets and none ex-
pressly addresses its treatment. In 2014, the 
IRS published its first guidance on digital 
assets in a Notice in the form of frequently 
asked questions. The Notice refers to ‘‘vir-
tual currency,’’ defined as property that is 
‘‘a digital representation of value that func-
tions as a medium of exchange, a unit of ac-
count, and/or a store of value.’’ The Notice 
further identifies a subset of virtual cur-
rency (‘‘convertible virtual currency’’) as the 
only digital asset within the scope of the 
guidance. The Notice defines convertible vir-
tual currency as virtual currency which has 
an equivalent value in real currency or acts 
as a substitute for real currency. 
The Notice stated that ‘‘a payment made 
using virtual currency is subject to informa-
tion reporting to the same extent as any 
other payment made in property.’’ The No-
tice refers to the need for reporting on a 
Form 1099–MISC, Miscellaneous Income, if a 
payment of fixed and determinable income is 
made in the course of a trade or business 
using convertible virtual currency with a 
fair market value of $600 or more. This re-
quirement parallels the requirements under 
section 6041 and the regulatory guidance 
thereunder, which provide that payments 
made in property rather than money must be 
reported by including the fair market value 
of the property paid. As the use of digital as-
sets has developed, the G–7 Finance min-
isters have committed to developing com-
mon standards and principles to guide the 
public policy and regulatory issues, while 
recognizing the potential benefits of the 
market. 
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION 
The provision amends section 6045(c)(1) so 
that the definition of broker expressly in-
cludes any person who (for consideration) is 
responsible for regularly providing any serv-
ice effectuating transfers of digital assets on 
behalf of another person. The change clari-
fies present law to resolve uncertainty over 
whether certain market participants are bro-
kers. The change is not intended to limit the 
Secretary’s authority to interpret the defini-
tion of broker. 
In addition, the provision specifies that the 
definition of specified security includes a 
digital asset, which, except as provided by 
the Secretary, is defined as any digital rep-
resentation of value which is recorded on a 
cryptographically secured distributed ledger 
or any similar technology as specified by the 
Secretary. A digital asset acquired through a 
broker on or after January 1, 2023, is a cov-
ered security subject to basis reporting 
under section 6045(g). 
In section 6045A(a), the provision strikes 
the words ‘‘a security which is’’ which makes 
clear that broker-to-broker reporting applies 
to all transfers of covered securities within 
the meaning of section 6045(g)(3), including 
digital assets. The provision also adds new 
section 6045A(d), which generally applies to 
transfers by a broker to a person that is not 
a broker. Section 6045A(d) requires a broker 
to file a return with the IRS for a calendar 
year, with respect to any transfer (which is 
not part of a sale or exchange executed by 
the broker) during the calendar year of a 
covered security which is a digital asset 
from an account maintained by the broker to 
an account which is not maintained by, or an 
address not associated with, a person that 
the broker knows or has reason to know is 
also a broker. The return will be in such 
form as determined by the Secretary, show-
ing the information otherwise required to be 
furnished with respect to transfers subject to 
section 6045A(a). 
The reporting requirement in new section 
6045A(d) is limited to transfers that are not 
otherwise subject to reporting under section 
6045 (because those transactions are already 
reported to the IRS, for example, in the case 
of a transfer that is part of a sale effectuated 
by a broker) or under section 6045A(a) (be-
cause those transactions are already re-
ported to transferee brokers, for example, in 
the case of a direct broker-to-broker transfer 
of a digital asset). The return required under 
the provision is added to the definition of in-
formation return for purposes of section 6724 
and related failure to file penalties under 
section 6721. 
The provision expands the definition of 
cash solely for purposes of section 6050I to 
include any digital asset (as defined under 
amended section 6045(g)(3)). No inference is 
intended that digital assets are treated as 
cash for any other purpose. 
Nothing in the provision or the amend-
ments made by the provision is to be con-
strued to create any inference, for any period 
prior to the effective date of the amend-
ments, with respect to whether any person is 
a broker under section 6045(c)(l) or whether 
any digital asset is property which is a speci-
fied security under section 6045(g)(3)(B). 
EFFECTIVE DATE 
The provision applies to returns required 
to be filed, and statements required to be 
furnished, after December 31, 2023.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MS–13 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor because I am greatly 
concerned as to whether the Depart-
ment of Justice is committed to fight-
ing the violent crime committed by the 
gang known as MS–13. 
MS–13 is a violent gang that operates 
on the streets of the United States and 
throughout Mexico and Central Amer-
ica. MS–13’s informal motto is—can 
you believe this—‘‘kill, steal, rape, and 
control.’’ 
Under the Trump administration, the 
Department established a task force to 
fight the murders and other serious 
crimes committed by MS–13 gang mem-
bers, but the Department of Justice 
hasn’t released any news or updates on 
this task force, called Task Force Vul-
can, since way back on January 14 of 
this 
year. 
Right 
before 
President 
Biden’s inauguration is when that Jan-
uary 14 date was. So you can see we 
haven’t seen anything since this Presi-
dent has been sworn in. So we have no 
idea what the Department of Justice is 
doing to combat MS–13. 
From 2017 to 2020, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection found or arrested 
over 3 million people, averaging about 
750,000 people a year. In that same time 
period, Border Patrol apprehended an 
average of 294 MS–13 gang members 
every year. 
This year, however, Customs and 
Border Protection has already encoun-
tered or arrested over 1.2 million, well 
above the previous averages. But, this 
year, Customs and Border Protection 
has only apprehended 71 MS–13 mem-
bers trying to enter the United States, 
suggesting 
many 
dangerous 
MS–13 
gang members are successfully sneak-
ing past Border Patrol as agents are fo-
cused on dealing with unaccompanied 
children at the border or asylum seek-
ers. 
One Border Patrol chief in Laredo 
stated that MS–13 members are using 
the high number of migrants entering 
the United States to blend in and get 
past agents. We know MS–13 is still 
trying to sneak into the country; how-
ever, they are just more successful 
now. 
Customs and Border Protection is 
still arresting MS–13 members when 
they can identify them. In April alone, 
Customs and Border Protection ar-
rested an MS–13 member who was a 
convicted felon with an outstanding 
warrant and one female MS–13 member 
traveling with a convicted murderer. 
Here, next to the Capitol, police in 
Maryland arrested an MS–13 member 
after he lured a 15-year-old girl into an 
apartment and tried to rape her. 
So even if Border Patrol agents in 
the field and local police are doing 
their best to stop MS–13, we still don’t 
know what the Department of Justice 
is 
doing 
about 
MS–13 
since 
they 
haven’t released any updates on Task 
Force Vulcan since January. We don’t 
even know if Task Force Vulcan still 
exists. This is a problem because we 
know MS–13 is ruthlessly operating on 
American streets. 
Congress and the American people 
deserve to know what the Department 
of Justice is doing to keep our streets 
safe and to keep us safe from dangerous 
criminal organizations like MS–13. So I 
will be seeking answers to this ques-
tion from the Department of Justice. It 
is a pretty basic question: Do you have 
anything to update the American peo-
ple about? We should know what the 
status of all this is. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
President Biden and his allies in Con-
gress are champing at the bit to grease 
the wheels for a partisan $3.5 trillion 
spending spree before they leave for the 
August break. At a time when our na-
tional debt is set to exceed levels not 
seen since World War II, this is not 
only irresponsible, but dangerous. 
Hard-working Americans are already 
paying the price for excess spending in 
the form of inflation, with prices rising 
throughout 
the 
economy. 
And, 
of 
course, poll after poll shows Americans 
are becoming increasingly concerned 
about inflation. 
Instead of adding to these concerns 
in the pursuit of wish-list priorities, 
Congress should focus on addressing 
the real priorities of the American peo-
ple. For instance, we should be taking 
action to address the crisis at our 
southern border. In June, U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection encountered 
188,000 people. That is up 471 percent 
from the same time last year. 
As a result of the Biden administra-
tion’s irresponsible immigration poli-
cies, Customs and Border Protection 
has encountered over 1.1 million illegal

August 3, 2021 
immigrants at the southern border dur-
ing this fiscal year. That is five times 
larger than the population of Iowa’s 
capital city, Des Moines. 
The crisis is undeniable. The Senate 
Democrats are trying hard to deny it. 
Instead of taking action to secure our 
borders and deter illegal immigration, 
Senate Democrats are attempting to 
use a reckless tax-and-spending bill to 
offer amnesty to millions of illegal im-
migrants living in the United States. 
It is deeply irresponsible. It will only 
encourage more of this illegal immi-
gration, and it will only make the bor-
der crisis worse. 
Illegal immigration isn’t the only 
crime cascading over the border. Mexi-
can cartels are pouring record high 
amounts of hard drugs—methamphet-
amine, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl— 
across the border with impunity. 
Fentanyl has become the choice drug 
because it is highly potent and, of 
course, highly profitable, particularly 
for the cartels. A tiny amount, even as 
small as a grain of salt, can result in 
an overdose and, of course, in death. 
Fentanyl is increasingly laced into 
other drugs, which heightens potency, 
often without the user even knowing 
it. 
In 2020, over 93,000 Americans died 
from drug overdoses. That is almost 
the entire population of Davenport, IA. 
The primary driver of this surge in 
overdose deaths is fentanyl coming in 
from Mexico. Instead of working on 
curbing cartels at the border and cut-
ting off their extensive power in the 
United 
States, 
Senate 
Democrats 
choose to bury their heads in the sand 
and pretend that fentanyl isn’t deadly. 
The border crisis is, then, very obvi-
ously a drug crisis. 
And on top of that, police depart-
ments across the country are still hav-
ing a hard time getting enough offi-
cers. Violent crime is soaring. Homi-
cide rates are through the roof. 
Iowa families don’t redecorate their 
houses when the plumbing is leaking. 
These issues are dinner table issues. 
So Congress must focus on them, in-
stead of on reckless and partisan 
spending proposals that are going on in 
the U.S. Senate now by the majority 
party. 
TAXPAYER INFORMATION 
Mr. President, in the past few weeks, 
there has been a lot of talk about in-
creasing IRS enforcement to bring in 
more money to the government. That 
would be fine if we could trust the IRS 
to keep taxpayer information safe and 
secure and actually using that infor-
mation to enforce the Tax Code. 
Now, unfortunately, that notion is 
waffling on pretty shaky ground at this 
very moment. 
In June, the nonprofit journalism 
web page ProPublica began publishing 
stories that appear to contain con-
fidential taxpayer information that 
might have come from the IRS. Unfor-
tunately, attention is focused more on 
the private tax affairs of the victims of 
these actions than on the apparently 
illegal actions taken to produce the 
data that forms the basis of these 
ProPublica stories. 
By law, the confidentiality of tax-
payer information is sacrosanct. That 
comes from section 6103 of the Tax 
Code, a section that was put in law in 
the 1970s, I believe, to see that what 
Nixon did to use the IRS to go after his 
enemies never happened again. 
So why is this information sac-
rosanct? Because a Federal income tax 
return contains some of the most sen-
sitive information that there is about 
our fellow Americans. A tax return is 
essentially a blueprint for how families 
and individuals live their lives. Aside 
from detailing where and how tax-
payers support themselves and earn 
money, tax returns potentially detail 
what charities, including even reli-
gious institutions, that a taxpayer sup-
ports. Tax returns can also detail 
where and how they take care of their 
children, their medical status, and lots 
of other deeply personal information. 
In part to promote tax compliance, 
Congress decided that in exchange for 
collecting sensitive information needed 
to enforce the Internal Revenue Code, 
the IRS must treat this information 
carefully and protect it from unauthor-
ized access and disclosure. That is what 
section 6103 is all about. It carries with 
it significant criminal and civil pen-
alties for any violations of those terms. 
Nevertheless, the ProPublica stories 
published in a series entitled ‘‘The Se-
cret IRS Files Inside the Tax Records 
of the .001%’’ are plainly derived from 
the confidential taxpayer information. 
The folks in charge of enforcing the 
Tax Code quickly recognized that they 
had a big problem here. That very 
morning, IRS Commissioner Rettig was 
testifying before the Senate Finance 
Committee and said that he appre-
ciated the confidential nature of the 
information collected by the IRS and 
how very important it is that people 
are able to trust the IRS with that in-
formation. 
Commissioner Rettig isn’t the only 
Treasury official to express that con-
cern. When asked about this apparent 
abuse of taxpayer information at the 
Finance Committee hearing on the 
President’s fiscal 2022 budget request, 
held on June 16, Treasury Secretary 
Yellen said she agreed the situation 
was very serious and that the matter 
had been referred to the Justice De-
partment. 
The week before, appearing before a 
different Senate Committee, Attorney 
General Garland also said this was a 
very serious matter and that people are 
entitled to the privacy regarding their 
tax information. 
I agree with Commissioner Rettig, 
Secretary Yellen, and Attorney Gen-
eral Garland that the apparent leak of 
confidential information is a very seri-
ous issue. 
For one thing, we don’t know exactly 
where the information came from. Was 
it a leak? Was it a hack? We don’t seem 
to know. We also don’t know the full 
scope of the information at risk. 
According to ProPublica, it has ‘‘ob-
tained a vast trove of Internal Revenue 
Service data on the tax returns of 
thousands of the Nation’s wealthiest 
people, covering more than 15 years.’’ 
Let me say that again. ProPublica 
claims that it has thousands of tax re-
turns. 
Americans know the risk of having 
their private information unsecured in 
the wind. They know the risk, for ex-
ample, of fraud and identity theft. And, 
of course, Nixon’s political enemies 
knew the risk of letting the IRS run 
loose. 
According to the most recent IRS 
Electronic Tax Administration Advi-
sory Committee Annual Report to Con-
gress, issued in June of 2021, 185,000 
identity theft affidavits were filed with 
the IRS in 2020. The report also notes 
that due to pandemic relief, higher lev-
els of identity theft are expected dur-
ing the 2021 filing season. 
Sure, in this case, ProPublica has de-
cided that the wealthiest individuals 
are the ones worth targeting. But 
again, we don’t know the full scope of 
the information that is at risk. Maybe 
you are not the owner of a sports team 
or the head of a multinational com-
pany or haven’t built a vehicle in 
which you have recently traveled to 
outer space. The unauthorized access 
and disclosure of taxpayer information 
should be a concern to all taxpayers. If 
someone can expose the most private 
and sensitive information of the Na-
tion’s wealthiest citizens, they can do 
it to anyone. 
Regardless of what anyone thinks 
about the known victims of this disclo-
sure, no one should be absolutely con-
fident that their information hasn’t 
been compromised. 
As soon as the apparent disclosure of 
taxpayer information was known, I 
pressed authorities in the executive 
branch to take action. I questioned 
Commissioner Rettig about it during 
the Finance Committee hearing that 
very day. Three days later, I sent a let-
ter with Leader MCCONNELL and Fi-
nance Ranking Member CRAPO. I sent 
this letter with those two individuals 
to Attorney General Garland and FBI 
Director 
Christopher 
Wray, 
asking 
them to take action on this very im-
portant matter. 
In part, the letter reads: 
Find those responsible for these disclosures 
and ensure they are punished as directed by 
law. Unless you do, ordinary Americans will 
fall victim to these politicalized and crimi-
nal disclosures, and trust in the IRS and our 
tax system will continue to erode. 
That is the end of the quote of the 
letter I sent with Leader MCCONNELL 
and Finance Ranking Member CRAPO. 
On the same day, I joined every other 
Republican on the Finance Committee 
on a letter to the Treasury inspector 
general for the Tax Administration, 
asking for an immediate investigation. 
Following 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Yellen’s June 16 appearance before the

questions asked pretty simple ques-
tions about the scope of the leak and 
the hack and whether or not anyone 
with advanced knowledge of the first 
ProPublica piece had reached out to 
the Treasury or to the IRS. 
On June 16, I sent a letter to Attor-
ney General Garland and FBI Director 
Wray, with other Judiciary Committee 
Republicans, seeking a briefing and a 
confirmation that the FBI or the De-
partment of Justice is investigating. 
Now, as usual, I have not received a 
single response to any of my written 
inquiries. 
There appears to be a massive flaw 
somewhere in our system of tax admin-
istration. Our job, through constitu-
tional oversight, is to determine ex-
actly what this situation is, how it 
happened, and how we can fix it. 
Unfortunately, it appears that some 
are using the apparent illegal disclo-
sure of taxpayer information and the 
violation of taxpayer rights to advance 
a 
partisan 
agenda. 
That 
probably 
doesn’t surprise a lot of people, that 
politics would be involved in this. 
It is important to note that the 
ProPublica pieces aren’t talking about 
tax evasion but, generally, tax avoid-
ance, which is a legal minimization of 
taxes owed. 
On June 24, ProPublica published a 
story about Roth IRAs, using the infor-
mation of a wealthy tech investor. The 
purpose of this story was to show that 
this investor ‘‘and other ultrawealthy 
investors have used them to amass vast 
untaxed fortunes.’’ 
The next day, on June 5, ProPublica 
published a story highlighting a senior 
Democratic Senator’s legislation in-
tended to crackdown on large Roth 
IRA accounts, the same type of ac-
counts criticized in the previous day’s 
articles. 
And you are talking about abuse of 
Roth IRAs? It is in the law. 
A different ProPublica story seemed 
intended to wield private taxpayer in-
formation to affect the outcome of an 
election. 
Now, listen to this. On June 16, 
ProPublica published a story con-
taining taxpayer information of a can-
didate in the Democratic primary to be 
the next district attorney of Manhat-
tan. It seems to me like somebody is 
using political things to hurt people in 
their own political party. 
Given how concerned many of my 
colleagues have been about potential 
election interference, I am really very 
shocked that this story completely 
missed their attention. 
If a candidate’s confidential, legally 
protected information is somehow dis-
closed less than a week before an elec-
tion, especially when we don’t know 
the ultimate source of the confidential 
information or how it was even ob-
tained, shouldn’t that raise a red flag 
to a lot of people in this town or does 
it only matter depending upon who the 
candidate is? 
Finally, 
I 
want 
to 
address 
ProPublica’s role in this situation. 
Although they may be very well-in-
tentioned, in my opinion, they are fa-
cilitating an abuse of power by pub-
lishing stolen confidential information 
of individual citizens who are, by all 
appearances, 
complying 
with 
their 
legal obligations. They think they are 
informing the public of information 
they need to know. They are really 
telling the public that their tax return 
information is not private. That could 
have serious consequences for the prop-
er administration of our tax laws that 
are based on the proposition that peo-
ple are going to give honest, correct in-
formation because they know it is 
going to be public and because they 
owe taxes and they are honest people. 
Plainly, this isn’t about tax cheats 
who broke the law; it is about certain 
people not paying what ProPublica 
thinks they should pay regardless if 
they are paying every dollar that the 
law requires that they pay. So it is 
really about promoting changes to tax 
law that ProPublica and certain Mem-
bers of this body would support. The 
identity of specific taxpayers that we 
know have had their information vio-
lated is not an excuse. 
The notion that taxpayers’ informa-
tion—every taxpayer’s information— 
should be protected is not a view only 
held by this Senator. I have quoted the 
Treasury Secretary; I have quoted the 
Attorney General—all holding that 
same view. 
The use of this information to ad-
vance partisan objectives and, appar-
ently, to influence an election should 
concern all of us. We need to get to the 
bottom of what happened. We need to 
know what taxpayer information is at 
risk, how many taxpayers have been 
compromised, and then determine what 
we can do going forward. 
So I implore Secretary Yellen and 
Attorney General Garland to respond 
to my questions and my letters so that 
we can get on with our very important 
work. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL LOBSTER DAY 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I am begin-
ning my comments with my mask on 
for a very specific reason. If you can 
tell what is populating the mask, they 
are America’s favorite crustacean: the 
North American lobster. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 335, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 335) designating Sep-
tember 25, 2021, as ‘‘National Lobster Day’’. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. KING. I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 335) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the adoption of this resolution. 
The American lobster, the North 
American lobster, is a staple, an iconic 
product of the State of Maine. It sup-
ports our coastal economy; it produces 
well over $1 billion a year of economic 
activity; and it supports thousands of 
families along the coast of Maine. 
Some people occasionally refer to the 
lobster industry, but in reality it is a 
series of small, sole proprietorship 
businesses. Almost all lobsters are 
caught on boats owned by individual 
owners, with, perhaps, what we call a 
sternman on board, but it is a series of, 
as I say, small, independently owned 
businesses, and that is one of the 
things that is so special about this in-
dustry. 
So it is a treat for me to be able to 
move this resolution, to have it agreed 
upon unanimously by the U.S. Senate. 
September 25, 2021, will officially be 
National Lobster Day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2354 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to start by thanking some 
of our colleagues—Senators ROUNDS, 
ERNST, and KELLY—for cosponsoring 
the provisions of this amendment, and 
thank the chairman and ranking mem-
ber of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, Senators CARPER 
and CAPITO, for their support as well. 
I also want to acknowledge the good 
work of our House colleague, Congress-
man STEVE
LYNCH, on championing 
this issue. 
So what is this amendment about? It 
is a commonsense amendment to en-
sure that as we work on a bipartisan 
basis to modernize our infrastructure 
for the 21st century, we also work to-
gether to ensure that new infrastruc-
ture projects that flow from this bill 
and others are financed securely. 
Most Federal projects are financed 
securely by law. Most require some

kind of surety bond. That has been the 
case for almost 100 years in this coun-
try. But because of an odd and old loop-
hole, 
public-private 
infrastructure 
partnerships, or P3 projects, often do 
not maintain the same level of protec-
tion that has been required for public 
infrastructure projects over time. That 
can spell disaster for subcontractors, 
for workers, for taxpayers, and for the 
success of projects that are not so se-
cure. 
We know that contractor defaults 
can cause costly delays, waste tax-
payer money, and leave residents and 
local stakeholders and project workers 
in the lurch. In fact, one developer de-
faulted on a P3 project in Indiana and 
left subcontractors without pay and 
left taxpayers on the hook for over $300 
million in additional project costs. 
This 
amendment 
simply 
requires 
that P3 projects using TIFIA financ-
ing—that is Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Finance and Innovation Act fi-
nancing—be secured with a surety 
bond. That way, in the event a con-
tractor defaults, the protections by 
that bond ensure the completion of 
those projects. They protect taxpayers, 
and they ensure that workers and sub-
contractors and suppliers are paid for 
their work. 
Not surprisingly, this effort is sup-
ported by a broad coalition of organiza-
tions, including the American Sub-
contractors Association, the National 
Association of Minority Contractors, 
and a wide range of other contractors, 
because it will ensure that they are 
paid for the work they do, and it will 
also protect taxpayers who otherwise 
are left in the lurch if a contractor 
goes belly up and we do not have the 
protection of this kind of surety bond. 
That is why this amendment has broad 
bipartisan support, and I urge its adop-
tion. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2354 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise in support of the amendment of-
fered by my old friend, the Senator 
from Maryland—my neighbor, Senator 
VAN
HOLLEN—and 
also 
my 
young 
friend, Senator ERNST, and maybe one 
or two others that I am not aware of. 
The amendment offered by our col-
leagues requires public-private part-
nership projects that receive loans 
from USDOT to obtain something 
called surety bonds. Surety bonds are a 
proven tool for ensuring that a loan re-
cipient has appropriate payment and 
performance protections in place. 
By 
requiring 
these 
bonds, 
this 
amendment would protect workers, 
would protect suppliers, and guarantee 
that any subcontractors, suppliers, and 
workers would receive the payment 
they deserve for their work on the 
project, even if the borrower were to 
default. 
The legislation is based on bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation that is sup-
ported by a dozen organizations, in-
cluding associations that represent the 
interests 
of 
minority-owned 
and 
woman-owned small businesses. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield to my colleague, the ranking 
member of the EPW Committee. I just 
want to say how pleased I am with the 
progress we have made today. A lot of 
amendments were offered and consid-
ered. We had the opportunity to vote 
on them, accept some, some not ac-
cepted. But the spirit was good. There 
is a good spirit in here. And I think if 
most people around the country who 
think we never can work together and 
get anything done had a chance to see 
the way this place worked today, they 
would feel better about this democ-
racy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
want to thank the sponsors of the Van 
Hollen-Rounds amendment, and I am in 
full support of this bipartisan amend-
ment. As the chairman explained that 
public-private 
partnerships 
under 
TIFIA would be backed by the surety 
bond, which would mean that, in the 
event of a contractor default, the 
projects could still be completed, sub-
contractors and workers paid, and tax-
payer investments protected. It sounds 
like a good commonsense amendment, 
and I am fully in support. 
I would also like to say that the 
progress we had today is more than en-
couraging. We are all, I think, very ex-
cited about the prospects of what the 
improvements that this bill will make 
to our transportation and energy sec-
tors and just the guts of our country in 
terms of the physical infrastructure. 
With that, I yield the floor.

75th ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH 
Mr. REED. Madam President, on be-
half of Senator INHOFE and myself, as 
the ranking member and chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
we rise to commemorate and celebrate 
the Office of Naval Research and its 
contributions to our Sea Services, na-
tional defense, and the advancement of 
scientific and technological discovery 
on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. 
World 
War 
II 
underscored 
how 
science and technology could deter-
mine winners and losers on the battle-
field. In the aftermath of the war, Con-
gress established the Office of Naval 
Research on August 1, 1946, to ‘‘plan, 
foster, and encourage scientific re-
search in recognition of its paramount 
importance as related to the mainte-
nance of future naval power, and the 
preservation of national security.’’ 
Since then, the Office of Naval Re-
search has been at the forefront of 
groundbreaking research that has re-
sulted in lasting military supremacy 
not only on and in the seas, but also in 
the skies, on land, and in space. Its 
model of effective collaboration be-
tween military, government, academic, 
and industry entities also paved the 
way for further technological advance-
ment, recreated not only in the other 
military services but also through Na-
tional 
Science 
Foundation 
and 
DARPA. Put simply, its impact is seen 
and felt not only in our Armed Forces, 
but in the lives of all Americans. 
In its earliest days, the Office of 
Naval Research pioneered key fields of 
computing and directed energy. The of-
fice brought humans to the highest 
heights and the deepest depths, and its 
work led to some of the most con-
sequential technological advancements 
of the 20th century, including: the 
laser; Project Whirlwind, one of the 
first digital computers; the first auton-
omous robot; and the atomic clock, 
which made precision satellite naviga-
tion possible. The invention of vir-
tually every important sensor and un-
dersea vehicle that has allowed us to 
explore and better understand our vast 
oceans is a result of the stewardship of 
the Office of Naval Research. 
Moreover, nearly every platform used 
by the Navy and Marine Corps relies in 
some way on technology developed or 
advanced by the Office of Naval Re-
search. From lifesaving medical ad-
vances such as QuikClot, to more le-
thal and effective ships and weapons, 
the Office of Naval Research has 
changed the way we fight and win wars. 
The Office of Naval Research will con-
tinue to shape the future as well; its 
programs are continuously advancing 
the fields of artificial intelligence, au-
tonomous weaponry, networking, di-
rected energy, warfighter performance, 
maritime awareness, and next-genera-
tion power. 
We are proud to honor the achieve-
ments of the Office of Naval Research, 
and we hope the Members of the Senate 
will join us in recognizing the incred-
ible innovation and scientific leader-
ship this distinguished organization 
has provided not only to our sailors, 
marines, soldiers, airmen, and guard-
ians, but also to the American people 
over the past 75 years.

REMEMBERING IAN F. FERGUSSON 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President I rise 
today to remember and honor Ian F. 
Fergusson, Specialist in International 
Trade and Finance in the Foreign Af-
fairs, Defense and Trade Division of the 
Congressional Research Service, CRS. 
Ian passed away on Thursday, June 17, 
after a brief serious illness that unfor-
tunately struck at the height of a dis-
tinguished career of more than 20 years 
at CRS, serving Congress on inter-
national trade and economic policy 
issues. 
Ian exemplified the very best of CRS 
during his years of direct support for 
Congress. He achieved a remarkable 
record of accomplishment through his 
many 
reports, 
confidential 
memo-
randa, committee prints, and confiden-
tial consultative work for Members and 
congressional staff. Ian played a vital 
role in Congress’s consideration of im-
portant legislation, including on export

lan’s authoritative, nonpartisan, and 
objective expertise and analysis for 
Congress, including his deep knowledge 
of U.S.-Canada economic relations, the 
World Trade Organization—WTO—and 
global trading system, and U.S. trade 
agreements. His institutional knowl-
edge of U.S. trade policy and export 
controls was invaluable, especially to 
the Senate Finance and Senate Bank-
ing Committees and its members. The 
breadth and depth of Ian’s institutional 
and policy expertise will be truly 
missed as Congress continues work on 
these important issues. 
I offer my sincere condolences to 
Ian’s family, friends, and his colleagues 
at CRS during this difficult time and 
hope they may take comfort in the 
knowledge of his indelible contribution 
to the work of Congress on inter-
national trade and economic policy. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I also 
rise today to recognize the service of 
Ian Fergusson and his contribution to 
a deeper understanding of trade law 
and policy. 
For decades, Ian provided comprehen-
sive and detailed reports on economic 
history, trade policy, and key legisla-
tive authorities. He worked on every-
thing from Canada to the World Trade 
Organization to access to medicine. Ian 
was instrumental in assisting me and 
my staff on numerous occasions as we 
examined congressional delegation of 
trade authorities, such as TPA, and the 
workings of multilateral institutions, 
such as the WTO. He also provided 
clear and concise information to sup-
port debates on the merits and imple-
mentation of U.S. trade agreements, 
including the South Korea—U.S. Free 
Trade Agreement and USMCA and the 
proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership— 
TPP—agreement. 
I join my colleague in offering my 
sincere condolences to Ian’s family, 
friends, and his colleagues at CRS and 
will continue to think of them during 
this difficult time.

TETON COUNTY, WYOMING, 
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today in recognition of the 100th 
anniversary of the formation of Teton 
County, WY. 
On Sunday, August 29, 2021, Teton 
County will come together in honor of 
this milestone with a 100th anniversary 
picnic celebration. The day will include 
barbequed food, lawn games, live music 
performances, children’s activities, and 
exhibits of Teton County’s historical 
photos and artifacts. This event pro-
vides an exceptional opportunity to 
demonstrate and celebrate Teton Coun-
ty’s strong, remarkable character. 
Teton County was established by an 
act of the Wyoming Legislature and 
signed into law by Governor Robert D. 
Carey on February 18, 1921. The area 
was initially part of neighboring Lin-
coln County. Residents grew weary of 
travelling over 200 miles to the Lincoln 
County seat: Kemmerer, WY. Travel 
was often impossible in the winter as 
snowy roads were closed, leaving the 
residents of now Teton County com-
pletely isolated. 
One of the chief proponents of the ef-
fort to carve out Teton County was 
Wyoming legislator W.C. Deloney. In 
January 1920, Representative Deloney 
introduced a bill in the legislature es-
tablishing an independent county he 
then called ‘‘Jackson Hole County.’’ To 
select the county seat, a vote was held 
between the communities of Jackson 
and Kelly. Though Jackson seems like 
the logical seat today, the landscape 
was very different in 1920. Of 826 votes 
cast, Jackson won by only 22 votes. 
The first three Jackson Hole County 
Commissioners, T.R. Wilson of Alta; 
W.P. Redmond of Kelly; and Peter 
Christofferson—P.C.—Hansen of Jack-
son were appointed. This was the be-
ginning of a legacy of civic service for 
the Hansen family. P.C. Hansen was 
the father of U.S. Senator Cliff P. Han-
sen and the great-grandfather of Wyo-
ming Governor Matt Mead. 
Today, Teton County boasts four 
communities, Jackson being the larg-
est with more than 10,500 residents led 
by Mayor Hailey Morton Levinson. The 
tight-knit 
communities 
of 
Wilson, 
Moran, Alta, Kelly, and Teton Village 
bring the county’s population to over 
23,400. 
Five 
county 
commissioners, 
Chairwoman Natalia D. Macker, Vice- 
Chair Luther Propst, Mark Newcomb, 
Greg Epstein, and Mark Barron rep-
resent Teton County. 
The story of Teton County echoes the 
stories of communities across Wyo-
ming, carving out their homes in the 
American West. Even today, Teton 
County is 97 percent public land, in-
cluding the Bridger-Teton National 
Forest, Grand Teton National Park, 
and most of Yellowstone National 
Park. 
From its beginnings, tourism was an 
important business in the region. The 
first homesteaders in the 1880s hosted 
and outfitted the earliest tourists. 
Today, the wilderness attracts tourists 
from all over the world for numerous 
activities like camping, sightseeing, 
hiking, hunting, and snow-skiing, to 
name only a few. Three significant ski 
areas, Snow King Mountain Resort, 
Teton Village, and Grand Targhee Re-
sort ensure the tourism industry stays 
vibrant in the winter. 
The National Elk Refuge in Teton 
County is a winter-safe haven for up-
wards of 8,000 elk. The refuge, part of 
the National Wildlife Refuge System, 
provides critical habitat for a number 
of 
species, 
including 
elk, 
bison, 
pronghorn, swans, eagles, and trout. 
It is my honor to commemorate this 
historic milestone for Teton County. 
Their centennial celebration is a trib-
ute to generations of determination 
and commitment. My wife Bobbi and 
the people of Wyoming join me in our 
appreciation of the people of Teton 
County. We thank them for opening 
their communities to our great State, 
the Nation, and the world. We extend 
our congratulations as we look forward 
to the next 100 years.

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL BRADLEY 
BOYD 
Mr. KING. Madam President, today I 
wish to recognize and congratulate 
COL Brad Boyd on his outstanding 
service to our Nation both as a member 
of my defense and foreign policy team, 
and as a U.S. Army infantry officer 
with 30 years of combined military ex-
perience in both the Army and the Ma-
rine Corps. 
Colonel Boyd selflessly devoted the 
last 4 months of his time in service to 
working in my office as a defense and 
foreign policy adviser and as the lead 
staff member assigned to the Cyber-
space Solarium Commission. During 
this service, Colonel Boyd made several 
major policy contributions that will af-
fect how the Department of Defense 
and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity will defend the United States and 
its interests in the future. Prior to 
joining my office, Brad served as the 
Director of Joint Warfighting for the 
Department’s Joint Artificial Intel-
ligence Center. Colonel Boyd also pre-
viously served as a senior military fel-
low at Stanford University’s Center for 
International Security and Coopera-
tion, where his research addressed 
cyber- and AI-enabled information war-
fare and national security strategy. Be-
fore Stanford, Brad served as a liaison 
officer to the British Army, as well as 
in a number of infantry and overseas 
assignments: as deputy commander of 
a 4,000-paratrooper brigade ready for 
short-notice worldwide contingency op-
erations; as commander of a battalion 
in the 82nd Airborne Division tasked as 
the 
U.S. 
Army’s 
Global 
Response 
Force—a unit of 800 paratroopers ready 
to deploy and operate anywhere in the 
world within 18 hours’ notice; and as 
commander of a rifle company as part 
of a task force that played a key role 
in the hunt for Saddam Hussein. 
On behalf of my colleagues and the 
U.S. Congress, I thank Colonel Boyd 
for his dedicated service to my staff, 
the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, 
and the Nation. What truly makes the 
U.S. military the greatest in the his-
tory of the world is the fact that 
servicemembers like Colonel Boyd de-
cide to dedicate their lives to service 
and sacrifice for their country. I wish 
him all the best and know that he will 
excel in anything that he chooses to 
pursue in his next endeavors.

RECOGNIZING SUMMER 2021 
INTERNS 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize my summer 2021 
interns. Team Lummis was fortunate 
to be joined this summer by an amaz-
ing group of six interns, in both our 
State and DC offices. These young peo-
ple’s willingness to participate in an 
internship shows motivation to learn, 
dedication to becoming educated and 
engaged citizens, and a love for the 
State of Wyoming and this country. 
Interacting with this group of interns 
has been rewarding for both my staff 
and me and given us renewed hope for 
the future. As they leave our office and 
embark on their next adventures, I 
want to thank: Tanner Conley, Karryn 
MacDonald, 
Payton 
McEndree, 
and 
Madison Stoddard who served in my DC 
office; Bailey Harshell, who served in 
my Casper office; and Sullivan Fagan 
who served in my Cheyenne office. 
Keep working hard, take pride in the 
work you do, and don’t forget to enjoy 
the ride.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GARRETT LEWIS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Garrett Lewis 
who is saying goodbye as chief mete-
orologist at KFSM after a remarkable 
20-year career dedicated to keeping Ar-
kansans safe and providing dependable, 
reliable, and accurate weather fore-
casts. 
As part of the meteorology team at 
KFSM, Garrett used his experience and 
expertise to provide the people of Ar-
kansas and Oklahoma with crucial in-
formation regarding the weather and 
dangerous conditions including torna-
does, flooding, and ice storms. His ef-
forts helped countless Arkansans and 
made him a trusted household name. 
Garrett was born and raised in Alma, 
AR, where he developed his passion and 
appreciation for the weather. It is no 
surprise that after earning his bach-
elor’s degree from Mississippi State 
University, Garrett returned to his 
roots in Arkansas to serve the commu-
nity. He quickly rose to success at 
KFSM. 
While 
maintaining 
a 
busy 
schedule, he also found time to earn a 
master’s degree in applied meteor-
ology. 
Garrett’s work has been recognized 
and celebrated by his peers with both 
the National Weather Association Seal 
of Approval and the American Meteoro-
logical Society Seal of Approval. The 
Arkansas Associated Press also ac-
knowledged the quality of his work, in-
cluding with its award for ‘‘Best 
Weathercast’’ numerous times. 
He has a warm heart and deeply cares 
about the people in western Arkansas, 
something he exhibited during each 
newscast 
and 
with 
viewers 
he 
interacted with every day. That ex-
tends beyond his weather role. He is a 
strong champion for the welfare of 
children, having taken a vested inter-
est in preventing their abuse and sup-
porting efforts to treat those who expe-
rience it through his service on the 
boards of the Benton County Children’s 
Advocacy Center and Children’s Advo-
cacy Centers of Arkansas. His efforts 
have led to positive change and tough-
er laws to protect children from preda-
tors. 
Garrett has dedicated 20 years of his 
life to serving the people of Arkansas 
while being a loving father and devoted 
husband. I know his wife Ashley and 
his children Graham and Ellis are very 
proud of him and are looking forward 
to spending more time together. 
I applaud Garrett for his outstanding 
leadership and accomplished career 
which has been marked by service. We 
will miss watching him on TV with his 
sleeves rolled up as dangerous weather 
approaches, but we can be confident he 
will apply the same drive and skill to 
whatever endeavors he pursues in the 
future. I join many Arkansans in an-
ticipating this chapter in his life and 
career and wish him all the best as it 
begins.

REMEMBERING DR. JOSEPH PETER 
CANGEMI 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, Dr. Jo-
seph Peter Cangemi lived a life un-
matched in experiences. With his wife 
Amelia 
by 
his 
side, 
he 
traveled 
throughout the world doing what he 
loved most: consulting with business 
professionals on how to be better lead-
ers. This was the perfect profession for 
Dr. Cangemi, as he was a natural lead-
er. When he spoke, you listened be-
cause what was about to be said con-
tained something important, some-
thing that could be of value either in 
that moment or down the road. In addi-
tion 
to 
consulting 
services, 
Dr. 
Cangemi also had a passion for teach-
ing young people at Western Kentucky 
University, many of whom are now suc-
cessful in business as a result of the 
life lessons he shared. He brought text-
books to life by weaving in his own 
unique experience. This was what made 
his classes some of the most sought 
after at WKU. He wasn’t offering the-
ory alone, but real-world experience 
with actual Fortune 500 companies. 
Few can gracefully navigate the de-
mands of academia for extended peri-
ods of time. Joseph saw egoes come and 
go, but always stood the test of time at 
WKU. He had a career spanning over 
five decades where he won countless 
awards, including the Excellence in 
Teaching Award from the College of 
Education and Behavioral Sciences 
three times, Distinguished Public Serv-
ice Award, and the Excellence in Re-
search and Creativity Award. Along 
with numerous awards, Dr. Cangemi 
was also editor of the International 
Journal of Leadership and Change. 
Aside from his professional feats, Dr. 
Cangemi was also unmatched as a fam-
ily man. He and his wife Amelia trav-
eled all over the world bringing back 
stories and mementos to share with the 
grandkids. Primary to traveling, they 
prioritized spending time with family. 
He and Amelia rarely missed a basket-
ball game his grandson played in, or a 
recital his granddaughters took part 
in. It wasn’t unusual for Joe to bring 
his grandchildren to his classes where 
they would actively participate. They 
were his pride and joy, and he never 
missed an opportunity to see them. He 
and his wife Amelia would have cele-
brated their 59th wedding anniversary 
this year. 
Dr. Joseph Cangemi was born on 
June 26, 1936, in Syracuse, NY, and sur-
rounded by his family, died peacefully 
on June 13, 2021. While we are sad to 
lose such a valued member of the com-
munity, we look at the success of his 
students and family members and are 
reminded of the positive impact he had 
on our world. May Joe rest in peace.∑

RECOGNIZING K & T STEEL CORP 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
senior member and former chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Small Busi-
ness 
and 
Entrepreneurship, 
each 
month, I recognize and celebrate the 
American entrepreneurial spirit by 
highlighting the success of a small 
business in my home State of Idaho. 
Today, I am pleased to honor K & T 
Steel Corp in Twin Falls as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for Au-
gust 2021. 
Purchased by William ‘‘Bill’’ Koch, 
Sr., and Lavear Thornock in 1959, K & 
T Steel Corp is a fabricator and manu-
facturer of steel and reinforced bar 
products located in Idaho’s Magic Val-
ley that is now owned by Gary Palmer 
and Jamin Wills. For more than six 
decades, the company has developed a 
reputation for its high-quality produc-
tion of beams, rebar, and fuel storage 
tanks, among other specialty steel 
products. The company prides itself on 
tailoring its products and services to 
meet the unique needs of its clients. 
The company’s prowess has led to its 
involvement in major projects through-
out the State of Idaho. In 2018, K & T 
fabricated the trellis pieces of a sky 
bridge that connects St. Luke’s Chil-
dren’s Hospital with Idaho Elks Chil-
dren’s Pavilion and, in 2020, built the 
Shoshone Street Archway that was 
constructed as a tribute to the historic 
Perrine Memorial Bridge. K & T’s con-
tributions to these celebrated projects 
encapsulate the company’s unique con-
nection and commitment to Idaho and 
the Twin Falls community. 
Additionally, K & T Steel Corp has a 
long-standing tradition of service to 
the community. The company donated 
a stairwell to the Twin Falls Optimist 
Youth Ranch in 2018, provided dona-
tions to St. Luke’s Magic Valley 
Health Foundation, and is a sponsor of 
the College of Southern Idaho’s Nuts, 
Bolts, and Thingamajigs camp for chil-
dren aged 12–17. 
Congratulations to Gary, Jamin, and 
all of the employees of K & T Steel on

instilled in him a strong desire to pur-
sue a career in education. He dedicates 
his time to giving his students a voice

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–59. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the 
United States Congress that state funeral be 
held at such time of the passing of the last 
World War II Medal of Honor recipient and to 
honor those who served in World War II; to 
the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 101 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is the United 
States of America’s highest and most-pres-
tigious personal military decoration that 
may be awarded to recognize United States 
military service members who have distin-
guished themselves by acts of valor. The 
Medal of Honor represents the indomitable 
spirit, determination, selflessness, and gal-
lantry of those who, in the face of over-
whelming odds, performed far beyond the 
call of duty; and 
Whereas, as members of the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation,’’ which represented the char-
acter and strength of the State of Idaho and 
the United States, Captain Arthur Junior 
Jackson, United States Marine Corps, who 
served with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine 
Regiment, and Robert Dale Maxwell, United 
States Army, who served with the 7th Infan-
try Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, were 
both awarded the Medal of Honor during 
World War II for gallantry, risking their 
lives, and acting with valor. Both Captain 
Arthur Junior Jackson and Robert Dale 
Maxwell, along with Idaho’s other Medal of 
Honor recipient’s, are now deceased, leaving 
only memories of their heroic acts. The sto-
ries of these patriots’ courage and valor dur-
ing the war should never be forgotten; and 
Whereas, the President of the United 
States holds the authority to designate a 
state funeral. A number of state funerals to 
honor our war heroes have been held in the 
past, including the 1921 state funeral for the 
Unknown Soldier of World War I and the 1964 
state funeral honoring General Douglas Mac-
Arthur. These state funerals have offered our 
nation the opportunity to pause, reflect, and 
honor the service of those individuals and 
those who served alongside them; and 
Whereas, the last surviving Medal of Honor 
recipients from World War II are 96-year-old 
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, a retired United 
States Marine Corps warrant officer and 
United States Department of Veterans Af-
fairs veterans service representative, and 99- 
year-old Charles H. Coolidge, who served as a 
United States Army technical sergeant: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-sixth Idaho Legis-
lature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, that a state 
funeral be held at such time of the passing of 
the last World War II Medal of Honor recipi-
ent, to honor the last surviving Medal of 
Honor recipient from World War II, and to 
honor those who served in World War II, such 
distinction giving our nation the oppor-
tunity to thank those who saved the world 
from Nazism, fascism, and militaristic impe-
rialism. This national recognition would also 
serve to honor the 473 service members who 
were awarded the Medal of Honor for service 
during World War II, along with the 16 mil-
lion American men and women who faith-
fully served our nation, including many Ida-
hoans, during that war, paying a final salute 
to the millions of men and women of the 
‘‘Greatest Generation’’ who served our coun-
try from 1941 to 1945; Be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be, and she is hereby authorized and directed 
to forward a copy of this Memorial to the 
President of the United States, to the Presi-
dent of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives of Congress, and to 
the congressional delegation representing 
the State of Idaho in the Congress of the 
United States. 
POM–60. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia urging the United States Congress that 
state funeral be held at such time of the 
passing of the last World War II Medal of 
Honor recipient and to honor those who 
served in World War II; to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 201 
Whereas, Only 473 Americans were awarded 
the Congressional Medal of Honor, the na-
tion’s highest decoration of valor during 
World War II, and, as of today, only one of 
those Americans, West Virginia’s own son, 
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, remains alive; 
and 
Whereas, The time is approaching for a 
final salute to the Medal of Honor recipients 
from World War II; and 
Whereas, A single state funeral to be held 
upon the death of the last living Medal of 
Honor recipient from World War II would be 
the perfect vehicle to do so, and it would also 
provide national recognition to honor all 16 
million soldiers, sailors and airmen who 
served in our armed forces from 1941 to 1945; 
and 
Whereas, General Douglas MacArthur, Su-
preme Allied Commander in the Pacific the-
atre, and General Dwight Eisenhower, Su-
preme Allied Commander of the European 
theatre, were each honored by the nation 
with state funerals; and 
Whereas, The selfless, brave men and 
women who served under them deserve the 
honor of special recognition at a state fu-
neral to be held upon the death of the last

States and Europe; and 
Whereas, The United States Air Force 
(USAF) did not include Mansfield among 
eight possible locations for support of the C– 
130J Super Hercules, the newest version of

POM–63. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of New Jer-
sey urging efforts at the state and federal 
levels to protect minority communities 
through better regulation of debt settlement 
companies; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 103 
Whereas, The General Assembly recognizes 
that 
debt 
settlement 
companies, 
which 
øclaim to¿ settle, renegotiate, or in some 
way change the terms of a person’s debt to a 
creditor, øcause¿ can offer significant øprob-
lems for borrowers, often increasing debt 
while complicating the process of becoming¿ 
benefits to consumers wishing to become debt 
free; and 
Whereas, Debt settlement companies øsug-
gest that they are ‘‘negotiating¿ negotiate 
with creditors to settle delinquent debt for 
less than what is øowed’’ and can require 
that consumers stop making payment,¿ 
owed, a process that usually øfor¿ takes two to 
three years ø, while they negotiate a settle-
ment¿; and 
Whereas, Stopping payments causes ac-
counts to default, resulting in additional 
late payments, late fees, and other penalties 
that will be added to the amount already 
owed; and 
Whereas, øDebt settlement¿ Stopping pay-
ments will have a negative impact on con-
sumers’ credit scores and make it more dif-
ficult to access affordable credit, since ødebt 
settlement remains¿ delinquencies remain on 
a credit report for øseven¿ several years and 
not paying the full amount owed or missing 
payments øwhile negotiating a settlement 
lowers¿ can result in lower credit scores; and 
Whereas, A fee is normally charged by debt 
settlement companies to negotiate on a con-
sumer’s behalf and can be as much as ø20¿ 18 
to 25 percent of the øfinal settlement¿ origi-
nal amount owed, which means a consumer 
with a $5,000 settlement of a $10,000 debt may 
have an additional ø$1,000 to $1,250¿ $1,800 to 
$2,500 in fees to pay; and 
Whereas, Lenders are under no obligation 
to accept settlement offers and in fact, some 
lenders refuse to work with debt settlement 
companies; and 
Whereas, There can be negative tax con-
sequences from using a debt settlement com-
pany, as whatever amount of debt is forgiven 
may be considered as income and require 
that the consumer list this amount as in-
come on their tax returns; and 
Whereas, øThese companies often dis-
proportionately operate in¿ It is important to 
protect minority communities, where individ-
uals and families often have fewer resources 
to draw on when they come under financial 
pressure; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey (the General Assembly concurring); 
1. The Legislature supports efforts at the 
state and federal levels that ensure debt set-
tlement companies are subject to basic con-
sumer protections, including licensing, reg-
ular examination, and prominent mandatory 
disclosure. 
2. The Legislature recognizes that these 
services do not release a consumer from ex-
isting debt, and that ceasing to make pay-
ments without the consent of the creditor

may subject the borrower to collections ac-
tivities, additional fees, and interest. 
3. The Legislature urges states, including 
New Jersey, to consider legislation restrict-
ing ødebt settlement companies’¿ the making 
of unsafe or unsustainable loans directly or 
indirectly to consumers. 
4. The Legislature encourages the federal 
government to conduct a comprehensive re-
view of its oversight of debt øservicing¿ set-
tlement companies, to include a review of fed-
eral bankruptcy rules; how debt settlement 
companies act as credit counseling services; 
the status of these companies as money serv-
icing businesses; and a review of the enforce-
ment of current laws and regulations by the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 
Federal Trade Commission. 
5. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the 
Secretary of the Senate to the President of 
the United States, the Vice President of the 
United States, members of the United States 
House of Representatives and United States 
Senate, the United States Secretary of the 
Treasury, and to other federal and State gov-
ernment officials as appropriate. 
POM–64. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey urging the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to create a National Infra-
structure Bank; to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 81 
Whereas, The American Society of Civil 
Engineers (ASCE) stated in its 2017 report 
card that the United States received a grade 
of ‘‘D’’ regarding the current state of infra-
structure, and that $4.6 trillion would be 
needed to restore the country’s infrastruc-
ture to a state of good repair. Current fund-
ing falls over $2 trillion short of this 
amount. Urgently needed programs, includ-
ing passenger transit systems and high-speed 
rail, broadband, clean water supply systems, 
power grid upgrades, flood control, and oth-
ers, are not included; and 
Whereas, The State of New Jersey was 
given a ‘‘D+’’ grade by the ASCE on its most 
recent report card in 2016. Over 11 percent of 
New Jersey’s bridges are labelled as struc-
turally deficient, and most have reached or 
exceeded their expected lifespan. New Jersey 
dams are graded as a ‘‘D,’’ with 178 dams re-
ceiving a ‘‘poor’’ rating by the New Jersey 
Bureau of Dam Safety. New Jersey’s drink-
ing water infrastructure received a ‘‘C’’ 
grade in 2016, with most systems approach-
ing 100 years of age; and 
Whereas, New Jersey levees were graded 
‘‘D¥’’ and roads were graded ‘‘D+;’’ 64 per-
cent of State roads are deemed heavily con-
gested; and time spent sitting in traffic in-
creases air pollution and adds hundreds of 
dollars to commuter costs every year; and 
Whereas, These infrastructure issues are in 
addition to the critical condition that has 
developed within the tunnels under the Hud-
son River that support commerce between 
New Jersey and Manhattan. These 108-year 
old tunnels carry 20 percent of the national 
GDP on a daily basis, and the collapse of one 
or both tunnels would be cataclysmic. Addi-
tionally, the bridges carrying trains to the 
tunnels, the Portal Bridge and others, need 
urgent repair or outright replacement. These 
tunnels form a chokepoint, the failure or 
shutdown of which would have a ripple effect 
on transportation and commerce throughout 
New Jersey and the region; and 
Whereas, The United States has previously 
utilized national banks to direct financing 
into infrastructure construction, with poli-
cies implemented in the administrations of 
Presidents George Washington, John Quincy 
Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt. Much of the nation’s in-
frastructure at the time, including that in 
the State of New Jersey, was financed this 
way; and 
Whereas, A new National Infrastructure 
Bank can be created to direct $4 trillion to 
urgently needed infrastructure concerns. 
This bank can be funded with no new federal 
appropriations, by exchanging a small por-
tion of Treasury debt, in the amount of $500 
billion, for stock in the bank. The new bank, 
operating as a commercial bank, could lend 
out $4 trillion to states, counties, munici-
palities, and other governmental entities at 
a low interest in order to finance their infra-
structure projects; and 
Whereas, Seventeen state legislatures have 
filed similar resolutions, and three state leg-
islatures have passed resolutions in a bipar-
tisan vote. This policy has been endorsed by 
many national organizations, including the 
National Congress of Black Women, National 
Latino Farmers and Ranchers Trade Associa-
tion, and the National Federation of Federal 
Employees; and many local entities, includ-
ing the Mercer County Board of Freeholders 
and the Trenton City Council; now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges the Presi-
dent and Congress of the United States to 
enact legislation creating a new National In-
frastructure Bank to address the infrastruc-
ture crisis that has gripped the nation. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent of the United States and to every mem-
ber of the New Jersey Congressional delega-
tion. 
POM–65. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey urging the 
Fish and Wildlife Service to list the monarch 
butterfly as a threatened species; to the 
Committee 
on 
Environment 
and 
Public 
Works. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 102 
Whereas, The monarch butterfly (Danaus 
plexippus) is an iconic large orange and 
black butterfly that is one of the most famil-
iar butterflies in North America; and 
Whereas, Every autumn, millions of mon-
arch butterflies undertake a spectacular 
multi-generational migration thousands of 
miles from Canada and the northern United 
States to Mexico and California, stopping 
along the way in places like New Jersey, to 
feed and reproduce; and 
Whereas, Monarch butterfly populations in 
North America represent the vast majority 
of all monarch butterflies in the world; and 
Whereas, Monarch butterfly habitat has 
been 
drastically 
reduced 
and 
degraded 
throughout the butterfly’s summer and win-
ter ranges by the decline of nectar sources, 
commercial 
development, 
logging, 
and 
broader environmental changes; and 
Whereas, One of the major reasons for 
monarch butterfly population decline is the 
increased use of pesticides that kill milk-
weed, the monarch butterfly’s preferred 
plant host; and 
Whereas, Climate change also poses a dire 
threat to the monarch butterfly, as several 
scientists have predicted that the monarch 
butterfly’s overwintering habitat in Mexico 
may be rendered unsuitable by global cli-
mate change. and that much of the monarch 
butterfly’s summer range may also become 
unsuitable due to increasing temperatures; 
and 
Whereas, Disease and predation also con-
tribute to population decline and major 
threats facing the monarch butterfly include 
numerous pathogens, such as viruses, bac-
teria. and protozoan parasites; and 
Whereas, The monarch butterfly popu-
lation has declined by more than 90 percent 
in the past two decades, and is presently 
near the lowest population ever recorded; 
and 
Whereas, The federal ‘‘Endangered Species 
Act’’ (16 U.S.C. s. 1531 et seq.) allows a spe-
cies to be listed as ‘‘threatened’’ when it is 
at risk of becoming endangered in a signifi-
cant portion of its range; and 
Whereas, Although there are small popu-
lations of monarch butterflies throughout 
the world, the North American monarch but-
terfly population is significant because with-
out it, the redundancy, resiliency, and rep-
resentation of the species would be so im-
paired that the monarch butterfly would be-
come increasingly vulnerable to extinction; 
and 
Whereas, Numerous other species have 
been protected under the federal Endangered 
Species Act that have large ranges and rel-
atively abundant population sizes but have 
experienced precipitous population decline 
and face significant threats to their contin-
ued existence, such as the gray bat (Myotis 
grisescens), Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), and 
piping plover (Charadrius melodus); and 
Whereas, In 2014, a group of conservation-
ists, including the Center for Biological Di-
versity, the Center for Food Safety, and the 
Xerces Society, petitioned the Secretary of 
the United States Department of the Inte-
rior, through the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service, to protect the monarch but-
terfly under the federal Endangered Species 
Act; and 
Whereas, Based on information in that pe-
tition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service de-
termined that the monarch butterfly popu-
lation may warrant federal protection, and 
began the process of conducting a thorough 
assessment to determine if the monarch but-
terfly should be listed as a threatened spe-
cies; and 
Whereas, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice is presently developing a database to cap-
ture new, ongoing, and planned conservation 
efforts for the monarch butterfly, including 
the enhancement of blooming nectar plant 
habitats, and to help the agency and its con-
servation partners assess conditions for the 
monarch butterfly now and into the future; 
and 
Whereas, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice øanticipates making a listing decision 
concerning the monarch butterfly in June 
2019¿ announced in December 2020 that listing 
the monarch butterfly as endangered or threat-
ened under the Endangered Species Act is war-
ranted, but precluded by higher priority listing 
actions ; and 
Whereas, New Jersey has long supported 
the preservation of the monarch butterfly, 
and in 2017, passed two separate pieces of leg-
islation helping to protect the species: the 
‘‘Adopt a Monarch Butterfly Waystation 
Act,’’ P.L.2017, c.250 (C.13:1B–15.162 et seq.), 
and the ‘‘Milkweed for Monarchs Act,’’ 
P.L.2017, c.252 (C.13:1B–15.170 et seq.); and 
Whereas, New Jersey values the important 
role that pollinators, such as the monarch 
butterfly, play in the ecology of the State 
and the nation, and there is bi-partisan sup-
port in New Jersey for programs and legisla-
tion that protect and encourage pollinators 
and the habitats that support them: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House urges the United States Fish 
and Wildlife Service to list the monarch but-
terfly as a threatened species under the fed-
eral Endangered Species Act. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5715 
August 3, 2021 
by Secretary of the Senate to the Governor 
of the State of New Jersey, to the President 
of the United States, the Secretary of the 
United States Department of the Interior, 
the Director of the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service in the United States Depart-
ment of the Interior, every member of Con-
gress elected from the State of New Jersey, 
the Governor of New Jersey, and the Com-
missioner of the New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection. 
POM–66. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to enact legislation to au-
thorize states to obtain a state universal 
health care waiver; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 585 
Whereas, the current system of health care 
coverage in the State does not provide uni-
versal coverage for all Maine residents; and 
Whereas, health care coverage is often 
unaffordable and causes financial strain for 
many Maine residents; and 
Whereas, every person in the State should 
have access to affordable and high-quality 
health care; and 
Whereas, there are significant barriers in 
federal law that affect the ability of indi-
vidual states to establish a universal health 
care plan to provide affordable and high- 
quality health care to all residents; and 
Whereas, these state efforts are also hin-
dered by a lack of federal support and financ-
ing to assist states interested in the estab-
lishment of a state-based universal health 
care plan; and 
Whereas, proposed legislation was pre-
viously introduced in the 116th Congress, 
H.R. 5010, the State-Based Universal Health 
Care Act of 2019, and similar legislation is 
expected to be reintroduced in the 117th Con-
gress that would establish a federal waiver 
for states interested in establishing a uni-
versal health care plan for residents: now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on 
behalf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to respectfully request that the 
President of the United States and the 
United States Congress enact legislation to 
authorize states to obtain a state universal 
health care waiver; and be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United 
States; the President of the United States 
Senate; the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives; and each Member 
of the Maine Congressional Delegation. 
POM–67. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Wyoming request-
ing the federal government to respect state 
sovereignty; to review and correct federal ac-
tions which infringe upon the right to bear 
arms; and to recognize the impact of federal 
land use and natural resource development 
policies on Wyoming citizens and to collabo-
rate with the state in adopting and imple-
menting the policies; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3 
Whereas, a union of sovereign states estab-
lished a federal government and delegated 
limited powers to that government; 
Whereas, any question as to whether pow-
ers not delegated to the federal government 
were retained by the states was emphatically 
answered with the ratification of the tenth 
amendment; 
Whereas, Wyoming is a sovereign state ad-
mitted to the union on an equal footing, in 
all respects, in accordance with Wyoming’s 
Act of Admission; 
Whereas, the United States Constitution, 
treaties, federal law and numerous court de-
cisions have recognized that Indian tribes ex-
ercise inherent sovereign powers over their 
members and territory; 
Whereas, the United States supreme court 
has consistently affirmed that the power of 
Congress to admit new states, is limited as 
the ‘‘Union of States, must be equal in 
power, dignity and authority, each state 
competent to exert that residuum of sov-
ereignty not delegated to the United States 
by the Constitution itself.’’ Coyle v. Smith, 
221 U.S. 559 (1911); 
Whereas, the second amendment to the fed-
eral Constitution recognizes the right of the 
people to bear arms and that the right shall 
not be infringed, and Article 1, Section 24 of 
the Wyoming Constitution provides that the 
right of citizens to bear arms in defense of 
themselves and of the state shall not be de-
nied; 
Whereas, Wyoming has been blessed with 
abundant natural resources which have been 
developed to create economic prosperity and 
provide energy independence from foreign 
nations thereby providing for the peace, safe-
ty and happiness of all citizens of the United 
States; 
Whereas, the federal government has re-
cently taken actions limiting the develop-
ment of natural resources, in many instances 
unilaterally through the executive depart-
ment, without consultation with Congress or 
the States; 
Whereas, the federal government through 
Congressional enactments, executive orders, 
agency regulations and judicial rulings has 
limited the transfer and ownership of fire-
arms and has provided for the tracking of 
firearms, which are actions infringing upon 
the people’s rights; 
Whereas, federal laws enacted in accord-
ance with the limited powers delegated by 
the union of states to the federal govern-
ment are the supreme law of the land as rec-
ognized by the United States and Wyoming 
Constitutions; 
Whereas, the state of Wyoming is an in-
separable part of the federal union; 
Whereas, a more perfect union will not be 
realized by actions of any single department 
of the federal government and cannot be 
forged by acts of a federal government which 
exceed delegated powers; nor should acts of 
the federal government be tolerated when 
exercise of those delegated powers harms the 
welfare of the citizens of states, even when 
in complete observance of constitutional 
limitations; and 
Whereas, all power is inherent in the peo-
ple and all free governments are founded on 
their authority. Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the members of the Legisla-
ture of the state of Wyoming: 
Section 1. That the current Executive De-
partment Administration of the federal gov-
ernment and Congress should here and now, 
and in the future, respect the sovereignty of 
Wyoming and the other states of our union. 
Section 2. That the federal government not 
regulate arms at a national level and that 
the Executive Department of the federal gov-
ernment work with Congress and the states 
to review and correct federal actions which 
infringe on the rights conferred by the sec-
ond amendment to the federal constitution 
and on the rights of citizens conferred inde-
pendently by the constitutions of the several 
states. 
Section 3. That the current Executive De-
partment Administration should respect the 
critical role that federal lands play in Wyo-
ming’s culture, recreation, wildlife, live-
stock production, mineral development and 
tourism, and the current Administration and 
Congress work with the state of Wyoming to 
develop federal policies land use policies in a 
manner which recognizes their impacts on 
Wyoming citizens and implements those 
policies in a manner consistent with the 
state’s and tribes’ cultures. 
Section 4. That the Secretary of State of 
Wyoming transmit copies of this resolution 
to the President of the United States, to the 
President of the Senate and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States Congress and to the Wyoming Con-
gressional Delegation. 
POM–68. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio 
urging the United States Congress to enact 
the Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare 
Parity Act; to the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTON NO. 1 
Whereas, Throughout the state’s and the 
nation’s history, brave Ohioans have an-
swered the call of duty and service, defend-
ing our freedoms as members of the United 
States Armed Forces; and 
Whereas, As a result of the Manhattan 
Project, the United States conducted the 
Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of 
a nuclear device, in New Mexico on July 16, 
1945; and 
Whereas, 
Over 
two 
hundred 
thousand 
American service members, including Ohio-
ans, participated in above ground nuclear 
tests between 1945 and 1962, were part of the 
United States military occupation forces in 
or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki before 
1946, or were held as a prisoner of war in or 
near Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and 
Whereas, These atomic veterans may have 
been exposed to radiation as a result or their 
military service and, due to that exposure, 
may have developed cancer or other medical 
conditions; and 
Whereas, Many atomic veterans were pre-
vented by secrecy laws or oaths from seeking 
medical care or disability compensation 
from the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs for conditions they may have 
developed as a result of radiation exposure; 
and 
Whereas, In 1996, the United States Con-
gress repealed the Nuclear Radiation and Se-
crecy Agreements Act, freeing atomic vet-
erans to describe their military involvement 
in nuclear testing in order to file for benefits 
from the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs; and 
Whereas, Atomic veterans may be eligible 
for free medical care from the United States 
Department of Veterans Affairs and com-
pensation in the form of a partial or full 
service-connected disability allowance, in-
cluding potential payments to a surviving 
spouse or children; and 
Whereas, The Mark Takai Atomic Vet-
erans Healthcare Parity Act, introduced in 
the 116th Congress as S. 555 and H.R. 1377, in-
cluded veterans who participated in the 
cleanup of Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall 
Islands between January 1, 1977, and Decem-
ber 31, 1980, as radiation-exposed veterans for 
purposes of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs’ presumption of service connection for 
specified cancers; and 
Whereas, The Ohio Department of Veterans 
Services provides free assistance to Ohio vet-
erans and their dependents in developing and 
submitting disability compensation claims 
to the United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs; and 
Whereas, The National Association of 
Atomic Veterans was formed in 1979 to help 
atomic veterans obtain medical care and as-
sistance; and 
Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper 
that atomic veterans be recognized for their 
service and sacrifice to the nation: Now 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
134th General Assembly of the State of Ohio, 
urge the United States Congress to enact the 
Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare 
Parity Act; and be it further

KEY, and Mr. HEINRICH) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 334 
Whereas the first Monday in March is an 
appropriate day to be recognized as ‘‘COVID– 
19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day’’; 
Whereas COVID–19 (SARS–CoV–2), a novel 
coronavirus, is a deadly illness caused by a 
virus that can transmit from person to per-
son; 
Whereas, in 2020, COVID–19 began to spread 
throughout the world, creating a global pan-
demic that has had a catastrophic impact on 
human life, communities in the United 
States, and the United States economy; 
Whereas, in March 2020, communities in 
every State began to experience increased 
loss of life and families lost fathers, mothers, 
brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and neigh-
bors from the virus; 
Whereas, beginning in 2020, many across 
the United States were, and continue to be, 
personally impacted by COVID–19, including 
mourning their loved ones and neighbors or 
suffering 
from 
the 
unknown 
long-term 
health implications of the virus; 
Whereas, by the end of July 2021, there had 
been more than 34,733,631 known cases of the 
virus in the United States and more than 
600,000 people tragically lost their lives; 
Whereas COVID–19 has had a dispropor-
tionate impact on low-income communities 
and communities of color, with higher rates 
of infection and death, exacerbating inequi-
ties already prevalent in our systems that 
must 
addressed 
throughout 
the 
United 
States; 
Whereas public servants, frontline and es-
sential workers, and health care profes-
sionals took selfless actions to protect their 
neighbors and communities, support strug-
gling local economies, and find innovative 
ways to provide services; 
Whereas local, State, Tribal, and Federal 
Government entities provided critical sup-
port to businesses, communities, and the 
people of the United States in need; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic continues 
to have an impact on the United States and 
countries around the world; and 
Whereas each life lost to COVID–19, each 
inequity and broken system brought to light, 
and each sacrifice made shall never be for-
gotten: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) will memorialize those lost to the 
COVID–19 virus; 
(2) recognizes the suffering of those who 
contracted the COVID–19 virus and survived 
but carry with them the unknown health 
side effects; and 
(3) expresses support for the designation of 
the first Monday in March as ‘‘COVID–19 
Victims and Survivors Memorial Day’’.

one of the most sustainable fisheries in the 
world; 
Whereas, throughout history, Presidents of

breakfast offering; 
Whereas 
lobster 
is 
continually 
incor-
porated into trending recipes such as pho,

cocktails, 
and 
ice 
cream; 
Whereas the peak of the lobstering season 
in the United States occurs in late summer; 
Whereas harvesters, dealers, processors, 
and cooks adapted and innovated during the 
COVID-19 pandemic to help people enjoy 
their favorite lobster dishes and discover 
new ones in the comfort of their homes; 
Whereas the Unicode Consortium added a 
lobster to its emoji set in 2018 in recognition 
of the popularity of the species around the 
world; 
Whereas lobsters have inspired artists in 
the United States and throughout the world 
for hundreds of years; 
Whereas lobsters have been, and continue 
to be, used as mascots for sports teams;

crimination in compensation because of 
race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; 
Whereas despite the passage of the Equal 
Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) 5 decades 
ago, which requires that men and women in 
the same workplace be given equal pay for 
equal work, Census Bureau data show that 
Black women working full time, year round, 
are paid 63 cents for every dollar paid to 
White, non-Hispanic men; 
Whereas if the current trends continue, on 
average, Black women will have to wait 100 
years to achieve equal pay; 
Whereas the median annual pay for a 
Black woman in the United States working 
full time, year round, is $41,098, which means 
that, on average, Black women lose nearly 
$964,400 in potential earnings to the wage gap 
over the course of a 40-year career; 
Whereas lost wages mean Black women 
have less money to support themselves and 
their families, save and invest for the future, 
and spend on goods and services, causing 
businesses and the economy to suffer as a re-
sult; 
Whereas Black women’s median earnings 
are less than men’s at every level of aca-
demic achievement; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
80 percent of Black mothers are key bread-
winners or co-breadwinners for their fami-
lies, but Black mothers working full time 
are paid only 52 percent as much as fathers; 
Whereas the lack of access to affordable, 
quality childcare, paid family and medical 
leave, paid sick leave, and other family- 
friendly workplace policies contributes to 
the wage gap by forcing many Black women 
to choose between their paycheck or job and 
getting quality care for themselves or their 
family members; 
Whereas if the wage gap were eliminated, 
on average, a Black woman working full 
time would have enough money for approxi-
mately 2.5 additional years of tuition and 
fees for a 4-year public university, the full 
cost of tuition and fees for a 2-year commu-
nity college, more than 16 additional months 
of premiums for employer-based health in-
surance, 153 weeks of food for her family, 15 
additional months of mortgage and utilities 
payments, 22 more months of rent, nearly 20 
additional years of birth control, or enough 
money to pay off student loan debt in just 
over 1 year; 
Whereas 25 to 85 percent of women have 
been sexually harassed at the workplace, and 
research has found that only a small number 
of women who experience harassment, about 
1 in 10, formally report incidents for reasons 
including lack of access to the complaints 
processes and fear of retaliation; 
Whereas 
workplace 
harassment 
forces 
many women to leave their occupation or in-
dustry; 
Whereas targets of harassment were 6.5 
times as likely as nontargets to change jobs 
or pass up opportunities for advancement, 
contributing to the gender wage gap; 
Whereas Black women were the most like-
ly of all racial and ethnic groups to have 
filed a sexual harassment charge; 
Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid 
the minimum wage or less are women, and 
there is an overrepresentation of women of 
color in low-wage and tipped occupations; 
Whereas more than 62 percent of women 
working in the private sector reported that 
they were either discouraged or prohibited 
from discussing wage and salary informa-
tion, which can hide pay discrimination and 
prevent remedies; 
Whereas the pay disparity Black women 
face is part of a wider set of disparities Black 
women face in home ownership, unemploy-
ment, poverty, access to childcare, and the 
ability to accumulate wealth; 
Whereas the gender wage gap for Black 
women has only narrowed by 3 cents in the 
last 3 decades; 
Whereas true pay equity requires a multi-
faceted strategy that addresses the gendered 
and racial injustices that Black women face 
daily; 
Whereas the pandemic has disproportion-
ately economically impacted Black women; 
and 
Whereas many national organizations have 
designated August 3, 2021, as Black Women’s 
Equal Pay Day to represent the additional 
time that women must work to compensate 
for the lower wages paid to Black women 
last year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) recognizes the disparity in wages paid 
to Black women and its impact on women, 
families, and the United States; and 
(2) reaffirms its support for ensuring equal 
pay for equal work and narrowing the gender 
wage gap.

ments of the eligible applicant.

tracting, to promote unity in the Federal 
workforce, and to combat offensive and anti- 
American race and sex stereotyping and 
scapegoating’’. 
(3) Specifically, EO 13950, among other 
things, prohibited Federal agencies from 
teaching, advocating, acting upon, or pro-
moting in any training to agency employees

that include a teaching or belief that ‘‘(1) 
one race or sex is inherently superior to an-
other race or sex; (2) the United States is

vidual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is 
inherently 
racist, 
sexist, 
or 
oppressive, 
whether consciously or unconsciously; (4) an 
individual should be discriminated against 
or receive adverse treatment solely or partly 
because of his or her race or sex; (5) members 
of one race or sex cannot and should not at-
tempt to treat others without respect to race 
or sex; (6) an individual’s moral character is 
necessarily determined by his or her race or 
sex; (7) an individual, by virtue of his or her 
race or sex, bears responsibility for actions 
committed in the past by other members of 
the same race or sex; (8) any individual 
should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any 
other form of psychological distress on ac-
count of his or her race or sex; or (9) 
meritocracy or traits such as a hard work 
ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by 
a particular race to oppress another race’’. 
(4) EO 13950 further required that diversity 
and inclusion efforts of Federal agencies 
must ‘‘first and foremost, encourage agency 
employees not to judge each other by their 
color, race, ethnicity, sex, or any other char-
acteristic protected by Federal law’’. 
(5) EO 13950 was issued soon after the Di-
rector of the Office of Management and 
Budget, Russell Vought, issued a September 
4, 2020, memorandum (referred to in this sec-
tion as the ‘‘September 4, 2020, memo-
randum’’) in which he explained that— 
(A) millions of taxpayer dollars have been 
spent on training Federal employees to ‘‘be-
lieve divisive, anti-American propaganda’’; 
(B) training sessions have taught that 
‘‘virtually all White people contribute [or 
benefit from] to racism’’; and 
(C) training sessions have claimed that 
‘‘there is racism embedded in the belief that 
America is the land of opportunity or the be-
lief that the most qualified person should re-
ceive a job’’. 
(6) In the September 4, 2020, memorandum, 
Director Vought further explained that the 
trainings described in paragraph (5) ‘‘not 
only run counter to the fundamental beliefs 
for which our Nation has stood since its in-
ception, but they also engender division and 
resentment within the Federal workforce’’. 
(7) EO 13950 and the September 4, 2020, 
memorandum stood as a direct rebuke of so- 
called ‘‘critical race theory’’. 
(8) Critical race theory, according to Herit-
age Foundation visiting fellow Chris Rufo 
(referred to in this section as ‘‘Rufo’’), is 
‘‘the idea that the United States is a fun-
damentally racist country and that all of the 
institutions, including the law, culture, busi-
ness, the economy are all designed to main-
tain white supremacy’’. 
(9) Critical race theory is, at its core, anti- 
American, discriminatory, and based on 
Marxist ideology. 
(10) Critical race theory relies on a Marxist 
analytical framework, viewing society in 
terms of the oppressed and the oppressor, 
and instills a defeatist mentality in the indi-
viduals that critical race theory casts as the 
oppressed. 
(11) Critical race theory’s objective is the 
destruction and replacement of Western En-
lightenment Liberalism with a Marxist-in-
fluenced government. 
(12) Critical race theory intentionally 
seeks to undermine capitalism and western 
values, such as property rights, free speech, 
and the very concept of Lockean natural 
rights. 
(13) At the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, Rufo explained, trainers ‘‘insisted that 
statements such as ‘America is the land of 
opportunity,’ ‘Everybody can succeed in this 
society, if they work hard enough,’ and ‘I be-
lieve the most qualified person should get 
the job’ are racist and harmful’’. 
(14) At a training session at the National 
Credit 
Union 
Administration, 
diversity 
trainer Howard Ross taught that ‘‘It is irref-
utable that [American society] is a system 
based on racism’’ and ‘‘good and decent 
[White] people . . . support the status quo 
[of] a system of systematized racism’’. 
(15) According to Rufo, employees of the 
Department of the Treasury and Federal fi-
nancial agencies attended a series of events 
at which diversity trainer Howard Ross 
taught employees that all White individuals 
in the United States are complicit in White 
supremacy ‘‘by automatic response to the 
ways we’re taught Whiteness includes White 
privilege and White supremacy’’. 
(16) Martin Luther King, Jr., in his ‘‘I have 
a dream speech’’ said, ‘‘I look to a day when 
people will not be judged by the color of 
their skin, but by the content of their char-
acter’’. 
(17) By teaching that certain individuals, 
by virtue of inherent characteristics, are in-
herently flawed, critical race theory con-
tradicts the basic principle upon which the 
United States was founded that all men and 
women are created equal. 
(18) The teachings of critical race theory 
stand in contrast to the overarching goal of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000A 
et seq.) to prevent discrimination on the 
basis of race, color, or national origin in the 
United States. 
(19) Critical race theory seeks to portray 
the United States not as a united Nation of 
individuals, families, and communities striv-
ing for a common purpose, but rather a Na-
tion of many victimized groups based on sex, 
race, national origin, and gender. 
(20) Critical race theory, and its emphasis 
on predetermining the thoughts, beliefs, and 
actions of an individual, flouts the guarantee 
of Constitution of the United States of equal 
protection under the law to all men and 
women. 
(21) On January 20, 2021, President Joe 
Biden issued Executive Order 13985 (86 Fed. 
Reg. 7009; relating to advancing racial equity 
and support for underserved communities 
through the Federal Government) (referred 
to in this section as ‘‘EO 13985’’), which re-
voked EO 13950. 
(22) The people of the United States should 
defend the civil rights of all people and seek

Executive agency, entity, or individual that 
teaches or otherwise advances the idea,

(C) is inherently racist or oppressive, 
whether consciously or unconsciously;

viding for, or governing the escheatment of,

vests title to an applicable savings bond with 
a State, regardless of whether the State has

otherwise not in the State’s possession. 
‘‘(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), a 
State may redeem and receive payment for

valid claim of ownership pursuant to that 
State’s abandoned property rules and regula-
tions, such owner may then seek redemption

paying agent authorized by the United 
States Government to make payments to re-
deem such bonds, and it shall be paid; and 
‘‘(D) where the United States Government 
has made payment of an applicable savings 
bond under subparagraph (C), the respective 
State shall indemnify the United States for 
payments made on such bond.

PROCUREMENT
CENTER
REP-

processing steps required before issuing the 
solicitation, a Federal agency shall provide 
to the procurement center representative of 
the Federal agency the following:

curement.

cannot be divided into smaller quantities, 
lots, or tasks to permit offers on less than

tablished on a realistic basis that will en-
courage the participation of small business

ment cannot be offered to increase the likeli-

HONORING SILVER KEY 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the fiftieth anniversary of 
Silver Key, a non-profit organization in Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado, whose mission is to 
support a healthy quality of life for seniors, al-
lowing them to age safely with dignity and 
independence. 
Silver Key was founded in 1970 by Betsey 
Myers-Burroughs, Clifford King, and a group of 
concerned citizens who wished to improve the 
well-being of older individuals in the Pikes 
Peak region. From extremely humble origins 
grew a Nursing Home Volunteer Program to 
help alleviate isolation and loneliness for el-
derly residents. Silver Key soon broadened its 
mission to assist seniors who desired to age 
in place, independently, in their homes. 
Thanks to visionary leadership, impassioned 
volunteers, dedicated staff, diverse funding 
sources, and the philanthropic culture of this 
community, Silver Key has helped more than 
half a million seniors remain safe, inde-
pendent, healthy, and thriving over the last 
half-century. They have grown to include serv-
ices such as Silver Key Connections Cafe´, 
home-delivered meals including Meals on 
Wheels, Reserve & Ride transportation serv-
ices, volunteer events, and service opportuni-
ties, and vital Silver Key Health & Wellness 
Services providing a wide array of senior as-
sistance services including behavioral health, 
companionship, case management, and gov-
ernment food program distribution. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join me in 
honoring this important organization’s history 
and mission. I congratulate and thank Silver 
Key and all of those who make independence 
and health a reality for senior citizens in Colo-
rado’s Fifth Congressional District.

RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF EQUAL PAY AND THE DIS-
PARITY IN WAGES PAID TO MEN 
AND TO BLACK WOMEN 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I introduced 
a resolution to recognize today, August 3, 
2021, as Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. 
Two-hundred and fourteen days—that’s how 
long into 2021 that Black women have to work 
to earn the same wage paid to white, non-His-
panic men. Black women are being paid 63 
cents for every dollar white, non-Hispanic men 
are being paid. 
The crossroads at which black women 
stand, between two walls of prejudice, one for 
race and one for gender, are unique and de-
serve singular attention. The toil and struggle 
of Black women stretches over centuries, and 
the acknowledgement of this has been too lit-
tle, too late. 
That is why I am introducing this Resolution 
to recognize August 3, 2021 as Black Wom-
en’s Equal Pay Day. Because the value of 
those thirty-seven cents is so much more than 
thirty-seven cents. 
It is equality, dignity, and independence. 
America was founded upon imperfect equal-
ity, inequality, as we all recognize. But as 
America’s history has shown us thus far, its 
arc of history bends towards equality. 
I fervently urge my colleagues to examine 
the pressing issue of pay disparity that Black 
women face. When Black women are not paid 
equal wages, the negative impacts of lower 
pay are profound: lower pay impacts the life-
long ability of a Black women to pay for her 
education, her health, and food for her family. 
Let this Resolution be the penny that brings 
forth great ripples of change.

RECOGNIZING FOREST CITY GUN 
CLUB JUNIORS OF SAVANNAH, 
GEORGIA 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA

Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Forest City Gun 
Club Juniors of Savannah, Georgia, for win-
ning the 2021 Scholastic Clay Target Program 
National Championship. 
The Scholastic Clay Target Program is an 
annual competition among amateur shooters 
across the country. This year, thousands of 
athletes traveled to Ohio to compete in this 
event. 
In the championship match, a number of 
Forest City Gun Club Junior athletes rose to 
the challenge on the nation’s largest stage. 
This is the second year in a row Forest City 
Gun Club Juniors has won the Scholastic Clay 
Target Program National Championship. 
I commend this team for their hard work and 
dedication in achieving success. 
I am extremely proud to have these great 
athletes and program here in the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia. 
To the coaches, parents, and team at the 
Forest City Gun Club: Congratulations on an-
other year of success, and keep up the good 
work.

SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4502, the Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Education; Agri-
culture, Rural Development; Energy and Water 
Development; Financial Services and General 
Government; Interior, Environment; Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs; Transportation, 
and Housing and Urban Development Appro-
priations Act of 2022. 
I sponsored the 400 Years of African Amer-
ican History Commission Act with Senator TIM 
KAINE. This bill includes $3.3 million for the 
Commission to continue their critical work. 
Since the Commission was first funded in Fis-
cal Year 2020, it facilitated participation in the 
400-year anniversary commemoration of the 
arrival of Africans in the U.S. colonies at Fort 
Monroe in Hampton, Virginia; initiated the 400 
Distinguished Award to honor African Amer-
ican social justice leaders; supported pro-
graming to engage students in historic preser-
vation; and sponsored a documentary film on 
Black economic empowerment. More recently, 
the Commission has also launched a series of 
virtual public education meetings to continue 
its mission during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The legislation also includes a major federal 
investment in Hampton Roads by including 
$83.7 million for the deepening and widening 
of the Norfolk Harbor’s channels. This project, 
while authorized, has not yet received its 
share of federal funds; however, the Port of 
Virginia has already begun construction on 
this critical project and these funds will ensure 
that the project maintains its timeline. The 
deepening and widening at the Port will allow 
for larger container and bulk ships visiting the 
Port of Virginia to arrive and depart fully load-
ed, providing for safer and more timely pas-
sage. The project is expected to deliver nearly 
$4 billion of benefits to the national economy. 
As a co-chair of the Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed Taskforce, I am also pleased that this 
package includes much needed support for 
the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. This 
bill provides $90.5 million for the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Chesapeake Bay 
program as well as $15 million for the Chesa-
peake WILD (Watershed Investments in Land-
scape Defense) Program. I sponsored legisla-
tion, with Reps. SARBANES and WITTMAN, to

create Chesapeake WILD grants to leverage 
the expertise of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service throughout the Bay’s 64,000 square 
mile watershed. These grants will fund on-the- 
ground work to enhance water quality, mitigate 
flooding, provide opportunities for recreation, 
and protect habitat. This funding and these 
projects will advance efforts to restore the 
Chesapeake Bay by the 2025 deadline. 
I am also pleased that my amendments 
supporting essential funding for our National 
Labs were adopted. These changes high-
lighted the need for funding for Nuclear Phys-
ics and Medium Energy Operations within the 
Department of Energy’s Office of Science. Sci-
entists and researchers at Jefferson Lab, lo-
cated in the heart of my district in Newport 
News, train the next generation of scientists, 
advance lifesaving cancer radiation therapies, 
and have been awarded more than 150 pat-
ents. The funding included in the President’s 
Budget for the Electron-Ion Collider and the 
design of a High Performance Data Facility at 
Jefferson Lab would advance our under-
standing of nuclear physics and increase the 
National Laboratories’ computing power, sup-
porting experiments that contribute to our un-
derstanding of matter and enhance our safety, 
quality of life, and even medical care. 
Also included in the legislation is funding for 
eight Community Projects in Hampton Roads. 
These projects include the expansion of rural 
broadband in Isle of Wight; an inventory of 
lead drinking water pipes in Portsmouth; the 
buildout and expansion of an LGBT commu-
nity center on the Peninsula; an expansion of 
mobile health services in Franklin and Isle of 
Wight; the sidewalk extension for safe pedes-
trian connectivity in the South Norfolk commu-
nity of Chesapeake; replacing athletic field 
lighting at public schools and a community 
center in Newport News; the development of a 
Maritime Trades magnet program for K–12 
students; and the relocation of a frequently 
flooded YMCA in Norfolk. Federal investments 
like these are critical to the development and 
resilience of communities in Hampton Roads. 
This bill helps us move forward by spurring 
innovation, creating jobs, enhancing opportuni-
ties for trade and economic development, re-
storing ecosystems, and making necessary 
local investments. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FIRST AERIAL AP-
PLICATION MADE BY AN AIR-
PLANE 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a very special anni-
versary for our country, an anniversary that 
exemplifies American ingenuity in aviation and 
agriculture—two industries very dear and im-
portant to me as well as vital to our planet. 
This anniversary is that of the first aerial agri-
culture aircraft taking flight. This type of air-
craft makes it possible to feed not just Amer-
ica, but the entire globe. 
Exactly 100 years ago today, on August 3, 
1921, Lt. John Macready piloted a modified 
Curtiss JN–6 ‘‘Super Jenny’’ over a plot of ca-
talpa trees. Macready had a passenger that 
used a hand-crank 10 dispense lead arsenate 
from a rudimentary hopper, which helped 
eradicate insects that were harming the crucial 
crops. Crop-dusting, now also known as aerial 
application or agricultural aviation, was born. 
Today’s agricultural aviation industry con-
sists of 1,560 aerial application businesses 
that make aerial applications in all 50 states. 
The average agricultural pilot has approxi-
mately 25 years of experience. These pilots 
treat 127 million acres, or approximately 28 
percent of cropland, each year. That means 
that just under a third of the food, fiber, and 
bioenergy produced in the United States today 
receives an aerial application. Not only does 
agricultural aviation feed our population—but it 
protects forests and eradicates disease-car-
rying pests. The industry’s ability to constantly 
evolve to the technological needs of the nation 
over the past hundred years is why aerial ap-
plicators have remained so important for a 
century. 
Certainly, the future will be filled with un-
imaginable advances just as the past has. Lt. 
Macready in 1921 likely never could have 
imagined flying a massive aircraft, led by orbit-
ing satellites and warned of weather, to a spe-
cific plot of farmland. Agricultural aviation’s 
history is the story of agriculture’s history— 
which is the story of American innovation. It is 
a story of adaptation and overcoming chal-
lenges for the public good. We give thanks to 
the industry and those that gave their lives to 
the industry. Please join me in wishing a 
happy 100th anniversary to this great Amer-
ican invention, and in looking forward to many, 
many more anniversaries in the future.

HONORING THE GRAND OPENING 
OF THE COLLEGE OF THE FLOR-

HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the grand opening of the College 
of the Florida Keys Upper Keys Center. The 
College of the Florida Keys, CFK, is part of 
the Florida College System and has been an 
integral part of higher education in Florida for 
nearly 50 years. 
Over the years, CFK has accomplished sig-
nificant milestones such as instating bachelor 
programs that are accessible to the neigh-
boring communities, introducing prominent 
skilled programs, and preparing students for 
their future endeavors. 
The grand opening of the Upper Keys Cen-
ter will expand and enhance the college’s mis-
sion in equipping the student body with addi-
tional space that will allow them to study, 
learn, and grow. The new center will include 
new classrooms, nursing labs, a bio-chemical 
lab, apprenticeship labs, an auditorium, a test-
ing center, and a library. Additionally, the cen-
ter will also feature learning spaces, lounges, 
an activities room, and a patio deck. 
Again, I rise to recognize the College of the 
Florida Keys Upper Keys Center. CFK has 
provided meaningful contributions to the Flor-
ida Keys community. Many individuals from all 
walks of life have been able to fulfill their 
goals and foster meaningful relationships that 
have helped them advance and enrich their 
academic careers. I know that CFK will con-
tinue to do this for decades to come.

TRITION 
ASSISTANCE 
ACT 
OF 
2021 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 3, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, today I intro-
duced the Emergency Child & Adult Nutrition 
Assistance Act of 2021. This legislation will 
extend COVID–19 relief for both the Child and 
Adult Care Food Program and the school food 
authorities through the end of the 2021 school 
year to help cover their operational costs. This 
bill will also extend the availability of funds 
through September 2022. Additionally, each 
state that carries out a reimbursement pro-
gram, will be required to submit a report on 
the use of such funds no later than March 
2023. 
As we continue to recover from the pan-
demic, many school districts and school food 
authorities are still facing major challenges to 
the fiscal sustainability of their school meal 
programs due to decreases in meals served 
and supplemental sales, and many adult and 
child care centers and after school programs 
continue to need support to feed children and 
adults in need during the public health crisis. 
The increased cost of food and supplies and 
the loss of revenue have dealt critical blows to 
funding for these essential programs. 
The supplemental funding provided by the 
Emergency Child & Adult Nutrition Assistance 
Act will ensure that school meal programs and 
child and adult care programs have sufficient 
support to continue feeding the most vulner-
able in our communities as we grapple with 
the continued impacts of this pandemic.
