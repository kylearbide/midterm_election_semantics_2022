S2173 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 2020 
No. 72 
House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Friday, April 17, 2020, at 11 a.m. 
Senate 
THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 2020 
The Senate met at 3:02 and 16 seconds 
p.m. and was called to order by the 
Honorable ROY BLUNT, a Senator from 
the State of Missouri. 
f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
The legislative clerk read the fol-
lowing letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, April 16, 2020. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable ROY BLUNT, a Senator 
from the State of Missouri, to perform the 
duties of the Chair. 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. BLUNT thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to be recog-
nized, notwithstanding the order for a 
pro forma session today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 1 
week ago, I warned that the Paycheck 
Protection Program was running out of 
money and tried to pass a clean fund-
ing bill. Senate Democrats blocked it. 
So here we are a week later with ab-
solutely no progress. This morning the 
program ran out of money and shut 
down, just as I warned a week ago. 
Even now, Senate Democrats are still 
blocking funding. Every Senate Repub-
lican was ready to act today—today— 
but Democrats have not let us reopen 
the program. 
So, look, it is absolutely surreal to 
see Democratic leaders treat support 
for workers and small businesses as 
something they need to be goaded— 
goaded—into supporting. This really 
should be above politics. 
Five million more Americans lost 
their jobs just last week. That makes 
20 million layoffs in just 1 month. 
Americans need Democrats to stop 
blocking emergency paycheck money 
and let this job-saving program reopen. 
I hope our colleagues will come around 
soon. 
f 
UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT 
AGREE-
MENT—EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, as if in executive session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order of 
March 26 with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 556 be modified to occur 
on Monday, May 4, with all other pro-
visions of the previous order remaining 
in effect. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 20, 
2020, THROUGH MONDAY, MAY 4, 
2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. So, Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it 
adjourn to then convene for pro forma 
sessions only with no business being 
conducted on the following dates and 
times; and that following each pro 
forma session, the Senate adjourn until 
the next pro forma session: Monday, 
April 20, 2 p.m.; Thursday, April 23, 5:30 
p.m.; Monday, April 27, 8 a.m.; and 
Thursday, April 30, 1 p.m. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
when the Senate adjourns on Thursday, 
April 30, it next reconvene at 3 p.m. 
Monday, May 4; and that following the 
prayer and pledge, the morning hour be 
deemed expired, the Journal of pro-
ceedings be approved to date, the time 
for the two leaders be reserved for their 
use later in the day, and morning busi-
ness be closed; further, upon the clos-
ing of morning business, the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the Feitel nomination, under the 
previous order; finally, I ask to renew 
the appointments authority of the 
order of March 26. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.
