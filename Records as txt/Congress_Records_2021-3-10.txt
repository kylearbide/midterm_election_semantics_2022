Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 2021 
No. 45 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
March 10, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, as these lawmakers 
take their sides on this factional bill 
before them, we pray Your mercy. 
Forgive them—all of them—for when 
called upon to respond to a once-in-a- 
century pandemic that has rocked our 
country, upended its economy, and 
widened the chasm of partisan opinion, 
they have missed the opportunity to 
step above the fray and unite to attend 
to this national crisis. 
In failing to address the acrimony 
and divisions which have prevailed in 
this room, the servants You have 
called to lead this country have con-
tributed to the spread of an even more 
insidious contagion of bitterness and 
spite. 
Rather than employing the preven-
tive measures of compassion, kindness, 
humility, gentleness, and patience, this 
armor has been set aside in favor of ar-
gument, disparaging words, and divi-
siveness. 
You have warned us that a house di-
vided against itself cannot stand. And 
now we stand in need of healing and 
reconciliation. 
Merciful Lord, rebuild this house 
that their labor will not be in vain. 
We offer ourselves and our prayers to 
You in the strength of Your name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 5(a)(1)(A) of House Reso-
lution 8, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
VARGAS) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. VARGAS led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
REMEMBERING DR. WILLIE BLAIR 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with my colleague, Congress-
woman SARA
JACOBS, to honor San 
Diego leader Dr. Willie Blair. 
As a San Diego community leader, 
Dr. Blair left a legacy for those de-
manding social justice and equity. He 
served his country as a Vietnam com-
bat veteran; a former congressional 
staffer; and locally as a leader of Black 
American Political Association of Cali-
fornia-San Diego chapter, or BAPAC. 
From 2008 to 2017, Dr. Blair served as 
board chairman for BAPAC, an organi-
zation that strives to ensure the Black 
community in San Diego County re-
mains a relevant economic, social force 
in southern California. 
In 2017, he was elected as BAPAC’s 
president, where he continued his work 
in civil and human rights and used his 
stature to promote quality leadership 
in the community. 
Dr. Blair is survived by his daughter, 
U.S. Air Force officer Deborah Smith; 
his siblings Janet, Trece, and Roger; 
and several nieces. 
We are very lucky to have a leader 
like Dr. Blair, who paved the way for 
future changemakers. All of us who 
knew Dr. Blair loved him and respected 
him dearly. We are saddened by his 
passing. 
f 
TAKING AWAY EMPLOYEE CHOICE 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, last year, I 
stood right here and argued against the 
many concerns I have with the PRO 
Act. Thirteen months later, nothing 
has been done to address those con-
cerns or earn bipartisan support. 
The PRO Act is a dangerous example 
of power for union leaders without nec-
essary protections for union members. 
One of the biggest glaring failures of 
this legislation is taking away em-
ployee choice, effectively repeating 
right-to-work laws across the country, 
like in my home State of Oklahoma, 
where we choose to empower employees 
and employers alike. Where workers 
have previously had the freedom to 
choose whether or not to pay fees and 
join unions, they will now be forced to 
pay membership fees or lose their job. 
American workers and American in-
genuity made our country what it is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1194 
March 10, 2021 
today. If my colleagues insist on mov-
ing forward with legislation that em-
powers union bosses and strips inde-
pendence from our workers, we will 
lose to countries like China, who profit 
from sweatshops and child labor. 
Many of the ideas in this bill have al-
ready been rejected in the court sys-
tem, making this bill pointless and a 
waste of time. 
f 
THIS PANDEMIC REQUIRES A 
BOLD INVESTMENT 
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, a 
once-in-a-lifetime pandemic requires 
bold investment, and that is what the 
American Rescue Plan is. 
This bill invests $20 billion to get 
shots in arms and make sure everyone 
knows where, when, and how to get a 
vaccine. 
Many students are back in school or 
are going back soon. California will get 
$15 billion to reopen safely and keep 
schools open to make up for lost time. 
We have also invested in the back-
bone of our economy: small businesses. 
In fact, economists believe this bill can 
bring us back to near full employment 
in about a year. 
To ensure local governments can 
keep providing essential services, this 
bill delivers over $259 million to cities 
and counties in my district alone. 
Finally, this package invests in the 
American people. Direct payments, un-
employment benefits, tax credits, and 
healthcare subsidies will help lift 12 
million people out of poverty. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting 
for this bill. 
f 
SPENDING 
BILL 
IS 
NOT 
TAR-
GETED, TIMELY, NOR TIED TO 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the partisan $1.9 trillion 
spending bill before us today. 
It is shameful that Democrats have 
disregarded their obligation to provide 
real COVID relief to the American peo-
ple and are instead attempting to use 
this process to jam through partisan 
agenda items. 
This bill is not targeted, timely, nor 
tied to COVID relief. We need to focus 
on solving the critical issues at hand: 
getting vaccines to Americans; pro-
viding relief for our local businesses, 
restaurants, and entertainment venues; 
and supporting those who have been se-
riously impacted by this pandemic. 
Only 9 percent of this massive $1.9 
trillion 
package 
goes 
to 
fighting 
COVID–19, and outside of stimulus pay-
ments, nearly half won’t even be spent 
this year. It is simply unfathomable 
that Democrats want to spend money 
years down the road when we have so 
many pressing needs to address today. 
We have worked in a bipartisan man-
ner to pass five—five—relief measures, 
and I am disappointed that the Demo-
crats have decided to be so egregiously 
partisan in a time of crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill. 
f 
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUP-
PORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND 
CHECKS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, more than 90 per-
cent of Americans support universal 
background 
checks 
for 
those 
pur-
chasing guns. Today, I urge my col-
leagues to do the same by supporting 
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446. These bills will 
keep guns out of the hands of those 
who aren’t allowed to have them in the 
first place. 
For years, I have introduced a bill to 
prevent people from skirting the back-
ground check process by purchasing 
guns at gun shows, and I am very glad 
that H.R. 8 accomplishes this. If you 
can’t buy a gun from a licensed dealer, 
you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun any-
where, especially at a gun show. 
H.R. 1446 closes the Charleston loop-
hole, which allows individuals to buy 
guns before their background check is 
completed. Ensuring community safety 
shouldn’t have a 72-hour clock. 
With gun deaths and gun sales surg-
ing in 2020, we must act now to close 
these loopholes and meaningfully com-
bat gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
these two votes today. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GLENNA 
FOUBERG 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, Glenna Fouberg was a force of 
nature. Her list of accomplishments 
makes that clear. 
She made real and lasting contribu-
tions to at-risk youth, the board of 
education, the Indian Education Sum-
mit, Teach for America, YMCA, North-
ern State, and her church. She was 
named South Dakota Teacher of the 
Year in 1994, and she was a member of 
the South Dakota Hall of Fame. As I 
said, she was a force of nature. 
But Glenna Fouberg was not a list of 
accomplishments to me, Mr. Speaker. 
She was a friend. For 20 years, she gave 
me advice and counsel. Like a good 
teacher, she always gave it to me 
straight. 
She gave gifts like that to so many. 
Earlier this week, I was talking to my 
friend Tom, who said that during the 
pandemic, 78-year-old Glenna Fouberg, 
a force of nature and a legend, had been 
teaching his 12-year-old daughter how 
to knit. 
When Glenna died in January, she 
left behind her loving family and thou-
sands of us to whom she had taught so 
much. 
f 
TODAY WE ARE HELPING MAIN 
STREET 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, today, the House will vote to 
approve the American Rescue Plan for 
poor and middle America. 
The false choice of Wall Street or 
Main Street is no more. This plan helps 
the 
neighborhood 
streets 
and 
the 
homes where real people live and strug-
gle every day. 
This plan is supported by 75 percent 
of the American people. It will help the 
cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, the 
county of Erie; will return the Amer-
ican economy to full employment; and 
will grow that economy by 6 percent, a 
rate not seen in many, many decades. 
This is a good plan that provides direct 
assistance to the people of this country 
who need it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this plan. 
f 
HONORING THE SELFLESS BRAV-
ERY OF TIMOTHY CHADWICK, SR. 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor the selfless bravery and 
service of a member of my community 
in New York’s 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict, Timothy Chadwick, Sr. 
Mr. Chadwick served our country in 
the Air Force during the Vietnam war. 
Timothy’s story is shared by so many 
Vietnam veterans across our country. 
While serving in Laos, Timothy was ex-
posed to Agent Orange, which has 
plagued his health ever since. 
Many U.S. servicemembers who were 
stationed in Vietnam were exposed to 
the toxic herbicide known as Agent Or-
ange. As a result, our veterans are at 
an increased risk of developing cancer, 
Parkinson’s 
disease, 
non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, and many other deadly ill-
nesses. 
These brave veterans risked every-
thing to defend our freedom, and they 
deserve our support as they overcome 
the effects of their service. I will never 
stop standing up and fighting for vet-
erans like they stood up and fought for 
us. 
God 
bless 
men 
like 
Timothy 
Chadwick and so many others who 
served our Nation honorably, and God 
bless all the men and women currently 
serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.

minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this 
month is not only Women’s History 
Month, but it is also Virgin Islands 
History Month, and what better way to 
celebrate it than today for me to salute 
Virgin Islands’ native and basketball 
upcoming star, Aliyah Boston, who had 
another 
dominant 
performance 
in 
South Carolina’s 67–62 win over Geor-
gia in the SEC tournament final. 
Boston put up 27 points and 10 re-
bounds for her 15th double-double of 
the year, and was named the tour-
nament MVP as South Carolina cap-
tured its sixth championship in the 
last 7 years. 
‘‘Aliyah was huge,’’ said Coach Dawn 
Staley after the game. ‘‘She has to be 
that dominant in order for us to win 
these kind of basketball games.’’ 
Aliyah, you are huge. You are domi-
nant. And what better way to recognize 
Women’s History Month and Virgin Is-
lands History Month by a Virgin Is-
lander and a woman making history.

IT IS TIME TO PUT STUDENTS 
FIRST 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, just over 1 year ago, we 
entered a COVID crackdown. Busi-
nesses and schools shut their doors— 
some of them, sadly, for good. Commu-
nities across the Nation continue to 
feel this pain. 
For more than 365 days, far too many 
of our Nation’s school children have 
been confined to virtual learning— 
forced to sit at home behind a com-
puter instead of a classroom. 
The implications of students being 
left out of the classroom are much big-
ger than parents being inconvenienced 
or 
students 
missing 
their 
friends. 
Every day that we wait to reopen our 
schools is another day we look the 
other way as youth mental health con-
tinues to plummet. 
Every day we wait to reopen our 
schools is another day our students fall 
behind. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
allowing 
American 
school children to return to the class-
room is long overdue. 
It is time to listen to the science. It 
is time to put the students first. And it 
is time to reopen our schools. 
f 
A PLEA TO ALL TEXANS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this morning I make a personal plea to 
my fellow Texans. 
I recognize that there has been an 
overload of tiredness and desire to go 
back to work and maybe a desire to 
party. 
Unfortunately, with bad advice and 
political emphasis, the mask order will 
be lifted today on March 10 in our 
State. 
Our State is being plagued by the 
United Kingdom variant. We are still 
on the hot list for the number of 
deaths. We have not reached a certain 
number in terms of lowering the infec-
tion rate, and we haven’t reached any 
kind of level in terms of vaccination. 
Removing the restrictions and hav-
ing remove-mask parties is going to be 
a disaster. 
I make this plea: Wear your mask, 
socially 
distance. 
Restaurants 
and 
other businesses be responsible. 
We are on the way with a rescue, but 
I beg of my fellow Texans, let us not go 
backwards to create more deaths, to 
create 
more 
hospitalizations, 
more 
loved ones that we will not have at the 
dinner table. 
This is not a time to go backwards. 
This is a time to go forward. Wear your 
mask. Let’s be responsible. 
I ask my constituents on Washington 
Avenue: Do not have a remove-mask 
party tonight because you will be 
walking into a destiny of death. 
f 
EXCUSES 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, after enact-
ment of five bipartisan COVID relief 
bills last year totaling $4 trillion in as-
sistance for healthcare workers, busi-
nesses, schools, testing, and vaccines, 
with over $1 trillion in already appro-
priated funds still unspent, with an un-
precedented level of monetary stimulus 
from the Fed already in the pipeline 
with no end in sight, with massive 
pent-up demand and an economy poised 
for full recovery, with the success of 
Operation Warp Speed delivering mul-
tiple safe and effective vaccines in 
record time, with literally millions of 
Americans benefiting from the mass 
distribution of those vaccines every 
single day, with all of these heroic ef-
forts to defeat this virus already in 
place, why is it that Democrats in Con-
gress are so determined at all costs to 
ram through this hyperpartisan $2 tril-
lion spending spree with zero bipar-
tisan support? 
The answer is that they are exploit-
ing this pandemic as an excuse: 
An excuse to force passage of this 
budget-busting monstrosity, 90 percent 
of 
which 
is 
totally 
unrelated 
to 
COVID–19: 
An excuse to bail out mismanaged 
State and local governments for liabil-
ities unrelated to COVID. 
An excuse to use taxpayer funds to 
fund Planned Parenthood. 
An excuse to send stimulus checks to 
prisoners and illegal immigrants. 
An excuse to expand the welfare 
state and pay people not to work. 
In sum, an excuse to advance an un-
related liberal agenda Democrats call 
the ‘‘most progressive bill in American 
history’’ that will lead to huge tax in-
creases. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
f 
REOPEN AMERICA 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my colleague and the good 
gentleman here for explaining why $1.9 
trillion in spending is reckless, irre-
sponsible, and the wrong thing to do. 
We still have $1 trillion set aside for 
COVID relief and spending. There is no 
need to enslave the American people, 
our children, our grandchildren, our 
great grandchildren, and generations 
going forward in more debt. 
We are $28 trillion in debt. This Con-
gress is ramming through unbelievable 
things at a rapid pace. 
This must be stopped. We have to 
give pause and consideration to what 
we are doing. This is a waste of money 
and a complete waste of time. 
Reopening America is a much better 
way to go. 
f 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I move that the House do now ad-
journ. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to adjourn 
offered by the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Mrs. GREENE). 
The question was taken; and the

Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

lowing new section: 
‘‘SEC. 7527A. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CHILD TAX

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall estab-
lish a program for making periodic payments to 
taxpayers which, in the aggregate during any 
calendar year, equal the annual advance

vided in subsection (b)(3)(B), the periodic pay-
ments made to any taxpayer for any calendar 
year shall be in equal amounts. 
‘‘(b) ANNUAL
ADVANCE
AMOUNT.—For pur-
poses of this section— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this subsection, the term ‘annual ad-
vance amount’ means, with respect to any tax-
payer for any calendar year, the amount (if 
any) which is estimated by the Secretary as 
being equal to 50 percent of the amount which 
would be treated as allowed under subpart C of 
part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 by reason 
of section 24(i)(1) for the taxpayer’s taxable year 
beginning in such calendar year if— 
‘‘(A) the status of the taxpayer as a taxpayer 
described in section 24(i)(1) is determined with 
respect to the reference taxable year, 
‘‘(B) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross 
income for such taxable year is equal to the tax-

erly claimed on the taxpayer’s return of tax for 
the reference taxable year, and

TAXABLE
YEAR.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (3)(A), the term ‘ref-
erence taxable year’ means, with respect to any

‘‘(3) 
MODIFICATIONS

during any calendar year, the annual advance 
amount with respect to any taxpayer for such 
calendar year to take into account—

during such calendar year (and the taxable year 
to which such return relates may be taken into 
account as the reference taxable year), and 
‘‘(ii) any other information provided by the 
taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the Sec-
retary to determine payments under subsection 
(a) which, in the aggregate during any taxable 
year of the taxpayer, more closely total the Sec-
retary’s estimate of the amount treated as al-
lowed under subpart C of part IV of subchapter 
A of chapter 1 by reason of section 24(i)(1) for 
such taxable year of such taxpayer. 
‘‘(B) ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT EXCESS OR DEF-
ICIT IN PRIOR PAYMENTS.—In the case of any 
modification of the annual advance amount 
under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may ad-
just the amount of any periodic payment made 
after the date of such modification to properly 
take into account the amount by which any 
periodic payment made before such date was 
greater than or less than the amount that such 
payment would have been on the basis of the 
annual advance amount as so modified. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATION OF STATUS.—If informa-
tion contained in the taxpayer’s return of tax 
for the reference taxable year does not establish 
the status of the taxpayer as being described in 
section 24(i)(1), the Secretary shall, for purposes 
of paragraph (1)(A), determine such status 
based on information known to the Secretary. 
‘‘(5) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DEATHS.—A child

graph is made.

24(k)(3)(C)(ii)(I). 
‘‘(B) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case

‘‘(C) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF ADVANCE 
PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case 
of any possession described in subparagraph (B)

Secretary to such possession under section 
24(k)(1)(A) with respect to taxable years begin-
ning in 2021 shall be increased by $300,000 if

(2) RECONCILIATION OF CREDIT AND ADVANCE 
CREDIT.—Section 24 of such Code, as amended 
by the preceding provision of this Act, is amend-
ed by adding at the end the following new sub-
section: 
‘‘(j) RECONCILIATION OF CREDIT AND ADVANCE 
CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit 
allowed under this section to any taxpayer for 
any taxable year shall be reduced (but not 
below zero) by the aggregate amount of pay-
ments made under section 7527A to such tax-
payer during such taxable year. Any failure to 
so reduce the credit shall be treated as arising 
out of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount of 
payments under section 7527A to the taxpayer 
during the taxable year exceeds the amount of 
the credit allowed under this section to such 
taxpayer for such taxable year (determined 
without regard to paragraph (1)), the tax im-
posed by this chapter for such taxable year shall 
be increased by the amount of such excess. Any 
failure to so increase the tax shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical error 
and assessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year does 
not exceed 200 percent of the applicable income 
threshold, the amount of the increase deter-
mined under subparagraph (A) with respect to 
such taxpayer for such taxable year shall be re-
duced (but not below zero) by the safe harbor 
amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.—In 
the case of a taxpayer whose modified adjusted 
gross income (as defined in subsection (b)) for 
the taxable year exceeds the applicable income 
threshold, the safe harbor amount otherwise in 
effect under clause (i) shall be reduced by the 
amount which bears the same ratio to such 
amount as such excess bears to the applicable 
income threshold. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE
INCOME
THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘appli-
cable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and 
‘‘(III) $40,000 in any other case. 
‘‘(iv) SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.—For purposes of 
this subparagraph, the term ‘safe harbor 
amount’ means, with respect to any taxable 
year, the product of— 
‘‘(I) $2,000, multiplied by 
‘‘(II) the excess (if any) of the number of 
qualified children taken into account in deter-
mining the annual advance amount with respect 
to the taxpayer under section 7527A with respect

assistance pursuant to this section shall not be 
subject to repayment obligations with respect to 
such special financial assistance. 
‘‘(b) ELIGIBLE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, a multiemployer plan is an eligible multi-
employer plan if— 
‘‘(A) the plan is in critical and declining sta-
tus (within the meaning of section 305(b)(6)) in 
any plan year beginning in 2020 through 2022; 
‘‘(B) a suspension of benefits has been ap-

of section 418E of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 after December 16, 2014, and has remained 
so insolvent and has not been terminated as of 
the date of enactment of this section. 
‘‘(2) MODIFIED
FUNDED
PERCENTAGE.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the term ‘modified 
funded percentage’ means the percentage equal 
to a fraction the numerator of which is current 
value of plan assets (as defined in section 3(26)

liabilities 
(as 
defined 
in 
section 
431(c)(6)(D)

such 
Code 
and

‘‘(c) APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL FINANCIAL AS-
SISTANCE.—Within 120 days of the date of enact-
ment of this section, the corporation shall issue 
regulations or guidance setting forth require-
ments for special financial assistance applica-
tions under this section. In such regulations or

financial assistance application to the minimum 
necessary to make a determination on the appli-
cation;

the supporting actuarial analysis and the date 
on which the application is submitted; and 
‘‘(3) provide for an alternate application for 
special financial assistance under this section, 
which may be used by a plan that has been ap-
proved for a partition under section 4233 before 
the date of enactment of this section. 
‘‘(d) TEMPORARY PRIORITY CONSIDERATION OF 
APPLICATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The corporation may speci-
fy in regulations or guidance under subsection 
(c) that, during a period no longer than the first 
2 years following the date of enactment of this 
section, applications may not be filed by an eli-
gible multiemployer plan unless— 
‘‘(A) the eligible multiemployer plan is insol-
vent or is likely to become insolvent within 5 
years of the date of enactment of this section; 
‘‘(B) the corporation projects the eligible mul-
tiemployer plan to have a present value of fi-
nancial assistance payments under section 4261 
that exceeds $1,000,000,000 if the special finan-
cial assistance is not ordered; 
‘‘(C) the eligible multiemployer plan has im-
plemented benefit suspensions under section 
305(e)(9) as of the date of the enactment of this 
section; or 
‘‘(D) the corporation determines it appropriate 
based on other similar circumstances. 
‘‘(e) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) ELIGIBILITY.—For purposes of deter-
mining eligibility for special financial assist-
ance, the corporation shall accept assumptions 
incorporated in a multiemployer plan’s deter-
mination that it is in critical status or critical 
and declining status (within the meaning of sec-
tion 305(b)) for certifications of plan status com-
pleted before January 1, 2021, unless such as-
sumptions are clearly erroneous. For certifi-
cations of plan status completed after December 
31, 2020, a plan shall determine whether it is in 
critical or critical and declining status for pur-
poses of eligibility for special financial assist-
ance by using the assumptions that the plan 
used in its most recently completed certification 
of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless 
such assumptions (excluding the plan’s interest 
rate) are unreasonable. 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT
OF
FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE.—In 
determining the amount of special financial as-
sistance in its application, an eligible multiem-
ployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) use the interest rate used by the plan in 
its most recently completed certification of plan 
status before January 1, 2021, provided that 
such interest rate may not exceed the interest 
rate limit; and 
‘‘(B) for other assumptions, use the assump-
tions that the plan used in its most recently 
completed certification of plan status before 
January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are 
unreasonable. 
‘‘(3) INTEREST RATE LIMIT.—The interest rate 
limit for purposes of this subsection is the rate 
specified 
in 
section 
303(h)(2)(C)(iii) 
(dis-
regarding modifications made under clause (iv) 
of such section) for the month in which the ap-
plication for special financial assistance is filed 
by the eligible multiemployer plan or the 3 pre-
ceding months, with such specified rate in-
creased by 200 basis points. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If a plan de-
termines that use of one or more prior assump-
tions is unreasonable, the plan may propose in 
its application to change such assumptions, pro-
vided that the plan discloses such changes in its 
application and describes why such assumptions 
are no longer reasonable. The corporation shall 
accept such changed assumptions unless it de-
termines the changes are unreasonable, individ-
ually or in the aggregate. The plan may not 
propose a change to the interest rate otherwise 
required under this subsection for eligibility or 
financial assistance amount. 
‘‘(f) APPLICATION DEADLINE.—Any application 
by a plan for special financial assistance under 
this section shall be submitted to the corporation 
(and, in the case of a plan to which section 
432(k)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 applies, to the Secretary of the Treasury) 
no later than December 31, 2025, and any re-
vised application for special financial assistance 
shall be submitted no later than December 31, 
2026. 
‘‘(g) DETERMINATIONS
ON
APPLICATIONS.—A 
plan’s application for special financial assist-
ance under this section that is timely filed in ac-
cordance with the regulations or guidance 
issued under subsection (c) shall be deemed ap-
proved unless the corporation notifies the plan 
within 120 days of the filing of the application 
that the application is incomplete, any proposed 
change or assumption is unreasonable, or the 
plan is not eligible under this section. Such no-
tice shall specify the reasons the plan is ineli-
gible for special financial assistance, any pro-
posed change or assumption is unreasonable, or 
information is needed to complete the applica-
tion. If a plan is denied assistance under this 
subsection, the plan may submit a revised appli-
cation under this section. Any revised applica-
tion for special financial assistance submitted 
by a plan shall be deemed approved unless the 
corporation notifies the plan within 120 days of 
the filing of the revised application that the ap-
plication is incomplete, any proposed change or 
assumption is unreasonable, or the plan is not 
eligible under this section. Special financial as-
sistance issued by the corporation shall be effec-
tive on a date determined by the corporation, 
but no later than 1 year after a plan’s special fi-
nancial assistance application is approved by 
the corporation or deemed approved. The cor-
poration shall not pay any special financial as-
sistance after September 30, 2030. 
‘‘(h) MANNER
OF
PAYMENT.—The payment 
made by the corporation to an eligible multiem-
ployer plan under this section shall be made as 
a single, lump sum payment. 
‘‘(i) AMOUNT AND MANNER OF SPECIAL FINAN-
CIAL ASSISTANCE.—

actions the State has taken and will take in 
order to make all such distributions before the 
end of the distribution period (as extended 
under subclause (I) and this subclause); and

unit of local government as a result of the appli-
cation of clause (iii) shall be returned to the

the State (as extended with respect to the State 
under subparagraph (C)(ii)), such State has 
failed to make all the distributions from such 
payment in accordance with the terms of sub-
paragraph (C) (including any extensions of the 
distribution period granted in accordance with 
such subparagraph), an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment that remains undistrib-
uted as of such date shall be booked as a debt

provided under section 602(b)(3)(B)(iii), and 
shall be deposited into the general fund of the

priated under subsection (a), the Secretary shall 
reserve and allocate $65,100,000,000 of such

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Yarmuth moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 1319. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 198, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 2 hours 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Budg-
et or their respective designees and the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means or 
their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
YARMUTH), the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair now recognizes the gen-
tleman from Kentucky. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert 
extraneous 
material 
into 
the 
RECORD on the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 1319. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as the sponsor of this 
legislation, I am immensely proud that 
we will soon send this bill to President 
Biden’s desk to be signed into law. We 
have acted with the urgency this pan-
demic demands, while following every 
House rule and proper procedure re-
quired for a budget reconciliation 
package. 
The American Rescue Plan is aggres-
sive—no doubt about it. But research-
ers and health professionals have told 
us this is what is needed to scale up 
testing and tracing, to address PPE 
shortages, and to speed up equitable 
vaccine distribution. They have told us 
these investments are needed if we 
want to save lives and defeat this pan-
demic once and for all. 
Economists have also made clear 
what is needed to generate a strong, in-
clusive economic recovery. And again, 
we listened. This bill provides direct fi-
nancial relief to more than 80 percent 
of American families. It helps feed hun-
gry Americans and provides financial 
support so families can afford health 
coverage during the greatest health 
crisis of our lifetimes. It prevents more 
than 10 million workers from losing 
lifeline unemployment benefits—while 
also making the first $10,200 of these 
payments tax free. It helps families 
facing eviction stay in their homes. 
And it expands the earned income tax 
credit, putting more money in the 
pockets of hardworking Americans. 
The American Rescue Plan will pro-
vide the resources needed to open 
schools safely and make up for lost 
time in the classroom. It will cut the 
child poverty rate in half—in half. Just 
think about what that will mean for 
those children and their futures—and 
the future of our country. 
The legislation has been called one of 
the most consequential pieces of legis-
lation in modern history. Well, I guess 
that depends—if you are measuring in 
terms of relief for nearly every Amer-
ican family and hardworking indi-
vidual; if your yardstick is lifting mil-
lions of children out of poverty and 
giving parents the help they des-
perately need; if your metrics are a 
strong and inclusive economic future 
both in the short term and long term, 
then it is easy to agree. 
And the American people do. They 
get what we are doing. They know all 
too well the challenges facing our Na-
tion, and that is why the vast majority 
of them—Democrats, Republicans, and 
independents—support the American 
Rescue Plan. 
b 1015 
Look, this is it. Congress’ work on 
the bill is almost done. In just a short 
time, we will pass this legislation. We 
will send it to President Biden’s desk, 
and he will sign it into law. We prom-
ised relief. The President promised re-
lief, and now help is on the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, rewards the political 
class, not the working class; that 
should be the name of this bailout 
plan. 
When our Democrat colleagues got 
together to describe how to proceed on 
additional COVID–19 spending, they 
could have done a number of things. 
They should have followed the bipar-
tisan precedent set over the past year 
and worked across the aisle. Instead, 
they chose a purely partisan process to 
jam through a radical agenda, putting 
the political class ahead of America’s 
working class. 
They could have looked at the data 
coming out of the Congressional Budg-
et Office. Had they done so, they would 
have seen that, absent any new fund-
ing, the economy is projected to reach 
prepandemic levels of real GDP growth 
by the middle of this year. Further, 
they would have seen that without this 
bailout, America is already projected 
to see its largest GDP growth in 15 
years. Instead, they ignored the data, 
just like they have ignored the science. 
And they now hope that their bailout 
plan gets credit for an economic recov-
ery that CBO tells us is already under-
way. 
They could have accounted for the 
approximately $1 trillion in COVID–19 
money Congress already appropriated 
in a bipartisan approach but which has 
not been spent yet. Instead, they ig-
nored calls to provide an accurate and 
thorough accounting of unspent funds. 
Now, they are charging American tax-
payers another $2 trillion. 
They could have focused on timely 
and targeted relief to support those

that are most in need, to reopen 
schools in our communities and store-
fronts on Main Street, and to crush the 
virus and put shots in Americans’ 
arms. Instead, less than 9 percent of 
this bailout goes to crushing the virus 
and dispensing vaccines. Only 5 percent 
of the K–12 education funding will be 
spent this year, even as Americans are 
told this money is needed to reopen 
their children’s schools. 
Of course, Democrat leaders are more 
than willing to spend hundreds of bil-
lions to bail out States, sending a dis-
proportionate share of that money to 
those States run by their political bud-
dies that will reward and incentivize 
further lockdowns. 
Just look at how they changed the 
State 
funding 
formula. 
California, 
where revenues are, in fact, up, and 
they are sitting on a surplus of $10-plus 
billion, will now get billions more than 
they otherwise would have, a direct re-
ward to the Speaker and Vice Presi-
dent’s home State. 
It was all so predictable, really. 
From the very beginning of this proc-
ess, Republicans have been saying that 
this bailout was never about COVID re-
lief but, rather, about Democrats try-
ing to notch some wins for their polit-
ical base, to appease their allies rather 
than help Americans. 
Amazingly, Democrats are not even 
shy now about admitting that fact. The 
White House Chief of Staff has called 
this bill the ‘‘most progressive domes-
tic legislation in a generation.’’ 
Leader SCHUMER, in the Senate, 
called it ‘‘one of the most progressive 
pieces of legislation . . . in decades.’’ 
We are here today, Mr. Speaker, be-
cause Democrats made a choice, a 
choice to put their own partisan polit-
ical ambitions ahead of the needs of 
the working class, ahead of the needs 
of the American people. When our 
Democrat colleagues speak of unity, 
they mean keeping their party to-
gether, not pulling this country to-
gether. 
That is why we have before us this 
wrong plan at the wrong time for so 
many wrong reasons. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this rescue 
plan. 
I thank Chairman YARMUTH, the 
Speaker, and all the committee chairs 
for this historic and transformative 
bill. 
We have struggled through a year of 
gross neglect. People have suffered. 
They have died. They have lost their 
jobs and businesses. Families are living 
on the edge. But today, thank God, 
help is on the way. 
We included provisions to ensure that 
communities of color disproportion-
ately impacted by the virus get the 
care and vaccines they desperately 
need. 
We included support for State and 
local governments, for our essential 
workers, resources to help our schools 
open safely, child tax credits that will 
cut child poverty in half, and invest-
ments to crush the virus worldwide. 
We will, however, continue to fight 
for a $15 minimum wage to lift low-in-
come people out of poverty. 
I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
California. I will remind her that if 
this bill were enacted, her State’s 6 
million seniors would see a cut of 
Medicare of over $44 billion in the next 
10 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
there is one thing that all sides can 
agree on: This is the most leftwing bill 
ever passed by the Congress. 
But beware. There is no such thing as 
free money. All of it must be borrowed 
from the same capital pool that would 
otherwise be available as loans to con-
sumers, home buyers, and small busi-
nesses. And it will be repaid entirely 
from your future earnings in the years 
ahead. 
Divided by the number of U.S. house-
holds, the bill, for an average family, 
comes to roughly $15,000. Now, that is 
money that has to be taken from your 
family through future taxes and infla-
tion, through lower wages and earnings 
as businesses pass along their costs. 
That is the only way that government 
debt can be financed. 
Government lockdowns have dev-
astated America’s prosperity. The an-
swer is to end the lockdowns, not rob 
Americans of their futures by crushing 
their families under debt that will de-
stroy their opportunity, independence, 
and prosperity in the years ahead. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentleman from Ne-
vada (Mr. HORSFORD), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Last year, as the COVID–19 pandemic 
first spread, I worked across the aisle 
to pass the CARES Act. Passing that 
bill required compromise, and the final 
legislation omitted key provisions that 
I wanted us to deliver on. But the 
American people got the relief they 
needed, and that was what was the 
most important thing. 
One year later, with Democrats in 
the White House, Republicans won’t 
help us in this pandemic. Why? Because 
Donald Trump’s name won’t be on the 
stimulus checks? Is that how easily 
they will abandon their constituents? 
The American Rescue Plan will de-
liver $1,400 stimulus checks, cut child 
poverty in half, and provide critical 
support to help our communities re-
cover and reopen. 
The time for action is now, and if Re-
publicans won’t help us crush the 
coronavirus, we will do it without 
them. 
For the sake of my constituents and 
all Americans, I am voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
the American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Ne-
vada. I will remind him that with this 
bill, if it is signed into law, his 500,000 
seniors will face a $3 billion cut to 
Medicare. So his vote today will cost a 
$3 billion cut to the seniors of Nevada. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, over the 
past year, Congress passed five bipar-
tisan and targeted relief bills, totaling 
$3.7 trillion, to respond to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. These packages succeeded 
in supporting our economy through the 
worst of this crisis. 
Now, Democrat leadership wants to 
spend another $2 trillion on an exces-
sive plan that directs just 1 percent to-
ward vaccines, 1 percent, and provides 
far beyond what is needed to fuel our 
continued recovery. 
States will receive $350 billion on top 
of the $500 billion already allocated. 
Revenue is actually up in these States. 
Supplementing unemployment com-
pensation while small business is hurt-
ing for employees is the wrong move to 
be made at this time. 
Mr. Speaker, in this bill, felons, in-
cluding currently incarcerated mur-
derers, were not exempt from receiving 
these stimulus checks that are in-
tended for taxpayers. 
Federal workers, Mr. Speaker, will 
receive up to $35 an hour, in addition to 
their full salary, to care for a child 
learning from home. 
Why do Federal workers deserve such 
privilege, Mr. Speaker, when we should 
be focused on economic recovery, get-
ting our children back to school, and 
vaccine distribution? That is what is in 
the interests of the American people. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the majority 
whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue 
Plan enjoys overwhelming public sup-
port because it addresses critical needs 
exasperated by COVID–19. It is sup-
ported by 75 percent of the American 
people, 71 percent of independents, and 
60 percent of Republicans. 
This legislation is transformative. It 
specifically provides $1.6 billion for 
HBCUs and additional funds through 
the United States Department of Agri-
culture, which is now authorized to in-
crease its support of our 1890 land grant 
institutions. 
The Washington Post reports: A lit-
tle-known element of this ‘‘package 
would pay billions of dollars to dis-
advantaged farmers, benefiting Black 
farmers in a way that some experts say 
no legislation has since the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964.’’ 
The New York Times says: ‘‘Re-
searchers predict it could become one

of the most effective laws to fight pov-
erty in a generation,’’ and would ‘‘cut 
the child poverty rate in half.’’ 
The Associated Press declares: ‘‘Sev-
eral million people stand to save hun-
dreds of dollars in health insurance 
costs’’ in ‘‘the biggest expansion of 
Federal help for health insurance’’ 
since the Affordable Care Act. 
I call upon my Republican colleagues 
to stop their March madness and show 
some compassion for their constituents 
who are less than wealthy. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from South 
Carolina, and I will remind him that if 
this bill becomes law, the 1 million 
seniors in his State will face a $7 bil-
lion cut over the next 10 years to Medi-
care. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to oppose this bill and 
to urge my colleagues to do the same. 
After passing more than $3 trillion 
worth of relief packages, we find our-
selves finally overcoming the COVID–19 
virus. We have successfully developed 
vaccines to combat this virus in record 
time, and now we see our economy 
opening up and coming back to full 
strength. 
What is more, we have yet to spend 
$1 trillion that has already been en-
acted, that has already been appro-
priated, already been voted on. 
Why do we need to pass another $1.9 
trillion? You will find the reasons in 
the more than 90 percent of the bill 
that does not specifically target com-
bating COVID–19. 
What you will find is a partisan list 
of priorities and bailouts, 27 percent of 
it going to bailing out State and local 
governments that insisted on contin-
ued harmful lockdowns and did little to 
stop the virus, 21 percent dedicated to 
partisan policies that will reduce em-
ployment, and 45 percent of the bill 
won’t even be spent until 2022 or later. 
Perhaps that is why only two Repub-
lican amendments of 229 were accepted. 
The only thing bipartisan about this 
bill has been the opposition to it. 
b 1030 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I suspect we will listen 
to this throughout this debate. The 
ranking member of the Budget Com-
mittee, Mr. SMITH, persists in trying to 
scare the American people because he 
doesn’t have a valid argument against 
this incredible popular bill. 
Let me make this very clear: The 
statutory PAYGO requirements, which 
would cause a cut in Medicare, has 
never happened, won’t happen, and will 
never happen. In 2017, when Repub-
licans cut taxes for the wealthy and big 
corporations, we faced the same prob-
lem. We cured that. Democrats helped 
Republicans solve that issue. The only 
way any Medicare dollars get cut be-
cause of this bill is if Republicans don’t 
help us correct it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. LEVIN), 
a distinguished member of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, as the proud vice chair of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I par-
ticularly want to call out the critical 
relief that the American Rescue Plan 
provides for those who have served our 
country. 
The bill includes important funding 
for the Veterans Health Administra-
tion, prohibits copayments for medical 
care for veterans during the pandemic, 
strengthens VA’s supply chain mod-
ernization, and helps State Veterans 
Homes upgrade and enhance their safe-
ty operations. 
It provides critical funding to in-
crease VA’s claims and appeals process 
to 
reduce 
the 
backlog 
caused 
by 
COVID–19, and it funds enhanced over-
sight through VA’s Office of Inspector 
General. 
As chair of the Economic Oppor-
tunity Subcommittee, I am particu-
larly proud that it provides $386 mil-
lion for a rapid retraining program to 
help unemployed veterans get back to 
work. 
Thanks to the leadership of Com-
mittee Chairman MARK
TAKANO
and 
our colleagues, this bill provides the 
relief that veterans need and deserve. 
To our Nation’s veterans, help is on 
the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Cali-
fornia, and I will remind him that his 
State has 27 percent of the homeless 
population in the United States. But 
under this bill, the CBO projects that 
precisely zero dollars of the $5 billion 
will be spent this year. Wrong plan at 
the wrong time for so many wrong rea-
sons. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill is what Democrat control 
looks like. 
At $1.9 trillion, this bill spends an av-
erage of $6,000 per American citizen. 
What would you say to somebody 
claiming to be a friend, who forced you 
to take out a loan for $6,000 because he 
might give you $1,400 from a portion of 
those loan proceeds? Would you con-
sider that a good deal? 
What if the same friend had already 
forced you to take out loans totaling 
$85,000 and you had little to nothing to 
show for it? 
That is the average citizen’s share of 
the national debt. 
This bill takes aggregate so-called 
COVID relief spending to $6 trillion to 
alleviate an estimated $300 billion in 
lost wages. This is 20 times the spend-
ing compared to the lost wages. 
What is next? 
This is not even the beginning of the 
end of the Democrats’ insatiable desire 
to spend their citizens into financial 
ruin. 
Only 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion is 
even related to COVID relief, while 91 
percent is for pet Democrat projects. 
We still have $1 trillion unspent from 
the previous $4 trillion, and despite the 
efforts of the Republicans on the Budg-
et Committee begging the President 
for answers, we can’t even get an ac-
counting for that. 
The bill gives $500 billion in bailouts 
to failed, poorly run blue State govern-
ments that have only lost an estimated 
$7.6 billion in revenue. The bill does 
nothing to push the blue States to re-
open, to even get the bailout money. 
Those amendments were rejected. 
At least the House Democrats didn’t 
call us Neanderthals when they voted 
against reopening. 
The CDC estimated last spring that 
it would cost $25 billion to reopen the 
schools, and there was $70 billion al-
ready spent in the $4 trillion worth of 
COVID packages from last year. How-
ever, there is no pressure on the 
schools to reopen to get the additional 
$130 billion that is in this bill. Those 
amendments were rejected, too. 
Only 5 percent of the $130 billion will 
even be spent this year. That is how es-
sential it is for COVID relief. 
But there is $12 billion in foreign aid, 
$270 billion for arts and humanities, 
and millions more for the Speaker’s pet 
projects. With $30 trillion in national 
debt, which will be the balance when 
this is passed, we will owe $90,000 per 
citizen. 
How dare we do that to the next gen-
eration. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from Il-
linois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
this is a historic day. It is the begin-
ning of the end of the great COVID de-
pression. It also marks the end of a 
decades-long successful battle by big 
corporations and the super rich in this 
country for trickle-down economics, 
the idea that the rich getting richer 
will somehow make us all do better. 
Wrong. 
Today, we are putting money in the 
pockets of ordinary people, of poor peo-
ple, of the middle class, and they will 
be the engine that creates a healthy, 
prosperous future for all of us. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to say that, under Presi-
dent Trump, we had the lowest poverty 
rate since 1959 in 2019. The lowest pov-
erty rate since 1959 came under Presi-
dent Trump. Thank you to President 
Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this reckless spending 
bill. 
On Monday, the Congressional Budg-
et Office announced the Federal deficit 
has already exceeded $1 trillion in the 
first 5 months of fiscal year 2021. 
Spending this year is already up 25 
percent, and this massive spending bill 
adds another $1.9 trillion to our deficit. 
We are currently enjoying low inter-
est rates, but out-of-control spending

will lead to inflation. In this current 
year, inflation has already increased by 
3 percent. Inflation leads to interest 
rate hikes. For example, in the 1980s, 
the Federal Reserve raised interest 
rates by 20 percent. 
The debt is already at $28 trillion. So 
higher interest rates will cause a cata-
strophic death spiral. 
This bill does not rescue our country. 
It literally puts us in peril. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
January 6 insurrectionists did not win. 
The American Government, the people 
of the United States, won with a Demo-
cratic government that has come to 
the rescue with the American Rescue 
Plan. 
The long lines will stop. $20 billion 
for vaccines. Cash-strapped Americans 
will get $1,400 and extended unemploy-
ment. We will recognize that our chil-
dren will get back to school with $130 
billion. They will be able to stay in 
school. They will be able to regain lost 
learning. They will be safely in school. 
And, yes, a working family, who my 
friends do not know, a single-parent 
working full time and making min-
imum wage of $15,000 will get $9,525, 
with children under 6, and a child tax 
credit of $3,600. 
Houston will get $650 million; Harris 
County, $914 million. 
This is a rescue. The insurrectionists 
did not win, but democracy did. The 
Democrats are on the way to give you 
help. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as the Member of Congress for a con-
gressional district that has experienced the 
worst of COVID–19 as a public health emer-
gency and economic catastrophe, I rise in 
strong support of the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 1319, the ‘‘American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021,’’ which provides $1.9 trillion to take im-
mediate and decisive action to crush the virus 
and vaccinate our people, build the economy 
back better, reopen schools, and provide 
needed support and assistance to state and 
local governments that have been asked to do 
too much with too little for far too long. 
To be clear, I would have preferred the 
version of the American Rescue Plan passed 
on February 26, 2021 by the House, without a 
single Republican vote, but the amended 
version of the legislation is infinitely better 
than the feeble and disinterested efforts, and 
callous disregard of the previous Administra-
tion to this deadly pandemic. 
Mr Speaker, I support the legislation before 
us because it will put money directly in the 
pockets of hard-pressed and weary Ameri-
cans, vaccination shots in their arms, and help 
put them back to work and their children back 
in school. 
The key differences between the bills 
passed by the House and Senate are: 
1. The Senate-passed bill does not include 
the $15 an hour minimum wage provisions 
that were included in the bill passed by the 
House. 
2. The Senate-passed bill reduces to 
$80,000 the phase-out range for qualification 
of an individual to receive direct payments 
under the legislation. 
3. The Senate-passed bill extends the Fed-
eral Pandemic Unemployment Compensation 
(FPUC) only through September 6, but it re-
tains the weekly benefit at the current $300 
per week, and it also exempts up to $10,200 
in unemployment benefits received in 2020 
from federal income taxes for households 
making less than $150,000. 
Like the House bill, the Senate-passed bill 
finishes the job on the President’s promise to 
provide $2,000 per person in direct assistance 
to households across America with checks of 
$1,400 per person, following the $600 down 
payment enacted in December. 
The bill will also provide direct housing as-
sistance and nutrition assistance for 40 million 
Americans, expand access to safe and reliable 
child care and affordable health care, extend 
unemployment insurance so that 18 million 
American workers can pay their bills and sup-
port 27 million children with an expanded 
Child Tax Credit and more than 17 million low- 
wage childless workers through an improved 
Earned Income Tax Credit. 
The bill supports communities struggling 
with the economic fallout by providing, like the 
House bill, crucial support for the hardest-hit 
small businesses, especially those owned by 
entrepreneurs from racial and ethnic back-
grounds that have experienced systemic dis-
crimination, with economic injury disaster 
loans (EIDL) grants, expanded PPP eligibility 
and more. 
This legislation provides crucial resources to 
protect the jobs of first responders, frontline 
public health workers, and other essential 
workers. 
Finally, and very important, the American 
Rescue Plan Act establishes the Coronavirus 
Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and provides 
$45.570 billion in direct funding to major met-
ropolitan cities and local governments. 
With our vote today in support of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, congressional Democrats 
and President Biden are making good on our 
commitment to the American people that help 
is on the way to crush the virus, open our 
schools safely, and build back better. 
Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin 
(72 percent), the public wants and is demand-
ing that we act to provide more economic re-
lief to address the damage caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Repub-
licans and Republican-leaning independents 
believe an additional relief package is nec-
essary, while more than nine in ten (92 per-
cent) Democrats and Democratic leaders say 
more coronavirus aid will be needed. 
Even the most conservative Republicans 
favor more relief by a 56 percent–44 percent 
margin. 
Nearly nine-in-ten of all adults (88 percent) 
in lower-income households say an additional 
package is necessary, while 81 percent of Re-
publicans in lower-income households (81 per-
cent) say additional aid is needed now. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put food 
on the table, by expanding the SNAP program 
and respecting Black family farmers. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put peo-
ple back to work by prioritizing funding for 
transit, airlines and airports, and the disaster 
relief fund. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put a 
priority on protecting renters and homeowners, 
preventing homelessness, and providing $10 
billion for the Defense Production Act to pro-
cure essential medical supplies and equip-
ment. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put 
money in people’s pockets with direct pay-
ments, Unemployment Insurance, Child Tax 
Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and in-
cludes pension security and expanded Afford-
able Care Act coverage. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will provide 
$17 billion in critical funding to help the VA 
meet the health and economic security of vet-
erans, especially as relates to the benefits 
claims and appeals backlog caused by 
COVID–19. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will produce 
and distribute the vaccine and test, treat and 
protect all Americans, including communities 
of color. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will provides 
desperately needed funding for our heroes— 
health care workers, first responders, sanita-
tion, transportation and food workers, and 
teachers—in states, localities, tribes, and terri-
tories. 
Let me speak briefly about another crucially 
important feature of the legislation we will 
pass today. 
The American Rescue Plan Act establishes 
the Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund 
and provides $45.570 billion in direct funding 
to major metropolitan cities and local govern-
ments. 
In my home state of Texas, metropolitan cit-
ies are estimated to receive $10.327 billion in 
direct coronavirus relief funding, while the 
state of Texas is slated to receive $16.824 bil-
lion, for an estimated $27.152 billion total to 
the state of Texas. 
During the Budget Committee markup, I pro-
posed, and the Committee agreed that any ef-
fort to strip or reduce this vital funding is to be 
rejected so major metropolitan cities, like 
Houston, receive the direct COVID–19 relief 
funding desperately needed to battle the 
coronavirus, restore critical services to strug-
gling families, and help save the jobs of es-
sential public servants like teachers, fire-
fighters, and other first responders. 
Let me discuss briefly why direct funding to 
major metropolitan cities and counties is so 
critical. 
The purpose of providing for direct payment 
to major metropolitan cities like Houston and 
counties like Harris County, as opposed to the 
County having to receive an allocation from 
the State, is so that the local governments, 
who are in the best position to identify and re-
spond, will be able to tailor the funding to 
meet the urgent needs of their communities. 
For example, under the direct payment pro-
visions in the CARES Act, Harris County re-
ceived more federal funding relative to the 
amount that would have been received 
through the State program and had the flexi-
bility needed for more efficient use of this 
funding, which was a concern voiced even by 
State leaders over the restrictive way that the 
State of Texas distributed CARES Act funding. 
By directly allocating funding to metropolitan 
cities and areas like Houston and Harris 
County, local authorities can work with the 
community to determine the specific needs of 
Harris County residents. 
As a result, Harris County Commissioners 
Court approved, for example, the following

programs 
to 
directly 
address 
community 
needs, and to get money into the hands of 
residents quickly: 
1. Commissioners Court funded Community 
Programs 
2. Census Services 
3. Childcare Assistance Program 
4. Court Evictions Services 
5. COVID 19 Workforce Development Pro-
gram 
6. Direct Assistance Programs 
7. Domestic Violence Assistance Fund 
8. Rental Assistance Programs 
9. Small Business Loan Program (LEAP) 
10. Small Business Relief Fund 
11. Small Cities Support 
12. Student Digital Services 
13. UT Health Community Spread Survey 
Program 
Without direct payments to major metropoli-
tan cities, state governments—as we saw here 
in Texas—would not have permitted CARES 
Act funding to be used to create or support 
any of these programs. 
In addition, without direct payments to major 
metropolitan cities and government units, 
states invariably will succumb to the tempta-
tion to place onerous conditions on funding 
over and above those required by the Federal 
government. 
For example, in Texas, only $55 per capita 
was allocated to nondirect allocation entities, 
instead of the $174.49 per capita that was al-
located to them by Congress. 
Additionally, only 20% of the allocation was 
made available immediately to local entities in-
stead of making 100 percent of the allocation 
available immediately. 
Third, direct funding is necessary to prevent 
state governments from creating specific cat-
egories limiting eligibility for medical expenses, 
public health expenses, payroll expenses for 
employees in the fields of public safety, public 
health, health care, human services, or whose 
services are substantially dedicated to miti-
gating or responding to the COVID–19 public 
health emergency. 
Without direct payments to major metropoli-
tan cities, state governments, again as we 
have seen in Texas, will limit recovery for ex-
penditures to support actions to facilitate com-
pliance with COVID–19 related public health 
measures or associated with the provision of 
economic support in connection with the 
COVID–19, or other COVID–19 related ex-
penses reasonably necessary to the function 
of government that satisfy the fund’s eligibility 
criteria. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
just a few days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in 
this nation, we need to go big. We need to 
quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the 
cows and count the cows and just move. And 
move forward and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall 
ourselves, and then we shall save our coun-
try.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire on March 14, 2021. 
That is why the American Rescue Plan Act 
is absolutely crucial and the right thing to do 
and to do right now. 
The American Rescue Plan Act proposed by 
President Biden takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American rescue than Presi-
dent Biden, who as Vice-President oversaw 
the implementation of the Recovery Act, which 
saved millions of jobs and rescued our econ-
omy from the Great Recession the Obama Ad-
ministration and the nation inherited from a 
previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Mr. Speaker, to crush the virus and safely 
reopen schools, the American Rescue Plan 
Act will mount a national vaccination program 
that includes setting up community vaccination 
sites nationwide and makes the investments 
necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan Act delivers im-
mediate relief to working families bearing the 
brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Finally, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic, as 
did the videos of the unjustified killings of 
George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Ahmed Arbrey, 
and so many others, laid bare for the nation 
to see the stark racial and ethnic inequalities 
exacerbated by the virus. 
In my home state of Texas, as of the end 
of September 2020, there have been more 
than 760,000 cases of COVID–19 and 16,000 
deaths. 
According to the Texas Department of State 
Health Care Services, 70 percent of the con-
firmed fatalities were people of color. 
In Texas, COVID–19 mortality rates are 30 
percent higher for African Americans and 80 
percent higher for Hispanics overall. 
The differences become much larger when 
accounting for age; for example, in the 25 to 
44-year-old age group, African American mor-
tality rates are more than four times higher 
than White rates, and the Hispanic rates are 
more than seven times higher. 
One factor in Hispanic and African American 
populations being more likely to contract 
COVID–19 is employment in occupations as-
sociated with public contact and that cannot 
be done remotely. 
The sad fact is that most workers in these 
occupations are less able to be absent from 
their job or to have paid time off. 
In Texas, people of color make up more 
than 40 percent of cashiers, retail sales-
persons, child care workers, licensed practical 
nurses, more than 50 percent of bus drivers 
and transit workers, medical and nursing as-
sistants, personal care aides, and home health 
aides, and more than 60 percent of building 
cleaners and housekeepers. 
In addition, Hispanic and African American 
populations in Texas are less likely to have 
health insurance and to have a regular health 
care provider, so less likely to seek or receive 
early care for symptoms, especially in the first 
months of the epidemic. 
And African American and Hispanic popu-
lations are also more likely to have an under-
lying health condition that makes them more 
vulnerable to the effects of COVID–19. 
To respond and mitigate the devastation 
wrought by COVID–19 on Americans, and es-
pecially marginal and vulnerable communities 
of color, I have introduced H.R. 330, the ‘‘De-
livering Covid–19 Vaccinations to All Regions 
and Vulnerable Communities Act’’ or ‘‘COVID– 
19 Delivery Act,’’ which I invite all Members to 
join as sponsors. 
Under the COVID–19 Delivery Act, FEMA 
will be authorized and directed to lead the ef-
fort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from 
manufacturing facilities to delivery to des-
ignated inoculation sites (hospital, clinic, doc-
tors’ offices, school, places of worship, com-
munity centers, parks, or neighborhood gath-
ering locations). 
The legislation directs FEMA to develop and 
deploy a fully staffed and resourced 24–7 ad-
vanced real-time tracking system that allows 
FEMA to monitor shipments of vaccine units 
that can provide end-to-end transparency on 
the temperature, real-time location, origin, and 
destination data, anticipated time of arrival, 
and report on changes and update recipients 
on the progress of their delivery and report on 
changes that may impact expected delivery or 
the viability of the vaccine while in transit. 
FEMA will provide an advanced communica-
tion system that allows public health depart-
ments to communicate their vaccine readi-
ness, capability of receiving vaccines, delivery 
locations, details of facility capability of storing, 
securing, personnel authorized to receive de-
liveries, logistics for delivering vaccines to pa-
tients, report on vaccine receipts, condition of 
vaccines, patient reactions, feedback on how 
to improve the process. 
H.R. 330 authorizes FEMA to secure trans-
portation for delivery or use of vaccines, and, 
when requested, security for the vaccine deliv-
ery sites or inoculation locations to ensure the 
life and safety of personnel and patients who 
seek to provide or receive vaccinations are 
free of interference or threat.

Finally, the COVID–19 Delivery Act directs 
FEMA to conduct public education and patient 
engagement through the provision of inocula-
tions of persons in areas and locations where 
vulnerable populations are under performing in 
getting vaccinations. 
Mr. Speaker, I see the disparities in the 
lives of so many of my constituents who suffer 
disproportionately from medical conditions that 
make COVID–19 deadly. 
They work low wage or no wage jobs to 
make ends meet, and they have no health in-
surance and rely on community health centers 
or public health services for routine care. 
I call them friends and neighbors because 
they are that to me. 
No one is benefiting from the COVID–19 
economy. 
The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a his-
toric rate over the past five months, with 7.8 
million Americans falling into poverty after the 
expanded $600 a week in unemployment as-
sistance expired at the end of July. 
This represents the greatest increase since 
the government began tracking poverty sixty 
years ago. 
In the city of Houston, nine key service sec-
tors, accounting for 70 percent of all jobs, 
hemorrhaged more 1,343,600 jobs, which to 
average folks is another way of saying that 
more than 1.34 million persons lost their liveli-
hoods. 
Houston workers lost jobs in the following 
areas: 
Healthcare: 391,000; 
Retail: 303,600; 
Food services: 267,000; 
Finance: 166,000; 
Private Education: 63,400; 
Arts and Entertainment: 37,400; 
Accommodations: 28,700; 
Air Transportation: 20,200; 
Other Services: 115,800. 
In addition to these positions, jobs were also 
lost in other areas, the largest of which was 
the construction industry, which shut down 
30,700 jobs. 
Professional and business services fol-
lowed, with 25,300 jobs lost, although 13,900 
were in temporary and provisional jobs in em-
ployment services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in 
March/April; and non-oil manufacturing lost 
7,700 jobs. 
Americans out of work due to COVID–19 
have generated 86 million jobless claims, with 
new claims being filed in recent weeks topping 
800,000. 
Millions of Americans who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic have fallen thousands of 
dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear 
warning sign that people are running out of 
money for basic needs. 
If this is not enough evidence of what is 
happening just look at the miles of vehicles 
lined up outside of food distribution centers for 
assistance, as we see nightly on our television 
screens and in our communities. 
Moody’s Analytics warned in November 
2020 that 9 million renters said they were be-
hind on rent, according to a Census Bureau 
survey. 
The Bureau of the Census reports that 
twenty-one percent of all renters are behind 
on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent are 
African American families and seventeen per-
cent are Hispanic households. 
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia’s analysis of persons who were 
employed prior to the pandemic, 1.3 million of 
these households are now, on average of 
$5,400 in debt on rent and utilities, after the 
family breadwinners lost their jobs. 
The new COVID–19 relief legislation passed 
last week by Congress and reluctantly but fi-
nally signed by the Senate restores unemploy-
ment assistance, but cuts that assistance from 
$600 a week to $300 a week without consider-
ation of the facts on the ground, which are 
that millions of Americans remain out of work 
due to COVID–19 public health policy, and 
have been without sufficient income since Au-
gust 1, 2020. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) reported that as of February 
23, 2021, 28.3 million cases of COVID–19, re-
sulting in more than 503,000 deaths, had been 
reported in the United States. 
What the costs will be to our nation from 
this destruction of lives and livelihoods have 
yet to be fully calculated. 
It is a tragedy that too many households 
who have lost a member to COVID–19 are 
struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also 
the friends, co-workers, business owners, pro-
fessionals, students, teachers, wives, hus-
bands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and 
grandparents who also are feeling these 
losses because someone that mattered to 
them is no longer here. 
Each of these lives impacted dozens of 
other lives, too many of whom were not al-
lowed to be present with them during their 
final moments on this earth, but whose suf-
fering is too often overlooked because we un-
duly preoccupy ourselves with only the imme-
diate family. 
I strongly support the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021 and urge all Members to join me in vot-
ing for its passage and to send the message 
to the American people that their voices have 
been heard, their request for assistance an-
swered, and that help is on the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
Texas, and I will remind her that, 
while this legislation provides her 
State government with another $40 bil-
lion, it fails to include any language to 
ensure that the 5 million K–12 students 
in her State are back in open schools 
anytime soon, does nothing to open 
schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, jeez, 
we could talk for 2 hours. 
First thing, one of the things that 
hasn’t been mentioned here is the in-
crease in the income tax credit for sin-
gle people has a marriage penalty in it. 
I bring it up because I know the 
strength that Black Lives Matter had 
in this last election. I know it is a 
group that doesn’t like the old-fash-
ioned family. I am disturbed that we 
have another program here in which we 
are increasing the marriage penalty. 
Second thing, we have loan forgive-
ness on farms based on ethnicity. Some 
people are going to get forgiveness; 
some people aren’t. I think that is in-
credibly divisive. I think we started 
out with a divisive inaugural speech 
right off the bat, and to go down this 
route is only going to create divisive-
ness in America. 
The third thing, to have a bill with 
this high spending, with the Federal 
Reserve printing up this amount of 
money, is inevitably going to result in 
inflation. 
I feel so sorry for young people 
today. As the cost of housing goes 
through the roof, I don’t know how 
they are going to be able to afford a 
house. But we also have increase in 
food costs and increase in energy costs. 
I don’t want to call it the Joe Biden in-
flation, but I am afraid that is where 
we are heading. 
Fourth thing, in the rush to judg-
ment, giving checks to people who are 
incarcerated. I have talked to my cor-
rectional officers about this. I don’t 
know how they are supposed to feel, in 
which they have to work every day and 
the people who they are taking care of 
are going to be getting checks out of 
this. 
Finally, I have had two municipali-
ties in my district, from which I have 
been contacted, in which the amount of 
money they are getting is over 10 times 
what they feel would make them 
whole. 
I think we are being very reckless 
about the degree to which we are 
spending money here. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT), a 
distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I hope 
my colleague from Wisconsin will not 
leave at this time, as he has talked 
about Black Lives Matter. 
How dare you—how dare you say that 
Black Lives Matter, Black people, do 
not understand old-fashioned families. 
Despite some of the issues, some of the 
things that you have put forward that 
I have heard out of your mouth in the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
in your own district, we have been able 
to keep our families alive for over 400 
years in the assault on our families to 
not have Black lives or not even have 
Black families. How dare you say that 
we are not interested in families in the 
Black community. That is outrageous. 
That should be stricken down. 
Mr. Speaker, I was going to talk 
about the American Rescue Plan. We 
know that this is going to provide re-
lief to not only Black lives, Black 
Americans, but all Americans, that we 
are interested in children and in their 
welfare. 
Forty-nine days ago President Biden took 
office and promised the American people that 
help is on the way. Today we take our final 
step forward on delivering on that promise. 
Millions of Americans will be supportive who 
have been economically crippled by a year- 
long pandemic. Most of this money goes di-
rectly to the American people. And, we have 
one of the most generous expansions of tax 
relief to working people in modern history in 
this plan. The child tax credit provisions on 
their own is a policy revolution in the making. 
More than 93 percent of our children— 69 mil-
lion children—would receive benefits under

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1265 
March 10, 2021 
this rescue plan. Minority farmers will finally 
get the relief from indebtedness they deserve. 
This version of the bill sent back from the 
Senate is not perfect. It is the result of com-
promise. Nonetheless, we have before us one 
of the most significant pieces of legislation to 
benefit working Americans in our recent his-
tory. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the Democratic 
Caucus chairman and a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic is a once-in-a-cen-
tury crisis. It requires a once-in-a-cen-
tury 
comprehensive, 
compassionate, 
and continuing congressional response. 
That is what the American Rescue 
Plan is all about. 
More than 500,000 Americans have 
died. Hundreds of thousands of busi-
nesses have closed. Almost 30 million 
Americans have been infected by the 
coronavirus. Tens of millions of Ameri-
cans are dealing with unemployment, 
food insecurity, or are on the brink of 
homelessness. 
b 1045 
So much pain, suffering, and death, 
and our Republican colleagues want us 
to do nothing? What is wrong with 
them? 
We are going to act with the fierce 
urgency of now. We will crush the 
virus. We will provide direct relief to 
everyday Americans who are strug-
gling. We will revive the economy. We 
will send the American Rescue Plan to 
President Biden’s desk. We will build 
back better for the people. Help is on 
the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from New 
York, and I will remind him that, with 
passage of this bill, his State’s 3 mil-
lion seniors could see a cut to Medicare 
of $27 billion over the next 10 years. 
I would also like to remind Mr. 
JEFFRIES that the CBO says that, with-
out any additional stimulus, our econ-
omy later on in this year will be the 
highest GDP growth that we have seen 
in 15 years. So that help of extra gov-
ernment spending is not necessary to 
bail out your friends and allies who are 
in the Governor’s mansion in New York 
or California. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER). 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
vious speaker said Republicans want to 
do nothing to help, which is false, un-
true. Members in this body came to-
gether during an unprecedented crisis 
and passed five bills to provide much- 
needed relief and pave the way to de-
feat the virus. I believe that all of us 
continue to support targeted help for 
those who need it. 
But that is not what this bill is. This 
bill may have made sense a year ago, 
but why would we print and borrow $2 
trillion when we are so close to crush-
ing this virus and returning to a way of 
life that all Americans sacrificed? 
Why give $130 billion to schools and 
not require them to open when the CDC 
says it is safe and at a time when so 
many kids are desperate for personal 
social interaction? 
Why provide $350 billion to States 
that shut down their economies even 
though their revenues are at record 
highs? 
Why send $1,400 checks to individuals 
when the majority of those receiving 
the checks never lost any income? 
People want to get back to work. So 
why make it harder, as we are doing in 
this bill by giving them a bonus to stay 
home? 
The answer is this bill is not just 
about COVID relief. It is about enact-
ing the largest progressive policy wish 
list of all time. 
Mr. Speaker, we can do better than 
this, and the American people deserve 
better. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I re-
mind the gentleman that the push to 
give $2,000 to every citizen under a cer-
tain income level was former President 
Donald Trump’s idea. He campaigned 
on that. I guess the Republicans have 
had a change of heart now that it is a 
different President. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN
B. MALONEY), the distin-
guished chair of the Oversight and Re-
form Committee. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support 
this bill. The Oversight Committee, 
which I chair, is responsible for the 
provisions in this package that provide 
funding to States, local governments, 
Tribes, and territories. 
When we began our work, hundreds 
upon hundreds of community leaders 
reached out to us asking for help. They 
told us the relief in this bill would 
mean recovery instead of recession. 
Democrats answered that call, and, 
today, we are delivering $362 billion in 
dedicated aid to cities and localities 
across this Nation, and they need it. 
1.4 million essential workers have al-
ready been laid off due to State and 
local budget shortfalls that threaten 
the very fabric of our society. 
This relief means that our first re-
sponders, our teachers, transit work-
ers, sanitation workers, other public 
servants, everybody who is working 
continue serving our children, helping 
our neighbors, and protecting our com-
munities as we see the fight against 
the pandemic through to the end. 
This bill will provide local govern-
ments dedicated support for the first 
time since the pandemic struck. It can 
be used for vaccines, increased testing, 
and countless jobs. Cities and States 
across this Nation have lost billions in 
expected tax revenue. This bill helps. 
The Oversight Committee also deliv-
ered a provision providing emergency 
paid leave for Federal employees to 
prevent the spread of the virus, as well 
as critical oversight prevention to en-
sure transparency of this full $1.9 tril-
lion package. 
The American Rescue Plan will re-
build our pandemic-torn Nation from 
the ground up and stronger than ever. 
Everybody should vote for this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
New York, and I would like to remind 
her that, in her home State, she has 16 
percent—16 percent—of the country’s 
homeless population in the United 
States; but under this bailout, the CBO 
projects that precisely zero dollars— 
zero dollars—of the $5 billion that is in 
this bill will go to help the homeless 
population this coming year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the leader of the working 
class party. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin, I want to thank Congressman 
JASON SMITH for his work as the rank-
ing Republican on the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the Democrats 
in the House are excited because all 
their work has even transpired all the 
way to Nevada, because now the social-
ist Democratic wing of the party has 
taken over there as well. 
From H.R. 1 to voting to defund the 
police, House Democrats have aban-
doned any pretense of unity. They 
passed three major bills in one month 
with zero bipartisan support. 
Today, they plan to pass another. 
Like the others, it represents a missed 
opportunity for Congress to focus on 
the real needs of the American people. 
At $1.9 trillion in new spending, the so- 
called American Rescue Plan is the 
most expensive single bill in American 
history. 
Let’s put that number in context, Mr. 
Speaker. If you put it in today’s num-
bers, World War II cost our government 
$4.8 trillion. But if we pass this bill, 
our country’s total relief, COVID relief, 
spending will now total $5.5 trillion. 
This so-called relief bill will end up 
costing every hardworking taxpayer in 
America more than $5,000 each. You 
send the government your tax dollars, 
but you only get a fraction of what you 
pay for, at the very best. 
You know, we warn people on the 
internet about email scams. It is like 
one of those emails where you get a 
promise you will get millions of dol-
lars, but first you have to wire them 
some money. That is exactly what is 
happening here today. 
This is the reality of the bill before 
us. It showers money on special inter-
ests, but spends less than 9 percent on 
actually defeating the virus. But it 
gives San Francisco $600 million, essen-
tially wiping out 92 percent of their 
budget deficit. 
Think about that: 9 percent on the 
virus. But, Mr. Speaker, San Francisco, 
the home to our Speaker, gets to wipe 
out 92 percent of their budget deficit. 
Where does that money come from?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1266 
March 10, 2021 
Well, every American is now going to 
pay more than $5,000 so we can send it 
to San Francisco and give them 92 per-
cent of their budget deficit. Interesting 
how socialism works. 
In both the House and the Senate, 
the only bipartisan vote has been 
against this. And after five relief bills, 
it is on track to be the first passed by 
strictly party lines. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard people 
across the country say this bill today 
is costly, corrupt, and liberal. Now 
even the Biden White House agrees: It 
is very liberal. They called this the 
most progressive piece of legislation in 
history. 
For those who are watching, progres-
sive means socialism, the same party 
that runs here, and now the Demo-
cratic Party of Nevada is the socialist 
Democratic Party. 
So let’s be clear. This isn’t a rescue 
bill. It isn’t a relief bill. It is a laundry 
list of left-wing priorities that predate 
the pandemic and do not meet the 
needs of American families. No wonder 
even House Democrats have said they 
are embarrassed by what is in it. And 
just this week, one of their own Mem-
bers said, ‘‘There is no question there 
is some waste in there.’’ But they will 
still vote for it anyway. 
In fact, if you are a member of the 
swamp, you do pretty well under this 
bill. But for the American people, it 
means serious problems immediately 
on the horizon. 
Consider this: Mr. Speaker, it will 
only be Democrats who vote for this 
bill that will cause $36 billion in cuts 
to Medicare starting this year. What 
they choose to do is cut Medicare to 
those who need it and send $600 million 
to San Francisco to pay for 92 percent 
of their budget deficit. 
Or consider K–12 education. Demo-
crats say they need $130 billion to re-
open schools, but their bill only allo-
cates $6 billion to help schools this fis-
cal year. Two-thirds of the total fund-
ing for education won’t even be spent 
until 2023 or later. 
But don’t worry, San Francisco will 
get their money now. The schools need 
to wait. You have priorities. 
Do Democrats expect schools to re-
open 2 years from now? 
I guess that is what they are saying 
with this bill. They have no plan to get 
children back in the classroom full 
time. 
This week marks the 1-year anniver-
sary of school districts across the 
country switching to school behind a 
screen. We still don’t know the full ef-
fects of this decision, but we do know 
keeping classrooms closed has created 
an education and mental health prob-
lem for students and parents. It has 
been a lost year for our children’s edu-
cation. And even more devastating, one 
in four young adults has struggled with 
suicidal thoughts. 
Experience and scientific evidence 
say reopen schools now. It is necessary 
and it is safe. 
Mr. Speaker, the last time this bill 
was on the floor, we offered an amend-
ment to take that money for that sub-
way just outside of San Francisco and 
put that money for the children’s men-
tal health and others. Unfortunately, 
Mr. Speaker, all the Democrats said 
was, no; that subway by San Francisco 
was more important. 
But, fortunately, we were able to re-
move that from the bill in the Senate. 
But luckily here, all the Democrats 
were able to think the priority is not 
children; it was San Francisco. But be-
cause Democrats are following the de-
mands of special interests, not science, 
they are telling children to wait with 
no end in sight. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud 
the Democrats on the other side be-
cause they put their money where their 
mouth is. They are telling the Amer-
ican public: First give me $5,000. I 
know you have to work harder, but 
what I am going to do—because this is 
how socialism works, the Democrats 
are now going to decide who should get 
that money. And you know what? At 
least they give it to the people they re-
spect the most. 
So let’s go through this. Compared to 
the subsidies for the swamp, Democrats 
want to give Federal employees, who 
have not been laid off, an extra $21,000 
to help cope with virtual schooling. 
But if you are in the private sector or 
if you have been laid off, you don’t get 
any of that. But what they want to do 
is take the money from you, give it to 
any Federal employee, who gets a 
bonus of $21,000, even though they have 
never been laid off work. 
So if you are in Washington, in the 
swamp, you are part of the team. If you 
are a hardworking taxpayer, sorry, you 
just send a bill. But if you are in San 
Francisco, we are going to help pay for 
your deficit. 
b 1100 
What does it say to the millions of 
mothers and fathers who had to quit 
their job to take care of their kids at 
home or in school? Or compare that to 
Title X. This bill will allow organiza-
tions like Planned Parenthood to ac-
cess $50 million. 
You know, Mr. Speaker, for decades 
in this body we respected one another’s 
opinion. We created the Hyde amend-
ment that said we would not use tax-
payer funds for abortion, but when 
there is a pandemic and a socialist 
reign, we are going to charge you $5,000 
regardless of how you feel about it, and 
that is where the money is going to be 
spent. 
Now, the Democrats believe schools 
should wait a couple years to get their 
money, but not Planned Parenthood. 
We have to get that money there 
quick. 
Or compare it to how we fund States, 
Mr. Speaker. We have always had a for-
mula, but, Mr. Speaker, now that we 
are going to do the bill this way where 
there is only one-party rule, we are 
going to change the formula of how 
States can get their money. 
So let’s analyze that. Democrats 
claim States and local governments 
need $350 billion. 
Now, where do they get that number? 
Well, if they read the headlines, it 
would confirm States are not in finan-
cial distress. Nearly half saw an in-
crease in revenue last year. And some, 
even including my home State of Cali-
fornia, they have a budget surplus. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I understand in 
Washington they maybe don’t under-
stand what the word ‘‘surplus’’ means; 
that means you have more money, that 
you actually saved money. What Cali-
fornia is going to get is a windfall. 
Remember, San Francisco is in Cali-
fornia. Mr. Speaker, that just happens 
to be the Speaker’s district, as well. 
They have a $650 million deficit. 
Now, some of the challenges that San 
Francisco has—you see, if you are in 
San Francisco and you are homeless, 
they will pay for your alcohol and they 
will pay for your cannabis. So it costs 
more money. So that is why you have 
a deficit. 
But it is okay because we don’t need 
to send the schools money today, we 
can send that years from now, but we 
need to get San Francisco 92 percent of 
their deficit taken care of. 
Now, we have a pandemic going on, 
and we are going to spend $1.9 trillion, 
but only 9 percent of that needs to go 
to COVID because San Francisco needs 
a lot of money. 
So what they have done now is they 
reward bad behavior. That is one of the 
few places that is facing a shortfall. 
They are actually punishing States 
that did it right. American taxpayers 
didn’t vote for this, but thanks to the 
blue State payout, they are. The bill 
rewards bad behavior. 
Now, President Biden, he hasn’t had 
a press conference, but he did say one 
time, and someone picked it up, ‘‘Show 
me what to cut.’’ 
Well, the Senate actually cut tens of 
billions of dollars in spending from the 
Biden bill that the House passed. 
Now, I feel bad, Mr. Speaker, because 
Speaker PELOSI at first had, like, $112 
million 
for 
that 
really 
important 
COVID subway just outside of San 
Francisco. Now, before that bill was 
able to get to the floor and the public 
found out about it—I guess it got good 
press because they added more money 
to it—it got to $140 million. 
Now, when it came to the floor here, 
there was a group of people—well, Mr. 
Speaker, let’s just say who it was, it 
was the Republicans, they thought a 
better priority was to spend that $140 
million for children with mental health 
issues because we have watched study 
after study of children being left out of 
school; suicide, obesity. 
What about those children who have 
parents who don’t work for the Federal 
Government? They don’t get a bonus. 
And some of those parents had to quit 
their job to care for their children. 
So Republicans thought—I know it is 
a small amount compared to $1.9 tril-
lion—we thought, wouldn’t that be a 
better use of the money? So we offered

that on this floor, Mr. Speaker. But un-
fortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Demo-
crats said ‘‘no’’ to that, that this sub-
way was more important than the chil-
dren. 
Well, luckily on the Senate side, they 
took that out. Whoa, Mr. Speaker, the 
American public thought for one mo-
ment maybe the price could get a little 
lower and that Americans wouldn’t 
have to pay $5,000 a person. Maybe they 
saved a little money. No, no, no, no, 
no. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats 
are in charge of the Senate, too, so 
they now decided since they couldn’t 
build a subway, they would just plus 
that money up. 
So where did they spend it? Well, Mr. 
Speaker, you have got to give them 
credit. They took the same advice that 
the Democrats in the House had. You 
see, they added an extra $25,000 bonus 
for State employees. Let’s just not re-
ward the employees of the Federal Gov-
ernment that haven’t been laid off, 
let’s reward the State employees who 
haven’t been laid off. They get a $25,000 
bonus. 
Isn’t that amazing? I wonder where 
the money comes from? 
Oh, yes, Mr. Speaker, it comes from 
the American people, the hardworking 
taxpayers. You see, they all need to 
send the government $5,000 so you can 
decide where to spend it. And if you are 
part of the swamp, that is a pretty 
good reward. $25,000. 
And then they added $15 billion for 
taxpayer-funded healthcare subsidies 
that illegal immigrants are eligible for. 
Now, you know this, Mr. Speaker, 
based upon your district and others, 
you know what is happening down at 
the border. President Biden has created 
a new border crisis. There are more 
people able to come in, not being tested 
for COVID, but lo and behold, they are 
now going to get subsidized healthcare. 
Luckily, we can spend more money on 
that, Mr. Speaker. There is probably 
much more coming now with the Biden 
border crisis. 
But will this help the people get back 
to work? Nope. 
Will this help students get back in 
the classroom? Nope. 
But will it help vaccines get to those 
who want it? Nope. 
But will it help take care of 92 per-
cent of San Francisco’s budget deficit? 
Oh, yes, it will. Yes, it will. 
It just throws out money without ac-
countability even though there are a 
trillion dollars sitting there right now 
that have already been appropriated 
that can go out to help. 
Remember what Margaret Thatcher 
said, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘The problem with 
socialism is that you eventually run 
out of other people’s money.’’ You have 
been doing a very good job of it so far. 
There is still work to do to defeat the 
virus, but it is clear we are nearing the 
final phase of the fight. For 12 terrible 
months, the American worker has 
struggled 
through 
lockdowns, 
sac-
rificed through closures, and suffered 
through mandates. They persevered 
through it all. And now their govern-
ment wants to take $5,000 more of it to 
make sure a Federal employee that 
wasn’t laid off, a State employee that 
wasn’t laid off gets bonuses. And lo and 
behold, we have got to make sure San 
Francisco gets their deficit taken care 
of. Not in 2 years like the schools, but 
today. 
President Trump’s Operation Warp 
Speed, previous bipartisan efforts in 
Congress, and the American people 
worked tirelessly toward that outcome. 
President Biden was set up for success 
both economically and with vaccines, 
but in that short amount of time what 
have they been able to accomplish 
down at the Biden administration? 
They have raised our gasoline prices, 
so not only are you asking them to pay 
for this bill, you are taking more out of 
their pocket, and at the same time by 
a stroke of a pen he laid off millions of 
those workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I know this for sure, I 
know where you serve, and I know your 
passion for serving. I know the people 
in your district that are getting laid 
off for the XL pipeline. I know that 
wasn’t your wish. It is harder to pay a 
bigger tax bill when you don’t have a 
job. 
It is even worse when that job was 
taken away by your President. 
It is even worse when you go out to 
look for a new job and that same Presi-
dent has changed the policy along the 
border, and now you are competing 
with people who are not even Ameri-
cans; and they are getting subsidized 
healthcare because of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe the American 
public wants something different. I be-
lieve they are proud of the fact we did 
something here that was bipartisan. 
I believe they were proud of the fact 
that because of Operation Warp Speed 
we now have three vaccines. 
I believe they were proud when we 
were energy independent. 
I believe they were proud when they 
had more money in their pocket, and 
they didn’t have to pay so much for 
gasoline. 
Mr. Speaker, socialism has destroyed 
many countries. I just watched Ven-
ezuela offer new currency. What was it, 
a million, a billion dollars is worth 50 
cents today? How did it all start? I 
have watched socialism grow in this 
country. I have watched it grow in this 
body. I see within your own party you 
no longer even fear to say that you are 
Democrats anymore, Mr. Speaker. You 
are socialist Democrats. That is the 
lead of the Democratic party. Mr. 
Speaker, the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee isn’t even reg-
istered as a Democrat. So what would 
you think would be produced? 
Mr. Speaker, whoever votes for this 
bill, I want you to look the people in 
the eye. I want you to think about that 
hardworking taxpayer. I want you to 
explain to them why only 9 percent 
goes to defeat COVID. Why do they 
have to give $5,000, and you redis-
tribute it to people who weren’t even 
laid off? You give bonuses to the things 
you care most about. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard our Speak-
er say many times where you spend 
your money shows your values. Well, 
she does represent San Francisco, Mr. 
Speaker, but we don’t. Ninety-two per-
cent of the budget deficit of San Fran-
cisco is going to be paid with this bill. 
But for that parent out there who has 
been struggling for the last year that 
has had to be the teacher, the tutor, 
the coach, the music instructor, the re-
cess participant, help is not on the 
way. Help is not on the way. 
For those who studied government 
and always thought working something 
bipartisan would be positive, that is no 
longer the case. 
For those who thought they could 
have a fair debate on the floor, you 
take away even the offer to have an 
amendment. And when we do and we 
prioritize the children of this Nation 
over a subway in a district not far from 
our Speaker, the majority party walks 
in line. 
Mr. Speaker, we are so much better 
than this. We proved it five other 
times. What a difference it makes by a 
simple new control of a power that peo-
ple want. 
Mr. Speaker, when you study history, 
there is a saying in a book called ‘‘The 
Prince’’ 
by 
Machiavelli: 
‘‘Absolute 
power corrupts absolutely.’’ The first 
indication to know if it happens, take 
a look at the vote. There will be a bi-
partisan vote against this bill. 
You can wave to me. It is okay. I 
want you to wave to the American pub-
lic when they have to wave away $5,000, 
so a Federal employee that never has 
been laid off gets $21,000 to deal with 
their children being at home. Who is 
going to represent them? Who is going 
to be their voice? 
Mr. Speaker, I will promise you this: 
We will never stop listening to those 
voices. We will never stop fighting for 
those voices. And there will be a day 
that that will be the majority voice in 
this House. Unfortunately, Mr. Speak-
er, I have not seen that this year. 
History will not be kind about what 
transpires today, but I still believe 
that America is a great hope for the fu-
ture, that we are all conceived in lib-
erty and dedicated to the proposition 
that we are all equal. 
But in this body it seems as though 
only one can have a voice, but that will 
not last long and that will change 
shortly. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, we 
have just listened to a repetitive reci-
tation of all the arguments we have 
heard about the American Rescue Plan 
for the last 6 weeks or so, and they con-
sist essentially of scare tactics, misin-
formation, and then calling everything 
socialism. You know, if Democrats had 
a 
potluck 
picnic, 
the 
Republicans 
would call it socialism.

March 10, 2021 
What we say is: This is a bill that re-
sponds uniquely to a unique national 
crisis and it does it in a way that the 
American people believe is the right 
way. 
So I respond to the minority leader 
by saying, a poll just this morning re-
ported that 75 percent of the American 
people support the American Rescue 
Plan. Only 18 percent oppose it. Fifty- 
nine percent of Republicans support 
the American Rescue Plan. 
b 1115 
Despite his attempts to divide this 
country and to demonize the Speaker 
and others, the American people under-
stand that this is the appropriate step 
to take at the appropriate time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
CHU), a distinguished member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, every day, 
constituents in my district are asking 
when the $1,400 survival checks are 
coming and when they can get help 
with their rent so that they don’t be-
come homeless. They are suffering, and 
they need help now. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue 
Plan is a real plan to crush the virus by 
speeding vaccine distribution and in-
creasing access to healthcare. This will 
not only mean safer families but also 
safer classrooms for teachers and stu-
dents. It means a continuation of $300- 
a-week checks in unemployment insur-
ance, and it supports our businesses so 
they don’t close. 
Mr. Speaker, with over half a million 
dead, we need a way to end this crisis 
and help our people. That is exactly 
what today’s bill will do. I strongly 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Missouri for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to this massive non-COVID spend-
ing bill. If you look over the last year 
during this pandemic, Congress has 
come together many times in a bipar-
tisan way to specifically help families 
who are struggling, to help small busi-
nesses who are hanging on by a thread, 
and to try to put more money into 
finding a vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, we were successful in 
those initiatives—in fact, so successful 
that we now have three proven vac-
cines that are out there working be-
cause of President Trump’s Operation 
Warp Speed. We were able to help mil-
lions of small businesses stay afloat. 
There are still more struggling. In 
many cases, in States that are mis-
managing this, you are seeing a dis-
parate impact. 
Mr. Speaker, instead of working with 
Republicans and Democrats, President 
Biden tried this go-it-alone approach, 
to allow Speaker PELOSI to write a bill 
behind closed doors and bring the bill 
forward, not allowing a single Demo-
crat to file an amendment on a $1.9 
trillion spending bill in the House. 
When you look at what is in the 
bill—and many people reference poll-
ing, as if we should vote based on a poll 
that doesn’t show the full story—we 
are starting to get the full story. 
Mr. Speaker, ask people: Do you 
think, with hundreds of billions of dol-
lars still out there unspent from pre-
vious bills, we should borrow $1.9 tril-
lion from our children to do things like 
send $1,400 checks to people in Federal 
prison? 
Mr. Speaker, yes, that is in this bill. 
Pick your prisoner of choice. The Bos-
ton Marathon bomber gets a $1,400 
check in this bill, and we are borrowing 
that money from our children. 
Has that been asked by a pollster? 
I would argue no. 
There was an amendment to strip 
that out. Every Democrat who had the 
opportunity voted to continue sending 
those checks to felons. No wonder, last 
week, 97 Democrats voted to allow fel-
ons to vote in elections. Luckily, that 
amendment barely failed. 
Mr. Speaker, look at what is in this 
bill. 
Is there any money in this bill, by 
the way, to specifically open our 
schools? 
Unfortunately, the answer to that is 
no. 
We had an amendment to require 
that if you are going to give hundreds 
of billions of new money to schools, 
shouldn’t it at least be used to open 
those schools? 
The science said to open schools. The 
union bosses say no. 
Mr. Speaker, look at what is in this 
bill and what is not in this bill. This 
should be a targeted relief bill. Instead, 
this is an attempt by Speaker PELOSI 
to further promote her socialist agen-
da. 
Mr. Speaker, 95 percent of the money 
in this bill for these schools can’t even 
be spent this year, so this bill actually 
keeps schools closed longer. 
Think 
about 
that 
juxtaposition. 
President Biden has created a crisis at 
America’s border. President Biden said 
America’s border is open, but in this 
bill, he keeps schools closed. 
How does that make any sense? 
Again, Mr. Speaker, you go through 
this bill, and they actually inserted 
language in this bill by dark of night, 
and I am sure it has never been polled. 
But in this bill, it bans States from 
cutting taxes, if anyone can explain to 
me how that has anything to do with 
COVID. You look at a State like New 
York that is losing hundreds of thou-
sands of people from gross mismanage-
ment by their Governor and because of 
high taxes to States like Florida, 
which have no income tax. If the State 
of New York in this bill tries to fix the 
problems they have created with high 
taxes by trying to bring their State in 
line, they actually get penalized in this 
bill for cutting taxes. 
This has nothing to do with COVID. 
We should work together on something 
that helps families get through this, 
helps gets more vaccines in arms, and 
helps open up our schools. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a failed socialist 
approach. I urge rejection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time remains on 
both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 141⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Missouri has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished 
chairman of the Education and Labor 
Committee and also a member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the American Res-
cue Plan Act. 
Passing this plan will give schools 
the resources they need to comply with 
the CDC guidelines to reopen safely 
and to remain open, and the resources 
needed to make up for lost time in the 
classroom. 
Passing this plan will help institu-
tions of higher education weather this 
pandemic and provide urgent financial 
assistance to their students. It will 
help childcare providers to keep their 
doors open so working parents can re-
join the workforce. 
Passing this plan will prevent more 
than a million retirees from losing 
their hard-earned pensions and avert 
an economic calamity that would de-
stroy countless businesses and cost 
taxpayers at least $170 billion. 
Passing this rescue plan will also im-
prove access to affordable healthcare 
during the pandemic, and it will cut 
child poverty about in half. 
Passing this plan will protect vulner-
able Americans across the country, in-
cluding families facing financial hard-
ships, older Americans trying to stay 
safe, and survivors of domestic and 
gender-based violence. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
have been calling on us to deliver relief 
and to defeat the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Today, we come together to send a re-
sounding message that help is on the 
way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the American Rescue Plan Act. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE), 
a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic 
day. Among other things, today, in this 
bill, we will be voting to cut child pov-
erty by 50 percent in the United States 
of America. That is just one reason 
why this is the most popular economic 
rescue plan in my lifetime. I have 
voted for this bill three times already. 
The only thing better is getting to vote 
for it a fourth time. 
To the American people: Help is fi-
nally on the way.

March 10, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I just want to make sure. This Cham-
ber may not have heard, but under the 
leadership of President Trump, in 2019, 
we hit the lowest poverty ever—lowest 
poverty. 
So 
thank 
you, 
President 
Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
President Biden and all of the Demo-
cratic leadership for this wonderful, 
historic piece of legislation that we are 
voting on here today. This indeed re-
sponds to the needs of the American 
people during this pandemic. This is 
why I came to Congress to do this kind 
of work, and I am so proud to be a 
Democratic Member of Congress at this 
time. 
This bill not only supports education; 
it gives stimulus checks to put food on 
the table and unemployment assist-
ance. Small businesses will be able to 
reopen and stay open. Then everybody 
will have access to the vaccines that 
will be made available because of this 
bill. 
It has been said more than once that 
this bill will take children out of pov-
erty. They will be able to depend on 
regular assistance to them and their 
families every month. 
I am so pleased that as the chair of 
the Committee on Financial Services, I 
have, in my jurisdiction, $77 billion to 
deal with some very critical issues. 
This bill includes critical funding for 
emergency rental assistance, providing 
$22.5 billion to pay the back rent and 
future rent payments owed by millions 
of struggling families. That is in urban 
communities, 
rural 
communities, 
Black, White, and Asian. All folks will 
have access to this rental assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, combined with the 
funding for emergency rental assist-
ance I negotiated in the December 
stimulus package and the $5 billion for 
70,000 new housing vouchers that are 
included in this package, this bill is 
truly historic and will help people 
across the Nation to remain safely 
housed. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 31⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from the great State of Colorado (Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member of the Budget 
Committee, my friend, Congressman 
JASON SMITH, for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, COVID relief, here we 
go again. The left continues to manipu-
late the English language however it 
suits their fancy, lying to the Amer-
ican people about what is really hap-
pening in the swamp. 
American Rescue Plan? Please. Presi-
dent Biden is dropping bombs before 
anybody is getting checks. 
Relief? Where is the relief for moms 
and dads trying to return their chil-
dren to school? 
This legislation has more funding for 
Democrat pet projects than it does for 
getting our kids out from behind the 
screens and back into the classrooms. 
Democrats 
say 
this 
money 
that 
hasn’t been and won’t be spent any 
time soon is urgently needed to safely 
reopen schools. Bull. Many States have 
had their schools open for months now. 
By one estimate, State departments of 
education have between $53 and $63 bil-
lion in Federal funds to reopen that is 
unspent. This bill has another $130 bil-
lion, but only 5 percent would be spent 
this school year. 
Democrats should stop using kids’ 
schooling as a bargaining chip for more 
money for teachers’ unions. Stop hold-
ing our children’s education hostage 
for your pet projects and your lobbyist 
friends. 
What about our seniors? Where is the 
relief for those who have suffered under 
the draconian leadership of Cuomo, 
Whitmer, and Newsom? 
This legislation uses COVID like 
cheap drugstore concealer, masking 
the nasty truth about Democrat spend-
ing. This is nothing more than a trashy 
spending spree while doing nothing for 
those who have suffered the most from 
this China virus. 
With $1 trillion left unspent from 
previous COVID bills, only 9 percent of 
this bill is going to address COVID-re-
lated issues. About 45 percent of it 
won’t be spent until 2022 and beyond. 
It begs the question: Why would 
Democrats push such a partisan, divi-
sive, and, frankly, unhelpful bill? 
Mr. Speaker, the answer can be found 
on K Street, where lobbyists close to 
PELOSI, SCHUMER, and Biden are al-
ready chilling the bubbly. 
b 1130 
Mr. Speaker, America can see why 
this legislation will be the first COVID 
bill to receive zero bipartisan support. 
Americans know this bill will benefit 
States and unions that have been poor-
ly mismanaged; but on Main Street, 
the small businesses will continue to 
suffer, $90 billion to bail out private 
pension plans, $500 billion to States 
and localities to keep their economies 
locked down. 
Less than 9 percent of this $1.9 tril-
lion goes to something COVID-related. 
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood gets 
funding, pensions get bailed out, and 
San Francisco’s balance sheets go from 
red to black. I have said it before, and 
I will say it again: Planned Parenthood 
can go fund themselves. 
If conservatives were in charge, Mr. 
Speaker, you would see a limited and 
targeted relief plan, while enabling 
businesses and schools to remain open 
and reigniting our economy. Look at 
Florida and Texas, that have led the 
way. Never forget, these jobs are essen-
tial, and the best stimulus package is 
to reopen. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. WEXTON), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, we all 
want to get out of this pandemic and 
back to normal. We want to ensure 
that our kids can learn safely and in 
their classrooms. We want to get more 
shots into arms. We want to put money 
directly into the pockets of the Ameri-
cans in need. We want to restore jobs 
in our communities. 
We have to take action now, and the 
American Rescue Plan is the best way 
forward. Our colleagues across the aisle 
want to gaslight the American people 
on this, but they know that this bill 
has the support of over 70 percent of 
Americans, and there is a reason for 
that. The American Rescue Plan meets 
the needs of our families and commu-
nities right now. 
With this bill, we will finally put this 
pandemic behind us. We will cut child 
poverty in half. We will deliver trans-
formative tax cuts for our families, es-
pecially working moms. This is a great 
day because help is on the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT), a 
member of Budget Committee. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, rescue 
and relief for those awaiting lifesaving 
vaccines, for struggling small busi-
nesses, indebted families about to lose 
their home, for impoverished children, 
and for those who are eager to get their 
children 
back 
in 
school, 
survival 
checks are coming. 
And the same Republicans who de-
layed relief for 7 long months last year 
seem determined to block this lifeline 
this year. Texas families tell me they 
cannot wait for more of your Repub-
lican gamesmanship. Our mayors and 
county judges across Texas, they have 
been the ones who stood alone, shoul-
dering the burden of leadership, after 
multiple 
Trump 
failures 
and 
out-
rageous Abbott interference. They need 
help in providing for our communities. 
That is the relief we will provide. 
Let’s preserve the promise of life and 
liberty for those whose future has been 
dimmed by hardship. Republicans will 
not again deny the relief that we are 
delivering today. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, over the 
last year, Republicans and Democrats 
have worked together on numerous oc-
casions to provide COVID relief for the 
American people. Unfortunately, this 
bill was not that way. This legislation 
is a completely partisan bill that has 
yet to receive one Republican vote in 
either the House or the Senate. 
This spending bill will appropriate 
nearly $2 trillion at a time in which we 
still have $1 trillion in unspent funding 
from previous relief bills. This bill will 
be passed at a time in which our econ-
omy is growing, in which unemploy-
ment is dropping, in a time which 
Americans are being vaccinated. 
Instead of prioritizing public health 
needs or focusing on reopening our

economy, reopening our schools, or 
even securing our border, we will be 
voting to add almost $2 trillion to our 
national debt; but most of the spending 
is going to fulfill campaign promises 
and fund the agenda of the far left. 
We must reject this partisan bill that 
even many Democrats admit is the 
most progressive legislation in the last 
quarter century, and Congress must in-
stead focus on working together for the 
good of the American people. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a distin-
guished member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, people 
often wonder: Does government under-
stand what is happening in my life and 
the family’s life? 
Despite the arguments of our Repub-
lican colleagues that the pandemic has 
passed, that the economy is fine, and 
that no relief is warranted, the truth is 
that more than half a million people 
have died, 4 million small businesses 
have closed, millions of people are out 
of work, and relief is needed. 
The American Rescue Plan will speed 
up the delivery of vaccines, bolster 
testing and tracing, and expand access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare. 
It 
puts 
money—up to $1,400 a person—right 
into the pockets of working people. It 
extends unemployment benefits and 
gets help to small businesses. 
Today, with President Biden in the 
White House and Democrats in control 
of the Congress, we can tell the Amer-
ican people that help is on the way. 
To listen to my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, you wonder, where do 
they live, because, according to them, 
all of this has been resolved, the pan-
demic is gone, people are back to work, 
and the economy has recovered. That is 
not reality. 
This bill will provide desperately 
needed relief to those we serve. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge everyone to support 
the American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. KILDEE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the chairman of the Budget 
Committee, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and the American people support 
this legislation because it is good for 
families, for seniors, for businesses, 
and it provides immediate economic re-
lief to the people who are struggling 
right now. 
$2,000 to every American, supported 
by Democrats and Republicans. Speed-
ing up vaccinations, supported by 
Democrats and Republicans. Extending 
unemployment benefits, supported by 
Democrats and Republicans. Expanding 
the earned income tax credit and the 
child tax credit, cutting child poverty, 
supported by Democrats and Repub-
licans. 
I say it is supported by Democrats 
and Republicans with one exception: 
the Republicans who serve in this Con-
gress. 
Republicans across the country sup-
port it. Independents across the coun-
try support it. Democrats support it. 
This is the time to act. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. CLARKE), a distin-
guished member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Kentucky for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in sup-
port of the American Rescue Plan Act. 
This monumental and comprehensive 
legislation will bring a sustained crit-
ical relief to the American people: 
$1,400 in the direct payments to the 
most economically distressed Ameri-
cans, cutting child poverty in half, $26 
billion for emergency rental assist-
ance, and $7.25 billion in new money for 
the PPP program. 
New York City was the outbreak epi-
center of the virus. We experienced un-
precedented loss and economic devasta-
tion. But the American Rescue Plan; 
Brooklyn, New York; and the Nation 
can look forward to a future beyond 
devastating pandemic. 
No amount of gaslighting, alter-
native facts, fear-mongering, and con-
spiracy theories will fool the American 
people. President Biden and the Demo-
crats to the rescue. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), a distinguished 
member of the Agriculture Committee 
and Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is historic because it buries the myth 
that the cause of childhood poverty is 
a lack of character, or a lack of hard 
work, or a lack of love. The bill affirms 
the simple truth that the cause of pov-
erty is a lack of income to cover basic 
necessities. 
No child in America should be de-
prived of food, of medicine, of clothing, 
or of education because of the accident 
of birth. That is what this bill stands 
for. It represents and marks an ideolog-
ical revolution on behalf of justice. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), a 
distinguished member of the Oversight 
and Reform Committee and the Appro-
priations Committee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, to honor the half mil-
lion Americans who perished in this 
pandemic and rescue the millions still 
struggling in its fiscal chokehold, we 
must end this national viral night-
mare. 
The American Rescue Plan is our 
best hope and the most ambitious, pro-
gressive legislation in scope and im-
pact since the Affordable Care Act. It 
delivers direct payments to families, 
helps our schools safely reopen, and en-
sures small businesses and Main Street 
stay open. It also ramps up testing and 
vaccine deployments, especially to un-
derserved communities. 
This plan’s tax changes likely cut 
child poverty in half. If we want kids 
behind desks, shots in arms, and people 
in jobs, this American Rescue Plan de-
livers vital relief now and lays a solid 
foundation for the future. 
Thankfully, the misers are no longer 
in charge, and help is on the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS), the distinguished 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, as chair of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I 
speak in support of the international 
provisions of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Pandemics do not respect inter-
national borders. COVID–19 won’t end 
in America until it is brought under 
control around the world. The $10 bil-
lion included in this package for inter-
national support are a small, yet crit-
ical, investment in fighting COVID and 
its effects around the world. 
This portion of the bill prioritizes 
global health, providing more that $4.6 
billion 
to 
relieve 
overburdened 
healthcare systems and medical work-
ers, and helping governments and mul-
tilateral partners develop and dis-
tribute vaccines. 
To address the humanitarian crises 
exacerbated by this pandemic, the 
American Rescue Plan provides fund-
ing for lifesaving assistance, including 
shelter, food, clean water, and basic 
medical care. It also provides COVID- 
related relief to refugees, who are al-
ready among the most vulnerable; and 
to our multilateral partners, such as 
the World Food Program and UNICEF, 
who can leverage their other partners 
and their global reach to maximize 
these dollars. 
These provisions would also provide 
nearly $1 billion in flexible funding for 
economic support to help ensure that 
even more need isn’t created as a result 
of the economic impacts of COVID, 
which are already severe. 
It will support our diplomats and de-
velopment 
professionals, 
enabling 
them to scale up and adapt to the pan-
demic, and continue to serve Ameri-
cans 
and 
our 
country’s 
interests 
around the world. 
The Foreign Affairs provisions rep-
resent approximately 1⁄2 of 1 percent of 
the overall package. These funds sup-
port America’s foreign commitments 
to the poorest nations least able to 
tackle the pandemic. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), a distinguished 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, and I rise with grati-
tude and appreciation for the Biden ad-
ministration. This administration did 
not give up, did not give in. This ad-
ministration has become now a symbol 
of hope and help for working class peo-
ple. It is time for us to put more em-
phasis on the workers and less empha-
sis on the billionaire class.

Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, there is this popular 
phrase that our Speaker is known for 
that we must pass the bill before we 
know what is in it. Well, the other side 
also said that you must poll the bill be-
fore the American people know what is 
in it. After they figure out what is in 
this bill, they won’t like it. 
We have looked at this bill. We have 
read it. 
Less than 9 percent of all funding of 
this bill goes for healthcare spending 
to crush the virus and to put vaccina-
tions in the arms of Americans. More 
than 20 percent of this bill goes to poli-
cies that harm jobs and reduce employ-
ment, and $36 billion will be cut from 
Medicare just next year alone because 
of this bill. Over $360 billion will be cut 
from seniors in 10 years because of this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, when the facts are 
polled, the American people will know 
that this is a progressive wish list 
forced down by the Democratic Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 33⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this morning there was 
a really interesting article in the Lou-
isville, Kentucky, paper, The Courier- 
Journal, because yesterday the Beshear 
administration presented to the gen-
eral assembly the numbers that Ken-
tucky was going to experience based on 
this American Rescue Plan, the money 
that was going to go to the State, the 
money that was going to go to counties 
and cities, the money that was going to 
go to higher education—half of which 
has to be used to support students in 
need—and the amount of money that 
was going to go to help children out of 
poverty. 
The way it was described in this arti-
cle was that these legislators—over-
whelmingly 
Republican, 
our 
State 
house is 75–25, and our senate is 38–9— 
were stunned and they were excited. 
One person described it as: the excite-
ment was palpable. 
Of course it is. This is life changing 
for so many constituents of theirs. It is 
life changing for the future of the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky. 
Let me put it this way: We have 4.4 
million Kentuckians—4 million out of 
4.4 million, 92 percent—who will be get-
ting a check, a $1,400 check, some a lit-
tle bit less, but most $1,400, and 1.2 two 
million children will become eligible 
for an extended child tax credit—1.2 
million children. The magnitude of the 
impact of this bill is truly stunning. 
Now, some people will say—and you 
can infer this, Mr. Speaker, from many 
things the Republicans have said—that 
none of those people deserve the $1,400. 
They don’t need it. 
I hope they all go home and tell 
those people that they represent, you 
really don’t need that $1,400. You 
haven’t suffered because of this pan-
demic. You haven’t had to care for a 
relative or a child who has not been 
able to go to school, and you haven’t 
had any extra expenses because of the 
pandemic. You just don’t need it. You 
are a moderate-income person. Don’t 
take the $1,400. 
I want to hear that conversation be-
cause it is not going to happen. As a 
matter of fact, what we are all con-
cerned about on our side is Republicans 
are all going to vote against this and 
then are going to show up at every rib-
bon cutting for every project that is 
funded out of this bill, and they are 
going to puff up their chest and take 
credit for all these great benefits that 
are coming to their citizens. It is okay 
if they want to take credit for it. It is 
fine. 
What we are concerned about is that 
we have finally, in this body and in 
this Congress, risen to the occasion in 
the context of a terrible national dis-
aster. 
What astounds me when I listen to 
the arguments against this bill is that 
nobody was at fault here. At least no-
body out in the country was at fault. 
All these people who are going to get 
$1,400 didn’t do anything wrong. All 
these kids who are going to get raised 
out of poverty certainly didn’t do any-
thing wrong. The people who are now 
in food lines in many cities across the 
country, who never ever would have 
been in a food line before, didn’t do 
anything wrong. 
Who is going to help? 
Do we say this is all survival of the 
fittest? 
No. We rose to the occasion. We de-
livered. The American people I know 
support us. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this pandemic has been 
ruthless. With over half a million lives 
lost, we are a nation in a constant 
state of mourning. Sadly, we cannot 
take away the pain and the suffering of 
our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. 
But with this seismic legislation, we 
are delivering much-needed help and 
relief to millions of our fellow Ameri-
cans. 
In a few minutes, this Chamber will 
pass and then send to President Biden 
a monumental piece of legislation that 
will begin to turn the tide of an un-
precedented health and economic cri-
sis. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI for 
the confidence that she offered to the 
Ways and Means Committee as we 
wrote most of this legislation. 
In the 33 years that I have served in 
this House, I don’t know that I will 
ever cast a more important vote than 
what we are about to do and of such 
great consequence in but a few min-
utes. 
I am immensely proud of the work 
that the Ways and Means Committee 
members did to make this legislation a 
reality. We heard the American people, 
and we went big. We proudly contrib-
uted substantial solutions that will 
strengthen our recovery from this 
virus and rebuild our economy to work 
better for all Americans. The Ways and 
Means Committee was responsible for 
$1 trillion of this expenditure. 
To contain the public health crisis 
and make health coverage more acces-
sible, we are making the largest expan-
sion of the Affordable Care Act since it 
was enacted and which the Ways and 
Means Committee helped to write. We 
are bringing down costs for jobless 
Americans saving them thousands of 
dollars in health insurance costs and 
more. We will also include assistance 
for nursing homes that are desperate to 
contain this virus. 
We are going to help those struggling 
to stay afloat by putting cash in their 
pockets and simultaneously creating 
liquidity and demand. For the jobless, 
we extend Federal unemployment ben-
efits to keep them afloat for the better 
days that lie ahead. 
We have made three key tax credits 
for low- and middle-income workers 
and families more generous, more flexi-
ble, and more capable of tackling the 
inequality and concentrated wealth 
that exists in our country. We already 
know that a key to our recovery will 
be giving parents the tools to go back 
to work even though their previous 
childcare may have been upended. We 
will ease their worries by making 
childcare more accessible and indeed 
more affordable. 
The child tax credit will lift millions 
out of poverty, and the expanded 
earned-income 
tax 
credit 
will 
put 
money into the pockets of the lowest- 
income workers. 
Mr. Speaker, listen to this following 
statistic: All in all, there will be an in-
crease in aftertax income for the poor-
est 20 percent of Americans by increas-
ing their income by 20 percent. That is 
a staggering achievement. It is a life- 
changing achievement. 
Lastly, we also made a long overdue 
fix to multiemployer pension programs 
that will protect hard-earned savings 
of workers, many of whom have been 
on the front lines of this crisis. These

are people who have played by the 
rules, served our country in the mili-
tary, and worked day in and day out 
with the promise of a secure retire-
ment not to have it pulled from under 
them. I would remind all that 30 Re-
publicans on two separate occasions 
have voted for this bill as a standalone 
measure. 
I heard a previous speaker say: This 
is a bailout. It is a backstop. 
In addition, perhaps that individual 
didn’t understand the PBGC, because if 
we didn’t come to the support of these 
pensions, it would take down the Pen-
sion 
Benefit 
Guaranty 
Corporation 
which insures all pensions for Ameri-
cans in the private sector. 
I cannot stress enough—these provi-
sions are going to change lives. We are 
not creating a narrative talking about 
changing lives, we are going to do it 
with this legislation. 
We are doing the right thing, not 
only because of what we have been say-
ing that we would do for years—this is 
the moment—but this legislation has 
the support of economists from the 
left, the right, and the center. This is 
about the power of ideas. But because 
it is what the American people want 
also, let me be clear: the American 
people, regardless of political affili-
ation, overwhelmingly support this 
package because they know what is in 
it is badly needed to get to the other 
side of the crisis. 
I regret that the overwhelming sup-
port that I have just described has not 
been translated into unity in this 
Chamber. This is bipartisan in America 
even if it is not bipartisan in this 
Chamber. 
Our colleagues on the other side have 
deemed workers who saw their entire 
industries evaporate perhaps unworthy 
of this moment. They have deemed 
working parents perhaps unworthy of 
this moment, and they have deemed 
the working- and middle-class Amer-
ican family perhaps at this moment 
unworthy. 
I don’t understand it. 
Instead, there has been a lot of talk 
about this package being too large and 
too expensive. But if there was ever a 
time to go big, this should be it. 
Shouldn’t helping struggling Amer-
ican families be worth the size of this 
bill? 
I seem to recall that my colleagues 
found that wealthy Americans and big 
corporations were worth the size of 
their tax cut. So why not working- and 
middle-class families who are facing a 
health and economic crisis unlike any-
thing the Nation has experienced in 
more than a century? 
I actually have some charts that I 
think highlight the difference today. 
We have two comparisons of who bene-
fits from the American Rescue Plan 
and who benefited in the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act. This is pretty apparent and 
pretty obvious to all who might discern 
in this moment. 
As you can see, Mr. Speaker, the ben-
efits that my colleagues across the 
aisle will oppose today go directly to 
working-class Americans. 
However, with the next chart, Mr. 
Speaker, you can look at their pack-
age, and it was nearly the same size. 
By the way, they borrowed $2.3 trillion 
for it. It had overwhelming support 
from their side of the aisle. But look 
who the benefits went to. The evidence 
is overwhelming as to who the benefits 
went to. 
This package is nearly the same size 
as what they did, but the impact of 
what we are about to do will be ex-
traordinary. 
Multiple reports have highlighted 
how the tax cuts bill did not, as pro-
ponents claimed, grow the economy or 
indeed—the great hoax—pay for itself. 
That never happened. Yet they con-
tinue to stand behind a law that put 
the powerful and the wealthy first, and 
they dismiss what we are about to do 
today. 
Hardworking Americans have been 
for too long left behind, and that ends 
today. This bill will save lives and live-
lihoods. We will help families stay 
housed, put food on the table, and ac-
cess affordable healthcare. Most impor-
tantly, this package will help families 
avoid impossible choices. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to 
rise to this moment and support this 
important legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1200 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
my friend and my chairman, who I 
have great respect for, Mr. NEAL, that 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was one of 
the pivotal successes of the Trump ad-
ministration that led to the lowest 
poverty among all Americans that had 
existed in decades, if not ever, and the 
strongest economy and lowest unem-
ployment 
among 
all 
demographic 
groups. 
Whereas, this plan, this so-called 
COVID relief plan, is not, in fact, a 
COVID relief plan at all. By far, most 
of the money goes to creating new enti-
tlement programs. You see, my friends 
on the other side of the aisle are more 
concerned with making the American 
people rely on government programs 
than they are on creating opportunity 
for them to lift themselves up. 
Mr. Speaker, if you operate a small 
business trying to get people to come 
back to work, if you are a frontline 
worker eager to be vaccinated and hop-
ing this plan will speed that up, if you 
are a family attempting to educate 
your children while schools refuse to 
open, this bill won’t help you. It leaves 
you behind. 
My friend, Mr. CLYBURN, said last 
year that this COVID pandemic created 
a great opportunity for Democrats to 
mold things to their vision. Boy, are 
they delivering. 
My friends on the other side say this 
bill is popular, and I don’t doubt it is. 
I mean, it is certainly good politics to 
say: Hey, we are going to hand you a 
check for $1,400. Just help us get this 
across the line, and we will give you a 
check. 
But what they don’t talk about is 
what this bill costs. You see, $1.9 tril-
lion is $5,487 for every man, woman, 
and child in this country—$5,500 for 
every man, woman, and child. 
What these guys want to do is have 
the government borrow $5,500 in your 
name, and not just your name, your 
wife’s or your husband’s name and each 
of your kids’ names. $5,500 they are 
going through in the kitty, but they 
are going to give you $1,400 of it back, 
so vote for this bill. 
I think we should look a little fur-
ther than that. I think we should look 
maybe at where the other $4,100 that 
they are borrowing in your name goes. 
Guess what? That money is going to 
have to be paid back. It is going to be 
paid back in higher taxes. It is going to 
be paid back in lower productivity. It 
is going to be paid back in lower gov-
ernment services. It is going to be paid 
back in less opportunity for your chil-
dren and your grandchildren. 
Let’s look at where this $4,100 goes. 
$750 of your $4,100 that they are bor-
rowing in your name and each of your 
kids’ names goes to paying extra unem-
ployment for people to stay home. In 
fact, it pays people more unemploy-
ment than they can make at work, in 
most cases. 
To bail out union pension plans that 
are chronically underfunded—and this 
problem needs to be fixed, but this plan 
does nothing to fix the problem. They 
will continue to be chronically under-
funded. $177 of your $4,100 they are bor-
rowing in your name and not giving 
back to you goes to bail out union pen-
sion plans. 
$1,067 of your $4,100 that they are bor-
rowing in your name and not giving 
back to you goes to bail out blue 
States. In the prior plans, we already 
had money to help States. A lot of the 
money hadn’t been spent from the 
prior plans that we had. But they 
changed the allocation formula in this 
plan. 
It was based on population, so every 
State was treated fairly. But that is 
not good enough for places like Cali-
fornia and New York that are shut 
down. So they said: I know. Let’s add 
unemployment in there because our 
Governors have shut our States down, 
and our unemployment is higher, and 
we want more money. We want to take 
money from places like Florida, Geor-
gia, South Carolina, and other States 
in the Midwest that stayed open, and 
we want to redirect it to California and 
New York. 
So, they threw in unemployment as a 
criteria. South Carolina, my home 
State, is the third biggest loser. Flor-
ida is the biggest loser. We lose over $1 
billion, and $5.4 billion extra goes to 
rich California. That is $1,067 each of 
your money. 
K–12 education, colleges, and univer-
sities get $500 of your money that they

are borrowing in your name. But guess 
what? We know you want to send your 
kids back to school, but they don’t re-
quire that the schools actually open. 
Schools are sitting there closed. 
They are still getting your property 
taxes. They are still getting all the 
property taxes that normally fund you. 
But they are going to send them an-
other $500 of your money but not re-
quire that those schools open. 
$34 of your money goes to museums 
and Native language preservation. You 
are spending $34 of your $4,100 on that. 
Public health organizations, includ-
ing Planned Parenthood, get $58 of 
your money that they are borrowing in 
your name and your kids’ money that 
they are borrowing in their names. It 
goes to Planned Parenthood. 
Transportation grants, $128. 
Agriculture includes socially dis-
advantaged farmers. What does that 
mean, people who have historically 
been 
socially 
disadvantaged? 
That 
means if you are a White farmer, don’t 
apply. 
Foreign aid gets $30. 
Then, I am lumping all the other pro-
gressive priorities of $1,279, and with a 
direct check of $1,400, it adds up to 
$5,487. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill has had an ab-
surd lack of bipartisanship. My chair-
man, my friend that I respect, says 
that the Ways and Means Committee 
created this bill. We didn’t create this 
bill. Madam PELOSI uses COVID as an 
excuse to keep us out of town so she 
can write this liberal grab bag. 
We had no hearings on this bill. When 
we marked it up, there were dozens of 
amendments offered. Not one single 
amendment was accepted. This is an 
absolute ram job by the Democrats of a 
menu of liberal priorities. 
Mr. Speaker, we can do better. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the 
chairman of the Select Revenue Meas-
ures Subcommittee, which plays a cen-
tral role in tax policy. And repeatedly, 
he assures me that he is of modest in-
come and from California. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
legislation. 
This bill is one of the most con-
sequential policies considered by this 
body during my time in Congress. 
From top to bottom, it provides strug-
gling Americans with the relief that 
they need. 
It provides critical healthcare fund-
ing to help crush the virus, including 
funds to continue ramping up vaccina-
tions. 
It provides funds to help small busi-
nesses stay afloat, to help restaurants 
keep their lights on, to help families 
afford health insurance, to keep work-
ers employed, and to help kids get back 
into school. 
It bolsters State and local govern-
ments and provides emergency assist-
ance to the millions of Americans be-
hind on rent. On top of that, this bill is 
projected to cut child poverty in this 
country in half. 
This is an excellent bill, and I thank 
my colleagues, the chairman, espe-
cially, and our partners in the adminis-
tration for swiftly bringing this crit-
ical relief to the floor. 
The American people know that help 
is on the way. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER). 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak against 
H.R. 1319, PELOSI’s progressive payoff, 
and in support of America’s gig econ-
omy. 
Not only is this a costly bill full of 
liberal wish-list items that do nothing 
to crush COVID or create jobs, but it 
also stifles America’s gig economy at a 
time when it needs our support the 
most. 
The gig economy provides flexibility 
and opportunity to businesses, work-
ers, and customers in urban and rural 
areas. The success of America’s gig 
economy is due to the absence of gov-
ernment overregulation. 
Let’s take a lesson from the gig econ-
omy that has flourished and scale our 
response around demand rather than 
regulation. 
I am giving this bill one star. Our gig 
economy workers and customers de-
serve the freedom to work and to 
thrive. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), my friend and 
chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, let me, first of all, try to re-
spond so the American people will 
know that this money, this $1.9 tril-
lion, is going to help our Nation sur-
vive COVID–19. It is not just a disease 
that is out there. It is a disease that 
has impacted our people. 
Let me tell you what is in this bill: 
$800 million for food. 
Don’t you all know we have a hunger 
crisis? Don’t you know that the Amer-
ican people are hungry? They are in 
record lines—you see them—miles long 
every day, trying to get food. 
It has $800 million for food for 
women, infants, and children. We have 
13 million of our children and infants 
going to bed hungry and malnourished 
every single night. You know why? Be-
cause of COVID. Employment is down; 
our folks don’t have the money to get 
the food. 
Mr. Speaker, this is why our Agri-
culture Committee is having hearings 
tomorrow to address hunger, to see 
what else we need to do. 
And I must respond to this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 10 seconds to the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. He 
brought up the issue of the Black farm-
ers. It is important for you to know 
that our Black farmers were not in-
cluded in the other pieces, so we got 
them $4 billion just to help them and 
technical assistance. America needs 
this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the gentleman 
that, due to the enormity of this bill, if 
$800 million of this bill goes to food as-
sistance, that represents less than one 
one-thousandths of the total. That is a 
very tiny, small fraction. 
And the prior bills were done in a bi-
partisan fashion. I am certain we could 
have worked in a bipartisan fashion if 
there was any attempt to do that. But, 
in fact, this is just a ram job by the lib-
erals to push through a vastly expand-
ing entitlement system. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people deserve the truth. 
Over the past year, Republican and 
Democrat lawmakers have worked to-
gether to provide temporary and tar-
geted assistance to the American peo-
ple. Five times, we passed bipartisan 
legislation, totaling $4 trillion, to help 
families get back on their feet and our 
country get back to work. 
Which begs the question, Mr. Speak-
er: Why now are Democrats, who con-
trol Congress and control the White 
House, abandoning bipartisanship to 
jam through this partisan legislation 
without a single Republican vote? 
I will tell you why. It is because this 
is not COVID relief. It is a $2 trillion 
blue State boondoggle and a Trojan 
horse for their reckless partisan poli-
cies. 
It is because Speaker PELOSI
is 
throwing your tax dollars at Democrat 
cronies like a float captain throws 
beads at a Mardi Gras parade: bailouts 
for union pensions, bailouts for cash- 
flush States like California, bailouts 
for schools that still refuse to open 
their doors to struggling students. 
This 
massive 
spending 
bill, 
masquerading as COVID relief, will 
bankrupt the country. It will not res-
cue the country. It will bankrupt it 
and saddle our children with insur-
mountable debt. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this bill. 
b 1215 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Trade and a valued 
senior member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s comments 
moments ago. 
This is historic legislation dealing 
with priorities long neglected. The 
charts that he presented tell it all.

March 10, 2021 
The Republicans, with their $1.7 tril-
lion tax cut, primarily for people who 
didn’t need it, versus our priorities, 
dealing with making a major impact on 
child poverty, dealing with health, 
dealing with our local governments 
being able to survive. This is a reflec-
tion of Democratic values, and the dif-
ference it makes is stark. 
I am proud to vote in favor of this re-
covery act. I am proud of what it is 
going to do for people who need it 
most. The contrast between Demo-
cratic priorities and what the Repub-
licans did when they used reconcili-
ation could not be more stark. 
I appreciate the gentleman illus-
trating it, and I hope that the House 
will approve this measure. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I agree that the priorities could not 
be more stark, when the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act led to the most successful 
economy in decades, if not ever, and 
the lowest unemployment among Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics, and women 
in the history of the United States. 
Whereas, this bill just represents a 
massive expansion of our entitlement 
system. 
Our priorities are to get people to 
work. The Democrats’ priorities are to 
get people hooked on the government, 
to make them reliant on government 
checks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose this solely Democrat 
payoff spending bill. 
I will agree with my colleagues, it is 
historic. I agree with my colleagues, it 
is consequential. There is no doubt 
about it. I am sure that with $1.9 tril-
lion, somebody will be helped. I am 
quite sure of that. But the next genera-
tion of Americans are not going to be 
thankful. 
Let’s be honest with the American 
people. This is not a COVID relief bill. 
Members of this body came together 
four times last Congress and passed 
legislation that actually provided re-
lief to our constituents. This bill is so 
incredibly far away from that, as Re-
publicans have been completely frozen 
out of this process. 
Mr. Speaker, what is the result? Only 
9 percent goes towards defeating the 
virus. 
$1.5 billion for Amtrak, which is al-
ready sitting on $1 billion in unspent 
aid. Maybe riding Amtrak is a good 
place to socially distance. Maybe that 
is the reason. 
$50 million for environmental justice 
grants, Mr. Speaker. That doesn’t edu-
cate our children. 
Roughly $1 trillion on other liberal 
pet projects, when we have $1 trillion 
from the previous bipartisan bills that 
has been left unspent. 
Can someone explain what that has 
to do with COVID relief? Anybody? 
If Members are serious about directly 
addressing the medical and economic 
challenges our country faces, like get-
ting businesses open, getting students 
back to school, getting vaccines to 
Americans who want them, I will work 
with anyone in this body to do so. You 
know Republicans will, because we did 
several times until Democrats ignored 
us this Congress. 
Please, let’s not pretend this bill is 
about COVID relief. That simply is not 
true. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON), chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Social Security and 
tireless champion of ensuring the de-
livery of stimulus checks to low-in-
come retirees. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank President 
Biden for his science-based efforts in 
defeating this virus and his unrelenting 
focus on putting American families 
back on their feet. 
The American Rescue Plan meets the 
moment and fulfills that old adage that 
help is on the way. 
This bill gets shots into arms, money 
into people’s pockets, and provides 
their communities, and especially our 
schools, with the relief that they need. 
In Connecticut, 1.5 million working 
families will receive $4 billion. This re-
lief is felt by those families—I say to 
my colleagues—as those families sit at 
the kitchen table and look across at 
each other and talk about their day-to- 
day needs and what needs to be met, 
Mr. Speaker. 
And so this bipartisan relief package 
that we have put forward—and I say bi-
partisan, because when you talk to the 
general public and when you talk to 
the people that need this relief di-
rectly, you see that more than 70 per-
cent of Democrats, Republicans, and 
the unaffiliated support this bill. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, what my friends across the 
aisle are saying is: Here is your $1,400 
check, but don’t look at what I am 
doing behind your back with the other 
$5,500 I am borrowing in your name and 
in the names of each of your children. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
REED). 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I don’t need 
a sheet of paper to express my words 
here today. 
I rise in objection to this bill, be-
cause this bill is being passed on the 
backs of 500,000 plus of our fellow 
American citizens’ deaths, under the 
guise that you are passing a bill on a 
partisan basis, on their souls, in order 
to do COVID relief. This isn’t relief. 
This is because you guys won the ma-
jority. 
I am speaking to the American peo-
ple, to speak truth. 
You won the majority, you took the 
opportunity to put forth an agenda, 
and you didn’t include bipartisan sup-
port. 
I had one simple amendment on this 
bill. $1,400 is going to go to convicted 
child molesters in State prisons. What 
is that doing to stimulate the econ-
omy? Why does a child molester, who is 
sitting in State prison, need $1,400 to 
buy cigarettes or play video games in 
State prison? That is your priority. 
That is what you put in this bill. You 
didn’t 
even 
debate 
our 
bipartisan 
amendment to try and have that in-
cluded. 
Let’s be honest with the American 
people. You are playing politics. You 
are carrying forward an agenda. I get 
it. You won the election. But this is an 
emergency. This is a virus that is kill-
ing our fellow American citizens. 
We put together $4 trillion worth of 
relief to the American people on a bi-
partisan basis. We should have done it 
again, and you didn’t. It is wrong. That 
is why I say no to this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman from New York, my friend, 
knows that that decision was rendered 
by a federal judge, not by this Cham-
ber. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL), chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Oversight, who has led on a number 
of provisions, including extending the 
earned income tax credit to Puerto 
Rico. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, a lot 
of people are waiting to get this done 
today. It is up to us to help Americans 
who can’t buy their groceries or pay 
their rent and are not in prison. 
It is up to us to protect seniors in 
nursing homes. 
It is up to us to ensure that every 
American has quality health insurance 
and is able to get vaccinated. 
These are Congress’ burdens, our bur-
dens. 
I am voting yes, because Ingrid from 
Rutherford told me it would help her 
pay the rent or utilities. How can I say 
no to that? 
I am voting yes, because Bradley 
from Fort Lee told me that a new stim-
ulus check was the only way he could 
get help for his kids until he finds 
work. I am voting yes for that. 
Our cities and States are being bled 
into bankruptcy. They contemplate 
cuts to public safety in schools that 
will be felt for a generation without us 
acting. 
Americans are crying out for help, 
Mr. Speaker. Can you hear them? They 
have given us the burden to act. Today, 
we are going to deliver. We should be 
happy today. We should not be angry. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the Democrats 
so-called COVID relief bill. 
Congress’ focus should be specifically 
dialed in on crushing this virus, cre-
ating jobs, and getting our economy 
back open. 
Unfortunately, this package 
falls 
well short.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1275 
March 10, 2021 
As we battled the COVID pandemic 
over the last year, the economic stress 
placed on communities that I represent 
in central and west-central Illinois has 
been immense. 
Congress acted five times in a bipar-
tisan way over the last year, creating 
over $3.7 trillion to help keep busi-
nesses and workers afloat and support 
the healthcare community, all of which 
we supported. 
As of today, more than $1 trillion of 
those budgetary resources is still avail-
able, including money for State and 
local governments, small businesses, 
and schools. 
Congress can do more to support the 
economic recovery from COVID, but 
our efforts must be targeted. 
We cannot spend our way out of this 
crisis. 
In Illinois, we have seen the negative 
impact of the tax-and-spend agenda 
that put our State on the path to eco-
nomic disaster. 
The proposed stimulus plan by the 
Biden administration will impose new, 
burdensome 
costs, 
regulations, 
and 
rules on small businesses, making the 
recovery even more difficult. 
It is disheartening that, following 
calls for unity in his inauguration, 
President Biden’s first major legisla-
tive agenda item was partisan and spe-
cifically designed not to allow Repub-
lican input. 
Instead of rewarding fiscally irre-
sponsible States with huge bailouts, 
Congress should work to incentivize 
growth, focus on job creation and vac-
cine distribution. 
To generate a strong economy, we 
need to get government out of the way, 
open our communities, and enable 
Americans to thrive. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of our House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, some of us 
have been here for some period of time. 
Some of us have heard this debate be-
fore. My friend, Mr. REED, from New 
York, opined, and others have opined, 
about how we passed a number of bi-
partisan bills, five to be exact. March 4, 
March 14, March 27, April 24, and then 
we had a hiatus, because the majority 
leader of the Senate said we ought to 
take a break and see what happens, and 
the minority leader of the House said 
the same thing. So we didn’t take any 
action. Frankly, tens of thousands of 
people died—hundreds of thousands of 
people died. 
Now, I point out that we have acted 
five times: 415–2, 363–40—a voice vote 
on the CARES Act, $2 trillion—388–5, 
and 359–53. 
Now, if you include the CASH Act, 
which we passed, because the Presi-
dent, i.e., Mr. Trump, said we needed 
more money for people, so we passed 
the bill and 44 Republicans voted for 
that one as well. 
Now, there is only one thing that has 
changed since we passed those first five 
bills. We now have a Democratic Presi-
dent and not a Republican President. 
That is the only thing that has 
changed. 
The need is there. The virus is still 
with us. The economy is struggling. 
But now we have a Democratic Presi-
dent, so I expect zero of you to vote for 
this. 
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speak-
er, I expect zero Republicans to vote 
for this bill. 
Why do I expect that? Because I was 
here in 2009 when, under George Bush, 
we went into the deepest recession this 
country has seen since the Great De-
pression. 
Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, we passed 
two major pieces of legislation to deal 
with that recession. One was called 
TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Pro-
gram. A Republican President and 
Democrats passed that bill. Only a 
third, Mr. Speaker, of the Republicans 
would support President Bush. 
b 1230 
You can shake your head, but you 
look at the RECORD, that is the fact. 
That is the fact. 
Democrats supported the request of a 
Republican 
President 
because 
we 
thought it was in the best interests of 
the country and our people. And the 
only reason it passed this House is be-
cause Democrats, 172 of us, stood up 
with George Bush and voted for that 
program. And it was a bad vote for us. 
It was the right thing to do, but politi-
cally it was a bad vote. 
How sad, Mr. Speaker, I think it is 
that we passed five bipartisan votes 
with a Republican President. Now the 
President is different, and we don’t 
want to give him any credit, so we are 
going to cut off the nose of the Amer-
ican people to spite the face of Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, the Democratic major-
ity in the Senate has taken action, 
passing an amended version of the 
American Rescue Plan that this House 
approved on February 27. The version 
they sent us back reflects the same 
commitment 
demonstrated 
by 
this 
House to take the big and bold action 
demanded by the American people and 
overwhelmingly supported not just by 
Democrats, but by Republicans. 
The Republicans outside this House 
support this bill. Only the Republicans 
inside this House, unanimously appar-
ently, oppose this bill while some 60 
percent of the Republicans in America 
polled say, ‘‘We are for this bill.’’ 
But we have a Democratic President, 
I get it. President Biden’s plan is re-
flected in this legislation. It says 
President Biden’s plan, but this is our 
plan. This is a plan we built over a year 
of tough debate, long debate, sub-
stantive debate and discussion on both 
sides of the aisle, and in a bipartisan 
fashion passed those five bills. 
This bill is consistent with the meas-
ures we passed last year to confront 
the challenges to our public health and 
economic well-being. It achieves a 
number of critical goals: It puts vac-
cines into Americans’ arms; it will put 
money in Americans’ pockets; it will 
put children back in classrooms; it will 
put millions of Americans back to 
work and reopen businesses safely; and 
it will put at ease the frontline and es-
sential workers who are in the public 
sector, like teachers, the first respond-
ers, by ensuring that State, local, Trib-
al, and territorial governments can 
keep them employed. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
overwhelmingly support this legisla-
tion, with more than three-quarters in 
favor of its enactment, according to a 
Morning Consult poll from March 3rd. I 
would like to see some of the NRCC 
polls because I think they give the 
same message. But, of course, maybe 
those people polled didn’t realize there 
was a Democratic President. Heaven 
forbid that we vote for something that 
a Democratic President wants. 
Mr. Speaker, I put our party up to 
any kind of analysis in terms of our bi-
partisan support for Republican Presi-
dents when we thought it was in the 
best interests of the country. Nearly 6 
in 10 Republicans want to see this bill 
passed. 
Listen to your people. I am surprised 
that more of our Republican colleagues 
are not planning to vote for this legis-
lation. I hope they will do so. I hope 
they will do so because I think it is in 
the best interests of our Nation, of our 
families, of our individuals, of our busi-
nesses, of our economy. I hope they 
will join Democrats in taking action to 
help the nearly 10 million Americans 
who are out of work compared to this 
time last year. 
We waited. This is what happened. I 
hope they will also join Democrats in 
voting to extend expanded unemploy-
ment insurance benefits that would 
otherwise lapse for more than 11 mil-
lion families this weekend and to make 
good on our promise to send another 
round of $1,400 stimulus checks to most 
Americans. 
What are they going to do with that 
check? 
They are going to put it in the econ-
omy, and it is going to grow the econ-
omy and create jobs. 
And I hope they will join us in sup-
porting a massive effort at deploying 
vaccines and testing so we can defeat 
this virus. 
The American Rescue Plan means an 
end to the failed approach of hitting 
the pause button. It didn’t work. It is 
time to hit the start button. It is time 
to start Building Back Better through 
bold action. That is a political slogan. 
I like it. I have a Make It In America 
slogan myself. 
But this is not about slogans. It is 
about investment in our country, in 
our economy, and in our people, our 
families, our children, and, yes, the 
most vulnerable among us. That is 
what my faith teaches me to do. This is 
a vote to face our challenges with all of 
our strength and resolve. This is a vote 
to have each other’s backs as fellow 
Americans in this time of difficulty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1276 
March 10, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, with our votes today, 
we can send this legislation to Presi-
dent Biden so he can sign it into law 
and get the help that America and 
Americans need. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind my friend, the 
majority leader, that the reason that 
this bill is not bipartisan is there has 
been no effort to make it bipartisan. 
There have been zero committee 
meetings on this. Ms. PELOSI
uses 
COVID as an excuse to keep us away 
from Washington so that she can write 
these liberal grab bag bills on her own. 
There were no hearings on this in the 
Ways and Means Committee or I don’t 
think any other committee. I am sure 
we could have found a bipartisan re-
sponse to this, but instead they chose, 
because they have the majority now, to 
ram through their list of liberal prior-
ities in a massive expansion of the en-
titlement system under the guise of 
COVID relief. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the Sen-
ate amendment to this payoff package. 
According to the Treasury, at the 
end of 2020, $46 billion provided to 
States in the CARES Act pandemic re-
lief funding remained unspent. And 
this payoff package provides them an 
additional $360 billion. 
The partisan formula used will direct 
hundreds of millions more to liberal 
States like California and New York. 
That is because the formula is deter-
mined by the State’s population of un-
employed people. States that enacted 
stricter lockdowns with the heavy 
hand of government saw higher unem-
ployment rates and, therefore, will get 
more money. 
I will also highlight the racist so-
cially 
disadvantaged 
farmers 
and 
ranchers 
provision. 
This 
provision 
should be a clear violation of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, and I call on the De-
partment of Justice to investigate it if 
it becomes law. It is shameful and, in 
my opinion, illegal. I cannot justify 
conditioning relief based on race and 
ethnicity. This is not equality under 
the law. Federal aid dollars should be 
colorblind, and this bill puts the Fed-
eral Government in a precarious posi-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this relief package. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
Mr. HOYER also pointed out that many 
of us did support President Bush’s res-
cue package. I voted for it twice. 
We met with Hank Paulson, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, in the Ways and 
Means Committee library, and he said, 
‘‘You have to do this.’’ We followed 
suit and supported it. 
It has come to my attention that there is 
some uncertainty about the effective date of 
one of the provisions in the American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021. In section 9706 of the bill, 
we allow single-employer pension plans to 
measure their liabilities by using interest rates 
that are closer to historical norms, rather than 
the low interest rates that are in effect today 
in part because of the pandemic. This provi-
sion will enable both plans and participants to 
weather this crisis far better. I’d like to clarify 
an issue relating to the effective date of this 
provision. Plans can choose to have the provi-
sion apply starting in 2020. In addition, plans 
can elect to have the provision apply starting 
in 2022, so that it does not apply until 2022. 
It also is our intent that plans can elect for the 
provision to apply starting in 2021. We believe 
that is the right interpretation of the language 
of the bill. We want to give plans the max-
imum flexibility in this regard so that tomor-
row’s retirees can achieve a secure retire-
ment. My staff has run this interpretation by 
the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation 
and they also agree that an election to have 
the interest rate smoothing apply starting in 
2021 is permitted by the language in the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS), the chair of the Worker and 
Family Support Subcommittee, who 
has been a champion for the expanded 
childcare credit in this legislation. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, this is the day that millions 
of Americans have been waiting for, 
and now it is here. 
This is the day that we get serious 
about cutting child poverty in half, 
about putting millions of doses in the 
arms of people, vaccinations that they 
will get. 
This is the day when individuals 
know that their unemployment check 
is coming. They have hope because now 
they can pay their rent, pay the mort-
gage, buy the baby milk, get the auto-
mobile repaired. 
This is the day that the pastor at my 
church would say that the Lord has 
made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. I 
say this is the day that we restore the 
economy of America and save our Na-
tion. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would respond to the com-
ments of my friend, the chairman of 
the Ways and Means Committee when 
he said that he voted in favor of the 
bill when Hank Paulson came over and 
said it is something we needed to do, as 
opposed to this bill, which President 
Obama’s former director of National 
Economic Council warned about con-
sequences of this bill for the value of 
the dollar and financial stability be-
cause of the excessive borrowing that 
we are doing. 
Again, folks back home, we are bor-
rowing $5,500 in your name, in your 
wife’s name, in your children’s name, 
and giving you $1,400 of it. 
President Biden’s chief of staff boast-
ed about this bill that this is the most 
progressive domestic legislation in a 
generation. So it is no surprise, Mr. 
Speaker, that there is no bipartisan 
support for this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I heard 
some of the Republican Members say 
they want to fight the virus, yet they 
are voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill. I would 
say they should do the opposite. If they 
want to fight the virus, they should be 
voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Unlike under President Trump, when 
there was no national plan to fight the 
virus, under President Biden, for the 
first time we have a national plan to 
fight the virus that does not force 
States and local governments to com-
pete with each other for testing, con-
tact tracing, and medical supplies. 
The American Rescue Plan will sup-
port the national effort to ramp up dis-
tribution and administration of life-
saving COVID–19 vaccines, as well as 
the implementation of a national test-
ing strategy that will help us quickly 
track and contain the virus. It also in-
cludes 
the 
largest 
expansion 
of 
healthcare coverage since the passage 
of the Affordable Care Act, including 
lower monthly premiums for millions 
of Americans and a coverage expansion 
for millions under Medicaid who are 
currently uninsured. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue 
Plan lives up to its name. It rescues 
families by providing critical utility 
bill assistance so they can keep their 
lights on, the heat working, and the 
water running. It rescues kids by 
boosting 
internet 
connectivity 
to 
bridge the digital divide and close the 
homework gap. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
are hurting. This legislation will res-
cue our families, our communities, and 
our Nation as we continue to confront 
this devastating pandemic and the on-
going economic crisis. It is time to act, 
and this is the bill to bring us forward. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ), who was a lead 
supporter of expanding the child tax 
credit and a longstanding advocate for 
helping 
laid-off 
workers 
through 
COBRA. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the American Rescue 
Plan, and I want to thank Chairman 
NEAL for his work to ensure that this 
package keeps our promises. 
This rescue plan is transformative. It 
is the biggest investment in American 
families in a generation. 
It puts shots in arms, money in pock-
ets, children back to school, and people 
in jobs. 
It invests in research, development, 
and production to get vaccines out to 
all Americans. 
It helps keep people in their homes 
and apartments. 
It puts food on the tables of families 
who are experiencing hunger. 
It supports 27 million children with 
an expanded child tax credit. 
It helps more than 17 million workers 
through the earned income tax credit. 
It lowers healthcare costs and helps 
families keep their health coverage

pregnant women and children. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a day of great progress and great prom-
ise. I rise today to urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of the American Res-
cue Plan. 
The American Rescue Plan will save 
lives and livelihoods. It will put vac-
cines in the arms of Americans and 
provides $20 billion in a nationwide 
vaccine plan. 
It also puts children safely back in 
schools with a nearly $130 billion in-
vestment. It will put money in people’s 
pockets by delivering $1,400 stimulus 
checks, as well as expand reliable 
childcare and affordable healthcare. It 
will extend unemployment benefits to 
18 million Americans and so many Ala-
bamians that I represent. 
It will put people back to work by 
providing critical support for the hard-
est hit small businesses, expanding 
PPP eligibility and much more. It will 
give lots of needed money directly to 
localities, to local cities and counties. 
In fact, $472 million of direct funding 
will come to the State of Alabama in 
my district. 
Mr. Speaker, I want my constituents 
to know and all Americans to know 
that help is indeed on the way. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would point out to my 
friend from Alabama that because of 
the change in the allocation formula in 
this bill, relief for States—from the 
prior COVID relief bills—now this for-
mula will focus on the unemployed; 
therefore, places that have shut their 
economies down and hurt their citizens 
economically will get more money 
than places who haven’t. 
As a result, Alabama is the fourth or 
fifth largest loser in this bill in State 
and local government recovery money. 
Alabama will lose about $890 million, 
almost $1 billion, and that works out 
to approximately $178 lost for every 
man, woman, and child living in Ala-
bama. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE), a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee, 
who has been a tireless champion for 
this legislation’s historic expansion of 
the child tax credit. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the American Res-
cue Plan, a bill that will deliver crucial 
relief to millions of Americans who 
have been struggling for far too long. 
The pandemic has caused economic 
uncertainty, hardship, and turmoil. An 
estimated 8 million people have fallen 
into poverty during this crisis making 
the need for relief even greater. 
This bill includes an antipoverty 
measure I have fought for: An expan-
sion of the child tax credit. The expan-
sion will provide increased payments to 
help families pay bills and buy essen-
tials. The expansions in this bill are es-
timated to cut child poverty in half. 
This will transform the lives of many 
families and children. 
As chair of the New Democrat Coali-
tion, I am working to make the child 
tax credit permanent with Representa-
tives DELAURO and TORRES. Democrats 
are united around our shared goal to 
rebuild the middle class and make 
some of the biggest antipoverty re-
forms in a generation. 
I welcome my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to join us. Lifting chil-
dren out of poverty should not be par-
tisan. 
The American Rescue Plan will get 
our economy back on track and crush 
the virus. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this critical legislation. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the gentle-
woman that we are borrowing $5,500 for 
every man, woman, and child in the en-
tire country with this $1.9 trillion bill 
and that we are using that money to 
expand entitlement programs, includ-
ing the child tax credit. 
Well, who is going to end up paying 
back that $5,500 per person? It is going 
to be the very children that we are pro-
fessing to help today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. CLARK), a champion of 
all things Massachusetts. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for your incredible work 
and that of your committee. 
A few weeks ago, my colleagues 
across the aisle were animated in their 
support of fairness for women. So here 
is the moment to dispel any doubts 
that that was just a disingenuous de-
fense of bigotry and truly help Amer-
ican women by supporting this trans-
formative legislation. 
Women have been on the front lines 
of this crisis. Over two million women 
have been pushed out of work while 
fighting to keep their families fed, 
healthy, and housed. Because of this 
pandemic, women’s participation in the 
workforce is at a 33-year low. 
A vote ‘‘yes’’ for the American Res-
cue Plan is a vote to say vaccines can 
get into the arms of teachers and our 
frontline workers. That direct checks 
will go to 85 percent of Americans. An 
expanded child tax credit will cut child 
poverty 
in 
half. 
Unprecedented 
childcare funding will directly benefit 
its workforce made up of 95 percent 
women. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for women. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
for families. Vote ‘‘yes’’ for a more eq-
uitable future. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), a valued member of the 
Ways 
and 
Means 
Committee, 
who 
played a central role in shepherding 
this legislation through 2 days of Ways 
and Means consideration. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, my vote today for the 
American Rescue Plan will be the most 
consequential vote I have ever cast. 
Today, we show that democracy 
works. 
Today, we make available all the re-
sources needed to end a pandemic that 
has killed 527,000 Americans. 
Today, we lift millions of American 
children out of poverty. 
Today, we make the investment to 
get our children back to school safely. 
Today, we authorize economic in-
come payments to millions of our citi-
zens behind on their rents and car pay-
ments and unable to buy groceries. 
Today, we extend unemployment in-
surance for the 10 percent of Americans 
still out of work because of the virus. 
Today, we send national help to 
those State and local governments who 
employed the heroes who provide our 
quality of life: police, firefighters, 
teachers, child protective service work-
ers, sanitation workers, and many oth-
ers. 
And, today, we reject the social Dar-
winism of our Republican friends. We 
reject the ethic of every man, woman, 
and child for themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote for 
this bill today. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. EVANS), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee, who has 
been a leader on expanding the earned 
income tax credit. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
This act is big and bold, and it begins 
to keep our promise to Build Back Bet-
ter. This is a historic bill, a policy rev-
olution. 
It includes: cutting child poverty in 
half, expanding the earned income tax 
credit for our essential workers, and 
saving people’s pensions. 
It means a shot in the arm, returning 
kids to school safely, and more people 
back in jobs. 
My constituents in Philadelphia feel 
it is needed now. This is something we 
all should be working on together. 
I thank the chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee and all of the

staff for working on this very impor-
tant bill. This is something that is long 
overdue, and I am glad to be part of it. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee, who was 
one of the loudest voices for expanding 
the employee retention tax credit and 
a leader on all provisions that will im-
prove care for nursing home residents. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, 1 year 
ago this week we left Congress early 
because of COVID–19. Since then our 
entire way of life has been upended 
with the worst pandemic in a century, 
where at times we weren’t taming this 
COVID tiger, we were just riding it. 
Yet, despite that rough ride, we did 
our job in Congress with five massive 
relief bills that kept the economy 
afloat, the poverty rate flat, and put us 
in the position where right now we are 
neck and neck in this race between in-
jections and infections. 
Yet my colleagues on the other side 
want to slow us down by voting ‘‘no,’’ 
claiming process or price or pork or 
politics. 
Well, I support the American Rescue 
Plan, not just because we need to speed 
up our response but because this bill is 
about people; their health, their vac-
cines, their jobs, their businesses, their 
local governments, and getting our 
kids back to school safely. 
So let’s do our job. Let’s defeat this 
disease. Let’s win this race by voting 
‘‘yes’’ on the American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind my friend 
that only about 9 percent of this bill 
actually goes to speed vaccine produc-
tion and delivery around the country. 
And if more of that were occurring in 
this bill there may be more bipartisan-
ship. 
This bill is a misnomer called a 
COVID recovery act when, in fact, it is 
just an expansion of entitlements that 
will make people more dependent on 
the government and will lessen their 
opportunity and heap debt on our chil-
dren and our grandchildren. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ), a valued member of 
the Ways and Means Committee, who 
fought hard to ensure that all mixed- 
status families are eligible to receive 
the economic impact payments and 
emergency assistance under this legis-
lation. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I represent 
Los Angeles, California, considered by 
many as one of the epicenters of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
In my district working families are 
struggling to pay bills, small busi-
nesses are trying to stay afloat, and 
countless others are doing everything 
they can to keep a roof over their 
heads. 
They need us to pass the American 
Rescue Plan. 
Throughout 
California, 
essential 
workers, many of them Black and 
Latinos, are keeping our economy run-
ning. Frontline healthcare workers are 
exhausted from caring for their pa-
tients day after day, month after 
month during this pandemic, and local 
organizations 
are 
distributing 
food 
every single day to those in need. They 
need us to pass the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Across the country people are terri-
fied that they or a loved one will get 
COVID–19 before being vaccinated and 
end up in the hospital or dead. They 
are scared that the American Dream is 
drifting further and further away. They 
need us to pass the American Rescue 
Plan. 
That is why 75 percent of Americans 
support this plan. Democrats, Repub-
licans, independents from red States 
and blue States, they are urging us to 
pass this plan, and they are urging 
their 
Representatives 
to 
listen 
to 
them. They are urging my colleagues 
on the Republican side of the aisle to 
not turn a deaf ear to their cause and 
do the right thing and vote with Demo-
crats to pass this bill. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SUOZZI), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee, who has 
been a champion for provisions to 
shore up the multiemployer pensions. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, the other 
side of the aisle is peddling a false nar-
rative. This bill is not loaded with 
pork. It is not a blue State bailout. 
It is a comprehensive plan to help 
people crushed by the virus beat the 
pandemic into the ground and ensure a 
rapid economic recovery. 
Yet my friends across the aisle and 
their cable news and social media 
enablers continue to promote fake 
news. 
Let’s set the record straight. It is 
true that 9 percent—their favorite 
talking point—9 percent, or $171 billion 
is for vaccines, testing, and other 
healthcare infrastructure. 
Well, what about the other 90 per-
cent? $424 billion for $1,400 stimulus 
checks, $350 billion for struggling State 
and local governments, $246 billion for 
unemployment insurance, $219 billion 
for children and childcare so parents 
can return to work, $178 billion to help 
reopen schools, $109 billion for farmers 
and small businesses, $28 billion for 
restaurants and live venues, $40 billion 
for renters and homeowners who need 
assistance. 
Let’s pass this bill. Stop the phony- 
baloney talking points and get the 
American people the relief they need. 
b 1300 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would remind my 
friend that what we are doing here is 
waving a $1,400 check in front of our 
constituency and saying, ‘‘Look at 
this,’’ but we are like the Wizard of Oz, 
‘‘Don’t look at what is going on behind 
the curtain,’’ because what we are 
doing with this $1.9 trillion bill is bor-
rowing $5,500 for every man, woman, 
and child in this country. 
We are giving them $1,400 so it is pal-
atable to them. We are giving them a 
little sugar. We are not reminding 
them about the $4,100 other dollars 
that we are borrowing in their name, of 
which $1,067 goes to bail out blue 
States like New York and California. 
Mr. Speaker, $177 of their money, of 
that $4,100, goes to bail out union pen-
sion plans; $750, folks back home, of 
your $4,100 that we are borrowing in 
your name and your wife’s name and 
your kids’ names is going to extend un-
employment benefits to pay people 
more to sit home than they can make 
at work; $34 goes to museums and Na-
tive American language preservation; 
$393 goes to K–12 and $120 to colleges 
and universities, of your money, each 
of your money, and there is no require-
ment that they reopen; $58 goes for 
public health organizations, including 
Planned Parenthood. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill, again, is sim-
ply a guise. COVID relief, no. As Mr. 
CLYBURN said: Let’s use this disaster to 
mold things to our vision. 
And they are doing exactly that. This 
is a massive expansion of the entitle-
ment programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, the 
scale of our relief bill must match the 
scale of this crisis, and the American 
Rescue Plan meets this moment. 
In addition, this comprehensive plan 
includes much-needed relief for our 
battered cities. As a former mayor, I 
understand the struggle and strain of 
our cities right now. Congress cannot 
sit back as our mayors, Democrats and 
Republicans, are calling for help. This 
is not a Democrat or Republican issue. 
This pandemic is reaching every corner 
of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s answer this call 
and pass the American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the people back 
home that the scale of this plan that 
the gentlewoman is talking about is 
$5,500 borrowed for every man, woman, 
and child in this country, and your 
children will pay that money back. 
They will pay it back in higher taxes. 
They will pay it back in lost oppor-
tunity. They will pay it back in weaker 
economic growth. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ).

FERNANDEZ.

cans all across my district. I have

talked to mayors, local officials, Tribal 
leaders. I have asked them the same 
question: What do you need? 
What they have all said, Republicans 
and Democrats alike, is that they need 
this rescue plan. Our small businesses 
are ready to put this lifeline to use. 
Our frontline workers, families, and 
farmers are ready. New Mexico is ready 
to start climbing out of this crisis. 
Americans have told us what they 
need. We have listened, and now we are 
delivering. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 3 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
South Carolina has 7 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, more than once today, 
there has been reference to the recov-
ery bills at the end of the Bush admin-
istration and the beginning of the 
Obama administration coming out of a 
very bad financial crisis. Of course, 
this COVID pandemic has led to a fi-
nancial crisis in this country. But the 
difference in the response here is stark 
between the two. 
Coming out of the Bush administra-
tion and into the Obama administra-
tion, we expanded government, raised 
taxes, expanded regulations, and adopt-
ed recovery bills that weren’t focused 
on economic growth. The result of that 
was, through 8 years of the Obama- 
Biden administration, we had stagnant 
growth. The middle class was shrink-
ing; middle-class incomes were shrink-
ing. 
It took a Republican President, a Re-
publican Congress, enacting bills that 
lowered taxes, lowered regulation, and 
lowered government reliance that led 
to massive economic growth and oppor-
tunity for all demographics in our 
country. Hispanics, African Americans, 
women, and others have seen growth 
and opportunity not seen in decades, if 
ever. 
I hope, with this plan, that we are 
not going to go back to the days of the 
Obama-Biden years of stagnant growth 
and dashed opportunity for our chil-
dren and our grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, we are holding up a 
check for $1,400 to the American public 
and saying: Vote for this, but don’t pay 
attention because we are really bor-
rowing $5,500 in your name, your wife’s 
name, your husband’s name, and each 
of your kids’ names. For each of your 
kids, we are borrowing $5,500 in their 
name that they are going to have to 
pay back. They are getting $1,400 of it, 
but the other $4,100 is going here. 
It is not right, and it is not fair. And 
it will lead to lower growth and less op-
portunity for those kids that we are 
saddling with that debt right now. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the right 
plan to address our Nation’s challenges 
in defeating the COVID–19 virus. It is 
not the right time either. There is still 
a trillion dollars in unused funds from 
previous packages that were bipar-
tisan, that were targeted, that were 
not merely misnamed liberal grab 
bags. 
The Congressional Budget Office’s 
overview of the economic outlook 
projects that, by the middle of the 
year, the economy will have returned 
to a prepandemic level of real GDP. 
Why? That is because the policies put 
in place under the Trump administra-
tion and a Republican Congress are 
still in place—lower taxes and lower 
regulation. That is why, as opposed to 
the Obama-Biden recovery, which in 8 
years still had not recovered, the econ-
omy 
is 
quickly 
coming 
back 
to 
prepandemic levels right now. 
Yet, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle have found every reason to 
rush through costly, unnecessary pro-
gressive priorities that my constitu-
ents didn’t ask for. 
The American Rescue Plan is costing 
each American more than their mort-
gage payment, a downpayment on their 
car, or a semester of their children’s 
college, and their children will have to 
pay it back. I don’t want to leave a 
huge bill for my kids, and I know most 
Americans don’t either. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that this bill ex-
panding government, expanding enti-
tlements, paying people to stay home, 
making them more reliant on the gov-
ernment does not lead to another dec-
ade of stagnation, of lost opportunity. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous bill. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ against a selfish attempt to 
strap our next generation with debt. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ to progressive payoffs that 
we the people did not order. We must 
do better. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 2 minutes of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a most signifi-
cant day, and this legislation meets 
the challenge of history and calls 
Americans to act upon this crisis. This 
is the opportunity now, and we should 
act. 
This is not about self-correction. Far 
too much is at stake. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues 
and, particularly, the Committee on 
Ways and Means’ staff, who wore many 
hats through this, from crafting this 
package to the brutal negotiations 
with the Senate. They worked long 
hours while facing the same challenges 
presented by remote school, lack of 
childcare, and concern for family mem-
bers that Americans face every mo-
ment through this crisis. There are too 
many names to include, but I know 
that their counsel has been unparal-
leled and their expertise always un-
matched. 
Mr. Speaker, over the Speaker’s ros-
trum is a magnificent admonition from 
a son of Massachusetts, Mr. WEBSTER: 
‘‘Let us develop the resources of our 
land, call forth its powers, build up its 
institutions, promote all its great in-
terests, and see whether we also in our 
day and generation may not perform 
something worthy to be remembered.’’ 
That is what we are going to do in the 
next few minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House, 
whose attention to legislative detail is 
extraordinary. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for his extraordinary leadership in 
putting nearly a trillion dollars into 
the pockets of the American people. I 
thank him and Mr. YARMUTH, the chair 
of the Budget Committee, for their 
leadership on this legislation and, of 
course, on this debate this afternoon. 
It was dazzling to see them and the 
Democratic chairs and Members speak 
up about this important legislation. 
I thank the chairman for pointing 
out the inconsistency on the part of 
our colleagues across the aisle in com-
plaining about money helping the poor-
est of poor children in our country 
while they didn’t hesitate to give large 
amounts of money to the richest people 
in America in their Republican tax 
scam. The chairman’s charts were very 
eloquent. 
Mr. Speaker, to hear our Members 
speak about the terms of this bill, the 
values that are in it, the plan that it 
has, why they were voting ‘‘yes’’ on the 
bill, and to hear Republicans talk 
about why they would vote ‘‘no,’’ it is 
typical that they vote ‘‘no’’ and take 
the dough. 
This 
bill 
has 
bipartisan 
support 
across the country, not only among the 
general public, but in mayors, select-
men, city councilpersons, and county 
executives—who are Republican—ea-
gerly awaiting the passage of this bill 
because they know at their level what 
a difference it will make in the lives of 
their constituents, the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a critical mo-
ment in our country’s history. Tomor-
row, the world will mark 1 year since 
COVID–19 was officially declared a 
global pandemic by the World Health 
Organization. At that time, just over 
1,000 Americans had contracted the dis-
ease, and 38 had died. 
Since that day 1 year ago from to-
morrow, nearly 30 million Americans 
have become infected. Over half a mil-
lion Americans have died, more lives 
than were lost in combat in all of 
America’s wars against foreign enemies 
combined. 
Each of those lives is precious to us. 
We feel each loss profoundly and pray 
for their families and for the families 
of those who have contracted the virus 
and are still affected by it. And 
through it all, a historic economic cri-
sis has raged. 
A full year later, 18 million Ameri-
cans are still out of work, according to 
the statistics at the end of last week, 
and nearly 10 million jobs may have 
been lost. We hope to stop that. 
The most vulnerable among us have 
been disproportionately affected: moms

pushed out of the labor market, women 
and minority-owned businesses forced 
to shudder, communities of color fac-
ing rising disparities. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we have a real 
opportunity for change. As we serve in 
Congress with each other, we learn 
about each other’s districts, each oth-
er’s priorities, and the rest. And we 
learn about each other’s why. Why did 
you come to Congress? Why are you 
here? 
Each of us has come to Congress with 
a purpose. My purpose, my why, are the 
children. As a mother of five raising 
my kids, seeing all the attention and 
all that they needed, I was horrified by 
the fact that one in five children in 
America lives in poverty and goes to 
sleep hungry in America at night. 
That is my why. That is why I went 
from homemaker to the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
b 1315 
That is why when people ask me, 
‘‘What do you think the three most im-
portant issues are facing the Con-
gress?’’ I always say the same thing: 
Our children, our children, our chil-
dren—their health; their education; the 
economic security of their families; a 
safe, healthy environment in which 
they can thrive; and a nation at peace 
in which they can reach their fulfill-
ment. 
Several of those priorities are ad-
dressed in this legislation. 
Again, this legislation, which has bi-
partisan support throughout the coun-
try, the Biden—and let me sing praises 
on President Biden for the values, for 
the vision, the strategic thinking, for 
the knowledge that he has brought to 
what, as you said earlier, we had in the 
works for a while, but we freshened up 
by current events, the vaccine, and 
what those possibilities are. 
The Biden American Rescue Plan is 
about the children, their health, their 
education, the economic security of 
their families, again. Our children’s 
health is greatly protected by crushing 
the virus and by expanding access to 
healthcare through the Affordable Care 
Act 
expansions 
in 
here, 
Medicaid 
through FMAP, and in other ways as 
well. 
Our children’s education is advanced 
with a $170 billion to open schools safe-
ly, including $130 billion for K–12. This 
funding will help address the social and 
emotional 
challenges 
that 
children 
face, as well as learning loss, as well as 
opening the schools safely. We know 
what that requires. It requires ventila-
tion, space, more teachers, more space, 
to name a few things. 
In terms of the economic security of 
children’s families, this legislation, as 
I said earlier to Mr. NEAL, puts nearly 
$1 trillion in the pockets of the Amer-
ican people. Republicans did not seem 
to object when they put that much 
money in the pockets of 83 percent of 
their tax scam into the top 1 percent, 
but they seem to have a discomfort 
level when it reaches the poorest of the 
poor and those in the middle class who 
are struggling. So this legislation does 
that. 
It includes the refundable tax credit, 
which will lift 50 percent of children 
out of poverty. 
How do you say ‘‘no’’ to lifting 50 
percent of impoverished children in 
America out of poverty? 
Children also benefit from the earned 
income tax credit, direct payments, 
and enhanced unemployment insurance 
benefits for their families. And the eco-
nomic security of children is also en-
hanced by pension security of their 
grandparents, which is historically se-
cured in this bill. 
Sometimes I have young people come 
to my office—it is all about the chil-
dren, it is all about the future—high 
school students, college students—and 
they talk about the security of their 
grandparents as important because, to 
the extent that their parents can focus 
on them rather than worry about the 
financial 
security 
of 
their 
grand-
parents, it is very important to the 
family across the board. 
For the children, the American Res-
cue Plan also includes $12 billion in nu-
trition assistance to help the estimated 
11 million children still going hungry. 
When I talk about this with my fam-
ily, I say to my kids: You know, the 
millions of children who are food inse-
cure in our country, that is horrible. 
They will say: Mom, just say it an-
other way. They are hungry. They are 
hungry. Some of them get their food at 
school. They go to sleep hungry. If you 
call that food insecurity, okay, but un-
derstand this, these little children are 
hungry. 
Again, $12 billion in nutrition assist-
ance. 
$43 billion in rental, homeowner, and 
other housing assistance so that chil-
dren of families who are on the verge of 
eviction can have the comfort of know-
ing that that won’t happen. They will 
have the comfort of home. 
$45 billion of childcare to keep chil-
dren learning and parents earning. 
That is always necessary, but even 
more so with the 2.3 million women 
losing their jobs, many of them moms. 
Now, everything that I mentioned 
here is related to the coronavirus. We 
have hunger issues in our country big-
ger than even this. We have housing 
issues. We have childcare issues, and 
the rest. It is very important in our 
country. But this is coronavirus-cen-
tered. 
Childcare, and I will say it again, $45 
billion. Most of it is for childcare and a 
little bit of it is for Head Start. Chil-
dren learning, parents earning. This is 
important and central to how families 
get through this coronavirus crisis. 
All of these provisions in the bill are 
enhanced by strengthening the support 
for our heroes at the State and local 
level. Hence, our bill was called the He-
roes Act. Much of that is contained in 
this legislation. Heroes, because our 
workers at the State, county, and local 
level, our healthcare workers, our first 
responders, police and fire, our sanita-
tion, transportation, our food workers, 
our teachers—our teachers, our teach-
ers—make our lives possible, and make 
the existence of our children better. 
Whatever we spend on education in 
this bill is a small percentage of what 
State and local government spend on 
education. More than 90 percent of it 
comes from the State and local. So in 
this legislation we are ensuring that 
State and local government keep them 
in their jobs as heroes, as we talked 
about, and will help fight the fiscal 
pressure that they have because of the 
cost of addressing the coronavirus cri-
sis, as well as revenue lost because of 
shutdowns and the rest. 
I was raised in a mayor’s household 
as a daughter and sister of the mayor 
of Baltimore. The recognition of the 
role that local government plays is 
very important to me, local and State. 
But the local government is the first 
line of defense, and we are determined 
to fight any attempts to weaken what 
was in this legislation for local govern-
ment. 
One of the values respected in this 
legislation is our commitment to com-
munities of color, including Native 
Americans, especially, who continue to 
face serious health and economic dis-
parities. This legislation will, among 
other steps, address 8 in 10 minority- 
owned businesses on the brink of clo-
sure—8 in 10 minority-owned busi-
nesses. 
The American Rescue Plan, Mr. 
Speaker, is a force for fairness and jus-
tice in America. This legislation is one 
of the most transformative and his-
toric bills any of us will ever have the 
opportunity to support. It is one of the 
most transformative that I have seen 
in my over 30 years in the Congress. It 
is as consequential as the Affordable 
Care Act, which expanded healthcare 
to more than 20 million people and 
made benefits much better for over 150 
million families. 
Today, we have a decision to make of 
tremendous consequence, a decision 
that will make a difference for millions 
of Americans, saving lives and liveli-
hoods. And as with all decisions, it is a 
decision that we will have to answer 
for. We will give the American Rescue 
Plan a resounding and, hopefully, bi-
partisan vote to reflect the bipartisan 
support that it has in the country. And 
we will get to work immediately to de-
liver 
lifesaving 
resources 
springing 
from this bill as soon as it is passed 
and signed, as we join President Biden 
in his promise that help is on the way. 
For the people, for the children, I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, since March 
2020, when the COVID–19 pandemic plunged 
this country into a public health emergency 
and wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy, 
House Democrats have worked around the 
clock to advance robust legislation to address 
our public health needs and to provide real as-
sistance to those who have been affected by 
this deadly pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1281 
March 10, 2021 
That day has finally arrived. The American 
Rescue Plan Act is the culmination of a year- 
long effort by Democrats to tackle the pan-
demic crisis and provide assistance to strug-
gling individuals, families, small businesses 
and communities. Under the leadership of 
President Biden, Democrats in the House and 
Senate are taking action to deliver robust relief 
across the country. 
With millions out of work, facing eviction, ex-
periencing hunger, and struggling to make 
ends meet, this legislation is urgently needed. 
The Committee on Financial Services draft-
ed key recommendations that are contained in 
the legislation under consideration today, and 
as Chairwoman I am providing an explanatory 
statement of these provisions to guide the Ad-
ministration’s implementation of these provi-
sions. 
Section 3101. COVID–19 Emergency Medical 
Supplies Enhancement. 
Subsection (a) of section 3101 provides 
$10,000,000,000 to carry out titles I, III, and 
VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 
U.S.C. 4501 et seq)(DPA) to boost the pro-
duction of essential medical equipment and 
supplies related to combating the COVID–19 
Pandemic. The Committee expects that in im-
plementing this section, the President will seek 
to make investments in both urban and rural 
areas to the extent this is consistent with the 
country’s health needs. 
Subsection (b) sets out the purposes for 
which the $10 billion provided by this section 
may be used. Paragraph (1) provides that the 
funds may be used for the purchase, produc-
tion or distribution of medical equipment and 
supplies related to combating the COVID–19 
Pandemic, including funding for all types of 
COVID–19 tests, personal protection equip-
ment, including N95 masks, and vaccines and 
drugs for preventing or treating COVID–19 or 
its symptoms. Subsection (b) also provides for 
using such funds for acquisition of material, in-
cluding raw materials, equipment and tech-
nology needed for such purposes. The Com-
mittee notes that testing is critical to ensure 
that we can stamp out the pandemic, and the 
provision includes in-vitro diagnostic testing, 
intended to be interpreted as that term is de-
fined in section 809.3(a) of title 21, Code of 
Federal Regulations), for the detection of 
SARS–CoV–2 or the diagnosis of the virus 
that causes Covid–19. The Committee expects 
that such tests will include inexpensive rapid 
at-home antigen tests that will allow individ-
uals to identify new infections quickly and 
safely. This subsection also provides for vac-
cines, which are described in this section as 
biological products, intended to be interpreted 
as that term is defined by section 351 of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). 
The Committee also notes that ‘‘drugs’’ and 
‘‘medical devices’’ as used in subsection 
(b)(1)(C) are intended to be interpreted as 
those terms are defined in the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et 
seq.)) 
Subsection (b) also provides that after Sep-
tember 30, 2022, funds appropriated by sub-
section (a) may be used to combat future 
pathogens that the President determines have 
the potential for creating a public health emer-
gency. This additional flexibility can be used to 
address the current or future pathogens. 
Given this flexibility, the Committee expects 
that if the President exercises this authority, 
the President will consult with the relevant 
committees, including providing information on 
the amounts the President anticipates the ad-
ministration would spend to combat such a 
pathogen prior to exercising this authority. Be-
cause of the wide ranging interests in these 
matters, in addition to the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services, information should be pro-
vided to the Senate Committee on Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs, the House and 
Senate Appropriations Committees, the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, and the 
Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions. 
The Committee also expects that the Presi-
dent will provide timely information regarding 
the use of these funds, whether for the 
COVID–19 Pandemic or for future pathogens. 
In particular, the Committee expects that the 
President will provide information on any com-
mitment of more than $50 million, whether in 
the forms of expenditures or loans under the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, prior to mak-
ing such commitment. Because of the wide in-
terest in these matters, the Committee expects 
that all such information, shall be provided not 
only to the Committee but also to the Commit-
tees described above. 
The Committee also expects that the funds 
provided by this section will primarily be used 
by the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS). The DPA allows the President to 
delegate his authority under the DPA to var-
ious agencies, and he has delegated DPA au-
thority under Title III of the Act to HHS. While 
the DPA has been administered by the De-
partment of Defense, the funds made avail-
able by this section are not for support of the 
Defense Industrial Base, but are for medical 
supplies and equipment related to the COVID– 
19 Pandemic. However, the Committee recog-
nizes that the President may determine that it 
is important that other agencies, such as the 
Department of Homeland Security, have a role 
in either producing or distributing key supplies 
with respect to the Pandemic or a future 
pathogen that has the potential to cause a 
public health emergency. If the President dele-
gates this authority to any agency other than 
HHS because it is important to do so, the 
Committee expects the President to consult 
with the relevant Committees prior to take 
such action, and notify the relevant Commit-
tees of which agency would exercise such au-
thority, the amount and the purpose for which 
the funds would be used. 
Finally, the Committee notes that the Sen-
ate Amendment removed references to sec-
tion 304(e) of the Defense Production Act of 
1950 (relating to limits on carryover funds re-
maining in the Defense Production Act Fund 
established by section 304 of the Act). The 
Committee believes by eliminating this ref-
erence, the $10 billion provided by section 
3101 is no longer intended to be deposited 
into the DPA Fund. The statutory framework 
established by section 3101 clearly provides 
that the funds provided by this section are for 
any purpose in titles I, III and VII (including 
paying for critical infrastructure under section 
107 of the Act and for experts and other per-
sonnel under Title VII of the Act). By its terms, 
amounts in the DPA Fund are available only 
for purposes of Title III, so funds from section 
3101 should not be deposited into this Fund. 
This is also consistent with the provision free 
standing nature, as opposed to referencing the 
existing ‘‘DPA Purchases’’ account, which is a 
proxy for deposits into the Fund. Moreover, 
the fact that the funds have a specific duration 
until September 30, 2025 demonstrates that 
these funds have a special status that is not 
consistent with the statutory frame of DPA 
Fund. Thus, in agreeing to the Senate Amend-
ment, the Committee intends that the Presi-
dent establish a new account to allow these 
funds to be used for the purposes of titles I, 
III, and VII of the Act and to available until 
September 30, 2025, without reference to sec-
tion 304 of the Act. In order to ease execution 
of these funds, the President may use existing 
delegations and structures to carry out this 
provision, including current mechanisms for 
execution of the DPA Fund. 
The Committee notes that this section 
draws from H.R. 1720, introduced by Rep-
resentative JUAN VARGAS of California. 
With millions of individuals and families 
struggling to pay their rent, action is urgently 
needed to prevent an eviction crisis. According 
to the latest U.S. Census data, nearly 1 in 5 
renters are behind on paying rent, with renters 
of color disproportionally struggling, while 
Moody’s Analytics recently estimated that rent-
ers collectively owe over $57 billion in unpaid 
rent, utilities, and additional fees. Section 3201 
provides $21.6 billion for states, localities, and 
territories to provide emergency assistance to 
renters. This funding supplements the $25 bil-
lion in emergency rental assistance funding 
provided by Congress in December (Section 
501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2021 (Public Law 116–260) (Section 501)) but 
includes additional flexibilities to ensure grant-
ees can better stabilize renters. The Biden ad-
ministration should again extend the federal 
eviction moratorium that expires on March 31, 
2021 so that grantees have time to distribute 
assistance to renters in need. 
Renters would be able to receive up to 18 
months of financial assistance, including future 
rent and utility payments (including pad rents 
in manufactured housing communities), and 
unpaid rent or utility bills that have accumu-
lated. Renters can also receive assistance for 
other housing-related expenses necessary to 
promote housing stability, such as, but not lim-
ited to:, security deposits; relocation and rental 
fees for displaced households; late fees re-
lated to a former or current rental unit; and 
internet service provided to the rental unit. 
Section 3201 does not preclude grantees from 
continuing payment processes provided in 
Section 501. These processes are the provi-
sions that govern payments of rent and utility 
assistance either to property owners and utili-
ties or directly to tenants, and the application 
for assistance by landlords and owners under 
subsection (f). Additionally, funds can be used 
to provide housing stability services, such as, 
but not limited to: case management; tenant- 
landlord mediation; legal services related to 
eviction and housing stability; housing coun-
seling; fair housing counseling; and special-
ized services for people with disabilities, peo-
ple with chronic health conditions, seniors, or 
survivors of domestic violence or human traf-
ficking. Similar to Section 501, Section 3201 
permits grantees to use a certain percentage 
of their funds on administrative costs to sup-
port eligible program activities, including the 
provision of financial assistance and housing 
stability services. Grantees may also use up to 
10 percent of their funds on providing housing 
stability services. As in Section 501, funds are 
provided to states to assist renters throughout 
the state, including in rural communities, as

March 10, 2021 
well as cities and counties that receive a direct 
allocation. 
The Committee expects the Department of 
the Treasury (Treasury) (the agency imple-
menting the program) and grantees to imple-
ment Section 3201 swiftly and not create any 
artificial barriers to assistance. In particular, 
we have seen with some benefits provided by 
the CARES Act, that documentation require-
ments to prove eligibility have erected artificial 
barriers that have cut people off from the ben-
efits Congress intended them to receive. In-
deed, diverse stakeholders, including tenant 
advocates, landlords, and state and local gov-
ernment agencies have raised concerns that 
such requirements that have been applied in 
existing emergency rental assistance pro-
grams have prevented renters from completing 
applications and are overly burdensome for 
program staff. It is critical that any renters who 
are struggling to pay their rent during the pan-
demic are not barred from accessing this as-
sistance due to cumbersome documentation 
requirements or other barriers. An applicant’s 
simple attestation should be the only docu-
mentation required to meet program eligibility 
requirements. Additionally, grantees may con-
tinue the income assessment procedures pur-
suant to Section 501 to determine eligibility. It 
is also the intent of the Committee that Treas-
ury and grantees broadly read the requirement 
regarding the connection between a renter’s 
hardship and the coronavirus pandemic when 
determining the eligibility of the renter. As the 
language states, the hardship must have oc-
curred ‘‘during or due, directly or indirectly, to 
the coronavirus pandemic.’’ The economic ef-
fects of the pandemic will be felt long after the 
virus is contained. Certain industries and com-
munities have been particularly hard-hit from 
the pandemic and will likely take years to re-
cover. Treasury should issue guidance that 
makes this point clear to ensure renters are 
not cut off from needed assistance as they try 
to recover from economic downturns caused 
by the pandemic. 
Section 3201 also provides that after Octo-
ber 1, 2022, certain grantees may expend 
funds on ‘‘other affordable rental housing and 
eviction prevention activities’’ that benefit any 
very low-income renter household. Such activi-
ties can include affordable housing develop-
ment, preservation, or acquisition, and other 
forms of rental assistance and eviction preven-
tion activities targeted to very low-income rent-
ers. 
To ensure continuity in monitoring funds 
provided by Section 3201 and Section 501 
and ease of grantee implementation, Treasury 
should maintain the same reporting require-
ments that were included in Section 501. 
The Committee encourages the Administra-
tion to create and maintain a central public re-
pository of information on state and local rent-
al assistance programs, which at a minimum 
identifies the program’s administering agency 
and contact information, so that renters and 
landlords can more easily identify available as-
sistance. 
Finally, to the extent there is any confusion 
with regard to the taxability of assistance, 
Treasury, in consultation with the Internal Rev-
enue Service, should provide guidance to clar-
ify this for grantees and program participants. 
During this public health emergency and fi-
nancial crisis, millions of homes are threat-
ened by foreclosure, with over 8 million home-
owners behind on their mortgage payments, 
and an estimated $90 billion in missed mort-
gage payments. Targeted, direct assistance to 
homeowners through the Homeowner Assist-
ance Fund (HAF or Fund) is an essential tool 
that will help avoid a repeat of the 2008 fore-
closure crisis, which upended the lives of mil-
lions of Americans and eviscerated the 
generational wealth for many communities, 
namely for families and communities of color. 
Although the CARES Act provided a fore-
closure moratorium and forbearance for feder-
ally-backed mortgages, many homeowners will 
lose their homes to foreclosure in the absence 
of additional assistance. Approximately 30 per-
cent of the mortgage market is not federally- 
backed and, therefore, ineligible for CARES 
Act forbearance relief provided in March of 
2020. Elderly borrowers with reverse mort-
gages (known as Home Equity Conversion 
Mortgages or HECMs) will need assistance 
paying their taxes, insurance, and utilities on 
time to avoid foreclosure. Low-to-moderate in-
come homeowners may need more payment 
assistance after forbearance than is possible 
through loss mitigation programs. Single-family 
rental property owners and other homeowners 
without a mortgage will also need assistance 
to avoid losing their homes due to fore-
closures. The HAF would be able to help with 
other housing costs beyond mortgage pay-
ments, and can be used for things like prin-
cipal reduction that are not offered through 
loss mitigation for federal mortgage programs 
but can provide deeper payment reductions for 
homeowners who need it. 
Administered through the Department of the 
Treasury (Treasury), the HAF would provide 
nearly $10 billion for states, territories, and 
tribal governments to address the ongoing 
needs of homeowners struggling to afford their 
housing because they have experienced a fi-
nancial 
hardship 
associated 
with 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. Designed to work 
alongside CARES Act mortgage forbearance 
relief and federal loss mitigation programs, the 
HAF will prevent foreclosures by providing 
homeowners direct assistance with their mort-
gage payments, property taxes, property insur-
ance, utilities, and other housing related costs. 
The funding would be administered similar to 
the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF), which was a 
homeowner relief program created in the after-
math of the 2008 crisis that was administered 
primarily through State Housing Finance 
Agencies. While HHF funding was available to 
select states, the HAF has been calibrated to 
be available to all states, territories, and tribes, 
and to account for significantly higher rates of 
unemployment today as compared to 2008. 
Of the nearly $10 billion dollars provided 
through the HAF, 60 percent of funds are re-
quired to serve homeowners making at or 
below 100 percent of the area median income 
or the national median income, whichever is 
higher. The flexibility in income determination 
between AMI and national median income is 
intended to ensure resources reach localities 
where the area median income may be too 
low to adequately serve struggling tribal home-
owners and other homeowners living in rural 
areas. The remaining 40 percent of funds are 
not income limited and must be targeted to so-
cially disadvantaged individuals, which the 
Committee expects will capture homeowners 
of color, including Black, Latinx, Asian, and 
Native American homeowners across the in-
come spectrum who have been shown to be 
at disproportionate risk of being delinquent on 
their mortgages and at risk of foreclosure due 
to having lower savings and less wealth on 
average compared to White homeowners. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s weekly 
Pulse Survey data, Black, Latinx, and Asian 
homeowners have consistently been more 
than twice as likely as White homeowners, de-
spite age, sex, income, and geography, to be 
behind on their mortgage payments. Similarly, 
a survey conducted by Fannie Mae found that 
51 percent of Black homeowners and 65 per-
cent of Latinx homeowners were not familiar 
with 
forbearance 
relief 
options 
provided 
through the CARES Act, despite being the 
populations with the greatest need. 
The Committee expects that Treasury’s im-
plementation and administration of the Fund 
will include proper oversight and reporting re-
quirements to monitor and ensure HAF fund-
ing properly reaches and serves the popu-
lations that have been documented to be ex-
periencing disproportionate need during the 
current crisis. Adequate reporting should be 
made publicly available on a quarterly basis 
and include the types and amount of assist-
ance provided, the terms of such assistance, 
with the data disaggregated by locality, race, 
ethnicity, sex, and other factors that provide 
transparency and oversight in accordance with 
the law. Such reporting will also be essential 
in Treasury’s ability to implement the HAF Re-
allocation provision. 
While the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, in coordination with the Depart-
ment of Justice, is responsible for the enforce-
ment of the Fair Housing Act (FHAct), the 
FHAct requires that all federal housing pro-
grams and funds be administered in ways that 
affirmatively further fair housing and do not 
perpetuate historically inequitable distribution 
of housing funds. Therefore, both Treasury 
and eligible entities have a legal responsibility 
to affirmatively further fair housing through 
HAF, and to ensure that the administration of 
housing relief funds do not have a disparate 
impact on protected classes under the FHAct. 
The federal government must avoid its mis-
takes of the past that have resulted in the lop-
sided, inequitable provision of housing relief 
that fails to meet the needs of hardest hit 
communities that are often the lowest income 
communities and communities of color. In sup-
port of these efforts, Section 3208 provides 
$20 million for HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives 
Program to support housing discrimination 
complaint intake and on-the-ground fair hous-
ing investigations. 
Additionally, Treasury must provide eligible 
entities with clear and standard guidance early 
on in its administration of HAF to facilitate 
proper and expeditious implementation. The 
Committee expects Treasury to clarify that as-
sistance provided through HAF should not be 
considered income for a homeowner receiving 
relief. Additionally, Treasury should make sure 
it is made clear as early on as possible that 
eligible entities can utilize a portion of their 
HAF funds to establish and administer their 
programs, similar to what was allowed through 
HHF. The Committee also expects that the 
Treasury will allow eligible entities that over-
estimate funding needs for administrative pur-
poses to transfer and use such funds in the 
provision of assistance to homeowners. 
Following the 2008 financial crisis and Great 
Recession, Congress established the State 
Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) that 
provided $1.5 billion to the Department of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1283 
March 10, 2021 
Treasury (Treasury) to fund various state, ter-
ritory, and local small business loan and in-
vestment programs. This program was lever-
aged to support $10.7 billion in new financing 
to small businesses, helping to create or save 
more than 240,000 jobs. The median small 
business size supported by SSBCI had 3 full 
time employees, and the median loan or in-
vestment amount was $33,000. Approximately 
41 percent of SSBCI supported transactions 
went to women or minority-owned businesses. 
This successful program expired in 2017. 
In light of the widespread challenges small 
businesses, especially minority-owned busi-
nesses, have faced during the COVID–19 
pandemic, Section 3301 would effectively re-
authorize the SSBCI, providing $10 billion in 
federal funds to support up to $100 billion in 
new loans and investments for small busi-
nesses through state, territory, tribal, and local 
small business programs. This amount in-
cludes up to $2.5 billion in federal funds to 
support business enterprises owned and con-
trolled by socially and economically disadvan-
taged individuals, including minority-owned 
businesses. This amount also includes up to 
$500 million for tribal government programs, 
and $500 million to provide technical assist-
ance to small businesses that need legal, ac-
counting, financial and other kinds of advice in 
applying for small business support programs. 
As the renewed SSBCI is stood up, the 
Treasury should provide adequate support to 
small businesses, especially very small busi-
nesses and those owned by socially and eco-
nomically disadvantaged individuals. Socially 
and economically disadvantaged individuals 
may include racial and ethnic minorities, 
women, indigenous people, veterans, or oth-
ers who have been marginalized by their so-
cial or economic conditions. Additionally, 
through the program requirements Treasury is 
authorized to establish and through other 
means, the Committee expects Treasury to 
closely oversee states’ expenditure of $2.5 bil-
lion funds that are to directly support busi-
nesses owned by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals, including estab-
lishing a minimum level of support states and 
other jurisdictions receiving funds provide to 
these businesses. 
In addition, the Treasury should require 
states to provide a specific plan to engage mi-
nority depository institutions (MDIs), commu-
nity development financial institutions (CDFIs) 
and other mission-driven lenders who have a 
strong track record of supporting small and mi-
nority-owned businesses. Treasury should 
also require states to a COVID–19 pandemic 
response plan with their application, describing 
how the state will expeditiously utilize funds to 
support small businesses, including business 
enterprises owned and controlled by socially 
and economically disadvantaged individuals, in 
responding to and recovering from the eco-
nomic effects of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Moreover, Treasury should also require states 
to agree that no lending activity supported by 
SSBCI funds would result in predatory lending, 
including charging interest rates in excess of 
36 percent annual percentage rate under the 
Military Lending Act. 
With respect to the technical assistance 
funds made available under Section 3301, 
Treasury should maximize the ability to deploy 
these funds to the Minority Business Develop-
ment Agency (MBDA) at the Department of 
Commerce, which could expedite support to a 
network of business counselors, minority 
chambers of commerce and non-profit organi-
zations that are already providing such serv-
ices in their communities. Further, given re-
search demonstrating that increasing em-
ployee ownership is one way to help narrow 
gender and racial wealth gaps, the Committee 
encourages Treasury to provide funds to 
states that use the funds to support state em-
ployee ownership centers that provide tech-
nical assistance to businesses, including pro-
viding resources on how small businesses can 
offer workers employee stock ownership 
plans. 
Furthermore, the Committee expects that 
the Treasury will provide timely information re-
garding the use of these funds. The Treasury 
should require the gathering of data on pro-
gram implementation, including but not limited 
to, demographics on program participants and 
interest rates assessed by lenders and inves-
tors. This data should be reported to the pub-
lic and the appropriate congressional commit-
tees of jurisdiction, as well as shared with ap-
propriate federal audit agencies, such as the 
Inspector General’s office and the Government 
Accountability Office, for review. 
The CARES Act, signed into law on March 
27, 2020, established the Payroll Support Pro-
gram (PSP), which provided $32 billion in pay-
roll support for workers employed by airlines, 
cargo air carriers, and contractors servicing air 
carriers at airports. Through the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2021, Congress ap-
proved the Payroll Support Program Extension 
(PSP2), which provided short-term relief to the 
same class of workers as PSP until March 31, 
2021. According to some estimates, major 
U.S. airlines lost over $35 billion in 2020, and 
require additional assistance to support their 
workforce. Therefore, Section 7301 would pro-
vide $15 billion to further extend the Payroll 
Support Program (PSP3) through at least Sep-
tember 30, 2021, to provide payroll support for 
airline workers and related contract workers. 
Specifically, PSP3 would provide $14 billion to 
support workers of eligible air carriers, and $1 
billion would be available to support workers 
of eligible contractors. Given the budget rec-
onciliation process and the need to rely on the 
PSP2 distribution framework, the Committee 
urges Treasury to implement this program in a 
robust and fair manner so that all entities eligi-
ble for PSP2 and PSP3 are able to access the 
program and provide ongoing support for its 
workforce. 
Like other businesses, airports and airport 
concessions have been hit hard during the 
pandemic. To help ensure those businesses 
and their workers get the support they need 
until the public health emergency is over and 
normal activity resumes, Section 7102 pro-
vides $8 billion in relief for airports, including 
at least $800 million to support airport conces-
sions. In administering the program, the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration (FAA) should im-
plement this program along with the relief pro-
gram Congress enacted into law through the 
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supple-
mental Appropriation Act on December 27, 
2020, holistically and prioritize support for mi-
nority-owned businesses, including Airport 
Concession Disadvantaged Business Enter-
prises (ACDBEs). Moreover, Section 7102 rec-
ognizes the interconnected ecosystem that 
many airport concessions operate in, including 
through joint ventures and other partnerships 
with large airport concessions they receive in-
direct support from. As such, the FAA should 
support the full ecosystem while taking all nec-
essary steps to ensure small and minority- 
owned concessions, regardless of the contrac-
tual arrangements those entities are a party to 
as an airport concession (e.g. joint venture, 
sub-tenant under a master lease or master de-
veloper, etc.), receive robust rent and fee 
abatement as expeditiously as possible. While 
Section 7102 provides airports with critical 
funding to support airport concessionaires, the 
amount appropriated is less than what stake-
holders have indicated is necessary to support 
workers and promote stability during this dif-
ficult time. Given the key role concessionaires 
of all types provide to the traveling public and 
to airport finances, I encourage the FAA and 
other federal agencies to find ways to provide 
additional financial and other support to the 
airport concessions ecosystem during this 
challenging time. 
Mr. Speaker, individuals, families and small 
businesses are in urgent need of assistance. 
This legislation delivers robust relief to com-
munities across the country during this pan-
demic crisis. Colleagues, please join me and 
vote yes for H.R. 1319. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on 
behalf of tribal nations in Arizona and across 
the nation that are struggling to protect the 
health and welfare of their citizens. 
As Chairman of the Subcommittee for Indig-
enous Peoples of the U.S. last Congress, I 
heard from countless leaders about how this 
pandemic has impacted them. We heard their 
stories about the loss of elders, the challenges 
their children face trying to engage in distance 
learning without access to broadband internet, 
and the near total collapse of on-reservation 
economies that provide critical jobs for tribal 
members and funds for government services. 
While the CARES Act funding passed last 
year for Tribes was a lifeline, it was not nearly 
enough to address the disparate impact of this 
pandemic on Indigenous people and commu-
nities across the country. That is why I fought 
so hard to ensure that Tribes would not be 
short-changed in further COVID–19 relief ef-
forts and why I am so proud that House and 
Senate Democratic leadership has approved 
the largest one-time investment in Native com-
munities in our history. 
The American Rescue Plan includes more 
than $28 billion for tribal governments. This is 
a real, meaningful investment that will allow 
Native communities to respond to the wide- 
ranging effects of the virus on their commu-
nities and that will begin to address the 
shameful federal history of ignoring the needs 
of Native communities. 
The package specifically includes $20 billion 
in direct relief for Tribal governments. Impor-
tantly, these funds will be able to be used 
more flexibly by Tribes than CARES Act relief 
dollars, enabling Tribes to help struggling busi-
nesses cover the cost of employees, develop 
21st century infrastructure, and address the 
health and economic barriers that worsened 
the pandemic in Tribal nations. Additionally, 
many tribal communities have lost elders who 
are the keepers of their languages, history, 
and cultural teachings at an alarming rate— 
the loss of this knowledge exacerbating the 
existing crisis of Native language loss. Amer-
ican Rescue Plan funding will be critical for 
Tribes to cover government programs that will 
help preserve Native languages and culture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1284 
March 10, 2021 
Last Congress, the Subcommittee for Indig-
enous Peoples heard from Tribes about inad-
equacies in the distribution of Coronavirus Re-
lief Funds to Tribes under the CARES Act. 
The decision to solely rely on Indian Housing 
Block Grant formula for the calculation of tribal 
population resulted in dramatically inaccurate 
counts for many Tribes. I have been very en-
couraged by this administration’s renewed 
commitment to Tribal consultation, and I urge 
the administration to continue to make good 
on that commitment by consulting with and de-
ferring to Tribes on the fairest and most accu-
rate way to determine Tribal enrollment popu-
lation for the purposes of the American Res-
cue Plan. 
Finally, in order to maximize the effective-
ness of this historic investment in Native com-
munities, the American Rescue Plan relief 
funding must be distributed on an equitable 
basis. That is why I am proud of the American 
Rescue Plan’s establishment of a minimum 
payment to ensure every Tribe receives a 
strong baseline of support. We also heard 
from Tribes that equitable distribution should 
include the utilization of both Tribal population 
and economic and employment data. Once 
again, it is my hope that the Biden Administra-
tion will rely on Tribal consultation in this area 
when deciding how best to distribute this des-
perately needed relief in an equitable, timely, 
and effective manner. 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity 
to highlight this important and historic invest-
ment in Tribal Nations, who have showed 
leadership and resilience even as COVID–19 
devastated their communities. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues and with this Ad-
ministration to ensure quick and effective im-
plementation of this bill in the coming weeks. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the American Rescue 
Plan. This bill provides needed relief for our 
communities. 
Since Congress acted on the last COVID– 
19 package in December, over 100,000 Amer-
icans have died from this deadly disease. Eco-
nomic growth remains stagnant, millions of 
Americans remain unemployed, and many 
worry that their jobs may have disappeared 
forever. And, even as vaccine distribution ef-
forts ramp up, it is clear that our nation is not 
out of the woods yet. Metrics of housing inse-
curity, hunger, poverty are all trending in the 
wrong direction. 
While I have concerns about some of the 
changes made in the Senate, overall, the 
package still delivers key aid to hurting com-
munities, individuals, and businesses that con-
tinues to be needed. This package helps sup-
port child care, a key employment enabler— 
without which so many women have dropped 
out of the workforce during this pandemic, ac-
cording to a growing body of evidence. It pro-
vides rental and housing relief to prevent a 
wave of evictions and resulting hardships in 
our community. In the long run, it costs the 
government less to keep people housed than 
dealing with the consequences that follow 
eviction. 
The American Rescue Plan gives critical 
support for our state and local governments, 
which have been on the front lines of this fight 
while their revenues have fallen. As a result, 
they have shed public employees at high rates 
in the last year—a disturbing consequence 
that must be reversed. 
The bill helps put money in the pocket of 
hurting families, with another round of stimulus 
checks which if the past is any precedent, will 
be spent to meet immediate needs. It extends 
UI, funds SNAP, provides additional help to 
get health insurance which is even more crit-
ical during a public health emergency. It refills 
FEMA’s disaster assistance fund, provides 
funding so that schools can reopen safely or 
continue to do virtual learning effectively, pro-
vides assistance to public transit systems, and 
provides pension relief, among many other 
provisions. 
Does this bill do all the things I would want? 
No. I would love to have gone further to de-
liver greater relief. But it is a good enough 
start and helps address some key challenges 
and will help expedite recovery in our commu-
nities on the long and challenging road ahead. 
I thank the President for his leadership, as 
well as the Speaker, and Chairman NEAL. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of The American Res-
cue Plan Act of 2021. 
The legislation will provide much needed re-
lief to both individuals and communities. 
The COVID–19 pandemic will leave an in-
delible scar on our nation. 
It will also be remembered as a time of re-
markable achievement. 
I rise today specifically to talk about the 
achievements of scientists and engineers 
across the nation who jumped into action from 
the earliest days of the pandemic. 
Biologists, physicists, computer scientists, 
engineers, social scientists . . . there were 
few fields that did not contribute. 
The vaccines would not have been possible 
without expertise from many fields. 
While they achieved so much, many sci-
entific and technological questions remain that 
will be essential to our long-term recovery. 
I am proud that this legislation includes 
$750 million in funding through the National 
Science Foundation and the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology for additional re-
search related to COVID–19. 
I also acknowledge that this is not enough, 
and I will continue to advocate for research re-
covery funding to ensure we do not suffer irre-
versible loss to our science and innovation ca-
pacity. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, the American 
people deserve better. 
They’ve been told that this bill is about 
Covid, but less than a dime of every dollar 
goes to Covid vaccines and defeating the 
virus. 
They’ve been told that this is a stimulus, but 
it doesn’t do anything to stimulate the econ-
omy—in fact, it could make it even worse, es-
pecially paired with President Biden’s war on 
energy jobs, and Democrats’ looming efforts to 
raise your taxes. 
The White House refuses to tell the Amer-
ican people how many jobs it will create be-
cause they know it won’t create jobs. It won’t 
even secure the jobs most Americans have. 
The February jobs report shows that, al-
though we are far behind where we were prior 
to the pandemic, jobs are picking up. 
We could help Black Americans, Asian 
Americans, women, and those without college 
degrees get a stronger foothold in the work-
force. 
But Democrats are leaving them behind 
today. This won’t lift people out of poverty, it 
will only create more barriers out of it. 
The only jobs this bill is intended to secure 
are those of political friends. It’s a political 
payoff. 
The list of things Democrats left out of the 
House bill was bad enough. 
They preferred to pay people more to stay 
at home than go to work. 
They left behind poor kids in West Virginia 
in order to give preference to Democrat states. 
They left behind kids who want to go to 
school by sending money to schools that will 
stay closed. 
They left behind front-line health-care work-
ers without protections from frivolous lawsuits. 
They left behind the millions of Americans 
whose identities were stolen during acts of un-
employment insurance fraud. 
They left behind the #JoeJobless—the vic-
tims of President Biden’s war on energy. 
They left behind special-needs kids and 
their parents who need help saving for their 
therapies. 
They left behind families who worry about 
losing the doubled child tax credit. 
They left behind the unborn by allowing 
health care dollars to be used for abortions. 
They left behind the families of the victims 
of Governor Cuomo’s mismanagement by re-
fusing to require governors to report accurate 
data on their nursing home deaths. 
They even rejected more fixes offered by 
colleagues in the Senate. 
Republicans wanted to provide more sup-
port for resident and employee safety in nurs-
ing facilities. Democrats said no. 
Republicans 
said 
let’s 
target 
stimulus 
checks towards those who have lost jobs, 
people who don’t need to pay rent, or buy gro-
ceries. Democrats said no, let’s send checks 
to prisoners. 
Republicans said let’s make sure stimulus 
checks go to Americans who need them. 
Democrats said no, let’s allow them to go to 
people in this country illegally because they’ve 
overstayed their visas. During a crisis on the 
border? Really? 
Just one year ago, Democrats said it was 
not possible that we would have a vaccine in 
a year. Our own President and Vice President 
said they would not trust such a vaccine. 
Today, we have several vaccines. And, un-
less I’m mistaken, every member in this 
Chamber has had an opportunity to receive 
one. 
Every American that we serve, however, 
has not. And yet the Democrats’ Covid bill is 
1 percent about the vaccines they didn’t be-
lieve would exist. 
Democrats are today saying that there is 
nothing they could have done to make a $1.9 
trillion bill more targeted, while admitting 
there’s plenty of waste, and yet still defending 
funding for museums. 
We did better when we worked together. 
Through December, over five Covid aid bills, 
Republicans and Democrats, we worked tire-
lessly to deliver over $3.5 trillion, the largest 
amount of relief in American history. 
Instead, we have this political payoff, which 
leaves Americans behind, while Democrats 
demand they foot the bill for it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. SABAN. Mr. Speaker, One year ago, 
the bottom fell out for the people of the North-
ern Mariana Islands. Our tourism-dependent 
economy suddenly had no tourists. Busi-
nesses began closing. People were laid off. 
Schools closed. And government revenues 
plunged. 
We were fortunate that, as islands with few 
access points, we could keep the coronavirus

at bay and remain healthy by screening every 
arrival. 
And we were fortunate to receive the eco-
nomic help we needed from the federal gov-
ernment and from our fellow Americans. We 
will be forever grateful. 
Now vaccinations have begun. We are roll-
ing up our sleeves to take the shot and to get 
back to work. But when will tourists feel safe 
to travel to our islands? And when will we feel 
safe allowing tourists to return? Like so much 
of what has happened over this last year, we 
cannot predict. 
That is why passage of the American Res-
cue Plan today is so important. The Rescue 
Plan will keep us healthy and economically 
sound as we make our way forward in this un-
predictable future caused by the coronavirus. 
Those who remain laid off will continue to 
receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Com-
pensation, as they have since we passed the 
CARES Act last March. 
Taxpayers will receive another economic im-
pact payment, $1,400, and more dependent 
children will qualify for additional aid. 
Our K–12 schools, which have managed to 
reopen on a limited basis, will remain open, 
because the Rescue Plan has $160 million to 
make sure teachers and staff can be paid. 
And the Northern Marians College and its stu-
dents will also get the help needed to continue 
studies. 
Childcare providers, another critical small 
business, get an assist to stay open, bene-
fiting working parents who depend on these 
services. Working families will, also, see their 
Child Tax Credit increase. And because we 
were able to amend the Rescue Plan to make 
Marianas’ taxpayers eligible for the advance 
monthly payment of CTC, just like Americans 
nationwide, island parents will be getting that 
money when it is most useful: to meet the im-
mediate needs of growing children. 
Working families in the Marianas will also 
now—for the first time in twenty-five years— 
receive the Earned Income Tax Credit that is 
key to keeping Americans who work out of 
poverty. 
And for those who still cannot work or 
whose incomes are insufficient, we have in-
cluded $30 million to provide food assistance 
in the Marianas and funds for housing, so no 
one need lose the roof over their head. 
Last but not least, I want to recognize the 
importance of the Coronavirus State and Local 
Fiscal Recovery Fund included in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. I know this money was kept 
out of the relief measure we enacted in De-
cember, in part because of criticism this was 
a ‘‘blue state bailout.’’ Believe me, the Mari-
anas is neither blue nor a state. We are sim-
ply a community of Americans, who have 
been crushed economically by this pandemic; 
and this fiscal aid to our state and municipal 
governments will fund police and keep other 
public servants employed, providing the serv-
ices every community needs. 
Without the help of the federal government 
and the caring support of our fellow Americans 
the people of the Marianas would have suf-
fered terribly over this last year. Instead, we 
remain healthy. Our children are in school. 
And we are ready to build back better, once 
this pandemic is finally behind us. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the importance of the $31 
billion allocated to tribal governments under 
the American Rescue Plan (ARP), which in-
cludes a critical investment of $20 billion for 
direct relief for the 574 federally recognized 
tribal nations across the United States. 
As you know, this funding is a lifeline to Na-
tive communities, who have suffered the most 
devastating and disproportionate impact of the 
public health and economic crises of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This $20 billion fund is 
critical for tribal governments to address the 
economic losses and health disparities that 
were left unaddressed through funding dedi-
cated under the CARES Act, and I applaud 
your leadership to prioritize tribal nations in 
the ARP since the federal government’s trust 
responsibility 
has 
largely 
been 
ignored 
throughout history. 
In an effort to strengthen the intended goal 
of investing these funds into Indian Country, I 
first and foremost would like to stress that the 
federal government’s trust responsibility to our 
tribal nations is of upmost importance. It is ab-
solutely essential that in its implementation of 
the American Rescue Plan Act and in its dis-
tribution of funding allocations, the Department 
of the Treasury fully and properly consults with 
tribal leaders across the country, as required 
by law. Additionally, in my conversations with 
tribal leaders over the last year, I have heard 
three main concerns about relief fund alloca-
tions for Native communities that are ad-
dressed in turn below. 
First, I respectfully suggest clarification of 
the ARP language of Section 9901, indicating 
how the $19 of the $20 billion direct relief for 
tribal governments is to be allocated by Treas-
ury to ensure economic recovery funds can be 
used in a flexible manner, which was left 
unaddressed under the CARES Act. The avail-
ability of flexible spending is of grave impor-
tance since tribal governments faced signifi-
cant impacts from COVID–19 and, as a result, 
lost critical government revenue. It is esti-
mated that tribal nations sustained 35 percent 
revenue loss in 2020 since they lack tradi-
tional tax bases enjoyed by state and local 
governments. Thus, tribal enterprise revenues 
supply a majority of funding for basic govern-
ment services to make up for these losses. 
As it stands, the language in this bill allows 
the Department of the Treasury to implement 
this Fund such that tribes are able to meet 
their individual and unique needs, whether it 
be addressing employment costs, providing 
health care or education, or investing in much- 
needed infrastructure. That flexibility is owed 
as a measure of tribal sovereignty, and I will 
work with the Department of the Treasury to 
ensure that the bill is implemented as such. 
Second, the Department of the Treasury 
must conduct robust tribal consultation with 
tribal nations to determine the most effective 
and fair ways of measuring tribal population 
figures. Again, this issue was left largely 
unaddressed under the language of the 
CARES Act, and the past administration’s de-
cision to utilize the Indian Housing Block Grant 
formula for its tribal population calculation re-
sulted 
in 
inaccurate 
funding 
distributions 
across the country. I urge the Department to 
ask tribal governments to submit comments on 
their preferred population metrics, and actually 
take those comments into account in an effort 
to strengthen our government-to-government 
relationship with tribal nations. 
Finally, Congress’s intent for the tribal set- 
aside in the Fund is to provide an equitable al-
location between economic and population- 
based factors. The Department of the Treas-
ury must provide a strong baseline of support 
for all tribal governments, ensuring that no 
tribes are excluded from these funds, in addi-
tion to considerations for revenue losses and 
cost increases. 
I thank the Speaker for the opportunity to 
speak to this historic investment in Indian 
County, and for continued work to uphold the 
Federal trust responsibility to the 574 federally 
recognized tribal nations in the United States. 
I look forward to working with the Department 
of the Treasury on swift implementation of this 
landmark legislation.

for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 198,

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
VEASEY) laid before the House the fol-
lowing resignation from the House of 
Representatives: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 10, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI: It has been my 
honor and privilege to serve the people of the 
11th Congressional District of Ohio since No-
vember 2008. My appreciation for their sup-
port as I sought to represent their interests 
and those of many Americans for whom I 
could be a voice is boundless. 
I will always remember my colleagues and 
friends who have become a part of my family 
during the last twelve years. I am fortunate 
to have been selected by President Joe Biden 
to continue to serve the public good as Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Development. 
Therefore, please accept this correspond-
ence as notice of my resignation from the 
U.S. House of Representatives, 11th Congres-
sional District of Ohio, effective imme-
diately upon delivery on March 10, 2021. 
Thank you for your leadership and support 
during my tenure. 
Sincerely, 
MARCIA L. FUDGE. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 10, 2021. 
Hon. MIKE DEWINE, 
Governor of Ohio, 
Columbus, OH. 
DEAR GOVERNOR DEWINE: Effective March 
10, 2021, I have resigned my seat in the U.S. 
House of Representatives representing the 
11th Congressional District of Ohio. Enclosed 
is a copy of my letter of resignation to the 
Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, which 
was hand delivered to her this afternoon. 
An Ohioan born and bred, serving the peo-
ple of the 11th Congressional District has 
been an honor. My selection by President 
Joe Biden as Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development and confirmation by the Sen-
ate will allow me to continue to serve the 
public good. 
Thank you for your leadership of our great 
State. 
Sincerely, 
MARCIA L. FUDGE.

COMMUNICATION FROM LEGISLA-
TIVE 
CORRESPONDENT, 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MARILYN 
STRICK-
LAND, MEMBER OF CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from Elizabeth Beltran, legis-
lative correspondent, the Honorable 
MARILYN STRICKLAND, Member of Con-
gress: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 5, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI. 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: This is to notify 
you formally, pursuant to Rule VIII of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, that 
I, Elizabeth Beltran, have been served with 
subpoenas for testimony issued by the 
United States District Court for the Middle 
District of Florida. The testimony sought re-
lates to events witnessed while I was em-
ployed by the Speaker’s office as a Staff As-
sistant. 
After consultation with the Office of Gen-
eral Counsel, I have determined that compli-
ance with the subpoenas is consistent with 
the privileges and rights of the House. 
Sincerely, 
ELIZABETH BELTRAN, 
Legislative Correspondent.

BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND 
CHECKS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 188, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 8) to require a background 
check for every firearm sale, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to utilize the 
current background checks process in the 
United States to ensure individuals prohib-
ited from gun possession are not able to ob-
tain firearms. 
SEC. 3. FIREARMS TRANSFERS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 922 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(aa)(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any per-
son who is not a licensed importer, licensed 
manufacturer, or licensed dealer to transfer 
a firearm to any other person who is not so 
licensed, unless a licensed importer, licensed 
manufacturer, or licensed dealer has first 
taken possession of the firearm for the pur-
pose of complying with subsection (t). 
‘‘(B) Upon taking possession of a firearm 
under subparagraph (A), a licensee shall 
comply with all requirements of this chapter 
as if the licensee were transferring the fire-
arm from the inventory of the licensee to the 
unlicensed transferee.

March 10, 2021 
‘‘(C) If a transfer of a firearm described in 
subparagraph (A) will not be completed for 
any reason after a licensee takes possession 
of the firearm (including because the trans-
fer of the firearm to, or receipt of the fire-
arm by, the transferee would violate this 
chapter), the return of the firearm to the 
transferor by the licensee shall not con-
stitute the transfer of a firearm for purposes 
of this chapter. 
‘‘(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to— 
‘‘(A) a law enforcement agency or any law 
enforcement officer, armed private security 
professional, or member of the armed forces, 
to the extent the officer, professional, or 
member is acting within the course and 
scope of employment and official duties; 
‘‘(B) a transfer that is a loan or bona fide 
gift between spouses, between domestic part-
ners, between parents and their children, in-
cluding step-parents and their step-children, 
between siblings, between aunts or uncles 
and their nieces or nephews, or between 
grandparents and their grandchildren, if the 
transferor has no reason to believe that the 
transferee will use or intends to use the fire-
arm in a crime or is prohibited from pos-
sessing firearms under State or Federal law; 
‘‘(C) a transfer to an executor, adminis-
trator, trustee, or personal representative of 
an estate or a trust that occurs by operation 
of law upon the death of another person; 
‘‘(D) a temporary transfer that is nec-
essary to prevent imminent death or great 
bodily harm, including harm to self, family, 
household members, or others, if the posses-
sion by the transferee lasts only as long as 
immediately necessary to prevent the immi-
nent death or great bodily harm, including 
the harm of domestic violence, dating part-
ner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and 
domestic abuse; 
‘‘(E) a transfer that is approved by the At-
torney General under section 5812 of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986; or 
‘‘(F) a temporary transfer if the transferor 
has no reason to believe that the transferee 
will use or intends to use the firearm in a 
crime or is prohibited from possessing fire-
arms under State or Federal law, and the 
transfer takes place and the transferee’s pos-
session of the firearm is exclusively— 
‘‘(i) at a shooting range or in a shooting 
gallery or other area designated for the pur-
pose of target shooting; 
‘‘(ii) while reasonably necessary for the 
purposes of hunting, trapping, or fishing, if 
the transferor— 
‘‘(I) has no reason to believe that the 
transferee intends to use the firearm in a 
place where it is illegal; and 
‘‘(II) has reason to believe that the trans-
feree will comply with all licensing and per-
mit requirements for such hunting, trapping, 
or fishing; or 
‘‘(iii) while in the presence of the trans-
feror. 
‘‘(3) It shall be unlawful for a licensed im-
porter, licensed manufacturer, or licensed 
dealer to transfer possession of, or title to, a 
firearm to another person who is not so li-
censed unless the importer, manufacturer, or 
dealer has provided such other person with a 
notice of the prohibition under paragraph (1), 
and such other person has certified that such 
other person has been provided with this no-
tice on a form prescribed by the Attorney 
General.’’. 
(b) AMENDMENT TO SECTION 924(a).—Section 
924(a)(5) of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by striking ‘‘(s) or (t)’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘(s), (t), or (aa)’’. 
(c) RULES OF INTERPRETATION.—Nothing in 
this Act, or any amendment made by this 
Act, shall be construed to— 
(1) authorize the establishment, directly or 
indirectly, of a national firearms registry; or 
(2) interfere with the authority of a State, 
under section 927 of title 18, United States 
Code, to enact a law on the same subject 
matter as this Act. 
(d) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by subsections (a) and (b) shall take ef-
fect 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
b 1415 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 8. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, gun violence impacts 
all of our communities, and no place is 
immune from its reach, including our 
homes, our streets, our schools, and 
even our places of worship. That is why 
we must take swift and decisive action 
to reduce the daily toll of gun violence 
that afflicts our Nation. H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of 
2021 is sensible and effective legislation 
to do just that. 
Under current law, gun sales con-
ducted by licensed firearms dealers 
may only be completed if the buyers 
clear background checks. This bill 
would simply extend that requirement, 
with limited exceptions, to guns trans-
ferred by unlicensed individuals as 
well. That simple change to close a 
gaping loophole in the law is one of the 
most effective steps we can take to ad-
dress the scourge of gun violence in 
this country. 
According to one study, 22 percent of 
gun owners in the U.S. acquired their 
most recent firearm without a back-
ground check. We do not know if they 
were felons, fugitives, domestic abus-
ers, or otherwise prohibited under the 
law from possessing firearms. A huge 
volume of guns was sold with no ques-
tions asked. It is time to close this 
dangerous loophole. 
There is no reason to continue to 
make it easy for people who are legally 
prohibited from possessing firearms to 
acquire them. The evidence clearly 
shows that background checks work 
and significantly curb gun violence. 
One study found that a Connecticut 
law requiring background checks was 
associated with a 40 percent decline in 
gun homicides and a 15 percent drop in 
suicides. On the other hand, when Mis-
souri repealed its background check 
law, the State’s gun homicides in-
creased by 23 percent and suicides in-
creased by 16 percent. 
Gun violence of this magnitude is a 
distinctly American problem. A recent 
study in the American Journal of Medi-
cine found that compared to 29 other 
high-income countries, the gun-related 
murder rate in the United States is 25 
times higher. Even when you adjust for 
population differences, Americans are 
disproportionately killed by gun vio-
lence. This is a disparity that we can 
remedy by passing this bill. 
With the exception of certain limited 
transfers, such as gifts to family mem-
bers and transfers for hunting, target 
shooting, and self-defense, H.R. 8 would 
extend the current Federal background 
check requirement—which applies now 
only 
to 
licensed 
gun 
dealers—and 
would 
require 
virtually 
all 
trans-
actions to undergo a background check 
to help ensure that firearms do not end 
up in the wrong hands. 
I thank Representative MIKE THOMP-
SON of California for drafting this im-
portant legislation and for being a 
champion of gun violence prevention in 
Congress. 
Simply put, H.R. 8 will save lives. I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation and to support safer streets, 
safer schools, and safer communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE), 
the co-chair of the Second Amendment 
Caucus. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, Demo-
crats today want to introduce gun con-
trol legislation that they say is going 
to make you safer. They want to ex-
pand background checks. 
But what do background checks ac-
complish? 
Well, the DOJ said there were 112,000 
denials in a year. 
Who were those 112,000 people? 
Well, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle would have you think those 
were felons, they saved you from those 
felons. 
But how many of those 112,000 were 
prosecuted for that crime of trying to 
acquire that gun? 
According to the DOJ, 12—1–2—12 in a 
year. 
Who were the other 100,000? 
Imagine, just imagine now that you 
are the victim of an abusive relation-
ship and after 5 years you have sum-
moned the courage and the resources 
to separate from that relationship, but 
things have escalated and now you 
have decided that it is time to acquire 
the means to protect you and your 
children. So you go to the gun store 
and you try to buy a gun. The clerk 
presses the computer button, and it 
says ‘‘denied.’’ 
You ask the clerk, ‘‘Why was it de-
nied?’’ 
The clerk says, ‘‘I don’t know. This 
happens sometimes. Maybe you had a 
similar name to somebody else in the 
database.’’ 
You can’t buy a gun today, tomor-
row, next week. Not ever. You have

been denied. So you go to a friend you 
have known for a long time. Your 
friend says, ‘‘I would like to help you.’’ 
You say, ‘‘Well, I don’t know if I am 
going to make it through the night.’’ 
Your friend says, ‘‘I would like to 
help you, but don’t you know H.R. 8 
passed and it was signed by the Presi-
dent. I can’t spend a year in a cage. 
Good luck tonight.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, now, I am not going to 
ask you to imagine what happens next 
because the Democrats saw fit to put 
into this bill a requirement that you 
have an imminent threat of death. The 
threat has to be right there upon you 
or great bodily harm. 
What do they say? 
Well, if you are just expecting a few 
bruises and maybe a punch, put some 
ice on it. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my 
colleagues here today and I am going 
to challenge the sponsors of this bill 
and those of them who might think 
they would vote for this bill to con-
sider whether it is fair. 
Is it fair to surround yourself with 
armed guards, with Capitol Hill Police 
who have guns, with personal details, 
bodyguards, and ask the people to pay 
for it when you make it harder for 
those same people to protect them-
selves? 
I don’t think that is fair. 
And for the fact checkers who are al-
ready hard at work on this speech, I in-
clude in the RECORD this GAO report on 
the 
DOJ 
statistics 
on 
background 
checks. 
[From the United States Government 
Accountability Office, Sept. 2018] 
Report 
to 
the 
Ranking 
Member, 
Sub-
committee on Commerce, Justice, Science, 
and Related Agencies, Committee on Ap-
propriations, House of Representatives 
LAW ENFORCEMENT—FEW INDIVIDUALS DENIED 
FIREARMS PURCHASES ARE PROSECUTED AND 
ATF SHOULD ASSESS USE OF WARNING NO-
TICES IN LIEU OF PROSECUTIONS 
WHY GAO DID THIS STUDY 
In 2017, approximately 25.6 million firearm- 
related background checks were processed 
through NICS, and about 181,000 of the at-
tempted purchases at the federal and state 
levels combined were denied because the in-
dividual was prohibited from possessing a 
firearm under federal or state law. Individ-
uals who certify that they are not prohibited 
from purchasing or receiving a firearm and 
are subsequently determined to be prohib-
ited could be subject to investigation, and if 
prosecuted, a fine, imprisonment, or both. 
GAO was asked to examine firearms deni-
als. This report (1) describes the extent to 
which federal and selected state law enforce-
ment agencies investigate and prosecute 
firearms denial cases; (2) examines related 
challenges faced by these agencies; and (3) 
describes the circumstances that lead to in-
vestigations and prosecutions. GAO reviewed 
laws and regulations; analyzed federal and 
state data from 2011 through 2017; and inter-
viewed officials from ATF headquarters, 6 of 
25 ATF field divisions (the 6 that inves-
tigated the most cases), and the 13 states 
that process all NICS checks within their 
state. Results from state interviews are not 
generalizable but provide insights on state 
practices. 
WHAT GAO RECOMMENDS 
GAO recommends that ATF assess the ex-
tent to which ATF field divisions use warn-
ing notifications as an enforcement tool, 
which would inform whether changes to pol-
icy are needed. DOJ concurred with GAO’s

Investigations and prosecutions. Federal 
and selected state law enforcement agencies 
that 
process 
firearm-related 
background 
checks through the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System (NICS) collec-
tively investigate and prosecute a small per-
centage of individuals who falsify informa-
tion on a firearms form (e.g., do not disclose 
a felony conviction) and are denied a pur-
chase. Federal NICS checks resulted in about 
112,000 denied transactions in fiscal year) 
2017, of which the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) re-
ferred about 12,700 to its field divisions for 
further investigation. U.S. Attorney’s Offices 
(USAO) had prosecuted 12 of these cases as of 
June 2018.

At the state level, officials from 10 of 13 se-
lected states said they did not investigate or 
prosecute firearm denials, some citing com-
peting resource demands and the lack of 
statutes with which states prosecute as rea-
sons. The remaining 3 states investigated a 
high proportion of firearms denials. One of 
the 3 states reported about 1,900 referrals for 
prosecution in 2017 and about 470 convic-
tions. 
Challenges. ATF and selected states re-
ported challenges in investigating and pros-
ecuting firearms denials. Officials from six 
selected ATF field divisions said that inves-
tigating the increasing number of denial 
cases referred to field divisions—which in-
creased from about 5,200 in fiscal year 2011 to 
about 12,700 in fiscal year 2017—has been 
time intensive and required use of their lim-
ited resources. ATF policy provides that 
field divisions may send ‘‘warning notices’’ 
to denied persons in lieu of prosecution, but 
ATF has not assessed field divisions’ use of 
these notices, which could provide greater 
awareness of their deterrence value and in-
form whether any policy changes are needed. 
Officials from the Executive Office for 
United States Attorneys said that pros-
ecuting denial cases can require significant 
effort and may offer little value to public 
safety compared to other cases involving gun 
violence. Selected state officials said that 
denial investigations can take law enforce-
ment officials away from their core duties. 
State prosecutors said gathering evidence to 
prove individuals knew they were prohibited 
was a challenge. 
Types of cases. ATF field divisions inves-
tigate denial cases based on USAO criteria 
and generally only refer cases to USAOs for 
prosecution when aggravating circumstances 
exist, such as violent felonies or multiple se-
rious offenses over a short period of time. Of-
ficials from two of three selected states refer 
all denial cases for investigation, while one 
state uses risk-based criteria for selecting 
cases that include conditions such as felony 
convictions and misdemeanor crimes of do-
mestic violence. Prosecutors from these 
three states said they generally pursue cases 
that involve indications of violence, though 
individual prosecutors had differing prior-
ities based on public safety concerns. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, well, that 
is an interesting speech to follow. Mr. 
MASSIE was very energized. I haven’t 
seen, of course, that which he sub-
mitted for the RECORD, but 90 percent 
of America thinks this bill makes 
sense, 90 percent. Take your own polls. 
Poll after poll after poll shows over-
whelming support of this legislation 
because it is common sense. It is com-
mon sense that you want to assure the 
community that those who buy weap-
ons that can be used with deadly force, 
as the gentleman just indicated, are 
not a danger to themselves or to oth-
ers. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the data-
base from the Associated Press, USA 
Today, and Northeastern University 
that tracks mass shootings, which they 
define as four or more victims, not in-
cluding the shooter, 2020 was a stand-
out year. After years of setting new 
records for mass shootings, 2019 had 
the highest number recorded, 33 mass 
shootings in one year. But in 2020, 
there were only two mass shootings: 
one in February and another in early 
March. 
Of course, Mr. Speaker, those num-
bers don’t count the hundreds of shoot-
ings each year in which there are fewer 
than four victims, with tens of thou-
sands killed or maimed by gun violence 
annually. The contrast in the number 
of mass shootings from 2019 to 2020 is 
stark. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t have to explain 
to my colleagues why mass shootings 
suddenly came to a halt last year, but 
it shouldn’t take a deadly viral pan-
demic—which took us out of group 
meetings, which took us off the streets, 
which kept us at home—to stop a dead-
ly epidemic of gun violence. 
With the arrival of vaccines and pas-
sage of President Biden’s plan to help 
make it safe to reopen businesses and 
schools, we will soon be gathering in 
groups once more, but nobody wants to 
see a return to mass shootings, Mr. 
Speaker. Nobody wants to see a return 
to deadly school shootings that ter-
rorize America’s students. 
We shouldn’t need a pandemic to re-
duce gun violence in this country. The 
way to do that ought to be through 
passing commonsense gun safety legis-
lation through Congress to make it 
harder for deadly firearms to get into 
the hands of those who cannot bear 
them responsibly. That is what H.R. 8,

the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, 
would do. 
Nine out of 10 Americans support the 
reforms in this bill. Now, I know I have 
seen some people, Mr. Speaker, shake 
their head, no, no, that is not the case. 
Show me a poll that has less than 80 
percent of Americans thinking that 
terrorists should not be able to buy 
guns, that felons should not be able to 
buy guns, that domestic abusers should 
not buy guns, particularly in an accel-
erated way. You get mad at a partner, 
you get mad at a girlfriend, a boy-
friend, whatever, go down to the store, 
boy, get a gun, bang. 
It is one thing to have a thoughtful 
purchase: I want to have a hunting 
gun; I want to have a handgun for tar-
get practice; I want a handgun for safe-
ty in my home, in my business, in my 
car. But if you are a person who has 
shown that you are not somebody who 
is a responsible person—sort of like 
driving a car, if you are not respon-
sible, you are a reckless driver and you 
have been guilty of manslaughter by 
automobile or something of that na-
ture—people have a right to know that 
what you do is going to be not a danger 
to them. 
This is one of the greatest examples 
of legislation that truly reflects the 
will of the American people. That is 
why I hope we can come together to 
pass it with bipartisan support. I don’t 
know that that is going to be the case. 
But if it is not the case, it will not re-
flect the will of the American people 
who would like to see this on a bipar-
tisan basis. Republicans and Democrats 
polled support this legislation. 
Now, if somebody wants to show me a 
poll that says, no, that is not the case, 
that is one thing, but I haven’t seen a 
poll that doesn’t reflect that. Just as I 
believe we ought to do this week with 
Representative CLYBURN’s bill as well, 
which could close the loophole that 
contributed to the reprehensible and 
racially motivated mass shooting at 
the Mother Emanuel AME Church in 
Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. 
Nine people in church slain by some-
body who got a gun; who, if the report 
had come back in a timely fashion, 
wouldn’t have been able to get that 
gun. 
I hope that Senate Republicans will 
not filibuster this bill. At some point 
in time the majority ought to rule. 
Now, the Second Amendment cor-
rectly protects gun ownership. I don’t 
have an argument with that. But the 
Supreme Court itself said that there 
could be responsible restraints and 
items for protection consistent with 
that amendment. That is what this bill 
does. 
I hope our friends will listen to the 
voices of parents, children, siblings, 
spouses, neighbors, and friends of those 
who were killed by gun violence in re-
cent years; and I hope they will re-
member the names that bring tears to 
many eyes and pain in so many hearts. 
Parkland. 
Some 
believe 
Parkland 
didn’t happen. They are wrong, of 
course. Sandy Hook; Charleston; Las 
Vegas; Orlando; Pittsburgh; Annapolis; 
San 
Bernardino; 
Washington 
Navy 
Yard, just a few blocks from here; Oak 
Creek; Tucson; Virginia Tech; and the 
list could go on and on and on. 
I say to the ladies and gentlemen of 
the House, let’s not add more names to 
this register of grief. Let’s not rely on 
a pandemic to do what we ought to 
have done so long ago. Let’s pass these 
bills and reduce gun violence the right 
way, with our votes. 
Is this a perfect bill? Will it establish 
or accomplish the absolute safety? 
It will not, but what 90 percent of 
Americans say is that it is a step in the 
right direction. 
Mr. Speaker, let us take that step. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, no, it 
doesn’t. The previous speaker said 
when this bill becomes law, it will stop 
some of the mass shootings—all of the 
mass shootings that happen in this 
country. No, it won’t. Nothing in this 
bill would prohibit, would have stopped 
any of those terrible things that took 
place. 
What this bill does is stop law-abid-
ing citizens from exercising their Sec-
ond Amendment liberties, just as the 
gentleman from Kentucky mentioned a 
few minutes ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
SPARTZ). 
b 1430 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 8. A major reason 
our Founding Fathers drafted the Sec-
ond Amendment is to have a check and 
balance for the people against the tyr-
anny of government. It is the Second 
Amendment for a reason, not the Ninth 
or the Tenth. You must have the Sec-
ond to protect the First. 
The first action by history’s dic-
tators—and we know all of them—was 
to take guns from law-abiding citizens. 
We must remember that there is no law 
that stops criminals from getting guns 
and committing crimes. We would have 
empty prisons otherwise. 
As someone who grew up under a ty-
rannical government, I value these 
rights tremendously, and I encourage 
my colleagues to be vigilant and pro-
tect these rights for all law-abiding 
citizens. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, every day 30 people are killed 
by someone using a gun. That number 
jumps to 100 if you factor in accidents 
and suicides involving guns. The steady 
stream of gun violence devastates fam-
ilies, communities, and schools. 
Gun violence costs our country $280 
billion every year. This status quo is 
not okay. 
Our constituents know it, and they 
support H.R. 8 overwhelmingly. 
The Special Order last night on H.R. 
8 was another low point for decorum in 
the House. To be generous, it was an 
embarrassing display and a complete 
misrepresentation of the facts. 
Viewers were told that the bill would 
create a Federal gun registry. Wrong. 
Read page 5, line 18. H.R. 8 prohibits 
any registry. 
They were told you can’t give a gun 
to a family member. Wrong. Read page 
3, line 7. You can. 
They were told that you can’t trans-
fer a gun if someone was suicidal or 
needed it for protection to address a 
self-defense situation. Wrong. Read 
page 3, line 21. You can. 
They were told that you can’t lend a 
gun to a friend to go hunting. Wrong. 
Read page 4, line 16. You can. 
What the bill does do is close the pri-
vate gun sale loophole, which has made 
it easy for felons and other prohibited 
purchasers to buy a gun online, at gun 
shows, or in person-to-person sales. 
We 
know 
universal 
background 
checks work. Every day they stop some 
160 felons and some 50 domestic abusers 
from buying a gun. Every day. 
But without universal background 
checks, these people can take their 
business elsewhere, to someone with-
out a Federal firearms license and buy 
the same gun. 
I have personally filled out the 4473 
form required to buy a gun from a li-
censed dealer. I have done it many 
times. It is something that every re-
sponsible gun owner should be able to 
live with. Heck, they should welcome it 
because it helps stop dangerous indi-
viduals from getting a gun. 
In 90 percent of the cases, back-
ground checks are completed within 
minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that these letters 
that I have from dozens of gun violence 
prevention groups, healthcare workers, 
law enforcement, and others be in-
cluded in the RECORD.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER

MCCARTHY: We write to you in support of 
H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act and H.R. 1446/S. 591 the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act. As gun owners, we 
understand that responsible gun ownership 
starts with background check. Loopholes in 
federal law have perpetuated the gun vio-
lence crisis in our country, including those 
in our background checks system. Congress 
must enact meaningful legislation to reduce 
gun violence. The Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act would close one such loophole by 
ensuring that a background check happens 
on every firearms sale. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal

purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must 
run a check through NICS to determine 
whether a potential buyer is prohibited from 
purchasing firearms. If information in NICS 
shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the 
dealer must deny the sale. 
However, no background check is required 
for sales at gun shows, through online mar-
ketplaces, or between private individuals. In-
dividuals who would otherwise be prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a gun can eas-
ily buy guns through such unregulated sales. 
And the frequency of these unregulated sales 
is growing: recent studies indicate that ap-
proximately 22 percent of firearms are pur-
chased without a background check, up to 
80% of firearms used in crimes are obtained 
without a background check. 
H.R. 8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act/Background Check Expansion 
Act would require a background check on 
every sale, ensuring that people prohibited 
from purchasing firearms cannot exploit 
loopholes and purchase guns through an un-
regulated sale at a gun show, online, or from 
an unlicensed private seller. In addition, in-
dividuals would no longer be able to cross 
state lines solely to purchase a firearm in a 
state with less stringent background checks. 
Closing these background check loopholes is 
critical to reducing gun violence throughout 
the United States. 
Additionally, H.R. 1446/S. 591 the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act/Background Check 
Completion Act would provide the FBI more 
time to complete background checks and en-
sure that people prohibited from possessing 
firearms are not able to obtain them by de-
fault because of an incomplete background 
check. This deadly loophole in existing law 
was exploited by a white supremacist who 
killed nine people at the Mother Emanuel 
AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
As responsible gun owners, we urge you to 
consider this legislation which would help 
keep our communities safe. Our support for 
universal background checks stems from our 
desire to protect the Second Amendment 
rights of law abiding citizens while main-
taining checks and balances to keep commu-
nities safe. 
We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act/Background 
Check Expansion Act and H.R. 1446/S. 591 the 
Enhanced 
Background

MCCARTHY: States United to Prevent Gun Vi-
olence is a group of 32 state affiliates across 
the United States that work on Gun Violence 
Prevention. We come from all areas of this 
country. Urban, rural, and, suburban. We be-
lieve that gun violence is a public health 
problem, and, that the legislation proposed 
will prevent many communities from suf-
fering the trauma of gun violence. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) has con-

We know that in many of our states we

and REPUBLICAN
LEADER
MCCARTHY: I’m 
writing on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs 
Association (MCCA), a professional organiza-
tion of police executives representing the 
largest cities in the United States and Can-
ada. The MCCA strongly supports H.R. 8/S.B. 
529, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act 
of 2021/Background Check Expansion Act. 
The Association has been a strong advocate 
for sensible gun policy for many years. Insti-
tuting universal background checks is a core 
tenant of the MCCA’s Firearms Violence Pol-
icy, which our membership approved in 2018. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) has con-
ducted firearm background checks on gun 
purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must 
run a check through NICS to determine 
whether a potential buyer is prohibited from

shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the 
dealer must deny the sale. However, there is 
a loophole in federal law, and no background 
check is required for sales at gun shows, 
through online marketplaces, or between pri-
vate individuals. Individuals who would oth-
erwise be prohibited from purchasing or pos-

such unregulated sales.

prohibited from purchasing firearms cannot 
exploit loopholes and purchase guns through 
an unregulated sale at a gun show, online, or 
from an unlicensed seller. In addition, indi-
viduals would no longer be able to cross 
state lines solely to purchase a firearm in a 
state with less stringent background checks. 
Closing these background check loopholes is 
critical to reducing gun violence throughout 
the United States. 
Many MCCA members are experiencing a 
significant uptick in gun violence in their 
cities. The MCCA’s most recent Violent 
Crime Survey, which showed a nationwide 
rise in both homicides and aggravated as-
saults in 2020, supports these reports. Ensur-
ing background checks for all gun sales and 
transfers will save lives by helping keep fire-
arms out of the hands of those who are not 
permitted to have them under the law. It 
will also be a critical step in combatting the 
epidemic of gun violence currently plaguing 
our country. 
Gun violence is more than just a public 
safety issue; it’s an officer safety issue as 
well. MCCA members, and law enforcement 
agencies all across the country, have had far 
too many officers killed or wounded in the 
line of duty by individuals who should have 
been prohibited from purchasing a firearm. 
We must enact policies at the national level 
to help ensure these brave men and women 
return home safely after their shifts. 
The MCCA urges Congress to pass H.R. 8/ 
S.B. 529, the Bipartisan Background Checks

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER 
MCCONNELL, SPEAKER PELOSI, AND LEADER 
MCCARTHY: We write to you in support of 
H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. As physicians, we believe that 
gun violence and its associated traumas are 
a public health crisis, and that Congress 
must enact meaningful legislation to help 
reduce gun violence in our communities. In 
2019, 39,707 people died from gun violence. 
Tragically, the pandemic and resulting eco-
nomic fallout may further exacerbate this 
public health crisis. Experts have suggested 
that the pandemic may drive increases in 
suicides, domestic violence, and community 
violence in the coming years. Several loop-
holes in federal law—and the background 
check system in particular—are not suffi-
cient to prevent individuals who are ineli-
gible to own a firearm from purchasing one. 
The Bipartisan Background Checks Act 
would enact universal background checks, 
closing these dangerous loopholes by ensur-
ing that a background check happens on 
every firearms sale. 
The American Medical Women’s Associa-
tion has been the voice and vision of women 
in medicine since 1915. Time and time again, 
AMWA, as an organization, stands to de-
crease the burden of gun related fatalities 
and violence. AMWA acknowledges gun vio-
lence for what it really is: a deadly epidemic 
resulting in substantial morbidity and mor-
tality for our patients. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) has con-
ducted firearm background checks on gun 
purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must 
run a check through NICS to determine 
whether a potential buyer is prohibited from 
purchasing firearms. If information in NICS 
shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the 
dealer must deny the sale. 
However, no background check is required 
for sales at gun shows, through online mar-
ketplaces, or between private individuals. In-
dividuals who would otherwise be prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a gun can eas-
ily buy guns through such unregulated sales. 
And the frequency of these unregulated sales 
is concerning: recent studies indicate that 
approximately 22 percent of firearms are pur-
chased without a background check, up to 
80% of firearms used in crimes are obtained 
without a background check. 
H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act/Background Check Expansion 
Act would require a background check on 
every sale, ensuring that people prohibited 
from purchasing firearms cannot exploit 
loopholes and purchase guns through an un-
regulated sale at a gun show, online, or from 
an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals 
would no longer be able to cross state lines 
solely to purchase a firearm in a state with 
less stringent background checks. 
Too often, our patients and our commu-
nities bear witness to the terrible tragedies 
that occur when people use guns to harm 
themselves or others. Gun violence is a com-
plex public health issue that will require a 
comprehensive solution; enacting universal 
background checks is an important first 
step. Our support for universal background 
checks comes from our desire to save lives 
and protect our patients. 
We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act/Background 
Check Expansion Act, as soon as possible. 
Sincerely, 
THERESA ROHR-KIRCHGRABER, MD, 
FACP, FAMWA, 
Chair, Advocacy Committee AMWA. 
MEMBERS OF THE 117TH CONGRESS: We, the 
undersigned organizations, strongly urge you 
to cosponsor and quickly pass H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Check Act, and S. 529, 
the Background Check Expansion Act, to ex-
pand Brady Background Checks to cover all 
firearm transactions, as well as H.R. 1446, 
the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 
2021, to close a dangerous gap in law that al-
lows thousands of prohibited individuals to 
purchase firearms every year. 
Since the Brady Law was enacted in 1994, 
more than 3.5 million prohibited firearm 
transactions have been prevented. In 2015 
alone, an average of 619 individuals per day 
were deemed by law to be too dangerous to 
possess a firearm and were blocked by the 
system. 
Background checks are conclusively effec-
tive and have saved countless lives. However, 
because only federally licensed firearms 
dealers are required to conduct these checks, 
an estimated one in five gun sales or trans-
fers—those conducted by private sellers, in-
cluding sales online and at gun shows—are 
completed without a background check. 
Without background checks it is almost im-
possible to keep guns out of the hands of pro-
hibited individuals or to hold illegal gun 
dealers accountable. 
H.R. 8 and S. 529 will make us all safer by 
requiring a background check for virtually 
every firearm sale and transfer. The bills in-
clude narrow, reasonable exceptions like 
transfers among close family members and 
short-term gun loans among hunters and 
sport shooters. The legislation does nothing 
to impede lawful gun purchases, while clos-
ing off a wide and well-known avenue for il-
legal transactions by prohibited, and often 
dangerous, buyers. It is past time to expand 
lifesaving background checks to every gun 
sale, and the public agrees: more than 90 per-
cent of Americans, including large majori-
ties of gun owners, support universal back-
ground checks. 
Likewise, it has been over five years since 
a prohibited person massacred nine parish-
ioners at the Emanuel AME Church in 
Charleston, South Carolina, with a gun pur-
chased at a licensed firearms dealer and it is 
far past time for Congress to take action to 
fix this gap in law. 
Under current law, a licensed dealer may 
transfer a gun to a buyer after three business 
days even if the background check has yet to 
determine whether that buyer is legally eli-
gible to purchase a gun, now known com-
monly as the ‘‘Charleston Loophole.’’ Ac-
cording to FBI data, thousands of guns are 
sold each year through this loophole to indi-
viduals who are prohibited from possessing 
firearms—over 43,000 since 2008. In the last 
decade an average of 10 prohibited individ-
uals have been able to purchase guns at li-
censed firearms dealers through the Charles-
ton Loophole every single day. 
H.R. 1446 will prevent the sale of firearms 
to prohibited individuals by providing the 
FBI with additional time to complete back-
ground checks—allowing the system to bet-
ter focus its resources and efforts, and pro-
vide accurate dispositions to federally li-
censed firearms dealers. This legislation will 
have a tremendous impact on public safety 
while ensuring that lawful gun owners are 
not subject to indefinite bureaucratic delay. 
We urge you to act quickly to pass these 
life-saving pieces of legislation.

advocated strongly for and continues to sup-
port common sense responses to America’s 
gun 
violence 
problem. 
Addressing 
and 
strengthening our system of background 
checks is long overdue and it is my belief 
that H.R. 8/S.B. 529 can address these issues 
and is worthy of full consideration. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) has con-
ducted firearm background checks on gun 
purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must 
run a check through NICS to determine 
whether a potential buyer is prohibited from 
purchasing firearms. If information in NICS 
shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the 
dealer must deny the sale. 
However, there is a loophole in federal law 
and no background check is required for 
sales at gun shows, through online market-
places, or between private individuals. Indi-
viduals who would otherwise be prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a gun can eas-
ily buy guns through such unregulated sales. 
And the frequency of these unregulated sales 
is concerning: recent studies indicate that 
approximately 22 percent of firearms are pur-
chased without a background check, and up 
to 80 of firearms used in crimes are obtained 
without a background check. 
H.R. 8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act/Background Check Expansion 
Act would require a background check on 
every sale, ensuring that people prohibited 
from purchasing firearms cannot exploit 
loopholes and purchase guns through an un-
regulated sale at a gun show, online, or from 
an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals 
would no longer be able to cross state lines 
solely to purchase a firearm in a state with 
less stringent background checks. Closing 
these background check loopholes is critical 
to reducing gun violence throughout the 
United States. 
The women and men serving on America’s 
front lines deserve the support that these 
bills will provide. Beyond data and research, 
common sense tells us that the solutions of-
fered in H.R. 8/S.B. 529 are needed and will 
make a difference. We urge you to pass H.R. 
8/S.B. 529 the Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act /Background Check Expansion Act, as 
soon as possible.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER 
MCCONNELL, SPEAKER PELOSI, AND LEADER 
MCCARTHY: March for Our Lives Colorado 
(MFOL CO) has been pushing for common- 
sense gun laws for our state since 2019. 
MFOL CO’s mission is to prevent gun vio-
lence in Colorado by engaging youth in the 
legislative process to further safety meas-
ures to protect ourselves and our fellow 
classmates. As such, we strongly endorse 
H.R. 8 for its potential to prevent gun-re-
lated violence. In 2013, Colorado passed 
House Bill 13–1229, resulting in the passage of 
universal background checks for firearm 
sales through unlicensed sellers in response 
to devastating events of gun violence in both 
Colorado and across the nation. According to 
the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, 2019 
alone resulted in the rejection of 2.11% of 
sales (3,477 firearm sales) through unlicensed 
sellers due to indicators on background 
checks that suggest the guns would poten-
tially be misused, showing that UBC laws 
have the empirical ability to keep guns from 
individuals who might misuse them. 
Since 1993, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) has con-
ducted firearm background checks on gun 
purchasers. Federally licensed dealers must 
run a check through NICS to determine 
whether a potential buyer is prohibited from 
purchasing firearms. If information in NICS 
shows that a person is indeed prohibited, the 
dealer must deny the sale. 
However, there is a loophole in federal law 
and no background check is required for 
sales at gun shows, through online market-
places, or between private individuals. Indi-
viduals who would otherwise be prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a gun can eas-
ily buy guns through such unregulated sales. 
And the frequency of these unregulated sales 
is concerning: recent studies indicate that 
approximately 22 percent of firearms are pur-
chased without a background check, and up 
to 80% of firearms used in crimes are ob-
tained without a background check. 
H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act/Background Check Expansion 
Act would require a background check on 
every sale, ensuring that people prohibited 
from purchasing firearms cannot exploit 
loopholes and purchase guns through an un-
regulated sale at a gun show, online, or from 
an unlicensed seller. In addition, individuals 
would no longer be able to cross state lines 
solely to purchase a firearm in a state with 
less stringent background checks. Closing 
these background check loopholes is critical 
to reducing gun violence throughout the 
United States. 
Additionally, H.R. 1446/S. 529 the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act/ Background Check 
Completion Act would provide the FBI more 
time to complete background checks and en-
sure that people prohibited from possessing 
firearms are not able to obtain them by de-
fault because of an incomplete background 
check. This deadly loophole in existing law 
was exploited by a white supremacist who 
killed nine people at the Mother Emanuel 
AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
H.R. 8 will save lives through increased 
background checks for unlicensed sales in 
the United States. Our organization’s first- 
hand experience with gun violence in our 
youths brings a grave brevity to our support 
of H.R. 8. March For Our Lives was forged to 
call for action against the violence that has 
plagued our nation. We call on you now to 
pass these bills to protect millions of student 
lives across the United States. 
We urge you to pass H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act/Background 
Check Expansion Act and H.R. 1446/S. 529 the 
Enhanced 
Background 
Checks

ground Check Completion Act, as soon as 
possible.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER 
MCCONNELL, SPEAKER PELOSI, AND LEADER 
MCCARTHY: On behalf of the American Psy-
chological Association (APA), I write to ex-
press our support of H.R. 8/S. 529 the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act of 2021. This 
important legislation would address our na-
tion’s gun violence public health crisis by 
closing pre-existing loopholes that allow for 
unlicensed gun sellers to avoid comprehen-
sive background checks on firearms sales. 
APA is the largest scientific and profes-
sional organization representing psychology 
in the United States with nearly 122,000 re-
searchers, educators, clinicians, consultants, 
and students. Our mission is to advance the 
creation, communication, and application of 
psychological knowledge to benefit society 
and improve people’s lives. APA advocates 
for a public health approach to gun violence 
prevention, supporting evidence-based pro-
grams and policies that can reduce the oc-
currence and impact of firearm-related vio-
lence in the United States. 
Research demonstrates almost 80% of all 
firearms acquired for criminal purposes are 
obtained through transfers from unlicensed 
sellers and 96% of persons incarcerated for 
gun offenses who were already prohibited 
from possessing a firearm at the time of the 
offense obtained their firearm from an unli-
censed seller. Moreover, states that only re-
quire background checks on sales through 
federally licensed firearms dealers showed 
higher rates of adolescents who carry guns 
than states that require universal back-
ground checks on all prospective gun buyers. 
Thank you for your work to prevent gun 
violence tragedies.

AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS,

Hon. MICHAEL THOMPSON, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REP. THOMPSON: On behalf of the 
American College of Physicians (ACP), I am 
writing to offer our strong support for the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 
(H.R. 8), legislation introduced in the 117th 
Congress to expand and enhance the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background Check 
System (NICS). We applaud your continued 
efforts to reduce firearms-related violence 
through common sense legislation. As an or-
ganization representing physicians who have 
first-hand experience with the devastating 
impact on the health of their patients result-
ing 
from 
firearms-related 
injuries 
and 
deaths, we have a responsibility to be part of 
the solution in trying to mitigate firearms- 
related tragedies. We stand ready to work 
with you to advance this important legisla-
tion. 
The American College of Physicians is the 
largest medical specialty organization and 
the second-largest physician membership so-
ciety in the United States. ACP members in-
clude 163,000 internal medicine physicians 
(internists), related subspecialists, and med-
ical students. Internal medicine physicians 
are specialists who apply scientific knowl-
edge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis, 
treatment, and compassionate care of adults 
across the spectrum from health to complex 
illness. 
We remain alarmed by the tragic toll of 
firearms violence in our neighborhoods, 
homes, 
workplaces, 
and 
public 
spaces. 
Deaths and injuries from firearms are not 
just a result of mass shootings, they are a 
daily occurrence; in 2019, 39,707 Americans 
lost their lives to firearms, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
This issue represents an urgent public health

crisis and now is the time to act, on a bipar-
tisan basis, on measures to improve the safe-
ty of all Americans. 
The Bipartisan Background Checks Act 
would strengthen the accuracy and reporting 
of the National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System (NICS) as well as expand 
Brady background checks to cover all fire-
arm sales, including unlicensed firearms sell-
ers currently not required to use background 
checks. Examples of gun sales not requiring 
background checks through NICS include 
those at gun shows, through the internet, 
and between private individuals or classified 
ads. With some exceptions, the legislation 
would expand background checks to cover all 
private and commercial firearm transfers 
and sales. In addition, because gun sellers 
would now be required to perform back-
ground checks for all sales and transfers, gun 
purchasers would no longer be able to cross 
state lines to buy firearms in a state with 
less rigorous background check laws. 
In conclusion, for more than 20 years, we 
ACP has urged the adoption of policies to re-
duce deaths and injuries related to firearms 
violence. A brief summary of ACP’s updated 
position paper on this issue can be found 
here. We remain committed to this endeavor 
and we call on Congress to pass H.R. 8 as a 
necessary first step in addressing the public 
health crisis created by firearms violence. 
Sincerely, 
JACQUELINE W. FINCHER, MD, MACP, 
President. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. On 
this bill we have coauthors who are 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 
cops, 
hunters, gun owners, district attor-
neys, a former FBI agent, and veterans, 
who have served in combat and put 
their lives on the line to protect our 
Second Amendment. 
There is bipartisan support for uni-
versal background checks in Congress 
and near universal support for back-
ground checks from the American peo-
ple. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 8. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Ohio for 
yielding. 
Look, bottom line is, we all know 
that by definition criminals don’t abide 
by the law. And that applies also when 
they are purchasing firearms. Nothing 
in this bill prohibits this type of indi-
vidual from obtaining firearms. 
In fact, the majority of individuals in 
prison for committing crimes with fire-
arms obtain their firearms through 
theft, the underground market, family 
members, and the like. 
But what this bill does is threaten 
everyday American citizens with up to 
a year in prison and a $100,000 fine for 
exercising their Second Amendment 
right in doing common practices. 
To say that this does not create a na-
tional gun registry, you cannot accom-
plish what is in this bill without a gun 
registry. 
The reality is universal background 
checks do not stop mass shootings. We 
do not have mass shootings because of 
lack of background checks. This bill 
will not make our communities safer. 
In fact, what it will do is cause law- 
abiding citizens to lose more of their 
Second Amendment rights. 
We shouldn’t be focused here in Con-
gress in taking those rights away. We 
actually should be strengthening the 
enforcement of laws we already have to 
make our communities safer. 
I stand with the Constitution and 
urge my colleagues to vote against 
H.R. 8. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is that 160 families every day buy guns. 
All this bill does is to say that people 
who obtain guns from unlicensed deal-
ers, as well as licensed dealers, must be 
subject to the background check, and 
that will save a heck of a lot of lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
You know, our friends on the other 
side of the aisle are deadly wrong. That 
is the tragedy of their argument, be-
cause the Second Amendment does not 
prohibit regulation. It never did. And 
our Founding Fathers regulated guns 
as early as the beginning of this Na-
tion. 
And so I rise in support of H.R. 8, and 
indicate while the COVID–19 pandemic 
dominated news headlines in 2020, the 
number of shootings surged in many 
communities across America. 
Our public health and emergency re-
sources have been straining to recover 
from the coronavirus, and budgets are 
crunched nationwide, and, as well, gun 
violence is rising. It is important to 
note because approximately 80 percent 
of firearms used for criminal purposes 
are obtained without a background 
check. 
We must strengthen our firearms 
background checks and close dangerous 
gaps, such as the online sale and gun 
show loopholes. 
In the data that we were able to se-
cure, there was nearly one mass shoot-
ing per day in the United States: 355 
mass shootings in 2018. We realize that 
since December 2012 there have been at 
least 1,518 mass shootings with at least 
1,715 people killed. 
Each day an average of 92 Americans 
are victims of gun violence, resulting 
in more than 33,000 deaths. And I won-
der why our friends could not feel the 
pain of the loss of guns being trans-
ferred illegally or improperly? 
I was here for Columbine. That hap-
pened on April 20, 1999. High school stu-
dents losing their lives. I was here 
when babies were killed in Newtown, 
Connecticut, on December 12, 2012. I 
was here in the United States Congress 
each moment we tried to pass sensible 
gun legislation like H.R. 8. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
THOMPSON for his leadership and Chair-
man NADLER. 
On February 14, 2018 I was here for 
Parkland and looked at these photo-
graphs. And as well I was here on May 
18 when in San Jose, Texas, people 
died. It is time to pass H.R. 8. Stop see-
ing our children die. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 
2021’’ and H.R. 1446, the ‘‘Enhanced Back-
ground Check Act of 2021,’’ which would 
make it illegal for any person who is not a li-
censed firearm importer, manufacturer, or 
dealer to transfer a firearm to any other per-
son who is not so licensed without a back-
ground check. 
A 2013 study found that approximately 80 
percent of all firearms acquired for criminal 
purposes were obtained from sources who 
were not required to run a background check, 
and that 96 percent of inmates who were not 
prohibited from possessing a firearm at the 
time they committed their crime obtained their 
gun this way. 
This loophole exists largely because unli-
censed sellers need not conduct any back-
ground check under current law, even if the 
seller sells a large number of guns. 
Under H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act of 2021,’’ individuals seeking to 
transfer a firearm under this measure would 
be required to visit a licensed firearms dealer 
to run the necessary background check before 
the transfer could be finalized. 
H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate 
and speedy manner to ensure firearms do not 
end up in the wrong hands. 
An internal assessment by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation (FBI) demonstrated that 
NICS background checks are approximately 
99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 
90 percent of cases, are processed within 90 
seconds. 
I am particularly pleased that the rule re-
ported by Rules Committee makes in order 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 to H.R. 8, 
which makes clear that a gun owner who real-
izes that he or she is at risk of suicide may 
transfer the gun to someone else, if the risk is 
imminent, without a background check to pre-
vent self-harm. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment will help en-
sure that no person who is experiencing a sui-
cidal crisis will feel compelled to retain their 
gun when it would be better for them to tem-
porarily transfer it to someone else. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people are de-
manding effective action to reduce, if not pre-
vent altogether, the countless mass shootings 
and gun violence in our country that continue 
to claim so many innocent lives. 
Newly released data from the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention found 
firearm-related deaths rose for the second- 
straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in 
gun violence. 
In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary 
mortality data shows that there were more 
than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.— 
4,000 more than 2015. 
An Associated Press analysis of FBI data 
shows there were about 11,000 gun-related 
homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015. 
Congress must act to keep our country safe 
through gun safety and violence deterrence. 
There is nearly one mass shooting per day 
in the United States—355 mass shootings in 
2018. 
In December 2012, a gunman walked into 
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, 
Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, 
and himself. 
Since December 2012, there have been at 
least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 
1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1294 
March 10, 2021 
On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman 
opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers 
at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the 
Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 
527 injured. 
And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting 
occurred at the First Baptist Church in Suther-
land Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26- 
year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and in-
jured 20 others. 
Every day, on average, 92 Americans are 
victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 
33,000 deaths annually. 
States with higher gun ownership rates have 
higher gun murder rates—as much as 114 
percent higher than other States. 
A recent study by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, looking at 30 years of 
homicide data, found that for every 1 percent 
increase in a State’s gun ownership rate, there 
is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm 
homicide rate. 
Gun death rates are generally lower in 
States with restrictions such as safe storage 
requirements or assault weapons bans. 
Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians 
in the past 33 years: 0. 
Because more than 75 percent of the weap-
ons used in mass shootings between 1982 
and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger leg-
islation is needed to prevent guns from getting 
into the wrong hands. 
Mr. Speaker, enhancing the gun transfer 
background check system has consistently 
garnered broad public support, as high as 92 
percent, because the American people know 
that the status quo is simply intolerable and 
action must be taken to reduce gun violence 
by keeping dangerous persons from obtaining 
deadly weapons. 
That begins with passing H.R. 8, the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act of 2021,’’ and 
H.R. 1446, the ‘‘Enhanced Background Check 
Act of 2021,’’ and I urge all members to join 
me in voting for its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 
2021,’’ and urge its quick adoption. 
While the COVID–19 pandemic dominated 
news headlines in 2020, the number of shoot-
ings surged in many communities across 
America. 
Our public health and emergency resources 
have been straining to respond to the 
coronavirus 
crisis. 
Budgets 
are 
being 
crunched nationwide. Across the country, cit-
ies and states are struggling to find the re-
sources to simultaneously address the pan-
demic and rising rates of gun violence. 
We must take the steps that we know will 
make us safer. 
Because approximately 80 percent of fire-
arms used for criminal purposes are obtained 
without 
a 
background 
check, 
we 
must 
strengthen our firearms background check 
system and close dangerous gaps, such as 
the online sale and gun show loopholes. 
Reducing gun violence starts with making 
sure that individuals who may not lawfully pos-
sess guns do not get their hands on them. 
Our citizens overwhelmingly support this 
measure, and it is critical we pass it today and 
enact it into law. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. OWENS). 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 8 and H.R. 
1446. 
In this last week I received over 1,000 
emails from constituents in strong op-
position to these antigun bills. Here is 
a sample: 
‘‘H.R. 8 will make it impossible to 
sell or loan guns to my relatives and 
trusted friends.’’ 
‘‘These bills appear designed to im-
pose restrictions on natural rights 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.’’ 
And finally, ‘‘Stand for our rights 
and oppose these measures with every 
tool in your grasp.’’ 
I absolutely will fight these measures 
with every tool in my grasp. These 
rights protect my life, liberty, and 
property granted to me by God and 
cannot be taken away from me by D.C. 
bureaucrats. 
I grew up in the Deep South at a time 
when Black Americans were unable to 
defend themselves. After the Civil War, 
Black Codes and Jim Crow laws prohib-
ited people of color from owning fire-
arms. 
In the mid-1950s, Martin Luther King, 
Jr., kept firearms for self-protection, 
but his application for a concealed 
weapon permit was denied because of 
racist gun control laws in his State. 
As a child, my dad witnessed an al-
tercation between his father and a 
southern White man who thought my 
grandfather was being disrespectful 
and threatened to teach him a lesson. 
Later that night he drove up to my 
grandfather’s home with a bunch of his 
friends standing on the forerunner of a 
Model T Ford. 
My grandfather was prepared. He and 
his brothers had hidden around his 
front porch. As these bullies and cow-
ards approached the house, they heard 
the click of rifles and left just as fast 
as they came. 
Without ever firing his gun on an-
other human being, my grandfather’s 
right to own a firearm ensured his 
rights to protect his life, liberty, and 
property. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
these anti-Second Amendment bills. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. SWALWELL). 
Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. THOMPSON for this legisla-
tion because it takes the most dan-
gerous weapons out of the hands of the 
most dangerous people. 
I have heard from my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle about rights. 
Let’s talk about some other rights in 
this country, like the right to pray in 
church, the right to dance at a party, 
the right to come home from a concert, 
the right to come back home safely and 
alive. Those are rights that matter, 
too. 
And I am for this because I think 
about a mother who told me a couple 
years ago to keep fighting on this issue 
because every day when she puts her 
children in the car and sends them off 
to school, before they get out the car, 
she closes her eyes to remember what 
they were wearing because she was 
afraid that one day she may have to 
identify them. 
This bill says we don’t have to live 
that way anymore. The right to come 
home alive is greater than any right 
that is being put forward by the other 
side. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we 
have been told that 90 percent of Amer-
icans support this bill. Well, that is be-
cause 99.99 percent of Americans have 
not read this bill. 
And we are told, yet again, that this 
will save lives. And, yet, there is not 
one single mass killing that has been 
brought up here today that would have 
been prevented by this bill. 
And yet over and over we have people 
come in here, usually they mean well; 
look, this will protect people when the 
fact is that they can’t point to any of 
these mass killings they talk about 
that would have been prevented. 
So let’s talk about lives that would 
be saved. Think about the people that 
are shot every day and would their sit-
uation be different if they were not 
finding it so difficult to legally get a 
gun? 
I mean, we had thousands of felony 
cases that came through my court, and 
we tried a lot of those cases. Over and 
over you hear, the criminals are not 
obeying the law. They are not going to 
follow the law. They got their guns il-
legally. And this will not change at all 
any of those people we tried and con-
victed for getting guns. They steal 
them. They buy them from other peo-
ple that stole them. They don’t obey 
the law. That is why they are crimi-
nals. So quit penalizing the American 
people. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans are 25 more times more likely to 
die from gun violence than people who 
live in other developed countries, and 
on that point our perpetually outraged 
and indignant colleagues have abso-
lutely nothing to say. 
We lose 38,000 people a year, more 
than 100 people a day. From Newtown, 
Connecticut, to El Paso, Texas, gun vi-
olence is ripping the heart out of our 
social contract, making life for more 
Americans nasty, poor, solitary, brut-
ish; in short, a Hobbesian state of war. 
H.R. 8 will close three gaping loop-
holes in the law; the gun shows loop-
hole, the internet loophole, and the pri-
vate sale loophole, cutting down pre-
cisely on the traffic in illegal guns, 
which our colleagues cite as the source 
of criminal gun violence. 
In opposing the American Rescue 
Plan, they voted against science. In op-
posing H.R. 1, they voted against de-
mocracy. And now in opposing H.R. 8, 
they are voting against public safety 
and the social contract itself. What a 
moral collapse for a once-great party.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1295 
March 10, 2021 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks, the 
majority 
has 
attacked 
the 
First 
Amendment, and now they are attack-
ing the Second Amendment. 
H.R. 8 will not save lives. As Justice 
Scalia noted in his decision in Heller, 
the Second Amendment does not give 
Americans a right; it protects a pre-
existing right, and that right shall not 
be infringed. 
H.R. 8 would not have prevented re-
cent shootings. In Parkland, the shoot-
er acquired the firearm legally from an 
FFL after undergoing a NICS check. 
The same thing in Sutherland Springs, 
Texas; the same in Las Vegas, Nevada; 
and the same in Orlando. I could go on 
because the list would produce the 
same result. They got their guns after 
a background check, including in El 
Paso. 
Criminals who seek to do harm get 
guns regardless of the new restrictions 
imposed by H.R. 8. And with very lim-
ited exceptions, H.R. 8 makes it illegal 
for Americans to get a gun if a non-
licensed importer, manufacturer, or 
dealer is not involved. How will the 
government know if an illegal transfer 
occurs? Without a registry, this bill is 
unenforceable. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard supporters 
of this bill say that other countries 
have similar restrictions so we should, 
too. I counter with the fact that other 
countries do not have the Second 
Amendment. The Second Amendment 
was included to ensure that the United 
States would be different than other 
countries. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act. This bill is 
among the most commonsense gun vio-
lence prevention reforms, requiring 
background checks for unlicensed sell-
ers. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not complicated. 
This is simple. Under H.R. 8, people 
who wish to transfer a firearm would 
have to visit a licensed firearm dealer 
to run a background check before the 
transfer could be finalized. 
Most of these checks take 90 seconds, 
90 seconds to prevent firearms from 
ending up in the wrong hands, 90 sec-
onds to prevent more of our loved ones 
from being killed by gun violence. 
I am proud to be from Washington 
State, where voters have consistently 
tackled gun violence with common-
sense reforms, passing one of the first, 
most comprehensive background check 
laws in 2014 and raising the legal age to 
purchase a semiautomatic rifle to 21 in 
2018. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s do this. To save 
lives, vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 
8 is brought to us by the same organi-
zations and politicians who have made 
no secret of their intention ultimately 
to strip law-abiding citizens of their 
right to defend themselves. Now, they 
know they can’t do it outright, so they 
do it through cynical measures like 
this, which weave a web of laws so in-
tricate that, sooner or later, everyone 
can be caught up in them. 
This law affects not only sales but 
any transfer of a weapon for any period 
of time. A couple of years ago, a 10- 
year study by Johns Hopkins and UC 
Davis concluded that California’s back-
ground check law had no effect on gun 
homicides or suicides. None. 
The purpose of this bill is not public 
safety. That is its deceptive facade. Its 
purpose is to make gun ownership so 
legally hazardous, so fraught with legal 
boobytraps and draconian penalties, 
that no honest and law-abiding citizen 
would ever want to take the risk. 
Most criminals already get their 
guns illegally. They are unconstrained 
by laws like this. This bill is aimed 
squarely at law-abiding citizens, mov-
ing us closer to a society where decent 
people are defenseless and armed crimi-
nals are kings. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, 2 years 
ago, I came to Congress, and one of my 
first actions as a Member was cospon-
soring this bipartisan legislation that 
will save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the pain of gun 
violence firsthand. Eight years ago, I 
lost my son, Jordan, a victim of a gun 
in the wrong hands. 
With this legislation, we empower 
law enforcement to keep guns from 
those who might do harm by simply re-
quiring a background check whenever a 
gun is sold. This is commonsense legis-
lation that will prevent more families 
from knowing the pain of losing a loved 
one to gun violence. 
Just like 2 years ago, our vote today 
is a beginning, and it is definitely not 
the end. In again passing this common-
sense bipartisan legislation, we call on 
our colleagues in the Senate to do what 
is right to keep America’s families 
safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud once again 
to stand in support of this legislation 
as a survivor of gun violence myself. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress refusing to 
pass this vital legislation would be 
America’s shame and burden for gen-
erations to come. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Col-
orado (Mrs. BOEBERT), the co-chair of 
the Second Amendment Caucus. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, JIM JORDAN, for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was raised in a Demo-
crat home, so I understand how these 
policies are deceiving. I understand 
that we are told guns are scary. That is 
what we were told, and that is what we 
believed, because we trusted the people 
who we voted for. But just as with 
most things in life, I grew up and 
learned that there is a better way to 
live. I was ignorant to firearms and the 
proper use of them. 
Mr. Speaker, when I became a busi-
ness owner, I needed to protect myself. 
There was an altercation outside of my 
restaurant, where a man was phys-
ically beat to death. There were no 
weapons involved. He was beaten to 
death by another man’s hands. 
I have a lot of young girls who work 
in my restaurant, and we needed an 
equalizer. I am 5 feet tall. I weigh bare-
ly 100 pounds. I need something against 
a stronger potential aggressor to de-
fend myself with. 
Talk about women’s rights. Don’t 
take my right away to protect myself. 
I mean, seriously, what are we doing 
here? I ask the supporters of this legis-
lation, who do you think you are to 
disarm Americans and leave them vul-
nerable without help? 
You want to defund our police and 
yet leave us without a way to protect 
ourselves. 
Our Founding Fathers gave us a list 
of items. They said don’t touch these 
things. And I am telling you, keep your 
hands off of our Second Amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). Members are reminded 
to address their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am assuming our col-
league on the other side of the aisle 
can pass a background check, so she 
will have no inability to have a gun. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act, because even as we manage a 
deadly pandemic, gun violence con-
tinues to plague our Nation. 
Every year, more than 130,000 people 
in this Nation are victims of gun vio-
lence. Some 38,000 dead, another 100,000 
caught in the crossfire. In my home re-
gion in Philadelphia, 2,244 people were 
victims of gun violence in the year 
2020. 
Mr. Speaker, death by guns doesn’t 
mean only murders. Sadly, it also 
means death by suicide using a fire-
arm, which was the case in 62 percent 
of Pennsylvania’s gun deaths last year. 
This is a public health crisis. 
The Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act requires a background check for all 
gun sales, no loopholes, no backdoors, 
a commonsense solution supported by a 
majority of Americans, including 89 
percent of Republicans and 87 percent 
of gun owners. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s find the courage to 
address the crisis. Let’s save lives. 
Let’s pass the bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
vious speaker talked about the in-
crease in violent crime in her neighbor-
hood last year. Maybe if Democrats ac-
tively supported our police and not

supported defund the police, maybe 
that wouldn’t be the case. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, Mr. JORDAN, for yield-
ing. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this bill. 
H.R. 8 is an assault on our Second 
Amendment right to keep and bear 
arms. The bill turns law-abiding citi-
zens into criminals by subjecting them 
to criminal penalties for simply lend-
ing a friend or a neighbor a gun on a 
temporary basis. 
Additionally, the bill would inevi-
tably lead to a national gun registry 
because, without a registry, the gov-
ernment has no way to implement this 
legislation. This bill is certainly a slip-
pery slope. 
Most alarmingly, this bill does noth-
ing, absolutely nothing, to stop crimi-
nals from obtaining firearms. Accord-
ing to the Department of Justice, less 
than 1 percent of criminals in prison 
who possessed a firearm during their 
offense obtained the firearm from a li-
censed 
dealer, 
meaning 
criminals 
would still have access to firearms 
under this law. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is just the first 
of many steps to take away our Second 
Amendment rights. I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 
more than 100,000 Americans who every 
year are impacted by gun violence, and 
I rise today to give voice to the over-
whelming majority of the American 
people who support universal back-
ground checks. 
Communities in Colorado have expe-
rienced the tragedy and the grief of 
gun violence far too many times—Col-
umbine, Aurora, Highlands Ranch. 
Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We 
have lost too many parents, friends, 
neighbors, students, and children to 
gun violence. 
This Congress must act, which is why 
I support H.R. 8. We must act on gun 
violence. We must pass H.R. 8, and we 
must send it to President Biden’s desk. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, enough is 
enough, which is why I rise in strong 
opposition to H.R. 8 and to offer a mo-
tion to recommit the bill. 
This bill is nothing more than a co-
ordinated effort by the authoritarian 
left to strip away the constitutional 
rights guaranteed to Americans by the 
Second Amendment. 
Instead of criminalizing the innocent 
actions of law-abiding gun owners, 
American citizens, we should be fo-
cused on stopping real crime in our 
local communities and enforcing the 
laws that are already on the books. 
One way we can do that is by ensur-
ing that ICE is notified when unlawful 
aliens attempt to purchase a firearm 
illegally. The FBI reported just last 
month that NICS had over 10 million 
people listed as an illegal alien. In fact, 
this ranks as the number one prohib-
ited category in the FBI’s NICS Indi-
ces. 
Since 1998, over 28,000 illegal aliens 
have been denied a firearm after failing 
a NICS check. With over 2,700 in 2019 
alone, this means over 28,000 criminals 
have been allowed to stay in the United 
States when ICE should have been 
alerted about their criminal act but 
were not. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8 fails to do any-
thing to prevent crime, which is why I 
am offering this motion to recommit, 
so our Nation’s laws are enforced. And 
if you will recall, this MTR passed in 
2019 with a strong bipartisan majority. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to consider my 
amendment to H.R. 8 to ensure that 
the FBI alerts ICE anytime an illegal 
alien is denied a firearm because of 
NICS. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Ms. 
CLARK). 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, in 2016, after the tragic Pulse 
nightclub shooting, I, with my col-
leagues, sat in protest on this very 
floor with our friend, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis. On that day, 
Congressman Lewis told us: ‘‘We have 
turned deaf ears to the blood of the in-
nocent and the concern of our Nation. 
We are blind to a crisis.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 5 years later, we 
have endured thousands of mass shoot-
ings. We have mourned the loss of 100 
people every single day to suicide and 
homicide with guns. 
Today’s vote will improve the safety 
of our schools, our communities, and 
our streets. It is a vote for kids, par-
ents, veterans, and our neighbors. I 
stand here today thinking of the many 
survivors and families who have been 
waiting for this moment, and I think of 
my friend, John, who told us to always 
speak out for the voiceless and act 
boldly for justice. 
Today, with this bill, we will do just 
that. 
b 1500 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
stand against H.R. 8. 
This bill would make it a crime to 
transfer a firearm from one individual 
to another without a Federal firearms 
licensee overseeing the transfer and 
conducting a background check on the 
prospective buyer. While there are lim-
ited exceptions to this bill, in this bill 
it does nothing to address how violent 
criminals actually obtain firearms, nor 
does the bill make it harder for them 
to obtain a firearm. That is because 
criminals don’t follow the law. That is 
why they are called criminals. 
So by making these types of changes 
to the law, the bill does nothing to pro-
hibit guns from ending up in the hands 
of criminals. Instead, it does every-
thing possible to make it harder for 
law-abiding citizens to exercise their 
Second Amendment rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 8. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, there is 
a rampaging public health emergency 
that has been with us for far too long. 
And there have been countless chilling 
examples of what happens when we fail 
to act, or only take half measures, ano-
dyne placebos. Each time, more lives 
are lost. 
Moreover, we have seen a particular 
community unjustly suffer scorn for 
this 
emergency. 
They 
have 
been 
scapegoated rather than recognized as 
the fellow victims of this crisis. But 
there is no question that the harms of 
this crisis haven’t fallen evenly, and 
the disparate harm offers all the more 
reason for actual solutions, not mere 
talk. By now, my colleagues know that 
I am not talking about COVID. I am re-
ferring to gun violence. 
Today, 
the 
most 
commonsense, 
broadly popular, and impactful thing 
that we can do is pass H.R. 8, and bol-
ster our pitifully weak background 
check system in the United States. 
Keeping deadly weapons out of the 
hands of those fueled by hate is as com-
mon sense as it gets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for H.R. 8. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, right now in south 
Texas there are American citizens 
whose lives are in danger because of 
wide open borders as a direct result of 
Biden’s border crisis and the policies of 
the Democratic leadership of this body 
and the Senate. American citizens are 
unsafe. I am not making that up. 
For the last 2 years, I have heard my 
Democratic colleagues talking about a 
fake crisis at our border. There is noth-
ing fake about 100,000 people coming 
across our border; or high-speed chases 
through Uvalde, Texas; or high-speed 
chases in Real County, which I rep-
resent. There is nothing fake about 
break-ins putting lives in danger. 
People own ranches, and now my 
Democratic colleagues, after defunding 
the police and opening up our borders,

want to take away our God-given 
right—yes, God-given right—to defend 
ourselves under the Second Amend-
ment. That is what this is about. This 
is about creating a gun registry to 
track guns of the American people. 
There is no way to implement what the 
Democrats are trying to implement 
without doing that. 
I can just tell you straight up, Tex-
ans, Americans, the Government is 
never going to know what weapons I 
own. Let me be clear about that. It is 
not going to happen. We have a God- 
given right to defend our families, de-
fend our State, and defend ourselves 
against tyranny; and we will do that 
regardless of the errant policies that 
this Democratic Congress is trying to 
jam through. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
soon we will take a bipartisan vote on 
the Background Checks Act, a bill 
which could save lives in every district 
of our Nation. Expanding background 
checks will help prevent guns from get-
ting into the hands of those who may 
be a danger to themselves or others. 
This is a simple commonsense solution 
to a worsening problem in our Nation. 
Even in 2020, when many people were 
at home during the raging COVID–19 
pandemic, we lost more than 41,000 peo-
ple to gun violence. That number in-
cludes nearly 300 children under the 
age of 11. My heart breaks for their 
parents. But heartbreak will do little 
to comfort those mourning families, 
and we know well enough by now it 
will do nothing to prevent any future 
tragedies. 
It is time for us to step up to say 
enough is enough. It is time for our 
families to be able to play in the park, 
drive a car on the expressway, or on a 
bus, or other things we take for grant-
ed without fear of gun violence. We 
need to pass legislation that will save 
precious lives. 
I ask: How many funerals have you 
attended? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of H.R. 8, expand back-
ground checks, and make our Nation 
safer. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8 as well as H.R. 1446. 
There is not a single Member in this 
Chamber who does not mourn the inno-
cent lives lost to gun violence, but I 
solemnly believe that my Democratic 
colleagues lack a fundamental under-
standing of this issue. 
I have worked as a surgeon who has 
done pelvic trauma for close to 30 
years. In fact, I will submit that I am 
the only Member of this Chamber who 
has ever operated on a gunshot victim. 
The infinite majority of gunshot vic-
tims are shot by criminals who have 
obtained their guns illegally. They did 
not apply for permits. They are not a 
member of the NRA. They are crimi-
nals. These bills would do nothing to 
keep the guns out of their hands. 
In all my years as a surgeon, I have 
yet to see a gun jump up by itself and 
injure someone. It is either from a 
crime, a mental illness, or tragically 
from an accident. Where I live in east-
ern North Carolina, it is certainly dif-
ferent from New York City, the gun 
haven of Chicago, or Oakland, but we 
still have our share of drug-related and 
gang-related crime. 
On the other hand, we have a lot of 
wilderness that people back home, 
adults and children, still enjoy hunt-
ing. These law-abiding citizens should 
not have their rights trampled upon. 
We are all saddened by the loss of life 
from mass shootings, but, Mr. Speaker, 
the issue is not the gun itself, but the 
mental illness borne by the gun holder. 
A mentally stable person does not 
shoot innocent people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MURPHY) an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 absurdly 
hamper people’s ability to exercise 
their constitutional right to defend 
themselves. This sort of broad govern-
ment overreach does not save lives, but 
treats everyday law-abiding citizens 
like criminals. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on these bills. We should not 
support bills that place the rights of 
violent criminals above those law-abid-
ing American citizens. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 111⁄2 min-
utes remaining, and the gentleman 
from Ohio has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of 
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. 
This legislation has one simple goal: 
keep guns out of the hands of people 
who are dangerous. 
More than 90 percent of the American 
people support universal background 
checks on every firearm sale or trans-
fer, and that is what this bill does. 
Our constituents expect us to find 
common ground to finally end the gun 
violence epidemic in this country. 
They expect us to pass this bipartisan 
bill. The era of offering only thoughts 
and prayers is over. It is over. The 
American people demand action. H.R. 8 
is the action they are calling for. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand with the American people and 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ Let’s get this done. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the fundamental truth 
is that the Second Amendment guaran-
tees the right of law-abiding citizens to 
keep and bear arms to protect them-
selves and their loved ones. 
America’s Founders spoke on this 
issue extensively. Benjamin Franklin 
warned that those who would give up 
essential liberty to purchase a little 
temporary safety deserve neither lib-
erty nor safety. Benjamin Franklin 
was right. The American tradition of 
self-reliance, self-determination, and 
self-defense has been fierce. It has been 
what makes this country so excep-
tional and so great. 
Today, the House will vote on legisla-
tion that would undermine that very 
right. What is worse is that both of 
these bills would not have prevented 
mass shootings or tragedies across this 
Nation. Those are awful events. We all 
agree that those events are awful. But 
in those cases, the criminal either 
passed a background check or they 
stole their weapons. 
We cannot sacrifice our rights by 
passing laws that will make our fami-
lies less safe and laws that criminals 
will simply ignore. We must always 
protect and preserve our God-given 
Second Amendment right. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I will remind my friend 
on the other side of the aisle, the God- 
given right every one of us has, accord-
ing to the Declaration of Independence, 
is life, and that is what we are arguing 
about here today. 
Are we going to take protective 
measures that save lives? 
This bill does that. I talk about the 
ABCs of gun control. A, reinstate the 
Assault Weapons Ban; B, universal 
background checks; and C, closing the 
gun show loophole. 
Those three practical measures will 
save lives. And because I support ABC, 
I get an F every year from the NRA, 
and I am proud of that grade every 
year. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, point of 
order. I would request that the col-
league from Virginia direct his re-
marks to you and not to other col-
leagues. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds all Members to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, it is no 
secret that I have been a committed 
defender of the Second Amendment 
since being elected to Congress back in 
1994. For me, that means that I will do 
everything that I possibly can to en-
sure that the rights of Americans, as 
they relate to the Second Amendment, 
are protected, while at the same time

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1298 
March 10, 2021 
working to keep firearms out of the 
hands of criminals and mentally unsta-
ble individuals. 
H.R. 8, unfortunately, doesn’t accom-
plish either of those goals. It is over-
burdensome, 
unreasonable, 
and, 
if 
passed, would instead keep firearms 
out of the hands of some hardworking 
and law-abiding citizens. 
Yesterday, at the Rules Committee, I 
offered an amendment which would 
allow for the transfer of a firearm to 
museums or historical displays without 
going through the burdensome require-
ments of this measure, but that emi-
nently reasonable amendment and oth-
ers offered by my colleagues were flat-
ly rejected by the majority. 
During this afternoon’s debate, we 
have again expressed several concerns 
which will not be addressed or consid-
ered by the majority. Instead of focus-
ing on improving the National Instant 
Criminal Background Checks System, 
or NICS, providing resources to assist 
those with mental illnesses or hard-
ening soft targets like schools and 
places of worship, the majority will 
pass this legislation and attempt to 
further infringe on the Second Amend-
ment rights of our constituents. That 
is very, very unfortunate. 
Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I 
stand in opposition to this deeply 
flawed legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise as both a mom 
and a Member of Congress in strong 
support of H.R. 8. 
Last month, my community marked 
the 3-year anniversary of the Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas shooting that stole 
17 innocent lives. 
The anxiety and terror that came 
that day has never left us. Yet, too 
many communities witness horrific 
gun violence every day. Commonsense 
reform can end this agony and keep us 
safer mainly by requiring background 
checks for gun sales. Yet, loopholes 
allow up to 80 percent of firearms to be 
sold without background checks. 
b 1515 
We must mandate universal back-
ground checks for firearm sales by 
passing H.R. 8 and then pass Jaime’s 
Law, my legislation that expands that 
same mandate to ammunition pur-
chases. 
The pandemic made gun proliferation 
worse, and inaction is not an option. 
We must do all we can to ensure guns 
and bullets don’t end up in the wrong 
hands. 
Mr. Speaker, the outliers on this 
issue are Republicans whose fealty to 
the NRA results in more people dying 
from gun violence. Enough is enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. I reserve the balance of 
my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this 
morning I walked by an elementary 
school, and I saw parents dropping off 
their kids. I thought of parents around 
the country sending their kids back to 
school after months of virtual learning. 
They want their children to be safe. 
But it has been 8 years after Sandy 
Hook and 3 years after the shooting at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School in my district, we should be 
ashamed that we have waited so long 
and wasted so much time when we 
could be saving lives. 
We cannot have safe communities 
until we fix the crumbling foundation 
of our gun laws. That is the back-
ground check system. Universal back-
ground checks will help keep guns out 
of dangerous hands. They will save 
lives in our schools, they will save lives 
in our homes, and they will save lives 
on our streets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand with survivors, with gun owners, 
and with Americans of both Demo-
cratic and Republican Parties who sup-
port universal background checks by 
voting to pass H.R. 8. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
simply requires that the background 
check for a purchase that occurs with-
in a gun shop applies outside a gun 
shop. That doesn’t take away anyone’s 
right, but it does protect us from con-
victed criminals, fugitives, and family 
abusers who are prevented from evad-
ing the law to buy a weapon of war on-
line or at a gun show. Texas Gun Sense 
knows the gap in safety makes no 
sense. 
Unfortunately, NRA has come to 
stand for ‘‘No Republican Action.’’ 
They offer us only moments of silence 
for mass murder, but they always come 
up short with one very important type 
of ammunition—courage. Students in 
March for Our Lives have that courage. 
Moms Demand Action are steadfast in 
demanding meaningful action. 
As these gun lobbies continue to op-
pose reasonable action, we must speak 
up for gun safety. We must listen to 
the victims of violence before their 
number is increased by another El Paso 
shooting, another school shooting, or 
another concert interrupted by gunfire. 
We must act now to save lives. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
brief point to make. I wonder how my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
hold two thoughts in contradiction si-
multaneously in their minds. They say 
that photo IDs and excessive registra-
tion paperwork and whatnot disenfran-
chises 
disproportionately 
minorities 
and the poor when they go to exercise 
their right to vote. But today with 
H.R. 8 and the next bill that is coming 
up, they are doing exactly that. They 
are causing there to be increased fees, 
increased paperwork, and more photo 
IDs. 
How does that not disenfranchise not 
just all Americans but disproportion-
ately minorities and the poor? 
Mr. Speaker, I leave that to my col-
leagues to answer today. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
had the privilege of working in public 
education for 20 years. I started my ca-
reer in 1999. That was the same year of 
the Columbine High School shooting. 
Throughout my career, unfortunately, 
we have had to continually deal with 
school shootings. 
In our schools we have to prepare 
children as young as 4 years old for the 
possibility of a school shooting. We 
have Columbine, we have Parkland, we 
have Virginia Tech, and we have Sandy 
Hook. 
I thought 9 years ago when Sandy 
Hood occurred that the country would 
stop, pause, and reflect on what is hap-
pening in our Nation. It was a mass 
shooting of our 6-year-old children— 
our babies. This law will begin the 
process of protecting our most vulner-
able and protecting our babies. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honor for me to be here today 
with my colleagues, Mr. THOMPSON and 
Mrs. MCBATH. 
Mr. Speaker, Lucy’s courage is an in-
spiration to me. 
This has been a priority for me in the 
quarter century I have been in Con-
gress. I have supported every single re-
form that has advanced. But we have a 
change today because we have never 
had in 10 years the alignment with a 
House leadership and a Senate leader-
ship that will not bury it and a Presi-
dent who will enthusiastically sign it 
into law. 
This is a landmark legislation that 
many of us have been working on lit-
erally for decades, and this is one more 
example of what difference it makes to 
have Democrats in charge and being 
able to advance meaningful gun safety. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their hard work, and I am proud to 
stand with them. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 41⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 61⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the right to bear arms 
is an important part of the constitu-
tional fabric of this country, but it is

not without limits. And the notion 
that America has 4 percent of the 
world’s population but 40 percent of the 
world’s guns and a disproportionately 
high amount of homicides and suicides 
by guns should shock the conscience of 
every single person in this Chamber. 
Mass shooting after mass shooting 
after 
mass 
shooting, 
and 
yet 
we 
haven’t acted to protect the health, 
safety, and well-being of the American 
people. 
That is why H.R. 8 is so significant. 
Universal criminal background check 
legislation is reasonable under the cir-
cumstances given the tragedies that we 
confront. 
House Democrats will not just talk 
about it. We are about it. That is why 
we will pass H.R. 8, and now we have a 
Senate and a President who will ulti-
mately get it over the finish line. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this lifesaving legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the legislation we are 
considering today. 
In cities across America, violent 
crime has increased; and in cities 
across America, laws already exist to 
severely punish violent criminals. But 
despite this, we are seeing local elected 
officials, district attorneys, and pros-
ecutors refuse to enforce existing laws 
and police who are continuously held 
back from doing their jobs. 
Instead of offering real solutions to 
improve public safety, it seems the ma-
jority is determined to punish law- 
abiding citizens while doing nothing to 
actually close loopholes in the system. 
If the bills we are considering were 
really stopping gun crimes and violent 
offenders from owning guns, then my 
amendment would be one we are dis-
cussing today, to prevent minors aged 
15 to 17 who have committed violent 
crimes from having their records ex-
punged and thereby able to purchase a 
firearm. 
But rather than take up my amend-
ment 
to 
prevent 
felons 
from 
sidestepping our laws, the majority felt 
it more critical for public safety to ex-
pand background checks to ranchers 
and farmers with pest control issues. 
This is absurd. 
Nothing in H.R. 1446 or H.R. 8 would 
prevent those seeking to harm others 
from acquiring firearms. The people of 
my district deserve better than this, 
which is why I will be introducing leg-
islation that will actually prevent vio-
lent criminals from clearing their 
record. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill and side with law-abid-
ing Americans and side with those of 
us who want to take guns out of the 
hands of violent criminals. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chair NADLER
and my col-
leagues for their leadership on this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, two gun 
violence protection bills that would 
help keep our communities safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I am from Chicago, and 
we are no strangers to gun violence. In 
2020 alone the city recorded 3,261 shoot-
ings and 769 murders. 
Some of my colleagues might point 
out that Illinois has some of the strict-
est gun laws in the country. That is 
true. But studies tracking the guns 
show that guns often come from neigh-
boring States with weaker gun laws. 
People drive one or two States over, 
and they come back with deadly weap-
ons. 
The reality is that State laws aren’t 
enough. We need stronger Federal laws, 
too. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass these critical laws that have bi-
partisan support among voters across 
the country that would help keep guns 
off the streets. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
vious speaker talked about Chicago’s 
strictest gun laws in the country, but 
yet there was a record number of 
shootings and crime last year. 
What could be the cause of that? 
Maybe it is the fact they defunded 
their police, something we have talked 
about now, well, since the Democrats 
started doing it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, one 
more time we see people uncomfortable 
with our Constitution. Our forefathers 
gave us the right to bear arms because 
they wanted law-abiding people to have 
the right to defend themselves. 
Until Ferguson and the rise of the 
antipolice movement about 5 years 
ago, the murder rate in this country 
fell by over one-half between the early 
1990s and around 2014. 
What happened at that time? 
We 
whipped 
up 
some 
antipolice 
hysteria, and since that time things 
have gone wildly up. Now the majority 
party introduces a cache of bills de-
signed to make it more difficult for 
law-abiding people to access a weapon 
while not having any impact on people 
who wouldn’t obey the laws anyway. 
They don’t like the idea of private 
transfers. They don’t like the idea of 
being able to get a gun in less than 10 
days. They don’t like the idea that if 
the government doesn’t give the proper 
information 
over—well, 
apparently, 
they like the idea that they want to 
keep people from getting guns if the 
government, for whatever reason, is 
slow in turning things over. 
In any event, let’s go back to the 
things that worked for 25 years before 
the rise of the antipolice movement if 
we really want to see improvement. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, Democratic 
leadership is proposing legislation that 
would do nothing to prevent criminals 
from accessing firearms while greatly 
restricting the Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding citizens. 
These bills are being sold to the pub-
lic as an effort to pass universal back-
ground checks. But House Democrats 
fail to recognize that every commercial 
gun sale in the United States already 
has a background check. 
Mr. Speaker, ending gun violence in 
America is a goal we all share, but H.R. 
8 will subject law-abiding gun owners 
to criminal penalties for simply hand-
ing a firearm to another person. 
For instance, if you loaned a friend a 
rifle to go hunting, they could face a 
year in prison or a $100,000 fine. This is 
simply ridiculous. 
The same would be true, Mr. Speak-
er, if you loaned an abuse victim a fire-
arm for self-defense. H.R. 1446 would 
create arbitrary delays for firearm pur-
chases and could allow the FBI to 
delay a firearm transfer indefinitely. 
These bills would do nothing to keep 
Americans safer and, in fact, threaten 
the public safety and our constitu-
tional right to bear arms.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
in what alternative reality does it 
make sense for this Congress to take 
away people’s rights to defend them-
selves and, at the same time, defund 
the police? That makes no sense. 
What we have seen in the last few 
days and the last week in this Congress 
is an effort to punish the law-abiders in 
this Nation. We have to stop doing 
this. 
If we take away guns from law-abid-
ing citizens, we are doing nothing to 
reduce crime. Look at Chicago. The 
law-abiding citizens there do not live 
in a safe environment. They are able to 
follow these procedures that you are 
passing, but it is not going to do any-
thing to stop the violence. 
We have to get away from this. We 
have to stop these laws that do not rep-
resent the will of the American people. 
Let’s stop punishing the law-abiding 
citizens of the United States and get 
back to what they sent us here to do. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, can I in-
quire how much time we have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1300 
March 10, 2021 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, gun 
crime in the United States is a tragedy 
for us all. I heard the talk about Sandy 
Hook, 
about 
Columbine, 
and, 
yes, 
about Parkland, which happened in my 
State. It is a tragedy that we all face. 
But the one thing, Mr. Speaker, we 
all have to remember is that, in each 
one of these instances, the person who 
acquired the firearm that committed 
this tragedy acquired it lawfully, or 
they stole the weapons from somebody 
else. This bill would not change any of 
those tragedies. 
If anything, what this bill does, it 
puts more burden on law-abiding Amer-
icans and does whittle away and strip 
their constitutional right to bear arms. 
You see, the issue is much more about 
mental health than it is about the abil-
ity to acquire firearms. 
For this body to unilaterally make it 
significantly more difficult for a law- 
abiding citizen to acquire a firearm, 
which is their constitutional, God- 
given right, is this body acting outside 
of its authority under the United 
States Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, in short, this bill will 
not fix the tragedies that we face. Un-
fortunately, laws don’t fix most of the 
tragedies that we face as Americans. 
What fixes them is dealing with the 
human condition that, unfortunately, 
inhabits people in our country. We 
should be working on that, not strip-
ping the constitutional rights from our 
fellow citizens. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, since the House passed 
H.R. 8 more than 2 years ago, an esti-
mated 80,000 people have lost their 
lives to gun violence. We have had too 
many moments of silence and too 
many expressions of sympathy. Too 
many families are grieving the loss of a 
loved one. 
Expanding 
background 
checks 
is 
overwhelmingly 
supported 
by 
the 
American public because they know 
that it will make a meaningful dif-
ference in reducing gun violence and 
saving lives. It is time to enact this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act of 2021. This com-
mon-sense legislation would save lives in 
every state, every congressional district, and 
every community, by preventing guns from 
being sold to people who are dangers to 
themselves or others. 
If this is truly ‘‘The People’s House’’ then we 
MUST pass H.R. 8 for the safety and protec-
tion of all people. Enough is enough. Too 
many times innocent lives have been lost to 
guns in the hands of people wishing to do 
harm. That’s why 93 percent of Americans 
support requiring universal background checks 
on all gun sales. The people know: back-
ground checks work. 
By preventing guns from falling into the 
hands of people with mental illness or criminal 
history. Last year was a particularly tragic year 
for the Fifth District, with 177 lives ended at 
the barrel of a gun. My heart breaks knowing 
there have already been 25 gun-related 
deaths in my District this year. As I speak 
today, I am remembering Kennedy Maxie. A 
sweet, seven-year-old Black girl shot and 
killed in Atlanta while Christmas shopping with 
her family last December. She was an inno-
cent victim, killed by someone who had no 
business with a gun. 
The tragedies are too many, and the gun vi-
olence too frequent. It’s past time we did 
something. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Each further amendment printed in 
part C of House Report 117–10 not ear-
lier considered as part of amendments 
en bloc pursuant to section 6 of House 
Resolution 188, shall be considered only 
in the order printed in the report, may 
be offered only by a Member designated 
in the report, shall be considered as

specified in the report equally divided 
and controlled by the proponent and an 
opponent, may be withdrawn by the 
proponent at any time before the ques-
tion is put thereon, shall not be subject 
to amendment, and shall not be subject 
to a demand for division of the ques-
tion. 
It shall be in order at any time after 
debate for the chair of the Committee 
on the Judiciary or his designee to 
offer amendments en bloc consisting of 
further amendments printed in part C 
of House Report 117–10, not earlier dis-
posed of. Amendments en bloc shall be 
considered as read, shall be debatable

trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary or their respective designees, 
shall not be subject to amendment, and 
shall not be subject to a demand for di-
vision of the question. 
The Chair understands that amend-
ments Nos. 1 and 2 will not be offered; 
is that correct? 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, that is 
correct. 
AMENDMENTS EN BLOC OFFERED BY MR. NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 188, I offer amend-

NEW YORK 
Page 1, line 9, insert ‘‘purchase or’’ before

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER) 
and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOR-
DAN) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 45 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc amendment 
includes 
several 
amendments 
that 
strengthen the bill and that thought-
fully modify it to account for practical 
considerations surrounding the use and 
misuse of firearms. 
Among this group are a provision 
that clarifies the exchange of firearms 
between family members, a measure to 
protect more expansive State firearm 
laws, an amendment that would ensure 
ATF 
background 
check 
forms 
are 
available in Spanish, and a proposal 
that would allow for temporary trans-
fers for pest control. 
Representative 
JACKSON
LEE’s 
amendment concerning suicide is par-
ticularly important as it highlights the 
tragic consequences that access to fire-
arms can have on those who intend to 
harm themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of the en bloc amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as a Texan, a constitutional con-
servative, and in strong opposition not 
only to the amendments but to H.R. 8, 
a bill that would impose so-called uni-
versal background checks and gut the 
Second Amendment rights of law-abid-
ing gun owners throughout this coun-
try. 
We all mourn the loss of innocent 
lives from gun violence that has hap-
pened in my district and in those 
around the country. No family should 
ever have to endure such tragic and 
terrible unnecessary loss. 
But the truth is that this legislation 
does nothing to address the root causes 
of gun violence and may do little to ac-
tually prevent criminals from obtain-
ing guns, as has previously been said 
during this debate. 
What will be prevented, though?

firearm if there are reports of break- 
ins; the ability of your suicidal friend 
or family member to ask you to re-
move their firearms from their home; 
or if a colleague comes to you and says 
that they are trapped in an abusive re-
lationship and scared for their life, you 
could face a $100,000 fine or prison time 
for lending out your gun for self-de-
fense. 
If we are going to effect real change, 
we don’t need to tack additional re-
strictions on law-abiding citizens. We 
need to look at the root causes and 
have a transparent and open debate 
here to talk about mental health and 
the proper enforcement of laws that we 
already have. 
This is yet another example of Fed-
eral overreach, another example of the 
erosion of our rights, and a slippery 
slope that will strip all Americans of 
our Second Amendment rights as out-
lined in the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment and the 
bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
As 
indicated, 
the 
Jackson 
Lee 
amendment is a simple, important, and 
straightforward amendment, and it is, 
frankly, to save lives. 
Specifically, the amendment makes 
clear that a gun owner who realizes 
that he or she is at risk of suicide may 
transfer the gun to someone else if the 
risk is imminent, without a back-
ground check, to prevent self-harm. 
This amendment will help ensure 
that no person who is experiencing a 
suicidal crisis will feel compelled to re-
tain their gun when it would be better 
for them to temporarily transfer it to 
someone else. 
Contrary to what my friends on the 
other side have said, H.R. 8 does al-
ready exempt from the requirement of 
a background check ‘‘a temporary 
transfer that is necessary to prevent 
imminent death or great bodily harm, 
including harm to self, family, house-
hold members, or others, if the posses-
sion by the transferee lasts only as 
long as immediately necessary to pre-
vent the imminent death or great bod-
ily harm, including the harm of domes-
tic violence, dating partner violence, 
sexual assault, stalking, and domestic 
abuse.’’ 
This amendment, however, clarifies 
that this last option is available to 
someone who is at risk for suicide. 
I ask my colleagues to support the 
Jackson Lee amendment to protect 
those who may be a danger to them-
selves. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Jackson 
Lee Amendment No. 9 included in the Chair-
man En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of 2021,’’ 
which would require a background check on 
every gun sale or transfer with limited excep-
tions, such as gifts to family members and 
transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self- 
defense. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 makes 
a simple common-sense improvement to the 
bill. 
Specifically, the amendment makes clear 
that a gun owner who realizes that he or she 
is at risk of suicide may transfer the gun to 
someone else, if the risk is imminent, without 
a background check to prevent self-harm. 
This amendment will help ensure that no 
person who is experiencing a suicidal crisis 
will feel compelled to retain their gun when it 
would be better for them to temporarily trans-
fer it to someone else. 
H.R. 8 already exempts from the require-
ment of a background check ‘‘a temporary 
transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent 
death or great bodily harm, including harm to 
self, family, household members, or others, if 
the possession by the transferee lasts only as 
long as immediately necessary to prevent the 
imminent death or great bodily harm, including 
the harm of domestic violence, dating partner 
violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domes-
tic abuse.’’ 
A gun owner who realizes that they are at 
risk of suicide would have several options 
under this bill. 
They may loan the gun to a family member 
pursuant to the family member exception. 
They may ask a gun dealer to store the gun 
temporarily. 
And if the risk is imminent, they may trans-
fer it to someone else, pursuant to this excep-
tion. 
This amendment clarifies that this last op-
tion is available to someone who is at risk for 
suicide. 
As Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I 
urge all members to join me in supporting 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 by voting for 
the En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 8, the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8 is a strong bill to ex-
pand the federal firearms background check 
requirement as our citizens have demanded. 
To make the bill even stronger, I offer an 
amendment that will help save even more 
lives. 
My amendment would make clear that a 
gun owner who realizes that he or she is at 
risk of suicide may transfer the gun to some-
one else, without a background check—if the 
risk is imminent to prevent self-harm. 
The largest number of gun deaths each 
year are suicides. Studies have shown that 
the prevalence of suicide in the United States 
is directly linked to the easy availability of 
guns. 
Roughly sixty percent of gun deaths are sui-
cides. Tragically, an average of 63 people, die 
by gun suicide every day in the U.S. 
The notion that suicides are inevitable, that 
people will just find another way, is wrong. 
Suicide attempts are often impulsive acts, 
and forty-eight percent of people harm them-
selves within 10 minutes of deciding to at-
tempt suicide. Seventy-one percent do so 
within one hour. 
But those who reach for a gun during suici-
dal crises rarely have a second chance. 
Eighty-four percent of suicide attempts with a 
firearm are fatal. Think about this sad fact. 
Temporarily reducing access to guns signifi-
cantly increases the likelihood of surviving a 
suicide attempt. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of the bloc of amendments that includes 
my proposed revision to H.R. 8. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, just yes-
terday afternoon at 3 o’clock in At-
lanta, an armed robber walked into 
Chick-fil-A to rob the place. 
Now, think about that. You are in 
there with your children, getting a 
meal in the middle of the day, and 
somebody comes in with a gun, puts 
your life at risk. Everybody in the 
place is at risk. 
Did that guy get a background check 
to get his firearm? We don’t know yet, 
but odds are he didn’t because most of 
these crimes that are committed with 
a gun are with people who don’t—guess 
what? I have a news flash—they don’t 
follow the law. 
Robbing the Chick-fil-A at 3 o’clock 
in the afternoon in Atlanta is not in 
accordance with the law. But I will tell 
you what happened. An armed citizen 
stopped the robbery using his firearm, 
a legally obtained firearm, and saved 
everybody in the place. 
Do you know who is happy? The peo-
ple in the Chick-fil-A are happy that 
the guy who bought the gun legally 
was there to save them and their chil-
dren. That is who is happy. 
This legislation, Mr. Speaker, dis-
arms that person who operated his fire-
arm legally. That is what this legisla-
tion does. It disarms America. It says 
to the criminal: Keep on not abiding by 
the law. You got your weapon illegally. 
You are going to keep doing it. 
It doesn’t stop them from doing any-
thing. What it does do is it stops the 
guy who is going to get his firearm le-
gally and end the crime in his commu-
nity. That is who it stops. 
No charges are pending on that indi-
vidual in Atlanta who stopped that 
crime. No charges are pending. He fol-
lowed the law. 
This bill, Mr. Speaker, seeks to pun-
ish people who want to follow the law, 
and that is what is going to happen. 
Do you know what is going to happen 
when we do this? There are going to be 
more crimes. There are going to be 
more unauthorized weapons out there, 
and there are going to be less people 
out there defending themselves and our 
community. That is what is happening. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), the chairman of 
our task force. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, that is nonsense. What was 
just said on the floor is not accurate. 
The only thing this bill does is re-
quire a background check. If someone 
has legally purchased a firearm and 
passed a background check, nobody is 
going to take that gun away from 
them. They legally purchased it. They 
passed the background check. 
To come out with that kind of non-
sense, that type of scare tactic, is not 
complementary to the decorum of this

House, and it does not speak to this 
bill. 
b 1545 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think part of the point 
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
was this system is a mess. Over 110,000 
people were denied access to a firearm 
when they went through the back-
ground check, but only 12 were pros-
ecuted. Mr. MASSIE led off our debate 
by talking about this one. That tells 
you one or two things. 
I think the main takeaway is, how 
many people were falsely denied? Or if 
they weren’t, why weren’t more people 
prosecuted? 
If the focus is to make sure the bad 
guy doesn’t get the gun, holy cow, over 
110,000 were denied access to a firearm, 
not given a clearance. Yet only 12 pros-
ecuted? 
If you guys want to work with us on 
that issue, we are happy to do that. In 
fact, we have supported that and 
talked about that, but you don’t want 
to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I grew up on a farm. I 
was taught at an early age how to han-
dle a .22 and shotgun. We used them for 
hunting, to put food on the table. 
But this bill is just simply a back-
ground check for every gun sale or 
transfer, 
with 
commonsense 
excep-
tions. As the previous speaker noted, 
this has nothing to do with keeping 
someone who legally obtained a gun 
from getting one. 
When my niece got her first buck 
over the holidays at the family farm, 
my brother-in-law gave her his favorite 
shotgun as a present. They were all so 
excited. That would be exempted from 
any paperwork, and that just makes 
sense. 
My amendment also makes sense. It 
simply codifies the practice of ensuring 
that the background check forms and 
notifications used to purchase or trans-
fer a firearm remain available in Span-
ish, as well as in English. 
Our country is blessed with a diverse 
population. Language diversity is part 
of that diversity that we should cele-
brate. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. CRIST). 
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. 
I also rise for my constituent, Mo-
hammed Haitham. Mo was a young 
sailor who followed his mother’s foot-
steps into the Navy, with the dream of 
becoming a pilot. 
When a Saudi terrorist started shoot-
ing, Mo sacrificed himself to protect 
others. That is who he was. 
Service, selflessness, sacrifice, Mo 
represented the very best in all of us. 
The great State of Florida is proud of 
him and proud to call him one of our 
own. 
The attack at Naval Air Station Pen-
sacola killed three young sailors and 
wounded eight more. 
The terrorist bought the gun legally, 
using a hunting license to get it. Al- 
Qaida and ISIS know about this loop-
hole, and until we close it, the Amer-
ican people will remain vulnerable. 
That is why my bipartisan bill to 
close the Pensacola loophole has the 
support of the Brady Campaign, the 
Giffords, Major County Sheriffs, and 
the Fraternal Order of Police. 
I look forward to working with the 
chairman and my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to pass this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, we lament 
the death of our good friend, Mr. 
CRIST’s constituent, Mo. We lament it. 
We especially lament it because when 
you are in the military and you are on 
base and you are in uniform, you are 
prohibited from carrying a firearm. 
Think about that. Those in our country 
most well trained to use a firearm lose 
their lives because they cannot defend 
themselves, as a regulation by the DOD 
that says they cannot carry a firearm 
on base. That is why Mo is not here. 
Sure, there is a Saudi terrorist in 
town that is killing people, but Mo 
could have stopped that if Mo were al-
lowed to use his skills provided by the 
taxpayers and desired by him. He want-
ed to serve his country, he wanted to 
serve his community, and he should 
have been allowed to. 
This bill is more of the same thing, 
disallowing American citizens to de-
fend themselves. Unfortunately, Mo is 
a prime example. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment, to make 
perfectly clear that transfers of fire-
arms between family members do not 
require a background check, are not 
subject to the strictures of this bill. We 
should make that clear in order to con-
firm what we have all said here today, 
that this is a bill that targets those 
who break the law, not those who abide 
by it. 
My amendment shows respect for the 
important tradition within many fami-
lies in western Pennsylvania and else-
where of passing down a shotgun or a 
hunting rifle from a father to a son. 
That is allowed under our bill. 
And a further and more important 
sign of respect will come when we vote 
for final passage tomorrow to strength-
en the right of those who obey the law 
by keeping those who break it away 
from your right to own a firearm. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, we can say we are opposed 
to the en bloc amendments for all of 
the reasons we have cited now in the 
last hour and a half on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as has been said over 
and over again on the floor of the 
House, H.R. 8 provides for the legal ac-
cess to guns. It does not take away 
guns from any American. 
In addition, the Second Amendment 
is truly preserved with H.R. 8, and it is 
in compliance with the law which al-
lows the regulation of guns, even with 
the Second Amendment. 
We ask our colleagues to support 
H.R. 8 and the en bloc amendments in-
cluded therein. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 188, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The en bloc amendments were agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that amendment No. 
7 will not be offered. 
The previous question is ordered on 
the bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 188, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 1446) to amend chapter 44 of 
title 
18, 
United 
States 
Code,

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the bill is

SUCH A LICENSEE. 
Section 922(t) of title 18, United States 
Code is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking clause 
(ii) and inserting the following: 
‘‘(ii) in the event the system has not noti-
fied the licensee that the receipt of a firearm 
by such other person would violate sub-
section (g) or (n) of this section— 
‘‘(I) not fewer than 10 business days (mean-
ing a day on which State offices are open) 
has elapsed since the licensee contacted the 
system, and the system has not notified the 
licensee that the receipt of a firearm by such 
other person would violate subsection (g) or 
(n) of this section, and the other person has 
submitted, electronically through a website

first-class mail, a petition for review which— 
‘‘(aa) certifies that such other person has 
no reason to believe that such other person

and the system has not notified the licensee 
that the receipt of a firearm by such other 
person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of

(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(7) The Attorney General shall— 
‘‘(A) prescribe the form on which a petition

elapsed since the licensee initially contacted 
the system about a firearm transaction, the 
system notifies the licensee that the receipt 
of a firearm by such other person would not 
violate subsection (g) or (n), the licensee 
may continue to rely on that notification for 
the longer of— 
‘‘(i) an additional 25 calendar days after 
the licensee receives the notification; or 
‘‘(ii) 30 calendar days after the date of the 
initial contact. 
‘‘(B) If such other person has met the re-

SEC. 3. GAO REPORTS. 
Within 90 days after the end of each of the 
1-year, 3-year, and 5-year periods that begin 
with the effective date of this Act, the Comp-
troller General of the United States shall 
prepare and submit to the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
Senate a written report analyzing the extent 
to which, during the respective period, para-
graphs (1)(B)(ii) and (7) of section 922(t) of 
title 18, United States Code, have prevented 
firearms from being transferred to prohib-
ited persons, which report shall include but 
not be limited to the following— 
(1) an assessment of the overall implemen-
tation of such subsections, including a de-
scription of the challenges faced in imple-
menting such paragraphs; and

FIREARM TRANSFERS NOT IMME-
DIATELY APPROVED BY NICS SYS-
TEM, THAT WERE NOT RESPONDED 
TO IN A TIMELY MANNER. 
The Director of the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation shall make an annual report to 
the public on the number of petitions re-
ceived by the national instant criminal 
background check system established under 
section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence 
Prevention Act that were submitted pursu-
ant to subclause (I) of section 922(t)(1)(B)(ii) 
of title 18, United States Code, with respect 
to which a determination was not made 
within the 10-day period referred to in sub-
clause (II) of such section. 
SEC. 5. REPORT TO THE CONGRESS. 
Within 150 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Attorney General, in 
consultation with the National Resource 
Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms, 
shall submit to the Congress a report ana-
lyzing the effect, if any, of this Act on the 
safety of victims of domestic violence, do-
mestic abuse, dating partner violence, sexual 
assault, and stalking, and whether any fur-
ther amendments to the background check 
process, including amendments to the condi-
tions that must be met under this Act for a 
firearm to be transferred when the system 
has not notified the licensee that such trans-
fer would not violate subsection (g) or (n) of 
section 922 of title 18, United States Code, 
would likely result in a reduction in the risk 
of death or great bodily harm to victims of 
domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating 
partner violence, sexual assault, and stalk-
ing. 
SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act shall take effect 210 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
is debatable for 1 hour equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1446. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1446, the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act of 2021, is a 
critical bill to provide law enforcement 
the necessary time to keep firearms 
out of the hands of those who are not 
legally eligible to own them. 
The 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME 
Church in Charleston, which killed 
nine innocent people, stands as a tragic 
reminder of how current background 
check laws sometimes fall short. 
Under current law, a licensed gun 
dealer conducting a background check 
on a prospective purchaser is permitted 
to sell the firearm to the purchaser if 
there has been no determination from 
the background check system, com-
monly called NICS, after 3 business 
days. 
This is the case even if the system 
has not indicated that the person has 
actually passed the background check. 
Often, we refer to this as a default pro-
ceed transaction. 
While 
96 
percent 
of 
background 
checks are processed within 3 business 
days, an analysis of FBI data showed 
that over 35,000 guns were transferred 
to prohibited purchasers between 2008

March 10, 2021 
and 2017 because of the default proceed 
rule. 
On average, over the course of the 
last decade, 10 prohibited individuals 
have been able to purchase guns at li-
censed firearms dealers through the de-
fault proceed rule every single day. 
The cases in which there is a delay 
are the very cases that ought to be 
carefully investigated. 
If NICS is unable to return an instant 
determination—and especially if there 
is no report after 3 days—there is cause 
for concern. There may be a good rea-
son that these individuals should not 
own firearms, but the current system 
allows the transfer nonetheless. 
Under this legislation, as under cur-
rent law, a sale may proceed imme-
diately once a background check clears 
a purchaser, which is the case in the 
vast majority of instances. 
This bill provides, however, that for 
checks taking longer to complete, the 
FBI will have 10 business days for the 
initial background check investigation 
period. If the check is not completed 
during this time, an individual may 
submit a petition for expedited review. 
If a petition is submitted, unless NICS 
provides an answer within the next 10 
business 
days, 
either 
clearing 
the 
transaction or stopping it, a gun dealer 
has the discretion to complete the sale 
and transfer the firearm. 
We must ensure that firearms trans-
fers are lawful, and in some instances, 
that requires additional time. That is 
why H.R. 1446 is needed, to prevent the 
sale of firearms to prohibited individ-
uals by providing the FBI with addi-
tional time to complete background 
checks. 
H.R. 1446 is a sensible and necessary 
approach to closing a dangerous loop-
hole, and I commend our colleague, 
Congressman JIM CLYBURN, the distin-
guished Democratic whip, for intro-
ducing this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1600 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
here today a retired law enforcement 
officer and the victim of two violent 
gun crimes. 
While off duty, a repeat offender shot 
me through my car window while I was 
with my wife, Jodi. While on duty, an-
other violent criminal pointed his gun 
at me and pulled the trigger. By the 
grace of God, his gun malfunctioned. 
Mr. Speaker, I was fighting for my life. 
I am lucky to be here today to speak to 
this body. 
Criminals who are willing to take 
someone’s life don’t care about the gun 
legislation we debate in Congress. And 
the bills we are debating this week 
would not have prevented those two 
criminals from attempting to take my 
life. 
So let’s talk about who is going to be 
impacted by these bills. The law-abid-
ing citizens who are looking to protect 
themselves, their families, and their 
communities from death or great bod-
ily harm. They will be the ones who are 
penalized for and prevented from exer-
cising their Second Amendment rights. 
Defending my constituents’ constitu-
tional rights will be something I do 
until my very last day in office, and I 
implore my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the sponsor of 
this legislation, and the distinguished 
majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I lis-
tened to my colleague on the other 
side. I still think about the night of 
June 17, 2015, when at about 9:00 in the 
evening, I received a phone call inform-
ing me that something had happened at 
Mother 
Emanuel 
AME 
Church 
in 
Charleston, South Carolina, a church 
that I know very well and the members 
I know very well. 
Much to my dismay, I learned later 
in the evening that a Bible study that 
was taking place at that church had 
welcomed in a stranger. 
I grew up in a parsonage, and I grew 
up learning that which we find there in 
the book of Hebrew, the 11th chapter: 
Faith is the substance of things hoped 
for, the evidence of things unseen. 
These people were practicing their 
faith, a faith that taught them to wel-
come in a stranger. A stranger came to 
their door, and they welcomed him into 
their Bible study. They sat down, and 
he sat with them for an hour. In the 
further practice of their faith, as they 
concluded their Bible study, they rose 
to pray, and with bowed heads, only to 
open their eyes to the sound of gunfire. 
The stranger that they had welcomed 
in opened fire and killed nine of them, 
one of whom was the pastor, a former 
intern of mine. 
Now, we later found out that the gen-
tleman who perpetrated this crime was 
a white supremacist that studied the 
history of that church; and because it 
was the most historic African-Amer-
ican church in South Carolina, he tar-
geted that church and its worshippers. 
However, he should not have had the 
gun. 
The reason he had the gun is because 
when he went to purchase it, and the 3 
days expired, as current law allows, 
they had not been able to verify the in-
formation he had given them and, 
therefore, could not complete the back-
ground check. But under the law, they 
had to sell him the gun after the 3 
days, only to find out several days 
later that the wrong information had 
been put into the record. 
I sincerely believe that this gentle-
man’s sophistication, he knew he was 
not to have a gun. Now, I ask: Did he 
give the wrong information inten-
tionally? 
I think so. When they found the 
error, it was too late. Nine souls had 
perished. 
Now, the gentleman said that he is 
lucky that the gun didn’t go off, and 
these laws would not have prevented 
that. This law would have prevented 
that gentleman from getting a gun. 
Now, I don’t know why the other side 
continues to misrepresent what we are 
trying to do here. All we are saying is 
if at the end of the 3 days, it ought to 
move to 10 days. And if the 10 days ex-
pire, you can ask for expedited search. 
And if that expires, you still have 10 
days. The maximum is 30 days. Nobody 
is keeping a gun away. Everybody 
should be able to wait 30 days. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. CLYBURN. I ask the other side: 
Is a wait of 30 days worth the death of 
nine unsuspecting souls? 
That alone ought to instruct them on 
legislation like this. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
vious speaker indicated that you have 
to ask the government to exercise your 
constitutional right. That is the prob-
lem. What happened in Charleston was 
terrible, it was wrong, and wrong as 
wrong can be. But this bill is not going 
to stop—the FBI had 2 months. It 
didn’t do it. It didn’t stop this guy. 
They had 2 months. 
What this bill does is shift the bur-
den. It takes it from 3 days to 10 days, 
and the burden now becomes on the 
American citizen to be able to exercise 
their constitutional right. That is not 
what the Second Amendment is sup-
posed to be about. Unfortunately, it is 
where the Democrats want to take our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, if we 
lose the Second Amendment, then the 
First will fall. I want to remind my 
colleagues of a simple fact that is far 
too often swept under the rug by the 
left. Americans have a right to obtain 
a firearm for lawful purposes. 
I will say it again louder for those on 
the left, sleeping in the back. Ameri-
cans have a right to obtain firearms. 
This is my right. And, Mr. Speaker, 
this is your right. But let me be clear 
to everyone in this Chamber: You will 
not take this right away from us. 
I know it is easy to be sucked into 
the D.C. bubble, but outside of here, in 
real America, when we say, ‘‘Come and 
take it,’’ we damn well mean it. 
This bill would unconstitutionally 
place the burden of proof for firearms 
purchases and transfers on American 
citizens instead of placing the burden 
firmly where it belongs, on the shoul-
ders of the government. 
But let us be clear. The left is not 
here today to debate this bill, nor are 
they here to legislate in the best inter-
ests of the American people. They are 
here to shove it down our throats. My 
colleagues and I on the right have been 
called here to defend one of our most

sacred rights because you, Mr. Speak-
er, think that the Constitution is just 
another piece of paper to tear down the 
middle of and toss aside. 
I speak for millions of Americans. I 
specifically 
speak 
for 
700,000-plus 
Americans in my district when I say 
that if you think this bastardization of 
the Constitution will be met with si-
lence, then you know nothing of the 
America I know. You want my guns; I 
know it. We all know it. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, you can come and take them. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
great leadership of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. Thank you for bringing this 
important legislation to the floor, Mr. 
NADLER. 
And, again, as an authority on the 
Constitution, you and I know that we 
do respect the right of the gentleman 
to have a gun. We just want to make 
sure that we are keeping people safe. 
Mr. Speaker, the gun violence crisis 
in America is a challenge to the con-
science of our country, one that de-
mands that we act. We know what 
must be done. The solutions are clear. 
They have overwhelming bipartisan 
support across the country. These solu-
tions will save lives. 
That is why I am so pleased to rise on 
the floor to support Mr. CLYBURN’s leg-
islation, H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act to ensure that uni-
versal background checks do save lives. 
He explained so clearly the purpose of 
his legislation. I associate myself with 
his remarks. I know how painful it is 
because he had friends in that church 
whom we have met families of since 
then. 
I also rise to support H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of Mr. 
MIKE THOMPSON. Mr. THOMPSON is a 
gun owner. He is a veteran. He respects 
the Second Amendment, and he is the 
chair of the Gun Violence Prevention 
Task Force. I thank him for his dec-
ades 
of 
leadership 
on 
background 
checks and for the perspective he 
brings, again, as a gun owner and a vet-
eran and a hunter. 
We all salute the extraordinary work 
of Mr. CLYBURN, the leader of the En-
hanced Background Checks Act, to 
close the Charleston loophole, and we 
respect him for the work he has done in 
his community to turn their agony 
into action, their pain into saving 
other people’s lives. 
I thank all the Members who have 
helped raise a drumbeat on these prior-
ities, including our colleague, Rep-
resentative LUCY
MCBATH, who has 
been such an inspiration to all of us, 
bringing her great generosity of spirit 
in telling her story, sharing that story 
of Jordan with us. 
Now, we also have a debt of gratitude 
to our former colleague, Gabby Gif-
fords, who when she was having a 
neighborhood meeting, there was an at-
tempt on her life. Her courage is an in-
spiration to the country. Her leader-
ship to end gun violence is something 
that is so remarkable. Under her lead-
ership and that of the Bradys, we were 
able to meet with survivors over time 
to try to pass legislation to make gun 
laws clear and better and really adjust-
ing to the realities of technology. 
Another colleague, BOBBY RUSH, lost 
his son to gun violence as well. So, 
again, we hear about the big events 
that take place, and they are horrible, 
but every day people lose their lives. 
In fact, let me just see what the sta-
tistics are. Since 1994, when back-
ground checks were first created, I had 
the privilege of being here at that time 
and actually serving as a whip for the 
legislation. Our leader on the bill was 
Senator SCHUMER. Well, right then he 
was a Member of Congress, CHUCK 
SCHUMER, on this legislation. Since 
1994, when background checks were 
first created, the system has stopped 
more than 3 million dangerous people 
from getting firearms. 
Every day, when background checks 
are used, they stop an estimated 170 
felons, 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 
20 fugitives from buying a gun. Every 
day, Mr. Speaker. 
b 1615 
Yet, over the years, people have ex-
ploited and circumvented the system. 
Today, someone with a violent crimi-
nal record or a history of abuse can go 
to a gun show or go online or even to 
a stranger in person to purchase a fire-
arm. No background check, no ques-
tions asked, all perfectly legal. It 
might be legal, but it is not perfect. 
Even when a background check has 
been initiated, it is not always com-
pleted. That is what this legislation be-
fore us, Mr. CLYBURN’s bill, is about; 
the horrific case that enabled a hate 
crime at Mother Emanuel Church in 
Charleston in which nine innocent peo-
ple were murdered while peacefully 
worshipping. 
Eighty percent of firearms—because 
of gun shows, online sales and the 
rest—80 percent of firearms are sold or 
transferred without completed back-
ground checks. 
So it is in that spirit that I come to 
the floor, but when I come to the floor, 
I bring with me the thoughts of the 
survivors who we meet with regularly. 
We have said to them, We are not stop-
ping until the job is done. 
We respect our Constitution, but we 
also say that the Constitution talks 
about well-regulated. 
Again, these bills that we are talking 
about have bipartisan support by a 
vast majority of the American people; 
over 90 percent of the public, including 
more than 90 percent of gun-owning 
households. Most of these folks who 
own guns have passed background 
checks, 
they 
support 
background 
checks, and they are supported by doz-
ens of leading law enforcement, vet-
erans, local government, public health, 
and other groups. 
For example, Mr. Speaker, the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association, representing 
the Nation’s largest metropolitan law 
enforcement 
agencies 
writes: 
‘‘The 
lack of a background check for private 
sales and gun shows completely con-
tradicts the purpose for which NICS 
was established—to keep guns out of 
the hands of those who do harm.’’ 
For the benefit of those who don’t 
know what NICS is, it is an important 
program. Mr. THOMPSON
has been a 
champion in the funding of NICS. NICS 
is the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System. 
Next, the Association of Prosecuting 
Attorneys states: ‘‘H.R. 8 will help the 
background check system catch up 
with changes in technology and ensure 
that individuals who are prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a gun 
cannot easily buy guns online.’’ 
And the U.S. Conference of Mayors 
writes that H.R. 8 will ‘‘make our cit-
ies safer and in no way compromise 
gun owners’ rights.’’ 
H.R. 8 is very important to us, and it 
is legislation that has broad support. It 
is called the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. That is Mr. THOMPSON’s 
bill. 
And this bill, H.R. 1446, Mr. CLY-
BURN’s bill is the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act. So everything I say 
about one bill applies to the other in 
terms of its purpose, in terms of its ur-
gency, and in terms of its honoring our 
promise to the survivors and the fami-
lies who have lost their loved ones to 
gun violence, that we are not going 
away until this legislation passes and 
that we will meet the challenge of the 
conscience of the country when it 
comes to the gun violence crisis in our 
country. 
And I say that with gratitude to Rep-
resentative MIKE
THOMPSON
and our 
distinguished whip Mr. CLYBURN
for 
their leadership, their determination, 
their persistence, and soon, hopefully, 
their success in turning their legisla-
tion into law, so that we can keep our 
promises to the survivors, and also, 
that we can make the world safer for 
all children and all people in our coun-
try and throughout the world, as we 
are an example to the world. 
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on both of these 
bills. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1446 and 
H.R. 8, a/k/a the gun-grabber bills. 
Madam Speaker PELOSI, you were 
elected in 1987, and I was born in 1988. 
During that time, you say that back-
ground checks have saved millions of 
lives. But what about the more than 50 
million babies that have been mur-
dered through abortion? So I am just 
going to leave that there as we talk 
about the value of life. 
These bills are not about gun safety, 
and they certainly aren’t about reduc-
ing crime. These bills are about con-
trol.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1306 
March 10, 2021 
Two weeks ago, Democrats voted to 
strip religious freedom. Last week, 
they voted to defund our police. Today, 
they are now taking our guns. 
In reality, these bills do nothing to 
improve background checks, as noted 
by an Obama official in 2013: ‘‘The ef-
fectiveness of universal background 
checks depends on requiring gun reg-
istration.’’ 
Instead, it would increase our wait 
times and allow for endless delays for 
law-abiding citizens to purchase fire-
arms. 
Our communities have seen too many 
tragedies perpetuated by sick people 
intent on committing violence, no 
matter the weapon. 
H.R. 1446 puts the onus on individuals 
to contact the government if their 
background check hasn’t been com-
pleted in 10 days. 
You know who cannot afford to wait? 
The single mom looking to protect her-
self and her children from a violent ex 
who has just been released from jail. 
You think this situation isn’t real? It 
happened last month in Orlando. And 
there are thousands more like them. 
You know that the more garbage 
that we find in these bills, the more I 
believe that the motto of these Cham-
bers is changing from ‘‘We the People’’ 
to let’s screw the people. 
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 does nothing but 
make it more difficult for law-abiding 
citizens to protect themselves and 
their families. Under this legislation, 
criminals will do what they do best: 
Break the law and perpetuate crime. 
So I ask my colleagues considering 
supporting these bills: Do you honestly 
think that punishing law-abiding con-
stituents in your districts, stripping 
them of their constitutional rights will 
make them safer? Will you be able to 
look them in the eye as they are the 
next victim of crime? 
As Members of Congress we swore an 
oath to defend the Constitution, and 
that includes the Second Amendment. 
Shall not be infringed. 
You and I both took that oath, Mr. 
Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Members are reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair and not to 
other Members in the second person. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NADLER for yielding, and I 
also thank Representative CLYBURN, 
the author of this legislation, H.R. 1446, 
for this bill. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
domestic 
violence 
claims the lives of far too many, and it 
is especially deadly when it occurs in a 
household with a gun. Women, as we 
know, bear most of this violence. 
In the United States there are one 
million women alive today who have 
reported being shot or shot at by an in-
timate partner, and there are many 
more who have been threatened or 
killed with a gun. And we haven’t even 
yet 
discussed 
what 
the 
additional 
stressors of COVID–19 have done expo-
nentially around the country in house-
holds when there is a gun in the house-
hold. 
Closing the Charleston loophole is a 
critical step to prevent abusers from 
obtaining a weapon. This is not about 
infringing 
upon 
anyone’s 
Second 
Amendment rights. Law-abiding gun 
owners who are duly licensed and per-
mitted, this is not about preventing 
them from being able to have a gun. 
This is a critical step to prevent 
abusers from obtaining a weapon, a 
weapon that will likely be used to esca-
late their abuse and a weapon that may 
have deadly consequences. And as a 
survivor of gun violence, I know what I 
am talking about. 
With this bill and with this amend-
ment we can help prevent abuse, pro-
tect our families, and gather data to 
inform further steps to keep every 
American safe. That is our right. That 
is not a privilege. 
In the next months, we will continue 
to remember those that we have lost to 
gun violence in Charleston and all 
across America. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, Newtown, 
Parkland, 
Las 
Vegas, 
Sutherland 
Springs, Charleston, the attack on our 
former colleague, Gabrielle Giffords, 
these are all tragedies that would not 
have been prevented by H.R. 8 or H.R. 
1446. 
My colleagues across the aisle don’t 
want to admit it, but every commercial 
gun sale in America already requires a 
background check. 
In Charleston, there was no loophole. 
The problem was information sharing. 
If the FBI had checked all available 
databases, then Dylan Roof wouldn’t 
have been allowed to purchase a fire-
arm. Congressman TOM RICE of South 
Carolina has a bill to fix that. 
Republicans are serious about ending 
gun violence and have brought forward 
policies that protect public safety 
without eroding our Second Amend-
ment rights. 
That is why in recent years we have 
passed measures like the STOP School 
Violence Act, the Fix NICS Act, and 
21st Century Cures Act. 
The bills before us this week would 
not build upon this progress but strips 
away from law-abiding citizens their 
rights. 
H.R. 8 would turn law-abiding citi-
zens into criminals if you store a gun 
for a friend or loan a firearm to a 
neighbor with an abusive ex who want-
ed to borrow it for self-protection. 
Even worse, H.R. 1446 would extend 
the waiting period for a firearms sale 
from 3 to 10 business days and allow 
the government to delay a transfer in-
definitely. Indefinitely, as in forever, if 
a government bureaucrat says so. 
Instead of these gun-grabbing bills, 
House Republicans are bringing for-
ward targeted solutions. That is why I 
introduced the STOP II: Classrooms 
Over Conference Rooms Act to double 
funding for the STOP School Violence 
Act to harden schools, to get more 
mental health resources in schools, and 
increase active-shooter training for law 
enforcement. And we pay for it by tak-
ing money set aside for the Depart-
ment of Education to rent conference 
rooms in Washington, D.C. 
However, the left is determined to 
take away your rights, after voting to 
defund the police just last week. 
It is no wonder gun sales and con-
cealed carry permits are at all-time 
highs. These law-abiding Americans de-
serve to have their rights protected. 
That is why today, I am calling on 
my colleagues across the aisle to stand 
up for law-abiding citizens and adopt 
H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reci-
procity Act. 
H.R. 38 is a bipartisan and common-
sense bill that ensures people like 
Shaneen Allen, a single mother from 
south Philly, don’t become criminals 
for carrying a legally owned firearm 
across an invisible State line. 
We need H.R. 38 more than ever. And 
if my colleagues are determined to pass 
gun legislation, then let’s help people 
protect themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit today, we will instruct 
the Judiciary Committee to consider 
my amendment to H.R. 1446 to include 
my bill, H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry 
Reciprocity Act. 
I ask unanimous consent to insert 
the text of the amendment in the 
RECORD immediately prior to the vote 
on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, in 2015, 
a white supremacist with a criminal 
record was allowed to purchase a gun 
which he used to kill nine parishioners 
at Mother Emanuel AME Church in 
South Carolina. 
That shooter, who was prohibited 
under Federal law from owning a gun, 
was able to purchase one because of a 
loophole that allows the sale of a gun 
to proceed if Federal investigators do 
not complete a background check with-
in 3 days. 
Through November of last year there 
were more than 5,800 incidents where 
people who are legally prohibited— 
criminals—legally prohibited from pur-
chasing a firearm still obtained one be-
cause of this dangerous provision, 
which has come to be known as the 
‘‘Charleston loophole.’’ 
H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act, closes the Charleston loop-
hole. It strengthens background check 
procedures to ensure that Federal in-
vestigators have enough time to com-
plete background checks before a gun 
is transferred to the buyer. Common 
sense.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1307 
March 10, 2021 
But closing the Charleston loophole 
is not enough. Current Federal law 
only requires a background check for 
the sale of guns from licensed gun deal-
ers. 
Background checks work. Since the 
law was enacted, 31⁄2 million gun sales 
were denied, which means 31⁄2 million 
people who were prohibited under Fed-
eral law because of a criminal record or 
some other disqualifying information 
were denied the right to buy a gun. 
They work. The problem is more than 
20 percent of gun sales or gun transfers 
happen without a background check. 
And that is why H.R. 8, the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act requires 
background checks on all gun sales, in-
cluding guns sold by unlicensed dealers 
online or at trade shows. 
Every day in this country more than 
100 people in the United States are 
killed with guns. Gun violence is an 
epidemic that threatens the public 
safety in communities all across Amer-
ica. We must not wait for another trag-
edy to strike. 
b 1630 
Requiring background checks on all 
gun sales is a commonsense gun vio-
lence prevention measure that serves 
as a first line of defense to keep guns 
out of the hands of dangerous people. 
I think we can all agree that dan-
gerous criminals should not be able to 
get guns. There has been a lot of dis-
cussion today about Second Amend-
ment gun rights, and we all respect 
that. But what about my constituents’ 
right to live a life free from gun vio-
lence, to take a walk in the park, to go 
to a movie theater, to go to church and 
pray, and to be able to do so without 
the fear of being gunned down and 
killed? There is a competing interest 
here of public safety and protecting the 
security of people to live a life free 
from gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1446 and H.R. 8. 
Join us in supporting legislation sup-
ported by over 90 percent of the Amer-
ican people who have good common 
sense. 
Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Help 
end 
the 
scourge of gun violence in this country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. PALMER). 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, a bill 
trampling on the Second Amendment 
rights of the American people is a con-
venient distraction from the actual cri-
sis in the United States. There are over 
almost 11,000 people killed by drunk 
drivers each year. There were more 
than 81,000 drug overdose deaths in the 
United States in the 12 months ending 
last May. But we are here today debat-
ing a bill to further restrict the rights 
of law-abiding citizens. 
I just heard it mentioned about do-
mestic violence. You could have a 
woman, threatened by an ex-boyfriend 
or a husband, who feels her life is being 
threatened, who would not be able to 
acquire a firearm once she needed it. 
She would have to wait at least 10 
days. 
The vast majority of illicit drugs, 
like heroin and fentanyl, leading to 
these 81,000 deaths are crossing our 
southern border. Instead of addressing 
these issues, President Biden has re-
instituted catch and release, and now, 
we have an overwhelming surge of ille-
gal crossings on our southern border. 
According to the Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement agency, in 2018 
alone, there were 1,641 illegal aliens 
convicted of homicide. How many more 
will it be now that the Democrats have 
signaled that our borders are wide 
open? 
This bill reflects an obsession with 
gun restrictions by my Democrat col-
leagues. Meanwhile, in 2018, more than 
one in six homicides were committed 
without a firearm of any type: 1,500 
were killed with knives or cutting in-
struments, more than 400 with blunt 
instruments, and more than 600 with 
hands and feet. Only 403 died as a re-
sult of a rifle of any kind. 
Mr. Speaker, these numbers are 
dwarfed by the loss of life from the 
failure of the Democrats to enforce 
their laws. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
experts estimate that the Charleston 
loophole has allowed more than 75,000 
guns to fall into the hands of prohib-
ited gun owners. 
The Enhanced Background Checks 
Act is a necessary and straightforward 
fix to close this loophole and allow the 
FBI to investigate potentially dan-
gerous individuals. 
This bill would simply increase the 
time Federal investigators have to 
complete background checks on gun 
sales from 3 to 10 days, 1 week’s time. 
That is all we are asking for, an addi-
tional week for investigators to ensure 
that there is no reason the person who 
is buying a gun should not have one. 
Think of the lives that could be saved 
or could have been saved by allowing 
that extra 7 days. 
Mr. Speaker, I think we can agree 
that gun ownership is a serious respon-
sibility. There is no need to rush 
through a background check with so 
much at stake. This bill is an urgently 
needed tool in gun violence prevention. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
once again pass H.R. 1446 and close the 
Charleston loophole. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleagues for en-
gaging in this debate today. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a higher au-
thority than the law of man. Above the 
Speaker’s podium are the words, in this 
great Chamber, ‘‘In God we trust.’’ 
Do we? Do we recognize that the Bib-
lical record is replete with the violence 
of man? 
Shall my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle admit that law designed to 
restrict Second Amendment rights and 
freedoms are but a veil to conceal the 
violence of man born since Adam? The 
firstborn son of Adam killed his broth-
er in a violent rage. I am rather certain 
he did not use a firearm. 
The Second Amendment protections 
that we have as American citizens 
shall not be infringed. Remember these 
words and that they are born of a na-
tion that recognized our service to our 
Lord. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, im-
proving background checks is common 
sense. Background checks simply make 
it harder for guns to end up in the 
hands of the wrong people—criminals. 
Mr. Speaker, 75,000 guns have ended 
up in the hands of the wrong people. 
The Enhanced Background Checks Act 
gives the FBI more time to complete 
background checks. In doing so, it 
closes the loophole. 
The Framers didn’t think about car-
rying an AK–47 or a semiautomatic 
weapon. That is not what they thought 
about. 
Mr. Speaker, these guns are dan-
gerous. They leave a pool of blood on 
corners in cities across the United 
States of America, and having access 
to them too soon is a deadly decision. 
We must pass this legislation to ensure 
that communities are safe all over 
America. 
Let me just end by saying that we 
have a new item, the ghost gun loop-
holes. Ghost guns are made to evade 
law enforcement. There are ghost guns. 
We should stop them now, dead in their 
tracks. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the FBI tells us, in a 4- 
year time period, 18,000 people who ex-
ercised their Second Amendment lib-
erties to get a firearm who were denied 
got that reversed. Those are just the 
ones who went there and said, ‘‘You 
know what, you guys screwed up. It is 
not really me.’’ They had to work it 
out. 
Mr. Speaker, 18,000 times, the system 
screwed up. In 2017, over 112,000 people 
were denied, but only 12 people were 
prosecuted, which means that, most 
likely, thousands of law-abiding people 
were falsely denied their right to exer-
cise their Second Amendment liberty. 
Now what do Democrats want to do? 
They want to say: Wait a minute. That 
all happened in a 3-day time period. We 
are going to extend that for 10 days be-
cause we know the government bu-
reaucracy will get so much better in 10 
days. We know it will work out if we 
just give them more time to screw up 
more things. 
That is what is going to happen. Oh, 
by the way, that single lady who needs 
to protect herself, she is going to have 
to wait longer now for a system that 
had this many screwups to get the fire-
arms she needs to exercise her Second 
Amendment liberties to protect herself 
and her family. That is what this legis-
lation does.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1308 
March 10, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), 
the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I watched 
this debate. I have to say, we have an 
old saying: ‘‘How do you eat an ele-
phant? A bite at a time.’’ We have had 
two bites today. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not about what 
everybody is talking about. It is about 
the Second Amendment and—I won’t 
call you Democrats. A lot of you are. 
Some of you are socialists that believe 
in taking the right to protect away— 
the Second Amendment—from the law- 
abiding citizens. 
This is just a little step forward, the 
10-day waiting period instead of the 3- 
day waiting period. 
The FBI is controlled by the Presi-
dent. He, in fact, can say take 6 months 
or 6 years for a legal purchase of a 
weapon. That is what you are really 
saying. 
Taking away the right to protect 
your home and your liberty, not just 
from criminals but those who would 
take away your rights as a govern-
ment, the Second Amendment is what 
it is all about, to protect from the tyr-
anny that could occur by the wrong 
leaders taking rights and freedoms 
away from you. 
That is why I, as a board member, 
support this idea of the Second Amend-
ment and ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on both 
of these bills. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, some of 
my colleagues are invoking the Second 
Amendment 
quite 
promiscuously 
today, but they obviously haven’t read 
any of the relevant Supreme Court au-
thority because Justice Scalia, in Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Heller, explicitly 
upheld reasonable, commonsense regu-
lations 
to 
guarantee 
that 
violent 
criminals don’t get guns. 
So, everything that we are doing is 
perfectly in advance of, in pursuit of, 
Second Amendment rights that are ex-
ercised coextensively with the public 
safety and with the common good. 
Here is a regulation that we need, 
that we have known we have needed 
ever since a violent white supremacist 
killed nine African-American Christian 
worshippers at a Bible class in Charles-
ton, South Carolina. He should have 
been denied a gun, but he got it be-
cause the background check search 
wasn’t completed in 3 days. He got it 
automatically, although he shouldn’t 
have had it, and nine people are dead 
because of it. 
We say, let’s close that loophole. 
Just like with H.R. 8, let’s make sure 
that the universal background check is 
universal. 
Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the Amer-
ican people support it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman very much for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is reasonable, com-
monsense gun safety legislation con-
templated by Justice Scalia, by the Su-
preme Court, under the Second Amend-
ment of the Constitution. 
It is what America needs so that we 
don’t have a rate of gun violence and 
gun deaths 25 times higher than every-
body else in the industrialized world. 
Yet, some people are so under the 
spell of the NRA, a deeply corrupt or-
ganization that is ripping off money 
from loyal gun owners around the 
country, that they are unwilling to 
stand with the common good. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
vious speaker used the term ‘‘reason-
able.’’ This legislation shifts the bur-
den, so you are now telling an Amer-
ican citizen the burden is on you to ex-
ercise your Second Amendment lib-
erties. They deny the background 
check, deny you your ability to pur-
chase a firearm, and the burden is on 
you. 
Mr. Speaker, I would think that a 
professor of law would understand that 
you don’t shift the burden when you 
are talking about a fundamental lib-
erty that we enjoy under the Constitu-
tion. It doesn’t seem reasonable at all 
to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to, one more time, address 
what is going on here and the perceived 
problem. 
Here in the United States, the num-
ber of murders from the beginning of 
the 1990s until Ferguson had fallen re-
peatedly, and the murder rate was half 
of what it once was with a tough law 
enforcement stance. 
At that time, in the Ferguson shoot-
ing, when Officer Wilson, who was 
eventually found entirely innocent by 
the Obama Justice Department, when 
that person died, we whipped people 
into an antipolice frenzy. Because of 
the antipolice frenzy, we had the mur-
der rate in this country go up by 20 per-
cent. 
It then began to drop again until last 
year when we had the horrible events 
in Minneapolis. One more time, we 
whipped people up into a frenzy, and 
the number of murders in 1 year in 
Minneapolis went up 70 percent; in New 
York, 40 percent; in Chicago, 55 per-
cent; and in Milwaukee, 95 percent, 
with the same gun control laws in cit-
ies that are run by mayors who are as 
antigun as you will find. 
The problem here is we whipped the 
people into an antipolice frenzy. The 
police became passive, and a lot of peo-
ple died. The people who were whipped 
into the antipolice frenzy ought to stop 
and consider the huge increase in mur-
ders. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1446. 
This is a commonsense bill that 
would extend the time allowed for the 
completion of background checks for 
firearm sales from 3 to 10 days, giving 
time for a complete background check. 
I want to be clear. I lived with a man 
who slept with a gun under his pillow 
until the day he died. He was a respon-
sible gun owner. And I lived in a home 
with a man who shouldn’t have had a 
gun, and I remember the fear that I 
could die any day and that my siblings 
would die. A gun in a household with 
someone emotionally unstable, angry, 
is plain and simply dangerous. 
Mass shootings and tragic acts of gun 
violence have become far too common 
in the United States. I think my baby 
sister is not alive today because of the 
trauma of living with someone who 
should not have had a gun. 
Yet, I don’t want to take a gun away 
from a responsible gun owner. Every 
American deserves the right to live 
safely.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1446, and in 
defense of the constitutional right to 
bear arms. 
This right does not come with cave-
ats, asterisks, or exceptions. It exists 
to make sure that the freedom to keep 
and bear arms is not unjustly infringed 
upon by the government. 
It is the government that has the 
legal burden of explaining why it is re-
stricting the natural rights of the cit-
izen. H.R. 1446 would reverse that bur-
den and require the law-abiding Amer-
ican to petition for the right to bear 
arms if they don’t hear back from gov-
ernment after 10 business days, 7 more 
than the current law provides. 
In response to this unconstitutional 
action, I will introduce a bill to allow 
a Federal firearms licensee to transfer 
a purchased firearm to a legitimate 
buyer within 3 calendar days of con-
tacting the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System, as opposed 
to the current law, which requires 3 
State government business days. 
As a Federal firearms licensee my-
self, I saw firsthand during the pan-
demic how the closure of State govern-
ment offices across the country easily 
infringed upon our right keep and bear 
arms. With these offices closed, or pur-
ported closed, 3 business days can turn 
into weeks and even months before a 
firearm transfer is allowed to be com-
pleted by government. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1446. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want us to be very quiet in this Cham-
ber, almost to the extent of hearing a 
pin drop. That is what happens when 
you are in prayer: Muslims, Catholics, 
those of the Jewish faith, Christians.

H1309 
March 10, 2021 
Prayer is the most sacred moment in 
many faiths, in all faiths. 
Imagine that moment in Mother 
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, friends of ours across the Na-
tion. That weekday prayer service for 
some is a lifeline for their survival. 
They are huddled in prayer, maybe 
taking care of what they call a broken 
heart, a bad day at the office, a need to 
take care of a wayward child, and in 
comes this young man that they saw 
only as a person in need of prayer. 
That is a song we sing. That we are 
in need of prayer. Just imagine this 
pristine, white, old church symbolizing 
the freedom of slaves, just imagine 
these precious souls who were doing 
nothing but praying. 
I want to acknowledge the pain that 
Whip CLYBURN experienced. I saw him 
in the aftermath of those days. These 
were not just his fellow Americans, 
they were his neighbors and his friends 
and interns. 
How many remember when the com-
mander in healing, the commander of 
bringing people together, President 
Obama, sang the song Amazing Grace? 
That is what life in the midst of a 
storm is about, and that is what we are 
in, in the proliferation of guns. 
And my friends on the other side 
keep throwing darts and bombs about 
undermining the Second Amendment. I 
say it again. From the early stages of 
the Founding Fathers in the Bill of 
Rights, gun usage in America was regu-
lated. The Heller case does not deny 
regulation. In fact, there are aspects 
that allow it. 
So this is a legitimate regulation for 
safety, not control. Because Dylann, 
who went to a gun store and manipu-
lated a gun owner to go and give him 
the gun after 3 days because there was 
something funny about his informa-
tion, this will save lives. Ten days is 
not too long to stop the loss of life and 
the bloodshed that was in Mother 
Emanuel. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1446 to save lives. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to gentleman from California 
(Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
what is the so-called Charleston Loop-
hole? 
It is a provision that gives the FBI 3 
days to provide a background check for 
a citizen to buy a gun. Now, 3 days for 
a background check doesn’t seem un-
reasonable since a credit card check 
takes about 3 seconds. 
Now, if the FBI fails to give a clear 
‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ in 3 days, the sale can 
proceed. That protects our Second 
Amendment right from arbitrary de-
nial by inaction, and the clearance is 
good for 30 days from when you begin 
that transaction. 
Now, this bill repeals the 3-day limit 
and replaces it with a multistage bu-
reaucratic review process that can span 
up to 20 business days. 
It is really quite clever. Your clear-
ance is good for 30 calendar days from 
the day you begin the transaction, but 
the clearance can be delayed for up to 
20 business days. So if you applied on 
January 15 of this year, 20 business 
days takes you to February 16. By 
then, your purchase window will have 
expired 2 days earlier, on February 14. 
You have to start the process over, ap-
plying for a new background check in a 
perpetual cycle. They never have to 
say ‘‘approved.’’ 
Would a government abuse its citi-
zens like that? 
I don’t know. Maybe we should ask 
Lois Lerner or Andrew McCabe. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to H.R. 1446 and the 
last bill we spoke about, H.R. 8. 
These bills continue the systematic 
and coordinated attempt by the Demo-
cratic Party to undermine our Second 
Amendment rights. 
I was sent to Washington by my con-
stituents to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution. I will not stand by and allow 
our rights to be stripped away. My col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
claim that these bills will save lives. 
However, nothing in them would have 
stopped any of the recent mass cas-
ualty shootings that have occurred in 
our country. 
Rather than go after criminals who 
break the law, Democrats want to cre-
ate a false narrative that will crim-
inalize private gun ownership. Demo-
crats will tell you that these bills close 
loopholes, but the loophole they be-
lieve exists is that law-abiding Ameri-
cans are even able to own guns in the 
first place. 
The sole objective of this gun control 
package is to remove constitutional 
safeguards and put in place criminal 
penalties that would unjustly go after 
responsible gun owners. 
The Second Amendment is crystal 
clear, the right to bear arms shall not 
be infringed. Our Founding Fathers 
wrote the Constitution to protect us 
from a tyrannical government, and 
wrote the Second Amendment to en-
sure that the rights of Americans to 
protect themselves was secured. 
These outrageous proposals put gov-
ernment between the American people 
and their constitutional freedoms to 
protect themselves, protect their fami-
lies, and protect their communities, 
and I vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no gun violence 
problem from legal gun owners. And 
this bill, as well as the prior bill, will 
do nothing to stop gun violence be-
cause it unnecessarily regulates law- 
abiding citizens. And we don’t have to 
define that term, I would think, be-
cause they are not criminals. 
The problem is with criminals. And 
because criminals could care less about 
the bills we are talking about today, 
innocent people will die. 
I can think of neighbors of mine out 
in the country where I live, who have 
an ex who would want to cause vio-
lence to them. That lady could come to 
me and say: I can’t get a gun because I 
have got to wait 10 days, but he could 
come this weekend. Would you loan me 
a gun? 
Mr. Speaker, what we are doing 
today wouldn’t allow that. This lady is 
put at severe risk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
consider what they are doing. This will 
not work. Vote against H.R. 1446 and 
support the Second Amendment made 
by people sometimes wiser than us. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Earlier, we had a couple of the folks 
who spoke on our side. Earlier they 
said the Second Amendment is right 
next to the First because it is pretty 
darn important. I think some of our 
folks said that. 
But it struck me that, you know 
what, I don’t know that the other side 
actually cares all that much about the 
First Amendment. 
Think about what has happened this 
past year. Democrats have told Ameri-
cans they can’t go to church, can’t go 
to work, can’t go to school, can’t go to 
a loved one’s funeral. 
Of course, the rules never apply to 
them. We had a Governor of one of our 
largest States—a Governor of our larg-
est State—out at a 5-star restaurant, 
having dinner with friends and lobby-
ists at the same time he is telling folks 
in his State that they can’t even have 
Thanksgiving dinner with their family. 
We see the attack on free speech. I 
mean, just to laugh at this whole can-
cel culture phenomena. First it was 
Kermit the Frog and the Muppets, then 
it was Dr. Seuss. I think yesterday it 
was cartoon characters from the Loo-
ney Tunes. Tack on your right to 
speak, specifically to speak in any type 
of political nature. 
We have had Democrat Members of 
Congress, Mr. Speaker, send a letter to 
carriers, asking those carriers not to 
have certain news networks on their 
system. That is frightening. You talk 
about chilling speech. That is as scary 
as it gets—just because they don’t like 
what is being said on certain news net-
works? Scary. 
And now they are coming after your 
Second Amendment liberties as well. I 
mean, think about your First Amend-
ment rights, your right to practice 
your faith, your right to assemble, 
your right to petition your govern-
ment, freedom of the press, freedom of 
speech. And then the very next right 
the Founders mention, your Second 
Amendment liberties, they are coming 
after that, too.

March 10, 2021 
It wasn’t enough to go after your 
right to practice your faith. It wasn’t 
enough to go after your right to assem-
ble and be with people you wanted. 
Think about some of the things we saw 
this year. We had Democrat leaders in 
States telling Americans you had to be 
in your home at a certain time with 
curfews. You had to be in your home by 
10. 
We had another State say, when you 
are in your home, you have to wear a 
mask. And then we had States say, 
well, when you are in your home, you 
don’t have to wear a mask because you 
are not allowed to have anybody over. 
Government was limiting your First 
Amendment right to practice your reli-
gion, your First Amendment right to 
assemble. And now they are coming 
after your First Amendment right to 
speak and speak in a political nature. 
And here we are today, coming after 
your Second Amendment liberties. 
The Democratic Party is the party 
that says defund the police, open the 
border, attack people’s Second Amend-
ment rights to defend themselves while 
they are defunding the police and open-
ing the border, and all the while they 
are 
undermining 
American’s 
First 
Amendment liberties as well. 
This should frighten everyone. 
b 1700 
This should frighten everyone. This 
should 
frighten 
everyone 
wherever 
they want to go. It is scary. I certainly 
hope we defeat both of these bills today 
when they are offered. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
I have never heard such pernicious 
nonsense as we have heard today from 
our Republican friends. 
They say that this legislation will 
violate gun rights. But all this legisla-
tion does is close a dangerous loophole 
that puts weapons in the hands of indi-
viduals who should not legally be per-
mitted to purchase them merely be-
cause the FBI is not able to complete 
the background check in time. 
The FBI under this legislation will 
have 10 days maybe instead of 3 days to 
complete the background check and de-
cide whether someone is too dangerous 
to have access to guns. That is all this 
legislation does. 
To say that it infringes on the Sec-
ond Amendment, Mr. RASKIN pointed 
out that Justice Scalia in the Heller 
decision upheld this kind of legislation. 
So stop with the nonsense, pass this 
legislation, and make the American 
people safe. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise in op-
position to this Amendment and to the under-
lying legislation which is another attack on our 
2nd amendment rights. This bill trampling on 
the 2nd Amendment rights of the American 
people is a convenient distraction from the 
other actual crises in the United States. 
There were almost 11,000 people killed by 
drunk drivers in 2018. There were more than 
81,000 drug overdose deaths in the United 
States in the 12 months ending last May . . . 
but we are here today debating a bill to further 
restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens. 
This bill endangers women threatened by 
domestic violence from an ex-boyfriend or ex- 
husband. A woman who feels her life is threat-
ened would not be able to acquire a firearm 
when she needed one, under this bill she 
would have to wait at least 10 days. 
The vast majority of the most deadly illicit 
drugs like heroin and fentanyl are smuggled 
across our southern border. Instead of ad-
dressing these issues President Biden has re-
instituted catch and release and we now have 
an overwhelming surge of illegals crossing our 
southern border. According to a report from 
the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
Agency, in 2018 there were 1,641 illegal 
aliens convicted of homicide. How many more 
will it be now that the Democrats have sig-
naled that our borders are wide open? 
Yet we are here debating a bill to take away 
the rights of law-abiding men and women to 
acquire firearms to protect themselves. 
This bill reflects an obsession with gun re-
strictions by my Democrat colleagues. In 
terms of homicides, more than 1 in 6 do not 
involve a firearm of any type. According to the 
FBI, in 2017 over 1,500 people were killed 
with knives or cutting instruments, more than 
400 were killed with blunt instruments and 
more than 600 killed with hands, fists and feet. 
There were only 403 homicides committed 
with a rifle of any type, including a semi-auto-
matic AR–15 that is the target of many Demo-
crat anti-gun activists. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment and the underlying bill.

HAYES). All time for debate has ex-
pired.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER)

DAN) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 45 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, the amendments 
contained in this en bloc amendment 
include important changes to the bill 
that will provide Congress additional 
information to inform our future deci-
sionmaking. 
Representative BURGESS’ amendment 
would require reporting to Congress on 
the number of NICS denials referred for 
investigation after a firearm was sold 
to a person who was later found to be 
ineligible. 
Representative LEVIN’s amendment 
adds State-level data tracking which 
will facilitate our review of which 
State gun safety measures have been 
effective and which should be consid-
ered on the Federal level. 
Representative 
MCBATH’s 
amend-
ment would require critical reporting 
on the impact of the bill on victims of 
domestic abuse. 
Lastly, 
Representative 
NEGUSE’s 
amendment makes data available to 
the public regarding NICS denials. 
These are valuable additions to H.R. 
1446. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support them, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am going to attempt to ad-
dress the hearts and minds of some of 
my dear friends across the aisle, and I 
do have friends: I respect you, I love 
you, and I admire you. 
I recognize that we have all lived dif-
ferent lives, but let me clarify that I 
have a very personal knowledge of the 
way the street works. Criminals are 
not going to follow these laws. 
Madam Speaker, you are talking 
about 10 days—I can have a 10-minute 
override from right here and bring you 
back an illegal gun. 
Do you want one? 
A couple of hundred bucks, Madam 
Speaker, I can get you one. 
Madam Speaker, it is not intellectu-
ally sound to actually believe in your 
heart 
that 
restricting 
the 
Second 
Amendment rights and freedoms to 
purchase, own, and bear firearms of 
Americans that will follow the laws 
you intend to pass is going to impact 
the decisions that are made by crimi-
nals on the streets. It is just not re-
ality. 
This realm is bizarre. Americans are 
watching this right now. They get it. 
They know the criminals are not going 
to follow the law. This is not going to 
impact the criminal realm. 
We have deterioration of our society 
because of the failure to embrace core 
principles and American family values. 
This is what has happened over the 
course of a generation on my watch. I 
am 59. This has happened to America 
as I have matured. I am concerned 
about the future, but I am certainly 
recognizing the core freedoms and prin-
cipled protections of the constitutional 
rights of my children and grand-
children. 
We must not allow that to be deterio-
rated under the guise of protecting our 
citizens from crime. Criminals are not 
going to recognize these laws. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the En-
hanced Background Checks Act. 
In order to truly prevent bad actors 
from purchasing guns, we need more 
transparency. My amendment to this 
legislation demands transparency from 
government at both the State and Fed-
eral level and ensures that we have 
complete information about prohibited 
individuals attempting to get their 
hands on guns. 
Right now, the background check 
system 
relies 
heavy 
on 
States 
uploading accurate records. And with 
this amendment we can better under-
stand which States are doing a good 
job of uploading records to the system 
and which are not. Without good and 
reliable information and without trans-
parency, background checks are much 
more likely to be delayed resulting in a 
higher risk of more tragedies like the 
one at Mother Emanuel Church. 
With this amendment we can ensure 
that prohibited individuals won’t be 
sold a gun before their background 
check is fully completed. If we truly 
want to keep guns out of the hands of 
violent individuals, my amendment 
will get it done. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, what 
we are saying here is that the Amer-
ican people have to beg their govern-
ment to avail themselves of their 
rights: Oh, Federal Government, can I 
speak now? 
Can I defend myself now, or should I 
wait a little longer? 
That is what we are saying now. 
The Constitution says, ‘‘shall not be 
infringed.’’ In Pennsylvania where I 
come from, our constitution says, 
‘‘shall not be questioned.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we are questioning 
it today. We are putting our constitu-
ents and we are putting the American 
people who have the Constitution en-
shrining their rights on the defensive, 
begging their government to avail 
themselves of their rights. 
Now, my colleagues and my good 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
keep on bringing up the horrific trag-
edy and the events that happened at 
the church. We can’t bring that up and 
say that this is the solution when this 
doesn’t fix that. 
Madam Speaker, you can’t say that 
the FBI couldn’t check all the data-
bases. It chose not to. It could have 
checked them in those 3 days, but it 
chose not to. 
Now, those are tragic events for sure, 
but it is not the American people’s 
fault that the FBI didn’t do their job. 
Do not punish the American people. Do 
not abridge their rights because the 
FBI 
and 
because 
the 
government 
couldn’t get it right. Let’s fix the gov-
ernment and allow the people to be free 
and enjoy their constitutional rights 
and defend themselves when they want 
to defend themselves. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE). 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
New York for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act of 2021. 
Under current Federal law, unli-
censed sellers can sell guns at gun 
shows, online, and person to person 
without conducting any background 
check on the purchaser. This loophole 
has dangerous consequences for our 
communities. In fact, up to 80 percent 
of firearms used for criminal purposes 
are obtained without a background 
check. 
I am reminded of my time on the 
New York City Council where I wit-
nessed the murder of my colleague and 
dear friend, Councilman James E. 
Davis. 
Just earlier this week, a gunman 
opened fire on two police officers in my 
district, hitting one officer in the chest 
and another in the leg. Guns are not 
manufactured in Brooklyn, New York. 
Time and time again we have been 
shaken to the core and heartbroken by 
the news of another shooting in our 
communities that we call home. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
sit here and listen to my colleagues, 
and that is what I want to do; but I be-
come more frustrated with the fact 
that I think, Madam Speaker, we are in 
parallel universes. 
We are talking about gun crime. We 
all agree that gun crime is wrong. We 
all agree that the murders that go on 
with gun crime are horrendous and we 
don’t want them to continue. But they 
are not happening as a result of law- 
abiding gun owners. 
We have background checks now that 
work. I have gone through those my-
self. We have dealt with them. 
I grew up on the south side of Chi-
cago. I love Chicago. It pains me to see 
that become the murder center that it 
has become. And now I hear the report 
that the reason it is this is because 
people from Chicago can come to 
Michigan, buy illegal guns, and bring 
them back, that is the fault.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1312 
March 10, 2021 
No, it is a heart problem. 
It is a problem of criminals who are 
not being prosecuted. 
We have FBI who don’t follow the 
background checks and don’t do it in a 
timely fashion. We have a Justice De-
partment that doesn’t prosecute gun 
crimes. And we blame it on law-abiding 
citizens. 
What we will do today—as we have 
attempted other times—is to put law- 
abiding citizens under the gun—and I 
use that word specifically—further who 
will not commit a crime, but have to 
go through onerous legislation that al-
legedly makes more transparent gun 
laws that stomp on the Second Amend-
ment liberties that we have. 
Madam Speaker, that is wrong. That 
is wrong, and it will not end the gun 
problem. We have had a War on Pov-
erty for years and poverty has in-
creased. Government programs don’t 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I appeal to my 
friends on the other side of the aisle: I 
know your hearts are right, but this 
won’t do the job. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, the 
gun violence epidemic has robbed us of 
our loved ones; our safety in schools, 
our places of worship and public spaces; 
and our children. It has ravaged our 
communities 
across 
America 
and 
touched the Halls of Congress. 
It is also very personal to me. I am 
one of the few Members on this floor 
who has been a victim of gun violence, 
and we know what this is all about. 
This is all about making sure felons 
don’t get guns. It is making sure that 
those who are mentally ill don’t get 
guns. And it is making sure that those 
who have committed domestic violence 
don’t get guns. That is all this bill is 
doing. 
But what my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are doing is bowing to 
the NRA that contributes to their cam-
paigns and kissing the rings of those 
who are the gun manufacturers who 
contribute to the NRA anywhere from 
$10 to $60 million over the course of 5 
years. That is what this is all about. 
The American people want to be safe, 
and we are going to make them safe. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for his leader-
ship, and I thank Whip CLYBURN for 
letting us fix the problem of criminals 
getting guns. 
Do my friends on the other side of 
the aisle not understand that Dylann 
Roof had a criminal background? What 
happened is that the storekeeper, in es-
sence, violated the law. He viewed it as 
not violating the law because, after 3 
days, there was no answer. 
Dylann Roof took a gun and became 
a mass shooter in America. Yes, if he 
had not gotten a gun illegally, these 
souls would be alive today. 
In 2018, there were 355 mass shoot-
ings. We have evidence that people 
with guns have not stopped a mass 
shooting. So if there was a person 
armed with a gun inside Mother Eman-
uel praying with a gun, I don’t believe 
that lives could have been saved. 
What I do know is that if this bill, 
H.R. 1446, had been in place, that would 
have allowed a 10-day window to be 
able to determine whether Dylann Roof 
needed to have a gun. It is a simple 
context, simple facts, and it should be 
done to save lives. 
I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 
1446. I thank Whip CLYBURN for his long 
years of persistence. And our sympathy 
goes to those who lost their lives at 
Mother Emanuel in 2015. 
We have come now to be able to say 
no, criminals should not have guns, 
and we should have a NICS system that 
allowed the full review background 
check so that he could not have had a 
gun. What is wrong with that? 
Are we interested in saving lives the 
right way? 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 1446, the ‘‘Enhanced Background Check 
Act of 2021,’’ which strengthens the back-
ground check procedures federal firearms li-
censees or dealers follow before selling or 
transferring a firearm. 
Under current law, firearms dealers are re-
quired to run a background check on prospec-
tive buyers using the NICS. 
Over 90 percent of checks are completed 
within 90 seconds so if the NICS system has 
not returned an answer to the licensed fire-
arms dealer within ten days, the prospective 
firearms purchaser may file a petition with the 
Attorney General for review. 
After another 10-day period has expired, the 
licensed firearms dealer may sell or transfer 
the firearm to the prospective purchaser if it 
has not received a response through the NICS 
system and the dealer has no reason to be-
lieve that the purchaser is prohibited from ob-
taining a firearm under Federal, state, or local 
law. 
Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms 
dealers could not sell or transfer under the 
‘‘default proceed’’ provision until at least 20 
days have passed since the initial background 
check. 
Madam Speaker, the American people are 
demanding effective action to reduce, if not 
prevent altogether, the countless mass shoot-
ings and gun violence in our country that con-
tinue to claim so many innocent lives. 
Newly released data from the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention found 
firearm-related deaths rose for the second- 
straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in 
gun violence. 
In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary 
mortality data shows that there were more 
than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.— 
4,000 more than 2015. 
An Associated Press analysis of FBI data 
shows there were about 11,000 gun-related 
homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015. 
Congress must act to keep our country safe 
through gun safety and violence deterrence. 
There was nearly one mass shooting per 
day in the United States—355 mass shootings 
in 2018. 
In December 2012, a gunman walked into 
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, 
Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, 
and himself. 
Since December 2012, there have been at 
least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 
1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded. 
On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman 
opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers 
at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the 
Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 
527 injured. 
And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting 
occurred at the First Baptist Church in Suther-
land Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26- 
year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and in-
jured 20 others. 
Every day, on average, 92 Americans are 
victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 
33,000 deaths annually. 
States with higher gun ownership rates have 
higher gun murder rates—as much as 114 
percent higher than other States. 
A recent study by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention looking at 30 years of 
homicide data found that for every 1 percent 
increase in a State’s gun ownership rate, there 
is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm 
homicide rate. 
Gun death rates are generally lower in 
States with restrictions such as safe storage 
requirements or assault weapons bans. 
Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians 
in the past 33 years: 0. 
Because more than 75 percent of the weap-
ons used in mass shootings between 1982 
and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger leg-
islation is needed to prevent guns from getting 
into the wrong hands. 
Madam Speaker, enhancing the gun trans-
fer background check system has consistently 
garnered broad public support, as high as 92 
percent, because the American people know 
that the status quo is simply intolerable and 
action must be taken to reduce gun violence 
by keeping dangerous persons from obtaining 
deadly weapons. 
That begins with passing H.R. 1446, the 
‘‘Enhanced Background Check Act of 2021,’’ 
and I urge all members to join me in voting for 
its passage. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, let’s save a life. I am going to 
share with my colleagues an actual 
story going on right now, because my 
citizens have my phone number. I have 
had the same phone number since 2004. 
They know they can reach out to me 
for help. 
A young lady, right now, whose prop-
erty, her yard, her garage, has been in-
vaded night after night after night by a 
strange man. He moves fast. She is a 
single mom, a 30-year-old woman, hard-
working woman, American. 
Many, many years ago, she pled 
guilty to a minor drug charge. It is 
still on her record. She can’t buy a 
gun, but, by God, she is going to get 
one. She is going to get one illegally to 
defend herself and her young child.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1313 
March 10, 2021 
Your bill would make this story com-
monplace from sea to shining sea. I beg 
for you to stand for the people who we 
serve and recognize what you are at-
tempting to do. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I oppose both bills and the amend-
ments for all the reasons we have stat-
ed today. I think my colleague from 
Pennsylvania said it best. We are now 
going to have to wait 10 days to exer-
cise your Second Amendment rights. 
One of the previous speakers, Madam 
Speaker, on the Democrat side said 
that felons don’t get guns. They are 
felons. They are not going to follow the 
law. 
We all know what this is. This is 
going to make it more difficult for law- 
abiding Americans to exercise a funda-
mental 
liberty 
guaranteed 
in 
the 
United States Constitution, the second 
right they have, the Second Amend-
ment to the Constitution. It is going to 
make it more difficult for them to ex-
ercise their fundamental liberty. That 
is what this is about. 
The FBI had 2 months in the Charles-
ton situation to get it right. They 
couldn’t. Somehow we think now ex-
tending it from 3 days to 10 days, a sys-
tem that messed up as much as it has, 
somehow that is going to help, and 
then shifting the burden so that if this 
system that has falsely denied people 
their right to purchase a firearm, time 
and time again, if the system does it 
again, the burden is on you. 
Since when do we ever do that? When 
are you presumed guilty by the govern-
ment? Only now. Only now are you pre-
sumed guilty. You are not going to be 
able to exercise your rights. 
Those are our concerns with both of 
these bills and the amendments that 
are in front of us today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Our Republican friends insist on 
misreading the bill. They insist on 
talking about things that aren’t in the 
bill. 
The bill takes away the rights of no-
body except those who have threatened 
their wives, threatened their former 
wives, threatened other people in the 
community. Those are all the people 
who are affected. 
Yes, we extend the NICS system from 
3 days to 10 days. That means that if 
the NICS system hasn’t reported back 
within 3 days, the FBI gets up to 10 
days. At the end of 10 days, they can’t 
stop you from getting a weapon unless 
the records show that you are not enti-
tled to get the weapon because you are 
a danger to the community. That is 
what this bill does. 
To misread it and say it gives any 
rights to felons, or to gun buyers, or to 
people who are criminals because they 
disobey the law, of course people who 
disobey the law are criminals. But that 
is not what the bill deals with. 
The bill simply says that it effec-
tuates a system that says that people 
who are threats to the community may 
not get guns. And it does not limit the 
time beyond 10 days to make that deci-
sion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-

The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Hudson moves to recommit the bill

The material previously referred to 
by Mr. HUDSON is as follows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. l. RECIPROCITY FOR THE CARRYING OF 
CERTAIN CONCEALED FIREARMS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 44 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after section 926C the following: 
‘‘§ 926D. Reciprocity for the carrying of cer-
tain concealed firearms 
‘‘(a) Notwithstanding any provision of the 
law of any State or political subdivision 
thereof (except as provided in subsection (b)) 
and subject only to the requirements of this 
section, a person who is not prohibited by 
Federal law from possessing, transporting, 
shipping, or receiving a firearm, who is car-
rying a valid identification document con-
taining a photograph of the person, and who 
is carrying a valid license or permit which is 
issued pursuant to the law of a State and 
which permits the person to carry a con-
cealed firearm or is entitled to carry a con-
cealed firearm in the State in which the per-
son resides, may possess or carry a concealed 
handgun (other than a machine gun or de-
structive device) that has been shipped or 
transported in interstate or foreign com-
merce, in any State that— 
‘‘(1) has a statute under which residents of 
the State may apply for a license or permit 
to carry a concealed firearm; or 
‘‘(2) does not prohibit the carrying of con-
cealed firearms by residents of the State for 
lawful purposes. 
‘‘(b) This section shall not be construed to 
supersede or limit the laws of any State 
that— 
‘‘(1) permit private persons or entities to 
prohibit or restrict the possession of con-
cealed firearms on their property; or 
‘‘(2) prohibit or restrict the possession of 
firearms on any State or local government 
property, installation, building, base, or 
park. 
‘‘(c)(1) A person who carries or possesses a 
concealed handgun in accordance with sub-
sections (a) and (b) may not be arrested or 
otherwise detained for violation of any law 
or any rule or regulation of a State or any 
political subdivision thereof related to the 
possession, transportation, or carrying of 
firearms unless there is probable cause to be-
lieve that the person is doing so in a manner 
not provided for by this section. Presen-
tation of facially valid documents as speci-
fied in subsection (a) is prima facie evidence 
that the individual has a license or permit as 
required by this section. 
‘‘(2) When a person asserts this section as 
a defense in a criminal proceeding, the pros-
ecution shall bear the burden of proving, be-
yond a reasonable doubt, that the conduct of 
the person did not satisfy the conditions set 
forth in subsections (a) and (b). 
‘‘(3) When a person successfully asserts 
this section as a defense in a criminal pro-
ceeding, the court shall award the prevailing 
defendant a reasonable attorney’s fee. 
‘‘(d)(1) A person who is deprived of any 
right, privilege, or immunity secured by this 
section, under color of any statute, ordi-
nance, regulation, custom, or usage of any 
State or any political subdivision thereof, 
may bring an action in any appropriate 
court against any other person, including a 
State or political subdivision thereof, who 
causes the person to be subject to the depri-
vation, for damages or other appropriate re-
lief. 
‘‘(2) The court shall award a plaintiff pre-
vailing in an action brought under paragraph 
(1) damages and such other relief as the 
court deems appropriate, including a reason-
able attorney’s fee. 
‘‘(e) In subsection (a): 
‘‘(1) The term ‘identification document’ 
means a document made or issued by or 
under the authority of the United States 
Government, a State, or a political subdivi-
sion of a State which, when completed with 
information concerning a particular indi-
vidual, is of a type intended or commonly ac-
cepted for the purpose of identification of in-
dividuals. 
‘‘(2) The term ‘handgun’ includes any mag-
azine for use in a handgun and any ammuni-
tion loaded into the handgun or its maga-
zine. 
‘‘(f)(1) A person who possesses or carries a 
concealed handgun under subsection (a) shall 
not be subject to the prohibitions of section 
922(q) with respect to that handgun. 
‘‘(2) A person possessing or carrying a con-
cealed handgun in a State under subsection 
(a) may do so in any of the following areas in 
the State that are open to the public: 
‘‘(A) A unit of the National Park System. 
‘‘(B) A unit of the National Wildlife Refuge 
System. 
‘‘(C) Public land under the jurisdiction of 
the Bureau of Land Management. 
‘‘(D) Land administered and managed by 
the Army Corps of Engineers. 
‘‘(E) Land administered and managed by 
the Bureau of Reclamation. 
‘‘(F) Land administered and managed by 
the Forest Service.’’. 
(b) CLERICAL

sections for such chapter is amended by in-
serting after the item relating to section 
926C the following:

tain concealed firearms.’’.

other provision of this Act, if any provision 
of this section, or any amendment made by 
this section, or the application of such provi-
sion or amendment to any person or cir-
cumstance is held to be unconstitutional, 
this section and amendments made by this 
section and the application of such provision 
or amendment to other persons or cir-

CONGRESS MUST CARE FOR ALL 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today to discuss the in-
troduction of our Care for All Agenda. 
Just as our physical infrastructure is 
crumbling, we suffer from lack of care 
infrastructure. In America today, mil-
lions of people cannot get care for 
themselves or their loved ones. We are 
failing children, older adults, people 
with disabilities, and all Americans. 
And we don’t care for the people who 
take care of us. Millions of care and do-
mestic 
workers, 
disproportionately 
women of color, are exploited and paid 
poverty wages. 
With bold, holistic public invest-
ments in the care economy, we can 
heal these wounds. We can substan-
tially raise wages and benefits for 
workers. We can create millions of new 
zero-carbon care jobs. And we can cre-
ate universal programs to guarantee 
care to all people. These investments 
are a crucial part of the Green New 
Deal. We cannot have a truly just, sus-
tainable America without a healthy 
foundation of care. 
The Care for All Agenda, introduced 
with 30 of my colleagues, and with the 
support of over 90 movement partners, 
lays out how centering care can be the 
rebirth of our Nation. 
Join us in building a care community 
and society based on care for people, 
communities and the planet we all 
share.

GUN CONTROL BILLS WOULD 
RESTRICT RIGHTS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to these 
firearms and background check bills 
that would not be effective in ending 
gun violence. 
Instead, these bills would restrict the 
Second Amendment rights of law-abid-
ing Americans. Simply increasing the 
number of laws and adding more hur-
dles to lawful gun ownership does not 
get to the core of reducing gun vio-
lence. 
These changes to the background 
check system won’t stop criminals 
from obtaining firearms. Why don’t we 
focus our efforts on smart policies that 
would actually reduce the number of 
gun deaths? 
Last year, more Americans bought 
more guns than ever. In fact, gun own-
ership has grown significantly over the 
last 20 years, but we have also seen our 
violent crime rate drop over that same 
period. Rather than going after law- 
abiding citizens, let’s figure out where 
we can work together to address the 
real problems here. Let us invest in 
solving the real policy questions we 
can 
answer 
instead 
of 
restricting 
Americans’ freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose these bills. 
f 
DELIVERING ON COMMITMENT TO 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the critically needed support 
for northern Ohioans in the American 
Rescue Plan, which has just passed this 
House. 
For months, we fought to provide di-
rect support to people across our coun-
try who were suffering during the pan-
demic. I am thrilled that the bill pro-
vides vital support for families, com-
munities, essential workers, and small 
businesses. 
The bill provides $1,400 in stimulus 
payments to spur our economy and 
help families, funding for vaccine dis-
tribution, and a historical increase of 
the child tax credit from $2,000 to 
$3,000. 
Let’s be clear: The Republicans’ op-
position demonstrates their callous-
ness during this time of great human 
need. They cite the deficit. Yet, I 
didn’t hear a peep from the other side 
as the national debt ballooned under 
previous Republican administrations. 
President 
Bush’s 
ill-advised 
wars 
have cost us nearly $2 trillion, and the 
debt increased by $676 billion. Presi-
dent Trump’s GOP tax scam increased 
the deficit by $1.8 trillion, helping to 
lead to an increase in national debt by 
$7.8 trillion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so thankful to 
President Biden for delivering on his 
commitment to Build Back Better. The 
American Rescue Plan now goes to the 
President’s desk for signature. I can’t 
wait. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Democrats.

HONORING U.S. ARMY VETERAN 
DENNIS DAVIS 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor a great West Virginia 
icon and U.S. Army veteran, Mr. Den-
nis Davis, who passed away on January 
19, 2021. 
Dennis was the cabinet secretary for 
the West Virginia Department of Vet-
erans Assistance. He understood the 
needs of our veteran community. 
Dennis had also been a member of the 
West Virginia State University ROTC 
program. I enjoyed our time together 
as we met with veterans all across 
West Virginia’s Second District. 
During his lifetime, Dennis was the 
much-admired director for West Vir-
ginia Workforce Development, an edu-
cator who helped guide citizens toward 
jobs, opportunities, and fulfillment in 
their lives. 
We commemorate his leadership, his 
service as an Army veteran, and his 
dedication to our great State. May his 
legacy forever live on to inspire hard 
work, devotion, and service. 
f 
COMMEMORATING TIBETAN 
UPRISING DAY 
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the 62nd 
anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day. 
Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of rep-
resenting an incredibly diverse commu-
nity of individuals at home in New 
York 14, many of whom are Tibetan. In 
fact, one of the largest constituencies 
of Tibetans in the world makes its 
home in New York 14. 
For decades, the Tibetan people have 
bravely fought for their freedom, in-
cluding to seek and fight for the free-
dom to simply be Tibetan: to speak 
their language; to practice their Bud-
dhist religion; to sustain their culture, 
their traditional medicine, and their 
land; and to live freely in their own 
country. 
It is the responsibility of all those 
who value freedom of speech and ex-
pression to stand with them against 
gross human rights abuses. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with the Tibetan residents of New York 
14 and all those across the country in 
their righteous fight against persecu-
tion. 
DELIVERING RELIEF THROUGH 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of Nevada’s Third 
District. 
With the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan, we have delivered on our 
promise to provide the relief that is so 
desperately needed 1 year after the 
COVID–19 pandemic broke out. 
The pandemic has been especially 
hard on my home State of Nevada. The 
primary pillar of our economy, travel 
and tourism, has been absolutely dev-
astated. It is not just our casinos and 
our hotels that have been hit, but our 
restaurant and convention workers, 
our entertainment and stage workers, 
and our aviation workers. 
With the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan, we will save lives and get 
our economy back on track. We will 
get vaccines into arms. We will get our 
kids safely back into schools with the 
$130 billion investment to get schools 
open and make up for lost time in the 
classroom. We will get people back in 
jobs with the expanded PPP loans, re-
lief 
for 
restaurants 
and 
shuttered 
venues, and more. And, of course, we 
will get money into people’s pockets 
immediately through the direct stim-
ulus checks. 
Mr. Speaker, in short, America, help 
is on its way, and it couldn’t be more 
urgently needed. 
f 
GUN SAFETY MEANS MORE 
EQUITABLE FUTURE FOR ALL 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to add my voice to the 
passionate voices born of grief that we 
heard from today, to join my heart 
with their hearts. 
Gun violence robs our communities 
and our families of innocent lives, in-
nocent worshippers, innocent shoppers 
mowed down just because they are 
Latinos. 
I rise for the children in too many 
schools who have lost their classmates, 
for the families who mourn their 
young, for the students who organized 
and petitioned us to act against gun vi-
olence with sensible laws. I am glad we 
passed the gun safety legislation to 
stem the epidemic of gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, New Mexico has the 
fourth-highest gun death rate in the 
country. Today, we took a common-
sense, critical step to keep our New 
Mexican, our American, children, fami-
lies, and communities safe, to drive us 
toward a more equitable, thriving fu-
ture for all.

PEOPLE’S JUSTICE GUARANTEE 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to reintroduce the People’s Justice 
Guarantee, a bold, progressive vision to 
transform our criminal legal system 
from what it currently is to what it 
ought to be. 
For far too long, Congress has en-
acted policies that failed millions of 
men, women, and children by expand-
ing our carceral system and divesting 
from Black and Latinx communities. 
Growing up with an incarcerated par-
ent, these failures are personal to me. 
I worked with folks in communities 
that have been marginalized and ig-
nored, like the incarcerated brothers of 
the AACC in the Massachusetts Sev-
enth, to craft a resolution that con-
fronts the systemic injustices that de-
stabilized families and traumatized 
generations. 
We should provide care for those in 
crisis, not confine them in solitary. 
We should house our immigrant 
neighbors, not deport them from their 
communities. 
We should counsel our kids, not lock 
them up in prison. 
The People’s Justice Guarantee of-
fers these solutions and many others in 
a robust framework for a humane, eq-
uitable, and just legal system. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to reintro-
duce the People’s Justice Guarantee so 
America can finally fulfill its promise 
of justice for all. 
f 
BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for too 
many communities in southeastern 
Pennsylvania, the steady toll of gun vi-
olence day in and day out is a horri-
fying reality. 
Right now, my region is at the epi-
center of a staggering uptick in gun vi-
olence taking place in the background 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. In the first 
3 months of this year, over 300 people 
in the city of Philadelphia have been 
shot. Over 50 have been killed, and 5 of 
those were children. 
Mr. Speaker, the gun violence meas-
ures we are voting on this week close 
major loopholes in our gun laws that 
have allowed people, who we all agree 
should not have guns, to purchase guns 
without completed background checks. 
While our colleagues across the aisle 
claim these laws won’t prevent gun vi-
olence, that is not true. Even with the 
loopholes, Federal background checks 
have prevented over 3 million sales to 
people we all agree should not have 
guns. 
When required and enforced, back-
ground checks work, and they have the 
power to keep guns out of dangerous 
hands and off our streets. 
Congressional complacency in ad-
dressing this issue has made our coun-
try less safe and put children and our 
most 
marginalized 
communities 
at 
risk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support these bills. 
f 
RIGHTS COME WITH 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I grew up a 
gun owner. I have been hunting since I 
was 12 years old. I became an Army 
Ranger and went to war for this coun-
try, where I led over 100 combat mis-
sions, carrying weapons of war at war 
in defense of our Nation. 
But I am also a father, and I also rep-
resent a district that has been hit by 
some of the worst mass shootings in 
our Nation’s history. I learned in the 
Army years ago that citizenship comes 
with duties and rights come with re-
sponsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, we are failing each 
other in this country. It is time that 
we start fulfilling our duties and our 
responsibilities to each other. We have 
the opportunity to do that now and to 
save thousands of lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues 
to join with me and to pass the Bipar-
tisan Background Checks Act.

ing. Such request shall specify the measure 
or matters to be considered. Immediately 
upon the filing of the request, the Majority 
Staff Director (serving as the clerk of the 
Committee for such purpose) shall notify the 
Chairman of the filing of the request. If, 
within 3 calendar days after the filing of the 
request, the Chairman does not call the re-
quested special meeting to be held within 7 
calendar days after the filing of the request, 
a majority of the Members of the Committee 
may file in the offices of the Committee 
their written notice that a special meeting 
of the Committee will be held, specifying the 
date and hour thereof, and the measures or 
matter to be considered at that special meet-

sidered at that special meeting.

(2) The Chairman of the Committee or Sub-
committee 
may 
postpone 
further 
pro-
ceedings when a record vote is ordered on the 
question of approving a measure or matter 
or on adopting an amendment. If the Chair-
man postpones further proceedings: 
(A) the Chairman may resume such post-
poned proceedings, after giving Members 
adequate notice, at a time chosen in con-
sultation with the Ranking Minority Mem-
ber; and

thorized by the person making the remarks

nature of testimony given. There shall be 
prompt return of such corrected copy of the 
transcript to the Committee. Members of the 
Committee or Subcommittee shall receive 
copies of transcripts for their prompt review 
and correction and prompt return to the 
Committee. 
The 
Committee 
or 
Sub-
committee may order the printing of a hear-
ing record without the corrections of any 
Member or witness if it determines that such 
Member or witness has been afforded a rea-
sonable time in which to make such correc-
tions and further delay would seriously im-
pede the consideration of the legislative ac-
tion that is subject of the hearing. The 
record of a hearing shall be closed 10 cal-
endar days after the last oral testimony, un-
less the Committee or Subcommittee deter-
mines otherwise. Any person requesting to 
file a statement for the record of a hearing 
must so request before the hearing concludes 
and must file the statement before the 
record is closed, unless the Committee or 
Subcommittee determines otherwise. The 
Committee or Subcommittee may reject any 
statement in light of its length or its tend-
ency to defame, degrade, or incriminate any 
person. 
(c) Property of the House.—All Committee 
and Subcommittee records (including hear-
ings data, charts, and files) shall be kept sep-
arate and distinct from the congressional of-
fice records of the Members serving as Chair-
man. Such records shall be the property of 
the House, and all Members of the House 
shall have access thereto. The Majority Staff 
Director shall promptly notify the Chairman 
and the Ranking Minority Member of any re-
quest for access to such records. 
(d) Availability of Archived Records.—The 
records of the Committee at the National Ar-
chives and Records Administration shall be 
made available for public use in accordance 
with House Rule VII. The Chairman shall no-
tify the Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee of the need for a Committee 
order pursuant to clause 3(b)(3) or clause 4(b) 
of such House Rule, to withhold a record oth-
erwise available. 
(e) Special Rules for Certain Records and 
Proceedings.—A stenographic record of a 
business meeting of the Committee or Sub-
committee may be kept, and thereafter may 
be published, if the Chairman of the Com-
mittee, after consultation with the Ranking 
Minority Member, determines there is need 
for such a record. The proceedings of the 
Committee or Subcommittee in a closed 
meeting, evidence or testimony in such 
meeting, shall not be divulged unless other-
wise determined by a majority of the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee. 
(f) Electronic Availability of Committee 
Publications.—To the maximum extent fea-
sible, the Committee shall make its publica-
tions available in electronic form. 
RULE VI.—POWER TO SIT AND ACT 
For the purpose of carrying out any of its 
function and duties under House Rules X and 
XI, the Committee and each of its sub-
committees is authorized to sit and act at 
such times and places within the United 
States whether the House is in session, has 
recessed, or has adjourned and to hold such 
hearings. 
RULE VII.—SUBPOENAS, DEPOSITIONS, AND 
OATHS 
(a) Issuance of Subpoenas.—In accordance 
with clause 2(m) of House Rule XI, a sub-
poena may be authorized and issued by a ma-
jority of the Committee or by the Chairman 
in consultation with the Ranking Minority 
Member. Such consultation shall occur at 
least 48 hours in advance of a subpoena being 
issued under such authority. Authorized sub-
poenas shall be signed by the Chairman of 
the Committee or by any Member designated 
by the Committee. 
(b) Oaths.—The Chairman of the Com-
mittee, or any member of the Committee 
designated by the Chairman, may administer 
oaths to any witnesses. 
(c) Deposition Authority.— 
(1) The Chairman, upon consultation with 
the Ranking Minority Member, may order 
the taking of depositions, including pursuant 
to subpoena, by a Member or counsel of the 
Committee. 
(2) Depositions taken under the authority 
prescribed in this subsection shall be subject 
to regulations issued by the chair of the 
Committee on Rules and printed in the Con-
gressional Record.’’ 
RULE VIII.—HEARING PROCEDURES 
(a) Power to Hear.—For the purpose of car-
rying out any of its functions and duties 
under House Rules X and XI, the Committee 
and its subcommittees are authorized to sit 
and hold hearings at any time or place with-
in the United States whether the House is in 
session, has recessed, or has adjourned. (See 
Committee Rule VI and paragraph (f) of 
Committee Rule XI for provisions relating to 
Subcommittee hearings and meetings.) 
(b) Announcement.—The Chairman of the 
Committee shall, after consultation with the 
Ranking Minority Member of the Com-
mittee, make a public announcement of the 
date, place, and subject matter of any Com-
mittee hearing at least 1 week before the 
commencement of the hearing. The Chair-
man of a Subcommittee shall schedule a 
hearing only after consultation with the 
Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking 
Minority Member of the Subcommittee. 
After such consultation, the Chairman of the 
Subcommittee shall consult the Chairmen of 
the other subcommittees and shall request 
the Majority Staff Director to make a public 
announcement of the date, place, and subject 
matter of such hearing at least 1 week before 
the hearing. If the Chairman of the Com-
mittee or the Subcommittee, with concur-
rence of the Ranking Minority Member of 
the Committee or Subcommittee, determines 
there is good cause to begin the hearing 
sooner, 
or 
if 
the 
Committee 
or 
Sub-
committee so determines by majority vote, a 
quorum being present for the transaction of 
business, the Chairman of the Committee or 
Subcommittee, as appropriate, shall request 
the Majority Staff Director to make such 
public announcement at the earliest possible 
date. The clerk of the Committee shall 
promptly notify the Daily Digest Clerk of 
the Congressional Record and shall promptly 
enter the appropriate information into the 
Committee scheduling service of the House 
information system as soon as possible after 
such public announcement is made. 
(c) Scheduling of Witnesses.—Except as 
otherwise provided in this rule, the sched-
uling of witnesses and determination of the 
time allowed for the presentation of testi-
mony at hearings shall be at the discretion 
of the Chairman of the Committee or Sub-
committee, unless a majority of the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee determines other-
wise. 
(d) Written Statement; Oral Testimony.— 
(1) Each witness who is to appear before the 
Committee or a Subcommittee, shall insofar 
as practicable file with the Majority Staff 
Director of the Committee, at least 2 work-
ing days before the day of his or her appear-
ance, a written statement of proposed testi-
mony. Witnesses shall provide sufficient cop-
ies of their statement for distribution to 
Committee or Subcommittee Members, staff, 
and the news media. Insofar as practicable, 
the Committee or Subcommittee staff shall 
distribute such written statements to all 
Members of the Committee or Subcommittee 
as soon as they are received, as well as any 
official reports from departments and agen-
cies on such subject matter. All witnesses 
may be limited in their oral presentations to 
brief summaries of their statements within 
the time allotted to them at the discretion 
of the Chairman of the Committee or Sub-
committee, in light of the nature of the tes-
timony and the length of time available. 
(2) As noted in paragraph (b) of Committee 
Rule VII, the Chairman of the Committee, or 
any Member designated by the Chairman, 
may administer an oath to any witness. 
‘‘(3) In the case of a witness appearing in a 
non-governmental capacity, a written state-
ment of proposed testimony shall include: 
(i) a curriculum vitae; 
(ii) a disclosure of the amount and source 
(by agency and program) of any Federal 
grant (or subgrant thereof) or contract (or 
subcontract thereof) received during the past 
36 months by the witness or by an entity rep-
resented by the witness; 
(iii) a disclosure of the amount and coun-
try of origin of any payment or contract re-
lated to the subject matter of the hearing 
originating with a foreign government re-
ceived during the past 36 months by the wit-
ness or by an entity represented by the wit-
ness; and 
(iv) a disclosure of whether the witness is 
a fiduciary (including, but not limited to, a 
director, officer, advisor, or resident agency) 
of any organization or entity that has an in-
terest in the subject matter of the hearing. 
Such 
statements, 
with 
appropriate 
redactions to protect the privacy of wit-
nesses, shall be made publicly available in 
electronic form 24 hours before the witness 
appears to the extent practicable, but not 
later than 1 day after the witness appears. 
(e) Questioning of Witnesses.—Committee 
or Subcommittee Members may question 
witnesses only when they have been recog-
nized by the Chairman of the Committee or 
Subcommittee for that purpose. Each Mem-
ber so recognized shall be limited to ques-
tioning a witness for 5 minutes until such 
time as each Member of the Committee or 
Subcommittee who so desires has had an op-
portunity to question the witness for 5 min-
utes; and thereafter the Chairman of the 
Committee or Subcommittee may limit the 
time of a further round of questioning after 
giving due consideration to the importance 
of the subject matter and the length of time 
available. All questions put to witnesses 
shall be germane to the measure or matter 
under consideration. Unless a majority of 
the Committee or Subcommittee determines 
otherwise, no Committee or Subcommittee 
staff shall interrogate witnesses. 
(f) Extended Questioning for Designated 
Members.—Notwithstanding paragraph (e), 
the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member 
may designate an equal number of Members 
from each party to question a witness for a 
period not longer than 60 minutes. 
(g) Witnesses for the Minority.—When any 
hearing is conducted by the Committee or 
any Subcommittee upon any measure or 
matter, the minority party Members on the 
Committee or Subcommittee shall be enti-
tled, upon request to the Chairman by a ma-
jority of those minority Members before the 
completion of such hearing, to call witnesses 
selected by the minority to testify with re-
spect to that measure or matter during at 
least 1 day of hearing thereon as provided in 
clause 2(j)(1) of House Rule XI. 
(h) Summary of Subject Matter.—Upon an-
nouncement of a hearing, to the extent prac-
ticable, the Committee shall make available 
immediately to all Members of the Com-
mittee a concise summary of the subject 
matter (including legislative reports and 
other material) under consideration. In addi-
tion, upon announcement of a hearing and 
subsequently as they are received, the Chair-
man of the Committee or Subcommittee

shall, to the extent practicable, make avail-
able to the Members of the Committee any 
official reports from departments and agen-
cies on such matter. (See paragraph (f) of 
Committee Rule XI.) 
(i) Open Hearings.—Each hearing con-
ducted by the Committee or Subcommittee 
shall be open to the public, including radio, 
television, and still photography coverage, 
except as provided in clause 4 of House Rule 
XI (See also paragraph (b) of Committee 
Rule III.). In any event, no Member of the 
House 
may 
be 
excluded 
from 
nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing 
unless the House by majority vote shall au-
thorize the Committee or Subcommittee, for 
purposes of a particular series of hearings on 
a particular bill or resolution or on a par-
ticular subject of investigation, to close its 
hearings to Members by means of the above 
procedure. 
(j) Hearings and Reports.—(1)(i) The Chair-
man of the Committee or Subcommittee at a 
hearing shall announce in an opening state-
ment the subject of the investigation. A copy 
of the Committee Rules (and the applicable 
provisions of clause 2 of House Rule XI, re-
garding hearing procedures, an excerpt of 
which appears in Appendix A thereto) shall 
be made available to each witness upon re-
quest. Witnesses at hearings may be accom-
panied by their own counsel for the purpose 
of advising them concerning their constitu-
tional rights. The Chairman of the Com-
mittee 
or 
Subcommittee 
may 
punish 
breaches of order and decorum, and of profes-
sional ethics on the part of counsel, by cen-
sure and exclusion from the hearings; but 
only the full Committee may cite the of-
fender to the House for contempt. 
(ii) Whenever it is asserted by a Member of 
the Committee that the evidence or testi-
mony at a hearing may tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person, or it is as-
serted by a witness that the evidence or tes-
timony that the witness would give at a 
hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or in-
criminate the witness, such testimony or 
evidence shall be presented in executive ses-
sion, notwithstanding the provisions of para-
graph (i) of this rule, if by a majority of 
those present, there being in attendance the 
requisite number required under the Rules of 
the Committee to be present for the purpose 
of taking testimony, the Committee or Sub-
committee determines that such evidence or 
testimony may tend to defame, degrade, or 
incriminate any person. The Committee or 
Subcommittee shall afford a person an op-
portunity to voluntarily appear as a witness; 
and the Committee or Subcommittee shall 
receive and shall dispose of requests from 
such person to subpoena additional wit-
nesses. 
(iii) No evidence or testimony taken in ex-
ecutive session may be released or used in 
public sessions without the consent of the 
Committee or Subcommittee. In the discre-
tion of the Committee or Subcommittee, 
witnesses may submit brief and pertinent 
statements in writing for inclusion in the 
record. The Committee or Subcommittee is 
the sole judge of the pertinence of testimony 
and evidence adduced at its hearings. A wit-
ness may obtain a transcribed copy of his or 
her testimony given at a public session. If 
given at an executive session, a transcribed 
copy of testimony may be obtained when au-
thorized 
by 
the 
Committee 
or 
Sub-
committee. (See paragraph (c) of Committee 
Rule V.) 
(2) A proposed investigative or oversight 
report shall be considered as read if it has 
been available to the Members of the Com-
mittee for at least 24 hours (excluding Satur-
days, Sundays, or legal holidays except when 
the House is in session on such day) in ad-
vance of their consideration. 
RULE IX.—THE REPORTING OF BILLS AND 
RESOLUTIONS 
(a) Filing of Reports.—The Chairman shall 
report or cause to be reported promptly to 
the House any bill, resolution, or other

measure shall be reported from the Com-
mittee unless a majority of the Committee is 
actually present. A Committee report on any 
bill, resolution, or other measure approved 
by the Committee shall be filed within 7 cal-
endar days (not counting days on which the 
House is not in session) after the day on 
which there has been filed with the Majority 
Staff Director of the Committee a written 
request, signed by a majority of the Com-
mittee, for the reporting of that bill or reso-
lution. The Majority Staff Director of the 
Committee shall notify the Chairman imme-
diately when such a request is filed. 
(b) Content of Reports.—Each Committee 
report on any bill or resolution approved by 
the Committee shall include as separately 
identified sections: 
(1) a statement of the intent or purpose of 
the bill or resolution;

committee consideration of the measure, in-
cluding a summary of amendments and mo-
tions offered and the actions taken thereon;

amendment in the Committee and Sub-
committee and on the motion to report the

such amendment or motion (See clause 3(b) 
of House Rule XIII); 
(5) the oversight findings and recommenda-
tions of the Committee with respect to the

(6) the detailed statement described in 
House Rule XIII clause 3(c)(2) and section 
308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
if the bill or resolution provides new budget 
authority (other than continuing appropria-
tions), new spending authority described in 
section 401(c)(2) of such Act, new credit au-
thority, or an increase or decrease in reve-
nues or tax expenditures, except that the es-
timates with respect to new budget author-
ity shall include, when practicable, a com-
parison of the total estimated funding level 
for the relevant program (or programs) to 
the appropriate levels under current law; 
(7) the estimate of costs and comparison of 
such estimates, if any, prepared by the Di-
rector of the Congressional Budget Office in 
connection with such bill or resolution pur-
suant to section 402 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 if submitted in timely 
fashion to the Committee; 
(8) a statement of general performance

and joint resolutions of a public character 
within its jurisdiction, ensure that appro-

sible and consistent with the nature, require-
ments, and objectives of the programs and 
activities involved. The Committee shall re-
view, from time to time, each continuing

modified so that appropriations therefor 
would be made annually.

timates (See Appendix B).—Not later than 6 
weeks after the President submits his budget 
under section 1105(a) of Title 31, United

mittee shall, submit to the Committee on 
the Budget (1) its views and estimates with 
respect to all matters to be set forth in the

onciliation process, it shall promptly make 
such determination and recommendations 
and report a reconciliation bill or resolution 
(or both) to the House or submit such rec-
ommendations to the Committee on the 
Budget, in accordance with the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.

pointed by the Speaker as provided in clause 
11 of House Rule I, the names of those Mem-
bers of the Committee of not less than a ma-
jority who generally supported the House po-
sition and who were primarily responsible

principal proponents of the major provisions 
of the bill as it passed the House and such 
other Committee Members of the majority 
party as the Chairman may designate in con-
sultation with the Members of the majority 
party. Such recommendations shall provide a

Committee or a Subcommittee, shall hold at 
least one hearing on issues raised by reports 
issued by the Comptroller General of the

the end of the day, the Senate will 
have confirmed another three members 
of President Biden’s Cabinet. 
First up is Representative MARCIA 
FUDGE to serve as the 18th Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development. What 
an excellent choice for the job. She 
represented the people of Ohio in Con-
gress since 2008 and, before that, served 
as the first African American and first 
female mayor of Warrensville Heights 
in Ohio. 
She has a difficult job ahead of her. 
Millions of Americans are behind on 
the rent and 3 million homeowners are 
in forbearance. At the same time, we 
are on the verge of passing major as-
sistance for renters and for home-
owners. As the incoming Secretary, I 
know Representative FUDGE will imple-
ment that assistance with alacrity. 
And, of course, I will be focusing, 
among other issues in housing, on pub-
lic housing, which I know she cares 
about a great deal as well. 
Later this afternoon, we will move to 
the confirmation of Merrick Garland to 
become Attorney General. After Don-
ald Trump spent 4 years, 4 long years, 
subverting the powers of the Justice 
Department for his own political ben-
efit, treating the Attorney General like 
his own personal defense lawyer, Amer-
ica can breathe a sigh of relief that we 
are finally going to have someone like 
Merrick Garland leading the Justice 
Department, someone with integrity, 
independence, respect for the rule of 
law, and credibility on both sides of the 
aisle. He understands that the job of 
Attorney General is one to protect the 
rule of law, unlike the previous Attor-
neys General under President Trump 
who, too often, just bowed to his whim 
and his will when it was against rule of 
law. 
It is confounding, in light of all of 
that, that Republicans have chosen— 
some of them anyway—to delay his 
nomination, particularly in the after-
math of the Capitol attacks, but he 
will be confirmed today, despite their 
attempts to stonewall the process. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Senate 
will confirm Michael Regan to serve as 
EPA Administrator. Once again, the 
change between the previous adminis-
tration and the incoming Adminis-
trator will be dramatic. Under Donald 
Trump, the EPA weakened environ-
mental protections, fudged the science, 
and completely ignored climate change 
to potentially, unfortunately, disas-
trous effect. 
It is high time the Senate confirmed 
someone like Michael Regan, who has 
made environmental protection the 
cause of his career, to lead the Agency 
and set it back on its proper footing. 
Once we finish with the confirma-
tions of these three nominees, the Sen-
ate will have confirmed 16 Cabinet- 
level officials. That is in addition to 
passing a massive COVID bill and con-
ducting an impeachment trial of the 
former President—despite getting a 
late start to our work thanks to a 
delay in the organizing resolution. The 
Senate is going to keep up the pace.

S1434 
March 10, 2021 
President Biden deserves to have his 
team in place, working for the Amer-
ican people. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the American Rescue Plan, later 
today, the House of Representatives is 
set to approve the American Rescue 
Plan and send it straight to President 
Biden’s desk for his signature, capping 
a monthslong effort by the Democrats 
to pass bold COVID relief to defeat the 
pandemic and boost our economy. Once 
President Biden signs the bill into law, 
it will immediately become the most 
sweeping Federal recovery package in 
recent history. 
Even a cursory reading of the head-
lines gives you a sense of the historic 
nature of this bold and so helpful legis-
lation. 
Here is one from yesterday from the 
New York Times: 
Growth in the U.S. could surge on the 
stimulus plan and a rapid vaccine rollout. 
Wouldn’t that be great? We think 
there is a very good chance of its hap-
pening. 
Forbes: 
U.S. Economy Will Recover Twice as Fast 
Thanks to $1.9 Trillion Stimulus. 
That is from Forbes, a conservative 
publication. 
The Associated Press: 
COVID bill to deliver big health insurance 
savings for many. 
This is something so many Ameri-
cans desperately need and want. 
Here is another from the New York 
Times: 
In the Stimulus Bill, a Policy Revolution 
in Aid for Children. 
A policy revolution. 
Simply put, the American Rescue 
Plan is one of the most significant Fed-
eral relief efforts that Congress has 
seen in a very, very long time. I am 
greatly looking forward to its becom-
ing law. 
Now, I have spent a lot of time talk-
ing about all of the different provisions 
of the bill today and in previous re-
marks on the floor of the Senate. That 
is because the American Rescue Plan is 
a truly comprehensive effort. COVID–19 
has impacted nearly every aspect of 
American life. So we had to craft legis-
lation 
that 
spanned 
the 
gamut: 
schools, 
businesses, 
families, 
jobs, 
healthcare. Because this bill is so wide- 
ranging, I haven’t spent enough time 
on the significance of the individual 
programs. 
I want to rectify that over the next 
several weeks. This morning, I want to 
focus on two initiatives: first, the child 
tax credit and, second, agricultural as-
sistance for disadvantaged farmers. 
According to the most recent data, 
more than 10 million children live 
below the poverty line in America—10 
million children. A child starting out 
in life, through no fault of his or her 
own, lives below the poverty line, and 
we know what that means in terms of 
food and healthcare and housing and 
education. Compared with other na-
tions around the world, the United 
States dedicates a relative pittance—a 
pittance—to fixing that terrible injus-
tice. 
Listen to this. This is something that 
should make us both ashamed that the 
United States has been in this position 
for so long and proud that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan will help rectify that 
injustice. Here it is: The United States 
ranks next to last among the world’s 37 
most developed economies in terms of 
family benefits—barely ahead of Tur-
key—nothing that can make Ameri-
cans proud. 
Of course, the pandemic has made the 
problem of child poverty even worse. It 
has forced parents to serve as childcare 
providers and surrogate teachers while 
trying to keep up with their own jobs. 
For millions of Americans who lost 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own, the pressure only increased. The 
difficulty of childcare during the pan-
demic is likely one of the main reasons 
there has been a disproportionate share 
of women who have fallen out of the 
workforce. 
The 
pandemic 
has 
left 
mothers and fathers with impossible 
choices, between keeping their jobs and 
incomes or leaving work to care for 
their children, stuck at home, whom 
they so dearly love. 
Democrats decided to tackle this 
problem head on in the American Res-
cue Plan. We expanded the child tax 
credit to provide up to $3,000 per child, 
ages 6 to 17, and $3,600 per child under 
the age of 6 for an overwhelming ma-
jority of families in this country. Ana-
lysts predict that this policy will cut 
childhood poverty in half—in half. 
That is an astounding statistic. It will 
cut childhood poverty in half. A goal of 
so many who have studied the frailties 
in some of our policies for a decade, for 
a generation, has been to remove peo-
ple—young children—from poverty, and 
half will be so removed. 
That is just one reason reviewers 
have called the American Rescue Plan 
one of the ‘‘most far-reaching anti-pov-
erty efforts in an [entire] generation.’’ 
A salute to SHERROD BROWN, MICHAEL 
BENNET, and CORY BOOKER, who really 
spearheaded this, along with Congress-
man NEAL in the House; RON WYDEN 
and his committee that worked on 
drafting it; and my staffers who spent 
so much time on making this work as 
well. A salute to them. 
Now, another provision that has re-
ceived too little attention is the sup-
port this bill will provide to disadvan-
taged farmers. Across nearly every sta-
tistic, farmers from socially disadvan-
taged communities fare worse than 
their White counterparts, suffering 
from generations of systemic discrimi-
nation, land loss, and what Secretary 
Vilsack calls a ‘‘cycle of debt.’’ It is al-
most something that recalls the days 
of slavery and sharecropping and ten-
ant farming. Recently, these farmers 
have 
suffered 
again, 
disproportion-
ately, from COVID–19. 
The American Rescue Plan provides 
more than $10 billion to support our 
Nation’s agriculture and sets aside, 
roughly, half of it—half of it—for dis-
advantaged communities, particularly 
Black farmers, for debt relief, edu-
cation, training, and land acquisition. 
Though it is only a small fraction of 
the overall bill, experts have called the 
American Rescue Plan ‘‘the most sig-
nificant legislation for Black farmers 
since the Civil Rights Act.’’ 
It is amazing what we can do when 
we put our minds to it. The hangover 
from the horrible treatment that rural 
African-American farmers have gotten 
since the days of slavery can, in part— 
in decent part—be undone by this legis-
lation. 
I want to thank some of my fellow 
Senators who did such work on this 
bill. The provisions I have mentioned 
owe a great deal to the members of the 
Agriculture Committee and the Fi-
nance Committee. Senator STABENOW 
was relentless in pushing this issue. 
Senator WYDEN, chair of the Finance 
Committee, helped out a great deal, 
and Senators WARNOCK
and BOOKER 
pushed very hard as well. 
The American Rescue Plan is going 
to have an immense impact on nearly 
every community in America. In the 
weeks and months to come, I will be 
highlighting how much good it will do. 
I have a few housekeeping things to 
do.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I voted to advance the nomina-
tions of Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE 
to be the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development and Judge Merrick 
Garland to be Attorney General. 
These aren’t the nominees whom any 
Republican would have picked for these 
jobs, but the Nation needs Presidents 
to be able to stand up a team so long as 
their nominees are qualified and main-
stream. I have voted to confirm people 
like 
Secretaries 
Austin, 
Blinken, 
Yellen, Vilsack, and Buttigieg. We cer-
tainly disagree on plenty of issues, but 
I spent 4 years watching many of our 
Democratic colleagues do everything 
possible to obstruct and delay Presi-
dent Trump’s nominees right from the 
start. 
Now we hear of many of the same 
Democrats insisting that, as a matter 
of principle, a new President needs his 
team and any delay is an outrage. It is 
funny how some things change. My po-
sition has not. 
I am voting to confirm Judge Gar-
land because of his long reputation as a 
straight shooter and a legal expert. His 
left-of-center 
perspective 
has 
been 
within the legal mainstream. 
For the country’s sake, let’s hope our 
incoming Attorney General applies 
that no-nonsense approach to the seri-
ous challenges facing the Department 
of Justice and our Nation. Let’s hope 
that he controls the bureaucrats and 
leftist subordinates that the President 
proposes to place under him, rather 
than the other way around. 
When I spoke to Judge Garland, we 
discussed his commitment to the ongo-
ing investigation of the events of Janu-
ary 6. Federal law enforcement needs 
to continue the work of identifying, ar-
resting, and prosecuting those who 
broke the law in order to disrupt the 
constitutional business of Congress. He 
assured me that will remain a priority. 
At the same time, it is essential that 
DOJ treat political violence with equal 
seriousness no matter which political 
fringe it may come from. Last summer, 
riots, vandalism, and even a so-called 
‘‘autonomous zone’’ consumed parts of 
American cities. In some instances, 
thugs directly attacked Federal prop-
erty. But amazingly, some local leaders 
seemed more willing to tolerate the 
chaos than tolerate the angry tweets 
that leftwing activists might have sent 
if they had stepped in to actually do 
their jobs. 
We were fortunate to have Attorney 
General Barr, who took seriously the 
Federal Government’s role to protect 
Federal property and enforce Federal 
law. Judge Garland must be prepared 
to do the same. 
Of course, the riots haven’t been the 
only area where we have seen liberal 
governance give short shrift to the rule 
of law. The Obama administration was 
famous for its willingness to let ide-
ology dictate the enforcement of Fed-
eral laws or the lack thereof. 
Take the DACA Program, for exam-
ple. When the Obama administration 
realized their preferred immigration 
policies couldn’t get through Congress 
the right way, they stretched prosecu-
torial discretion and law enforcement 
discretion to breathtaking unconstitu-
tional 
extremes. 
When 
confirmed, 
Judge Garland must not back other 
constitutionally corrosive efforts to ef-
fectively repeal laws just by ignoring 
them. 
That brings me to the issue of immi-
gration more broadly. Just a few weeks 
into the job, the Biden administration 
and Secretary Mayorkas are flailing 
and failing on our southern border. The 
number 
of 
unaccompanied 
migrant 
children in Border Patrol custody has 
tripled in just 2 weeks and now dwarfs 
anything seen during the last 4 years. 
Like I mentioned last week, this is 
not an isolated question of border pol-
icy alone. The backdrop behind this en-
tire crisis is the giant push toward am-
nesty and insecurity that the adminis-
tration advertised throughout the cam-
paign and every time they step to the 
podium now. That is what has enticed 
people to flood in. 
Even now, administration staff keeps 
parroting strange lines like ‘‘Now is 
not the time to come.’’ ‘‘Now is not the 
time to come’’? Well, when is the right 
time to break Federal law? Is there 
going to be a good time to break into 
the country illegally, and people need 
to just be patient and wait for their 
signal? What on Earth are they talking 
about? 
A lot of blame for this mess rests on 
Secretary Mayorkas himself. He spent 
the 
first 
weeks 
of 
his 
tenure 
downplaying and denying the crisis in-
stead of solving it. But, again, the 
Biden 
administration’s 
far-left 
ap-
proach to this issue is not limited to 
DHS or to the border. Interior enforce-
ment is a key component. 
On Secretary Mayorkas’ watch, we 
have seen what the Washington Post 
calls ‘‘a sharp drop’’ in arrests by Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement— 
a collapse of more than 60 percent from 
just the prior few months—a political 
choice, in effect, not to enforce the 
law. 
Judge Garland must ensure the De-
partment of Justice takes its duty to 
uphold the law more seriously. 
Mr. President, on a related matter, 
after 
we 
confirm 
Congresswoman 
FUDGE and Judge Garland, the Senate 
will consider two nominees I will not 
be 
supporting. 
They 
both 
report 
straight to the frontlines of the new 
administration’s 
leftwing 
war 
on 
American energy. They would work to 
unbalance the balancing act between 
conservation and the economic come-
back we badly need. 
To head the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, the President has nomi-
nated Michael Regan, a longtime regu-
lator and activist. Mr. Regan has plen-
ty of experience. The problem is what 
he is poised to do with it. He and the 
administration are plainly prepared to 
put that experience behind the same 
far-left policies that crushed jobs and 
prosperity in States like Kentucky 
throughout the Obama administration. 
The Clean Power Plan? Back on the 
table. The absurd waters of the United 
States rule? Back on the table. 
Kentuckians know that when bad 
policies like those are on the table, it 
means their jobs, their livelihoods, and 
their communities are on the menu. 
Congresswoman HAALAND, the Presi-
dent’s pick to lead the Department of 
the Interior, was literally an original 
cosponsor of the Green New Deal. She 
has vowed to ‘‘keep fossil fuels in the 
ground’’ and once pledged ‘‘to vote 
against all new fossil fuel infrastruc-
ture.’’ 
Her record and her views ignore the 
fact that American energy independ-
ence fueled prosperity for the working 
class and middle class over the last 4 
years. Yet in multiple of those years, 
our carbon emissions actually went 
down—went down. The supposed choice 
between a clean environment and do-
mestic energy independence is a false 
choice. It only exists as a zero-sum 
tradeoff in the minds of Democrats. 
We have every reason to believe that 
voting for Mr. Regan and Representa-
tive HAALAND would be voting to raise 
gas prices for families who are already 
struggling, voting to raise fuel and 
heating bills for seniors on a fixed in-
come, voting to take the tough times 
we have been going through and mak-
ing them even tougher. 
I will be voting for American families 
and against both of their nominations.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of MARCIA LOUISE 
FUDGE, of Ohio, to be Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development.

IMMIGRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for 20 
years now, I have come to this floor 
hundreds of times to speak on behalf of 
the DREAM Act, which I introduced 
long ago. During that period of time, I 
have had an occasional vote. I have not 
been successful in making it the law of 
the land. 
The closest I came was about 8 years 
ago, when we had the comprehensive 
immigration reform bill. Four Demo-
cratic Senators and four Republican 
Senators—and I was among them— 
worked for months to try to address 
our immigration system. We came up 
with an agreement that was no mean 
feat. It is a complex area of law. It is 
a controversial area of law. It is an 
area of law that changes almost by the 
day, and we were trying to find a solu-
tion to all the challenges it presents. 
To think that we are a nation of im-
migrants and, then, to reflect on our 
history on immigration is to leave one 
puzzled. 
Most of the time we have been 
against immigration, despite the ar-
rival of good people on our borders. Oc-
casionally, when we were building a 
transcontinental railroad, we would in-
vite people from China in to take the 
backbreaking jobs, only to categori-
cally exclude them from immigration 
in the meantime. It is hard to explain, 
understand, or appreciate where we 
stand on immigration. 
When I hear the Republican leader 
come to the floor and criticize Presi-
dent Obama for DACA, I have to say 
that it is personal to me. I was writing 
letters to President Biden, my former 
Senate colleague from Illinois, begging 
him to do just that, and he did. 
In creating DACA, he gave the 
Dreamers a fighting chance, and more 
than 800,000 of them came forward. 
These were young people who were 
brought to the United States as tod-
dlers and infants and children, not be-
cause of a personal decision but a fam-
ily decision. They grew up here, went 
to school here, and believed they were 
a part of this country, only to learn in 
a quiet moment of honesty from their 
parents that they didn’t have the nec-
essary paperwork and they had to be 
extra careful or face deportation. 
I thought that was a heartbreaking 
conclusion for their time in America 
and introduced the Dream Act. And 
when we could not pass it, I asked 
President Obama to do what he could 
to help, and he did. I thank him for it 
still to this day. 
But DACA, if it was stretching Exec-
utive power, was certainly reflective of 
where the American people are on this 
issue. No apologies; the American peo-
ple don’t hold these young children 
now grown responsible for their fam-
ily’s decision. They want to give them 
a chance. They want to give them a 
chance to earn their legal status, to 
earn a path to citizenship. No apologies 
here; these are wonderful young people 
who make America a better country, 
and we need them to be a part of our 
future. 
So for those who come to the floor 
critical of DACA, I just tell you: Take 
a couple of minutes and meet these 
young people. I have come to the floor 
over a hundred times telling their per-
sonal stories. They are a great source 
of pride, not just for me but for this 
Nation. 
Now we face problems on our bor-
der—and we have for some time—and 
they are challenges that are very real. 
Mr. Mayorkas has taken over as the 
head of the Department of Homeland 
Security. He is a person I willingly and 
anxiously support for that job. He has 
a personal family story of immigra-
tion, but, more importantly, he has a 
depth of experience that is almost im-
possible to find in other places. 
He has tried to come together with 
the leaders in Central America to fash-
ion a plan for order on the border, and 
it is difficult. It is true that larger 
numbers are coming to the border at 
this time. The Senator from Kentucky 
said earlier that they believe they have 
a right to break Federal law. I couldn’t 
disagree with him more. They are pre-
senting themselves at the border under 
the law of asylum in the United States 
so that they can be judged as to wheth-
er or not they are eligible to come into 
this country. That is the process, but it 
has broken down because the numbers 
presenting themselves at the border 
and the backlog of cases, more than a 
million cases pending. 
We don’t have enough judges. We 
don’t have a procedure that is sensible 
and humane. We need all of that, and it 
is not going to happen the day after to-
morrow. Part of it depends on us. It is 
one thing to come to the floor and la-
ment the situation of immigration in 
our country. It is another to roll up 
your sleeves and say: Let’s do it; let’s 
solve it on a bipartisan basis. And it is 
certainly an imperative in a 50–50 Sen-
ate that any immigration legislation 
be done on a bipartisan basis. 
I stand ready to do that as chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, and I 
think colleagues on the Republican 
side agree with me. As tough as it may 
be, we need to tackle these issues and 
not ignore them as they have been ig-
nored during the last 4 years. That is 
going to call for some cooperation and 
some compromise on both sides, but we 
owe it to our country to do the right 
thing to make our immigration system 
sensible, logical, and fair. 
I don’t want to go back to those mo-
ments under the Trump administration 
of zero tolerance, where over 2,000 chil-
dren were forcibly removed from their 
parents, 
sent 
into 
a 
bureaucratic 
‘‘Never Never Land’’ and then were 
only reunited—and not all of them 
have been—those who were reunited 
were because of a Federal court order 
calling on the Trump administration to 
do it. 
They cast those children adrift in the 
bureaucracy. It wasn’t until the Fed-
eral court demanded that they be rein-
stated with their families that it hap-
pened—in most instances but not in all 
of them. So we have a lot of work to 
do, and I hope we can do it on a bipar-
tisan basis. We need to do it as quickly 
as we can on a bipartisan basis. 
56TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY 
Mr. President, I was a college student 
in town here at Georgetown Univer-
sity, and I can remember it well. You 
have a lot of time to talk with your 
roommates about things that you 
might just do with your life and things 
that you should do, even as a student. 
I remember that week before the 
march on Selma, there was a serious 
conversation among my roommates as 
to whether we ought to pack up and 
head to Selma, AL, to join in the 
march. We were serious about it. We 
thought about it, but, in the end, it fell 
through. Too many classes would be 
cut and jobs we wouldn’t be attending 
to, and we decided at the last minute it 
just wasn’t practical at all for us to do 
it. I regret that decision to this day. I 
wish I had been there, even if I were in 
the back of the line, to say I was part 
of that day in history. 
It was 56 years ago last Sunday, some 
600 civil rights activists, 56 years ago, 
were kneeling in prayer outside the 
Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma. 
Leading them was our dearly departed 
friend—and I know he was the Pre-
siding Officer’s friend as well—and 
former colleague John Lewis. As they 
stood up outside the church, they 
formed two rows and began a silent, or-
derly march toward Montgomery, AL. 
We all remember that photo of John 
Lewis coming over that bridge in his 
tan raincoat and his backpack. 
As the civil rights activists reached 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were 
met by a phalanx of State troopers and 
armed vigilantes. They wielded cattle 
prods, billy clubs, shotguns, and other 
makeshift weapons. We all know what 
happened next. Today, that violence is 
remembered as ‘‘Bloody Sunday.’’ 
What some may not know is what 
happened the night before that march. 
The county sheriff in Selma, Jim 
Clark, had issued a call to arms. He or-
dered White men in the area to join 
troopers in Selma, and he deputized 
those people to help stop the march. 
They answered the call, lining up by 
the 
hundreds 
alongside 
the 
State 
troopers. 
John Lewis and his fellow patriots 
were not going to be intimidated. They

March 10, 2021 
stood tall. They bore the brunt of rac-
ist violence, and they did so with a sol-
emn purpose: They wanted to build a 
more perfect union in this country, to 
make sure every voice is heard in our 
democracy. 
Days later, with the brutal scenes 
from Selma fresh in the minds of 
America, President Lyndon Johnson 
urged Congress to pass the Voting 
Rights Act. That August, he signed the 
bill into law. It is hard to imagine, 
isn’t it? In the same year he proposed 
it, we actually saw Congress pass the 
law. That is what happened in the good 
old 
days. 
His 
law 
fundamentally 
changed our Republic for the better, 
but our work remains far from over. 
Last weekend also marked the anni-
versary of another tragic moment in 
our Nation’s history, far more recent 
than Bloody Sunday. It was 2 months 
ago—2 months ago on January 6 that a 
violent mob stormed through the halls 
of this Capitol Building. Like the vigi-
lantes in Selma, they, too, were an-
swering a call to arms—except this one 
wasn’t issued by a county sheriff; it 
was issued by the former President of 
the United States, Donald Trump. The 
failed insurrection of January 6 not 
only left five people dead, but, like 
Bloody Sunday, it left a permanent 
stain on our Nation’s history. 
Make no mistake, no more than half 
a century stands between these two 
dark days for democracy. They are part 
of the same thread that sadly has run 
through American history: racism— 
racism weaponized to deny full citizen-
ship to Black and Brown Americans. 
The mob violence that we personally 
witnessed on January 6 in this building 
was not an aberration; it was the con-
tinuation of a sad chapter in our his-
tory. For months, former President 
Trump had sowed doubt about the le-
gitimacy of the election. He claimed 
that it was stolen from him. ‘‘Stop the 
steal,’’ they chanted. We know that 
President Trump’s claims have no basis 
in reality. Just 2 days ago, the Su-
preme Court finally dismissed the last 
remaining case brought by Trump sup-
porters to push the big lie. The Su-
preme Court didn’t buy it. In fact, no 
court bought it. 
The former President has never let 
facts stand in his way, has he? In fact, 
he claims to know exactly where this 
supposed fraud transpired, cities like 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and 
Detroit—coincidentally, 
cities 
with 
large populations of Black and Brown 
voters. This is no coincidence. Presi-
dent Trump and his enablers believe 
they were entitled to victory because 
they don’t think that every American 
should have an equal vote in our de-
mocracy. 
President Trump’s efforts to over-
turn the election are just the most re-
cent example of a decades-long move-
ment to suppress voters of color. 
I have spoken on this floor before 
about investigations I conducted as 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights and Human rights of the Senate 
Judiciary. I took the show on the road. 
I traveled to Ohio and Florida, where 
lawmakers at that time were consid-
ering making it more difficult to vote, 
requiring IDs, and this was before the 
Supreme Court’s disastrous decision in 
Shelby County. 
That ruling opened the floodgates. It 
allowed a number of State legislatures 
to enact discriminatory restrictions on 
voting that would no longer require ap-
proval from the Department of Justice. 
That decision was a repudiation of the 
sacrifice John Lewis and his fellow pa-
triots made on Bloody Sunday. 
We must learn from our history, 
whether it was 56 years ago or just 2 
months ago, and we must recognize 
that the fundamental right to vote is 
still under attack. Just last week, the 
Supreme Court heard arguments in a 
case that could further fracture the 
Voting Rights Act by limiting the ef-
fectiveness of a provision that allows 
voters to challenge discriminatory re-
strictions. Lawmakers in 43 States 
have already introduced more than 250 
bills this year to restrict voting access. 
This book, ‘‘One Person, No Vote,’’ 
was written by Carol Anderson, a pro-
fessor at Emory University in Atlanta. 
I read her first book, ‘‘White Rage,’’ 
contacted her, and we are friends. I 
think her analysis of Reconstruction, 
Jim Crow, the Great Migration, and all 
that followed is the most lucid presen-
tation I have read about that chapter 
in history. 
In this book, she goes directly into 
the issue of voter suppression. One of 
her observations is worth repeating on 
the floor of the Senate. She refers to 
what is known in history as the Mis-
sissippi Plan. I will read a few sen-
tences from this book, as follows: 
That became most apparent in 1890 when 
the Magnolia State passed the Mississippi 
Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes, literacy 
tests, 
understanding 
clauses, 
newfangled 
voter registration rules, and ‘‘good char-
acter’’ clauses—all intentionally racially 
discriminatory but dressed up in the genteel 
garb of bringing ‘‘integrity’’ to the voting 
booth. This feigned legal innocence was leg-
islative evil genius. 
Virginia representative Carter Glass, like 
so many others, swooned at the thought of 
bringing the Mississippi Plan to his own 
state, especially after he saw how well it had 
worked. He rushed to champion a bill in the 
legislature that would ‘‘eliminate the darkey 
as a political factor . . . in less than five 
years.’’ Glass, whom President Franklin 
Roosevelt would one day describe as an 
‘‘unreconstructed rebel,’’ planned ‘‘not to de-
prive a single white man of the ballot, but 
[to] inevitably cut from the existing elec-
torate four-fifths of the Negro voters’’ in 
Virginia. 
One delegate questioned him: ‘‘Will it not 
be done by fraud and discrimination?’’ 
Glass responded: 
‘‘By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes,’’ 
Glass retorted. ‘‘Discrimination! Why, that 
is precisely what we propose . . . to discrimi-
nate to the very extremity . . . permissible 
. . . under . . . the Federal Constitution, 
with a view to the elimination of every negro 
voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, with-
out materially impairing the numerical 
strength of the white electorate.’’ 
In those days, they were very direct 
and honest about their ambitions in 
voter suppression. What is the expla-
nation these days? 
If we don’t believe that there was 
massive fraud—and there was not, by 
any objective measure—in the 2020 
election, why are so many legislators 
in the business now of reducing the op-
portunity for Americans to vote in 
their States? Why? If they can’t sell an 
idea, they just want to change the elec-
torate, and perhaps that would lead to 
victory, but at what cost? 
The most enduring legacy of Bloody 
Sunday is the legislation that it helped 
to inspire, the Voting Rights Act. We 
must now draw from this moment in 
our history, a lesson to be realized, the 
promise of that legislation: a full and 
vibrant democracy, made up of all 
Americans of every color and creed. 
We have an obligation not just to re-
store the Voting Rights Act but to 
build on it, to make it stronger and 
more 
comprehensive. 
Fortunately, 
President Joe Biden’s administration 
has indicated it is ready to do just 
that. Last Sunday, in honor of the 56th 
anniversary of Bloody Sunday, Presi-
dent Biden signed an Executive order 
calling on the Federal Government to 
make it easier for Americans to reg-
ister to vote and access the ballot box. 
While this Executive order was a wel-
come announcement, we need to act as 
well in Congress. As chair of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee and a cospon-
sor of the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act in the last Congress, I look forward 
to working to restore and strengthen 
the Voting Rights Act in the months 
ahead. 
Though our friend and colleague is no 
longer with us today, his legacy towers 
over us. We stand on his shoulders and 
those of all the American heroes who 
bled on the streets of Selma in 1965 and 
long after. We must carry on the fight 
for equality, and we can begin by en-
acting a bill the House of Representa-
tives passed last week, the For the 
People Act. 
This bill would prohibit voter roll 
purges, as we have seen in States like 
Ohio and Georgia, and modernize and 
strengthen voter registration systems 
and ballot access. 
I would say to the other party: Don’t 
be afraid of the voters. In this democ-
racy, they have the last word. Denying 
them the right to vote is no way and no 
strategy for a great political party. 
It would also help end the dominance 
of dark money in our political system, 
including through establishing a small- 
donor public financing system for con-
gressional elections, based on my Fair 
Elections Now Act. 
The For the People Act is a vital step 
toward repairing and improving our 
democratic process. Passing it and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act will provide critical tools in 
the fight to ensure that all Americans 
can exercise their right to vote. These 
bills represent the bold actions that 
Americans have been calling for. We 
must not ignore that call.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1439 
March 10, 2021 
In 2020, the American people turned 
out in historic numbers in the election, 
but they also turned out in historic 
numbers in protests in support of ra-
cial justice across America. John Lew-
is’s march to Montgomery never ended. 
It has taken on a new life, a new gen-
eration of marchers, and more Ameri-
cans than ever before are putting their 
feet to the pavement. 
It is time to finish the work of John 
Lewis and the heroes of the civil rights 
movement. As we commemorate the 
56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, we 
can do no less. With his eyes wide open, 
John Lewis marched across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma knowing 
he was facing a deadly, hateful crowd. 
They broke down his body, but they 
could not defeat his spirit. The ques-
tion we face today is whether John 
Lewis’s spirit still lives in us. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
TRIBUTE TO ROY BLUNT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I want to take a moment to ex-
press 
my 
sadness 
about 
Senator 
BLUNT’s announcement that he will not 
seek reelection in 2022. 
He has been a leader within our con-
ference ever since he came over to the 
Senate, and he will be sorely missed. I 
will especially miss having him as a 
Member of the whip team here in the 
Senate. 
I came to the House of Representa-
tives with Senator BLUNT back in the 
election of 1996. We began our service 
in January of 1997, and he quickly rose 
up through the ranks in the House and 
became the Republican whip in the 
House of Representatives. He has al-
ways been involved in leadership wher-
ever he has been, and his list of 
achievements is long. 
All Americans have benefited over 
the past year from his tremendous ef-
forts to accelerate coronavirus testing 
and vaccine development. And less 
than 2 months ago, in his role as chair-
man of Rules Committee, he oversaw a 
very successful inauguration at a par-
ticularly challenging time. 
The one good thing is that ROY is not 
leaving us immediately. He will be here 
for 2 more years, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with him and to 
seeing everything that he will accom-
plish. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, it has been quoted 
that ‘‘[t]he Senate works best when we 
work together. . . . The challenges we 
face are great. The divisions in the 
country are real. We have no choice 
but to try to work together every day 
to reward the faith the American peo-
ple have placed in us.’’ 
Those are not my words. Those are 
the words of the Democratic leader on 
Inauguration Day. But I agree with 
him. The Senate does indeed work best 
when we work together. And, for proof, 
look no further than last week’s deba-
cle—a good example of what happens 
when, instead of working together, one 
party tries to strong-arm its legisla-
tion through the Senate. 
Last Friday was perhaps most nota-
ble for its 11-plus-hour vote on an 
amendment. Democrats held a 15- 
minute vote open for almost 12 hours— 
making it the longest vote in modern 
Senate history—because it had become 
clear that they were in danger of losing 
the support of one of their Members. 
It turns out that when you force a 
massive, liberal piece of legislation 
through the Senate without committee 
review and without any attempt at so-
liciting input from the Senate as a 
whole, you start to lose support even 
from Members of your own party. It 
was an embarrassing moment for the 
Democrat leadership and a sad moment 
for the rest of the Senate. 
In that same speech on Inauguration 
Day, the Democratic leader pledged: 
[The] Senate will legislate. . . . And to my 
Republican colleagues, when and where we 
can, the Democratic majority will strive to 
make this important work bipartisan. 
There was no evidence of that here. 
Democrats didn’t try to make this bill 
bipartisan. In fact, they actively tried 
to make sure Republicans didn’t have a 
voice in this legislation. 
Remember 
that 
almost 
12-hour 
amendment vote? Democrats held that 
vote open for nearly 12 hours solely be-
cause they were afraid that a Repub-
lican amendment might pass. Repub-
licans were more than willing to work 
with Democrats on COVID relief, as we 
did last year on five separate COVID 
bills, but Democrats didn’t want Re-
publicans interfering with their legis-
lation. 
I want to talk about those previous 
COVID bills for just a minute. Prior to 
Democrats taking control of the Sen-
ate, COVID relief was a bipartisan 
process. Under Republican control, the 
Senate passed five COVID relief bills 
with overwhelming bipartisan majori-
ties. Because both Democrats and Re-
publicans had a voice in the legisla-
tion, there was no need to keep any of 
those votes open to engage in partisan 
arm-twisting. ‘‘The Senate works best 
when it works together.’’ 
The bipartisan process on those other 
COVID bills didn’t just guarantee a bi-
partisan vote in the Senate; it also 
guaranteed that those other COVID 
bills were actually about COVID. Be-
cause both parties had to work to-
gether to get a result, neither party 
was able to hijack the bill for partisan 
purposes. 
Contrast that with the bill the Sen-
ate passed on Saturday. While Demo-
crats have tried to sell their legislation 
as a COVID relief bill, the truth is it 
isn’t one. Just 1 percent—1 percent—of 
this bill actually goes to our top 
COVID 
priority—vaccinations—and 
less than 10 percent of this bill is di-
rectly related to combating the virus. 
There has been a lot of talk about 
how this bill is a liberal wish list, 
which it is, but that is almost being 
too generous. A liberal wish list at 
least 
suggests 
some 
grand 
policy 
schemes. This bill is mostly just a col-
lection of payoffs to Democrat interest 
groups in Democrat States. 
For the extreme abortion wing of the 
Democratic Party, this bill omits long-
standing Federal restriction on using 
taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion. It 
makes labor unions eligible for loans 
designed to rescue Main Street small 
businesses. It bails out failing union 
pensions—a bailout even the New York 
Times describes as having ‘‘nothing to 
do with the pandemic’’ and as an ‘‘al-
most unheard-of’’ use of taxpayer dol-
lars. That is from the New York Times. 
It provides nearly $129 billion for K– 
12 schools—despite the fact that these 
schools have spent just $5 billion of the 
$68 billion already given to them— 
while keeping teachers unions happy 
by making sure funding isn’t tied to 
any requirement to actually get back 
to in-person instruction. 
Then, of course, there is the money 
for the States. The bill appropriates a 
staggering $350 billion for States, de-
spite the fact that a majority of States 
already have the resources they need 
to weather the rest of the pandemic. 
On top of that, the distribution for-
mula for that $350 billion is heavily 
weighted in favor of blue States, like 
California, which stands to see $27 bil-
lion under this legislation, despite the 
fact that California’s revenues are up 
by $15 billion. Now, imagine the outcry 
if Republicans were directing funding 
to States that voted Republican in the 
last election. 
And lest anyone thinks any of this 
was unintentional, Democrats doubled 
down on the partisanship when it came 
to 
amendments. 
They 
rejected 
an 
amendment that would have protected 
Americans from having their tax dol-
lars used to pay for abortions, even 
though 
multiple 
Democrats 
broke 
ranks with their party to support this 
amendment. 
They rejected an amendment to tie 
funding for schools to schools that ac-
tually are reopening. They rejected an 
amendment to ensure seamless support 
to nonpublic schools serving low-in-
come 
students. 
They 
rejected 
an 
amendment to stop labor unions from 
taking loan money intended for small 
businesses. They rejected an amend-
ment to provide greater transparency 
on nursing home COVID deaths, pre-
sumably in an attempt to protect the 
Democratic Governor of New York, 
who is under fire for seemingly delib-
erate attempts to obscure reporting of 
these deaths. 
In a nod to the far-left environmental 
wing of the party, they rejected an 
amendment to reverse the President’s 
cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipe-
line, which will cost thousands—thou-
sands of American jobs. 
I could go on for a while on amend-
ments because there are a lot more. 
Democrats 
passed 
an 
amendment 
that provides an incentive for some 
Americans to stay on unemployment 
by making more than $10,000 of their 
unemployment 
benefits 
nontaxable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1440 
March 10, 2021 
Think about that. More than $10,000 of 
their 
unemployment 
benefits 
is 
untaxable without regard to income. 
Working Americans still have to pay 
their taxes, even if they are making 
less money than they would on unem-
ployment. If you are a hard-working 
taxpayer in this country and you are 
not getting a tax break when the peo-
ple who are on unemployment are get-
ting a $10,000 tax break, nontaxable in-
come that is costing the Federal Gov-
ernment somewhere on the order of $30 
billion, you can imagine the average 
taxpayer in this country might find 
that to be highly objectionable when 
they find out about it. A substantial 
amount of unemployment benefits will 
be tax-free. That doesn’t seem too fair, 
not to mention that the last thing we 
should be doing right now is discour-
aging people from going back to work. 
In that speech I referenced earlier 
that the Democratic leader gave on In-
auguration Day, he said: 
As the majority changes in the Senate, the 
Senate will do business differently. 
‘‘The Senate will do business dif-
ferently.’’ Well, now we have a glimpse 
of what that looks like. And, appar-
ently, it looks like ruthless partisan-
ship in an attempt to completely si-
lence the minority and the Americans 
they 
represent. 
It 
is 
deeply 
dis-
appointing that Democrats have turned 
a bipartisan process into a totally par-
tisan exercise. 
As I mentioned, pandemic relief 
ought to be bipartisan, and it was last 
year, five times. Five times here in the 
U.S. Senate, we passed pandemic relief, 
coronavirus 
relief 
legislation, 
with 
overwhelming 
bipartisan 
majorities 
under regular order, where 60 votes are 
required, instead of under the proce-
dure that was used by the Democrats 
last week to shut Republicans out of 
that process. 
We could have passed a bill last week 
again with overwhelming bipartisan 
support, but that would have required 
Democrats to be willing to genuinely 
collaborate with Republicans. And, un-
fortunately, it is becoming clear that 
collaboration is not part of the new 
way of doing business in the Demo-
cratic-led Senate. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
change course in the days ahead and 
work with Republicans to unite our 
country. As the Democratic leader sug-
gested on Inauguration Day, they owe 
the American people nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose 
President Biden’s Executive orders on 
immigration. 
Now, there are more than 11 million 
illegal immigrants in the country 
today. This is a group equivalent to the 
population of the entire State of Geor-
gia, and this number has nearly tripled 
in the last 30 years. In fact, some ex-
perts say the number is a lot higher 
than that. Folks at Yale and MIT and 
the researchers there said it could ac-
tually be twice as high; it could be 22 
million people in the country illegally. 
Well, that is more than the population 
of the entire State of New York. 
So it appears to me that illegal im-
migration is making a mockery of our 
borders. Yet President Biden and this 
administration refuse to admit, even as 
of this morning, that there is a crisis 
at the southern border. 
Now, if you talk to law enforcement 
all across the country, they will tell 
you that many of the problems that 
they face every day are problems re-
lated to our open southern border. The 
Drug Enforcement Administration has 
said for nearly a decade now that the 
vast majority of illegal drugs in Amer-
ica come here across the southern bor-
der. 
Now, I am a doctor. I will tell you, 
these drugs have killed thousands of 
Americans. They kill thousands of 
Americans every year. They tear fami-
lies apart. They lead to heartbreaking 
stories. They rob people of their God- 
given potential. 
Our law enforcement, our Coast 
Guard, our border agents, they do he-
roic work every day to intercept drugs, 
to stop human trafficking. They can’t 
do it alone. They need the support of 
the U.S. Senate. 
Well, during the debate last week 
over the spending bill, we had a chance 
to give them support. Senator CRUZ in-
troduced an amendment to prevent 
checks from going to illegal immi-
grants. Democrats blocked it. Senator 
COTTON introduced an amendment to 
cut the bailout funding to sanctuary 
cities. Well, these are cities that ac-
tively try to prevent Federal agents— 
actively try to prevent Federal agents 
from enforcing our immigration laws. 
Democrats blocked the amendment. 
So no wonder we have a crisis at the 
border. Democrats seem to be adver-
tising to the entire world: Come here 
now. If you come here illegally, you 
can get a check, possibly. 
If you are an immigration enforce-
ment officer, Democrats seem to block 
them from doing their own job. Presi-
dent Biden has already issued at least 
seven Executive orders on immigra-
tion. In just over a month in office, 
President Biden has already proven to 
be the most open-border President in 
U.S. history. 
Now we face an entirely predictable 
crisis at the border. That crisis rests 
squarely at President Biden’s feet. On 
his first day in office, President Biden 
shut down construction of the southern 
border wall. By the time the day was 
over, President Biden stopped all de-
portations for a hundred days. It didn’t 
matter to President Biden what you 
were going to be deported for. No. Now, 
maybe you are a serious criminal. 
President Biden says: You can stay 
longer. A court has already stepped in 
and said this is illegal, this Executive 
order. 
President Biden has, astonishingly, 
brought back the idea of catch-and-re-
lease—catch-and-release. He has or-
dered our immigration agents to re-
lease 
illegal 
immigrants 
into 
the 
United States, and he is doing it in the 
middle of a pandemic. Senator COTTON 
and I sent a letter to the President 
raising this concern. It is now harder 
to go to church in some parts of Amer-
ica than it is to cross the border into 
America. 
Under President Trump, if you want-
ed to apply for asylum in this country, 
you had to remain in Mexico. That was 
the policy. The policy of ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ was based on the standards of 
international law. To get asylum, you 
have to show that you can’t live safely 
in your home country because of perse-
cution—understandable. Yet the fact is 
that most illegal immigrants don’t 
come here because of persecution. They 
come here for economic reasons. They 
want a better job. They want better 
schools for their kids. They are under-
standable motives; nonetheless, they 
are not standards for asylum. 
Now, another requirement for asylum 
is that you have to go to the nearest 
safe country and seek asylum. You 
don’t get to pick anywhere you want to 
go in the world. You have to go to the 
nearest 
safe 
country. 
Yet 
people 
around the world know that our asy-
lum system here in the United States 
has become a sham. It is no secret that 
it is easy to game the system, and it is 
being gamed regularly in the Biden ad-
ministration. 
So they often stop in at least one 
other safe country, and they apply for 
asylum here. President Biden now says: 
You don’t have to wait in Mexico. 
Cross the border. We will give you a 
court date years from now, years from 
now, and after they give you the court 
date, they release you into the United 
States. Even those who know they 
don’t qualify and will not qualify for 
asylum, they come anyway because 
they know they get released into the 
United States. It happens all the time. 
Just before the new administration 
took over, the Department of Home-
land Security published a report about 
this. According to the Department, our 
border agents apprehended 3.5 million 
illegal immigrants along the southern 
border between 2014 and 2019. Only 8 
percent of them—only 8 percent, 1 out 
of 12—ended up receiving legal protec-
tion from being deported, but the De-
partment says half of them are still 
here in the United States. How does 
that happen? They didn’t show up. 
President Biden has also started an 
unprecedented expansion of the refugee 
program. The most refugees that this 
country has ever resettled in a single

year was 85,000 in President Obama’s 
final year in office. President Biden 
wants to break the record. He wants to 
increase it to 125,000. It will be the 
most, by far. 
President Biden has told his adminis-
tration to bring back the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals, also known 
as DACA. Now, this is a program for 
people who were brought here illegally 
while they were children. It is not the 
children’s fault. Yet DACA is illegal, 
plain and simple. 
President Obama has admitted it. 
Liberal activists asked him to do it. At 
least 
10 
different 
times 
President 
Obama said: No, I can’t do it. It is ille-
gal. Then an election year came. He de-
cided to do it anyway. 
As you and I know, we are a nation of 
compassionate people. We are giving. 
We are generous. We have the most 
generous immigration system in the 
world. The issue before us is one that 
should be handled by Congress, not by 
Executive order—not through an ille-
gal Executive order, and DACA is still 
illegal. I expect a court will ultimately 
strike it down. 
So this is some of what President 
Biden has done by Executive order. At 
the same time, he is trying to cram an 
even more radical agenda through Con-
gress. Last month, President Biden’s 
immigration bill was introduced in the 
Senate. It already has the support of 26 
cosponsors on the Democratic side of 
the aisle. It includes the majority lead-
er, Senator SCHUMER. 
Well, this bill will give illegal immi-
grants not just amnesty, citizenship— 
citizenship. Democrats in Washington 
tried that in 2007, the year I arrived in 
the 
Senate. 
The 
American 
people 
picked up the phone. They actually 
shut down the phone lines, shut down 
the switchboards here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. They were all calling in to say no. 
Democrats in Washington tried it 
again in 2013. The American people 
picked up the phone again. The Amer-
ican people said no. And we said no in 
the Senate. We said no in 2007, no in 
2013. The American people are going to 
say no again in 2021. 
Now, President Biden has issued, 
signed a lot of Executive orders; many 
of them, the ones I talked about with 
people at home this weekend in Wyo-
ming, very unpopular. Polls show his 
immigration order is the most unpopu-
lar of them all. 
President Biden should keep in mind 
that it was a very close election in No-
vember. We have a 50–50 Senate, very 
narrow margins in the House. The 
American people, for the first time, are 
finding out just how liberal Joe Biden 
is. Many of them are already having 
buyer’s remorse. They didn’t believe he 
would be this radical and his actions 
would be this scary. 
President Biden needs to listen to the 
American people. The American people 
don’t want a radical, extreme, dan-
gerous, scary agenda. We want safe 
communities. We want laws obeyed. We 
want a secure border. It is time to 
stand up to this radical agenda. 
Our immigration system is broken. 
Instead of breaking it further, we 
should work together to fix it. Let’s 
protect our communities, protect our 
American workers, and secure our 
southern border. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MERRICK BRIAN GARLAND 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today 
the Senate will vote on Judge Merrick 
Garland’s nomination to be Attorney 
General of the United States. I will op-
pose this nomination. I was open-mind-
ed at first about Judge Garland’s nomi-
nation. He has long had a reputation as 
a fair-minded judge. But since being 
nominated, my confidence in Judge 
Garland has been undermined—first, by 
his evasive, haughty refusal to answer 
some of the most basic questions we 
would expect from an Attorney Gen-
eral, the kind of evasion he would 
never allow in his own courtroom, so 
why should we allow it in the U.S. Sen-
ate? And, second, when he did answer 
questions, he sounded more like a lib-
eral ideologue who had embraced the 
radical agenda of the Democratic Par-
ty’s far-left base. 
If confirmed, I am afraid that he will 
enable extremists in the Department of 
Justice to undermine our police, our 
Constitution, and our rule of law. This 
weak-on-crime nominee will fan the 
flames of our Nation’s drug crisis, bor-
der crisis, and violent crime crisis. And 
he has made clear that on the greatest 
challenges facing the Department, he 
will cede the reins to the radical, far- 
left culture warriors that President 
Biden has nominated to be some of his 
top deputies. Our Nation simply cannot 
afford Judge Garland as our Attorney 
General. 
In the last 12 months on record, over 
83,000 
Americans 
died 
from 
drug 
overdoses, more than any year in his-
tory. 
Drug 
overdoses 
killed 
more 
Americans in a single year than the 
Vietnam war and the War on Terror 
combined. Yet Judge Garland plans to 
reduce prison sentences for drug deal-
ers, traffickers, and gang members. 
Judge Garland appears to believe 
that these merchants of misery engage 
in a victimless trade, but virtually 
every family and community in our 
Nation bears the scars that prove oth-
erwise. Whether it is the disabled child, 
addicted parent, suffering sibling, re-
covering neighbor, or deceased friend, 
the victims of drug crime are every-
where we look. Drug traffickers are 
hardly engaged in a nonviolent offense. 
Their practice is intimidation; their 
product is poison; and their customer 
service is the barrel of a gun. With 
Judge Garland as Attorney General, 
these criminals will go free. Their busi-
ness will boom, and the violence and 
death in our streets will continue. 
It is not just fentanyl and heroin 
driving this crisis anymore. In the 
wake of weakening our drug trafficking 
laws under ill-advised laws like the 
First Step Act, drug overdose deaths 
are linked to other drugs as well, like 
cocaine, which is sharply increasing. 
Cocaine is now outpacing heroin as a 
leading cause of drug overdoses, and 
meth is outpacing both. Judge Garland 
will release these criminals back onto 
the streets in the middle of the worst 
drug epidemic in our Nation’s history. 
These pain profiteers don’t deserve le-
niency and should be kept far away 
from the communities they have vic-
timized. Many should, frankly, count 
themselves lucky that they are not 
charged with murder. 
And while Judge Garland endorses 
President Biden’s call for racial eq-
uity—not equality, but equity—Judge 
Garland’s agenda will hurt vulnerable 
minority communities most of all. 
Drug overdose deaths disproportion-
ately affect minority communities, as 
does violent crime. Judge Garland’s 
confirmation, like the confirmation of 
some of his top deputies, would be a 
gift to the cartels, street gangs, and 
drug trafficking networks that perpet-
uate violence and the destruction we 
see in our streets. And even those who 
want the government to go easier on 
drug 
dealers 
and 
drug 
traffickers 
should be concerned about Judge Gar-
land’s stated plan to dismantle manda-
tory minimum sentences for drug traf-
fickers. In addition to deterrence, one 
important justification for creating 
sentence ranges was to reduce racial 
disparities in how minority drug traf-
fickers were sentenced. 
But 
Judge 
Garland 
doesn’t 
stop 
there. 
He 
also 
supports 
President 
Biden’s extreme open borders amnesty 
agenda. At Judge Garland’s confirma-
tion hearing, he was asked if entering 
the country illegally should be a crime. 
You would think that would be a very 
simple question. But Judge Garland re-
sponded 
that 
he 
hadn’t 
‘‘thought 
about’’ it—hadn’t ‘‘thought about’’ it. 
It stretches the bounds of belief that a 
Federal judge who has been on the 
bench for almost a quarter century 
hadn’t thought about that question—or 
that any American with common sense 
who believes in our borders and be-
lieves 
in 
our 
sovereignty 
hadn’t 
thought whether it should be a crime 
to cross our border illegally. But, to 
give him the benefit of the doubt, I 
asked, in a written question after the 
hearing—had nearly a week to think 
about it; it seems like it is a pretty 
easy research question: Should ille-
gally entering our country be a crime? 
And he said, conveniently, even then, 
that he hadn’t thought about it. Judge 
Garland also refused to say whether il-
legal alien gang members or illegal 
aliens who have assaulted U.S. citizens 
should be deported if a judge orders it. 
Judge Garland’s silence shows that 
he will, at best, meekly abide by the

March 10, 2021 
administration’s irrational immigra-
tion agenda. He will help transform 
zero tolerance into total tolerance of 
crime, and his inaction will only fur-
ther advance the administration’s re-
cruit-and-release policies at our bor-
der, where we don’t just allow illegal 
aliens into our country after catching 
them at the border; we go back and 
find them in Mexico and invite them to 
return to the border and then release 
them into the country. 
This will attract an ever-growing 
surge of illegal migration and will re-
sult in more drugs and criminal aliens 
entering our country, as we see with 
the Biden border crisis growing worse 
every day. 
Of course, the vast majority of meth, 
heroin, and cocaine—and a large quan-
tity of fentanyl—is smuggled across 
the southern border each year. As our 
border facilities and personnel are 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
Biden 
border 
surge, our security will falter and even 
more drugs will pour into our Nation. 
Hardened criminals will accompany 
the flood of drugs from the Rio Grande. 
Thousands of confirmed and suspected 
gang members cross the southern bor-
der into our country, and even more 
will exploit the open border policies 
that Judge Garland will have a hand in 
creating. This will fuel skyrocketing 
violence in our Nation. 
Last year, we experienced the largest 
single increase in murder in American 
history—the largest single increase in 
murders in our country’s history. Pre-
liminary data from the FBI indicates 
that there was a 20-percent increase— 
20-percent increase—in murder nation-
wide. In big cities, it was even worse. 
Murders rose in Atlanta by 60 percent; 
in Chicago, by 50 percent; in New York 
City, by 45 percent; and in Washington, 
DC, by 40 percent. There were also, I 
would add, over 500 violent riots last 
year that injured over 2,000 law en-
forcement officers. 
Our police need our support more 
than ever before, but they wouldn’t get 
it from a Garland Department of Jus-
tice. Personnel is policy, and Judge 
Garland has allowed two leftwing radi-
cals to be selected as his chief lieuten-
ants in the Department of Justice. 
Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke both 
support defunding, disarming, and de-
faming our police. They stand with the 
perpetrators of crime, not with the vic-
tims of it. There is little doubt that 
Judge Garland would empower these 
leftwing radicals embedded inside the 
Department. 
In response to written questions from 
the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gar-
land also responded with some vari-
ation of ‘‘I don’t know’’; ‘‘I haven’t 
studied the issue’’; ‘‘I am not famil-
iar’’; ‘‘I haven’t thought about it’’; ‘‘I 
am not aware of,’’ or refused to com-
ment altogether over 250 times. Again, 
this is a sitting Federal judge of almost 
a quarter century with a vast retinue 
of the country’s best lawyers at his dis-
posal for a week to answer written 
questions, 
and 
over 
250 
times 
he 
couldn’t answer the question. That was 
more than one-third of the colleagues— 
or more than one-third of the questions 
that I and my colleagues asked him. 
Judge Garland may not have thought 
about these questions or thought about 
how to run the Justice Department, 
but I bet Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke 
have, and they will gladly fill this void 
of purpose with their radical ideology. 
The Garland Justice Department will 
make America less safe. 
At the same time, Judge Garland 
would work to weaken our Second 
Amendment. At his hearing, he repeat-
edly refused to explain how he would 
deal with the Second Amendment. 
While he acknowledged accurately that 
it would be tough to overturn the Su-
preme Court’s ruling in Washington, 
DC, v. Heller, which affirmed Ameri-
cans’ constitutional right to keep and 
bear arms, he said that he ‘‘can’t prom-
ise’’—he 
‘‘can’t 
promise’’—that 
he 
won’t try to overturn it. He also said 
he just doesn’t know whether President 
Biden has the authority to ban certain 
semiautomatic rifles, some of the most 
popular sporting firearms today. He 
doesn’t know if President Biden has 
the authority to ban them by Execu-
tive order. He has also said he is just 
not familiar with whether the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex-
plosives—which would report to him if 
he is confirmed, I would remind every-
one—would have the authority to in-
definitely delay approving gun sales to 
Americans who have not had any flags 
show up in their background checks. 
Once 
again, 
Judge 
Garland 
dem-
onstrated through his evasion that he 
would bow to the radical left to the 
detriment of normal law-abiding Amer-
ican citizens. 
I urge every Senator who believes in 
the Second Amendment and the rule of 
law and who cares about stopping 
crime in our streets to reject Judge 
Merrick Garland’s nomination for At-
torney General. 
Now is not the time for weakness, 
evasion, and obfuscation from our Na-
tion’s foremost law enforcement offi-
cer. We need strength, resolve, and cer-
tainty. Our Nation needs and deserves 
a better nominee for Attorney General. 
I will oppose his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF MARCIA LOUISE FUDGE 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
this morning to oppose the nomination 
of Representative FUDGE to serve as 
the Secretary of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
The confirmation of Cabinet Secre-
taries is one of the most important 
constitutional functions we have here 
in the Senate. I think most of my col-
leagues would agree that one of the im-
portant considerations is that Cabinet 
officials can be relied on to coordinate 
and work productively with Congress 
as they implement the policies of the 
legislation that we pass. 
I am concerned that Representative 
FUDGE’s past rhetoric makes clear that 
she lacks the temperament to collabo-
rate with Congress, particularly across 
the aisle with Republican Members, 
and her comments cast doubt on 
whether she even wants to. 
Congresswoman 
FUDGE
has 
made 
multiple statements throughout the 
years attacking and disparaging the in-
tegrity and motives of Republicans 
with whom she has policy disagree-
ments. Policy disagreements are en-
tirely understandable. It is reasonable. 
They happen every day. They are ex-
pected, especially in a legislative body. 
But consistently attacking the integ-
rity and motives of people with whom 
you have these disagreements is an-
other thing all together. 
In September 2020, during a speech on 
the House floor, Congresswoman FUDGE 
attacked efforts to fill Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme 
Court. In her speech, she said, among 
other insults, that Senate Republicans 
had ‘‘no decency,’’ ‘‘no honor,’’ ‘‘no in-
tegrity.’’ She went on to say, referring 
to Republican Senators, that we ‘‘are a 
disgrace to the Nation.’’ 
In June 2020, during a virtual town-
hall, Congresswoman FUDGE admitted 
believing that Republicans did not care 
about minorities. She said that if Re-
publicans ‘‘want to save face and let 
this country know that they care even 
a little bit about people of color, which 
I don’t believe they do, but if they 
want to try, I want to listen.’’ 
Back in a January of 2013 PBS forum 
with Tavis Smiley, Congresswoman 
FUDGE harshly questioned the motives 
and character of Republicans again, 
this time Republicans who supported 
cuts to the food stamps program. 
Congresswoman FUDGE said: 
If we continue to send people to Congress 
who don’t even understand what their job 
is—who don’t understand that government’s 
job is to take care of its people—then we are 
never going anywhere as a country because 
we deal with nuts every single day. These 
people are evil and mean. They care nothing 
about anybody but themselves. And so if you 
think you are going to have something bi-
partisan, you need to think again. It’s not 
happening. 
Overtly partisan attacks on integrity 
and motive simply have a toxic and 
detrimental impact on the working re-
lationship that ought to be a construc-
tive relationship between Members of 
Congress and members of the adminis-
tration. The Senate should really only 
confirm officers who are willing to co-
operate with legislators, especially now 
when we have rapid expansion of many 
government programs—we just passed 
a $2 trillion bill that is probably going 
to pass the House and be signed by the 
President—and it is especially true for 
the administrator of HUD. 
In addition to her recent statements 
impugning the integrity and motives of 
Republicans, 
Congresswoman 
FUDGE 
has very little or no housing experi-
ence. Except for her service as a 
smalltown 
mayor, 
Congresswoman 
FUDGE
never worked in a capacity 
where she would be familiar with any 
of HUD’s many programs. Even tradi-
tionally liberal media outlets criticized

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1443 
March 10, 2021 
Congresswoman FUDGE’s nomination 
for HUD Secretary on the grounds that 
she lacked knowledge and experience 
in housing policy. 
She did not show an interest in devel-
oping housing policy expertise as a 
Member of Congress, introducing or co-
sponsoring very few housing-related 
bills and choosing instead to serve on 
unrelated committees. I acknowledge 
that not all Cabinet nominees are ex-
perts in the policy areas that their 
Agencies cover. That is not unusual. 
But when they don’t have that exper-
tise, it is especially important that 
their temperament and their policy 
views—and their willingness to listen 
to Members of Congress on both sides 
of the aisle, especially the other side of 
the aisle, is all the more important. 
Congresswoman FUDGE’s views as re-
flected in her response to questions for 
the record are also a matter of concern. 
When she was asked whether HUD 
should better target its programs so 
that they are actually helping the low- 
income Americans they are supposed to 
help, she responded by saying, ‘‘The 
challenge for HUD programs isn’t that 
they aren’t targeted, it is that funding 
levels are inadequate to meet the 
need.’’ 
The fact is, funding for HUD spending 
has 
grown 
dramatically 
in 
recent 
years. That is not even including the 
$15 billion for COVID assistance that 
the Senate appropriated and worked 
on, and it is not including the $56 bil-
lion for housing assistance passed in 
the December omnibus and the rec-
onciliation bill. 
The Congresswoman’s answer ignores 
the fact that HUD programs certainly 
can be better targeted to help those in 
need. For example, families with dis-
qualifying high incomes nevertheless 
participate in a number of HUD-as-
sisted rental programs, and that makes 
housing unavailable for lower income 
families for whom it is meant. FHA in-
sures mortgages for home buyers who 
could access mortgage credit through 
private capital, also thereby making it 
less available for people who really 
need it. 
So I worry that Congresswoman 
FUDGE’s approach will simply be to ask 
Congress for ever more money without 
being willing to do the hard work of 
making the reforms that are necessary 
and working with Republican Senators 
to achieve those reforms. Those re-
forms are going to be necessary if we 
are going to ensure that HUD programs 
are improved so they actually better 
serve the low-income Americans they 
are meant for. 
For these reasons, I cannot support 
Congresswoman FUDGE’s nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the candor of my colleague from 
Pennsylvania and the work that we do 
jointly on the Committee on Housing 
and Urban Affairs. 
I ask unanimous consent to finish if 
I go a bit over and if my remarks con-
tinue into the next section or, poten-
tially, the vote. 
Have I said that right, Mr. President? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. BROWN. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting a dedicated and 
talented public servant and great Ohi-
oan, my Congresswoman for the last 12 
years, MARCIA FUDGE, to be our next 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment. The Presiding Officer served 
with her in the House of Representa-
tives and appreciates her. 
I can think no one better to lead us 
out of this pandemic and create strong 
communities 
for 
the 
future 
than 
MARCIA FUDGE. When she came before 
the Banking and Housing Committee, 
Congresswoman 
FUDGE’s 
knowledge 
and passion for service and her com-
mitment to the people who make this 
country work were obvious to all of us, 
Republicans and Democrats alike. 
After a year when Black Americans 
endured so many painful reminders of 
the yawning gap between the promise 
of our founding ideals and our failure 
to make that promise real for every-
one, it is meaningful that our commit-
tee’s first nomination hearing featured 
two African-American women who will 
take leading roles in our economic re-
covery, MARCIA FUDGE and Dr. Cecilia 
Rouse, who has been confirmed already 
to be Chair of the National Economic 
Council at the White House. The Sen-
ate confirmed Dr. Rouse with broad bi-
partisan support this month. 
It matters on so many levels. It is 
important for our future that little 
girls, including Black and Brown girls, 
see themselves in our leaders, from the 
Vice President to MARCIA FUDGE, to 
Cecilia Rouse, to so many people in 
this Cabinet, including the new Sec-
retary of the Interior from the Pre-
siding Officer’s area of the country. It 
matters because of perspectives and 
life experience these two Black women 
bring to these jobs. 
Congresswoman FUDGE will lead an 
Agency that supports families and 
communities, provides housing and 
safety to people experiencing homeless-
ness, and it helps communities rebuild. 
Today, HUD is grappling with a hous-
ing market where millions of families 
find it harder and harder to afford a de-
cent home. New data out this week 
confirms that home prices are soaring 
around the country even while millions 
are out of work. Imagine that. The cost 
of housing is up, but wages are flat. So 
many workers have trouble making 
rent every month, with the kind of 
stress that brings and too often having 
to turn to predatory loans. The dream 
of home ownership is increasingly out 
of reach for too many families in New 
Mexico and too many families in Ohio. 
None of this started with COVID–19. 
The affordable housing crisis is the 
product of decades of conscious policy 
decisions by Wall Street, corporations, 
and too often by government. This pan-
demic has exposed what millions of 
families in this country already knew: 
that for far too many people, a hard 
day’s work doesn’t pay the bills. 
Before the United States ever had its 
first case of COVID–19, one-quarter— 
listen to this—one-quarter of all rent-
ers of this country spent more than 
half their income on housing, on rent. 
If one thing happened in their life— 
their car broke down, their child got 
sick, they had a workplace injury that 
caused them to miss work for a week— 
any of those things and their life turns 
upside down. HUD should play an es-
sential role in fixing that. 
We know that the Black home owner-
ship rate was nearly as low as it was in 
1968 when Senator ROMNEY’s father be-
came Secretary of HUD and the work 
he tried to do in opening housing in 
1969. We have made little or almost no 
progress in the Black home ownership 
rate. I am confident that soon-to-be 
Secretary FUDGE will change that. She 
understands the importance of expand-
ing opportunity to every ZIP Code, al-
lowing more families to have the peace 
of mind that brings. 
Here is what I know about ZIP Codes. 
I am in Congresswoman FUDGE’s dis-
trict. My wife and I live in ZIP Code 
44105 in Cleveland. That ZIP Code, in 
2007, the first half of that year, had 
more foreclosures than any city in the 
United States of America. I still see 
the residue, the remains of what has 
happened because of all those fore-
closures. 
Congresswoman FUDGE will work to 
protect our kids from the lead poi-
soning that is still all too common in 
ZIP Code 44105, to restore the promise 
of fair housing, and to give commu-
nities the help and the resources they 
need to thrive. 
She brings to the job critical experi-
ence, as Senator TOOMEY said, serving 
as a mayor in the industrial heartland 
for the kind of community that is ei-
ther overlooked or outright preyed 
upon by Wall Street and big investors. 
Even though Senator TOOMEY said 
that Congresswoman FUDGE
doesn’t 
have the experience in housing, I know 
up close—I was the Senator during her 
entire time in the House. I represented 
her in the Senate. We live in the same 
community. We worked on many of the 
same projects. She was helpful on a 
number of housing issues that I worked 
on in the Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs Committee. She understands 
our communities. 
She will lift up the voices of all the 
people left out of our housing policy, 
people who work hard to try to keep a 
roof over their family’s head, whose 
hard work never pays off like it should; 
people who are just trying to make 
rent or pay the mortgage every month 
who just don’t feel like they can keep 
up. Their wages are flat. Costs go up. 
Pressure builds on them. 
Congresswoman FUDGE has the exper-
tise and tenacity to fight back. That is 
why I ask my colleagues to confirm her 
for Secretary of Housing and Urban De-
velopment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1444 
March 10, 2021 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, in so many ways, we 
know here that government is really 
about whose side you are on, whom you 
fight for, what you fight against. We 
know we passed—Senator CARDIN
is 
here. He came to the Senate the same 
day I did, and we served in the House 
together. We both recognized what a 
big deal it was to pass that bill last 
Saturday. That is the biggest thing I 
have ever done in my career, and I 
heard other Senators say the same 
thing—shots in people’s arms, money 
in people’s pockets, kids back in school 
and workers in jobs. 
But I think it is also important, just 
for a moment—I will be brief. This is a 
chart of the difference—the biggest 
issue that Senate Republicans and 
President Trump worked on in this 
Congress was the GOP tax bill, the tax 
bill in 2017. Senator CARDIN and I are 
on the same committee that fought 
against some of the overreach from 
Wall Street greed in that bill. 
The purple, the blue is what our bill 
does. Just glance at this for a moment. 
The 20 percent lowest earners, we are 
increasing—we are increasing their 
after-tax revenue by 20 percent, essen-
tially a 20-percent raise for people 
making $20,000 or $30,000 a year. There 
was no help in the Trump tax bill for 
that. 
Then you work up to the second low-
est 20 percent, to the people who are 
modest, working-class families, not 
quite middle class. They get a big 
bump in their incomes from our bill. 
Under the Trump plan, they got pen-
nies. 
Then you work your way up here to, 
essentially, the top 1 percent. All of 
the money went to them, essentially, 
overwhelmingly. 
When you think about what we do 
with taxes and when you think about 
what this Congress did on Saturday 
when we put shots in people’s arms and 
money in people’s pockets and kids 
back in school, one of the most impor-
tant things we did was to give working- 
class kids in Denver and in Santa Fe 
and in Albuquerque and in Baltimore 
and Salisbury, MD, and in Mansfield 
and Cleveland, OH—working-class peo-
ple and poor kids—a chance, a shot, at 
the American dream. 
This is the biggest thing. Senator 
TESTER and I came to the Senate on 
the same day. This is the biggest thing 
we have done in years. It will matter in 
people’s lives. It is something to cele-
brate. More importantly, it is some-
thing we need to carry out and make 
sure that it matters in our constitu-
ents’ lives. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to voice my support for the 
confirmation of my friend and col-
league Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE 
to be the next Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development. I know that 
she will bring strong leadership to HUD 
at a time when our Nation needs it 
most. 
Across my State of Maryland and 
throughout the country, our fellow 
Americans are struggling to keep a 
roof over their heads. Families are liv-
ing in fear of eviction or of missing 
their next mortgage payment. In this 
time of crisis, we need a leader at HUD 
who will prioritize tackling the ongo-
ing housing crisis spurred by COVID– 
19. 
Congresswoman 
Fudge 
has 
ex-
pressed her determination to do just 
that. She is a dedicated and experi-
enced public servant who has earned a 
reputation for swift action and firm 
leadership. Her accumulated experi-
ence spanning a lifetime of service will 
be invaluable in helping the Federal 
Government mount a robust and co-
ordinated campaign to bring those 
hardest hit back from the brink and 
ensure an equitable recovery. 
While addressing the urgent needs of 
renters and homeowners during this 
pandemic, we can’t lose sight of the 
bigger picture. The pandemic has exac-
erbated our country’s affordable hous-
ing crisis and shone a spotlight on how 
it disproportionately harms commu-
nities of color. We are seeing the result 
of decades of discriminatory practices 
like redlining that have targeted mi-
nority families and left an enduring 
stain on our communities that won’t 
be easily wiped away. President Biden 
has put forth a bold plan to combat our 
Nation’s housing crisis, and as HUD 
Secretary, Congresswoman FUDGE will 
be charged with implementing it, re-
versing the damage caused by the 
Trump administration, restoring and 
improving our fair housing protections, 
rebuilding our Nation’s supply of af-
fordable housing, and investing in our 
housing infrastructure. She has her 
work cut out for her. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
Congresswoman FUDGE will work over-
time to tackle these challenges head- 
on. She has spent her career fighting 
on behalf of those most in need and 
those 
who 
have 
been 
historically 
barred from stable living and home 
ownership. She has seen these issues up 
close: 
first 
as 
the 
mayor 
of 
Warrensville Heights, OH, and then as 
a member of the House of Representa-
tives and as chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, where she has helped 
forge compromises that brought real 
results. She is guided by the principle 
that each of us has a responsibility to 
respect and uplift those most in need. 
In her words, ‘‘there is dignity and 
there is grace within every woman 
every man and every child in this na-
tion—including those who live on the 
outskirts of hope.’’ For MARCIA FUDGE, 
service isn’t just a job, it is a calling. 
I know that, should she be confirmed, 
Congresswoman FUDGE
will lead the 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment with unwavering commit-
ment. I look forward to partnering 
with her and the Biden administration 
to provide more Americans with the 
dignity of stable living as we work ur-
gently to strengthen and grow our af-
fordable 
housing 
programs 
across 
Maryland and throughout the country.

S1445 
March 10, 2021 
pleased that last week the committee 
favorably recommended his nomina-
tion to the full Senate by a bipartisan 
vote of 15 to 7. 
Judge Garland is uniquely qualified 
at this moment in history to serve as 
the people’s lawyer and restore honor, 
integrity, and independence to DOJ. 
Judge 
Garland 
graduated 
summa 
cum laude from Harvard College in 1974 
and magna cum laude from Harvard 
Law School in 1977. Following gradua-
tion, he served as law clerk to Judge 
Henry J. Friendly of the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit and to 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. 
Brennan, Jr. From 1979 to 1981, he was 
Special Assistant to the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States. He then 
joined the law firm of Arnold & Porter, 
where he was a partner from 1985 to 
1989 and from 1992 to 1993. He served as 
an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Columbia from 1989 to 1992 and 
as Deputy Assistant Attorney General 
in the Criminal Division of the U.S. De-
partment of Justice from 1993 to 1994. 
From 1994 until his appointment as 
U.S. Circuit judge, he served as Prin-
cipal Associate Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral, where his responsibilities in-
cluded supervising the Oklahoma City 
bombing and UNABOM prosecutions. In 
1997, he was appointed as judge of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit, often seen as the 
Nation’s second highest and most pow-
erful court, given their review of Fed-
eral agency actions and other matters. 
He served as chief judge of the D.C. Cir-
cuit from 2013 to 2020. 
Judge Garland has published in the 
Harvard Law Review and Yale Law 
Journal, 
taught 
at 
Harvard 
Law 
School, and served as president of the 
board of overseers of Harvard Univer-
sity. He served as chair of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Judicial Con-
ference of the United States from 2017 
to 2020. 
Judge Garland has served both Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations 
in the Justice Department, including 
service under President Carter, the 
first President Bush, and President 
Clinton. He earned a reputation as a 
tough and fair prosecutor who took on 
complicated terrorism, violent crime, 
and corruption cases. He established a 
sterling reputation of handling cases 
with the utmost professionalism and is 
seen by his peers as a modest man who 
is 
fundamentally 
a 
decent 
human 
being. 
In 1997, the Senate reviewed his 
record in detail and confirmed him by 
an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 76 
to 23 to serve as judge on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. I 
would note that many of the no votes 
for Judge Garland’s previous confirma-
tion had to do with a dispute over the 
proper size of the D.C. Circuit, as op-
posed to concerns over Judge Garland’s 
qualifications or fitness to serve as a 
judge. 
As President Biden noted in his in-
troduction of Judge Garland’s nomina-
tion, despite his busy schedule and 
prestigious positions, he still makes 
time to volunteer regularly, tutoring 
students in Northeast DC, as he has 
done for 20 years. And I agree this real-
ly shows us the true character of Judge 
Garland, in terms of his commitment 
to public service, helping others, and 
not necessarily seeking out the lime-
light. 
I am hopeful that Judge Garland’s 
appointment will shore up and improve 
the morale at the Justice Department, 
as the Department renews its commit-
ment to uphold civil rights and voting 
rights laws; protect the civil liberties 
and equal access to justice of all Amer-
icans; safeguard our national security 
and combat violent crime; and rout out 
systemic racism in our criminal justice 
system and government. As the only 
Cabinet department named after an 
ideal, I am convinced that Judge Gar-
land will follow the facts, evidence, and 
law wherever it leads him, regardless of 
political pressure or outside influences. 
Let me close by highlighting what 
President Biden and Judge Garland 
stated upon announcing his nomina-
tion. President Biden said forcefully: 
‘‘You won’t work for me. You are not 
the president’s or the vice president’s 
lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It’s 
to the law, the Constitution.’’ 
Judge Garland said: ‘‘The rule of law 
is not just some lawyer’s turn of 
phrase. It is the very foundation of our 
democracy. The essence of the rule of 
law is that like cases are treated alike, 
that there is not one rule for Demo-
crats and another for Republicans, one 
rule for friends and another for foes.’’ 
Judge 
Garland 
noted 
President 
Biden’s promise that he would have the 
‘‘independent capacity’’ to decide who 
is subject to prosecution, based on the 
facts and the law. Judge Garland con-
cluded that: ‘‘I would not have agreed 
to be considered for attorney general 
under any other conditions.’’ 
I again urge the Senate to swiftly 
confirm this nomination, so we can 
bring Senate-confirmed leadership to 
the Department of Justice as soon as 
possible. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of the nomina-
tion of Judge Merrick Garland to be 
United States Attorney General and to 
describe some of the greatest chal-
lenges confronting the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice. 
The DOJ, as it is often called, is un-
like any other Federal Agency. It is 
charged with protecting the constitu-
tional rights and civil rights of all 
Americans. The past 4 years, to put it 
mildly, broke the longstanding prece-
dent that has enabled the Department 
of Justice to operate above the polit-
ical fray. 
The 
Trump 
Justice 
Department 
joined a misguided lawsuit to take 
away healthcare coverage for tens of 
millions of Americans. The Trump Jus-
tice Department oversaw a cruel set of 
immigration policies that separated 
young children from their parents at 
our southern border and locked these 
children in cages. And the Trump Jus-
tice Department remained painfully si-
lent as our Nation cried out for racial 
justice in the wake of the murder of 
George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. 
After the firing of Attorney General 
Sessions, the Attorney General of the 
United States became the Attorney 
General for Donald Trump. When our 
Nation’s top law enforcement official 
becomes little more than a political 
fixture for the President, it erodes the 
principle of equal justice under the law 
and calls into question the mission of 
the Department. 
In the waning days of the Trump ad-
ministration, with nearly half a mil-
lion 
Americans 
dead 
from 
the 
coronavirus, a swarm of White su-
premacists 
and 
other 
extremists 
stormed our Capitol, including this 
very Chamber, and disrupted our peace-
ful transfer of power. Tragically, five 
people died during the January 6 insur-
rection, including a United States Cap-
itol police officer. 
Our Nation must now bring the per-
petrators to justice and address the 
root causes in our society that enable 
White supremacists and other extrem-
ists to fuel hate and violence. 
The next Attorney General cannot 
shy away from these historic chal-
lenges. The next Attorney General 
must meet these challenges head on to 
restore integrity to the Justice Depart-
ment and to work every day—every 
day—to restore the trust of the Amer-
ican people. 
President Biden has nominated Judge 
Garland—not just one of the finest pub-
lic servants I have ever met but one of 
the finest people I have ever met—to be 
Attorney General of the United States. 
His name should be familiar to many of 
our 
colleagues 
because 
President 
Obama nominated him to serve on the 
Supreme Court in 2016. At the time, I 
called him perhaps the most qualified 
individual ever nominated to be on our 
Nation’s highest Court, and I still be-
lieve that to this day. 
Judge Garland graduated at the top 
of his class at both Harvard undergrad 
and Harvard Law School. He clerked 
for Justice Brennan on the Supreme 
Court, and after a time in private prac-
tice, he worked at the Department of 
Justice, where he prosecuted the per-
petrators of the Oklahoma City bomb-
ing. Judge Garland called this, and I 
quote him, ‘‘the most important thing 
I have ever done in my life.’’ 
In 1997, Republicans and Democrats 
joined together to confirm Judge Gar-
land to the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, which is often called the ‘‘second 
highest court in this land.’’ Judge Gar-
land has served honorably and duti-
fully for the past 24 years on the DC 
Circuit, including several years as its 
chief judge. 
Judge Garland has gained the respect 
of all of his colleagues—left, right, and 
center—as someone who knows the law 
and never allows politics into the 
courtroom. Judge Garland works to

build consensus and find principled 
compromises. Judge Garland will bring 
a wealth of legal, law enforcement, and 
judicial experience to the Department 
of Justice to make him uniquely quali-
fied—uniquely qualified—to lead the 
Department at this critical moment. 
Judge Garland will be an Attorney 
General for all Americans—all Ameri-
cans. He will not shy away from the 
challenges facing the Justice Depart-
ment. He will meet them head on. 
At the top of Judge Garland’s to-do 
list is bringing the perpetrators of the 
January 
6 
insurrection 
to 
justice. 
Judge Garland will make sure that the 
Department stays out of the political 
fray and remains independent from the 
White House. And Judge Garland will 
answer the calls for racial justice and 
refocus the Department on one of its 
core missions, to protect the civil 
rights and voting rights of all Ameri-
cans. 
While I will never truly forget the 
shameful treatment of Judge Garland 
during his previous nomination to 
serve on the Supreme Court and in my 
heart I will always believe he should be 
serving on the Supreme Court today, I 
am grateful that Judge Garland has an-
swered the call to serve. 
I am also grateful to his wife of many 
years. I am grateful to his family for 
supporting him and allowing him to 
serve us as he has. He is more than just 
a judge or attorney or a servant. He is 
a mentor. He is somebody who, every 
week, for years—20 years—has made 
time, found time in his life to mentor 
a kid who needs somebody in his life or 
her life. As someone who has been 
mentored for many years myself, I just 
want to say: God bless you. God bless 
you, Judge Garland. My hope today is 
he will get a resounding—resounding— 
vote out of this body. He has earned it. 
He deserves it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CARPER. Madam President, we 
have just invoked cloture on the nomi-
nation of Michael S. Regan, President 
Biden’s nominee to be Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The vote was 65 to 35. To every Demo-
crat and every Republican and maybe 
an Independent or two, I want to thank 
you for your vote. 
I rise today to talk about this nomi-
nation and, more particularly, about 
the person, the man who has been se-
lected to serve as our EPA Adminis-
trator. 
As Members of this deliberative body, 
each one of us has taken an oath to 
protect and defend our U.S. Constitu-
tion. That oath includes offering our

advice and our consent when it comes 
to nominations of the President to fill 
posts in his or her administration. 
It is hard to think of a time in mod-
ern history when the Senate’s role on 
nominations could be considered more 
urgent. We live in a time of great chal-
lenges. Our Nation faces multiple cri-
ses all at once. This includes the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic—the first in 
100 years of this nature—the worst 
economy since the Great Depression, as 
well as the reckoning of racial injus-
tice. All three of these crises are inter-
connected with a fourth that is even 
greater and graver than any emergency 
the United States may have ever faced 
before, and that is the climate crisis— 
the climate crisis. 
President Biden recognizes the im-
portance and urgency of tackling this 
challenge. That is why he ran with a 
promise to make climate action a core 
of his administration’s work and of our 
work. It is also part of the reason why 
a record-setting majority of the Amer-
ican people voted him into office last 
November. 
There are few leadership roles in the 
Federal Government that have greater 
responsibility 
for 
setting 
environ-
mental and climate policy than that of 
the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. This role 
has a profound responsibility—a pro-
found responsibility—to ensure that 
the Agency effectively carries out its 
mission to protect our health and our 
environment. 
That mission is particularly chal-
lenging right now. We know that the 
next EPA Administrator has his work 
cut out for him. He knows it as well. 
In addition to addressing the serious 
environmental issues that are affecting 
Americans, the next EPA Adminis-
trator will also need to rebuild an 
Agency suffering from organizational 
drift and low morale after being repeat-
edly damaged in recent years by flawed 
leadership. 
Scientific integrity has also been 
under attack. We need a strong, prin-
cipled leader to get the EPA back on 
track. 
Michael Regan is the right person for 
the job at this critical moment. He is a 
man of deep faith who believes, as I be-
lieve we all do, that we have a moral 
obligation to be stewards of this planet 
on which we live together. Michael 
Regan is the kind of person who can 
help unite us in common purpose as we 
respond to the climate crisis we face, 
as well as to clean our air, clean our 
water, and strive to make sure that we 
don’t leave some of our communities 
and some of our neighbors behind in 
our efforts to do so. 
He knows how to put together in-
spired teams of men and women who 
are mission-focused and can together 
tackle complex problems and chal-
lenges. 
As Secretary of North Carolina’s De-
partment of Environmental Quality, he 
has proved himself to be an effective 
policy executive and bipartisan prob-
lem solver, someone who forges prac-
tical solutions to clean our air and 
clean our water, while making and 
building a more nurturing environment 
for job creation and job preservation. 
Anyone who has watched the EPA 
over the past few years knows that Mr. 
Regan will have his hands full as Ad-
ministrator. From scandals to climate 
denial, to the unrelenting disregard for 
the 
opinions 
of 
career 
scientists 
throughout EPA, the past two Admin-
istrators leave in their wake a frus-
trated workforce, suffering from orga-
nizational drift and low morale at what 
may be an all-time low. 
One of the keys to restoring that mo-
rale is returning scientific integrity to 
the Agency. Let me say again: One of 
the keys to restoring the morale in the 
EPA is returning to scientific integ-
rity. That also means curbing the in-
fluence of special interests on EPA’s 
scientific advisory boards, which play a 
large role in crafting the Agency’s poli-
cies. 
Mr. Regan will be tasked with com-
bating climate change, the greatest en-
vironmental crisis we are facing as a 
world today. On this issue, we have no 
time to waste. I know my State, Dela-
ware, does not have the luxury to wait 
a minute longer. We have the lowest 
lying State in the country. The State 
is sinking, and the seas around us are 
rising. 
We are not the only State in which 
that has happened. This is felt by other 
States across the country too. One un-
likely State you might find it in is 
Louisiana. 
Louisiana, 
according 
to 
JOHN NEELY KENNEDY, one of the Re-
publican Senators here, told me last 
month, he said his State, Louisiana, is 
losing—get this—a football field of 
wetlands to rising sea levels every 100 
minutes. Think about that, a football 
field of wetlands to rising sea levels 
every 100 minutes. 
I see the signs of this crisis too clear-
ly as I travel throughout my State. 
Madam President, eroding shorelines, 
waterlogged roads, and extreme weath-
er threaten our economy and our way 
of life. Erratic weather patterns make 
farming some of our biggest crops—and 
we raise a lot of soybeans, and I know 
in your State you raise a couple of soy-
beans as well, but we raise a lot of soy-
beans. It makes farming, whether rais-
ing soybeans or corn or chickens, a lot 
more difficult. 
Mr. Regan saw similar problems 
around another Wilmington—not Wil-
mington, DE, but Wilmington, NC—a 
problem similar to what we see every 
day in Wilmington, DE. He understands 
that we do not have to choose between 
economic growth and clean air and 
clean water. It is indeed a false choice. 
He knows, like many of our world’s 
leaders, that combating this crisis pre-
sents, instead, a chance for real eco-
nomic growth—real economic growth 
that can create millions of good-paying 
American jobs and breathe life into 
communities large and small through-
out this country. 
And we know that the economic cost 
of spending a little today more than 
outweighs the cost of inaction. I be-
lieve it was Ben Franklin who once 
said that ‘‘an ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure.’’ 
I know we all think that is a quote 
that comes from our grandmothers. It 
actually came originally from Ben 
Franklin. 
As EPA Administrator, Mr. Regan 
will also need to work with States, 
with Tribes, and with municipalities to 
combat contamination in our Nation’s 
water supply from something called 
PFAS, one of thousands of permanent 
chemicals. Some are benign. Some of 
them are very, very dangerous to our 
health. They are called forever chemi-
cals. Unfortunately, this is a critical 
public health issue that the last admin-
istration did not approach with the ur-
gency it deserved. They talked a good 
game but didn’t come through. What 
do they say in Montana? ‘‘All hat, no 
cattle.’’ That is what we saw with re-
spect to these permanent chemicals in 
the last administration. 
This has hit home for me, and my 
guess is it hits home for the Presiding 
Officer, too, in Wisconsin. But coming 
from a State—we have got military in-
stallations, one of the biggest airbases 
in the world, Dover Air Force Base. I 
am hugely proud of Dover Air Force 
Base. It may be the best airlift base in 
the world. And, for years, we have, un-
fortunately, occasionally, had inci-
dents, accidents, and we need to have 
firefighters come out, and they use 
firefighting foam to try to save lives. 
And in doing that, it endangered the 
lives of other people because of the 
PFAS contamination that is in the 
firefighting foam, and it gets into our 
groundwater. 
And it is not just Delaware. It is not 
just Delaware. It is not just Wisconsin. 
It is like, last I heard, hundreds, maybe 
300 bases around the country where 
there is a problem with PFAS contami-
nation in the groundwater close to our 
military bases. 
If his work in North Carolina on this 
issue is any indication, Mr. Regan will 
leave no stone unturned. We will also 
be looking to the EPA Administrator 
to ensure cleaner air by reestablishing 
the legal basis for the Mercury and Air 
Toxics Standards, which were upended 
by an administration more interested 
in protecting special interests than 
they were keeping mercury out of our 
air and our water supply. 
These standards have been shown 
over time to be cost-effective, and they 
are supported by major coal-fired utili-
ties across this country. Let me say 
that again. These standards have been 
shown over time not only to be cost-ef-
fective, but they are supported by 
major coal-fired utilities across this 
country. 
As Administrator, Michael Regan 
will also oversee the phasedown of 
something 
called 
HFCs, 
powerful 
greenhouse gasses used as a refrig-
erant—think 
refrigerators, 
freezers,

air-conditioners in our house and our 
cars. They do a good job of keeping it 
cool and our food cool. Unfortunately, 
they are about 1,000 times worse, more 
dangerous than carbon dioxide is to 
greenhouse gas—1,000 times worse. 
Last Congress, I was proud to help 
lead a bipartisan effort with a couple of 
our Republican colleagues, JOHN NEELY 
KENNEDY and JOHN BARRASSO, to phase 
down the production of these harmful 
chemicals while giving American man-
ufacturers a leg up in making the cool-
ants of the future. 
How many jobs will flow from this? 
Tens of thousands of American jobs. 
How much economic opportunity for 
American companies? Billions and bil-
lions of dollars. And, oh, by the way, I 
should hasten to add, you know, we 
hear from scientists that tell us that 
we are sort of at the turning point for 
us in terms of climate change by which 
we can’t turn back. It is about 2 de-
grees Celsius for the balance of this 
century—2 degrees. Our phasedown of 
hydrofluorocarbons is worth a half-de-
gree Celsius just by itself, just this one 
thing. So this is a huge thing, and we 
did it in a bipartisan way here in the 
Senate and the House. I am very grate-
ful to everyone for their support. 
Let me add a couple of more points, 
if I can. Mr. Regan will need to help 
craft 
emission 
standards 
for 
cars, 
trucks, and vans that will fight climate 
change and help keep America in the 
lead in the clean car revolution. We 
heard not long ago from our friends at 
GM. GM announced that beginning in 
2035, they are not going to be building 
and selling vehicles powered by gaso-
line or diesel. Think about that. That 
is like 14 years from now. I think Ford 
may have announced in Europe that 
they are not going to be building vehi-
cles that drive or are powered by gaso-
line or diesel. In Europe, by 2030, like I 
said, 9 years, this is coming. 
So the question is, Will we be ready 
for it? Will we take advantage of it? 
Will we be able to find, in this adver-
sity of climate change, an economic 
opportunity? Yes, we can and espe-
cially with respect to the kinds of vehi-
cles that we are going to build and 
drive into the future. 
Michael Regan’s tenure in North 
Carolina is, I think, a testament to his 
ability to bring people together and 
work across the political divide. He 
spearheaded what is considered to be 
the largest coal ash cleanup settlement 
in U.S. history. He successfully led the 
negotiations that resulted in the clean-
up of the Cape Fear River, right where 
my wife used to work for the DuPont 
company, the Cape Fear DuPont plant. 
And he created North Carolina’s first- 
ever Environmental Justice and Equity 
Advisory Board. 
Mr. Regan has been able to do these 
things and much more by bringing peo-
ple together to find bipartisan, lasting 
policy compromises, all while never 
compromising on his principles. He and 
I both believe in the adage that bipar-
tisan solutions are lasting solutions, 
and we could use a few more of those 
around here. 
That ability to unite people in com-
mon purpose, to approach his role as a 
public servant with humility, with em-
pathy, and with grace, that central 
part of Mr. Regan’s character has been 
demonstrated throughout his public 
service and his nomination process. 
Interestingly, 23 of our country’s na-
tional agricultural organizations wrote 
to my committee—to our committee, 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee—to recommend him for the 
job. Most people might say: Well, big 
deal. Well, it was a big deal. How often 
do we have like dozens of major na-
tional agricultural organizations step-
ping up and saying, ‘‘We want to em-
brace this candidate to be the head of 
the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’’? Not very often, but they did in 
this case. 
They highlighted his ‘‘established 
record of listening to all stakeholders, 
including farmers and ranchers.’’ And 
they 
applauded 
his 
pragmatic 
ap-
proach, writing that ‘‘during his ten-
ure, he has worked to find practical, 
sound solutions to myriad environ-
mental issues in the state.’’ 
We heard this same sentiment in his 
nomination hearing before the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee. 
Throughout his testimony and ques-
tioning, Mr. Regan made it clear that 
he will be an EPA Administrator for 
red States just like he will be an EPA 
Administrator for blue States. He lis-
tened to concerns from both sides of 
the dais and made commitments to 
work with anyone to solve a problem 
facing their constituents. 
That is what helped earn him a 14-to- 
6 bipartisan vote of approval coming 
out of the EPW Committee. I remem-
ber us measuring the amount of time 
from someone’s name being actually 
submitted by a President to, actually, 
before we even had a hearing, much 
less got somebody reported out—meas-
ured in months, in months. In this 
case, we are talking about weeks, and, 
God willing, hours this afternoon. 
Believe it or not, his committee 
hearing before the committee a couple 
of weeks ago, he was introduced to the 
committee by two Senators from his 
State. You may think that is not a big 
deal, maybe not, but they are both Re-
publicans. They are both Republicans. 
We heard from one of them, THOM 
TILLIS, that Mr. Regan ‘‘has earned a 
reputation for being a thoughtful lead-
er willing to engage.’’ His colleague 
from North Carolina Senator BURR un-
derscored Mr. Regan’s ability to listen, 
saying that organizations across North 
Carolina and across the country sup-
port Mr. Regan for Administrator be-
cause ‘‘they understand they will not 
always agree with every decision hand-
ed down by EPA, but they know and 
trust they will receive a fair hearing.’’ 
This is a Democratic nominee rec-
ommended by two Republican Senators 
from the same State. Honestly, I don’t 
see that every day, and I want to say a 
special shout-out thanks to RICHARD 
BURR and THOM TILLIS for doing that, 
supporting Mr. Regan’s nomination. 
Michael Regan understands that cli-
mate change shouldn’t be a partisan 
issue. Its impacts hit red States and 
blue States alike. Wildfires rage across 
California, while floods in Florida dam-
age homes and roads. Deadly ice 
storms endanger the power supply in 
Texas, while a drought in New Mexico 
harms farming and puts people at risk. 
Water 
contamination 
near 
an 
Air 
Force base in Delaware harms families 
just like contamination near a Na-
tional Guard base in South Dakota. 
And dirty air from a powerplant in 
Ohio or West Virginia can make their 
way into neighboring States like ours 
and like Maryland, our neighboring 
State, like New Jersey. 
The problems that are before our 
next EPA Administrator—and, hope-
fully, it will be Michael Regan—those 
problems are great. As Albert Einstein 
once said, ‘‘In adversity lies oppor-
tunity.’’ Think about that—in adver-
sity lies opportunity. We have an op-
portunity here to fulfill our moral obli-
gation to be good stewards of this plan-
et, and we can seize on that oppor-
tunity if we have the right leader in 
place to make it happen. 
During my years in the Navy, then as 
Governor of Delaware, I learned first-
hand that leadership is maybe the most 
important thing in the success of any 
organization I have ever been a part of. 
I don’t care if it is a business; I don’t 
care if it is a State; I don’t care if it is 
the Senate or House, a hospital, a 
school, leadership is always the key— 
always the key. The leader sets the 
tone, helps write the rules of the road, 
and makes sure that those working 
under him or her are doing what is 
right. 
I learned a lot from really good lead-
ers, and, frankly, I have learned a few 
things from really awful leaders. I sus-
pect, if truth be known, we would all 
say the same thing. The best leaders 
are humble, not haughty. They have 
the heart of a servant. They under-
stand their job is to serve, not to be 
served. Leaders have the courage to 
stay out of step when everyone else is 
marching to the wrong tune. They un-
derstand their job is to unite, not di-
vide. They build bridges, not walls. 
Leaders surround themselves with 
the best people they can find. When the 
team does well, the leader gives the 
credit to his or her team. When the 
team falls short, the leader takes the 
blame. Leaders don’t build themselves 
up by tearing other people down. They 
are aspirational. They appeal to peo-
ple’s better angels. 
I remember a French philosopher, Al-
bert Camus, once said that leaders are 
‘‘purveyors of hope.’’ Think about that, 
purveyors of hope. Leaders always seek 
to do what is right, not what is easy or 
expedient. They focus on excellence in 
everything they do. If it is not perfect, 
they say: Let’s just make it better. 
Leaders treat other people the way

they want to be treated. And, finally, 
when leaders know they are right, they 
are sure they are right, they don’t give 
up. They just don’t give up. 
Michael Regan is that kind of leader. 
We need that kind of leader, and I am 
convinced that he is the leader we need 
for his critical role at this critical time 
in our Nation’s history. 
So, Madam Chair and colleagues, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, I urge 
all of my colleagues to support his 
nomination. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The junior Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss my opposition to 
the nomination of Michael Regan for 
Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
Now, before I begin, let me be very 
clear. I really liked meeting and get-
ting to know Michael Regan. He is a 
dedicated public servant and an honest 
man. He had a beautiful family with 
him, and he answered the questions as 
straightforwardly 
as 
I 
think 
he 
thought he could. I have enjoyed get-
ting to know him through my role as 
the ranking member on the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, 
and I appreciated the willingness he ex-
pressed to visit my home State of West 
Virginia. But this vote is not based on 
what Mr. Regan might do if he had his 
say; this vote is about confirming 
someone to execute President Biden’s 
agenda, which Mr. Regan said he would 
faithfully do, and I cannot support that 
agenda. I cannot support that agenda 
that Secretary—if confirmed—Regan 
would be tasked with implementing. 
Throughout his confirmation process, 
Secretary Regan did not commit to a 
different policy agenda than that of the 
Obama administration—an agenda that 
absolutely devastated my State and 
other energy-producing States. 
In his nomination hearing, Secretary 
Regan, because he is secretary of North 
Carolina’s 
Department 
of 
Environ-
mental Quality, would not comment as 
to whether the so-called Clean Power 
Plan or something worse would be re-
instituted. He did not rule out a return 
to the WOTUS rule. He could not say 
whether the EPA would again claim 
overarching authority to force States 
to shift their electricity generation 
sources. He could not commit to real 
changes, and that is because the agen-
da is already set. Climate czar Gina 
McCarthy and others have already set 
the table. 
InsideEPA recently reported: 
Administration observers are questioning 
whether Michael Regan . . . could face a di-
minished role if he wins Senate confirmation 
due to the large number of Obama-era offi-
cials who have returned to the agency and 
the White House to work on implementing 
Biden’s environmental agenda. 
The article went on to say: 
[T]hese sources also say that because there 
are so many officials now working on cli-
mate change policies across the Biden ad-
ministration, this could lead to ‘‘turf wars’’ 
between EPA and the White House on this 
issue. 
Well, I share those concerns. 
For almost 2 months now, unac-
countable czar Gina McCarthy has been 
working both behind the scenes and in 
front of the press to lay the ground-
work for the Biden administration’s 
agenda. She is wielding her power pub-
licly to make it clear who is calling 
the shots and directing the troops. 
McCarthy herself said recently: 
I’ve got a small stronghold office, but I am 
an orchestra leader for a very large band. 
She is operating this ‘‘stronghold’’ 
office with no transparency outside of 
the Senate confirmation process. It 
would be bad enough with just a turf 
war between an equally matched White 
House and EPA, but we know that 
McCarthy is poised to have influence 
within the EPA too. 
In addition to the Obama EPA alums 
already in place, the nomination of 
Janet McCabe to serve as EPA Deputy 
Administrator has only increased my 
concern and made it worse. 
In 2019, McCabe, McCarthy, and an-
other alum of the Obama EPA wrote an 
op-ed fully backing the overreaching 
Clean Power Plan. They admitted that 
their Clean Power Plan was a War on 
Coal. They stated: 
The best way to cut emissions is to shift 
electricity generation from the dirtiest 
plants, which happen to use coal. 
So they were willing to say it out-
right once they were out of public of-
fice. They are willing to admit to their 
War on Coal. It upsets me because they 
wouldn’t say it to the people of my 
State when they were in the office. 
They didn’t have the courage to look 
the people in West Virginia—they 
didn’t even come to our State to talk 
about it—to look them in the eye and 
admit they wanted to wipe coal off the 
map. Had they come, they would have 
had to hear in person, eye to eye, the 
harm, the devastation that workers in 
our coal industry and many other asso-
ciated industries in West Virginia were 
facing. 
WVU economist John Deskins put 
that harm into perspective in testi-
mony before the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee at a 
hearing in 2015. He observed: 
In Central Appalachia, coal production has 
fallen by 51 percent since 2010, compared to a 
decline of 10 percent from the nation’s other 
coal-producing regions. . . . [N]early all of 
the coal job losses that have occurred in 
West Virginia have come from our state’s 
southern coalfields. The concentration of 
these job losses has created a Great Depres-
sion— 
Great Depression— 
in 
six 
southern 
counties—Boone, 
Clay, 
Logan, McDowell, Mingo, and Wyoming 
[Counties]. Job losses over the past four 
years range between— 
Remember, this is in 2015— 
25 and 33 percent in each of these counties. 
That is how many jobs were lost. 
John Kerry stood alongside Gina 
McCarthy in the Oval Office in January 
and talked about how workers in the 
fossil fuel industry can just become 
wind turbine technicians or solar panel 
technicians. John Kerry doesn’t really 
know what it actually means to be any 
type of these workers. 
Brad Markell, a representative from 
the AFL–CIO Industrial Union Council, 
explained some of the differences to 
the Washington Post. He said: 
You get guys that are coming off of fossil 
jobs in the Dakotas or the wind belt, and are 
making, you know, eighty, ninety, a hundred 
thousand a year. [To put wind turbines up], 
they’re looking at thirty to thirty-five thou-
sand, with either no or substandard benefits. 
In President Biden’s White House, we 
have unaccountable—and either mis-
guided 
at 
best 
or 
uninformed 
at 
worst—czars trying to do what they 
think is best for this country. 
So let’s go back to Secretary Regan. 
In his hearing, he talked in depth 
about his work with Republicans in 
North Carolina and his commitment to 
transparency, and both of the Repub-
lican Senators from his home State 
came and introduced him to our com-
mittee and spoke very well of his abil-
ity to work across the aisle. 
I appreciate that greatly, and I wel-
come that, but the fact remains that I 
can’t support Secretary Regan when 
Gina McCarthy is the self-described or-
chestra leader for the Biden adminis-
tration and Kerry is basing so-called 
‘‘transition’’ policies on a fantasy 
world that does not exist. 
I am very skeptical that the next 4 
years will be any better than the 8 
years of economic devastation brought 
on by President Obama’s EPA. So, 
without commitments to different poli-
cies than what were pursued in the 
Obama EPA, I cannot support Sec-
retary Regan today. But, you know 
what? I hope he proves me wrong. I 
hope he makes good on his promise to 
work with Republicans to help address 
climate issues. 
As ranking member of the EPA Com-
mittee, I stand ready to just do that. 
We have so much common ground on 
climate issues. I hope Secretary Regan 
can cut Gina McCarthy out of power 
and let her know who is calling the 
shots for environmental policy in the 
Biden administration. I hope Secretary 
Regan 
embraces 
President 
Biden’s 
mandate of unity and works with both 
red and blue States to take care of our 
planet. Until then, I will continue to 
look out for my State and practice ag-
gressive oversight on what I think may 
be coming. 
I yield the floor.

SAN). The Senator from Virginia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1450 
March 10, 2021 
the American Rescue Plan and its ef-
fect on my economy. 
It has been a tough year. It was a 
year ago tomorrow that I sent my Sen-
ate staff home for a trial-run, 2-day 
telework in case we ever were to need 
it, and they never came back. Until 
now, as people are starting to get vac-
cinated, they are coming back person-
ally to the office after having worked, 
in a pretty amazing way, virtually for 
the year. 
It was just about a year ago that I 
got coronavirus. It was just about a 
year 
ago 
that 
I 
gave 
my 
wife 
coronavirus. It has been a long, long 
year: more than 500,000 Americans 
dead, more than 10 million still out of 
work. After sizable work by Congress 
in five bills in 2020 to inject resources 
into the economy, we are still down 10 
million jobs. 
But today is a bright day. Just with-
in the last few hours, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the Senate bill that 
we sent to them Saturday afternoon on 
the American Rescue Plan, building off 
the original House proposal, and that 
bill is filled with things that will make 
a tangible difference nearly imme-
diately in the lives of so many Ameri-
cans: payment to everyday families, in-
dividuals, children; acceleration of the 
vaccine deployment; resources so that 
we can open our schools and our col-
leges and our childcare centers, which 
are all preconditions to seeing the 
economy reopen. 
In Virginia—just making this about 
my home Commonwealth—State and 
local governments in Virginia will re-
ceive about $6.8 billion to cover costs of 
COVID, revenues lost due to COVID, 
but also projects that can help the 
economy accelerate so that we can 
climb out of the economic catastrophe 
that has been COVID. 
Eighty-four percent of Virginians— 
that is more than 7 million people, 2 
million of whom are children—will re-
ceive stimulus checks because of the 
bill the Democrats got passed in the 
House and Senate. 
Just think of that. Seven million 
Virginians 
will 
receive 
stimulus 
checks. The average per filer—and 
many file jointly, so this will be sort of 
a household average—would be nearly 
$3,000. 
The child tax credit portion of the 
American Rescue Plan will provide ad-
ditional resources on top of those 
checks to 1.6 million Virginia children, 
lifting 85,000 currently below the pov-
erty level to above the poverty level. 
Just in my State, 85,000 children below 
the poverty level will no longer be 
there. 
The expanded earned income tax 
credit in Virginia will affect nearly 
420,000 adults, enabling them to work 
with more dignity, with less financial 
stress, as they try to manage the chal-
lenges of their life in this tough time. 
Also, 250,000 adults whose unemploy-
ment benefits were in danger of expir-
ing are now protected through early 
September because of the bill. 
Small businesses, which have suf-
fered so much, will get a significant up-
lift—just restaurants, with the $28 bil-
lion restaurant fund in the American 
Rescue Plan. There are 15,000 res-
taurants in Virginia, all of which have 
suffered because of COVID, because of 
social distancing requirements, supply 
chain challenges, workers who have 
been out sick. That $28 billion fund of-
fers great hope for my restauranteurs. 
For Virginia education, our local 
school systems—134 cities and counties 
operate 
K–12 
systems—will 
receive 
more than $2 billion to deal with the 
costs of COVID, including expanded 
broadband so that their students can 
have better access to online course cur-
riculum, including money that could be 
used for summer instruction, for exam-
ple, so that we can tackle learning gaps 
that occurred during the last year; and 
$845 million for Virginia higher edu-
cation institutions. 
And something that I am particu-
larly excited about—I have a child who 
is an early childhood worker. That is 
what he does. Forty percent of Virginia 
childcare centers were closed for much 
of the year because of the pandemic. 
Virginia will receive nearly $800 mil-
lion in additional childcare support so 
our childcare centers can be open, 
which will not only be good for chil-
dren but will enable their parents to 
return to work more easily. 
In the healthcare space, accelera-
tions of vaccines, lower healthcare pre-
miums because of expanded subsidies 
for those who are purchasing insur-
ance, mental health expansion to deal 
with the significant psychological and 
emotional traumas of the last year, 
housing, food, transit, broadband, pen-
sion reform. 
There is so much in this bill for Vir-
ginians. There is so much in this bill 
for the residents of red States, blue 
States, in-between States. Every ZIP 
code in the United States, every family 
in the United States will see some im-
pact that they can see, touch, and feel. 
It is not often that you pass a bill 
where you can say this about it—that 
the tangible results for virtually every 
American will be seen so quickly. 
I want to focus a little bit, having 
talked about the tangible benefits in 
Virginia, just on the analysis of the 
bill nationally, and I have a couple of 
charts I want to show. 
Coincidentally, or maybe not coinci-
dentally, the size of the American Res-
cue Plan was pretty close to the size of 
the Trump tax cuts that were done in 
December of 2017. The Trump tax cuts 
were about $1.9 trillion, and the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan ended up being at 
about $1.75 trillion. So they are pretty 
close. 
And what these two plans dem-
onstrate, if you look at the Trump tax 
plan and you look at the American 
Rescue Plan, is that you will see how 
very, very different the priorities of 
the two parties are. The recovery plan 
passed in this body with every Demo-
cratic vote and no Republican votes. 
The Trump tax plan passed in 2017 with 
every Republican vote and no Demo-
cratic vote. I believe these two plans 
are almost a perfect representation of 
the priorities of the two parties right 
now in this body—not just in this body 
but all around the country. 
If you analyze the content of these 
two bills, which were nearly identical 
in size, you can definitely understand a 
lot about the priorities of the two par-
ties. On the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the 
Trump tax cuts, 54 percent of the $1.9 
trillion benefit went to people making 
more than $75,000 a year, 16 percent 
went to people making less than $75,000 
a year, 31 percent were tax cuts for 
businesses. 
If you look at the American Rescue 
Plan, you see something very, very dif-
ferent: 44 percent of the aid was aid to 
individuals, 21 percent was pandemic 
and other policies that focus on getting 
us out of the healthcare crisis, 9 per-
cent is to our schools and universities, 
18 percent for our State and local gov-
ernments to try to forestall massive 
layoffs of governmental employees, and 
then 8 percent are tax cuts to individ-
uals. 
These are very different priority sets 
between the GOP’s key accomplish-
ment with the 2017 tax cuts and now 
this accomplishment that the Demo-
crats have worked so hard to achieve in 
the American Rescue Plan. 
This tells you about priorities, but 
the next chart is probably my favorite 
because I think it makes it even clear-
er. This is a chart that shows the bene-
fits of both the American Rescue Plan 
in blue and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
in red, and I don’t think those colors 
were coincidentally done by my staff. 
It shows how the benefits of these 
two bills—they are identical in size— 
were 
arrayed 
across 
the 
income 
groupings, income quintiles of the 
American public. The top 20 percent of 
the American public in income got 65 
percent of the benefit from the Trump 
tax cuts. They get 11 percent of the 
benefit from the American Rescue 
Plan. 
In the 60-to-80-percent quintile, you 
will see that the two plans were pretty 
close to equal. Not exactly—the Demo-
cratic plan was a little bit better in 
terms of the benefits at that level. But 
as you move into the 40-to-60-percent 
quintile, that midrange of Americans, 
the Democratic proposal gave much 
more of the benefit to people in that 
income frame, that income quintile, 
than the Republican proposal. 
In the 20-to-40-percent range, it is 
quadruple the Democratic allocation of 
benefits to that lower middle-class por-
tion of the American public, quadruple 
what the Republican tax plan allo-
cated. 
But what you really see is, in the 
lowest quintile income of the American 
public, the people who struggle the 
most and during the pandemic were 
hurt the most, 23 percent of the bene-
fits of the American Rescue Plan went 
to that lowest 20 percent of the Amer-
ican public while only 1 percent of the

March 10, 2021 
benefit of the Trump tax cuts was allo-
cated 
to 
that 
hard-hit, 
struggling 
group of people. 
Again, if you want to look at the pri-
orities of the two parties by analyzing 
these two sizable bills that each side 
claims is an accomplishment they are 
proud of, you just need to look at this 
particular chart and understand who 
each side, each party, is battling for 
and who is each side, each party, try-
ing to help. 
Finally, one last chart and then a 
concluding comment. The last chart 
shows the poverty rate in this country 
beginning in 2007. Now, we know we 
had an economic challenge in 2008, 2009, 
2010 that was significant, and then the 
poverty rate started to come down late 
in the Obama first term and continued 
to come down into the Trump first 
term. But you will see what has hap-
pened since 2017 with the passage of the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If that had not 
happened, the poverty rate would have 
started to tick back up again after hav-
ing come down for a number of years. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did have 
an effect on the poverty rate. It 
knocked it down a little bit. So there 
was a positive effect on the poverty 
rate from the Republican tax proposal, 
but it was not very significant. 
But the projection about the Amer-
ican poverty rate following the passage 
of the American Rescue Plan is a dra-
matic reduction—a dramatic reduction 
of poverty from more than 12 percent 
down to poverty just above 8 percent— 
and we would expect to see that by the 
end of the year. 
We are not talking about by the end 
of the decade or by the end of 5 years 
or by the end of this Congress. We are 
talking about by the end of the year. 
I think these charts—and, again, par-
ticularly this chart that arrays the 
benefits of both the tax cuts bill of 2017 
and the American Rescue Plan and 
shows to whom the benefits were allo-
cated—speak volumes about two very 
different philosophies about the econ-
omy, two very different philosophies 
about equity, two very different phi-
losophies about how to truly include 
everyone in legislation that is big, 
tough, challenging legislation. 
Finally, I will say this as I conclude: 
The passage and the signing of the 
American Rescue Plan will also start a 
realtime economic experiment because 
the Republican tax plan was done in 
2017, and we can measure what that has 
done and what it hasn’t done from 2017 
to the beginning of the pandemic. You 
would not want to include the pan-
demic necessarily; that wouldn’t be a 
fair way to measure. But if you look at 
the passage of the tax cut plan in De-
cember of 2017, say, to March of 2020, 
you can get a pretty good view of what 
that tax bill did or didn’t do to the 
American economy. 
Now, in the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan and the allocation of the 
benefits of the plan, as demonstrated 
here, we are going to start the clock on 
a realtime experiment of a different 
economic philosophy. If you take gov-
ernment action and you try to direct 
the focus of it on middle and lower in-
come people, my surmise is, those dol-
lars will likely be spent; they will be 
spent in community institutions and 
stores and purchasing properties or 
maybe buying a car. They will be 
spent, and they will have a multiplier 
effect throughout the economy. They 
are not going to be used to buy back 
stock. They are not going to be used or 
socked away because there is nowhere 
to spend it. 
I think you will see that the spending 
effect of allocating benefits in this way 
is going to have a significant, positive 
effect on the American economy at a 
time when it needs it and at a time 
when the people who are most helped 
are most in need. 
We need to build an economy coming 
out of this crisis that is not only ro-
bust but that is also sustainable, mean-
ing environmentally sustainable but 
sustainable and less subject to boom, 
busts in areas that leave people high 
and dry. We also need to build an econ-
omy that is more equitable, not meas-
ured just by GDP increase or stock 
market increases that can affect some 
but measure more in statistics like 
wages, reduction of poverty, startup of 
new businesses that demonstrate an 
economic vitality that is spread broad-
ly among the population. 
We are starting the realtime clock on 
that experiment today. We will be able 
to compare the value of the $1.9 trillion 
tax cut to the $1.75 trillion American 
Recovery Plan in years to come. And I 
am very, very excited to understand 
that because I think it may point the 
way forward to additional economic ad-
vances that will make us stronger. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL STANLEY REGAN 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise 
today to support the nomination of Mi-
chael Regan to be the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency. 
One look at Michael’s resume should 
make it clear to my colleagues that he 
is immensely qualified for this posi-
tion, not only in qualifications but in 
his demeanor. 
Michael is a proud North Carolinian 
who, over the last 4 years, has ably 
served as secretary of the North Caro-
lina department of environment. You 
will consistently hear from those who 
have worked with him in this role that 
whether they agreed or disagreed on a 
given policy, he always listened and 
looked to find agreement. 
This type of praise is not easy to 
come by on environmental matters, 
but it is exactly what we should ask of 
any nominee to ensure everyone gets a 
fair hearing at their Agency. That is 
exactly why North Carolina’s agricul-
tural community supports his nomina-
tion. 
It is our job to ascertain whether a 
nominee has the knowledge and experi-
ence to do the job that the President 
has nominated them for, but, too often, 
we overlook whether a nominee has the 
right character to lead an organiza-
tion. In this case, there is no question 
that Michael Regan has that character. 
I have had the pleasure to get to 
know him over the last several years 
and to see firsthand his sincerity and 
love for his family. I know when a man 
of this caliber is confirmed, he will 
bring those same qualities to the Agen-
cy he leads, bolstering the EPA and en-
suring that communities reliant on ag-
riculture for their livelihood will be 
listened to. 
In closing, Michael Regan is a good 
man. He is the right man to lead the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency. 
And I would urge you and urge my col-
leagues to confirm him to be the next 
Administrator of the EPA. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am 
here this afternoon to speak in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1, the so-called For the 
People Act. Every American—no Amer-
ican should be fooled by the wholesome 
title of H.R. 1. H.R. 1 is an affront to 
the U.S. Constitution, and the drastic 
impact this legislation would have on 
federalizing elections, restricting free 
speech, and accelerating the divide in 
this country—that divide between left 
and right, rural and urban, red States 
and blue States—would be terribly 
damaging to our Nation. 
We often hear that elections have 
consequences. In November, Americans 
voted for a Congress that is nearly a 
50–50 split between the parties in the 
House and precisely a 50–50 split in the 
Senate. If elections have consequences, 
then the consequence American voters 
may have had in mind was to encour-
age Congress to put aside partisan dif-
ferences and to work together to do its 
job on their behalf. 
Americans did not vote to give one 
party free rein to implement an un-
precedented power grab, to nationalize 
elections, and to strip power from 
States and localities from now into 
perpetuity, forever. 
I am a conservative, and I believe in 
the primacy of individual liberties and 
in a Federal Government that exercises 
restraint. I believe that State and local 
units of government are inherently 
more responsive to the wishes of our 
citizens. Article I, section 4 of the Con-
stitution states that ‘‘Time, Places and 
Manner’’ of congressional elections 
‘‘shall be prescribed [by the States].’’ 
My adherence to the Constitution thus 
instructs deference to State govern-
ments to oversee their own elections, 
as they always have and always should. 
There are so many problematic and, 
frankly, unconstitutional aspects of

this legislation, particularly as it per-
tains to the micromanagement of local 
elections by the Federal Government. 
With regard to the bill’s intent to 
Federalize State elections, I draw your 
attention to page 44, section 1004. 
Democrats, in sponsoring and pursuing 
passage of this legislation, seek to 
eliminate voter identification laws. 
Voter identification laws have a lot of 
merit. It is required that you be a U.S. 
citizen to cast a vote in the United 
States. 
American 
people 
generally 
have common sense, and the Gallup 
poll indicates that 80 percent of Ameri-
cans support voter ID laws. When you 
explain to Americans what voter ID 
really is, they do support it. Yet, under 
this legislation, voters showing up to 
the polls without an ID could simply 
sign a statement claiming they are 
who they say they are. If you want to 
dispel the notion that voter fraud oc-
curs in our elections, this is not the 
place, this is not the way to accom-
plish that. I don’t want our laws to dis-
courage people from voting, but I want 
people to be legal who do vote. 
On page 166, this bill requires that 
ballots be counted outside a voter’s 
precinct, removing a local govern-
ment’s ability to verify voter rolls. 
That authority would instead go to a 
bureaucrat in Washington. 
The requirement to allow third par-
ties, including those politically affili-
ated, to pick up and deliver absentee 
ballots, known as ballot harvesting, 
further erodes confidence in elections. 
Such a requirement is directly at odds 
with recommendations from a 2005 bi-
partisan Commission on Federal Elec-
tion Reform led by former President 
Jimmy Carter, which recommended 
that States prohibit this practice due 
to an increased likelihood of fraud. 
H.R. 1 doesn’t even keep the bipar-
tisan nature of the Federal Election 
Commission in place. It alters its 
structure deliberately to make it work 
on behalf of the party in power. 
One last point on local elections. 
This bill allows for in-person voting 15 
days before an election. This is the typ-
ical, the classic unfunded mandate. I 
talked to local election officials about 
this provision specifically, and it would 
kill their budgets, maintaining rent 
and staff for weeks on end in rural 
counties across Kansas where, realisti-
cally, you might get fewer than a hand-
ful of people to show up on a day that 
far before the election. There are plen-
ty of other ways to vote in advance 
when necessary. This would create 
real-world 
consequences, 
real 
con-
sequences in rural America and in 
rural Kansas. A one-size solution from 
Washington, DC, does not solve all 
problems and, in fact, in many in-
stances creates more problems. 
While this provision alone probably 
wouldn’t have contributed to voter 
fraud, this bill does so by prohibiting 
officials from reviewing voter eligi-
bility or barring local officials from re-
moving ineligible voters from the voter 
rolls. 
It is imperative that we restore 
America’s faith in our elections, and 
that is why I am a supporter of S. 13, 
legislation led by our own Senator, TIM 
SCOTT of South Carolina, to establish a 
bipartisan 
advisory 
committee 
to 
make recommendations that will im-
prove the security, integrity, and ad-
ministration of Federal elections. This 
is a measured approach that will help 
us regain the trust of American voters. 
H.R. 1 goes as far to the other end of 
the spectrum as is imaginable. It dras-
tically changes the rules of our elec-
tion, implementing every leftwing pol-
icy idea pertaining to Federal elec-
tions—ideas that are evidently so good, 
they must be made mandatory. If they 
were good, they might find their way 
into existence across the country be-
cause they are good, not because the 
Federal Government requires them. 
This legislation would sow immense 
doubts among voters about the integ-
rity and administration of our elec-
tions—something we further do not 
need. It would corrode our entire sys-
tem of elections, and for what purpose? 
Because, simply put, I think Demo-
crats believe passing H.R. 1 would 
render rural voters, red State voters, 
impotent and therefore help them win 
elections. 
At a time when our country is so di-
vided, when we should be working to-
gether, for example, to end the con-
sequences of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
to get America vaccinated, and get our 
economy back on track, this is a very 
damaging policy to our Republic, and 
it is contained within the 800 pages of 
H.R. 1. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle take time to read and under-
stand this bill and see and determine 
for themselves what it truly is. I am 
interested in making sure that all peo-
ple have the opportunity to vote. All 
people who are legally eligible to vote, 
I want them to vote. But we ought to 
not skew our elections to see that 
those we want to vote are the only ones 
who are eligible to do so and that those 
who are not eligible to vote are able to 
do so. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

NOMINATIONS OF VANITA GUPTA AND LISA 
MONACO 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee heard from the nominees for the 
No. 2 and No. 3 jobs at the Department 
of Justice. 
As you know, earlier today, we con-
firmed the next Attorney General of 
the United States, Judge Merrick Gar-
land. I supported Judge Garland’s nom-
ination because I think he is a quali-
fied, mainstream nominee with the 
right experience and the right tempera-
ment to lead the Department of Jus-
tice. I believe being Attorney General 
is probably the hardest job in the Cabi-
net because you have two masters. One 
is the rule of law, as the chief law en-
forcement officer for the country; the 
other is, you are a member of the 
President’s Cabinet and serve at his or 
her pleasure, obviously, a political ap-
pointment. 
Judge Garland told me, and I take 
him at his word, that he would work 
hard to keep politics out of the work of 
the Justice Department—a goal that 
folks on both sides of the aisle should 
support, especially after the struggles 
of previous administrations. 
As I said, I was proud to support 
Judge Garland’s nomination, and now 
we begin the process of considering 
other senior positions at the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
One of the nominees who came before 
the Judiciary Committee yesterday 
was Lisa Monaco, who has been nomi-
nated to serve as the Deputy Attorney 
General. 
Ms. Monaco is a lifelong public serv-
ant who previously spent 15 years at 
the Department of Justice. She is a 
highly respected Federal prosecutor 
and national security expert. She ad-
vised President Obama and a number of 
other top government officials on mat-
ters like homeland security, cyber se-
curity, and counterterrorism, and her 
expertise extends beyond the ins and 
outs of matters of policy. Her knowl-
edge of the Department of Justice as 
an organization will be invaluable to 
the Department, whose more than 
100,000 employees are responsible for 
carrying out a diverse set of missions. 
It is a huge organization with a lot of 
moving parts. 
Like Judge Garland, Ms. Monaco af-
firmed to me that she does not intend 
to inject politics or to even give it a 
hearing within the Department of Jus-
tice and her duties as the Deputy At-
torney General. 
I asked her, for example, if she would 
allow Mr. Durham, who has been ap-
pointed as special counsel, to inves-
tigate the Crossfire Hurricane issue 
from the last administration and the 
tail end of the Obama administration. 
She said she saw no reason not to give 
Mr. Durham a chance to complete his 
work. That is the same position we 
took on Robert Mueller, who was ap-
pointed as special counsel to inves-
tigate President Trump. Again, I take 
her at her word that she will not do 
anything to fire Mr. Durham or deprive 
him of the ability to complete his im-
portant work. 
Ms. Monaco discussed her experience 
at the Department over the course of 
the Clinton, Bush, and Obama adminis-
trations. She really does have a lot of 
important, relevant experience. She 
talked about the unique role of the 
Justice Department, which, as I sug-
gested a moment ago, functions both as 
an executive agency that is charged

with 
implementing 
the 
President’s 
policies as well as being an inde-
pendent investigator and, in some 
cases, a prosecutor. She described the 
importance of acting free from polit-
ical or partisan influence as her ‘‘North 
Star.’’ 
While Ms. Monaco and I will surely 
have policy disagreements at some 
point, I trust her ability to fairly and 
impartially administer justice while 
operating free of personal bias or polit-
ical agenda. I believe she is well quali-
fied to serve as the Deputy Attorney 
General, and I plan to support her nom-
ination. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say the same 
for the second nominee who appeared 
before the Judiciary Committee yester-
day. Vanita Gupta has been nominated 
to serve as the Associate Attorney 
General, which is sometimes consid-
ered to be the No. 3 position at the De-
partment of Justice. Throughout her 
career, Ms. Gupta has been a clear and 
outspoken advocate for some pretty 
radical policies. 
In 2012, for example, she wrote that 
States should decriminalize the posses-
sion of all drugs—not just marijuana 
but all drugs—which, I presume, would 
include things like fentanyl, heroin, 
methamphetamine, and other highly 
addictive and destructive drugs. In yes-
terday’s hearing, when I asked Ms. 
Gupta about this statement, she took 
the opposite position. She didn’t tell 
me ‘‘I used to advocate for that posi-
tion and have now changed my posi-
tion.’’ She said, unequivocally, that 
she did not advocate for the decrimi-
nalization of all drugs. It became ap-
parent she wanted Senators to forget 
what she previously wrote: 
States should decriminalize simple posses-
sion of all drugs, particularly marijuana, and 
for small amounts of other drugs. 
That is a quote from an article she 
wrote in 2012. Unfortunately, the list of 
inconsistencies does not end there. 
In June of 2020, less than a year ago, 
Ms. Gupta argued that it ought to be 
easier to sue police officers in court for 
money damages. Now, this is some-
times called ‘‘qualified immunity,’’ 
which recognizes the fact that law en-
forcement officers have to make split- 
second 
decisions—life-or-death 
deci-
sions, actually—and that it would be 
unfair to them to, in retrospect, go 
back and flyspeck all of their deci-
sions. In other words, it gives them 
some room in which to operate, recog-
nizing the unique nature of their job. It 
applies to other government employ-
ees, too. Yet, in June 2020, less than a 
year ago, she argued that it was time 
to revisit this doctrine of qualified im-
munity—in other words, to make it 
easier to sue police officers for money. 
This was one of the many steps that 
she outlined in an opinion piece in a 
national 
publication 
following 
the 
death of George Floyd. Nine months 
later, she says she does not support 
that position—one she supported 9 
months ago. Now she says she does not 
support the position of making it easi-
er to sue police officers. 
And there is more. 
Last summer, Ms. Gupta put her sup-
port behind the ‘‘defund the police’’ 
movement. As our country engaged in 
an important and long overdue debate 
about the police’s use of force and re-
sponsible policing strategies, the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee held a hear-
ing on that very topic. 
Ms. Gupta testified before the com-
mittee and said: 
While front-end systems changes are im-
portant, it is also critical for state and local 
leaders to heed calls from Black Lives Mat-
ter and Movement for Black Lives activists 
to decrease police budgets and the scope, 
role, and responsibility of police in our lives. 
Yesterday, Ms. Gupta did not mince 
words. She said she does not support 
defunding the police, and she said de-
creasing 
police 
budgets 
was 
not 
defunding the police. Well, at the time 
we were discussing this movement for 
defunding police, she attempted to 
parse her words. It is tough to rec-
oncile the stark difference between 
what Ms. Gupta has said in the past 
and what she now says as she attempts 
to win support in the Senate. I am 
wary and, frankly, skeptical of con-
firmation conversions wherein people 
take the opposite positions when they 
are nominated for important, Senate- 
confirmed positions from the positions 
they have taken in the past. 
I 
understand 
her 
interest 
in 
distancing herself from her previous 
positions. 
Decriminalizing 
drugs, 
eliminating qualified immunity—mak-
ing it easier to second-guess and sue 
police officers for money damages—and 
defunding the police are radical policy 
positions that should disqualify some-
one from becoming the third-highest 
ranking official at the Justice Depart-
ment. In order to be confirmed, Ms. 
Gupta knows she needs to convince us 
that she actually holds mainstream 
views on law enforcement strategies 
and issues. I find it hard to believe that 
these views, which are not from dec-
ades-old law school writings but are re-
cent public statements—indeed, sworn 
testimony before the U.S. Senate Judi-
ciary Committee—are views she no 
longer holds, which she said she held so 
recently. 
I want to be clear on one point. 
The opinions of Ms. Gupta’s as a pri-
vate citizen are not an issue. She has 
every right to hold opinions that differ 
from mine or anybody else’s, but when 
you are the nominee for a high level— 
indeed, one of the highest levels—of 
critical 
law 
enforcement 
positions, 
these are highly problematic and, to 
my mind, disqualifying. 
Perhaps more so than any other Fed-
eral Department or Agency, the De-
partment of Justice must operate free 
from bias and political agendas. The 
men and women leading the Depart-
ment must be able to separate their 
personal beliefs from the jobs before 
them. No matter how they feel about 
the wisdom of the policies enacted by 
Congress, their jobs are to enforce the 
law not as they want it to be but as it 
is. People across the country should 
have confidence that the senior leaders 
at the Justice Department will follow 
the law as written—without fail. We 
can’t have leaders who turn a blind eye 
to whatever is politically convenient 
when it conflicts with their personally 
held positions. 
Based on Ms. Gupta’s clear history of 
radical policy positions, which stands 
in stark contrast to the laws she would 
be charged with enforcing, I do not be-
lieve she can separate her convictions 
from the job at hand. Leaders within 
the Department must be able to view 
all matters as matters of fact and as 
matters of duty, not just as matters of 
opinion or as platforms to argue for 
changes in the law. 
As the Senate has considered the 
President’s nominees over the past sev-
eral weeks, I have been very clear that 
I will not oppose nominees based sim-
ply on the President’s political party. I 
think the President is entitled to some 
deference as to the people he chooses. 
That was the strategy of our Demo-
cratic colleagues previously, and it is 
incredibly damaging to both our coun-
try and its institutions. Just because a 
President you don’t like has nominated 
somebody does not justify opposing 
that President’s nominee. I will con-
tinue to evaluate all nominees of this 
President based on their merits and 
their abilities to do the jobs for which 
they were nominated. 
I firmly believe that the American 
people deserve to have qualified, fair-
minded individuals leading these im-
portant Departments and Agencies. 
For the Department of Justice, which 
is responsible for enforcing the law of 
the land and imparting fair and equal 
justice, that is doubly true. There is 
simply no room for political or par-
tisan or ideological agendas at the De-
partment of Justice. I am concerned 
that Ms. Gupta will continue to pursue 
those objectives from within the De-
partment and use all of the Depart-
ment’s tools and the authority given to 
her to achieve these ideological out-
comes. Therefore, I cannot support her 
nomination. 
I yield the floor.

FOREIGN AGENTS REGISTRATION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
recently, 
the 
Biden 
administration 
withdrew a proposed Trump adminis-
tration rule that would have required 
universities and K–12 schools to iden-
tify their connections with Confucius 
Institutes, which are very much con-
nected to the country of China and, I 
would even say, to the Communist 
Party of China, which may be one and 
the same. I have asked the Biden ad-
ministration about that move, but the 
administration has failed to respond to 
date. So I am here today to discuss 
four areas wherein the administration 
must be tough with China as well as 
with other countries. 
Since April 2015, I have conducted 
oversight on several key aspects of for-
eign efforts to influence Members of

March 10, 2021 
Congress and the American public. 
First, I have focused on the equal, fair, 
and aggressive enforcement of trans-
parency laws. An example of one trans-
parency law that I will focus on is the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act. 
I first raised concerns about the For-
eign Agents Registration Act in April 
2015, when it became very apparent 
that it wasn’t being used hardly at all. 
Historically, it hasn’t been used very 
much, and people have been getting 
away without registering under that 
act. It may be OK to represent a for-
eign country or a foreign interest, but 
at least we in Congress ought to know 
about it, and, in turn, the American 
people ought to know who you are and 
whom you are speaking for. 
In 1938, Congress passed that law for 
the purpose then of exposing Nazi prop-
aganda and identifying foreign at-
tempts to influence policymakers as 
well as the American public. Last up-
dated in 1966, the Foreign Agents Reg-
istration Act requires those who lobby 
on behalf of foreign governments and 
foreign interests to register their affili-
ations and activities with our Justice 
Department. 
The Foreign Agents Registration Act 
reflects the fundamental principle that 
transparency 
brings 
accountability. 
Until recently, however, the law has 
been seldom used. The Foreign Agents 
Registration Act ought to be better en-
forced and also be equally enforced. 
That is why I worked to expose holes in 
the existing law and then find ways 
through additional legislation to shore 
it up or even use oversight to see that 
the Justice Department takes its use 
with more certainty and with more 
force. 
As a result of those efforts, last ses-
sion, I introduced a bipartisan bill that 
goes by the title of ‘‘Foreign Agents 
Disclosure and Registration Enhance-
ment Act.’’ Since it wasn’t passed in 
the last Congress, I will be reintro-
ducing it this session. The bill requires 
the Justice Department for the first 
time to craft a comprehensive enforce-
ment strategy and to release advisory 
opinions to promote that transparency. 
It gives investigators new tools, includ-
ing civil investigative demand author-
ity, to help identify violations. 
Last Congress, the bill had support 
from Chairman GRAHAM and Ranking 
Member FEINSTEIN
of the Judiciary 
Committee and Chairman RUBIO and 
Vice Chairman WARNER of the Intel-
ligence Committee. It also had bipar-
tisan support on the Foreign Relations 
Committee, including from Senators 
SHAHEEN, RUBIO, MURPHY, and YOUNG, 
who have all worked to shine a light on 
foreign influence. We also had the 
signoff from the chairman of that com-
mittee, also with support from the 
Trump administration. 
Unfortunately, when Senator CORNYN 
and I joined on the floor just before 
Christmas to ask for unanimous con-
sent for the passage of this bill that 
had such broad bipartisan support, the 
Democrats objected even though it had 
this bipartisan, multicommittee sup-
port. 
So I strongly urge the Biden adminis-
tration to join my efforts in making 
commonsense, bipartisan reforms to 
the Foreign Agents Registration Act 
and to make it a priority. My bill gets 
the job done. 
The second point I want to raise is 
that I have focused my oversight on in-
creasing nontraditional espionage ac-
tivities and foreign threats targeting 
taxpayer-funded research. 
When I was chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee in 2018, I convened a 
hearing regarding Chinese nontradi-
tional espionage against the United 
States. In that hearing, both DOJ and 
FBI officials made very clear that the 
threat to our universities and tax-
payer-funded research from foreign 
governments, especially China, is real 
and it is ongoing. For example, the De-
partment of Justice witness stated: 
We need to adapt our enforcement strategy 
to reach non-traditional collectors, includ-
ing researchers in labs, universities, and the 
defense industrial base, some of whom may 
have undisclosed ties to Chinese institutions 
and conflicting loyalties. 
The FBI witness stated that China’s 
talent recruitment programs are effec-
tively ‘‘brain gain programs’’ that ‘‘en-
courage theft of intellectual property 
from U.S. institutions.’’ 
In June of 2019, when I was chairman 
of the Senate Finance Committee, I 
held a hearing on foreign threats to 
taxpayer-funded research which fo-
cused heavily on China’s theft and Chi-
na’s espionage within our research 
community here in the United States. 
After the hearing, I organized a clas-
sified committee briefing on the topic 
from the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the National Insti-
tutes of Health, the Department of 
Health and Human Services inspector 
general, and the Department of Home-
land Security. 
The Trump administration ramped 
up government efforts to investigate 
and prosecute researchers for stealing 
intellectual property and research. The 
Biden administration must continue 
those aggressive efforts if they want to 
be taken seriously. Those efforts are 
more important now than ever. For ex-
ample, during the COVID pandemic, 
China has used cyber attacks to try to 
steal COVID-related research. 
Third, another focus of mine has been 
on 
propaganda 
efforts 
within 
our 
schools and universities. Specifically, 
that concerns China’s Confucius Insti-
tutes. As an extension of the Chinese 
Government, the Confucius Institutes 
are a foreign principal for purposes of 
the Foreign Agents Registration Act. 
According to reporting, the strategic 
goal of the Chinese Government is to 
place its institutes within existing col-
leges and universities in order to influ-
ence perceptions of the Communist 
government in China under the guise of 
teaching Chinese language, Chinese 
culture, and Chinese history. In other 
words, we have to see this problem 
with open eyes. 
In light of these factors, in October 
of 2018, I wrote to the Justice Depart-
ment and asked why it had yet to re-
quire individuals working for Confu-
cius Institutes to register as foreign 
agents under the Foreign Agents Reg-
istration Act. 
Then, in March of 2020, I wrote to 
dozens of schools asking that they get 
a briefing from the FBI on the threats 
Confucius Institutes bring to the aca-
demic environment. 
I have also strongly backed Senator 
KENNEDY’s Confucius Act—that is the 
title of the bill—which passed the Sen-
ate just last week. In part, that bill 
mandates that if a school wants an in-
stitute on campus, that school must 
have full managerial and academic 
control, not control from the Chinese 
Government. 
China’s threats to our security are 
very real. They are known and show no 
sign of stopping. It is a very good sign 
that in the past couple of years, many 
universities and colleges have cut ties 
with Confucius Institutes. Probably 
some of those were on those respective 
campuses for a long period of time. 
The Biden administration must use 
every tool at its disposal to protect and 
defend our national security from this 
Communist threat, which is why I 
wrote to the Biden Department of 
Homeland Security on February 11 this 
year regarding its withdrawal of the 
Confucius rule, which I thought was a 
very good step forward from the pre-
vious administration. 
Among the questions I asked of the 
Department, two relate to whether the 
Biden administration considers the 
Confucius Institute to be an extension 
of the Communist Chinese Government 
as well as being purveyors of Com-
munist 
Chinese 
propaganda. 
That 
ought to be easily recognized, and I 
imagine our President does recognize 
it, but I want to have him tell me so. 
So far, that Department has thus far 
failed to respond. 
The Biden administration would be 
wise to answer both in the affirmative 
to clearly state to the country and the 
world where it stands regarding Chi-
na’s gigantic propaganda machine, of 
which the Confucius Institutes are only 
a small part. In other words, besides 
going after the Confucius Institutes, 
we have to have our eyes open to every 
way that the Communist Chinese and 
their government is trying to influence 
things in this country, as well as steal-
ing things from our country. 
Lastly, I want to highlight a very im-
portant issue that has recently been 
brought to my attention. Upon enter-
ing office, President Biden fired all 
U.S. Executive Directors at multilat-
eral development banks who were cur-
rently serving out their terms. Some of 
these multilateral development banks 
are the International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank, the Asian Develop-
ment Bank, and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. 
It has been U.S. tradition for incom-
ing Presidents to allow these non-
partisan U.S. Executive Directors to

serve in their positions until their 
term ends regardless of whatever ad-
ministration put them in those posi-
tions. This tradition is meant to ensure 
that the United States maintains a 
consistent authoritative presence and 
engagement within those multilateral 
institutions. 
In 
the 
last 
administration, 
the 
United States was tough on China 
through these development banks, and 
we were hoping that these people would 
be left in place so they could continue 
that tough-on-China approach. The Ex-
ecutive Directors who were in their re-
spective positions made it a point to 
defend 
U.S. 
strategic 
interests 
by 
building coalitions aimed at eroding 
Chinese influence, which has been al-
lowed to grow at an alarming extent. 
There is quite a push by the Chinese 
Communist Government to get in-
volved in the highest levels of almost 
every international organization, not 
just these banks that I am talking 
about. 
Removing these U.S. leaders from 
their positions prior to their terms ex-
piring and with no replacements even 
nominated isn’t an example of the 
United States leading; this is an exam-
ple of our country ceding its duties and 
responsibilities on the world stage. 
In addition to my unanswered let-
ters, the Biden administration should 
inform Congress as to why it removed 
all Executive Directors from their posi-
tions prior to their terms expiring. 
I hope President Biden knows China 
is aggressively growing its influence in 
these multilateral organizations, so 
now isn’t the time to abandon the field. 
There is no time to be weak with 
China. We must work tirelessly to pro-
tect our way of life and our national 
security from the ever-present threat 
of the Communist Chinese Govern-
ment. At the same time, we must build 
on the foundation that the Trump ad-
ministration created to protect Amer-
ican taxpayers from foreign theft and 
espionage and propaganda. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL STANLEY REGAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to support the nomination of Mi-
chael S. Regan to be Administrator of 
the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency as we celebrate the Agency’s 
50th anniversary and the return of the 
United States to the Paris Agreement, 
which the agency will play a key role 
in meeting. 
Reducing carbon pollution and other 
forms of air and water pollution has 
generated 
enormous 
environmental, 
health, and economic benefits over the 
last 50 years. 
While 
the 
Trump 
administration 
claimed that rolling back clean air pro-
tections frees up economic activity, in 
fact, reducing climate emissions is 
critical to a thriving, sustainable econ-
omy. Fortunately, many States main-
tained a strong commitment to pro-
tecting air quality and addressing cli-
mate change. Maryland, under Repub-
lican and Democratic Governors, has 
benefitted from participating in the 
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
with 10 other States. However, the EPA 
is indispensable: Air pollution crosses 
State borders and requires strong and 
fair Federal regulation. 
I am energized by Mr. Regan’s com-
mitment to furthering progress on en-
vironmental justice. Research shows 
that air pollution and climate change 
disproportionately harm low-income 
communities 
and 
communities 
of 
color. Maryland suffers disproportion-
ately from upwind pollution from fos-
sil-fuel fired power plants out of State. 
The United States District Court for 
the District of Columbia’s recent rejec-
tion of the Trump administration’s ef-
forts to weaken carbon pollution limits 
for power plants clears the way for the 
EPA to set thoughtful standards that 
will effectively slash carbon emissions 
from the electricity sector and create 
clean energy-related jobs. 
Now that President Biden has re-
turned our Nation to the Paris Agree-
ment, the EPA has a critical role to en-
sure America leads by example at 
home. After all, this is the Federal 
agency the Endangerment Finding ob-
ligates to take action under the Clean 
Air Act to curb emissions of carbon 
pollution from vehicles, power plants, 
and other industries. 
Carbon neutrality is the policy tool 
that may drive economic recovery and 
innovation for the coming decades. 
This goal to achieve a 100-percent 
clean energy economy and net-zero 
emissions no later than 2050 would 
align us with a pathway to limit global 
temperature rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius 
and help avert the most catastrophic 
effects of climate change. The EPA will 
play an increasingly important role in 
climate policy, which will be a key ele-
ment of economic policy, domestically 
and internationally. 
The EPA’s climate responsibilities 
include 
the 
phase-down 
of 
hydrofluorocarbons—HFCs—potent 
greenhouse gases used as coolants in 
refrigerators, air conditioners, and in-
dustrial applications that are the sub-
ject of the Kigali Amendment to the 
Montreal Protocol, a global agreement 
to protect the ozone layer. The bipar-
tisan Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2021 provided authority to allow for 
the phase-down of HFCs and subse-
quent transition to the newer, better 
alternatives. 
Rebuilding scientific expertise is fun-
damental to the ability of the EPA to 
carry out this and other climate re-
sponsibilities. The Union of Concerned 
Scientists recently reported that the 
EPA lost more than 1,000 scientists be-
tween its highest reported number of 
scientists in early 2017 and its lowest 
reported number of scientists at the 
end of 2019. On average, the Agency 
lost over 200 scientists per year be-
tween 2016 and 2020. I am relieved 
North Carolina Governor Cooper com-
mended Mr. Regan for restoring morale 
among career staff at the Department 
of Environmental Quality and empha-
sizing a respect for science. He will 
need to do the same at EPA. 
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy should be the last workplace to have 
vacancies during a climate crisis that 
is undeniable. In 2018 alone, there were 
14 separate billion-dollar weather and 
climate disasters in the United States, 
with a total cost of $91 billion. These 
costs will likely rise due to climate 
change. 
Carbon dioxide released into water-
ways as a result of water pollution by 
nutrients 
is 
enhancing 
unwanted 
changes in ocean acidity due to atmos-
pheric increases in carbon dioxide. The 
changes may already be affecting com-
mercial fish and shellfish populations, 
according to data and model pre-
dictions published in the American 
Chemical Society’s journal, Environ-
mental Science & Technology. A new 
study by the Smithsonian Environ-
mental Research Center also shows 
that oysters stressed by low dissolved 
oxygen and warm water—the result of 
extreme weather events—early in life 
grow thicker shells and less meat, 
which threatens a way of life for Mary-
land oyster fishers and growers. 
The EPA also leads the Federal agen-
cy partners in engaging the Chesa-
peake Bay Program, a grassroots effort 
with bipartisan support to preserve and 
restore the largest estuary in the coun-
try. Executive Order 13508 declaring 
the Chesapeake Bay Watershed a na-
tional treasure established a goal of re-
storing oyster populations in 20 tribu-
taries of the Chesapeake Bay by 2025. 
Over the past 4 years, the Trump ad-
ministration sought to undermine the 
Chesapeake Bay Program and roll back 
Clean Water Act protections critical to 
the restoration effort, proposing to 
eliminate the EPA program’s budget in 
total dereliction of its duties as a key 
Federal partner. Despite these set-
backs, the Chesapeake Bay Program 
partners have made steady progress to-
ward achieving the nutrient reduction 
goals set out in 2010 in the Chesapeake 
Clean Water Blueprint to have 100 per-
cent of measures in place by 2025 to 
achieve 
fishable, 
swimmable 
water 
quality standards. 
This is significantly more likely once 
the EPA returns to proper levels of 
staffing and funding. As Administrator, 
I am confident Mr. Regan will respect 
science and the duties of the Agency to 
lead the Chesapeake Bay Program 
through this substantial milestone. 
The EPA is the lynchpin in the 
Chesapeake Bay Program. Maryland 
farmers have successfully stepped up to 
the plate to achieve nutrient reduction 
goals. Their efforts will be diminished,

however, if the EPA does not act as ar-
biter to hold States accountable for 
pollution upstream. Therefore, I was 
particularly pleased to see that the ag-
ricultural community widely supports 
Mr. Regan’s nomination. 
Both the global effort to combat cli-
mate change and the regional Chesa-
peake Bay restoration effort are enor-
mously challenging. Yet the prospect 
of confirming Michael Regan to be the 
Administrator of an EPA that produces 
policy based on Scientific evidence and 
robust community input has me hope-
ful that we can sustain a healthy, vi-
brant watershed and Nation for genera-
tions to come.

The nomination was confirmed. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that with respect 
to the Regan nomination, the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table and the President 
be immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me explain to the public and the 
Senators what we are doing here. In 
the bipartisan agreement we faced 
under a 50–50 Senate, the rules say that 
if there were a tie vote, the majority 
leader has the ability to discharge the 
nomination from committee and then 
there be a vote on the floor. 
In this case, the nomination of Xa-
vier Becerra to be Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, there was a tie 
vote in the Finance Committee. And 
what I will be doing in a moment is in-
voking that rule so that there can be 4 
hours of debate on the motion, equally 
divided, and we will debate whether 
Becerra should be approved. Obviously, 
he only needs approval with 50 or 51 
votes if the Vice President comes to 
break the tie. 
I will say a brief word here. It is con-
founding to me that Mr. Becerra, Xa-
vier Becerra, did not get some votes 
from the other side of the aisle. He is 
an eminently qualified member. He was 
an outstanding Member of Congress. He 
was a very good Attorney General, and 
he has led the charge to keep people’s 
healthcare. When he was Attorney 
General, he was involved in the law-
suits of those who wanted to repeal the 
ACA. And if that is the reason our Re-
publican colleagues are objecting—be-
cause he wants to keep and preserve 
the Affordable Care Act, which is very 
popular with the American people and 
very needed—I am surprised. It is yes-
terday’s news. 
I know in 2010 a lot of people came 
here, ‘‘Repeal ACA,’’ but as the public 
got to know the ACA, they saw how 
good it was. And there is not much 
groundswell out there, except among 
some, the hard right, to repeal it. So I 
am surprised. And then we heard: Well, 
he is not a doctor. I would remind my 
colleagues that the last nominee for 
HHS they supported was a drug com-
pany executive. Are our Republican 
friends saying they would rather have 
a drug company executive who was not 
a doctor either than somebody who has 
been a very careful, smart attorney 
who has been fighting for people to get 
better healthcare? I am surprised. 
So I hope that we may get a few of 
our colleagues to join us tomorrow and 
vote for Mr. Becerra. I don’t think it 
will serve the country well or the Re-
publicans well to be so adamantly op-
posed to him. But let me now proceed. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on Fi-
nance, being tied on the question of re-
porting, I move to discharge the Senate 
Finance Committee from further con-
sideration of the nomination of Xavier 
Becerra, of California, to be Secretary 
of Health and Human Services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, we ex-
pect a vote on the motion to discharge 
to occur at approximately 12 noon on 
Thursday, March 11, 2021.

ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

TRIBUTE TO BRAD RICHARDSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
was one decade ago that my friend 
Brad Richardson saw an opportunity in 
Hardin County. The community was 
ready to step on the gas pedal and start 
a new era of growth. It had the raw ma-
terials: a dynamic workforce, a pre-
mium location, and a strong ally in 
Fort Knox. All it needed was the right 
person to lead the way. Today, I would 
like to pay tribute to Brad, a visionary 
leader who helped realize the area’s po-
tential. At the end of this month, he 
will begin a well-deserved retirement 
with our sincere thanks. 
The first step was bringing everyone 
together. Brad is a natural team build-
er. He oversaw the consolidation of 
four local business advocacy groups 
into the Hardin County Chamber of 
Commerce. 
The 
new 
organization 
would help attract investment to one 
of Kentucky’s most populous counties. 
As the chamber’s inaugural president, 
Brad spent the next decade doing just 
that. 
One of Brad’s first moves at the new 
Hardin Chamber was to restart the an-
nual Small Business Expo. The event 
gives local entrepreneurs the opportu-
nities to connect with customers and 
local leaders as they expand their oper-
ations. Brad also launched a Buy Local 
campaign to keep Hardin County’s dol-
lars in the community. In 2014, he was 
named the Chamber Executive of the 
Year by the Kentucky Chamber of 
Commerce Executives. 
Hardin County is more than a great 
place to live and work. It is also the 
proud home to Fort Knox, one of Ken-
tucky’s premier military installations 
and the location of the U.S. bullion de-
pository. 
The 
installation 
supports 
over 20,000 local jobs and makes a 
multibillion dollar annual economic 
impact. In 2016, Brad was a driving 
force in the establishment of the Knox 
Regional Development Alliance. The 
group is tasked with promoting the re-
lationship between the community and 
our Armed Forces. For his work to en-
courage the partnership, Brad was 
given the Fort Knox Gold Neighbor 
Award. 
I’ve worked closely with Brad and 
KRDA to invest in Fort Knox’s infra-
structure and capabilities. Last year,

that hard work paid off. The Pentagon 
selected Fort Knox to host the reac-
tivated V Corps headquarters. Ken-
tucky is one of the most military- 
friendly States in the country, and 
Hardin County was eager to welcome 
more than 600 additional soldiers. I am 
grateful to KRDA, Brad and his team, 
and our many other partners who made 
the stationing of the V Corps at Fort 
Knox a reality. 
Over the years, Brad increased cham-
ber membership and made substantial 
innovations for his community and our 
Commonwealth. That record of accom-
plishment would be enough for anyone. 
But Brad was determined to bring his 
good humor and enthusiasm to every 
project. He made it a real pleasure to 
be part of his team. When Brad took 
this job, he set an ambitious goal to 
enhance the quality of life in Hardin 
County. By any objective standard, I 
think he succeeded. 
So we are all going to miss working 
with Brad at the Hardin County Cham-
ber of Commerce. Along with his col-
leagues and friends, I extend my best 
wishes for a fulfilling retirement. On 
behalf of the Senate, I would like to 
congratulate Brad on all of his success 
and to thank him for many years of 
leadership in Kentucky.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to submit for the RECORD a letter 
sent to the U.S. Senate from Cathy and 
Bill Schreiber of Wilson, WY. 
I recently had the opportunity to 
visit with Bill. He shared with me his 
optimism for the future of our Nation 
and his belief that the ‘‘worst of the 
pandemic is behind us.’’ 
In their letter, Cathy and Bill ex-
pressed support for helping those most 
impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Like many people, they felt assistance 
should be targeted to only those indi-
viduals truly impacted by the pan-
demic. They offered sincere, honest op-
tions to make sure the relief got in the 
hands of those who need it, while lim-
iting the financial strains additional 
debt spending will create for our Na-
tion. 
Cathy and Bill asked that I share 
their letter with the Senate. It ex-
presses their confidence in the future 
and their compassion for others who 
continue to be adversely impacted by 
the current pandemic. I ask unanimous 
consent that their letter be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MARCH 3, 2021. 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATORS: I want to start by thank-
ing you all for the hard work you have all 
performed over the last year dealing with 
the COVID 19 pandemic. The economic relief 
and stimulus bills that you have pass start-
ing last March have made all the difference 
in the world! Without this support from the 
federal government I believe the country 
would have descended into the greatest de-
pression the country has ever experienced. 
And that would negatively effect the world 
economy. 
As indicated by the amazing rebound in 
the stock market, it is clear that the current 
economic slow down is a health problem, not 
a systemic economic problem. I live and 
work in a small resort in northwest Wyo-
ming and our community was hit very hard 
early last year. But now the economy is 
strong again and the unemployment rate is 
less than 4%! That means over 90% of the 
workforce is working. With the number of 
vaccines being administered now close to 
two million doses a day and vaccine avail-
ability ramping up very quickly, I believe 
the worst of the pandemic is behind us. 
So now it is time to focus on the people 
who got hit hard by COVID. And there are 
millions. I see that the Senate is reducing 
the income eligibility for stimulus checks 
and I believe that is a good thing. I hope it 
can focus the $1,400 payments to an even 
higher degree to the people that need them. 
This will help the bill be more bipartisan 
which will set the tone for future legislation! 
This is SO important right now. 
It appears to me that my wife and I will 
qualify for the full $2,800 stimulus check 
based on our income from 2019. But we would 
not qualify based on our 2020 income. We do 
not need the stimulus check. The check we 
received last spring we gave to people we 
knew who had lost their jobs. We will do the 
same thing again if we do receive a check, 
but we would much rather see less money 
borrowed by the U.S. government than giv-
ing money to the millions of workers that 
have not been financially effected by the 
pandemic. I would like you all to com-
promise a little and consider the following. 
Treat the stimulus checks received in 2021 
as ordinary income. This way folks that have 
made great financial gains over the last year 
will give some back to the U.S. treasury. 
Restrict who gets checks based on net 
worth. Pick a number. I understand this is 
difficult to determine but it can be done. 
Have state and local governments provide 
revenue statements for the last 24 months to 
see which ones really needs help. The county 
I live in does not need any financial help in 
my opinion. A 5% reduction in revenue is not 
the end of the world. It is even heathy in my 
opinion. 
Keep some extra ‘‘gunpowder’’ for some 
more future support for the unemployed for 
later this year and 2022. 
Start to discuss how the government is 
going to pay this money back. These trillion- 
dollar sums become meaningless after a 
while. If the taxpayers of this county were to 
pay 10 million dollars a day towards this new 
debt, it would take 530 years to pay it off! 
And that amount does not even account for 
any interest. 
And last, please remove funding for special 
projects and put them in a separate piece of 
legislation. 
I know that fundamentally all Senators 
basically want the same near-term result. 
The pandemic to be behind us and that all 
Americans who have been hit hard by it be 
helped through the next year or two. I be-
lieve the economy is going to come roaring 
back very soon. It will be different but 
strong. 
I thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, 
CATHY AND BILL SCHREIBER, 
Wilson, Wyoming. 
P.S. Please reduce the proposed stimulus 
bill by $2,800 on our behalf.

By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. 
BALDWIN, and Ms. SMITH): 
S. 686. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to address the 
teacher and school leader shortage in 
early childhood, elementary, and sec-
ondary education, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 686 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retaining 
Educators Takes Added Investment Now 
Act’’ or the ‘‘RETAIN Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to create a re-
fundable tax credit for early childhood edu-
cators, teachers, early childhood education 
program 
directors, 
school 
leaders, 
and 
school-based mental health services pro-
viders in early childhood, elementary, and 
secondary education settings that rewards 
retention based on the time spent serving 
high-need students. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The shortage of experienced, qualified 
early childhood educators and elementary 
school and secondary school teachers is a na-
tional problem that compromises the aca-
demic outcomes and long-term success of 
students. 
(2) The shortage is the result of many fac-
tors including low pay, frequent turnover in 
school leadership, poor teaching conditions, 
and inadequate teacher supports. 
(3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty 
areas where the factors contributing to the 
shortage are particularly acute and have an 
increased negative impact on teachers of 
color remaining in the field. 
(4) A child’s access to high-quality early 
childhood education is critical to supporting 
positive outcomes, and early childhood edu-
cators— 
(A) play an important role in setting the 
foundation for future learning, and 
(B) promote the development of vital 
skills, habits, and mindsets that children 
need to be successful in school and in life. 
(5) In 2019, the national median pay of 
early childhood educators was a mere $30,520, 
with many early childhood educators relying 
on government assistance programs such as 
Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assist-
ance program established under the Food 
and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et 
seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy 
families program established under part A of 
title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
601 et seq.), and struggling to provide for 
their own families. 
(6) Studies have demonstrated that well- 
qualified, experienced teachers are the single 
most important school-based element con-
tributing to a child’s academic achievement 
and success. 
(7) In 2019, the average teacher salary in 
public elementary schools and secondary 
schools was only $64,470, which is on average 
19.2 percent less than other college graduates 
working in non-teaching fields, and with 
many 
teachers 
struggling 
with 
large 
amounts of student loan debt. 
(8) An experienced, well-qualified edu-
cation workforce must also be reflective of 
the diversity of the student body across race, 
ethnicity, and disability. 
(9) Experienced, well-qualified school lead-
ers and school-based mental health service 
providers are essential for providing strong 
educational opportunities and services for 
students and promoting teacher retention 
through improved professional supports and 
teaching conditions. 
(10) In 2020, surveys found nearly 27 percent 
of educators were considering leaving teach-
ing due to the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
55 percent of teachers with more than 30 
years of experience. 
SEC. 4. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR TEACHER 
AND SCHOOL LEADER RETENTION.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 102—RECOG-
NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE HOOSIER GYM AND THE 
35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RE-
LEASE 
OF 
THE 
FILM 
‘‘HOO-
SIERS’’ 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself and Mr. 
YOUNG) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 102 
Whereas The Hoosier Gym is a basketball 
gymnasium, museum, and community center 
located in Knightstown, Indiana, and is fa-
mous for being a filming location for the 1986 
basketball movie ‘‘Hoosiers’’, starring Gene 
Hackman and Dennis Hopper; 
Whereas, in 1920, the Knightstown Commu-
nity School had no gymnasium; 
Whereas, in February 1921, a half dozen 
Knightstown businessmen met to discuss the 
fact that Knightstown was lagging behind 
other towns in the development of children’s 
athletic education; 
Whereas, after much debate, a plan to 
build a ‘‘gymnasium and community house’’ 
was developed and approved; 
Whereas, to help fund the new gym, the 
Knightstown businessmen raised more than 
$14,400 in donations from more than 250 citi-
zens and several local businesses; 
Whereas, on December 1, 1921, construction 
of the gym was completed; 
Whereas, at 105 feet (32 meters) long and 80 
feet (24 meters) wide, the new gym was big 
enough to accommodate not only basketball 
games and spectators (with bleacher seating 
around the sides and ends of the playing 
floor), but also many civic and community- 
oriented events; 
Whereas it was not long before arrange-
ments were made for several professional 
basketball teams to play on the new floor, 
including the EmRoes, the Michigan Rails, 
and the Baltimore Orioles, and the town 
even persuaded players from various colleges 
to compete against local teams; 
Whereas, by 1966, the gym had become ob-
solete with the building of a new high school 
and gym; 
Whereas the Panthers of Knightstown 
played their last official regular-season bas-
ketball game at the gym in February 1966; 
Whereas, after 45 years of serving the com-
munity and providing a place for its young 
people to grow and develop, the gym was 
closed, and for the next 19 years, the gym 
saw little use; 
Whereas, in 1985, interest in the gym in-
creased when a film crew descended upon 
Knightstown, Indiana, looking for a place to 
film ‘‘Hoosiers’’; 
Whereas ‘‘Hoosiers’’ is an American sports 
film written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by 
David Anspaugh in his feature directorial 
debut, and both individuals were raised in In-
diana; 
Whereas the film tells the story of the 
unique phenomenon known as ‘‘Hoosier 
Hysteria’’—Indiana’s obsession with basket-
ball; 
Whereas the film is inspired by the 1954 
Milan High School team, which made an un-
likely run to win the Indiana High School 
Boys Basketball State Championship, which 
consisted of a single class of high school bas-
ketball for all schools throughout the State; 
Whereas about 1⁄3 of the film was filmed in 
the gym, and the film included many Hoo-
siers, including players on the team and 
most of the stand-ins; 
Whereas Dennis Hopper’s role earned him 
an Oscar nomination, and Jerry Goldsmith 
was also nominated for an Academy Award 
for his score; 
Whereas the film ‘‘Hoosiers’’ is often con-
sidered the greatest sports movie of all time 
and was added to the National Film Registry 
in 2001 by the Library of Congress as being 
‘‘culturally, historically, or aesthetically 
significant’’; 
Whereas, as a result of the success of this 
film, the old Knightstown gymnasium came 
to be known as The Hoosier Gym; 
Whereas The Hoosier Gym has kept the 
same look as it did when ‘‘Hoosiers’’ was 
filmed in 1985; 
Whereas, by 1988, the gym faced possible 
demolition when the 112-year-old school next 
door, then serving as an elementary school, 
was replaced by a new school north of town, 
but Historic Knightstown and Historic Land-
marks of Indiana stepped forward to help 
preserve the gym; 
Whereas now The Hoosier Gym usually 
hosts 80 high school basketball games with 
teams from throughout the country and over 
100 games in total each year; 
Whereas, each year, the gym holds the 
Hoosiers Reunion All-Star Classic, where In-
diana’s 
best 
high 
school 
athletes 
play 
against each other, with the teams named 
‘‘Hickory’’ and ‘‘Terhune’’, as in the film; 
Whereas many of these athletes have gone 
on to play in the National Basketball Asso-
ciation and the Women’s National Basket-
ball Association; 
Whereas ‘‘Hoosiers’’ and The Hoosier Gym 
have highlighted the cultural impact and im-
portance of basketball in the State of Indi-
ana to the world; 
Whereas, in 2021, The Hoosier Gym is cele-
brating its 100th anniversary, and the film 
‘‘Hoosiers’’ is celebrating its 35th anniver-
sary; and 
Whereas the film ‘‘Hoosiers’’, The Hoosier 
Gym, Hinkle Fieldhouse, and all the other 
locations throughout Indiana used for film-
ing highlight Hoosiers’ love for basketball 
and ‘‘Hoosier Hysteria’’ at its finest: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) The Hoosier Gym, which is celebrating 
its 100th anniversary in 2021, continues to re-
main an important historical and cultural 
location for the State of Indiana, Henry 
County, the Town of Knightstown, and the 
nearly 80,000 basketball enthusiasts and 
tourists throughout Indiana, the United 
States, and the world that visit the location 
every year; 
(2) the film ‘‘Hoosiers’’, which is cele-
brating its 35th anniversary in 2021, con-
tinues to remain one of the top ranked and 
most influential sports movies of all time, 
highlights the love of basketball in the State 
of Indiana, and provides a better under-
standing of ‘‘Hoosier Hysteria’’ to the world; 
(3) both the film and this historical loca-
tion deserve recognition for the continued 
legacies that greatly enrich the State of In-
diana, its local communities, and its citizens 
by providing the world with a better under-
standing of the love of basketball in Indiana 
and what it means to be a Hoosier; 
(4) continued admiration for this film and 
historical location reinforces the quote by 
Dr. James Naismith, basketball’s inventor, 
after visiting an Indiana High School State 
Basketball Championship game that ‘‘Bas-
ketball really had its beginning in Indiana 
which remains today the center of the 
sport’’, and such admiration continues to 
promote throughout the world a better un-
derstanding of the motto ‘‘In 49 States, it’s 
just basketball, but this is Indiana’’; and 
(5) the anniversaries of the film ‘‘Hoosiers’’ 
and The Hoosier Gym should be recognized 
due to the historical and cultural signifi-
cance each had and continue to have in in-
troducing the State of Indiana and its love of 
basketball to the rest of the country and the 
world.

S. RES. 103 
Whereas the National People’s Congress of 
China passed the Coast Guard Law of the 
People’s Republic of China on January 22, 
2021, for the alleged purposes of defending 
the national sovereignty, security, and mari-
time rights and interests of China;

in the ‘‘jurisdictional waters’’ of China, a 
term that is neither defined nor drafted in 
accordance with international law; 
Whereas 6 countries lay overlapping claims

rich in oil, gas, and natural resources and by 
which $3,400,000,000,000 in commerce transits

Whereas the United States will not tol-

SENATE RESOLUTION 104—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF 
THE 1921 TULSA RACE MASSACRE 
Ms. WARREN (for herself, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. CASEY, Mr. COONS, Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr. DUR-

VAN
HOLLEN, 
Mr. 
WARNER, 
Mr. 
WARNOCK, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 104 
Whereas, in the early 20th century, de jure 
segregation confined Tulsa’s Black residents 
into the ‘‘Greenwood District’’, which they 
built into a thriving community with a na-
tionally renowned entrepreneurial center 
known as the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’; 
Whereas, at the time, white supremacy and 
racist violence were common throughout the 
United States and went largely unchecked 
by the justice system; 
Whereas reports of an alleged and disputed 
incident on the morning of May 30, 1921, be-
tween two teenagers, a Black man and a 
white woman, caused the white community 
of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Tribune, to call 
for a lynching amidst a climate of white ra-
cial hostility and white resentment over 
Black economic success; 
Whereas, on May 31, 1921, a mob of armed 
white men descended upon Tulsa’s Green-
wood District and launched what is now 
known as the ‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre’’; 
Whereas Tulsa municipal and county au-
thorities failed to take actions to calm or 
contain the violence, and civil and law en-
forcement officials deputized many white 
men who were participants in the violence as 
their agents, directly contributing to the vi-
olence through overt and often illegal acts; 
Whereas, over a period of 24 hours, the 
white mob’s violence led to the death of an 
estimated 300 Black residents, as well as over 
800 reports of injuries; 
Whereas the white mob looted, damaged, 
burned, or otherwise destroyed approxi-
mately 40 square blocks of the Greenwood 
district, including an estimated 1,256 homes 
of Black residents, as well as virtually every 
other structure, including churches, schools, 
businesses, a hospital, and a library, leaving 
nearly 9,000 Black Tulsans homeless and ef-
fectively wiping out tens of millions of dol-
lars in Black prosperity and wealth in Tulsa; 
Whereas, in the wake of the Tulsa Race 
Massacre, the Governor of Oklahoma de-
clared martial law, and units of the Okla-
homa National Guard participated in the 
mass arrests of all or nearly all of Green-
wood’s surviving residents, removing them 
from Greenwood to other parts of Tulsa and 
unlawfully detaining them in holding cen-
ters; 
Whereas Oklahoma local and State govern-
ments dismissed claims arising from the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre for decades, and the 
event was effectively erased from collective 
memory and history until, in 1997, the Okla-
homa State Legislature finally created a 
commission to study the event; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2001, the commis-
sion issued a report that detailed, for the 
first time, the extent of the Massacre and 
decades-long efforts to suppress its recollec-
tion; 
Whereas none of the law enforcement offi-
cials nor any of the hundreds of other white 
mob members who participated in the vio-
lence were ever prosecuted or held account-
able for the hundreds of lives lost and tens of 
millions of dollars of Black wealth de-
stroyed, despite the Tulsa Race Massacre 
Commission confirming their roles in the 
Massacre, nor was any compensation ever 
provided to the Massacre’s victims or their 
descendants; 
Whereas government and city officials not 
only abdicated their responsibility to rebuild 
and repair the Greenwood community in the 
wake of the violence, but actively blocked 
efforts to do so, contributing to continued 
racial disparities in Tulsa akin to those that 
Black people face across the United States; 
Whereas the pattern of violence against 
Black people in the United States, often at 
the hands of law enforcement, shows that 
the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues; and 
Whereas this year marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the Tulsa Race Massacre: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the centennial of the Tulsa 
Race Massacre; 
(2) acknowledges the historical signifi-
cance of this event as one of the largest sin-
gle instances of State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people in American history; 
(3) honors the lives and legacies of the esti-
mated 300 Black individuals who were killed 
during the Massacre and the nearly 9,000 
Black individuals who were left homeless 
and penniless; 
(4) condemns the participants of the Tulsa 
Race Massacre, including white municipal 
officials and law enforcement who directly 
participated in or who aided and abetted the 
unlawful violence; 
(5) condemns past and present efforts to 
cover up the truth and shield the white com-
munity, and especially State and local offi-
cials, from accountability for the Tulsa Race 
Massacre and other instances of violence at 
the hands of law enforcement; 
(6) condemns the continued legacy of rac-
ism, including systemic racism, and white 
supremacy against Black people in the 
United States, particularly in the form of po-
lice brutality; 
(7) encourages education about the Tulsa 
Race Massacre, including the horrors of the 
massacre itself, the history of white suprem-
acy that fueled the massacre, and subsequent

f 
CONFIRMATION OF MICHAEL 
STANLEY REGAN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we 
just voted on Secretary Michael Regan 
to be the new EPA Administrator. I 
want to congratulate him on his vote. 
He is now the new EPA Administrator. 
I sit on the Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works. So we had 
hearings for Mr. Regan—Administrator 
Regan, I guess we want to call him 
now—and I have had a number of con-
versations with him. I actually voted 
for him to move out of committee to 
come to the floor for this vote that we 
took today. 
I like to come down to the floor to 
explain my votes because sometimes I 
support 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 
Cabinet officials. I introduced Sec-
retary of Defense Austin at his con-
firmation hearing. I served with him 
many years ago when I was a marine 
and he was a four-star general in the 
Army. I have a lot of respect for the 
Secretary of Defense. 
Then there are other times when I 
am a ‘‘no.’’ What I typically like to do 
is come and explain the noes but not 
always. On this one, for Secretary 
Regan, for Administrator Regan and 
his team, I want to explain it because 
I will say that I was impressed with 
him. I think he is qualified. He was es-
sentially the EPA administrator for 
North Carolina. Both of his Republican 
Senators introduced him at his hearing 
and voted for him, I believe, today, and 
I have had good conversations with 
him as well. 
Here is the thing: I was trying to get 
commitments from him. Now, this is 
very normal in the confirmation proc-
ess. You work with the nominees and 
try to get commitments. Sometimes 
they give them, and sometimes they 
don’t, but that is what we do—give ad-
vice and consent. We have been doing 
this since the Founding Fathers wrote 
the Constitution on what the Senate 
should be doing in these confirmation 
processes that we are going through 
right now with the Biden administra-
tion. So I wasn’t asking for a lot in 
terms of commitments from this ad-
ministration for the great State of 
Alaska, but it was important to me. 
Why was it important to me? 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has launched a war on working 
families in Alaska. Now, that sounds 
like a pretty dramatic statement, ‘‘a 
war on working families in Alaska.’’ 
What I am looking for is a ceasefire. 
My State, like a lot of States, is hurt-
ing economically. We are doing very 
well and I am very proud of Alaska on 
the health side. We are No. 1 in terms 
of vaccinations per capita in the coun-
try, which is remarkable, if you have 
been to my State, as it is so huge and 
the populations are so spread out, but 
we are working together, all of us, and 
we are achieving really remarkable re-
sults. We have been No. 1 in testing per 
capita throughout the whole pandemic, 
and we have had some of the lowest per 
capita death rates throughout the 
whole pandemic. But we are being real-
ly hit hard economically in the energy 
sector, the tourism sector, and the 
commercial fishing sector. 
So why am I looking for a ceasefire? 
In the first 2 months of the Biden ad-
ministration, there have been eight Ex-
ecutive orders, if you include the re-
cent statement by the President and 
the Prime Minister of Canada, which 
had a focus on Alaska, which have been 
focused on my State. Usually, it will be 
on economic development projects and 
usually on access to Federal lands. 
Eight. There is no State in the country 
that is getting that kind of attention 
from this administration, and we are 
hurting. It is not even close. Show me 
any other State represented in the U.S. 
Senate Chamber that has eight Execu-
tive orders directed at your State. It 
won’t exist. Trust me—my constitu-
ents don’t like all the attention. 
So I want to ask the President—not 
the Presiding Officer but the President: 
Mr. President, Mr. President Biden, sir, 
you were a U.S. Senator for three dec-
ades. Let me just ask you this ques-
tion: If a Republican administration 
came into office and focused its atten-
tion on shutting down Delaware with 
eight Executive orders inside of 2 
months, you would be on the floor 
every day like me, talking about it, 
asking for some relief. That is all we 
are asking for—a ceasefire on the hard- 
working families of Alaska. 
This is what I asked Secretary 
Regan. A commitment on these is not 
a big issue. I told him, if I could get a 
commitment on these things, I would 
come down to the floor and give a 
speech in favor of his confirmation. 
One was of a very big energy project 
in my State that has been permitted 
for almost 25 years. It started with the 
Clinton administration, in a place 
called the National Petroleum Reserve 
of Alaska, and was set aside by Con-
gress for oil and gas development. That 
is what the NPR-A is. We do it respon-
sibly, better than any place in the 
world, but this is a project that was 
started by the Clinton administration 
and moved forward by the Bush admin-
istration. There was a big NEPA envi-
ronmental impact statement by the 
Obama administration, called the Inte-
grated Activity Plan for NPR-A, which 
was approved. It was completely non-
controversial because that is what this 
part of Alaska is set aside for. Then the 
Trump administration finalized a very 
large but responsibly developed energy 
project. We started it this winter with 
no controversy. It has estimates of 
2,000 direct jobs, with thousands more 
indirect jobs. All we wanted was a com-
mitment to keep it going. That is it— 
simple, status quo. Couldn’t get it. 
Couldn’t get it. 
There is litigation with regard to 
this project right now. About 200 peo-
ple—almost 200 workers—have been 
sent home with pink slips during a re-
cession. Those were great jobs by the 
way. We tried to get a commitment on 
this. We couldn’t get it. By the way, 75 
percent of those 2,000 jobs were union 
jobs and high-paying—building trades, 
laborers, operating engineers, team-
sters. They are great Americans, by 
the way. Seventy-five percent. Non-
controversial. Twenty-five years of per-
mits. No one has been against this. So 
I just wanted a commitment on it. No. 
Like I said, it is a war on working fam-
ilies. 
Here is another one. Here is some-
thing that a lot of people don’t know 
about Alaska: 60 percent of the coun-
try’s wetlands, of America’s wetlands, 
are in my State—six zero. Now, we 
have the most beautiful State. We love 
our wilderness. We love the outdoors. 
We care about the Alaskan environ-
ment more than anyone else and—trust 
me—more than anyone else in the

March 10, 2021 
EPA. That is for sure. We have 175 mil-
lion acres of wetlands. So this creates 
challenges. 
Unlike most of the lower 48, we have 
not dredged and filled these areas in 
the past. If you look at the east coast, 
at its environments—no offense to 
some of my colleagues whose States 
are up the corridor here—holy cow. 
And you wonder about my environ-
ment? Geez Louise. But it is hard to do 
compensation for projects where you 
haven’t had dredge and fill before, be-
cause we have so many wetlands. So, in 
2018, the Corps of Engineers and the 
EPA had an MOU to address some of 
these mitigation challenges. It wasn’t 
controversial; 
it 
was 
creative. 
I 
thought Secretary Regan thought it 
was creative when I talked to him 
about it. So we just asked for a con-
tinuation of this. These are really sim-
ple commitments, good ideas—couldn’t 
get it from the Secretary. 
Now, look, here’s my own view. I 
think Mr. Regan wanted to—I ex-
plained these to him. I think he was 
reasonable, someone who has done this 
in his State and knows each State is 
unique. He cares about jobs. He cares 
about environmental justice. That is a 
big issue in my State when a lot of 
these communities that are getting 
targeted are actually Alaska Native 
communities. They are killing jobs in 
those communities. That is environ-
mental justice; that is for sure. So my 
instinct was he wanted to make these 
commitments, but I think he was told 
no. I don’t know that, but I’m pretty— 
well, I can’t say. But I think he was 
told no by the White House. This raises 
a much bigger concern about this 
nominee. 
My good friend, the esteemed Sen-
ator from West Virginia, Senator CAP-
ITO, was on the floor earlier. She also 
sits on the EPW Committee. She is the 
ranking member on the committee. 
She gave a really important speech on 
why she also voted no for Mr. Regan. 
And I think she had the same feeling I 
did. He knows the issues, is qualified, 
cares about different States’ chal-
lenges. But she raised a concern that I 
want to reiterate because I think it is 
going to be a really big concern, and I 
think it is going to come to a head here 
soon, and that is this: There is concern, 
not just among Republican Senators— 
it is all over the press, and she cited 
it—that Mr. Regan, who is now the 
EPA Administrator might not be the 
person in charge of the EPA. Now he’s 
Senate-confirmed. He is the one who 
has to come before the Congress for 
hearings, for oversight, but what are 
we talking about here? 
Well, the former EPA Administrator, 
Gina McCarthy, is in the White House. 
She is out talking to the press all the 
time. She’s an unaccountable czar on 
these 
issues, 
working 
behind 
the 
scenes—and, actually, not even behind 
the scenes. She was recently quoting 
about herself, saying she’s the orches-
tra leader of all of these issues. 
Wait, what about the EPA Adminis-
trator? I thought he was the Senate- 
confirmed person nominated by the 
President. The big, big concern is that 
he is not going to have the authority or 
the decision-making capacity and is 
going to be told what to do by a shadow 
EPA working out of the White House 
run by Gina McCarthy. That is not just 
me. That is not just Senator CAPITO. 
That is all over the press. Read it. In-
side EPA—she was quoting from that, 
Senator CAPITO was. No transparency 
there? All these previous Obama ad-
ministration EPA alumnae in the 
White House running it. 
By the way, if I am the new EPA Ad-
ministrator, Mr. Regan, I wouldn’t 
want that notion out there. But with 
all due respect, sir—and, again, con-
gratulations—it is out there, and you 
need to tamp this down because it is 
going to come to a head. 
Look, my State did not fare well 
under the Gina McCarthy EPA. There 
is a long list: the waters of the United 
States—I won’t get into the details of 
the disrespect to my constituents. 
Armed EPA officials with body armor, 
rifles, were going after gold miners and 
placer miners in Alaska because they 
thought they were violating the Clean 
Water Act. No kidding. Read about it. 
Chicken, AK—go Google that. We were 
not big fans. 
So I believe Mr. Regan wants to work 
with Alaskans. I believe he under-
stands the concept of cooperative fed-
eralism on these environmental issues. 
I don’t believe he would authorize 
armed guards to terrify small placer 
miners in the interior of Alaska the 
way 
the 
previous 
Administrator 
McCarthy did and talk to the press in 
a blatantly disrespectful way to my fel-
low Alaskans. It was shameful, in my 
view. But this issue is going to come to 
a head. 
Who is in charge? Regardless of 
whether you are a Democrat or Repub-
lican, if you voted for the EPA Admin-
istrator or you didn’t, we want him in 
charge because he is the Senate-con-
firmed official nominated by the Presi-
dent, not an unelected official in the 
White House who I guarantee wouldn’t 
have been able to get confirmed. So it 
is going to be a challenge. 
And it is not just Gina McCarthy. We 
had an EPW hearing today, and I raised 
the issue of the other czar—John 
Kerry, the former Senator. But he is 
not confirmed. He hasn’t been ap-
pointed to a Senate-confirmed job. He 
and the President are at loggerheads 
on a really big issue. President Biden, 
the President of the United States, re-
cently in a meeting reported by the 
press with labor leaders, said: I am all 
in on natural gas. That is important. 
That is a huge issue for our environ-
ment and our workers. The President 
of the United States said ‘‘I am all in 
on natural gas’’ to the men and women 
who build pipelines. He told them that 
recently in a White House meeting. He 
is the President of the United States. 
Now John Kerry—I think some peo-
ple think he is President of the world. 
He is flying around on his airplane 
right now, and he is telling people he is 
not for natural gas. Well, I wonder who 
is going to win that debate. 
But this goes to this issue: These are 
going to come to a head. Who is in 
charge 
here—the 
President 
of 
the 
United States or the President of the 
world—on natural gas? I hope it is the 
President of the United States because 
natural gas is going to be key for our 
workers, for our environment, for our 
national security. And at the EPA 
level, who is in charge? Mr. Regan? I 
hope so. Or Gina McCarthy? It is look-
ing more and more like she is in 
charge. 
So that is why a number of us, de-
spite being impressed, wanting to work 
with the new EPA Administrator voted 
no, and I certainly hope that the unac-
countable team of McCarthy and Kerry 
in the White House are not going to be 
running the policy, but it is going to be 
the people who were actually con-
firmed by the U.S. Senate because that 
is the way our system of government is 
supposed to work. 
So, Mr. President, for those reasons, 
although I again want to congratulate 
Mr. Regan, I respectfully declined to 
support his nomination, and we will 
see. We will see who is going to be ulti-
mately in charge. 
I want to work with him and his 
team. These issues are so important to 
my State. I want him to help convince 
others in the Biden White House for 
the ceasefire that my constituents 
need. 
We need to get to work, and I am 
hoping he is going to be a constructive 
partner in that regard. 
f 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, most 
mornings I get up kind of early, and I 
go for a run on the Mall, run by the 
Capitol, this beautiful building, the 
Senate, the House, the people’s house, 
which recently was open for all of us to 
enjoy. And now, as most Americans 
know, it is ringed with gates and razor 
wire and troops. It looks a little bit 
like the Green Zone in Baghdad, not 
the U.S. Capitol. 
Here’s the thing. When I go running— 
I do this most mornings; I did it this 
morning—you see these wonderful Na-
tional Guard men and women who are 
serving their country still here behind 
the fence, behind the razor wire. And 
they are literally about every 50 yards, 
sometimes closer, standing post all 
night—all night—hundreds of them, 
American soldiers. 
They are doing their duty, and we all 
appreciate it. I talk to them. I just say: 
Hey, how you guys doing? How is mo-
rale? You want to be here? You think it 
is time to go home? I think it is time 
for you to go home, and I am going to 
try and help you with that. 
Now, look, most are stoic. They are 
tough. They are soldiers doing their 
job. But make no mistake, they want 
to go home. They are standing their 
post all night, 1, 2, 3 in the morning,

every 50 yards, for what? For what? I 
don’t think they know what for, and 
neither do I. 
Now the assault that took place on 
our democracy on January 6 was a dark 
day for our country, no doubt. I will re-
member that for the rest of my life. 
But the Members of Congress did some-
thing really important that same day. 
We reconvened right here in the U.S. 
Senate, even amid some of the broken 
glass and smashed doors in the House. 
We finished our constitutional duty to 
count the electoral college votes. The 
rioters that day—who should be pros-
ecuted—did not win. That was impor-
tant. 
But that was 3 months ago, and our 
Nation’s Capitol is still decked in layer 
upon layer of barbed wire and metal 
fencing. More than 5,000 troops still 
roam the Capitol instead of being 
where they know they should be: home 
with their families, back to their jobs— 
these are National Guard members, so 
their work is obviously being dis-
rupted—and back to their States and 
their communities. 
The cost of keeping them here since 
January at this juncture is over a half 
billion dollars. But here’s the thing: I 
pay close attention to these issues. I 
keep asking: OK, I understand this; 
they were here after the 6th, and they 
were here for the inauguration, but 
what is the threat now? Give me an 
intel threat—a credible intel threat— 
that requires 5,000 troops and razor 
wire all across the U.S. Capitol, the 
people’s house. What is the credible 
intel? I have not gotten any credible 
intel that I am aware of. 
We learned yesterday that the Sec-
retary of Defense approved the request 
for these soldiers to be here for another 
60 days. Here is what you didn’t hear 
about in those reports. I have a lot of 
respect for the Secretary of Defense. As 
a matter of fact, as I mentioned in my 
remarks earlier, I introduced him at 
his confirmation hearing. But this de-
cision on whether there should be 
troops here or not is actually not his 
decision. It is our decision. It is the 
Members of Congress’s decision. That 
is the threshold issue: Should we still 
have the troops here? It is the majority 
leader’s decision. It is the Speaker of 
the House’s decision. So why do we 
still have troops here? Why is the Cap-
itol still in high security lockdown? 
I think it would be really important 
for the majority leader to come to the 
floor and not only tell us but tell the 
troops, tell the American people what 
is going on. 
Remember, this is not our House. 
This is not our building. This belongs 
to the people of America. We are privi-
leged to be here, certainly, but we need 
answers. 
And I will tell you who else needs an-
swers. The troops need answers. 
My own view is we need to get these 
troops home. We need to tear down the 
wall. We need to open the gate. And 
this is not just my view; this is a wide-
ly held view. Democrats and Repub-
licans all agree. 
Just look around the Capitol Hill 
neighborhoods. These signs are every-
where. So are other signs. ‘‘Free the 
People’s House.’’ ‘‘Don’t Fence the 
Capitol.’’ 
What is happening right now—we all 
love our military. Our military nor-
mally is a symbol of strength for 
America. But right now, the military 
here is not a symbol of strength. We 
are telling the world, through razor 
wire, that American democracy is frag-
ile and that it is afraid. American de-
mocracy is not fragile, and it is not 
afraid. So these troops are a symbol 
not just to Americans but to the rest of 
the world that the Capitol lives in fear 
or weakness. 
There was evidently some kind of 
vague—it wasn’t credible—threat on 
March 4 from some nutjob group, 
QAnon—however the heck you pro-
nounce it—and we had the entire House 
on the other side of this great building 
call it quits, went home, and said: We 
are not going to do any work. That is 
exactly the wrong answer. That is not 
what we did on January 6. 
So what we need is we need our lead-
ers in the House and in the Senate to 
come down here and tell us why we are 
still in an armed camp. One can’t help 
but wonder if there is something else 
going on here. Why do the leaders of 
the House and Senate still want thou-
sands of troops and razor wire around 
the Capitol? I hope they don’t fear the 
people they represent. I don’t fear my 
constituents. Is there intel that they 
have that we don’t know about? How 
long can we expect this green zone in 
our Nation’s Capital to continue? The 
American people need answers. 
But here is the key issue. At the end 
of the day, this is a law enforcement 
problem. It is not a military problem. 
To make it a military problem is dan-
gerous. If the Capitol Police need more 
officers, then let’s have that discus-
sion, but we are a citizen-controlled 
government, and our military, whom I 
respect so much, should not be used for 
an extended period of time here on the 
Capitol grounds to handle a law en-
forcement issue, especially at the most 
important symbol of democracy in 
America, probably the most important 
symbol of democracy in the world. 
So here is what we need to do. It is 
time to tear these walls down, open 
these gates, and send our brave Na-
tional Guard troops home. 
I yield the floor.

KINCIADE GREEN EARNS EAGLE 
SCOUT RANK 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Kinciade Green of Dover, FL for earning the 
rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the high-
est honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small 
percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of 
Eagle Scout. This honor requires years of ef-
fort to develop the necessary leadership, serv-
ice and outdoor skills. To earn it, Kinciade’s 
project included a flag retirement and a fire pit 
for use by the veterans of AMVETS post No. 
26. He built five Adirondack chairs, four 
benches and cleared an area around the fire 
pit. The leadership skills he has learned 
through the Boy Scouts already benefit our 
community and will continue to help in count-
less ways. 
Kinciade began his Scouting career as a 
Tiger Cub in Second Grade. He has been ac-
tive in Scouting as well as his High School Fu-
ture Business Leaders of America (FBLA) 
Club and Junior Air Force ROTC organiza-
tions. He will represent his District for the sec-
ond time this year at State FBLA competition. 
On behalf of the Fifteenth Congressional 
District of Florida, congratulations again to 
Kinciade Green for becoming an Eagle Scout. 
We are proud of his continued success and 
thank him for his dedication to making our 
community a better place.

REMEMBERING DONALD F. ‘‘DON’’ 
STEVENS 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Donald F. ‘‘Don’’ Stevens, 
a friend, a Patriot, and a pillar of his commu-
nity, who went to be with the Lord on January 
27, 2021. 
In the history of every community, there are 
leaders whose work shapes that community 
for generations to come. Don was one such 
leader. He has been called ‘‘the right man for 
the time’’ as Cherokee County transitioned 
from a rural community in the foothills of North 
Georgia to a metropolitan center. Don be-
lieved in the simple values of hard work, en-
thusiasm, and positivity—attributes he would 
come to exemplify in the Cherokee County 
community. 
A retired Delta Airlines pilot, Don carried his 
love for aviation into a second career as the 
Chairman of the Cherokee County Airport Au-
thority, where he fought to lengthen the munic-
ipal runway so it could accommodate more air 
traffic and larger jets. He believed the airport 
would be the gateway to bringing business 
into Cherokee County, and he was right. He 
loved planes, and he and his son maintained 
and flew a beautiful vintage Cessna 195, and 
often soared through the blue North Georgia 
skies. 
Don also loved classic cars. He could often 
be found at a weekend car show or in a pa-
rade. He was well known for his jokes, as he 
did his best to bring a laugh or a smile wher-
ever he went. 
Don was a generous man who loved people 
and believed in second chances. He was an 
outspoken advocate for criminal justice reform; 
and, he worked to establish Cherokee Coun-
ty’s DUI Court, which today helps many win 
their battles with substance abuse and regain 
control of their lives. Years ago, Don and his 
wife, Lila, began Cherokee Thanksgiving, 
serving holiday meals to those in need 
throughout the community. He also served on 
the board of the Cherokee Bank, was a volun-
teer firefighter, and has been recognized by 
the Chamber of Commerce as a ‘‘First Cit-
izen’’ of Cherokee County. 
Don is survived by his wife, Lila, son Keith, 
two daughters, Janet and Kelly, and six grand-
children, who will long remember his passion 
for people and the community, and will carry 
on his wonderful legacy. On behalf of Geor-
gia’s 11th Congressional District and the 
United States House of Representatives, I 
commend and thank Donald F. Stevens for his 
life lived in humble service to the community.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
WASH-
INGTON 
CHANNEL 
PUBLIC 
AC-
CESS ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Washington Channel 
Public Access Act. This bill would prohibit the 
Secretary of the Army from finalizing, imple-
menting or enforcing a proposed rule, or any 
other rule, that would restrict access to the 
Washington Channel (Channel) in the District 
of Columbia. The proposed rule is arbitrary, 
capricious and unnecessarily restricts rec-
reational and commercial access to the Chan-
nel without providing any security benefits. 
The proposed rule would establish a perma-
nent restricted area in the Channel adjacent to 
Fort McNair, which would restrict access to 
the navigable portion of the Channel by nar-
rowing the waterway where recreational and 
commercial vessels can traverse and prohib-
iting anchoring and mooring altogether. The 
U.S. Army Military District of Washington cites 
security needs at Fort McNair to justify the 
proposed rule. 
Neighborhoods like the Navy Yard and the 
Wharf have reinvigorated community engage-
ment on the waterfront, and the Channel is in-
creasingly used for regional transportation and 
recreation. The stretch of the Channel past 
Fort McNair is the only connection to the Poto-
mac River. The proposed rule would likely 
force kayaks, paddleboards and recreational 
boats into the same space as water taxis and 
river cruise ships, creating a potentially dan-
gerous situation. 
I hosted a public meeting in which commu-
nity members expressed overwhelming oppo-
sition to the proposed rule, but military officials 
did not address the question of whether less 
restrictive measures could provide the same 
security. I then wrote asking Secretary of De-
fense Lloyd Austin to direct the U.S. Army 
Military District of Washington and the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the pro-
posed rule and to prohibit these agencies from 
proposing a similar rule. In response, the U.S. 
Army indicated that the proposed rule will not 
be finalized until an appointee of President 
Biden can review it. Despite this positive re-
sponse, this bill is necessary to ensure the 
proposed rule, or any other rule that would re-
strict public access, does not go into effect. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HUMANE 
RESEARCH AND TESTING ACT OF 
2021 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Humane Research and 
Testing Act of 2021. The exact number of ani-
mals used in federally funded medical re-
search is unknown, but estimates range widely 
from 17 to 100 million animals utilized each 
year. Despite this widespread use, animal 
testing often fails to produce valid results pre-
dictive of human trials. In particular, more than 
30 percent of candidate drugs fail human clin-
ical trials because they are found to be toxic, 
despite promising pre-clinical studies on ani-
mals. On top of this, 65 percent of medica-
tions that advance to human trials fail due to 
lack of efficacy even after completing clinical 
trials on animals. 
Fortunately, there have been important ad-
vancements in medical research methods over 
the past several years. Animal testing is there-
fore no longer necessary in the many cir-
cumstances where non-animal alternatives are 
available. Some of these human-relevant 
methods include synthetic skin, synthetic or-
gans, and various methods of chemical toxicity 
testing that can decrease the number of ani-
mals used. Recognizing the need to promote 
alternatives, Congress passed the NIH Revi-
talization Act of 1993, which in part directed 
the National Institutes of Health to outline a 
plan for reducing the number of animals used 
in research. Unfortunately, little progress has 
been made since the passage of this law, and 
animals continue to be used extensively de-
spite new and improved methods and mount-
ing evidence that animal testing can often be

ineffective. The delayed adoption of these via-
ble alternatives means that every year several 
million animals are needlessly held in captivity 
and oftentimes senselessly harmed by experi-
ments in the process. 
To rectify this situation, I am introducing the 
Humane Research and Testing Act of 2021 
alongside my esteemed colleague and good 
friend Congressman VERN BUCHANAN. This 
legislation establishes the National Center for 
Alternatives to Animals in Research and Test-
ing within the NIH. First, the National Center 
will provide assistance, funding, and training to 
educate scientists in alternatives to the use of 
animals in research. The National Center will 
also facilitate collaborations that provide sci-
entists lacking resources with access to 
human-relevant methods. Second, the Na-
tional Center will be tasked with tallying the 
number of animals used in federally funded re-
search. Scientists receiving federal funding 
and government agencies that use animals in 
research will be required to submit regular re-
ports to the National Center that state the 
number of animals used in their research 
projects, disaggregated by species, and they 
will also be required to outline a plan for re-
ducing the number of animals they use. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to swiftly 
pass this legislation. The establishment of a 
new center dedicated to encouraging human- 
relevant alternatives to animal testing is need-
ed, so that the NIH can meet its goal of reduc-
ing the number of animals unnecessarily 
harmed in research every year.

IN RECOGNITION OF KIERSTEN 
ENGLEBERT 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Kiersten Englebert of 
Biglerville for her dedication to helping home-
less veterans. 
Kiersten, who holds the title of International 
United Miss Pennsylvania PreTeen, worked 
alongside fellow friends to provide vital items 
for her neighbors in need. She collected hy-
giene products, socks, hats, gloves and other 
items, filling 70 backpacks to support the work 
of local nonprofit For the Love of a Veteran. 
Kiersten is an outstanding young woman 
who already has demonstrated great dedica-
tion to the people of Adams County. It is my 
pleasure to recognize Kiersten for this selfless 
work to serve our veterans in need, and I wish 
her continued success in this mission.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND 
LEGACY OF MARIA CUNHA 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the leadership and legacy of a men-
tor and a friend, Maria Cunha, who will retire 
as Associate Dean and Director of the Out of 
School Youth Development Program at Mid-
dlesex Community College. Her most recent 
years at MCC have had an immense impact 
on students and faculty alike, advising and 
supporting them in their educational and voca-
tional pursuits. 
Maria was born in the Azores and moved 
with her family to the United States in 1967, 
eventually settling in Lowell among a vibrant, 
proud Portuguese community. After graduating 
from Lowell High School in 1974, she went to 
Regis College and became the first in her 
family to graduate from college four years 
later. 
Public service has always guided Maria’s 
career. She worked as a teacher, interpreter, 
and mentor serving on countless non-profit 
boards and dedicated her life to advocating 
fiercely for families, children, and immigrants 
in our community. 
For twelve years at the International Insti-
tute, Maria helped families navigate govern-
ment agencies on their path to becoming citi-
zens and creating a new life in the Greater 
Lowell region. She carried that passion for ad-
vocacy to her next role as Constituent Serv-
ices Director in former Representative Marty 
Meehan’s District Office. There, she continued 
her mission to provide the highest quality serv-
ices to our community and exemplified the no-
bility of service—picking up the phone and lis-
tening to someone in crisis and delivering as-
sistance; not giving up on someone in need of 
a hand; and advocating for resources and 
laws that fix our broken, inequitable systems. 
Over the years, Maria has served as a role 
model and mentor to so many, myself in-
cluded. She is what we all should aspire to be 
as public servants—a shining and tangible ex-
ample of how government, education, and 
community are supposed to work. 
Even in retirement, Maria will continue to 
champion those who don’t have a voice, her 
rich Portuguese heritage, and immigrants in 
search of a better life here in our community. 
Through her many years of service, Maria 
has made the City of Lowell a better place to 
call home. Thanks to her efforts, the City’s fu-
ture is bright, and I join Lowell residents and 
so many throughout our region in thanking her 
for her dedication to this incredible community.

HONORING ROBIN MACH 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, most 
of us had that special teacher growing up who 
went the extra mile and left a lasting impres-
sion on us. All these years later a few still 
come to mind right away. Recently a Missouri 
teacher, Robin Mach who teaches preschool 
in the Meramec Valley R–III School District, 
gave a whole new meaning to ‘‘going the extra 
mile’’ and became a real-life hero when she 
donated a kidney to one of her students. 
Kayleigh Kulage was born premature at 26 
weeks weighing only 15 ounces. From her 
very first day on earth Kayleigh had to fight for 
her survival and persevere in the face of the 
longest of odds, including living the first five 
years of her life with failing kidneys. In the 
summer of 2019, a Doris Hoffman Early 
Learning Center teacher met Kayleigh Kulage 
at a dentist office in Pacific, Missouri and en-
couraged the Kulage family to apply for edu-
cational services. In the fall of 2019, Ms. 
Robin, as Kayleigh calls her, began providing 
in-home educational services to Kayleigh. One 
year later, Kayleigh met the criteria to be 
placed on the transplant list. Ms. Robin talked 
to the Kulages about the donation process 
and ultimately decided to get tested to see if 
she would be a match for Kayleigh. As fate 
would have it, the two were a match, and on 
February 3, 2021, Robin and Kayleigh had 
successful surgeries to complete the trans-
plant. 
Robin Mach began working with pre-kinder-
garten students in 1999 and has long been 
known for going above the norm for her stu-
dents. Dr. Stephanie Bechard stated, ‘‘Ms. 
Robin has always had a very strong sense of 
community and supporting our students out-
side of school. She always thinks of others in 
need and sees how all things affect our stu-
dents and families. Her heart for our students, 
families, and community is monumental.’’ 
Monumental is an excellent way to describe 
the selflessness Robin Mach has displayed. 
She risked her life for her student and in doing 
so changed lives of that little girl and her fam-
ily forever. She is a true hero among us, and 
we are lucky to have her educating our stu-
dents and our community.

Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 1280— 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021. 
This legislation has been a long time coming 
and for many it has arrive too little too late. 
Our nation is a work in progress, and we will 
continue to fight for equality under the law in 
every and all aspects. 
This essential legislation has critical provi-
sion including supporting the need for more 
deescalation training for police officers, some-
thing that I have long fought for and which has 
proven time and time again to work. The bill 
will also block the transfer of weapons of war 
to police departments , end the no-knock war-
rants that led to the murder of Breonna Taylor, 
ban choke holds that killed Eric Garner and 
George Floyd, and finally end qualified immu-
nity which has shielded police officers from re-
ceiving justice for killing or injuring members 
of the community. 
As a member of the Congressional Black 
Caucus but more importantly as a black moth-
er, grandmother, and now great-grandmother,

HON. JOHN JOYCE

Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Thrivent Community- 
Advent Partners team for their service to the 
Adams County community. 
As an act of kindness for their neighbors, 
this group assembles and delivers care pack-
ages to patients who are undergoing cancer 
treatments in the Gettysburg Cancer Center 
and the Wellspan Adams Cancer Center. This 
tradition was established five years ago and

Advent Partners team has taken extra care to 
safely assemble packages that include items 
such as masks, blankets, lotion, hand sani-
tizer, tissues, lip balm and other items. De-
spite challenges, they have persevered to con-
tinue this mission. 
Thrivent Community-Advent Partners’ com-
mitment to community service is invaluable to 
the Adams County community. It is an honor 
to thank these Pennsylvanians for their com-
mitment and highlight this invaluable work,

IN RECOGNITION OF WARREN 
PIERNER’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor World War II veteran Warren 
Pierner as he celebrates his 100th birthday on 
March 13, 2021. 
Warren grew up in Green Bay and attended 
Green Bay East High School. In 1942, he 
joined the United States Coast Guard, where 
he served in the Atlantic on a patrol frigate 
called the Grand Rapids, and in the Pacific on 
an attack transport called the Aquarius. Mr. 
Pierner ran the boilers on these ships for 
nearly four years and attained the rank of 
Water Tender 1st Class. Warren continued his 
service to his country and community as a let-
ter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, where 
he worked for 36 years before his retirement 
in 1984. 
After his military service, Warren began to 
build a family. He married Myra Larsen in 
1948 and together they had 7 children during 
their 60 years of marriage until her passing in 
2008. His family enjoyed the summers to-
gether fishing, swimming, and playing cards 
while camping or staying in a rented cabin in 
Northern Wisconsin. An avid sportsman and 
sports fan, Warren love to golf, bowl, fish, and 
swim. Mr. Pierner has been a longtime Chi-
cago Cubs fan but makes up for it by being an 
ardent Green Bay Packers fan, UW Green 
Bay Phoenix fan, and Wisconsin Badger fan. 
Beloved husband, father, and soldier, War-
ren is a tribute to the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ 
and a grateful nation and state thank him for 
his service. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding Warren Pierner 
for his service in WWII and wishing him a 
happy and healthy 100th birthday.

SUPPORT OUR MILITARY WORKING 
DOGS ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Support Our Military Working 
Dogs Act’’ in commemoration of National K9 
Veterans Day later this week. The United 
States K9 Corps was established on March 
13, 1942. 
Military working dogs serve with our troops 
on the front lines and provide recuperating 
services for our veterans and their former han-
dlers. Caring for these dogs in the field and 
once they return home is our responsibility. 
The ‘‘Support Our Military Working Dogs Act’’ 
would ensure that our nation’s military working 
dogs receive the best possible care and direct 
the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to 
work with veterans’ service organizations and 
other nonprofits to support their long-term vet-
erinary care, once adopted by their former 
handler’s into loving homes. 
Specifically, the ‘‘Support Our Military Work-
ing Dogs Act’’ would authorize DOD to provide 
charitable support for retired or injured military 
working dogs after their adoption, by coordi-
nating third-party donations to cover the cost 
of long-term veterinary care. The bill would 
also ensure that the U.S. government covers 
all transportation costs associated with trans-
ferring 
retired 
military 
animals, 
including 
horses, to their new adopted homes, building 
upon the success of the Military Working Dog 
Retirement Act of 2015. 
Lastly, the bill for this Congress includes a 
new provision clarifying that DOD’s Joint Trau-
ma Education and Training Directorate may 
also conduct research on the treatment and 
avoidance of injuries for military working dogs. 
Former Congressman Ralph Abraham (R–LA) 
sponsored this provision as an amendment to 
the House-passed ‘‘National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021,’’ but it was ul-
timately removed during conference negotia-
tions with the Senate. I am pleased to include 
this much-needed clarification in my bill. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness, which has juris-
diction over military working dogs, I urge all 
members of the House to join me in cospon-
soring this important legislation. Congress 
must support our K9 veterans during and after 
their service. 
HONORING SUE WILSON AND THE 
HELPING HAND AS IOWANS OF 
THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Sue Wilson and The Helping Hand of 
Warren County in Indianola, Iowa for their aid 
to the underserved people of their community. 
Sue and The Helping Hand are the pinnacles 
of what it means to be an Iowan, and I wish 
to recognize them as my Iowan of the Week 
for their remarkable dedication to the better-
ment of their state. 
The Helping Hand is a volunteer organiza-
tion whose mission is to distribute food, cloth-
ing, and household items to residents in their 
community for no cost. While they have been 
serving the people of Warren County for years 
via their walk-in food pantry, they have begun 
outreach to expand their services to address 
underlying issues resulting in food insecurity 
such as substance misuse and mental health 
services. 
The Helping Hand is expanding its network 
to multiple resources and services that its 
community members can utilize. Not only is it 
a support system for people who need food 
and clothing, it is also a resource for those 
who look to better their mental health as well, 
not just their physical. 
Sue serves on Governor Reynolds’ Advisory 
Council for Brain Injuries and has started to 
administer a voluntary brain injury screening 
tool to the community members that utilize 
The Helping Hand. While people are waiting in 
the food pantry line, they are invited to partici-
pate in the screening and are then asked a 
series of questions. This new programming is 
in the early stages, but Sue and The Helping 
Hand are hoping that they will soon be able to 
provide data of the percentage of people who 
have suffered from a brain injury and have 
limited resources to assist them in their better-
ment. So far, The Helping Hand has screened 
approximately 100 people in their food pantry 
line. 
Sue and The Helping Hand’s desire to bet-
ter the lives of those in Warren County is in-
spiring. Whether it be facing food insecurity di-
rectly or distributing over one thousand boxes 
of food and supplies, they are setting the 
standards high on what it means to serve and 
be served within a community. Sue and The 
Helping Hand are constantly and consistently 
striving to better themselves and the people 
they serve, and they do this through complete 
devotion, an unwavering work ethic, and huge 
hearts. I am proud to recognize Sue Wilson 
and The Helping Hand of Warren County as 
my Iowan of the week.

as joy to her community. 
Born on February 25, 1911, Mrs. Coggins 
was born in Summerfield, Louisiana to Andy 
and Eula Davis. After marrying Woodrow 
Coggins on October 8, 1949, in El Dorado, 
they raised ten children together. Today, her 
large family boasts of 20 grandchildren, 30 
great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grand-
children. 
It was this beautiful, large family which in-
spired her to work so hard throughout her life. 
After her husband passed away in 1967, Mrs. 
Coggins continued to present a hard work 
ethic to provide for her family, creating a home 
where ‘‘everyone felt welcome.’’ While this is 
mostly due to her cooking skills and her tre-
mendous love of sports, according to her chil-
dren, Mrs. Coggins always seeks to live her 
life in a way that is loving to all people. Her 
wisdom and innate love for her neighbors 
shine in her life motto: ‘‘no secrets, living right, 
not hating people, and obeying God.’’ 
I take this time today to celebrate the 110th 
birthday of Mrs. Willie Bell Coggins and wish 
her a life full of blessings. May we all look to 
her as the truest example of kindness, hard 
work, family, and love for our fellow man.

SALVATION ARMY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the Waynes-
boro Salvation Army upon the completion of a 
successful Red Kettle Campaign. 
This year, the Waynesboro Service Unit of 
the Salvation Army continued its long history

gram

the 
Waynesboro, 
Greencastle and Mercersburg communities.

not only achieve but exceed their goal. The 
Salvation Army attributes this success to the 
generosity of the community members and the 
help of volunteers who dedicated countless 
hours over a five-week period. 
The Waynesboro Salvation Army is a valued 
part of our community and faithfully serves in-
dividuals and families in need. It is a pleasure

HONORING BOYD MCDANIELS III 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I rise this 
morning to call attention to the passing of First 
Sergeant Boyd McDaniels III, a Fellow Brother 
Mason and friend to all that would come to 
know him. His funeral services are taking 
place as I speak. 
First Sergeant McDaniels was a dedicated 
and highly accomplished soldier who served in 
several high-profile conflicts, including Desert 
Storm I and II, Operation Iraqi Freedom and 
several other classified missions. A skilled sol-
dier, Boyd rose through the ranks of the Army 
and served in both the famed 82nd Airborne 
Division and 101st Airborne Division and was 
also a trained marksman. He received his 
training in lithography at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, 
where he also served years later as a drill ser-
geant. 
Boyd was a highly decorated veteran who 
served with great honor and distinction. During 
his service, he was the recipient of two Bronze 
Star Awards. Among his other military honors 
was a U.S. flag, Service Star, Office Star Pro-
fessional Badge, Basic Marks, Quail Badge, 
Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Badge, 
Parachutist Terrorism Service Medal, Meri-
torious Service medal, Army Commendation 
Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the 
Army Good Conduct Medal. 
The Army is also where Boyd met his future 
wife and the love of his life, Deborah, when 
they were both serving in Germany. He retired 
from the U.S. Military on June 1, 2003. 
Boyd was also called to another type of 
service while serving in the military: becoming 
active in two fraternal organizations. While in 
Germany he joined the Prince Hall Free and 
Accepted Masons of North America becoming 
the lodge’s youngest ever ‘‘Most Worshipful 
Grand Master.’’ He would later rise to the rank 
of 33rd degree. He was also a member of 
Shriners International. 
Boyd was a huge Dallas Cowboys and avid 
South Carolina Gamecocks football fan. He 
also loved his Lamar High School Silver 
Foxes, his alma mater (Class of 1984). Gre-
garious, outgoing and the life of the party, 
Boyd loved to have a good time and wanted 
others to enjoy themselves as well. 
Family was the most important thing to him. 
He talked to his mom every day and adored 
his wife and two sons. They were the center 
of his universe. 
First Sergeant McDaniels leaves to mourn 
his passing a wife, Deborah McDaniels of Co-
lumbia, S.C.; two sons Bryan McDaniels of 
Columbia, S.C. and Ryan McDaniels of Rock 
Hill, S.C.; his parents, Rev. Boyd McDaniel, Jr. 
and Mamie Lee McDaniels of Darlington, S.C.; 
three siblings, Tara (Michael) Bines of Colum-
bia, S.C., Zachary (Andrea) McDaniels of Bal-
timore, MD, Connie (Troy) McDaniels Williams 
of Florence S.C.; and sister-in-law Charlene 
Swain (David) and two brothers-in-law, Troy 
(Linda) Cummings and Ronald Cummings of 
Eatonton, GA. He also has eight nieces and 
nephews—Marcus, Kyla, Kelsen, Chelsea, 
Kiera, 
Kevis, 
Emma 
and 
Troy 
Jr. 
Mr. 
McDaniels was preceded in death by two sib-
lings, Robin Lee Williams and Phillip ‘‘Ricky’’ 
Rueben. 
May Boyd’s soul rest in peace.

HONORING THE LIFE SAVING AC-
TIONS OF NOBLESVILLE POLICE 
OFFICERS 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor heroic actions taken by two police of-
fices in my district, Officer Tiffany Bledsoe and 
Officer David Lindenschmidt of the Noblesville 
Police Department. Both Officers Bledsoe and 
Lindenschmidt were able to save lives in the 
early morning hours of February 27, 2021. 
Officer Bledsoe was dispatched to a hotel 
with reports of an overdose. As the first officer 
on scene, Officer Bledsoe began chest com-
pressions and rescue breaths before admin-
istering Narcan to the patient who then re-
gained consciousness and began breathing 
again. About 20 hours later, a similar call 
came in, prompting Officer Lindenschmidt to 
respond to a report of an overdose. Officer 
Lindenschmidt also administered Narcan to 
the patient playing a vital role in avoiding an 
opioid overdose death. 
The quick actions of Officers Bledsoe and 
Lindenschmidt saved lives that day. These two 
officers are examples of how our policemen 
and women serve and protect us every day. I 
am honored to commend their actions.

HONORING DR. WILLIE BLAIR’S 
LIFE AND LEGACY OF SERVICE 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
along with Congresswoman SARA JACOBS, to 
honor Dr. Willie Blair. A Vietnam Combat vet-
eran, former congressional staffer, and leader 
of the Black American Political Association of 
California-San Diego Chapter (BAPAC). 
Dr. Blair was born in 1951 in Knoxville, Ten-
nessee and was one of eight children. 
He received a Bachelor of Arts in political 
science from Maryville College in 1973, at-
tended Officer Candidate School in Newport, 
Rhode Island and was commissioned as a 
U.S. Naval Officer. 
Dr. Blair served as a Naval Officer for eight 
years, including a tour of duty in Vietnam as 
a small boat leader, where he participated in 
the evacuation of Saigon and Cambodia in 
May of 1975. 
After being honorably discharged in 1981, 
Dr. Blair moved to San Diego and earned a 
Master of Business Administration degree and 
a subsequent Doctorate in Humanities and 
Arts from Point Loma Nazarene University. 
Dr. Blair was a special assistant to former 
Congressman Bob Filner, focusing on vet-
erans’ issues, including veteran homeless-
ness, retiring in 2013. 
As a San Diego community leader, Dr. Blair 
left a legacy of social justice and equity. 
From 2008 to 2017, he served as board 
chairman for BAPAC, an organization that 
strives to ensure the Black community in San

Diego County remains a relevant economic, 
social, and political force in Southern Cali-
fornia. 
Dr. Blair strongly believed in the mission of 
BAPAC: to work for the maximum effective 
representations of Black people in the political, 
economic, and educational systems of San 
Diego County and find solutions to issues re-
lated to jobs, education, and healthcare. 
In 2017, he was elected as BAPAC’s Presi-
dent where he continued his work in civil and 
human rights and used his stature to promote 
quality leadership in the community. 
Dr. Blair devoted his life to bridging the 
achievement gap for ethnic and minority 
groups and elevate the positive educational 
outcomes of disenfranchised communities. 
Dr. Blair devoted his life to mentoring lead-
ers in the black community ensuring status 
within the Democratic party and in other insti-
tutions and he was passionate about reaching 
common ground among Latinos, Asians, and 
other ethnic and minority groups. 
Dr. Blair is survived by his daughter, U.S. 
Airforce Officer Deborah Smith, siblings Janet, 
Trece and Roger, and several nieces and 
nephews.

HONORING FRANCESCO GENUARDI 
FOR HIS TENURE AS CONSUL 
GENERAL 
OF 
ITALY 
IN 
NEW 
YORK 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and honor Francesco Genuardi, 
who after five years of admirable service as 
the Consul General of Italy in New York, has 
been designated Ambassador of Italy to the 
Kingdom of Belgium. 
Mr. Genuardi, who is married with two 
daughters, is an Italian diplomat with over 27 
years of professional experience. Born in 
Brussels on July 7, 1967, he graduated with a 
degree in Law from the University of Milan in 
1991. 
He joined Italy’s diplomatic service in 1993, 
and for the next five years worked at the Euro-
pean Union’s Directorate-General for Eco-
nomic Affairs, where he dealt with international 
issues of importance associated with environ-
mental protection and safety. 
From 1998 to 2002, he served as Deputy 
Consul at the Consulate General in Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. From 2002 through 2005, he 
returned to his native Brussels to serve as 
First Secretary at the Permanent Mission of 
Italy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO). 
Mr. Genuardi returned to Rome in 2005 and 
began an eleven-year tenure at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, working with seven suc-
ceeding Ministers as a liaison officer for par-
liament. In 2014, Mr. Genuardi was appointed 
by then Minister Paolo Gentiloni to serve as 
head of the Office for Parliamentary Relations 
of the Italian Foreign Ministry. 
In March of 2016, Mr. Genuardi was ap-
pointed Consul General of Italy in New York, 
covering the states of New York, New Jersey, 
and Connecticut, as well as the territory of 
Bermuda, which collectively have a population 
of nearly 100,000 Italian residents and over 3 
million Italian Americans. 
During his tenure at the Consulate General 
of Italy in New York, Mr. Genuardi dem-
onstrated a special attention towards all of the 
Italian and Italian American people of New 
York and the Tri-State area by actively engag-
ing with the many existing Italian and Italian 
American associations, and contributing to the 
creation of new interest groups related to cul-
ture, education, athletics, and more. 
Mr. Genuardi also contributed greatly to the 
budding careers of young Italians and Italian 
Americans through the Consulate’s ‘‘Meet the 
New Italians’’ program, a series of workshops 
and professional development seminars aimed 
at Italian professionals. 
Mr. Genuardi’s commendable tenure in New 
York and lifetime of diplomatic service leaves 
no doubt that he will take on his new role in 
Brussels with professionalism, grace, and re-
solve. His presence will be deeply missed 
among the Tri-State Italian American commu-
nity. I am proud to rise today in recognition of 
the career and service of Francesco Genuardi, 
incoming Ambassador of Italy to the Kingdom 
of Belgium.

IN RECOGNITION OF EDWIN 
GOTWALT 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Edwin Gotwalt, a beloved member of the cen-
tral Pennsylvania community. 
Mr. Gotwalt was born May 20, 1936 in York 
County. His strong work ethic began early, as 
he took his first job at the age of six to help 
support his family. After a career as a man-
ager at Giant Food Stores, he founded Mister 
Ed’s Elephant Museum and Candy Emporium. 
Mr. Ed owned and operated this iconic 
candy shop from 1975 until he retired in 2004. 
After his retirement, Mr. Ed sought out oppor-
tunities to encourage and mentor the next 
generation of the business community. He 
also was a dedicated member of the commu-
nity. Mr. Ed served on many community 
boards, including his beloved Totem Pole 
Playhouse. 
After a remarkable life, Mr, Ed passed away 
on February 26, 2021—the same day that 
marked his 54th wedding anniversary to his 
wife Patricia and the 46th anniversary of 
founding his business. It is a pleasure to 
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Ed Gotwalt for 
his many accomplishments and contributions 
to our region. I offer my condolences to his 
family, friends, and loved ones as they mourn 
this great loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. WILL 
BAKER 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise before you today to honor Mr. Will Baker 
as he retires after more than 40 years as di-
rector of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation 
(CBF), the nation’s premier nonprofit Bay 
watchdog. Guided by its mission to ‘‘Save the 
Bay,’’ the CBF strives to ensure that future 
generations may have the privilege of enjoying 
this national treasure. 
Mr. Baker began his career at the CBF as 
an intern in 1976, shortly after graduating from 
Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. Just 
five years later, in 1981, he was appointed as 
the organization’s next president. Under his 
leadership, the foundation has grown from a 
small organization with three staffers to the 
nation’s largest independent conservation or-
ganization dedicated solely to saving the 
Chesapeake Bay. The CBF now boasts 
300,000 members and 200 employees in of-
fices located in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsyl-
vania, and the District of Columbia. CBF over-
sees 16 separate environmental education 
centers throughout the region that host an 
award-winning program that has provided 
meaningful watershed experiences to more 
than 1 million students. 
With Mr. Baker at the helm, the Chesa-
peake Bay Foundation has received well-de-
served recognition for its outstanding work. 
Most notably, the CBF received the 1992 
Presidential Medal for Environmental Excel-
lence, the nation’s most prestigious environ-
mental accolade. 
Mr. Baker has been recognized by organiza-
tions too numerous to mention in their entirety. 
He has received honorary degrees from the 
University of Baltimore, Washington College 
and St. Mary’s College. He was presented the 
Circle of Excellence Award by The Daily 
Record, 
named 
to 
Baltimore 
Magazine’s 
Power 50, and received the Speaker’s Medal-
lion from the Maryland House of Delegates. 
Outside of his work for the Chesapeake Bay 
Foundation, Mr. Baker has contributed his 
time and talents as a member of the Johns 
Hopkins Medicine Executive Committee, as a 
trustee to the Central Maryland Transportation 
Alliance and as a member of the Board of 
Visitors to the University of Maryland Balti-
more County. 
On a personal note, I have deeply enjoyed 
getting to know and working with Mr. Baker 
over the years. He is not just a passionate 
and effective steward of one of our nation’s 
most precious resources, he is a kind and de-
cent person. Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
join me today to honor the career of Mr. Will 
Baker. His commitment to the betterment of 
his community and to the Chesapeake Bay 
should serve as an example to us all.

have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
include in the RECORD the following letters of 
support from religious organizations for H.R. 1, 
as amended. 
FAITHFUL DEMOCRACY, 
December 4, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES E. ‘‘CHUCK’’ SCHUMER, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI, LEADER
MCCON-
NELL, LEADER SCHUMER AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The Faithful Democracy interfaith coa-
lition writes in support of the For the People 
Act, the transformational democracy reform 
bill that would help return power to every-
day Americans. While we represent a diver-
sity of beliefs and traditions, we unite 
around the common goal of creating a 
healthier, thriving democracy. The thirty 
national faith-based organizations and con-
gregations below urge Congress to prioritize 
passage of this pro-voter, anti-corruption 
legislation in the 117th Congress to advance 
the nation towards that goal. 
We recognize that, on a practical level, 
only a healthy, well-functioning democracy 
has the capacity to attend to the pressing 
needs that our faith calls us to address: the 
COVID pandemic, systemic racism, climate 
change, 
hunger, 
violence, 
poverty, 
healthcare and more. The challenges that 
face our nation are serious and deeply con-
cerning—and 
include 
partisan 
gridlock 
among policy-makers. Faithful Democracy 
partners are committed to structural democ-
racy reforms that lay a solid foundation for 
rebuilding our nation. 
Democratic governance is the best existing 
system to peacefully hold a diversity of 
ideas, to enable healthy compromise among 
competing interests and to instill a sense of 
belonging among all its members. However, 
ours falls short since our democratic systems 
are open to manipulation by those seeking to 
amass power or undercut the common good 
for special interests. 
The 2020 election has underscored the ur-
gent need for transformational democracy 
reform. Across the nation, Americans experi-
enced unprecedented voter suppression, his-
toric levels of dark money spent to drown 
out the voices of everyday Americans, and 
rampant ethical abuses by special interests. 
The comprehensive For the People Act ad-
dresses many of these problems, opening the 
door for legislative solutions. The bill has 
three 
overarching 
goals: 
protect 
and 
strengthen the sacred right to vote, end the 
dominance of big money in politics, and im-
plement anti-corruption, pro-ethics meas-
ures to clean up government. 
This historic legislation passed the House 
of Representatives by a wide margin in 
March 2019 and was cosponsored by 46 mem-
bers of the Senate. President-elect Joe Biden 
has stated that a ‘‘first priority’’ of his ad-
ministration will be to lead on a comprehen-
sive set of democracy solutions like those re-
flected in the For the People Act. House and 
Senate Democratic leaders have similarly 
said they will prioritize this once-in-a-gen-
eration legislation. The undersigned organi-
zations with the Faithful Democracy coali-
tion urge Congress to take bipartisan action 
on the election reform, anti-corruption and 
voting rights provisions encompassed in the 
For The People Act as a first priority in the 
new Congressional session.

the transformational democracy reform bill 
that would help return power to everyday 
Americans. As people of faith, we believe 
every person’s inherent dignity can only be 
upheld if every person’s right to vote is en-
sured and protected. Therefore, we are urg-
ing Congress to prioritize passage of this pro- 
voter, anti-corruption legislation in the 
117th Congress to advance the nation to-
wards 
that 
moral 
goal. 
Along 
with 
prioritizing action on the For the People Act 
(H.R. 1), we call on Congress to also pass the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4). 
Our nation faces numerous pressing chal-
lenges like the COVID pandemic, systemic 
racism, the climate crisis, and healthcare in-
equities. We can only solve these problems 
with a healthy, inclusive democracy where 
all people have a voice. Leaders must take 
swift action to protect the right to vote and 
to strengthen our democratic foundations 
from abuse and manipulation by the power-
ful and the wealthy at the expense of the his-
torically marginalized and most vulnerable 
people in our nation. 
The 2020 election has underscored the ur-
gent need for transformational democracy 
reform. Across the nation, Americans experi-
enced unprecedented voter suppression, his-
toric levels of dark money spent to drown 
out the voices of everyday Americans, and 
rampant ethical abuses by special interests 
in the 2020 elections. One sweeping bill, the 
For the People Act, addresses many of these 
problems. 
The common-sense reforms in this legisla-
tion, which are deeply popular and have 
passed in many states and localities, aim to 
accomplish three overarching goals: (1) pro-
tecting and strengthening the sacred right to 
vote, (2) ending the dominance of big money 
in politics, and (3) implementing anti-cor-
ruption, pro-ethics measures to clean up gov-
ernment. For far too long, Black and Brown 
communities have been silenced through 
voter disenfranchisement and government 
prioritizing corporation interests above our 
communities needs. H.R. 1 would work to 
remedy centuries of injustice and advance 
racial equity in our country. This is a moral 
issue and Congress must act now. 
This historic legislation gained momentum 
early in the 116th Congress, passing the 
House of Representatives by a wide margin 
in March 2019 and garnering cosponsorshlp 
by nearly half of the Senate upon introduc-
tion. President-elect Joe Biden has stated 
that a ‘‘first priority’’ of his administration 
will be to lead on a comprehensive set of de-
mocracy reforms like those reflected in the 
For the People Act. Again, on behalf of Faith 
in Public Life, I urge Congress to prioritize 
bipartisan action on the For the People Act 
in the 117th Session. 
Sincerely, 
REV. JENNIFER BUTLER. 
FRANCISCAN ACTION NETWORK, 
Washington, DC, November 25, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: The Francis-
can Action Network writes in strong support 
of the For the People Act (H.R. 1/S. 949), the 
transformational democracy reform package 
that would help return power to everyday 
American families. We strongly urge you to 
prioritize passage of this pro-voter, anti-cor-
ruption legislation in the 117th Congress. 
Along with the passage of the For the People 
Act, Congress must also prioritize the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4) and leg-
islation granting statehood to Washington, 
D.C. (H.R. 51). 
The 2020 election has underscored the ur-
gent need for transformational democracy 
reform. Across the nation, Americans experi-
enced unprecedented voter suppression, his-
toric levels of dark money spent to drown 
out the voices of everyday Americans, and 
rampant ethical abuses by special interests. 
One sweeping bill, the For the People Act, 
addresses many of these problems. This his-
toric legislation passed the House of Rep-
resentatives with unanimous Democratic 
support in March 2019 and was cosponsored 
by all members of the Senate Democratic 
Caucus. President-elect Joe Biden has stated 
that a ‘‘first priority’’ of his administration 
will be to lead on a comprehensive set of de-
mocracy solutions like those reflected in the 
For the People Act. House and Senate Demo-
cratic leaders have similarly said they will 
prioritize this once-in-a-generation legisla-
tion. In fact, several days after the election, 
Speaker Pelosi reiterated her strong support 
for the For the People Act by saying the 
House ‘‘will proudly pass our election re-
form, anti-corruption and voting rights leg-
islation by passing H.R. 1 on the first day of 
the new Congress.’’ 
The common-sense reforms in this legisla-
tion, which are deeply popular and have 
passed in many states and localities, aim to 
accomplish three overarching goals: (1) pro-
tecting and strengthening the sacred right to 
vote, (2) ending the dominance of big money 
in politics, and (3) implementing anti-cor-
ruption, pro-ethics measures to clean up gov-
ernment. Without structural democracy re-
form, our nation will remain unable to fully 
address important substantive priorities for 
the American people, such as expanding af-
fordable healthcare and stopping the spread 
of COVID–19, protecting the environment, 
and creating millions of good-paying jobs. As 
Franciscans, our shared Christian faith 
teaches us that we must recognize each per-
son as a gift from God, and that we must em-
phasize the importance of the essential hu-
manity and dignity of each person. And, as 
Pope Francis calls us to ‘‘meddle in politics’’ 
we interpret this concept as a requirement 
that all Americans must have an equal say 
in the public square. 
Again, on behalf of the Franciscan Action 
Network, we ask you to ensure that the For 
the People Act is the first priority when the 
new Congress is convened. 
Sincerely, 
JASON MILLER, 
Franciscan Action Network, 
Director of Campaigns and Development. 
FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON 
NATIONAL LEGISLATION, 
Washington, DC, February 18, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: We ask that 
you support and co-sponsor S. 1. Representa-
tive democracy is the very foundation of our 
nation. It is a foundation cracked with a leg-
acy of exclusivity, the 3/5ths compromise, 
disenfranchisement, and suppression. Access 
to voting has been used to secure power for 
some and deprive it from others. As Quakers, 
we believe that there is that of God in every-
one. No one has less value. Unfortunately, 
voter suppression undermines democracy and 
disproportionately affects Black and brown 
communities. 
State legislative bills across the country 
have the effect of shutting out millions like 
voter caging in Ohio or poll closures in Geor-
gia. For instance, the Georgia legislature has 
been proposing a number of measures to 
make it harder to vote like restricting new 
voters from voting in the runoff. We have 
seen similar restrictive measures across the 
country to avoid an electoral outcome and 
rig the process for one party. This is im-
moral. 
Our democracy can live up to its potential 
only if the government ensures open access 
to public office and electoral processes; curbs 
the influence of money and corporate power; 
safeguards the integrity of the voting proc-
ess without raising unnecessary barriers; 
provides 
full 
participation 
for 
disenfranchised people, including those cur-
rently and formerly incarcerated; and pro-
tects and secures electoral and voting proce-
dures from foreign and domestic inter-
ference. 
We need to expand voting rights to all 
Americans and take more measures to en-
sure the integrity of our elections. We must 
reduce voter suppression tactics like poll 
closures, exact match, signature match, 
voter-caging, and a number of other ele-
ments deceptively presented as measures to 
protect the voting process. The influence of 
big money in politics has a chilling effect on 
the electorate who cannot pay-to-play. That 
is why we, Friends Committee on National 
Legislation, urge you to support the For the 
People Act of 2021. 
It is no secret there is an ever-growing 
trend of mistrust and frustration with gov-
ernment nationwide. The For the People Act 
offers a key opportunity to restore faith in 
American democracy. 
Elements of S.1 that would go a long way 
to restore the integrity of our elections: 
Establishes Election Day as a national hol-
iday to allow everyone the vote 
Institutes same-day and automatic voter 
registration 
Simplifies and improves voter registration 
processes 
Prohibits voter intimidation and voter- 
caging 
Eliminates gerrymandering through redis-
tricting commissions 
Requires 15 consecutive days of early vot-
ing 
Declares Congress’ intent to protect access 
to native voters 
Restores voting rights to the formerly in-
carcerated 
Requires disclosure of donations above 
$10,000 to organizations engaged in election-
eering 
Establishes small-donor financing, funded 
from fines on corporate malfeasance and tax 
crimes, to stop the deepest pockets from con-
trolling the debate 
Prohibits foreign money in elections via 
shell companies, social welfare organiza-
tions, or super PACs. 
For far too long, flaws, or even active 
voter suppression, in our election system 
have been neglected. The Friends Committee 
on National Legislation supports the For the 
People Act because it reflects our belief that 
every American should have their voices 
heard through secure elections. Laws should 
include measures to assure voting rights and

LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 
OF WOMEN RELIGIOUS, 
January 6, 2021. 
The Leadership Conference of Women Reli-
gious (LCWR) is deeply concerned about the 
state of our nation and the future of our de-
mocracy and we are committed to using our 
voice in the public square to speak about 
matters of justice and moral good. In this in-
creasingly divided nation, we are called to 
take action to repair our democracy and con-
tribute to the work of building a more per-
fect union. That is why we urge you to sup-
port the For the People Act. 
We consider the protection of the rights of 
the people to free and fair elections, equi-
table and fair representation, and account-
ability for elected leaders to be among the 
most critical moral issues of our day. That is 
why we are urging Congress to prioritize pas-
sage of this pro-voter, anti-corruption legis-
lation. That is why we are asking you to 
take immediate action on the For the People 
Act (H.R. 1) and the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4). 
Only a healthy democracy has the capacity 
to attend to the pressing needs our faith, and 
our national values, call us to address: the 
COVID–19 pandemic, systemic racism, eco-
nomic inequality, climate change, justice for 
migrants, hunger and poverty, violence of 
every type, access to healthcare and more. 
We must take swift action to protect voting 
rights, strengthen our democratic institu-
tions, and put an end to manipulation by 
wealthy and powerful special interests at the 
expense of the historically marginalized and 
most vulnerable people in our nation. 
The 2020 election underscored the urgent 
need for transformational reform. The For 
the People’s Act coupled with the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act go a 
long way toward addressing the voter sup-
pression, dark money and ethical abuses that 
threaten our democracy. 
The common-sense reforms proposed in 
this legislation aim to accomplish three 
overarching 
goals: 
(1) 
protecting 
and 
strengthening the sacred right to vote, (2) 
ending the dominance of big money in poli-
tics, and (3) implementing anti-corruption, 
pro-ethics measures to clean up government. 
They will go a long way toward fixing our 
democracy. 
On behalf of LCWR’s 1300 members, who 
represent more than 32,000 Catholic sisters in 
the United States, we urge members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle to prioritize 
bipartisan action on the For the People Act. 
We pledge to continue to work with all peo-
ple of good will to promote the common good 
as we to continue to build God’s beloved 
community. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN, 
Washington, DC, December 4, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: I am writing 
on behalf of the 180,000 advocates of the Na-
tional Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) in 
strong support of a transformational democ-
racy reform package that would help return 
power to everyday Americans—For the Peo-
ple Act (HR1/S949). I urge you to prioritize 
passage of this critical measure in the 117th 
Congress. 
The common-sense reforms in HR 1/S949, 
which are deeply popular and have passed in 
many states and localities, aim to accom-
plish three overarching goals: (1) protecting 
and strengthening the sacred right to vote, 
(2) ending the dominance of big money in 
politics, and (3) implementing anti-corrup-
tion, pro-ethics measures to clean up govern-
ment. Without structural democracy reform, 
our nation will remain unable to fully ad-
dress important substantive priorities crit-
ical amid a pandemic, including protecting 
and expanding affordable health care, stop-
ping the spread of COVID–19, and ensuring 
jobs and wages that allow people to support 
themselves. 
The 2020 election has underscored the ur-
gent need for democracy reform. Across the 
nation, 
Americans 
experienced 
unprece-
dented voter suppression, historic levels of 
dark money spent, and rampant ethical 
abuses—all with the goal of drowning out 
particular voices. For the People Act ad-
dresses many of these challenges. NCJW was 
proud to support this historic legislation 
when it was first introduced. And, we were 
thrilled to mobilize our advocates in support 
of the bill, which passed the House in March 
2019. 
President-elect Joe Biden has stated that a 
‘‘first priority’’ of his administration will be 
to lead on a comprehensive set of democracy 
solutions like those reflected in the For the 
People Act. With your support, we can help 
make these important improvements a re-
ality. 
Again, I hope you will make HR 1/S949, For 
the People Act, a priority when the 117th 
Congress convenes. Our democracy must 
work for everyone. 
Sincerely, 
JODY RABHAN, 
Chief Policy Officer, 
National Council of Jewish Women. 
NETWORK LOBBY FOR 
CATHOLIC SOCIAL JUSTICE, 
Washington, DC, November 20, 2020. 
Chairwoman ZOE LOFGREN, 
House Administration Committee, 
Washington DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
LOFGREN: 
NET-
WORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice is 
writing to express our steadfast support for 
the For the People Act (HR1/S.949), the 
transformational democracy reform package 
that would lay the necessary foundation to 
heal and rebuild our nation. We strongly 
urge you to prioritize passage of this pro- 
voter, anti-corruption legislation in the 
117th Congress. It is needed now, more than 
ever. 
The 2020 election in COVID only under-
scored the urgent need for transformational 
democracy reform. Across the nation, Ameri-
cans witnessed unprecedented voter suppres-
sion, historic levels of dark money spent to 
drown out the voices of everyday Americans, 
and rampant ethical abuses by special inter-
ests. We know that the For the People Act 
addresses many of these problems. The 
American people have shown that our de-
mocracy can still deliver, despite all of its 
shortfalls, 
and 
Congress 
must 
in 
turn 
strengthen and protect our democracy. 
NETWORK Lobby is a social justice advo-
cacy organization with a legacy of advancing 
the common good through federal policy; our 
work is predicated on a functional democ-
racy that is accountable to the people. This 
accountability and responsiveness is dimin-
ishing as the influence of special interest and 
dark money in politics grows and as the 
voices of individual American voters are sti-
fled through voter suppression and gerry-
mandering. Our democracy needs reforms to 
recognize and respond to the needs of the 
most vulnerable among us in the midst of a 
pandemic and an economic crisis. 
The reforms in this legislation are popular 
with the American people and are already in 
place in many states and localities. This 
comprehensive package aims to accomplish 
three overarching goals: protecting and 
strengthening the sacred right to vote; end-
ing the dominance of big money in politics; 
and implementing anticorruption, pro-ethics 
measures to clean up government. Without 
structural democracy reform to begin restor-
ing the faith of the electorate in government 
accountability, our nation will remain di-
vided and unable to overcome the multiple 
crises currently at hand. 
The momentum gained in 2019 and the 
unanimous support by Democrats in both 
chambers must now be driven forward with 
fresh energy. President-elect Joe Biden has 
stated that a ‘‘first priority’’ of his adminis-
tration will be to lead on a comprehensive 
set of democracy solutions like those re-
flected in the For the People Act. House and 
Senate Democratic leaders have similarly 
said they will prioritize this once-in-a-gen-
eration legislation. NETWORK Lobby for 
Catholic Social Justice—on behalf of our 
90,000 members across the nation—is asking 
you to ensure that the For the People Act is 
a first priority when the new Congress is 
convened. These reforms are desperately 
needed and overwhelmingly desired by the 
American people. 
Sincerely, 
SR. SIMONE CAMPBELL, 
Executive Director, 
NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. 
SISTERS OF MERCY, 
Silver Spring, MD, February 19, 2021. 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI: The Sisters of 
Mercy of the Americas is a congregation of 
Catholic women religious committed to 
work in communion with others who seek a 
more just and inclusive world, and as such, 
we write in strong support of the For the 
People Act (H.R. 1/S. 1). 
This democracy reform package is critical 
to overturning voter suppression that dis-
proportionately 
disenfranchises 
Black, 
Latino and young Americans and to limiting 
the undue influence of monied interests. 
The Sisters of Mercy believe ‘‘racism is an 
evil affecting us all.’’ We work to mobilize 
sisters and associates in recognizing and dis-
mantling institutional racism and believe 
that 
upholding 
the 
voting 
rights 
of 
marginalized Americans is a critical step to-
wards dismantling the systemic racism that 
underlies so much of our nation’s infrastruc-
ture. 
It became all too clear over the past three 
months how fragile our democracy is. We 
came frighteningly close to an overturned 
election as President Trump and his loyal-
ists, including many elected officials, de-
manded that ballots be discarded from cities 
with large Black populations. This played 
out to its logical end with the violent siege 
on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6th. 
The common-sense reforms in the For the 
People Act aim to (1) protect and strengthen 
the sacred right to vote, (2) end the domi-
nance of big money in politics, and (3) imple-
ment anti-corruption, pro-ethics measures to 
clean up government. Without structural de-
mocracy reform, our nation will remain un-
able to fully address important substantive 
priorities for the American people. These in-
clude expanding affordable healthcare and 
stopping the spread of COVID–19, eliminating 
systemic racism, protecting the environment 
and 
minimizing

UNITARIAN UNIVERSALISTS 
FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, 
Washington, DC, February, 8, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: We write in 
support of the For the People Act (HR1/S1), 
the transformational democracy reform bill 
that would help return power to everyday 
Americans. We consider fair representation 
and accountability for elected leaders to be a 
moral issue of utmost importance. After the 
January 6th attack on the US Capitol, the 
urgency of democracy reforms to address our 
broken systems could not be more apparent. 
We are urging Congress to prioritize passage 
of this pro-voter, anti-corruption legislation. 
On a practical level, only a healthy, well- 
functioning democracy has the capacity to 
attend to any of the pressing needs our faith 
calls us to address: the COVID pandemic, 
systemic racism, climate change, hunger, vi-
olence, poverty, healthcare and more. On a 
moral level, leaders must take swift action 
to protect the right to vote and to strength-
en our democratic foundations from abuse 
and manipulation by the powerful and the 
wealthy at the expense of the historically 
marginalized and most vulnerable people in 
our nation. 
The 2020 election cycle and the insurrec-
tion on January 6th have underscored the ur-
gent need for transformational democracy 
reform. Across the nation, Americans experi-
enced unprecedented voter suppression, his-
toric levels of dark money spent to drown 
out the voices of everyday Americans, and 
rampant ethical abuses by special interests. 
The number of Americans misled into ques-
tioning the results of a safe and secure elec-
tion demonstrates the fragility of our de-
mocracy and the urgency of taking concrete 
actions to shore-up public trust. One sweep-
ing bill, the For the People Act (HR1/S1), ad-
dresses many of these problems. 
Our organization Unitarian Universalists 
for Social justice focuses on four major 
issues, all of which would be helped signifi-
cantly by fixing our democracy: economic 
justice, immigration justice, environmental 
justice, and democracy. This historic legisla-
tion has significant momentum in Congress 
with priority designation in both chambers. 
On behalf of UUSJ we urge Congress to pass 
the For the People Act (HR1/S1) quickly in 
the 117th Session.

PABLO DEJES´ US, 
Executive Director. 
CHURCH & SOCIETY, 
THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, 
Washington, DC, February 22, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER
OF CONGRESS: As General 
Secretary of The United Methodist Church’s 
General Board of Church and Society, I write 
in support of the For the People Act (HR1), 
the transformational democracy reform bill 
that would help our political system be pro-
tected by strengthening the power of every-
day Americans to determine our nation’s 
leaders. Our ministry of justice and peace is 
connected to communities of faith across the 
United States and around the world who con-
sider fair representation and accountability 
for elected leaders to be a moral issue of ut-
most importance. I am urging Congress to 
prioritize passage of this legislation which 
increases the overall transparency and effec-
tiveness of our democratic systems. 
The General Board of Church and Society 
of The United Methodist Church is the public 
policy agency of The United Methodist 
Church, a global denomination with more 
than eight million members in the United 
States. 
We, as a denomination, understand that 
the strength of our political life together is 
determined by ‘‘the full and willing partici-
pation’’ of its citizens (2016 Book of Dis-
cipline, T 164a ‘‘Political Responsibility’’). 
The United Methodist Church affirms the 
right to vote for all adult citizens as a basic 
human right. 
‘‘We hold governments responsible for the 
protection of the rights of the people to free 
and fair elections . . . The form and the lead-
ers of all governments should be determined 
by exercise of the right to vote guaranteed 
to all adult citizens.’’ (2016 Book of Dis-
cipline, T 164a ‘‘Basic Freedoms and Human 
Rights.’’) 
The United Methodist Church calls for a 
vision of beloved community founded on eco-
nomic and racial justice, including strength-
ening voting rights protections, in light of 
continued systemic racism that threatens to 
undermine provisions for fair and free elec-
tions for all citizens. 
The For the People Act (HR1) makes sure 
that every citizen is able to exercise their 
civic duty free of voter suppression and 
murky campaign financing. 
Too many Americans, particularly in com-
munities of color, have been unjustly pre-
vented from exercising their right to vote 
through extraordinary and deeply discrimi-
natory voter suppression laws. Strong and 
dedicated community leaders are prevented 
from pursuing public office simply because of 
the overwhelming financial burden of run-
ning a campaign. On top of these deep sys-
temic issues, the number of Americans in the 
2020 election cycle misled into questioning 
the results of a general election with historic 
voter turn-out demonstrates the fragility of 
our democracy and the urgency of taking 
concrete actions to shore-up public trust. 
The For the People Act (HR1) addresses 
many of these problems. 
The common-sense reforms in this legisla-
tion, developed through years of bi-partisan 
efforts and passed in many states and local-
ities, aim to accomplish three overarching 
goals: (1) protecting and strengthening the 
right to vote, (2) reducing the influence of 
big money in politics, and (3) implementing 
anti-corruption, pro-ethics measures. 
This historic legislation has significant 
momentum in Congress with priority des-
ignation in both chambers. As a United 
Methodist faith leader, I urge Congress to 
pass the For the People Act (HR1) quickly in 
the 117th Session. 
Sincerely Yours, 
REV. DR. SUSAN HENRY- 
CROWE, 
General Secretary, General Board of Church 
and 
Society,

United 
Methodist

IN RECOGNITION OF W. GENE 
KELLY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the memory of W. Gene 
Kelly. Gene passed away on February 17, 
2021 after a lifetime of service to the Blair 
County community. 
Gene lived in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania for 
most of his life. He graduated from Martins-
burg High School and attended college at 
Pennsylvania State University. After college, 
he worked for the Altoona Area School District 
for 25 years as an elementary school teacher 
and principal. 
Additionally, Gene served our great nation 
for six years in the U.S. Army Reserves, and 
he also founded the W. Gene Henry Mobile 
Home Parks in Martinsburg. 
Throughout his life, Gene was dedicated to 
community service. He made generous con-
tributions to support the Martinsburg Borough 
Municipal Building and Police Station, as well 
as the Martinsburg Volunteer Fire Company. 
He contributed to many community projects, 
including highway widenings, the Morrisons 
Cove Memorial Park, and a pair of buildings in 
the Fairview Cemetery. 
Gene was an admirable, generous, and 
faithful member of our community. It is my 
privilege to honor Gene Kelly’s life and legacy, 
and to recognize his many contributions to our 
nation and region.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HOT

HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Hot Springs pub-
lic servant and historian, Mr. Clay Farrar. He 
passed away on February 27, 2021, leaving 
behind a community which mourns the pass-
ing of a leader, a servant, a mentor, and a 
friend. 
For nearly 50 years, Mr. Farrar worked on 
a variety of projects around the Hot Springs 
community. As a partner at Farrar and Wil-
liams PLLC, he specialized in trust and estate 
planning. Serving as Chairman of the Hot 
Springs Chamber of Commerce in 1988, Mr. 
Farrar became instrumental in the develop-
ment and success of Hot Springs. He was 
considered an expert in local history, pro-
ducing a series on the National Park Rotary 
Club, writing monthly columns of local history 
for the Hot Springs Sentinel-Record, and con-
tributing to the Garland County Historical Soci-
ety. In 1985, Mr. Farrar had a profound impact 
on the preservation of Hot Springs National 
Park’s designation when efforts were made to 
return it to its original designation as the Hot 
Springs Reservation. Even after his retirement, 
Mr. Farrar continued to serve as chairperson 
of the committee tasked with the repurposing 
of the ACTI Complex, or the Army/Navy Hos-
pital, which graces the Downtown Hot Springs 
skyline. 
In addition to his life of service for his be-
loved city, Mr. Farrar was known to be an in-
spiration and a mentor to many in the commu-
nity, teaching the power of devotion and hard 
work through each project he tackled. It is 
from men like Mr. Clay Farrar that we can dis-
cover the importance of learning from our own 
history to define our future. From him, we de-
rive the definition of true servant leadership. 
I take this time today to honor the life of 
service exemplified by Clay Farrar. I thank him

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MITCH RUSSELL 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mitchell Lee Russell who passed 
away at the age of 67 on February 23, 2021. 
Mitch was the embodiment of a model public 
servant, striving to serve the citizens of Ham-
ilton County. He protected his fellow citizens 
for over 30 years before retiring in 2006. 
Mitch started his career following in the foot-
steps of his older brother, Richard, who was 
also a police officer. Mitch began his service 
in Arcadia, Indiana as a Deputy Marshal. He 
then went on to serve in the Hamilton County 
Sherriff’s Department where he spent 29 
years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant before 
retiring. His service to his community did not 
end with retirement as he was appointed Mar-
shal of the Arcadia Police Department. In 
2012, his service continued when he took a 
job as director of Security for Riverview Health 
in Noblesville, where he served until his pass-
ing. 
His public service also extended beyond law 
enforcement. Mitch served as President of the 
Arcadia Town Council, a member of the 
Kiwanis Club, a board member of the Arcadia 
baseball and softball board, and as a coach 
for his children and grandchildren. The town of 
Arcadia has always been very close to his 
heart. 
On behalf of the 5th District, I offer my 
deepest sympathies to Mitch’s wife of 37 
years, Melanie Anne, the Russell family, and 
the community of Arcadia.

NORTHERN MARIANAS FAMILY 
ASSISTANCE ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today I intro-
duce the Northern Marianas Family Assistance 
Act. This legislation will make long overdue 
amendments to the Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (‘‘TANF’’) program to include 
the Northern Mariana Islands. 
The TANF program provides a lifeline to 
low-income families with children to meet on-
going needs. Benefits such as childcare, work-
force education and training, and food assist-
ance gives families a chance when times get 
tough. But the benefits of this block grant pro-
gram are not available in the Marianas. 
My bill addresses this inequity. 
As we continue to address the economic 
challenges caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic, inclusion in the TANF program would 
ensure that working families with children in 
the Marianas can continue to put food on the 
table and have a roof over their head. 
RECOGNIZING JUSTIN GRAY 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to acknowledge this year’s winner of the 
New Mexico Cattle Growers Association’s 
Livestock Inspector of the Year award. District 
Supervisor Justin Gray has served his com-
munity and his team diligently and is well de-
serving of this award. 
After graduating from Clarendon College in 
Texas with a major in Ranch and Feedlot 
management, Justin began his career with the 
New Mexico Livestock Board in 2014. In 2020, 
he was promoted to District Supervisor. Justin 
demonstrated his diligence when he re-
sponded to an overturned livestock vehicle on 
U.S. 70. According to a New Mexico State Po-
lice Officer on the scene, ‘‘Justin Gray re-
sponded to the incident and presented himself 
in an excellent manner. He assisted in the re-
moval of deceased and live cattle from the 
overturned trailer for approximately six hours 
without any complaint. Inspector Gray worked 
tediously from start to finish of the incident.’’ 
Stories like this one exemplify Justin’s hard 
work and dedication and I congratulate him on 
this award.

HONORING JOSEPH VAUGHN FOR

VETERANS 
AFFAIRS 
MEDICAL CENTER 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Joseph Vaughn for his 16 years of 
service, including three years as Director at 
the W.G. (Bill) Hefner Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Salisbury, North Carolina. I have 
seen his extraordinary leadership firsthand 
and know how much he means to this com-
munity and to our veterans. 
Mr. Vaughn began his career in 1983 with 
the United States Navy, where he served for 
ten years and completed four Mediterranean 
cruises before being awarded the Navy 
Achievement Medal. He retires today after 
over a decade of combined service at the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
After being appointed Director on March 19, 
2018, he immediately began the important 
work that would one day transform both the 
Salisbury VA and the surrounding community. 
Mr. Vaughn led implementation of the VA MIS-
SION Act, saw facility complexity increase 
from 1c to 1b, opened ambulatory surgery at 
VA Health Care Centers in Charlotte and 
Kernersville, saw the Community Living Center 
obtain a 5-star quality rating for multiple rating 
periods, and stimulated major improvements in 
Hospital Rating (HCAPS). In response to the 
coronavirus 
(COVID–19) 
pandemic, 
Mr. 
Vaughn’s quick actions saved many lives and 
protected countless others through mass vac-
cination events. 
Renee and I would like to extend our most 
heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Vaughn for his 
years of exemplary service at the Salisbury 
VA. I know I speak for our entire community 
in wishing him continued success and happi-
ness as he moves on to his next great adven-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Joseph Vaughn upon his retirement 
as Director at the W.G. (Bill) Hefner Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center.

HONORING THE BRAVE AND LIFE 
SAVING ACTIONS OF ANDERSON 
POLICE OFFICER JOE TODD 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the heroic actions of Anderson Police 
Officer Joe Todd, who is being credited with 
saving a life on January 31, 2021. Officer 
Todd, like so many of our great police officers, 
put himself in harm’s way to serve and protect 
a citizen. 
Officer Todd observed a house fire in 
progress around 9:00 p.m. that evening. He 
approached the scene and noticed a woman 
standing on the front porch with the door open 
as the flames engulfed the house. Officer 
Todd ran to the distraught homeowner and 
asked if there was anyone else inside. The 
woman then ran back inside the house, visibly 
shaken by what was occurring. Officer Todd 
ran after the woman into the burning house 
and carried her to the front yard to safety. 
Our police officers put their lives on the line 
everyday to serve and protect their fellow citi-
zens. Officer Joe Todd is an example of the 
selfless work these men and women do every 
day. On behalf of Indiana’s 5th District, it is 
my honor to commend these brave actions.

IN RECOGNITION OF OPEN HANDS 
MINISTRIES 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Open Hands Ministries of 
Stahlstown, Pennsylvania for its service to the 
Westmoreland County community. 
To help families struggling to buy clothes for 
young infants, Open Hands Ministries began a 
program in 1994 to donate necessary items to 
families in need. Each donation includes a crib 
blanket, a receiving blanket, diapers, onesies, 
sleepers, bibs, hats, and socks. These con-
tributions have helped thousands of families 
as they welcome a new addition into their 
home. 
Over the years, the volunteers at Open 
Hands Ministries have donated almost 11,000 
layettes to area families. I thank the volunteers 
at Open Hands Ministries for their decades of 
service to southwestern Pennsylvania, and 
wish them continued success in this vital mis-
sion.
