DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable AL GREEN

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, as we set our sights on the 
week ahead, we pray Your guidance 
and strength to accomplish the work 
and the responsibilities You have set 
before us. 
Ready our minds for action. May we 
prove to be doers of Your compelling 
will. May our thoughts center not just 
on the concerns of our constituents, 
but may we open ourselves to the 
broader purpose to which You have 
called us, that we would commit all 
our efforts to the common good. 
Give 
us 
self-discipline, 
that 
as 
timelines and schedules, committee 
meetings, and caucuses all vie for our 
time and attention, that we would be 
discerning in our endeavors to use our 
gifts, talents, and energy as You would 
have us do. 
Sustain us by the hope You set before 
us. Open our eyes to the multitude of 
opportunities and possibilities You so 
richly provide. 
Then may we never rest, satisfied in 
our own accomplishments or on human 
approbation, but may we find our pur-
pose in Your divine plan and our iden-
tity grounded in the grace found only 
in You. 
We offer to You our plans for the 
week ahead and pray with certitude 
that we are, indeed, undergirded by the 
power of Your sovereign name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. PLASKETT led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ROE MUST BE THE LAW OF THE 
LAND 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
last week I was heartbroken when I 
learned a 10-year-old rape victim from 
my home State was forced to cross 
State lines for an abortion because of 
Ohio’s 6-week ban, which became law 
when the Supreme Court overturned 
Roe. 
Grief quickly became anger because I 
know she will not be the last victim of 
an extreme agenda to criminalize abor-
tion nationwide. The overturn of Roe 
was a direct attack on Americans’ re-
productive rights, and it is clear that 
too many support criminalizing contra-
ceptive care, arresting doctors for of-
fering reproductive care, and even 
charging women with murder because 
of their fundamental right to decide. 
We must make Roe the law of the 
land to restore women’s fundamental 
rights and protect other victims from 
harboring the ramifications of rape. 
f 
FLEXIBLE APPRENTICESHIP 
PROGRAMS 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, we must 
equip workers with the tools for suc-
cess by empowering employers to play 
a more influential role in our Nation’s 
workforce development system. To do 
this, we must embrace a flexible, em-
ployer-driven apprenticeship model. 
Under the previous administration, a 
task force composed of business lead-
ers, educational institutions, and trade 
associations 
recommended 
reducing 
the regulatory burden faced by busi-
nesses, allowing them to be flexible in 
their apprenticeship program require-
ments to meet the varying needs of dif-
ferent industries. 
Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship 
Programs, IRAPs, help cut through the 
overly prescriptive and burdensome red 
tape many new and small businesses 
face. But the Biden administration 
killed IRAPs and is actively working 
to limit job creators’ input by doubling 
down on registered apprenticeships and 
foolishly ignoring any alternatives. 
Ending this innovative and successful 
program will hurt students, jobseekers, 
and job creators. 
f 
DEMOCRATS STAND FIRMLY WITH 
WOMEN 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the efforts by House 
Democrats to protect women from the 
extreme Republican antiwomen agen-
da.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5948 
July 12, 2022 
I say to my colleagues that Repub-
licans across our Nation seek to crim-
inalize abortion nationwide with no ex-
ceptions, not for rape, not for incest, 
and they are very determined. 
But while they seek to control 
women and their personal choices, 
President Biden and House Democrats 
firmly stand with women. We trust 
women. 
Just last Friday, President Biden 
signed an executive order aimed at pro-
tecting access to reproductive health 
services. This week, House Democrats 
are passing legislation to protect a 
woman’s ability to travel freely and 
voluntarily 
throughout 
the 
United 
States, 
including 
for 
reproductive 
health. 
We trust women because that is who 
we are as Democrats. We are the party 
that stands by women and their human 
rights. We trust women. 
f 
RISING INFLATION HURTS 
EVERYONE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address the record-high 
inflation hurting working families in 
Iowa caused by the Biden administra-
tion. 
When President Biden took office in 
January 2021, inflation was at 1.4 per-
cent. As of May 2022, inflation is 8.6 
percent, the highest in 40 years. Presi-
dent Biden has been exclaiming that 
the rise in inflation would be a tem-
porary problem, but the data does not 
reflect his claims. 
Inflation is hurting families in Iowa 
and all across the country. With food 
and housing prices increasing, families 
are having to make sacrifices to make 
ends meet. It is unacceptable for the 
Biden administration to advocate for 
more government spending that caused 
inflation rather than addressing these 
pertinent issues, such as rising prices. 
This rising inflation in fuel prices is 
hurting rural farmers in Iowa. Gas and 
diesel prices are now expected to cost 
farmers an extra $900 a year, and $500 
to families, as well. 
I call upon the Biden administration 
to take necessary steps to address in-
flation, such as increasing domestic en-
ergy production and stopping wasteful 
government spending. The Biden ad-
ministration’s policies are hurting the 
families it is meant to serve. 
I would also like to take this time to 
wish a happy birthday to Michael 
Pinette, and I wish my sister Mari-El-
eanor Martino a very happy birthday. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN MUST DO 
BETTER 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as middle Tennesseans struggle to af-
ford record-high gas prices caused by 
the Biden administration’s antienergy 
prices. 
If you recall, in April of this year, 
President Biden announced he would be 
raiding the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve to help ‘‘ease the pain American 
families are facing at the pump.’’ 
Since then, the average price of a 
gallon of gasoline has risen from $4.20 a 
gallon to over $5 a gallon, while put-
ting our national security at risk as 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 
now at its lowest level since 1985. 
What is even more alarming is a new 
press report stating that 950,000 barrels 
of the oil Mr. Biden took from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve were sold 
to a state-owned Chinese company. If 
this is true, it is difficult to find the 
words to adequately describe how ut-
terly outrageous it is. 
President Biden must do better, and 
he must answer questions associated 
with this apparent sale of oil from our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to our 
most dangerous geopolitical adversary, 
China. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JEANNE 
WOOD 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of the late 
Jeanne Wood, who reached age 100, in 
our Chino Hills community. 
Jeanne dedicated herself to serving 
others. During World War II, she en-
listed as a second lieutenant Army 
nurse and was quickly promoted to 
first lieutenant. She worked 18 to 24 
hours per shift, with bombings and air 
raids around her, to care for injured 
and starving servicemembers. 
After the war, Jeanne continued her 
career as a registered nurse and be-
came the only female commander in 
the history of American Legion Post 
299 in Chino. 
I am so glad Jeanne was able to cele-
brate her 100th birthday in Chino Hills 
with her family and friends before she 
passed. My heart is with her loved ones 
as we mourn this loss and celebrate a 
life well lived. 
f 
RELEASE OUR ENERGY 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ad-
dress the situation that President 
Biden has us in right now on fuel. 
On April 27, according to his texts, he 
is going to help bring the price of fuel 
down. The price of fuel has gone up 
since April 27. 
In his texts, he is going to release 
fuel from our reserves. All it did was 
put money in Chinese pockets—950,000 
barrels of oil—and someone has got to 
be answerable for that. 
This gentleman pictured on the end, 
Mr. Seals, is an offshore oil producer, 
and Mr. Seals wants his job back. 
Let’s spend our time trying to get 
our energy released. 
Don’t go to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Presi-
dent. Let’s stay here and let our peo-
ple, Mr. Seals, get and drill. Release 
our energy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
DEPLETING THE STRATEGIC 
PETROLEUM RESERVE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant 
to be preserved for an actual emer-
gency, such as in the case of cata-
strophic weather or in times of war. 
But President Biden has started the 
largest ever loan from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. 
From that loan, we have seen he has 
shipped 5 million barrels of oil, not for 
lowering the prices, as they thought 
that putting some of that oil on the 
market might affect the price. No, they 
are actually shipping it to foreign 
countries, including China. A million 
barrels of oil is allegedly going to 
China out of our Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which is supposed to be for us 
in case of emergency, not playing mar-
kets, not trying to make some money. 
It is unreal. Since day one, President 
Biden walked into office and started 
shutting down our energy industry, the 
pipeline, 
exploration 
permits 
and 
leases. They have gone this direction. 
That makes our fuel more expensive 
for everybody on the whole supply 
chain: Farmers, manufacturers, people 
taking their kids to school, people 
going to the store. It is hurting every-
body. 
They are sending it now to China. 
Whose side is President Biden on? 
f 
b 1415 
PROTECTING ALL LIFE 
(Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
finally, mercifully, the most destruc-
tive Supreme Court decision in history 
has been reversed, something many of 
us believed we would never live to see, 
after decades of disappointment. 
Not only was the Roe decision with-
out constitutional merit, but no other 
decision in the history of the Court 
caused so much destruction, so much 
carnage, so much devastation, with 63 
million lives lost. 
Sixty-three million lives, about the 
population of France, more than the 
population of Italy, Ukraine, or Can-
ada. Sixty-three million lives, 1.4 mil-
lion a year, more than the 2-year 
amount attributable to 
the 
China 
virus, for every year for nearly 50 
years, all of them 100 percent attrib-
utable and 100 percent preventable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5949 
July 12, 2022 
Thank God for the hundreds of thou-
sands of relentless pro-life activists, 
for millions of pro-life marchers, for 
tens of millions of pro-life voters, and 
thank God for the courage of six Su-
preme Court Justices who withstood 
the pressure, the threats, and the in-
timidation to do the right thing mor-
ally and constitutionally. 
May our legislative bodies in Wash-
ington now match that courage. The 
responsibility passes to us now, the 
people’s 
elected 
representatives, 
to 
pass laws protecting all life in the 
womb.

HONORING THE KIWANIS CLUB OF 
WARREN, PENNSYLVANIA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Service 
Organization Caucus, which highlights 
the great work of service organizations 
across our country, I rise to recognize 
and honor the Kiwanis Club of Warren, 
Pennsylvania. 
This month, the Kiwanis Club of 
Warren is celebrating 100 years of serv-
ice. Since July 12, 1922, Kiwanis of War-
ren have worked toward fulfilling the 
mission of Kiwanis International ‘‘to 
improve the world one child and one 
community at a time.’’ 
Their work not only in Warren, but 
internationally, has made a positive 
impact for children and families every-
where. 
The Kiwanis Club of Warren has 
raised funds for a joint effort between 
UNICEF and Kiwanis International to 
eliminate iodine dependency disorder 
and maternal neonatal tetanus world-
wide. 
In addition to the club’s global im-
pact, the Warren Kiwanis Club also 
makes a difference at home. In efforts 
to engage the next generation of serv-
ice-minded leaders, the Kiwanis Club 
sponsors three service leadership pro-
grams where participants focus on 
leadership and character building. 
The Kiwanis Club of Warren also 
sponsors a variety of community build-
ing events, like the Salvation Army 
bell 
ringing 
and 
annual 
blood 
screenings. 
I congratulate the Kiwanis Club of 
Warren for 100 years of service.

NEED 
TO 
STRENGTHEN 
TRADE 
AND 
IN-
VESTMENT 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE CAR-
IBBEAN NATIONS, OUR ‘‘THIRD 
BORDER’’ 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 1168) reaffirming 
the economic partnership between the 
United States and the Caribbean na-
tions and recognizing the need to 
strengthen trade and investment be-
tween the United States and the Carib-
bean nations, our ‘‘Third Border’’, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1168 
Whereas Congress commits to strength-
ening economic ties and cooperation with 
the Caribbean people to promote equitable 
economic growth and development across the 
region; 
Whereas the Caribbean region has a popu-
lation of approximately 44,000,000 people, 
millions of people have emigrated between 
the Caribbean and the United States, and ap-
proximately 13,000,000 people in the United 
States, or 4 percent of the United States pop-
ulation, share Caribbean ancestry; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of 
the United States to support the economic 
development of sovereign Caribbean nations 
and territories; 
Whereas greater opportunities for mutu-
ally beneficial trade and investments pro-
mote economic growth, development, pov-
erty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, 
civil rights, and overall stability; 
Whereas regional and global integration 
with our Caribbean neighbors should be 
strengthened to create decent jobs, boost 
economic growth in the Caribbean and the 
United States, and eliminate barriers to 
trade and investment in the Caribbean; 
Whereas it remains the goal of the United 
States to support diversification of Carib-
bean exports to the United States; 
Whereas, in 1983, Congress launched the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) through the 
Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act 
(CBERA) and expanded it in 2000 with the 
United States–Caribbean Basin Trade Part-
nership Act (CBTPA); 
Whereas the United States shares a history 
of struggle with Caribbean neighbor coun-
tries, including with our courageous sister 
nation of Haiti; 
Whereas Haiti suffered destabilizing events 
in 2021, including severe insecurity, a deadly 
earthquake, widespread democratic protests, 
continuation of the COVID–19 pandemic, and 
the 
assassination 
of 
President 
Jovenel 
Moı¨se, all of which have contributed to a 
governance and humanitarian crisis that re-
quires immediate further attention and sup-
port from the United States and the global 
community; 
Whereas specialized United States trade 
preferences with Haiti, including the Haiti 
Economic Lift Program (HELP) and Hemi-
spheric Opportunity through Partnership 
Encouragement Act (HOPE II) programs, aid 
Haiti’s growing textile and apparel manufac-
turing industry and are a critical source of 
steady jobs for many Haitian people to sup-
port their families; 
Whereas trade preference programs for the 
Caribbean 
and 
Caribbean 
Community 
(CARICOM) countries, such as the General-
ized System of Preferences, CBI, and CBTPA 
have provided important economic benefits 
for Caribbean Basin country economies, in-
cluding by facilitating niche production and 
more diversified exports, while also benefit-
ting United States businesses and workers, 
including by helping to add value for cus-
tomers and supporting United States jobs; 
Whereas Caribbean people and their island 
nation economies have led globally by ex-
ploring innovative economic strategies to 
produce collective benefits for their commu-
nities, such as through the Caribbean Catas-
trophe Risk Insurance Facility, to reduce 
the economic impact of major disasters; 
Whereas 
the 
United 
States 
seeks 
to 
prioritize and promote a worker-centered 
trade agenda that facilitates trade and pro-
tects freedom of association, fosters a sus-
tainable environment and climate path, ad-
vances racial equity and supports under-
served communities, addresses unfair eco-
nomic trade practices, supports domestic 
producers, and promotes growth and develop-
ment around the world; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has nega-
tively impacted the public health and econo-
mies of the Caribbean and the United States, 
which has also contributed to inequality 
within and between nations, and further ex-
cluded vulnerable groups from the benefits of 
trade and economic development; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has high-
lighted the need to strengthen supply chain 
resilience and increase near-shoring in glob-
al trade; 
Whereas the United States believes that 
free and fair trade practices, economic 
growth, and stable domestic employment 
foster democratic principles of good govern-
ance; 
Whereas United States and Caribbean eco-
nomic ties, including through Caribbean 
services and manufacturing sectors, produce 
critical goods and services for consumers and 
jobs for workers that strengthen their econo-
mies; 
Whereas such economic ties serve strategic 
purposes by providing an alternative to po-
tentially predatory economic practices of 
other foreign governments, including non- 
market economies, in the Caribbean that 
harm national and regional interests in the 
Western Hemisphere; 
Whereas climate change and natural disas-
ters pose acute risks for Caribbean people 
and island economies; and 
Whereas the United States signed a Trade 
and Investment Framework Agreement in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5950 
July 12, 2022 
2013 with CARICOM to drive strengthened 
trade and investment ties between CARICOM 
and the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) urges the President to prioritize and 
implement trade programs with the Carib-
bean region that promote sustainable and re-
silient economic development; 
(2) commits to engaging directly with di-
verse stakeholders from the Caribbean, in-
cluding CARICOM Trade Ministers, policy-
makers, as well as labor, business, and civil 
society representatives, to dialogue and de-
velop a shared multilateral trade agenda; 
(3) affirms trade and tariff preference pro-
grams that strengthen the economic rela-
tionship between the Caribbean and the 
United States and produce economic benefits 
for people of all racial, ethnic, gender, abil-
ity, economic, linguistic, and religious back-
grounds; 
(4) encourages further enhancing trade pro-
grams between the Caribbean and the United 
States; and 
(5) supports critical trade policies and pref-
erence programs, such as HELP and HOPE II, 
and further commits to strengthen those 
policies to ensure they advance sustainable 
economic development, produce positive eco-
nomic benefits in Haiti, the Caribbean, and 
the United States, and protect our most vul-
nerable communities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) and 
the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by com-
mending my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle, Representatives WENSTRUP, 
SEWELL, and BLUMENAUER, and indeed 
the membership of the Ways and Means 
Committee collectively, for joining me 
in support of U.S. trade and economic 
relations with our Caribbean neigh-
bors. 
This resolution is the product of a 
year’s worth of work, and today would 
not be possible without the bipartisan 
support of my colleagues from across 
the aisle, particularly Representative 
WENSTRUP, and his leadership, and our 
shared commitment to a focus on U.S. 
trade engagement with the Caribbean. 
This resolution commits to enhance 
the economic partnership between the 
United States and the Caribbean region 
through strengthened trade engage-
ment, including by promoting eco-
nomic growth and development across 
the region, engaging directly with di-
verse stakeholders from the Caribbean, 
and supporting critical trade policies 
and preference programs. 
The Caribbean, along with Latin 
America, has experienced significant 
challenges in recent years. According 
to the International Monetary Fund, 
IMF, we have seen a larger GDP con-
traction from the region than any 
other place in the world. Simulta-
neously, per capita deaths from COVID 
have been greater from the Caribbean 
and Latin America than any other re-
gion in the world. Furthermore, many 
of the islands and countries in the Car-
ibbean have also experienced severe 
natural disasters, such as the recent 
earthquake in Haiti and numerous 
other extreme weather events like hur-
ricanes. 
So this resolution simply expresses 
support for furthering U.S. trade ties 
and economic relations with the Carib-
bean region. Overall, the resolution ex-
presses the importance of the existing 
economic partnerships between the 
United States and the Caribbean region 
and strengthening U.S. trade and in-
vestment ties with the region. 
Presently, the U.S. does about $35 
billion in trade with the region, and 
American businesses can have a great-
er opportunity to grow in the region 
with our help. 
Deepening economic ties between the 
U.S. and the Caribbean region helps 
American 
partnerships 
across 
the 
Western Hemisphere, where we support 
budding democracies at our doorstep 
and create mutually beneficial eco-
nomic stability with our neighbors. Re-
ciprocal trade is one of the mecha-
nisms we pursue to do that. 
Our overall trade agenda was well 
served by agreements like the 2013 
Trade 
and 
Investment 
Framework 
Agreement between the U.S. and the 
Caribbean Community, CARICOM, as 
well as important trade promotion pro-
grams like the U.S.-Caribbean Basin 
Trade Partnership Act and the HOPE/ 
HELP trade preference programs for 
Haiti. 
The Ways and Means Committee will 
be taking a hard look at what is needed 
for the Caribbean. As this resolution 
provides, we will engage with diverse 
stakeholders, 
including 
CARICOM 
trade ministers, policymakers, as well 
as labor, business, and civil society 
representatives, to dialogue and de-
velop a shared multilateral trade agen-
da. 
The trade programs that we have for 
the Caribbean, especially the Carib-
bean Basin Initiative programs like 
CBTPA preference programs, along 
with HOPE/HELP for Haiti, have his-
torically enjoyed bipartisan and bi-
cameral support, in part because of the 
shared history and close ties that the 
United States has with the Caribbean 
region. 
I am pleased that this resolution also 
indicates how important the HOPE/ 
HELP trade promotion program is for 
our sister nation of Haiti. I am com-
mitted to strengthening and renewing 
this program in a timely fashion. 
Like any good trading relationship, 
we must continue to work to improve 
labor conditions, political stability, 
and especially to expand economic de-
velopment to all countries in the im-
portant region of the Caribbean. 
President Bush recognized the impor-
tance of this region by naming it as 
our ‘‘Third Border.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution. The month of 
June was Caribbean American Heritage 
Month. There are about 13 million 
Americans who have Caribbean ances-
try here in this country. They rep-
resent 4 percent of the American popu-
lation. This is an opportunity for us to 
reaffirm this community and dem-
onstrate to our neighboring nations in 
the Caribbean that we are committed 
to working together to improve trade 
and economic conditions. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 1168. 
I thank Dr. WENSTRUP and Represent-
ative PLASKETT for their work on this 
bipartisan resolution. This measure af-
firms the importance of U.S. economic 
partnerships in the Western Hemi-
sphere and, more specifically, with na-
tions in the Caribbean region. 
Over the last two decades, economic 
partnerships and trade programs have 
created job opportunities for Caribbean 
workers and innovators, provided in-
centives for nations to strengthen the 
rule of law, and provided new market 
opportunities for American businesses. 
While this resolution highlights the 
importance of existing trade programs 
in the region, it also encourages fur-
ther enhancements to these trade pro-
grams. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: If we are not proactive in engag-
ing with our trading partners in the re-
gion and around the world, others who 
do not share our values, our respect for 
economic freedom and the rule of law, 
or our interest in regional stability and 
growth, will. 
By engaging and fostering trade with 
our 
Caribbean 
neighbors, 
we 
will 
strengthen and make the Western 
Hemisphere more competitive as a re-
gion as China tries to seize even more 
of the global market share. 
I look forward to working with the 
sponsors to use trade as a key tool in 
strengthening the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Nebraska for his words, and I in-
deed recognize with him the impor-
tance of American engagement in the 
region. As Americans, this is our bor-
der. We must be engaged in the region 
so that others do not usurp our author-
ity, our position in the region, and so 
our American businesses can grow as 
well. Economic development in this 
area is in the best interest of the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

or less, not including any request involving a 
record damaged or lost in the National Per-
sonnel Records Center fire of 1973 or any re-
quest that is subject to a fee that has not 
been paid in a timely manner by the re-
questor (provided the National Personnel 
Records Center issues an invoice within 20 
days after the date on which the request is 
made), the Archivist of the United States 
shall submit to the appropriate congres-
sional committees an update of such plan 
that— 
(1) describes progress made by the National

spector General Act of 1978, a detailed sum-
mary of— 
(1) efforts taken by the National Archives 
and Records Administration to address the 
backlog of records requests at the National 
Personnel Records Center; and 
(2) any recommendations for action pro-
posed by the Inspector General related to re-
ducing the backlog of records requests at the 
National Personnel Records Center and the 
status 
of 
compliance 
with 
those 
rec-
ommendations by the National Archives and 
Records Administration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Access for Veterans 
to Records Act would address the seri-
ous backlog of requests for veterans’ 
records currently pending at the Na-
tional Personnel Records Center, or 
NPRC, which is part of the National 
Archives and Records Administration. 
This bill has received bipartisan sup-
port, and I thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, including Rank-
ing Member COMER and Representative 
FRED KELLER, who have cosponsored 
this legislation, along with a number of 
other Members. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
the NPRC has accumulated a backlog 
of veterans’ records requests, which 
reached a peak of 603,000 during March 
of 2022. 
b 1430 
Veterans and their families need 
these records to access critical serv-
ices, including housing and healthcare. 
Many of these records are only avail-
able as paper documents. That limita-
tion, combined with limited building 
operations and a reduced workforce to 
protect NPRC employees during the 
coronavirus pandemic, have been the 
primary cause of this backlog. 
The NPRC has made some progress to 
reduce the backlog. As of February 28, 
the NPRC workforce has returned to 
full capacity at its facility in St. 
Louis, Missouri. NPRC also added over-
time shifts on weekends and some holi-
days. However, the backlog, which cur-
rently stands at 515,000 records re-
quests, remains significant and can 
only be remedied with legislative inter-
vention. 
This bill has two components. First, 
it requires National Archives to pro-
vide the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee with a detailed plan and target 
timeframes to eliminate the backlog 
and strategies to prevent a future 
records requests backlog. This includes 
submitting biannual status updates on 
the backlog and maintaining staffing 
levels to meet the goal of responding to 
90 percent of requests in 20 days or less. 
Second, the bill would authorize $60 
million for NARA to make upgrades to 
its information technology infrastruc-
ture. The upgrades are necessary for 
NARA to improve its ability to digitize 
documents and to prevent future back-
logs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5952 
July 12, 2022 
The committee has already voted to 
approve $60 million for National Ar-
chives in an amendment offered by 
Representative KELLER to another bill. 
Congress must take action to help 
our veterans, many of whom put their 
lives on hold waiting for records from 
the NPRC. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the veterans by supporting this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, over 2 years ago, com-
mittee Republicans opened an inves-
tigation into the veterans’ records re-
quests backlog at the National Per-
sonnel Records Center. 
Pennsylvania veterans and their fam-
ilies were frustrated and concerned 
with the lengthy delays they were ex-
periencing as they tried to access their 
own 
documents 
outlining 
military 
service. 
American veterans and families rely 
on these records to prove eligibility for 
medical care and the benefits they are 
entitled to. 
What we found was deeply disturbing. 
The records at the NPRC are on paper. 
They cannot be accessed remotely. 
When the NPRC shut down in-person 
operations and told its workforce to go 
home, the backlog piled up to more 
than 500,000 military service records re-
quests. 
Veterans put their lives on the line 
for our country. The least we can do 
for them is to ensure they have access 
to the care and benefits they have 
earned. 
Based on our findings, we urged the 
chairwoman 
to 
hold 
hearings. 
We 
pressed the NPRC to get staff back to 
work in person. But under the current 
administration, the backlog has grown 
to over 600,000 pending requests, with 
more added daily. 
That is why, in June of last year, I 
introduced the RECORDS Act to re-
quire the NPRC to get back to work in 
person. Finally, after significant pres-
sure from congressional Republicans, 
the NPRC returned to full in-person 
staffing on March 7 of this year. 
I am pleased that this legislation has 
finally reached the House floor. 
The Access for Veterans to Records 
Act incorporates improvements Repub-
licans made to ensure the backlog is 
fixed. This bipartisan legislation re-
quires the NPRC to maintain in-person 
staffing levels. 
The bill also authorizes the funds 
necessary to speed up the digital pres-
ervation of records, so we will not face 
this problem in the future. 
Finally, the bill contains reporting 
requirements to ensure proper account-
ability for addressing the current back-
log and preventing future issues. 
The Access for Veterans to Records 
Act is a bipartisan bill that dem-
onstrates how Congress can work to-
gether to advance legislative reforms 
that are truly responsive to the needs 
of the American people and those who 
have given so much for our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the distinguished chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairwoman 
and Mr. KELLER, my colleague and 
friend from Pennsylvania, for their 
leadership on H.R. 7337, the Access for 
Veterans to Records Act. 
The Access for Veterans to Records 
Act will help provide the National Ar-
chives and Records Administration re-
sources desperately needed to address 
veterans’ records requests. 
The records center houses records 
that are essential for veterans to re-
ceive the service-related benefits they 
need, including medical treatment, un-
employment assistance, and emergency 
housing. 
The records center was already be-
hind the curve when it came to invest-
ing in records digitization, creating a 
massive backlog. The pandemic then 
exacerbated that problem. 
Although NPRC has reduced the 
backlog to 515,000 from a peak of 
603,000, it is still preventing veterans 
from receipt of the records they need. 
It can’t be an acceptable standard. 
The Access for Veterans to Records 
Act requires NARA to submit a de-
tailed plan for eliminating the backlog 
and authorizes $60 million to improve 
the situation. 
This legislative effort works in lock-
step with the National Archives and 
Records Administration’s own efforts 
to secure funding from the Federal 
Technology Modernization Fund. At 
the urging of the chairwoman, myself, 
and others, the National Archives ap-
plied for and received a $9.1 million 
award from the Technology Moderniza-
tion Fund to do just that. 
Projects like this one at the National 
Archives are precisely why we created 
the Technology Modernization Fund. 
Proactive 
investments 
in 
effective 
technologies make Federal programs 
work and will serve our veterans well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
legislation. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7337 is a bipartisan 
bill directly addressing a current prob-
lem facing America’s veterans. I am 
thankful that the chairwoman and her 
staff worked with me to bring this nec-
essary legislation to the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 7337, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7337, as amended.

QUANTUM COMPUTING CYBER- 
SECURITY PREPAREDNESS ACT 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7535) to 
encourage the migration of Federal 
Government information technology 
systems to quantum-resistant cryptog-
raphy, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7535 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Quantum 
Computing 
Cybersecurity 
Preparedness 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) Cryptography is essential for the na-
tional security of the United States and the 
functioning of the economy of the United 
States. 
(2) The most widespread encryption proto-
cols today rely on computational limits of 
classical computers to provide cybersecu-
rity. 
(3) Quantum computers might one day 
have the ability to push computational 
boundaries, allowing us to solve problems 
that have been intractable thus far, such as 
integer factorization, which is important for 
encryption. 
(4) The rapid progress of quantum com-
puting suggests the potential for adversaries 
of the United States to steal sensitive 
encrypted data today using classical com-
puters, and wait until sufficiently powerful 
quantum systems are available to decrypt it. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) a strategy for the migration of informa-
tion technology systems of the Federal Gov-
ernment to post-quantum cryptography is 
needed; and 
(2) the Governmentwide and industrywide 
approach 
to 
post-quantum 
cryptography 
should prioritize developing applications, 
hardware intellectual property, and software 
that can be easily updated to support cryp-
tographic agility. 
SEC. 3. INVENTORY OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYS-
TEMS; MIGRATION TO POST-QUAN-
TUM CRYPTOGRAPHY. 
(a) INVENTORY.— 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Director of OMB shall establish, by 
rule or binding guidance, a requirement for 
each executive agency to establish and main-
tain an inventory of each cryptographic sys-
tem in use by the agency.

such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7535, the 
Quantum 
Computing 
Cybersecurity 
Preparedness Act. 
Today, the processes we use to 
encrypt data are incredibly reliable 
and can keep sensitive data secure 
from unauthorized users during storage 
or transmission. But tomorrow, that 
may no longer be the case. 
Researchers around the world are ac-
celerating advances toward quantum 
computing, which refers to the applica-
tion of quantum physics to computers. 
This will allow the computers of to-
morrow to perform calculations many 
magnitudes faster and more powerfully 
than they do today. 
While quantum computers have the 
potential to provide considerable bene-
fits to society through unimaginable 
innovation, they could also equip our 
adversaries with the ability to break 
the best encryptions available today. 
Capabilities of this magnitude are es-
timated to be a decade or more away, 
but China and other adversaries are ex-
pected 
to 
begin 
stealing 
sensitive 
encrypted data much sooner with the 
intent of unlocking it when they have 
the ability to do so. It is essential that 
the Federal Government prepare for 
this inevitability now while we still 
have time to protect data that is crit-
ical to our national and economic secu-
rity. 
The process of migrating all Federal 
IT systems to post-quantum cryptog-
raphy will be complex and costly, but 
putting the right steps in place now 
will help us stay at the forefront of 
this frontier. 
I applaud Representative RO KHANNA, 
as well as Representatives NANCY MACE 
and GERRY CONNOLLY, for introducing 
this thoughtful bipartisan bill to estab-
lish this process. 
Within a year of enactment, the bill 
would require the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to submit a report to 
Congress containing a strategy for ad-
dressing the risk posed by quantum 
computing, the funding needed to se-
cure Federal information technology 
systems 
from 
quantum 
computing 
threats, and a review of related coordi-
nation efforts. This will allow time for 
assessment of this strategy before the 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology issues its post-quantum 
cryptographic standards, which are ex-
pected in 2024. 
OMB would then be required to 
prioritize and designate Federal IT sys-
tems for migration to post-quantum 
cryptography using those standards 
and to submit an annual report to Con-
gress on progress toward transitioning 
Federal agencies to the new standards. 
The bill has been carefully aligned 
with the national security memo-
randum released by the Biden-Harris 
administration in May, which made 
important strides to advance U.S. lead-
ership 
in 
quantum 
computing 
by 
strengthening collaboration and part-
nerships with private-sector leaders, 
securing critical capabilities, and mak-
ing strategic investments. 
I am grateful to Representative RO 
KHANNA for leading on this important 
issue and setting an ambitious but 
achievable framework to both maxi-
mize the benefits and minimize the 
threats of quantum computing for the 
U.S.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5954 
July 12, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as an emerging tech-
nology, 
quantum 
computing 
holds 
great promise and potential peril for 
our Nation. It has the potential to ex-
ponentially increase computing power 
and processing speeds, which will mean 
technological leaps for American re-
search activities and business sectors. 
While such major advances are likely 
decades away, there is a clear risk that 
foreign adversaries like China are 
using early developments in quantum 
computing technology for malicious 
purposes. 
One immediate risk is that our for-
eign adversaries may use the first 
quantum computers to unlock data 
that has already been stolen from U.S. 
Federal agencies. 
Current data encryption methods 
protect the privacy, security, and in-
tegrity of underlying data and are 
nearly impossible to decrypt with to-
day’s computing capabilities. The com-
putations required to unlock encrypted 
data require computing resources that 
we do not currently possess. However, 
as quantum computing matures, so 
does the possibility that sensitive in-
formation could be unlocked. This is a 
clear national security threat. 
The Quantum Computing Cybersecu-
rity Preparedness Act will require a 
governmentwide strategy to better se-
cure valuable government data. 
While the Federal Government al-
ready has initiatives underway to ad-
dress such emerging threats, including 
the development of post-quantum cryp-
tography standards and a recent Presi-
dential national security directive, 
H.R. 7535 makes this a clear congres-
sional priority. 
The bill requires a governmentwide 
review of vulnerable agency informa-
tion systems and consistent guidance 
to Federal agencies, and it seeks to en-
sure proper congressional oversight. 
Advancing a strategic approach to 
evaluating quantum computing risks 
to Federal IT and network cybersecu-
rity is important given the significant 
potential risk to our public-sector 
data. 
b 1445 
And since this bill only requires cen-
tralized guidance and reporting, the 
Congressional Budget Office found it 
would cost American taxpayers less 
than $1 million over 5 years. This is a 
reasonable investment. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my House Over-
sight 
and 
Reform 
Committee 
col-
leagues, Representatives RO
KHANNA 
and NANCY MACE for their work on this 
important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. KHANNA). 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY and Chairman 
CONNOLLY for their leadership, and I 
thank the bipartisan leadership with 
Representative MACE and the Repub-
lican committee. 
This is the most significant legisla-
tion to address the challenge that 
quantum computing poses to our secu-
rity. The reality is that quantum com-
puting is going to be much faster and 
can do many more things than regular 
computing. 
For example, if you have an iPhone 
and you have a pass code on the 
iPhone, now you have a computer that 
can do a billion different combinations 
to try your pass code in a matter of a 
few seconds. Chances are they can 
break through the pass code. The prob-
lem is that a lot of the bad actors— 
they have been stealing American data 
from our government in anticipation of 
having 
these 
quantum 
computers, 
these super-fast computers—try all the 
combinations to break through. 
I am proud that this committee, in a 
bipartisan basis, came together, and 
said: We need to make sure that our se-
curity in our critical agencies do not 
suffer from these computers that can 
try all these codes. Let’s design that 
security in a way that will be safe, 
even with quantum computing. 
The bill directs the agencies to start 
having those algorithms now that are 
not vulnerable to these supercom-
puters. It is an example, with Rep-
resentative MACE and the committee, 
of Congress actually working, of Con-
gress being proactive, of Congress look-
ing ahead on the horizon and antici-
pating problems to keep the American 
people safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the bi-
partisan spirit. I acknowledge Geo 
Saba, my staff, and all of the staff on 
the Oversight and Reform Committee, 
both the majority and minority, for 
helping make this possible. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE). 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 7535, the Quantum Com-
puting 
Cybersecurity 
Preparedness 
Act, a truly bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. 
I thank Congressman RO
KHANNA 
from California for his leadership in 
this and Congressman CONNOLLY and 
Congresswoman MALONEY for working 
together across the aisle on an issue 
like this. 
I could never imagine 20 years ago— 
or further than that, 40 years ago, 35 
years ago—playing with an Apple IIe in 
the 1980s, and fast-forward to college as 
a cadet at the Citadel, learning and 
teaching myself how to code. We have 
seen leaps and bounds in technology 
and the advances over the last decades 
in technology. 
We see the risks to our national secu-
rity here and abroad, and we are work-
ing together in this environment today 
where many of us are attacked for 
working together but looking forward 
and looking to the future and pro-
tecting our country and protecting our 
allies. 
Quantum computing is without a 
doubt the next frontier in technology. 
It will take our civilization forward by 
leaps and bounds. In many ways, it will 
turn conventional understanding of 
computing on its head. I am here to 
tell you that the quantum computing 
era is upon us. 
Just 3 years ago, an entry level quan-
tum computer the size of a refrigerator 
was proven capable of outperforming a 
supercomputer the size of a football 
field. Imagine the advances in tech-
nology in that short a period of time 
and how quickly we are moving for-
ward to the future. 
We are looking at a world not unlike 
the last few days of the Manhattan 
Project, knowing what is to come will 
alter the security of the world forever. 
Fortunately, as with the development 
of the atomic bomb, America is at the 
forefront of pioneering this kind of 
technology—no doubt by leadership 
from Congressman KHANNA and others. 
We must inevitably face the reality 
that one day soon this technology may, 
in fact, be used against us by China and 
others that are against us today. The 
most significant threat of quantum 
computing is its ability to break 
through 
encryption 
with 
unprece-
dented speed. 
Currently, our sensitive data is usu-
ally encrypted and protected with a 
password. It might take a conventional 
computer years or even decades to try 
to break that password and eventually 
steal your data. 
In the next few years or decades, a 
computer will be created which will 
crack the last 20 years of encryption— 
not in years or months, but in minutes 
or seconds. To prevent any illicit use of 
this technology, we want to ensure 
that we are transitioning to a post- 
quantum cryptography future, to en-
sure Federal agencies that their sen-
sitive information remains secure from 
any prying eyes. And we know that in 
2020 we had 11 Federal agencies that 
were hacked by those that aligned with 
China and with Russia—11 Federal 
agencies. 
Our bill prompts the Federal Govern-
ment to begin taking the necessary 
steps to future proof current sensitive 
information and its databases. It will 
ensure the Federal Government will 
study the specific risks, draft a report 
on strategies to address these risks, 
and estimate the costs associated with 
securing our agencies and their IT sys-
tems. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
across the aisle for their work and 
their leadership on this issue. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bi-
partisan bill that addresses an emerg-
ing national security issue.

the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7331) to 
require the Comptroller General of the 
United States to provide certain infor-
mation with respect to unimplemented 
priority recommendations as part of 
the Comptroller General’s annual re-
porting to Congress, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7331 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving 
Government for America’s Taxpayers Act’’.

woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
strong support of H.R. 7331, the Improv-
ing Government for America’s Tax-
payers Act, which was introduced by 
Representatives DEREK
KILMER
and 
WILLIAM TIMMONS, chair and vice chair 
of the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress. I thank Rank-
ing Member COMER, and Representa-
tives 
CONNOLLY, 
MACE, 
KRISHNAMOORTHI, NORMAN, PORTER, and 
NORTON for cosponsoring this bill. 
This is an important bipartisan bill 
that would help improve the implemen-
tation of recommendations made to 
Congress by the Government Account-
ability Office. GAO’s work for Congress 
is invaluable and helps us to ensure a 
more effective and efficient govern-
ment in serving the people and the 
needs of the American people. 
The bill would direct GAO to consoli-
date recommendations to Congress in 
one succinct report. It would also di-
rect GAO to identify any additional 
oversight actions Congress should take 
to assist agencies in implementing 
their open priority recommendations. 
Implementing GAO’s recommendations 
to agencies and Congress would help 
improve government efficiency and 
save taxpayers’ dollars. 
As we seek greater transparency and 
accountability within our Federal Gov-
ernment, I appreciate the bipartisan 
approach that Chair KILMER and Vice 
Chair TIMMONS have taken on this bill. 
I commend my colleagues, Senator 
PORTMAN and Senator PETERS, for sup-
porting this bill in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Government Ac-
countability Office serves a vital role 
in examining agency spending and ad-
vising lawmakers and Federal agencies 
how to make government work better 
for the American people. 
GAO makes many recommendations 
regarding specific actions executive 
branch agencies should take to save 
taxpayer dollars. It also suggests legis-
lative actions Congress could take to 
improve government performance. 
Despite GAO’s successes, there are 
more than 100 actions executive branch 
agencies could take to be more effec-
tive and achieve greater efficiency. 
H.R. 7331 will consolidate open GAO 
recommendations for review by con-
gressional leadership and the appro-
priate committees of jurisdiction. It 
will annually highlight the congres-
sional oversight and legislative actions 
suggested 
to 
address 
these 
rec-
ommendations. 
In doing so, the bill will help ensure 
that Congress has the tools it needs to 
pass needed legislation and spur execu-
tive agencies to implement needed re-
forms. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania does not have any 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7331 
will help Congress address specific—but 
fixable—issues across our sprawling 
Federal Government which are causing 
waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanage-
ment. 
This bipartisan legislation will help 
improve the functioning of the Amer-
ican people’s government and ulti-
mately save taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 7331, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7331, as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5956 
July 12, 2022 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) it is in the best national and homeland 
security interests of the United States for 
Federal agencies to retain the specialized 
knowledge and experience of individuals who 
suffer an injury or illness while serving in a 
covered position (as defined under the 
amendments made by this Act); and 
(2) Federal agencies should ensure, to the 
greatest extent possible, that an individual 
who can no longer carry out the duties of a 
covered position, and is reappointed to a po-
sition in the civil service that is not a cov-
ered position, is reappointed within the same 
Federal agency, in the same geographic loca-
tion, and at a level of pay commensurate to 
the position which the individual held imme-
diately prior to such injury or illness. 
SEC. 3. RETIREMENT FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. 
(a) CSRS.—Section 8336(c) of title 5, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘(3)(A) In this paragraph— 
‘‘(i) the term ‘affected individual’ means 
an individual covered under this subchapter 
who— 
‘‘(I) is performing service in a covered posi-
tion; 
‘‘(II) while on duty, becomes ill or is in-
jured as a direct result of the performance of 
such duties before the date on which the in-
dividual becomes entitled to an annuity 
under paragraph (1) of this subsection or sub-
section (e), (m), or (n), as applicable; 
‘‘(III) because of the illness or injury de-
scribed in subclause (II), is permanently un-
able to render useful and efficient service in 
the employee’s covered position, as deter-
mined by the agency in which the individual 
was serving when such individual incurred 
the illness or injury; and 
‘‘(IV) is appointed to a position in the civil 
service that— 
‘‘(aa) is not a covered position; and 
‘‘(bb) is within an agency that regularly 
appoints individuals to supervisory or ad-
ministrative positions related to the activi-
ties of the former covered position of the in-
dividual; 
‘‘(ii) the term ‘covered position’ means a 
position as a law enforcement officer, cus-
toms and border protection officer, fire-
fighter, air traffic controller, nuclear mate-
rials courier, member of the Capitol Police, 
or member of the Supreme Court Police. 
‘‘(B) Unless an affected individual files an 
election described in subparagraph (E), cred-
itable service by the affected individual in a 
position described in subparagraph (A)(i)(IV) 
shall be treated as creditable service in a 
covered position for purposes of this chapter 
and determining the amount to be deducted 
and withheld from the pay of the affected in-
dividual under section 8334. 
‘‘(C) Subparagraph (B) shall only apply if 
the affected employee transitions to a posi-
tion described in subparagraph (A)(i)(IV) 
without a break in service exceeding 3 days. 
‘‘(D) The service of an affected individual 
shall no longer be eligible for treatment 
under subparagraph (B) if such service occurs 
after the individual— 
‘‘(i) is transferred to a supervisory or ad-
ministrative position related to the activi-
ties of the former covered position of the in-
dividual; or 
‘‘(ii) meets the age and service require-
ments that would subject the individual to 
mandatory separation under section 8335 if 
such individual had remained in the former 
covered position. 
‘‘(E) In accordance with procedures estab-
lished by the Director of the Office of Per-
sonnel Management, an affected individual 
may file an election to have any creditable 
service performed by the affected individual 
treated in accordance with this chapter 
without regard to subparagraph (B). 
‘‘(F) Nothing in this paragraph shall be 
construed to apply to such affected indi-
vidual any other pay-related laws or regula-
tions applicable to a covered position.’’. 
(b) FERS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 8412(d) of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) 
as subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively; 
(B) by inserting ‘‘(1)’’ before ‘‘An em-
ployee’’; and 
(C) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(2)(A) In this paragraph— 
‘‘(i) the term ‘affected individual’ means 
an individual covered under this chapter 
who— 
‘‘(I) is performing service in a covered posi-
tion;

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 521, the First Responder Fair 
RETIRE Act, which was introduced by 
the chairman of the Government Oper-
ations Subcommittee, Representative 
CONNOLLY, along with Representatives 
FITZPATRICK and LANGEVIN. 
This bipartisan bill makes an impor-
tant change to the law governing cer-
tain retirement programs which cover 
Federal first responders and law en-
forcement officials in the event that 
they become disabled on the job and 
continue government service in a dif-
ferent capacity. 
Currently, these Federal employees 
are enrolled in and pay into a system 
with mandatory retirement at the age 
of 57, or after 20 years of service. This 
system also requires greater retire-
ment contributions from the employee. 
Under current law, when these em-
ployees become injured and disabled in 
the course of their work—which is in-
herently dangerous—they lose the ben-
efits they earned before they became 
disabled. 
H.R. 521 would allow employees in po-
sitions covered by enhanced retirement 
programs to retain their original bene-
fits if they are injured and disabled on 
the job and choose to continue working 
for the Federal Government. 
b 1500 
The employees covered under this 
bill include law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, nuclear materials couri-
ers, and diplomatic security special 
agents. These are, by definition, high- 
risk jobs. Denying them the retirement 
that they were guaranteed when they 
entered public service is deeply unfair. 
The men and women who sign up for 
dangerous jobs to serve our Nation 
should not be punished if they sustain 
injuries on the job—especially when, 
despite these injuries, they choose to 
continue their career in public service 
in a new capacity. These people should 
be rewarded, not punished. 
I commend Chairman CONNOLLY for 
his leadership on this bill which enjoys 
bipartisan support in both the House 
and Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important

July 12, 2022 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, our Federal law en-
forcement and safety officers should 
not have to risk losing their retire-
ment benefits if they are disabled in 
the line of duty. Likewise, Federal 
agencies should not lose talented em-
ployees who could otherwise continue 
their service in an alternative capac-
ity. 
Fortunately, this narrowly tailored 
bill fixes a technological flaw for Fed-
eral law enforcement officers who are 
injured on the job. The First Responder 
Fair RETIRE Act gives disabled public 
safety officers the option to continue 
serving their country in a different ca-
pacity. This bill covers first respond-
ers, including special agents, Customs 
and Border Protection officers, fire-
fighters, air traffic controllers, nuclear 
materials couriers, CIA agents, and 
members of the Capitol Police and Su-
preme Court Police. 
To be clear, H.R. 521 only applies to 
injuries sustained while on duty and as 
a direct result of the performance of 
such duties. Moreover, it only applies 
to officers who choose to continue Fed-
eral service and continue to pay into 
the accelerated annuity system as they 
did prior to their injury. If they leave 
Federal service, they are not eligible 
for this benefit. 
In conclusion, the First Responder 
Fair RETIRE Act ensures that our Fed-
eral law enforcement officers are not 
penalized when they make sacrifices in 
service to our Nation. H.R. 521 will also 
ensure the Federal Government agen-
cies who employ these American heroes 
are able to retain their talent and 
skills for continued public service. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support 
this bill, I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), who is the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Government Oper-
ations. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the chairwoman of 
the full committee, and my friend, Mr. 
KELLER from Pennsylvania, for their 
strong support for righting a wrong. 
Federal firefighters and law enforce-
ment officers put their lives on the line 
every day for us. America depends on 
brave men and women to serve in these 
demanding, arduous, and hazardous 
duty positions. These individuals face 
the very real daily potential that an 
on-the-job injury could leave them dis-
abled and unable to return to their pre-
vious service. 
Given the hazardous nature of the job 
required of Federal first responders, 
Congress recognized that risk and cre-
ated an accelerated retirement system 
for these positions and established a 
mandatory retirement age of 57. 
Referred to as 6(c) for the section of 
the law in which this system was cre-
ated, Federal first responders are quali-
fied for an annuity after serving 20 
years and reaching the age of 50. They 
pay a greater percentage of their sala-
ries into this retirement system, and 
their annuity amount is calculated at a 
higher rate than other Federal employ-
ees recognizing the risks they take. 
Unfortunately, not all Federal first 
responders can complete those 20 years 
of service. In cases where Federal first 
responders become injured and are no 
longer able to complete the essential 
functions of their jobs, they can be 
placed in civil service positions that 
don’t qualify for 6(c) benefits. Any Fed-
eral first responder transferred to the 
FERS retirement system loses their 
eligibility to retire after 20 years of 
service no matter how many years they 
have got in the system or how much 
they paid into it. 
Additionally, the employee is not re-
imbursed for the higher contributions 
required of them to be in the 6(c) sys-
tem. The years of service are credited 
as if the Federal first responder who is 
injured had been in the normal 30-year 
retirement system for the Federal em-
ployees. 
The First Responder Fair RETIRE 
Act offers a correction to current law 
and rights this wrong, authorizing Fed-
eral first responders to stay in 6(c) re-
tirement if they are placed in a posi-
tion outside of that system after re-
turning to work from a duty-related in-
jury. The bill also allows those employ-
ees to receive a refund of their acceler-
ated contributions should they be sepa-
rated from service. 
The First Responder Fair RETIRE 
Act allows the Federal Government to 
uphold the retirement promise it made 
to its first responders. These first re-
sponders are Capitol Police officers, 
Secret Service agents, and other Fed-
eral law enforcement officers and fire-
fighters across numerous Federal agen-
cies. 
For example, Bob Beckley was a 
smokejumper out West with the U.S. 
Forest Service. He parachuted out of a 
plane in 1985, and he landed in a tree in 
the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area 
in Idaho trying to stop a blaze. The 
tree’s branches broke, dropping Mr. 
Beckley 80 feet and breaking his back 
in five places. He died twice before he 
could be revived and evacuated. 
After—thank God—his recovery, Mr. 
Beckley, 10 years into his firefighting 
career, chose to work for the Forest 
Service in another position, but the re-
ward for his bravery, his injury, and his 
service was his removal from the 6(c) 
retirement system. He watched his 
firefighter brothers and sisters all re-
tire with full benefits at the 20-year 
mark that he no longer qualified for. 
I will also highlight the story of Jus-
tin Moore, a U.S. Capitol Police officer 
right here in the U.S. Capitol. He was 
severely injured by being beaten right 
here in this Capitol on January 6. I 
heard firsthand from Justin and his 
colleagues about their heroism defend-
ing each and every one of us from a 
violent mob. Justin was beaten from 
behind with a blunt object suffering se-
vere concussions, contusions, and sev-
eral crushed vertebrae in his neck. In 
just a few weeks, Justin will undergo 
what is likely career-ending surgery. 
He may no longer be physically able to 
perform his law enforcement duties. 
Seventeen years into his career, Jus-
tin—a veteran and father of three—will 
lose the retirement benefits he has paid 
into when he is reassigned to a civilian 
position just 3 years short of quali-
fying. 
We want to incentivize our first re-
sponders to continue their service to 
this Nation. We shouldn’t punish them 
for injuries they sustained protecting 
us, and we should reward their actions 
with continued inclusion in the retire-
ment system they signed up for at the 
start of their service. 
This bill is endorsed by the Federal 
Law Enforcement Officers Association, 
the National Fraternal Order of Police, 
the National Federation of Federal 
Employees, the International Associa-
tion of Firefighters, the National Asso-
ciation of Police Organizations, the Na-
tional Treasury Employees Union, and 
the Senior Executive Association. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our 22 bipar-
tisan cosponsors, and, in particular, 
my 
original 
cosponsors: 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK
and JAMES
LANGEVIN. I 
thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship and support on this important en-
deavor. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to help 
advance the First Responder Fair RE-
TIRE Act through the House. This leg-
islation ensures that our Federal law 
enforcement and public safety officers 
can continue their service to our Na-
tion after being injured in the line of 
duty. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 521, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 521, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 203, to honor Benny Martinez. 
Mr. Martinez was born in Goliad, 
Texas, in 1934. He attended segregated 
schools before his father moved the 
family to Houston so that Mr. Martinez 
and his siblings would not have to pick 
cotton for a living. 
At the age of 18, Mr. Martinez was in-
ducted into the U.S. Army. He first 
went to boot camp in El Paso, Texas, 
and was then sent to supply handling 
school for the Quartermaster Corps in 
Fort Lee, Virginia. After completing 
this training, he was sent to Korea 
where he was assigned to the 564th 
Quartermaster Company. 
On June 23, 1958, Mr. Martinez was 
discharged 
from 
Active 
Duty 
and 
transferred to the Army Reserves at 
Fort Hood, Texas, where he served as a 
medic until his final discharge on Sep-
tember 4, 1962. After his honorable dis-
charge, he returned home to Houston 
and re-engaged with his local commu-
nity. 
Mr. Martinez went on to graduate 
from Houston Community College as a 
licensed vocational nurse in 1967. He 
later obtained a bachelor of general 
studies degree from the University of 
Houston-Downtown College. Mr. Mar-
tinez put his education degree to use as 
an associate teacher at Crockett Ele-
mentary. 
Mr. Martinez was most known for his 
collaboration with fellow members of 
the League of United Latin American 
Citizens to organize a gala for Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy during the Presi-
dent’s trip to Texas. Historians credit 
this meeting as the very first time a 
sitting United States President met 
with a Latino civil rights group. 
Mr. Martinez was a member and ac-
tive participant in many civic engage-
ment organizations including the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, the American 
GI 
Forum, 
The 
American 
Legion, 
LULAC, and the Knights of Columbus. 
He was also an honorary member of the 
Goliad Rotary Club and active volun-
teer for the American Red Cross. 
Due to his 35 years of service, Hous-
ton and Harris County declared Benny 
C. Martinez Day on August 27, 1997, and 
February 17, 1998. Mr. Martinez passed 
away at the age of 85 on December 29, 
2019. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in honoring his leg-
acy by naming the Post Office at 4020 
Broadway Street in Houston, Texas, as 
the Benny C. Martinez Post Office 
Building, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
203, which names a Houston post office 
for Benny Martinez. 
Mr. Martinez was a native Texan and 
attended segregated schools in his 
hometown of Goliad before moving to 
Houston with his family in the pursuit 
of greater opportunities. He served in 
the U.S. Army and was deployed during 
the Korean war. 
After he was honorably discharged, 
Mr. Martinez went back to school at 
Houston Community College and the 
University of Houston. He recognized 
the importance of education and be-
came an associate teacher in the Hous-
ton School District and raised money 
for student scholarships. 
Most famously, Mr. Martinez worked 
with the League of United Latin Amer-
ican Citizens to organize a gala for 
President Kennedy held the night be-
fore his assassination during his trip to 
Texas in 1963. This was the first time a 
sitting President met with a Latino 
civil rights group. Mr. Martinez was a 
leader in the civil rights movement 
and is deserving of this honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA), the vice chair of the Committee 
on Financial Services’ Subcommittee 
on Diversity and Inclusion. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman and the ranking 
member for such kind remarks about a 
dear friend and colleague back home, 
Benny Martinez. 
They have covered a lot of what was 
said, but I will repeat some of it be-
cause I think it is important, not just 
for people in my district to hear it, but 
for people across the district because, 
with the naming of this Post Office, 
Mr. Speaker, it will mean the first post 
office named for a Latino in the Hous-
ton area, which, too, is a remarkable 
achievement. 
Mr. Martinez was a community lead-
er, an advocate for Mexican-American 
civil rights, an Army veteran, a nurse, 
a Houston, Texas educator, and a 
friend. 
Benny and his family came from 
humble beginnings in Goliad, Texas, 
but moved to Houston, like many oth-
ers, to find more opportunities. 
In 1956, at the age of 18, Benny was 
inducted into the U.S. Army. After 
completing his training, he was sent to 
Korea, where he was assigned to the 
564th Quartermaster Company. 
Benny put his education degree to 
use and worked as an associate teacher 
in the Houston School District at 
Crockett Elementary. 
On top of this, Mr. Speaker, he served 
many 
organizations. 
As 
was 
men-
tioned, he was a lifelong member of 
LULAC, the League of United Latin 
American Citizens; the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars; the Knights of Colum-
bus; and the American GI Forum. He 
also found time to be an usher at his 
local church. 
The thing that has been mentioned 
but that I want to underscore, because 
it was another historical note, is that 
he is better known for facilitating a 
historic 
meeting 
between 
a 
Texas 
LULAC chapter—again, the League of 
United Latin American Citizens—and 
then-President John F. Kennedy in 
1963. This event is the first known 
meeting between a U.S. sitting Presi-
dent and a Hispanic civil rights group— 
very noteworthy. 
After a lifetime of a lot of achieve-
ments, Mr. Martinez passed away at 85 
in 2019. This bill would name the post 
office after him. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill in the mem-
ory of a history maker and a pioneer in 
our community. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 203, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.

COMPUTERS FOR VETERANS AND 
STUDENTS ACT OF 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3544) to 
require the Administrator of General 
Services to transfer certain surplus 
computers and technology equipment 
to nonprofit computer refurbishers for 
repair, distribution, and return, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3544 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Computers 
for Veterans and Students Act of 2022’’ or the 
‘‘COVS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Access to computers and computer 
technology is indispensable for success in the 
21st century. Millions of Americans do not 
regularly use a computer and research shows 
that substantial disparities remain in both 
internet use and the quality of access with 
the digital divide concentrated among older, 
less educated, less affluent populations, espe-
cially veterans, low-income students, and 
senior citizens. 
(2) The COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted 
the gap between those with computer access 
and those without. Millions of students, 
their families, and workers from across the 
economy were unable to do schoolwork, 
work remotely from home, or connect to 
loved ones and their communities because of 
the digital divide. 
(3) Any Federal program that distributes 
surplus Federal computers to a public 
school, an educational nonprofit, or a non-
profit computer refurbisher for repair and 
distribution would benefit from a partner-
ship with a nonprofit organization, whose 
mission is bridging the digital divide. 
SEC. 3. REFURBISHMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
SURPLUS COMPUTERS AND TECH-
NOLOGY EQUIPMENT. 
(a) GSA TRANSFER.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days 
after State agencies for surplus property

equipment with full title to such equipment, 
for repair and distribution in accordance 
with subsection (c)(1). 
(2) INFORMATION
ON
EQUIPMENT
REFUR-
BISHED.—A nonprofit computer refurbisher

(b) PARTNERSHIP.—The Administrator may 
establish a partnership with non-govern-
mental entities, at no cost, to—

ment under this section; and 
(2) facilitate the participation of nonprofit 
computer refurbishers under this section. 
(c) REPAIR AND DISTRIBUTION.— 
(1) DISTRIBUTION TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DI-
VIDE.—A nonprofit computer refurbisher that 
receives equipment under subsection (a) 
shall repair and distribute such equipment to 
an educational institution, a veteran, an in-
dividual with a disability, a low-income indi-
vidual, a student, or a senior in need that is 
residing or based in the United States. 
(2) TRAINING
PROGRAMS.—Any nonprofit 
computer 
refurbisher 
that

ministrator under this Act. 
(e) AGENCY
REPORTS.—Not later than 5 
years after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and annually thereafter, the head of 
each Federal agency shall make a report 
available to the public on the number of re-
pairable computers that were sent to recy-
cling, abandoned, or destroyed.

July 12, 2022 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3544, the Computers for Veterans and 
Students Act. 
Technology pervades every aspect of 
modern life, and the gulf between those 
who have access to technology and 
those who do not continues to widen. 
Today, millions of Americans still lack 
access to home-based, internet-con-
nected 
computers 
and 
technology 
equipment. In fact, according to the 
Census Bureau, only 78 percent of 
households in the U.S. owned a desktop 
or laptop computer in 2018, leaving tens 
of millions of households without the 
resources that are essential for success 
in the modern economy. 
These disparities were made worse by 
the coronavirus pandemic, especially 
among veterans, low-income students, 
and seniors. This digital divide has tan-
gible, life-changing, and often heart-
breaking consequences, preventing peo-
ple of all ages from completing school-
work, working remotely, or connecting 
with their loved ones. 
H.R. 3544 will help address these dis-
parities by ensuring surplus Federal 
computers find their way to the house-
holds that need them most. 
The bill requires the General Serv-
ices Administration to transfer surplus 
computer and technology equipment 
from Federal agencies to nonprofit 
computer refurbishers to repair and 
distribute to students and educational 
institutions, low-income individuals, 
individuals with disabilities, veterans, 
and seniors in need. 
The bill also requires these refur-
bishers to offer relevant computer and 
technology training to recipients, fur-
ther reducing barriers presented by the 
digital divide. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER for leading this important 
bipartisan legislation, along with Rep-
resentatives ROB WITTMAN and ELAINE 
LURIA. 
Representative 
SPANBERGER 
worked tirelessly to bring the voices of 
veterans and students in her district 
here to the Halls of Congress as she 
wrote and championed this bill. 
For those who lack access to inter-
net-connected computers and the skills 
to use them, H.R. 3544 will unlock 
doors to new opportunities. It will also 
bring a greater return on investment 
for the American taxpayer, ensuring 
Federal information technology assets 
are used to their full potential in the 
fight to close the digital divide. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has highlighted the importance of tech-
nology to all Americans. Access to 
computers and computer technology is 
necessary for success in the modern 
world. This became even more critical 
during the height of the pandemic 
when many Americans struggled to 
juggle Zoom meetings and help their 
children with remote school. 
That is why this bill is important. It 
will help Americans get the access they 
need. 
H.R. 3544, the Computers for Veterans 
and Students Act, will repurpose sur-
plus Federal IT equipment to help 
American veterans, students, disabled 
individuals, 
low-income 
households, 
seniors in need, and educational insti-
tutions of all kinds. 
H.R. 3544 requires the General Serv-
ices Administration to transfer com-
puters and tech equipment in need of 
repair to nonprofit computer refur-
bishers. These third-party refurbishers 
will then repair and distribute the IT 
equipment directly to veterans, stu-
dents, and others in need. 
The bill also obligates these third- 
party refurbishers to offer training pro-
grams on the use of the technology 
being distributed. 
Those with access to computers and 
an understanding of how to use tech-
nology can enjoy many benefits, but a 
lack of such access and understanding 
presents significant challenges. Ameri-
cans need to be able to conduct online 
research for a school project, connect 
with loved ones, or find and keep a 
steady job. 
I appreciate Representatives ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER
and ROB
WITTMAN
for 
their leadership on this legislation. I 
encourage my colleagues to help our 
Nation’s veterans and students by sup-
porting H.R. 3544. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I note that Congress is expected to 
pay tribute to veterans when we honor 
retired Chief Warrant Officer 4 Hershel 
‘‘Woody’’ Williams. Woody, the last 
surviving World War II veteran who re-
ceived a Medal of Honor, will lie in 
honor this week in the U.S. Capitol. 
In the spirit of that event, let us pay 
tribute to all those who have served 
our Nation and all those who will serve 
our Nation in the future. 
Instead of letting technology that 
American taxpayers have already in-
vested in go to waste, the bipartisan 
Computers for Veterans and Students 
Act will get such repairable govern-
ment technology into the lives of 
Americans in need. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 3544, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3544, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
FIRST SERGEANT LEONARD A. 
FUNK, JR. POST OFFICE BUILDING 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5794) to

States Postal Service located at 850 
Walnut Street in McKeesport, Pennsyl-
vania, as the ‘‘First Sergeant Leonard 
A. Funk, Jr. Post Office Building’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5962 
July 12, 2022 
This bill would rename the post of-
fice located in my district at 850 Wal-
nut Street in McKeesport, Pennsyl-
vania, after First Sergeant Leonard A. 
Funk, Jr. 
Leonard was a lifelong resident of the 
Pittsburgh area. First Sergeant Funk 
enlisted in the Army months before the 
U.S. entered World War II, where he 
volunteered to be a paratrooper. 
His time in the military was notable. 
After jumping into Normandy on D-day 
with the 82nd Airborne Division, he 
earned the Distinguished Service Cross 
during Operation Market Garden, and 
on August 23, 1945, President Truman 
awarded 
First 
Sergeant 
Funk 
the 
Medal of Honor for his actions during 
the Battle of the Bulge. 
During this pivotal battle, First Ser-
geant Funk took charge of his com-
pany when his company’s officer went 
down. 
Despite 
being 
outnumbered, 
First Sergeant Funk led a makeshift 
group of clerks and soldiers to capture 
a town held by the enemy and then 
nearly singlehandedly killed or cap-
tured 100 enemy soldiers. 
First Sergeant Funk is also one of 
the most-decorated paratroopers of 
World War II, having also earned the 
Bronze Star and Purple Heart with two 
oak leaf clusters. 
First Sergeant Funk passed away in 
1992 after a civilian career with the 
U.S. Veterans Administration. I com-
mend him for his heroics and dedica-
tion to our Nation. 
I am proud to be able to make this 
small gesture of our Nation’s grati-
tude, spearheaded by the McKeesport 
community, come to fruition. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill to ensure that First 
Sergeant Funk’s legacy is not forgot-
ten.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5794 which honors Sergeant Leonard 
Funk. 
Sergeant Funk was a paratrooper 
who served in some of the most critical 
campaigns during World War II, includ-
ing the invasion of Normandy and the 
Battle of the Bulge. 
He became one of World War II’s 
most decorated paratroopers. Notably, 
he was awarded the Medal of Honor, 
the government’s highest and most 
prestigious military decoration, as well 
as the Distinguished Service Cross. 
Sergeant Funk exemplified what it 
means to be an American patriot. I am 
proud to say that following his mili-
tary service, Sergeant Funk returned 
to the great Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania where he continued his public 
service with the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs in the Pittsburgh area. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 5794 and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
STANTON). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 5794. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1095, a bill to honor private first 
class James Anderson, Jr. 
James Anderson was born on January 
22, 1947. After attending Los Angeles 
Harbor Junior College for a year and a 
half, he decided to enlist in the U.S. 
Marines to serve in Vietnam. 
Upon graduation from recruit train-
ing, he was promoted to private first 
class and then transferred to Camp 
Pendleton, California, where he trained 
with the 2nd Battalion. 
In December of 1966, Private Ander-
son arrived in Vietnam where he served 
as a rifleman. While on patrol, his pla-
toon was ambushed, and an enemy gre-
nade landed near him and his fellow 
marines. 
Without hesitation, Private Ander-
son pulled the grenade to his chest and 
absorbed the majority of the blast with 
his body, saving the lives of the ma-
rines around him. Due to his heroic 
sacrifice, Private Anderson was the 
first African-American marine to re-
ceive the Medal of Honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in honoring James 
Anderson’s bravery by naming the Post 
Office at 101 South Willowbrook Ave-
nue in Compton, California, as the Pri-
vate First Class James Anderson, Jr., 
Post Office Building, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1095, which names a Compton, Cali-
fornia, Post Office for Private First 
Class James Anderson, Jr. 
PFC Anderson grew up in Compton 
where he attended Centennial High 
School and later Los Angeles Harbor 
College. During college, he decided to 
enlist in the Marine Corps and serve 
the United States in the Vietnam war. 
While deployed, his platoon was am-
bushed, and an enemy grenade landed 
near him and his fellow soldiers. With-
out hesitation, PFC Anderson threw 
himself on the grenade, sacrificing his 
own life to save those of his fellow ma-
rines. For this action, he was awarded 
the Medal of Honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill 
which honors an American war hero, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 1095, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the

Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask sup-
port for H.R. 5271, my bill to name this 
Nashville Post Office for a great friend 
of mine and a great friend of all Ten-
nesseans, the late State Senator Thel-
ma Harper. 
Thelma was many things. She was a 
beloved public servant. She was the 
first African American to be elected to 
the Tennessee State senate, and she 
was the first female African American 
to be elected to the Tennessee Senate. 
She was the longest-serving female 
State senator in all of Tennessee his-
tory. 
Her nearly four decades of public 
service were marked by her tireless 
service on behalf of her constituents. 
She started in the city council, and she 
helped fight a toxic landfill in her com-
munity of Bordeaux. 
She then moved to the State senate, 
and she continued to fight for average 
people in Nashville, Tennessee. She 
served in the State senate until 2018, 
and she had a hand in many of Nash-
ville’s greatest projects: for example, 
bringing the Tennessee Titans to our 
city, the development of Nashville’s 
Music City Center, the downtown pub-
lic library, and for the National Mu-
seum of African American Music. 
Thelma Harper was a proud member 
of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and 
she served as chair of the Tennessee 
Commemorative 
Women’s 
Suffrage 
Commission. 
She is fondly remembered by many 
for her annual Kids’ Are Special Too 
community Easter egg hunts, which 
kids delighted in, and which I person-
ally participated in for many years. 
Those were held continuously and are 
continued by her family since Thelma 
passed away in May of 2021. 
Most importantly, Thelma was a dear 
friend who was kind enough to include 
me in her family. She was a member of

many organizations in Nashville, a

even with some tough political adver-
saries. She saw the best in everyone.

Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.

State Senator Thelma Harper. Senator 
Harper was the first African-American 
female elected to the State senate and 
the longest-serving female State sen-
ator in Tennessee history. 
Prior to this, she served as the grand 
jury foreman for the Davidson County 
Fifth Circuit Court as a representative 
of the Metropolitan Nashville Council. 
Throughout her time in public serv-
ice, Senator Harper championed chil-
dren’s issues and has been recognized 
with numerous awards for her public 
service. 
She worked to create a safe haven 
law to save abandoned babies and es-
tablish a fee waiver to provide low-in-

lunches. 
Senator Harper was a dedicated pub-
lic servant, and I encourage my col-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5809, a bill to honor Lance Cor-
poral Kareem Nikoui. 
As a high school student, Lance Cor-
poral Nikoui joined the Air Force Jun-
ior ROTC program where he volun-
teered for the city of Norco’s Pearl 
Harbor anniversary as well as prisoner 
of war events. 
After graduating from high school, 
he joined the Marine Corps, where he 
was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 1st 
Marines unit stationed at Camp Pen-
dleton. When he was afforded leave, he 
often returned home and invited his 
fellow marines to share a home-cooked 
meal with his family. 
Lance Corporal Nikoui was tragically 
killed in the attack on Afghanistan’s 
Kabul airport last year. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the sacrifice of Lance Cor-
poral Nikoui by naming the post office 
at 1801 Town and Country Drive in 
Norco, California, as the ‘‘Lance Cor-
poral Kareem Nikoui Memorial Post 
Office Building.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5809, which honors marine Lance Cor-
poral Kareem Nikoui. 
Lance Corporal Nikoui was born in 
2001, the same year that the war in Af-
ghanistan began. 
Last year, he was killed by a suicide 
bombing at the Kabul airport during 
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
He had gone back inside the Kabul air-
port to guide children to safety when a 
suicide bomb went off. 
While only 20 years old, Lance Cor-
poral Nikoui served America with dig-
nity and courage while fighting to pro-
tect those seeking refuge and freedom 
in our great Nation. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support this bill honoring a true 
American hero, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. CAL-
VERT). 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 5809, legisla-
tion I introduced to designate the U.S. 
Post Office located in Norco, Cali-
fornia, as the Lance Corporal Kareem 
Nikoui Memorial Post Office Building. 
As we approach the 1-year anniver-
sary of Lance Corporal Nikoui’s death, 
my congressional district continues to 
honor the life and memory of Kareem, 
who was a Norco resident and will be 
forever remembered as an American 
hero. 
As a student at Norco High School, 
Kareem was inspired to answer the call 
of service to his country. When he 
joined the Marine Corps, Kareem was 
following in the footsteps of patriots. 
Like his fellow marines, he was not 
signing up for glory or reward, but out 
of a sense of duty. Kareem was willing 
to make sacrifices in his own life so 
that others could live freely. 
In his final days, Kareem was on the 
front lines of a mission to secure free-
dom for desperate people trying to flee 
Afghanistan. Like so many of the U.S. 
servicemembers and coalition allies, 
Kareem conducted himself with brav-
ery and compassion, despite the chaos 
that resulted from a poorly planned 
exit from Afghanistan. In addition to 
securing the airfield, Kareem helped 
care for children, women, and the el-
derly by sharing with them water and 
candy. 
The suicide bombing that claimed 
the lives of Kareem and 12 other U.S. 
servicemembers, as well as hundreds of 
Afghans, was an act of cowardice and 
evil. 
The 
worst 
of 
mankind 
heartbreakingly robbed us of so many 
who represented the best of mankind. 
This bill, this Congress, and this 
country can never fully repay the 
Nikoui family for the sacrifice that 
they have made, but by passing this 
bill, the House remembers Kareem’s 
bravery, and we pay tribute to a young 
life taken too soon. As the sponsor of 
this bill, I will continue to work so it 
becomes law so that the community of 
Norco will forever honor and enshrine 
the name of Lance Corporal Kareem 
Nikoui. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close.

RONALD E. ROSSER POST OFFICE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4622) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 226 
North Main Street in Roseville, Ohio, 
as the ‘‘Ronald E. Rosser Post Office’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4622 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. RONALD E. ROSSER POST OFFICE. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 226 
North Main Street in Roseville, Ohio, shall 
be known and designated as the ‘‘Ronald E. 
Rosser Post Office’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Ronald E. Rosser Post 
Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4622, a bill to honor Ronald E. 
Rosser, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4622, which honors Ronald Rosser. 
Mr. Rosser served in the U.S. Army 
during the Korean war. He received the 
Medal of Honor for his heroic actions 
during the war. While acting as a for-
ward observer in an artillery unit in a 
region known as the Iron Triangle, his 
unit came under heavy fire. 
Mr. Rosser led the charge forward up 
a hill when he suddenly realized he was 
alone. His colleagues had all been in-
jured or shot, but Mr. Rosser kept as-
saulting enemy positions. When he ran 
out of ammunition, he exposed himself 
to enemy fire to obtain more and re-
sumed the fight. 
When he ran out of ammunition 
again, and despite being injured, Mr. 
Rosser made several trips across open 
terrain to help other wounded soldiers 
get to safety. 
He passed away in August of 2020, 
leaving a legacy of bravery. He was a 
true American war hero, and I strongly 
encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4622 to designate the 
Roseville, Ohio, post office as the Ron-
ald E. Rosser Post Office. 
The second oldest of 17 siblings, Ron 
Rosser had a sense of duty to his fam-
ily and country. First enlisting in the 
United States Army in 1946, Mr. Rosser 
served as a paratrooper for 3 years be-
fore returning home to Ohio to work as 
a coal miner. 
In February of 1951, he learned that 
his brother, Richard Rosser, was killed 
while fighting in the Korean war and 
immediately reenlisted to avenge his 
death. 
In Korea, Rosser served as a forward 
observer, attached to an infantry divi-
sion in the area known as the Iron Tri-
angle. At 20 degrees below zero, they 
were sent on a mission to raid a Chi-
nese 
Communist-held 
mountaintop 
outpost and to dismantle their winter 
apparatus. 
Tragically, the operation went south, 
as Mr. Rosser’s group was met with 
fierce 
enemy 
fire. 
Heavily 
out-
numbered, 
Rosser 
charged 
up 
the 
mountain with just a rifle and one gre-
nade. He was able to suppress hundreds 
of enemy soldiers and returned to the 
bottom of the hill to advise the captain 
to withdraw. Despite his wounds, he 
scaled the mountain—directly into op-
posing fire—several more times to res-
cue fellow soldiers. His actions that 
day were the embodiment of courage, 
valor, and patriotism. 
Upon his return home, Rosser was 
awarded the Medal of Honor in a White 
House Rose Garden ceremony by Presi-
dent Harry S. Truman. Rosser worked 
as a letter carrier for the United States 
Postal Service, advocated for veterans, 
and was inducted into the Ohio Vet-
erans Hall of Fame. 
Sadly, Mr. Rosser passed away at the 
age of 90 in August of 2020. Army Ser-
geant 1st Class Ronald E. Rosser was 
an 
American 
war 
hero 
and 
a 
Muskingum County icon who saved 
countless American lives during the 
Korean war and serves as an inspira-
tion for us today and will for many 
generations to come. 
It was an honor and a blessing for me 
to personally know Mr. Rosser. I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY and Mr. KELLER 
for their support in moving this bill 
forward. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 
4622. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 4622, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4622. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Cadiz Jewett Road in Cadiz, Ohio, as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5966 
July 12, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2472, a bill to honor John Armor 
Bingham, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2472, hon-
oring John Armor Bingham. John 
Bingham served in this Chamber from 
the 34th through the 38th Congresses, 
representing the great State of Ohio. 
After losing election in 1862, Presi-
dent Lincoln appointed Bingham as 
judge advocate of the Union Army. He 
presided over many significant mili-
tary trials and also served as a pros-
ecutor for the military tribunal of the 
Lincoln assassination conspirators. 
He was then reelected to the House, 
serving in the 39th through the 42nd 
Congresses. He is most notable for hav-
ing authored Section 1 of the 14th 
Amendment to our Constitution. 
Over his years of public service, John 
Bingham loyally served his country. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill honoring a former Member of 
this Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2472, to 
honor John Armor Bingham, a man 
who played an important role in ad-
vancing a more perfect Union for all 
Americans. 
Bingham first came to Cadiz, Ohio, in 
the early 1800s as a teenager. While 
studying law at Franklin College, he 
befriended former slave Titus Basfield, 
the first African American to graduate 
college in Ohio. 
Bingham’s commitment to advancing 
liberty and equality for all can notably 
be attributed to Section 1 of the 14th 
Amendment to the United States Con-
stitution, 
which 
he 
drafted. 
This 
amendment is the foundation for many 
famous Supreme Court decisions that 
have advanced liberty. 
b 1600 
Additionally, 
he 
represented 
the 
great State of Ohio in Congress, served 
as a House manager for the impeach-
ment of President Andrew Jackson, 
and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln 
as Judge Advocate of the Union Army. 
While John Armor Bingham’s legacy 
remains enshrined in the pages of the 
Constitution, I hope this body will see 
fit to honor John Bingham by renam-
ing the Cadiz, Ohio, post office after 
him. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2472, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2472. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

NORMA COMNICK POST OFFICE 
BUILDING 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 228) to

States Postal Service located at 2141 
Ferry Street in Anderson, California, 
as the ‘‘Norma Comnick Post Office

Ms. Comnick owned and operated an

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5968 
July 12, 2022 
SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
MIKE FLOOD, OF NEBRASKA, AS 
A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the gentleman from Nebraska, the 
Honorable Mike Flood, be permitted to 
take the oath of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest, and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from Ne-
braska? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will Representative- 
elect Flood and the members of the Ne-
braska delegation present themselves 
in the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his 
right hand. 
Mr. FLOOD appeared at the bar of 
the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic; that you will 
bear true faith and allegiance to the 
same; that you take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion; and that you will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties 
of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations. You 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress. 
f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MIKE FLOOD TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. 
SMITH) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, as a member of the Nebraska 
delegation, it is my distinct privilege 
to introduce Members of this body to 
our 
new 
colleague, 
Representative 
MIKE FLOOD. 
MIKE has a long record of service in 
the unicameral as the youngest speak-
er of the legislature in our State’s his-
tory. However, what defines MIKE’S life 
is not his successful business in radio 
or the positive mark he made on Ne-
braska in the State legislature. It is 
his commitment to his family. He al-
ways has put his wife, Mandy, and his 
boys, Brendan and Blake, first. They 
are at the center of everything he does. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to be 
the first Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives to yield to our new col-
league, Representative MIKE FLOOD. 
Mr. FLOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today and am incredibly grateful for 
the opportunity to be here. 
I would like to recognize my wife, 
Mandy, and my two boys, Brendan and 
Blake, both future Cornhusker line-
backers. Their support and hard work 
have made this day possible. 
My mom passed away in January, 
and today would have been her 79th 
birthday. Although she is a Democrat, 
I know she was smiling from Heaven as 
I took my oath tonight. 
When the people of Nebraska’s First 
Congressional District woke up this 
morning, they simply wanted to know 
that their elected officials and leaders 
were working to solve problems, create 
opportunities for their children, and 
make sure our homeland is safe. 
In that spirit, with a deep sense of 
abiding love for our country, I look for-
ward to working with all of you to find 
solutions to America’s toughest prob-
lems. 
I pledge to be honest, work for the 
betterment of our country, and con-
duct myself in such a way that I honor 
this institution, the people’s House. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

tion of the oath of office to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska, the whole num-
ber of the House is 431. 
f

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 8167 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I hereby remove my name as cosponsor 
of H.R. 8167. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK). 
The 
gentle-
man’s request is accepted. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF LIEU-
TENANT 
COLONEL 
ALEXANDER 
JEFFERSON 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Lieuten-
ant Colonel Alexander Jefferson, one of 
the original Tuskegee Airmen, who re-
cently passed away in our community. 
His remarkable service figures promi-
nently in our Nation’s history. Jeffer-
son served as a fighter pilot with the 
Red Tail 332nd Fighter Group, 301st 
Fighter Squadron in Italy during World 
War II. His unit bravely escorted bomb-
ers into action, providing critical pro-
tection from enemy aircraft without 
losing a single plane. 
After the war, Jefferson served as an 
instructor in advanced flight training 
at the Tuskegee Army Air Field, con-
tinuing the storied Air Corps’ legacy of 
excellence. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Jefferson 
re-
ceived numerous awards for his bravery 
and selfless service to our country, in-
cluding the Purple Heart award. We 
have lost a great American patriot and 
hero who should always be remembered 
for his service to freedom for our coun-
try. 
f 
WE MUST SAVE THE GIANT 
SEQUOIAS 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
after visiting the Mariposa Grove of 
giant sequoias, Teddy Roosevelt fa-
mously declared: ‘‘A grove of giant red-
wood or sequoias should be kept just as 
we keep a great and beautiful cathe-
dral.’’ 
Madam Speaker, today that cathe-
dral is on fire. The very grove in which 
President Roosevelt stood is enveloped 
in flames as we speak, threatening to 
destroy these iconic trees forever. 
We are seeing the horrific con-
sequences of decades of forest mis-
management play out in Yosemite, and 
it is time to act to save our sequoias. 
Wildfires burn so hot and so in-
tensely that they quite literally ex-
plode giant sequoias and create ‘‘fire- 
nados,’’ sending branches and bark 
hurling so far into the air that they 
have narrowly missed taking out our 
firefighting planes. If giant sequoias 
can’t withstand these raging infernos, 
no tree stands a chance. 
Time is not on our side, Madam 
Speaker. I urge immediate action on 
the Save Our Sequoias Act to give land 
managers in California the resources 
they so desperately need, preventing 
firefighters from having to resort to 
desperate measures to save these na-
tional treasures. This is the only way 
we can conserve America’s most beau-
tiful cathedral for generations to come. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CASPER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Casper, a golden retriever in the 
service of Children’s Healthcare of At-
lanta’s Canines for Kids program. 
To say that Children’s Healthcare of 
Atlanta does an immense amount for 
the community would be an under-
statement. Among these services is the 
Canines for Kids program that provides 
the tender love of man’s best friend to 
sick children. 
Casper, and his handler Lisa, were 
pioneers of this program. In 2009, Cas-
per reported for his first day of work, 
the inception of the program itself. 
He was driven by a deep love for chil-
dren, like the other employees at Chil-
dren’s Healthcare. His floppy-eared 
smile, paw touches, and intentional eye 
contact brought comfort to hundreds of 
patients through his many years of 
service. 
Casper became the leader of his co-
hort of fellow dogs and helped to pave 
the way for this instrumental program. 
This is a tough loss for all who knew 
Casper, but his legacy remains in the 
dozens of other dogs that continue his 
service nationwide every day. 
I thank Children’s Healthcare of At-
lanta for the work that they do and for 
introducing all of us to Casper. 
THE INFLATION CRISIS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
am sure every Congressman who has 
been back in their district for the last 
2 weeks heard the same thing as the 
number one issue that is facing the 
American public right now, and that is 
inflation, be it gas, even more food, 
even more housing, again and again 
and again. 
People say: How are you going to get 
around that? It is simple to get around 
it; it is just sometimes a little more 
difficult. That is finally saying no to 
the 
excessive 
government 
spending 
around here that has forced the Fed-
eral Reserve to print dollars and de-
crease the value of the dollar. 
Within the next couple of weeks, we 
are going to vote on appropriation bills 
for the budget year beginning October 
1. Let’s look: Are we holding the line? 
Transportation and HUD, 12 percent 
increase; water, 7 percent increase; fi-
nancial services and general govern-
ment, 16 percent increase; interior, 18 
percent increase; military construction 
and VA, 11 percent increase. 
Congress has not yet adapted to the 
new crisis. 
f 
JOYS AND CONCERNS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ELLZEY) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, the 
United States is home to the most re-
markable people in the world. We are 
the most caring, giving, and united 
country that has ever existed. But that 
is not the outlook we see daily in the 
news and on social media. Big tradi-
tional and social media outlets would 
have you convinced that Americans 
don’t help each other. The algorithms 
used by these companies are designed 
to show controversy and to lead you to 
believe that there is more divisiveness 
in our society than harmony. 
But that is not true. Since being 
elected to Congress, I have seen first-
hand that the Texas Sixth Congres-
sional District is home to many re-
markable people; so much so that each 
week my office sends out dozens of rec-
ognition letters highlighting some of 
their achievements. 
While in Washington, D.C., I have 
had the incredible opportunity to work 
with countless individuals, a lot of 
whom deserve the highest praise for 
their service to the American people. 
To be clear: These individuals I am ref-
erencing do not just make up my own 
party but also those across the aisle. 
Bipartisanship is alive and well up 
here, and I am proud to say that I am 
surrounded by like-minded individuals 
on both sides of the aisle who have 
dedicated their lives to public service,

working tirelessly for the betterment 
of the American people. 
Growing up back home in Perryton, 
Texas, my pastor would start off every 
Sunday service with what he called 
‘‘Joys and Concerns.’’ During this 
time, he would highlight some of the 
remarkable things that members of the 
church were doing and some prayer re-
quests, to unite us as a congregation to 
pray for our community and those in 
need. 
I will give my own version of ‘‘Joys 
and Concerns.’’ Let’s start with the

Again, congratulations on your re-

plishes in the coming years. 
I also want to acknowledge the 12 
outstanding young men and women we 
have from the Sixth Congressional Dis-
trict who have received and accepted 
appointments to our service academies. 
For the United States Naval Acad-
emy we have: Ethan Clarke and Jazmin 
Lemus. 
For the United States Air Force

Ramsey, 
Destiny 
Speltz, Carson Yingling, Lauren St. 
Clair, Oluwakorede Oylalami, Megan 
Fellows, and Jaiden Lanier. 
For the United States Military Acad-
emy at West Point: Vinh Ho and Char-
lotte Patterson. 
For the United States Merchant Ma-
rine Academy: Anthony Schmidt. 
Next, I want to recognize members of 
our community who have gone above 
and beyond. 
Let’s start with Officer Rebecca 
Pevehouse. Madam Speaker, I con-
gratulate Rebecca on her recent ap-
pointment as a field training officer in 
the Red Oak Police Department. I also 
recognize Rebecca for being awarded 
Enforcement Hero by MADD North 
Texas. The hard work Rebecca puts 
forth to keep our community safe has 
not gone unnoticed. I thank Rebecca 
for all that she does. 
It is an honor to recognize Priscilla 
Sanchez for more than 16 years of pub-
lic service in the Mansfield commu-
nity. Her outstanding performance as a 
senior code compliance inspector and 
then as the volunteer coordinator has 
helped strengthen the relationship be-
tween the residents and community 
members. 
I congratulate Connie Hickman on 
her retirement from Precinct 4 Justice 
of the Peace in Navarro County. It is 
an honor to recognize her for her near-
ly 40 years of public service to her com-
munity. 
I welcome Chris Young and congratu-
late him on his new position as an as-
sistant fire chief for the city of Red 
Oak. 
I congratulate Darrell Hull on his re-
cent new position as the city manager 
for Kennedale. Darrell brings a wealth 
of experience, and he previously served 
a 25-year career in Kennedale. The city 
of Kennedale is fortunate to have him 
in this position. 
Michael Watson is a sophomore at 
Southwestern Assemblies of God Uni-
versity in Waxahachie, Texas. He led 
SAGU’s baseball team to a 38–16 finish 
and was named this year’s NCAA Na-
tional Pitcher of the Year. Congratula-
tions to Michael and the team for their 
outstanding work and achievements. 
Next, let me highlight the Eagle 
Scouts. To become an Eagle Scout 
takes years of dedication and hard 
work. To achieve this rank, Scouts 
must complete 18 hours of community 
service and demonstrate leadership 
within their troop. Only 5 percent of 
Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout. 
This year, Ethan Miller reached that 
goal. I congratulate him. 
It is an honor to recognize Master 
Sergeant Roger Hardie for his 15-plus 
years of service in education in the 
Corsicana community. His outstanding 
performance as the Air Force JROTC 
instructor has helped strengthen the 
relationship between our students and 
community members. I thank him for 
his service. 
Ashley Perkins has been working as 
an emergency medical dispatcher in 
Mansfield for several years, and in 2021, 
she was named Emergency Medical 
Dispatcher of the Year. I thank Ashley 
for her continued service to the Mans-
field community. 
I congratulate Fox Luu on his new 
position as chief of police in Richland. 
Luu has been serving his community as 
a first responder for many years, and I 
am confident he will do so for many 
years to come. 
I congratulate Zoey Burt on starting 
her new position as sergeant in the 
Maypearl ISD Police Department. 
Ron Appleton has been well known in 
his community since 1966. He started 
out as an ag teacher at Waxahachie 
ISD and worked his way to district ad-
ministration. I personally congratulate 
Ron on having the Ron Appleton 
Agriscience Facility in Waxahachie 
named after him. It is a beautiful facil-
ity, and the impact Ron has had on his 
students is immeasurable. I thank him 
for all that he has done. 
Chantell Reiper was awarded Em-
ployee of the First Quarter from 
Navarro Regional Hospital for 2022. 
This award is a tribute to her coura-
geous and selfless acts working in 
healthcare. I truly appreciate all the 
work that Chantell does in physician 
practice and women’s services.

July 12, 2022 
I 
personally 
congratulate 
Fred 
Pontley on his retirement from being a 
distinguished lieutenant of the Ennis 
Police Department. It is an honor to 
recognize him for his 25 years of public 
service to the people of Ennis. 
This year marks the 75th anniversary 
of Navarro College. What started out in 
1946 with a group of returning veterans 
from World War II has now become a 
pillar in the community not only in 
Corsicana but also in Waxahachie. 
From the first class dubbed as the 
‘‘barracks bunch’’ to the students who 
graduated this year, Navarro College is 
dedicated to serving our community. 
Congratulations to Navarro College on 
75 years. 
I congratulate Jerry Lozier from 
Waxahachie Global High School on 
being named the Texas Association of 
Secondary School Principals Region X 
Assistant Principal of the Year for the 
2021–2022 school year. I thank Jerry for 
his commitment to Waxahachie ISD. 
Each year Mansfield ISD honors non-
teaching staff with the Shining Star 
Award for exceptional service and con-
tributions to their students and staff 
members. This year’s recipient was 
Brenda Stewart. As a crossing guard, 
each morning Brenda gets up to ensure 
the safety of all students going to 
Mansfield ISD. I thank Brenda for all 
her hard work and her dedication to 
her community. 
Congratulations to Chrisanna Melick 
on winning first place in the UIL State 
competition for journalism by leading 
the Waxahachie fine arts program. I 
pass on my sincerest congratulations 
to the team of Morgan Lenamond, 
Maven Navarro, Katie Walker, and 
Owen Bartosh. This entire team put on 
a 
brilliant 
performance 
to 
take 
Waxahachie High School to the top. 
I congratulate Greg Ellis on being 
named the new head football coach for 
Southwestern Assemblies of God Uni-
versity. I wish him good luck. 
I congratulate Elizabeth Tull on 
being awarded the Excellence in Com-
munity Service Award by the Rebecca 
Boyce Chapter of the national Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution and 
for being crowned the Crape Myrtle 
Queen at the annual Crape Myrtle Fes-
tival in Waxahachie. 
I congratulate Nolan Haisler on being 
recognized for 50 years of service as an 
H-E-B Ennis partner. Yes, that is 50 
years at H-E-B. This honor recognizes 
him for his commitment to the city of 
Ennis that will leave a lasting impact 
for many years to come. 
It is always a big deal when a small- 
town boy makes it to the big leagues. 
From Navarro College to SMU, and 
now with the Indianapolis Colts, I con-
gratulate 
Trevor 
Denbow 
on 
his 
achievement. He showed hard work 
pays off, and I know his family is very 
proud of him, as is the entire city. 
I congratulate Sonia Rivera on being 
awarded Detention Officer of the Year 
by the Navarro County Sheriff’s Office 
for 2021. 
I want to bring attention to five 
young women who earned the honor of 
receiving the Girl Scouts Gold Award: 
Dani DelVecchio, Samantha Aos, Julia 
Daniel, Caelin Whitley, and Camden 
Woolery. To receive this award, they 
each had to help fix a problem in their 
community or make a lasting change 
in their world. 
Dani worked with Legacy Oaks, a re-
tirement facility in Midlothian, to cre-
ate garden buckets for the residents. 
She and her volunteers built two gar-
den centers containing eight semi-self- 
sustaining garden buckets. The buck-
ets are housed in a structure that al-
lows easy access, regardless of a per-
son’s mobility level. Plants chosen for 
the gardens are easy to grow, high 
yielding, and compatible with each 
other, eliminating the need for pes-
ticides. The new gardens encourage the 
residents to go outside, socialize, and 
offer an ongoing activity. The newly 
formed Green Thumb Club at the facil-
ity will maintain the gardens using in-
structions Dani provided. 
Samantha partnered with the Texas 
Conservation Alliance and Ducks Un-
limited to address wood duck habi-
tation loss. After learning that north 
Texas is along the path of the central 
flyway, the primary flight route for 
migratory birds, Samantha created 
resting spots and safe havens to pro-
tect these birds from predators. To-
gether with her volunteers, Samantha 
built and installed 20 wood duck nest-
ing boxes in three counties in north 
Texas. The Texas Conservation Alli-
ance has agreed to monitor the boxes, 
which will provide homes for genera-
tions of wood ducks to protect the eggs 
from predators and support population 
growth. 
Julia’s project was designed to assist 
older individuals with the difficult 
task of downsizing. Working with her 
church, Julia identified individuals 
who needed to organize and declutter 
their homes. She set up consultations 
with each family and set goals and 
dates to sort through items. With vol-
unteer assistance, each family deter-
mined what they would donate, throw 
away, and keep during the process. The 
families were able to declutter in a 
positive way, even under difficult cir-
cumstances like a family death. The 
youth group at her church will con-
sider continuing this service with in-
structions on the process provided by 
Julia. 
Caelin used her love of performing 
arts to start a local theater company 
to serve youth. Working with an anon-
ymous donor and a local dance studio, 
Caelin was able to offer young artists 
the opportunity to be part of a theater 
production and work with professional 
actors at no cost. Twenty-three stu-
dents created a production together, 
running tech or being a part of the 
cast. With her volunteers, Caelin orga-
nized the rental of the performing 
space, the selection of the play, re-
hearsal planning, and all costuming. 
Using Caelin’s framework, The Troupe 
Theater has become a nonprofit organi-
zation that will offer low-cost theater 
experiences to local youth. 
Camden’s project supported The Out-
let Thrift Store, a nonprofit that helps 
fund camps and special projects for at- 
risk youth. The organization histori-
cally had difficulty processing dona-
tions quickly. Recognizing the rela-
tionship between inventory on the 
sales floor and potential revenue to 
benefit children, Camden built shelving 
units, added organizational bins with 
labels, and established a system to 
streamline 
the 
donation 
receiving 
process. The new system allowed mer-
chandise to be placed on the floor for 
sale in a much quicker and efficient 
manner. The store will maintain the 
new organization system moving for-
ward and use a similar process when 
they open new stores. 
These are just a few examples of 
some outstanding people living in 
Texas’ Sixth District. It is my privilege 
to honor them on the House floor. 
Every 
Sunday, 
after 
the 
‘‘joys’’ 
would come ‘‘concerns,’’ and there was 
never a shortage because everyone 
knew in Matthew he says: ‘‘Where two 
or three are gathered in my name I am 
in the midst of them.’’ It is no different 
today, and we face a great number of 
challenges in our country. 
So I ask that you keep all Americans 
in your prayers. 
Pray for our farmers and ranchers, 
who have faced incredible trials and 
tribulations these past couple of years 
as they continue to provide for all of 
us. 
Pray for those affected by the war in 
Ukraine as they face an aggressor who 
cares not for morality and willfully 
disregards the importance of human 
life. 
Pray 
for 
those 
affected 
by 
the 
fentanyl epidemic, which has dev-
astated our communities. 
Pray for the families who have lost 
loved ones and the innocent human life 
taken by human slavery as a result of 
the disarray in human trafficking at 
our border. 
Continue to keep the people of 
Uvalde, especially the families of those 
most affected, in your prayers. 
Keep those struggling with mental 
health in your prayers, and be a voice 
of light in a time of darkness to those 
who need help. Keep joy in your hearts, 
hope in man, and faith in God. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5973 
July 12, 2022 
published in the Congressional Record on 
June 21, 2022. 
This revision is for allowable adjustments 
for amounts for disaster relief, wildfire sup-
pression, and program integrity, pursuant to 
H. Res. 1151 (117th Congress), as provided in 
bills reported by the Committee on Appro-
priations. The amounts for disaster relief are 
contained in the texts of H.R. 8254, the Fi-
nancial Services and General Government 
Appropriations Act, 2023 and H.R. 8257, the 
Department of Homeland Security Appro-
priations Act, 2023. The amounts for wildfire 
suppression are contained in the text of H.R. 
8262, the Department of the Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act, 2023. Lastly, the amounts for pro-
gram integrity are contained in the text of 
H.R. 8295, the Departments of Labor, Health 
and Human Services, and Education, and Re-
lated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023. 
Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate 
spending levels for fiscal year 2023 and the 
allocation for the House Committee on Ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2023. For pur-
poses of enforcing titles III and IV of the 
CBA and other budgetary enforcement provi-
sions, the revised aggregates and allocation 
are to be considered the allocation included 
in H. Res. 1151 (117th Congress), pursuant to 
the statement published in the Congressional 
Record on June 21, 2021. 
Questions may be directed to Jennifer 
Wheelock or Kellie Larkin of the Budget

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
We acknowledge today, O Lord, Your 
power, mercy, and grace. We need Your 
power, for the challenges we face re-
quire more than human wisdom and 
strength. We need Your mercy, for we 
transgress Your law and fall short of 
Your glory. We need Your grace, for we 
cannot offer anything to merit Your 
favor or gain Your love. 
Lord, empower our Senators for to-
day’s journey. Give them confidence to 
draw near to You that they may find 
grace to help them in this time of need. 
May they pass their days in the com-
panionship of Your eternal presence. 
Enable them to learn the stewardship 
of time, energy, and abundance. And 
Lord, we continue to pray for Ukraine. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. We all know infla-
tion and the economy are the biggest 
problems facing Americans today. The 
New York Times released a poll just 
yesterday showing a full 93 percent of 
working-age Americans are dissatisfied 
with the state of our economy. We are 
a big and a diverse country. Ninety- 
three percent of Americans hardly ever 
agree on anything, but Democrats are 
unifying the country in unhappiness at 
the dark path down which they have 
taken our economy. 
Monmouth University released some 
data explaining why Americans are 
feeling so sour. Forty-two percent of 
Americans are struggling to stay afloat 
financially at the highest rate ever— 
ever—in this poll’s entire history, even 
higher than the darkest days, the days 
of the COVID pandemic. 
Sixty-three percent of Americans 
named economic issues as their chief 
concern. And they know who to blame 
for their misfortune: President Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats, 
who 
plowed $2 trillion into our economy 
last year and created the highest infla-
tion in four decades. 
I am sure many of my colleagues 
heard heart-wrenching stories from 
constituents struggling with inflation 
during the past 2 weeks’ State work pe-
riod. I certainly did in Kentucky, 
where 
the 
average 
household 
now 
spends more than $500 more a month 
than they did before President Biden 
took office. 
At a meeting with homebuilders in 
Northern Kentucky, local employers 
told me their businesses were poised to 
slow down dramatically. For 2 years, 
they struggled as Washington Demo-
crats’ exacerbated supply chain hiccups 
and 
worker 
shortages 
with 
free-
wheeling spending policies. Now, as the 
Fed tries to rein in inflation by hiking 
interest rates, home buyers have to 
contend with the most expensive bor-
rowing environment in over a decade. 
Homebuilders foresee their industry 
literally stalling out. 
In Paducah, I sat down with some of 
Western Kentucky’s barge operators. 
Like the homebuilders, they are con-
cerned with ongoing worker shortages, 
inflation, and of course spiraling fuel

costs. They also rightly worry that 
power outages could hit the Common-
wealth in the coming months. 
Washington Democrats pursued envi-
ronmental goals crafted by activists 
with no sense of how the real economy 
functions. They sidelined powerplants 
that use cheap, reliable energy sources 
without acknowledging that shortages 
would occur when the wind doesn’t 
blow or the Sun doesn’t shine. Inde-
pendent electricity reliability experts 
have been sounding the alarm that 
two-thirds—two-thirds—of the United 
States could endure electricity black-
outs this summer. 
Then, 
Kentucky’s 
ongoing 
labor 
shortage hit home during a meeting 
with bourbon distillers in our famous 
Bluegrass region. As the distillers ex-
plained to me, the programs imple-
mented by Washington Democrats in 
their $2 trillion spending package last 
year encouraged workers to exit the 
workforce and stay on the sidelines. 
The Commonwealth still has 20,000 
fewer workers—20,000 fewer workers— 
than we did before the pandemic. So 
hamstrung by a lack of employees, 
these Kentucky businessowners are 
watching 
apprehensively 
as 
Wash-
ington Democrats debate another dose 
of bad policies. 
This time, our colleagues are report-
edly cooking up a trillion dollars in 
massive tax hikes on things like small 
businesses and domestic energy. When 
you tax something, you get less of it. 
That is the way it works. I don’t know 
many Kentuckians who think America 
needs fewer small business jobs or less 
American energy. I am not certain 
about the good people of West Virginia 
either. 
One estimate has found that almost 
half of all the jobs in all of West Vir-
ginia are tied to small businesses, the 
vast 
majority 
of 
which 
are 
passthroughs. Half of all the jobs in the 
entire 
State 
are 
provided 
by 
passthroughs. 
I can’t imagine the people of Penn-
sylvania or Ohio or a number of other 
States are especially keen to have 
fewer small business jobs, higher prices 
passed on to consumers or less Amer-
ican energy either. Yet each of these 
States and many others have a Senator 
apparently keen—keen—to champion 
these bad ideas. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation has proven that the policies 
that Democrats are floating would 
completely break President Biden’s 
promise not to raise taxes on the mid-
dle class below $400,000. The JCT says 
their bad ideas would create a tax hike 
for more than a quarter of all Ameri-
cans who earn between $75,000 and 
$100,000 and more than half of the peo-
ple 
earning 
between 
$100,000 
and 
$200,000. They are taking President 
Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on 
anybody below $400,000 and putting it 
through 
the 
shredder—putting 
it 
through the shredder. 
This all-Democratic government has 
already spent America into runaway 
inflation, and now—now—they want to 
tax us into a recession. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, yesterday, I discussed the Su-
preme Court’s historic, courageous, 
and correct decision in Dobbs, but that 
landmark case was only part of the 
most consequential Supreme Court 
term in almost 70 years, since Brown 
overturned Plessy in 1954. 
For example, in the space of 1 week, 
the Court took two huge leaps forward 
for religious liberty. Two big steps to 
restore 
and 
strengthen 
Americans’ 
First Amendment right to pray and 
worship how they choose and raise 
their kids accordingly. 
Time and again, we have seen oppo-
nents of religious diversity argue that 
government 
ought 
to 
discriminate 
against faith-based undertakings and 
organizations. 
These 
efforts 
have 
spanned from the anti-Catholic Blaine 
amendments of the 1800s to today’s ef-
forts by the secular left to chase reli-
gion out of the public square. We have 
had Democratic politicians try to force 
nuns to pay for birth control against 
their will. Forty-nine of fifty Demo-
crats just voted for a radical bill that 
would have forced faith-based hos-
pitals—listen 
to 
this—forced 
faith- 
based hospitals to perform abortions 
against their principles. 
Last year, Washington Democrats 
tried to pass a sweeping toddler take-
over that was written to squeeze out 
faith-based childcare providers and sec-
ularize early childhood care in this 
country. For goodness’ sake—for good-
ness’ sake—5 years ago, a Lutheran 
preschool in Missouri had to argue all 
the way to the Supreme Court that it 
deserved equal access to widely avail-
able funding for updating an outdoor 
playground. 
Textbook 
anti-religious 
discrimination. Fortunately, they won 
easily 7 to 2. This is indeed a new Su-
preme Court. 
Last month, the Court took another 
landmark step. The case of Carson v. 
Makin arose because the State of 
Maine had established a school voucher 
program that tried to uniquely dis-
criminate against faith-based schools. 
In effect, the government was using 
taxpayer money to nudge families 
away from faith-based education and 
toward secular private schools instead. 
The Court rightly struck down that 
law. Chief Justice Roberts explained 
that Maine could not exclude accred-
ited and otherwise eligible schools 
purely because they are religious. That 
is not the government’s choice to 
make. It is up to the parents. 
A few days later, the Court issued an-
other important and commonsense rul-
ing. Joseph Kennedy, a high school 
football coach from Washington State, 
was fired—listen to this—simply be-
cause he quickly and quietly offered a 
simple prayer on the field after the 
game. He got fired for that. The man 
was fired by government bureaucrats 
for praying in our country. 
The Court ruled for Coach Kennedy 
under both the free speech and free ex-
ercise clauses of the First Amendment. 
Thank goodness. In the process, Jus-
tice Gorsuch and his colleagues cleared 
away many years of phony, made-up 
legal tests that made our laws need-
lessly hostile to religion and turned 
back to what the Constitution actually 
says. 
So the Court’s term was an exciting 
one for Americans of faith who simply 
want to be allowed to live out their 
faiths and raise their kids. But this 
was a win for the entire country. 
Americans of any faith and no faith at 
all can celebrate that we have a bril-
liant majority of originalist, textualist 
Justices who will defend all of our con-
stitutionally guaranteed freedoms and 
apply what the Bill of Rights actually 
says. 
In a better world, neither of these 
commonsense rulings would have been 
close calls or breaking news, but since 
they were, they were very good news 
indeed. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on June 
24, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 
Roe v. Wade, returning the question of 
abortion to the States and to the peo-
ple and their elected representatives. 
The Supreme Court’s decision was an 
affirmation of democracy, which had 
been set aside by Roe in favor of a na-
tional abortion regime imposed upon 
the entire country by a handful of ac-
tivist Justices. Roe took legislative 
power out of the hands of the people 
and put it in the hands of unelected 
Justices on nonexistent constitutional 
grounds. The Supreme Court’s decision 
puts the question of abortion back in 
the hands of the States and the people 
and 
their 
elected 
representatives, 
where it should always have been. 
I am profoundly grateful for this de-
cision, most especially because of what 
is at stake here, because the Roe deci-
sion was not a failure of constitutional 
jurisprudence on some arcane point; it 
was a failure that infringed on our 
most fundamental rights as human 
beings—in fact, on the fundamental 
right: the right to life. 
Roe not only allowed for but imposed 
a regime that forced States to legalize 
the killing of unborn human beings. So 
the decision to overturn Roe not only 
affirms democracy and repairs a con-
stitutional wrong, it allows for the 
righting of a profound moral wrong: 
the legal killing of unborn Americans. 
The Supreme Court’s decision does 
not, of course, make abortion illegal, 
but it will finally—finally—allow those 
States to choose to put in place protec-
tions for unborn children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3219 
July 12, 2022 
Since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion 
through all 9 months of pregnancy, 
more than 63 million children have 
been killed in this country by abor-
tion—63 million. It is an unfathomable 
number and, frankly, a heartbreaking 
number. To put it into some kind of 
perspective, that is more than twice 
the population of the State of Texas 
and more than 70 times the population 
of my home State of South Dakota. 
Sixty-three million. Sixty-three mil-
lion 
unique, 
unrepeatable 
human 
beings—future doctors and nurses and 
farmers and teachers and busdrivers 
and plumbers and scientists. That is a 
lot of innocent lives lost. 
And, yes, when we talk about unborn 
babies, we are talking about human 
lives. Members of the pro-abortion left 
would like to obscure this fact, but 
science and medical technology and 
plain old common sense, I would add, 
all clearly demonstrate the humanity 
of the unborn child. Every mom who 
has ever felt her unborn baby kick is 
well aware that she isn’t just carrying 
around a clump of cells, and ultrasound 
technology and medical advancements 
have made the humanity of the unborn 
child even more undeniable. It is im-
possible to hear the heartbeat of an un-
born child at 6 weeks and say that he 
or she is not alive. It is impossible to 
look 
at 
an 
unborn 
baby 
on 
an 
ultrasound kicking her feet and mov-
ing her hands and sucking her thumb 
and to pretend that she is anything but 
a human being. And human beings de-
serve to be protected. 
Democrats’ response to the Dobbs de-
cision has been predictably hysterical. 
We have heard cries to pack the Su-
preme Court because apparently the 
only legitimate Supreme Court is a Su-
preme Court that rules in line with 
Democrats’ policy preferences. We have 
heard cries to abolish the filibuster and 
to eliminate protections for the minor-
ity party in the Senate and the Ameri-
cans whom it represents. We have 
heard a proposal to establish abortion 
facilities in national parks. 
I am struggling to think of any fam-
ily who wants an abortion facility to 
be part of the itinerary offered on their 
trip to Yellowstone or the Badlands of 
South Dakota; but, apparently, some 
Democrats think our national parks 
should become abortion factories. 
Then, of course, there is the flood of 
misinformation out there falsely sug-
gesting that pro-life laws would pre-
vent women from getting essential 
medical care for miscarriages and ec-
topic pregnancies. And on top of all 
this, multiple Democrats have started 
a crusade against pregnancy resource 
centers. That is right. Pregnancy re-
source centers—which were established 
to provide moms in need with things 
like diapers and baby clothes, prenatal 
and parenting classes, help connecting 
with State and local resources, emo-
tional support, and agency referrals for 
moms who want to choose adoption— 
are now under attack by members of 
the Democratic Party. 
Apparently, 
the 
pro-choice 
party 
can’t stand the idea that women might 
be offered a choice other than abortion. 
When the Dobbs decision was handed 
down, the President called it a sad day 
for our country—a sad day. To the 
President and his party, apparently it 
is a sad day when the doors open to 
greater protection for human life and 
human rights. I would say that it is a 
sad day when the right to kill unborn 
human beings has become the signa-
ture issue of the Democratic Party, 
when the party that portrays itself as 
the defender of the little guy has be-
come the party that wants to deny 
even the smallest protection to the lit-
tlest guys and girls among us. 
The Democrats’ vision of America is 
not my vision of America. I believe 
that America is big enough to take 
care of both moms and their babies. We 
don’t have to pit moms and babies 
against each other. We can take care of 
them both. It is something the pro-life 
movement has been focused on for 
years and something that a number of 
States have worked to do with their 
Alternatives to Abortion programs. 
And I know that commitment will only 
grow in the wake of the Dobbs decision. 
Those who seek to deny human 
rights to some human beings are never 
found to be on the right side of history, 
as our Nation knows, to its sorrow. Our 
country was founded to protect human 
rights—the right to life, to liberty, and 
to the pursuit of happiness; but for al-
most 50 years now, our country has 
failed to protect the human rights of 
unborn human beings. 
Today, thanks to the Dobbs decision, 
we have a chance to change that. We 
have a chance to build a society where 
the life of every American is valued 
and where being small and vulnerable 
does not mean that your human rights 
are any less respected. At our best, we 
are a country that defends human 
rights, not denies them. We stand up 
for the innocent. We protect them. We 
fight for them. It is time to live up to 
that. 
The Dobbs decision gives us a chance 
to protect the human rights of the 
smallest and most innocent humans 
among us, but the Dobbs decision 
would never have happened without the 
tireless work of so many since the day 
Roe v. Wade was decided. It would 
never have happened without those 
who prayed, who offered help to moms 
in need, who fought for the rights of 
unborn Americans in elections, in 
courts, and in State legislatures. 
‘‘Speak up for those who cannot 
speak for themselves,’’ it says in the 
book of Proverbs, and for 50 years that 
is what members of the pro-life move-
ment have done. And it is their work 
that has brought us to this day when 
we finally, once again, have a chance 
to protect innocent unborn Americans 
in law. May the Lord reward their 
work and their wages be full from the 
Lord. 
I know that sometimes it seemed like 
the day when Roe v. Wade would be 
overturned would never come, but it is 
here. And while there is still much 
work to be done to ensure that the 
human rights of unborn Americans are 
respected and that moms and their ba-
bies have the support they need, it is, 
nevertheless, a moment for joy and for 
gratitude. I am profoundly grateful for 
this decision, profoundly grateful that 
we now have the opportunity to move 
closer to the day when we fully live up 
to our founding principles and ensure 
that every American—born or unborn— 
has the opportunity for life, for liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Texas. 
INFLATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, month 
after month, week after week, day 
after day, family budgets are being bat-
tered 
by 
inflation—inflation 
made 
worse by the reckless spending habits 
of the Federal Government and par-
ticularly of the Biden administration. 
Gas prices are up nearly 50 percent 
from a year ago, and grocery bills—as 
any of us can see when we go to the 
grocery store—have soared. From eggs 
to milk to meat to produce, everyday 
essentials cost more today than they 
did last year. 
The pain of inflation is having a dra-
matic impact on the American people. 
This quote from the New York Times 
yesterday sums it up pretty well: 
Widespread concerns about the economy 
and inflation have helped turn the national 
mood decidedly dark, both on Mr. Biden and 
the trajectory of our nation. 
It is a sentiment I have heard over 
and over again in my conversations 
with my constituents in Texas, and it 
is one that is increasingly visible in 
public surveys. A recent poll from the 
New York Times and Siena College 
found that more than three-quarters of 
voters think that the United States is 
headed in the wrong direction—three- 
quarters of the country. Only 13 per-
cent said the country was on the right 
track. 
With voter confidence at a con-
cerning low, our Democratic colleagues 
have made an interesting calculation. 
They are trying to resurrect their 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda. Now, you 
may remember this bill, which was 
called Build Back Better, but I think it 
can more accurately be described as 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ or ‘‘Build Back 
Bankrupt.’’ This bill went out with a 
whimper last year because our Demo-
cratic colleagues didn’t even have the 
support among their Members to pass 
it in an evenly divided Senate where 
the Vice President breaks the tie. 
So they have now chosen this mo-
ment, for some reason, to bring it 
back. To have a shot at passing this 
proposal, our Democratic colleagues 
have slimmed and trimmed the bill, 
but it still packs a painful punch, espe-
cially where it has to do with energy 
prices. 
Last month, the national average of 
gasoline exceeded $5 a gallon for the

first time on record—5 bucks a gallon, 
plus. Since then, prices have fallen 
some, but the national average today is 
still $4.66 a gallon. Now, that is better 
than $5, but it is certainly no reason 
for celebration, and it still costs al-
most 40 bucks more to fill up a pickup 
truck today than it did a year ago. 
In standard fashion, the Biden ad-
ministration has tried to blame some-
one else. Mr. Biden has implausibly 
blamed Vladimir Putin for the high 
price of gasoline. So rather than ac-
knowledge the impact of its own poli-
cies which have discouraged invest-
ment in new production, new supply, 
the administration is trying to blame 
the very energy companies that we are 
depending on to produce more oil and 
gas so we can make more gasoline and 
so we can bring the price down. 
I have heard from oil and gas pro-
ducers in Texas who are working to 
ramp up production and bring down 
prices for consumers. It is as if the law 
of supply and demand has somehow 
been repealed during this administra-
tion. They simply don’t get it that if 
you want to bring down the price of 
something, you need to increase supply 
or reduce demand. This administration 
doesn’t understand that it is not as 
simple as just pushing a button on a 
machine to increase output. This is a 
process that takes time. It takes in-
vestment. It takes time to build the 
pipelines and the infrastructure. It 
takes time to drill the wells and 
produce the oil and send it to the refin-
eries to make into gasoline and jet 
fuel. 
While industry is working to increase 
supply, 
Washington 
Democrats 
are 
looking for new ways to put an even 
tighter squeeze on domestic energy. 
You would have thought that the Rus-
sian invasion of Ukraine demonstrated 
the irresponsibility of not maintaining 
multiple accesses to energy. As a mat-
ter of fact, Mr. Putin had convinced 
most of Europe to depend solely on 
Russian supply, and then when that is 
no longer available or when he uses it 
as a weapon, they are looking around 
for alternatives. But they are not easy 
to come by. They take time, and they 
take some investment. 
According to reports, we are hearing 
that our Democratic colleagues are 
considering a new tax that would re-
quire energy producers to pay hefty 
fees if they emit more methane than 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
would 
allow. 
Natural gas accounts for about 40 
percent of our electricity, double the 
amount of renewable resources. You 
know, we are having a hot spell in 
Texas. I know it is July. It is always 
hot in Texas in July, but we are having 
a particularly bad spell of 100-degree- 
plus days in my hometown of Austin, 
TX, and across the State. And one of 
the problems is that, for some reason, 
the wind that we depend on to produce 
electricity from wind turbines has died 
down during this hot period, so not 
only do you have the constraints on 
natural gas and other sources of en-
ergy, but now even renewable sources 
like wind are not producing as much 
electricity as we need in order to main-
tain the grid, in order to maintain 
things like air-conditioning. 
Hitting producers of natural gas with 
a methane fee and other proposed tax 
hikes isn’t going to change the fact 
that we need natural gas to keep the 
lights on. We have seen emissions re-
duced by about 15 percent over recent 
years, primarily because the country 
has transitioned from coal to natural 
gas. You would think that would be 
something that we would celebrate, 
and certainly our energy supply con-
tinues to transition as we come up 
with new and different ways to satisfy 
our demand and our economy’s need for 
affordable energy. 
One change this tax that our Demo-
cratic colleagues are considering would 
have is on energy costs for American 
people. Electricity costs are already up 
12 percent from last year, and with this 
new methane fee, they would certainly 
rise even more. So instead of policies 
that would reduce the pain at the pump 
and at the grocery store of sky-high 
prices, actually, our Democratic col-
leagues are considering policies that 
would make it worse. 
I understand this proposal is still in 
the drafting phase, but it is an example 
of the sort of things that our col-
leagues are considering in their ‘‘Build 
Back Broke’’ reconciliation bill. Last 
go-around, the ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ in-
cluded tax credits for rich people buy-
ing expensive electric vehicles. Now, 
most of my constituents in Texas can’t 
afford an $80,000 electric vehicle, but if 
you are a well-to-do person and you 
can pay that price, you will get a tax 
credit, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the 
Federal Government and our Demo-
cratic colleagues. But you won’t get it 
if you are buying a used car on a park-
ing lot because you need to take your 
kids to school or you need to be able to 
drive to work. 
Our colleagues also propose to pro-
vide billions of dollars in taxpayer- 
funded rebates and grants to cover the 
cost of retrofitting private homes—not 
public buildings but private homes. 
While the climate policies would be 
sure to hurt working families, another 
piece of this proposal would give the 
richest Americans another cause to 
celebrate. The so-called millionaire tax 
break has been scrapped and revived 
many times over the past few years. It 
is extremely unpopular among working 
families for a very simple reason: It al-
lows millionaires and billionaires in 
blue States to pay less Federal taxes. 
It is a tax cut for millionaires and bil-
lionaires. That is the proposal. 
When our colleagues tried to include 
this provision in their most recent par-
tisan spending attempt, the price for 
this tax cut for millionaires and bil-
lionaires was $285 billion. That is quite 
a tax cut for the wealthiest people in 
America. 
According to the liberal Tax Policy 
Center, 93 percent of those making a 
million dollars or more would receive a 
tax break averaging about $48,000—a 
$48,000 tax cut for people making a mil-
lion dollars or more or at least 93 per-
cent of them. 
So this isn’t an attempt to support 
those who are struggling to make ends 
meet or to bring down high prices that 
are wiping out family budgets; it is a 
get-out-of-jail-free 
card 
for 
the 
wealthiest people in America who don’t 
want to pay their fair share of taxes. 
Under this proposal, two-thirds of 
those making more than a million dol-
lars would receive a tax cut next year. 
Nearly 90 percent of those earning be-
tween $500,000 and a million dollars 
would receive a tax cut. These aren’t 
the families who have been forced to 
buy just a few bucks’ worth of gasoline 
because they can’t afford to fill up 
their car or remove items from their 
shopping list because they simply find 
them to be too expensive or have to 
make conscious choices for cheaper 
items at the grocery store in order to 
feed their family to deal with inflation. 
We are talking about not making their 
life better but making life maybe a lit-
tle bit better for the wealthiest of 
Americans. 
If this proposal were enacted, about 
70 percent of the benefit would go to 
the top 5 percent of earners; that is, 
people making $366,000 a year—roughly 
six times the median income in Texas. 
The millionaires who stand to gain 
the most from this change are those 
who live in blue States like New York 
or California that have higher State 
and local taxes. They would get to de-
duct up to $80,000 of their State and 
local taxes and send the bill to the 
American taxpayer. 
Working families in Texas should not 
be forced to subsidize the tax bill for 
Manhattan millionaires. Inflation is al-
ready pummeling folks in Texas. The 
last thing we need to do is to send 
more tax breaks to the wealthiest of 
Americans, who are not hurting at this 
time when the vast majority of Ameri-
cans are hurting. 
Well, I guess it shouldn’t be a sur-
prise when the majority leader of the 
Senate is from New York and the 
Speaker of the House is from Cali-
fornia, two of the highest taxing States 
at the State and local level. And I un-
derstand they are hearing from their 
constituents saying: We want our old 
tax break back that we lost in 2017. But 
you shouldn’t prioritize tax breaks for 
the wealthiest of your constituents 
over dealing with the rising costs of 
working families. 
This proposal won’t ease the burden 
that Americans are facing or help our 
country build back better; it will en-
sure 
that 
we 
never 
reach 
the 
prepandemic economy that was the 
envy of the world. No PR blitz or no 
spin doctoring can hide the truth about 
this reckless tax-and-spending spree 
proposal that apparently the majority 
leader is considering. It wraps ill-con-
ceived tax plans, irresponsible spend-
ing, and hurtful energy policies into 
another partisan exercise.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3221 
July 12, 2022 
And let’s get this straight. No Repub-
lican is going to vote for this. So if, in 
fact, our Democratic colleagues can 
pass it—and they can if all 50 Senators 
on the Democratic side and the Vice 
President vote for it—it will be they 
who own it and who will be account-
able to the American people in the up-
coming midterm elections. But it is 
fair to ask where have these policies 
gotten us so far. 
While the administration has kept its 
foot on the neck of domestic energy 
policy while the President is making, 
apparently, a trip to Saudi Arabia to 
talk to Muhammad bin Salman about 
increasing Saudi production of oil—not 
here in America, which would create 
jobs, which would create more supply, 
arguably bring down price at the 
pump—he is going hat in hand to a for-
eign leader in a nondemocratic country 
and saying: Will you please open the 
spigot just a little bit more? 
I think it is embarrassing. 
We have also seen our Democratic 
colleagues spend nearly $2 trillion on a 
party-line vote earlier this year that 
helped ignite inflation to its current 
40-year high levels. This new tax-and- 
spending spree—or, I should say, the 
old tax-and-spending spree bill which is 
now being repackaged and presumably 
resold—won’t be any different from the 
earlier one. 
So it isn’t time to hand out tax 
breaks to the well-off or push our coun-
try toward unrealistic energy goals at 
a time of more demand and not enough 
supply. We need more domestic energy 
supplies. That would provide relief for 
working families and a shot at waking 
up from the economic nightmare that 
we find ourselves in. 
So 
this 
reconciliation 
bill—this 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ bill that is appar-
ently being contemplated by our Demo-
cratic colleagues—is not the solution. 
It is making the problem worse. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). 
The 
Senator 
from 
New 
Hampshire. 
NATO SUMMIT 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am 
really pleased to be able to come to the 
floor this morning to join my col-
leagues Senator TILLIS, from North 
Carolina; Senator ERNST, from Iowa; 
Senator BLUNT, from Missouri—and we 
are hoping to be joined by Senator 
COONS, from Delaware—to talk about 
the very successful congressional dele-
gation we took in the first week of the 
2-week break to Finland, Sweden, and 
the NATO summit in Madrid. 
I want to especially acknowledge my 
colead for that delegation, Senator 
TILLIS. He and I cochaired the Senate 
NATO Observer Group. And we have 
both been fervent supporters of NATO 
and efforts to ensure that the United 
States continues to be a leader on the 
world stage and a champion for free-
dom. 
We were also joined on that trip by 
Senator DURBIN, from Illinois, and Sen-
ator FISCHER, from Nebraska. 
A couple of months ago, Majority 
Leader SCHUMER and Minority Leader 
MCCONNELL asked Senator TILLIS and I 
to lead that bipartisan delegation to 
the NATO summit in Madrid to convey 
the Senate’s strong bipartisan support 
for 
the 
alliance, 
especially 
amid 
Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine. 
I was very honored to represent the 
Senate amid what has been one of the 
most consequential moments in the 
history of the transatlantic alliance. 
And I think probably Senator TILLIS 
and everyone who was part of that del-
egation felt the same way. 
Our visit to Sweden, Finland, and 
Spain affirmed three important points: 
first, the NATO alliance is stronger 
than ever before—and this year’s his-
toric summit reaffirmed that; second, 
the Strategic Concept that was ap-
proved at this year’s summit will en-
sure that NATO is prepared to address 
immediate threats on all fronts, from 
Putin’s attempts to threaten the sov-
ereignty of our allies to China’s chal-
lenges to our alliance. 
And, finally, as Putin attempts to re-
write history, working with our allies 
and partners is critical to ensuring 
that Putin or any leader that attempts 
to follow in his path is met with the 
might of NATO’s democratic resolve. 
One of the other things that I was 
very impressed with as we met not just 
with some of our NATO allies but with 
NATO aspirant country delegations 
and talked to leaders from the Indo-Pa-
cific who were in Madrid is how every-
body we talked to reaffirmed the im-
portance of America’s leadership in the 
world. So I think as we think about the 
future of NATO, about what we need to 
do in the United States, it is important 
to remember just how important our 
role is. 
Now, our trip coincided with Tur-
key’s announcement to support Fin-
land and Sweden’s ambitions to join 
NATO, 
which 
will 
significantly 
strengthen the alliance. In fact, as we 
landed in Madrid, we got the news that 
Turkey had dropped its hold on those 
applications. So we were able to cele-
brate. 
Sweden and Finland’s accession into 
NATO sends an unmistakable message 
to Putin: The alliance is stronger than 
ever and Russia does not have veto 
power over who joins NATO. 
Our delegation was pleased to meet 
with the leadership from both Sweden 
and Finland to reaffirm the bipartisan 
support in the Senate for the swift ap-
proval of their NATO applications. 
Our delegation’s bipartisan message 
of support for Ukraine and NATO was 
reciprocated by our allies, which was 
evident during the meetings that we 
had with Japan and Germany. We met 
with Ukrainian officials and under-
scored our strong support to not only 
help Ukraine defend itself but to help 
Ukraine win. And that is what we 
heard from all of the allies we met 
with. 
It is critical that, as Members of the 
Senate, we continue to do all we can to 
coordinate with our allies and support 
Ukraine’s heroic efforts to defend itself 
against 
Putin’s 
aggression 
because 
that war is not just against the people 
of Ukraine; it is an attack on democ-
racies around the world, an attack on 
our shared transatlantic values—values 
that have maintained peace for over 70 
years. 
Our bipartisan delegation made clear 
that the United States will continue to 
support peace and stability in Europe 
and around the world. We will defend 
every inch of NATO territory and con-
tinue to look for ways to bolster 
Ukraine’s defense. 
We were pleased to share this com-
mitment with members of the Biden 
administration who also traveled to 
the NATO summit. Our delegation met 
with President Biden, with Secretary 
Austin, and Secretary Blinken and re-
affirmed that the Senate will continue 
to look for ways to help defend Ukraine 
and respond to emerging threats from 
the Balkans to the Indo-Pacific. 
Again, I want to thank all of those 
who went on this very important trip, 
especially the staff who did such a 
great job putting it together. I was 
proud to colead that delegation, which 
was centered on our bipartisan resolve 
to support a strong and unified NATO 
and stand by our Ukrainian partners. 
As Putin’s war threatens democ-
racies around the world, I think it is 
important that we send a clear mes-
sage to our constituents at home and 
our allies abroad that the United 
States remains resolute in our commit-
ment to the stability and freedom of 
all democratic nations because if Putin 
succeeds in Ukraine, there is no telling 
where his belligerence will end. 
Last night, Senator DURBIN secured 
unanimous consent for the protocols to 
the North Atlantic Treaty on the ac-
cession of Sweden and Finland to be re-
ferred to the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. This is an important devel-
opment as we look at ratifying those 
protocols. I hope we can get this done 
as quickly as possible. I hope the For-
eign Relations Committee will move on 
that process and we can act here in the 
Senate Chamber because swift ratifica-
tion is in our national security inter-
est. 
Again, I am pleased to join my col-
leagues here on the floor and would 
like to turn it over to Senator TILLIS 
to get his impressions from the trip. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I want to 
thank Senator SHAHEEN and my col-
leagues on the floor here—Senators 
COONS, ERNST, BLUNT, and the others 
who joined the bipartisan delegation at 
the NATO summit. It was an extraor-
dinary opportunity to see firsthand 
how the democratic world looks at the 
United States for leadership. 
It was an extraordinary opportunity 
to talk about Russia’s aspirations. It 
was an extraordinary opportunity to 
talk about what I think may go down 
as the greatest miscalculation in this 
century on the part of Vladimir Putin. 
Months ago, when he was massing 
troops at the Ukrainian border, he

July 12, 2022 
called it a special military operation, a 
training exercise, for a little while. 
What he was thinking in the back of 
his head was that now was the time to 
test NATO’s resolve; now was the time 
to see if the differences that we have 
was enough to break an alliance. 
What he found out was quite the op-
posite. Shortly after February 24, the 
NATO countries came together, the EU 
came together. We implemented sanc-
tions. We provided troops on the 
ground to assist with the evacuation of 
Ukrainian refugees. 
And now we are in a position of pro-
viding support for the very courageous 
members of the Ukrainian military. 
What else did he get for his mis-
calculation? Two nations that, for dec-
ades, have been nonaligned, Sweden 
and Finland. Eight hundred and thirty 
miles of Russian border is now about to 
be the back door or the front yard of 
NATO. And when Finland and Sweden 
ultimately get membership in NATO, 
which I expect to be in weeks or 
months, then Vladimir Putin needs to 
understand his reward for invading a 
sovereign nation is 830 miles of NATO 
borders right next door. 
Now I want to talk a little bit about 
Finland and Sweden. They are extraor-
dinary 
countries—advanced 
democ-
racies, the rule of law, a great defense 
industrial base in Sweden, home to 
Saab. They manufacture jet fighters 
that are NATO interoperable. 
Finland is already spending in the 2- 
percent threshold for NATO and want-
ing to go further. Finland has 64 joint 
strike fighters on order. If the United 
States was going to have as many— 
they are a nation of about 51⁄2 million 
people—if the United States was going 
to have as many F–35s as Finland on a 
per capita basis, we would need thou-
sands of them. We have less than 200. 
They are committed to defense. They 
are a strong army, a strong ground 
force. Russia knows that; just look 
back to 1939. 
And then in Sweden, we have a de-
fense industrial base and a Navy that 
covers the Arctic. It covers the Baltics. 
They are going to be net distributors of 
security the day that they get NATO 
membership. 
I had somebody a couple of weeks 
ago—from time to time, I go to the 
front office, and I take calls from con-
stituents. I had someone call up and 
say, Why are you supporting—why are 
you focused on Ukraine? Why are you 
focused on Finland and Sweden when 
we have so many things we need to do 
back here at home? 
I said, We have to do both because 
the future of our safety and our free-
dom at home is intrinsically linked to 
the safety and security of Europe. 
This weekend, I was moving some 
furniture around. I came across a globe 
I have had for 40 years. It has a picture 
of the Soviet Empire on it. Vladimir 
Putin wants to recreate that and ex-
pand it. This doesn’t end. And I told 
the caller this: It doesn’t end in 
Ukraine. It is one step of several chess 
moves that Vladimir Putin would like 
to play out and, ultimately, dominate 
the free world. We can’t let that hap-
pen. 
When we were at the NATO summit, 
I think it was very clear—at least to 
me—that those whom we met with, the 
heads of state, feel like now more than 
ever is the time America has to lead, 
that America has to understand the 
threats that exist: a rising China, a 
threatening Russia, a malign group of 
leaders in Iran. Now is the time for us 
to look outward and preserve the free 
world. 
How do we do that? We make NATO 
stronger. We admit Sweden. We admit 
Finland. And we continue to work to-
gether to recognize emerging threats in 
the Pacific Rim. 
I think at the end of the day, to the 
American citizen who is wondering 
why do we worry about NATO, why do 
we worry about Ukraine? Because it is 
directly linked to the future of our sov-
ereignty and our safety here at home. 
I want to thank the President for his 
contribution at NATO, as well. We met 
with him for about an hour last week. 
We had a press conference a little later 
in the day, and people wanted to ask us 
about domestic policies. I said, We are 
a bipartisan group here to talk about 
our commitment to NATO and our 
commitment to having Putin fail in 
Ukraine. We can have our differences 
back home, but there is no daylight be-
tween the Republicans and the Demo-
crats who were on that codel with re-
spect to the future of our commitment 
to NATO and a future to our commit-
ment to the free world. 
I hope that we will move swiftly to 
pass the treaty, to be one of the first to 
recognize that we want and welcome 
Sweden and Finland into the NATO al-
liance. And then we need to continue 
to remind people at home why it is im-
portant. Although it is not in our back-
yard, it is in a part of the world that if 
we let this stand, if we don’t act with 
unity, then we will live to regret it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. I rise to join the leaders 
of the codel that I just had the honor 
and blessing of joining, Senators SHA-
HEEN and TILLIS, and a number of the 
other members of that codel, Senators 
ERNST and BLUNT. And I was grateful 
for the chance to travel with Senators 
DURBIN and FISCHER. I want to just join 
in my colleagues’ statements today. 
I think this was a tremendous oppor-
tunity for us in Sweden and in Finland 
to meet with nations that are advanced 
economies, that are closely aligned 
with our values, that have sophisti-
cated militaries, and that now, for the 
very first time, are seeking admission 
to NATO. NATO is the most successful 
security alliance in world history, and 
it is rooted in shared values and shared 
concerns and interests. 
One of the most vulnerable pieces of 
NATO, if you looked at the map just a 
few months ago, were three little Bal-
tic States—Latvia, Lithuania, and Es-
tonia—that, for decades, were under 
the heel of the Soviet Union. They 
were relatively newly independent in 
recent decades, admitted to NATO, but 
very difficult to defend. 
One of the reasons I joined with my 
colleagues to say here, as we did in Ma-
drid, that we should swiftly ratify the 
joining to NATO of both Sweden and 
Finland is that they will provide secu-
rity. They will be security contributors 
to this alliance. The odds that a young 
man or a woman from Iowa or North 
Carolina, from Missouri, New Hamp-
shire, or Delaware will have to go de-
fend Estonia, will have to go risk or 
give their life to defending Latvia or 
Lithuania will go down dramatically if 
we have on that border, at the very 
northern end of the NATO alliance, a 
new 830-mile border between Finland 
and Russia. The Russians know they 
will have to defend and pay attention 
to it given the unique history of 1939– 
1940 war. And where countries aligned 
with our values and priorities are going 
to continue to contribute to the impor-
tance of this alliance. 
It was valuable that in our meetings 
with heads of state from Europe, like 
Chancellor Scholz from the Indo-Pa-
cific, like Prime Minister Kishida from 
Japan, in conversations with foreign 
Secretaries like Liz Truss of the United 
Kingdom, or meetings with foreign 
Ministers of Italy and of Germany and 
of France and of Spain, that this dele-
gation was able to speak with one voice 
and to articulate why we join the 
Biden administration in supporting 
NATO accession for these two critical 
new partners. 
The last point I want to make is that 
I am hopeful—I am optimistic—that we 
will continue to provide unified bipar-
tisan robust support for Ukraine’s 
brave and fierce defense of its Nation 
and its sovereignty in the face of Rus-
sia’s war crimes, Russia’s continued 
aggression. We are calling on all of our 
NATO allies to step up and to con-
tribute and to participate. And they 
are. This has brought greater unity, 
greater purpose, greater focus to the 
NATO alliance than anything in dec-
ades. 
I will remind you, the one time that 
the article 5 sacred obligation to come 
to each other’s defense has been trig-
gered before was in Afghanistan. Thou-
sands and thousands of NATO soldiers 
served alongside ours in Afghanistan 
when it was the United States that was 
attacked on 9/11. This NATO alliance is 
stronger than it has ever been and 
needs to be the strongest it has ever 
been, because, as my colleagues both 
laid out clearly and concisely, this is a 
pivotal moment in the future of the 
United States and our role in the 
world, the future of NATO and Western 
freedom. 
We must make sure we succeed. I am 
so grateful for the bipartisan commit-
ment that was at the core of this dele-
gation. 
I yield to my colleague.

ator from Iowa.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3223 
July 12, 2022 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleagues, especially Sen-
ators SHAHEEN and TILLIS, for leading 
an incredibly successful congressional 
delegation to the NATO summit. I 
want to thank them, as well, for orga-
nizing the colloquy today. 
I join them in enthusiastically en-
dorsing Finland and Sweden’s acces-
sion into NATO. Both nations have rep-
resentative governments accountable 
to their people. They conduct extensive 
commerce and trade with our great 
United States, and, broadly, they share 
many of our values. 
Historically, perhaps these were con-
ditions sufficient to readily welcome 
two European nations into one of our 
multinational 
security 
frameworks, 
but today, given the increasingly com-
plex threats our adversaries are impos-
ing on the homeland, protecting Amer-
ican security and prosperity demands 
partners who are capable of sharing 
NATO’s manpower and resource bur-
dens. 
NATO isn’t a club of democracies or 
a playground for exploring climate 
change or progressive cultural inter-
ests. It is a military alliance that is as-
sembled to deter our adversaries from 
wreaking havoc on our partners and 
against our own homeland. 
Today, the United States is the un-
questioned and undisputed leader of 
not just NATO, but continues to lead 
the global coalition containing and de-
stroying terrorist operations in the 
Middle East and in Africa. Beyond Eu-
rope and the Middle East, the United 
States must—and I will repeat that— 
must lead a coalition to deter China’s 
looming imperial expansion around the 
world and potential takeover of Taiwan 
and our other partners in the Indo-Pa-
cific. 
The United States has the greatest 
military on the face of the planet, and 
the American people’s support of our 
Armed Forces is unwavering. 
Still, our Commander in Chief, our 
diplomatic and military leadership, 
and Members of the Senate must hold 
our partners accountable to their own 
defense and not lean on the reach and 
lethality of our soldiers, sailors, air-
men, marines, and guardians alone. 
Going forward, NATO member coun-
tries must invest in their own defense. 
Two percent must be a minimum 
standard. Longstanding members of 
the alliance remain far too lax and 
sometimes neglectful of their obliga-
tions to the alliance and to their peo-
ple. America is not the world’s police-
men, but we are the leader of the free 
world and this alliance. And Finland 
and Sweden are on target regarding 
their 2-percent commitment. 
I am confident that Finland and Swe-
den are ready to stand up and help 
shoulder 
the 
resource 
burden 
on 
NATO’s military obligations in Europe, 
particularly following Russia’s bloody, 
lawless invasion of Ukraine. 
The accession of Finland and Sweden 
to NATO is a great success, but regard-
ing the war raging in Ukraine today, 
on day 140 of this conflict, the U.S. 
cannot grow weary. Our resolve to sup-
port our partner must carry on. China 
is watching. The Gulf States, South 
America, and Africa are weighing their 
commitment to the free world against 
the economic and security guarantees 
on the table from our adversaries. 
Our national defense capacity dimin-
ishes the more our adversaries, from 
the Taliban to Iran’s cluster of violent 
extremist organizations, to Vladimir 
Putin, 
to 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, can call our bluff and see if we 
cannot bear the cost of achieving our 
goals. 
We must remain steady and strong. 
This administration and our partners 
in NATO must change their strategy to 
deliver Ukraine victory over Putin’s 
Russia, and that is why Sweden and 
Finland will be a much welcomed addi-
tion to NATO. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for or-
ganizing this colloquy, and I urge this 
body to move very quickly to confirm 
the U.S. support of Finland and Swe-
den’s accession to NATO. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Missouri. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I know 
we have a vote coming up. I have brief 
remarks, and I ask unanimous consent 
to complete them before the vote 
starts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
join with my five colleagues who have 
been here today and the two people 
who were with us, Senator DURBIN and 
Senator FISCHER. 
I would say one of the great things 
about this effort was the unanimous 
feeling that all seven of us had about 
both what is happening in NATO and 
our commitment to win in Ukraine. We 
were able to demonstrate that to every 
group we met with from every country 
we met with. I think with the strong 
leadership of Chairmen SHAHEEN and 
TILLIS that it made an impression on 
where we were and the unity we have 
on this. 
It would be interesting to know if 
Putin was more surprised by the 
Ukrainian resistance, the poor per-
formance of his own military, or my 
guess would be he may have been most 
surprised by what has happened at 
NATO—the great turnaround of the 
NATO—the current NATO countries 
and their commitment to NATO, their 
commitment to what they have been 
willing to do and pledged to do with 
NATO and then to see these two in-
credibly important security contribu-
tors join NATO after 73 years of being 
neutral and an important part of the 
world and saw that as part of their 
long-term commitment. 
But both Finland and Sweden, which, 
by the way, have been NATO contribu-
tors for some time now in terms of 
being willing to be part of NATO mis-
sions, training with their future NATO 
allies—all that is incredibly important, 
but these countries not only bring in-
credible 
security 
contributions 
to 
NATO, they also bring significant geo-
graphic contributions to NATO. When 
you look at a map, suddenly not just 
Norway, which has been in NATO, but 
Sweden and Finland in NATO has an 
incredible impact on the ability of 
what happens in the Baltic. That is im-
portant to us as we look to the future. 
Now, with the exception of Russia, 
every country that borders and has 
part of a claim on the Arctic will be a 
NATO country. This is a part of the 
world we have been talking about 
much more the last 5 years than we did 
the previous 25 years. To have this 
NATO unity as we look at the Arctic is 
an important thing. 
The 800-mile border that Finland has 
shared for years and defended for years 
against Russia doubles the NATO bor-
der in Europe. 
The 
intimate 
understanding 
that 
both Sweden and Finland have of Rus-
sia brings a different point of view and 
a helpful point of view to NATO. 
For the current members, particu-
larly the new members of NATO, when 
you look at these Baltic countries of 
Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania and 
then look at Poland and Romania, see-
ing what happens when the unity is 
created and the force multiplier is 
there—I have heard my colleagues al-
ready talk about the jet planes, the 
submarines, the navy, the air force 
that both of these people bring, the 
cyber ability that both of them bring 
to the fight is real. 
You know, in a meeting that I was in 
before this meeting occurred with the 
Latvian Defense Minister, the Latvian 
Defense Minister, one of the newest 
members of NATO, one of the most vul-
nerable members of NATO as we have 
looked at NATO for some time, said: 
We don’t want to be rescued by NATO; 
we want to be defended by NATO. 
I think today, as we see the growth of 
NATO, we see a NATO that is willing 
to do its job defending its members in 
this most successful alliance of all 
time. There has never been anything 
like it. President Truman was the lead-
er in putting this together in 1949. Here 
we are 73 years later. In my view, 
NATO not only has its largest group of 
members but also its most powerful 
and committed group of members in 
the history of this alliance. 
I look forward to being on the Senate 
floor when the Senate does its job to 
welcome Sweden and Finland to NATO, 
and I am pleased that process has 
started. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF STEVEN M. DETTELBACH 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, last 
week on the Fourth of July, a day 
meant to celebrate freedom and inde-
pendence, we witnessed another act of 
senseless violence—this time, in the 
Chicago suburb of Highland Park. 
Yet again, more Americans have been 
murdered while going about their daily 
lives—this time, attending an Inde-
pendence Day parade. 
Yet again, a community grieves. Yet 
again, we ask: How many times are we 
going to allow this to happen? 
The bipartisan gun safety bill was 
important—long overdue progress, fi-
nally. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
keep up that work together and take 
another important step in protecting 
Americans from violent gun crimes by 
confirming a permanent ATF Director. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
President 
Biden’s 
nominee, 
Steve 
Dettelbach, from Cleveland, to be Di-
rector of the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms, and Explosives. 
There is no better person for this role 
than Steve Dettelbach, a son of Ohio, a 
career public servant, with the experi-
ence and the record to combat violent 
crime and keep Americans safe. 
As U.S. attorney for the Northern 
District of Ohio, Steve worked with 
law enforcement, including ATF, to 
prosecute tough cases. 
I have known Steve Dettelbach for 
years. I have watched him tackle some 
of the Department of Justice’s most 
sensitive cases—cases at the intersec-
tion of law enforcement and civil 
rights. 
He prosecuted a White supremacist 
who tried to burn down First Azusa Ap-
ostolic Faith Church, a predominantly 
Black church in my wife’s home county 
of Ashtabula, in a community called 
Conneaut, OH. Steve not only pros-
ecuted the man responsible, he helped 
create a clergy group, United Against 
Hate. 
When he prosecuted the firebombing 
of the largest mosque in Northwest 
Ohio, Steve, a practicing Jew, attended 
worship services there as a show of sol-
idarity. He has lived the value of reli-
gious freedom. He has consistently 
stood up against extremism and hate. 
Steve Dettelbach understands that 
politics must play no role in running 
the ATF. His experience, his record 
bear that out. That is why he has broad 
support from across the ideological 
spectrum, including prosecutors, in-
cluding law enforcement officials who 
understand what it takes to do this job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3225 
July 12, 2022 
This includes law enforcement groups 
like NOBLE, the National Organization 
of Black Law Enforcement Executives; 
the Hispanic American Police Com-
mand Officers Association; Women in 
Federal Law Enforcement; the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice; the Major County Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation; the National Sheriffs’ Associa-
tion. 
It includes more than 140 former Fed-
eral prosecutors, 8 former ATF Direc-
tors, the Federal Law Enforcement Of-
ficers Association, the association rep-
resenting the men and women of the 
ATF. 
He has the support of civil rights or-
ganizations—the 
National 
Urban 
League, the Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights, and faith or-
ganizations like the Jewish Federation 
of North America. 
They understand that Steve is the 
right person to lead this vital law en-
forcement Agency. 
Following the horrific shooting in 
Highland Park, local law enforcement 
was able to capture the murderer so 
quickly because of the help provided by 
the heroes—the men and women of the 
ATF. 
Yet there are some out there who not 
only don’t want an ATF Director, for 
whatever reason, they may oppose 
Steve Dettelbach. That is not even it. 
They want to abolish the ATF entirely. 
That is one stupid idea. 
You know who thinks that it is a ter-
rible idea? Every single law enforce-
ment officer who has to combat gun 
crimes on a daily basis. They know 
how 
important 
the 
ATF 
is, 
even 
though some fringe politicians and just 
some fringe, conspiracy-minded char-
acters think the ATF should be abol-
ished. 
Abolishing the ATF, these law en-
forcement officers argue, rightly—abol-
ishing the ATF would make our com-
munities less safe. 
In 
their 
letter 
endorsing 
Mr. 
Dettelbach, the National Sheriffs’ As-
sociation said that he would work to 
bring ‘‘people together by working 
closely with state and local law en-
forcement to ensure that resources are 
adequately allocated to combat violent 
crime.’’ 
The sheriffs went on to write they 
appreciated Steve’s ‘‘goal of being a 
value-add to local law enforcement by 
not only adding resources to urban 
areas, but rural as well.’’ 
Rural crime and rural terrorism and 
rural—abuses like that are just as like-
ly in rural areas as cities. 
Mr. Dettelbach has emphasized the impor-
tance of ‘‘boots on the ground’’ task forces 
and pledged to provide forensic help to local 
law enforcement at crime scenes. 
Sadly, our local law enforcement per-
sonnel need this help. Fortunately, the 
ATF, with Steve Dettelbach, I hope, 
confirmed and soon at the helm, will be 
there to provide that help. 
I can think of no better way to sup-
port law enforcement, to reject hate, to 
keep 
Americans 
safe 
from 
violent 
crime than for the Senate to confirm 
Steve Dettelbach ATF Director. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting his confirmation. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate will vote on Steve 
Dettelbach’s nomination to lead the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives—better known as ATF. 
As I said on the floor yesterday, after 
describing in horrifying detail the mass 
shooting in Highland Park on the 
Fourth of July, we need a confirmed 
ATF Director now more than ever. 
When a mass shooter tears apart a 
community like Highland Park, IL—or 
Buffalo, NY—ATF agents are among 
the first to arrive on scene. In fact, in 
the hours following the attack in High-
land Park, it was ATF agents who 
traced the firearm belonging to the 
confessed shooter. Their investigate 
work was described by local authorities 
in Lake County as ‘‘phenomenal.’’ I 
couldn’t agree more. 
The least we can do to support these 
heroic agents is confirm a proven lead-
er to head the ATF, which has gone 7 
years without a Senate-confirmed Di-
rector. 
Our country and our communities de-
serve better. They deserve an ATF that 
is fully equipped to respond on our Na-
tion’s darkest days—and to enforce the 
laws on the books to prevent these 
tragedies in the first place. 
And Steve Dettelbach is exactly the 
right leader for this challenge. He is a 
career prosecutor with decades of expe-
rience fighting crime, religion-moti-
vated violence, gun trafficking, and he 
is a proven consensus-builder with bi-
partisan support. 
The vote on Mr. Dettelbach’s nomi-
nation is not about a new policy or reg-
ulation; it is about enforcing the laws 
that already exist, and respecting the 
men and women of ATF who deserve 
Senate-confirmed leadership. This vote 
is a pragmatic step all of us can take 
toward making our communities safer. 
Guns are now the leading cause of 
death for American children. And we 
have more than one mass shooting per 
day in America. In the wake of High-
land Park, Uvalde, Buffalo, and too 
many tragedies across America, it is 
clear that we need experienced and 
dedicated law enforcement leadership 
in agencies like ATF. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in supporting Mr. 
Dettelbach.

RECOGNIZING LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL 
GRADUATES 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my friend the Senator from 
Iowa for giving me a moment of per-
sonal privilege. 
I also want to acknowledge our col-
league who has been the Presiding Offi-
cer. I want to acknowledge our col-
league who was presiding prior to you 
coming to the chair and acknowledge 
that it is her birthday today, a great 
day of celebration across Arizona and 
elsewhere. 
Mr. President, I will only rise for a 
moment, and I appreciate my friend 
the senior Senator from Illinois being 
here for this. I want to acknowledge 
my youngest daughter, Eliza, and her 
fellow classmates from the London 
Business School—not LSE; the London 
Business School—where, last Wednes-
day, I attended their graduation. My 
hope is that every one of these young 
men and women who are going to be 
from across the world—the United 
States, the UK, Nigeria, Lebanon, 
Israel, India, Singapore, and a host of 
other countries—one, I wish them all 
well. I know they are going to con-
tribute 
to 
economies 
and 
growth 
around the world. 
I also believe that almost all of them 
now are going to go off their family’s 
payroll at this moment in time after 
they have received this great, distin-
guished MBA they received from the 
London Business School. 
I do appreciate, again, my friend the 
Senator from Iowa giving me the cour-
tesy of this quick acknowledgement 
and recognition. 
With that, I yield the floor and yield 
to my friend the senior Senator from 
Iowa. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
WHISTLEBLOWERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
back to the floor for reasons that my 
Senator friends are tired of hearing me 
talk about all the time, but I have 
come back to give you a specific exam-
ple of retaliation against whistle-
blowers, Agencies of the government 
not answering letters that we have 
sent, and also what I believe is some 
political interference in some of my 
oversight work. Today, it deals specifi-
cally with the Department of Veterans 
Affairs—as we know it around here, the 
VA. 
On April 2 of last year, 2021, I sent 
letters to the VA and the VA Office of 
Inspector General based on allegations 
from multiple whistleblowers. Those 
whistleblowers reported numerous eth-
ical violations, retaliation, and pos-
sible leaking of market-sensitive infor-
mation that may have affected retail 
investors. I have been waiting more 
than a year for a response to my in-
quiries. 
Emails obtained through the Free-
dom of Information Act by a govern-
ment watchdog group called Empower 
Oversight show that career public serv-
ants at the VA prepared a response to 
my letter over a year ago, but when it 
came time for the Secretary of the VA, 
McDonough, to send that letter to my 
office, senior Biden political officials 
blocked it. It appears that Biden-ap-
pointed VA officials have issued an 
order not to respond to my request, and 
I have a pretty good reason why. 
We know that the VA received these 
allegations from whistleblowers early 
on, and the VA ignored them. Whistle-
blowers alleged, among other things, 
conflicts of interest between a senior- 
level VA official and a company rep-
resented by her husband. This official, 
Charmain Bogue, has since left public 
service. The company that employed 
her husband, Barrett Bogue, is entitled 
‘‘Veterans 
Education 
Success,’’ 
or 
VES. 
On multiple occasions, starting in 
December of 2017, an employee at VA 
sought guidance from VA lawyers on 
whether Ms. Bogue should recuse her-
self on procurement-related matters. 
The lawyers affirmed that Ms. Bogue 
should recuse herself, and the employee 
even copied Ms. Bogue on that guid-
ance of recusal. The employee also 
alerted VA leadership of Ms. Bogue’s 
need to recuse herself. Ms. Bogue never 
recused herself, but the VA employee 
was reportedly removed from Federal 
service. Now, that is retaliation. That 
is unjustified. It should never happen. 
In response to my letter about these 
and other allegations, the VA Office of 
Inspector General immediately opened 
an investigation. The VA Office of In-
spector General uncovered more wrong-
doing than originally thought, and I 
have four points that they uncovered. I 
am only going to go into those four. 
Ms. Bogue participated in matters in-
volving her husband’s employer, con-
trary to ethics guidance. Ms. Bogue’s 
interaction with that company vio-
lated the apparent conflict rules. Ms. 
Bogue did not provide sufficient detail 
to VA ethics about her spouse’s busi-
ness. No. 4, Ms. Bogue refused to co-
operate fully in the OIG’s investiga-
tion. 
These are only some of the allega-
tions that I have received. 
The VA Office of Inspector General 
did not review the allegations of whis-
tleblower reprisal; nor did it inves-
tigate whether VA employees mis-
handled nonpublic information. 
I raised questions about all of these 
issues, and to date, I have had no sub-
stantive 
communication 
from 
Sec-
retary McDonough about any of these 
questions I have raised. So what is the 
VA hiding? What else did the VA know 
or choose to ignore? 
Congress 
needs 
answers 
not 
stonewalling. Independent government 
watchdogs and whistleblower advocates 
have called on the VA to review gov-
ernment grants and screen for compa-
nies and individuals who have engaged 
in wrongdoing. They have also urged 
the VA to consider whether those indi-
viduals or entities should be able to ob-
tain government contracts in the fu-
ture.

S3227 
July 12, 2022 
I would be very interested to know 
whether those who refuse to cooperate 
with an OIG request can still obtain 
taxpayer money through government 
contracts. The Biden administration 
has claimed, time and again, that it is 
the most transparent administration in 
U.S. history. Well, I think I just gave 
you an example that that is not true, 
and it certainly hasn’t been true, in 
this case, for emphasis. 
The VA deserves much better. Of 
course, the VA serves our veterans, and 
our veterans deserve much better from 
that Agency. The VA needs to start 
being as transparent as they claim to 
be transparent and cooperate with this 
investigation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the economic crisis that the American 
people are living through, caused by 
Joe Biden. 
The American people have just had 
the most expensive Fourth of July of 
all times. It is interesting what a dif-
ference a year and a half makes. Last 
July, 6 months into the Biden adminis-
tration, the White House was insisting 
inflation was either nonexistent or 
transitory. The White House even 
bragged that the cost of a July 4 cook-
out last year had dropped 16 cents—not 
16 percent but 16 cents—from the year 
before. Here we are, 1 year later, with 
1 year of Democratic control, and the 
cost of that same cookout is up not 
just 16 cents but 16 percent. Ham-
burgers, hot dogs, potato salad—across 
the board—everything is up. This July 
4, the only way to save money was to 
stay home. 
According to one survey, one out of 
every three Americans changed their 
summer travel plans for this summer 
because of high gas prices. People are 
driving less; they can’t afford gas. 
They are shopping less; they can’t af-
ford the food, and they are getting a 
lot less from their paychecks. 
The New York Times says people—I 
was astonished by this—are even using 
up vacation days so they don’t have to 
drive in to work because they cannot 
afford the gas. They are using vacation 
days so they don’t have to drive be-
cause they can’t afford the gas. The av-
erage American family is now paying 
$100 more each and every week just to 
buy the same things that they bought 
a year ago. So just to stay even is $100 
more a week this year than last. Week 
after week after week, in the Joe Biden 
economy, people can afford less and 
less and less. One study from the Uni-
versity of Michigan showed the Biden 
era had already seen the steepest drop 
in disposable income since Herbert 
Hoover. 
Who could believe it? 
The savings rate right now is the 
lowest since the great recession of 2009. 
Household debt is the highest ever. 
People are trying to borrow or spend 
their savings just to keep up and to 
maintain the sorts of things they could 
afford easily last year. Consumer con-
fidence in this country, right now, is at 
an alltime low. The concern, of course, 
is that the worst may yet be coming. 
More and more experts say we are 
headed toward a recession. A recession 
is when the economy shrinks for 6 
months in a row. 
Two weeks ago, the Commerce De-
partment updated their estimate of 
economic growth for the first 3 months 
of the year, and the update said the 
economy had grown even less and had 
shrunk more than they had thought. 
The economy shrank more than the 
Biden Commerce Department admitted 
to in their first assessment, but there 
are already signs all around the coun-
try that the economy is shrinking. No 
wonder, in a national poll last week, 
only 1 in 10 Americans thinks the econ-
omy is heading in the right direction. 
Inflation plus a recession is called 
stagflation. I don’t think we have had 
that since the days of Jimmy Carter, 
likely when the Presiding Officer was 
either a little boy or hadn’t yet been 
born. 
Democrats have run Washington for 
17 full months now, and they are doing 
absolutely nothing here at home to 
bring down the pain at the pump or the 
pain at the grocery store. 
Joe Biden says gas prices will remain 
high for ‘‘as long as it takes.’’ He says 
we just have to suffer through it, and 
he blames everything today on the war 
in Ukraine. He won’t admit to the fact 
that the inflation crisis started 10 
months before the war in Ukraine. Gas 
prices had already gone up by $1.15 a 
gallon before Putin’s invasion. 
The American people get it. They re-
member all of this. It doesn’t matter 
what Joe Biden happens to say. Of 
course, he is off to Saudi Arabia tomor-
row, looking for more oil, when we 
have plenty of it in the United States. 
The American people clearly know who 
to blame for the inflation that is caus-
ing them pain every single day. 
It is interesting to see that even 
Jimmy Carter’s economists blame Joe 
Biden and the Democrats in Congress 
for the inflation that is hitting the 
country today. 
Last week, the New York Times pub-
lished 
an 
interview 
with 
Jimmy 
Carter’s top economic advisers. They 
were asked what lessons they had 
learned from the miserable failures of 
the 
Carter 
administration. 
Jimmy 
Carter’s Secretary of the Treasury, Mi-
chael Blumenthal, put the blame for 
today’s inflation on the spending by 
Joe Biden and the Democrats. This is 
Jimmy Carter’s Treasury Secretary 
pointing his finger at Joe Biden and 
the Democrats. Jimmy Carter’s Treas-
ury Secretary said that Democrats 
need to give up the gimmicks, turn off 
the money printer, and stop the reck-
less spending. 
This is at a time when, behind closed 
doors, Senator SCHUMER and others are 
trying to come up with another gim-
mick to add more spending and higher 
taxes. 
This article in the New York Times 
says: 
Mr. Blumenthal urged Mr. Biden . . . to 
abandon his [Build Back Better bill]— 
I call it ‘‘Build Back Biden.’’ He said 
he should abandon that— 
in favor of deficit reduction. 
He said: 
[F]ighting inflation comes first. . . . [B]y 
trying to take half measures . . . you merely 
prolong the pain. 
The American people are tired of the 
pain that has been imposed upon them 
by Joe Biden and the Democrats in this 
body and across the floor. 
Well, he is right. Jimmy Carter’s 
Treasury Secretary is right. Fighting 
inflation needs to come first. Yet, for 
Joe Biden, fighting inflation has come 
last or not at all—denial that it even 
existed, dismissing it as ‘‘don’t worry,’’ 
and continuing today to try to avoid 
the reality that he is facing. 
You know, the Democrats in this 
body could learn something from the 
Carter administration. After all, Joe 
Biden has an even lower approval rat-
ing. It is hard to believe. I would have 
never believed, on the day Joe Biden 
was inaugurated, that by the Fourth of 
July weekend of 2022 that Joe Biden 
would have earned—fully earned—an 
approval rating lower than Jimmy Car-
ter had. Remember, Jimmy Carter lost 
his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan. 
So far, Democrats seem to have 
learned nothing. Last March, Repub-
licans warned the Democrats that their 
spending and borrowing would cause 
inflation. Democrats ignored the warn-
ing. 
Senator SCHUMER even said: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation . . . 
in the near term are very real. 
That may have been a New Yorker’s 
view of it, but people around the coun-
try had a clear understanding that in-
flation was coming, and it did. It 
turned 
out 
Senator 
SCHUMER
was 
wrong, and the dangers were very, very 
real for working families. 
So the rich liberals in New York and 
the rich liberals in California who run 
the Democratic Party will be just fine. 
It is the working families who are try-
ing to pay their bills every day—they 
are the ones who are paying the price 
for these reckless policies of the Demo-
cratic Party. 
Democrats remain completely out of 
touch with American workers. It is ob-
vious. Last March, all 50 Senate Demo-
crats put an additional $2 trillion on 
the national debt. The Biden inflation 
crisis started, and the fire of inflation 
started 1 month later. 
Last week’s New York Times article 
also quotes a Carter Treasury official 
who warned against socialist price con-
trols with regard to energy. So what 
did the House Democrats just do? They 
just voted for socialist price controls. 
Now Senate Democrats seem to be 
eager to do the same thing. 
Democrats are ignoring the warning 
signs once again. It seems they refuse

to learn the lessons of the Carter years. 
What have the Democrats learned in 
the last 18 months—anything? I don’t 
think they have learned a thing, espe-
cially with regard to American energy. 
Joe Biden is continuing to restrict 
American energy, is continuing to give 
speeches against American energy, and 
then is going hat in hand to Venezuela, 
to Iran, and now, this week, to Saudi 
Arabia, saying: Please produce more 
energy. 
This is the first time in 64 years that 
there will be no offshore energy lease 
sales this year—the first time in 64 
years. Joe Biden is now considering 
blocking all offshore oil and gas leases 
for the next 5 years—no jobs for the 
people, no affordable energy for the 
folks and the families. No. He is just 
now lifting his blockade on onshore oil 
and gas leases that has been there 
since day 1 of his administration. Why 
is he doing it now? Well, he is doing it, 
kicking and screaming, because the 
Federal court forced his hand. After 17 
months 
in 
office, 
when 
President 
Obama was there, they had held 40 
lease sales. Joe Biden’s energy strategy 
has now sunk us to a new low. 
What is he doing now? What is the 
President’s new approach? Because he 
wants to just belittle people in energy 
who make their livelihoods that way. 
I mean, it is astonishing, the Presi-
dent of the United States tweeting 
about mom-and-pop gas stations in 
your neighborhood and mine. It is hard 
to believe, but it is true. Last week, 
the President of the United States 
tweeted a demand that gas stations 
bring down their prices. If only it were 
that easy. 
You wonder, what does President 
Biden really understand about the way 
the world works and about the lives 
that people lead? 
Prices aren’t set by gas stations, and 
prices 
aren’t 
set 
by 
Presidential 
tweets. They are set by supply and de-
mand. It is economics 101. Gas stations 
aren’t the problem. Gas stations would 
love to bring down prices overall. They 
can’t do it. If demand is down because 
people can’t afford to drive, that will 
lower the prices a bit. Today, the aver-
age is about $4.65 a gallon. On the day 
Joe Biden came into office, it was $2.38 
a gallon. We are still at almost double 
the cost of a gallon of gas today, under 
Joe Biden and his policies, than we 
were the day he took office. 
If you want to really lower prices at 
the pump and get to where we were on 
the day that Joe Biden came into of-
fice, we need more American energy. 
We have it. We have it here in the 
United States, and Joe Biden and the 
Democrats will not let us get it out of 
the ground. 
So what are the Democrats in the 
Senate doing about these repeated fail-
ures by Joe Biden? 
Well, right now, they are, once again, 
threatening another reckless tax-and- 
spending spree. They are planning a re-
peat of what got us into this inflation 
crisis in the first place. It is terrible 
economics, and it is not even good poli-
tics. So just before the midterm elec-
tions, the Democrats are attempting to 
pass legislation that is going to make 
America’s problems even worse. 
They are proposing another reckless 
spending bill, and it is more reckless 
than the one last year because infla-
tion is a lot higher now. Spending even 
more money is going to make today’s 
prices go even higher. 
According to media’s report, the lat-
est version of the Democrat bill in-
cludes more than $100 billion in new 
taxes. Nobody knows exactly what is in 
it. We hear up to a trillion dollars in 
taxes. Many of these taxes are going to 
fall on American energy producers. If 
you have higher taxes on energy pro-
ducers, who do you think is going to 
end up paying that? The people who 
have to use energy, who are the men 
and women going to work filling up 
their cars with gas, trying to take 
their kids to school, cutting back on 
vacations because they can’t afford the 
gas. 
The Secretary of the Treasury says, 
Well, you don’t like the high price of 
gas? Buy an electric car. 
Easy for him to say. Electric vehicle 
prices are up because of Joe Biden’s in-
flation. They are 20 percent higher now 
than they were a year ago. How many 
Americans can go out and afford to buy 
one of these very expensive electric ve-
hicles? Very few. 
We are talking about a clueless ad-
ministration, a clueless President, and 
a clueless Secretary of Transportation 
and Secretary of Energy who have pro-
moted such policies. 
Joe Biden should remember that in 
2008, Senator Barack Obama said this: 
[Y]ou don’t raise taxes in a recession. 
This is Senator Barack Obama in 
2008, Presidential candidate Barack 
Obama in 2008: 
[Y]ou don’t raise taxes in a recession. The 
last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in 
a recession. 
Yet that may be the party platform 
of the Democrats for this November. 
The Democrats’ attacks on American 
energy have been relentless. They are 
obsessed with stopping the use of fossil 
fuels, absolutely obsessed and worship-
ping at the altar of energy that is de-
pendent on the weather. That is what 
they are proposing. The Democrats 
think that that is the winning sales 
pitch going into November. 
Democrats I talk to privately admit 
that they expect to be stripped of 
power in November, NANCY PELOSI no 
longer Speaker of the House, her ef-
forts to make sure that the Repub-
licans are in the majority in the Sen-
ate. Democrats know the clock is run-
ning out on them, that they are not 
going to be able to do something like 
reconciliation 
to 
force 
down 
the 
throats of the American people, costly 
policies, tax increases, and regulations 
that the American people would never 
be in support of. 
This is their last hope, their last Hail 
Mary pass to put into place policies of 
the progressives that will help their 
group but hurt the country. It is abso-
lutely wrong. It is one final try of the 
Democrats to increase spending, in-
crease taxes, and, of course, increase 
the debt. 
It doesn’t seem the Democratic Party 
nationally or those on the Hill seem to 
care about that and the suffering of the 
American 
people 
who 
are 
living 
through the highest inflation in 40 
years. The highest gas prices of all 
time until recently, massive debt, mas-
sive concerns, and incompetence—that 
is what the American people are look-
ing at right now, and that is why, come 
November, what I believe, many, many 
Members, elected Democrats in the 
House and Senate, will be heading to 
the unemployment line. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nominations of 
Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez to be the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Health Affairs, Dr. Agnes Schaefer to 
be Assistant Secretary of the Army for 
Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and Mr. 
Franklin Parker to hold the same posi-
tion within the Navy. 
The office Dr. Martinez-Lopez is 
nominated for is responsible for ensur-
ing that we are medically ready to 
fight and win wars. This is a critical 
role for our national security at all 
times, but, of course, it is even more 
important during a pandemic. 
Leaving this office without leader-
ship jeopardizes our ability to respond 
to this health crisis and prepare for the 
next one. Having spent more than two 
decades as an Army surgeon and com-
mander of medical centers at major 
U.S. military bases both stateside and 
overseas, and more than a decade as a 
leader of private medical research or-
ganizations, Dr. Martinez-Lopez clearly 
has the experience to fill this position. 
The Assistant Secretaries for Man-
power and Reserve Affairs across the 
branches ensure our military and civil-
ian workforce have the education, the 
training, and the skills needed to meet 
current and future threats. Mr. Parker, 
who is nominated to head this office 
for the Navy, has demonstrated his 
ability to fill the role and will be able 
to hit the ground running, having held 
the position before. 
Dr. Schaefer, nominated to head this 
office for the Army, will bring first-
hand knowledge from her 15 years at 
the RAND Corporation, where she spe-
cialized in military personnel policy, 
reserve component issues, national se-
curity strategy, and emerging threats. 
All three of these positions play im-
portant roles in our national security. 
All three nominees to fill them were 
voted out of committee—a committee 
on which the Senator from Missouri 
serves—without objection—without ob-
jection—4 months ago. But all three re-
main vacant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3229 
July 12, 2022 
The Senator from Missouri, as some-
one who serves on the Personnel Sub-
committee of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, I know would know better than 
most the issues our military branches 
and the troops face. These include re-
cruitment and retention challenges, 
ensuring safe workplaces, including 
implementing IRC reforms to prevent 
and respond to sexual assault and sex-
ual harassment within the ranks, and 
addressing the high suicide rate among 
troops and veterans—all issues which 
impact military readiness. But there is 
a hold on all DOD nominees. 
I am unaware of any substantive ob-
jections to these nominees based on 
their qualifications or their ability to 
serve, reasons which we have a con-
stitutional duty to review based on our 
advice and consent role. 
My understanding is that the Sen-
ator from Missouri is implementing a 
blanket hold based on general policy 
disagreements with the Biden adminis-
tration. In addition to our advice and 
consent role, the Senate has oversight 
responsibilities, and that is a place 
where the Senator from Missouri, as a 
member of the Personnel Committee of 
the Armed Services Committee, has 
the responsibility of oversight of the 
three offices that we are discussing 
today. He has a way to ensure that 
once these three nominees are con-
firmed, he and his colleagues can 
evaluate their performance. With act-
ing, nonconfirmed officials in these 
roles, that oversight authority is un-
dermined. 
As a Senator, we are afforded ex-
traordinary powers to advance policies 
or even just to make a point, but these 
powers should be used in accordance 
with our constitutional responsibil-
ities. The President of the United 
States has the responsibility to nomi-
nate qualified individuals to fill these 
roles, and he has. These individuals are 
qualified, and now we have the respon-
sibility to confirm them so that they 
can get to work for our servicemem-
bers and for the American people. 
I will now yield to my friend and col-
league Senator KAINE. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise and 
thank my colleague from Hawaii for 
stating plainly the qualifications of 
these candidates. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, I have had a chance to re-
view their qualifications. And as the 
father of a U.S. marine, I agree whole-
heartedly with the Senator’s conten-
tion that these three positions would 
be very important to fill at a time 
when the United States has so many 
security challenges. 
Anticipating a productive dialogue 
with my colleague from Missouri, I 
would like to ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate consider the following 
nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 779, 
780, 781; that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc without inter-
vening action or debate; that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table; that any state-
ments related to the nominations be 
printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I would like to say a 
word, if I could, about the nature of my 
objection. 
It has been now almost a year since 
the attack at Abbey Gate in Kabul in 
Afghanistan, almost a year since we 
lost 13 American servicemembers in 
that tragic attack, almost a year since 
hundreds of American civilians were 
left behind enemy lines, abandoned by 
this administration to fend for them-
selves against our enemies. And that 
attack claimed the lives, among the 13, 
of 
CPL 
Jared 
Schmitz, 
from 
Wentzville, MO. 
I was thinking of Corporal Schmitz 
again just the other day when I was 
driving past the bridge in Wentzville 
that will soon be named for him. I am 
glad that Corporal Schmitz is getting 
some of the honor that he deserves, but 
let’s be honest. As his father said to me 
just hours after we learned of his 
death: What would be far better—far 
better, indeed—would be for Corporal 
Schmitz, who is a very young man, to 
be with us. He was just at the begin-
ning of his service, just at the begin-
ning of his life. And while he was 
proud, I am sure, to give his life for his 
country—it is what he volunteered to 
do—we owe it to him, I owe it to him, 
to try and find out why—why—this at-
tack at Abbey Gate happened. How was 
it that a civilian evacuation was not 
ordered in time? Why was it that this 
administration ignored repeated warn-
ings from military commanders on the 
ground about the dangers that were 
mounting in Kabul in Afghanistan? 
Why was the withdrawal a debacle? 
Now, I want to give central command 
some credit. They have commissioned 
an investigation on this point and 
issued a report, and I have some of it 
here with me. This is just the unclassi-
fied portion. It is 6,000 pages long. I 
will tell you, having been through all 
of it with my team, it is very exhaus-
tive. It took them months to do. They 
interviewed 
commanders 
on 
the 
ground. 
They 
interviewed 
military 
members who were there at the time. 
They interviewed State Department of-
ficials and DOD officials. 
Their conclusions that are set out 
here in this report are truly, truly 
stunning. What they found is that mili-
tary commanders repeatedly warned 
the White House—repeatedly—that the 
situation in Afghanistan was deterio-
rating rapidly, that the danger to 
American troops were high, that the 
danger to American civilians was high 
and, indeed, potentially lethal. And 
what did the administration do? It ig-
nored these warnings. 
The CENTCOM investigation shows 
that Tony Blinken’s State Department 
and Jake Sullivan’s National Security 
Council dragged their feet for weeks 
and, indeed, months on end. It shows 
the State Department wouldn’t even 
talk about an evacuation—wouldn’t 
even speak of it—until it was too late. 
And the worst of it is, after this 
botched withdrawal, after this tragic 
loss of life, the administration took ef-
forts to cover up what had happened. 
And we are still in the midst of this 
coverup. 
Just last November, Homeland Secu-
rity Secretary Mayorkas testified—tes-
tified—that—and I am quoting him 
now: 
Biometric and biographic information was 
collected from every individual evacuated 
from Afghanistan. 
Every individual, that is his state-
ment. 
He testified that the administra-
tion—I am quoting him now: 
(T)ook a whole-of-government approach, 
ensuring that Afghans arriving in the United 
States have been thoroughly screened and 
vetted. 
That simply is not true, and we know 
it isn’t true because the DOD inspector 
general just released a report debunk-
ing it, finding that U.S. Agencies did 
not use available data when vetting Af-
ghan evacuees, finding that some evac-
uees 
with 
derogatory 
information 
could not be located, including individ-
uals whose latent fingerprints have 
been found on improvised explosive de-
vices and are known or suspected ter-
rorists. 
Here is my point: Almost a year after 
this tragedy, almost a year after this 
debacle, there has still been no ac-
countability. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. 
Mr. HAWLEY. No accountability. 
There has been no one fired. There has 
been no one relieved of command. This 
administration has stonewalled. They 
have dragged their feet. They have re-
fused to cooperate. Oh, we have had 
hearings, and they have had briefings 
almost entirely behind closed doors. 
Here is my request. It is what I prom-
ised Corporal Schmitz’s father I would 
do on the morning that I spoke to him, 
that I would seek accountability for 
what happened in Afghanistan, and 
that is exactly what I intend to do. It 
is what I have been doing, many a time 
have I been on the floor for the last 11 
months seeking accountability. And I 
have been stonewalled at every single 
turn. 
What I have asked for months on end 
is that the Armed Services Committee 
hold a public hearing on this investiga-
tion—a 
public 
hearing—not 
behind 
closed doors, not without the press, not 
cut off from the American people—a 
public hearing, and I have been denied 
every time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3230 
July 12, 2022 
So what I am going to do today is I 
am going to enter this report into the 
RECORD so that the American people 
can see what U.S. Central Command 
found. And until we have that account-
ability in public, I will continue to ask 
that the Senate observe regular order 
and actually vote on these nominees. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. KAINE. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, if my col-
league from Missouri would yield for a 
series of questions, I want to make 
sure that I understand the objection. I 
certainly understand the objection as 
indicated with respect to seeking ac-
countability for Afghanistan. I under-
stand that point. 
Is it correct that in the committee, 
however, you supported each of the 
three nominations who are proffered on 
the floor today? 
Mr. HAWLEY. A parliamentary ques-
tion, Mr. President: Do I have the floor 
when I respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has yielded for a question. So he 
has the floor. 
Mr. HAWLEY. But I am not asking 
the question. He is asking me the ques-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. But you 
were the one who yielded to the Sen-
ator from Virginia for a question. So 
you still maintain the floor. 
Mr. HAWLEY. No, I have yielded the 
floor. My remarks were concluded. So 
the Senator has the floor. I am happy 
to respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the 
Senator yield for a response? 
Mr. KAINE. I will yield for a re-
sponse, yes. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Say it one more time, 
Senator. I can answer. 
Mr. KAINE. My question was: I be-
lieve, in the Armed Services Com-
mittee, these three individuals, you 
supported their nominations for report-
ing to the floor. And I just want to 
make sure that I am accurate about 
that. 
Mr. HAWLEY. That is incorrect, Sen-
ator. I reported as a no. 
Mr. KAINE. On all three? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. KAINE. Is it the Senator’s posi-
tion today that you do not object to 
them individually but there are other 
Members of your caucus who individ-
ually object to them? 
Mr. HAWLEY. I do object to them, 
Senator. Are you asking me if I object 
to having a vote on them? Or are you 
asking me if I object to them? 
Mr. KAINE. I will rephrase the ques-
tion. 
Do you object to having a vote on 
them? So, for example, I can modify 
the motion to suggest to seek unani-
mous consent that we schedule a vote 
on these three nominees instead of try-
ing to move them en bloc. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes. 
Mr. KAINE. I would be very happy to 
amend my motion to that, if you would 
find that acceptable. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes. A vote, I would 
like, Senator, but there are other Re-
publican Members who have objections 
to all three nominees, and I am not au-
thorized to consent for them. 
Mr. KAINE. Then let me ask one 
final question. If we are able to clear 
the objections of others, would you 
agree—at a time that is convenient for 
the floor leaders of each party—to a re-
corded vote on the three nominees, if 
we were able to clear the objections 
with your other colleagues? 
Mr. HAWLEY. I would like to have a 
recorded vote. Are you asking me if I 
would vitiate cloture, Senator? 
Mr. KAINE. Yes, move to a final pas-
sage vote, on which you would be able 
to express your views on each of these 
nominees. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I would like to have a 
cloture vote and a recorded vote. I 
would like to observe regular order on 
each of these, unless we can make some 
progress on having a public hearing on 
this report. That is my position at this 
time. Again, I am not authorized to ne-
gotiate for anybody else. 
Mr. KAINE. I yield the floor. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the first part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD as follows: 
UNITED STATES CENTRAL COMMAND, 
OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY COMMANDER, 
15 September 2021. 
MEMORANDUM FOR COMMANDER, UNITED 
STATES ARMY CENTRAL 
From: Vice Admiral James J. Malloy, Dep-
uty Commander, United States Central 
Command. 
Subject: Memo Directing U.S. Army Central 
(USARCENT) to Conduct an Army Regu-
lation (AR) 15–6 Investigation into the 
Facts and Circumstances Surrounding 
the Attack at Abbey Gate, Hamid Karzai 
International Airport (HKIA) on 26 Au-
gust 2021. 
I 
am 
directing 
the 
Commander, 
USARCENT to appoint an AR 15–6 investiga-
tion into the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the attack upon U.S. forces located 
at the Abbey Gate at HKIA, Kabul, Afghani-
stan on 26 August 2021. This AR 15–6 inves-
tigation will be a holistic review of the facts 
and circumstances surrounding the attack. 
USARCENT is directed to conduct an in- 
depth examination of all relevant aspects 
which gave rise to the attack. The AR 15–6 
should closely examine tactical-level actions 
of U.S. personnel, gate operations, force pro-
tection and posture, readiness, leadership, 
and all other actions before, during and after 
the attack. 
BACKGROUND 
Recently the Commander, USCENTCOM 
directed his staff, Component Commands, 
and relevant supporting commands to con-
duct an after-action review (AAR) of the Af-
ghanistan non-combatant evacuation oper-
ation (NEO). This AR 15–6 is a separate re-
quirement from that AAR. 
DISCUSSION 
This AR 15–6 will be conducted in accord-
ance with Service regulations. USARCENT 
will provide the completed AR 15–6 to Head-
quarters, USCENTCOM no later than 1 Octo-
ber 2021. If additional time is required, this 
request must be approved by the Com-
mander. 
Finally, to thoroughly examine the facts 
and circumstances of this attack, Compo-
nent Commands, subordinate commands and 
other supporting commands are directed to 
assist USARCENT investigators during the 
course of this AR 15–6 as applicable. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY, 3RD EX-
PEDITIONARY
SUSTAINMENT
COM-
MAND, 
ACTS–SCK–DO, 22 October 2021. 
MEMORANDUM
FOR LTG RONALD P. CLARK, 
COMMANDER, THIRD ARMY/U.S. ARMY CEN-
TRAL, SHAW AIR FORCE BASE, SC 
Subject: Findings and Recommendations— 
Attack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021. 
1. BLUF. See EXSUM at enclosure 7. 
2. Background: On 26 August 2021, U.S. Ma-
rines were conducting a Non-combatant 
Evacuation Operation (NEO) at the Hamid 
Karzai International Airport (HKIA) as part 
of a larger joint force operation to conclude 
U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan. Elev-
en Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one 
Army 
PSYOP 
Noncommissioned 
Officer 
(NCO) were killed in an attack at the entry 
control point (ECP) known as Abbey Gate. 
As a result of the deaths of U.S. Service 
Members in combat, LTG Ronald P. Clark, 
Commander, Third Army/U.S. Army Central, 
at the direction of Gen McKenzie, Com-
mander, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), 
appointed me to investigate the surrounding 
facts and circumstances. 
a. Scope. In accordance with (IAW) AR 15– 
6, I was appointed to investigate the facts 
and circumstances and address the following 
matters: 
(1) Actions before, during, and after the at-
tack; 
(2) Force Protection, specifically including 
pertinent issues associated with: 
(a) Force Posture, and 
(b) Gate Operations. 
(3) Readiness; 
(4) Leadership; 
(5) Medical Considerations; 
(6) Chronology/Timeline of Events. 
b. Time Extensions. My initial appoint-
ment order, dated 17 September 2021, re-
quired me to complete my investigation no 
later than 1 October 2021 (enclosure 1). 
After careful analysis, I requested an ex-
tension to 22 October 2021 to ensure I could 
conduct sufficient interviews of widely dis-
persed forces and collect important products 
and documents to provide a complete inves-
tigation. You granted me the requested ex-
tension on 22 September 2021 (enclosure 2). 
c. Methodology. The investigation follows 
the procedures in AR 15–6 and the appoint-
ment memorandum, with one exception. 
After consulting with my legal advisor, I de-
termined the use of memorandums for record 
(MFRs) to capture interviews was a more ap-
propriate method, given the subject matter 
and personnel involved. I spoke with my 
legal advisor and also resolved conflicts in 
the evidence, and discussed the use of any 
self-serving statement that I relied upon. 
(1) The Commander, U.S. Marine Corps 
Forces 
Central 
Command 
(MARCENT), 
MajGen Paul Rock, assigned two Marine 
Corps Officers, (TEXT REDACTED) to per-
form duties as both subject matter experts 
and assistant investigating officers (enclo-
sures 3 and 4). 
(2) Additionally, I requested appointment 
of my Command Judge Advocate, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) investigating officers (enclosures 4 
and 5).

July 12, 2022 
3. Findings of facts. 
a. Task Organization. Before addressing 
the directed matters, it is of extreme impor-
tance to describe and clarify the task organi-
zation 
and 
command 
relationships 
(COMREL) between units executing oper-
ations at HKIA from 1–31 August 2021. The 
below descriptions are also enclosed in block 
and line charts (enclosure 8). 
(1) 1–16 August 202l. 
(a) RADM Pete Vasely, Commander, U.S. 
Forces–Afghanistan 
(Forward) 
(USFOR–A 
FWD), was the overall commander through-
out the execution of operations in Afghani-
stan during the month of August. USFOR–A 
FWD was chartered as a Diplomatic Assur-
ance Platform (DAP) and Joint Task Force 
(JTF) for operations in Afghanistan (exhibits 
7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 21). USFOR–A FWD was also 
Special Operations Joint Task Force–Af-
ghanistan (SOJTF–A). Elements of the 3/10 
Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) aug-
mented USFOR–A FWD staff and security 
forces at the Embassy (exhibits 126, 247). The 
Commander 
of 
3/10 
IBCT, 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) also served as Chief of Staff for 
USFOR–A FWD, and commander of two 
ground forces, Task Force (TF) Polar Bear 
and TF Wild Boar, which supported the Em-
bassy and HKIA (exhibits 21, 22, 126, 247). 
(b) JTF–Crisis Response (CR), commanded 
by BGen Farrell Sullivan, arrived at HKIA 
on 20 July 2021, to prepare for a potential 
NEO. Beginning in May 2021, USFOR–A FWD 
had tactical control (TACON) of JTF–CR for 
planning, and then for NEO execution in Au-
gust (exhibits 10, 11, 15, 18). 
(c) The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit 
(MEU), (TEXT REDACTED) sent its Com-
mand Element (CE) and Battalion Landing 
Team (BLT), 1/8 Marines to HKIA on 14 Au-
gust 2021 to set conditions for NEO (exhibits 
15, 100, 102, 104). JTF–CR had TACON of the 
24th MEU, which had TACON of 1/8 Marines 
(exhibits 100, 102, 104). 
(d) Elements of 1/82 IBCT arrived at HKIA 
throughout 15–16 August 2021. JTF–CR ini-
tially had TACON of the 1/82 elements, re-
ceived them at the flight line, and put them 
into defensive positions (exhibits 15, 100, 102, 
121, 125). 
(e) 2/1 Marines, the ground combat element 
(GCE) for the CENTCOM Special Purpose 
Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF), 
began arriving at HKIA in the early morning 
of 16 August 2021 (exhibits 53, 54, 55, 76, 77). 
The 24th MEU had TACON of 2/1 Marines (ex-
hibits 10, 11, 53, 54, 76, 77, 100, 102). 
(2) 17–28 August 2021. The Tactical Com-
mand Post (TAC) for the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, 
commanded 
by 
MG 
Christopher 
Donahue, arrived to HKIA in the early morn-
ing hours of 19 August 2021 (exhibits 13, 21, 
125). With the TAC’s arrival, Gen McKenzie 
altered 
the 
task 
organization, 
granted 
USFOR–A FWD TACON of the 82nd Airborne 
Division, and gave the 82nd TACON of JTF– 
CR (exhibits 10, 11, 238). JTF–CR retained 
TACON of Marine forces until departure, 
while 
82nd 
Airborne 
Division 
retained 
TACON of 1/82, and additional Army combat 
formations. However, USFOR–A FWD re-
tained TACON of JTF–CR for NEO. and JTF– 
CR coordinated with 82nd Airborne Division 
(exhibits 125, 40). Marine units also executed 
an alternate COMREL, as 2/1 Marines re-
ported directly to JTF–CR, despite the fact 
the 24th MEU had TACON of 2/1 (exhibits 18, 
53, 100). 1/82 IBCT assumed TACON of TF 
Polar Bear and TF Wild Boar (exhibits 10, 
126, 247). 
(3) 28–30 August 2021. 
(a) USFOR–A FWD departed HKIA in the 
early morning hours of 28 August 2021. MG 
Donahue, 
82nd 
Airborne 
Division 
Com-
mander, assumed command of all operations 
at HKIA until his departure at 0002 on 31 Au-
gust 2021 (exhibits 131 21, 125, 246). 
(b) JTF–CR and all Marine forces departed 
by the morning of 30 August 2021 (exhibits 15, 
18). No Marine forces subordinate to JT–FCR 
were task organized under the 82nd Airborne 
Division during the last two days of the 
NEO. 
(4) Adjacent Forces. 
(a) Taliban. On 16 August 2021, RADM 
Vasely began to coordinate with Taliban 
forces for additional crowd control and secu-
rity of HKIA (exhibits 13, 20, 21, 23). USFOR– 
A FWD’s primary point of contact for coordi-
nation was local Taliban Commander, (TEXT 
REDACTED) (exhibits 13, 20, 21, 23). U.S. 
commanders and leaders at all echelons co-
ordinated with Taliban forces to clarify secu-
rity tasks and responsibilities (exhibits 53, 
76). 
(b) 
Turkish 
Military 
Forces. 
Turkish 
Forces were present on HKIA prior to the 
NEO and responsible for security of northern 
HKIA and working through Afghan National 
Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to se-
cure the remaining perimeter (exhibits 15, 
18). JTF–CR, and later USFOR–A FWD, co-
ordinated with the Turkish Military Forces 
for security tasks and evacuation efforts (ex-
hibits 15, 18). 
(c) United Kingdom Forces. The U.K. had a 
large force presence, led by (TEXT RE-
DACTED) on HKIA and at the adjoining Bar-
ron Hotel (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 126). This 
force consisted of three companies from 2nd 
Battalion, Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) 
and two companies from 3 PARA, for a com-
bined force of approximately 550 troops, 
(TEXT REDACTED) (exhibit 126). Com-
manders and leaders at all levels worked 
with the U.K. Forces at Abbey Gate, coordi-
nating their security and evacuation efforts 
(exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 53, 56, 65, 76, 77). 
(d) Afghan National Strike Unit (NSU). 
This organization was affiliated with U.S. 
interagency activities and integrated into 
the security of HKIA on 16–17 August 2021 
(exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21). USFOR–A FWD 
worked through U.S. Embassy Kabul (USEK) 
personnel to coordinate with NSU (exhibits 
18, 21). 
b. Actions before, during, and after the at-
tack. 
(1) Key Findings. 
(a) By 25 August, Abbey Gate was the Main 
Effort for Gate Operations at HKIA. 
(b) At approximately 1736 local time, 26 
August 2021, a single explosion occurred at 
Abbey Gate. 
(c) There was no complex attack; it was a 
single suicide bomber not accompanied by 
enemy small arms fire. 
(d) How the bomber bypassed Taliban 
checkpoints to get to the canal is unknown. 
There were multiple avenues of approach to 
the canal continuously used by Afghans to 
bypass Taliban checkpoints. The bomber 
likely used one of these avenues. No Marines 
at Abbey Gate recall any civilian using U.S. 
identification to get closer to their position 
at the time of the attack. 
(e) The attack at Abbey Gate killed be-
tween 160–170 civilians. There is no evidence 
the Marines’ response to the attack caused 
further harm to civilians or fratricide. A po-
tential civilian casualty was reported during 
interviews with 2/1 Marines. A Platoon Com-
mander reported the casualty occurred dur-
ing initial gate operations on 20 August and 
the’ injury, or possible death, was caused by 
a flash-bang grenade. 
(2) USFOR–A FWD 
(a) USFOR–A FWD was task organized to 
fill the command and staff billets of SOJTF– 
A specifically NATO Special Operations 
Component Command-Afghanistan (NSOCC– 
A) (exhibits 20, 21). CENTCOM, after con-
sulting 
with 
outgoing 
USFOR–A 
Com-
mander, GEN Miller, established USFOR–A 
FWD as a DAP prior to its deployment to Af-
ghanistan (exhibits 20, 21). The DAP’s mis-
sion was to provide indications and warnings 
(I&W) for USEK, coordinate military activi-
ties in Afghanistan (security cooperation, 
targeting), and be prepared to command and 
control NEO (exhibits 20, 21). USFOR–A FWD 
developed a trigger matrix for preparation 
and execution of NEO, and shared it with 
USEK staff (exhibits 20, 21, 22). USFOR–A 
FWD used the trigger matrix as a tool to 
measure the Taliban’s advancement and con-
vince USEK staff to prepare for NEO (exhib-
its 20, 21, 22). However, USEK staff showed 
little interest in planning for NEO (exhibits 
15, 18, 20, 21, 22). Despite the Taliban’s rapid 
advance towards Kabul, on 12 August USEK 
only planned to evacuate 250 personnel by 31 
August (exhibit 21 ). On 14 August. the Am-
bassador committed to evacuating the Em-
bassy, but his personnel were unprepared and 
had taken few steps to reduce their footprint 
or destroy sensitive equipment/information 
(exhibits 20, 21, 22, 146). USEK security forces 
and the USFOR–A FWD (TEXT REDACTED) 
evacuated the final personnel from the Em-
bassy to HKIA at 0100 on 16 August. Most 
USEK personnel departed Afghanistan short-
ly thereafter (exhibits 15, 18, 20, 21, 22). 
(b) At HKIA, USFOR–A FWD was respon-
sible for up and out coordination. They com-
municated daily with various elements of 
the interagency, to include Department of 
State (DoS) and the White House. They also 
coordinated with partner nations seeking 
support with evacuation, and coordinated 
with the Turkish Military, the Taliban, and 
the NSU to establish and maintain security 
of the airfield (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22).

TRIBUTE TO KIM HOLDEN 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today for two reasons: one happy, one 
not so happy. 
First, I want to take a moment to 
recognize a much admired Louisiana 
journalist. I am referring to Ms. Kim 
Holden from the wonderful city of New 
Orleans in my State. Kim has just re-
tired from WVUE, which we sometimes 
call FOX 8 News, in Louisiana, and Ms. 
Holden has been with FOX 8 News for 
34 years. 
Kim, if I may call her by her first 
name, 
is 
Louisiana 
through 
and 
through. She is what most of us would 
call a star-spangled professional. Ms. 
Holden graduated from St. Mary’s Do-
minican High School. I know, to some 
of you, that doesn’t mean much, but it 
is an extraordinarily good school in my 
State. 
She started out at Tulane University. 
She wanted to study premed, but she 
realized pretty quickly that premed 
wasn’t for her. She discovered her love 
for journalism, and she went to and 
graduated from Loyola University in 
New Orleans with a major in commu-
nications. 
She took her first job in 1988 as an in-
tern at WVUE FOX 8, and she never 
left. Kim’s talent and intelligence was 
quickly recognized at FOX 8. She was 
hired almost immediately after being 
an intern as a part-time production as-
sistant. 
Throughout her 34 years at FOX 8, 
she has worked as a producer, as a re-
porter, as a weekend anchor, and as an 
assistant news director. In 2005, Ms. 
Holden started anchoring the morning

newscast, and she has coanchored at 5 
and 10 p.m. for the last 12 years. 
It is a very unique thing, as you 
know, Mr. President, in television to 
work your entire career in one place, 
particularly in your hometown. Most 
journalists move from city to city—not 
Kim. She loves New Orleans, and New 
Orleans loves her back. 
I have been interviewed any number 
of times, with great admiration from 
Ms. Holden—not always with great joy 
because Kim is tough. She is tough as 
a boot as a journalist. She does her job, 
but she is very, very fair. She is in a 
world now of agenda journalists who 
have an agenda of their own—not Kim 
Holden. Not Kim Holden. She called 
the balls and the strikes. I don’t even 
know what party she is in. I don’t care 
which party she is in. She was just a 
pro. 
Kim, as I said, has retired, and she 
has had an extraordinary career. When 
you go back and look at her awards, 
she has received an Emmy and two Ed-
ward R. Murrow Awards for reporting. 
The Associated Press named her Re-
porter of the Year twice. 
Throughout her career at FOX 8 
News, Kim has covered everything 
from the COVID–19 pandemic to hurri-
canes, including Hurricane Katrina, to 
the New Orleans Saints winning the 
Super Bowl. 
I think, in her next chapter, Ms. Hol-
den is going to spend some quality 
time—she deserves it—with her hus-
band Bobby and her four children and 
her six grandchildren. 
So I just wanted to recognize Kim 
Holden today and to thank her for giv-
ing so much to the profession of jour-
nalism and to thank her for giving so 
much to my State in Louisiana. And I 
wish her the best in her next chapter. 
ENERGY 
Mr. President, now on the less pleas-
ant subject which I wish I didn’t have 
to talk about—deeply, profoundly stu-
pid; deeply, profoundly stupid—that is 
the only way that I know how to de-
scribe one of the worst decisions by an 
administration that has become fa-
mous for bad decisions. I am talking 
about President Biden’s assault on sus-
tainable, affordable energy. 
The people of Louisiana know, and 
the people of America know that they 
are now paying $90 to fill up their cars 
and tanks with gas because the Biden 
administration killed the Keystone 
Pipeline, canceled our offshore oil 
leases, and forfeited America’s energy 
independence. We were energy inde-
pendent. The Biden administration for-
feited it. 
What seems to be underappreciated, 
however, is how President Biden’s 
agenda is driving up the price not just 
of oil but of all kinds of necessities 
that American and Louisiana families 
need every day. It is not just about oil 
and gas. It is about everything. 
Not only do most goods get to our 
homes after riding in trucks and planes 
and cars and ships powered by gas or 
diesel, but a lot of our plastics and 
other products, if you think about it, 
they are also made from petroleum. 
Actually, only 60 percent of oil in the 
world gets used as a fuel. Forty percent 
of the global oil supply ends up in 
other things, things other than cars 
and trucks—in products. 
That means that it doesn’t just cost 
people more to get to and from the 
store. It means almost everything in 
the store costs more because of its con-
nection to oil. Some medicines come 
from oil. Microfiber comes from oil. 
Mascara comes from oil. Synthetic 
leather comes from oil. 
Do you have a phone case or a hand-
bag or a chair or a car made with plas-
tic? That is oil. That is oil. 
Now, not everything is made from 
oil. Some goods that you buy are not 
made from that natural resource. But I 
bet they are packaged in plastic. And 
all of these items, all of these house-
hold necessities are casualties of Presi-
dent Biden’s assault on sustainable en-
ergy. 
Here is a fat fact: Our economy can’t 
run without fossil fuels. Now, I am not 
suggesting that fossil fuels should be 
our only source of energy. Certainly, 
we should take advantage of the effi-
ciencies we can find in wind. I believe 
in wind and solar. I believe in solar— 
and nuclear and hydrogen and hydro-
electric. But part of a sensible, sustain-
able, affordable energy plan has to in-
clude fossil fuels. 
Ours is the greatest economy in all of 
human history. It can’t run without 
energy, and 80 percent of our energy 
today comes from fossil fuels. That is 
just a fat fact. 
The truth is that American inge-
nuity—and I am referring to fossil 
fuels—has made the most out of one of 
the most versatile resources that the 
world has ever known, but the Biden 
White House is determined to punish us 
for that innovation—just determined 
to punish us—by making every single 
part of the American dream more ex-
pensive. Even necessities that aren’t 
directly made from petroleum depend 
on affordable fuel to reach American 
families. 
Record high inflation and gas prices 
have sent Americans to food pantries. 
Why? Because even fruits and eggs and 
milk are becoming unaffordable. The 
latest reports show that many Ameri-
cans are paying 8.6-percent higher 
prices today than they were last year. 
But we know it is more than that. I 
know those are the official government 
numbers, but we know it is more than 
that. Eggs are up 32 percent. Milk is up 
16 percent. Flour is up 14 percent. Baby 
food—when you can find it—is up 13 
percent. These aren’t luxury items. 
These are staples that Americans de-
pend on every single day. 
I mean, why is a Louisiana man tell-
ing us ‘‘[m]y food budget is insane’’? 
My food budget is insane. ‘‘[I]t’s gone 
up $100–150 a week. So, it’s becoming 
more and more difficult, to buy the 
same thing I bought a year or two 
years ago.’’ 
That is not just a Louisianian talk-
ing. That is all across America. 
Why did a woman in Baton Rouge re-
alize that fruits and vegetables—not 
sirloin steak, fruits, and vegetables— 
are breaking her bank? She is cooking 
more with rice and bread instead of 
fruits and vegetables. The high grocery 
prices for this lady are gutting her and 
her family like a fish. And that is just 
a fact—a very unhappy one, but it is a 
fact. 
Now, 
high 
oil 
prices 
are 
also 
waterboarding our farmers, which con-
tributes to these high food prices. Did 
you know that we make industrial fer-
tilizer from fossil fuels? And when nat-
ural gas costs more, so does fertilizing 
a field of wheat or corn or soybeans. 
Some of our herbicides right now are 
twice as expensive as they were, if 
farmers can find them. 
Tractors drink diesel. Duh. So do ir-
rigation systems. A gallon of diesel—1 
gallon—a year ago, you know what it 
was? It was $3.23. You know what it is 
today? It is $5.20. 
Now, what does this mean for Lou-
isiana rice farmers and other growers? 
For every extra dime farmers spend on 
a gallon of diesel—every extra dime—a 
grower will spend about $4.50 more for 
an acre of rice, $2.30 more for an acre of 
cotton, and an extra $1.74 for an acre of 
corn. 
Corn 
growers—I 
mentioned 
corn 
growers—they also depend on nitrogen 
fertilizer, which we make with meth-
ane. 
And 
then 
corn—I 
mentioned 
corn—corn goes into cereal. It goes 
into sweetened drinks, peanut butter, 
baby food, ketchup, salad dressing. 
You know, I don’t mean to be ugly, 
but this administration’s energy policy 
is deeply, profoundly stupid. And it is 
dangerous. 
So my people are feeling President 
Biden’s gas hike from the gas pump to 
the grocery store, to the doctor’s of-
fice. 
A lot of the raw materials that make 
our medicines and healthcare products 
are made from—guess what—petro-
leum. 
Oil goes into our burn creams. Do 
you ever burn yourself, have to go to 
the local grocery store or the local 
pharmacy, buy something to put on 
your burn? That cream comes from oil. 
You have allergies? Those allergy 
pills are made, in part, with oil. 
Do you ever get a cold, take a little 
NyQuil, take some cold tablets? You 
need oil to make them. Our kids’ 
gummy vitamins are made with oil. 
The bandaids in your medicine cabinet, 
they are made from oil. 
The President’s assault on fossil fuels 
is hitting my people in Louisiana, and 
they are hitting the American people 
so hard they are coughing up bones. My 
people and the people of America are 
increasingly having to dip into their 
savings accounts just to afford every-
day items, not to take a cruise, not to 
buy a new car, not to buy some new 
clothes to look good at church on Sun-
day—for household necessities.

And on top of that, in addition to 
going into their savings account, my 
people and the people all across Amer-
ica are having to charge more and 
more and more to their credit cards, 
not for luxuries but for staples, for ne-
cessities. 
All of this inflation caused, in part, 
by the President’s bone-deep, down-to- 
the-marrow stupid energy policy is 
costing the average American and Lou-
isiana family $635 a month. 
Now, think about that—$635 a month. 
Let’s call it $7 to $8,000 a year. If you 
are a mom making $40,000 a year and 
you are a dad making $40,000 a year and 
you have got two children and you 
have a home—nothing special, you 
know, $200,000 home; it has a mort-
gage—mom and dad have to go to 
work. So they have to have auto-
mobiles. They have car payments. 
They are using every penny of that 
$80,000 a year. And now, all of a sudden, 
here comes inflation, and they have got 
to come out of pocket with an extra $7 
to $8,000 a year. Where is the money 
going to come from? And just about 
every middle-class American is experi-
encing that right now. 
Now, recently, the President sent a 
letter. He sent a letter to the top oil 
companies. In the letter—it was kind of 
a snippy letter, frankly—he demanded 
that the oil companies ramp up their 
refining operations to try to slow the 
rising energy prices and to shore up 
supply. Isn’t that special? The same 
President—he ran on it. He did it. He 
ran on it. He said he would do it, and 
he has done it. The same President who 
promised to end fossil fuels is now 
blaming the energy industry for histor-
ical oil and gas prices. 
The truth is, this administration re-
fuses to accept responsibility for bad 
policies. And I don’t know why they 
pursued this policy, other than just to 
try to check off a promise made to sat-
isfy the woke agenda. 
For the sake of Americans’ economic 
futures and for the sake of our national 
security, we cannot continue to rely on 
foreign oil imports—we can’t—while 
pretending to run this country using 
wind, solar, and wishful thinking be-
cause that is what the President’s new 
policy is on energy. It is wind. It is 
solar. It is wishful thinking. Wishful 
thinking doesn’t fill gas tanks or gro-
cery carts. 
And the President this week will be 
in Saudi Arabia. He is not there as a 
tourist. He is in Saudi Arabia to beg 
the Saudis to produce more oil, after 
he has already forfeited America’s en-
ergy independence, and he refuses to 
take his boot off the throat of the oil 
and gas industry to allow our oil and 
gas producers to produce our own oil. 
So think about it. This is the Presi-
dent’s new energy policy. Let’s don’t 
produce our own oil and gas. Let’s give 
up our energy independence. But we 
have to have oil and gas. So what do we 
do? The President’s new policy is, let’s 
give up our own oil and gas and let’s 
buy oil from foreign countries that 
hate us so those foreign countries will 
have more money to buy weapons to 
try to kill us. It just makes no sense. 
And the people of Louisiana deserve 
better. And the people of America de-
serve better. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

RECOGNIZING OLE MISS REBELS AND THE PEARL 
RIVER COMMUNITY WILDCATS 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, for the 
second year in a row, the State of Mis-
sissippi is the center of the universe for 
college baseball. Senator HYDE-SMITH 
and I are proud and delighted this 
afternoon to congratulate not one but 
two 
Mississippi 
collegiate 
baseball 
teams on becoming national champions 
for their respective divisions this year. 
Those teams are the Ole Miss Rebels 
and the Pearl River Community Wild-
cats. 
It was just last year that the Mis-
sissippi State Bulldogs won their first- 
ever College World Series national 
championship. And with the new year, 
came even more successful baseball in 
Mississippi. 
Last month, after sweating out selec-
tion day, Ole Miss went to the NCAA 
Division I Baseball Tournament and 
won 10 out of 11 games, sweeping Okla-
homa in the final round of the College 
World Series to become national cham-
pions. 
Just weeks earlier, Pearl River Com-
munity College, located in Poplarville, 
MS, defeated Madison College of Wis-
consin in the Division II Junior College 
World Series. After spending the entire 
season ranked in the top five, Pearl 
River won five out of six games in the 
playoffs, defeating Florida State Col-
lege at Jacksonville, Lansing Commu-
nity College, and, finally, Madison Col-
lege in a three-game series finale. 
The Wildcats dropped game one to 
Madison, but then roared back with a 
19-to-1 victory in game 2 and a decisive 
7-to-2 victory in game 3. They finished 
their season with a sparkling record of 
45 wins and 11 losses. 
Just think about this for a moment. 
Three college baseball national titles 
in 2 years for the State of Mississippi. 
Congratulations also go to the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi, which 
had an excellent season and even 
hosted their first super regional in Hat-
tiesburg, ending with a record of 47 
wins and 19 losses. 
This year’s Ole Miss championship 
run is a comeback story for the ages. 
After spending the early parts of the 
season ranked No. 1 in the Nation, the 
Rebels went into a deep slump in April, 
losing 4 straight series and 11 out of 16 
games. In May, they were among the 
last 4 teams to be included in the field 
of 64. But they had finished the regular 
season hot, and some people believed 
they just might carry that momentum 
into 
the 
playoffs. 
And 
they 
did, 
outscoring their opponents 46 runs to 
11 down the stretch. 
Led by Coach Mike Bianco and Team 
Captain Tim Elko, Ole Miss beat one 
team after another—first Arizona and 
Miami in the regional, then Southern 
Miss in the Hattiesburg Super Re-
gional, then Auburn and Arkansas in 
the College World Series, which led to 
a final best two out of three face-off 
with Oklahoma. 
Game one was a slugfest. The Rebels 
put up 16 hits, including back-to-back- 
to-back home runs in the eighth inning 
by T.J. McCants, Calvin Harris, and 
Justin Bench—a stunning feat not seen 
at the College World Series since 1998. 
On the mound, the Ole Miss pitchers 
kept things quiet. Jack Dougherty, 
Mason Nichols, and Josh Mallitz gave 
up just three runs, securing a 10-to-3 
victory. 
The decisive game two was a lot clos-
er. For the first five innings, it was a 
pitchers’ duel between Ole Miss’s Hun-
ter Elliot of Tupelo, MS, and Cade Hor-
ton of Norman, OK. The bats finally 
got going for Ole Miss in the sixth 
when Jacob Gonzalez hit a solo home 
run. The Sooners quickly answered by 
knocking in two runs, making it 2 to 1, 
Oklahoma. In the eighth inning, Ole 
Miss tied things up with hits by T.J. 
McCants, Justin Bench, and Jacob 
Gonzalez, and scored two additional 
runs on wild pitches, making it 4 to 2. 
In the top of the ninth, Brandon 
Johnson took the mound for Ole Miss 
and closed out the night with three 
strikeouts, capping off a magical run 
for the men from Oxford. 
‘‘From last team in, to last team 
standing,’’ exclaimed the announcer. 
And then to Oxford they returned, 
bringing with them the 30th NCAA 
championship in Ole Miss history. 
The day after winning the title, these 
national champions were welcomed 
back to campus by crowds of jubilant 
supporters as they walked the hallowed 
pathway known as the Walk of Cham-
pions. 
On behalf of the entire State of Mis-
sissippi, I commend the Ole Miss team 
and their staff on this historic achieve-
ment. Justin Bench, Calvin Harris, 
Kevin Graham, Kemp Alderman, and 
Dylan DeLucia all were named to the 
NCAA’s All-Tournament Team. 
Dylan DeLucia received the Jack 
Diesing, Sr. Most Outstanding Player 
of the Series award for pitching a com-
plete game shutout against the Arkan-
sas Razorbacks, becoming the first re-
cipient of the award in Ole Miss his-
tory. And Captain Tim Elko became 
only the sixth player in history to earn 
four hits in a Men’s College World Se-
ries final—not to mention his 46 career 
home runs, the second most in school 
history. 
I also congratulate Mike Bianco, who 
has coached Ole Miss for 22 seasons and 
led the team to 18 playoff appearances,

including two trips to the College 
World Series in Omaha. He has rightly 
been named National Coach of the Year 
by the American Baseball Coaches As-
sociation and the Collegiate Baseball 
Newspaper. He never gave up on his 
team, and he inspired his players to 
persevere through the tough times. 
I wish Coach Bianco the best of luck 
this week as he now leads Team USA 
at an international tournament in the 
Netherlands, where he is joined by two 
Ole Miss players, Hunter Elliott and 
Jacob Gonzalez. 
I also congratulate Michael Avalon, 
Head Coach for the Pearl River Wild-
cats, who, after leading his team to a 
national title, was named National 
Coach of the Year for Division II junior 
colleges. 
I commend the University of Mis-
sissippi, Pearl River Community Col-
lege, the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi, and Mississippi State Univer-
sity for carrying on Mississippi’s win-
ning tradition. 
Two years ago, after a season cut 
short by the COVID pandemic, Ole Miss 
catcher Hayden Dunhurst boldly said: 
I have never been a part of a team so spe-
cial . . . We will bring a National Champion-
ship to Oxford. 
And so they did. Congratulations and 
Hotty Toddy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
also am very pleased to congratulate 
the University of Mississippi baseball 
team on its recent 2022 NCAA World 
Series championship. 
If there is anything an Ole Miss fan is 
sure of it is that the Rebels love to 
keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Some fans were nervous when the 
Rebels hit a midseason slump, but, boy, 
this talented team hit its stride right 
at the perfect time. 
The players knew all along they had 
it in them to take it all the way. They 
even issued a warning in early May: 
Don’t let the Rebels get hot. Well, the 
Rebels did get hot, and they were able 
to be there to be the team that no one 
saw coming and the team that no one 
could stop. 
Their impressive and exciting run 
through this year’s College World Se-
ries speaks volumes to the Ole Miss 
baseball program, its leadership, its 
players, and, of course, its fan base. 
Mississippi’s energy has been electric 
following the win, especially at Ole 
Miss’s 
first-ever 
national 
baseball 
championship this year occurred after 
Pearl 
River 
Community 
College 
clinched the NJCAA Division II base-
ball championship in June and after 
Mississippi State University’s win just 
last year. 
Mississippi’s sports culture is strong 
and it is not to be underestimated. We 
take great pride in the legacy and in-
spiring example of these young ath-
letes and their coaches. 
To the entire Rebel baseball family, 
thank you for your hard work and dedi-
cation to the sport. To Ole Miss and to 
our great State, congratulations and 
Hotty Toddy.

U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
month the Supreme Court completed 
one of its most consequential and, in 
many ways, disastrous terms in Amer-
ican history, issuing a flurry of deci-
sions that have upended our constitu-
tional landscape. 
In the scope of just a few weeks, the 
Supreme Court’s radical new super-
majority trampled over decades of 
longstanding precedent and usurped 
the power that has been traditionally 
left to Congress, State legislatures, and 
even individual Americans. 
In fact, for the first time in the his-
tory of the United States of America, 
the Supreme Court revoked a constitu-
tional right: the right to reproductive 
healthcare. 
What we have seen from this Su-
preme Court is not guided by any co-
herent philosophy. It is judicial activ-
ism, plain and simple. The Court’s rad-
ical majority is cherry-picking its way 
across text and history to impose their 
own ideological agenda on the Amer-
ican people, and, in so doing, the ma-
jority is not only damaging the Court’s 
constitutional integrity. They are un-
dermining the health and safety of the 
American people. 
Let me explain, starting with one 
ruling that will severely limit the Gov-
ernment’s ability to address what 
could be the greatest challenge of our 
time—the climate crisis. The case was 
West Virginia v. the EPA. The conserv-
ative majority on the Court mis-
construed the law passed by Congress 
to side with the fossil fuel industry 
over the health of the American people. 
When Congress enacted the Clean Air 
Act more than a half century ago, it 
charged the Environmental Protection 
Agency with protecting our air from 
harmful pollution, including green-
house gases, which are causing cata-
strophic and irreversible damage to our 
planet. As Justice Kagan emphasized in 
her dissent, if the current rate of emis-
sions continues, children born this year 
could live to see parts of the eastern 
seaboard of the United States swal-
lowed by the ocean. Rising waters, 
scorching 
heat, 
and 
other 
severe 
weather events can force mass migra-
tion, civil unrest, and, in some parts of 
the world, even failure of state govern-
ment. And, of course, Black, Brown, in-
digenous, and other communities bear 
the largest burden of environmental 
disaster. 
With the Clean Air Act, Congress 
rightfully recognized that scientists— 
not politicians or judges—should be the 
authority on deciding the best methods 
to reduce emissions from powerplants. 
It was under that authority that in 2014 
the EPA proposed the Clean Power 
Plan. That plan would have markedly 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but 
it never went into effect. 
That is important because article III 
of the Constitution requires that there 
be an actual case in controversy in 
order for the Supreme Court to issue a 
ruling. Because the Clean Power Plan 
never went into effect, there was no 
case or controversy to refer to, but the 
Supreme Court still went out of its 
way to reject the plan and toss it aside 
in West Virginia v. EPA. Worse yet, 
the Court claimed it had the authority 
to do so by relying on something the 
conservative majority calls ‘‘the major 
questions doctrine.’’ 
Listen to what Justice Kagan said 
about this in her dissent: 
The current Court is textualist only when 
being so suits it. When that method would 
frustrate broader goals, special canons like 
the ‘‘major questions doctrine’’ magically 
appear as get-out-of-text-free cards. 
The 
‘‘major 
questions 
doctrine’’ 
might sound like a legal word salad, 
but it will have serious consequences 
on America. In short, the radical ma-
jority on the Court declared it has the 
authority to veto any Federal regula-
tion it doesn’t care for; that is, unless 
Congress spells out every single detail 
decades in advance. 
Here is the deal. As good as we are in 
the Senate and the House, lawmakers 
are not clairvoyant. We write laws like 
the Clean Air Act to address evolving 
unforeseen challenges like the climate 
crisis, and we grant Agencies the power 
to create regulations to address these 
challenges based on their singular ex-
pertise. 
In West Virginia v. EPA, the Su-
preme Court’s radical majority decided 
that their own ideological goals on the 
Court were more important than the 
expertise of the world’s top scientists. 
And with this ruling, the Court has 
made it clear that they are coming 
after public Agencies responsible for 
protecting our public health. They

want to weaken the government’s abil-
ity to work upon behalf of the Amer-
ican people. 
Just days before issuing a decision on 
West Virginia v. EPA, the Court issued 
another ideologically driven ruling in 
New York State Rifle & Pistol Associa-
tion v. Bruen. With this decision, the 
Court struck down a New York gun 
safety law that had been on the books 
for more than a century. That law 
placed limits on who is allowed to 
carry a concealed handgun in public. 
As a result of the law being struck 
down, it is all but certain that we will 
see more guns on the streets of Amer-
ica at a time when gun violence has be-
come so bad that the leading cause of 
death 
among 
children 
in 
America 
would be guns. 
The Supreme Court’s decision to wipe 
away a century-old gun safety law was 
troubling enough, but even worse is the 
new test it laid out for considering con-
stitutional challenges to other gun 
laws. Justice Clarence Thomas’ major-
ity opinion rejected the legal test that 
lower courts had applied after the leg-
endary Heller case, which sensibly 
combined 
historic 
analysis 
with 
present-day 
public 
safety 
consider-
ations. Instead, under Clarence Thom-
as’s reasoning, the majority claims 
that the only test for whether a gun 
law is constitutional is historical anal-
ysis; that is, whether the current law 
has a historical analogue. 
There is a problem with that in two 
respects. First, it invites judicial cher-
ry-picking of historical sources, which 
is exactly what the Clarence Thomas 
majority did in striking down the New 
York law. Second, it ignores modern 
public safety threats posed by firearms 
which are nothing like the guns that 
the Framers of the Constitution had in 
their day. 
Think about it. The gun that was 
fired in the Highland Park Fourth of 
July parade crowd discharged 90 rounds 
in just a matter of seconds. No musket 
in the time of the Founding Fathers 
was ever used to fire 90 rounds per 
minute into a crowd watching a Fourth 
of July parade. There is just no ana-
logue. The Bruen decision was not a 
triumph of originalism. It was a classic 
example of runaway judicial activism 
in furtherance of the far-right ideolog-
ical agenda, and we have to live in the 
America that it leaves. 
That is not the only ruling in the 
past term that made America less safe. 
Earlier today, my Judiciary Com-
mittee heard a hearing on the Court’s 
decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization which revoked the 
constitutional right to reproductive 
healthcare for every woman in Amer-
ica. 
This decision is one of the most irre-
sponsible rulings in American history. 
By overturning Roe v. Wade, the ma-
jority not only violated five decades of 
longstanding precedent; they created a 
healthcare crisis across the country. 
Do you realize that every one of 
these Supreme Court nominees came 
before this Judiciary Committee and 
made it clear that they would respect 
this precedent? And now look at what 
has happened. Whatever your thoughts 
on Roe may be, the fact is that it put 
a profound and personal decision ex-
actly where it should be—in the hands 
of an individual. Now that the right 
has been ripped from the American 
people and handed over to the Govern-
ment, your constitutional freedoms de-
pend on what State you live in. Your 
ZIP Code will decide your constitu-
tional right. 
You know, for decades, anti-choice 
activists claimed that overturning Roe 
would finally settle the controversy 
surrounding abortion. Instead, this Su-
preme Court has invited chaos. Preg-
nant women in America are scrambling 
at this very moment trying to figure 
out if they can make it to the nearest 
clinic to receive lifesaving care as they 
experience complications during preg-
nancy. And once again, like the Bruen 
decision on firearms, the Dobbs deci-
sion on abortion is littered with inac-
curate historical analysis. 
Justice Alito claims that abortion is 
not constitutionally protected because 
it is not ‘‘deeply rooted in the Nation’s 
history and tradition.’’ 
I am not sure what history his law 
clerks have been reading. As the dis-
senters in the Dobbs case said: 
[E]mbarrassingly for the majority—early 
law in fact does provide some support for 
abortion rights. Common-law authorities did 
not treat abortion as a crime before ‘‘quick-
ening’’—the point when the fetus moved in 
the womb. And early American law followed 
the common-law rule. So the criminal law of 
that time might be taken as roughly con-
sonant with Roe’s and Casey’s different 
treatment of early and late abortions. 
Just look at one of our Founding Fa-
thers, Benjamin Franklin, who actu-
ally published a textbook that included 
an at-home abortion recipe. 
So the Dobbs decision is not based on 
any originalist interpretation of the 
Constitution or any precedent. It is an 
ideologically motivated outcome in 
search of a legal rationale. 
This assault on our fundamental free-
doms won’t end there. The Supreme 
Court has already signaled they are 
just getting started. During today’s 
hearing on the overturning of Roe v. 
Wade, we discussed Justice Clarence 
Thomas’ concurring opinion in Dobbs, 
in which he argues that the constitu-
tional right to privacy is a fiction. 
In that opinion, he declares that the 
Court should ‘‘eliminate’’ the line of 
cases guaranteeing the constitutional 
rights to birth control, marriage equal-
ity, and consensual relations between 
LGBTQ people. There is good reason to 
take this threat seriously. 
Based on the cases the Court has 
agreed to hear in its next term, which 
begins in October, it is clear that the 
majority is once again seeking oppor-
tunities to impose its far-right agenda 
on the American people. 
The Court is considering one case 
that could allow individuals and busi-
nesses to openly discriminate against 
LGBTQ people. Another case will re-
visit the question of affirmative action 
in higher education, and, most con-
cerning, this Court will consider a case 
that could threaten American democ-
racy as we know it. They will decide 
whether a State legislature can dis-
regard the will of the voters in their 
State to appoint a slate of electors who 
support the losing Presidential can-
didate. The Presiding Officer knows 
this issue well from the State of Michi-
gan’s experience just a few months ago. 
There is a reason why a record num-
ber of Americans say they have lost 
faith in the Supreme Court based on 
what happened in this term that just 
concluded. And now they are living in 
fear that their most cherished rights— 
basic human rights in America—are on 
the conservative chopping block. 
The tragic irony is that it was Chief 
Justice Roberts who once said that 
‘‘justices . . . are like umpires. . . . 
They make sure everybody plays by 
the rules, but it is a limited role.’’ 
I remember that quote, as I was sit-
ting in the Judiciary Committee when 
he made it, and I thought the limita-
tion that he suggested for the Supreme 
Court was an indication of his modera-
tion. 
The Court that he has joined, in 
many of these opinions, is not a Court 
of limited or moderate means. I wish I 
could say that that, in fact, were true 
today. It is not. This radical majority 
is not comprised of umpires calling 
balls and strikes. They are, in fact, ju-
dicial activists—unelected judges—who 
are actively undermining the rule of 
law in America, and there is more to 
come. 
I yield the floor.

∑ Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the 
Senate voted on the nomination of 
Steve Dettelbach to be the Director of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms, and Explosives—ATF. I commend 
President Biden for nominating Steve, 
who I know will excel as ATF Director 
at a time when enforcement of our 
country’s gun laws is so critical. 
As gun violence continues to plague 
our country and as mass shootings be-
come more and more common, it is

July 12, 2022 
hard not to feel paralyzed by the end-
less tragedy. But we must take action. 
I am proud to reflect on this body’s ef-
forts to pass the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act, which was signed into 
law by President Biden last month. 
But we must do more, and we must 
continue to do all that we can to pre-
vent these senseless tragedies from oc-
curring in the first place. That is why 
this confirmation vote today was so 
crucial. The ATF is charged with en-
forcing our Nation’s gun laws, but the 
Agency has been without a Senate-con-
firmed Director since 2015. How can 
that be? In a time when firearms have 
become the leading cause of death 
among children in our country, how 
can we expect the ATF to fully func-
tion without a permanent Director? Fi-
nally, thankfully, that changes today. 
I know Steve personally, and I can 
attest not only to his strong work 
ethic, but to his extraordinary set of 
skills and professional experiences that 
will no doubt serve him well as ATF 
Director. Steve served on my Judiciary 
Committee staff as a detailee from the 
Department of Justice, a role requiring 
time-sensitive evaluations of a wide 
range of issues relating to criminal jus-
tice and law enforcement. I am grateful 
for his wise counsel during his 2 years 
on my staff, and I have taken a great 
deal of personal pride in observing all 
of his achievements and leadership 
roles he has held since that time. 
Steve has spent more than two dec-
ades as a prosecutor within the Justice 
Department, and was confirmed unani-
mously by the Senate to serve as U.S. 
attorney for the Northern District of 
Ohio, a position he held from 2009 to 
2016. Over the course of his 30-year ca-
reer, Steve has demonstrated that he is 
a dedicated, principled, law enforce-
ment official who is highly qualified to 
take on this position. With the passage 
of the Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, the Congress proved that it is not 
so paralyzed that it cannot take rea-
sonable—rational—steps 
to 
confront 
the scourge of gun violence. The Sen-
ate can further prove that today by 
confirming Steve Dettelbach to lead 
the ATF. There could be no one more 
qualified for this position. 
I regret that personal matters kept 
me from casting my vote in favor of 
Steve’s confirmation today, but my en-
thusiastic support for his confirmation 
remains steadfast. I look forward to 
continuing that support by doing all 
that I can to ensure that Steve and the 
ATF have the resources they need to 
enforce our Nation’s gun laws and pro-
tect our communities. 
It is no easy task, but I know Steve 
is ready. And I stand ready to support 
him, and I urge all other Senators to 
do the same today.∑

Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, had

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO PETE GAGNE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Pete Gagne of 
Conway as June’s Granite Stater of the 
Month. Pete is the owner of the Saco 
River Tubing Center, and this summer, 
he is spearheading the second Paddle 
for a Cause campaign to raise money 
for and lift up local Mount Washington 
Valley organizations. 
Every Wednesday during the 11-week 
campaign, a portion of every tube, 
kayak, and rental sale from that day is 
donated to that week’s chosen non-
profit. This year’s organizations work 
on issues such as nature conservation, 
food insecurity, affordable housing, and 
service dogs for people with disabil-
ities. Visitors can also pay extra to 
bring their dogs with them on river ex-
peditions, with all proceeds going to 
the Conway Area Humane Society. 
Last year, Saco River Tubing donated 
over $3,500. 
The Paddle for a Cause program pro-
vides much-needed funds to local orga-
nizations that are a vital part of the 
Mount Washington Valley community 
and helps Granite Staters and tourists 
alike learn more about all that the vi-
brant Mount Washington Valley com-
munity has to offer. 
In addition to fundraising and raising 
awareness about local organizations, 
the campaign has an educational com-
ponent on nature conservation. This is 
especially important in New Hamp-
shire, since the Granite State is home 
to many beautiful natural treasures. 
During every trip on the river, Saco 
River 
Tubing 
employees 
speak 
to 
guests about respecting wildlife and 
minimizing any negative impact to the 
ecosystems while on the water. This is 
particularly important given the influx 
in visitors that started when Granite 
Staters and tourists alike were looking 
for more outdoor activities due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Pete’s Paddle for a Cause not only 
gives back to the community through 
fundraising, but also educates people 
on taking care of our natural re-
sources. Pete exemplifies the Granite 
State spirit of dedication to commu-
nity, and I commend him for bringing 
people together to support critical 
causes. I know that his initiative will 
have lasting, positive effects for the 
Mount Washington Valley and the en-
tire State.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER NOAH COLE 
AND OFFICER NICK GREENE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Louis-
ville Metro Police Department fields 
some of the finest officers this Nation 
has to offer. Nothing could be more 
true of Officers Noah Cole and Nick 
Greene. On the evening of Monday, 
June 27, 2022, Officers Cole and Greene 
were starting their evening shift like 
any other night. 
They stopped at Shorty’s Food Mart 
on 18th Street and Broadway in the 
Russell neighborhood of West Louis-
ville when they were alerted by an 
alarmed father. The gentleman told the 
officers that his daughter needed their 
help. The officers overcame a language 
barrier with the father and responded 
immediately to his plea. 
They exited Shorty’s and ran to the 
infant, who was in her mother’s arms. 
Officer Greene quickly assessed the sit-
uation and determined that the infant 
was unconscious from choking. He ad-
ministered back blows to the infant 
until the blockage was cleared. Simul-
taneously, Officer Cole contacted fire 
and EMS support to aid in the care of 
the infant. EMS personnel arrived on 
the scene and were able to further care 
for the infant and calm the parents. 
The actions of these two officers di-
rectly saved the life of our most vul-
nerable citizen and stopped the worst- 
case scenario for any parent: burying 
their child. Officer Cole and Greene are 
servant leaders, an asset to the resi-
dents of Louisville, and a testament to 
the Louisville Metro Police Depart-
ment. I am proud to salute officers 
Noah Cole, Nick Greene, and the entire 
Louisville Metro Police Department on 
a job well done.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN KODY 
JONES 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the courageous actions 
of a brave and heroic senior member of 
the Louisville Fire Department. On 
February 3, 2022, Captain Kody Jones, a 
17-year veteran of the department, 
went above and beyond the call of duty 
to save the lives of four people: three 
adults and one small child. 
Around 2 pm, a fire was reported at a 
home in the 100 block of Stevenson Av-
enue. 
Without 
hesitation, 
Captain 
Jones, who was on his way to work, re-
sponded to the scene. Once at the resi-
dence, Captain Jones safely rescued the 
four individuals without injury to 
them or to himself. 
Captain Jones then instructed emer-
gency dispatchers on essential details 
concerning the fire. Using his 17 years 
of experience, Captain Jones was able 
to direct responding units to the best 
position and angle of attack to fight 
the blaze. He also relayed the fire’s size 
and position and the building’s mate-
rial composition. These details were in-
strumental in firefighters being able to 
stop the fire within 1 hour of being on 
the scene. Following these heroic ac-
tions, Captain Jones reported to the 
fire station to continue to serve on his 
assigned shift. 
Captain Jones’ actions that day were 
critical in saving four lives, mini-
mizing structural damage, and con-
taining the blaze. I salute Captain

Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
KAINE, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. BENNET, Mr. 
WYDEN, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. 
PADILLA, Mr. HICKENLOOPER, and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 702 
Whereas the United States and Mexico 
share extensive economic, security, cultural, 
and democratic ties, especially a mutual 
commitment to respecting and promoting 
universally recognized human rights, demo-
cratic values, and the rule of law; 
Whereas freedom of the press is an essen-
tial component of democratic governance, as 
recognized in the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter, done at Lima September 11, 
2001, and journalists should have the right to 
report the news objectively, in safety, with-
out retribution or threats thereof; 
Whereas attacks against journalists and 
other media workers is a significant concern 
for freedom of the press and human rights in 
Mexico, especially among journalists and 
other media workers who report on public 
corruption and illicit activities and are fre-
quently subject to threats, coercion, intimi-
dation, surveillance, forcible relocation, vio-
lence, and even death; 
Whereas, according to Reporters Without 
Borders, more than 150 journalists have been 
killed in Mexico since 2000; 
Whereas, according to Reporters Without 
Borders, Mexico was the most dangerous 
country in the world outside a war zone for 
journalists for the third consecutive year in 
2021 and ranked 127 out of 180 countries in 
the World Press Freedom Index in 2022; 
Whereas, as of 2022, the Committee to Pro-
tect Journalists has documented 15 cases of 
missing reporters in Mexico, the highest 
number of any country in the world; 
Whereas, in 2022, at least 12 extrajudicial 
killings of journalists have occurred in Mex-
ico, including the killings of— 
(1) Jose´ Luis Gamboa Arenas on January 
10; 
(2) Alfonso Margarito Martı´nez Esquivel on 
January 17; 
(3) Maria Guadalupe Lourdes Maldonado 
Lo´pez on January 23; 
(4) Roberto Toledo Barrera on January 31; 
(5) Heber Lo´pez Va´squez on February 10; 
(6) Jorge Luis Camero Zazueta on February 
24; 
(7) Juan Carlos Mun˜ iz on March 4; 
(8) Armando Linares Lo´pez on March 15; 
(9) Luis Enrique Ramı´rez on May 5; 
(10) Yessenia Mollinedo Falconi on May 9; 
(11) Sheila Johana Garcı´a Olivera on May 
9; and 
(12) Antonio de la Cruz on June 29; 
Whereas at least 9 of the 12 journalists 
murdered in Mexico in 2022 were killed in di-
rect connection with their work, according 
to Reporters without Borders; 
Whereas the President of Mexico, Andre´s 
Manuel Lo´pez Obrador, has sometimes dem-
onstrated hostility towards the free press 
and enabled an unsafe working environment 
for independent journalists by regularly, 
publicly disparaging and intimidating jour-
nalists who are critical of the policies of or 
investigate corruption related to associates 
of his administration; 
Whereas perpetrators of violence against 
journalists in Mexico are rarely held to ac-
count, with Mexico ranking among the coun-
tries with the most unsolved murders of 
journalists per capita and more than 95 per-
cent of crimes against journalists in the 
country going unpunished, according to the 
International Federation of Journalists; 
Whereas initiatives taken thus far by the 
Government of Mexico to address violence 
against journalists, namely the creation of 
the Federal Mechanism for the Protection of 
Human Rights Defenders and Journalists (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Federal 
Protection Mechanism’’) in 2012, have not 
achieved stated goals and have been marred 
by significant implementation issues, ac-
cording to a March 2019 report by the Wash-
ington Office on Latin America, including— 
(1) insufficient financial and human re-
sources; 
(2) inadequate risk analysis and protection 
protocols; 
(3) limited transparency and oversight; and 
(4) limited coordination between local, 
state, and national entities; 
Whereas the decision by President Lo´pez 
Obrador to eliminate independent funding 
for the Federal Protection Mechanism in Oc-
tober 2020 has the potential to further exac-
erbate the resource constraints of the Fed-
eral Protection Mechanism and undermine 
the ability of the Federal Protection Mecha-
nism to protect at-risk journalists and other 
human rights defenders; 
Whereas, as a result of a failure to rectify 
recognized issues with the Federal Protec-
tion Mechanism, at least 9 journalists have 
been killed while receiving protection in 
Mexico, with the majority of such journal-
ists killed during the tenure of President 
Lo´pez Obrador, according to Human Rights 
Watch; 
Whereas the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights and the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico 
have expressed concerns about violence 
against journalists in Mexico, asserting that 
‘‘impunity in attacks against journalists fos-
ters further violence against reporters and 
may inhibit the exercise of freedom of ex-
pression’’, and offered recommendations to 
address such concerns;

SENATE RESOLUTION 703—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 2022 AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ AND JUNE 
27, 2022, AS ‘‘NATIONAL POST- 
TRAUMATIC 
STRESS 
AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself, Ms. 
BALDWIN, Mr. TILLIS, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. 
CRUZ, Mr. KELLY, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mr. TUBERVILLE, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, and Mr. HOEVEN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 703 
Whereas the brave men and women of the 
Armed Forces, who proudly serve the United 
States— 
(1) risk their lives to protect the freedom, 
health, and welfare of the people of the 
United States; and 
(2) deserve the investment of every pos-
sible resource to ensure their lasting phys-
ical, mental, and emotional well-being; 
Whereas, since the events of September 11, 
2001, nearly 2,800,000 members of the Armed 
Forces have deployed overseas and served in 
places such as Afghanistan and Iraq; 
Whereas the current generation of men and 
women in the Armed Forces has sustained a 
high rate of operational deployments, with 
many members of the Armed Forces serving 
overseas multiple times, placing those mem-
bers at high risk of enduring traumatic com-
bat stress; 
Whereas, when left untreated, exposure to 
traumatic combat stress can lead to severe 
and chronic post-traumatic stress responses, 
which are commonly referred to as post- 
traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘PTSD’’) or post-traumatic 
stress injury; 
Whereas many men and women of the 
Armed Forces and veterans who served be-
fore September 11, 2001, live with mental 
health needs from post-traumatic stress and 
remain at risk for responses to that stress; 
Whereas many post-traumatic stress re-
sponses remain unreported, undiagnosed, and 
untreated due to a lack of awareness about 
post-traumatic stress and the persistent 
stigma associated with mental health condi-
tions; 
Whereas 
post-traumatic 
stress 
signifi-
cantly increases the risk of post-traumatic 
stress responses, including anxiety, depres-
sion, homelessness, substance abuse, and sui-
cide, especially if left untreated; 
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
reports that— 
(1) between 11 and 20 percent of veterans 
who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or 
Operation Enduring Freedom have post-trau-
matic stress in a given year; 
(2) approximately 12 percent of veterans 
who served in the Persian Gulf War have 
post-traumatic stress in a given year; and 
(3) approximately 30 percent of veterans 
who served in the Vietnam era have had 
post-traumatic stress in their lifetimes; 
Whereas public perceptions of post-trau-
matic stress as a mental health disorder cre-
ate unique challenges for veterans seeking 
employment; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans 
service organizations, and the private and 
public medical community have made sig-
nificant advances in the identification, pre-
vention, diagnosis, and treatment of post- 
traumatic stress and the symptoms of post- 
traumatic stress, but many challenges re-
main; 
Whereas increased understanding of post- 
traumatic stress can help eliminate stigma 
attached to the mental health issues of post- 
traumatic stress; 
Whereas additional efforts are needed to 
find further ways to eliminate the stigma as-
sociated with post-traumatic stress, includ-
ing— 
(1) an examination of how post-traumatic 
stress is discussed in the United States; and 
(2) a recognition that post-traumatic stress 
is a common injury that is treatable; 
Whereas timely and appropriate treatment 
of post-traumatic stress responses can di-
minish complications and avert suicides; 
Whereas post-traumatic stress— 
(1) can result from any number of stressors 
other than combat, including rape, sexual as-
sault, battery, torture, confinement, child 
abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane 
crashes, bombings, natural disasters, or glob-
al pandemics; and 
(2) affects approximately 12,000,000 adults 
in the United States annually; 
Whereas the diagnosis of PTSD was first 
defined by the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation in 1980 to commonly and more accu-
rately understand and treat survivors of 
physical and psychological trauma, includ-
ing veterans who had endured severe trau-
matic combat stress; 
Whereas the word ‘‘disorder’’ can perpet-
uate the stigma associated with combat 
stress, so the more general term ‘‘post-trau-
matic stress’’ is often preferred; and 
Whereas the designation of a National 
Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month and 
a National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness 
Day raises public awareness about issues re-
lating to post-traumatic stress, reduces the 
stigma 
associated 
with 
post-traumatic 
stress, and helps ensure that individuals suf-
fering from the invisible wounds of war re-
ceive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates— 
(A) June 2022 as ‘‘National Post-Traumatic 
Stress Awareness Month’’; and 
(B) June 27, 2022, as ‘‘National Post-Trau-
matic Stress Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense, 
and the entire medical community to edu-
cate members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
the families of members of the Armed Forces 
and veterans, and the public about the 
causes, symptoms, and treatment of post- 
traumatic stress; 
(3) supports efforts by the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of De-
fense to foster— 
(A) cultural change around the issue of 
post-traumatic stress; and 
(B) understanding that personal inter-
actions can save lives and advance treat-
ment; 
(4) welcomes the efforts of the National 
Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs and local 
Vet Centers (as defined in section 1712A(h) of 
title 38, United States Code) to provide as-
sistance to veterans who are suffering from 
the effects of post-traumatic stress; 
(5) encourages the leadership of the Armed 
Forces to support appropriate treatment of 
men and women of the Armed Forces who

HONORING LIEUTENANT TROY 
MORRIS HIGHWAY SIGN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Memorial 
Highway Sign of Lieutenant Troy Morris. 
Lieutenant Morris served the Mississippi 
Highway Patrol (MHP) for over 27 years. He 
became a Mississippi Highway Patrolman then 
was promoted to Lieutenant of Troop M in 
Brookhaven, MS. Lieutenant Morris was also 
employed with the United States Postal Serv-
ices for approximately 16 years. He was shot 
and killed by an assailant in the early morning 
hours of August 7, 2020. 
On Tuesday, March 29, 2022, Central 
Transportation Commissioner Willie Simmons 
joined officials to dedicate a segment of U.S. 
Highway 61 in Jefferson County as the ‘‘High-
way Patrol Lieutenant Troy Morris Memorial 
Highway.’’ 
During the 2021 legislative session, House 
Bill No. 872 was signed into law, designating 
a segment of U.S. Highway 61 located in Jef-
ferson County, beginning at the Town of Fay-
ette, and extending northerly for one mile, as 
the ‘‘Highway Patrol Lieutenant Troy Morris 
Memorial Highway.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Lieutenant Troy 
Morris for his amazing dedication, hard work 
and legacy he has left behind to his family, 
friends, colleagues, and Mississippi, especially 
the Second Congressional District.

TRIBUTE TO CAMILLO WILDE FOR 
HIS NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY 
SERVICE 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Camillo Wilde, a son of 
immigrant parents, who graduated from Los 
Angeles High School with Ephebinan honors 
in 1947. After graduation, he went on to serve 
in the Korean War and upon release, he 
joined the U.S. Army Reserve serving as a 
Mobilization Designee during the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis. He further served with the Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Intelligence at the Pentagon 
and was awarded the Meritorious Service 
Medal. 
After 27 years of service, he retired with the 
rank of Colonel. In 1960, he moved to the 
California Central Coast serving as Lompoc 
Unified School District’s High School Assistant 
Principal, Junior High and High School Prin-
cipal, and Assistant Superintendent. During 
that time, he worked with the City of Lompoc 
to establish basketball courts on school prop-
erty to allow practice of teams participating in 
City League BB Program. He further worked 
to establish the first onsite Community Voca-
tional Resource Center. He retired after 31 
years in public education. 
After his retirement from education, he fur-
ther went on to dedicate his life to public serv-
ice, culminating in 34 years. He served on the 
Santa Barbara County Planning Commission 
from 1992 to 1996, during which time he was 
Chair and guided the Commission through the 
Orcutt Community Plan. As a member of the 
Planning Commission, he worked with the 
community to receive Coastal Resource En-
hancement Funds for the Cabrillo High School 
Aquarium Project. Camillo further served on 
the County’s Assessment Appeals Board. 
Camillo also served on the Santa Barbara 
County School Committee District Organiza-
tion, as well as the Allan Hancock College 
Measure ‘‘I’’ Bond Committee. Importantly, the 
Cabrillo High School Alumni Association in-
ducted Camillo Wilde, Founding Principal and 
Legacy Leader, into its Hall of Fame. 
Madam Speaker, Camillo Wilde is a testa-
ment to his community, and it is only fitting 
that he should be honored. I respectfully ask 
that you join me in expressing immense grati-
tude to Camillo Wilde for his extraordinary 
leadership and dedication to his community.

HONORING 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
BROWARD COUNTY LEAGUE OF 
CITIES, BOB MAYERSOHN 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Parkland City Commissioner Bob 
Mayersohn, who was sworn in as the Broward 
League of Cities’ newest President at the 65th 
Annual Gala on May 13, 2022. 
Bob moved to Florida in 1983 and imme-
diately involved himself in community causes 
and activities. He has gone above and beyond 
to exemplify what it means to serve one’s 
community throughout his tenure in public 
service. Bob was a founding member of the 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Par-
ent Teacher Student Association (PTSA). He 
has also served the city in multiple capacities, 
from his time as chair of the Education Advi-
sory Board and Member of the City Planning 
and Zoning Board, to serving as City Commis-
sioner since 2016. 
Noting the lack of athletic opportunities for 
children with disabilities, Bob was instrumental 
in the start of the Parkland Buddy Sports Pro-
gram. So many kids and their families have 
had meaningful opportunities as a result of 
this terrific program, that Bob helped get off 
the ground. 
Bob has always had a profound impact with-
in the community since he served and through 
his caring, commitment, and professionalism, 
our community has thrived. Throughout his 
time in public service, Bob has been defined 
by his integrity, excellence, and unending 
dedication to the community. The City of Park-
land is fortunate to have this amazing person 
contributing to their community. 
Congratulations to Bob Mayersohn on being 
sworn in as the Broward County League of 
Cities President. We look forward to seeing 
his continued outstanding service throughout 
the county and to the 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict of Florida. I am pleased to honor him, and 
I thank him for his continued service.

Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Chief Kevin Nord as he re-
tires from the Duxbury Fire Department after 
44 years of service to our community. 
With a passion for helping others from a 
young age, Chief Nord first began his career 
in 1978, as an on-call firefighter with the King-
ston Fire Department. Rising through the 
ranks, Chief Nord went on to become an EMT, 
paramedic, and fire captain in 1994. During

the Kingston Fire Department’s first medical 
system coordinator. 
Chief Nord’s commitment to protecting both 
the public and his fellow emergency respond-
ers did not go unnoticed. In 2004, after 26 
years with the Kingston Fire Department, 
Chief Nord was named fire chief of the 
Duxbury Fire Department. During Chief Nord’s 
18 years with the Duxbury Fire Department, 
Nord worked to increase diversity within the 
department by hiring more women, supervised 
the growth of the department with a new fire-
fighters’ quarter being added to the Central 
Fire Station, and served as the director of 
Duxbury’s Emergency Management Agency, 
leading the town’s response during blizzards, 
hurricanes, and power outages. Recognizing 
the advantages and importance of his medical 
training, Chief Nord advocated for his fire-
fighters to become paramedics, hired more 
EMTs to the department, and had the Duxbury 
Fire Department incorporate advanced life 
support protocols. 
Chief Nord has served as a leader not only 
to those in the Kingston and Duxbury Fire De-
partments, but also to firefighters across the 
Commonwealth. Throughout his career, Chief 
Nord chaired the Massachusetts Technical 
Rescue Coordinating Council and the South-
eastern 
Massachusetts 
Technical 
Rescue 
Team, initiated the Regional Old Colony Com-
munications Center, which handles 911 calls 
and 
dispatches 
emergency 
services 
to 
Duxbury and several other surrounding towns, 
and established the Plymouth County Critical 
Incident Stress Management Team—a group 
that assists first responders address job re-
lated stress and trauma. As a founding mem-
ber of the Plymouth County Critical Incident 
Stress Management Team, Chief Nord and his 
team provided support to first responders at 
the World Trade Center following the attacks 
on September 11, 2001. 
Chief Nord has devoted his career to help-
ing and protecting all throughout the South 
Shore. After 44 years of service, Chief Nord 
will officially retire on July 15th, and plans to 
travel across the Trans America Trail on his 
motorcycle. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Chief 
Kevin Nord. I ask that my colleagues join me 
in recognizing his career and commitment to 
serving his community.

HONORING STEVE ORNDORF 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Steve Orndorf 
for his outstanding contributions to our com-
munity. 
During his 39 years living in Napa County, 
Mr. Orndorf was an active member of our 
community. He served terms as the President 
of the School Board, Rotary, Wildlife Con-
servation Commission, and the Boys & Girls 
Club. Mr. Orndorf loved to volunteer and fre-
quently helped with the Napa River Steelhead 
Monitoring Program. He also served on the 
Board of the Napa Valley Bank. 
Mr. Orndorf was passionate about men-
toring veterans who suffered from Post-Trau-
matic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He worked with 
veterans 
from 
the 
Pathway 
Home 
in 
Yountville, and the Post Deployment Assess-
ment Treatment Program in the Martinez Vet-
erans Affairs Center. His infectious spirit made 
him easy to get along with, and he continued 
relationships with many of the veterans even 
after they graduated from the program. 
Mr. Orndorf lived a life of love and adven-
ture. He will be remembered as a loving hus-
band, father, grandfather, brother, and friend. 
Mr. Orndorf had many passions, including fish-
ing, mushroom hunting, bird watching, watch-
ing the weather, rock and beer can collecting, 
being in the outdoors, watching the Oakland 
A’s and the San Francisco 49ers, writing, and 
mentoring. His most treasured hobbies were 
fishing in the jungles of South America and 
helping others however he could. 
Mr. Orndorf sadly passed away on July 14, 
2020, and he will be greatly missed by our 
community. Madam Speaker, it is evident that 
Steve Orndorf has left a monumental impact 
on our Napa County community. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor him and his 
legacy here today.

Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan. 
This 
special 
occasion 
and 
Washtenaw Community College’s nearly 60 
years of educating and enriching our commu-
nity is worthy of commendation. 
This building is named after Dr. Morris J. 
Lawrence, an influential musician, and former 
Washtenaw Community College jazz orchestra 
instructor. Dr. Lawrence made a tremendous 
impact on his students and our community 
with his teaching and his music, and this build-
ing was dedicated to him shortly after his 
passing in 1993. A native of New Orleans, 
Louisiana and a gifted musician, Dr. Lawrence 
started composing music in high school. He 
studied instrumental music at Xavier University 
of Louisiana, and after graduation moved to 
Ann Arbor to teach band at St. Thomas High 
School. He later became the director of music 
at 
the 
school 
and 
began 
teaching 
at 
Washtenaw Community College—all while 
working on his doctorate at the University of 
Michigan. A legendary teacher who touched 
the lives of so many, he wrote forty band com-
positions, sixty-four dance orchestra pieces, 
and four string quartets before the age of 30. 
The reopening of the Morris Lawrence build-
ing follows an eight-month closure for renova-
tion and upgrades. The building includes a 
495-seat auditorium and is a hub for the cre-
ative arts student community. The remodeled 
Morris Lawrence Building and its new techno-
logical advancements will allow Washtenaw 
Community College to provide many years of 
quality education to present and future stu-
dents. A new eco-friendly energy system, fast 
high-speed internet, and other welcoming 
amenities are among the new features that will 
enrich the student experience and reinforce a 
positive learning environment. Founded in 
1965, Washtenaw Community College enrolls 
nearly twenty thousand students annually and 
offers over one hundred degree or certificate 
programs in numerous subject fields. The col-
lege has partnerships with local and national 
businesses as well as the University of Michi-
gan and Eastern Michigan University to help 
their students follow any path they choose. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Washtenaw Community Col-
lege on this special day as the ribbon is cut 
at the entrance of the renovated Morris Law-
rence Building. We are grateful to President 
Rose Bellanca and the Board of Trustees for 
their commitment to making Washtenaw Com-
munity College a fantastic place to learn and 
grow for Washtenaw County students of all 
ages. This new and improved creative arts fa-
cility will be an asset to the college and to the 
greater Washtenaw community for years to 
come.

HONORING CARMEN BROCKS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Fire Chief Carmen Brocks from 
Flora, Mississippi. 
A 1986 graduate of Provine High School, 
she furthered her education at Southern Uni-
versity in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on a bas-
ketball scholarship and graduated in 1990. 
Throughout her young adult life, Ms. Brocks 
was very active in sports and was known as 
a kind, caring, friendly and compassionate in-
dividual. Not long after college, she decided to 
attend the Jackson Fire Academy to become 
a firefighter with much encouragement from 
her family. She also completed the course 
work with a B.S. Degree in Fire Administration 
at Columbia Southern University. 
In November 1993, Ms. Brocks began her 
career as a Firefighter I at the Jackson Fire 
Department and graduated as a Firefighter II 
in 1994. 
After 9 months, Ms. Brocks started climbing 
the ladder with the fire services, when she 
completed the requirements and successfully 
passed the exam to become a Relief Driver 
Operator. In 1998, she was promoted as the 
1st female in the emergency services division 
to become Lieutenant under the leadership 
and supervision of, then, Captain Willie 
Owens. Ms. Brocks still kept striving in her 
professional career as the first female in the 
emergency services division to become Cap-
tain. In 2010, she became the first female Dis-
trict Chief, which she held for 8 years. In 
March of 2018, District Chief Brocks was ap-
pointed to Division Fire Chief of the Emer-
gency Service Division under the leadership of 
Fire Chief Willie Owens. 
Chief Brocks has blazed the trail for any Af-
rican-American female who may want to follow 
in her appointment as Division Fire Chief. That 
also goes for any female who may want to fol-
low in her footsteps. Chief Brocks truly be-
lieves, ‘‘to achieve anything, it requires faith, 
belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determina-
tion and dedication.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Fire Chief Carmen Brocks 
for her dedication to serving.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF MATT 
POLKA’S RETIREMENT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to acknowledge the re-
tirement of Mr. Matt Polka, the longtime Chair-
man and President of ACA Connects. Matt’s 
tenure, from the inception of the organization 
to the effective organization it has become 
today, has been marked by his integrity and 
his earnest commitment to representing the 
small, hometown businesses that have built 
and managed the cable and broadband net-
works that Americans depend on. Matt also 
distinguished himself in Washington by his 
common decency, his love of a good con-
versation about politics, and a desire to help 
anyone he could. 
Those values have been clearly shaped by 
his deep roots in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
There is not a person who worked with Matt 
that didn’t know of his love and affection for 
his wife, Sharman, his daughters, Molly and 
Annie, and his pride in being from the Three 
Rivers area. 
Under Matt’s guidance and leadership, ACA 
Connects grew from an informal grassroots ef-
fort to being one of the preeminent tele-
communications organizations in Washington. 
He ensured his members had a voice in all 
the important debates that have occurred 
since taking the helm of ACA Connects. 
Those efforts span the re-examination of the 
1992 Telecommunications Act to each reau-
thorization of the satellite industry to the latest 
broadband deployment and adoption initia-
tives. His work was a mile wide and a mile 
deep. 
Matt has helped my constituents in Ohio 
through his work to improve broadband infra-
structure and access. Many of my constituents 
live in rural areas and Matt’s advocacy has 
aided efforts to ensure that they can get on-
line. Additionally, Matt has been a strong ad-
vocate for small businesses across the coun-
try and championed efforts to cut the bureau-
cratic red tape that hampers them. 
ACA Connects earned its reputation through 
his unwavering vision and mantra to work with 
everyone, to find places of agreement, and to 
focus on common interests rather than focus 
on differences and partisanship. That ap-
proach has earned him the respect of so 
many Members, staff, and counsels across the 
Hill along with the various officials in adminis-
trations that have been in place during his 
time. The respect shown to Matt also comes 
from others—including consumer groups and 
businesses—even when his work puts him on 
opposite sides of an issue. 
Guided by his faith, he has been a firm and 
determined advocate for his members and he 
has done so with conviction, character, and 
fairness. After 25 years of service to ACA 
Connects, I want to recognize his work and 
offer my best wishes for his next chapter of 
service in life. 
DON DAVIS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Don Davis for his years of 
service as County Manager for Jefferson 
County, Colorado. 
Throughout his five years as the County 
Manager, Don showed tremendous dedication, 
dependability, and leadership, directing the or-
ganizational and administrative operations of 
3,000 employees and one of the largest coun-
ties in the state. As the fourth-most populous 
county in Colorado which serves as the gate-
way from the Denver Metro region to the 
Rocky Mountains, Jefferson County has had 
to face a variety of issues in recent years 
ranging from the COVID–19 pandemic and 
budget shortfalls to wildfire events and infra-
structure challenges. At every turn, Don has 
led with a pragmatic and innovative approach. 
Don began his post-graduate career as a 
Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine 
Corps and served his country through numer-
ous deployments to the Middle East. Following 
his 27 years of service in the U.S. military, he 
retired with the rank of Colonel in 2017. 
Don has successfully navigated Jefferson 
County and its residents through an unprece-
dented pandemic while continuing to move the 
region forward on climate change issues and 
creating a better quality of life for all Jeff co 
residents. I am incredibly thankful for his serv-
ice and dedication to the people of Jefferson 
County and wish him well in his future en-
deavors.

ure that I honor them. 
HONORING NORTH CAROLINA PO-

OFFICER 
OF 
THE 
YEAR 
TRAVIS SMITH 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Kannapolis Police Sergeant Travis 
Smith on being recognized as the 2021–2022 
North Carolina Police Officer of the Year. 
A native of Cabarrus County, Sergeant 
Smith graduated from Northwest Cabarrus 
High School in 1999 before joining the United 
States Marine Corps Reserve in 2000. He was 
deployed to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Free-
dom and served in the United States Army 
Reserves upon completing his assignment. In 
2006, Sergeant Smith started with Kannapolis 
Police Department as a patrol officer. He be-
came a Field Training Officer in 2014 and was 
later promoted to Sergeant in 2016. He con-
tinues to provide extraordinary service to his 
community as a member of Patrol Squad D. 
Over the course of this career, Sergeant 
Smith has continuously demonstrated the 
highest level of sacrifice and bravery as a 
member of both the military and law enforce-
ment. In 2013, he was awarded a Life Saving 
Award for rescuing a civilian from their burning 
home. His courageous action resulting in this 
previous distinction highlights just one exam-
ple of his unassailable commitment to pro-
tecting 
and 
defending 
the 
residents 
of 
Kannapolis. 
The North Carolina Police Officer of the 
Year award is sponsored by the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars (VFW) organization. Sergeant 
Smith was nominated by Kannapolis VFW 
Post 8989 and selected from a statewide field 
of qualified police officers. In being recognized 
as the 2021–2022 National Police Officer of 
the Year, Sergeant Smith is now also recog-
nized as a National VFW Police Officer of the 
Year. Sergeant Smith has made an immeas-
urable impact on our community and is incred-
ibly deserving of these distinctions. I would 
like to offer my sincerest appreciation and 
wish him success as he continues to serve 
and set an example for all in our community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Sergeant Travis Smith as the 2021– 
2022 North Carolina Police Officer of the Year 
and wish him well as he continues his exem-
plary service to our community.

HONORING PRETRIAL, PROBATION 
AND PAROLE WEEK 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the nation’s community supervision 
professionals and the many vital roles they 
play in their work with justice-involved adults 
and juveniles. They identify opportunities and 
services to help individuals contribute to soci-
ety, while, at the same time, holding them ac-
countable for their actions. 
In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole 
Supervision Week 2022, we salute all of those 
who have chosen this important career. In the 
District of Columbia, we especially thank the 
Court Services and Offender Supervision 
Agency for the District of Columbia and the 
Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Co-
lumbia and their employees for their work. 
Their work reflects the theme of Pretrial, Pro-
bation and Parole Supervision Week 2022, 
‘‘Restoring Trust, Creating Hope.’’ 
As was the case last year, community su-
pervision professionals have once again dem-
onstrated great courage and resolve in con-
tinuing their work during the coronavirus pan-
demic. They have found innovative ways to re-
main connected with the people they super-
vise and to continue guiding them in the inter-
est of public safety. 
Community supervision agencies are valu-
able partners of government agencies, non- 
profits, neighborhood-based groups, and all 
who strive to make our nation safer and 
stronger. We extend our gratitude to them and 
recognize their many achievements as we pro-
claim July 17–23, 2022, as Pretrial, Probation 
and Parole Supervision Week 2022.

HONORING LEAH SHOEMAKER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Leah Shoe-
maker. Leah recently competed in the U.S. 
Special Olympics and won gold in the long 
jump and mini javelin competitions, while also 
placing 5th in the 100-meter dash. 
Leah is a St. Joseph native and while she 
has been involved in athletic competition for 
17 years, 2022 was her first U.S.A. National 
Games. While she has certainly put in the 
hard work and discipline to make herself into 
a champion, her first inspiration was her moth-
er, Jean Ann Davis. Jean Ann encouraged her 
to participate and remains Leah’s greatest 
supporter and cheerleader. To excel in even 
one of these events is impressive, to excel 
and win against the best athletes in multiple 
sports is awe inspiring. Her example of hard 
work, dedication and excellence is deserving 
of being honored and commended. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking Leah for her accomplishments 
and dedication that proudly represent the peo-
ple of the Sixth Congressional District. I am 
proud to represent Leah Shoemaker in the 
United States House of Representatives.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-

HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 40th anniversary of New 
Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR). 
For decades, NHPR’s mission has always 
been to provide objective and engaging report-
ing for New Hampshire. Previously called the 
Granite State Public Radio, the independent 
public radio broadcasted for the first time in 
1981. To this day, NHPR is the largest and 
only station that broadcasts state-wide. 
NHPR has reported on key moments in 
New Hampshire’s history such as the Chal-
lenger tragedy in 1986, New Hampshire’s first 
in the nation primaries throughout the years, 
and more recently, the effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic across the state. In 2021, NHPR 
began broadcasting in Spanish, a necessary 
expansion to include our state’s ever-growing 
Spanish-speaking population. Recognized by 
the Radio Television Digital News Association, 
NHPR has won awards in digital, investigative 
reporting, hard news, and news documentary 
categories. NHPR has long stood as a back-
bone for state-wide news, and it is through 
their important work that all Granite Staters 
are able to stay informed. 
On behalf of my constituents across New 
Hampshire’s Second Congressional District, I 
would like to thank and congratulate New 
Hampshire Public Radio for all the work they 
have done and will continue to do for our 
state.

Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of my friend, Father Alexander 
Karloutsos, who was recently awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, our nation’s 
highest civilian honor. 
Father Alex has spent more than half a cen-
tury as a Greek Orthodox Priest, including as 
the pastor of Kimisis Tis Theotokou Greek Or-
thodox Church of the Hamptons, in the First 
Congressional District of New York. 
In 1994, His All Holiness Ecumenical Patri-

which is the highest honor a married clergy-
man can receive in the Orthodox Church. 
He has also served as the first Vicar of Pub-
lic Affairs of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese 
of America and as a spiritual advisor to sev-
eral U.S. Presidents. 
I am grateful to Father Alex for his decades 
of service to the Greek Orthodox community, 
Long Island, and our Nation. I send my sin-
cere congratulations to Father Alex, his wife, 
Xanthi Karavellas Karloutsos, their three chil-
dren, and nine grandchildren. This honor is so 
well deserved.

Kids First Health Care is a non-profit pedi-

HONORING THE 801ST ENGINEER 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today along with Congressman 
JOHN GARAMENDI, to honor the 801st Engineer 
Construction Company of the 397th Engineer 
Battalion, U.S. Army Reserves for its excep-
tional service in the restoration of the Mare Is-
land Naval Cemetery in Vallejo, California. 
The 801st Engineer Construction Company 
was first established on July 8, 1942 and was 
activated in Northern Ireland in the same year. 
Additionally, individual soldiers from the com-
pany were mobilized in support of the Korean 
and Vietnam wars. In 1975, the company relo-
cated to the Oakland Army Base before relo-
cating to Vallejo on July 25, 2000. 
The 801st Engineer Construction Company 
has been instrumental in the revitalization 
process of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery, 
which had fallen into disrepair over the last 30 
years. The challenging restoration of this 2.5- 
acre cemetery began after the City of Vallejo 
applied for the Department of Defense Innova-
tive Readiness Training Program to begin 
transforming Mare Island Naval Cemetery into 
a proper burial site for our veterans. 
Soldiers from the 801st Engineer Construc-
tion Company, the 322nd Engineer Vertical 
Construction Company, senior leaders from 
the 416th Theater Engineer Command, and

volunteers began the work in the cemetery in 
August 2019, cutting down invasive trees and 
overgrowth, 
restoring 
and 
cleaning 
of 
headstones, repairing the drainage system, 
and fixing the perimeter retaining wall. After 
four years of hard work, they have nearly 
completed this extensive project. 
The Mare Island Naval Cemetery, the oldest 
naval cemetery on the West Coast, is home to 
over 860 soldiers, marines, and sailors who 
served in conflicts such as the War of 1812 
and World War I. It is also home to dozens of 
their relatives who are interred there. The 
work of the 801st Engineer Construction Com-
pany has allowed us to restore this cemetery 
back to a sacred final resting place for our 
brave men and women in uniform and their 
families. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
801st Engineer Construction Company has 
played a vital role in ensuring the Mare Island 
Naval Cemetery is preserved for generations 
to come. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor the company and its soldiers here 
today.

HONORING VETERAN HENRY R. 
CASTRO 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of World War II and Viet-
nam veteran, Mr. Henry R. Castro. A San An-
tonio native, Mr. Castro has dedicated his life 
to service, community, and country. Please 
join me in recognizing the story of this extraor-
dinary American. 
Henry R. Castro was born on April 26, 
1927. The son of a butcher and grocer, Juan 
and Maria Castro, he grew up learning about 
hard work. On June 12, 1945, Mr. Castro en-
listed into the United States Army and was as-
signed to the 78th Infantry Division, being de-
ployed to Berlin, Germany. On November 29, 
1946, Mr. Castro was honorably discharged as 
a Private First Class under HQ Company, 2nd 
Battalion, 3rd Infantry. As Cold War tensions 
rose, Mr. Castro heard the call of duty and re-
enlisted into the U.S. Army on August 21, 
1948, and shortly thereafter was deployed to 
Trieste, Italy. There, he was assigned to the 
T.R.U.S.T. troops in the Italian Alps tasked 
with defending Trieste against then Com-
munist Yugoslavia. He was later honorably 
discharged on June 27, 1950. 
In 1951, Mr Castro was hired on at Kelly Air 
Force Base serving as a Civil Service Em-
ployee and later at Brooks Air Force Base. 
During his civil service tenure, Mr. Castro also 
served in the Air Force Reserves for more 
than 7 years under the 433rd Troop Carrier 
Wing. In the summer of 1967 due to his re-
serve status, he was recalled into active duty 
during the Vietnam War and during the North 
Korean’s capture of the U.S.S. Pueblo. He re-
mained on active duty until his retirement date 
of June 1, 1984. Mr. Castro retired as a U.S. 
Air Force Master Sergeant. 
For his service in the armed forces in de-
fense of our nation, Mr. Castro received the 
following: World War II Victory Medal and Rib-
bon, Overseas Service Bar, Army of Occupa-
tion Medal Germany, Air Force Outstanding 
Unit Award, Air Force Good Conduct Medal 
with 
Four 
Devices, 
American 
Campaign 
Medal, 
European—African—Middle 
Eastern 
Campaign Medal, National Defense Service 
Medal with Four Oak Leaf Cluster, Armed 
Forces Expeditionary Medal, Air Force Lon-
gevity Service Award with Three Devices, 
Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, and 
the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
someone of such high caliber. On behalf of 
Texas’ 20th Congressional District, I thank Mr. 
Castro for his commitment and patriotism. I 
also thank Mr. Castro for everything he has 
done in-service to our great Nation. May God 
bless him and his loved ones.

CELEBRATION OF LEXINGTON, 
MISSOURI’S BICENTENNIAL 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the bicentennial of Lex-
ington, Missouri. For two hundred years, Lex-
ington has stood as a proud, historic city filled 
with hardworking people who embody the 
American Dream. As the people of Lexington 
gather to celebrate their bicentennial, let us 
take a moment to reflect on the town’s rich 
history. 
Located on the Missouri River, Lexington 
was first platted in 1822. Founded by Gilead 
Rupe, the town was established from a river 
port and grew as a result of trade along the 
Big Muddy. Lexington was named after Lex-
ington, Kentucky, as many of the city’s early 
settlers ventured from the Bluegrass State. 
Lexington soon became the county seat of La-
fayette County. 
In 1861, the town found itself at the center 
of the Civil War, as the Show-Me State split its 
support between the Union and the Confed-
eracy. Between September 19th and Sep-
tember 21st of that year, the town became en-
gulfed in the First Battle of Lexington Missouri, 
colloquially titled the Battle of the Hemp Bales. 
As Blue and Gray forces clashed, the Lafay-
ette County Courthouse was struck with a 
cannonball, where it remains lodged in the 
building’s eastern-most column to this day. 
Another landmark from the battle, the Oliver 
Anderson House, served as a Union hospital 
for the remainder of the war. 
Lexington’s history goes beyond the Civil 
War. Migrants traveled through the town on

the Santa Fe, Oregon, and the California 
trails. The town was also home to the head-
quarters of the trade firm of Russell, Majors, 
and Waddell, the founders of the Pony Ex-
press. Historic homes dot the town, including 
Linwood Lawn. The manor was described as 
‘‘the largest and most palatial home west of 
St. Louis’’ by the local newspaper when it was 
constructed in 1859. Today, after refurbish-
ment, it is still a shining example of a historic, 
antebellum home. The rich history of Lex-
ington is something its citizens are proud of 
and uphold. Indeed, history such as this is im-
portant at demonstrating the narrative of the 
town and our nation. 
Lexington has been home to various aca-
demic institutes over time. Throughout the 
1800s, multiple institutions for women were 
opened: including the Elizabeth Aull Seminary, 
Lexington Ladies’ College, and Central Col-
lege. In 1880, Wentworth Military Academy 
opened its doors, and throughout its operation, 
welcomed students from around the world. 
Wentworth became one of the oldest oper-
ating military academies west of the Mis-
sissippi River and remained open until 2017. 
Throughout its history, Wentworth produced 
many celebrated alumni, including the late 
Congressman Ike Skelton and two Medal of 
Honor recipients. Meanwhile, the Lexington 
School District continues to provide students 
with ample opportunities to succeed in aca-
demics, fine arts, and athletics. 
The city is home to industry and scenery 
that best exemplify our state and what it 
means to be a Missourian. From Lexington’s 
blufftop view of the Missouri River to the sur-
rounding farmland, one can see the lush 
beauty that defines the area. Lexington’s sur-
rounding farms, orchards, and vineyards offer 
bountiful harvests every year. And with over 
one hundred businesses in town, its economic 
activity is as fervent as ever. 
This historic town has been an important 
part of our nation’s narrative; home to hard- 
working, genuine people that exemplify the 
best of Missouri. For two hundred years, Lex-
ington has demonstrated the spirit of Missouri 
and America. Madam Speaker, please join me 
and my constituency in honoring Lexington for 
two hundred years of community and success, 
and in wishing them great prosperity in the fu-
ture.

HONORING AL MONTNA OF DUCKS 
UNLIMITED 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Al Montna, a true champion of con-
servation in Northern California. Al’s involve-
ment with Ducks Unlimited began in the early 
1960s when his natural love for waterfowl 
hunting drew him to the organization. Like 
many avid waterfowl hunters, Al realized early 
on that his passion could only be preserved 
and shared with future generations through 
conservation. 
Al began restoring the intricate web of wet-
lands and uplands that North America’s migra-
tory birds rely on each year to fulfill their life 
cycle needs. Al continually improves the wild-
life habitat on his own farm, transforming 
Montna Farms every fall and winter into a mi-
gratory bird wonderland. If you’ve traveled on 
highway 99 just outside of Yuba City between 
November and January, chances are, you’ve 
witnessed dozens of cars pulled over on the 
side of the road, with passengers leaning out 
the window using binoculars and cameras to 
glimpse the tens of thousands of waterfowl 
swarming around his rice fields. Thanks to 
dedicated conservationists like Al, people will 
be able to enjoy the wildlife of this region for 
years to come. 
As is the case with most family farms, and 
certainly with Montna Farms, Al has been 
blessed with a family that has a shared vision 
for what it means to be good stewards of the 
land. His two daughters, Nicole Montna Van 
Fleck and Michelle Montna Vogt share the 
family’s passion for the environment and being 
stewards of a more sustainable world. Today, 
they have begun to pass that same passion to 
Al’s six grandchildren. And of course, none of 
these achievements would have been possible 
without Gail Montna, Al’s wife and partner for 
55 years. Gail’s grace and shared loved of 
wildlife shines through all of Montna Farms; 
past, present and future. 
As a third generation Central Valley farmer, 
Al’s commitment to the land as well as the 
people and wildlife that depend on it is un-
matched. As the Bible tells us in Luke 12:48, 
To those much is given, much will be required. 
The responsibility to give back to his commu-
nity has been the forefront of Al’s mission 
since it began nearly 60 years ago. Now, after 
many decades of committed volunteer service 
to conservation, Al is retiring as the Senior 
Vice President for Public Policy at Ducks Un-
limited—a role he took over in 2017. Al’s pro-
fessional endeavors, awards, successes, inno-
vations and accomplishments are far too nu-
merous to list here. However, Al’s greatest 
achievement is his role as a steward for Amer-
ica’s wetlands and waterfowl resources, and 
that legacy will endure for generations to 
come.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID 
DICKSON 
HON. BLAKE D. MOORE 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of David Dickson. Utah 
lost a wonderful father and a man of faith. 
David was just forty-two years old when he 
died late last month due to medical complica-
tions, and he leaves behind his eight children. 
As a single father, David devoted his life to 
ensuring his children could have full and pros-
perous lives. 
Born and raised in Ogden, Utah, David was 
a man of the community. He graduated from 
Ogden High School and Weber State Univer-
sity—both of which I also attended. His life 
took him from Utah to Arizona to Idaho, where 
his family resides to this day. Despite difficulty 
in his most recent years, David was resolute 
in his determination to provide a bright future 
for his children and family. 
David’s eight children are between the ages 
of seven and eighteen years old. He was a 
devoted father who loved his children deeply. 
David will be dearly missed, and our commu-
nity will continue to lift his family up in prayer. 
REMEMBERING HORTON 
ALEXANDER ‘‘COTTON’’ ROSSER 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and lasting contribu-
tions of Horton Alexander ‘‘Cotton’’ Rosser. 
Passing away at the age of 93, Mr. Rosser 
leaves behind an indelible legacy in the rodeo 
world as a champion saddle bronc rider and 
owner of Flying U Rodeo Company, the oldest 
rodeo livestock company in the United States. 
In the 1950s, he made a name for himself 
in the rodeo world as a champion saddle 
bronc rider, including a prominent victory at 
the Reno Rodeo in 1950. Unfortunately, his 
competitive rodeo career abruptly ended in 
1956 when a ranch accident left him with two 
broken legs. 
However, Mr. Rosser remained an integral 
part of the rodeo world as the country’s pre-
mier rodeo rancher. In 1956, he bought the 
Flying U Rodeo Company, supplying rodeo 
animals and livestock. Over several decades, 
Mr. Rosser and his family built Flying U, 
based in Marysville, California, into one of the 
most successful stock contracting firms in pro-
fessional rodeo. 
In addition to stock contracting, Flying U 
produced around 50 rodeos annually; Mr. 
Rosser and his company became known for 
their outstanding rodeo productions. The 
showmanship of his rodeo opening cere-
monies presented at the National Finals 
Rodeo, the Houston Livestock Show, and the 
Grand National Rodeo in San Francisco raised 
the profile of the sport. 
Mr. Rosser was inducted into the ProRodeo 
Hall of Fame in 1995 and honored with a half- 
sized bronze statue in front of the Reno- 
Sparks Livestock Events Center commis-
sioned by past presidents of the Reno Rodeo 
Association. The statue remains a lasting trib-
ute to Mr. Rosser’s work as a longtime rodeo 
producer. In the same year, he became the 
first-ever Triple Crown winner at the National 
Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. The 
Western 
Fairs 
Association 
inducted 
Mr. 
Rosser into their Hall of Fame in 2014 for his 
incredible work supporting the fair industry. In 
2015, Mr. Rosser received the PRCA Donita 
Barnes Contract Personnel Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award. 
I would like to extend my deepest sym-
pathies to Mr. Rosser’s loved ones. I know 
that they, along with the rodeo community, join 
me in celebrating his life and legacy.

OF MISSISSIPPI

Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam

police officer, Orlando Bolden. 
Officer Bolden is a native of Grenada, MS. 
He began his career with the Grenada County 
Sheriff’s Department as a reserve deputy. He 
then moved to Duck Hill and worked for the 
Duck Hill Police Department.

When a full-time position became available 
in Vaiden, MS, he took the job and still worked 
part time in Duck Hill. Officer Bolden is cur-
rently working for the Winona Police Depart-
ment, going on 3 years now. 
What make Officer Bolden stand out from 
the other officers is that during the school 
year, he directs traffic in his own personal 
style. When people drive down Highway 407 
or Highway 51 during school traffic at Winona 
Elementary School, they will often see Officer 
Bolden dancing with his whistle in his mouth, 
directing traffic. 
Officer Bolden is well-known for his dance 
moves. Officer Bolden believes that enter-
taining traffic control is just of a small gesture 
that shows another side of law enforcement 
and that everything does not have to be so 
uptight and wound up. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Officer Orlando Bolden for 
his longevity and dedication to serving the 
community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DEREK TUCKER 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a beloved constituent of our 
community, revered music guru and pro-
claimed ‘‘Zen master’’—Mr. Derek Tucker. 
Throughout his life, he strived to bring peo-
ple together through a shared love for music. 
Over the course of his career, including as 
Vice President of a ticketing agency and vet-
eran concert promoter, he organized world-
wide tours for legendary figures like Miley 
Cyrus, Elton John, Paul McCartney, and Justin 
Bieber. 
He’s worked in what seems like every 
venue in New York City, from Brooklyn Steel 
to Terminal 5 to Central Park. 
Despite constantly being on the road for 
work—managing events and venues—he al-
ways made time for family. 
He had an extraordinary ability to unite peo-
ple and despite being away, maintained close 
ties with his faith, his family, and his commu-
nity. 
It is through his leadership and the 
mentorship of his fellow colleagues that Mr. 
Tucker will continue to shape the music indus-
try. He will serve as an inspiration for future 
generations as he exemplifies the resilience of 
my community in face of adversity. 
He will be remembered by everyone in the 
Inwood, Albany, and music communities alike 
for his invaluable contributions.

HONORING ROBERT ELROY JONES, 
JR. 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Robert Elroy 
Jones, Jr. who entered this world on Novem-
ber 14, 1971 to proud parents, Dezie Woods- 
Jones and Robert (Bones) Jones, Sr. He was 
called to his heavenly home through a circle of 
love on May 20, 2022. 
Mr. Jones was born in Berkeley, California, 
and later moved to Oakland, California and at-
tended Oakland schools, until returning to 
Berkeley to graduate from high school. He at-
tended Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, 
Georgia for three years and finished his Bach-
elor of Science degree from Arizona State 
University. 
He lived and worked in Surprise, Arizona for 
several years after graduation and was 
blessed to have two wonderful children by his 
wife at the time, Kimberley Sorensen Jones. 
He loved and adored his children, Amani 
Sorensen Jones and Isaiah ‘‘Z’’ Jones. 
Robert Jones, Jr. also loved his church fam-
ilies and was active in the Allen Temple Youth 
Department. He was baptized in 1985 at Allen 
Temple Baptist Church and throughout his life-
time attended St. Paul AME Church in Fowler, 
California; Carter Memorial AME Church in 
Fresno, California; and St. Paul AME Church 
in Pixley under the pastoral leadership of his 
stepfather, the Reverend Carl L. Jones. 
In addition to Robert’s love for his family 
and the church, was his love for the commu-
nity. He was a coach and athletic trainer and 
led his teams to win several championships. 
He himself won outstanding coaching awards 
during his career. 
He was passionate about social issues rel-
ative to education, particularly when it came to 
the lack of support for teachers. Robert was 
an advocate for the undeserved and those im-
pacted by various social determinants of 
health, like the homeless and those with lim-
ited access to healthcare. Thanks to his moth-
er, Robert had an early commitment to public 
service and was named the youngest ever Jr. 
BWOPA Man of the Year by the Board, in ad-
dition to having the opportunity to work for the 
2004 National Democratic Convention in Bos-
ton, Massachusetts. 
Robert was both an advocate and a fighter, 
whether through his diagnosis at the age of 
eleven, with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s 
Disease or his daily perseverance through the 
pain caused by them, while being sure to 
never complain to others. 
My deepest condolences and prayers go to 
his family, friends and loved ones and my 
greatest respect and empathy go to my dear 
friend, his mother, Dezie Woods-Jones. I re-
member Robby as a child and always mar-
veled at his maturity and sense of purpose. I 
know that his impact and commitment to the 
community will continue to be an example to 
us all. 
On behalf of the 13th Congressional District 
of California, we remember with love and ad-
miration, Robert Elroy Jones, Jr., for his tire-
less service and dedication to the community 
throughout his lifetime. May he rest in peace 
and power.

DAN MCCASKY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Police Chief Dan McCasky 
from the City of Lakewood, Colo. for his dec-
ades of service to our community. 
After thirty-eight years of service to our 
community and the great State of Colorado, 
Chief McCasky has shown constant leadership 
and dedication to his profession, the depart-
ment’s employees, and the broader commu-
nity. Chief McCasky has excelled in this role 
and is a prime example of a true public serv-
ant who has dedicated their life to putting oth-
ers wellbeing before his own. I am especially 
grateful for Chief McCasky’s work during the 
COVID–19 pandemic as well as the develop-
ment of the Community Action Team to pro-
vide services to the homeless community in 
our district. 
Throughout Chief McCasky’s career as Po-
lice Chief he always maintained the best inter-
est for Lakewood and its residents and has 
made great strides in improving the safety and 
quality of life for our community. I am incred-
ibly thankful for Chief McCasky’s commitment 
to the City of Lakewood and the State of Colo-
rado. His leadership will be missed, and I wish 
him all the best in retirement.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
TRAIN 
NOISE AND VIBRATIONS REDUC-
TION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Train Noise and Vibrations Reduc-
tion Act, which would direct the Secretary of 
Transportation to submit a report to Congress 
containing recommendations on how to reduce 
train noise and vibrations near homes, as well 
as estimates of the costs and benefits of each 
recommendation. 
Such 
recommendations 
would include modifications to trains, tracks 
and maintenance procedures, speed limits for 
trains, mitigation measures between tracks 
and homes, the distance between tracks and 
homes, limitations on the number of trains and 
the number of cars on trains, limitations on 
hours of operations, building insulation and 
modifications to soil conditions. The report 
would be due to Congress no later than one 
year after the enactment of the bill. 
The Noise Control Act of 1972 created the 
Office of Noise Abatement and Control within 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
granting EPA authority and oversight over 
broad noise control regulations. However, 
years of defunding left this office without any 
resources to conduct enforcement, forcing 
EPA to phase out the office in 1982. I hear 
from District of Columbia residents frequently 
about the negative impact of train noise and 
vibrations on their lives. The noise and vibra-
tions can harm health and quality of life, and 
can even harm the structural integrity of 
homes. Congress and the executive branch 
must do more to reduce the harm nationwide. 
As a senior member of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and as the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Highways and 
Transit, I have been committed to reducing 
transportation noise pollution. I have convened 
community meetings with the Federal Railroad 
Administration, the D.C. Department of Trans-
portation and the Federal Highway Administra-
tion to examine how to reduce train noise and 
vibrations. A report on reducing train noise 
and vibrations can help us identify viable, 
long-term solutions for communities.

HONORING THE CITY OF NAPA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of 
Napa in celebration of the city’s 150th anniver-
sary of its incorporation and its 175th anniver-
sary of the town’s founding. 
The City of Napa was founded in 1847 by 
Nathan Combs and Nicolas Higuera. On 
March 23, 1872, the settlement was first incor-
porated as the town of Napa. Two years later, 
it was reincorporated as the City of Napa. 
The city originated as an important freight 
and trading post, and it began to flourish after 
the arrival of river ferries on the Napa River 
and the Napa County Railroad in 1860. Al-
though its early history is comprised of hos-
tility, intolerance and discrimination, today, the 
City of Napa prides itself as a multi-cultural 
hub for families of diverse backgrounds, in-
cluding indigenous peoples; Californians of 
Spanish descent, Chinese immigrants, and 
more. 
The City of Napa has a population of just 
under 80,000. Much of Napa’s growth and 
prosperity can be attributed to its industrial 
businesses, including the famous Sawyer Tan-
nery; founded in 1869, the Basalt Rock Com-
pany; founded around 1920, and Kaiser Steel; 
founded around 1940. As the heart of Napa 
County, the City of Napa has over 500 dedi-
cated employees who provide a variety of mu-
nicipal services, including police, fire, utilities, 
public works, and parks and recreation. 
Every year the city attracts approximately 
3.85 million visitors who experience Napa’s 
internationally renowned food and wine cul-
ture. Both tourists and residents attend annual 
events hosted by the City of Napa, including, 
but not limited to, the Napa Lighted Art Fes-
tival, BottleRock Music Festival, and the an-
nual 4th of July Celebration. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that the City 
of Napa is home to a culturally rich, diverse, 
and vibrant community. Therefore, it is fitting 
and proper that we honor the city and its resi-
dents here today.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
LEGISLATION 
TO RECOGNIZE THE RELIGIOUS 
SIGNIFICANCE OF EID AL-ADHA 
AND WISHING MUSLIM AMERI-
CANS 
AND 
MUSLIMS 
AROUND 
THE 
WORLD 
A 
PROSPEROUS 
HOLIDAY 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 12, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am proud, 
as the longest serving Muslim in Congress, to 
introduce legislation to recognize Eid al-Adha 
and wish Muslims around the world an Eid 
Mubarak. 
I am honored to partner with my colleague, 
Rep. DEBBIE DINGELL to introduce this resolu-
tion in the House of Representatives to recog-
nize Eid al-Adha. Eid al-Adha is of great im-
portance to Muslim Americans and 1.8 million 
Muslims globally. This resolution helps high-
light the significance of this Islamic holiday 
and to recognize the contributions of Muslims 
across the world. American Muslims are part 
of every industry and space in the United 
States since the founding of our country. 
Eid 
al-Adha 
commemorates 
Abraham’s 
symbolic sacrifice of his son to God, as ref-
erenced in the Quran, Old Testament, and 
New Testament. The holiday is a three-day 
celebration filled with prayers, charity, and the 
annual pilgrimage, for those who are able. I 
congratulate the 1 million Muslims that partici-
pated in the annual pilgrimage, Hajj, this year. 
May God bless them, always. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing the religious signifi-
cance of Eid al-Adha and wishing Muslim 
Americans and Muslims around the world a 
prosperous holiday by signing on to this im-
portant legislation.
