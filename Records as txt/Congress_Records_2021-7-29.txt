Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 29, 2021 
No. 133 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 29, 2021 
I hereby appoint the Honorable KATHERINE 
M. CLARK to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
INFLATION IS A TAX ON 
EVERYONE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
across my district, Michigan families 
are having to pay more for gas, for gro-
ceries, for cars. 
You name it, there is sticker shock 
everywhere you look. In fact, inflation 
attacks on everyone increased every 
month since President Biden took of-
fice. 
As Americans are struggling to pay 
for skyrocketing costs of daily neces-
sities, we should be doing something to 
address these pocketbook challenges. 
Instead, this week, we are considering 
another round of massive spending bills 
that will make matters worse on top of 
massive spending bills that we have al-
ready expended. 
Unparalleled and unchecked govern-
ment spending is not the solution. It is 
a root cause of rising inflation—and did 
I mention that is a tax on everyone? 
Again, this reckless spending and 
subsequent inflation are effectively at-
tacks on the American people, their 
families, their workplaces, and, in fact, 
their livelihoods. We can’t afford to 
continue down this path. It is hurting 
too many families and their financial 
security. 
It is time we return to proven eco-
nomic policies that create jobs, in-
crease wages, and do not prolong an in-
flationary crisis that—did I mention?— 
is a tax on everyone. 
f 
RECOGNIZING GENOCIDE OF 
ASSYRIANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from California (Mr. HARD-
ER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HARDER OF California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to ask if this 
body cares more about the hurt feel-
ings of a dictator than the legacy of 
300,000 innocent men, women, and chil-
dren murdered in the only place they 
had ever called home. 
In 1914, the Ottoman Empire slaugh-
tered more than 300,000 innocent Assyr-
ians. Yet, 108 years later, this body has 
still not recognized that slaughter for 
what it was—a genocide. 
Growing up in the Central Valley, I 
was surrounded by our Assyrian com-
munity. I ate handmade dolmas with 
my Assyrian neighbor, Nana Bitpera, 
who was like a grandmother to me. She 
told me about the contributions of the 
Assyrian community to the modern 
world and explained the weight that 
her people have carried since that bru-
tal massacre in 1914. 
Madam Speaker, that is why, today, 
I am leading a resolution to finally rec-
ognize the genocide of the Assyrians in 
the Middle East. My resolution com-
memorates August 7, Shova b’tabakh, 
as Assyrian Genocide Memorial Day. It 
asserts that Turkey, the inheritor of 
the Ottoman tradition, must recognize 
the genocide. It recognizes the resil-
ience of the Assyrian people, who, after 
they taught the world how to build cit-
ies, how to domesticate crops, endured 
the cruelest kind of event history can 
provide only to spread out across our 
globe and keep their traditions alive 
today. 
This body should stand for the right 
of all people to live freely and in safe-
ty, and that starts by recognizing the 
history and perseverance of the Assyr-
ian people. 
Madam Speaker, today, I urge our 
House leadership to bring this resolu-
tion directly to the floor. Anything 
else is unacceptable. 
f 
OBSTRUCTING DHS AT BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, our Nation is facing a secu-
rity crisis on our southern border. 
As a record number of migrants are 
apprehended on American soil, we have 
seen a staggering increase in the 
amount of fentanyl that is being con-
fiscated not only at ports of entry but 
also in the desert. So far this year, 
there have been over 1 million illegal 
crossings along our southern border. 
Right now, liberals in Congress are 
attempting to obstruct the Department 
of Homeland Security from working to 
keep Americans safe. How many Amer-
icans have to be poisoned by fentanyl

before we stop the flow into our com-
munities? 
In Pennsylvania, over 5,000 people 
lost their lives in drug overdoses last 
year. We have seen fentanyl is easy to 
get, and it is fast to kill. We must put 
an end to the crisis and refuse any at-
tempt to stop the Department of 
Homeland Security from enforcing our 
laws and ending this crisis on our 
southern border. 
f 
HONORING MARGIE RICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LOWENTHAL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in honor of the Honorable Margie 
Rice, former mayor, council member, 
and community leader of Westminster, 
California, who passed away this past 
Sunday, July 25, 2021, at the age of 92. 
Margie had dedicated her entire life 
to public service, including 22 years on 
the Westminster City Council, with 12 
of those years as the city’s elected 
mayor. She also served as a West-
minster School District trustee for 17 
years. 
Up until her passing, Margie served 
on the Midway City Sanitation Dis-
trict, ending her 30 years of service on 
that board this past Sunday. Madam 
Speaker, in 2019, I was honored to join 
Margie and other board members in 
celebrating the 80th anniversary of the 
Midway City Sanitation District. 
As an active community leader and a 
public servant, Margie Rice was pas-
sionate, 
dedicated, 
focused, 
hard-
working, and, above all, outspoken. 
Margie achieved many results for the 
residents of Westminster and among 
her legacy is the building of the West-
minster Rose Center Theater, a per-
forming arts center for the whole com-
munity to enjoy. 
Margie was born in Alabama, but she 
called Westminster her home for more 
than 60 years. She is survived by two of 
her four children, 19 grandchildren, 23 
great-grandchildren, 
and 
12 
great- 
great-grandchildren. 
I will always remember Margie Rice 
as a pioneer and a leader who loved and 
cared for the Westminster community 
with all her heart. 
She will be missed. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S SURGING 
CRIME CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, crime 
is up across the country. 
Cities that defunded their police are 
now facing the consequences. Police 
chiefs have gone on national TV to lit-
erally beg for more support and assist-
ance. What started as a far-left polit-
ical slogan ended up impacting real- 
world policy in numerous Democrat- 
run cities. 
Now, crime is surging across Amer-
ica. Just the other day, there was a 
brazen shootout a mile away from the 
White House. 
The facts and the numbers do not lie. 
This is President Biden’s crime crisis. 
Rather than face the radical ele-
ments of their own party, the Demo-
crats are deflecting responsibility. 
Defunding the police means less law 
enforcement officers on the streets, 
less crimes getting solved, and less 
criminals getting arrested. The only 
people who benefit from defunded po-
lice are the criminals themselves. 
We are a nation of laws and law and 
order. We owe it to the American peo-
ple to do what we can to keep them 
safe, even if the Biden administration 
won’t. 
f 
HONORING JOHNNY VENTURA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
the life and work of the most promi-
nent merengue artist in the world who, 
sadly, passed away yesterday, the great 
Johnny Ventura. 
Johnny Ventura started his career in 
the 1960s with his Johnny Ventura El 
Combo Show. His career quickly flour-
ished both nationally and internation-
ally with his contagious music. 
He also embarked on a life of public 
service as the mayor in Santo Domingo 
and a member of the Congress of the 
Dominican Republic. 
Just last February, we honored him 
here in Washington, D.C., as part of the 
yearly event, Dominicans on the Hill. 
He prided himself in being the am-
bassador of merengue and, as such, of 
the Caribbean and the world. 
We will always remember him for his 
contagious songs, including ‘‘I am the 
Merengue,’’ ‘‘If I am born again,’’ ‘‘To-
bacco,’’ and ‘‘Patacon Pisao’’; ‘‘Yo soy 
el Merengue,’’ ‘‘Si vuelvo a nacer,’’ ‘‘El 
tabaco,’’ y ‘‘Patacon Pisao.’’ 
(English translation of the lyrics spo-
ken in Spanish is as follows:) 
The sound of the bass drum stops today 
The sound of the saxophone rests 
The guira also rests today. 
El sonido de la tambora para hoy 
El sonido del saxofon descansa 
La guira tambien descansa hoy. 
We will always remember him for his 
great service to people, and for his 
music and dedication to music. He will 
always 
be 
present 
in 
our 
hearts 
through his songs that often were 
funny and sometimes melancholic as 
he sang to the diaspora. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, folks 
from all over the world find themselves 
in an economic exile and, at times, 
think of the family they left behind. 
They think of the wonderful beaches, 
rivers, and mountains that they left 
behind, and they could only claim that 
feeling through songs like the songs 
that Johnny Ventura often played for 
all of us. 
He had a contagious smile and a won-
derful rhythm of music with African 
bass instruments. 
Adios, Johnny Ventura. 
Good-bye, ‘‘Merengue Artist to the 
Bass Drum’’; adios, ‘‘Merenguero Hasta 
la Tambora.’’ 
Good-bye, 
‘‘Oldest 
Horse’’; 
adios, 
‘‘Caballo Mayor.’’ 
f 
WORSENING FENTANYL CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to talk about a recent trip 
to McAllen, Texas, where I had the op-
portunity to tour the southern border. 
What stuck out to me most was hear-
ing from border agents about the sheer 
volume of fentanyl that is being seized 
right now. 
In fact, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection reported that 1,053 pounds 
of fentanyl was seized at the southwest 
border in June alone. That is more 
than the last three Junes combined. 
b 1015 
Following my trip, I introduced an 
amendment at a Judiciary Committee 
markup to ensure that penalties are 
maintained for criminals convicted of 
fentanyl possession. This amendment 
should have been a slam dunk, but it 
was not adopted. 
I question or challenge my colleagues 
who voted against this. We must find a 
way of stopping the flow of fentanyl. 
However, I suspect because most do not 
want to confront this issue at the bor-
der, that they are not going to address 
this issue. 
In the absence of action, there is 
going to be no winners on this issue, 
only families who continue to grapple 
with the consequences firsthand. 
f 
SPENDING BILL WITHOUT THE 
HYDE AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the appropriations package we 
will pass this week because this docu-
ment respects the dignity and human-
ity of women in this country and 
around the world. 
For the first time in over 40 years, 
the Appropriations Committee passed a 
spending bill without the Hyde amend-
ment. For decades, the Hyde amend-
ment has prevented women of color and 
low-income people from receiving basic 
healthcare. Hyde forces one in four 
women under Medicaid to carry a preg-
nancy to term. 
Twenty percent of the women in this 
country rely on Medicaid, including 
half of all American people living 
below the Federal poverty line, and 
millions of women of color. Yet, they 
are denied their constitutional right to 
healthcare, including an abortion. 
This is discrimination. The legal 
right to an abortion is meaningless if

you are unable to afford one. Abortion 
is healthcare. The legal right to an 
abortion is based on access, and that 
should not be denied based on your in-
come or insurance coverage. 
Budgets are documents that rep-
resent our values, and that is why I am 
so proud to put forward a spending 
package that rejects Hyde, and also 
provides a directive to the VA to im-
plement a comprehensive sexual as-
sault and harassment policy, $1.2 bil-
lion for maternal and child health, a 
repeal of the restrictive Helms amend-
ment and global and domestic gag 
rules, and so much more. 
This is a good day for women here 
and around the globe. I thank Chair 
DELAURO and I thank the millions of 
activists who fought to make this mo-
ment a reality. We will continue our 
march for equity shoulder to shoulder 
with you. 
f 
CELEBRATING KANSAS COUNTY 
FAIRS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate one of my favorite 
times of the year, county fair season in 
Kansas. This summer, all 63 counties in 
the big First District will host at least 
one county fair, featuring FFA and 4–H 
livestock shows, rodeos, demolition 
derbies, science demonstrations, fair 
food, and most importantly, people 
coming together to celebrate their 
communities. 
County fairs are special because each 
one is unique to that county. Some 
county fairs rally volunteers to build 
barns for farmers in need, some hold 
premium livestock auctions for 4–H 
and FFA members, driving economic 
opportunity for those students and 
their futures. 
Other fairs serve the world’s most fa-
mous root beer floats or host family 
fun nights where young and old partici-
pate in sack races and play horseshoes. 
County fairs teach hard work, respect, 
and humility. They are emblematic of 
conservative values, and it is certainly 
where I learned them as a child. 
Growing up in Quinter, Kansas, I at-
tended the Gove County Fair every 
year with my family. I still remember 
the excitement we all had when our 
hard work culminated and my siblings 
and I entered our 4–H projects for re-
view. Those summers taught us lessons 
we still use today. Last weekend, I 
found myself reliving the childhood ex-
citement with my son, Austin, at the 
Riley and Wabaunsee County Fairs. 
At the Riley County Fair, 4–H mem-
bers Peyton and Genayla, showed us 
their market steers and purple ribbon 
show pigs. The joy and satisfaction of 
accomplishment on their faces was 
proof that county fairs serve a critical 
role in the lives of our youth. 
At the Wabaunsee County Fair, I met 
with Alex Gnadt and the county fair 
board. We toured their brand new live-
stock facility, constructed by volun-
teers with donations from county agri-
culture businesses. Communities rally 
to support county fairs because they 
know the substantial impact they have 
on the entire community. 
I plan to visit several more county 
fairs this summer, and I am grateful 
for communities who prioritize these 
time-honored traditions. If you attend 
a Big First county fair, you will see 
Kansas conservative values on full dis-
play: hard work, responsibility, gen-
erous giving, and positive attitudes. 
You will see strong communities, 
strong leaders, and you will see a 
bright future. I am proud to be a prod-
uct of the county fair, and I look for-
ward to celebrating them for years to 
come. 
BLOATEDBUS LEGISLATION 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the partisan appro-
priations bill House Democrats are 
forcing through Congress this week. 
With a 50/50 split in the Senate, and a 
margin of just a few votes separating 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
House, American voters clearly want 
Congress to work together to produce a 
bipartisan spending plan. In response, 
Democrats have ignored the American 
people and produced one of the most 
partisan budgets in history. Their 
bloatedbus contains nearly $600 billion, 
a funding increase of more than 21 per-
cent from the last fiscal year. 
This bill is a progressive wish list. It 
boosts funding for the White House by 
nearly 40 percent and the Vice Presi-
dent’s office by 22 percent. It rewards 
the most liberal agencies like the EPA 
and IRS, with massive budget in-
creases, only furthering their presence 
in our lives. It contains more than 1,500 
earmarks, returning us to the corrupt 
practice of pork barrel spending. 
It contains harmful regulations to 
Kansas farmers and ranchers by no 
longer 
exempting 
producers 
from 
greenhouse gas reporting requirements 
and reverting to old regulations that 
decrease meat processing capacity, fur-
ther suppressing the price of live cat-
tle. 
The worst part of H.R. 4502, however, 
is the absence of the Hyde amendment, 
a traditionally bipartisan provision 
protecting taxpayers from forced finan-
cial complicity in elective abortions. 
In the bloatedbus, Democrats pur-
posely omitted the Hyde amendment, 
and instead took the opportunity to 
voice their support for radical abortion 
policies. 
I cannot support legislation that 
mortgages the future of our children 
and grandchildren. I oppose H.R. 4502, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
RECOGNIZING KATHERINE THOMAS 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, lastly, I 
rise today to recognize and thank 
Katherine Thomas for her tireless and 
selfless work for all Kansans. 
In the last 8 years, Katherine has 
championed Kansas farmers and ranch-
ers in the Halls of Congress, working 
on food and agricultural issues for sev-
eral Members of the Kansas congres-
sional delegation. 
In 2018, Katherine helped usher the 
farm bill to completion under the di-
rection of Senator PAT ROBERTS, then 
Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. 
Most recently, knowing how important 
agriculture 
was 
to 
me, 
Katherine 
helped establish my new congressional 
office and prioritize farmers and ranch-
ers in the big First Congressional Dis-
trict. 
I am proud to have had Katherine on 
my team, and I wish her the best of 
luck in her next adventure back in the 
Senate. Thank you, Katherine. 
f 
LEGISLATION TO INVEST IN 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, this 
week we are considering critical legis-
lation to invest in America and Min-
nesotans. 
We 
are 
investing 
in 
childcare, education, healthcare, hous-
ing, and so many other basics that my 
district so desperately needs. 
In the Fifth District alone, we se-
cured over $46 million in transpor-
tation and community project funding. 
That includes the skills training for 
clean energy careers, funding for up-
dated 
sprinkler 
systems, 
a 
new 
healthcare clinic on Lake Street, a new 
park in Brooklyn Center, and so much 
more. 
How we choose to invest our re-
sources is a reflection of our priorities, 
and we, as House Democrats, are mak-
ing our priorities clear: American jobs, 
opportunity, and working families. 
f 
BLOATEDBUS SPENDING BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition today to the bloatedbus 
spending bill that is being jammed 
through the House this week by the 
majority. 
Instead of working to craft bipar-
tisan legislation, Democrats have put 
forward appropriations bills that are 
based on unrealistic and irresponsible 
spending levels and include partisan 
policy provisions that will only delay 
its final passage. 
Further, rather than holding a vote 
on each individual appropriations bill, 
the Speaker has lumped together seven 
separate spending bills that include 
nearly $600 billion in discretionary 
spending, a 21 percent increase over 
just last year. 
Twenty-one percent. That is almost 
as high as some of the price increases 
families in my district are seeing in 
their daily lives, thanks to the flood of 
deficit spending President Biden and 
Speaker PELOSI have forced through 
this Congress already.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4256 
July 29, 2021 
This is not how the legislative proc-
ess should work. And with inflation 
rates at a 13-year high, Madam Speak-
er, we simply cannot afford it. 
And while this bill provides unprece-
dented increases for Democrats’ domes-
tic spending priorities, the left has de-
cided to underfund two appropriations 
bills that are required by the Constitu-
tion: Homeland Security and National 
Defense. Worse yet, it reverses decades 
of historically bipartisan pro-life poli-
cies like the Hyde and Weldon amend-
ments which have been bipartisan since 
1976. 
Further, it increases our dependence 
on China. It fails to keep us safe by 
hindering the work of Customs and 
Border Protection, and it abandons an 
all-of-the-above energy strategy. This 
is truly unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, this minibus needs 
to be sent back to the scrap yard, and 
if not, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
HONORING CHIEF JOE SIMMONS 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 30-year ca-
reer of one of Virginia’s finest, Bridge-
water Police Chief Joe Simmons. 
Interestingly, this law enforcement 
veteran originally had aspirations of 
being a firefighter, but after being a 
dispatcher, jailer, and then a road dep-
uty in the Rockingham County Sher-
iff’s office, the SWAT team recruited 
him in 1996. By 1997, he joined the elite 
RUSH Drug Task Force, a mix of local 
and State officers, who I was proud to 
work with as an assistant Common-
wealth’s attorney, as well as Federal 
drug agents. 
Simmons brought all this experience 
to the town of Bridgewater in the late 
1990s, eventually rising to chief in 2011. 
Mayor Ted Flory said of Simmons: 
‘‘He’s done an amazing job. . . . The 
model of community policing . . . 
serves the citizens very well.’’ 
Chief Simmons says most police offi-
cers are good people who care about 
the citizens in their community. ‘‘You 
have to have empathy. It’s not us 
against them,’’ Simmons said, ‘‘You 
have to police with an open mind. It’s 
customer service.’’ 
In the end, while Simmons never be-
came the firefighter he once wanted to 
be, he had a successful career in public 
service, risking his life to protect and 
serve his fellow citizens. 
I thank Chief Simmons for his serv-
ice. 
f 
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
since day one in Congress, bringing 
Federal resources to help the 14th Dis-
trict of Illinois thrive has been one of 
my top priorities. 
As a new member of the House Ap-
propriations Committee, I am so proud 
of how much we have accomplished in 
just 7 short months. Just last week, I 
was pleased to announce that over $10.5 
million in Federal funding for commu-
nity projects was included in the 
House’s appropriations legislation. 
These projects will improve the qual-
ity of life and economic opportunity in 
northern Illinois. In Joliet, Pingree 
Grove, and Richmond the resources 
will improve water infrastructure to 
give each community a reliable water 
source for years to come. 
In McHenry, the resources will help 
expand access to higher education 
through 
dual 
credit 
programs 
at 
McHenry County College. 
In Kendall County, the resources will 
help foster youth and their advocates 
by developing a permanent advocacy 
office for CASA of Kendall County. 
These investments are critical, and I 
will continue to work with my col-
leagues in Congress until these re-
sources are seen and felt in our com-
munity. 
f 
HONORING PETE ROBINSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor my 
friend, Pete Robinson, of Columbus, 
Georgia, who passed away on July 1 at 
the age of 66. 
Pete graduated from Emory Univer-
sity and Mercer University School of 
Law. Following graduation, he began 
his career in public service and com-
mitment to improving his community. 
For a decade, beginning in 1985, Pete 
served in the Georgia General Assem-
bly in the House of Representatives 
and Senate. 
In the Georgia Senate, he served as 
Governor Zell Miller’s floor leader for 2 
years and became the only president 
pro tem to be nominated by both Re-
publican and Democratic leaders. 
Pete’s decades of leadership in his 
community and the Georgia General 
Assembly played a significant role in 
making Georgia a better place for all 
who call it home, myself included. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact he had in Georgia, and I know his 
legacy will remain. My thoughts and 
prayers are with his family, friends, 
and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time.

HONORING JESSE CREWS OF CHARLTON COUNTY 
SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Jesse Crews of Folkston, Geor-
gia, for his outstanding career with the 
Charlton County school system. 
Jesse has dedicated his life to men-
toring and inspiring the young minds 
of Charlton County. He joined the 
Charlton County school system in 1975 
as an educator and coach. Over the 
past 46 years, Jesse has touched and in-
spired many lives in the Charlton 
County community. He has earned nu-
merous awards and honors for his 36 
years of service as a basketball coach, 
including being named the Region 2A 
Athletic Director of the Year and the 
Class A Athletic Director of the Year. 
Jesse has consistently devoted count-
less hours of his time, talents, and en-
ergy towards the betterment of his 
community. He has dedicated his life 
to educating and mentoring our future 
generation. I thank him for his years of 
service, and I wish him a happy retire-
ment. His irreplaceable presence will 
be missed by all. 
HONORING VICKIE HUDSON ON HER 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Vickie Hudson of Savannah, 
Georgia, for her 100th birthday on Au-
gust 2. 
Vickie graduated from Girard High 
School in 1938. Following graduation, 
she moved to Savannah and has been a 
pillar 
of 
the 
community. 
Vickie 
worked in the accounting department 
at Memorial Hospital in Savannah for 
27 years. During her career in Savan-
nah, she served many offices, including 
president of the Azalea Chapter of the 
American Business Women’s Associa-
tion where she was elected Woman of 
the Year in 1970. 
Vickie was instrumental in forming 
the Savannah Independent Automobile 
Dealers Association Ladies Auxiliary 
and was elected as their first president. 
Above all, she devoted 50 years of 
membership and leadership to the Wes-
ley Oak Methodist Church. Everyone 
who knows Vickie recognizes her giv-
ing heart and love for her community. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise 
today to recognize Vicky’s 100th birth-
day and her lifetime of service, wis-
dom, and love. 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING JAMES ‘‘JIMMY’’ 
D. CROSBY, JR. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor former 
Garden City Fire Chief, Jimmy Crosby, 
Jr., of Garden City, Georgia, who 
passed away on July 5 at the age of 72. 
Service to his community was an in-
tegral part of Jimmy’s character. In 
addition to his almost five decades of 
service with the Garden City Fire De-
partment, he also worked as a police 
officer and paramedic. Under his lead-
ership as fire chief, Jimmy modernized 
Garden City’s fire department to im-
prove his beloved community. 
His kindness and selflessness ex-
tended to every part of his life, includ-
ing his time with Good Shepherd Lu-
theran Church where he served on the 
church council and was chairman of 
the property committee. 
Everyone who knew Jimmy recog-
nized his giving heart and love for his 
community. I am thankful for the im-
mense impact Jimmy had on the Gar-
den City community, and I know his 
legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

WORLD CIVILITY DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Chuck Hughes, 
executive director of the Gary Chamber 
of Commerce; and Dr. Gordon Brad-
shaw, chairman of the public policy 
committee, for establishing the World 
Civility Day which was celebrated ear-
lier this month on July 8. 
In 2015, Mr. Hughes and Dr. Bradshaw 
created the Community Civility Counts 
initiative with the Gary Chamber of 
Commerce and established the World 
Civility Day in order to encourage all 
individuals to be more mindful of our 
actions and to bring more under-
standing, more tolerance, and more lis-
tening and empathy into our society. 
I became a public servant in order to 
bring people together and solve prob-
lems, and that only happens when we 
treat each other with respect and civil-
ity. 
I commend Mr. Hughes, Dr. Brad-
shaw, and all of the individuals and or-
ganizations engaged in this initiative 
for their leadership to recognize the 
timely and worthy goals of World Civil-
ity Day.

BIDEN’S CRIME CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to bring attention 
to the alarming spike in crime hap-
pening across major cities in our Na-
tion. 
Right now American families are 
being forced to face an explosion of vio-
lent crime in their streets and in their 
neighborhoods. After the riots of the 
past year which saw the destruction of 
both public and private property, and 
as we undergo one of the worst crime 
waves in modern history, citizens are 
deservedly concerned about their safe-
ty and well-being. 
One of the essential functions of our 
government is to provide security to 
all citizens. Yet the Biden administra-
tion, after months of refusing to ac-
knowledge the crime wave, finally ad-
dressed it by claiming that crime is 
down. That misleading claim couldn’t 
be further from the truth. Crime is ac-
tually skyrocketing, and it is plaguing 
cities across the Nation. 
Homicides are up 533 percent—yes, 
533 percent—in Portland, 50 percent in 
Minneapolis, 35 percent in Philadel-
phia, and 24 percent in Los Angeles 
compared to the same time in 2020. 
On top of that, ambush-style attacks 
on police officers this year have in-
creased 91 percent compared to this 
time last year. When Democrats defund 
the police, lawlessness is guaranteed to 
follow, complete with more crimes of 
all kinds, including murder. Left un-
checked, such lawlessness will eventu-
ally destroy our Republic. 
So how did a nation of law and order 
become a nation of lawlessness and 
chaos in such a short period of time? 
Make no mistake, the socialist agen-
da of President Biden and far-left 
Democrats in Congress is to blame. 
Radical policies like defunding the po-
lice, abolishing prisons, and elimi-
nating cash bail have contributed to 
the surging crime wave. 
We cannot tolerate vandalism or vio-
lence, and we surely cannot normalize 
a culture of violence by failing to fully 
prosecute those who are working to 
dismantle our cities. Tennesseans can-
not bear much more of Biden’s crime 
crisis. The solution to countering the 
crime wave is clear: we must fund and 
support our law enforcement agencies 
across the country. 
f 
WORLD CIVILITY DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
his reminding us of the World Civility 
Day and its importance. I rise today in 
the spirit of civility, facts, and bring-
ing people together. 
First of all, we are all saddened by 
the surge of crime across America, and 
we are working with our communities, 
those who intervene, and those who are 
responding to the issues of depredation 
and danger that permeates many of our 
communities and many of our young 
people. 
I believe it is important to ensure 
that the excessive amount of guns that 
are trafficked illegally are taken off 
the street. Soon in my community we 
will hold a gun buyback with the Hous-
ton Police Department because they 
are working with the community. 
So I think it is important to state 
the fact that the Obama administra-
tion, President Joe Biden, and Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS are strong 
advocates and have invested much to 
ensure that crime goes down. We know 
that it is a mixture of the toxicity of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, poverty, and, 
of course, those who are inclined to do 
the crime. 
With that in mind, it is very impor-
tant to factually make the point that 
there is nothing in the Biden adminis-
tration’s agenda or its funding pack-
ages or those of Democrats that deal 
with the defunding of police. We are re-
imagining and working with our com-
munities collectively. As we say: Po-
lice community relations will improve 
and continue to improve, one, the find-
ing of those who perpetrate the crime 
for them to be brought to justice fairly 
because crime does not look to the 
color of one’s skin. It is without dis-
crimination and hits all of America. 
So I am very proud to have been an 
original cosponsor and lead on the Vic-
tims of Crime Act that was signed by 
the President last week that ensured 
that our communities will now have a 
victims fund that our States will be 
able to deal with. 
I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to go home and inter-
act with the victims of crime. Show 
them that you care and work with your 
communities so that they are com-
pensated in the full. 
Let me also indicate that it is appro-
priate for us to move on H.R. 40. An 
enormity of Members of Congress have 
sponsored the commission to study 
slavery and develop reparation pro-
posals. In civility, this would give us 
an opportunity to have a first federal 
conversation on race for a full discus-
sion and analysis of the economy, po-
litical, psychological, scientific, and 
sociological effects of slavery in the 
United States. 
The legislation makes no judgment 
on how to respond to the slavery of Af-
rican Americans that began its sinful 
roots 401 years ago, but it points us to 
developing a response and a repair to 
deal with what is a continuing stigma 
of institutional racism. Mr. Speaker, 
you cannot ignore the disparities that 
exist in the community, and we cannot 
ignore the opportunity to have that 
discussion. 
I am very grateful for the wide vari-
ety of individuals from the East, the 
West, the North, and the South of vary-
ing political perspectives who have 
supported this, the religious organiza-
tions that have supported this, the so-
cial justice organizations, or just plain 
people who raise their voices—57 per-
cent in a recent poll. 
So let us look forward to repairing, 
being a repair, the repairers. We know 
that our beloved pastor and leader who 
has provided us with the words that he 
is the repairer of the breach, and we 
thank him for that. And we thank all 
those who are willing to have a civil 
discussion to ensure that we can end 
the surge of crime and the scourge of 
crime and as well be able to discuss 
race in a manner of civility in a way 
that we can come together and repair 
it. 
I know that it is the intent of those 
who cosponsored the bill and all of the 
vast supporters across America. It is 
certainly my intent as the lead cospon-
sor after the Honorable John Conyers, 
and I know it is the intent of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and all those 
who raise their voices for a civil discus-
sion on the question of race. I think 
America is that good and better than 
that to be able to say that we can have 
that civil discussion. As has been said 
in our meetings of the Congressional 
Black Caucus: our power and our mes-
sage.

the devastating drought affecting Utah 
this year. 
Ninety percent of the West is experi-
encing extreme drought conditions. 
This includes every county in the great 
State of Utah—already one of the dri-
est States in the Union. 
Drought impacts lives and liveli-
hoods. One of the Juab County farmers 
in my district runs a farm that has 
been in his family for three genera-
tions. This year, his farm has yielded 
zero output because of the drought. Un-
fortunately, his story is not unique. 
Aquifers are not recharging, springs 
are dry, wells are pumping harder than 
ever before, and farmers are facing in-
creased power costs. This means fewer 
crops and fewer dollars in the pockets 
of our rural farmers. On top of that, 
Utah’s drought conditions make dev-
astating wildfires more likely and 
harder to fight. 
Each one of us has an important role 
to play in conserving resources and 
adapting for the near future and be-
yond. Utahn livelihoods and genera-
tional family farms are at stake, and I 
stand ready to assist local leaders and 
our State’s Federal delegation to en-
sure the safety and prosperity of every 
Utahn. 
I call upon the Biden administration 
to step up their efforts on the inter-
agency working group that is supposed 
to be addressing these severe condi-
tions.

RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE 
SUE MYRICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to recog-
nize former U.S. Representative Sue 
Myrick who has a landmark birthday 
this Sunday. 
Congresswoman Myrick served the 
people of North Carolina’s Ninth Con-
gressional District from 1995 to 2013. 
Before that, Sue made history in 1987 
when she scored a major upset against 
a two-term Democrat to become the 
first female mayor of Charlotte. Impor-
tantly, before politics, Sue was known 
for her faith life as a Sunday school 
teacher and private sector career as an 
advertising executive. 
In Congress for the Ninth District, 
Sue was a notable and effective con-
servative 
chairing 
the 
Republican 
Study Committee. Protecting America 
from foreign threats and securing our 
border defined her congressional ca-
reer. As important, she was and is kind 
and caring, and she provided legendary 
constituent service. I am honored to 
serve in her place today and fondly re-
member her campaign slogan: We need 
Sue Myrick in Congress because ‘‘Sue 
Myrick gets things done.’’ 
Happy birthday to Sue.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today as a staunch defender of 
the rights of the unborn, as a defender 
of the idea that human life begins at 
conception. But these ideals are being 
threatened today like never before. 
This week, I join my fellow Repub-
licans in speaking out in support of the 
Hyde amendment and other pro-life 
provisions stripped from appropriations 
bills by the Democratic majority. 
The Hyde amendment is and has been 
a bipartisan provision included in 
every Federal spending measure for the 
past four decades. It has ensured that 
the lives of the unborn are protected 
and that no Federal tax dollars are 
used to fund abortions. 
Very simply, the Hyde amendment 
saves lives. 
I am committed to ending the blight 
of abortion on our Nation and to stand 
with all I have to fight to protect the 
rights and the lives of the unborn. 
My Democratic colleagues are great 
at 
changing 
terms 
and 
changing 
names. By definition, healthcare pro-
tects and improves lives, yet Demo-
crats changed ‘‘healthcare’’ to include 
abortion. But abortion does not im-
prove or defend life; it takes life. It is 
not healthcare. 
For this reason, Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittees on Energy and Commerce, 
Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be 
discharged from further consideration 
of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the House is in session sole-
ly for the purpose of conducting morn-
ing-hour debate. Therefore, that unani-
mous consent request cannot be enter-

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, bring this day into Your 
keeping. As much as we want to grab 
the reins and take charge, relieve us of 
our own need to control everything in 
our way, our inclination to disparage 
people with whom we can’t see eye to 
eye, and our innate fear of the uncer-
tainties that threaten our sense of se-
curity. 
You alone have dominion over our 
days. You alone bring order out of 
chaos. May we yield our whole selves 
to Your authority. 
Guide all our thoughts and feelings. 
Direct our energies that we would not 
become tangled in futile efforts and 
vain arguments. 
Instruct our minds. May we not rely 
on our own understanding, but trust 
Your direction to make our paths 
straight. Sustain our wills and our bod-
ies as long hours turn into late nights 
and little rest devolves into short tem-
pers. 
Into Your hands may we willingly 
and faithfully commend the business of 
this day. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

ADDRESSING THE WESTERN 
DROUGHT 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my extreme dis-
appointment in the majority’s unwill-
ingness to address the western drought. 
A couple weeks ago, I introduced 
three amendments to the Energy and 
Water Appropriations bill, each of 
which would make strides toward alle-
viating the devastating drought in 
California. 
My first amendment, which would ex-
tend funding authorizations for water 
storage projects under the WIIN Act 
for 1 year, would allow California to 
make the most of our wet years and en-
sure families and farmers have a clean, 
reliable source of water in times of 
drought. My colleagues in the majority 
voted ‘‘no.’’ 
My second amendment would codify 
the 2019 Biological Opinions, following 
the most accurate and best available 
science. Following the science and put-
ting the needs of people before fish 
should really be a no-brainer. My col-
leagues in the majority voted ‘‘no.’’ 
My third amendment would create a 
grant program to fund the acceleration 
and completion of repairs to damaged 
canal infrastructure facilities to enable 
farmers to comply with State pumping 
limits. My colleagues in the majority 
voted ‘‘no.’’ 
Real people need our help, and it is 
clear the majority is unwilling to pro-
vide it. I will not stop fighting to bring 
a solution to the Central Valley. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
THOMAS DOMBROSKI 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Mr. 
Thomas Dombroski, who we lovingly 
call Tom. 
Tom was a longtime resident of 
southwest Detroit, who contributed ac-
tively to several community-based or-
ganizations and was especially known 
for his service as a board member of 
the 
Southwest 
Detroit 
Community 
Benefits Coalition. He was also a very 
proud member of the Teamsters. 
Tom was tough, a big-hearted person 
whose sense of humor and warmth 
belied his tenacity in the fight to pro-
tect his community, which was con-
tagious. Tom was a champion of the 
underdog and advocated for justice on 
behalf of those who needed it most. 
Before he retired, Tom’s work with 
the Teamsters Union prepared him for 
his second act in life as a community 
advocate for equitable development of 
the Gordie Howe International Bridge 
crossing. 
He was outspoken in the fight for 
clean air and good quality of life for 
residents who live in the shadow of the 
large scale transportation infrastruc-
ture. I have always known Tom to be 
generous with his time and energy. 
His spirit will be sorely missed by the 
community he served. Please join me 
as we recognize Thomas Dombroski’s 
many contributions to the families of 
southwest Detroit and beyond as we 
give honor to his memory. 
f 
SUPPORT OF PRO-LIFE RIDERS 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, today 
the House majority will likely pass the 
faulty 
Health 
Appropriations 
bill, 
which eliminates the protection of the 
Hyde and Weldon amendments. This 
will happen despite polling that con-
sistently shows nearly 60 percent of 
Americans oppose the use of hard- 
earned taxpayer dollars for abortion. 
And even more compelling, more than 
75 percent of Americans oppose the use 
of their tax dollars to pay for abortions 
overseas. 
As we all know, the Hyde amendment 
prevents the use of Federal tax dollars 
for abortions. This policy rider has 
withstood the test of time and enjoyed 
bipartisan support for 45 years, includ-
ing from Senator Joe Biden. 
But just as important to me, as a 
physician, is the Weldon amendment, 
which prevents healthcare providers 
from being compelled to participate in 
a medical procedure to which they hold 
religious or moral objections, namely 
abortion. Removing this protection 
would result in gross violations of the 
Constitutional rights of Americans. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Hyde 
and 
Weldon amendments are just two ex-
amples of commonsense measures we 
have enacted over the years to protect 
life. I urge my colleagues in the major-
ity to reconsider dismantling these im-
portant protections of the right to life. 
f 
THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY 
(Mr. JONES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to address my remarks to Presi-
dent Biden. 
Mr. President, as you rightly said in 
Philadelphia this month, we face the 
most dangerous threat to free and fair 
elections in our history. To meet this 
threat to our democracy, we need only 
do what is plainly possible: Use our 
majorities to pass the For the People 
Act. 
But we cannot succeed unless you 
call for abolishing or reforming the fil-
ibuster. 
You have urged the American people 
to be, ‘‘clear-eyed about the obstruc-
tion we face.’’ Well, that obstruction 
comes not only from Republicans, but 
also from Members of our own party. 
I know that you do not have a voice 
in the Senate. But you do have a voice, 
the most powerful on the planet. Un-
less you use it to lead, the Senators 
who stand in the way of democracy will 
continue to do so. 
The truth is, Mr. President, we can’t 
just 
out-organize 
partisan 
gerry-
manders. We can’t just out-vote a 
party that is committed to overturning 
elections whose results they don’t like. 
And we better not ask Black and 
Brown voters to do twice as much to 
save our democracy, when we in Wash-
ington cannot be bothered to do half as 
much as we should. 
We need new laws and we need your 
help to pass them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, the 
Hyde amendment has long been a bi-
partisan measure that prevents tax-
payer dollars from being used to fund 
abortions. It is shocking to me that my 
Democrat colleagues are working to 
eliminate this amendment. Make no 
mistake, the Hyde amendment saves 
lives. 
I will continue to do my part to sup-
port pro-life legislation because our 
creator endowed every one of us with 
certain unalienable rights to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
After all, if we are unwilling to fight 
for life, what are we willing to fight 
for? 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JONES). Under guidelines consistently 
issued by successive Speakers, as re-
corded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4260 
July 29, 2021 
INVESTING IN AMERICA 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, House 
Democrats have shown up every day 
during the 117th Congress with one 
goal in mind: helping the American 
people. 
This week, we have been considering 
critical 
funding 
legislation, 
which 
gives us a chance to invest boldly in 
American families and America’s fu-
ture. 
With the funding bills put forth by 
House Democrats, we are investing in: 
job training, apprenticeship programs, 
and worker protection. 
Research, infrastructure, and tech-
nologies of the future. 
Childcare, education, healthcare, and 
housing. 
The bills we are considering would 
authorize 
10 
critical 
community 
projects in my district, providing more 
than $8.4 million in Federal funding to 
address some of the most pressing 
needs in our region, economic develop-
ment, climate resilience, treatment for 
opioid use disorder, and expanding 
mental health resources. 
House Democrats have made our pri-
orities clear: American jobs, opportuni-
ties, and working families. 
Budgets reflect values, and I am 
proud to see my community’s values 
reflected in the fiscal year 2022 funding 
bills. 
We cannot go wrong by investing in 
America. 
f 
MASK MANDATE 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, Speaker PELOSI reinstated the mask 
mandate following the ever-changing 
CDC guidelines. She is even threat-
ening to arrest staff who refuse to be 
obedient. 
The Democrats are using fear and 
mandates to continue the crisis mode. 
But the real crisis has yet to hit: de-
pression, alcohol and drug abuse, sui-
cide, supply chain issues, halted pro-
duction, economic collapse, and worse, 
the damage to our children’s hearts 
and minds from being out of their 
school and activities. 
For the Speaker of the House, these 
mandates are all about politics and not 
science. That is why when she thought 
no one was watching, she went to a 
closed hair salon to get her hair done 
without wearing a mask. She got 
caught and then blamed the hair salon 
owner. 
The rules only apply to we the peo-
ple. They never apply to those who are 
in power. 
Americans are perfectly capable of 
taking care of themselves. The Demo-
crats in this House, and the rest of the 
Federal Government, do not know bet-
ter than you, and they never have. 
Since when did the Federal Govern-
ment become your doctor? 
f 
b 1215 
FREE CUBA 
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Cuban 
people in their fight for freedom under 
the Communist dictatorship. Over the 
past few years, the situation on the is-
land has rapidly deteriorated with lim-
ited access to essentials like food, med-
icine, clean water, and electricity. 
When the people rose up in record 
numbers to oppose the regime, they 
were attacked, brutalized, and, in some 
cases, disappeared. 
We stand with the Cuban people and 
support their mission. That is why I 
am encouraging the President to pro-
vide direct aid like food, medicine, dia-
pers, internet, and vaccines directly to 
the Cuban people and to stop arms 
shipments from Venezuela and Russia 
that are being used against the Cuban 
people. 
Lead the free world in support of the 
demonstrators. We expect democratic 
nations to stands for democracy. 
My prayers are with all the Cubans, 
including those in my home State of 
Florida, whose loved ones are on the is-
land. 
f 
INVESTING IN NEW YORK–19 
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
DELGADO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
throughout the appropriations process, 
I have worked to secure investments 
for upstate families, farmers, small 
businesses, and veterans. 
I would like to highlight a few 
projects included in this year’s funding 
package that will improve and em-
power communities all across my dis-
trict. 
In Columbia County, more than 300 
homes and businesses in the towns of 
Ghent, Canaan, New Lebanon, and Aus-
terlitz will be connected to high-speed 
broadband. 
The village of Philmont Fire Depart-
ment will be able to purchase 12 new 
air packs and replace an 81-year-old 
fire siren. 
In Delaware County folks will soon 
have access to quality, safe, and afford-
able childcare. 
Northern Dutchess Hospital will add 
18 beds to its family birth center. 
These are just a few of the projects 
that we were able to secure. These are 
invaluable investments in New York- 
19. 
f

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LANGEVIN). The previous question is or-
dered on the bill, as amended. 
The question is on engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I have a mo-
tion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Tom Cole of Oklahoma moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 4502 to the Committee 
on Appropriations. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
At the end of division A (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. ll. (a) None of the funds appro-
priated in this Act, and none of the funds in 
any trust fund to which funds are appro-
priated in this Act, shall be expended for any 
abortion. 
(b) None of the funds appropriated in this 
Act, and none of the funds in any trust fund 
to which funds are appropriated in this Act, 
shall be expended for health benefits cov-
erage that includes coverage of abortion. 
(c) In this section, the term ‘‘health bene-
fits coverage’’ means the package of services 
covered by a managed care provider or orga-
nization pursuant to a contract or other ar-
rangement. 
SEC. ll. (a) The limitations established in 
the preceding section shall not apply to an 
abortion— 
(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act 
of rape or incest; or 
(2) in the case where a woman suffers from 
a physical disorder, physical injury, or phys-
ical illness, including a lifeendangering 
physical condition caused by or arising from 
the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified 
by a physician, place the woman in danger of 
death unless an abortion is performed. 
(b) Nothing in the preceding section shall 
be construed as prohibiting the expenditure 
by a State, locality, entity, or private person 
of State, local, or private funds (other than 
a State’s or locality’s contribution of Med-
icaid matching funds). 
(c) Nothing in the preceding section shall 
be construed as restricting the ability of any 
managed care provider from offering abor-
tion coverage or the ability of a State or lo-
cality to contract separately with such a 
provider for such coverage with State funds 
(other than a State’s or locality’s contribu-
tion of Medicaid matching funds). 
(d)(1) None of the funds made available in 
this Act may be made available to a Federal 
agency or program, or to a State or local 
government, if such agency, program, or gov-
ernment subjects any institutional or indi-
vidual health care entity to discrimination 
on the basis that the health care entity does 
not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or 
refer for abortions. 
(2) In this subsection, the term ‘‘health 
care entity’’ includes an individual physician 
or other health care professional, a hospital, 
a provider-sponsored organization, a health 
maintenance organization, a health insur-
ance plan, or any other kind of health care 
facility, organization, or plan. 
At the end of title VIII of division D, insert 
the following: 
SEC. ll. No funds available for obligation 
or expenditure by the District of Columbia 
government under any authority shall be ex-
pended for any abortion except where the life 
of the mother would be endangered if the 
fetus were carried to term or where the preg-
nancy is the result of an act of rape or in-
cest. 
At the end of division D (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
TITLE IX—ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS 
SEC. 901. No funds appropriated by this Act 
shall be available to pay for an abortion, or 
the administrative expenses in connection 
with any health plan under the Federal em-
ployees health benefits program which pro-
vides any benefits or coverage for abortions. 
SEC. 902. The preceding section shall not 
apply where the life of the mother would be 
endangered if the fetus were carried to term, 
or the pregnancy is the result of an act of 
rape or incest. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 2(b) of rule XIX, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the motion 
to recommit. 
The question is on the motion to re-
commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

vice, and there were—yeas 208, nays

Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO) and the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
GRANGER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 3237 currently 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
but far too much time has been con-
sumed already. 
Mr. Speaker, 204 days ago, this build-
ing, this very Chamber, was brutally 
attacked. A mob of violent insurrec-
tionists invaded our Capitol, hellbent 
on stopping the peaceful transfer of 
power. 
For the first time in over two cen-
turies, the temple of our democracy 
was defiled and damaged. 
The brave men and women of our 
Capitol Police protected us. Since that 
fateful day, they have continued to 
work day in and day out, with only the 
barest minimum of support. They have 
soldiered on with physical, mental, and 
emotional trauma and have sacrificed 
their own needs and those of their fam-
ilies for the safety and security of our 
democracy. We need to respect their 
service. 
The legislation the House passed 2 
months ago was a very strong bill that 
met the needs of the Capitol Police, 
who were so brutally attacked, and the 
National 
Guard, 
who 
bravely 
re-
sponded. I am pleased that the Senate 
amendment largely leaves those provi-
sions intact, which is why we are 
bringing it to the floor today. 
However, the Senate bill falls short 
of what we need in key areas. It does 
not include resources to prosecute the 
terrorists who attacked our govern-
ment, and it does not have enough 
funding to secure the Capitol for the 
long term. 
These needs will not disappear. As we 
pass this bill today, we know that we 
are not finished, and we are committed 
to filling in the gaps the Senate 
amendment has left. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, 
but time is running short, and the im-
mediate needs are dire. 
In those harrowing moments of Janu-
ary 6, the men and women of the Cap-
itol Police protected us. They said yes. 
Now, we must protect them. We must 
say yes. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
f 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I move that 
the House do now adjourn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to adjourn. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 173, nays

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4269 
July 29, 2021 
EMERGENCY 
SECURITY 
SUPPLE-
MENTAL TO RESPOND TO JANU-
ARY 6TH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 
2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas is recognized. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this bill to provide funding for the 
heroes in our National Guard and Cap-
itol Police, as well as the brave people 
of Afghanistan who supported our 
troops overseas. 
While I am disappointed it has taken 
this long to reach an agreement, the 
bill before us today is a strong package 
that deserves our support. 
This bill reimburses the National 
Guard, the Capitol Police, and their 
law enforcement partners for the costs 
they incurred for their heroic efforts 
on January 6; and the bill addresses 
safety and security concerns by pro-
viding necessary improvements to the 
Capitol Complex. 
The bill also provides much-needed 
assistance to our partners who sup-
ported our military during the war in 
Afghanistan. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, I 
urge my colleagues to support it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, this week, when 
law enforcement officers testified before the 
Select Committee to Investigate the January 
6th attack on the Capitol, the country saw 
what we know: that these officers are heroes. 
We thank all who answered the call on Jan-
uary 6th for their valor that dark day. They 
risked their lives for others. Hundreds were 
beaten and physically harmed. Some became 
martyrs for democracy. 
The four law enforcement heroes who testi-
fied this week were courage and truth personi-
fied. And their testimony has moved the Sen-
ate to, finally, act. 
Today, I rise in support of this emergency 
security supplemental funding bill, which will 
honor the service and sacrifice of the Capitol 
Police, as it keeps the Capitol and Congres-
sional community safe. 
This legislation is long-overdue. And, unfor-
tunately, it is under-funded by billions of dol-
lars, and it falls short of what is needed. 
But we cannot wait a day longer to act, so 
the House plans to pass it. 
Over two months ago, in May, the House 
honored our heroes by passing our strong 
emergency supplemental. Our bill was based 
on the facts and findings of briefings, hear-
ings, and reviews, including: 
the report that I asked General Honore´ and 
his team of experts to lead in the immediate 
aftermath of the insurrection, 
and the Inspector General’s reports to the 
Committee House Administration led by Chair 
ZOE LOFGREN. 
Unfortunately, the Senate’s legislation fails 
to include many of the recommendations of 
these reports that were included in our bill. 
In particular, it is disappointing that it does 
not include funding for bonuses for institutional 
workers or for a new Quick Reaction Force, 
among other steps. 
However, this bill is an important first step, 
as it helps harden the Capitol, provide some 
of the costs of the insurrection and support the 
Capitol Police. 
Passing this legislation does not end our 
work to keep the Capitol safe. Again, this is a 
first step. The House will continue to work to 
enact the recommendations of the Honore´ re-
port, through other avenues if needed. 
We must come to a time when families and 
children can visit the Capitol, lawmakers can 
do our jobs, press can report, and the Capitol 
can function and serve the American people— 
all with safety and respect. 
I urge a strong and hopefully bipartisan vote 
for this security supplemental. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) that the House suspend 
the rules and concur in the Senate 
amendment to the bill, H.R. 3237. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 416, nays 11, 
not voting 4, as follows:

Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the 
right to object. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized on his reserva-
tion. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, today there 
have been a number of items that peo-
ple on our side have been concerned 
about with respect to the Speaker’s 
order with respect to masks. 
We all understand the importance of 
safety and keeping people healthy, but 
the orders that came out today put 
some concern into our staff members 
about what they can choose to do and 
empowering and putting our police in a 
tough spot of figuring out what to do 
to enforce these orders. 
So part of the question here is an im-
portant one, and we don’t want to head 
out into August with this hanging over 
the head of the police and our staff. 
That is why I have been objecting and 
forcing some more time. 
At this point, I am going to go ahead 
and move on and withdraw my reserva-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman withdraws his reservation of 
objection.

REMEMBERING SENATOR MIKE 
ENZI 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember former Senator 
Mike Enzi of Wyoming. 
Senator 
Enzi 
was 
an 
exemplary 
statesman. Whether promoting a re-
sponsible budget as chairman of the 
Senate Budget Committee or fighting 
for Wyoming’s energy sector, he was 
always putting Wyomingites first. 
He was a dedicated public servant, 
having served two terms as mayor of 
Gillette, time in the Wyoming legisla-
ture, and four terms in the Senate. 
Senator Enzi was a problem solver, 
always willing to work with others to 
get the job done. In his 24 years on Cap-
itol Hill, he had more than 100 of his 
bills signed into law by four different 
U.S. Presidents. 
He was a man of great faith and 
greater compassion. His kindhearted 
ways made an impact on every indi-
vidual he met. 
I had the privilege of traveling with 
Senator Enzi, a brother Eagle Scout, to 
numerous National Scout Jamborees. 
Senator Enzi lived his life staying 
true to the Scouting principles of duty 
to God, duty to country, and service to 
others. He will be deeply missed. 
My heartfelt sympathies go to Diana, 
the Enzi family, and his friends.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4274 
July 29, 2021 
In my home State of Arkansas, we 
usually have plenty of water through-
out all four seasons, but the West is 
different. 
As the lead Republican on the House 
Natural Resources Committee, I have 
heard personal accounts from folks 
across the West about the crippling ef-
fects of the Western drought both in 
the past and the present. This map 
shows the vast majority of the West is 
under severe drought. 
While we can certainly take short- 
term action to mitigate drought, we 
must ask ourselves two questions to 
solve this issue long-term. First, how 
did we get here; and, next, how can we 
avoid another situation like this one? 
Before we answer these questions, 
some important context is necessary. 
Decades ago, water engineers under-
stood that the arid West would remain 
dry and its rivers went through boom 
and bust cycles of floods followed by 
intense drought. 
Under the initial direction of Presi-
dent Teddy Roosevelt, who signed the 
landmark Reclamation Act of 1902, 
dams were built to capture water in 
wet times for people to use during the 
dry times. Major metropolitan areas 
like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas, 
Salt Lake City, and Denver, would not 
exist today if it weren’t for these 
projects. Consumers nationwide still 
enjoy the fruits, nuts, and vegetables 
produced by these waters. 
Yet, starting in the 1970s, serial liti-
gants began weaponizing a series of 
well-intended laws to curtail these 
projects. The Endangered Species Act 
has been the particular weapon of 
choice for many of the organizations 
that are actually headquartered in the 
cities created by water projects. 
b 1815 
Not only did litigation compromise 
existing projects, but it also prevented 
us from building additional dams. Our 
current policies failed to measure ac-
countability and results for environ-
mental actions, and our bureaucracy 
has a paralysis-by-analysis approach 
when it comes to building new dams. 
We put a man on the Moon in shorter 
time than it takes just to study a new 
dam today. 
Our California Republican colleagues 
did something about this. They au-
thored, along with Senator DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN, an innovative law signed by 
President Obama in 2016 that stream-
lined the dam studies and facilitated 
construction. The Trump administra-
tion then moved at a record pace to 
finish the never-ending studies on po-
tential dams throughout the West. 
But today, the other side of the aisle 
is blocking the reauthorization of that 
critical law and is halting progress on 
a process that provides an all-of-the- 
above strategy to water supplies. 
The drought is not only having im-
pact on water supplies for our commu-
nities, but it is also making a terrible 
situation even worse in our poorly 
managed forests. Every night we see 
the newscasts about raging forest fires 
that are destroying communities and 
scorching habitat for endangered spe-
cies like the northern spotted owl. For 
months now we have sounded the 
alarm, only to be met with inaction 
from both the administration and our 
Democrat colleagues. 
While water may not be abundant 
out West, it is abundantly clear the ad-
ministration has no plan. In contrast, 
we do. We have the Resilient Federal 
Forests Act, the Trillion Trees Act, the 
reauthorization of the Water Infra-
structure Improvements for the Nation 
Act, and bringing balance to the En-
dangered Species Act, to name a few, 
so we can avoid the next drought. 
We have the ability to overcome and 
avoid droughts, but we must have the 
political will to act. The American peo-
ple deserve nothing less. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, joining my colleagues concerned 
about 
drought 
conditions 
ravaging 
America and wildfires devastating my 
district and the West. 
Whether it be northern Minnesota, 
California, Oregon, Colorado, or Idaho, 
we have a wildfire problem. The Supe-
rior National Forest in my district is 
boreal forest land nestled among thou-
sands of acres of lakes and rivers. 
With these water resources, wildfires 
should be few and far between. Instead, 
we are seeing new fires starting and ex-
panding more frequently than ever. 
Our hotshot teams and firefighters 
are doing an excellent job, but they 
fight a losing battle just like they do 
out West. 
According to my good friend and one 
of Congress’ foremost leaders on wild-
fire issues, Representative LAMALFA, 
there are three factors causing fires: 
topography, weather, and forest man-
agement. Humans can control only one 
of those, and that is forest manage-
ment. 
Our loggers do an excellent job when 
they are allowed. They take down dead 
trees, clear slash piles when possible, 
and benefit forest health by working 
collaboratively 
with 
other 
stake-
holders to plant three trees for every 
one taken, when they are allowed. 
But far too often they aren’t allowed. 
Radical activist groups sue at every 
turn when our loggers are trying to 
clear trees. 
Democrats continue to insist that 
more and more Federal lands be taken 
away from management, and instead 
they let fuel build up on our forest 
floor. 
Meanwhile, the ongoing drought cri-
sis suffocates everyone. In northern 
Minnesota we have farmers driving a 
day’s journey to spend too much on 
hay just so their livestock can survive 
one more year. 
I feel for my colleagues out West, 
too, as they struggle with drought- 
caused water shortages. 
Instead, activists, once again, sue at 
every turn and lobby their Democrat 
party allies to shut down responsible 
stewardship of water in the West. 
And what has the Democrat majority 
done? Nothing. Not a single hearing on 
drought or wildfire held in the Natural 
Resources Committee or in the House 
Agriculture Committee. 
There have been no Democrat solu-
tions offered, only silence. At best, we 
get the canned talking points on why 
logging is bad for the environment or 
why we need to stop managing our 
land. 
And on the other hand, Republicans 
have offered solutions and provided re-
sources to our constituents struggling 
with drought and wildfire. 
As a vice chair of the Congressional 
Western Caucus and ranking member 
of a House Natural Resources sub-
committee, I can say that I am proud 
of our Republican actions. We have in-
troduced legislation that would em-
power forest management and deliver 
water, our most precious resource, to 
those that need it in the West. 
We have held the administration ac-
countable on their inaction by sending 
letters and grilling radical nominees 
opposed to any kind of development. 
We have moderated forums and lis-
tened to the needs of those who live 
and work in the affected communities. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s control what we 
can control. 
Just listen to our resident forester, 
Ranking Member WESTERMAN: We need 
to manage our forests, and that means 
our loggers clearing trees. It is good for 
our economy, our community, and our 
forests. We need to provide water re-
sources so our Western agriculture pro-
ducers can survive. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. STAUBER for his leadership 
on the Subcommittee on Energy and 
Mineral Resources and his participa-
tion in all the things we work on try-
ing to do conservation through the 
Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ), whose dis-
trict has been greatly affected by 
drought. He is the ranking member on 
the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, 
and Wildlife. He is a water lawyer. He 
has got experience both firsthand and 
academically. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, the prob-
lem is drought, and the problem is cur-
rently being suffered by some 70 mil-
lion people across the Western United 
States, including many in my district. 
Reservoirs, creeks, springs, and wells 
are going dry, leaving fish, people, 
wildlife, homes, and agriculture with-
out water. 
Republican Members have been work-
ing hard to bring attention to this 
issue. We organized a Republican water 
forum where we spoke with expert wit-
nesses from across the West who are 
dealing with this issue every day. They 
are the ones from the communities di-
rectly affected. 
This problem does not exist in a vac-
uum. Drought makes wildfires far more 
severe, and severe wildfires destroy wa-
tersheds, in turn making us even more

H4275 
July 29, 2021 
vulnerable to drought. This horrific 
cycle will only continue until we find a 
better way to manage our forests. I 
think Ranking Member WESTERMAN’s 
forest resilience bill takes a huge step 
in that direction. 
My district right now is experiencing 
the third largest wildfire so far in the 
State’s history. It has burned some 
400,000 acres and is now only 56 percent 
contained. 
Some of my colleagues here are fac-
ing 
equally 
dangerous, 
destructive 
wildfires in their own districts, all 
worsened by the drought. 
The effects of this drought are dev-
astating. Crops die in the fields, entire 
herds of cattle are being liquidated, 
trees and shrubs die from lack of 
water, home wells go dry, businesses 
leave, and communities are devastated. 
We need to do something. 
Briefly, I want to talk about the 
drought in the Klamath, which is in 
my district. I spoke earlier this sum-
mer about the situation and how the 
Bureau of Reclamation announced that 
earlier this year for the first time in 
the Klamath Project’s history, there 
would be no water allocation to its 
largest part. 
This decision to allocate all of the 
water that the farmers had stored for 
their use instead to in-stream use is 
devastating to the people who live in 
those communities. Their livelihoods 
depend upon having adequate water. 
But this is, in the Klamath, a regu-
latory drought because there is suffi-
cient water in a lake that if shared 
would have at least offset some of this 
damage. This illustrates the challenge 
posed by the Endangered Species Act, 
which was the foundation for the deci-
sion by the Bureau of Reclamation to 
allocate all of the water to in-stream 
and in-lake purposes, with none of the 
water going to the farmers. 
I have asked the Secretary of the In-
terior and other Department of the In-
terior officials repeatedly to allocate 
at least a small part of the 350,000 acre- 
feet of water to the project. Those re-
quests have been denied. 
This denial has not only harmed the 
farmers. It has also harmed waterfowl 
who reside in a refuge in the center of 
the project. Last year we had more 
water than we do this year, and even 
then waterfowl suffered devastating 
botulism outbreaks. This will happen 
again this year and, sadly, this is to-
tally preventable if at least a small 
part of the water was allocated to the 
district. 
The short-term solution would be a 
financial relief package that Rep-
resentative LAMALFA and I are work-
ing on. I do hope that we will be suc-
cessful in getting that passed. The 
long-term solution, though, is to en-
gage in far more careful storage of 
water and utilizing other means of con-
servation and finally bringing balance 
to the Endangered Species Act. 
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber WESTERMAN
for organizing this 
Special Order hour to bring attention 
to this incredibly important problem in 
the West. It is time for both parties to 
put politics aside and get to work on 
this issue. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments 
and for his work and for his solutions 
approach to what we can do to inter-
vene in these drought situations. 
Next I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. OBERNOLTE), who is no 
stranger to dry conditions and to the 
effects of drought. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the serious problem 
that is occurring in my district and 
across the American West with condi-
tions of extreme drought. This is cer-
tainly not a new problem for us in the 
West and, certainly, not a new problem 
for us in California, but it is being par-
ticularly acutely felt. This is a prob-
lem that only our governmental inter-
vention can solve. 
Mr. Speaker, since 1970, the popu-
lation of my home State of California 
has roughly doubled, and yet we have 
built essentially zero new water stor-
age projects. So what we have in Cali-
fornia is not so much a problem with 
inadequate water, but a problem with 
inadequate water storage. The blame 
for that can be shared across all dif-
ferent branches of government over the 
last 50 years. 
In fact, since 2014, money has been 
appropriated in California for the con-
struction 
of 
new 
water 
storage 
projects, including innovative projects 
like the Sites Reservoir that would add 
over a million acre-feet of water stor-
age to California, but unfortunately 
none of those projects have been built. 
Solving this problem is going to re-
quire an all-of-the-above stance to-
wards accepting solutions from all dif-
ferent branches of government. That 
includes environmentalists, but it also 
includes projects like water storage. 
We are going to need to examine every 
single aspect of this problem to come 
up with solutions. 
Madam Speaker, I am also very con-
cerned that we have been inadequate in 
our provision for not just water stor-
age, but water treatment in my home 
State of California. 
We need to examine many more com-
prehensive solutions for treating the 
water, the wastewater that currently 
exists, to get that back into our water 
supply rather than letting it run out 
into the ocean or pumping it to other 
parts of our State, which is what hap-
pens in many parts of my home con-
gressional district. 
Only we in Congress, working in con-
junction with State and local govern-
ment, can solve this problem. I am 
hopeful that as our attention turns to 
infrastructure we will not forget about 
the need for water infrastructure in 
our country, and particularly in parts 
of the West that are so severely af-
fected by this drought. 
We need more money for water stor-
age projects, but we also need money 
for water treatment. I urge this body 
to act on this very important issue. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Mr. OBERNOLTE for bringing his 
expertise in water to the House floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE), the chairman of the Con-
gressional Western Caucus, someone 
who is no stranger to agriculture, no 
stranger to drought, and certainly no 
stranger to the importance of water. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Mr. WESTERMAN
for 
partnering with the Western Caucus to 
try to bring some attention to this 
really critical issue for our States out 
West and for all of our communities. 
So thank you very much. 
Water. It is perhaps our most vital 
resource in the American West, and un-
fortunately all of our States and our 
communities know all too well what 
the impacts are of severe drought and 
water shortages. 
b 1830 
With over 90 percent of the West in a 
catastrophic drought, the Biden admin-
istration and House Democrats have 
truly failed to act. 
As chairman of the Congressional 
Western Caucus, I represent Members 
whose districts, like my own, are lit-
erally running out of water, water that 
is used to produce food to feed the 
world or to generate clean and renew-
able energy, water used to nourish our 
lands and our environment, water to 
cook and clean and to drink. We can no 
longer sit idly by as this historic 
drought ravages our communities. 
In April, the Biden administration 
announced the formation of an inter-
agency working group tasked with 
finding 
solutions 
to 
address 
the 
drought that plagues the West. This 
working group, led by the Departments 
of Interior and Agriculture, has yet to 
provide clear objectives or produce any 
sort of plan. 
Earlier this month, members of the 
Western Caucus and Republicans from 
the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee sent a letter to the administra-
tion calling on them to provide to us 
the solutions and the ideas that they 
have for relief from the drought’s im-
pacts. As of this date they have not de-
livered. 
So as drought conditions become 
more common, we must find modern 
solutions. For over 30 years—well be-
fore my election to Congress—as a 
farmer in the Yakima Valley, as a 
State legislator, and as director of the 
Department of Agriculture for the 
State of Washington, I have worked in 
partnership with State, local, Tribal, 
and national leaders to bring forth col-
laborative 
solutions 
that 
improve 
water storage and delivery in my home 
State of Washington. I am proud of 
that work, but we have much to do. 
As we continue developing and de-
ploying water conservation efforts, cer-
tainly there is more work that needs to 
be done. We must find short-term as 
well as long-term solutions to address 
this issue that threatens our economies

and our environment and truly our way 
of life. 
Drought is not a partisan issue, and I 
urge the administration and my col-
leagues, 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
from the other side of the aisle to ac-
knowledge the West’s urgent needs and 
to work with us to provide actual re-
lief, not just talk to our communities 
who truly are struggling. 
I thank Mr. WESTERMAN of the Nat-
ural Resources Committee for drawing 
attention to this critical issue, for 
shedding some light on it, and, hope-
fully, by educating more people as to 
the seriousness of this critical issue we 
can truly make some progress in bring-
ing some solutions forward that will 
help people all through the Western 
United States. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gen-
tleman again for his leadership on the 
Congressional Western Caucus. I thank 
him for the solutions-based approach 
he takes to problems, whether it is 
drought or other issues that we face 
with natural resources across the coun-
try. Hopefully, we can continue to 
work together and to bring more peo-
ple in across the aisle that recognize 
that we do need to have action. Talk-
ing about things in D.C. don’t solve 
farmers’ 
problems 
in 
Washington 
State. It doesn’t fix forest fire prob-
lems across the West and across the 
country. We need to talk and come to 
solutions and take action. So I do ap-
preciate the gentleman’s work. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Col-
orado (Mrs. BOEBERT), who also lives in 
a place that is very prone to fire and is 
subject to drought. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. It is 
an honor to serve on the House Natural 
Resources Committee with you. 
Madam Speaker, the West is cur-
rently burning to the ground. We are 
seeing historic wildfires, meanwhile 
the House of Representatives, the peo-
ple’s House, is arguing over mask man-
dates and passing dead-on-arrival budg-
etary bills. 
Ninety-three percent of the West is 
under severe drought, and it is past 
time we pass legislation that would 
provide effective solutions that our 
constituents are calling for on a daily 
basis. 
That is exactly what I have been 
working toward. In March, I was proud 
to introduce the Western Water Secu-
rity Act. This legislation protects Trib-
al groups, farmers, ranchers, agricul-
tural districts, towns, small businesses, 
and other water users who rely on pri-
vately held water rights that have been 
put in jeopardy by the Federal Govern-
ment. Instead of joining my bill to en-
sure these protections, Democrats are 
trying to curb cow flatulence; that is 
right, cow farts. That is their priority. 
The lack of leadership by House Demo-
crats is totally unacceptable. 
And here is what I mean by that. 
Under President Trump, the historic 
multi-State Drought Contingency Plan 
was implemented which, among other 
benefits, prevented water cuts and ra-
tioning while protecting the water lev-
els of Colorado’s two largest reservoirs. 
Under President Trump, the Federal 
Government implemented Title Trans-
fer authority, getting Federal water fa-
cilities transferred to local, more capa-
ble water suppliers. 
And under President Trump, Repub-
licans fixed Obama’s WOTUS regula-
tions, providing water security to 
ranchers and farmers across America. 
In contrast, under the Biden regime, 
we have seen bureaucrat laziness 101. 
An interagency working group was 
formed. Yeah, whoop-de-do. How is 
that working for anyone? What have 
they done? No one knows. Since April, 
my colleagues and I have questioned 
the Biden regime’s appointees and re-
ceived no concrete answers or re-
sponses that were promised. 
And there are more appointees that 
are waiting for confirmation, like the 
potential head of the Bureau of Land 
Management. The woman who will be 
the director of the Bureau of Land 
Management is a known ecoterrorist. 
This is all terrible. And this is all 
under the Biden regime. This regime is 
failing the American people, and the 
cost is far too high. 
I urge my colleagues to join my 
Western Water Security Act and let us 
begin 
to 
protect 
private 
property 
rights, and our water rights, while en-
suring an abundant supply of clean 
water for future generations. 
Madam Speaker, we need to drain the 
swamp, not our reservoirs. I thank 
Ranking Member WESTERMAN for yield-
ing me this time and for leading on 
this important issue. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for reminding 
us that we do need to have our prior-
ities in order, that there are important 
things that we are failing to address 
here in Congress. 
We are getting ready to break for the 
August break, and nothing will have 
been done to address wildfires or 
drought. I don’t think that is what the 
American people deserve, nor what 
they want. It is a lack of priorities and 
a lack of leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
who understands agriculture because 
he is a farmer. He understands drought 
because he lives in California. He un-
derstands abundant water supplies be-
cause of where he lives in California. 
And he also understands catastrophic 
wildfire and how that is related to lack 
of management. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. WESTERMAN for his work on 
the 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee 
where I was for several years, as well 
as working with the Western Caucus on 
this, as well. 
Obviously, it has been underlined 
during this time tonight that we are in 
a severe drought situation. The darker 
the color on the map the more severe 
that area is. So my part of California is 
the portion right here at the border 
here. Oregon is in that corner. So you 
see the dark brown is the Klamath 
Basin. My colleague, CLIFF
BENTZ, 
spoke about that a little bit also on 
how dire that situation is. 
You see all over the map here that 
the whole West, much of it is in that 
brown 
color, 
called 
exceptional 
drought, and the orange area is called 
extreme drought. 
So what do we do about these situa-
tions? We must be proactive. 
In California—and I will talk a lot 
about California—but also that is of in-
terest to the whole country because so 
much of the crops that so many of the 
people in this country use come from 
California. 
We have had leadership in the past 
that 
produced 
the 
Federal 
water 
project known as the Central Valley 
Project and the State Water Project 
that California did. Two of the biggest 
dams there are 41⁄2-million and 31⁄2-mil-
lion acre feet by themselves. Now, an 
acre foot is 326,000 gallons. An acre foot 
is enough to take care of two house-
holds or approximately 10 people for a 
year. 
And so we used to build these 
projects 
because 
we 
were 
forward 
thinkers then. And that water bene-
fited so many of us. But when we talk 
about the drought situation, it also af-
fects not just people and food supply 
and the water supply, but also as my 
colleague and I, Mr. BENTZ, we share 
that area on the Oregon border where 
is the Klamath Basin is. 
So what does that mean for wildlife 
when we don’t keep track of our water 
supply, we don’t put it where it is the 
most beneficial? You get a situation 
like this. This is a refuge for ducks and 
other waterfowl that is going to be dry 
this year. 
Last year I was up there on a trip and 
during the year they had the deaths of 
60,000 ducks and other waterfowl due to 
botulism because the water is so low, 
and it gets that disease in there and 
wipes out the flock which affects the 
whole Pacific Flyway. 
So this isn’t just about farms and 
food and money and this and that. This 
is also about habitat. But the only 
habitat you hear about in California is 
such that might help the fish, the 
salmon or the sucker fish in Klamath 
Lake. The sucker fish do not sustain 
themselves by a full lake on that lake; 
indeed, it needs to be lower. And they 
have been trying to run water down the 
Klamath River in order to wipe out a 
virus—it is kind of a mold—by keeping 
it wet in order to help the salmon. 
And we see this also in the delta that 
flows through the bay area from those 
great 
watering 
sources 
that 
come 
through the Sacramento Valley and 
the San Joaquin Valley. They are wast-
ing so much water running it through 
there trying to help the delta smelt. So 
much water is gone, and the smelt, 
when they do a trawl, a survey, they 
can’t even find any more with the 
extra water that has been run through 
there for 30 years.

July 29, 2021 
So what are we going to do? Why 
does this matter to all Americans? 
Well, certain crops, 99 percent, come 
from California, such as almonds, arti-
chokes, celery, figs, garlic, raisins, 
kiwi, 
honeydew, 
nectarines, 
olives, 
cling peaches, pistachios, plums, sweet 
rice, and walnuts. You are not going 
find those easily imported from some-
where else—or at least of the quality 
that Americans are used to—if we don’t 
fix our water situation in the State of 
California, either due to environmental 
and regulatory concerns or building 
more storage. We should be doing both. 
We need to be fixing the regulatory 
problems because the Endangered Spe-
cies Act has been weaponized against 
things that work for people. 
We need to pause for a minute and 
see if these things that we are doing 
are even helping environmentally, even 
helping the fish populations, and they 
are not. 
This year the lakes will finally run 
out. In 2022, all bets are off because 
Lake Oroville is so low. Lake Shasta is 
pretty low. We won’t have the water 
supply. You can forget agriculture. We 
know that they will. Agriculture seems 
to be the last in line for anything in 
California. But the urban areas are 
going run out before too long. 
Can you imagine trucking water into 
the urban areas? Can you imagine try-
ing to set up temporary desal plants 
along L.A.? They have been trying to 
build a desal plant in Huntington 
Beach for 20 years, and the environ-
mental groups put the brakes on that 
all the time. It is amazing. They are 
cutting their own throat. 
So when are we going to get focused 
on what works for people and their 
food supply and the domestic wells? 
Thousands of domestic wells are going 
dry around California, and we haven’t 
even seen the full effect of this year 
when many thousands more will go 
dry. 
What do you do for those folks? Hey, 
forget agriculture, it isn’t important. 
We will just import the food. Like im-
ported oil was so great and imported 
electricity. No. We have to be thinking 
a lot more because the environmental 
movement has decimated this. 
Let’s talk about forestry for a mo-
ment, all those overcrowded forests 
create their own drought, and they also 
don’t let the water supply that would 
normally come down through the sys-
tem and hit our lakes, it doesn’t get 
there anymore because we have an in-
ventory of 10 to one what we should be 
having in our forests 
So we have got a lot of work to do. 
We have to reform the Endangered Spe-
cies Act. We have to reform the NEPA 
process to be able to get projects done 
and still take into account what we 
can do positively for the environment. 
We will still do that. 
Fish benefit from dams, yet all you 
hear about is tear the dams out. 
Whether it is up in Washington for Mr. 
NEWHOUSE
or my district and Mr. 
BENTZ’s district, that seems to be the 
big push. 
Where are we going to get this water 
supply? How are we going to have 
water for fish in order to have it go 
down the streams to the fish each year 
when you don’t have the dam there be-
cause it is all gone in a short amount 
of time after the rain stops? 
b 1845 
We have to get our heads back to-
gether on how things really work. We 
are not going to have a food supply. We 
are not going to have a timber supply— 
because it is all burning right now— 
until we get past having the Endan-
gered Species Act and the environ-
mental organizations rule what we do 
in this country. 
Madam Speaker, we have to get seri-
ous. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BUSH). The gentleman has 271⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to another gentleman from Cali-
fornia, who certainly understands agri-
culture, and he understands drought 
conditions, water management. He is 
also a farmer. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. VALADAO). 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my frustration with the major-
ity’s unwillingness to get involved in 
drought recovery and prevention in the 
Western United States. 
I am frustrated that my colleagues in 
the majority care so little about real 
people suffering from a lack of water. 
Some of my constituents have been 
forced to bathe with bottled water. 
Some of my constituents have been 
forced to abandon entire fields of crops 
because they simply don’t have enough 
water for them. Some of my constitu-
ents can’t drink the little water they 
have in their wells because the water 
contains arsenic and isn’t safe to 
drink. 
Madam Speaker, this isn’t a looming 
crisis. We are in the middle of a crisis. 
I am here today with several of my col-
leagues in the minority, most of which 
that hail from the Western States, and 
I know they share the same frustration 
as me. 
We have repeatedly called for hear-
ings to be called on the Western 
drought, with no answer from the ma-
jority. We have tirelessly written let-
ters to Biden administration officials 
and 
Western 
Governors 
requesting 
help, with no backing from the major-
ity. We have introduced bills and put 
forward amendments to help prevent 
future droughts, with no consideration 
from the majority. 
Madam Speaker, how many times do 
we have to tell our colleagues in the 
majority that my constituents and the 
constituents of many of my colleagues 
here today are hurting? 
We are tirelessly trying to bring ac-
tion in every way possible. We just ask 
that you work with us to get it done. 
This shouldn’t be political. This is 
about real people and the desperate 
need for access to clean and reliable 
water. 
Madam Speaker, this isn’t the first 
time you have heard from me on this 
issue, and it certainly will not be the 
last. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from California, 
and I also agree with him that we 
haven’t taken action. 
D.C. is fiddling while the West burns 
again. Here we are, getting ready to 
break for August recess with nothing 
to show, nothing to tell the people in 
the West on what is being done to miti-
gate these wildfires, to mitigate the 
drought. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS), who just got the VIP Act 
passed earlier today. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague, the 
ranking member of the Natural Re-
sources 
Committee, 
Representative 
WESTERMAN, both for yielding and also 
for all of his diligent efforts in helping 
us pass the Alexander Lofgren VIP Act. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation is in cri-
sis. Right now, over half of Iowa is ex-
periencing a moderate to extreme 
drought. This dire situation is mir-
rored around the country, with thou-
sands of counties across the West expe-
riencing historic drought conditions. 
This situation has a widespread impact 
on our way of life. 
For my constituents, it means our 
farmers and ranchers must fight even 
harder to make ends meet after this 
pandemic. 
As drought conditions worsen, so 
does the cost of irrigation. Less water 
means less yield, less in their pockets 
at the end of the day, and less in the 
ground for the next year. 
For our fellow Americans out West, 
not only does this drought harm farm-
ers and ranchers, but the real threat of 
wildfires is made dramatically worse 
by the lack of moisture. 
Madam Speaker, this is shameful and 
avoidable. 
The 
government 
cannot 
make it rain, but it can and should 
plan for the future. Republicans have 
consistently advocated for increased 
water storage and regulatory stream-
lining, which would help conserve 
water for the dry years. These meas-
ures have been largely opposed by our 
Democrat colleagues. 
Now, as we move into August experi-
encing another major drought season, 
this majority and this administration 
have no plan, no solution, and have 
taken no action to prepare for the next 
drought season. 
Madam Speaker, not only is there no 
plan, but this current administration is 
actively making it more difficult for 
Iowans to access the water they need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4278 
July 29, 2021 
stated that the Biden administration 
doesn’t ‘‘have any intention of going 
back to the original Obama WOTUS.’’ 
Unfortunately, on June 9, the EPA 
announced its intention to revise the 
definition of the waters of the United 
States once again and reopen the Navi-
gable Waters Protection Rule. This de-
cision is misguided and undoes the 
good work and progress achieved by 
the Trump administration. 
I have spoken with Iowans dozens of 
times about the issues created by the 
2015 WOTUS rule. WOTUS hurts Amer-
ican farmers, ranchers, landowners, 
homebuilders, businesses, and just the 
average, ordinary property owner. It 
has caused confusion and hindered eco-
nomic development. 
By reopening this rule, the Biden ad-
ministration once again threatens eco-
nomic development and creates uncer-
tainty for rural America. 
Madam Speaker, creating this uncer-
tainty, especially during this drought 
crisis, is a mistake. We should uphold 
the Navigable Waters Protection Rule 
and ensure that all Americans have 
straightforward access to the water 
they need to thrive and especially to 
survive. 
Thank you to the ranking member of 
the Committee on Natural Resources, 
Representative WESTERMAN, for orga-
nizing today’s Special Order to high-
light this ongoing crisis. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for high-
lighting how the drought is affecting 
the Midwest, not just the West, and for 
pointing out that our colleagues across 
the aisle and the administration not 
only have not taken any action and 
don’t have a plan; they also won’t lis-
ten to us who have plans, who want to 
take action. 
That is why we are here, why we are 
making this case that we have to take 
action. We can’t just stand by and not 
try to do anything to help. 
Again, I thank the gentlewoman. She 
passed a bill with 420 votes affirmative 
and 0 against. I think she knows how to 
work in a bipartisan manner, and she 
wants to do solutions to help people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE), an-
other freshman Member from the West, 
who certainly understands drought and 
natural resources. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Arkan-
sas. 
My bill this week was about 415–0, so 
I also know how to work in a bipar-
tisan manner. I think that is probably 
what I appreciate the most about your 
leadership on the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources, the recognition of the 
long-term challenges that we have but 
being able to come up with real solu-
tions for the short term. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
tinue the conversation that many of 
my colleagues have highlighted from 
their own individual districts. Coming 
from Utah, we are experiencing the 
worst drought in our modern history. 
Madam Speaker, 99.9 percent of Utah, 
according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 
is experiencing extreme drought. The 
entire State is under this. 
The impact of this crisis cannot be 
overstated. The lack of water will re-
duce food and jobs and increase the fre-
quency and size of wildfires. Unfortu-
nately, our agriculture sector is bear-
ing much of the brunt of this. 
Farmers and ranchers in my State 
and district have had to reduce their 
water use by 70 to 75 percent compared 
to 2020 numbers. This will increase food 
prices for years to come, but it will 
also decimate rural economies, which 
hurt our State and our Nation. 
The scope of this issue is magnified 
by the rapid population growth taking 
place in the West. In Utah, the popu-
lation is expected to double by 2065. In-
creased water demand will strain our 
water infrastructure and could cripple 
economic expansion. 
We must pursue creative water poli-
cies that allow us to respond to the cri-
ses of today while preparing for the 
challenges of the future. 
I am proud of the great work being 
done by State leaders in Utah and in 
our Western States that are working 
toward this very goal. Here in Wash-
ington, we must carefully consider 
ways we can streamline, improve, and 
update laws and regulations that make 
it difficult for States to build the water 
infrastructure projects they need to 
meet our ever-increasing demands. 
As this issue intensifies, it is incum-
bent upon us to give this crisis the at-
tention that it deserves, to collaborate 
and to work toward a solution that can 
enable our communities to prosper in 
these difficult times. 
Madam Speaker, we owe this to our 
constituents, our districts, and our 
States. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Utah. I 
turn now to California, an area of Cali-
fornia that is very dry, an area that 
has experienced a lot of forest fires. 
From talking to this gentleman, I 
know that a lot of those forest fires 
can be prevented, that we could have 
an abundance of resources, yet we seem 
to waste and mismanage these re-
sources. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
will speak on a related matter, and 
that is how our Forest Service ap-
proaches fire in our densely over-
crowded and drought-stricken forest. 
Madam Speaker, on July Fourth, 
lightning struck a tree in the Hum-
boldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Al-
pine County, California, starting a 
small fire that smoldered just over a 
quarter of an acre of rugged terrain. 
Now, instead of immediately attack-
ing this fire, the U.S. Forest Service 
decided to monitor it instead—that is 
to say, to do precisely nothing. 
On July 16, 12 days later, that small 
fire of a quarter of an acre, now called 
the Tamarack fire, exploded out of con-
trol. It has now consumed 70,000 acres 
as of this writing. One of the towns in 
its path is Woodfords, California. 
In 1987, the Woodfords Fire Depart-
ment responded to a report of fire on 
Forest Service land near their town in 
the same forest. They, too, were turned 
away. In fact, Federal officials threat-
ened Woodfords’ residents with arrest 
for even trying to extinguish the small 
blaze. 
Hours later, that fire exploded to 
6,500 acres, costing 25 families their 
homes. Apparently, the Forest Service 
has learned absolutely nothing in 34 
years. 
This let-burn policy of Federal land 
managers began back in 1972 during the 
height of the radical environmental 
movement. It stems from the premise 
that fire is nature’s way of cleaning up 
forests and that active suppression of 
fire leads to a buildup of excess fuels. 
That is right, as far as it goes be-
cause an untended forest is just like an 
untended garden. It will grow and grow 
until it chokes itself to death and will 
ultimately 
be 
consumed 
by 
cata-
strophic fire. That is how nature gar-
dens. 
The U.S. Forest Service was formed 
to remove excess growth before it can 
burn and to preserve our forests in a 
healthy condition from generation to 
generation. 
In California, active land manage-
ment reduced acreage that was annu-
ally lost to wildfire for more than 4 
million acres a year in pre-Columbian 
times to just a quarter-million acres 
during the 20th century. 
Federal foresters marked off excess 
timber and auctioned it to timber com-
panies, which paid the Federal Govern-
ment for harvesting rights. 
Environmental laws adopted in the 
1970s now require years of environ-
mental studies at a cost of millions of 
dollars before forest thinning can be 
undertaken. That essentially brought 
the era of active land management to a 
halt. 
The result? California’s wildfire dam-
age has returned to its prehistoric 
level, more than 4 million acres lost to 
catastrophic wildfire last year. You 
see, nature is a lousy gardener. 
In 1988, when the Federal let-burn 
policy produced the disastrous Yellow-
stone fires, President Reagan reversed 
it. ‘‘I did not even know’’ the policy ex-
isted, he said. ‘‘The minute that this 
happened out there and Don Hodel 
went out, he made it plain that, no, we 
were withdrawing from that policy.’’ 
That is what President Reagan said. 
Unfortunately, Reagan left, and the 
policy returned. The devastation that 
it has caused since then is tragic, 
avoidable, and incalculable. 
Especially given the hazardous condi-
tions of today’s forest, sensible policy 
would give top priority to extin-
guishing the small fires before they can 
explode out of control into mega-fires. 
Scrambling to explain their obvious 
dereliction of duty, Deputy Forest Su-
pervisor Jon Stansfield complained

that they just didn’t have the re-
sources to put out the small fire when 
a water drop by helicopter could have 
stopped it cold. 
Yet, they had the resources to photo-
graph it by helicopter, and they had 
the resources to do countless airdrops 
after they had allowed it to explode out 
of control. 
b 1900 
Now, the Federal Government owns 
96 percent of Alpine County, leaving it 
with virtually no tax base and entirely 
dependent on tourism attracted by the 
national forest. The fire has not only 
taken people’s homes and destroyed 
their businesses, but it has severely 
damaged the forest resource that Al-
pine County’s entire economy depends 
on for tourism. 
It is dangerous nonsense to monitor 
incipient fires in today’s forest tinder-
box, even if they seem to pose no im-
mediate danger. No person in his right 
mind would monitor a rattlesnake 
curled up in his bedroom because it 
isn’t doing much of anything at the 
moment. He would kill it before it 
does. 
In our national forests, only the For-
est Service can prevent small blazes 
from becoming forest fires, and it is 
about time they did. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship in the past in getting bipartisan 
legislation in place. 
I remember a couple of years ago I 
was out around South Lake Tahoe and 
I saw the fruits of the efforts of Rep-
resentative MCCLINTOCK, working in a 
bipartisan manner with many groups, 
to do the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, 
part of what was in the bipartisan 
WIIN Act. 
And I felt proud as an American from 
Arkansas to be in California and seeing 
the forest actually being managed and 
knowing that it was my colleague, Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK, that pushed for that. And 
more of that needs to be done, enough 
of it is not happening. We need more 
land that gets treated like that. It 
looked like a park. From a forestry 
perspective, I would have maybe taken 
a few more trees out, but it was way 
better than what was left around it and 
it is making great progress, and that is 
because of solutions-based approaches 
to getting the job done and making a 
difference out on the ground. 
But we have got 80 million acres of 
forest land in this country that is sub-
ject to catastrophic wildfire. When you 
mix that with the drought conditions 
that we are seeing today, Madam 
Speaker, it is a recipe for disaster. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK talked about a light-
ning strike that was left to burn, when 
it could have been put out early. We 
see massive destruction. We are seeing 
that in eastern Oregon, and we will 
continue to see it. We are seeing one of 
the worst wildfire seasons that we have 
ever seen. 
I think Americans need to under-
stand how important healthy forests 
are to good watersheds. Teddy Roo-
sevelt knew that. He talked about the 
importance of developing the West and 
protecting the watersheds and the tim-
ber in the upper parts of the water-
sheds, because that timber acts as a fil-
ter. It acts like a sponge that holds 
water and releases it slowly so that 
you don’t get all of it running off at 
one time. 
We have these massive forest fires, 
next comes the flooding and the land-
slides and the degradation to our 
streams. We want to help species like 
the Chinook salmon. But when we are 
washing the topsoil into the streams, 
that is not helping any kind of fish. 
We let wildfires burn right down to 
the edge of the stream. If we were 
doing forest management, we would 
thin the forest. We would be the gar-
dener and the caretaker. We have solu-
tions. We have proposed legislation 
but, unfortunately, Congress has failed 
to act. Not only has Congress failed to 
act, but Congress has failed to be able 
to come together and talk about these 
issues, and we need to do that. 
I hope that over this August recess 
my colleagues across the aisle will 
have a change of heart, so when we get 
back here in September, these bills will 
come to the floor, and we will do real 
bipartisan work that is good for the en-
vironment, that is good for the econ-
omy, and that is good for America. We 
stand ready to do that. 
Republicans are ready to work for 
the good of America—for rural Amer-
ica, and we want to make a difference. 
We invite our friends across the aisle 
to join us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, we are here today to call on 
the President, to call on the House, to 
call on the Senate to pass immigration 
reform. We hope to see immigration re-
form in reconciliation. 
We are here to tell the stories of why 
we must do this, of why we must do 
this not just for the immigrant com-
munity, and not just because it is the 
right thing to do, and not just because 
of the stories of each of those families 
who put their lives on the line, who 
study, our DACA, our Dreamers, our 
essential workers, not just for each of 
them. We are calling for immigration 
reform because it is good for America. 
And we must move beyond the rhet-
oric of division. We must move beyond 
the rhetoric of hate. And we must 
move to the facts. And when we move 
to those facts, we know and we learn 
that immigration reform is good for 
this country. 
I often talk about the fact that we 
need to ignore those who would divide 
us. Those who would seek to demonize 
another for political gain. Because we 
know in New Mexico, especially, we 
know that there is no other, there is 
only an us. No hay un otro, solamente 
nosotros. 
And when we look at some of these 
numbers, we recognize that. When we 
notice that immigration reform will 
bring a $1.7 trillion benefit to our econ-
omy, that it will raise annual wages for 
everybody by $700, that it would create 
438,000 jobs for Americans, there is an 
economic reason for doing this beyond 
the sense of who we are, our humanity, 
and who we are as a Nation of immi-
grants. 
This issue affects every community 
in our Nation. And it is so important in 
my own community that the first 
meeting I had after I was elected was 
with Somos Un Pueblo Unido. We Are a 
United Community. Somos Un Pueblo 
Unido. 
And it was wonderful to have that 
meeting, because I heard directly the 
voices of my sisters who were undocu-
mented. I heard their voices tell the 
story of what it was like to work, tell 
the story of what it was like to be ex-
posed to COVID, but they knew they 
had to go back to work because they 
did not have a choice. Because they did 
not have any other way of providing 
for their children. 
They put themselves in harm’s way 
to care for us. They put themselves in 
harm’s way to make sure that our gro-
cery stores were stocked. They put 
themselves in harm’s way to make sure 
that our elderly were cared for. They 
asked me a favor, they said, Senora 
Congresista, we ask that you will take 
our stories to Washington, D.C., that 
you will take our stories and use your 
voice there to repeat them. And so my 
voice right now is not mine, it is 
theirs. 
Today, we stand in the people’s 
House and use our voices to share the 
community stories, to highlight the 
benefits of immigration reform, and 
hopefully, hopefully, to get closer to 
making it a reality. 
There are an estimated 11 million un-
documented immigrants in the United 
States, they are the Dreamers who we 
have talked about. They are undocu-
mented students, children, adults, who 
have only known this country as their 
home, they have U.S. citizen family 
members. As noted, they are care-
givers, healthcare workers, education, 
and small business owners. 
The immigrants in the United States 
are a reflection of us. They do the

things we do, they are doctors, they are 
lawyers, they are students, they are 
children. They are American. Just as 
American as any of us, and they each 
deserve an opportunity to reach their 
fullest potential. 
And year after year after year immi-
gration reform becomes a political 
football. Year after year after year 11 
million people are held hostage by po-
litical games. 
You know, the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus has advocated and 
fought for a pathway to citizenship for 
undocumented immigrants for years. It 
is one of our priorities that we get it 
passed. It is one of our priorities that 
we address immigration reform in the 
American Families Plan, in the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan. 
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus 
has been fighting this battle for dec-
ades—since they were formed. They 
have not given up. And the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus has not 
given up because we know that we 
must carry those voices and those 
voices must be all of our voices. 
Let’s talk a little bit about what 
happened during the pandemic. Immi-
grants carried us through the pan-
demic. While we stayed home, immi-
grant farm workers continued to go to 
work in the fields, risking their lives to 
keep our country fed. Undocumented 
essential workers in our grocery stores 
kept the shelves stocked with that food 
that was picked by the immigrant farm 
worker. Dreamers taught our youngest, 
they kept them engaged over that 
Zoom screen. 
We saw how the pandemic, though, 
fueled the rise of anti-Asian hate 
crimes. But what else fueled that rise 
of 
hate? 
Anti-immigrant, 
racist, 
xenophobic rhetoric from the Trump 
administration. Asian Americans, de-
spite those attacks that were leveled at 
them, they continued serving their 
communities, even in the face of those 
racist violent attacks. 
And, yet, during the first round of 
stimulus checks, these immigrants, 
who we just described, who kept us 
going through the pandemic, they were 
left behind. They were made to feel 
like they were not part of our country, 
that they were not part of our recov-
ery, and like they were an other. 
I want to talk a bit more about the 
other immigrants. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BOWMAN), 
to engage in this conversation about 
the role that immigrants play. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ for convening this Special 
Order hour to discuss the urgent topic 
of immigration reform. 
Last week, I had the opportunity and 
privilege of visiting the U.S.-Mexico 
border to bear witness to the carceral 
system that undergirds our immigra-
tion policy and practices. 
I gained a firsthand understanding of 
how our Federal policies impact the 
conditions at the border. While there, I 
visited a Catholic Charities shelter 
that centered its work around caring 
for newly arrived asylum seekers. This 
shelter operates on a shoestring budget 
and relies on FEMA to retroactively 
reimburse spending for essentials like 
food, a funding process that is never 
certain. And most of the workers there 
were volunteers from across the coun-
try. While their facilities lacked re-
sources, it was abundant with care. 
I then saw inside a well-funded Cus-
toms and Border Protection, or CBP, 
facility, where law enforcement had 
put over 10 men, who had not been test-
ed for COVID, together in one small 
cell, sleeping on the concrete floor, 
even when other cells were sitting 
empty. 
b 1915 
For context, the current year, the 
funding level for CBP is more than $15 
billion. 
In New York’s 16th Congressional 
District which I represent, one-third of 
my constituents are born outside of the 
United States. I represent thousands of 
undocumented constituents, refugees, 
and immigrants living and working in 
the Bronx and Westchester who have to 
navigate our immigration system on a 
regular basis with fear from ICE 
agents. In our home State of New York 
is Ellis Island which reads: 
Give me your tired, your poor, 
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe 
free, 
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. 
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to 
me, 
I lift my lamp beside the golden door! 
The U.S. Mexico border is the new 
Ellis Island, yet these newcomers—a 
darker hue than those who came to 
Ellis Island with welcome arms—are 
met with punishment, walls, and harm. 
We send our tired and our poor to pris-
on-like detention centers without prop-
er medical care and little food and 
produce a retraumatizing experience 
for those who already made a scary and 
life-threatening trek across the border. 
I heard stories of mothers traveling 
with their 1-month-old babies across 
the river, carrying their babies on their 
heads as they waded through the 
waters. Now imagine the level of des-
peration in your home country, Madam 
Speaker, where you would risk the life 
of yourself and your 1-month-old baby 
to come to this country with no guar-
antee that you were going to be able to 
remain here. 
We need to reimagine and redesign 
our immigration system and the sup-
port we provide to our immigration 
neighbors. If we want to live up to the 
ideals of this country, our system must 
be rooted in care and inclusion, not 
militarization, surveillance, detention, 
and forced deportation. 
As a Black man in America and as 
Black people in America, we have been 
experiencing mass incarceration since 
the end of slavery. Our brothers and 
sisters coming in through the Mexico 
border to the U.S. are experiencing 
mass incarceration and mass deporta-
tion under the hands of CBP. 
The differences in funding and capac-
ity at the Catholic Charities shelter, 
which heavily relies on donations, 
versus the CBP facility was startling 
and disheartening. The vast majority 
of CBP apprehensions, Madam Speak-
er—over 90 percent—were determined 
by Border Patrol to not be criminals. 
Over 90 percent, the Border Patrol told 
me. Yet the vast majority of our an-
nual funding to this region goes to law 
enforcement. We need a fundamental 
shift in our priorities to move away 
from funding detention and militariza-
tion at our border. 
This is especially true given how past 
U.S. policies, such as the U.S. occupa-
tion of Nicaragua in 1912 and other 
Latin American countries, and our his-
toric empowerment of corrupt govern-
ments have contributed to instability, 
violence, and economic oppression; all 
of which force people to flee their home 
countries and seek asylum here. 
Yes, our immigration policy is con-
nected to our foreign policy and con-
nected to our capitalism. We have sto-
len land and resources from foreign 
countries and caused their political 
and economic systems to be disrupted 
and taken over by violence. The guns 
that get to many of these countries 
come from here. So we have caused this 
harm and disruption, yet we won’t 
allow those who are looking for peace 
to flee into our country. 
We also need to create a pathway to 
citizenship for all of the 11.4 million 
undocumented immigrants as part of 
the next reconciliation package. The 
young adults whom we met with in La-
redo, Texas, whose family members had 
been deported deserve a pathway to 
citizenship. 
By the way, once CBP, which seemed 
to be hunters in this situation, detain 
someone and they need long-term de-
tention, they pass them over to the 
ICE agents. Then the ICE agents put 
them in detention, and they are so iso-
lated they can’t receive calls from fam-
ily and friends, they can’t receive let-
ters, and they can’t receive visits. Fi-
nally, when someone finds a way to 
make a connection with the detention 
center, the person who was in the de-
tention center is lost, often never to be 
found. 
The young adults whom I met with in 
Laredo whose family members have 
been deported deserve a pathway to 
citizenship. The high schoolers in my 
district who fear they won’t be able to 
file for DACA status and stay in our 
country for college deserve a pathway 
to citizenship. From Laredo, Texas, to 
the Bronx, to Westchester, to St. 
Louis, Missouri, there are millions of 
people who should be able to stay in 
this country and continue to help our 
communities thrive. 
We have the power to provide sta-
bility and a sense of belonging to our 
immigrant communities this Congress, 
and we cannot wait any longer. 
I will end with this: during the last 
administration there was so much fear

instilled in our immigrant families and 
communities that one student in the 
Bronx thought that her mom was de-
ported from home, but the mom actu-
ally ran away so she wouldn’t be de-
ported. 
But 
because 
the 
student 
thought that the mother was deported, 
the student fell into a deep depression 
and committed suicide because she 
thought her mother was taken from 
her. 
This is what we are dealing with 
when it comes to our immigration pol-
icy. It is inhumane, and it is evil. Our 
immigrants make us a stronger nation, 
not a weaker one. It is time for a 21st 
century Marshall Plan to help rebuild 
Central and South America. But those 
who come in here should be welcomed 
with open arms as they are just seek-
ing peace, safety, care, and security. If 
we are as a nation to live up to the 
ideals of our democracy and our Con-
stitution, then we must welcome them 
with open arms and with love so that 
we can build a better nation back bet-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman LEGER FERNANDEZ for her lead-
ership. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
going to the border because it is only 
when we go to the border, but go to the 
border not with the intent to create a 
wedge issue but with an intent to lis-
ten and with intent to open our arms 
that we really see what is going on, the 
seeking of refuge. I went to the border 
with actually a bipartisan delegation 
surprisingly. It was wonderful. It was a 
bipartisan delegation. 
It struck me. Meeting with those 
young children who are alone it struck 
me that the seeking of refuge and send-
ing your child alone to a place that you 
believe is safe, Madam Speaker, is as 
old as the Bible itself. Remember, 
Madam Speaker, Moses’ mother put 
her child in a basket and sent him 
down the Nile because that was the 
way to save his life. When we think of 
that, let’s remember the tears and the 
pain in the heart of every parent who 
sets out on that journey to seek asy-
lum; and let’s remember that it is the 
law of this land; it is the law of the 
United States and of the world to allow 
asylum and to grant asylum when you 
fear for your lives. 
What we have now is a broken sys-
tem. Trump took a sledge hammer to 
it. But we must demand that it be put 
back together. 
So, Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for sharing his thoughts with 
the Nation today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). I thank the gentlewoman for 
serving as the chair of the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus that allows 
us to have this conversation here 
today. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman TERESA LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. It has been a joy in Con-
gress to have the gentlewoman’s voice, 
to have her passion, and to have her 
advocacy. This is what makes me so 
proud to be the chair of the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus because of 
the words, the passion, and the advo-
cacy of Representative BOWMAN, of 
Congresswoman LEGER FERNANDEZ, and 
of our 94 other members who are part 
of the Progressive Caucus. The Special 
Order hour that we host for this Pro-
gressive Caucus is about the issues 
that matter to the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus. 
Let me be very clear, progressives 
have been at the forefront of fighting 
for comprehensive immigration reform 
for a very long time. Our Progressive 
Caucus is extremely diverse. We have 
members who are part of the Hispanic 
Caucus, part of the Asian-American 
Caucus, and part of the Black Caucus. 
The reality is that we represent the 
diversity that is immigration today in 
this country. 
Madam Speaker, when I think about 
immigration, this is very personal to 
me for multiple reasons. I am an immi-
grant myself. I am one of only two 
dozen Members of Congress who serve 
in Congress who is a naturalized cit-
izen. When I came to Congress in 2017, 
there were actually only six of us at 
that time. Then it moved to 12, and 
now it moved to 24. It is good that we 
are here and that we are representing 
the voice of immigrants who come 
from all over the world seeking refuge 
because that is the identity that the 
United States has as a place to seek 
refuge. 
I came here when I was 16 by myself. 
My parents just had a few thousand 
dollars in their bank account, and they 
used all of it to send me, their child, 
across the ocean by myself at the age 
of 16 because they believed that this 
was the place that I would have the 
most opportunity. 
But it isn’t just that. It was 20 years 
ago that in Washington State I started 
what was a grass-roots effort to orga-
nize against the Bush administration 
at that time cracking down on immi-
grants, Arab Americans, Muslim Amer-
icans, and South Asian Americans and 
curtailing civil liberties. That was the 
moment that I got involved in grass- 
roots organizing around immigration 
issues and ended up starting and found-
ing what became the largest immigrant 
advocacy organization in Washington 
State and one of the largest in the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, if John Lewis were 
here, he would tell you that the first 
thing that I said to him when I came 
on to the floor is: You taught me how 
to make good trouble. 
The reason is because I, too, got ar-
rested multiple times fighting for im-
migration reform in civil disobedience 
that was about calling attention to the 
pain of the country when we treat im-
migrants with the cruelty that we have 
treated immigrants with both Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations 
through the past to today. 
Yes, Donald Trump did something to 
the immigration system that was be-
yond anything that had been done be-
fore. But we should be clear that much 
of the cruelty has existed prior to the 
Trump administration coming in going 
back to the exclusionary history of im-
migration law in America, but then 
also continuing through what was 
called welfare reform. That was the so- 
called immigration reform that actu-
ally began the criminalization of immi-
grants in the United States. 
So the work that we do here in Con-
gress as Representatives of our commu-
nities on so many levels is incredibly 
important, because we get to change 
the conversation about what the issue 
is and what we need to do. We also get 
to 
change 
the 
conversation 
about 
where to put the priority for legislative 
fixes to the issues that we are facing. 
We have an opportunity coming up in 
the reconciliation package to do the 
right thing for immigrants—not just 
for immigrants, by the way, to do the 
right thing for America, because let’s 
be very, very clear, America would not 
survive without the labor and the toil 
of immigrant communities. That is 
why I am so excited about the oppor-
tunity to actually advance a path to 
citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders, 
essential workers, and farm workers in 
the upcoming reconciliation package. 
This is an opportunity for us to actu-
ally face the truth about who it was 
that kept the country going during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The COVID–19 
pandemic only underscored how our 
communities and our economy rely on 
the work of immigrants. Throughout 
the pandemic, immigrant workers have 
filled a broad swath of duties from 
picking and preparing the food we eat, 
to cleaning our homes and community 
spaces, to serving as front-line medical 
professionals and the heroic teachers 
who educated our kids over Zoom. 
We are talking about an estimated 
5.2 million undocumented immigrants 
who were serving as essential workers, 
nearly 15,000 DACA recipients who have 
pivoted to remote learning as teachers, 
1.7 million immigrants working in the 
food supply industry to put food on our 
tables, and over 200,000 undocumented 
immigrants 
working 
as 
healthcare 
practitioners including as registered 
nurses and home health aides. 
That is why we put as one of our top 
five priorities for the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus in the reconcili-
ation package a roadmap to citizenship 
for these essential workers. 
b 1930 
One million of these undocumented 
essential workers are also Dreamers. 
Just a few weeks ago, a judge in Texas 
cruelly ruled against the DACA pro-
gram, stopping the government from 
processing new applications and, once 
again, throwing the status of hundreds 
of thousands of DACA recipients back 
into limbo. 
This is not what the American people 
want. It was yet another urgent re-
minder about why we need to end the 
filibuster in the Senate and pass the

Dream and Promise Act that we al-
ready passed multiple times in the 
House of Representatives. 
This, though, cannot wait. We cannot 
wait, and so it is time for us to act in 
this upcoming package. 
Further, over 7 million immigrant es-
sential workers do have legal status, 
but they only have temporary status or 
are waiting to adjust their status. 
When we talk about immigrant essen-
tial workers, it is crucial that we rec-
ognize that many of them do have legal 
status and have been waiting—in some 
cases, in waiting lines projected to last 
over 80 years to transition—to a road-
map to citizenship. 
I know that when I became a citizen, 
Madam Speaker, it was after 17 years 
of being on multiple visas. By the time 
I became a U.S. citizen, it was impos-
sible for me to uproot my family, my 
parents, and bring them to the United 
States to be with me. That is why they 
still live in India, and I live here. I 
have not lived on the same continent 
as my parents since I was 16 years old. 
Every 
day, 
essential 
immigrant 
workers put their own health and the 
health of their families at risk, show-
ing up to work on the front lines so 
that we and our families could stay 
safe. They do all of this knowing full 
well that a simple traffic stop could 
tear them away from their families and 
communities, and that should they get 
COVID, they likely wouldn’t have ac-
cess to healthcare. 
For instance, TPS holders have been 
serving on the front lines, even as the 
former President rescinded their TPS 
designation and threatened to rip them 
away from their communities. 
Recognizing 
the tremendous con-
tributions of immigrants, countries 
like France actually acted to expedite 
citizenship for essential immigrant 
workers. Not only is that the right 
thing to do, but it is also good for our 
communities and for our economy. 
Most of these workers have lived 
alongside us as friends and neighbors 
for over a decade. They are deeply root-
ed in our communities. Many have U.S. 
citizen children and family members, 
and tearing them from their homes and 
their families would leave gaping, irre-
placeable holes in communities across 
the country. 
Moreover, if doing the humane thing 
isn’t enough for you, and if doing the 
popular thing isn’t good enough for you 
either, then look at the economic ben-
efit. In 2019, immigrant essential work-
ers had an estimated $860 billion in 
spending power, and that is after pay-
ing up to $239 billion in Federal and 
payroll taxes, as well as an estimated 
$115 billion in State and local taxes. So 
it is clear that immigrants are helping 
to sustain our communities and bolster 
our economies. 
Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman 
and Mr. BOWMAN were talking about 
the importance of going to the border, 
and I just have to recall some of the 
worst cruelty that I saw in the last 4 
years. I was the first Member of Con-
gress to go into a Federal prison where 
mothers and fathers who had been sep-
arated from their children, in many 
cases, babies as young as 3 months old, 
under the previous administration and 
the previous President, when they were 
imprisoned—these parents were impris-
oned and separated from their children. 
When I went to see them, a couple of 
weeks into this crisis, and as the first 
Member of Congress to do so, I met 
with hundreds of parents, mothers and 
fathers who did not know where their 
children were. 
Some of them were given slips of 
paper that had names of children on 
them. But guess what? They weren’t 
their children because DHS had lost all 
trace of which children belonged to 
which parents. 
What we know today is that there are 
still hundreds of children who are sepa-
rated from their parents. Their parents 
have been deported, in some cases, and 
they will never be reunited. This was 
by design. This was cruelty of epic pro-
portions perpetrated by the last Presi-
dent and everybody who went along 
with those policies. Not all Repub-
licans did, by the way. 
I remember when Laura Bush spoke 
out against this and said this is not 
who America is. Well, I have a different 
perspective on that because we have 
had a lot of things happen in America 
that remind us that we have a bad side 
to America as well. 
But we have resilience. We have ref-
uge. We have humanity. When that 
trumps, that is the best of America. 
The reality is, Madam Speaker, I 
went down to the border, as well, mul-
tiple times. In fact, I see my colleague 
over here. I think he called me—I for-
get what he called me, but I think he 
called me a Congresswoman coyote. 
No, I am not yielding to you, Mr. 
GAETZ. But I appreciated that because 
I helped children across the border as a 
Member of Congress. 
How could anybody be against that? 
These were children traveling alone. 
Had I not been there, as a Member of 
Congress, they wouldn’t have gotten 
over and been able to be processed be-
cause the last administration actually 
closed all the ports of entry. 
When I went to Tijuana and met with 
so many of these people—I remember a 
15-year-old boy who had been shot in 
his knee. His mother said to him to 
just go as quickly as he can because his 
brother had already been killed by 
gangs. Just go. Just go. Just try to get 
there. 
This was a strapping young boy, and 
he wept as he played me the message 
that his mother had left him so that he 
could listen to it over and over again in 
the shelter that he was in to get away 
from gangs and violence. 
This is what we are dealing with. 
That is why I have introduced the 
Roadmap to Freedom resolution, which 
lays out a positive vision of who Amer-
ica is, and who we should be, and who 
we can be if we continue to embrace 
those roots by which everybody came 
here, unless you were Native American. 
Either you came enslaved on ships 
against your will and were forced to 
work and your labor was taken, or you 
came as an immigrant in some cat-
egory. 
The reality is, Madam Speaker, there 
are many things that we have to do. 
Thank goodness this new administra-
tion closed the Irwin Detention Center, 
where women were being sterilized 
without their consent. Thank goodness 
that for-profit, private detention cen-
ter was closed in Georgia. 
We had that resolution—that was my 
resolution—on the floor. And do you 
know what? It passed with bipartisan 
support. Members on the other side of 
the aisle, as well, couldn’t stomach 
that. 
We have an opportunity here to do 
something really tremendous in the 
next reconciliation package. I know 
firsthand that our immigration story is 
one of struggle and resilience. Immi-
grants push boulders up mountains, 
and we succeed because we have to. 
There is no other option for us. 
It is that strength of courage that 
comes out of struggle that is what de-
fines America, defines immigrants in 
America. So, I look forward to doing 
everything I can to make sure that the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus con-
tinues to push for bold, progressive im-
migration reform and that we make 
sure that we get a path to citizenship 
for our essential workers who have 
been taking care of all of us through 
this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive LEGER FERNANDEZ for her tremen-
dous work, her leadership, her heart, 
and her passion. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
JAYAPAL, and I really do appreciate the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus’ sup-
port for making sure that we include 
immigration reform in the reconcili-
ation. 
We can do that because it has a di-
rect economic benefit to this country, 
and it has a direct economic benefit 
that will be reflected in the budget. 
And we support it. 
But I think the other thing to re-
member is the country supports it. The 
support for doing immigration reform 
is huge. Sixty-seven percent of voters 
support the DREAM Act. Eighty-three 
percent of Americans support a path-
way 
to 
citizenship 
for 
immigrant 
youth. Sixty-five percent of voters sup-
port 
citizenship 
for 
undocumented 
farmworkers. 
It is something that the country sup-
ports because they understand that im-
migrants, they are us. They live with 
us and care for us and are us. Ameri-
cans know that, and they support that. 
So, then, we must ask, why are we 
not doing this? We will work on that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) 
to tell us the stories and to raise her 
voice about the immigrant experience. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I am a 
proud child of immigrants.

July 29, 2021 
Both of my parents immigrated from 
Palestine. My dad’s journey actually 
was from Palestine as a young boy, and 
he grew up, his teenage years, in Nica-
ragua. From Nicaragua, at 19 years old, 
he came to the United States. 
My father, with a fourth grade edu-
cation, couldn’t ever experience human 
dignity anywhere except until he came 
here and worked for Ford Motor Com-
pany and became part of the United 
Auto Workers, the UAW. That is when 
he felt, for the first time, human dig-
nity in the workplace. 
My father, in the 1970s, used to be in 
Detroit, on the corners. If you came up 
to him before he got to Ford, he would 
pull up his arm and say, ‘‘Which watch 
you want?’’ Because he hustled. That is 
how he provided for his family. 
My mother only went up to eighth 
grade because she was trying to pro-
vide for her family, which is a farming 
family in Palestine. When she came to 
this country, pregnant with me, never 
could they have imagined their daugh-
ter ever becoming a United States Con-
gress Member and coming here with 
that 
lived 
experience 
and 
under-
standing the importance of bringing 
truly loving and caring farm immi-
grant neighbors. 
The human impact on doing nothing 
in regard to immigration is real. I grew 
up in Southwest Detroit—20 different 
ethnicities. I want you all to know 
what that feels like, right? 
I mean, this is a majority Black city 
with a little bit of beautiful Brown 
spice here and there. I mean, it was 
just incredible to grow up in such a di-
verse community, where I felt like it 
made me a better mother, a better ad-
vocate, a better American because, at 
that moment, I appreciated things that 
my immigrant neighbors had seen 
through their lens and my Black neigh-
bors through their experience in this 
country as they were fighting against 
racism, and continue to do so, and dis-
crimination. 
It is so incredibly important, as we 
think about this, not to allow others to 
fear our immigrant neighbors, to allow 
our country and policies to blame them 
for everything wrong in our country, 
when we all know they helped build it. 
I also want to take a moment be-
cause I think it is incredibly important 
to know that I grew up in a border 
community. Right there in Detroit, on 
the other side, you can see Canada. 
What does that mean? Because people 
focus on the southern border. What 
that means is Border Patrol and immi-
gration enforcement is right there in 
our community. 
Why this is important is because I 
want you all to know, as they are sup-
posed to be patrolling that border, 
making sure that illegal drugs and sub-
stances don’t come in, that is not what 
they did. This very, very broken Cus-
toms and Border Patrol system and 
structure in place is so racialized that 
they turned on this beautiful South-
west Detroit community. They turned 
on my Latino neighbors. They turned 
on my Muslim brothers and sisters, 
many of them just trying to experience 
and live in this border community. 
A 9-year-old ACLU investigation of 
Customs and Border Patrol operations 
in Michigan revealed just how incred-
ibly racist the agency is. The report re-
vealed that, even though CBP’s man-
dated mission is to police the border, 
only 1.3 percent of their cases in Michi-
gan involved attempted entries from 
Canada that were illegal. Ninety-six 
percent of those arrested by CBP in 
Michigan were recorded by agents of 
being nonwhite. 
Now, I want to explain this to you 
all. My block club president, this beau-
tiful Cuban, Black, mixed person, he is 
an incredible advocate. He works in the 
auto industry. He is out there with this 
guy from Germany coming in on a vis-
itor visa. He is in this car, and he is 
showing them the border, the river-
front, just the walkway, and just show-
ing: Hey, that is Canada. This is my 
community. This is where I live. 
He is driving around and, of course, 
CBP stops him. He goes to the guy who 
is here on a visitor visa: Hey, I know 
you are from Germany. Don’t worry. 
Just have your immigrant documents 
ready and everything. 
But guess what? They didn’t ask the 
guy from Germany for any of his docu-
ments. They asked the U.S.-born cit-
izen, Brown neighbor of mine for those 
immigration documents. 
Not only that, one of my neighbors 
running around in her own local park, 
in her own local park, was asked: 
Where are your papers? 
b 1945 
People are now being asked to carry 
their documents with them, and this 
never happened for a very long time, up 
until about 15 or 20 years ago. To my 
good colleague from New Mexico, you 
should know this. This is a community 
that has never seen these kinds of ICE 
and immigration operations at schools, 
which is illegal. It is against our own 
Federal policies. They were doing them 
near churches. I mean, literally, near 
churches, against their own Federal 
policy. So it is really incredibly impor-
tant to understand just how broken 
those systems are. 
We can continue to talk about the 
contributions and the benefits of immi-
grants and our immigrant neighbors, 
but I don’t want to make it out so—of 
course, it is an economic benefit. Many 
of my colleagues don’t even realize 
that most of the food on the table, 
most the things that are done, are from 
immigrant hands touching it, most of 
it. 
You look around. Everybody knows. 
Everybody knows who is building our 
country. Everybody knows that the ag-
ricultural community and industry re-
lies on our immigrant neighbors. Ev-
eryone knows that. But they don’t 
want to do that. They want somebody 
else to blame. Instead, my colleagues 
want to focus on making a pathway to 
citizenship, one much more humane. 
They are focused on blaming them for 
any economic downfall. 
Guess what? Poverty is increasing, 
not because of our immigrants, but be-
cause we haven’t been able to focus and 
put people before profits. We would 
rather do tax breaks for billionaires in-
stead of actually taking care of our 
neighbors. We try to go ahead and 
blame our Brown and Black commu-
nities for everything going wrong in 
their own neighborhoods. That is just 
not how it works. 
I am here because I also wanted to 
talk about Jakelin, if I may. Jakelin’s 
story was really eye-opening to me as 
to what is really going on at the bor-
der. She was a 7-year-old who died 
shortly after arriving in the United 
States in 2018. 
Jakelin turned 7 years old on her 
2,000-mile journey north through Mex-
ico. She was given her first new pair of 
shoes for this journey. Her and her fa-
ther went north in search of a better 
life and to try to make money to send 
home to Jakelin’s mom and her two 
siblings. Her family is from a tiny vil-
lage in Guatemala, and they lived on 
approximately $7 per day. She was one 
of two children to die in CBP custody 
that month alone. 
I say this because, where is the mo-
rality when it comes to these beautiful 
children that are coming with their 
parents? Where is the morality and un-
derstanding that people are coming 
here for this better opportunity and we 
have no pathway? This broken immi-
gration system is hurting all of us. We 
need to wake up and understand that. 
My beautiful neighbors in southwest 
Detroit always have my back. They are 
the ones when they got up in the morn-
ing who knew where my kids were, 
what was going on in the community. 
They were and still are just an integral 
part of my neighborhood and my com-
munity. When I look around, all I see is 
beauty, people that just want to live 
and thrive in our country. 
I can show all kinds of economic ben-
efit, but it is not enough, because a lot 
of people want to blame my immigrant 
neighbors for everything wrong. And 
everything wrong is not because of 
that; it is because you keep putting 
corporations before our people, period. 
That is it. You look at the budget, you 
see how much we are spending on de-
fense versus how do we address infra-
structure issues? How do we address 
the broken education and inequity in 
our education system? 
I have a school district right now 
where the majority of fountains have 
garbage bags over them because they 
have no clean water coming through in 
our schools. Our kids don’t have clean 
drinking water in schools. That is not 
because of all of these things that they 
keep talking about, about broken im-
migration. No. 
If you look at what President Reagan 
did, President Bush and President Clin-
ton, if you look at what they did, they 
created some sort of pathway. It wasn’t 
perfect. But this constant vilification

needs to stop. It needs to stop, because 
that is the lazy approach. That is the 
lazy approach of legislating in this 
country. 
Come on. I grew up here. You know 
what Detroit and this beautiful Black 
city taught me? You always have the 
backs of the people you represent. You 
focus on helping them get through ev-
eryday issues. You focus on what is 
broken inside, not looking far away 
and saying it is all their fault. Some of 
them are not even here, and they are 
blaming everybody else. Accept the 
fact that we haven’t had the courage to 
stand up and say the economic divide 
in our country is real, that our folks 
are paying the high cost of auto insur-
ance, folks are paying a high cost in a 
number 
of 
issues 
regarding 
their 
homes, regarding the education system 
and so many other systems. 
I am passionate about this because 
not only am I a child of immigrant par-
ents, but I was my mother’s translator 
until I was 12 years old. I still remem-
ber, Madam Speaker, that I went into 
Sears and I was translating for my 
mother and this cashier just looked at 
her and looks at me and looks at her 
and looks at me—and I am 12 years 
old—and she goes: ‘‘She needs to learn 
English.’’ 
I look and smile. Of course, the 
southwest Detroit girl came out of me. 
My head did bob a little bit, and I said: 
‘‘Excuse me, but I am not translating 
what you are saying to my mother. I 
am translating what my mother wants 
to say to you. Why? Because even with 
her heavy accent, you are dehuman-
izing her. You are othering her. You 
are making it like she is less than, 
even though she tries.’’ 
As she beautifully speaks the English 
language, I feel like, my God, like, if 
anything, people should appreciate it 
more. 
So I say this because this lived expe-
rience of my mother, as a naturalized 
American citizen, who is so proud of 
having human dignity here, this free-
dom of raising her daughter who is now 
a 
United 
States 
Congresswoman, 
should be celebrating it and should be 
honoring it. Instead, I know what is 
happening to her in the streets. People 
are yelling at her to take off her hijab, 
vilifying her. That is what we are doing 
to our immigrant neighbors, the same 
ones who pick fruit and put it on our 
tables, who open and revive neighbor-
hoods that have never seen life since 
they came to our communities. 
I am tired of it. I am tired of folks 
using fear-mongering rhetoric to cre-
ate hate towards my immigrant neigh-
bors. 
They are here because our country 
offers something that others don’t. We 
should understand that. We should cre-
ate a humane and fair and just immi-
gration system, not one that hurts 
them and allows children to die, that 
targets women in detention centers, 
and separates our families. It is simply 
wrong. 
The most American thing I could do 
up here is push back and say: Enough. 
We are a Nation of immigrants. All of 
us. I am tired of the hate and the rac-
ism. 
I thank the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus for always speaking that 
truth to power. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I think it is important to re-
member that they are not here just be-
cause we offer something more. Immi-
grants are here because we need them. 
We don’t exist as a country without 
immigrants. They are here because 
they bring music and because they 
bring food and poetry and art and 
laughter. They bring community. 
But they also bring incredible eco-
nomic benefits. I talked earlier about 
the $1.7 trillion over 10 years, the 
438,000 new jobs, the $700 in increased 
wages for everyone, the 6 years of addi-
tional life that we give Social Secu-
rity. All of those are economic bene-
fits. 
Do we know that three-fourths of un-
documented immigrants in the labor 
force are actually essential? That 
means they are the essential workers. 
Not just that. They are healthcare 
workers: 
38 
percent 
of 
the 
home 
healthcare aides caring for our loved 
ones at home, 29 percent of physicians, 
23 percent of pharmacists. They are 
taking care of us. They are keeping us 
healthy. 
Not only that. They are our entre-
preneurs. They are the ones who are 
starting our businesses. Right now, 25 
percent of new firms in America are 
opened by first-generation immigrants. 
The New American Economy reports 
that over 3 million immigrant entre-
preneurs 
employ 
almost 
8 
million 
American workers across the Nation. 
It is immigrants and the children of 
immigrants, who we have just heard, 
who come and serve in Congress, but 
they also start over half of all Fortune 
500 companies. Yet, they are subject to 
the hatred that brought tears to my 
colleague’s eyes. It is not right. 
They are subject to that hatred in 
order to detract us from talking about 
what we need to talk about. What we 
need to talk about is, what we have 
been doing in this Congress when we 
passed the American Rescue Plan. 
Instead of going back and being able 
to tell your communities that we 
passed the American Rescue Plan, help 
is on the way, we are going to be put-
ting shots in arms, and we are going to 
get people back to work and kids back 
in schools—they don’t want to talk 
about that. They want to talk about 
that border. That border is not threat-
ening any of us, but that is what they 
want to talk about because they don’t 
want to get to the work at hand. 
But we are going to get to the work 
at hand, and we are going to push to in-
clude immigration in the reconcili-
ation. 
We heard earlier discussions about 
the manner in which families have 
been torn apart and separated at the 
border by the Trump administration. I 
have a bill that will not only reunify 
those families, but, as a mea culpa, as 
a way of saying we are sorry, we will 
make sure that they actually receive a 
visa and that they receive the kind of 
care that we must do whenever you 
traumatize a young child. They need 
that help. 
We are also going to push to make 
sure that everyone who pays taxes re-
ceives the child tax credit. Those im-
migrant families are working, they are 
paying their taxes, and they were not 
getting the benefit of the child tax 
credit. We are going to make sure that 
we push for that and argue for that. We 
are going to make sure that we high-
light who our immigrant brothers and 
sisters are, because they are us. 
I want to remind us here today that 
back when this country was founded, 
even with all of its faults and flaws and 
original sins in how we started, that 
even back then, when our Founders 
talked about what this House should 
look like, they said that it should be a 
mirror, a portrait of America. They 
said that we should make sure that 
Congress has the right to pass the laws 
regarding how we vote us into office, 
because they did not trust those 
States. This was back at the founding. 
They did not trust those States be-
cause they knew that they would fight 
against having our House look like a 
miniature of the American people, a 
portrait. 
That is the other thing that we are 
going to fight to do, to make sure that 
we get the voting rights in H.R. 1 
passed and H.R. 4 passed, because that 
is how we also continue to push for im-
migration reform. We know America 
wants it. We talked about those polls, 
83 percent, 67 percent. There is great, 
great support for that. It is only be-
cause we are not able to truly exercise 
our democratic values of self-govern-
ance that we have not yet passed it. 
But we have this moment in rec-
onciliation. We have this moment. It is 
a priority of the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus. It is a priority of the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus. It is a 
priority of so many of our colleagues. 
So I am incredibly hopeful. 
I am looking forward to listening to 
the President’s words, after a recent 
meeting with the Congressional His-
panic Caucus, to tell us that he will 
also be supporting this. 
We call upon the Senate to support 
immigration reform in the reconcili-
ation act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

us, that those who would cross our bor-
der illegally carry with them their 
laughter and poetry. 
Unfortunately, laughter and poetry 
is not the only thing they are bringing. 
On the edges of that laughter, they are 
carrying COVID, more and more of 
them, unable to be tested, screened, 
vaccinated because so many are being 
invited across our border illegally it is 
straining the flow. 
In their poetry, they are carrying the 
rhymes of MS–13; and in their bags, 
they are carrying too much fentanyl, 
too much death for our fellow Ameri-
cans. 
I listened carefully as the gentle-
woman from Washington smeared our 
CBP officers as racist, which is quite 
something considering how many of 
them are non-White. 
I spent time with them recently. My 
colleague who is with me this evening, 
Congresswoman GREENE, spent time 
with many of our CBP officers re-
cently, and they are patriotic Ameri-
cans who deserve better from every 
Member of Congress than they just 
heard. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
also talked about her visit to a Federal 
detention 
facility 
under 
President 
Trump. Imagine that. A Republican 
President, a Democrat Congresswoman, 
and a desire to oversee and inspect the 
operations of our government. I am 
glad that Ms. JAYAPAL, the gentle-
woman from Washington, was afforded 
that opportunity. 
But, unfortunately, today I was not. 
Congresswoman GREENE was not. Con-
gressman 
GOHMERT, 
Congressman 
GOSAR. We were labeled trespassers by 
Federal employees of the Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons. 
Now, there is a great deal I want to 
discuss about the need for oversight 
with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
specific circumstances regarding Janu-
ary 6 detainees, but before having that 
thorough discussion, I would yield to 
my colleague, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) to offer any re-
marks 
regarding 
the 
mischaracterizations of our brave Bor-
der Patrol officers and the crisis at our 
border that Democrats would ignore as 
they create a pathway for citizenship 
for people who did not come here le-
gally. I yield to the gentlewoman. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, it was very concerning to me 
to hear my colleague describe Border 
Patrol as treating people that are com-
ing across our border illegally, dif-
ferently because of their skin color, be-
cause that is not what I witnessed in 
my recent visit at the border of Cali-
fornia and Mexico. 
As a matter of fact, I am very proud 
to report to this House and to the 
American people that the Border Pa-
trol agents that I spoke with and 
talked to, that the detention facility 
that I visited is amazing, and I am very 
proud of our country. 
America is the most generous coun-
try in the world. There is no other 
country on this planet that allows hun-
dreds of thousands of people to try to 
enter their country, cross their border 
against their laws, and then treat them 
so well. 
The detention center I visited in 
California houses 1,100 illegal aliens at 
the cost of $73 million to the American 
taxpayers, and that detention facility 
was immaculate. 
The people being held in this deten-
tion center have the right to talk to 
attorneys any time they want. They 
have an entire library filled with books 
and resources and computers so that 
they can educate themselves. They 
have translators of every language 
whenever they need them. They have 
food, they can request food any time 
they want to eat. They can go outside 
in the fresh air and the sunshine any 
time they want to. 
They have laundry facilities. They 
have a gym. They have a full-sized bas-
ketball court. It was beautiful. They 
have 
iPads 
that 
they 
can 
speak 
through FaceTime technology to their 
family members and their attorneys 
any time they need to while they await 
their request for amnesty or while they 
await their court date because they 
broke laws in our country. 
These are illegal aliens that are not 
taxpayers, that are not citizens, and 
they are treated so well. But my good 
colleague here from Florida and I, 
along with our other colleagues, Con-
gressman LOUIE
GOHMERT, Congress-
man PAUL GOSAR, we visited a Federal 
prison right here in Washington, D.C. 
today where we were told in the lobby 
that we were trespassing. 
As Members of Congress, it is our 
duty for oversight over these types of 
facilities. We vote to fund them, and it 
is our duty and our right to go there 
and check on the circumstances of peo-
ple and the type of facility and the 
maintenance and the order and the 
care that the inmates are receiving. 
I know this is something that is par-
ticularly of interest to you and some of 
your colleagues, but today we didn’t 
see that. As a matter of fact, I would 
say the lobby of this prison was not in 
anywhere near the conditions as far as 
cleanliness and order that I saw in the 
detention center in California. 
I yield back to Mr. GAETZ to explain 
that further. 
Mr. GAETZ. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. We have an obliga-
tion here to approach issues in a bipar-
tisan fashion when it is opportune. 
On the issue of prison reform, Repub-
licans and Democrats joined together 
to pass the First Step Act. It was, in 
fact, the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. JEFFRIES) who led the Democrat 
effort in that endeavor. 
The essence of that is equality and 
access to information. Republican ad-
ministrations shouldn’t bar Democrats 
from being able to have reasonable ob-
servations of the ongoing workings of 
our government and, similarly, the 
Biden government should not have the 
opportunity to exclude Republicans. 
It begs the question why were we 
there. Following January 6, which was 
not a good day for our country, which 
included violence that all of us con-
demn, there has been an unprecedented 
targeting of Americans who have a par-
ticular viewpoint. 
Their bank records are turned over to 
Federal authorities by financial insti-
tutions they thought they could trust. 
They have seen themselves ripped from 
their bed at night, pulled out of their 
places of employment, harassed, ques-
tioned. 
Many of these people were not even 
in Washington, D.C. on January 6, but 
maybe they forwarded the wrong e- 
mail or liked the wrong photo or 
shared the wrong meme. 
What is happening in America where 
we take these exquisite national secu-
rity authorities and we turn them in-
ward on our own people? 
We have two principal areas of con-
cern. First, are the January 6 detainees 
given access to evidence? We don’t pre-
judge for a moment the innocence or 
guilt of anyone beyond the American 
principle that everyone is innocent 
until proven guilty. 
But access to exculpatory evidence 
could show interesting things. It could 
show that there was a difference be-
tween those who believed they were 
being part of a fully peaceful endeavor 
and those who might have been ani-
mating violence. 
The 14,000 hours of tape could also 
show us who was animating that vio-
lence, whether they were connected in 
any way, directed in any way by Fed-
eral agencies. 
It raises great suspicion that we are 
not able to get access to this informa-
tion as Members of Congress. It raises 
even more suspicion that people de-
prived of their liberty right now, in the 
absence of any conviction, cannot get 
that very information. 
The second category of concern deals 
with the treatment of people in our 
Federal facilities. As Congresswoman 
GREENE and I arrived at the Federal fa-
cility in Washington today, we did not 
prejudge whether all of the people in 
that facility were January 6 detainees 
or might have been there for some 
other reason. 
I often find on a congressional dele-
gation you learn a lot maybe that you 
didn’t particularly even show up to 
learn by virtue of having boots on the 
ground and having that real-time, ef-
fective, roll-up-your-sleeves style of 
oversight. 
We have heard unconfirmed reports 
of beatings, of deprivation of access to 
nutrition, to religious services, to 
counsel. As I stand here today on the 
floor, I am embarrassed to have to 
admit to my constituents, I don’t know 
the answers to those questions because 
the Attorney General won’t answer 
them. 
He won’t show up in the Judiciary 
Committee for an oversight hearing. 
He won’t show up to the Oversight 
Committee. When we show up at the

Department of Justice, he won’t an-
swer our questions, and when we show 
up at the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
instead of giving answers, instead of 
providing a tour, which is exactly what 
Republican and Democrat administra-
tions have done in years past, they said 
we were the problem. 
It begs the question, why would peo-
ple charged with misdemeanors be held 
in a Federal facility if otherwise that 
same Federal indexing would result in 
release with the bail system or on 
someone’s own recognizance or with 
supervised release. 
Congresswoman GREENE, here’s my 
concern and hypothesis that I hope 
isn’t true, that this Biden government 
wants so badly to have the specter of 
January 6 function as some sort of 
basis to continue targeting our fellow 
Americans that they would use people 
as political props, that they would de-
viate from otherwise standard prac-
tices in sentencing and in pretrial be-
havior so that they can continue this 
fiction that somehow we are under this 
grave national security threat from 
MAGA or white supremacy or America 
First or whatever the new smear of the 
day is. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia for the purpose of engaging in 
a colloquy with me. 
Congresswoman, do you have a per-
spective on why the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Pris-
ons seem so willing to deviate from 
their normal practices with these oth-
erwise pedestrian crimes in the in-
stances of people who did not engage in 
violence? 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. GAETZ, 
I believe that is a great question. My 
fear is that this country, our agen-
cies—the FBI, the Department of Jus-
tice, and other agencies, intelligence 
agencies—are taking a two-tiered track 
to justice in the United States of 
America, one where Trump supporters 
are being targeted—these are the sto-
ries we are hearing over and over and 
over again, which is why we are asking 
questions; questions need to be asked— 
compared to the catch-and-release that 
we have seen with antifa and BLM. 
You see, I haven’t heard stories of big 
tech 
combing 
through 
antifa 
and 
BLM’s 
social 
media 
pages, 
their 
friends’ pages, their family’s pages, 
reading text messages. I haven’t heard 
stories, I haven’t seen it on the news. 
I would like to see it if there are 
some, but I have not heard stories of 
antifa members and BLM members who 
rioted in the streets, who looted, who 
attacked police officers, Federal monu-
ments, police precincts. 
I haven’t heard stories of them being 
kept in jail for long periods of time 
with no idea of when their court date 
is. I haven’t heard stories of Repub-
lican Members of Congress sharing bail 
bond links, encouraging fund-raising to 
get these January 6 detainees out of 
jail. 
You see, I haven’t heard those sto-
ries, and I am interested if there are 
some, but I haven’t heard them. I have 
only heard the stories targeted at 
Trump supporters and people that com-
mitted violence here at the Capitol. 
Another question that I have, Mr. 
GAETZ, and maybe you have seen it. I 
haven’t. I haven’t seen or heard of one 
of these detainees or any of the arrests 
charged with insurrection, yet this is 
the term that we hear over and over 
again. But do you know, Mr. GAETZ, if 
there have been any charges of insur-
rection? 
Mr. GAETZ. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding back. I am unaware 
of any such charge. The charges that 
concern me most are the charges that 
are misdemeanor in nature that would 
normally result in a very quick pass 
through the criminal justice system, 
and then having someone go on with 
their lives. 
Those charges are resulting in en-
hanced confinement, conditions that 
are not observable, and civil rights 
that are not identifiable when we are 
inquisitive to the United States De-
partment of Justice. 
The gentlewoman from Georgia com-
pares, perhaps improperly, the BLM 
riots of the past summer with the cir-
cumstances of January 6. I mean, doz-
ens of people died as a result of the 
BLM riots. This was not the case at the 
Capitol. We are not for violence of any 
kind. 
There are plenty of places in the 
world, like Cuba, where political vio-
lence is necessary. By the way, the 
very same BLM crowd that was burn-
ing down America, that was calling 
this Nation racist, they have totally 
embraced the Cuban regime. So I guess 
socialism runs thicker than politics, 
runs thicker than blood, for sure. 
So with the Department of Justice 
under, frankly, both President Trump 
and President Biden unwilling to treat 
the BLM terrorism for what it was, to 
then turn on people who potentially 
were not violent, charging them, hold-
ing them, depriving them of the normal 
array of civil rights that we would af-
ford any American, it does make it 
harder to make the American case to 
the world. 
We have already seen global leaders 
suggest that whatever their human 
rights violations, hey, America’s got 
folks from January 6 locked up, so 
Vladimir Putin can kill his enemies, so 
other despots can justify the horren-
dous things they do to their people. 
In the words of one of our late, great 
chairmen in this body, we are better 
than this. We should be better than 
this. 
But we did not find better today. 
Today we found a Federal Government 
that was arrogant and recalcitrant. 
b 2015 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) 
to perhaps opine on the conditions we 
think people might be suffering based 
on the attitude we encountered today. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
My concern is this, Madam Speaker: 
We let the jail know that we would be 
there, just like we let the Department 
of Justice know that we were coming 
ahead of time. We have sent letters and 
asked many questions. 
The questions I had today were sim-
ple questions, just questions about 
what time do they get their food? What 
kind of food do they get? Do they have 
access to religious materials or a cler-
gyman or woman of their choice? Sim-
ple questions. When do they get to go 
outside? I just had simple questions 
like that. 
Of course, being in this Chamber 
when January 6 happened, it was a day 
that I did not like. I was very upset by 
it. I was scared by it. There have been 
over 500 people charged for things that 
they had done here at the Capitol. And 
I am very much interested in their 
right to due process, and they deserve 
their day in court. 
But the issue for me is this: I just 
couldn’t believe the defiance in the at-
titude of the people that worked in the 
prison, because I never saw that atti-
tude in any other place that I visited 
as a Member of Congress, which hasn’t 
been long. Of course, it has only been 7 
months. But when I visited the deten-
tion center in California, all of the peo-
ple there were so proud of where they 
work and the job that they are doing 
and how they are taking care of the il-
legal aliens that are being kept at the 
detention center. But we didn’t see 
that in the people that work there. 
As a matter of fact, we saw an atti-
tude in front of cameras, in front of the 
press. They gave us an attitude of defi-
ance and told us that we were tres-
passing. And then when we walked out-
side to speak to the person who we 
thought was a supervisor, they locked 
the door and would not let us back in. 
We were simply there not only to ask 
questions about the January 6 detain-
ees, but also just about the prison over-
all because this is an important part of 
our job, oversight as Members of Con-
gress. 
So that was really concerning to me, 
that they would display this behavior 
in front of the press that we had no 
right to be there, that we were tres-
passers and they locked us out. So that 
gives me great concern that they don’t 
care about what anyone thinks and 
they give no authority to Members of 
Congress. 
Mr. GAETZ. And speaking of not car-
ing, would the gentlewoman reflect on 
her concern about showing up at the 
Department of Justice and being de-
prived of access even to the lobby for a 
meeting with a senior official like the 
Attorney General. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Yes. That 
was my first time visiting the Depart-
ment of Justice, and we had let them 
know ahead of time, Mr. GAETZ, Mr. 
GOHMERT, Mr. GOSAR, Mr. BIGGS, and I, 
many of us had let them know. We 
have been asking questions for months.

July 29, 2021 
We let them know about our visit, and 
we are standing on the sidewalk out-
side the door, and we weren’t even al-
lowed past the bike racks to even go 
near the door. And then we weren’t 
even invited into the lobby while we 
waited to find out if there was someone 
we could speak to. 
Now, for me that was concerning. I 
have had a lot of death threats. I have 
had all kinds of threats on my life, my 
husband, 
my 
children, 
terrifying 
things. And as we were standing on the 
sidewalk, I could see many people com-
ing down going each way. And I 
couldn’t believe that. I was like why 
would the Department of Justice leave 
Members of Congress out here on the 
sidewalk in the open in the middle of a 
city and not bring us in the lobby just 
to wait to see if we had questions an-
swered. And not only as a Member of 
Congress but as a woman, I just 
couldn’t understand why we were left 
out there. 
So that was very alarming to me. 
And then just to be never given an an-
swer; no one to come and speak to us. 
We just had simple questions. They’re 
not difficult questions. We are just ask-
ing how this is being investigated. And 
then we want to know why are these 
other riots not being investigated, be-
cause that truly affected the American 
people. 
You see, January 6 affected the Cap-
itol and Congress, but all the riots all 
year long affected the American peo-
ple. It affected their businesses that 
they worked so hard in. It affected 
their jobs. It affected their commu-
nities. It burned their communities. It 
cost them so much money. There are 
many people that died. There are offi-
cers that have injuries that they will 
never recover from and billions and bil-
lions of dollars in damage. So I am 
very concerned about that two-tier 
track justice system that should not 
exist in our country because, Mr. 
GAETZ, this is the type of stuff we see 
in Communist China, Communist Cuba, 
and I have great concern and fear of 
that in the United States of America. 
Mr. GAETZ: It certainly is some-
thing, having listened to our Demo-
cratic colleagues for years suggest that 
President Trump was this grave danger 
to our institutions, that our institu-
tions would fall under a time of rising 
economic activity and a rising sense of 
patriotism, and more productive sec-
tors of our economy growing. But it 
seems to me that the Biden adminis-
tration is doing far more damage to 
our institutions by concealing their ac-
tions, by deviating from normal stand-
ards of justice and process, and by hav-
ing an approach that is more indicative 
of regimes that don’t really respect 
checks and balances and balance of 
power and institutional development 
and growth. 
I note that we are joined by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT.) 
Judge Gohmert has spent time on the 
bench, and is now a senior member of 
the House Judiciary Committee. As a 
judge he has toured a number of correc-
tions facilities. As a senior member of 
the Judiciary Committee he has been 
involved in drafting legislation that 
deal with our Federal prison system. 
And he joined Congresswoman GREENE 
and I both at the Department of Jus-
tice and at the Federal Bureau of Pris-
ons facility today and received pre-
cisely the same treatment we did. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) to 
reflect on those experiences. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Florida for yield-
ing. I was quite shocked at the treat-
ment we received. When people who 
have oversight and are responsible for 
voting to fund or not fund Federal fa-
cilities like the one we visited, I am 
not used to having somebody make 
such an overt effort to hide everything 
they are doing to the extent that they 
would lure us outside so they could 
lock the door. And there were lawyers, 
there were defendants, there were peo-
ple going through the main entrance 
we did, yet because we are Members of 
Congress, they locked the door after 
accusing us of being trespassers, which 
is a crime. And so, we may want to 
look at who it is that was calling us 
trespassers. Obviously they have got 
some serious training that they need to 
go through. 
But this is nothing new and this has 
nothing to do with January 6, other 
than we have been alerted that there 
are people that are being mistreated. 
I have been alerted to people being 
mistreated before and took action to 
see if that was true. I don’t care what 
their political leanings are. If they are 
being 
mistreated, 
then 
something 
needs to be done. 
Back when President George W. Bush 
was in office and there were abuses by 
the Justice Department, I was com-
pletely on the side of the Democrats. 
There is no place for that kind of 
thing, abusing people’s civil rights. 
And we have been belittled here on the 
House floor, all of us here, and accused 
of trying to belittle what occurred on 
January 6. No, there were some atro-
cious things that happened, and there 
needs to be punishment for that. But 
there is and has been concern that 
there were people that didn’t even 
know they were doing anything wrong, 
and in some cases were not doing any-
thing wrong have had their homes in-
vaded and had their door busted open. 
One constituent last week called my 
office here in Washington to say that 
she was in east Texas on January 5, 6, 
and 7, all relevant times. She had no 
thought of coming to Washington. She 
did have a picture of Trump on 
Facebook. Her nephew texted her: Hey, 
I saw this picture. The FBI is asking 
who it is, and I wondered if maybe she 
looked familiar. 
And apparently, it looked very simi-
lar to this woman, and he thought his 
aunt would get a kick out of that, so he 
sends the text with this picture. And 
she says: Gee, it does look like me. 
LOL. Don’t turn me in. 
Days later she has a visit from two 
FBI agents who demand to know where 
she was January 6. 
Well, now as I understand it, the only 
contact she had with the events of Jan-
uary 6 was her nephew sending her that 
text message. And then FBI agents 
show up. She was not that woman, and 
you could see the difference. But some-
body had to have been monitoring 
those text messages. 
That was something that got me bent 
out of shape back in the second term of 
President Bush. You can’t just go spy-
ing on American citizens. It is not 
right. And I guess it is possible that 
they got a FISA warrant to spy on an 
American citizen, but I would have 
hoped that the FISA judges would be a 
little more circumspect after we found 
out how abusive those FISA judges 
have been with just signing off on any-
thing the DOJ wants in the way of war-
rants. 
The Constitution requires specificity, 
particularity. You have got to describe 
the thing to be searched, the thing to 
be seized. And we had seen from one 
that WikiLeaks let go on Verizon, they 
said: Yeah, we just want everything 
Verizon has. 
And the judge said: Oh, they want ev-
erything Verizon has on its customers; 
okay. Signs the warrant. 
We cannot keep a republic with 
judges that have that much disdain or 
inconsideration of the Constitution 
they are sworn to follow. And the fact 
that no FISA judge got bent out of 
shape after being lied to by DOJ and 
the FBI is another indication we have 
got a tremendous amount of cleaning 
up to do to save our republic.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
well, as we all know, last night, the 
Senate voted by a substantial margin 
to move forward with a debate on a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. I want to 
commend the group of Senators who 
worked with President Biden to reach a 
deal. The agreement will ultimately 
dedicate over a trillion dollars to 
strengthening virtually every major 
category of our country’s fiscal infra-
structure. 
The vote last night also means that 
the Senate is on track to reach the 
two-track goal I laid out for this 
Chamber at the beginning of the 
month. The first track is the bipar-
tisan bill focused on traditional, brick- 
and-mortar 
infrastructure 
projects. 
The second track is a budget reconcili-
ation bill where Democrats will make 
historic investments in American jobs, 
American families, and efforts to fight 
climate change. 
In order to start work on a reconcili-
ation bill, the Senate must pass a 
budget resolution first, and we are on 
track for that as well. 
It has been my goal to pass both the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill and a 
budget resolution during this work pe-
riod. Some pundits have called that a 
tall order. I understand that. But be-
cause of the vote last night, the Senate 
is now moving forward with the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, and we are on 
track to pass both elements of the two- 
track strategy before we adjourn for 
the August recess. It took some prod-
ding and a few deadlines, but it all has 
worked out for the better. 
I want to take a step back and ex-
plain why these two bills are so impor-
tant at this moment. For the past 2 
years at the end of the Trump Presi-
dency, the country was angry, divided, 
plagued by COVID, and our economy 
was stuck in the muck. The COVID 
washed over our country like a plague 
and was met by staggering incom-
petence from the Trump administra-
tion. America was sick, dying, and our 
economy was in shambles. 
The discovery of the vaccine played 
no small part in our country’s recov-
ery. We Democrats pushed early on, 
last February and March—not this past 
one but a year ago—to increase funding 
for BARDA. Even then, the Trump ad-
ministration was sort of being stingy 
about that money, but we got the 
money done. And the vaccine, as I said, 
played no small part in our country’s 
recovery. 
But elections have consequences. I 
say that to the American people. Elec-
tions have consequences. When we ran 
as Senate Democrats, when President 
Biden ran, we promised we would get 
the vaccines out; we would get the 
country’s economy moving again; we 
would give hope to the middle class and 
those struggling to get to the middle 
class, where hope had been a distant 
and hazy frame on their horizon pre-
viously. 
The Biden administration came in. 
We came in as a Senate majority. We 
immediately set to work beating the 
pandemic, with a relentless focus on 
getting the country vaccinated and 
getting our country back to normal. 
Congressional 
Democrats 
swiftly 
passed the bold, strong American Res-
cue Plan, one of the largest Federal 
packages in American history, to keep

families, businesses, and workers afloat 
until the country could reopen. And we 
have done that. Six months into the 
Biden administration and Democratic 
majorities in the House and Senate, 
the country has stabilized. 
This morning—this morning—it was 
reported that in the second quarter, 
the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 6.5 
percent, erasing all of the losses from 
the COVID pandemic. It happened a lot 
quicker and a lot sooner than many an-
ticipated. 
Let me repeat that because it is 
great news. Under President Biden and 
Democratic House and Senate majori-
ties, the economy recovered so fast this 
year that we have already erased the 
losses in growth that we experienced as 
a result of the COVID pandemic. That 
is very good news. 
It certainly doesn’t mean every fam-
ily is back on their feet yet. It cer-
tainly doesn’t mean our work is com-
plete. But the American economy is 
back. It is thriving and set for even 
brighter days ahead. 
Again, elections have consequences. 
There is such a difference between the 
bumbling, nasty, divisive last 2 years 
of the Trump administration and a new 
Democratic majority in the House and 
the Senate and a Democratic Presi-
dent. 
Vaccines are out there, as we prom-
ised to get them. There are still some 
people resisting taking a vaccine. They 
should. We have had some resistance 
even from ideological rightwingers, 
which is just awful. Vaccines are out 
there. 
Money has been pumped into the 
economy through the ARP, and things 
are moving forward, but now is not the 
time to rest on our laurels. Now is the 
time to press forward to cement these 
gains and build on them. We must con-
tinue encouraging vaccinations. We 
must keep a very close eye on the 
Delta variant and take necessary pre-
cautions. But we also must address the 
underlying structural economic condi-
tions that held back the middle class 
and those trying to get there even be-
fore the pandemic. 
The American dream—that if you 
work hard, you will be doing better 10 
years from now than you are doing 
today and your kids will be doing still 
better than you—was fading for the 
last 20 years. If you look at the eco-
nomic statistics, they show that that 
dimmer view the American people had 
was accurate in terms of economic cir-
cumstances. 
But now we need to get bright and 
sunny again. We need to return to the 
bright, sunny American optimism that 
has been so much a part of our char-
acter for more than two centuries. And 
how do we do it? We don’t just sit on 
our hands. We don’t just say: Let busi-
nesses take care of it. They won’t. 
They have a different mission. 
A massive investment in public infra-
structure will create tens of thousands 
of good-paying jobs. That is just what 
the doctor ordered. And we need to go 
beyond that to restore that bright, 
sunny optimism. We need to help 
American families keep up with the ex-
orbitant costs of childcare, healthcare, 
housing, college, and more. We need to 
press on and fight to reverse climate 
change because, as bad as COVID was, 
if we do nothing about climate change, 
a few years from now, each year will be 
worse than COVID, and each year after 
that will get worse and worse and 
worse. If we do nothing, people several 
years from now—even people now will 
say: Why didn’t we do more? We Demo-
crats want to do more on climate. We 
must. 
The numbers show that the American 
economy has gotten back to where it 
was prior to COVID. Now is the time to 
go further and build back even better 
than before. We Democrats, when we 
can in a bipartisan way but on our own 
when our Republican colleagues are 
adamantly against us, we will move 
forward on both tracks—both tracks. 
I am proud of my Democratic caucus, 
every one of them voting yesterday for 
this bill and all pledging to go forward 
on the second track as well. 
f 
CAPITOL SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another matter, even during normal 
times, protecting the U.S. Capitol is a 
difficult job. Millions of people visit 
the U.S. Capitol every single year. Five 
hundred and thirty-five elected offi-
cials and their staffs work here every 
single day. To keep the Capitol Com-
plex safe, to keep it secure, we are 
lucky to have the best of the best. 
Our Capitol Police, who stared down 
a violent mob on January 6, have been 
nothing short of heroic—heroic. When 
the smoke cleared after the attack of 
January 6, they came back to the Cap-
itol and helped piece together what the 
rioters had torn apart. In the after-
math of that dark day, the National 
Guard helped keep watch day and 
night, 24–7. 
I walked the halls of this building 
early in the morning and saw our Na-
tional Guard men and women, from 
New York and so many other States, 
camped out, helping us, wanting to 
make sure the Capitol was secure. We 
owe the Capitol Police and we owe the 
National Guard our deepest gratitude, 
but we owe them more than just that. 
We owe them the resources they need 
to do a very difficult job and to do it 
well. 
Unfortunately, Congress is on the 
precipice of failing. Due to unforeseen 
expenses during the pandemic and the 
toll incurred by the attack on January 
6, funding for our Capitol Police, secu-
rity at the Capitol Complex, even our 
National Guard, has come close to run-
ning very dry. 
Already, the Capitol Police has had 
to delay vital trainings and the pur-
chase of new safety equipment. Soon, 
salaries, bonuses, and new hiring will 
be on the chopping block. According to 
MG Tom Carden, who sent 1,200 mem-
bers of the Georgia National Guard to 
the Capitol after January 6, his unit is 
facing ‘‘draconian’’ cuts if Congress 
doesn’t replenish funding before this 
weekend. We must not—we must not— 
let that happen under our watch. 
The chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, Senator LEAHY, has been 
working diligently to come up with a 
bipartisan agreement. Now, Senator 
SHELBY has joined with him, and they 
have crafted a $2.1 billion supplemental 
appropriations bill to fill the shortfalls 
of our Capitol Police, our National 
Guard, and a number of other vital de-
fense operations. It is not everything 
that we wanted. The House’s bill is big-
ger and broader. But it does fill the 
need, and we need to fill it quickly. 
I want to thank Senator LEAHY par-
ticularly for his relentlessness in pur-
suing this. 
I want to thank Senator SHELBY for 
realizing how important this was in 
prodding Members on his side of the 
aisle to move forward. 
I also want to thank Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and BLUNT, chairmen of the au-
thorization committee, the Rules Com-
mittee, that deals with these issues. 
Senator 
KLOBUCHAR
in 
particular, 
whose hearings and continued focus on 
Capitol security helped pave the way 
for the agreement, deserves our kudos. 
Now is the time for the Senate to 
take up and pass this bill on behalf of 
the brave police officers and service-
members who defended this very cita-
del of democracy. 
All 50 Senate Democrats fully sup-
port this crucial police and security 
funding. All 50 Democrats are ready to 
go. We are eager, insistent we meet our 
deadline. 
Again, Democrats are prepared to 
vote on this bill as soon as possible. 
With the cooperation of our Republican 
colleagues, which we hope we will get— 
our needs are dire—we could pass this 
bill today. 
The last 6 months have pushed those 
who protect the U.S. Capitol to the 
limits. In the face of unprecedented ad-
versity, they responded heroically. We 
must support them now as they so cou-
rageously supported us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

July 29, 2021 
and voted to begin floor consideration 
of bipartisan compromise legislation 
for our Nation’s infrastructure. 
Our country would benefit a whole 
lot from some targeted investment in 
the kinds of real, tangible projects that 
fit a commonsense definition of actual 
infrastructure—roads, bridges, ports, 
waterways, airports, broadband. 
A bipartisan compromise to respon-
sibly finance these kinds of invest-
ments is guaranteed to be big and com-
plex. It is guaranteed to be the kind of 
legislation that no Member on either 
side of the aisle will think is perfect. 
But it is an important basic duty of 
government. 
I am glad to see these discussions 
making progress. I was happy to vote 
to begin moving the Senate toward 
what ought to be a robust, bipartisan 
floor process for legislation of this 
magnitude. 
This kind of focused compromise that 
our colleagues have been hashing out 
could not contrast more sharply with 
the multitrillion-dollar reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree the Democrats 
hope to ram through on a party-line 
vote later this year. 
As I have said before, the Democrats’ 
spree is reckless on multiple levels. We 
are all familiar with the staggering $3.5 
trillion bottom line. We all know it 
would only amp up the painful infla-
tion that is already hammering mid-
dle-class families, in large part because 
of the last partisan deluge of spending 
Democrats rammed through just a few 
months ago. 
But just as alarming is the parade of 
leftwing ideas that comprise this mess: 
turning temporary pandemic welfare 
payments with no work requirements 
into a permanent dole, shoving through 
big chunks of the Green New Deal, gov-
ernment price-fixing that would leave 
us with fewer new medicines and new 
cures. 
And then there is an effort to further 
inflame the Biden administration’s 
border crisis with a far-left amnesty. 
We have now seen the highest unac-
companied child arrivals on record, the 
biggest month for immigrant encoun-
ters in 21 years. This month, total CBP 
apprehensions for the calendar year are 
expected to top a million—a million— 
for the first time in 15 years, and we 
still have 5 months to go. 
So one might think my friends across 
the aisle would try to avoid repeating 
the missteps that created the crisis; 
that they would be careful to avoid 
doubling down on the perverse incen-
tives generating so much suffering 
down at the southern border. 
But, apparently, Washington Demo-
crats intend to do the opposite. Their 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
would include an even bigger green 
light for this crisis at the worst pos-
sible time. Under the Biden adminis-
tration’s unenforceable catch-and-re-
lease policy, just 13 percent of the 
50,000 individuals who have been re-
leased into the United States since 
March have actually reported to as-
signed ICE checkups. So in a sense, ei-
ther intentionally or through incom-
petence, the administration is already 
practicing a policy that amounts to 
functional amnesty in many cases. 
What Democrats want now is to make 
that explicit and, believe it or not, per-
manent. 
They 
would 
effectively 
like 
our 
southern border to be even more open 
than it is now, even during an ongoing 
public health emergency that has Fed-
eral, State, and local officials contem-
plating new batches of rules for Amer-
ican citizens. The message to Ameri-
cans appears to be: Put your guard 
back up, even if you are vaccinated. 
But to a jaw-dropping degree, the 
message to people arriving at the 
southern border seems to be: Come on 
in. Even if you are COVID positive, 
come on in. 
CBP data are reportedly showing a 
huge uptick in positive COVID tests in 
the Rio Grande Valley sector. That is 
just one sector, and that is just among 
whatever fraction of the individuals 
are actually being tested. And among 
individuals in ICE custody, apparently 
one in three—one in three—are declin-
ing to receive a vaccine. Yet it seems 
the Biden administration doesn’t con-
sider a COVID diagnosis any reason to 
make an exception to its catch-and-re-
lease 
policy. 
Alarming 
reports 
of 
COVID-positive detainees being turned 
out into Texas communities even have 
border-State Democrats sounding the 
alarm. 
I hope President Biden is listening. 
Maybe Members of his own party will 
have better luck conveying what the 
American 
people 
have 
known 
for 
months: The situation at our southern 
border is a crisis. It deserves real at-
tention and real solutions, not a reck-
less taxing-and-spending spree with 
amnesty policies that would make 
things considerably worse.

REMEMBERING BOB DOVE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a completely different matter, for 
the second time this week the U.S. 
Senate family must bid a sad farewell 
to a member of its alumni society. 
Only six different individuals have 
served as Senate Parliamentarian since 
the position was formally established 
back in 1935. It is a unique and remark-
able position that seems to require 
unique and remarkable people. 
Bob Dove served two stints as Parlia-
mentarian from the early 1980s to the 
early 2000s. He passed away yesterday 
at the age of 82 after a long illness. 
I was just a rank-and-file Senator 
during Bob’s stints on the dais, but ev-
eryone in the entire Senate knew all 
about Bob’s brilliance and his incred-
ible spirit. Bob Dove knew this body’s 
history and its rules to the tenth dec-
ibel place. 
He was also a constantly jovial per-
son, as approachable as he was smart. 
His love for the Senate was tangible. It 
was palpable, and it was not only a 
love for the institution, itself, as an ab-
straction, it was also a love for the 
human beings who comprised it. 
I understand that back in the day, 
Bob had a go-to one-liner to help him-
self and his fellow professionals here on 
the floor through the tougher days. 
Here is what he said: ‘‘You may love 
the Senate,’’ he would dryly declare, 
‘‘but the Senate may not love you 
back.’’ 
But a little gruff sarcasm couldn’t 
conceal Bob’s true affection. In fact, 
his enthusiasm for this place was so 
contagious that it swept up multiple 
generations of his family. About a year 
and a half ago, we said goodbye to 
Bob’s daughter, Laura Dove, herself a 
long-serving, well-loved and widely re-
spected Senate staff leader as she left 
the post of Secretary for the Majority. 
Even now, two of Bob’s grandchildren 
are spending their summers right here 
in the Senate, helping out in different 
positions. 
Either Bob Dove’s brood just cannot 
quit this multigenerational addiction 
to public service or perhaps it is the 
Senate that cannot quit them. 
So our condolences and our prayers 
go out to Bob’s wife Linda, to Laura 
and her brother and sister, and to Bob’s 
grandchildren and extended family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5150 
July 29, 2021 
But I wanted to recount another event 
this morning which was not as widely 
published but could be very important 
to many American families. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, if you ask families 
across the United States to list the top 
three things they are worried about in 
terms of pocketbook issues and things 
that Congress can address, I will bet 
you that they will end up putting the 
costs of prescription drugs on that list 
every time. They know what happened. 
These prescription drug costs have 
gone through the roof. For many peo-
ple, it is a real hardship. 
I was looking this morning at some 
of the information we have about insu-
lin, and, you know, for millions of 
Americans that is literally a life-and- 
death drug. Insulin was discovered dec-
ades ago. The gentleman and those who 
did the research to find it basically 
gave away all of their patent rights— 
the rights to make any money off of in-
sulin—for $1. They said you can’t take 
a 
life-and-death 
drug 
and 
put 
a 
pricetag on it. It has to be shared by 
people. 
Jonas Salk did exactly the same 
thing when it came to the polio vaccine 
in the 1950s. He found this break-
through vaccine—and I was one of the 
early schoolkids to sign up for it—and 
said: I don’t want to make a penny off 
of this. This means too much to Amer-
ica and the world. 
Bless both of those individuals for 
that kind of selflessness. 
Yet when it comes to drugs like insu-
lin today, and Sanofi, one of the larg-
est producers of insulin, in the year 
2000, was charging $35 for a dose of in-
sulin. It has now had the price rise 25 
times since then. The price of an insu-
lin vial is $350, creating a real hardship 
and a real strain for many families who 
are dependent on insulin to keep them-
selves or their children alive. 
So, this morning, we had a meeting 
in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We 
considered four pieces of legislation on 
a bipartisan basis—let me underline 
that: bipartisan basis—and passed all 
four measures unanimously with voice 
votes. I could tell you, having served 
on that committee for over 20 years, it 
is a rare day that everything goes 
through with bipartisan support on an 
issue of consequence. Today was one of 
those days. 
One of the bills, the Stop Significant 
and Time-wasting Abuse Limiting Le-
gitimate Innovation of New Generics 
Act—the Stop STALLING Act—by Sen-
ators KLOBUCHAR and GRASSLEY, was 
advanced by a voice vote. 
What we are finding is that the phar-
maceutical industry is designing new 
ways on a regular basis to delay the 
surrender of their patents. As long as 
they have patents—and most of those 
are for 20 years—they have the exclu-
sive right to sell that drug, and no one 
can compete with them. At the end of 
20 years, the theory goes that the ge-
neric drug companies step in, make the 
same drug for a much lower cost, and 
the consumer finally gets a break. 
Well, you can imagine the lawyers 
and businessmen in many pharma-
ceutical companies who are trying to 
delay 
that 
moment 
of 
when 
the 
generics step in for as long as possible. 
This bill that we passed this morning, 
which will be coming to the Senate 
floor, addresses that. 
We want to have access to generics 
and biosimilar treatments. We want to 
make sure that the loopholes and 
tricks that the pharmaceutical indus-
try is using now to delay the generic 
drugs coming onto market come to an 
end. This was an amazing array of 
drugs that, I think, will have a direct 
impact on America and its future. 
H.R. 3684 
Speaking of impact, Madam Presi-
dent, what happened last night was his-
toric. 
As 
I 
mentioned, 
17 
Republicans 
joined the Democrats in passing a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. It is rare 
that we come together on something 
that significant, with that much bipar-
tisanship. We are now in the midst of 
the debate on that bill, on the cloture 
vote, and our time is running. I hope, 
soon, that we can get to the merits of 
the bill and get it enacted as quickly as 
possible. 
This is a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to rebuild our Nation’s roads, 
railways, and bridges; to make high- 
speed internet and clean water realities 
for every home in America; and to cre-
ate millions of good-paying, family- 
supporting, and, in many cases, union 
jobs across the country. 
President Biden said he wanted to 
build back better when it came to 
America. He sure showed it last night. 
We never could have reached that point 
without his leadership. The White 
House has been a partner in this bipar-
tisan effort from the start, and 67 
Members 
of 
the 
Senate 
coalesced 
around this approach. This economy 
needs to work fairly for everyone and 
protect our kids and grandkids from 
climate catastrophe, and a major part 
of this bill addresses it. 
This is a moment the American peo-
ple have been waiting for. It couldn’t 
have come sooner. Right now, many of 
our roads and bridges are in terrible 
disrepair, and our infrastructure is 
crumbling before our eyes. Every week 
brings word of a new climate-related 
crisis: 
devastating 
drought 
and 
wildfires in the West; melting power 
lines in Oregon; rolling blackouts in 
Texas; and, 2 weeks ago, there was a 
bridge collapsing in my State of Illi-
nois. 
Take a look at this picture. Let me 
describe what you are seeing here. 
This was a scene in a small, rural 
town in Illinois, in Seneca, when a 
bridge on the River Road gave way to 
extreme flooding. As you can see down 
here, the pavement comes to an end, 
and you can see all the way through. 
When that bridge came apart, typically 
and in good fashion, a group of Illi-
noisans stepped up as Good Samaritans 
and pulled the driver out of this vehicle 
that was straddling this breaking high-
way. A local police officer said the 
driver was ‘‘really lucky that he didn’t 
end up in the creek under the bridge.’’ 
I am grateful that nobody was 
harmed that evening. I thank the first 
responders, as well, for coming to the 
rescue. But now, 2 weeks later, that 
bridge is still broken, and the tax-
payers in my home State are stuck 
paying the tab. Repairs are going to 
cost over a million bucks. 
This is just one example of the fail-
ure to invest in our Nation’s roads and 
bridges that is costing us. Every 4 
years, the American Society of Civil 
Engineers gives a report card on our 
roads and bridges and their safety. For 
decades, it has been filled with the 
kind of grades that you wouldn’t want 
your kids to bring home from school. 
The overall grade this year was a C 
minus, in the United States of Amer-
ica, for the wealthiest nation and the 
largest economy on Earth. Imagine. 
If we continue to neglect the arteries 
of our economy, the situation will get 
worse. The American Society of Civil 
Engineers estimates that the continued 
underinvestment in our Nation’s infra-
structure could cost $10 trillion of loss 
in GDP over the next two decades, a 
major drain on city and State budgets, 
but, more importantly, a threat to 
families and their safety when they 
travel. 
This truckdriver had no idea that he 
would take his truck out on this road 
and, at the end of the day, be lucky to 
still be alive. Our Nation has one of the 
highest road fatality rates in the 
world. And nearly 1 in 12 bridges in 
America is considered structurally de-
ficient. This is one of them. That 
means that they are at the risk of 
being compromised by extreme weath-
er, which is becoming more and more 
common with climate change. Any of 
us could become that man on the 
bridge in Seneca, IL, who was saved by 
his neighbors. 
The infrastructure proposal we are 
considering at this very moment would 
eliminate this threat across America, 
rehabilitate our roads and bridges, 
keep our economy growing, and make 
our families safe. With this historic in-
frastructure proposal, we are removing 
the hazards from our communities and 
establishing a better foundation for our 
economy. Let’s take a glance at some 
of the achievements under this bipar-
tisan proposal. 
It is the largest ever investment in 
public transit in America’s history. I 
called the mayor of the city of Chicago 
yesterday, and I said: I think I have 
some good news for you. We are going 
to be able to build that transit system 
out, make it more accessible for those 
with disabilities, have safer stations, 
and expand the reach of transit in the 
city of Chicago. 
I called downstate, to the Springfield 
Mass Transit District, to tell them the 
good news as well: more buses that are 
fuel-efficient, electric buses, and buses 
that really acknowledge that we need a 
response to the climate situation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5151 
July 29, 2021 
A historic expansion in electric vehi-
cle infrastructure is part of this bill. 
Electric vehicles are the future. Don’t 
believe me when I say it, and don’t 
wait for some government spokesman 
to say it. Just turn on your TV and 
watch the advertisements. 
The Ford F–150 Lightning—this elec-
tric truck—is so popular in America 
and has an electrifying ad. To say that 
it is available now is an overstatement. 
But it will be soon. They put on the ad, 
if you look at the very end of it: If you 
want to reserve one of these trucks, 
here is the website you should contact. 
That is happening more and more— 
an electrified Mustang, for example. 
All of these suggest that the private 
sector is racing ahead of those of us in 
government, realizing that electric ve-
hicles are the future. This plan will 
help automakers win the race world-
wide, and it will be the most important 
auto race in our history to make sure 
that electric vehicles have the Amer-
ican imprint on them. 
This bipartisan plan is a move for the 
future. For families in Illinois, the 
funding means parents won’t have to 
worry about a bridge collapse while 
taking their kids to school, and it 
means they can trust the water coming 
out of the faucet to be clean and safe. 
For parents in the city of Chicago, 
with more lead service lines than any 
city in the United States, it could be a 
lifesaver. 
These are the investments we need if 
we want America to win the 21st cen-
tury. By making them today, with in-
terest rates now at a historic low, we 
can reap the benefit for decades to 
come, and that is not just my assess-
ment. Last week, Moody’s chief econo-
mist said that President Biden’s plan 
to build back better ‘‘will lift the 
economy’s longer term growth poten-
tial and ease inflation pressures’’—two 
things that all of us endorse. 
Let me say that again for my fellow 
Senators. Many on the other side of the 
aisle who can’t wait to give a looming 
inflation speech. This package, accord-
ing to Moody’s chief economist, ‘‘will 
lift the economy’s longer term growth 
potential and ease inflation pressures.’’ 
Earlier this morning, the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis reported for the 
first time our Nation’s economic out-
put has surpassed the pre-pandemic 
high. 
We are back in the saddle. Thanks to 
the American Rescue Plan, people feel 
safe and more financially secure. They 
are heading back out into the world, 
shopping and dining at restaurants and 
traveling. 
Let me add quickly: The incidents we 
are finding of infections, hospitaliza-
tions, and deaths are almost exclu-
sively from people who are not vac-
cinated—not vaccinated. They are the 
ones who are the most vulnerable, and 
they make innocent people, like our 
children, more vulnerable because of 
their decision not to be vaccinated. 
This growth in our economy reflects 
a simple truth: Relief for working fam-
ilies benefits all Americans and drives 
our economy forward. We have a lot of 
work to do to build this economy, but 
this is where we should start. 
I want to thank the bipartisan group 
of Senators who came together to 
produce this package. In many ways, it 
is miraculous. This agreement can do 
more and enable us to repair America’s 
roads and bridges. It can show us the 
way a divided Senate can come to-
gether for the good of this country. 
Just remember, there wasn’t a single 
infrastructure bill—major infrastruc-
ture bill—in the last 5 years, under the 
previous President, not one. We are 
doing it now on a bipartisan basis that 
is long overdue. 
I want to thank President Joe Biden 
for his determined leadership. Nothing 
this big and important is ever accom-
plished with a President standing on 
the sidelines. 
Joe Biden promised to work with 
both parties to make America work for 
all Americans, and he has. This is an 
achievement we can be proud of. 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam President, let me conclude by 
saying that the Senate Republican 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, came to 
the floor this morning to speak of im-
migration. I am glad he did because it 
is a topic we cannot ignore and must 
not ignore. 
We have not passed a significant im-
migration bill in the United States of 
America in 36 years. Ronald Reagan 
was the President. And when you come 
with a list of horribles with the current 
immigration system, it is almost end-
less—the unfairness of the system. 
But the Senator from Kentucky took 
a position which I take exception to. 
He believes that if we allow any immi-
grant into this country, it is a green 
light, as he called it, for others to try 
to come in legally or illegally. 
I think he is dead wrong, because 
every year—every year—in the United 
States of America, with a population of 
over 320 million, we legally allow 1 mil-
lion new immigrants to become this 
country, every year. That is what 
America is all about. We are a nation 
of immigrants, and we understand the 
value of immigrants to our country. 
We had a hearing last week on farm 
workers. We have 2.4 million farm 
workers who pick the crops and process 
the food that we enjoy at every single 
meal—2.4 million. And, sadly, many of 
them are in horrible circumstances 
under our immigration laws. They are 
subject to deportation and arrest at 
any moment. For what? For being here 
picking the crops that our kids eat for 
breakfast and things that we count on 
every single day. 
So the House of Representatives took 
a step forward, a bipartisan step for-
ward. Thirty Republicans joined the 
Democrats to pass a farm worker bill. 
I want to give special credit to Senator 
MIKE BENNET, who has been a leader in 
this area. We have an agreement in 
this bill, for both growers and workers, 
to give those who do that back-break-
ing labor, day in and day out, a chance 
and a path to citizenship. 
One of the critics came to our com-
mittee and said: Oh, mass amnesty for 
farm workers—why would we want to 
do that? These people come in and pick 
a few crops and we are going to give 
them citizenship. 
I wish he would have taken a minute 
to read the bill. You know how many 
years it takes picking that farm crop 
to be eligible for citizenship under this 
bill? Fourteen to 19 years. Nineteen 
years. Does that sound like somebody 
stealing across the border, pretending 
to be a farm worker to become a cit-
izen? Nineteen years of your life and 
then you are eligible. 
It is only common human decency for 
us to do that. 
We need workers in so many areas. In 
a hearing yesterday on meat proc-
essing, I asked the major companies 
that process meat in this country: 
What percentage of your workforce 
processing that meat are immigrant 
labor? 
Well, they weren’t sure. I know the 
number. The Migration Policy Insti-
tute tells us that 40 percent of the peo-
ple who are processing poultry and 
meat in this country are immigrants. 
Why? Why are they attracted to this 
job? Because so few Americans are at-
tracted. They need to have immigrant 
labor to make up the difference. It is 
hard, hot, dangerous, back-breaking 
labor, and they do it every darn day so 
we can enjoy our meals. 
And to say that we are going to ig-
nore that reality, that we don’t need a 
single immigrant in this country, is 
mindless. 
I would just invite those who don’t 
believe we need immigrants in this 
country going to work to make this a 
better nation, skip a few meals, be-
cause what is on your table is there be-
cause of immigrant labor. 
Face the reality. Be honest about it, 
be fair about it, and don’t label all of 
these people who are working in our 
country as would-be terrorists who are 
taking away valuable American jobs. 
They are an important part of Amer-
ica’s past and an important part of our 
future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Biden border crisis continues unabated. 
Far from being the seasonal surge the 
President claimed months ago, the 
numbers at the border keep growing. 
Last month, the U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection encountered more 
than 188,000 individuals attempting to 
cross our southern border. That is not 
only the highest number seen so far 
this year; that is the highest monthly 
number in 21 years—21 years. 
In all, Customs and Border Protec-
tion has had more than 1.1 million en-
counters along our southern border so 
far in fiscal year 2021, and we still have 
3 months to go. In fiscal year 2019, by

comparison, the year before COVID, 
total—total—encounters for the entire 
fiscal year were under 980,000 individ-
uals. 
We have a border crisis—a crisis that 
President Biden seems unable or un-
willing to address. 
And as massive as those numbers I 
have mentioned are, they don’t take 
into account those individuals who are 
sneaking across the border without 
being apprehended. Some of them are, 
no doubt, individuals who are looking 
for a better life. Others are almost un-
doubtedly criminals, engaged in the 
kind of illicit activities that we have 
to combat along our southern border— 
human trafficking, drug smuggling, 
and others. 
In June, Customs and Border Protec-
tion seized more than 1,000 pounds of 
fentanyl along our southern border, an 
incredibly dangerous drug that some 
have pushed to classify as a weapon of 
mass 
destruction. 
That 
is 
more 
fentanyl than was seized in that area 
in the previous three Junes combined. 
What has the Biden administration 
been doing to deal with the crisis along 
our border? Well, not much. 
There has been no move to reinstate 
the national emergency designation for 
our southern border that President 
Biden canceled after he took office. 
There is no meaningful plan for stop-
ping the flood of illegal immigration 
and 
enhancing 
security 
along 
our 
southern border. There is no move to 
reinstate funding for the congression-
ally mandated border wall that Presi-
dent Biden canceled. 
In fact, the President is apparently 
contemplating ending title 42, which 
has allowed the government to imme-
diately remove apprehended individ-
uals in order to help manage the 
COVID crisis. 
That is right. At the same time the 
CDC is expanding its masking guidance 
for Americans, the administration is 
contemplating ending a measure to 
help stop COVID-infected individuals 
from entering the United States. 
And I haven’t even mentioned the 
fact that apparently the administra-
tion has released tens of thousands of 
individuals into the United States 
without court dates, many of whom 
have failed to show up at Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement offices as di-
rected. 
The border situation is out of con-
trol, and President Biden bears a big 
part of the blame. 
Immigration has helped build this 
country, and I strongly support mak-
ing sure that the United States con-
tinues to offer a chance for individuals 
the world over to achieve their dream 
of a better life. I also support tem-
porary worker programs, like the H–2B 
visa program, that allow individuals 
from other countries to come here for a 
limited time period to work and for the 
economic opportunity and then return 
to their home countries. 
I also support a solution that would 
allow Dreamers to stay in the United 
States if—if—such a solution is devel-
oped in the context of immigration re-
form and enhanced border security. 
But we cannot have endless floods of 
illegal immigration. No country can. It 
is a humanitarian nightmare and a se-
rious security risk. 
Immigration has to have limits, and, 
most of all, it has to be legal. We need 
to protect and encourage legal immi-
gration, while cracking down on illegal 
immigration. 
Unfortunately, Democrats are going 
in the opposite direction. The word is 
that Democrats would like to include 
amnesty in the budget-busting, tax- 
and-spending spree that they are push-
ing to vote on later this year. 
That is right. With a serious humani-
tarian and security crisis along our 
southern border, Democrats want to in-
clude amnesty in their spending plan. 
Now, I can only imagine that this 
will encourage thousands more to 
make the dangerous trek to and across 
our southern border, not to mention 
how such a policy would undermine re-
spect for the rule of law. 
I wish I could say that I see some 
light at the end of the tunnel when it 
comes to the border, but if the Biden 
administration continues along its cur-
rent path, I fully expect this security 
and humanitarian crisis to continue. 
I can only hope that President Biden 
will recognize the problems his poli-
cies, or lack thereof, are causing, be-
fore too many more individuals suffer 
the consequences. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Kansas. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I 
want to pay tribute to our colleague 
Mike Enzi and express my condolences 
to his family and pay my respects to 
him. 
Senator Enzi’s long career in public 
service began when he was elected as 
mayor of his hometown of Gillette, 
WY, in 1974. 
I can just see Mike Enzi—a younger 
Mike Enzi—being the mayor of a place 
like Gillette, WY, and it brings a smile 
to my face and a warmth to my heart. 
And I can imagine how hard he worked 
to see that only good things happened 
to the citizens of his hometown. 
He then went on to serve in the Wyo-
ming House of Representatives and the 
Wyoming Senate, before being elected 
to four terms in the U.S. Senate, begin-
ning in 1996. 
Prior to being elected to office, Sen-
ator Enzi served in the Wyoming Air 
National Guard. 
In Congress, Senator Enzi never 
wavered in his deeply held values and 
his beliefs, and yet he was always held 
by all of us in high esteem, by all of his 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
He had the ability for bringing a con-
sensus, to bring us together, and that 
remained true even as this body be-
came increasingly polarized. 
In his farewell speech to the Senate, 
Senator Enzi—unfortunately, just a 
few months ago, Senator Enzi spoke 
about his 80–20 rule. It is a rule that 
those of us who work with him knew 
well: the rule which emphasized focus-
ing on the 80 percent of issues we agree 
on versus the 20 percent of issues where 
we disagree. It allowed Senator Enzi to 
work with Senators across the political 
spectrum on legislation that he cared 
so much about. 
Senator Enzi carried himself in a 
quiet and serious demeanor. He was in-
terested above all in achieving good 
policy outcomes for the people of Wyo-
ming and the people of our Nation. 
His leadership has been missed in 
this Chamber this year, but his legacy 
as a statesman and his impact on the 
State of Wyoming will live on forever. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family and friends during this time, in-
cluding his wife Diana, their daughters 
Amy and Emily, and son Brad and his 
grandchildren. 
Senator Enzi, may you rest in peace, 
and please know that your time in the 
U.S. Senate and your time living on 
this Earth was well spent, a role model 
for the rest of us. Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
learned on Friday that the Department 
of Justice has opted not to pursue a 
civil rights investigation into govern-
ment-run nursing homes in several 
States about their response to the 
COVID–19. Earlier this year, I urged 
the Department to pursue this inves-
tigation, and I, today, call on the At-
torney General to reconsider this deci-
sion that I learned about last Friday. I 
do that in light of media reports sug-
gesting that the obstruction of justice 
may have occurred in at least one of 
these jurisdictions. 
Close to 1 year ago, the Department 
sought information from four States. 
Those four States are New York, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. 
The information sought was about the 
number of COVID–19 infections and 
deaths in their public nursing homes. 
The Department’s request for this in-
formation came on the heels of media 
reports suggesting that State officials 
in these jurisdictions had pressured 
nursing homes to accept patients, re-
gardless of their COVID–19 status. It 
was reported that officials in New York 
also may have engaged in a coverup by 
actively concealing from the public the 
actual number of COVID–19-related fa-
talities in that State’s nursing homes. 
Serious questions remain to this day 
about whether the Governors in New 
York and these three other jurisdic-
tions helped fuel the COVID–19-related

death tolls in nursing homes through 
the issuance of their own executive or-
ders that went against the advice of 
geriatricians. 
Yet the Department is declining to 
pursue the matter. And in the case of 
New York, this is particularly trou-
bling. 
New York’s Governor not only re-
portedly pressured nursing homes in 
his State to accept patients during the 
initial stage of the pandemic, regard-
less of their COVID–19 status, but his 
administration did not provide an ac-
curate picture of the actual death tolls 
to the public. This lack of trans-
parency was done to avoid account-
ability. So put very simply, the public 
deserves better. 
According to a report by the New 
York Post, a top aide to Governor 
Cuomo even apologized to a group of 
Democratic State lawmakers during a 
phone call for reportedly withholding 
data 
on 
COVID–19-related 
nursing 
home fatalities during this pandemic. 
The Department’s Civil Rights Divi-
sion won’t investigate, but at least the 
FBI and prosecutors at the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office are looking into the mat-
ter. These Federal prosecutors’ review 
reportedly focuses on whether Gov-
ernor Cuomo’s administration under-
reported COVID–19 deaths in the nurs-
ing homes in an effort to avoid nega-
tive publicity. 
At least someone is looking at this. 
However, I am disappointed that the 
Justice Department proper and Attor-
ney General Garland have decided to 
pull their punches. 
As I stated today in a letter to the 
Attorney General, it would be a grave 
injustice to those who perished in these 
facilities during the pandemic to ne-
glect to fully explore such widely re-
ported and troubling allegations. 
And as others, too, have noted, pro-
moting more accountability and trans-
parency 
is 
vital 
under 
these 
cir-
cumstances. It would not only help pre-
vent similar missteps in the future but 
also maintain public confidence in the 
Department, which is waning under the 
Department’s current leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

EMERGENCY
SECURITY
SUPPLEMENTAL
TO
RE-
SPOND TO JANUARY 6TH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 
2021 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the 
distinguished Presiding Officer knows 
from all his involvement and the nego-
tiations that have been going on, we do 
have an emergency security supple-
mental issue before us. So I am speak-
ing now to urge that the Senate take 
up and pass H.R. 3237, which is the 
Emergency Security Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act of 2021, which the 
House sent over, and we add a Leahy- 
Shelby substitute amendment. 
Let me describe a little bit for my 
colleagues what the Leahy-Shelby sub-
stitute amendment is. It is the result 
of bipartisan compromise between my-
self and Vice Chairman SHELBY. 
We have been working on this for 
weeks and weekends. Our staff has been 
working late into the night. And I want 
to thank Senator SHELBY both for his 
hard work and his friendship. 
This $2.1 billion package is designed 
to address the aftermath of the violent 
insurrection that took place on Janu-
ary 6, is designed to heal the remaining 
scars of the COVID pandemic on the 
Capitol Complex, and provide the re-
sources we need to ensure the safety of 
our Afghan partners as we conclude our 
mission in that country. 
Let me tell you why there is urgency 
in this. If we don’t act, then the Cap-
itol Police will deplete salaries funding 
in literally a matter of weeks. The Na-
tional Guard all over the country will 
be forced to cancel needed training to 
carry on their mission at home and 
abroad. We all remember when we went 
out speaking to members of the Na-
tional Guard from most of our States 
who were here to help with the secu-
rity of the Capitol in January. 
So if we did nothing, that would be 
sort of a security crisis entirely of our 
own making in what it would do to the 
Capitol Police and what it would do to 
our National Guard. 
But by acting, we prevent that crisis. 
We provide the Capitol Police with 
$70.7 million in resources for overtime 
pay, retention bonuses, mental health 
services, and new equipment and train-
ing. 
Let me tell you why this is nec-
essary. Since January 6, 73 officers 
have left the Capitol Police, and that is 
not sustainable. We have to make a 
strong statement of support for those 
officers who defended this building, and 
all it stands for, on that terrible day. 
This week, the Nation is hearing the 
testimony of the officers who fought 
the violent insurrectionist mob on that 
day, and their trauma is real. Anybody 
watching their testimony knows it 
cannot be brushed aside. 
We also provide $521 million to fully 
fund the cost of the National Guard de-
ployment to Capitol Hill. From around 
the country, including my own State of 
Vermont, the women and men of the 
National Guard responded without hes-
itation to our call for help. We 
shouldn’t hesitate to reimburse those 
costs. 
I remember during daylight hours 
and also late at night going around 
thanking members of the National 
Guard, not just from my State but 
from all the other States, for what 
they were doing. But I think it takes a 
little bit more than just a thank-you. 
We basically told them we will pay for 
this. Well, now we will. 
But that is not all we need to do. We 
need to secure the Capitol Complex. On 
January 6, the shattered windows and 
doors were broadcast to the world, lay-
ing bare that our seat of democracy is 
not some impenetrable fortress. We 
can’t just replace the windows, fix the 
doors, and say: OK. Everything is fixed. 
We need to secure the entire complex, 
including the office buildings where 
thousands of public servants work and 
countless constituents visit. 
So our bill provides $300 million to 
harden accessible windows and doors to 
the Capitol Building and the Senate 
and House Office Buildings and to in-
stall new security cameras around the 
complex. 
Our bill also fulfills our responsi-
bility to support the dedicated public 
servants who worked overtime, way 
overtime, to clean up the mess left by 
a violent mob and diligently worked to 
ensure our safety during the darkest 
hours of the pandemic. 
We must support those who sup-
ported us. That is not just a political 
or economic responsibility; that is a 
moral responsibility. That means pay-
ing for the costs we have incurred pro-
tecting staff, the Members, the entire 
Capitol community from COVID, in-
cluding cleaning costs and personal 
protective equipment, none of which 
has been paid for. Until now, we cov-
ered the costs by robbing Peter to pay 
Paul. That is unsustainable. 
Our bill addresses this by providing 
$42.1 million to reimburse the costs of 
cleaning, personal protective equip-
ment, telework equipment, and the sal-
aries of employees and contractors who 
would have been laid off in the height 
of the pandemic. 
Finally, in the Leahy-Shelby legisla-
tion, we stand with the brave Afghans 
who supported our mission through two 
decades of war. By now, we have all 
seen the gruesome reports of men and 
women being summarily executed in 
the street, sometimes in front of their 
families. Why? Because they had sup-
ported us. And that slaughter is only 
going to escalate. 
We have to provide resources for ad-
ditional special immigrant visas, SIVs, 
for translators and other Afghans who 
worked with Americans over the past 
two decades, as well as for additional 
humanitarian relief to Afghan refu-
gees. 
Our bill does just that. It provides 
$1.125 billion to fulfill our commitment 
to those brave Afghans. 
Let me tell you what the funds will 
do. They will support emergency trans-
portation, housing, and other essential 
services to our Afghan partners coming 
to the United States under special im-
migrant visas, and humanitarian aid 
for the inevitable flood of Afghans flee-
ing 
to 
neighboring 
countries. 
The 
United Nations has estimated that 
could swell to 500,000 refugees in just 
the next few months. 
We have also increased the number of 
Afghan special immigrant visas by 
8,000. We have made improvements to 
strengthen the program, expand the 
reach of its protections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5154 
July 29, 2021 
The reason we have this in the 
Leahy-Shelby bill is that there is bi-
partisan understanding that this is an 
urgent need, and we have, as the 
United States of America, a moral re-
sponsibility to address it immediately. 
Now, some have said we should just 
do the bare minimum. Some will say: 
Let’s take care of the most pressing 
needs now and work on this maybe 
later on—maybe. But I have served in 
the U.S. Senate long enough to know 
that a promise to do something later is 
no promise at all. I cannot accept a 
piecemeal approach to the urgent secu-
rity needs facing our Nation. They are 
facing us today, not sometime when we 
may think about it a few months or 
years from now. 
Vice Chairman SHELBY has a proven 
track record of reaching bipartisan 
compromise. I would note that this 
agreement does not include everything 
I want. I am sure it includes some 
items that he would have preferred to 
not be included. But it is a strong bi-
partisan bill. We have come together to 
give the best piece of legislation pos-
sible for the U.S. Senate. 
A pandemic happened. A violent in-
surrection happened. And the President 
announced the withdrawal of American 
troops from Afghanistan. The needs are 
urgent. We must address them now. 
So I am urging all Senators to not 
only support the bill but actually to 
pass the bill today because it still has 
to go back to the House of Representa-
tives this week. There is no time. 
There is no time left. It is a good piece 
of legislation. It is a necessary piece of 
legislation, and some would say, at 
least on the Afghan part, inevitable. 
Both President Trump and President 
Biden said they wanted to withdraw 
our troops this year. Well, they are 
withdrawing. Now we have to fulfill 
our responsibility. 
Mr. President, I know that Senator 
SHELBY will be on the floor to speak in 
a few moments, so I will suggest the 
absence of a quorum and ask that Sen-
ator SHELBY be recognized when we 
come out of the quorum call. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask that I be al-
lowed to speak for a few minutes, do 
my unanimous consent, and then go 
right to Senator SHELBY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
want to just give my great thanks to 
Senator LEAHY and Senator SHELBY for 
bringing this vote here right now. The 
bottom line is very simple: This wasn’t 
easy to get done. A UC on these kinds 
of issues should be easy, but it is not. 
Senator LEAHY persisted and persisted 
and persisted, and I want to thank him 
as well. 
Senator SHELBY persuaded the Mem-
bers on his side that we had to move, 
and they have come up with a good 
compromise. It is not everything our 
side wanted, but it is very good. 
I also want to thank Senator KLO-
BUCHAR and Senator BLUNT. Their work 
on the authorizing committee, the 
Rules Committee, helped pave the way 
for this, with all the information they 
brought out, and they deserve a lot of 
credit. 
Now, look, to keep the Capitol Com-
plex safe and secure, we are lucky to 
have the best of the best. As I said ear-
lier today, our Capitol Police risk their 
lives for us. They go all out for us. 
They are really, really important. The 
National Guard went all out for us, too, 
on that fateful day and then for 
months afterwards. I remember walk-
ing through the halls early in the 
morning, thanking them as they were 
bivouacked out through the Capitol 
Visitor Center and everything else. 
Now we are about to run out of 
money. Already, the Capitol Police 
have forgone some of the things that 
they usually do in terms of training, in 
terms of other types of activities, and 
soon, salaries, bonuses, and new hiring 
will be on the chopping block. Simi-
larly, many of our National Guard 
units from around the country that 
sent troops here, soldiers here, men 
and women here, are running out of 
money. 
We can’t let that happen. So passing 
this amendment is living up to our re-
sponsibility to keep this grand Capitol 
safe, this temple of democracy, this 
citadel of democracy safe, and to make 
sure that the people who risk their 
lives for us and protect us get the help 
they need. 
It shouldn’t have taken this long, but 
here we are, and I am glad we are on 
the floor. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 3237 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that notwithstanding rule XXII, at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader, following consultation with the 
Republican leader, the Senate proceed 
to the consideration of Calendar No. 63, 
H.R. 3237; that the only amendments in 
order be the following: the Leahy- 
Shelby substitute, No. 2123, and the 
Cotton amendment to the Leahy sub-
stitute, No. 2124; that there be 6 min-
utes for debate equally divided between 
the two leaders or their designees; that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate vote in relation to the Cot-
ton and Leahy amendments; that if a 
budget point of order is raised and a 
motion to waive is made, the Senate 
vote on the motion to waive; and that 
if waived, the bill, as amended, if 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and the Senate vote on passage of 
the bill, as amended, if amended, and 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table, all 
without intervening action or debate, 
with 60 affirmative votes required for 
passage of the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. One more point. I 
hope this will be unanimous. It is hard 
for me to believe that any Member 
would not want to support our Capitol 
Police. For Members to take umbrage 
at the Capitol Police when they did 
their job and protected us for some 
kind of crazy ideological reason would 
be disgraceful. I hope there will be a 
unanimous vote for this. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the agreement now be exe-
cuted. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. 
President.

SUPPLE-
MENTAL TO RESPOND TO JANU-
ARY 6TH APPROPRIATIONS ACT,

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3237) making emergency sup-
plemental appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2021, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will 
just take a few minutes here. This is 
very important, that we get this sup-
plemental passed. 
I want to first thank my colleague 
and the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee, Senator LEAHY, for 
the work he has done here, working to-
gether to get where we are today. This 
has been a lot of work, working to-
gether, but it also shows that we can 
work together in a bipartisan way and 
put the country first, and this is evi-
dence here. 
What does this bill do? It sticks to 
immediate security needs, the urgently 
needed funding to safeguard the Cap-
itol, ensure National Guard readiness, 
and protect our allies in Afghanistan. 
That is among other things. It is just 
over $2 billion total, more than half of 
which is for the Department of De-
fense. Out of the defense funding, $521 
million is to fill National Guard short-
fall and about $500 million to evacuate 
Afghan allies; $600 million for the State 
Department to fund Afghan special im-
migration visas; $100 million for our 
own Capitol Police here, to fund that; 
and $300 million for security enhance-
ments around the Capitol. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
yes for this. 
Again, I want to thank Senator 
SCHUMER and Senator MCCONNELL, our 
leaders on both sides of the aisle, for 
helping bring this to where we are 
today.

will. We need to repay our National 
Guard, and we will. We need to protect 
our allies who kept our troops safe, and 
we will. 
Emergencies arise, and the biggest 
threat to dealing with them, in my 
opinion, is fiscal irresponsibility in DC. 
We could have easily paid for the major 
parts of this legislation with offsets 
within the DOD. 
I think our spending process is bro-
ken at every level. We don’t do budgets 
anymore. We vote that the rules don’t 
matter. It seems like Congress can 
only agree on one thing: Deficits and 
debt don’t matter anymore. But they 
do. And both parties are to blame. And 
they threaten our ability in the long 
run to respond to emergencies when 
they arise, like the important ones in 
this bill, not to mention that every-
thing we do here currently is on bor-
rowed money literally from our kids 
and our grandkids. 
My point of order reference has my 
friend Mike Enzi’s name at the top of 
it. I am speaking here today for the 
reasons I just mentioned and in honor 
of him as well. 
I yield the floor. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2123

POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, Senate 
amendment No. 2123 would make new 
budget authority available for fiscal 
year 2021. The Senate Committee on 
Appropriations has not filed its sub-
allocations as required by the Congres-
sional Budget Act. 
Therefore, I raise a point of order 
against the amendment pursuant to 
section 302(c) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, pursuant 
to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act, I move to waive all appli-
cable sections of that act or any appli-
cable budget points of order for pur-
poses of the pending amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent to yield 
back all time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to time being yielded back? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. I understand we are 
going to have a voice vote on the Cot-
ton amendment.

The 
PRESIDING

NOT VOTING—2 
Marshall 
Rounds 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order requiring 60 votes 
for the passage of this bill, the bill, as 
amended, is passed. 
The bill (H.R. 3237), as amended, was 
passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
thank my colleagues for joining both 
myself and Senator SHELBY
on the 
Leahy-Shelby amendment. There have 
been weeks of negotiation, most of it 
quiet but weeks of negotiation going 
on in this. 
I am sure I can speak for both Sen-
ator SHELBY
and myself. We each 
might not have gotten everything that 
we wanted, but on this specific issue, 
we got what the country needed. We 
got the improvements for the security 
of our Capitol, the symbol of our de-
mocracy. We showed what we can do to 
help take care of the damage to the 
Capitol Police, what we can do to help 
those who work so hard here in the 
Capitol, the men and women through-
out the Capitol and Capitol Complex 
facing the threat of COVID. 
And thanks to bipartisan efforts, we 
had the issue of people who had worked 
with our military and our government 
in Afghanistan. And, now, as we with-
draw, something that both President 
Trump and President Biden wanted to 
do within this timeframe—as we with-
draw—they face retribution from the 
Taliban. We had to show our commit-
ment to protect them and to save 
them, and there is money and laws 
that are in this that will help. 
All in all, it meant a lot of Repub-
licans and a lot of Democrats had to 
come together. I have been here longer 
than anybody else in this body, and I 
have seen days when Republicans and 
Democrats come together and we ac-
complish something, and I have seen 
times when we don’t and nothing gets 
accomplished. 
I have also found, over these years, 
that nobody gets every single thing 
they want, but you try and do things 
that will make the country better, that 
will help the United States of America, 
that will help the things that we stand 
for. 
This bill, the fact that it has passed 
98 to 0, is an example of that. So I 
thank my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that further re-
marks of mine, that I be able to add 
them to the RECORD, including so many 
of the people who needed and should 
have been thanked for what they have 
done, that they be added in the RECORD 
along with my earlier statement. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CHAIRMAN LEAHY LIST FOR H.R. 3237 STAFF 
FOR THE RECORD 
I would like to thank the staff of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations on a bipartisan 
basis, for their significant contributions on 
HR 3237, the Emergency Security Supple-
mental Appropriations Act 2021, including 
Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Erik 
Raven, Katy Hagan, Brigid Kolish, Drew 
Platt, Jean Toal Eisen, Jennifer Eskra, Alex 
Keenan, Mike Gentile, Jessica Berry, Han-
nah Chauvin, Tim Rieser, Sarita Vanka, Kali 
Farahmand, 
Madeleine 
Granda, 
Jenny 
Winkler, Valerie Hutton, Jay Tilton and 
Maddie Dunn, as well as Shannon Hines, Jon-
athan Graffeo and David Adkins from Vice 
Chairman Shelby’s staff. 
Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO LYDIA JACOBY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday. It is my favorite time of 
the week. I get to come down on the 
Senate floor and talk about someone 
who has made an impact on their com-
munity, maybe the State, maybe the 
country, and, occasionally—occasion-
ally—the world. That is what I call our 
Alaskan of the Week. 
Now, this is going to be a little bit of 
a historic ‘‘Alaskan of the Week.’’ I 
have been doing this, gosh, going on 6 
years almost, and while this is a his-
toric moment, because we have never 
made someone an Alaskan of the Week 
twice—it has never happened. We are 
making Senate history right now. But 
you might know that we had a historic 
week in the Olympics because our Alas-
kan of the Week a month ago, whom 
we talked about here on the Senate 
floor, Lydia Jacoby, when she made the 
Olympic team, she won Gold. And for 
anyone who saw that race, that 100- 
meter breaststroke race a couple of 
nights ago, you will probably never for-
get it. We certainly are not going to 
forget it. 
And I guarantee you, Lydia’s home-
town of Seward, AK—a beautiful, in-
credible town of 3,000 people, wonderful 
people—they are not going to forget it. 
So history is right here on the Sen-
ate floor. Lydia Jacoby, gold med-
alist—as the Washington Post called it 
in a headline, ‘‘an Alaskan Stunner’’— 
is our Alaskan of the Week for the sec-
ond time. 
You know, I always talk a little bit 
about Alaska before I do my ‘‘Alaskan 
of the Week’’ speech. A lot of people, 
particularly at this point in the sum-
mer, when they are visiting, are curi-
ous about the light: if the Sun ever sets 
in the summer, when it rises. So what 
I always try to do is tell people: Come 
on up and see for yourself. We would 
love to have you. We are having a beau-
tiful summer. 
I will give you a hint. Right now in 
Seward, AK—that is the home of our 
Gold medal Olympian athlete, Lydia— 
the Sun will rise today at 5:32 a.m. and 
set around 10:35. We lost about 5 min-
utes from yesterday. But if you are 
still thinking about coming up to Alas-
ka for a summer trip, come on and do 
it. There is still lots of Sun. 
There is tons of excitement across 
my State, and there is tons of excite-
ment across Alaska, in Seward and ev-
erywhere else, because of this incred-
ible young 17-year-old. And if you saw 
it on TV, Seward, AK, Monday night 
was probably the site of the best Olym-
pic watch party ever—I hope people 
saw that—ever. 
So I talked about Lydia about a 
month ago when she cinched her spot 
on the team, and she did that by actu-
ally swimming the second fastest time 
in the world in the women’s 100-meter 
breaststroke finals in the Olympic 
trials for the United States. So we, in 
Alaska, knew she was something. 
I will mention this again: Alaskans, 
we punch above our weight in the Win-
ter Olympics. We do really well in the 
Winter Olympics, for reasons that most 
people probably understand, and we 
have done pretty well in the Summer 
Olympics, particularly in trapshooting, 
riflery. We have an Olympic veteran

rugby player right now. Alev Kelter 
from Eagle River is also competing. 
Her team made the Olympic quarter-
finals. She might be on the field later 
tonight, so good luck to her. We are 
going to be rooting for her as well. 
But Alaska has never sent a swimmer 
to the Olympics, ever, let alone won a 
gold. As the NBC announcer said after 
the race, Alaska ‘‘is not exactly your 
hotbed of swimming in America.’’ 
Someone else pointed out that Alas-
ka is dead last in the United States in 
terms of swimming pools per mile by 
far. We don’t have a lot of swimming 
pools. And, as a matter of fact, Lydia’s 
story is even more impressive because 
there is only one Olympic-sized pool in 
the whole State of Alaska, and that is 
in Anchorage, a 21⁄2-hour drive from 
Seward, her hometown. 
So I will just reiterate a little bit 
more about this remarkable young 
woman and her dedicated mom and dad 
who raised her. Her parents, Leslie and 
Richard, are both boat captains. Leslie 
is the educational coordinator for the 
Marine Science Explorer Program at 
Kenai Fjords Tours, and Rich is a mari-
time instructor at the Alaska Voca-
tional Technical Center—AVTEC, as 
we call it—and he also is a guide for 
Arctic and Antarctic trips. 
They raised their daughter Lydia in 
Seward, signed her up for swim classes 
when she was a toddler. Good job, Mom 
and Dad. She joined the swim club 
when she was just 6 years old. When 
she was 10, she was selected for the 
Alaska Swimming Zone Team. State 
qualifying meets allowed her to go on 
trips. 
In between all of this, she was and 
continues to be a musician, learning to 
play the guitar and upright bass. She 
sings. She plays at folk festivals. Her 
band is the Snow River String Band. 
She was also in theater and in track. 
She likes to write, take pictures, and 
explore tidal basins. This is just a 
good, all-American teenager in Alaska. 
And, of course, she excelled in swim-
ming. Her parents continued to be, in 
their words, surprised and amazed and, 
of course, so proud. 
One 
of 
her 
coaches, 
Solomon 
D’Amico, described her as ‘‘kind, quiet, 
and yet confident’’ and said that Lydia 
had an ‘‘intense fire,’’ one that you 
might not see immediately in her. But 
neither her parents nor her coach 
pushed her too hard. They wanted the 
drive to come from her, and it cer-
tainly did. 
On Monday night, when this historic 
race started, the NBC announcers were 
focused mostly on the reigning Olym-
pic champion and world record holder, 
American Lilly King, as well as the 
newly minted Olympic record holder, 
Tatjana Schoenmaker of South Africa. 
In the announcers’ minds, that is where 
the competition was. 
But we knew better, especially in 
Seward, AK, where about 400 people 
gathered for the race. All eyes were on 
Lydia. They knew all along she could 
do it. 
In Tokyo, the NBC announcers start-
ed to notice the underdog. And if you 
haven’t 
watched 
the 
race, 
go 
to 
YouTube. It is so exciting. And they 
saw her starting to pull ahead in the 
final seconds. You could hear the an-
nouncers getting excited. They said: 
Then you’ve got Jacoby, lane 3, chal-
lenging Schoenmaker. Watch Jacoby. Lydia 
Jacoby, the 17-year-old from Alaska, is put-
ting on the surge of her career. 
Watch it. It is so exciting. And, of 
course, she did. Now, there is a video of 
everybody watching in Seward, which 
quickly went viral, of Lydia’s friends 
and classmates and neighbors jumping 
up and down, stomping the floor, when 
the announcer yelled, ‘‘Alaska has an 
Olympic Gold Medalist. Oh, my gosh.’’ 
The place went nuts. 
Anyone watching, if you want to get 
Olympic joy, go on the website and 
look at the Twitter video that the 
Olympics put up. It is a split-screen 
shot of the race at the top and the 
great fans in Seward, AK, cheering. 
And when she wins, watch what hap-
pens. It is priceless. It is Olympic joy 
at its best. 
Lydia’s parents, Rich and Leslie, 
were in Florida, where NBC and the 
Olympic Committee had set up a watch 
party for families of the athletes. 
They, too, knew that she had it in her 
to win the gold. Her dad said: ‘‘When 
she hit the wall at the turn, we knew 
she was right in there. She likes to run 
[people down]’’ in her races. 
On television, the joy and the pride 
of her parents was also priceless. They 
are still filled with excitement and 
pride and, let’s face it, a little bit of 
shellshock. And they are so grateful for 
the outpouring of support from Alas-
kans and, let’s face it, Americans 
across the country. 
‘‘It’s true,’’ Rich said, ‘‘about Alaska 
being the biggest small town in the 
world.’’ Rich said that Lydia is doing 
great; she is happy, tired, a bit over-
whelmed. We don’t know yet. She 
might be competing in an upcoming 
relay race, which she is super excited 
about. We will see if that happens. 
As for what is next, her dad said 
Lydia is going to continue her life of 
being a normal teenager; participate in 
high school sports, no doubt, continue 
to play music; and she is still planning 
on attending the University of Texas in 
the fall, a normal teenager but who has 
touched so many lives across Alaska, 
particularly Seward, but across the 
country—really, across the globe. 
As one Washington Post columnist 
put it on Lydia’s win, ‘‘There are mo-
ments at [the] Olympics that redefine a 
town. And there are moments at [the] 
Olympics that make you say: ‘That’s 
why I watch [the Olympics]. That’s 
why I came. That’s what [the Olympics 
is] all about.’’’ 
And I think we all saw that when we 
watched this race. We saw that, includ-
ing the two other competitors who won 
the silver and bronze, Lilly King and 
Tatjana Schoenmaker, who came over 
to Lydia and were so gracious, hugging 
her, joyful. 
So I want to thank them. I want to 
thank Lydia’s coaches, including Sol-
omon, who put so much training and 
dedicated so much time and effort to 
her skills; and, of course, to her mom 
and dad for their very hard work, early 
morning practices, raising an excep-
tional daughter; to the competitors; 
really, everybody. 
And, of course, to Lydia: Great job on 
your hard work, dedication, grit, deter-
mination. Throughout the years, so 
many people—throughout the decades, 
so many people have dreamed of find-
ing gold in Alaska, and you are an 
Alaskan who found gold in a way that 
has inspired and overjoyed not just 
your community of Seward, not just 
our State, but literally our country 
and the world. 
So, Lydia, congrats on the gold 
medal; congratulations on your win; 
and congratulations, for the first time 
in Senate history, on being the only 
person ever to be our Alaskan of the 
Week two times. Great job. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DUR-
BIN). The Senator from Connecticut. 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11TH 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
in just a few weeks, our Nation will 
come together to remember September 
11. It will be the 20th anniversary of 
that unspeakable act of horror, an at-
tack on our Nation that devastated us 
and, most particularly, the families 
and loved ones who lost members of 
their family and friends—the fallen— 
who will be remembered on that day 
and honored. 
And I have been honored to stand 
with those families over the years, as 
many of us have, as they remember 
their loved ones and continue to face 
the trauma and immeasurable grief of 
their loss. And in these years, many of 
those families have sought justice. 
They have tried to honor their loved 
ones with action to vindicate not only 
their individual grief and mourning but 
also justice for our Nation, truth, and 
truth-telling in the courts of law in 
this country. They have brought legal 
action against the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia in the face of mounting, signifi-
cant credible evidence that, in fact, the 
Saudis aided and abetted that attack 
on our Nation. 
As a Congress, we have acted to sup-
port that effort, and I was proud to 
help to lead the Justice Against Spon-
sors of Terrorism Act, known as 
JASTA, when we passed it overwhelm-
ingly here, and then on a bipartisan 
basis, we overrode the President’s veto. 
It was President Obama who vetoed it, 
and many of us, including the Pre-
siding Officer, voted to override that 
veto, I believe. 
We opened the courthouse doors to 
the 9/11 families in their legal effort to 
hold Saudi Arabia accountable in the 
face of that evidence of its potential 
complicity. Again, I was proud to stand 
with these families in 2018 when I in-
troduced, with the help of Senators

CORNYN, SCHUMER, GILLIBRAND, MUR-

ing that documents related to the Sep-

That resolution passed the U.S. Sen-

swers, the truth about what happened 
on September 11, who was behind it, 
who supported it, who aided and abet-
ted, and who was complicit in enabling 
that handful of terrorists to do such a 
devastating attack and unspeakable 
horror on this Nation. Many of us have 
stood with those families to ensure 
that the 9/11 families not only get their 
day in court but are also able to go to 
court with all the evidence they need 
to have a fair chance to prove their 
case. 
I have asked questions at oversight 
hearings, including of Director Wray of 
the FBI. I have sought commitments 
from nominees like Attorney General 
Garland. I have written letter after let-
ter after letter, with Democrats and 
Republicans alike, calling on the De-
partment of Justice and the FBI to 
provide information that the 9/11 fami-
lies have requested. 
I am proud to continue to stand with 
those families as we approach this 20th 
anniversary date, but I also, in fairness 
to this administration, want to say 
that the moment of truth-telling now 
has arrived, and there is a moment of 
reckoning here. 
These families, since JASTA, have 
been engaged in an epic legal struggle 
against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
for aiding and abetting the terrorists 
who attacked the United States on 
September 11, but now that struggle is 
also one against their own government, 
our government, because while Con-
gress did our job in passing JASTA, 
opening the courthouse door to give 
those 9/11 families a chance at justice, 
the last administration invoked the 
state secrets privilege without expla-
nation to shield the documents and in-
formation the 9/11 families need to 
make their case. 
The last administration denied them 
their fair day in court, and I say with 
great regret that the current adminis-
tration seems intent on doing the 
same. My hope is otherwise. That is 
the reason I have raised this issue pub-
licly and privately repeatedly, not only 
in the last years but in the last weeks. 
To deny information to the 9/11 fami-
lies and, equally important, to the 
American people is unacceptable, and 
it is unconscionable. 
The requests that I and so many of 
my colleagues have made to the De-
partment of Justice and the FBI to dis-
close and declassify what can be dis-
closed and declassified in the national 
interest—those requests have gone un-
answered. Sadly, the executive branch 
across administrations has repeatedly 
failed to provide any explanation—let 
me repeat: failed to provide any expla-
nation—let alone meaningful justifica-
tion for why there has been no disclo-
sure. That denial of explanation or jus-
tification is itself also unacceptable 
and unconscionable. These families 
will never get their loved ones back, 
but at the very least, they should get 
answers. In fact, they deserve answers. 
They deserve the truth. The American 
people deserve the truth. 
Now, what the executive branch has 
done 
is 
to 
invoke 
broadly 
and 
unspecifically something called state 
secrets privilege. State secrets privi-
lege was and remains intended to pre-
vent court-ordered disclosure of gov-
ernment information when genuine and 
significant harm to the national de-
fense or foreign relations is at stake 
but only to the extent necessary to 
safeguard those interests. 
It is also clear under the Department 
of Justice rules that it should be in-
voked only upon sufficient showing 
that it is necessary ‘‘to protect infor-
mation the unauthorized disclosure of 
which could reasonably be expected to 
cause significant harm to national se-
curity and that the invocation be nar-
rowly tailored for that specific pur-
pose.’’ 
Here is the problem: We don’t know if 
that is what happened in the 9/11 fami-
lies’ case or in many other cases. We 
don’t know whether decisions to in-
voke this privilege met this high and 
exacting standard or were narrowly 
tailored. And we don’t know because in 
the 9/11 families’ case, the Department 
of Justice and the FBI have claimed 
that even the Trump administration’s 
‘‘justification for secrecy needed to re-
main secret’’ and the ‘‘public discus-
sion of the issue ‘would reveal informa-
tion that could cause the very harms 
[the] assertion of the state secrets 
privilege is intended to prevent.’ ’’ 
These blanket assertions and vague 
justifications undermine both public 
confidence that our government will 
only invoke the privilege to protect na-
tional security and the pursuit of jus-
tice. 
Now, let’s be very clear. There are 
times when disclosure can imperil 
methods and secrets and sources in in-
formation gathering. There are times 
when secrecy is important to protect 
an ongoing investigation. We are talk-
ing here about disclosure of informa-
tion relating to an attack 20 years ago. 
There is no indication of any ongoing 
investigation into the attack on our 
country. There has been no explanation 
that sources and methods may be im-
periled. There has been no justification 
whatsoever. 
Similar rationales, blanket asser-
tions of protection, have prevented ex-
planations in other cases as well and in 
some instances have led to the with-
holding of documents or information 
and outright dismissal of cases, depriv-
ing victims of an opportunity for jus-
tice. 
In 1948, three civilians were killed 
when a B–29 aircraft testing secret 
electronic 
equipment 
crashed 
in 
Waycross, GA. Their grieving widows 
did the only thing they could, bringing 
a wrongful death action in Federal 
court against the government. But the 
invocation of the state secrets privi-
lege prevented them from receiving 
justice and the truth. 
In 2003, Macedonian officials ab-
ducted a German citizen at the request 
of the CIA. In that instance as well, 
justice was sought unsuccessfully, and 
the case was dismissed because the 
government invoked the state secrets 
privilege. 
In 2006, the FBI allegedly engaged in 
the targeted religious profiling of Mus-
lims in Southern California. If true, it 
was and it remains an egregious abuse, 
one that led these individuals to sue 
the FBI. But rather than let the case 
proceed and rather than let the truth 
come to light about what the FBI did 
and why, the government asked the 
trial court to dismiss the case on the 
basis of the state secrets privilege, and 
the trial court agreed. This case, how-
ever, is not yet over because the Su-
preme Court will hear it in the fall 
after it has wound its way through the 
lower courts. As we know, justice is 
often delayed. In this instance, justice 
delayed is justice denied, again because 
of the state secrets privilege. 
Let me close with a bit of history. On 
September 11, 2019, the then-President 
of the United States, Donald Trump, 
made a promise. He made a promise to 
the 9/11 families. He made a promise to 
them to their faces. He looked them in 
the eye, shook their hands, and he told 
them that the Department of Justice 
would disclose documents relative to 
their case against the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia. The next day, the Attor-
ney General of the United States, Wil-
liam Barr, in a sworn declaration to 
the Southern District of New York 
Federal Court, invoked the state se-
crets privilege to prevent the release of 
the very information that the Presi-
dent of the United States had promised 
those families, the same documents, 
the same evidence that the President 
of the United States had vowed to dis-
close. The very next day, the Attorney 
General of the United States went into 
the Federal District Court in New York 
and said no. 
The 9/11 families, whom I have come 
to know and admire, deserved so much 
better from the last administration. 
But it is not about one administration 
or another. It is about the United 
States providing them with the truth. 
It is about our government providing 
the people of the United States with 
the truth. 
I will be coming back to the floor in 
the weeks ahead, and I hope my col-
leagues will join me in raising this 
issue, in calling on the Department of 
Justice and the FBI to review their de-
cision invoking this privilege, to de-
classify and disclose information that 
they have withheld. They have yet to 
explain why the national interest is 
served by this blanket, unjustified, and 
unexplained invocation of the state se-
crets privilege. The 9/11 families and

the American public deserve that much 
and more. And this case is about ac-
countability. It is about holding ac-
countable the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
bia. 
I am not here to argue the case in 
court. I am not here to take issue with 
any legitimate, urgent, narrowly-tai-
lored interest that may be served by 
this Privilege, but there is no indica-
tion of any such interest and, in fact, 
neither the FBI nor the Department of 
Justice should stand in the way of jus-
tice for these families in court. 
They owe the American people an ex-
planation, and they owe the 9/11 fami-
lies the truth so they can bring it to 
bear in their quest for justice. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Okla-
homa. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
there are a lot of issues we are working 
through right now in the Senate. 
Obviously, infrastructure is in con-
versation, and what is going to happen 
with some spending dealing with Na-
tional Guard, Capitol Police. 
We are working a lot on issues, like 
Afghan 
translators—trying 
to 
get 
those folks who walked alongside our 
soldiers for 20 years and risked their 
lives out of harm’s way before the 
Taliban slaughters them. 
We are engaged in a lot of issues. 
There are a lot of things happening be-
hind the scenes. I thought it might be 
helpful to be able to give a couple of 
things I think we need to consider. 
One is what is happening in the State 
Department right now. State Depart-
ment engagement on the issues of pass-
ports is a major issue. It is a frustra-
tion for a lot of Americans. And I 
would tell you, a lot of Oklahomans 
that we deal with on a day-to-day basis 
on our team are very frustrated with 
trying to get their passport renewed. 
They didn’t travel last year, obviously, 
with COVID, but now they want to be 
able to do some traveling in places 
where they can. 
Good luck with that, as we have 
found. Right now, the backlog at the 
State Department is about 18 weeks. 
Today is the 29th of July. That means 
if you turn in your application for your 
passport today, you may get your pass-
port December 2. Merry Christmas. If 
you plan on traveling Thanksgiving, 
you need to pay the extra fee to do an 
expedited delivery though we are at the 
end of July right now. 
The problem? 
The State Department still hasn’t 
brought all of their staff back. They 
are not engaging. The rest of the coun-
try is open and operating, and the 
State Department is still studying how 
they are going to come back in, and 
millions of Americans are just waiting 
for their passport. 
I have spoken to leadership in the ad-
ministration about this exact issue. In 
fact, I talked to some leadership who 
literally said to me: Oh, I wasn’t aware 
there was a problem. 
Listen, there is a problem, and it is 
not just in the State Department. It is 
in multiple other agencies. As America 
opens back up, trying to be able to 
manage all the issues with COVID, 
they are very aware of masks and vac-
cines and spacing. 
But companies have figured out how 
to do this. For some reason, multiple 
agencies have not and it is causing real 
problems. It is not just problems in our 
economy with permitting and other 
things, some of the policies that have 
been put in place are causing real prob-
lems across our economy for just indi-
viduals. 
We have an unemployment rate right 
now in June at 5.9 percent. We don’t 
know what it will be for July, but it is 
getting better and better all the time. 
In Oklahoma, we have one of the low-
est unemployment rates in the coun-
try. We have a lot of people employed 
because we turned off the extra unem-
ployment benefits at the end of June 
and people came back to work. That is 
a good thing for them, for their fami-
lies, for their kids, and for our econ-
omy. As we continue to be able to re-
engage, that is helpful. 
But what we are seeing right now is 
inflation, consumer price increases like 
we have not seen in more than a dec-
ade. The Consumer Price Index in-
creased by 5.4 percent. That is the most 
in 13 years. 
We are watching the rapid rise in 
prices that Americans feel. It is a di-
rect result of this $2 trillion bill that 
was done in March, where it paid peo-
ple not to work, sent checks to individ-
uals, and did lots of other benefits. 
Many people, even economists from 
the Obama administration, said: Don’t 
do this. It will cause inflation. 
What have we seen? 
In just the last 5 months: milk prices 
up, bread prices up, bacon prices up, 
price of gasoline up, price of wood up, 
price of building materials up, price of 
rental cars up, prices of used cars up, 
shortages in different supply chains— 
things we all identified in February 
and March and said we need to be at-
tentive to. 
If you dump $2 trillion into the econ-
omy, what does that do? 
In the middle of this dialogue about 
inflation rising right now and everyone 
in America is seeing the rise in prices, 
there is a conversation about trillions 
of dollars more of spending—more of 
spending. 
What effect do you think that will 
have? We have already seen the effect 
of what happened in March. What ef-
fect do you think it will have to add 
another, as is being forecast, $3.5 tril-
lion more spending? 
Sometimes we can’t wrap our head 
around the issues of millions and bil-
lions and trillions because it all seems 
like numbers. There is a big difference 
between millions and billions and tril-
lions. The best way I can describe this 
is, if you have a million seconds rather 
than a million dollars, a million sec-
onds is about 111⁄2 weeks. That is a lot. 
But a billion seconds is 311⁄2 years. That 
is a big difference. Brace yourself be-
cause a billion seconds is 311⁄2 years, 
but a trillion seconds is 31,688 years. 
These are big numbers that are being 
thrown around and it is hard to wrap 
our head around how much spending is 
really going on, but the concept of 
throwing out $3.5 trillion is mind-bog-
gling. 
Let me give you one more. A trillion 
miles—if I were to say: How far is a 
trillion miles? A trillion miles is if you 
left Washington, DC, today and flew to 
the planet Pluto 334 times. From DC to 
our furthest planet 334 times, that is 1 
trillion miles. 
This is a lot of money that is being 
thrown around and has real con-
sequences, knowing the debt and the 
borrowing and the tax changes, but 
how much things actually cost. 
I am continuing to challenge my col-
leagues when they discuss all these big 
numbers and say: Let’s throw all this 
money out there; it will have no con-
sequence. 
I will tell you, the people in Okla-
homa feel what is going on. They may 
not know, but they feel it in the prices 
every day, what is going on in supply 
chains, and they are very aware. And 
the No. 1 question that I get asked 
when I am out and about in places in 
Oklahoma is: Where is all this money 
coming from? 
It is a fair question. 
There is this back-channel conversa-
tion right now happening on immigra-
tion as well. Right now, the news is fo-
cused on 10 million other things, and I 
literally have people in my State say-
ing: Things must be going better at the 
border now because I don’t hear about 
it much anymore. 
I will smile at them and I say: I hap-
pen to be on that committee and be 
very engaged in the issues of border 
management 
and 
border 
security. 
Things are not getting better; they are 
getting worse. 
March was the highest number of il-
legal crossings in 20 years. It was beat-
en in April; it was beaten in May; it 
was beaten in June. Current trend, that 
will be beaten in July. Just last week— 
just in 1 week, last week, the Rio 
Grande crossing—just that one sector 
in 1 week had 20,000 interdictions—in 1 
week. At one time, they had 15,000 peo-
ple who they were detaining. 
So what is happening with that? 
I keep hearing from the administra-
tion that we are going to take on the 
root causes. The root causes is a simple 
way to say we will deal with this later. 
Because if you want to talk about root 
causes, it is a statement saying that, 
basically, the problems are in Central 
America; we can’t stop it. 
Well, that is a nice note, except for 
here is a list of the countries that have 
crossed our border illegally just this 
year. It is over 100—over 100 countries 
where 
individuals 
have 
illegally 
crossed the border.

So what about Brazil? What about 
Chile? What about Colombia? What 
about Guinea? What about Indonesia? 
What about Mauritania? Are we going 
to go after the root causes there? What 
about the Philippines, Indonesia, Ro-
mania, Ukraine, United Arab Emir-
ates? 
This is just a few of the people who 
have illegally crossed this year in big 
numbers. 
Listen, 
this 
whole 
conversation 
about root causes is a distraction. We 
do need to be engaged in the Western 
Hemisphere. We do need to deal with 
our drug addiction in this country that 
causes the flow of drugs to be able to 
move through South America, Central 
America, 
Mexico 
into 
the 
United 
States. We do need to be aggressive in 
how we are handling cartels. But to 
somehow believe that if we poured 
enough money into the Northern Tri-
angle that suddenly this would all end 
is false. 
We are the greatest country in the 
world. The root cause of immigration 
into this country is the great power of 
the United States, both for freedom 
and for our economy. People from all 
over the world want to come here. 
We have a million people a year who 
legally come to the United States—le-
gally, a million—and folks who don’t 
want to wait in line, who pay a cartel 
and move through Mexico to be able to 
get here literally from all over the 
world. If we do not enforce our borders, 
these numbers will continue to rise as 
they have every single month in this 
administration. 
Every 
month, 
the 
numbers get bigger. 
We have got to get on top of this. I 
wish I could say the administration is 
taking it seriously. I wish I could say 
they have a plan. I wish I could say 
they have released out their studies 
that they said they were going to do. 
But they have not released out their 
studies. They have not released out 
their plans, and I continue to ask 
week, after week, after week. 
The first hint that I got of what they 
planned to do came out in their budget. 
In their budget, they reduced funding 
for ICE, and they reduced the number 
of bed spaces for ICE. I was shocked. 
The numbers continue to skyrocket, 
and in their first release of what they 
plan to do on it, they asked for a 1,500- 
bed space reduction in ICE capacity for 
detention. 
Now, honestly, when I got it, I 
thought: I can’t believe they are put-
ting this in print, but I already knew 
that it was going on. Why did I already 
know that it was going on? Because, as 
I have tracked the numbers all the 
time, I have watched the number of de-
portations and ICE detentions dramati-
cally decrease. While some people are 
focused on the border, they lose track 
of the fact that not only is this admin-
istration not enforcing our southern 
border, they are not enforcing the inte-
rior of the country. 
We have 6,000 ICE agents in the 
United States, 6,000 professional law 
enforcement-career folks who are in 
the country, arresting individuals who 
are illegally present in the country, 
with the first priority being criminal 
illegal aliens. That is their first pri-
ority, the safety and security of the 
United States. Of the 6,000 agents in 
the United States, in May, they did 
3,000 total arrests—3,000 among 6,000 
agents in a month. That is a record low 
because the administration changed 
the rules for ICE agents on who they 
could interdict. 
The first big rule change they made 
is that ICE agents cannot arrest some-
one who is not legally present unless 
they get permission from regional lead-
ership by name to arrest that indi-
vidual. This means, if they go into a 
place to arrest someone and they en-
counter one person they received per-
mission to actually arrest but also find 
three other criminal aliens there, they 
cannot detain or arrest them. They 
have to leave them and request by 
name later to go back and get them. 
And guess what. They are not there. 
Shocking. And it is not all criminal 
aliens. There are only certain criminal 
aliens they are now allowed to actually 
detain. That is a big shift from every 
previous—every previous—administra-
tion. 
Let me give an example that I actu-
ally gave to Secretary Mayorkas and 
asked specifically about some recent 
frustrating moments from our ICE 
agents. 
Just a few days ago, ICE reached out 
on a previously deported alien by 
name. This person had been convicted 
of a sex assault of a minor under age 
14. The alien was at large, and they 
asked permission to be able to go after 
this alien and to be able to do a street 
arrest. Remember, they had been de-
ported before. They knew they were in 
the area. There were previous sex of-
fender convictions. They were denied 
the ability to go after that person. 
They were told, no, they don’t meet 
the standard. 
Case No. 2. Another person who was 
previously deported had a previous con-
viction for indecency with a child, sex-
ual contact. They were a registered sex 
offender. They believed they were in 
the area. They were asked if they could 
pursue an arrest. Regional leadership 
told them no, they could not. 
Case No. 3—this just happened last 
week—is of a previously deported alien, 
twice. So this means they were for the 
third time in our country illegally. 
There were previous convictions for 
alien smuggling—that is, trafficking of 
people—theft, and illegal entry. They 
knew they were in the area. They 
asked if they could do the arrest. Re-
gional leadership told them no. 
I could go on and on. 
ICE has a different set of rules now 
from what they had in the past. It is 
not just criminal aliens anymore; it is 
that they have to be really high crimi-
nal aliens. I could give you lists of peo-
ple who have multiple DUI offenses, 
and ICE asked if they could detain 
them, and they were told no. 
Listen, we have all said in this room 
that we should engage with criminal 
aliens and that criminal aliens should 
be deported. I don’t know of a person in 
this room who hasn’t said it. We 
stopped in May deporting criminal 
aliens. Are we going to do nothing 
about that? 
If you don’t believe me, call Sec-
retary Mayorkas. He will send you a 
copy—that I have as well—of the in-
terim guidance that was put out in 
May for ICE agents, limiting who they 
could deport and the process for depor-
tation. I have asked him specifically: If 
someone goes to pick up a criminal 
alien and there are other aliens who 
are there, can they be picked up? The 
answer has been no. 
We have a problem not just on our 
southern border but what is happening 
in our country and the issue of enforce-
ment, and we would be wise if we would 
pay attention to this. 
I am fully aware that there are many 
individuals in this body who do not 
like the southern border wall. That has 
been a topic of great debate in this 
room for several years. But is this body 
aware that in January of this year, 
when President Biden ‘‘paused’’ the 
border wall construction and said: I am 
going to spend 60 days studying it, that 
60-day study is still not complete 200 
days into the Presidency? He has still 
not completed the 60-day study. 
On top of that, the pause of that con-
struction, during that time period, we 
are still paying contractors to not do 
construction. So far this year, we have 
paid 
contractors 
$2 
billion—billion 
with a ‘‘b’’—not to construct the wall. 
Now, you may think it is a waste to 
construct the wall. I do not. But please 
tell me you at least believe it is a 
waste to not construct a wall and still 
pay contractors—to not construct a 
wall. 
We are currently paying contractors 
$3 million a day to watch the materials 
that had been delivered by January 20 
that were sitting on the ground—for 
steel, for fiber, for cameras, for light-
ing, for roads. We are paying $3 million 
a day to have them watch the mate-
rials on the ground to make sure they 
are not stolen—$3 million a day. That 
is a waste. 
As people cross our border in record 
numbers, a new policy has been insti-
tuted on our southern border, called a 
notice to report. This, again, has never 
been done by any administration. A no-
tice to report is when the line gets too 
long on the southern border, with peo-
ple crossing the border, when they are 
trying to check everyone in—if the line 
gets too long, Border Patrol is in-
structed to grab the folks in the back 
of the line and give them a notice to 
report. That is a card telling them 
where ICE Agency offices are around 
the country, and they can just go 
ahead and go and turn themselves in at 
whatever ICE Agency they want to 
turn themselves in to anywhere in the 
country. So far, 50,000 people this year 
have been given one of those cards at

our southern border and told ‘‘turn 
yourself in wherever you go in the

My shock, as I am trying to track 
the number, is that 13 percent have ac-
tually done it. I was surprised the num-
ber was that high. But that means 87 
percent of the people who we have 
handed a card to and said ‘‘turn your-
self in wherever you go in the country’’ 
have not. Eighty-seven percent—we 
have no idea where they are of the 
50,000 people who were released into the 
country because the line was too long 
at that moment. 
Listen, we can disagree about a lot of 
things on immigration, but handing 
people a card and saying to just travel 
anywhere you want to go in the coun-
try and turn yourself in when you get 
there—can we at least agree that is a 
bad idea? Can we at least agree that 
paying contractors $2 billion not to 
construct the wall is a bad idea? Can 
we at least agree that criminal aliens 
who had been previously convicted and 
are being picked up for another charge 
should at least be deported in the proc-
ess? Can we at least agree, if you want 
to deal with the ‘‘root causes’’ in the 
Northern Triangle in Central America, 
that it does not deter the people from 
over 100 countries who have crossed our 
southern border this year illegally? 
There is a bigger problem. Can we at 
least agree that we should address 
this? 
We have a great deal of work to be 
done. I would encourage all of us to get 
the facts, to get the details of what is 
really happening, and to understand 
that when over a million people have 
illegally crossed the border just this 
year, that we know of, that is a prob-
lem. It is a problem that hasn’t been 
there in the past anywhere close to 
this kind of number, and we should ad-
dress it in this body. 
I have written letters. I have made 
phone calls. I have done reports. We 
have done research. I have sat down 
with Secretary Mayorkas. I have held 
nominees for DHS. I have done every-
thing I can do to bring this issue to the 
forefront. Although others seem to ig-
nore it, this is an issue that we should 
not ignore. National security is not 
something we should be flippant about, 
and not everyone crossing that border 
is just coming for a job. We should en-
gage. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to 
speak of a friend and colleague whom 
we lost this week. 
Mike Enzi, a Senator from Wyoming, 
retired from this body in January of 
this year when his successor was seated 
but served here honorably for several 
decades. 
I think the simplest description I can 
give of him is that he was a kind, good, 
and decent man. I worked with him on 
the Budget Committee, but I got to 
know him best through the Wednesday 
morning Prayer Breakfast, where to 
say he was a regular participant is an 
understatement. Even after he left the 
Senate, he was at every single Prayer 
Breakfast, including last week’s, from 
his home in Wyoming via Webex. 
He was a devoted family man and a 
devoted man in the service of his coun-
try in this body. He had a rare quality. 
Unfortunately, I don’t think it was all 
that rare some years ago, but it seems 
to be becoming rarer and rarer. It is a 
quality my father preached to me years 
ago. You can disagree without being 
disagreeable. That was the way he was. 
He and I disagreed on a large number of 
matters, particularly on the Budget 
Committee, but he never was over-
bearing; he never was condescending; 
he never was harsh. It was always in 
the spirit of disagreement, in good 
faith, based upon principle. 
I want to talk about Mike Enzi, but 
I also want to put him in the context of 
modern politics because I think there 
are a couple of lessons we can learn 
from him to try to change the course 
that we seem to have embarked upon. 
One of the problems with modern 
American politics is, we don’t have op-
ponents; we have enemies. We have 
converted those we disagree with to 
people we demonize and say are bad 
people; they are evil. They aren’t. They 
have different views. They have dif-
ferent values. Perhaps they have dif-
ferent principles. But to convert oppo-
nents into enemies is to poison our 
democratic system. It is to poison our 
ability to work together in the com-
mon good. If you make someone into 
an enemy, they are going to be an 
enemy even when it comes to some-
thing where you might agree, and Mike 
Enzi never did that. 
One of the things Mike Enzi taught 
me was the 80–20 rule. We have all 
heard of 80–20 rules in various contexts. 
His 80–20 rule was, if you are working 
on a difficult public issue, work on the 
80 percent where you can agree, and 
put the 20 percent where you disagree 
aside. He was able to do that through-
out his career. 
He was famous before I got here, but 
he was famous for working with Sen-
ator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts 
when they were both on the HELP 
Committee. 
I said: Mike, how did you get along 
with Ted Kennedy? 
He said: It was easy—80–20. We put 
the 20 percent aside where we knew we 
were going to differ, and we worked on 
the 80 percent where we could, and if 
everybody 
applied 
that 
principle 
around here, we would get a lot more 
done. 
He was also a principled Senator. In-
deed, he would have been on the floor 
today, making a point of order about 
the supplemental budget that we just 
passed because he believed in the prin-
ciple of the Budget Act; he believed in 
the principle of balancing budgets. He 
was an accountant, and he was a prin-
cipled man. 
And he was also decent and kind, as 
I mentioned, but there is one story 
about him that I want to tell that has 
stuck with me, and I have told it 100 
times, although I never told it while he 
was with us. Now that he is lost to us, 
I think he would be OK with my telling 
this story. 
I was having dinner with him one 
night early on when I was here in the 
Senate, and he mentioned that he was 
concerned about the possibility of hav-
ing a primary opponent in the Repub-
lican primary in Wyoming, and I was 
incredulous. 
I said: Mike, you are one of most con-
servative 
Senators 
here. 
How 
can 
somebody possibly get to your right? 
And here was my precise question: 
What will they charge you with? 
And his answer was as profound as it 
was disturbing. He said: 
They will charge me with being reasonable. 
Think about that for a minute. He 
was concerned about the possibility of 
losing a primary election because he 
had been reasonable; because he ap-
plied the 80–20 rule and tried to work 
together 
to 
solve 
problems, 
even 
though there were disagreements on 
other areas. But he could lose—he 
could have lost his election because he 
was willing to listen to the other side, 
to be reasonable, to try to find accom-
modation, and, yes, compromise. 
And this isn’t only a Republican 
issue; this is a growing issue across our 
country in primaries, particularly in 
gerrymandered districts where the pri-
mary is the election. 
And we are getting a new crop of 
Representatives and Senators who are 
coming here who have been told: Don’t 
you dare compromise. Don’t you dare 
listen to those other people. You better 
watch whom you are having lunch 
with. 
I remember spending some time with 
our immortal Senator Margaret Chase 
Smith from Maine, whom I got to know 
fairly well before we lost her in the 
midnineties. And she said, during the 
McCarthy period, you literally had to 
worry about whom you had lunch with 
in the Senate dining room. Because of 
guilt by association, you would be as-
sociated with some liberal Senator. 
We don’t want that to be the case. It 
shouldn’t be the case. But if you can 
lose a primary because you are viewed 
as someone who is willing to com-
promise, whether you are getting that 
primary from the left or from the 
right, imagine what it does to our abil-
ity to get things done. 
If people come here knowing that one 
of the ways they can jeopardize their 
career is by listening to the other side, 
trying to get to know what is going on 
on the other side and compromising to 
get something done, it is paralysis. It 
is one of the reasons we are in paral-
ysis. 
Mike Enzi said: 
They are going to charge me with being 
reasonable. 
I think this is one of the hidden prob-
lems in American politics today. It is 
not what your position is on abortion

or gun rights or foreign policy or any 
other—immigration—it is whether you 
are willing to talk to the other side, 
listen, and try to get to a compromise 
to solve a problem. That can cost you 
your seat. What a pernicious doctrine. 
What a dangerous situation. 
Democracy is built upon compromise. 
We have 535 people in this building. We 
are going to have 535 different view-
points, interests. We represent dif-
ferent States, different areas. We have 
different principles. We have different 
values. We have got to compromise, 
otherwise it is just perennial gridlock, 
which, by the way, our constituents 
hate. 
When I talk to people in Maine, what 
they most—the biggest question I get 
is, Why can’t you people work to-
gether? Why can’t you get anything 
done? Why can’t you talk to one an-
other and sit down and break bread to-
gether and solve problems? 
This idea of not being able to com-
promise—this body is a product of com-
promise. At the Constitutional Conven-
tion in 1787, the debate almost fell 
apart on the issue of representation. 
There was the large State plan and 
the small State plan, and the worry 
was, if it was only one body of the leg-
islature, that the big States with more 
population would overrun the smaller 
States. They couldn’t figure out what 
to do, and finally one of the delegates 
from Connecticut proposed what was 
called the Great Compromise, which 
was the invention of the U.S. Senate. 
This body itself is built on com-
promise. But there is no human prob-
lem that can be solved without com-
promise. Nobody has it all right. No-
body has all the answers. No party has 
all the answers. No group of people 
have all the answers. You always are 
better off listening to other people, de-
bating, and coming to some consensus 
solution. 
I have a friend in Maine who has a 
big sign in his office that says: ‘‘All of 
us are always smarter than any of us.’’ 
And I think that is a profound observa-
tion. It means that there is wisdom 
throughout this room and throughout 
this body and that we have to tackle 
these 
difficult 
problems—difficult, 
challenging problems that we have 
using all the wisdom that we could pos-
sibly get our hands on, and that means 
listening to other people even though 
we may not agree with them. 
I just sat and listened to the Senator 
from Oklahoma make an impassioned 
and, I think, powerful statement about 
immigration. He raised questions in 
my mind that I want answers to. That 
is the way this place is supposed to 
work. 
But if I can’t go back to Maine—if I 
can’t go back and admit I listened to 
the Senator today and he raised ques-
tions that bothered me, if I can’t say 
that, if that in itself would endanger 
my career, then if people are coming 
here fearing that kind of being locked 
out, we will never get anything done. 
So, to me, Mike Enzi was a hero and 
a model—and a model of the kind of 
person that we need in this body. I 
didn’t agree with him on a lot of issues, 
but he was always willing to listen. 
And I did agree with him. There was 
some measurable percentage—I don’t 
know, 10, 20, 30 percent—where we did 
agree, and he was a very effective ally 
because he was so respected here be-
cause people knew that he made his 
own decisions. 
And we need more people like him, 
and we need to remember the principle 
that he shared with us, which is be rea-
sonable. 
When we are in a place where being 
reasonable is an offense that can cost 
you your job, we are in real trouble as 
a country. We are in real trouble as a 
democracy. 
It is hard enough in a democracy to 
make decisions and to get things done. 
That is inherent in our system. The 
Framers wanted to design a system 
that was difficult and cumbersome to 
operate, and they succeeded beyond 
their wildest dreams. 
But it was always based upon a prin-
ciple of listening, of debating, of 
changing minds, and, yes, of compro-
mising. 
So I want to pay tribute to Mike Enzi 
today not only because, as I said, he 
was a kind, good, and decent man, but 
because I think he was an example of 
the kind of people that we need here 
and the way we should conduct our-
selves and the way we should do our 
work. 
And we also have to talk to our con-
stituents and say to them: You have to 
let me listen to the other side. You 
have to give me a little space to try to 
do something good. It may not be per-
fect. It may not be just what you like. 
But it may be what we need. It may be 
the best we can do in a pluralistic, 
democratic system, where people have 
different outlooks, viewpoints, values, 
and priorities. 
So we lost a great man this week. We 
lost a great person. We lost a great 
Senator. We lost a great friend. We will 
miss him. 
I miss not only Mike and that great 
smile, but I miss what he stood for, the 
way he conducted himself, the way he 
treated his fellow Senators and every-
one that he encountered. 
Mike Enzi was a great man. I hope we 
can live up to his example. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CRIME 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, let 
me state the obvious: There is a big 
and growing problem in our country, 
and the American people are becoming 
more and more alarmed. 
A recent poll found that 60 percent of 
Americans are worried about crime. 
The percentage of those who say they 
are extremely concerned is at the high-
est point in more than two decades. 
And it is easy to see why. Even our 
former colleague from California, Sen-
ator Barbara Boxer, was recently as-
saulted and robbed in California. But 
cities across our country have experi-
enced an alarming spike in violent 
crime and murder rates. 
New York City has seen nearly dou-
ble the number of shootings from 2019 
to 2020. Nationwide, homicides are up 
25 percent during that same period. 
That is the largest single-year increase 
since 1960. 
Not only are the American people no-
ticing these increases with growing 
alarm, they are eager to see solutions 
that help make things better by im-
proving public safety. 
A recent poll found that 90 percent of 
Detroit residents said they would feel 
safer with more cops on the street, not 
fewer. That seems intuitive. It seems 
obvious but apparently not to every-
body because this is the antithesis of 
the rhetoric we have heard over the 
past year, as many on the left have 
called to defund the police and reduce 
the role that law enforcement officers 
play in our lives. 
A number of major cities took the 
recommendation of these activists and 
eliminated funding for their police 
departments. 
New York City, Oakland, Baltimore, 
are among the many cities to cut po-
lice funding. Today, they are among 
those increasing police budgets to ad-
dress rising crime rates that I think 
are directly related to the ‘‘defund the 
police’’ effort. 
It is important to note that not all 
the leaders of our major cities are on 
board with this trend. Last summer, 
when I was in Dallas visiting my 
friend, Mayor Eric Johnson, it was on 
its way to recording the highest num-
ber of murders in 16 years. The city 
council cut the police department’s 
overtime budget by $7 million. Mayor 
Johnson pushed back against these ir-
responsible cuts at the time when 
crime and domestic violence were al-
ready on the rise, and now he is push-
ing the city to hire 275 new police offi-
cers and increase officers’ salaries. 
The truth of the matter is, Texans, 
like other folks across the country, are 
concerned about the increasing crime 
in their communities. Leaders should 
want to focus on the needs of their con-
stituents, but a small but loud group of 
liberal activists who want to reimagine 
law 
enforcement—whatever 
that 
means—apparently have prevailed on 
those who would like to see our com-
munities safer. 
Well, we are starting to see a re-
sponse, really a boomerang, from these 
‘‘defund the police’’ efforts. For exam-
ple, take a look at the new Democratic 
nominee for mayor of New York City. 
At this point last year, protesters 
marched in the streets of New York 
chanting ‘‘defund the police.’’ One year 
later, the presumed winner is a former 
NYPD captain who ran on a tough-on- 
crime platform. 
As it turns out, practical solutions to 
real problems carry more weight than 
ideological warfare. 
Here in the Senate, we are in the 
process of finding solutions to deliver

tangible results. Our friend, Senator 
TIM SCOTT, is leading negotiations with 
our Democratic colleagues. And I know 
I am not alone in hoping we can take 
bipartisan action to restore trust and 
accountability in our police while at 
the same time having their back. But 
we have to remember that this crime 
surge is tied to far more than police de-
partments. 
Make no mistake, law enforcement 
plays a key role in stopping crime, but 
there is a lot more that can and should 
be done to prevent crime from hap-
pening in the first place. One factor we 
can’t ignore is the crisis on our south-
ern border. Despite the fact that we 
reached migration levels not seen in 
the previous two decades, the Biden ad-
ministration has simply failed to pro-
vide law enforcement with the re-
sources they need in order to secure 
our borders. 
Border Patrol agents, who should be 
on the front lines of this crisis, are car-
ing for children instead of stopping 
criminals and illegal drugs from com-
ing across our border. They are chang-
ing diapers and supervising playtime. 
Meanwhile, the drug cartels, that are 
very sophisticated, understand that 
when you take 40 percent of the Border 
Patrol off the border and have them 
processing 
unaccompanied 
children, 
that that is a prime opportunity to 
smuggle illicit drugs into the United 
States, which, unfortunately, contrib-
uted to the deaths of 93,000 Americans 
last year alone just in drug overdoses. 
So when our Border Patrol is not 
adequately funded and resourced, or be-
cause of bad policy decisions diverted 
from their primary tasks, we don’t 
know who is crossing the border and we 
are creating more risk for our commu-
nities across the country. The lack of 
personnel creates huge gaps; and make 
no mistake, the criminals and cartels 
know how to exploit those gaps. 
In 2019, a 33-year-old Honduran na-
tional was arrested in North Carolina 
on rape and child sex offense charges. 
This man had been previously de-
ported, but he illegally reentered the 
United States. After his arrest, the 
county jail refused to honor the de-
tainer from ICE—Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement—and so the man 
was released. It took 2 months before 
ICE was finally able to arrest him. 
But this type of story is not unique. 
We all remember the tragic murder of 
Kate Steinle in 2015. She and her father 
were walking along a pier in San Fran-
cisco when she was shot and killed. The 
man who killed her was an illegal im-
migrant who had been deported not 
once, not twice, but five times, and he 
had seven felony convictions. 
Now, I want to be clear about one 
point. The actions of these criminals 
do not and should not reflect on the 
tens of millions of law-abiding immi-
grants, period. Any attempt to frame 
immigrants in general as a threat to 
our country is completely devoid of 
facts and detached from reality. But 
my point in sharing these stories is to 
show that there are devastating and 
dangerous consequences to an unfet-
tered flow of people and drugs and 
other contraband across the southern 
border. We need to know exactly who 
and what is crossing our border, and 
this applies both to people and contra-
band. 
Cartels and criminal organizations 
are paying very close attention to the 
state of our border security. They see 
when gaps are created by fewer officers 
on the front lines, and they are simply 
exploiting those gaps. 
Fentanyl, 
heroin, 
cocaine, 
meth-
amphetamine, and marijuana are pour-
ing across our border at a growing rate. 
As 
I 
mentioned, 
there 
are 
con-
sequences, with 93,000 Americans dying 
of drug overdoses last year alone. That 
is up 30 percent over the previous year. 
And the experts tell us there is an as-
sociation between substance abuse and 
crime. There are crimes involving the 
drug users themselves, both who steal 
to buy drugs as well as those who are 
under the influence of drugs when they 
commit their crimes. And we can’t ig-
nore the dangers drug dealers and traf-
fickers create for our communities. 
Last week, the police chief of the 
District of Columbia held a press con-
ference to discuss crime increases in 
this city. He talked about the dangers 
of marijuana use, saying, ‘‘I can tell 
you that marijuana is undoubtedly 
connected to violent crimes that we 
are seeing in our communities.’’ 
He went on to say this creates a very 
dangerous ‘‘situation, because those in-
dividuals get robbed, those individuals 
get shot, those individuals get involved 
in disputes all across our city.’’ 
Those are his words, those are not 
mine. 
But those dangers apply to any type 
of drug being moved and distributed by 
illegal channels, whether it is mari-
juana, heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, or 
anything else. We have a fundamental 
responsibility to stop criminals, stop 
the cartels, stop gang members, stop 
the drug dealers, and the host of un-
known dangers from quietly slipping 
across our border and infiltrating our 
communities. 
The 
Biden-Harris 
administration 
needs to take these responsibilities se-
riously. The Biden-Harris administra-
tion needs to take their responsibilities 
for public safety seriously. The only 
thing worse than the increase in crime 
and the growing concern among the 
public is the prospect of things actu-
ally getting worse. 
If we are not stopping dangerous peo-
ple and drugs at the border, or handi-
capping local police departments by 
defunding them, what do we expect to 
happen? Do we think there will actu-
ally be a positive outcome? 
That is detached from reality, of 
course. The American people are over-
whelmingly concerned about the in-
creasing crime in America, and they 
deserve to have a government that 
prioritizes the safety of them and their 
families. 
Concerns about crime are shared by 
both Republicans and Democrats. My 
friend, the mayor of Dallas, Eric John-
son, who I mentioned a moment ago, 
had to fight with his own city council 
to get the police adequately funded. He 
is a proud Texas Democrat. So these 
are not partisan matters. 
This is not the time to pull critical 
funding from our police or villainize of-
ficers or paint such a broad brush that 
the actions of one taint the reputation 
and our support for the rest of law- 
abiding and patriotic law enforcement 
officers. 
This is not the time to relax our en-
forcement at the border or create even 
more opportunities for crime, cartels, 
and gangs to exploit our laws. 
So crime in America is a very real 
problem, and the Biden administration 
needs to wake up and address this full 
range of contributing factors before the 
situation becomes even more dan-
gerous in all of our communities across 
the States.

MEDICAID SAVES LIVES ACT 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
believe healthcare is a human right. 
And with all the incentives on the 
table for Georgia to expand Medicaid, 
it is past time to do so. My home State 
of Georgia, where State leaders have 
refused to expand Medicaid, has the op-
portunity 
to 
provide 
affordable 
healthcare to 646,000 people who could 
qualify. 
I refuse to allow Georgians to suffer 
and be cut off from care while politi-
cians play games. This is why I intro-
duced recently the Medicaid Saves 
Lives Act. This is legislation that 
would allow people in States like mine, 
that haven’t expanded Medicaid, an al-
ternative path to health coverage; be-
cause for far too many, access to af-
fordable, reliable healthcare is the dif-
ference between life and death. 
I agree with Martin Luther King, Jr., 
who said that, ‘‘of all the injustices, in-
equality in health care is the most 
shocking and the most inhumane.’’ So 
I am grateful that this plan, the Med-
icaid Saves Lives Act, which I intro-
duced the other day, is positioned to be 
included in the forthcoming economic 
package. 
That is why I rise again on the Sen-
ate floor to tell the story of another 
Georgian, a story that gets to the heart 
of why this bill is important. 
This is Amy Bielawski. Amy is the 
owner of a small business, Hare- 
Brained Productions. It is an event

Amy’s company took a significant hit 
during the pandemic. 
Unable to book regular gigs and plan 
events—events that all of us miss as we 
have been clawing our way back from 
this pandemic—Amy qualified for un-
employment benefits this past year. 
And with that critical support, Amy 
had temporary access to affordable 
marketplace plans created by the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
But with the end of Georgia’s unem-
ployment benefits looming and the en-
tertainment sector still suffering from 
the effects of the pandemic, her access 
to coverage—the coverage she so des-
perately needs—is on the brink again. 
At the same time, she will have to 
manage her thyroid disease, high blood 
pressure, 
pituitary 
gland 
tumor, 
fibroids, and all the other health hic-
cups that come along with aging. 
If Georgia was to expand Medicaid or 
if there was a Federal Medicaid Pro-
gram for nonexpansion States like 
Georgia, Amy would no longer have to 
worry about getting reliable health 
coverage for her chronic conditions. 
This is the human face of the public 
policy we make or the public policy we 
fail to make. 
As our State’s healthcare options 
stand now, Amy says she ‘‘doesn’t 
think they care about people like me 
falling through the cracks.’’ Even more 
disappointing, when asked what Med-
icaid expansion would mean for her, 
Amy was reluctant to even picture 
that future. She said: Well, it is really 
difficult to say ‘‘because I’ve never had 
consistent healthcare—it is hard to 
imagine.’’ 
Think about that. It is hard for 
somebody who works every day with a 
kind of entrepreneurial thrust and seri-
ous work ethic, grit, and determina-
tion, in the richest country on the 
planet. She says it is hard for her to 
imagine having consistent healthcare. 
She says she is ‘‘used to being shoved 
aside and doing without.’’ With all of 
Amy’s health issues, doing without, as 
she puts it, can only work for so long. 
We are costing Georgia more and 
more every day by not providing access 
to healthcare to the people who need it 
most. Like Amy’s story speaks to, 
without affordable and comprehensive 
coverage, preventive care and annual 
appointments are skipped. Conditions 
that could perhaps be treated or seen 
at their early stage and prevented, 
worsen, and Georgians end up using 
emergency rooms instead of addressing 
these health issues in primary care ap-
pointments months prior. 
This past year, Amy herself had to go 
to ER because of chest pains, and with 
a history of high blood pressure, she 
couldn’t ignore the sharp pain in her 
chest that wasn’t going anywhere. So 
she made her way to the ER. After all, 
what if it was a heart attack? 
A short stay later, after spending less 
than an hour in a hospital room, she 
went home with a $3,000 bill. That is 
bad policy for her. It is certainly bad 
policy for every Georgian. What kind of 
costs would be avoided, for the hospital 
and for Amy herself, if she had access 
to a primary care provider through 
Medicaid, and more regular, affordable, 
consistent access to care? 
In other States, Amy would be eligi-
ble for Medicaid. And, according to 
Amy, access to reliable, quality, af-
fordable healthcare through Medicaid 
would be nothing short, she says, of 
‘‘MIRACULOUS.’’ 
Amy is one Georgian who represents 
the stories of hundreds of thousands in 
our State and across the country who 
need the Medicaid Saves Lives Act. 
And until we get this done—because I 
believe that healthcare is a human 
right—I am going to keep lifting up 
Amy’s story and the stories of other 
Georgians who would benefit from this 
lifesaving legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
OLYMPICS 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I am 
told that the distinguished Senator 
from Georgia may have some followup 
unanimous consent. OK. If not, I am 
happy to proceed. 
I rise today pointing out an injustice 
done by the authorities running the 
Tokyo Olympics. This morning, Ameri-
cans 
learned 
the 
news 
that 
Sam 
Kendricks, an American double world 
champion pole vaulter from Oxford, 
MS, has been shut out from competing 
at the Tokyo Olympics after a positive 
COVID–19 test today—almost certainly 
a false positive COVID–19 test. This is 
an injustice that can still be rectified 
if the Olympic Committee will be fair. 
For those of you who don’t know 
Sam, he is an alum of the University of 
Mississippi, Ole Miss, where he took 
back-to-back NCAA championships be-
fore launching his professional career. 
He won the U.S. Olympic trials in 2016 
and went on to the Rio Olympics, 
where he took home the bronze medal. 
Then again, you probably do remem-
ber Sam Kendricks. He is the pole 
vaulter who stopped mid-run in the 
2016 Olympics to stand and salute for 
his national anthem. That is Sam 
Kendricks, Olympic champion from the 
State of Mississippi. He has made his 
school, his State, and his Nation very 
proud, and by all accounts he was ex-
pected to be a contender for the gold 
medal this year. 
But after testing negative for the 
COVID virus three times, Sam received 
a positive test result earlier today. The 
timeframe is different in Tokyo, but it 
was on Thursday. And under Inter-
national Olympic Committee rules, he 
was 
immediately 
disqualified 
from 
competition, even though he had pre-
viously tested negative three times and 
even though he has already had the 
coronavirus. And even after a followup 
test, administered according to U.S. 
Olympic standards, came up negative, 
the rules are that you have to wait 6 
days. 
Well, guess what, his competition is 
Friday, and adherence to high-bound 
rules like that will bar him from the 
Olympics. There is no consideration for 
the fact that his test—one of thousands 
of tests administered daily—may very 
well have been a fluke. 
As Sam told the world, he is not sick, 
he is not displaying symptoms, and he 
has already had COVID–19 and should 
be immune. And, again, he tested, ac-
cording to U.S.A. track-and-field team 
tests, immediately after getting this 
false positive. 
Obviously, the fair thing for the 
Olympic Committee to do would be to 
follow up immediately on another test 
to verify whether all these negatives 
were correct and, undoubtedly, they 
were. But the powers that be won’t 
allow Sam Kendricks to get an official 
followup. No, according to protocols, 
he must wait 6 days. Then he can have 
a followup test, which no doubt would 
show 
that 
he 
doesn’t 
have 
the 
coronavirus 
What is magic about 6 days? What 
about the young athlete? What about 
fundamental 
fairness? 
As 
Sam 
Kendricks’ father said: These athletes 
traveled too far, worked for too many 
years, made too many sacrifices not to 
confirm a positive test—a very inex-
pensive thing to do. 
I agree with Mr. Kendricks. These 
athletes should be given a confirming 
test—one test to minimize the chances 
of a false positive. But that is not the 
way the Olympic authorities in Japan 
see it. 
My question is this: What is the 
health risk of a followup test? How 
could it possibly hurt anyone or any-
thing to make sure you have got it 
right when you tell a young American 
that he can’t compete for his Nation in 
the Olympics? 
So I say I am not just disappointed, I 
am outraged, outraged that a young 
athlete is unfairly missing out on his 
chance to show his talent to the world 
and win a gold medal on behalf of his 
country, and aghast that a proud glob-
al tradition like the Olympics, a cele-
bration of sport, competition, and 
international cooperation, has been re-
duced to testing protocols and rigid 
rules that are fundamentally unfair— 
inflexible rules that assume there is no 
such thing as a false positive. 
I send my best wishes and congratu-
lations to Sam Kendricks and his fam-
ily for the good grace they have dis-
played in the face of this unfair and 
pointless disqualification. 
And allow me to state emphatically 
that I am not willing to be so gracious. 
If this action stands—and I hope it 
will not stand—this high-bound deci-
sion by the decisionmakers at Tokyo 
should make them ashamed of them-
selves. It is not too late, even today. It 
is Friday morning in Tokyo. Even 
today, the Olympic committee can use 
common sense and fairness. It is Fri-
day morning in Tokyo. When the Sun 
comes up, give Sam Kendricks a con-
firming test and allow this young man 
to represent his country. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5165 
July 29, 2021 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Utah. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the word 
‘‘republic’’ 
means 
public 
thing 
in 
Latin. 
We bring our different perspectives 
and our different identities together re-
spectfully to make decisions for an en-
tire Nation. The United States is a na-
tion with diverse, varied beliefs, dif-
ferent cultural origins, and different 
politics from the different regions and 
different States that we represent. It 
has been this way from the very begin-
ning. 
As much as some of us imagine oth-
erwise, from the very outset of our Re-
public, there were immense, regional 
differences. Depending on which State 
someone represented, they might have 
different views. 
Now, our Republic—and, for that 
matter, any republic ever in the his-
tory of republics—has relied on the 
willingness of the citizenry to be kind, 
for individuals who play a role in that 
Republic to be kind and respectful and 
decent to each other, even when—espe-
cially when—we disagree with each 
other. Our Founders knew that, and 
they enshrined it into our Constitu-
tion. 
As much as anything, they assumed 
it, and it was on that set of assump-
tions that the norms enshrined in the 
Constitution became possible, because 
without them they would not be. With-
out them none of this would work. 
You see, the only way a republic can 
possibly function now or 250 years ago 
or 250 years from now is that it always 
has to follow a somewhat similar for-
mula. The only way it can function is 
when citizens and leaders are gracious 
to those with whom they disagree and 
grant the freedom necessary to allow 
others to make choices, even if those 
choices might be things that they dis-
agree with. 
We have witnessed the degradation of 
American political discourse for some 
time now. It has been a sad, tragic re-
ality unfolding, but it is not an inex-
orable conclusion. It is not one from 
which we cannot depart. But we must 
make a choice to do better and to 
choose a better path. 
We received a bulletin earlier today— 
a bulletin from the Capitol Police—in-
dicating that all visitors and all House 
staffers and, in fact, all House Members 
are required to wear masks indoors or 
be denied entry or forced to leave the 
premises. And at least in the case of 
staff and visitors, if they fail to com-
ply, they will be arrested—arrested for 
unlawful entry. Conviction for a viola-
tion of this rule will, according to the 
bulletin, be punished by a fine of not 
more than $1,000, imprisonment for not 
more than 6 months, or both. The Sen-
ate, which happens to be housed in the 
same building as the House, is not sub-
ject to these same requirements. 
But is this decision based on science 
or is it based on the will and whim of 
the Speaker of the House of Represent-
atives? Whatever the reason, the arrest 
of peaceful House staffers shows the 
total loss of political grace in the 
House of Representatives. 
I cannot fathom a legitimate reason 
to arrest a person in this building for 
not wearing a mask. I cannot fathom a 
legitimate reason for arresting anyone 
based on a failure to wear a mask. 
Members are not treated as the le-
gitimate representatives of their con-
stituents, as in fact they are, under our 
system of government, when they are 
subjected to this kind of manipulation 
and when they are subjected to this 
type of oppressive order. Staff, under 
this type of oppressive directive, aren’t 
treated 
as 
hard-working, 
dedicated 
Americans, which truly they are. In-
stead, everyone who doesn’t comply is 
deemed the enemy of the current House 
of Representatives. There is no room 
for disagreement or dissent. 
It is tragic, indeed, to see a key de-
liberative body where dissent and de-
bate are supposed to be tolerated and 
appreciated and decided and have been 
not just for decades but for centuries— 
to see that turned into a place where 
disagreement and dissent are disdained 
and punished by arrests. 
Congress works on collegiality and 
respect. We need to get back to those 
basics. 
Regardless of what you might think 
about the coronavirus, about the vac-
cine, about masks, there is never a 
good reason to arrest someone for not 
wearing a mask. 
This decision falls into the larger 
context of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol’s recent flip-flop on masks and the 
Biden administration’s worrying push 
toward masks and vaccination man-
dates. 
The 
CDC 
issued 
updated 
rec-
ommendations earlier this week, stat-
ing at its outset that masks should be 
worn indoors in areas of ‘‘substantial 
or high transmission,’’ even by individ-
uals who have been fully vaccinated. 
Now, this new guidance claims that 
‘‘[e]merging evidence suggests that 
fully vaccinated persons who do be-
come infected with the Delta variant 
are at risk for transmitting it to oth-
ers.’’ But one glaring thing is missing 
from that conclusion: evidence backing 
up the CDC’s claims. 
In fact, the CDC didn’t publish any 
new research on the effectiveness of 
the COVID vaccines against the newer 
variants when it issued its latest edict. 
The CDC’s website simply cites ‘‘un-
published data’’ from its own COVID–19 
Response Team when it makes this 
new, rather significant, rather jarring, 
rather impactful, and rather unwise 
claim. 
The CDC is undermining its own 
credibility and, thus, I believe placing 
public health and safety at risk by 
going back and forth on recommenda-
tions and failing to be upfront about 
whether there is any actual reliable 
scientific evidence to support or com-
pel those recommendations. 
In fact, even when asked questions by 
Members of Congress, the CDC is fail-
ing to respond. This is not hyperbole; 
this is not conjecture; this is based on 
my own personal experience. I will 
point to the fact that on April 24, more 
than 3 months ago, I sent a letter to 
the Centers for Disease Control asking 
a very simple question, a simple ques-
tion that I would hope anyone here 
would want to be asked. I wanted to 
know why is it, when there are so 
many of our peer nations around the 
world that don’t require masks to be 
worn on airplanes, for example, by chil-
dren as young as 2, as we do in the 
United States—you know, many of our 
peer nations, a mask requirement may 
not kick in until 10 or 11 years old or, 
in some cases, 5 or 6 years old. But, 
here, the CDC has said that it has got 
to kick in at 2 years old. I would ask 
the question: Did any of these people 
who made this recommendation, who 
made that conclusion that 2-year-olds 
should have to travel with a mask, 
have they ever known an actual 2-year- 
old? Have they ever raised a child? 
Have they ever traveled on an air-
plane? Have they ever traveled in a car, 
in a bus, on a train, in the rain, any-
where with an actual child? This 
doesn’t work. 
Now, when you add that to the fact 
that children react to the virus dif-
ferently than adults do—and that is 
putting it mildly—when you add that 
to the fact that this creates other prob-
lems for children, not just for those 
handling them but for the kids them-
selves, it makes it especially impor-
tant to know why. 
Now, my letter wasn’t attempting to 
make any case. My letter was simply 
trying to obtain information. You see, 
because when the CDC makes these 
sweeping recommendations, and some-
times they like to make them feel easi-
er by calling them recommendations, 
when, in fact, they precipitate a whole 
host of things that feel a whole lot 
more binding than recommendations. 
You see, because if you get on an air-
plane or a bus or a train or you go to 
a bus depot or a train station or an air-
port, and you have got a 2-year-old who 
won’t wear a mask, as any red-blooded 
American 2-year-old will not do, you 
are told that you are subject to arrest 
and that you are violating Federal law 
if you do that. So it is not unreason-
able to ask that they pony up with in-
formation. If they are going to make 
recommendations, they should explain 
to us what those recommendations are. 
So I asked them what scientific proof 
is there that a 2-year-old needs to wear 
a mask? 
Well, I sent that on April 24. I didn’t 
hear anything on April 25 or April 26 or 
the 27th or the 28th, 29th, or 30th, or 
any of the days of the months of May 
or June or July, and we are almost to 
the end of the month of July. They 
didn’t respond to this. I don’t know 
why. Maybe they are really busy doing 
other stuff. Maybe they are really busy 
figuring out where they are going to 
flip-flop next and where they are going 
to issue their next edict that the Amer-
ican people are expected to follow, all

in the name of it being science, that we 
have to defer to blindly, without any 
evidence. But this isn’t acceptable, and 
it doesn’t inspire confidence, nor does 
it inspire confidence for an Agency 
that makes these sorts of recommenda-
tions that have a really significant im-
pact to flip-flop and not justify its own 
analysis, not provide even a scintilla of 
scientific proof for what it did. 
So let’s get back to its more recent 
flip-flop. The fact that it has flip- 
flopped this week, coupled with the 
fact that it hasn’t backed up its other 
claims over the last few months, is un-
derstandably troubling to many of us, 
especially so, when you consider the 
fact that in my personal experience, I 
have been vaccinated. I chose to get 
the vaccine. I respect those who have 
chosen not to. 
Many of those I have known who 
have been reluctant to get the vaccine, 
who eventually got the vaccine, most 
of them, I would say, ended up getting 
it when they realized that certain as-
pects of life could be made more pre-
dictable and more convenient if they 
did get the vaccine. 
Many people, when they walked into 
a hotel lobby or a restaurant or a gro-
cery store or at Costco or at Sam’s 
Club, if they would see signs saying 
that vaccinated persons need not wear 
masks, they would realize there is 
some benefit there; that if they got the 
vaccine, they could walk in there and 
say, well, I don’t have to wear the 
mask. 
Now, obviously, we don’t ever want 
to get to the point where somebody has 
to wear an arm band to prove whether 
they have been vaccinated or not. In 
fact, it would be an absolutely horri-
fying experiment that we should not 
attempt. But the fact is, that when 
people see that there might be some 
benefit, they are more likely to do it. If 
they see that something different will 
happen in their life if they get the vac-
cine, they are more likely to get it. 
But when you are constantly moving 
the goalpost, you are saying: ‘‘Here are 
the benefits of the vaccine. Oh, psych, 
just kidding. We are moving along. We 
are going to take those away,’’ people 
are not going to get it. So if you want 
more people to get vaccinated, you 
darn well better have the CDC getting 
its act together, providing scientific 
evidence for what the CDC is recom-
mending and what it is not. 
So, look, I am still waiting for an-
swers from the CDC on my April 24 let-
ter. And I am still waiting for answers 
from the CDC when it comes to sci-
entific evidence supporting their most 
recent flip-flop. But while we wait for 
those answers, and that clock is tick-
ing—I don’t know whether we need to 
start humming the tune to ‘‘Jeop-
ardy,’’ but they do need to provide 
those answers. And while we wait for 
those answers, here are a few principles 
that I think might help guide some of 
our discussions: 
Our government needs to trust Amer-
icans to make these decisions, some of 
the most personal decisions that a 
human being can make for themselves. 
We need to trust the people’s rep-
resentatives in Congress to make deci-
sions regarding the law. We need to be 
able to trust each other, to be decent, 
and to be kind when we disagree. 
We have to learn from our own his-
tory, from our own nature as individ-
uals, and from the history that we have 
experienced as a nation. We cannot 
stand by while those in power simply 
decide on their own whim that they are 
going to arrest political opponents for 
disagreeing. 
At what point did we decide that it 
was OK to cross that threshold? I get 
it. We always need to be able to dis-
agree 
without 
being 
disagreeable. 
Sometimes that is really hard. Some-
times all of us fall a little short of that 
mark. But I think all of us should be 
able to agree that we shouldn’t arrest 
those who disagree with us merely be-
cause they disagree with us. That is 
wrong. We are better than that. 
This time calls for more political un-
derstanding and hardy, legitimate de-
bate, not blind mandates and manipu-
lation. 
We have to remember that, at its 
heart, at its core, government is not 
deity. It is neither omniscient nor om-
nipotent. Government doesn’t have 
eyes to see you. It doesn’t have arms 
with which to embrace you. It doesn’t 
have a heart with which to love you. 
Government is force. It is the official 
use of coercive force. 
Now, we need that. We need that to 
protect safety, to make sure that we 
don’t hurt each other; that we are not 
harmed by others; that we don’t take 
each other’s possessions. But we have 
to be very careful how we operate it be-
cause otherwise force is just force. And 
if we start arresting everyone with 
whom we disagree, we are not going to 
be able to do the things we need to do, 
which is to make sure that government 
is there to prevent people from hurting 
each other and taking each other’s 
things. 
We need to be kind to our neighbors, 
even when—especially when—we dis-
agree. We need to be helpful and caring 
to those around us, even if they vote, 
feel, believe, or even act very dif-
ferently than we do. We must not allow 
for arrests and mandates to Members 
of Congress and their staffs without 
providing sufficient evidence. 
And, yes, all of this stuff goes both 
ways. We all need to be respectful of 
each other’s opinions. But, look, we are 
not talking here about activity that, 
by its very nature, is so harmful that it 
warrants the use of blunt political 
force in the form of an arrest. 
I cannot fathom a circumstance in 
which it is ever appropriate to arrest 
another human being for not wearing a 
mask, COVID or no COVID. That is not 
arrest material. 
In Congress and across the country, 
what we need now is a return to Amer-
ican graciousness. Our way of life and 
our precious Republic are at stake. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to come and join my col-
leagues on the floor today and have a 
discussion about what is taking place 
here in this Capitol Building. 
Now, my colleague from Utah just 
mentioned something that I think is so 
important: 
being 
able 
to 
disagree 
agreeably, having a difference of opin-
ion, and showing respect to other peo-
ple. 
This Nation has remained strong and 
vibrant and free because we believe in 
robust, respectful, bipartisan debate. 
We do not lock up or silence or push or 
disappear people who disagree with us 
and our beliefs—and what we see hap-
pening in the House, where the Capitol 
Police would have the ability to haul 
staffers and visitors to jail for their de-
cision not to wear a mask. 
Now, think about that. It would be 
not wearing a mask—a choice, making 
a choice to not wear a mask. So it is 
important for us to realize this is a dif-
ference of opinion. 
We have told the American people: 
Get vaccinated. I have chosen to be 
vaccinated. So have most of my family. 
Get the vaccine. That is kind of like 
your ticket to freedom from wearing a 
mask, if you choose. You don’t have to 
put that mask on if you get vaccinated. 
But now what are we hearing? Masks 
are coming back. The science is very 
divided on the value of a mask. Is it 
just to protect you? Is it to protect 
others? Do masks serve as a disincen-
tive for people to actually get the vac-
cine? Which is what we have encour-
aged people to do: Talk to your physi-
cian, make certain the vaccine is right 
for you, and get the vaccine so you 
don’t have to wear the mask. 
Now, one of the things that we know 
is this: COVID is here to stay. We are 
going to continue to have COVID–19 in 
our presence. We know that, but we 
also know that this that is happening 
today is not necessarily about masks. 
This is about continuing to perpetrate 
these lockdowns; that we have had a 
series of lockdowns and scares and 
things where we are pulling back on 
freedom and giving power to the gov-
ernment and lessening the ability for 
individual choices. That is what this is 
about. 
There is no deliberation that appears 
to have gone into this newest mandate 
from the Speaker of the House, but you 
don’t need deliberation when you have 
decided that you can just resort to 
threats such as this: locking up staffers 
and visitors if they do not wear a mask 
on the House side. 
Just over the past few days, we have 
seen high-profile Democrats buying 
right into this new tactic. Here is some 
of what we have been hearing. And, you 
know, as a mom and a grandmom, I 
hear a lot from moms and grandmoms. 
And my text threads and email and 
phone calls—Mr. President, you just 
wouldn’t even believe it. They feel like

our colleagues across the aisle are just 
forgetting that science—science—has 
weighed in on this issue. 
And now they are hearing these 
threats, threatening to keep our chil-
dren out of school, not letting them go 
back to school in September. We don’t 
need to go to school. Teachers unions, 
not sure they want to go back to school 
in September. But, oh, by the way, if 
you do go back to school, they might 
want to put your children in masks. 
Children, little kids in school, we 
have heard it from pediatricians, we 
have all read the articles—there are 
truly some adverse side effects to little 
children being told to wear a mask 
every day. There are physical, there 
are emotional, there are psychological 
adverse effects to these children—not 
mentioning some I have heard from pe-
diatricians about the danger of chil-
dren not knowing how to wear the 
mask. And they touch the mask, and 
then they put a dirty mask back up 
over their nose and their mouth and 
the concerns that that brings. 
What we are hearing about our chil-
dren in school is of tremendous concern 
to the moms who are out there. We are 
hearing they are threatening families 
and small businesses with yet another 
lockdown to come. 
I have a lot of friends who are in the 
retail industry. And right now, you 
know what they are doing? They are 
beginning to get in merchandise for the 
fourth quarter. They have used their 
lines of credit to make certain there is 
merchandise in their stores. 
These are mom-and-pop stores. These 
are small businesses. They are on Main 
Street in every small town in this 
country, just like they are in Ten-
nessee. And the decisions that are 
being made here make them very nerv-
ous and very uncomfortable because 
they are thinking: All right. What if we 
go into a lockdown? What if people 
can’t get into my store? And here I 
have finally made it through COVID 
and I am looking forward to a good 
fourth quarter, and now we are getting 
this kind of information out of Wash-
ington, DC. 
All of this is not rational. There is no 
evidence—none—to suggest that yet 
another about-face on masking is going 
to keep people healthier, is going to 
make them healthier. There is no evi-
dence for that. 
So let’s call it what it is. This is left-
wing hysteria. This is hysteria. Fright-
en 
people. 
Make 
them 
think 
a 
lockdown is coming. Make them think 
things are worse than what they are. 
No. This is the United States of 
America. We do not lock up people we 
disagree with. We don’t push forward 
with this type of activity. We don’t si-
lence our opponents. We believe in free 
speech. We believe in individuals being 
able to make their choices. 
And I think that it is fair to say what 
the Speaker of the House has done is 
not trusting the science that brought 
us this vaccine. And thank goodness 
President Donald Trump brought about 
Operation Warp Speed and issued a 
challenge to our Federal Agencies, 
issued a challenge to our pharma-
ceutical companies, and said: Let’s see 
if we can find a way to defeat this 
virus. 
There is a vaccine there. I think 
what you see happening with the 
Democrats and with the Speaker of the 
House is what we in Tennessee call 
having a good old-fashioned come- 
apart because they are not getting 
their way. 
And the American people do not be-
lieve that they are getting serious 
about doing serious business that the 
American people want to see: address-
ing out-of-control spending, addressing 
the needs of this country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in 1887, 
Lord Acton wrote a series of letters to 
Bishop Creighton, letters that would 
echo down across the centuries. Lord 
Acton wrote: 
I cannot accept your canon that we are to 
judge Pope and King unlike other men, with 
a favourable presumption that they did no 
wrong. If there is any presumption it is the 
other way against holders of power, increas-
ing as the power increases. Historic responsi-
bility has to make up for the want of legal 
responsibility. Power tends to corrupt and 
absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great 
men are almost [exclusively] bad men, even 
when they exercise influence and not author-
ity: still more when you superadd the tend-
ency or the certainty of corruption by au-
thority. 
Mr. President, those words were true 
in 1887, and they are true today. If you 
want to understand how power corrupts 
and absolute power corrupts abso-
lutely, look no further than the other 
Chamber in the U.S. Capitol. 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI is drunk on 
power. The orders that Speaker PELOSI 
is issuing are abusive and unprece-
dented. Speaker PELOSI has decreed to 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives, elected by the people, that: If 
you dare walk onto the floor of the 
House of Representatives without a 
mask, I, Speaker PELOSI, shall fine 
you. 
Who the hell is she to be fining Mem-
bers of the House? 
But you know what? She is not done 
with that. She is not done with dis-
respecting 
our 
Constitution, 
dis-
respecting our democratic system that 
elects leaders. She goes further, to the 
good men and women who work here in 
the U.S. Capitol. We are surrounded by 
men and women who have chosen to 
come and work for the public good, and 
here is what Speaker PELOSI has de-
creed: If you dare walk in the hallway 
without a mask, I, Speaker PELOSI, will 
arrest you. I will put you in jail. I will 
fine you. 
That is an absolute and complete 
abuse of power. She has no authority to 
disrespect the men and women who 
work here, to threaten you with phys-
ical harm, to threaten you with impris-
onment. 
And why does she do so? 
She does so for one reason: political 
theater. 
We are coming through a very dif-
ficult year and a half. Our Nation and 
the world has endured a pandemic. We 
have collectively taken extraordinary 
steps to defeat this pandemic, and we 
are coming out on the other side. We 
saw our Nation, we saw the private sec-
tor come together with remarkable in-
ventiveness and produce vaccines in 
record times, and we have seen hun-
dreds of millions of people getting 
those vaccines. We are in the process of 
beating this pandemic. 
Not too long ago, the CDC recognized 
what was obvious then and is obvious 
now: vaccines work. And if you are vac-
cinated, you don’t need to wear a 
mask. 
The CDC issued that ruling, and I re-
member that day well. I had been vac-
cinated a couple of months before then, 
and after allowing the time for the vac-
cine to become effective, I decided I 
was going to stop wearing a mask. Why 
is that? Because vaccines work, be-
cause I believe in science. So I stopped 
wearing a mask. And there were a 
handful of Senators on the Senate floor 
who had been vaccinated, who stopped 
wearing masks. 
Then the CDC, like the Oracle of Del-
phi, issued its proclamation. Hold on to 
your seats now. The CDC said that vac-
cines work, that if you are vaccinated, 
you don’t need a mask. It was truly mi-
raculous in this Chamber watching 
what occurred, as within days, every 
Senator in the Chamber began remov-
ing their masks, one after the other, 
after the other—not just Republicans; 
Democrats too. We all had our masks 
off. 
Mr. President, I ask you, the day be-
fore the oracle of Fauci spoke, did vac-
cines not work? Did science not oper-
ate? No. It was obvious then and it was 
obvious on the day that the oracle of 
the CDC spoke that vaccines work, 
which is why every Democrat took 
their mask off. 
But fast-forward to this week. The 
CDC issues the new proclamation. Ap-
parently, according to the CDC, vac-
cines 
don’t 
work 
anymore. 
That 
science thing? Inoperative. We have 
more important things to worry about, 
like politics. 
As an aside, has there ever been an 
institution in American public life that 
has more discredited itself more rap-
idly than the CDC? A year and a half 
ago, the CDC was one of the most re-
spected medical and scientific organi-
zations on the face of the planet. 
Today, the CDC has willingly allowed 
itself to be politicized, to behave as an 
arm of the DNC, and their credibility is 
in tatters. It is a joke. 
We have seen the emails from Dr. 
Fauci where he said in the midst of the 
pandemic: Masks don’t work. They are 
not effective. People shouldn’t use 
them. 
Then we saw him say: Oh, no, no, no; 
masks work. But I lied to the Amer-
ican people when I said they didn’t

work because I didn’t want them to 
wear masks because I wanted first re-
sponders to get them. 
Now, pause for a second and think, 
what the heck is a scientific leader 
doing lying to the American people 
supposedly for our own good? The will-
ingness to twist facts to meet political 
expediency has been stunning. 
The CDC’s ruling this week is not ac-
companied by any data. They did not 
roll out studies. They did not roll out 
facts. They did not say suddenly vac-
cines aren’t working. Instead, they just 
said: Trust us. We have double-super- 
secret studies that we are not going to 
tell you based on double-secret-super 
data that we are not going to show 
you, but trust us because we behave 
like political hacks and obey us any-
way. 
By the way, the CDC plays an inter-
esting little game. The CDC says: 
These are recommendations. These are 
just recommendations. 
Then their faithful little foot sol-
diers, the Democratic officeholders, 
come in and make those recommenda-
tions mandates. And there is no one 
more willing to do so than Speaker 
PELOSI. And then, by the way, the local 
government Democrats who mandate 
‘‘you must obey the CDC,’’ they throw 
their hands up and say: Hey, we are 
just following the CDC. And the CDC 
says: Hey, we are just making rec-
ommendations. And no one is account-
able for anything. 
This makes no sense. 
One of the things the CDC rolled out 
this week is an edict that in schools, 
everybody 
must 
be 
masked—child, 
adult. It doesn’t matter if you are vac-
cinated; it doesn’t matter; you must 
wear a mask. Why? Who knows? It is 
not based on science, not based on med-
icine. 
This virus has been unusual. We have 
seen 
that 
in 
certain 
populations, 
COVID–19 can be profoundly deadly. If 
you are very elderly, if you have seri-
ous comorbidities, this virus can and 
has been deadly. But we have also seen 
among children that the odds of chil-
dren getting seriously ill from COVID– 
19 are extremely low. We have seen 
that children have not proven to be a 
meaningful vector in the spread of this 
disease. The science doesn’t support 
special rules for schools, but do you 
know what does? Politics. Because the 
teachers union bosses came to the CDC 
and said: We want this rule in place. 
And the partisan enforcers at the CDC 
said: Ma’am, yes, ma’am, we will issue 
the order demanded by the union 
bosses. 
Mr. President, give me any plausible 
argument that that is science, that 
that is medicine, that that is anything 
but rank politics. If a Democratic poli-
tician wants to say ‘‘We are going to 
obey the union bosses,’’ fine; that is 
their prerogative to do so. They can be 
held accountable by the voters. But the 
CDC 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
following 
science. This is an abuse of power. 
Let me point out my view. I think we 
should not have government mandates 
concerning COVID–19. There should be 
no vaccine mandates. Joe Biden wants 
to mandate Federal employees must 
get the vaccine. Who the heck is the 
Federal Government to tell people they 
must stick a needle in their arm and 
inject themselves with a vaccine? We 
should have no vaccine mandates. We 
should have no mask mandates. We 
should have no vaccine passports. 
Let me be clear. I am someone who 
believes in vaccines. I have been vac-
cinated. Heidi has been vaccinated. My 
parents have been vaccinated. Heidi’s 
parents have been vaccinated. But I 
also believe in individual choice. I be-
lieve in freedom. I believe in responsi-
bility. It is your choice if you want to 
get vaccinated. It is not some drunk- 
on-power Democrat in Washington’s 
choice to force you to do it. 
Doesn’t anyone in the Democratic 
Party believe in medical autonomy? 
Doesn’t anyone in the Democratic 
Party believe in medical privacy, or 
are you so willing to exert power that 
it doesn’t matter what the people say? 
You know, one of the great ironies of 
the CDC’s order: It will decrease the 
rate of vaccination in the United 
States. The CDC is telling America: 
Hey, this vaccine stuff doesn’t work 
very well because, you know, if you get 
a vaccine, it doesn’t matter; you have 
to put the same mask on, and you have 
to behave exactly the same. When the 
CDC rightly said ‘‘If you are vac-
cinated, take your mask off,’’ it en-
couraged people to get vaccinated. Hey, 
I want to take my mask off. Hey, I 
want to live my life. I want to go back 
to doing things that I like to do. 
Let me point out one particularly ri-
diculous argument. This week, one of 
the commentators on one of the news 
networks said—I am paraphrasing here, 
but I am paraphrasing pretty closely— 
that anyone who isn’t vaccinated is ar-
rogant and rude and inconsiderate. 
I want to point out how imbecilic 
that argument is. So let’s go back to 
this thing called science, which actu-
ally works. So here is the science: If 
you have been vaccinated, the odds of 
your getting COVID–19 are exception-
ally low. Depending on which vaccine 
you got, the percentages vary but let’s 
say on the order of 3 to 5 percent. Even 
if you do get COVID–19, the odds of 
your getting a serious case of COVID– 
19, a case of COVID–19 resulting in hos-
pitalization or death, are extremely 
low. This vaccine has been very, very 
successful. 
If you understand that basic fact, 
then the next fact follows from it. If 
someone 
is 
unvaccinated 
and 
has 
COVID, they are little to no threat to 
someone who is vaccinated. If you have 
gotten your vaccine, you ought to be 
fine. The odds are very low that you 
are in jeopardy. 
Now, 
could 
someone 
who 
is 
unvaccinated give COVID to someone 
else who is unvaccinated? Absolutely. 
That is why we are encouraging people 
to get vaccinated. But, you know what, 
the person who is unvaccinated—it is 
their damn choice. We don’t have to be 
a nanny state, making decisions for ev-
erybody else. 
I have to tell you, in my family, my 
dad didn’t want to get vaccinated. My 
father, like the Presiding Officer right 
now, is a pastor. My dad is 82. 
When I got vaccinated, I called him 
and said: Dad, I want you to get vac-
cinated. 
He said: No, I don’t want to. I don’t 
trust it. It is new. I don’t know. I don’t 
want to. 
I spent about a month trying to con-
vince my dad to get vaccinated. My fa-
ther can be pretty stubborn. I know 
that is hard to believe. For those of 
you who know my dad, you know ex-
actly that is the case. 
But, ultimately, I told my dad—I 
said: Look, you have been largely stay-
ing home during this pandemic. You 
want to get out. You want to be 
preaching in churches again. You want 
to be traveling. You want to be with 
people. Get the vaccine, and you will 
have the freedom to go do that. 
You know what. He did, and he did. 
He is now back in the pulpit. He is 
back preaching. He has freedom again. 
That was his choice. 
Why don’t Democrats believe in indi-
vidual choice anymore? Why do Demo-
crats believe they can abuse power? 
And let me be clear. NANCY PELOSI is 
telling someone who is an employee of 
the House: If you are vaccinated and 
you don’t wear your mask—she will ar-
rest you and throw you in jail. 
How dare she? That is an abuse of 
power. And I will tell you, the Amer-
ican people are watching this political 
theater play out in Washington, and 
they understand what is coming next. 
They understand the same CDC that 
said, even though there is no science to 
back it up, even though there is no 
data to back it up, because the teach-
ers union bosses want masks for every-
one in schools, we will decree it. They 
understand the risk of what is coming 
next 
is 
that 
authoritarian 
status 
Democrats will order more shutdowns. 
We will order businesses shut down. We 
will order schools shut down. We will 
order churches shut down. 
As we look at the past year and a 
half, few things are clearer than that 
the shutdowns were a catastrophic mis-
take. The politicians who ordered the 
shutdowns committed a catastrophic 
mistake. They destroyed millions of 
small 
businesses—restaurants, 
bars, 
stores gone out of business. 
You look at great cities like New 
York City that became practically a 
wasteland. You look at something like 
Broadway. You think of all the actors 
and actresses, all of the writers and 
musicians, all of the sound and lighting 
engineers, all the carpenters, everyone 
who worked on Broadway—with a dic-
tatorial flick of a pen, their jobs were 
destroyed. The American people are 
watching 
Democrats 
and 
recognize 
they are ready to do that again. 
For people who go to church, we have 
seen Democratic officeholders discrimi-
nate against churches and say: Wor-
shipping God in church is a public

health menace. We have all seen the 
hypocrisy of the so-called experts who 
say: If you go outside and march and 
chant ‘‘Black lives matter,’’ zero risk 
of COVID transmission. Perfectly safe. 
If you go to church and sing ‘‘Halle-
lujah,’’ oh my God, everyone is going 
to die. People understand the hypoc-
risy of that. 
This virus isn’t political. I recognize 
perhaps 
you 
could 
tongue-in-cheek 
make an argument that since it origi-
nated in Wuhan, China, maybe it is a 
Communist. But the last I checked, vi-
ruses don’t have political views. Do 
you know who does have political 
views? Politicians who are interested 
in their own power and want to convey 
a narrative regardless of the facts. 
What Speaker PELOSI
is doing is 
wrong. What the CDC is doing—cor-
rupting science with politics—is wrong. 
And it is time for the U.S. Senate and 
the U.S. House to stand on the side of 
the American people, to stand on the 
side of freedom, and to say: It is your 
choice to go to work, to go to school, 
to go to church, to live your life free of 
Lord Acton’s abuse of absolute power. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as we have 
undertaken this conversation, I can’t 
help but reflect on the fact that we are 
here in a representative body. We are 
here in order to have an exchange of 
ideas. We are here to engage in polit-
ical speech, not the kind of political 
speech that people think of when they 
think of the word ‘‘politics,’’ where 
they think of something necessarily 
unpleasant. You know, when people 
hear the word ‘‘political’’ or ‘‘politics,’’ 
they think of the two great roots of the 
word ‘‘politics.’’ You have poly, which 
means many; and ticks, which are 
blood-sucking parasites. And they as-
sume if it is political, it is unpleasant. 
But I am using the word ‘‘political’’ 
here in a different sense, the sense that 
refers to the body politic. It refers to 
the fact that we are doing the people’s 
business. The exchange of information, 
of ideas is essential to everything we 
do. 
Then it occurs to me that the mask 
discussion does carry a deeper meaning 
here, a deeper meaning that takes into 
account the fact that when we commu-
nicate—sometimes with words, some-
times without words, sometimes in 
print, sometimes with the spoken 
word, sometimes without any words at 
all—we are engaging in activity that is 
protected by the First Amendment. 
Now, this is important to note in a 
wide swath of areas. It is important for 
how we worship or decline to do the 
same. It is important in how we ex-
press our viewpoints in our news, in 
our entertainment, media. In every as-
pect of our lives, it is important. 
It is regarded as especially important 
in a body politic that people be able to 
express their feelings about govern-
ment and about the role of govern-
ment. It is also especially important 
here that people be able to speak and 
otherwise communicate in a way that 
is clear and unvarnished, unfiltered. 
In fact, we go so far even as to pro-
tect Members of Congress from liabil-
ity in what they would say on the floor 
of the Senate or the House of Rep-
resentatives. We do that because we 
feel that a full, frank, informed discus-
sion is important. We don’t want Mem-
bers being threatened with some sort of 
action, civil or criminal, based on 
things that they would utter here. 
So freedom of speech is important for 
all citizens. It is also important to 
make sure that that freedom of speech 
is protected here. 
It occurs to me that with the ques-
tion of masks, the decision whether to 
wear a mask is not only deeply per-
sonal, but it is also, in this context, 
quite arguably expressive. Even before 
you utter a single word and regardless 
of whether you utter a single word, in 
many respects, your decision to wear a 
mask or not wear a mask is, itself, a 
form of expression. And as a form of 
suppression, it is protected. 
In a long line of cases, the Supreme 
Court of the United States has identi-
fied conduct that is expressive and 
therefore 
protected 
by 
the 
First 
Amendment, notwithstanding the fact 
that it doesn’t necessarily involve 
words. 
When you merge that with another 
line of analysis under First Amend-
ment jurisprudence, we remember the 
fact that it is a problem whenever gov-
ernment suppresses speech in one way 
or another. It is especially problematic 
when the government tries to compel 
speech. When the government tries to 
direct an individual that he or she 
must utter certain words in order to be 
compliant with the dictates of the gov-
ernment, that implicates the com-
pelled speech doctrine, and the com-
pelled speech doctrine is an especially 
rigid one. It is an especially rigid one 
with very good reason. 
You don’t want to force people to say 
stuff. That is the not government’s 
role. That is the whole idea behind the 
First Amendment, is that the govern-
ment 
needs 
to 
stay 
out 
of 
our 
headspace. It needs to stay out of 
where we worship; it needs to stay out 
of our relationship with God; it needs 
to stay out of printing presses; and it 
needs to stay out of what we say. 
Sometimes what we say can consist 
of things that don’t even involve 
words, something as simple as whether 
or not to wear a mask. In addition to 
all of the other public policy reasons, 
in addition to all the problems with 
having a CDC issuing these sweeping 
mandates and edicts without bothering 
to back up those edicts with scientific 
justification—even after months and 
months of receiving inquiries from 
Members of the U.S. Senate that they 
do so—separate and apart from all of 
those issues, I think it is important for 
us to look at the speech element, the 
expressive conduct that is inherent in 
whether or not you wear a mask, and 
whether or not by compelling people to 
wear a mask, you are compelling peo-
ple 
to 
engage 
in 
state-sponsored 
speech. You are telling them that they 
must send a message, a message with 
which they may well disagree. 
Now, if I am wrong on this, if this is 
strictly a medical issue, then it will be 
backed up by scientific medical evi-
dence. That is the nature of the prob-
lem that I have with the CDC’s man-
date, its ever-fluctuating mandate, its 
mandate that, as recently as a few days 
ago, flip-flopped yet again. If, in fact, 
it were medical and scientific, it would 
be backed up as such, but it is not. 
This is a form of compelled speech, 
not as we traditionally understand it 
because compelled speech usually in-
volves the utterance of specific words. 
But we know that speech can be pro-
tected, even if it doesn’t involve words, 
if it is a type of expressive conduct, 
which wearing a mask is, especially if 
as here. We don’t have scientific evi-
dence making it a medical issue. 
So I would ask the Speaker of the 
House: Are you really going to arrest 
people for not saying what you want 
them to say? That is not OK. If it 
would never be OK for you to arrest 
people for not saying words that you 
have prescribed for them, why is it OK 
for you to compel them to engage in 
expressive conduct now amounting to 
speech? It is not. 
Make no mistake, this isn’t medical. 
This isn’t scientific. If it were, we 
would have evidence of such. We don’t. 
In light of that, separate and apart 
from all the other problems—problems 
that inhere in our form of government, 
problems that inhere in the fact we do, 
in fact, have three distinct branches of 
our Federal Government, that most 
laws are not Federal laws to begin 
with. Most laws originate in the States 
and in the localities. Most laws are not 
Federal, and they should never be. 
But for those things that should be 
Federal laws, we have got one and only 
one branch of government that makes 
laws. It is no coincidence that the very 
first clause of the very first section of 
the very first article of the Constitu-
tion provides: 
All legislative Powers herein granted shall 
be vested in a Congress of the United States, 
which shall consist of a Senate and a House 
of Representatives. 
Article I, section 7 then goes on to 
outline the formula contemplated in 
article I, section 1. In article I, section 
7, it says that you can’t make a law 
under our form of government—at least 
not a Federal law—without passage in 
the House of Representatives and pas-
sage in the Senate and presentment to 
the President of the United States. 
In many respects, these recommenda-
tions issued by the CDC end up car-
rying the force of generally applicable 
Federal law. That is wrong. And in 
many, many respects, that is on us. We 
have done a horrible job over the last 
few years—I would say over the last 
few decades—I would say over the last 
80, 85 years, really. I won’t lay the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5170 
July 29, 2021 
blame entirely at the feet of either 
party. In fact, this has happened under 
the control of different parties. It has 
happened with Senates and Houses of 
Representatives and White Houses of 
every conceivable partisan combina-
tion. We have seen the de facto out-
sourcing of our lawmaking authority 
to unelected, unidentifiable bureau-
crats; men and women who, while well- 
educated, well-intentioned, hard-work-
ing, and highly specialized, don’t work 
for the people. They don’t work for 
you. You do not have the ability to 
elect them or unelect them. 
You don’t have the authority to re-
place them. That is why it is so dan-
gerous for us to give them this sweep-
ing authority. And even where they 
don’t technically have authority that 
extends very far—and in this case, it is 
far too far, as evidenced by the fact 
that anytime you get on an airplane or 
other mode of public transportation, 
you are told that, under penalty of 
Federal law, you must wear a mask. 
But I would ask, where is the act of 
Congress providing that? In what year 
did the Congress of the United States 
pass through the House and through 
the Senate and submit to the President 
of the United States for signature or 
veto a law stating that you must wear 
a mask on a plane or a train or a bus 
or in a bus depot or in a train station 
or in an airport under penalty of Fed-
eral law? There is no such law. You 
will not find it. 
Now, you will find some other stuff 
in which we delegated far too much au-
thority and given broad authority to 
the executive branch—to people like 
the CDC—to issue regulations. But as a 
matter of proper form, whenever they 
exercise that power, it is not appro-
priate for that to take effect by itself. 
It is not really a law in the constitu-
tional sense of the word unless Con-
gress has enacted it. 
We have given them far too much 
power anyway. That is on us. We 
shouldn’t do that. That is why I have 
been calling for years for reforms to 
this; why I have been calling for years 
for reforms, including but not limited 
to the REINS Act, which would require 
for any economically significant Fed-
eral regulation, before it takes effect, 
it must be passed by both Houses of 
Congress and presented to the Presi-
dent for signature or veto. It is why I 
have introduced the Global Trade Ac-
countability Act, which would do for 
trade policy what the REINS Act does 
for regulatory policy. It is why we need 
to reform so many aspects of our laws, 
where we, as a practical matter, made 
the unelected and the unaccountable 
the supreme lawgivers, the lawmakers, 
law interpreters, and law enforcers. 
This is not just something that can 
lead to tyranny; it is the very defini-
tion of tyranny, as every signer of the 
U.S. Constitution understood well. It is 
why they went to great lengths to sep-
arate out these three branches of gov-
ernment. 
In addition to those problems with 
these edicts not based on science or 
medicine but based on political consid-
erations that are ever-changing—it is 
why they are so sweeping. It is why 
they are so troubling. 
But they are maybe even more trou-
bling, still, for the additional constitu-
tional reason that, at the end of the 
day, to whatever degree these are not 
rooted in medical science and fact— 
which I believe they are not or at least 
the CDC hasn’t established as much, 
and they really do amount to some-
thing compelling expressive conduct, 
the suppression of an official orthodoxy 
mandated 
by 
the 
government—we 
shouldn’t accept this. We shouldn’t ac-
cept any affirmative legal obligation 
placed on those we represent, to whom 
and for whose been we have sworn an 
oath to uphold, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, 
which requires us to make any law we 
force on the American people. We have 
an obligation to them, a solemn obliga-
tion to make sure they are not subject 
to laws made by those not of their own 
choosing. 
It is these very features that James 
Madison had in mind when he authored 
Federalist No. 62. When he wrote, and I 
am paraphrasing a little bit here: It 
will be of little benefit to the American 
people that their laws may be written 
by men of their own choosing if those 
laws be so voluminous, complex, and 
ever-changing, if they can’t reasonably 
understand what the law means and 
predict what it will say from one day 
to the next. 
Today—this week even—we have seen 
the law be so unpredictable and ever- 
changing, that we can’t expect what 
the law says from one day to another. 
But even worse, contrary to what 
Madison assumed would always be the 
case because the Constitution required 
it, the laws aren’t even being written 
by men and women of our own choosing 
but instead by unelected, unaccount-
able bureaucrats who, despite how 
well-educated, well-intentioned, hard- 
working, and highly-specialized they 
may be, don’t work for you, nor do 
they have authority under this docu-
ment, to which we have all sworn an 
oath, to make laws. 
That is our power. Shame on us if we 
relinquish to them the power that only 
we can exercise, that is, itself, nondele-
gable. Shame on us, further, if we allow 
those same people who, lacking the au-
thority to legislate in the first in-
stance, then transgress another affirm-
ative constitutional command by com-
pelling compliance with official gov-
ernment-mandated orthodoxy. 
This cannot be. This cannot stand. I 
will not stand for it, and I will con-
tinue to draw attention to this issue 
until we have resolved the problem. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

ator from New Mexico.

transparent and accountable. 
But as you folks know, the task of sup-
porting whistleblowers doesn’t start and stop 
on July 30th.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5173 
July 29, 2021 
It’s a year round job. 
And here in the Congress, it’s something 
we’ve been working at for decades. 
When I first came to Washington in the 
1970s, many of the whistleblower laws we 
take for granted today didn’t exist at all. 
Anybody who dared to blow the whistle 
back then was about as welcome as a skunk 
at a picnic. 
Of course the real skunks were usually 
there among the crowd trying to build a 
scare, chase the whistleblower away, and de-
stroy their reputation. 
That’s still true today. 
But now it’s a lot harder for those people 
to get off the hook. 
That’s because whistleblowers today have 
a lot more protections than they did years 
ago, and they have important advocates in 
their corner, such as the IG community, who 
are there to support them. 
And when they don’t, I call them out for it. 
You may have heard that I recently rec-
ommended that President Biden fire FHFA 
IG Laura Wertheimer. 
Last month, the IG decided to resign effec-
tive July 31st. 
It’s unusual for me to ask the President to 
fire an IG. In fact, you may recall that in 
past years, I’ve written letters to Presidents 
Obama and Trump when they fired IGs with-
out providing reasons to Congress as re-
quired by law. 
But this was a clear cut case. 
I started investigating IG Wertheimer 
years ago. 
Whistleblowers were the ones who first 
brought concerns about the IG to my atten-
tion. 
They said she was abusing her staff, mak-
ing fun of them for things like their weight 
and medical disabilities. 
She was even retaliating against some of 
the whistleblowers who spoke to my office. 
After I saw just how bad things were, I 
asked the Inspector General Community’s 
Integrity Committee to conduct their own 
investigation. 
They validated many of the whistle-
blowers’ claims and called for her to be re-
moved. 
Earlier this month, there was concern that 
the IG’s Chief Counsel, who was found to 
have obstructed the Integrity Committee’s 
investigation and was recommended for dis-
ciplinary action, could become the new Act-
ing IG. 
So I wrote to President Biden, urging him 
to appoint a qualified individual for the Act-
ing IG position and swiftly nominate a per-
manent replacement who will respect their 
staff and protect whistleblowers the way 
they are supposed to as an IG, instead of re-
taliating against them. 
My ongoing work to support whistle-
blowers also involves new legislation. 
One bill that we passed recently involves 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
Whistleblower Program. 
Since that program was created, whistle-
blowers in the commodities industry have 
been coming forward in unprecedented num-
bers to report fraud and abuse. 
We reached a point within the last year 
where the upcoming awards were so large, 
the fund was in danger of not having enough 
cash on-hand to pay whistleblower office 
staff. 
My CFTC Fund Management Act, which 
passed the Congress in June, now allows the 
Commission to set aside money in a separate 
account to ensure that staff are paid and this 
highly successful whistleblower office can re-
main open. 
I also have several other bipartisan whis-
tleblower bills I intend to pass this congress. 
I’m working on legislation that will 
strengthen incentives and protections for 
whistleblowers who report potential money 
laundering, as well as whistleblower protec-
tions for FBI employees. 
And I have bills to further strengthen the 
False Claims Act and Program Fraud Civil 
Remedies Act. 
So, as much as we’ve accomplished to-
gether, there’s still more to be done. 
In closing, I want to thank you all for the 
role you play in bringing attention to whis-
tleblower issues and advocating on behalf of 
whistleblowers. 
Your service in support of whistleblower 
issues is a service to our country and all the 
ideals of good government that I’ve spent my 
career working to promote. 
So please go forward and continue doing 
the good work that you’ve been doing all 
along. 
Together, let’s make sure the whistle-
blower laws and protections we have in place 
next year and the year after are even strong-
er than the ones we have in place today. 
Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO RICK SHANKLIN 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, July 31, 
2021, marks the retirement of Rick 
Shanklin, whose remarkable career 
with the National Weather Service 
spans several decades. 
Though Rick hails from a small 
farming community near Hopkinsville 
in Christian County, most of his career 
has been spent at the NWS office in Pa-
ducah, KY, where he was the warning 
coordination meteorologist. 
He has served at all three National 
Weather Service operations in Ken-
tucky, has been a forecaster, worked 
with countless tornado drills and na-
tional assessment teams, and pursued 
his passion for operational readiness 
and public severe weather prepared-
ness, earning many honors along the 
way from the Department of Com-
merce, various Governors throughout 
the region, and the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky’s 
Division 
of 
Emergency 
Management. 
Rick is also credited with cham-
pioning the development of Kentucky’s 
‘‘Mesonet,’’ a network of over 70 auto-
mated weather monitoring stations, 
hosted by Western Kentucky Univer-
sity, that is a model for other States. 
It turns out that Rick is something 
of a celebrity among those who share 
his passion for the science and tech-
nology of predicting and preparing for 
the very dynamic weather conditions 
of the Commonwealth. His fans, local 
leaders, and county emergency man-
agers will miss his regular updates and 
his steady, thorough engagement dur-
ing critical weather events. 
Most importantly, it would be dif-
ficult to calculate the lives saved and 
property losses mitigated by the work 
that Rick has performed during his ca-
reer. I am proud to recognize him for 
his considerable contribution to the 
safety of Kentuckians and to families 
throughout the region.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING THREE BOYS FARM 
DISTILLERY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Three Boys Farm Distillery in 
Graefenburg, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 2011, Ross and Heather Caldwell 
moved their family from Colorado to 
Kentucky, and quickly pursued their 
dream of opening a distillery. Before 
moving to Kentucky, Ross and Heather 
purchased a 122-acre farm providing 
them a space to open a distillery, and 
have remaining land to graze cattle 
and grow corn for use in their single 
barrel bourbon and whiskey. Like 
many small business owners, the jour-
ney to open their business was no easy 
task, as Ross and Heather navigated 
redtape and burdensome regulations 
before getting their business off the 
ground. After many hurdles, Three 
Boys Farm Distillery opened its doors 
in 2013, named in tribute to the 
Caldwells’ triplets: Patrick, Andrew, 
and Ethan. Over the years, family has 
remained the foundation of this small 
business with Ross serving as master 
distiller, but growth has led to hiring 
nine additional employees, including 
another master distiller. 
Today, Three Boys Farm Distillery is 
renowned for its bourbon and rye whis-
key. Their products are sold through-
out the United States and have drawn 
praise 
nationwide. 
The 
distillery’s 
bourbon and whiskey tastings are a hit 
among Kentuckians and tour groups 
alike, drawing visitors from around the 
United States and abroad. Uniquely, 
Three Boys Farm Distillery allows 
guests to sample and bottle their own 
whiskey and bourbon straight from the 
barrel. Over the years, Three Boys 
Farm Distillery has also become a pop-
ular event venue for weddings and fam-
ily reunions. Additionally, the dis-
tillery supports other local artisans 
and small businesses by selling their 
goods at the distillery’s on-site gift 
shop. 
Like many small businesses, Three 
Boys Farm Distillery was faced with 
challenges caused by the coronavirus 
pandemic but overcame them by adapt-
ing their business model throughout 
the ever-changing government regula-
tions. The distillery expanded their 
shipping operations to provide long- 
time consumers access to their prod-
ucts and relied on the recommenda-
tions from their loyal customers to 
grow their customer base when dis-
tillery tours and tastings were prohib-
ited. Furthermore, Three Boys Farm

Distillery expanded its bottling oper-
ations to assist outside companies bot-
tle and label their products for sale. 
While expanding the distillery’s oper-
ations helped Three Boys Farm Dis-
tillery stay afloat during the pan-
demic, 
longtime 
friend 
of 
the 
Caldwells, Walter Zausch, a University 
of Kentucky alum, provided additional 
assistance by investing in the business 
and becoming a majority owner. Re-
bounding from the pandemic, this sum-
mer, Three Boys Farm Distillery began 
hosting live concerts featuring local 
artists and continues to provide Ken-
tuckians with a place to relax, build 
community, and enjoy a glass of bour-
bon with friends. 
Three Boys Farm Distillery is a re-
markable example of the resilience and 
adaptability of locally owned small 
businesses. 
Small 
businesses, 
like 
Three Boys Farm Distillery, form the 
heart of towns across Kentucky and 
play a critical role in Kentucky’s bour-
bon and whiskey industry. Congratula-
tions to Ross, Heather, Walter, and the 
entire team at Three Boys Farm Dis-
tillery. I wish them the best of luck, 
and I look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, 
Ms. 
KLO-
BUCHAR, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, 
Mr. 
CARPER, 
Ms. 
HIRONO, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. WHITE-
HOUSE, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. WARNER, Mr. OSSOFF, 
and Mr. BENNET): 
S. 2532. A bill to provide protections 
for employees of, former employees of, 
and applicants for employment with 
Federal 
agencies, 
contractors, 
and 
grantees whose right to petition or fur-
nish information to Congress is inter-
fered with or denied; to the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN: 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am reintroducing legislation to 
strengthen 
protections 
for 
federal 
whistleblowers who share valuable in-
formation with Congress. 
In the last four years, we have seen a 
major erosion of accountability in Gov-
ernment. From the firing of multiple 
inspectors general to the willful mis-
interpretation of whistleblower protec-
tion laws, it has become more difficult 
than ever to keep the Executive branch 
honest. 
Despite these chilling developments, 
many whistleblowers still come for-
ward to ensure Congress could hold the 
powerful accountable. For example, in 
the 116th Congress, Lt. Colonel Alex-
ander Vindman, a senior official at the 
National Security Council, shared cred-
ible information with Congress that 
the President of the United States 
tried to entice the Ukrainian President 
to launch a sham investigation into 
then-candidate Biden. Vindman’s ac-
tions directly led to Donald Trump’s 
first impeachment trial, a watershed 
moment for our democracy. 
Whistleblowers like Vindman should 
be protected from retaliation. Unfortu-
nately, while current law specifies that 
the right to report to Congress must 
not to be interfered with or denied, it 
fails to provide a remedy in the event 
this happens. As a result, whistle-
blowers have no meaningful protection 
from retaliation. 
My bill would solve this problem by 
expanding administrative remedies to 
all taxpayer-funded employees, includ-
ing intelligence employees, whose right 
to report to Congress has been inter-
fered with or denied. It also gives Fed-
eral employees the right to file a law-
suit after exhausting administrative 
remedies, for which they can seek a 
wide range of relief, including lost 
wages 
and 
reinstatement 
to 
their 
former positions. 
Whistleblowers are critical to the 
proper 
functioning 
of 
government. 
They enable Congress to conduct over-
sight, root out waste, fraud, and abuse, 
and hold accountable those who violate 
the public trust. It is incumbent on us, 
as members of Congress, to ensure 
whistle blowers can report to us with-
out fearing retribution. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. I also ask unanimous consent that 
a copy of the bill be included in the 
RECORD. 
S. 2532 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Congres-
sional Whistleblower Protection Act of 2021’’.

EES.—A covered individual with respect to a 
covered intelligence community element (as 
defined in section 1104(a) of the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3234(a))) who is

subparagraph or a contractor, subcontractor, 
grantee, subgrantee, or personal services 
contractor (as those terms are used in sec-
tion 2409 of title 10 and section 4712 of title

the covered individual seeks corrective ac-
tion under the applicable subparagraph and 
there is no showing that the delay is due to 
the bad faith of the covered individual, the

law or equity for de novo review in the ap-
propriate district court of the United States, 
which shall have jurisdiction over the action 
without regard to the amount in con-

2409 of title 10 and section 4712 of title 41) of 
the agency; and 
‘‘(2) the term ‘Federal agency’ means an 
agency, office, or other establishment in the 
executive, legislative, or judicial branch of 
the Federal Government.’’. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 2537. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a cred-
it for previously-owned qualified plug- 
in electric drive motor vehicles; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Affordable 
EVs for Working Families Act of 2021.’’ 
This bill is an important measure 
that will ensure more widespread, equi-
table adoption of electric vehicles by 
creating a tax credit for buyers of pre- 
owned electric vehicles, similar to the 
tax credit that exists for purchasers of 
new electric vehicles. 
Starting now, and over the next sev-
eral decades, the United States must 
take swift, decisive action to reduce 
our carbon emissions—especially from 
the transportation sector, which makes 
up one-third of all U.S. carbon emis-
sions. 
I am proud to say that California has 
led the way in the adoption of low- and 
zero-emission vehicles for several dec-
ades by incentivizing the development 
and purchase of electric and hybrid 
electric vehicles, and setting high fuel 
economy standards that 13 States have 
opted to follow. 
According to research released just 
last month by the Pew Research Cen-
ter, California has by far the highest 
share of electric vehicles of any State 
in the Nation—on average, 12 electric 
vehicles registered per 1,000 people. 
As a result, California now has the 
largest pre-owned electric vehicle mar-
ket in the nation. Sales for pre-owned 
electric vehicles in California have 
grown significantly in recent years. 
However, a study released just last 
month by Energy Innovation found 
that for lower-income households, the 
up-front costs of purchasing an electric 
vehicle presents an especially large 
hurdle, despite the long-term cost sav-
ings that they offer, such as on gas and 
maintenance. 
Transportation is the second-largest 
expense for all U.S. households, but 
presents a particular burden for lower- 
income households—suggesting that in-
centives for pre-owned buyers targeted 
toward lower and middle-income com-
munities can increase adoption of elec-
tric vehicles in those communities sig-
nificantly, and further accelerate over-
all adoption. 
We cannot miss an opportunity to en-
sure that as we electrify our transpor-
tation sector, electric vehicles become 
an option for all families—not just 
those who can afford new ones. 
My bill would do just that. 
My bill would provide a $2,500 tax 
credit to purchasers of preowned elec-
tric vehicles, similar to the credit al-
ready offered to purchasers of new elec-
tric vehicles. The credit only applies to 
vehicles that cost $25,000 or less, and 
would be phased down for buyers whose 
adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 
per year for individuals and $150,000 for 
joint filers. 
My bill also includes critical safe-
guards such as a vehicle identification 
number reporting requirements and a 
2-year previous ownership requirement 
to ensure that any attempted fraud is 
quickly caught. 
I would like to thank Congressmen 
JIMMY GOMEZ who is introducing the 
House companion to this bill, and has 
carried this effort in the House, along 
with Congressman MIKE THOMPSON who 
included a similar provision in the 
House clean energy tax incentives 
package, the GREEN Act. 
I would also like to thank the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, California Air Resources Board, 
our utilities and other California local-
ities that have led the way on this pol-
icy by offering their own rebates for 
pre-owned electric vehicles. 
Now, with the Senate considering 
historic investments in electric vehi-
cles and charging infrastructure, it is 
time for the federal government to fol-
low California’s lead and ensure that 
buyers of pre-owned vehicles receive a 
tax credit similar to the one for buyers 
of new EVs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield 
the floor. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Mrs. MURRAY, and 
Mr. DURBIN): 
S. 2553. A bill to amend title 28, 
United States Code, to protect employ-
ees of the Federal judiciary from dis-
crimination, and for other purposes; to

countability Act of 2021. I thank Rep-

TORRES, and MACE, along with my co-

RAY, and DURBIN, for working with me 
to finally ensure that employees of the 
Federal judiciary have strong statu-
tory rights and protections against dis-
crimination, sexual harassment, retal-
iation, and other forms of workplace 
misconduct. 
More than 30,000 people work in the 
Federal judiciary. As with any organi-
zation of this size, the judiciary is not 
immune from workplace misconduct. 
Over the years, however, a variety of 
factors have worked together to pre-
vent 
instances 
of 
workplace 
mis-
conduct within the judiciary from com-
ing to light. There is a unique power 
imbalance between the Federal judges 
who sit atop this vast organization and 
the clerks, staffers, and other employ-
ees who rely on connections and rec-
ommendations to advance their ca-
reers. The cloak of confidentiality en-
sures what happens in chambers stays 
in chambers. And, perhaps most impor-
tant, there is a lack of legal recourse 
available to judicial employees who are 
denied even the most fundamental 
workplace protections. Indeed, the Fed-
eral judiciary is one of the few employ-
ers—private or public—whose employ-
ees are not protected by state or fed-
eral civil rights laws. 
Despite all these reasons to keep 
quiet, a number of victims have brave-
ly come forward to report serious har-
assment by Federal judges over the 
past several years. In December 2017, 
six former law clerks and staffers ac-
cused 
Ninth 
Circuit 
Judge 
Alex 
Kozinski of subjecting them to a range 
of inappropriate sexual conduct and 
comments. In September 2019, the 
Tenth Circuit Judicial Council issued 
an order finding that District Court 
Judge Carlos Murguia had harassed 
multiple employees over a period of 
years, including by subjecting them to 
sexually suggestive comments; inap-
propriate text messages; and excessive, 
non-work-related contact. In February 
2020, a former law clerk to the late- 
Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt 
accused the judge of a months-long 
harassment campaign. 
In the face of this egregious mis-
conduct and Congressional pressure, 
the federal judiciary has taken only 
small, limited steps to protect its em-
ployees. It is not enough. 
The Judiciary Accountability Act 
fills the void left by the judiciary’s in-
action and extends to judicial branch 
employees the same anti-discrimina-
tion rights and remedies other govern-
ment sector employees and private sec-
tor workers have had for decades. It 
also goes further. Among other things, 
it would create an Office of Judicial In-
tegrity to administer a nationwide, 
confidential reporting system; estab-
lish a Special Counsel for Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity empowered to 
investigate all workplace misconduct 
complaints; form an Office of Employee 
Advocacy to assist in judicial branch 
employees in matters relating to work-
place discrimination and harassment; 
protect whistleblowers by prohibiting 
retaliation; and establish a comprehen-
sive workplace misconduct prevention 
program. 
These reforms are not only nec-
essary, they are long overdue. I there-
fore encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the Judiciary Accountability Act.

July 29, 2021 
Whereas, in 1936, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation declar-
ing Gold Star Mother’s Day, a national ob-
servance honoring the mothers of fallen serv-
ice members annually on the last Sunday of 
September; 
Whereas, since 2010, the Senate has hon-
ored Gold Star Spouses by resolution annu-
ally on April 5, recognizing the unique sac-
rifices made by spouses of fallen service 
members; 
Whereas thousands of sons and daughters 
of military families have lost mothers or fa-
thers who served in the Armed Forces and 
also deserve national recognition for the bur-
den and legacy they carry; and 
Whereas no date has existed to specifically 
recognize the children of fallen service mem-
bers of the United States as part of a na-
tional debt of gratitude that the people of 
the United States owe to the service mem-
bers who sacrificed all in protecting the free-
dom of the United States and the people of 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 1, 2021, as ‘‘Gold Star 
Children’s Day’’; 
(2) honors the sacrifices and hardships of 
the children of fallen service members; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Gold Star Children’s Day 
in support of children of the fallen men and 
women of the Armed Forces of the United 
States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 331—DESIG-
NATING AUGUST 11, 2021, AS ‘‘HIP 
HOP CELEBRATION DAY’’, DESIG-
NATING AUGUST 2021 AS ‘‘HIP 
HOP RECOGNITION MONTH’’, AND 
DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2021 AS 
‘‘HIP HOP HISTORY MONTH’’ 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. CAS-
SIDY, and Mr. PADILLA) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 331 
Whereas, on August 11, 1973, at a ‘‘Back To 
School Jam’’ organized by his sister Cindy 
Campbell and held at the recreation room of 
1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx, New 
York, Clive ‘‘DJ Kool Herc’’ Campbell intro-
duced his innovative style of disk jockeying 
and, together with the master of ceremonies 
engaging the crowd with rap on the micro-
phone while partygoers known as B-boys and 
B-girls danced, introduced a new style, later 
known as ‘‘Hip Hop’’, which combined the 
elements of a disk jockey (commonly known 
as a ‘‘DJ’’), a master of ceremonies (com-
monly known as an ‘‘MC’’), music, art, fash-
ion, and dance; 
Whereas, from its humble beginnings in 
New York City, the music, lyricism, dance, 
fashion, and art of Hip Hop has become a cul-
ture, now found in communities across the 
United States, and has long been a worldwide 
phenomenon; 
Whereas the art and culture of Hip Hop is 
an original American creation; 
Whereas Hip Hop and other genres of 
music, such as jazz from New Orleans, Lou-
isiana, blues from Mississippi, country from 
the South, and gospel, soul, rock and roll, 
and indigenous music from across the United 
States, have all transcended boundaries; 
Whereas the Hip Hop genre has been re-
invented often over the years since 1973, re-
flecting the State, city, and region of the 
music, from G-funk and Hyphy on the West 
Coast, to Bass and Trap in the South, to 
Drill in the Midwest, to many other sounds 
from coast to coast and from abroad, includ-
ing the New School, which continues that 
trend; 
Whereas Hip Hop artists and supporters, 
originally of African heritage, now transcend 
many different ages, ethnicities, religions, 
locations, political affiliations, and socio-
economic statuses, which demonstrates the 
melting-pot quality of Hip Hop art and cul-
ture; 
Whereas the art and culture of Hip Hop 
have been adapted in many innovative forms 
that are inspirational, challenging, humor-
ous, thought-provoking, and spiritual; 
Whereas Hip Hop has provided opportuni-
ties for extracurricular activities, youth 
counseling, creative outlets, physical fitness, 
vocabulary 
exercises, 
poetry, 
analytical 
thinking, entertainment, employment, and 
economic impact, and has become an indus-
try that generates more than a billion dol-
lars annually; 
Whereas Hip Hop art, education, and cul-
ture have positive effects on society; 
Whereas, on August 11, 2021, the Federal 
Government, States, cities, and towns will 
observe Hip Hop Celebration Day; 
Whereas, during the month of August 2021, 
the Federal Government, States, cities, and 
towns will observe Hip Hop Recognition 
Month; and 
Whereas, during the month of November 
2021, the Federal Government, States, cities, 
and towns will observe Hip Hop History 
Month: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 11, 2021, as ‘‘Hip Hop 
Celebration Day’’; 
(2) designates the month of August 2021 as 
‘‘Hip Hop Recognition Month’’; 
(3) designates the month of November 2021 
as ‘‘Hip Hop History Month’’; 
(4) recognizes the contributions of Hip Hop 
to art and culture; 
(5) encourages Senators to plan appro-
priate activities that support the objective 
of the ‘‘Back to School Jam’’ of August 11, 
1973; and 
(6) encourages local governments in the 
United States to build partnerships with 
local Hip Hop entities and other members of 
the creative arts and music communities.

SPEECH OF 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I want to 
commend Chair DELAURO and Chair PINGREE 
for their work on this bill and the significant 
progress it makes in addressing so many 
issues that have impacted tribes across the 
nation, including Arizona. 
This is by far the most funding provided to 
tribal nations in the history of our country, and 
I appreciate your commitment to consulting 
with tribal governments as this bill was drafted 
The bill before us includes funding for staff-
ing newly opened health facilities. Very near 
my district, the River People’s Health Center, 
located on the Salt River Pima Maricopa In-
dian Community Reservation, is one of these 
new facilities. 
I am grateful it would fully fund the Indian 
Health Service’s (IHS) request for staff at the 
River People Health Center, and that lan-
guage is included to ensure the facility will re-
ceive staffing funding should the opening date 
come earlier than IHS currently projects. 
However, I also understand that the Com-
munity has raised concerns with the IHS that 
the funding request does not include 11 posi-
tions that are in the original authorized staffing 
plan for the Health Center. 
Unfortunately, while the Community sent a 
letter more than two months ago requesting 
clarification and justification for this discrep-
ancy, they have yet to receive a response. 
While this issue is being worked out be-
tween the Community and IHS, I would ask 
that the Committee continue to work with me 
to ensure the final bill will fully fund the author-
ized staffing levels and 638 contracts for the 
newly-opened facilities, as agreed to in the 
final contract between the tribe and the federal 
government. 
Chairwoman Chellie Pingree: 
I want to thank the gentleman from Ari-
zona for raising this concern and for his con-
sistent support for strong funding for Tribal 
Nations. I am proud to say that our sub-
committee has strongly supported Tribal pri-
orities and programs, because we know that 
these accounts are still far underfunded and 
oversubscribed. 
I also want to thank him for his support of 
the Indian Health Services’ River People’s 
Health Center on the Salt River Reservation. 
I am very pleased that this bill provides the 
funding necessary to open this new facility 
and others across the nation. With the pan-
demic still raging in many parts of the Coun-
try, it is essential that we get these facilities 
up and running as soon as possible. 
Staffing for new facilities is an issue we 
closely monitor. We look forward to updates 
on negotiations between the Salt River Pima 
Maricopa Indian Community and IHS and 
will work with our colleagues in the Senate 
as the situation evolves. 
I thank Madam Chair for her support. I look 
forward to working with her and supporting the 
wellbeing of our Tribal communities.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ASHLEE 
WARD ON HER INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
native 
Ashlee 
Ward. Ashlee will be inducted into the Luzerne 
County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 for her 
distinct athletic achievements in the sport of 
track and field. She and her fellow inductees 
will be honored at a reception on August 8, 
2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
At Meyers High School, Ashlee was a star 
member of the track and field team. She held 
the records in high jump and discus. At the 
PIAA District 2 Championship in 2007, she 
was the high jump champion and placed 
fourth in discus. She went on to take eighth 
place in high jump at the PIAA State Cham-
pionship. The following year, Ashlee again 
came out on top to take first place in high 
jump at the District 2 Championship, as well 
as second place in discus. She was sixth in 
the state for the high jump. In 2009, she 
placed second in high jump and third in discus 
at the District Championships and ninth in the 
state for high jump. Her senior year, she was 
crowned the District 2 Champion in both dis-
cus and high jump, and she was second in the 
state for high jump and fourth in discus. 
While at Misericordia University, she held 
the school records in high jump and discus as 
well as the Middle Atlantic Conference indoor 
and outdoor high jump records. Her freshman 
year, at the MAC Indoor Championships, she 
was runner-up in high jump, and at the MAC 
Outdoor Championship, she was named Field 
Athlete of the Year and Champion in high 
jump and discus. At the NCAA Outdoor quali-
fier, she was 12th in high jump; at the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference Indoor Champion-
ship, she placed sixth in the high jump; and at 
the Outdoor Championship, she earned AII- 
ECAC outdoor honors after placing fifth in the 
high jump, as well as 11th in discus. 
Her sophomore year, she was named the 
MAC Outdoor Champion in high jump and dis-
cus as well as the MAC Indoor Runner Up in 
high jump. She also participated in the Indoor 
and Outdoor ECAC Championships and the 
NCAA District Ill Outdoor Championships. As 
a junior, she continued to dominate the MAC 
as the Indoor Champion in high jump and the 
Outdoor Champion in high jump and discus. 
She also placed in the top five at both the in-
door and outdoor ECAC Championships in 
high jump. 
Ashlee had an incredibly successful senior 
season. She was the MAC Indoor High Jump 
Champion as well as the MAC Outdoor High 
Jump Champion and runner up in discus. She 
went on to compete at the ECAC Outdoor 
Championships, winning the gold in high jump 
and placing seventh in discus. She triumphed 
at the NCAA Division III Indoor and Outdoor 
Championships, placing first in high jump at 
both contests. For her efforts, she was named 
the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field 
Women’s Athlete of the Year for the Mideast 
Region. 
It is an honor to recognize Ashlee on her in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May her story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

IN HONOR OF GARY’S BAR-B-CUE 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the time-tested excellence of Gary’s 
Bar-B-Cue, a local favorite and culinary staple 
of the town of China Grove. 
The North Carolina barbecue place, owned 
and operated by Gary Ritchie, celebrated 50 
years of business on April 21, 2021. The res-
taurant’s popularity and longevity can largely 
be attributed to Gary’s principled commitment 
to ‘‘Good food, good service, and a clean res-
taurant,’’ Gary’s Bar-B-Cue epitomizes the 
core American values of hard work, deter-
mination, and generosity that fuel small busi-
ness success and turn paying customers into 
lifelong friends. 
Like many business owners, Gary Ritchie’s 
start in the barbecue business began before 
he opened his own shop. After six years of 
working in curb service at Johnson’s Bar-
becue, Gary converted a former Gulf Oil serv-
ice station into his own restaurant, eventually 
expanding the venue’s capacity three times. 
Gary’s Bar-B-Cue now accommodates up to 
216 diners. The building’s seating expansion 
testifies not only to business success, but to 
Gary’s aim to make everyone feel at home in 
his restaurant. 
Gary’s is a family business—but not just be-
cause Gary and Sylvia Ritchie married the

year before they opened the restaurant. While 
the Ritchies have worked together throughout 
their restaurant’s tenure, Gary and his staff 
make a point of treating every customer like 
kin, and many customers keep coming back 
because of the friendly service. Some might 
even say that Gary’s barbecue dip is the only 
sauce around that runs thicker than blood. 
For Gary, his family, and staff, the business 
was never merely about turning a profit. Over 
the decades, Gary’s has become much more 
than just a restaurant serving up delicious 
southern food and barbecue. The China Grove 
establishment regularly hosts community orga-
nizations and groups that come for a good 
meal—yes—but foremost to belong Through it 
all, Gary seems to have had his sights set on 
something loftier than pulled pork-namely, 
making every diner in his restaurant feel 
known and respected, regardless of where 
they come from, the clothes on their back, or 
even their political affiliation. 
In a culture of heightened fear, animosity, 
and division, perhaps we could learn a thing 
or two from the slow-cooked wisdom of Gary 
Ritchie: ‘‘The easiest thing in the world is to 
be nice to people. It don’t cost you nothing.’’ 
Please join me in celebrating the enduring 
success of Gary Ritchie and Gary’s Bar-B- 
Cue.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
UNION 
MEDICAL 
CENTER 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 
Union Medical Center in Union, South Caro-
lina. 
Founded as the Wallace Thomas Hospital in 
1921, Union Medical Center is a 143-bed 
acute care hospital that has provided critical 
medical services to the citizens of Union 
County throughout the last century. Residents 
are undoubtedly safer as a result of the high 
quality care provided here. 
Union Medical Center has stood the test of 
time and has consistently risen above and be-
yond public health challenges to meet the 
needs of its community. In 2015, under the 
leadership of President Paul Newhouse, Union 
Medical Center overcame financial distress 
and 
joined 
the 
Spartanburg 
Regional 
Healthcare System, providing patients with 
greater access to enhanced services, multi-
specialty physicians, and more advanced tech-
nologies. 
More recently, through the Healthy Out-
comes Program, Union Medical Center has 
worked to meet the needs of uninsured pa-
tients and help them purchase lifesaving medi-
cations and supplies such as insulin and 
glucometers. Union Medical Center has also 
implemented a telestroke program to provide 
quick, high level stroke care for patients. The 
hospital’s commitment to excellence in treating 
patients with symptoms of a stroke resulted in 
the earning of Acute Stroke Ready certification 
from Det Norske Veritas, an international cer-
tifier. 
Doctors, nurses, and other employees at 
Union Medical Center have worked tirelessly 
through the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic to 
save countless lives throughout the rural coun-
ty. I commend these healthcare workers for 
their selfless and brave sacrifices. These he-
roes deserve our deepest gratitude. 
On behalf of the 5th Congressional District 
of South Carolina, I congratulate Union Med-
ical Center on 100 years of outstanding serv-
ice. I am grateful for their ongoing investments 
in the future of healthcare in Union County, 
and I look forward to a new century of contin-
ued medical excellence.

INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
Northeastern Pennsylvania native Jacqueline 
Hardwick. Jacqueline will be inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 
for her distinct athletic achievements in the 
sport of basketball. She and her fellow induct-
ees will be honored at a reception on August 
8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
While at Dallas High School, Jacqueline ex-
celled on the basketball team. Her sophomore 
year, she was selected as a Division II All- 
Star, and her team won the Wyoming Valley 
Conference Sportsmanship Award while also 
being named the WVC Division II Champions 
for the first time since 1985. Her junior year, 
she was named WVC Division II Player of the 
Year, and the team won the District II Class 
3A Championship. As a senior, she reached a 
high school career total of 1,134 points and 
was named WVC Division II Times Leader All- 
Star. That same year, her team won the WVC 
Division II Championship. Jacqueline was also 
a key player on the soccer team; she was 
named a WVC Division D All-Star her fresh-
man and sophomore years and a WVC District 
A All-Star her junior year. She helped lead the 
team to a Division D Championship her fresh-
man year and to District 2 Playoffs her junior 
year. Her senior year, her team was crowned 
the District A Champions. 
Jacqueline continued her athletic career on 
the basketball court at Albright College. Her 
junior year, she was named Albright College’s 
Most Outstanding Women’s Basketball Player. 
During her collegiate career, she scored 1,016 
points, and she helped the team make its first 
Division II NCAA tournament appearance in 
school history. In 2008, Jacqueline was recog-
nized by Who’s Who in American Colleges 
and Universities. 
After graduating, she was hired at Kenwood 
High School with the Baltimore County Public 
Schools as a special education teacher, and 
she also coached the junior varsity girls’ bas-
ketball team. From 2009 to 2013, she played 
semi-professional basketball with the Balti-
more Starz in the Women’s Eastern Basketball 
Alliance. Even with the demands of a semi- 
professional carrier, she continued to coach at 
Kenwood High School, serving as the assist-
ant coach for the girls’ varsity basketball team 
from 2009 to 2013. From 2011 to 2014, she 
coached Allied Soccer, and in 2013, she was 
named head coach of Kenwood’s girls’ varsity 
basketball head coach, a position she held 
until 2015. 
It is an honor to recognize Jacqueline on 
her induction into the Luzerne County Sports 
Hall of Fame. May her story and athletic and 
coaching careers serve as an inspiration to 
the next generation of Pennsylvania athletes 
striving for excellence.

IN HONOR OF DUWAYNE AMEN 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the extraordinary career of duWayne 
Amen. 
duWayne is retiring from his position as Di-
rector of Facilities at Summit School in Win-
ston-Salem, North Carolina. duWayne started 
at Summit School in 1976 with an acute skill 
for all things mechanical. In the following 45 
years, duWayne became ingrained in nearly 
every aspect of Summit’s community and 
physical development, as he oversaw a num-
ber of expansion projects within the school. 
Madam Speaker, it is not often that the in-
fluence of an individual’s career is physically 
visible, but one walk through Summit School’s 
campus is a testament to duWayne’s hard 
work and dedication. Men like duWayne are 
hard to come by, and everyone who met him 
is better for it, myself included. 
When asked about the way he hopes to be 
remembered, duWayne responded: ‘‘That I 
was professional-minded, to the point of being 
a perfectionist. But I enjoyed a good laugh. I 
wanted always to make things better than I 
found them. And that I really care about peo-
ple, especially children.’’ This is exactly how I 
remember duWayne and his work during my 
years at Summit. 
You see, duWayne and I started about the 
same time, except he was graduating from 
Wake Forest University and I was starting kin-
dergarten. duWayne was my bus driver, and 
because we lived on a farm so far away, we 
really got to know each other on those long 
drives. A lot of my love for the woodshop, me-
chanical shop, and life in general, came from 
duWayne, and I’m very grateful for him.

HONORING 
JENNIFER 
CAR-
RUTHERS 
AS 
IOWAN 
OF 
THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jennifer Carruthers as Iowan of the 
Week. Jen is a female LGBTQ entrepreneur, 
strong advocate, dedicated mentor and pas-
sionate community leader for Iowa. 
Born and raised in Rock Island, IL, Jen 
studied at St. Ambrose University in Dav-
enport, IA receiving a Bachelor’s Degree in 
Business Management with a focus on Urban 
Economic Development. She then went on to 
make her home in Des Moines, spending the 
last decade advocating for marginalized com-
munities. Through her business 11 Eleven 
Productions, she was pivotal in launching and 
developing the female-led barber shop, Dap-
per DSM. Jen also founded Drag King DSM, 
which draws top performers and sell-out 
crowds in a marginalized art form. Over the 
last 10 years at Girls Rock! Des Moines, she 
has developed programming which now offers 
two summer camps and year-round services 
including the second all-female-led recording 
studio in the country. Her outstanding leader-
ship in Iowa has been deservedly recognized 
by multiple community organizations. 
Jen has been instrumental organizing and 
leading Capital City Pride (CCP), which has 
become the largest LGBTQ+ gathering in Iowa 
and one of the fastest growing Pride’s in the 
country. 
During her time leading Capital City Pride, 
the COVID–19 pandemic changed the way 
communities celebrate, but Jen knew the im-
portance of celebrating Pride together. In 
2020, she led the board in putting together 
some of their most beloved Pride Fest events 
virtually to ensure LGBTQ+ community-build-
ing continued. This programming engaged just 
shy 
of 
30,000 
people, providing critical 
connectivity during the height of the pandemic. 
This June, Jen led the Capital City Pride 
board through 30 Days of Pride remaining 
cognizant of COVID–19. Events held across 
Des Moines included a mix of online and in 
person events allowing people to participate to 
their comfort level. Some popular additions 
this year included a Downtown Scavenger 
Hunt, the Rainbow Safari at Blank Park Zoo, 
Ride in Movie night at the Science Center and 
a Drive Thru Parade with Outdoor Concert at 
Waterworks Park. Favorites from year’s past 
like the Silent Disco, Pet Parade and Pride 
Night with the I-Cubs brought people together

As June and 30 Days of Pride ended this

nity, and it is my honor to name Jennifer Car-

TRIBUTE TO NEIL ADKERSON 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a man who exemplified 
the hard-working, blue collar life that is the 
backbone of our Nation. On February 23, of 
this year, the Lord called Neil Adkerson to his 
heavenly home at the young age of forty-six; 
but, in those forty-six years, Neil achieved the 
most important aspects of the American 
dream. 
Coming from a childhood where love was 
plentiful, but means were scarce, Neil under-
stood early the values of family bonds, of a 
strong work ethic, and of self-reliance. He 
never sought fame, and always shied away 
from recognition. Anytime he helped a friend 
or neighbor, which was often, he always did it 
with a smile. Neil worked long hours to make 
a modest living, and never complained about 
his life. He lived within his means, so he could 
provide for his family. His focus was on pro-
viding a happy, loving upbringing for his three 
stepsons, to which he only ever referred to as 
his sons. They are, in his words, his greatest 
contribution to this world. 
Even in hard times, Neil always greeted 
people with a humble smile and a kind word. 
The one thing that that could raise his ire was 
someone disparaging the country that he 
loved dearly; and, even then, he would simply 
tell them why he believed America is the 
greatest country on earth, because it had 
given a poor boy from North Georgia so much 
freedom and opportunity. 
In short, Neil Adkerson was a good man 
who loved God, loved his family, and loved his 
country. That, Madam Speaker, is the very es-
sence of what it means to be an American.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
‘‘BOB’’ MOSES 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Mr. Robert Parris Moses. 
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Parris Moses was a civil rights 
leader, educational advocate, and pioneer in 
grassroots community organizing whose ef-
forts played a key role in helping Mississip-
pians gain basic rights. 
Moses, a New York native, was a field sec-
retary for SNCC in Mississippi during the 
1960s. He also served as co-director of the 
Council of Federated Organizations, which 
used community organizing as a tool to launch 
voter registration projects across the state. 
COFO served as an umbrella for an alliance 
between the SNC, the Congress of Racial 
Equality and the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and 
helped focus civil rights efforts in the state. 
COFO was known for its young organizers’ 
door-to-door canvassing, voter registration 
preparation and workshops, and actual reg-
istration attempts in Mississippi. 
In response to the state Democratic Party 
denying 
access 
to 
Black 
Mississippians, 
Moses, along with Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella 
Baker and others created the Mississippi Free-
dom Democratic Party. The effort created na-
tional attention at the 1964 National Demo-
cratic Convention as conflict developed over 
whether to recognize the integrated party or 
the traditional party. New party members ulti-
mately failed at being seated as voting mem-
bers of the 1964 convention, but their efforts 
brought new attention to the plight of African 
Americans in Mississippi and other Southern 
states and ultimately led to a revolution in the 
national Democratic Party on racial issues. 
In 2000, Moses was honored by both the 
Mississippi House and Senate, whose mem-
bers in past years had passed laws that he 
fought to overturn denying voting rights and 
other basic rights to African Americans. On 
July 25, 2021, Moses died at the tender age 
of 86. Bob Moses was quiet, meticulous, ef-
fective visionary, and leader. His contributions 
to the State of Mississippi should not be for-
gotten. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Robert Moses for his 
dedication to serving his community.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
PAUL 
LUPINSKI 
ON 
HIS 
INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
native 
Paul 
Lupinski. Paul will be inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 
for his distinct athletic and coaching achieve-
ments in the sports of soccer, basketball, golf, 
swimming, baseball, and football. He and his 
fellow inductees will be honored at a reception 
on August 8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
At Tunkhannock Area High School, Paul 
was a standout multi-sport athlete, earning let-
ters in soccer, golf, basketball, swimming, and 
baseball. He was named All-Conference in 
soccer, swimming, and baseball, and his sen-
ior year, he received All-State Honors in swim-
ming. In the pool, he set school records in the 
50 freestyle, 100 freestyle, and 200 freestyle 
relay, and he won three district gold medals, 
one in the 50 freestyle and two in the 100 
freestyle. In 1995, he went on to swim at the 
state championships, placing third in the 100 
free and fourth in the 50 free. That year he 
was named to the High School Academic All- 
American Team. He was named to the 1994 
and 1995 Times Leader Wyoming Valley Con-
ference Swimming All-Star Team, as well as 
the 1995 Wyoming Valley Conference Base-
ball All-Star Team. He was also a Dutch Keller 
and Procter and Gamble Scholarship recipient. 
At the end of Paul’s senior year in baseball, 
he suffered a stroke caused by endocarditis 
due to a defective aortic valve. However, he

swim for Penn State University that fall. He 
made an impressive recovery and went on to 
have a collegiate swimming career. He placed 
third in the 200 free relay at the 1997 Big Ten 
Conference Meet, and he was named Aca-
demic All-Big Ten athlete for the 1996–1997 
season. 
Paul’s heart condition was monitored as he 
swam for two seasons at Penn State, but 
there were still signs of leakage in his heart. 
Despite deciding to give up swimming, he 
went on to play fall baseball for Penn State, 
and, in the spring, he was the last person cut 
from the team. In 1999, Paul graduated with a 
degree in chemical engineering. 
While monitoring his heart condition after 
two open heart surgeries, Paul stays active 
and encourages young people to reach their 
full potential in sport. He has coached junior 
high baseball, age group swimming, rec 
league soccer, baseball, and basketball. He 
has served as the Tunkhannock Youth Soccer 
Commissioner and the Tunkhannock Youth 
Basketball Association Treasurer. He was on 
the board of the Wyoming County United Way 
and a trustee of the Center Moreland United 
Methodist Church. Paul shared his story of 
perseverance and overcoming adversity with 
the students of his alma mater as the keynote 
speaker of the Tunkhannock High School 
Honors Banquet. 
It is an honor to recognize Paul on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his unique story and athletic ca-
reer serve as an inspiration to future Pennsyl-
vania students striving for personal excellence.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE 
MARGIE RICE 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of the Honorable Margie 
Rice, long time Mayor and Council Member of 
the City of Westminster, California, who 
passed away on Sunday, July 25, 2021, at the 
age of 92. 
Mayor Rice served on the Westminster City 
Council for 22 years, including 12 years as the 
city’s elected mayor. 
Prior to that, Margie Rice served as a Trust-
ee on the Westminster School District for 17 
years. Up until her death, she served on the 
Board of Directors for the Midway City Sanita-
tion District for 30 years. 
In 2019, I was honored to join Margie and 
other board members in celebrating the 80th 
Anniversary of the Midway Sanitation District. 
Mayor Rice was an active community leader 
and a public servant. She was passionate, 
dedicated, focused, hardworking, and above 
all, outspoken. 
She was a force to be reckoned with—a 
force for good for the city and the community 
she cared deeply about. 
Margie Rice dedicated her life to advocating 
for the needs of the community and she 
achieved many results for the residents and 
businesses of Westminster. 
Among her legacy is the building of the 
Westminster Rose Center Theater, a 16,000– 
square-foot performing arts center for the 
whole community to enjoy. It was her brain-
child that is now one of the jewels of West-
minster. 
Margie was born in Alabama, but she called 
Westminster home for more than 60 years. 
She was married at 16 and had her first 
child at 17. Together with her husband, they 
moved to Santa Barbara, California before set-
tling in Westminster, just shortly before the 
city’s incorporation. 
Margie worked as a grapes picker before 
finding a good job with a fiberglass manufac-
turer. She was also a homemaker and an avid 
volunteer. 
She volunteered with her children’s school 
PTA, served as the president of the local Little 
League, and taught at Sunday School. 
Despite all the things she did and even dur-
ing her time serving on the City Council, she 
always made time for her children and her 
family. 
Margie Rice lived in her Westminster house 
for 64 years. She is survived by two of her 
four children, 19 grandchildren, 23 great 
grandchildren 
and 
12 
great-great 
grand-
children. 
Mayor Margie Rice was as a pioneer, a 
public servant, and a community leader who 
loved and cared for the Westminster commu-
nity with all her heart. 
The residents in Westminster along with 
many people and communities across the 47th 
Congressional District will remember Margie 
Rice. 
She will be dearly missed.

IN HONOR OF DOUG LEWIS 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the legacy of Douglas Roger Lewis, 
who passed away in Winston-Salem, NC on 
April 2nd, 2021. 
Doug Lewis spent his life empowering later 
generations to flourish as equipped leaders. 
Beginning his career in Buffalo, NY, where he 
was born, Doug took a position as a teacher 
at the Nichols School. He later taught in Pitts-
burgh, PA at Shady Side Academy before 
moving to North Carolina in 1957. 
Doug came to Winston-Salem to serve as 
the headmaster of the Summit School, a role 
he faithfully carried out for the next 33 years. 
Working tirelessly to build on the foundation of 
his predecessors, Summit School grew by 
leaps and bounds. Under Doug’s leadership, 
the school expanded by adding a junior high 
building and gymnasium in 1962, a science 
center and another gymnasium in 1977, a 
teaching and learning center in 1984, and a 
middle school building in 1986. 
For Doug, working as an educator was far 
more than a job or a career, it was his calling. 
This was no secret to the countless students 
and staff who knew Doug as a friend, mentor, 
and encourager. The same was true for 
Bingle, Doug’s wife, who also dedicated her 
life to education, working alongside her hus-
band at Summit as a French teacher. Of 
Doug, his successor Dr. Sandra Adams, re-
marked, ‘‘Mr. Lewis was above all a man of vi-
sion. He saw possibilities. And because he 
saw possibilities he was rarely satisfied.’’ 
It was this same visionary drive that pro-
pelled Doug’s work to fulfill his statement of 
Summit School’s mission, ‘‘Here we nourish all 
who come, especially children. We answer 
needs, enliven hopes, spur talents.’’ 
Our Nation is better today—and tomorrow 
will be brighter—because of people like Doug 
Lewis. As a student at Summit School, Doug 
was my principal, and I count myself a bene-
ficiary of his leadership. It would be impossible 
for me to forget his warm and generous spirit, 
extending not only to his beloved students, but 
even to wildlife. I will always treasure my 
memories of him with the squirrels and chip-
munks that he befriended, to the point that 
they even accompanied him on his walks 
around campus, sometimes riding the shoul-
ders of his tweed jackets. 
May we all live with gratitude for the life of 
Doug Lewis. Please join me in celebrating his 
memory and work.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EFFORTS 
OF 
SEVERAL CHURCHES IN MY DIS-
TRICT 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the efforts of several 
churches in my district that worked tirelessly to 
provide relief, support, and resources to their 
communities during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Churches provide essential support in our 
community during the pandemic, far beyond 
the call of duty. They hosted food banks for 
those in need, provided financial help to those 
struggling to make ends meet, and sought out 
opportunities to support the social, spiritual, 
and emotional needs of members. 
Our community is better because of them 
and I recognize the volunteers who sacrificed 
their time, energy, and own well-being to pro-
vide relief to those who needed a lifeline ex-
tended to them. In a time of fear, they built a 
network of hope. 
I thank the staff, volunteers, and members 
of Iglesia Amistad, Mosaic Church, Iglesia 
Palabra en Accio´n, Iglesia Ciudad de Dios, 
Confluence Ministries, Roca Fuerte, Iglesia 
Orchard, El renuevo, Northern Hills Church, 
the Colorado Multiethnic Coalition, and Re-
newal Christian Center. 
The impact of this outreach on our commu-
nity is profound. I commend all involved for 
their ongoing effort to ensure that no one gets 
left behind.

OF 
THE ANNISTON ARMY DEPOT 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
the retirement of Colonel Marvin Walker today 
as Commander of the Anniston Army Depot. 
Colonel Walker earned his undergraduate 
degree from Dillard University and his grad-
uate degrees from the U.S. War College and 
Webster University. He is also a graduate of 
the Command and General Staff College, the 
Joint Combined Warfighting School, and the 
United States Air War College. 
In 1996, Colonel Walker received his com-
mission in the Ordnance Corps. During his il-
lustrious career, Colonel Walker held leader-
ship posts around the world in defense of our 
Nation to include command at the company 
and battalion level. Colonel Walker repeatedly 
served our Nation in combat, deploying to Ku-
wait once, Iraq twice, and commanding the 3– 
401st Army Field Support Battalion in Afghani-
stan. 
He has received numerous awards and 
decorations in service to our Nation—including 
the Bronze Star Medal with two oak leaf clus-
ters, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal 
with two oak leaf clusters, and the Meritorious 
Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters—but 
no amount of awards could capture the valor, 
bravery, and commitment he has provided to 
our Nation, nor the incalculable debt we owe 
back to him. 
Colonel Walker has served honorably as the 
36th commander of the Anniston Army Depot 
since July 2019, where he has overseen an 
annual $850M operating revenue in support of 
Warfighter readiness and has led a workforce 
of 3,000 personnel. He has earned the respect 
and admiration of all those serving at the 
Depot and led with great fidelity to our Nation, 
It is a great privilege to call the Anniston Army 
Depot part of Alabama’s Third District, and a 
tremendous honor to have had Colonel Walker 
commanding the post. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Colonel Walker on his retirement 
and distinguished service to the Anniston 
Army Depot, the United States Army, and our 
Nation.

YOUTH, PEACE, AND SECURITY 
ACT INTRODUCTION 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the reintroduction of my bill, the 
Youth, Peace, and Security Act of 2021. 
Currently, youth make up the majority of the 
population in conflict-affected countries. How-
ever, youth remain under-represented in over-
seas conflict prevention, management, resolu-
tion, and post-conflict relief and recovery ef-
forts. Youth and youth-led groups have shown 
their ability to play critical roles in deescalating 
conflict, preventing cyclical violence, and im-
proving the effectiveness and sustainability of 
peace processes and agreements. 
The Youth, Peace and Security Act of 2021 
recognizes the importance of youth involve-
ment and leadership in peace-building and 
conflict-prevention activities. The bill makes it 
the policy of the United States to promote the 
inclusive and meaningful participation of youth 
in peace building and conflict prevention, man-
agement, and resolution, as well as post-con-
flict relief and recovery efforts. The bill directs 
the State Department and USAID to develop a 
strategy to implement these goals. The strat-
egy will prioritize providing training and tech-
nical assistance to youth; integrate youth con-
sultation in aid programs; facilitate a safe and 
inclusive environment for youth; and, include 
youth in assessments of U.S. peace and secu-
rity initiatives, among other priorities. 
The bill would also require the President to 
appoint a coordinator to implement this strat-
egy, currently held by USAID’s Senior Agency 
Advisor on Youth. The coordinator will lead 
the implementation of the Youth, Peace, and 
Security strategy; establish an advisory group 
made up of youth and civil society organiza-
tions to guide the implementation of the strat-
egy; and, oversee the awarding of grants and 
provision of technical assistance to youth-led, 
peace-building organizations and individuals. 
These grants are part of the newly established 
Youth, Peace, and Security Fund, which seeks 
to support organizations dedicated to peace 
building, conflict prevention, conflict manage-
ment, and conflict resolution. 
I am thrilled to be joined in leading this bill 
with my colleagues Congressman JOHN CUR-
TIS, Congressman DEAN PHILLIPS, and Con-
gressman BRIAN FITZPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this im-
portant piece of legislation.

winningest coach in PIAA District IV history 
and the second in Pennsylvania all-time his-
tory. He coached his wrestlers to eleven 
Northern Tier League Championships, fifteen 
PIAA District IV North Section Team Titles, 
four PIAA District IV Team Titles, and one 
Northeast Regional Title. 
Dedicated to helping young people reach 
their full potential in sport, William spent forty 
years, from 1978 to 2018, coaching the Black 
Knights baseball and football teams. As the 
head baseball coach, he lead the team to 549 
wins, and throughout his coaching career, the 
teams won eleven Northern Tier League Titles 
and one District IV title. 
It is an honor to recognize William on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and coaching career 
serve as an inspiration to the next generation 
of Pennsylvania athletes striving for excel-
lence.

IN RECOGNITION OF BOBBY CLUE 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the achievements of 
my good friend, Bobby Clue who is celebrating 
his 10th anniversary as Executive Director of 
the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of 
Commerce. 
Bobby returned to his hometown of Som-
erset, Kentucky ten years ago to take on the 
task of leading the local Chamber of Com-
merce, and he has served as one of the great-
est advocates for business development and 
support in southern Kentucky. His achieve-
ments in business management, government 
affairs, public relations and consulting in the 
public and private sectors have provided him 
with a great wealth of knowledge to better 
support members of the Chamber of Com-
merce and the entire community. I personally 
appreciate Bobby’s decision to return home to 
use his expertise and talents to promote a 
brighter, more prosperous future in the Lake 
Cumberland area with a thriving portfolio of 
successful local businesses. 
In addition to taking on the helm of the 
chamber, Bobby has also volunteered his time 
as a board member for several local civic and 
government organizations, including the Pu-
laski County Technology Center Steering 
Committee, the Young Professionals of East-
ern Kentucky and the Mill Springs Battlefield 
Association. Bobby also serves as an Ex-Offi-
cio Member of the Kentucky Chamber of Com-
merce, lending his voice for the Common-
wealth’s entire business community. 
More importantly, Bobby and his wife An-
drea are now raising their beautiful daughters, 
Chelsea and Shelby Jo in southern Kentucky. 
I can only hope that they someday follow their 
father’s footsteps to become leaders for the 
next generation in Pulaski County. 
On behalf of Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional 
District, I applaud Bobby Clue for dedicating 
these last ten years as a true champion for 
Main Street.

JOE HERRIN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joe Herrin of Lafayette, 
Colorado for his service to the City of Arvada 
and our community. 
On July 22, 2021, Herrin was involved in a 
serious accident at Jack B. Tomlinson Park 
when the mower he was operating overturned 
into Birdland Lake, pinning him underwater. 
Herrin was extricated from the water and put 
on advanced life support at Lutheran Medical 
Center. He passed away as a result of his in-
juries on July 28, 2021. 
Herrin joined the City of Arvada’s Park 
Maintenance division in May 2018 and was a 
dedicated member of the team and public 
servant. Known as ‘‘Joey’’ to many of his 
friends and family, Herrin studied Environ-
mental Studies at the University of Colorado 
Boulder. Herrin recently married his wife, Erin, 
and together they enjoyed the outdoors and 
could be found camping, hiking, and kayaking 
at various locations across the state. He will 
be remembered by his family and friends as 
adventurous and a music lover. 
Recognizing this difficult time for the Herrin 
family and the City of Arvada, I want to extend 
my deepest sympathies for the loss of Joe 
Herrin as well as my appreciation for his serv-
ice to the City of Arvada, its residents, and our 
community.

IN MEMORIAM OF SUSAN 
SCANLAN, ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance 
of Susan Scanlan, the longtime president of 
the Women’s Education and Research Insti-
tute (WREI) at the Women’s Congressional 
Policy Institute. Susan passed away peacefully 
on July 16, 2021. She is known for her stead-
fast commitment to women’s issues and her 
work in bringing exceptional women into pro-
fessional roles here in Washington. 
Susan was born in Philadelphia, where her 
father relocated while working during World 
War II. The family returned to Virginia in 1949 
where they settled in Alexandria, where she 
attended Linconia Elementary and then W.T. 
Woodson High School before pursuing her 
collegiate education. A Phi Beta Kappa grad-
uate of Sweet Briar College with a masters in 
modern languages from Tulane University, 
Susan began her career on Capitol Hill as leg-
islative director for Representative Charles 
Wilson (TX–02), authoring legislation that ad-
mitted women to United States Military Acad-
emies. 
Susan helped found the Congressional Cau-
cus for Women’s Issues in 1977 and made 
WREI into an effective policy arm addressing 
issues crucial to women. In 1980, Susan wrote 
a proposal that would change the lives of 
more than three hundred women: to establish 
the Congressional Fellowships on Women and 
Public Policy at WREI. Since her proposal, 
hundreds of extremely driven, intelligent, and 
service-minded women have been sent to 
multitudes of congressional offices. 
After she served as director of the caucus 
for five years, she pursued a new role as the 
Director of WREI’s Congressional Fellowships 
program. Over three-hundred women from all 
backgrounds of America have been nurtured 
by this program, which placed them in con-
gressional offices to pursue their passions for 
public service. After a brief hiatus to pursue 
other opportunities she returned to WREI as 
president in 2000. In recognition of her deep 
care 
for 
women 
and 
our 
nation’s 
servicemembers, she was named by President 
Clinton to the Advisory Committee on Employ-
ment and Training for Veterans at the Depart-
ment of Labor. Her dedication to her principles 
and values was on display even further in 
2003 by her receipt of the Women’s Leader-
ship Award from the International Women’s

Democracy Center, which was also co-award-
ed to then-United States Senator John Kerry. 
In November 2005, Susan was selected to be-
come chair of the National Council of Wom-
en’s organizations, a coalition consisting of 
over two-hundred progressive groups and rep-
resenting over eleven million American women 
and their interests. She was a frequent pres-
ence on national media, calling out those who 
placed discrimination and sexism over equality 
and fairness for all peoples. 
Without Susan’s forethought and leadership 
in establishing the Congressional Fellowships, 
the Congress may never have been graced by 
the presence of such brilliant young women. 
Particularly, Susan provided my office with 
seventeen fellows since I first came to Con-
gress, including Shvedova Nadezhda (1994– 
1995), Lisa Maatz (1997–1998), Megan Gor-
don Don (1998–1999), Megan Sullivan (1999– 
2000), Kimberly Mason (2001), Christi Corbett 
(2004), Karen Persis (2005), Anthea Watson 
Strong (2006), Bethany Sousa (2007), Allison 
Adams-Alwine (2009), Pamela O’Leary (2008), 
Elizabeth Darnall (2010), Julie Feeney (2011), 
Aimee Phelan (2015), Meenal Khajuria (2012), 
Nina Anand (2014), and Anna Le (2018). 
Many of the fellowship’s over three hundred 
alumnae have gone on to pursue fantastic and 
storied careers in academia, business, medi-
cine, law, nonprofit work, and continued public 
service through their state legislatures and the 
Congress. 
I will always remember Susan fondly for 
guiding our House and I to these extraordinary 
women, for her fierce advocacy throughout the 
years on the issues of particular importance to 
women, and her enduring commitment to her 
own principles and values—no matter the ob-
stacle. Though she is gone from our lives 
now, her legacy lives on in the people whose 
lives she graced with her presence. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Susan for every-
thing she gave me, Congress, and our Nation. 
May she rest well.

MORE FUNDING FOR CAREER 
EDUCATION 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduced two bills that give this House an op-
portunity to provide more funding for career 
education. 
My Job Corps Nationwide Act does this by 
allowing the establishment of Job Corps cen-
ters in all U.S. insular areas. Job Corps cen-
ters offer disadvantaged youth training in more 
than 70 career paths and participants can also 
work toward earning secondary school diplo-
mas or recognized postsecondary credentials. 
However, the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act only authorized these training 
sites in the 50 states, the District of Columbia 
and Puerto Rico. Allowing Job Corps centers 
in all U.S. insular areas would mean our 
young people would not have to leave to get 
the training they need, and local businesses 
would benefit from a skilled workforce con-
nected to our community and committed to re-
maining. 
My second bill, the Integrated English Lit-
eracy and Civics Education (IELCE) Nation-
wide Act, will help put people to work by pro-
viding support to increase their English pro-
ficiency. It is not unusual for my constituents 
to grow up in homes that speak one of the in-
digenous 
languages 
of 
the 
Marianas: 
Chamorro or Refaluwasch. By including all 
U.S. insular areas in the IELCE program, my 
bill will make grant funding available for pro-
grams that help English language learners ac-
quire the proficiency needed to obtain employ-
ment. 
By fixing these inequities in career edu-
cation funding for the U.S. insular areas, we 
can help all in our nation receive the training 
and education they need to enter and succeed 
in the workforce. 
The gentlelady from American Samoa, Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN, and the gentleman from Guam, 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS, are original cosponsors of 
the bills. 
I urge my colleagues to support both bipar-
tisan pieces of legislation.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LATE 
HAROLD 
EDWARD 
‘‘RED’’ 
GRANGE ON HIS INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete and North-
eastern Pennsylvania native, the late Harold 
Edward ‘‘Red’’ Grange. Harold will be inducted 
into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame 
for his distinct athletic achievements in the 
sport of football. He and his fellow inductees 
will be honored at a reception on August 8, 
2021. 
Each year the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
Harold was born on June 13, 1903 to Sarah 
‘‘Sadie’’ and John ‘‘Lyle’’ Grange in Forksville, 
Pennsylvania. After his wife passed away in 
1910 from typhoid fever, Lyle moved his family 
to Wheaton, Illinois to be closer to relatives. 
Eager to support his family, Harold began de-
livering blocks of ice to Wheaton-area homes 
after proving he could lift the 75-pound blocks 
of ice on his shoulders with ease. The stren-
uous job not only primed his body for the 
physical demands of football but also earned 
him the nickname, ‘‘Wheaton Iceman.’’ 
Harold had a standout high school football 
career, scoring 75 touchdowns. He continued 
his athletic career at the University of Illinois 
where he was known as the ‘‘Galloping 
Ghost’’ for his unparalleled agility and speed. 
On October 18, 1924, he helped lead the 
team to a national championship over Michi-
gan in a game where he scored four touch-
downs and covered 262 yards in the first 
twelve minutes. While at Illinois. he was an 
All-American three times and, in 1924, was 
the first recipient of the Silver Football Award 
as the Big Ten’s Most Valuable Player. He 
was named to the Sporting News All-Team, 
the Big Ten Diamond Anniversary Team, the 
Walter Camp All-Century Team, and the UI 
All-Century Team. In 1925, the University of Il-
linois retired his number, No. 77, the first of 
only two players to date to have that honor. 
At the last game of his impressive collegiate 
career, Harold signed a professional contract 
with the Chicago Bears. With his magnetic 
presence and athletic prowess on the field, 
crowds would flock to the stadium to watch 
him lead his team to championships. For his 
efforts, Harold is credited with sparking the 
new interest Americans began to show in foot-
ball and helping to legitimize and popularize 
the National Football League. He was in-
ducted into the College Football Hall of Fame 
as well as the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A 
historical marker on Route 154 near the inter-
section with Route 87 in Forksville, PA com-
memorates Harold’s storied football career. 
In 
1941, 
Harold 
married 
Margaret 
Hazelberg. He had a daughter with Helen 
Morrissey in 1928, Rosemary Morrisey, and 
he has a granddaughter Rose Batka. He died 
on January 28, 1991. 
It is an honor to recognize Harold on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

HONORING MAC WILLIAMS: LEAD-
ER IN ALAMANCE COUNTY ECO-
NOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Mac Williams’ retirement from his sto-
ried tenure as president of the Alamance 
County Chamber of Commerce and in com-
memoration of his great achievements on be-
half of the county’s economy. 
Departing with over 45 years of expertise in 
economic development, Mac’s service as 
President of the Chamber since 2004 has 
been critical to the addition of numerous busi-
nesses and their operations to Alamance 
County. From 2017 through 2020, Alamance 
County saw over $425,200,000 in capital in-
vestment and has added over 1,265 jobs 
under Mac’s supervision. While the numbers 
alone speak to Mac’s extraordinary ability to 
attract new employers to Alamance County, 
Mac’s accomplishments are even more im-
pressive when considering the history of the 
county. 
Long a fixture of North Carolina’s textile in-
dustry, Alamance County’s economy has ben-
efitted from its central location within the state. 
As the textile industry began to boom in the 
mid-19th century, the area naturally developed 
into a transportation hub, serving as a link be-
tween Greensboro and Raleigh due to its 
close proximity to the two neighboring cities. 
Though the textile industry is still strong in 
Alamance County, textiles no longer make up 
the same share of the area’s economy as they 
once did. Rather than allowing Alamance 
County’s economic opportunity to fade as 
much of the manufacturing process has been 
moved overseas, Mac Williams and the Cham-
ber of Commerce worked hard to ensure that 
the county adapted its unique geographic and 
historic advantages to preserve its strong eco-
nomic performance, pivoting to become a

hotspot not only for the manufacturing that re-
mained, but now also for logistics and distribu-
tion. 
Those who know Mac recognize him as a 
leader amongst his peers and it has even 
been said of him by Greensboro Chamber of 
Commerce 
President 
and 
CEO 
Brent 
Christenson that ‘‘Mac has long been the 
standard by which other chamber leaders and 
economic development professionals have 
been measured.’’ 
Please join me in thanking Mac Williams for 
his commitment to the economic wellbeing 
and continued prosperity of Alamance County. 
We wish him the best in his future endeavors. 
Today, Alamance County is ‘‘A Great Place to 
Be’’ in large part because of Mac’s contribu-
tions. 
[From the Triad Business Journal, Apr. 21, 
2021] 
MAC WILLIAMS TO RETIRE AS ALAMANCE 
CHAMBER PRESIDENT BY THE END OF OCTOBER 
The Triad is soon to lose as second veteran 
economic 
developer 
within 
a 
year 
as 
Alamance Chamber of Commerce President 
Mac Williams draws the curtain on a 45-year 
career, around the end of October. 
But like Loren Hill, who retired after 20 
years as president of the High Point Eco-
nomic Development Corp. at the beginning 
of the year, retirement doesn’t mean he is 
going away. 
Williams, who joined the Alamance Cham-
ber in 2004, told the Alamance News he will 
be seeking other opportunities in the eco-
nomic development community. He may not 
have to look far. 
‘‘Mac has another career in either con-
sulting or site selection,’’ Bob Lewis, share-
holder and broker at NAI Piedmont Triad, 
told Triad Business Journal. ‘‘I’d hire him to 
come work with our company. He would be a 
dynamite addition to our site selection 
group.’’ 
Hill wasn’t on the job market long. Within 
a month after leaving his prior post, he was 
named economic development director of the 
Piedmont Triad Partnership. 
Lewis said Williams ‘‘had a great run’’ in 
his time in Alamance County. He played a 
key role in the recruitment of companies to 
both North Carolina Industrial Center and 
North Carolina Commerce Park. He helped 
lead the transformation of the county’s 
former textiles-based economy into one fo-
cused on logistics and distribution, maxi-
mizing the county’s proximity to major met-
ropolitan areas and efficient interstate ac-
cess. 
Under Williams’ watch, Alamance County 
brought in food distribution centers for 
Walmart and grocery chain Lidl; food manu-
facturing 
and 
distribution 
facilities 
for 
Sheetz and Lotus Bakeries; and had manu-
facturing wins such as Honda Power Equip-
ment expansions and Honda Aero, which 
builds HondaJet engines for Honda Aircraft 
Co. 
Most recently, he helped secure a new dis-
tribution hub for United Parcel Service and 
a distribution center for Chick-fil-A. 
‘‘Mac has long been the standard by which 
other chamber leaders and economic devel-
opment professionals have been measured,’’ 
said 
Greensboro 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce 
President and CEO Brent Christensen. ‘‘He 
leaves a lasting legacy of creating jobs for 
the Alamance County community and being 
a great advocate for this region. I know that 
his counterparts in the region and state will 
miss him, but hopefully we will be able to 
call on him for advice from time to time.’’ 
Added Brian Hall, director of development 
of Samet Corp., one of Alamance County’s 
more active commercial construction con-
tractors, ‘‘Mac leaves a legacy of working in 
partnership with both public and private 
partners, to secure economic growth, driving 
investment in the county and helping to cre-
ate a brighter future for Alamance County.’’ 
Not just ‘‘elephant hunting,’’ Lewis, who 
has known Williams since the early 1980s, 
said Williams understands the value of re-
cruiting multiple smaller companies that 
collectively provide similar impact to a sin-
gle large one. Economic development re-
quires leadership that effectively educates 
elected officials and the community on the 
value what is a public/private venture. 
‘‘We talk frequently and keep each other 
informed about various aspects of the mar-
ket, and he has done just a stellar job for 
Alamance County,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘He is highly 
respected in the economic development com-
munity. 
He’s forgotten more about economic devel-
opment than most people will ever know.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF CYRIL L. 
LEUELLING 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Cyril L. Leuelling 
of Morton, Illinois, who passed away on May 
19, 2021, at the age of 98. 
Cyril Leuelling, born on June 26, 1922, in 
Dawson, Illinois, and graduated from Ball 
Township High School in 1941. In 1942, he 
was called to serve his nation and was drafted 
for World War II. After his training, Cyril was 
deployed to England to serve with the 359th 
Regiment, 90th Infantry Division. 
Cyril achieved the rank of Technical Ser-
geant and was responsible for the lives of 40 
soldiers. In addition to serving in D-Day and 
the Battle of the Bulge, Cyril and his men con-
tributed to the operation which led to the lib-
eration of the Flossenburg concentration camp 
in Germany. On September 28, 1944, in Metz, 
France, he was awarded the Bronze Star 
Medal for saving a fellow soldier’s life and 
then awarded the Purple Heart for wounds he 
sustained in combat. He returned home to 
central Illinois after 19 months at war. 
Cyril was featured in a World War II Exhibit 
at the Museum of World Treasures in Wichita, 
KS. He attended and was interviewed for the 
Veteran’s History Project at the dedication of 
the World War II Memorial in Washington,D.C. 
Cyril is also in the June 2002 issue of National 
Geographic ‘‘The Untold Stories of D-Day’’. He 
was a long-time member of the American Le-
gion. 
Cyril lived a life of full accomplishments, but 
most importantly, he will be remembered for 
his love and commitment to his wonderful fam-
ily. On April 21, 1947, Cyril married Abigail 
‘‘Abbie’’ Prater in Riverton, IL. They were 
blessed with four children, Nancy, Janet, Ron-
ald, and Diane, 10 grandchildren, and 16 
greatgrandchildren. After retiring from his dis-
tinguished 38-year-career at Caterpillar Inc., 
Cyril and Abbie spent most of their time trav-
eling and visiting family all over the country. 
He was preceded in death by his wife of 68 
years on April 18, 2015. Cyril’s fondest memo-
ries in life were ones spent with his family and 
his love and pride for them was boundless. 
I want to offer my condolences to the 
Leuelling family and the people of Morton on 
the loss of a great man. Cyril left a lasting im-
pact on those who had the pleasure of know-
ing him. May his memory be eternal.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of H.R. 4502, the Seven Bill 
Appropriation Minibus for Fiscal Year 2022. 
This critical bill is a massive down payment 
on the promises we have made to the Amer-
ican people. After years of disinvestment in 
our infrastructure, reductions in health care 
spending, and limits on climate research, after 
18 months of a devastating pandemic from 
which nearly all of our communities continue 
to struggle, this bill represents a chance to 
create good jobs, secure our safety net pro-
grams, and address the impacts of climate 
change. 
The bill makes a massive investment in 
working families. It provides a $20 billion in-
crease for high-poverty schools and a $3 bil-
lion increase in funding for special education 
programs. The bill dramatically expands fund-
ing 
for 
early 
childhood 
education 
and 
childcare. It continues our commitment to ex-
panding access to higher education by in-
creasing the maximum Pell Grant by $400, 
dramatically increasing funding to expand 
higher education opportunities, including TRIO 
programs and GEAR UP, and increasing fund-
ing for Teacher Quality Partnerships and other 
higher education programs. The bill also pro-
vides $106 billion for SNAP and includes pro-
visions to ensure that SNAP will not run out of 
money and families will continue receiving 
benefits throughout the year. 
I am proud to see the dramatic increases in 
funding for key health care priorities and to 
address long-standing health disparities and 
inequities. First and foremost, this bill finally,

after 45 years, repeals the racist, anti-woman 
Hyde Amendment to ensure that women are 
able to access abortion regardless of their in-
come or where they live. The bill also provides 
a massive boost in funding for Title X Family 
Planning Services and for Teen Pregnancy 
Prevention Program, to ensure that these 
science-based, cost-effective programs con-
tinue to provide critical health and wellness 
services. In addition, the bill continues to in-
crease our investments in life-saving research 
and public health infrastructure, including $49 
billion for the National Institutes of Health, 
$10.6 billion for the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, $1 billion in new flexible 
funding to improve the public health infrastruc-
ture, $1.8 billion for Health Centers, which in-
cludes a nearly l000 percent increase in fund-
ing to $50 million for school-based health cen-
ters. 
The bill makes a significant investment in 
our crumbling infrastructure while creating new 
jobs and ensuring that we finally address the 
climate crisis. In particular, it provides $105.7 
billion to invest in transit passenger rail, air-
ports and highways and provides $250 million 
to ensure those investments also reduce our 
admissions, benefit communities too often left 
behind, and increase the climate resiliency of 
our infrastructure. The bill also doubles invest-
ments in passenger and freight rail and pro-
motes safety through investments in transit 
state of good repair and expanded transpor-
tation safety and inspection workforce. Finally, 
after the House passed an amendment I of-
fered, the bill will provide $6 million in grants 
for security and maintenance at 9/11 Memo-
rials and Museums. Taken all together, these 
investments will create tens of thousands of 
good-paying, union jobs and help our econ-
omy continue to recover and grow. 
Access to housing remains a major concern 
in New York, and this bill will take some steps 
so that more New Yorkers are safely and 
affordably housed. The bill expands housing 
choice vouchers, or Section 8, to help 125,000 
more individuals and families find affordable 
housing in their community and ensures that 
all 4.8 million families currently receiving hous-
ing assistance can stay in their homes. The 
bill also matches my request for $600 million 
for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with 
HIV/ AIDS (HOPWA), a $170 million increase, 
so that New York City and other major cities 
do not face a massive funding cut this year. I 
am, however, very disappointed the bill pro-
vides just $3.4 billion for public housing capital 
needs, which is not even enough to cover the 
massive repair backlog at NYCHA alone. As I 
have said many times before, the ongoing 
underfunding of public housing capital needs 
is not sustainable for NYCHA or other large 
public housing agencies. I am committed to 
working with my colleagues in the New York 
Delegation and across Congress to address 
this concern as quickly as possible. 
In addition to all of these critical invest-
ments, the minibus funds eight critical commu-
nity projects in my district, totaling over $9.2 
million in direct funding to NY–10. These 
projects include a new Parenting Center at 
Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, ele-
vator repairs at Harborview Terrace Housing 
Development, expansion of mental health and 
substance abuse program at the LGBT Cen-
ter, and funding for the Columbia-Harlem 
Small Business Development Center. I am 
proud to be able to deliver this funding and 
bring new jobs, better health outcomes, and 
improved financial stability back to my district.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
MATTHEW 
KOLOJEJCHICK 
ON 
HIS 
INDUC-
TION INTO THE LUZERNE COUN-
TY SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete and North-
eastern 
Pennsylvania 
native 
Matthew 
Kolojejchick. Matthew will be inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 
for his distinct athletic achievements in the 
sports of swimming and football. He and his 
fellow inductees will be honored at a reception 
on August 8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
In 2004, Matthew joined the Wyoming Val-
ley West High School freshman football team 
as a running back and linebacker. He also 
joined the swim team and broke a 20-year-old 
school record in the 50 freestyle in his first 
varsity meet. At the district competition, he 
won gold in both the 50 and 100 freestyle, and 
he went on to the state competition where he 
competed in the consolations. After transfer-
ring to Bishop Hoban High School for his 
sophomore year, he stood out as a running 
back on the football field. In the pool for the 
Argents, he won two district gold medals in 
the 50 freestyle and the 100 breaststroke. At 
States, he broke the existing PIAA 100 breast-
stroke record but fell short in the final touch 
and won the silver medal. As a junior, he 
dominated the football field as a running back 
and linebacker, leading the entire Wyoming 
Valley Conference in rushing yards. In swim-
ming, Matthew once again excelled at Dis-
tricts, winning gold in his leading events, the 
50 freestyle and the 100 breaststroke; he went 
on to become the state champion in the 50 
freestyle. 
For his senior year, Matthew transferred 
back to Wyoming Valley West to play football 
under local legend, coach George Curry. He 
helped lead the team to a one-loss season 
and to the state playoffs. In the first game of 
the playoff series, he rushed for seven touch-
downs against the undefeated Delaware Val-
ley. In the next game against Parkland, a 
team that had not been scored on in seven 
games, Matthew scored two touchdowns. For 
a second year, he led the entire conference in 
rushing, and he set five school records: most 
touchdowns in a season, most rushing yards 
in a season, most rushing yards in a game, 
most touchdowns in a game, and most 200- 
yard rushing games in a season. 
Matthew’s lifelong dream was to play Divi-
sion I college football, and he chose to forgo 
his senior swim season to make that dream a 
reality. He received several 1 AA college foot-
ball scholarship offers before ultimately ac-
cepting a full scholarship to the University of 
Rhode Island where he was red-shirted his 
first year. His sophomore year, Coach Butch 
Davis of the University of North Carolina of-
fered him a spot as a preferred walk-on. He 
made the team and played back up running 
back and as a special team player for kickoff 
and punt return/coverage. He played in two 
bowl games with the Tar Heels: the Music City 
Bowl in 2010 in a win against Tennessee and 
the Advocare Bowl in 2011 in a Joss against 
Missouri. 
It is an honor to recognize Matthew on his 
induction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame. May his story and athletic career 
serve as an inspiration to the next generation 
of Pennsylvania athletes striving for excel-
lence.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
JOSEPH ‘‘JOE’’ ‘‘CHITO’’ GARCIA 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the life of Mr. Joseph 
‘‘Joe’’ ‘‘Chito’’ Garcia. 
Born in 1930 during the Great Depression, 
Mr. Garcia had a strong desire to help his 
family and his community. As a young boy he 
shined shoes, sold lemons and delivered 
newspapers around West Tampa to help sup-
port his family. He then grew up to be consid-
ered a wise, quiet, individual with a big heart 
and was described as ‘‘an outstanding exam-
ple of an honorable man who lived his faith, 
his deep devotion to his family and friends.’’ 
During his childhood, Mr. Garcia joined the 
West Tampa Boys Club and later went on to 
support four local clubs by serving as presi-
dent of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Tampa 
Bay. He worked as a lawyer and served as 
the Chairman of the Tampa Port Authority. 
During his 16 years on the Tampa Port Au-
thority Board of Commissioners, Mr. Garcia 
fulfilled his goal of developing the port to be-
come business friendly for a growing Tampa 
area. Driving around the Channelside area in 
our hometown, you can see the influence and 
vision Mr. Garcia had for our city. When he re-
tired, the Port Authority named their building 
after him. He was also involved with the Ybor 
City Rotary Club and the Florida Aquarium, all 
which made him one of Tampa’s most notable 
philanthropists. 
Mr. Garcia’s life was lined by the values of 
his faith and service to his country and com-
munity. He attended Jesuit High School and 
got a scholarship to attend Loyola University, 
where he worked two or three jobs at a time 
to help pay his way. There, he joined the Navy 
serving in various leadership positions and 
continued serving in the Navy Reserve after 
active duty. After the Navy, Mr. Garcia at-
tended law school at the University of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
Florida and my neighbors across Tampa Bay, 
I am proud to honor. Mr. Garcia who died in 
the morning of May 28, 2021, two days after 
his 91st birthday and a lifetime of helping our 
Tampa community grow. Mr. Garcia made 
great contributions to advance the well-being 
of our Tampa neighbors through his integrity 
and leadership. We are grateful for his con-
tributions and may his soul rest in peace.

GOLD STARS MOTHERS FAMILY 
MONUMENT EXTENSION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of the Gold Star 
Mothers Family Monument Extension Act of 
2021. 
Since our country’s entrance into World War 
I, the Gold Star tradition has remained a sim-
ple, yet powerful reminder of all the sacrifices 
made by our servicemembers and their fami-
lies. The qualities that our Gold Star Families 
possess are the qualities that we all seek in 
America: courage, perseverance, strength, 
and above all, an unflagging determination to 
see the right prevail. 
The passage of this bill and the ultimate 
completion of the Gold Star Mothers Family 
National Monument would be the clearest dis-
play of gratitude from the American people. 
The monument would embody the spirit of na-
tional service, highlight the ongoing contribu-
tions Gold Star Families contribute to our com-
munities, and provide visitors with a space to 
reflect and remember loss. 
This bill would not have been possible with-
out the tireless advocacy of Judith Young, a 
constituent of mine from Moorestown, New 
Jersey. I thank Judith for her work for the 
commemoration of Gold Star Families through 
the monument and thank the House for pass-
ing this meaningful legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the bipartisan work 
that was undertaken in the last Congress to 
get to this moment and the same work that 
was done to bring this bill to the floor.

IN RECOGNITION OF THOMAS 
DOMBROSKI 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of Mr. Thomas ‘‘Tom’’ 
Dombroski, a long-time resident of Detroit, 
who contributed actively to several community- 
based 
organizations 
and 
was 
especially 
known for his service as a member of the 
board of the Southwest Detroit Community 
Benefits Coalition and as a proud member of 
the Teamsters. 
Tom was a tough, big-hearted person 
whose sense of humor and warmth belied his 
tenacity in the fight to protect his community in 
southwest Detroit. Tom was a champion of the 
underdog and advocated for justice on behalf 
of those who needed it most. Before he re-
tired, Tom’s work with the Teamsters Union 
prepared him for his second act in life as a 
community advocate for equitable develop-
ment of the Gordie Howe Bridge international 
border crossing in Detroit. He was outspoken 
in the fight for clean air and good quality of life 
for residents who will live in the shadow of the 
large-scale transportation infrastructure. 
I have always known Tom to be generous 
with his time and energy. His spirit will be 
sorely missed by the community he served. 
Please join me as we recognize Thomas 
Dombroski’s many contributions to the families 
of southwest Detroit and beyond as we give 
honor to his memory.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH COS-
TELLO ON HIS INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
native 
Joseph 
Costello. Joseph will be inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 
for his distinct athletic and coaching achieve-
ments in the sport of track and field. He and 
his fellow inductees will be honored at a re-
ception on August 8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
Joseph was a standout athlete in football 
and track and field at West Pittston High 
School from 1957 to 1961. He was a two-time 
PIAA District II champion in the shotput. Jo-
seph continued his academic career at the 
University of Scranton where he earned an 
undergraduate degree in education and a 
master’s degree in administration. In 1966, he 
began his teaching, coaching, and administra-
tive career at Pittston Area High School. 
In 1970, Joseph founded the Pittston Area 
track and field program, beginning his leg-
endary coaching career. He developed and 
built the program on the foundation of meas-
ured and thoughtful coaching while fostering a 
strong feeder system which resulted in hun-
dreds of students participating in the program 
under his leadership. In the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, the Pittston Area Patriots domi-
nated regional track and field. Between 1980 
and 1983, the team won 55 consecutive 
meets, four consecutive Wyoming Valley Con-
ference (WVC) League championships, four 
consecutive PIAA District II championships, 
and four Jordan Relay titles, in addition to set-
ting district records and winning state medals. 
In 1983, the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader 
named him the first WVC Track Coach of the 
Year. 
Some of the impressive records set by Jo-
seph’s athletes still stand today in PIAA Dis-
trict II, nearly four decades later. The Pittston 
Area 4 x 400 relay record of 3:23.44 set in 
1981 by state medalists Ed Zaleski, Al 
Michalec, Vince O’Boyle, and Jack Goldowski 
still stands, as does the District II record in the 
400 of 48.74 seconds set in 1982 by state 
medalist Vince O’Boyle and the District II 4 x 
800 relay record of 8:00.84 set in 1981 by 
Mike Lombardo, Jay Loughney, Joe Bannon, 
and Bruce Marancik. Many of Joseph’s star 
athletes went on to have impressive collegiate 
careers 
at 
institutions 
such 
as 
East 
Stroudsburg University, Bucknell University, 
and Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
In 1983, Joseph retired from coaching to 
serve as the assistant principal of Pittston 
Area High School, and in 1992, he was 
named principal, a position he held until his 
retirement in 1998. The effects of Joseph’s 
coaching were felt in the years after his retire-
ment during the 1984 and 1985 seasons as 
the Patriots went on to win 86 consecutive 
regular season WVC meets and six consecu-
tive WVC and PIAA District II titles. 
It is an honor to recognize Joseph on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and coaching career 
serve as an inspiration to the next generation 
of Pennsylvania athletes and coaches striving 
for excellence.

IN RECOGNITION OF MTV’S 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize MTV, on 
its 40th anniversary for the cultural imprint it 
has left on our country and the work it con-
tinues to do as one of the world’s leading 
global youth brands. Throughout MTV’s 40 
years, the brand has created reality television, 
expanded the creative mediums of the music 
industry, and inspired our nation’s youth. 
Today, this New York-born and bred brand 
reaches 180 countries and 1.8 billion people 
around the world. 
In August 1981, MTV exploded onto the air-
waves with the release of the first-ever music 
video, ‘‘Video Killed the Radio Star’’ by The 
Buggies. Shortly after, MTV began to define 
popular culture and the music industry in an 
unprecedented manner with popular music be-
coming more visual and dance and clothing 
styles garnering a greater importance to the 
whole experience of music. MTV’s popularity 
grew to such heights that in 1984 it hosted the 
network’s first Video Music Awards—known as 
the VMAs—ceremony at Radio City Music Hall 
in the great city of New York. 
In 1985, MTV began to air safe sex Public 
Service Announcements (PSAs), making it 
one of the first television networks to do so. 
These safe-sex initiatives continued over the 
years through MTV’s It’s Your Sex Life cam-
paign and more, helping to educate our na-
tion’s youth on the importance of safe sex 
practices. MTV was a pioneer in the nascent 
efforts to ensure our nation’s teens and young 
adults had the knowledge to protect them-
selves from sexually transmitted diseases and 
infections, contributing to lowering the rates of 
such diseases in the following decades. 
Continuing its work in this type of edu-
cational programming, in February 1992, MTV 
launched Choose or Lose during the 1992 
presidential election. The awareness cam-
paign successfully engaged young people by 
demystifying the political process, encouraging 
registration, stressing the importance of voting, 
and highlighting issues of daily importance to 
Americans. The Choose or Lose campaign 
contributed to a twenty percent increase in 
youth turnout during the 1992 general election 
and remains a model for encouraging youth 
voter engagement. 
In 1996, MTV grew Choose or Lose to in-
clude a bus that toured 80,000 miles between 
forty-eight states to engage even more young

Americans in the political process and shed 
light on the issues impacting them. During this 
time, MTV devoted more than 100 hours of 
airtime to policy issues affecting young people. 
The campaign was successful in registering 
30,000 new young voters, and when President 
Clinton signed the Voter Registration Act of 
1993 into law, he cited MTV and Rock the 
Vote’s role in making such a landmark law 
possible. MTV used its voice to promote the 
bill, educate the public on the bill on MTV 
News, and provide a platform for the bill’s 
sponsors and proponents. In addition, MTV 
provided $20 million worth of airtime for Motor 
Voter PSAs, directing viewers to call their rep-
resentatives in support of the legislation. 
In March 2008, MTV broadcast an hour-long 
special event that brought together presi-
dential 
candidates 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
John 
McCain and Barack Obama, as well as eight 
young veterans for an intimate discussion on 
the 5th anniversary of the Iraq war. 
MTV also built a coalition of 3,000 partners 
in 2020 to launch the first-ever Vote Early 
Day. This new civic holiday and day of action 
aims to keep younger Americans informed and 
assist them in exercising their right to vote. 
Through these actions, MTV has shown the 
power of popular culture in motivating our 
younger generations to vote by using its influ-
ence to encourage millions of young people to 
‘‘Choose or Lose’’ and ‘‘Vote Early.’’ 
In addition to its civic education work, MTV 
also has a longstanding history of mental 
health advocacy. They were awarded a Pea-
body Award in 2007 for their work on mtvU: 
Half of Us, a multiplatform campaign that in-
cludes a thorough website and numerous pub-
lic service spots to help college students deal 
with stress and depression. And earlier this 
year, they launched a new multi-year initiative, 
‘‘Mental Health is Health,’’ which will harness 
the power of storytelling to destigmatize men-
tal health. 
Inspired by the spirit of youth—from escap-
ism to activism—MTV’s impact has tran-
scended the entertainment industry and pop 
culture reaching audiences and driving social 
change all around the world. 
I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me 
in recognizing MTV for its contributions to so-
ciety and culture. Happy 40th anniversary, and 
we can’t wait to see what the next 40 bring.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. LEON 
HALEY, JR. 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Dr. Leon Haley, Jr., 
who served as CEO of UF Health Jacksonville 
in my district. His sudden passing on July 25, 
2021, is an incredible loss not only to his 
many family and friends who loved him but 
was also felt deeply by our Jacksonville med-
ical community. 
His colleagues have shared their tremen-
dous respect for Dr. Haley, remarking that he 
led his team with integrity, kindness, and com-
mitment to all he was called to serve. As the 
first Black CEO of UF Health, Dr. Haley 
prioritized the importance of providing high- 
quality and compassionate care to patients of 
all backgrounds and was a known advocate 
for equality in healthcare. Dr. Haley played a 
pivotal role in Florida’s response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and is believed to be the 
first Floridian to receive the COVID–19 vac-
cine. 
On behalf of our Northeast Florida commu-
nity, I rise today to recognize Dr. Haley for his 
years of public service and dedication to our 
community. I offer my heartfelt prayers for 
peace and comfort for his family, friends, and 
all who were blessed to know Dr. Haley. We 
come together during this difficult time to 
honor his memory as a great medical leader, 
doctor, colleague, friend, and father. May he 
rest in peace.

IN APPRECIATION OF MS. TESSA 
E. BROWNE FOR HER SERVICE 
ON MY STAFF 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in deep appreciation of Ms. Tessa E. 
Browne for her service to the American people 
as a member of my staff. 
Ms. Browne joined my office in February 
2019, having worked previously for former 
Secretary of Energy Dr. Ernest J. Moniz fol-
lowing his departure from the Obama Adminis-
tration. She was referred to us by the office of 
U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D–CA), and 
after just one meeting we hired her on the 
spot. 
The Scheduler is widely considered to be 
one of the most demanding and critical staff 
positions in any Congressional office. From 
ensuring that I made it to cast votes on the 
floor of the House of Representatives, join 
Committee proceedings, or attend meetings 
with foreign dignitaries and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Ms. Browne’s work each day ensured 
that I was able to carry out my duties as a 
Member of Congress. 
In addition to serving as my Scheduler, Ms. 
Browne has also served as my Digital Direc-
tor. From day one in that role, she helped to 
revitalize and significantly increase our online 
engagement across my social media chan-
nels. Many of my highest-performing social 
media posts occurred during her tenure, for 
which I am grateful. She raised the bar for my 
office’s social media presence and set an ex-
ample that I will hold my staff to for years to 
come. 
This fall, Ms. Browne will be pursuing her 
Master of Public Administration at Columbia 
University’s School of International and Public 
Affairs in New York City. I and all the mem-
bers of Team Garamendi wish her the very 
best in her graduate studies. During her ten-
ure on my staff, Ms. Browne demonstrated an 
unfaltering work ethic, approached every task 
with upbeat enthusiasm, and cared deeply for 
her colleagues and those around her. These 
same qualities will serve her well in her future 
endeavors. 
While we will miss her deeply, we all look 
forward with anticipation to what Ms. Browne 
will do next and expect great things. She will 
remain a deeply valued member of Team 
Garamendi, always.

SHANA 
WELCH ON HER INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
native 
Shana 
Welch. Shana will be inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 
for her distinct athletic and coaching achieve-
ments in the sports of swimming and water 
polo. She and her fellow inductees will be 
honored at a reception on August 8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
At Wyoming Valley West High School, 
Shana was a standout member of the swim 
team. She received All-American recognition 
from the National Interscholastic Swim Coach-
es Association in both the 50–yard and 100– 
yard freestyle event. She was named Con-
ference Swimmer of the Year four times and 
won 15 PIAA District II swimming medals. 
Shana was not only a skilled swimmer, but 
she was also a key player on the soccer, 
water polo, and track and field teams, earning 
four letters in water polo and soccer and one 
in track and field. On the water polo team, she 
helped lead the team to their first State Cham-
pionship in 1999. She was a four-time All- 
State and four-time All-American, and in her 
freshman year she was named Rookie of the 
Year. After her senior year, she was crowned 
MVP. 
Shana continued her academic and athletic 
careers at the University of Michigan, estab-
lishing herself as one of the best players in 
school water polo history. She set new pro-
gram records for career goals and points and 
led the team as captain in 2006 and 2007. 
The 
Collegiate 
Water 
Polo 
Association 
(CWPA) recognized her athletic prowess 
throughout her collegiate career, naming her 
Rookie of the Year in 2005, MVP of the 
CWPA Western Division three times, and 
CWPA Player of the Week nine times. Shana 
was instrumental in leading the team to the 
2005 CWPA Championship and earned an 
NCAA tournament berth, as well as four con-
secutive division crowns from 2004 to 2007. 
USA Speedo named her a Top 40 player in 
both 2005 and 2006. In addition to her domi-
nance in the pool, Shana excelled academi-
cally. She received the University of Michigan 
Athletic Academic Achievement Award in 2006 
and 2007, and she received the Bob Ufer Sr. 
Athlete Award in 2007. 
Shana played professional water polo in 
Australia with the UWA Comets the year after 
graduation and in Greece from 2010–2011.

OFFICER JUSTIN PACIFIC: 2020–2021 
POLICE OFFICER OF THE YEAR 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Officer Justin Pacific of High Point, 
North Carolina, and his noteworthy accom-
plishment of being named Greensboro Police 
Department’s Police Officer of the Year for 
2020–2021. 
Officer Pacific has dedicated his life to 
keeping his community safe through service. 
Beginning in November of 2005, he spent the 
past fifteen years across several different 
posts—working as a patrol officer, tactical offi-
cer, detective, and most recently as an investi-
gator on the District 1 Critical Response 
Team. In each of the difficult jobs he has held, 
Officer Pacific worked tirelessly to make the 
Greensboro area a better place for all resi-
dents, earning recognition from his colleagues 
and superiors for his strength in leadership. 
As an investigator, Officer Pacific has devel-
oped a reputation for his tenacity and con-
sistent delivery of results. Having recently 
aided in the recovery of hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars’ worth of stolen automobiles 
and machinery, Officer Pacific also brought 
perpetrators of the thefts to justice. He has as-
sisted in procuring $40,000 of drug money, 
$4,000 of equipment, and has carried out the 
crucial role of investigating major assault and 
murder cases within District 1. However, these 
accolades alone do not speak to the true rea-
son Officer Pacific is deserving of the award 
bestowed to him. 
Rather, it is his mentor mentality and serv-
ant’s heart that qualify Officer Pacific as 2020– 
2021’s Police Officer of the Year. Going above 
and beyond his written job description, Officer 
Pacific has dedicated extra efforts to the edu-
cation, development, and leadership of his 
teammates. His guidance and commitment to 
the professional development of his peers 
formed the driving force behind the readiness 
and success of the District 1 Critical Response 
Team. Even when acknowledged for the unit’s 
high level of performance, Officer Pacific has 
humbly attributed his accomplishments to the 
strength of the team that he helped build. 
Supporting Officer Pacific in his excellence 
is the team he has assembled at home. Back-
ing his operation is his incredible wife, Jen-
nifer. The couple have two children, Braedon 
and Addison, who play an equally important 
part in making Officer Pacific the man he is 
today. Together, the four-person crew form the 
accomplishment Officer Pacific is most proud 
of—his family. 
Without a doubt, the lasting impact of Offi-
cer Pacific’s service to our community is the 
increased safety and security of individuals 
and families alike. Please join me in cele-
brating Officer Justin Pacific and his dedica-
tion to the Greensboro Police Department. 
Congratulations, Justin on being named the 
2020–2021 Police Officer of the Year.

DWAYNE STEPHENS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dwayne Stephens of 
S.M.A.R.T. Local #9 on his retirement. 
Dwayne is a lifelong resident of Colorado, 
mostly in Jefferson County, where he has 
committed his time and energy into serving his 
community and local unions. He started as the 
Business Manager of Local 9 in September 
2000, and continuously held that position until 
July 2012, along with several other positions, 
including Trustee on the Nuclear/Hazardous 
Materials Committee, Trustee for the Stabiliza-
tion Agreement of the Sheet Metal Industry 
(SASMI), member of the International General 
Executive Council, as well as rising to Inter-
national Vice President during his time as 
Business Manager. He was then re-elected as 
Business Manager of Local 9 in July 2015 and 
served in that capacity until July 2021. He has 
been a strong advocate and champion for 
union rights and trade issues. 
In addition to his service to Local 9, Dwayne 
has been very active politically throughout his 
career. I have worked closely with him in sev-
eral capacities, including during his time with 
the Sheetmetal Worker’s Union, as the Colo-
rado AFL-CIO President, and his work with the 
Jefferson County Democrats, including his 
time as chair. I have always been grateful for 
his hard work and dedication to his commu-
nity. I am particularly appreciative of his level-
headed approach to policy matters and his 
kind, calm demeanor is one of a kind. 
Dwayne is a loving husband and has been 
with his wife Linda for decades. I have en-
joyed my friendship with both of them, and I 
wish Dwayne all the best in retirement and 
send gratitude for his service to the metro 
Denver community and the great State of Col-
orado.

CONGRATULATING JOHN 
SCHOUTEN 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 29, 2021 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate John Schouten on his retire-
ment as Chief Executive Officer of World Wide 
Sires, an international bovine genetics com-
pany in Visalia, California. John retires after 
thirty-five years at World Wide Sires and twen-
ty years as its CEO. 
Despite joining World Wide Sires with little 
international experience, John rigorously ap-
plied himself, forging relationships that allowed 
U.S. genetics to enter countless parts of the 
world and support dairy farmers globally. As 
CEO, John continuously pursued the latest 
technological innovations that made World 
Wide Sires an international leader in the bo-
vine genetics industry. 
In addition to pioneering World Wide Sires’ 
success, John has been a leader for the 
whole industry. He served numerous times as 
Chairman of the National Association of Ani-
mal Breeders International Marketing Com-
mittee and worked closely with USDA Foreign 
Agriculture Service staff in various countries to 
develop more direct pathways for importing 
U.S. genetics. Under John’s leadership, World 
Wide Sires’ export business has grown more 
than 500 percent, expanding the company’s 
genetics and support services to over 75 
countries. 
As a dairyman, I am grateful for John’s con-
siderable contributions to the global bovine ge-
netics industry and helping American cattle 
farmers receive access to foreign markets. I 
wish John all the best in his retirement.
