REMEMBERING RESULTS 
ADVOCATE LA’SHON MARSHALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memories of Michigan’s 
13th District Strong mother, friend, 
sister, 
and 
community 
advocate, 
La’Shon Marshall; her partner, Aaron 
Benson; and her 5-year-old son, Caleb, 
all of whom we lost to senseless gun vi-
olence this past week. 
I knew La’Shon Marshall as a loving 
mother, a daughter, and a friend, but I 
knew her also as a constituent and as 
part of a group called RESULTS. It is 
an antipoverty advocacy organization, 
and RESULTS would meet with me 
every year to talk about adjusting pov-
erty and access to quality housing for 
our families. 
In one of my first meetings, I met 
La’Shon, and she was passionate. She 
talked 
about 
renters’ 
rights. 
She 
talked about access to safe housing. We 
made an instant connection based on 
our mutual passions: housing stability, 
ending childhood poverty, and ensuring 
a better quality of life for all. 
Hearing of her murder was dev-
astating not only to my team and me 
but to our community. This is a trag-
edy that no community should endure. 
La’Shon was truly a beacon of light. 
She will be remembered as an incred-
ible mother, and we will always re-
member Caleb as the light of her life. 
She truly loved him. And I will always 
remember knowing her as an excep-
tional advocate for the 13th District 
Strong. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in re-
membering La’Shon Marshall, Caleb 
Marshall, and Aaron Benson of our 
community as we mourn their loss. 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF TERRANCE ARMOUR AND 
CARLY TAYLOR 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my outrage and deep sadness 
about the deaths of Wayne County 
teens Terrance Armour and Carly Tay-
lor, whose lives were lost to gun vio-
lence last year. 
Carlesa and Terrance were accom-
plished 
high 
school 
students 
with 
bright futures ahead of them. Terrance 
had plans to attend college in Nevada. 
Carly was a standout on the Ecorse 
High School basketball team who was 
being recruited for college athletic 
scholarships and opportunities. 
This past weekend, I hugged both of 
their mothers, and I remember the 
tears from Dionne Weathers and Tikia 
Armour-Brooks. There is a saying that 
the most painful good-byes are the 
ones that are never said and never ex-
plained. 
As we mark this grim anniversary, I 
offer 
my 
deepest 
sympathies 
to 
Terrance and Carlesa’s families and 
loved ones and commit to stopping gun 
violence in our country. And as they 
continue to mourn their loss, I want 
them to know we are working on behalf 
of them and also in honor of their 
memories. 
SUPPORTING THE HONORING OUR PACT ACT 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to speak today in support of the Hon-
oring Our PACT Act. 
Our soldiers put their lives at risk 
every day and became severely ill as a 
result of burn pit exposure. We owe it 
to them to care for them in their time 
of need. I am voting ‘‘yes’’ on the 
PACT Act because they deserve noth-
ing less. 
I greatly appreciate the work of 
Chairman TAKANO, the members of the 
committee, and the staff in getting 
this task done. It was not easy. How-
ever, I must be clear. While this bill is 
clearly the best attempt yet to pay our 
Nation’s debt to our sick and dying 
veterans, it is only a first step. It does 
not cover all the illnesses believed to 
be caused by burn pit exposure, and it 
does not fully invest in new, innovative 
treatments that could drastically im-
prove their quality of life and recovery 
chances. 
To hear some of my colleagues, in-
cluding many who happily vote for 
every absurd defense budget without a 
blink of an eye, complain about the 
cost of treating our veterans is down-
right insulting. It is time for Congress 
to do its job and care for our veterans. 
Let’s start by passing the Honoring 
Our PACT Act and then immediately 
get back to work on new legislation 
that comprehensively covers any vet-
eran who has become ill as a result of 
exposure to toxins during their service 
to our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1212 
March 2, 2022 
RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, as back-
ground, I have served on the House 
Committee on Armed Services for 11 
years and on the Committee on For-
eign Affairs. 
There is an old saying: Those who do 
not learn from history are doomed to 
repeat it. 
The lesson from Vietnam is that war 
is hell. If America is unwilling to do 
horrible things required to win a war, 
then America should not fight it. Be all 
in or all out. 
A World War II lesson is that Eu-
rope’s pre-war appeasement strategy 
does not work against aggressor na-
tions. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler and his 
National Socialist German Workers’ 
Party time and again seized more and 
more of Europe. Beginning in 1935, 
Adolf Hitler and dictatorial socialist 
Germany annexed the Saarland; in-
vaded 
and 
seized 
Austria 
in 
the 
Anschluss; seized the Sudetenland from 
Czechoslovakia; 
seized 
the 
Slovak 
state Bohemia and Moravia; and forced 
Lithuania into ceding the Memel Terri-
tory. 
In response each time, Europe and 
the free world tried appeasement and 
did 
little 
to 
nothing, 
thereby 
emboldening Adolf Hitler and dictato-
rial socialist Germany. 
The result? Hitler and Germany in-
vaded Poland, triggering the Holocaust 
and the deaths of tens of millions of 
people in World War II. 
The question is: Has the world 
learned from history? 
In 2014, Vladimir Putin and Russia 
invaded Crimea. The free world did lit-
tle to nothing. 
Also in 2014, Vladimir Putin and Rus-
sia inspired a rebellion in Donetsk and 
Lugansk in Ukraine, costing thousands 
of lives and creating hundreds of thou-
sands of desperate refugees. The free 
world did little to nothing. 
Last month, Russia invaded Ukraine 
again, apparently seeking the total de-
struction and conquest of Ukraine. I 
admire the bravery and kindred spirit 
of citizens who fight and die for liberty 
and 
freedom 
against 
overwhelming 
odds. 
They remind me of American Revolu-
tionary War heroes like George Wash-
ington and Patrick Henry and places 
like Valley Forge, Cowpens, Kings 
Mountain, and Saratoga. 
Fortunately, something is different 
about this Russian attack on Ukraine. 
This time, the world does not do noth-
ing. This time, the free world is helping 
Ukraine during their time of peril. This 
time, time will tell whether the world’s 
help is enough and effective. 
First, Europe and America impose 
economic sanctions on Russia. In that 
vein, we must learn from Vietnam. 
Economic sanctions must be all in or 
all out. There can be no half measures. 
America must be in this to win or not 
be in it at all. 
Second, Europe and America must 
be, and are, supplying Ukraine with 
much-needed 
tank-killing 
Javelins, 
aircraft-destroying Stingers, advanced 
fighter jets to replace those lost in 
combat, and other military equipment 
Ukraine desperately needs. 
Third, Europe must decide whether 
to deploy combat troops. For emphasis, 
it is my view that America should not 
even consider providing combat troops 
in Ukraine unless Europe first does so 
in significant numbers. Even then, 
whatever America decides about troop 
assistance should never go beyond as-
sistance to our European allies. 
I, like many Americans, am tired of 
America spending our Treasury and 
our lives in so many parts of the globe. 
It is time for the rest of the free world 
to step up. 
Ukrainians bravely shed themselves 
of the dictatorial boot in 1991. Russians 
can, and should, do the same. 
My message to the Russian people is 
this: Your Russian comrades fought 
side by side with you in World War II 
against Adolf Hitler and dictatorial so-
cialist Germany. Now, Vladimir Putin 
forces you to kill each other and die by 
the thousands in Ukraine. It does not 
have to be this way. The true way to 
peace is to do what America regularly 
does: replace our political leaders. 
I urge freedom-loving Russians to 
bravely stand up and do the same. Do 
what is necessary to get the leadership 
Russians want and deserve, and do it 
before it is too late. That is the lesson 
of World War II. 
f 
USVI HISTORY MONTH: THEME OF 
FIRSTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, let me 
start by saying that I am a proud Vir-
gin Islander. I stand on the shoulders 
of strong Virgin Islanders who came 
before me and who are known for their 
courage, 
leadership, 
sacrifice, 
and, 
most importantly, their resilience. We 
are known for so much more than just 
white sandy beaches and as a popular 
vacation destination. We are made of 
culture-rich lands and a diverse his-
tory. 
March 
is 
Virgin 
Islands 
History 
Month. Though not always pretty, 
there is great beauty in our past that 
has shaped the Virgin Islands of our 
present. Like most Caribbean coun-
tries, the Virgin Islands’ history, too, 
begins with the story of pre-Columbian 
inhabitants of the islands and of slav-
ery. 
Almost 3,000 years prior to Chris-
topher Columbus landing in 1493, Na-
tive American tribes, such as the 
Ciboney, the Caribs, and the Arawak 
Indians, have long inhabited the is-
lands. 
In 1493, when Columbus attempted to 
land on the island that I live on, St. 
Croix, he was repelled at Salt River, 
where he met the Carib Indians who 
kept him and his troops from landing 
and making landfall there. 
The period of Columbus’ visit ulti-
mately set the course for seven other 
European flags to claim the Virgin Is-
lands and, unfortunately, brought de-
mise to the indigenous people. 
Today, they are found on reserved 
lands, and only for a few islands, and 
no longer exist in the Virgin Islands. 
Much of our global history was built 
upon slavery and colonization, espe-
cially in the Caribbean islands. By the 
early 1700s, the Virgin Islands was no 
stranger to enslavement and European 
colonization. 
On the island of St. John, a Ghanaian 
by the name of Breffu is credited with 
leading the first and one of the longest- 
lasting rebellions in the Americas on 
the island of St. John. She empowered 
more than 150 enslaved Africans to 
fight for their freedom and held that is-
land for over 6 months, where the 
Danes had to bring in the Spanish Ar-
mada and the French fleet to get the 
slaves back in line. 
Several years, almost a century, 
later, in 1848 on the island of St. Croix, 
slaves led a rebellion, an armed insur-
rection, which led to the emanci-
pation—15 years before the United 
States emancipation. The Virgin Is-
lands and Haiti are the only two places 
to gain freedom through violent over-
throw. 
The celebration of V.I. Emancipation 
Day on July 3 marks this day. Virgin 
Islands’ history does not end with just 
the bleak stories of European colo-
nialism and forced slavery. We have so 
many celebrated heroes, from individ-
uals who were the founders of San 
Francisco; Denmark Vesey, who led the 
rebellion in South Carolina; Hubert 
Harrison, the great socialist mind who 
was the thought leader for Marcus Gar-
vey; Edward Wilmoth Blyden, who was 
the founder of Pan-Africanism; Nella 
Larsen, one of the Harlem Renaissance 
writers; Ruby Rouss, who was an aide- 
de-camp to Eisenhower; Sam Ebbesen, 
a general and friend of Colin Powell. 
Without that history and those indi-
viduals, we would not be the Virgin Is-
lands we are today, which I am proud 
to represent and call my home and my 
heritage. 
Throughout the month of March, let 
us celebrate our heritage and our his-
tory and look to our future. 
Happy Virgin Islands History Month.

March 2, 2022 
Commissioners. Through her various 
roles in Omaha, she has dedicated her 
time and service to bettering our com-
munity. 
As an Omaha native, she attended 
Beals 
Grade 
School, 
Central 
High 
School, and the University of Nebraska 
at Omaha. 
One of only three women in the 49 
member Nebraska Unicameral, Carol’s 
most notable accomplishments include 
protecting and informing victims of 
crime by providing guidance and sup-
port to pass the Crime Victims Bill of 
Rights and the Truth in Sentencing 
bills. 
In 1984 she was the first president of 
the Nebraska Coalition for Victims of 
Crime, an organization that estab-
lished an ongoing statewide coalition 
for victims of crime, and a fund to es-
tablish victim/witness centers in Ne-
braska. 
She also worked to protect home-
owners with legislation that prohibited 
a lien from being placed on a home if 
contractors failed to pay sub-contrac-
tors for their work. 
Carol valued the relationships she 
made while in office and believed most 
representatives were accessible, re-
spectful, and willing to discuss issues. 
In the nonpartisan Nebraska Unicam-
eral, she worked together to find solu-
tions and pass bills that would benefit 
Nebraska statewide. 
Active in her community, she was a 
member of the Omaha Community 
Committee, the Juvenile Court Nomi-
nating Commission, the Mayor’s Com-
mission of the Status of Women, 
Omaha Jaycees, several parent-teacher 
associations, many women’s civic orga-
nizations, and the Centris Federal 
Credit Union Board. She was also in-
volved in the Order of Women Legisla-
tors, the Omaha Area Council on Alco-
holism and Drug Abuse, the YWCA, the 
Omaha Library Board, the Develop-
mental 
Disabilities 
Council, 
the 
Women in Management Association, 
and the Nebraska Coalition for Victims 
of Crime. She did it all. 
Although retired, Carol has encour-
aged many to get involved and feels 
that even if you have retired or are not 
in public service there are many roles 
and ways to serve our community. 
But above all else, Carol believes her 
greatest accomplishment is raising her 
six children alongside her husband 
Allen, whom she married in 1954. They 
all earned bachelor’s degrees and have 
additional education certifications and 
degrees because of the importance 
placed on education in their family. 
Mr. Speaker, I cherish Carol’s friend-
ship and I treasure the wisdom she has 
shared with me and others. I admire 
this wonderful lady, this great Amer-
ican patriot. 
f 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate President 
Biden and the significant accomplish-
ments he shared with us during last 
night’s State of the Union address. 
Last year, together with President 
Biden, we made a promise that Demo-
crats would deliver for the people; and 
that we have. Thanks to our Presi-
dent’s bold leadership and our work in 
Congress, we have been delivering. 
Let’s look at a few areas. 
Jobs, jobs, and more jobs. As was 
mentioned last night by President 
Biden, in his first year, 6.7 million jobs 
were created, marking the strongest 
year of job growth in history. In my 
home State of Texas alone more than 
37,600 manufacturing jobs were created. 
These are good, well-paying jobs that 
are putting Texans back to work. Our 
economy is on the rise. Wages are 
strong. The unemployment rate is low. 
Another area is our Nation’s GDP. 
While GDP dropped 3.4 percent in 2020, 
it was able to shoot up to 5.7 percent in 
2021—the highest rate since 1984. Sim-
ply put, the economy has rebounded 
during President Biden’s first year in 
office. 
Another very important area to all 
our working families is our public 
schools. I am proud of the significant 
progress that has been made in our 
public schools during the President’s 
first year. We have made huge strides 
in reopening our schools and keeping 
them open safely. 
One year ago, Mr. Speaker, merely 46 
percent of schools were open because it 
just wasn’t safe for teachers, students, 
and faculty due to COVID. Today, 99.9 
percent of schools are safely opened. 
The 
Infrastructure 
Investment 
and 
Jobs Act as well as the American Res-
cue Plan both provided schools the nec-
essary funds they needed to stay open 
and make up for lost learning time. 
Another very crucial area, vaccina-
tion rates. One year ago today, only 15 
percent of the U.S. population was 
fully 
vaccinated 
against 
COVID–19, 
today that number is 65 percent. The 
massive increase in vaccinations is the 
direct result of the President and this 
Congress’ leadership to tackle this 
virus. Even today we do not have to 
wear our masks this morning. 
Let’s look ahead. Action from the 
Biden administration and Congress has 
already resulted in significant progress 
on the supply chain challenges. The bi-
partisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will improve and protect sup-
ply chains and reduce reliance on for-
eign oil immensely for years to come. 
It will help lower costs and inflation 
rates with time. As President Biden 
said last night, the plan is to lower 
your costs, not your wages. 
There is a lot more President Biden 
and Democrats are working on in 
building a better America, like invest-
ments in affordable childcare and paid 
and universal pre-K that would allow 
more working families to participate 
in the economy. 
It is those very workers and everyday 
hardworking Americans who deserve 
the greatest praise of all. 
Our hometown heroes have braved 
through this pandemic and powered 
through many challenges. They have 
been the muscle and the backbone of 
our Nation’s record-breaking economic 
growth and recovery from the pan-
demic and we thank them. 
With President Biden’s leadership, 
Congress’ partnership, and the support 
of the American people, there is truly 
no limit as to what we can achieve to-
gether in building a better America. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
tell the people of Ukraine that we 
stand with them. I stand with them. 
‘‘Yes, we can,’’ ‘‘si se puede.’’ I want 
the people of Ukraine to know that we 
see you, we hear you, and we love you. 
And Russia, who has purposely invaded 
your homeland has been—well, I should 
not say the word I really want to say 
on the floor—but they have been inhu-
mane, cruel, and just beyond the pale. 
We will not stand for this. 
We will stand with Ukraine. Again, 
‘‘yes, we can,’’ ‘‘si se puede.’’ We stand 
with you. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO AL GLICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to my good friend, Al 
Glick, who recently passed away at the 
age of 95. Very few have meant as much 
to the Jackson, Michigan, community 
as Al Glick. 
Alro Steel, a company founded nearly 
75 years ago, embodies the hard-
working ethos of his hometown. Over 
the years, under Al’s leadership, the 
company grew to 3,000 employees in 
over a dozen States. Al always exhib-
ited a tireless work ethic but spent the 
time to talk to and to know each of his 
employees. When asked about his re-
tirement, he said: ‘‘I have slowed down 
to working part-time, I only work 12 
hours a day.’’ Even still, he always 
found time to get involved in just 
about every effort under the sun. 
Al supported skilled education pro-
grams, nonprofits, and C.S. Mott Chil-
dren’s Hospital, just to name a few. 
Name a sport and Al likely sponsored a 
team or league in the Jackson area. 
Al’s generosity was felt throughout the 
Jackson 
community, 
often 
taking 
shape through his unwavering support 
of Jackson High School. 
A 
Michigan 
man 
through 
and 
through, Al got to see his beloved Wol-
verines take down Ohio State on a 
snowy day this past November and 
then win the Big Ten Championship. 
Al wasn’t just a staple of the Jackson 
community; he was a steel pillar. 
While we mourn Al’s passing, we cel-
ebrate his remarkable life and the leg-
acy that will live on for generations to 
come. We wish his family great joy in 
that legacy and thank them for sharing 
Al with us.

March 2, 2022 
RECOGNIZING SHELTON JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an amazing Califor-
nian, Mr. Shelton Johnson. I commend 
his contributions to the National Park 
Service and his dedication to telling 
the stories of our history that often go 
untold. 
Mr. JOHNSON has worked as a park 
ranger for over 35 years. In that time, 
he has enthusiastically recounted the 
special contributions of Black Ameri-
cans to preserving Yosemite’s wilder-
ness. The all-Black 9th and 10th Cal-
vary Regiments, known as the Buffalo 
Soldiers, were among the first park 
rangers, even before the founding of 
the National Park system. 
I am inspired by Mr. JOHNSON’s cre-
ativity and commitment to sharing our 
diverse history. Mr. JOHNSON was re-
cently awarded the American Park Ex-
perience Award for his lifelong efforts 
in helping more families and youth feel 
welcome as they see their stories told. 
As a fellow teacher and mom to three 
enthusiastic, park-loving kids, I am 
honored to recognize him today. 
COMPETITION IN CAPITALISM 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, a strong 
capitalist economy requires competi-
tion. Weak antitrust enforcement has 
atrophied the bones of our economy. 
When our economy lacks competition, 
we see prices go up, wages drop, and in-
novation stall. 
Last year, my office released a report 
detailing how Big Pharma’s market 
consolidation creates real harms for 
families. Too many Americans can’t af-
ford lifesaving prescription drugs be-
cause Big Pharma buys out its com-
petitors so that it can continue its cor-
porate abuse. 
We have also seen how Big Tech’s 
market 
consolidation 
reduces 
con-
sumer choice, stifles competition, and 
harms small businesses. 
Competition is central to healthy 
capitalism. Reining in corporate greed, 
holding big businesses accountable, and 
cracking down on monopolies will 
strengthen our economy. 
Congress must tackle market con-
solidation to create a level playing 
field for all businesses and to strength-
en our capitalist economy. 
f 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, last night 
President Biden tried to paint his ad-
ministration in a positive light during 
the State of the Union address, but the 
American people know better. 
We are facing an unprecedented num-
ber of crises: an economic crisis, a bor-
der crisis, a crime crisis, an energy cri-
sis, and an unprecedented national se-
curity crisis. Every one of these crises 
have been either created or made worse 
by President Biden and congressional 
Democrats. 
Simply put, Democrats own these 
crises, but I am sure—and we did see— 
an attempt by President Biden to dress 
up these disasters and highlight vic-
tories that simply don’t exist. 
While President Biden tries to take 
credit for accomplishments he had no 
responsibility in delivering, House Re-
publicans remain committed to show-
casing to the American people what we 
stand for: unleashing American energy 
independence, peace through strength, 
respecting the Constitution, putting 
power back in the hands of parents, 
lowering taxes, balancing budgets, and 
securing our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, if given the oppor-
tunity, Republicans will lead on these 
issues, and I look forward to delivering 
on the day that that happens. 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my support to the people of 
Ukraine. All Americans stand in soli-
darity against Russian aggression, and 
we pray for peace. 
However, as the conflict escalates 
and we call for not one more drop of 
Russian oil to be imported into this 
Nation, the United States must make 
energy independence a priority. 
Prior to the invasion, gas here at 
home was already 40 percent higher 
than it was 12 months ago, marking an 
8-year high. Now, as the world sanc-
tions Russia, prices are climbing yet 
again, and experts predict Americans 
could soon be paying more than $5 for 
a gallon of gas. 
In response, the President announced 
that he is releasing 30 million barrels 
from the U.S. strategic oil reserves. It 
sounds 
great, 
but 
considering 
the 
United States uses more than 20 mil-
lion barrels a day, this is nothing more 
than a gimmick. A day-and-a-half 
worth of oil is not going to reduce 
costs for American businesses, work-
ers, and families in my district. 
There must be a comprehensive plan 
that leads us back to the energy inde-
pendence we enjoyed during the Trump 
administration, and it starts with lift-
ing the President’s moratorium on new 
oil and gas drilling on public lands, ex-
ploring in ANWR and off our coasts, 
and finishing the Keystone XL pipe-
line.

RECOGNIZING THE CAVE SPRING CHEERLEADING 
TEAM 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the student athletes on 
the 
Cave 
Spring 
High 
School 
cheerleading team in Roanoke, Vir-
ginia, for winning its division’s State 
championship toward the end of last 
year. The Knights cheerleading squad 
is often referred to as a dynasty, and 
this victory marks the team’s fourth 
State title in 9 years—and in those 
other 5 years they placed second each 
time. 
The team had to overcome several 
obstacles this season, but through it 
all they persevered. Cave Spring senior 
cheerleader, Abby Holbrook, said it 
best when she said: ‘‘We work so hard 
during the season, and it feels like all 
the hard work is paying off.’’ 
Yes, Abby’s hard work certainly did 
pay off. With the graduating class of 
2022 having won the title their fresh-
man and senior years, they are proud 
of the legacy they leave behind, and 
rightly so. 
Congratulations to Cave Spring on 
this accomplishment, and I wish them 
the best of luck again next season. 
f 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I am honored 
to follow my friend from Virginia (Mr. 
CLINE). 
Mr. Speaker, last night when we 
heard the President of the United 
States address this Nation and this 
body in this Chamber as well as our 
colleagues on the other side of the Cap-
itol in the Senate, you would think 
there was some sort of magic moment 
that the virus has suddenly left the 
Earth and now all of a sudden we are 
free here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives to be without masks. 
It was just coincidentally timed— 
just coincidentally timed—when the 
State of the Union is upon us. A num-
ber of States have lifted their man-
dates—all 
suddenly 
coincidentally 
timed—around the State of the Union. 
And I was interested in watching the 
Speaker of the House suddenly saying: 
Well, it is a new moment in COVID. 
I listened to my colleagues from 
Texas just a moment ago on the other 
side of the aisle talking about how we 
have had this great victory through 
the action of the genius of our Federal 
Government to free us from the perils 
of this virus. 
Mr. Speaker, tell that to the children 
who have been sitting in the corners of 
classrooms wearing masks. Tell that to 
the members of our military and the 
members of our Border Patrol who are 
the so-called heroes. I say so-called be-
cause my Democratic colleagues a year 
ago were calling healthcare workers 
heroes, and now they are forcing them 
still to lose their job if they don’t take 
a jab because of the wisdom of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that they know best. They know best. 
The President stood there arrogantly 
in that posture preaching to the United 
States public and to this body yester-
day and talked about how we are going 
to beat this virus and oh, by the way, 
suddenly magically we need to fund the 
police. Go back and look at every 
statement that has been made by my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
over the last 2 years talking about 
defunding the police. We know who is 
defunding the police across the coun-
try, and it sure as heck isn’t Repub-
licans. It is Democrats across this 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1215 
March 2, 2022 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle know it. The President knows 
it, and the President is reading polls. 
The President knows that the approach 
to the virus has been devastating to 
the American people. Lockdowns, mask 
mandates, and vaccine mandates are 
being rejected by the American people. 
The polls show it, so the magic mo-
ment has then arrived. 
The President of the United States 
knows full well when he says the bor-
der should be secured that it is a lie. I 
just want to be very clear: when the 
President said last night that the bor-
der should be secure, it is a lie. He is 
lying to the American people. 
I was in Del Rio just last week. One 
thousand people a day are coming 
across that river, and nobody gives a 
whit. And they don’t give a whit about 
the 26 migrants who have died in the 
Rio Grande since October 1, since the 
cameras have left the Haitians sitting 
on the Rio Grande. They don’t care 
that there are 26 dead migrants. They 
don’t care about the 119 bodies in 
Brooks County where the sheriff has to 
bring a body trailer to Brooks County. 
They don’t care about the fences get-
ting cut and the livestock getting out. 
The ranchers I met with last week in 
south Texas are in tears about their 
property. No. No. The President gets 
up, gives a speech, and declares the 
border secure and all is well. 
Then he gets up and talks about the 
solidarity of the Ukrainian people, yet 
he refuses to unleash American oil and 
gas and refuses to unleash natural gas, 
liquified 
natural 
gas, 
that 
would 
change the world. He refuses to stop 
importing 600,000 barrels of Russian oil 
every single day because we won’t un-
leash American oil and gas. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, we are going to 
keep telling the truth about the bor-
der. We are going to keep telling the 
truth about vaccine mandates. We are 
going to keep telling the truth about 
the need for American energy. We are 
not going to bow down to the climate 
hysterics and the false lies about bor-
der security that are endangering the 
American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
THE RETIREMENT OF ROB GREEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to salute a dedicated public servant 
and friend. After working for a series of 
Members of the House, including Rep-
resentative Bill Goodling, Rob Green 
first served the Education and Work-
force Committee from 1995 to 2001. Rob 
rejoined the committee 4 years ago and 
was an invaluable leader of the GOP 
workforce team until his recent retire-
ment. 
As director of workforce policy, Rob 
worked tirelessly to protect the rights 
of workers and employers alike. He has 
dedicated years of his life to fighting 
for free market principles and to seeing 
that our country stays a self-governed 
republic. Whether we have been in the 
majority or in the minority, Rob has 
made addressing Federal overreach a 
top priority and has never been afraid 
to hold Federal agencies accountable. 
Rob’s consummate professionalism 
when working with Members of Con-
gress as well as Democrat staff allowed 
us to pass bipartisan bills such as the 
Retirement Improvement and Savings 
Enhancement Act, RISE, which will 
help many Americans prepare for a 
more secure future. 
Rob’s work was also pivotal in help-
ing us pass a ban on surprise billing. 
This fight for transparency in our med-
ical system has been a passion of Rob’s 
and will help millions of struggling 
Americans. 
Rob’s influence extended way beyond 
the committee. GOP leadership also re-
lied on Rob to shape policy in the labor 
arena, ensuring that the American 
worker’s voice gets heard. His relation-
ship with lawmakers and staff through-
out the House allowed the committee 
to flourish and accomplish a tremen-
dous amount. 
Too often populist lobbies have an 
out-sized influence over politics in 
Washington. Rob’s work on this com-
mittee ensured that the voices of job 
creators and small business owners 
were heard. 
This is a difficult day for me as I re-
lied on Rob’s expertise and keen eye for 
strategy to further this committee’s 
mission. Thankfully, his expertise will 
live on in the team that he has led and 
mentored for 4 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Rob for his 
many accomplishments and for his 
selfless service to this country. It is be-
cause of dedicated public servants like 
Rob standing in the gap and defending 
our Republic that we have a chance at 
reclaiming the vision our Founding Fa-
thers had for this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I truly congratulate 
Rob on his retirement. He has earned 
it. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S NATIONAL 
SECURITY CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address President Biden’s national 
security crisis and to express my sup-
port for the people of Ukraine as they 
fight for their lives and their sov-
ereignty. 
An American ally is under attack, 
and they need our support. Sanctioning 
the Russian economy is not enough. 
The Ukrainian Government has re-
quested more lethal aid for many 
months, and we must deliver it without 
further delay. We must also end our 
purchases of nearly 538,000 barrels of 
Russian oil each day and return to 
where we were just a short year ago by 
making America energy independent 
again. 
After 4 years of peace and prosperity, 
it only took President Biden 400 days 
to unravel it all. President Biden’s 
weakness on the world stage has 
emboldened our enemies and created a 
vacuum that Vladimir Putin is de-
lighted to fill. 
President Biden has demonstrated 
the inability to lead, whether it be the 
botched Afghanistan withdrawal or the 
invasion that is happening at our own 
Southern border. I can’t help but think 
about what might come next as Iran 
strives to produce nuclear weapons and 
China may look toward Taiwan and 
mimic Russia. The world was a much 
safer place a little over a year ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with President Zelensky and the people 
of Ukraine who are courageously fight-
ing 
against 
power-hungry 
dictator 
Vladimir Putin. 
So much tragedy and loss could have 
been avoided in Ukraine if we had any 
real leadership in the White House. 
Surely evil triumphs when good men do 
nothing. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JIM LANCASTER 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to cel-
ebrate the life of my friend, cousin, and 
lifelong Tennessean, Jim Lancaster. He 
passed away on February 3 after a re-
markable 92 years on God’s Earth. 
Jim loved the Lord and cherished his 
family with all his heart. He and 
Vondell, the love of his life, were mar-
ried for 67 years. Together they had 
five 
children, 
12 
grandchildren, 
18 
great-grandchildren, and two great- 
great-grandchildren. Obviously, Jim’s 
and Vondell’s loving marriage and de-
votion to family led to a lot of little 
Lancasters running around middle Ten-
nessee. 
Jim was a joyful role model, and so 
many people in his community knew 
Jim in that way. He served as a leader 
in many local organizations including 
the chamber of commerce, the Boy 
Scouts, and too many to name here 
today. He received loads of awards for 
his service over the years, but he was a 
humble man who wasn’t in it for rec-
ognition. He just loved serving his 
community and the people in it. 
He also dedicated much of his life to 
agriculture. He graduated from Ten-
nessee Tech, my alma mater, with a de-
gree in agriculture, and then worked 
for the Wilson County Farm Bureau as 
its agency manager for over 43 years. 
In fact, he is now a member of the Wil-
son County Agricultural Hall of Fame 
in recognition of his exemplary work 
for local farmers throughout his distin-
guished career. 
I was blessed to call Jim family. It is 
bittersweet. It is a bittersweet moment 
for me now to say he is gone to be with 
our Lord. 
Thank you, Jim Lancaster, for a life 
well-lived that touched so many in 
such a positive way.

March 2, 2022 
THON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor, 
thank, and express my sincerest grati-
tude for an incredible group of students 
at the Pennsylvania State University— 
Penn State. 
On February 18 at 4 p.m., Penn State 
students, staff, family, friends, volun-
teers, and spectators filled the Bryce 
Jordan Center for the 50th Penn State 
IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, more 
widely known as THON, to raise money 
for the Four Diamonds Foundation. 
Since 1973, student volunteers have 
come together at Penn State to raise 
money for the Penn State Health Chil-
dren’s 
Hospital. 
In 
1977, 
THON 
partnered with the Four Diamonds 
Foundation, and since then not a single 
Four Diamonds family has received a 
medical bill thanks to the tireless 
work and dedication of Penn State stu-
dents. 
The Four Diamonds was founded by 
Charles and Irma Millard in 1972 after 
their son, Christopher, lost his battle 
with cancer at age 11. Before Chris-
topher passed away, he wrote a story 
about a great knight who sought out 
the four diamonds of courage, wisdom, 
honesty, and strength to be saved from 
an evil sorceress. His parents realized 
those four qualities were all necessary 
to overcome cancer, and they created 
the Four Diamonds Fund in his mem-
ory. 
Mr. Millard passed away in November 
of 2021 at the age of 93, but his legacy 
through THON and his foundation will 
no doubt live on forever. 
Over the past 50 years, THON has 
grown into the largest student-run phi-
lanthropy in the world. In the first 
year, 78 students danced for 30 hours 
straight and raised just over $2,000. 
Today, THON is a 46-hour no sitting, no 
sleeping dance marathon celebrating 
nearly 17,000 students’ yearlong fund-
raising efforts to help end childhood 
cancer. 
Thankfully, after a virtual event last 
year, 667 dancers and tens of thousands 
of student volunteers and supporters 
attended the event in-person. Students 
stood from 6 p.m. on Friday, February 
18, until 4 p.m. on Sunday, February 20. 
While it was an impressive feat to hold, 
what is even more incredible is the 
drive, fortitude, and flexibility these 
students showed in their commitment 
to this cause. 
This past year, the pandemic prohib-
ited students from hosting many of 
their traditional bake sales, ribbon 
sales, or other fundraisers that Penn-
sylvanians have been accustomed to 
seeing throughout the Commonwealth. 
Despite this, THON shattered previous 
fundraising records by bringing in 
more than $13.7 million for the kids. 
b 1045 
Over the last 50 years, THON has now 
donated more than $200 million to Four 
Diamonds Fund, undoubtedly saving 
hundreds of lives. 
While it is no easy feat to stand for 
46 hours, the real highlight of this 
event comes on Sunday afternoon, 
shortly before the event concludes. 
During what is known as Family Hour, 
THON invites Four Diamonds families 
onto the stage to share their experi-
ences with the Children’s Hospital, 
Four Diamonds, and THON. 
This year, Jacquie Homan shared the 
story of how her son was diagnosed 
with synovial cell sarcoma at age 2. 
Thanks to Penn State Children’s Hos-
pital, Declan is officially 5 years can-
cer-free, and Jacquie said that the sup-
port from the THON community had an 
immeasurable impact on helping their 
family cope with and move forward 
from this diagnosis. 
I am inspired by Declan and every 
other child and family who find them-
selves battling cancer and am in awe of 
their strength and their spirit as they 
keep fighting. 
I am also proud of the Penn State 
students who continue to be so com-
mitted to this cause. And I am incred-
ibly proud of the work done by the 
Four Diamonds Foundation and Penn 
State Children’s Hospital as they con-
duct lifesaving research and ensure no 
family ever receives a bill. 
Congratulations, once again, to ev-
eryone involved in this year’s THON.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, we return to You this day. 
With our whole hearts, we approach 
You. 
On this day, some fast that they 
would satisfy their hunger only with 
Your word. Others weep, ashamed of 
the choices they have made which have 
distanced themselves from You. And 
still more mourn, grieving the loss of 
Your loving embrace. 
Be merciful to us, O God. Be slow to 
anger. Show us Your grace that we 
would enjoy again Your steadfast love. 
Then spare Your people. Let no one 
say, ‘‘Where is our God?’’ Have pity on 
those who cry out to You this day. 
Remove the enemies from those who 
call on Your name and walk in Your 
way. May Your children no longer fear. 
In Your redemption, may they once 
again find reason to rejoice. 
Praise be to you, O Lord our God. 
You are in the midst of us. We call 
upon Your most holy name. Hear our 
prayer. 
Amen.

TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST 
CANCER AWARENESS DAY 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, six 
years ago this month, I heard the 
phrase triple-negative breast cancer for 
the first time in my life. I was in the 
oncologist’s office with my newly diag-
nosed 29-year-old daughter, Lauren, a 
day forever etched in my memory. 
In the weeks that followed, I learned 
a great deal about this very aggressive, 
rare form of breast cancer. Roughly 12 
percent of breast cancer survivors are 
designated as triple-negative. 
It is the only form of breast cancer 
that doesn’t respond to hormone ther-
apy, often requiring chemotherapy in-
stead. And it claims the lives of thou-
sands of women and men each year. It 
stole Lauren from our family in August 
of 2017. 
Tomorrow, March 3, is Triple-Nega-
tive Breast Cancer Awareness Day. I 
am humbled to sponsor a resolution to 
call attention to this awful disease and 
to let the thousands of victims of tri-
ple-negative breast cancer know they 
are not alone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1217 
March 2, 2022 
AN ANXIOUS WORLD 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the State of the Union last 
night was a disconnect from the reality 
of Biden failures. The Wall Street Jour-
nal is correct. He missed the moment. 
The paper went further to describe 
what Biden did not say: More defense 
spending to meet the threats from 
autocrats? No. A new appreciation of 
the contribution of fossil fuels to 
American and European security? Not 
a word. A note that government spend-
ing contributed to the highest inflation 
rate in 40 years? Nope. 
I personally was disappointed that 
there was no mention of leaving Ameri-
cans behind in Afghanistan, 13 patriots 
murdered in Kabul. And now Afghani-
stan is a safe haven for terrorists who 
can come across the open border to at-
tack American families. 
An anxious world is looking for 
American leadership in a dangerous 
new era. I hope the President will 
change 
course 
for 
peace 
through 
strength. 
In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. 
God save Ukraine. Long live President 
Volodymyr Zelensky. 
f 
AMERICA’S EXCELLENCE IN 
SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, last night 
we heard the President of the United 
States speak with great enthusiasm 
about our friendship with the people of 
Ukraine and how we have shared values 
in terms of democracy, in terms of sov-
ereignty, and in terms of not having 
someone come into their country and 
usurp their freedom. 
President Biden also spoke about 
America’s freedom in the world in 
terms of our independence in terms of 
our own investments in our economic 
future. America’s excellence in science 
and engineering has long been the envy 
of the world. Along the way other 
countries have copied our model, in-
vesting in education and research and 
took over some of the manufacturing 
of our supply. 
We have, what was referenced by the 
President last night, legislation, we 
call it the America COMPETES Act in 
the House of Representatives. It is a 
blueprint for our independence and our 
self-sufficiency economically in the 
world. 
With the House-passed America COM-
PETES Act we do three things. First of 
all, we invest in chips, $52 billion in 
chips and semiconductors. Do you 
know how many chips are in a car? 
There are 1,000; and in an electric car, 
2,000. In order for our auto manufactur-
ers to continue to create jobs and cre-
ate products, we need chips. $52 billion. 
Secondly, we reinvigorate our manu-
facturing base by addressing the supply 
chain issues. Supply chain increases 
supply, reducing costs, lowing infla-
tion. This is very important. There is 
$48 billion invested there. 
Third, we invest in research and edu-
cation into stem cell so we can diver-
sify the workforce to include many 
more people, everyone in our country, 
as we advance science and technology 
and good-paying jobs for the future. 
Again, we are prepared to go into 
conference with the Senate on this leg-
islation. We are always ready to fight 
for the people. We expect to have this 
legislation before too long, and when 
we do so we will be lowering costs, in-
creasing paychecks, and doing so for 
the people. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR. 
RAY FARLEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of the 
life of Dr. Ray Farley, the former presi-
dent of Young Harris College. 
Dr. Farley was a long-time supporter 
of Young Harris College, with 35 years 
of dedicated service to Young Harris 
under his belt. 
Beginning as a professor of history in 
1955, Dr. Farley worked with the col-
lege until his retirement in 1991, after 
serving as the college president for 20 
years. For some of those years I was a 
student at Young Harris College while 
Dr. Farley was the president. I got to 
know him well. He was a fine gen-
tleman and did an excellent job. 
During his tenure as president, Dr. 
Farley made it his mission to mod-
ernize and expand the services and fa-
cilities at Young Harris. He was re-
sponsible for taking important steps to 
strengthen the college endowment, fac-
ulty, curriculum, and facilities. 
Dr. Farley implemented his plan for 
helping to beautify the campus as well 
by renovating dining facilities, resi-
dent halls, and administrative build-
ings. The years with Dr. Farley at the 
helm were integral to the growth and 
development of the college itself. 
In April of 2021, Dr. Farley was 
awarded the Outstanding Friend Award 
by the Young Harris College Alumni 
Association for his incredible dedica-
tion and service to the college. His leg-
acy and impact will be felt for many 
years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences 
to his family and friends as well as the

RUSSIA’S ASSAULT ON UKRAINE 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, Russia’s as-
sault on Ukrainian freedom and democ-
racy is an assault on freedom and de-
mocracy everywhere. That is why 
America and our allies are linking 
arms and engaging in unprecedented 
cooperation. President Biden has mar-
shalled the world to impose severe con-
sequences on Putin and the Russian 
economy. 
Because of these crippling sanctions, 
Russia now stands at the precipice of a 
punishing financial crisis. American 
troops, many from Fort Bragg and else-
where in North Carolina, are already in 
NATO countries in Eastern Europe, 
and more are on their way. 
The international community is also 
sending support to countries neigh-
boring Ukraine, including North Caro-
lina’s close partner, Moldova. As we 
continue to work on a robust new aid 
package, the prayers and admiration of 
the people of my district are with the 
brave Ukrainian freedom fighters risk-
ing their lives to defend their home-
land.

AMERICA FIRST MEANS POWER 
UNDER CONTROL 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, when 
the United States military shows up, 
kings and kingdoms fall to their knees. 
As the great philosopher Toby Keith 
once said, ‘‘We put a boot in their ass, 
it’s the American way.’’ Our military 
preeminence is unmatched, our brand 
is dominance. But our greatness lies in 
temperance. 
America 
first 
means 
power under control. 
Overzealous 
executives 
have 
wrenched away a precious power be-
stowed on this body. I am here to re-
mind them: Congress declares war, not 
Joe Biden, not some woke general. 
Congress, the people, must debate, de-
cide, and then, if absolutely necessary, 
declare war. 
The Constitution is our compass, not 
the feelings of some bought-off mili-
tary-industrial complex war hawk who 
uses emotion to justify America’s 
entry into every overseas conflict. Con-
gress must reclaim our power to de-
clare war, and if we do declare, we 
must define what victory looks like. 
The sons and daughters of America are 
too precious to waste on the altar of 
globalism. 
America first, always and forever.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND OUR 
ELDERLY 
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, more than 900,000 people in 
the United States have lost their lives 
due to COVID. Of those more than 
900,000, 660,000 people over age 65 have 
been lost because of COVID. This is the 
same population that was not only 
worried and concerned about COVID, 
but they are the ones on a fixed in-
come. They are the ones that rely on 
Social Security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1218 
March 2, 2022 
More than 5 million of our fellow 
Americans get a below-poverty-level 
check from Social Security after hav-
ing paid in all their lives to the number 
one insurance program in the country, 
the number one anti-poverty program 
for the elderly, and the number one 
anti-poverty 
program 
for 
children. 
Help is on the way. 
Social Security 2100, a sacred trust, 
as the President called it, is a bill that 
will uplift and raise people out of the 
depths of poverty and provide them 
with the sustenance they need in their 
daily lives, as Roosevelt intended.

RUSSIA’S ASSAULT ON UKRAINE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak in strong support 
of the people of Ukraine and against 
the thuggish, criminal, and careless ac-
tions of the Russian military and 
President Putin. 
Last week’s invasion of Ukraine by 
Russia was planned and premeditated. 
It was, and still is, a blatant act of war 
and cannot be tolerated by the inter-
national community. Putin’s actions 
have been those of a desperate politi-
cian creating chaos in neighboring 
countries due to low popularity at 
home. 
As we have seen on the news and so-
cial media, the Russian military is 
making no distinction between mili-
tary and civilian, launching missiles 
blindly 
into 
Ukrainian 
cities 
and 
towns. 
With their backs against the wall, 
the people of Ukraine have shown the 
world that they will fight to defend 
their friends, family, homes, and coun-
try. We must support them and the 
democratically-elected Ukrainian Gov-
ernment. 
The current sanctions that the ad-
ministration has levied against Russia, 
Putin, and his cronies are welcome, but 
we clearly need to go further. We must 
aggressively hurt the Russian economy 
by cutting off their energy exports and 
halt the purchasing of Russian gas and 
oil by the United States. We should 
also unleash American energy, includ-
ing biofuels, natural gas, and wind, to 
help our allies move away from Rus-
sian energy reliance. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
to 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine, we are with you today, to-
morrow, and always.

INVESTMENTS IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, as 
we heard last night in the President’s 
State of the Union, the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act is a once-in-a- 
lifetime investment in our Nation’s 
economic foundation and our Nation’s 
competitiveness. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act makes it possible for us to in-
vest in passenger rail expansion and 
restoration; rebuild our roads, our 
bridges, our water systems, and our 
sewer 
systems; 
reclaim 
abandoned 
mine lands and reduce pollution; and so 
much more. It is the solution to im-
proving our competitiveness on the 
world stage and recovering from the 
devastating COVID–19 pandemic. 
After years of talking about passing 
an infrastructure bill and week after 
week of infrastructure weeks, we have 
finally done it. We will begin seeing 
the benefits quite soon. 
Thank God for the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act. 
f 
HONORING HUNTINGTON BEACH 
POLICE OFFICER NICHOLAS VELLA 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Huntington Beach Po-
lice Officer Nicholas Vella who was 
tragically killed in a crash while re-
sponding to a call in Newport Beach on 
February 19. 
Officer Vella served as a law enforce-
ment officer for 18 years and spent 14 
years with the Huntington Beach Po-
lice Department. He dedicated his life 
to protecting our community. My 
heart goes out to his wife and daugh-
ter, the Huntington Beach Police De-
partment, and all who loved and knew 
Officer Vella. 
I am so thankful every day for our 
brave law enforcement officers. They 
put their lives on the line for us, and I 
am so grateful for their service and 
sacrifice. I want to thank their fami-
lies, too, because their sacrifice does 
not go unnoticed. 
I will be praying for Officer Vella and 
his family.

SUPPLY CHAINS 
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
BLUNT 
ROCHESTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
bipartisan supply chain subtitle found 
in the House-passed America COM-
PETES Act. 
We have all heard from our constitu-
ents over the last several months about 
the impact that inflation has had on 
households and businesses. We also 
know that a key reason for rising 
prices on critical goods is our supply 
chain instability. The supply chain 
subtitle in the America COMPETES 
Act will strengthen our supply chains 
and ultimately tackle a root cause of 
inflation. 
It is vital that this subtitle is pre-
served through the negotiations of the 
America COMPETES Act as we build a 
better America. This is about creating 
good-paying union jobs, protecting our 
national security, and, ultimately, pro-
tecting the pocketbooks of the Amer-
ican people. Let’s get it done.

ACKNOWLEDGING 
PENNSYLVANIA 
STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT 
ERIC BARRON 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowl-
edge the distinguished career of Penn 
State University President Eric Bar-
ron. 
President Barron assumed office in 
2014 after leaving his post as president 
at the Florida State University. But 
his service to the university began 
when Dr. Barron served as dean of the 
College of Earth and Minerals Sciences 
and founding director of the Earth Sys-
tem Science Center in Penn State. 
In his tenure as president of Penn 
State University, President Barron ele-
vated Penn State as a leader in higher 
education. President Barron has also 
worked to support State funding, in-
crease access and affordability to stu-
dents through scholarship programs, 
and prepare students graduating from 
Penn State for success after college. 
In my time working with President 
Barron, he has always made it a point 
to meet with the Pennsylvania Con-
gressional Delegation regularly and 
share Penn State’s vision, work, and 
culture. He took the time to build 
meaningful relationships which ulti-
mately benefited the university and 
the Commonwealth as a whole. I am 
happy to call him my friend and wish 
him well in his retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, Penn State remains one 
of the top institutions in the country 
in part because of the work of Presi-
dent Barron. He leaves a great legacy 
behind. 
I thank President Barron for his 
service, and I wish him joy in his re-
tirement.

WOMEN’S RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I am frus-
trated. We have heard a lot this week 
about cutting workers in on the deal 
and how we meet the challenges that 
this Nation is facing. 
Every piece of the game plan—wheth-
er it is helping take on China; how do 
we bring jobs back to places like Ohio; 
how do we increase union membership 
by making it easier to join a union; 
how do we bring down costs; and how 
do we cut taxes for workers in the 
midst of all of this inflation—every one 
of those bills has gone to the Senate 
and either died or is on life support. 
Here is one example of just how bro-
ken this is: Last year, we made history

when we passed the Women’s Health 
Protection Act—and not a moment too 
soon as Roe v. Wade hangs in the bal-
ance and States like Ohio race to pass 
new laws to ban abortion. This is a 
basic right, a matter of settled law. 
But this week the Senate blocked the 
vote—blocked it—and we didn’t even 
get a vote. 
It is time to get rid of the filibuster 
and make sure that the bills we send 
here from the House actually get

CARING FOR OUR VETERANS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 3967, the Hon-
oring our PACT Act, which will ensure 
comprehensive benefits and care for 
our troops who suffer from toxic expo-
sure, especially from burn pits. I want 
to thank Chairman TAKANO
for his 
leadership on this bill. It is something 
we should all support. It supports our 
veterans. 
As the daughter of a veteran, the sis-
ter of a veteran, and the wife of a vet-
eran, caring for our veterans is ex-
tremely important to me, as it should 
be to every American. I could not help 
but be struck by the similarities be-
tween this bill and the 9/11 health and 
compensation bill which served and 
supported our heroes and heroines of 9/ 
11 who likewise were exposed to burn-
ing toxins that later gave them cancers 
and severe illness. 
This bill could help over 3 million 
veterans who are currently suffering 
from exposure to toxic burn pits. 
Whether a veteran has served in Af-
ghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, if they 
were exposed to these toxic hazards, 
they are entitled to care. They were 
there for us; we should be there for 
them. We should all support this im-
portant bill.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2748 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I seek

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
YARMUTH). The gentleman’s request is 
approved.

HONORING OUR PROMISE TO AD-
DRESS COMPREHENSIVE TOXICS 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 950, I call up the

and benefits for veterans exposed to 
toxic substances, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

FACTORS.—The 
Secretary shall ensure that each formal evalua-
tion under paragraph (1) covers the following: 
‘‘(1) Scientific evidence, based on the review of

ies, and other factors. 
‘‘(2) Claims data, based on the review of claim 
rate, grant rate, and service connection preva-
lence, and other factors. 
‘‘(3) Other factors the Secretary determines 
appropriate, such as— 
‘‘(A) the level of disability and mortality 
caused by the health effects related to the case 
of toxic exposure being evaluated; 
‘‘(B) the level of assistance required to remain 
in the community because of such health effects; 
‘‘(C) the quantity and quality of the informa-
tion available and reviewed;

scientific or technological findings, data, infor-
mation, conclusions, or technical results; and 
‘‘(B)(i) evaluates the likelihood that a positive 
association exists between an illness and a toxic 
exposure while serving in the active military, 
naval, air, or space service; and 
‘‘(ii) assesses the toxic exposures and illnesses 
and determines whether the evidence supports a 
finding of a positive association between the 
toxic exposure and the illness. 
‘‘(2) In carrying out paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a 
formal evaluation under subsection (a) shall in-
clude reviewing all relevant data to determine 
the strength of evidence for a positive associa-
tion based on the following four categories: 
‘‘(A) The ‘sufficient’ category, where the evi-
dence is sufficient to conclude that a positive 
association exists. 
‘‘(B) The ‘equipoise and above’ category, 
where the evidence is sufficient to conclude that 
a positive association is at least as likely as not, 
but not sufficient to conclude that a positive as-
sociation exists. 
‘‘(C) The ‘below equipoise’ category, where 
the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that a 
positive association is at least as likely as not, 
or is not sufficient to make a scientifically in-
formed judgment. 
‘‘(D) The ‘against’ category, where the evi-
dence suggests the lack of a positive association. 
‘‘(d) RECOMMENDATION
FOR
RULEMAKING.— 
Not later than 120 days after the date on which 
a formal evaluation is commenced, the element 
of the Department that conducts the evaluation 
shall submit to the Secretary a recommendation

consider any record of the claimant in an expo-
sure tracking record system pursuant to section 
1119 of such title, as added by section 302, but 
a lack of such information is not by itself suffi-
cient to determine that such exposure did not 
occur or sufficient to deny the claim.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
3967, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3967, as amended, the Honoring 
our PACT Act of 2021. 
When we sent our servicemembers 
into harm’s way, we made a pact to 
care for them when they came home. 
But for too long, Congress and the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs have been 
slow to accept responsibility and cost 
of that care, citing high costs or lack 
of absolute, scientific proof of illness 
connections to service. The result is a 
disability claims process that is cum-
bersome and places the burden of proof 
for toxic exposure on veterans them-
selves. 
Every day more and more veterans 
speak out about exposure to environ-
mental hazards and other toxic sub-
stances during their military service. 
Recently, I put out a call encour-
aging toxic exposed veterans to share 
their experiences with the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. We heard 
from thousands of veterans in 49 
States. These reflections are very pow-
erful, Mr. Speaker, and I would like to 
share some of them with you now. 
Navy veteran Ed described how toxic 
exposures overwhelmed his senses. He 
wrote: ‘‘You could not escape the jet 
fuel. You could see it, smell it, and 
taste it.’’ 
I heard from Marine veteran Mike 
who said: ‘‘Even when we weren’t ac-
tively engaged in dumping items into 
the burn pit, we were still exposed.’’ 
Air Force veteran Christopher R. de-
scribed his dealings with VA stating: ‘‘I 
continue to be rejected because they 
say that it is impossible to prove that 
it is service related. I never worked 
with chemicals before my service or 
since. I feel like a nuisance to the VA 
health system.’’ 
I heard from a widow of Army vet-
eran Austin Monk who said: ‘‘No wife 
should have to bury her 22-year-old 
husband because of his exposure to un-
safe conditions while in service to his 
country.’’ 
b 1230 
These stories are heart-wrenching 
and frustrating. Our veterans are fight-
ing their own government to grant 
them the care and benefits they have 
earned. 
We should be outraged listening to 
these stories, and it should be clear 
how urgent passing the Honoring our 
PACT Act is for our veterans. Veterans 
and 
veterans 
service 
organizations 
agree. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support from more than 42 
veterans service organizations. 
FEBRUARY 24, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, 
House of Representatives. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the American 
service members and veterans we represent, 
the undersigned representatives of our re-
spective Veterans and Military Service Orga-
nizations call on the House to expeditiously 
consider and pass into law the Honoring Our 
PACT Act (H.R. 3967). 
Throughout our history, and most recently 
over the course of more than 20 years of war 
in the post-9/11 era, service members and vet-
erans suffered prolonged exposure to dan-
gerous toxic substances, such as burn pits 
that destroyed trash, medical and human 
waste, chemicals, and fuel, in and around the 
battlefields of Iraq, Afghanistan and other 
places. Of the hundreds of thousands of our 
members who have suffered these exposures, 
many have returned home sick (or would be-
come ill), and many have also died of their 
injuries. 
Collectively, we have spent years edu-
cating Congress, national leaders, and the 
public on the enormous scope of the injuries 
faced by our community. There have been 
small-scale measures to boost education, 
training, research, and outreach to begin to 
address the problem. Over the last several 
years, many of our organizations have 
worked together to assemble the components 
of comprehensive toxic exposure legislation 
that provides VA health care, a new process 
to determine future presumptive conditions, 
and provide overdue disability benefits to 
thousands of veterans from all wars and eras 
suffering from toxic exposures. 
There have been a number of bills intro-
duced in the House that address different as-
pects of the toxic exposures puzzle, however 
the Honoring Our PACT Act is the only bill 
that provides a truly comprehensive solu-
tion. Although many of us have supported 
some of these other burn pits and toxic expo-
sure bills, none of them provides a complete 
and lasting solution for veterans who are or 
may become ill as a result of toxic expo-
sures. Consequently, when the Honoring Our 
PACT Act is brought to the floor for consid-
eration, if any such legislation is offered as 
an amendment or motion to restrict or sub-
stitute, rather than supplement, the under-
lying bill, we would urge all members to op-
pose such amendments or motions. 
Our organizations call on the House to pass 
the Honoring Our PACT Act without further 
delay, to finally provide those who have laid 
their lives on the line for all Americans with 
the health care and benefits they need and 
deserve.

themselves, I am confident that we are 
bringing the best possible version of 
this bill up for a vote. 
The administration agrees and has 
stated that it ‘‘strongly supports’’ this 
legislation.

H1229 
March 2, 2022 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3967—HONORING OUR PROMISE TO ADDRESS 
COMPREHENSIVE
TOXICS
(PACT)
ACT—REP. 
TAKANO, D–CALIFORNIA AND 100 COSPONSORS 
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 
3967, which would expand veterans’ access to 
health care and benefits to address the 
health effects of harmful environmental ex-
posures that occurred during military serv-
ice. 
The President believes that our Nation has 
only one truly sacred obligation: to properly 
prepare and equip our service members when 
we send them into harm’s way and to care 
for them and their families when they return 
home. Far too often, military service comes 
with a cost, and we owe it to our veterans 
and their families to address these con-
sequences comprehensively. Unfortunately, 
it has taken decades to understand the dele-
terious effects of environmental exposures— 
leaving too many without access to the bene-
fits and services they need. 
H.R. 3967 would make changes to the defi-
nitions for who is eligible for VA health care 
based on presumed toxic exposure during 
military service, including from burn pits, 
radiation, or other environmental condi-
tions. H.R. 3967 would also make changes to 
the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA’s) 
process for determining presumptive service 
connection and mandate several research 
studies related to military related environ-
mental exposures. It would also establish 
new registries related to exposures, which 
would provide new data on the long-term im-
pacts from environmental exposures. H.R. 
3697 also would allow a Federal cause of ac-
tion related to contaminated water at Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina and establish train-
ing requirements for health providers, and 
require an outreach plan to educate veterans 
about their eligibility for benefits and serv-
ices related to toxic exposure. 
The Administration looks forward to work-
ing with the Congress to enact this legisla-
tion and ensuring it is effectively imple-
mented. We must address the toxic legacy of 
environmental exposures sustained by vet-
erans during their military service and ful-
fill our sacred obligation to our veterans, 
their families, caregivers, and survivors. We 
must also ensure that VA has the resources 
it needs to implement this legislation. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter of support from 
The Independence Fund. 
THE INDEPENDENCE FUND, 
February 23, 2022. 
Hon. MARK TAKANO, 
Chair, House Committee on Veterans Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MIKE BOST, 
Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans 
Affairs, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
TAKANO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER BOST: The Independence Fund en-
dorses the Honoring Our PACT Act (H.R. 
3976) and urges its quickest adoption by the 
full House of Representatives. We further 
urge the House to engage the Senate with an 
appropriate legislative vehicle to get a 
House–Senate conference started as soon as 
possible to work out a final legislative solu-
tion this spring. 
The Independence Fund’s been proud to 
join with Wounded Warrior Project, Iraq and 
Afghanistan Veterans of America, and nu-
merous other veteran organizations through 
the Toxic Exposure in the American Military 
(TEAM) Coalition since August of 2020 and 
the initial introduction and Senate passage 
of the Toxic Exposure in the American Mili-
tary (TEAM) Act of 2020 (S. 4393) and has ap-
plauded the serious and intensive work the 
House Committee on Veterans Affairs under-
took over the last 16 months. 
Now, with the potential House passage of 
H.R. 3967, we commit to engaging the Senate 
to pass this bill as soon as possible, and if 
necessary, proceed to a Conference Com-
mittee as soon as possible to ensure this bill 
can be enacted in this Session of Congress. 
We will also urge the other veteran and mili-
tary serving organizations with which we 
work to join us in such an effort collectively. 
A veteran The Independence Fund serves, 
Nick Ooley, joined the Army in 2007 and de-
ployed to Iraq the following year. Today, he 
is unable to run, jog, or even play basketball 
with his 11-year-old son. As he details, ‘‘Burn 
pits were all over the place. We did convoy 
security, 
so 
we 
would 
travel 
to 
Al 
Taqaddum, Ramadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, all 
over the place. When we would drive through 
or get stationed in those areas, we would be 
breathing this smoke all the time. The 
smoke would be so thick during the day that 
the lights would come on like it was dark.’’ 
But with 78% of all disability claims related 
to toxic exposure denied by the VA, disabled 
veterans are denied the help they des-
perately need and deserve. 
While The Independence Fund will always 
support disabled veterans like Nick through 
our disabled veteran assistance programs, 
the presumptive condition relief and man-
dated health care provided in The Honoring 
Our PACT Act will be a crucially needed life-
line for these veterans who have given so 
much in the defense of our country. We sa-
lute your leadership on this issue and stand 
ready to assist however we can in making 
this the law of the land. 
Very Respectfully, 
BOB CAREY, 
Executive Vice President, 
Advocacy & Strategy. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, it is now 
time for the Members of this body to 
answer a simple question: Am I willing 
to support our troops and honor our 
Nation’s promise to them? 
This bill addresses the true cost of 
war, and opposing it would be a vote 
against our servicemembers and vet-
erans. Such a vote would be incon-
sistent with the thank-yous and patri-
otic displays so many of my colleagues 
offer on Veterans Day. Veterans want 
action, and they deserve our action. 
We made a promise to deliver com-
prehensive toxic exposure legislation, 
and I intend to keep that promise. 
The Honoring our PACT Act will ad-
dress the full scope of issues affecting 
toxic-exposed veterans’ access to VA 
care and benefits while reforming VA’s 
presumptive decisionmaking process. 
It will expand VA healthcare eligibility 
for over 3.5 million veterans exposed to 
burn pits and establish a presumption 
of service connection for over 23 res-
piratory illnesses and cancers. There is 
no other toxic exposure legislation in 
Congress like this one in scope or in 
soundness. 
Before I close, I must emphasize 
something essential. We cannot renege 
on our responsibility to toxic-exposed 
veterans because of any perceived 
sticker shock. 
Cries for offsets and pay-fors did not 
stop Congress from passing a $1.9 tril-
lion tax cut for corporations and the 
wealthy in 2017. Over the past 20 years, 
Congress and our country made the 
choice to spend trillions on other prior-
ities while sending servicemembers 
into harm’s way at the cost of $6.4 tril-
lion. 
We know that this Congress is will-
ing to find money when it wants to, as 
it recently demonstrated by adding $25 
billion to the last National Defense Au-
thorization Act. When our country 
goes to war, we don’t nickel and dime 
the Department of Defense, and we 
shouldn’t try to pinch pennies when it 
comes to covering the care for toxic- 
exposed veterans. 
We will not stand by and be lectured 
about fiscal responsibility when we 
have a moral obligation to America’s 
veterans. And the time to meet that 
obligation is now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 3967, the PACT Act. I wish 
that this were not the case. I would 
love to be here today standing proud 
alongside the chairman in support of 
this bill. I know Ranking Member BOST 
would as well. 
I am new to Congress, but I under-
stand that, historically, the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee would work on a bi-
partisan basis to advance legislation of 
this magnitude. The MISSION Act and 
the Forever GI Bill are wonderful ex-
amples of the majority and minority in 
the House and Senate working together 
in prior Congresses on a compromise 
that both sides could support and send 
to the President’s desk. That is how 
Congress should work. 
That is why they used to say that 
those of us on the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee would leave our party af-
filiations at the door, and that the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee was the most 
bipartisan 
committee 
in 
Congress. 
That is no longer the case under this 
Democrat majority. The PACT Act is a 
sad example of that. 
My fellow Republicans and I want to 
work with the majority to create a fair 
and consistent pathway for healthcare 
benefits for toxic-exposed veterans. 
This is an issue we care deeply about, 
for which I have a personal association, 
and have made our top priority in the 
117th Congress. 
But the majority has consistently re-
fused to meaningfully communicate 
with us on this bill. In fact, the major-
ity significantly rewrote major por-
tions and components of the PACT Act 
less than 2 weeks ago and refused to 
even discuss those changes with those 
of us in the minority. 
Because we did not work together to 
resolve our differences, the bill has se-
rious flaws that we were unable to re-
solve. Already, the manager’s amend-
ment would extend benefits to more 
veterans without scientific justifica-
tion, showing just how slippery a slope 
this bill would set. 
As an alternative, I support creating 
a fair and consistent process for the VA 
to decide whether benefits are war-
ranted for certain military toxic expo-
sure events.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1230 
March 2, 2022 
VA should base this decision on cri-
teria that weighs the strength of sci-
entific evidence supporting a link be-
tween the development of a condition 
and toxic exposure. In fact, for the past 
2 years during the pandemic, we have 
heard repeatedly from the opposite side 
about following the science. 
If the VA determines that there is at 
least a 50 percent chance that these 
veterans’ disabilities are linked to 
toxic exposure, then VA should grant 
benefits on a presumptive basis. 
The PACT Act attempts to create 
such a framework, but I believe more 
discussion is needed to determine if it 
is the best path forward. That is espe-
cially important since the VA began pi-
loting its own program for deciding 
whether there is a scientific link be-
tween a disability and toxic exposure 
last year. 
Under VA’s model, certain Gulf war 
and post-9/11 veterans who were ex-
posed to airborne hazards and develop 
asthma, sinusitis, and rhinitis became 
eligible for benefits last September. 
And just this past week, VA announced 
it will provide compensation to certain 
veterans who are diagnosed with nine 
rare respiratory cancers. 
VA’s decisions were based on science. 
However, it is unclear if all the condi-
tions under Chairman TAKANO’s bill 
would meet the scientific threshold 
under his framework or under the VA’s. 
Furthermore, the PACT Act could 
also flood VA with so many new man-
dates that veterans already receiving 
care and benefits wait longer. Veterans 
wait too long for VA services right 
now. I hear frequently from veterans in 
Iowa who can’t get the care they need, 
are waiting months and, in some 
States, even years for the benefits they 
have earned. I don’t know of a Member 
in this body who can’t say the same 
thing. 
Making those veterans wait even 
longer is unacceptable, and it could be 
unprecedented where the claims proc-
ess is concerned. 
In 2013, the disability claims backlog 
peaked at 600,000 pending claims. Vet-
erans were waiting years to receive an 
initial decision of their claim, and 
then, if it was denied, they were wait-
ing even longer while the VA processed 
their appeal. 
VA has made some improvements to 
how disability claims are processed 
since 2013, but the Department is still 
years away from developing the infor-
mation technology needed to truly ex-
pedite claims processing. 
If the PACT Act were enacted, VA es-
timates the disability claims backlog 
could reach over 1.5 million claims by 
the end of fiscal year 2023. That is more 
than double the height of the backlog 
in 2013. 
If veterans were waiting years for 
their benefits 9 years ago, imagine how 
long they would have to wait today for 
a backlog that is more than two times 
the size it was then. That is completely 
unreasonable. 
The PACT Act is also unacceptable 
for taxpayers. CBO estimates the PACT 
Act would require over $300 million in 
new government spending. Not a penny 
of those costs are offset. 
Additionally, some of the amend-
ments we will be voting on would in-
crease the costs by millions of dollars 
in new mandatory spending on top of 
that. 
You will hear some say that this is 
just the cost of war. Anyone who has 
served, or has a loved one who serves, 
like I have, and do, know what war 
costs. They also know that veterans 
pay taxes, too. They also know that 
veterans have children and grand-
children whose futures they don’t want 
to be anymore burdened with debt than 
they already are. 
The PACT Act costs more than the 
combined discretionary budgets of nine 
Cabinet-level 
departments. 
Think 
about that. And then think about infla-
tion and our national debt, which is al-
ready skyrocketing and is causing 
American taxpayers to pinch pennies. 
We are not doing right by our vet-
erans by being fiscally irresponsible in 
their name, and I say that as a veteran 
myself. 
Finally, there is no clear or quick 
path forward in the Senate for the 
PACT Act. In comparison, we could 
send legislation to the President’s desk 
today that would help sick veterans 
get the care they need. 
The Health Care for Burn Pit Vet-
erans Act would let toxic-exposed post- 
9/11 combat veterans enroll in the VA 
healthcare system. It is bipartisan, and 
it has already passed the Senate last 
month. 
I understand the majority would like 
to go to conference over the Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act and the 
PACT Act, but I also understand that 
the majority supports the Health Care 
for Burn Pit Veterans Act because they 
included it as a provision in the Rules 
Committee print of the PACT Act. 
If we all agree that the Health Care 
for Burn Pit Veterans Act is a good 
policy, why would we delay its enact-
ment? 
Every day that the House fails to 
send it to the President is another day 
that veterans are deprived of lifesaving 
care. Nothing could be more wrong-
headed than that. 
The Health Care for Burn Pit Vet-
erans Act is the correct first step to-
ward this process. It will deliver needed 
healthcare to toxic-exposed veterans 
and buy us the time to work on a bipar-
tisan, bicameral basis to deliver other 
benefits and services to them down the 
line. 
They 
would 
at 
least 
have 
healthcare now. 
We should have done this throughout 
this congressional session, but we 
haven’t even started yet. Sick veterans 
should not pay the price for our inac-
tion. 
Rather than pass the PACT Act in 
the House, with its many flaws and an 
extremely high likelihood of dying in 
the Senate, we must pass the Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor and privilege to yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI), a person who has done 
more for veterans in modern times 
than any other leader of this body. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
kind words, which I accept on behalf of 
our working in a bipartisan way for our 
veterans over the years, Democrats and 
Republicans. And I thank the chairman 
for his extraordinary leadership, both 
in this case and earlier for our vet-
erans, completing our Agent Orange re-
sponsibilities to our veterans. 
As well, I thank Congressman RUIZ, a 
doctor and a Member of Congress who 
has been a champion on this issue, and 
ELAINE LURIA, a veteran and a Member 
of Congress who has been so instru-
mental in bringing this legislation to 
the floor. 
When the President spoke last night 
about meeting the needs of our vet-
erans when it came to the burn pits, he 
received almost a unanimous standing 
ovation for that. It was very encour-
aging to see the Congress of the United 
States, House and Senate, Democrats 
and Republicans, recognize their obli-
gation to our men and women in uni-
form. 
It is important to note that over the 
past generation, over 3 million of our 
courageous Americans have answered 
the call to serve and have donned the 
uniform to protect our freedoms as he-
roic Americans, just as people have 
done since our founding. 
From the deserts of Iraq to the 
mountains of Afghanistan—I was hear-
ing this morning about Kandahar—and 
on bases and in military theaters 
around the world, these heroes have 
risked their lives to fight the enemy 
and yet, tragically, have had to face 
another deadly threat due to exposure 
to burn pits and other toxic sub-
stances. 
We always say about our military on 
the battlefield that we leave no soldier 
behind, and when they come home, we 
leave no veteran behind. Instead of re-
ceiving comprehensive, timely care and 
benefits, sometimes they are forced to 
confront a disability claims process 
that is nearly impossible to navigate. 
That is why the Honoring our Promise 
to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, 
the PACT Act, finally, faithfully ful-
fills that pledge now and into the fu-
ture, that we will leave no veteran 
behind. 
b 1245 
The budget costs of it are a cost of 
war. When we decide that we need to 
engage and initiate military action, we 
should understand that the cost is not 
just in our defense budget but also in 
our veterans’ budget when they come 
home. 
Frankly, the cost of this bill is a 
fraction, if we are talking budget, of 
the cost of the Republican tax bill that 
they passed in 2017, which added $2 tril-
lion to the national debt. I don’t hear

anybody complaining on the other side 
of the aisle about what impact that 
had on veterans and their concerns 
about the fiscal soundness of the 
United States. 
So let’s just put it to rest: If it is a 
cost that we must have for our vet-
erans—and this has been thoroughly 
researched, and others will speak to 
that—then we cannot say we can’t af-
ford it. It isn’t about the price. It is 
about the value of what we get for this. 
In the last 20 years, the VA has seen 
over a 60 percent increase in rates of 
cancer due to toxic exposure. Eighty- 
six percent of veterans from Iraq and 
Afghanistan report being exposed to 
the toxic fumes of burn pits, and 88 per-
cent of those exposed said they were 
experiencing symptoms that could be 
related to that. 
Potentially up to 3.5 million veterans 
deployed post-9/11 may have been ex-
posed to toxic fumes and substances. 
Despite this reality, nearly 75 percent 
of burn-pit-related disability claims 
were denied, Mr. Speaker. 
Too often, the VA and Congress have 
said it is just too expensive to care for, 
and there just isn’t enough proof. The 
result of this negligence has been trag-
ic. Thousands of veterans and families 
have been forced to suffer, including 
heroes like one I will quote, Staff Ser-
geant Wesley Black. 
Staff Sergeant Black was a Purple 
Heart hero who survived two tours in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. In November, he 
died at the age of 36 from colon cancer 
tied to toxic exposure from burn pits, 
leaving behind his wife and new baby. 
After serving his country with dis-
tinction, Sergeant Black should have 
been able to retire happily, with pride. 
Instead, he spent his final days fighting 
for the reforms contained in this legis-
lation so that no current or future vet-
eran would be forced to endure the 
same horror that he and his family did. 
Staff Sergeant Wesley Black, before 
his passing, said: It is too late for me, 
but it is not too late for the next vet-
eran who walks down the halls of the 
VA and goes in and complains about 
the signs and symptoms. 
We must make sure it is not too late 
for other veterans, I say, and when we 
send our servicemen and servicewomen 
into harm’s way, we care for them 
when they come home. 
This is particularly important to me, 
because a long time ago, long before I 
was in Congress, in 1981, I went and sat 
with veterans in California, with Dick 
Gregory, who was making a big asso-
ciation with the cause for Agent Or-
ange, in 1981, California, veterans hav-
ing a hunger strike. Dick Gregory 
knew about hunger strikes from the 
civil rights movement, and he was as-
sociating himself with them and in-
structing them on how to survive a 
hunger strike, and I had the privilege 
of being with them. 
Little did I know at that time, it 
would take decades to address their 
Agent Orange concerns. And it wasn’t 
even complete until Chairman TAKANO 
did so with the Navy legislation that 
he passed. 
We cannot let that much time go by. 
That would be shameful to our coun-
try. 
Let us also thank Mr. CARTWRIGHT, 
who also included in his package the 
Camp Lejeune Justice Act. Anyone 
who has heard from those families 
coming from Camp Lejeune, not just 
the servicemembers but their family 
members, who have been damaged re-
lated to injuries incurred while serving 
at Camp Lejeune. The list goes on. 
Again, thanks to Chairman TAKANO, 
Congressman RAUL
RUIZ, Congress-
woman ELAINE LURIA, and Congress-
man MATT CARTWRIGHT. I thank every-
one who has worked so hard to bring 
this to the floor. I want to also thank 
Senator TESTER, with whom Chairman 
TAKANO
and 
our 
committee 
have 
worked closely. 
We share a goal. We have to find the 
complete package so that it is com-
prehensive and fulfills our responsibil-
ities. 
Others will go into the particulars of 
it. I want to also salute the distin-
guished Secretary of the VA, Denis 
McDonough, for the attention that he 
has paid to making sure what we do 
honors the promise of the PACT Act, 
so that the bill is written in a way that 
delivers in a timely fashion to our vet-
erans. 
I could not have been more excited 
when the President of the United 
States included this important initia-
tive in his remarks, not only as legisla-
tion but in the larger issue of what it 
means to our country, how we value 
our veterans and how we want to pass 
this legislation and get it to his desk 
soon so it will be a comfort to our vet-
erans and their families. 
On the battlefield, we leave no sol-
dier behind. When they come home, we 
leave no veterans behind. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more 
that we can act today, and we can for-
ward legislation to the desk of the 
President for his signature by passing 
the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans 
Act today, so that there is not another 
Sergeant Wesley Black who is denied 
healthcare while the VA processes his 
claims. 
We would be more than delighted to 
help the President in honoring his ini-
tiative, as he stated last night in the 
State of the Union, by today passing 
the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend, who 
serves as the chair of the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on 
Economic Opportunity. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman TAKANO for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Honoring our PACT Act. 
All too often, many veterans hear the 
words ‘‘thank you for your service’’ but 
don’t see enough action behind those 
words. 
Sadly, that has been true for millions 
of veterans who were exposed to toxic 
substances during their service and are 
now suffering from related health con-
ditions. 
While they defended our country, 
they were exposed to burn pits, PFAS 
chemicals, and more, but we failed to 
hold up our end of the bargain to care 
for them when they returned home. 
In the case of Vietnam veterans, 
many who were exposed to Agent Or-
ange, were forced to wait more than 40 
years before they saw proper benefits. 
For too long, the burden of proof has 
been on the veteran to show that their 
illness is a result of toxic exposure 
they experienced during their service. 
For too long, veterans have been told 
that it is too expensive to cover the 
range of health issues that they have 
as a result of their toxic exposure. 
That is wrong, and we must do better 
for our veterans. 
With the Honoring our PACT Act, we 
can do right by our veterans. This in-
cludes finally presuming that if they 
were exposed to toxic substances dur-
ing their service and are now experi-
encing one of 23 respiratory illnesses 
and cancers, then that illness is as a 
result of their exposure, and they are 
owed proper access to benefits and care 
through the VA. 
I also want to highlight what I hope 
will become a key piece of this bill, an 
amendment I offered to authorize Fed-
eral grants for county veterans service 
officers who help veterans and their 
families understand resources at their 
disposal, file benefit claims, and rep-
resent veterans in VA hearings. 
County veterans service officers are 
often veterans’ best allies in navi-
gating red tape within the VA and se-
curing the benefits that veterans have 
earned, which will be particularly im-
portant for the 3.5 million veterans 
who may be eligible for new benefits 
and care as a result of this legislation. 
The amendment is similar to my 
Commitment to Veteran Support and 
Outreach Act, which I introduced with 
a bipartisan group last year. I hope to 
see it move forward as part of our Hon-
oring our PACT Act today. 
As I said, this legislation is our op-
portunity to put real action behind our 
words. Saying ‘‘thank you for your 
service’’ has never been enough. It is 
time to fulfill the promises we made to 
our troops and invest in the care and 
benefits they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the esteemed major-
ity leader of this House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO not only for yielding

time, but much more importantly, I 
thank him for the extraordinary work 
he does on behalf of the Armed Forces 
and for its veterans. He is tireless in 
his advocacy of veterans’ interest. 
I meet with him every Wednesday in 
the chairman’s meeting. He is always 
speaking up about how we need to con-
tinue our focus on the needs of our vet-
erans who served our country so hero-
ically, whether they went overseas or 
not. 
Some of the veterans that we are 
talking about today were not overseas 
when they contracted a disease or an 
illness as a result of toxic substances. 
They were here in America. There is a 
poet who says: They also serve who 
stand and wait ready to serve, ready to 
be deployed to the point of the spear. 
Mr. Speaker, you and I are old 
enough—I don’t want to be too harsh 
on the Speaker—but to remember the 
song: When Johnny comes marching 
home again, hurray, hurray, the boys 
will shout, the girls will cheer, and the 
women, they will all turn out. 
One of the problems we have seen, 
though, after that cheering, that after 
that parade, after that exultation, is 
that memories are short. As time goes 
by, some of our veterans, sadly, trag-
ically, and wrongfully, have been for-
gotten. 
This bill says we do not forget. This 
bill says we will be there for you, and, 
yes, we will be there even if there is a 
substantial cost to it. 
This is a defense cost. In my view, 
the veterans cost ought to be in the de-
fense budget, and it ought to be there 
because that is what we are all enthu-
siastic about spending money on. Vet-
erans need to be and are our first pri-
ority. 
I thank the chairman for his focus 
and for his action. He has long been a 
champion of our veterans and their 
well-being. 
I also thank Representative RUIZ and 
Representative LURIA, who is sitting 
here with us, who have worked very 
hard on this legislation. Mrs. LURIA, 
from Virginia, is a retired commander 
from the United States Navy. She and 
her husband commanded a ship. Dr. 
RUIZ has been on the front line of ill-
ness, the front line as an emergency 
physician, and knows full well the psy-
chological and physical effects of toxic 
material to the well-being of individ-
uals. I thank Dr. RUIZ and Commander 
LURIA for their work on this bill. 
Our veterans served with honor and 
routinely went above and beyond the 
call of duty in their defense of our Na-
tion. Many of them risked their lives; 
not everybody, there were some that 
were support, and without their sup-
port those at the point of the spear 
could not have been successful. 
We have a responsibility, Mr. Speak-
er, a moral responsibility, to care for 
our veterans when they return home 
and ensure that they receive the treat-
ment they deserve. 
When we send our servicemembers to 
war, when we recruit them, when we 
put them in a position by order and 
they become ill because of where they 
are, because of either negligent or un-
knowing actions, unknowing to the ex-
tent we don’t know the adverse effects 
that they caused, whatever the situa-
tion, a soldier’s exposure is our respon-
sibility. 
A soldier’s exposure to burn pits and 
other toxic substances during their 
service has been shown to be connected 
to a greatly increased risk of cancer 
and respiratory diseases. There is no 
doubt about that. 
The legislation before us would ex-
pand veterans’ healthcare access and 
benefits to address the effects of those 
toxic exposures that occurred during 
their military service. 
Mr. Speaker, you and I both know we 
asked our veterans to go to battle for 
America, and they answered the call. 
When 
they 
return 
home, 
veterans 
should not have to go to battle against 
red tape to receive the medical treat-
ment and benefits they have earned 
through their service. 
b 1300 
They ought to be able to access care 
for the physical and mental wounds 
they carry without impediment or 
delay. All of us have gotten cases 
where there have been weeks, months, 
years that veterans have waited for 
benefits that they deserve under law, 
and as a moral responsibility of our 
government. 
We thank our veterans for their serv-
ice. As I said, we cheer and shout and 
turn out. But this is our responsibility. 
This is not about cheering or shouting. 
This is about doing what we ought to 
do for those who were injured in the de-
fense of our Nation and our freedom. 
This is our opportunity to keep our 
promise to put our veterans first and 
truly give them our highest respect. 
Again, I thank my friend, Chairman 
TAKANO. I thank all the members of the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and all 
those veterans who don’t forget those 
who come after them. I thank Mr. 
TAKANO for his leadership, and I urge 
my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to join in passing this bill with a 
strong bipartisan support. 
Our President talked about biparti-
sanship. I talked to Mr. SCALISE about 
being the loyal opposition. Not loyal to 
Democrats or Democrat leaders, but 
loyal to our country. Being loyal to 
our country means being loyal to those 
who served and preserved the freedoms 
that we enjoy, this home of the free 
and land of the brave. I think it is the 
opposite way around, but we get the 
point. Brave and free go together. Let 
us not forget. Let’s pass this bill. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, anyone who has served 
or has a loved one who serves, like I 
have and do, knows the cost of war 
good and well. 
Veterans pay taxes, too. Veterans 
also have children and grandchildren 
that they don’t want to burden with 
debt. The Honoring our PACT Act costs 
more than the combined discretionary 
budgets of nine Cabinet-level depart-
ments: 
Transportation, 
Commerce, 
Homeland Security, State, HUD, Inte-
rior, Justice, Energy, and Labor. 
We shouldn’t dismiss those massive 
costs so easily. Just as we have a moral 
responsibility to care for our veterans, 
we have a moral responsibility to un-
derstand the real-world consequences 
that we can already see in sky-
rocketing inflation and national debt. 
Congress should have to pay our bills 
just like our constituents do. 
I am not downplaying the importance 
of benefits. Getting the Health Care for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act signed into law 
may be the first step in this fight, but 
it would be a lifesaving one. It does no 
good to have benefits if you are not 
alive to have them. Republicans in-
vited Jim Price, a toxic-exposed vet-
eran and widower of one, to testify, and 
he says it better than I could. In Jim’s 
words, ‘‘Benefits mean nothing if you 
are no longer alive.’’ 
Chairman TAKANO acknowledged last 
week that he has not even started talk-
ing to the Senate about a compromise 
on this bill. That means we are months 
away from a deal, if we can even find 
one. Meanwhile, veterans could receive 
lifesaving healthcare now. Some vet-
erans don’t have that long to wait. 
They need that healthcare now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend who serves as chair of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions for the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for yielding and for 
his leadership on this issue, which an-
swers the call of our Nation’s veterans, 
their advocates, and our veterans serv-
ice organizations. 
I rise in support of the Honoring our 
PACT Act, which makes good on this 
Nation’s promise to veterans. It is well 
past the time that we address the im-
pacts of toxic exposure that have been 
endured by members of our military. I 
am glad that we are taking meaning-
ful, comprehensive action today. 
I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion includes a bill that I introduced, 
the PFAS Registry Act. PFAS chemi-
cals have contaminated the environ-
ment and drinking water sources of 
hundreds of military bases across the 
country, including Pease Air Force 
Base in my district. These forever 
chemicals persist in the environment 
and the body and are linked to serious 
health conditions, including cancer. 
This provision will give military 
servicemembers and veterans access to 
health information, research updates, 
and other resources to help protect 
public health and provide relief to 
those who have been exposed to PFAS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1233 
March 2, 2022 
The Honoring our PACT Act will help 
veterans already suffering from the im-
pacts of toxic exposure. We also must 
do more to reduce the risk that more 
servicemembers will be exposed. That 
is why I have also submitted an amend-
ment that will require our government 
to proactively raise awareness of the 
dangers of toxic exposure to Active 
Duty personnel. 
These provisions will require DOD 
and VA to create a strategy for aware-
ness and prevention that will protect 
Active 
Duty 
servicemembers 
from 
harm and save lives. 
Our men and women in uniform al-
ready face numerous threats to life and 
limb for their service. We must mini-
mize risks that environmental and 
toxic hazards pose and provide the 
care, benefits, and support that these 
veterans have earned. It is our solemn 
responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of 
my amendment as well as the under-
lying legislation. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, section 706 comes from 
H.R. 6482, which was referred to the Ju-
diciary Committee, not the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee. H.R. 6482 has not 
gone through the regular order of this 
Congress. This is another blatant ex-
ample of the Democrat majority push-
ing through legislation without careful 
consideration of the impact it may 
have 
on 
the 
Federal 
Government. 
Moreover, this provision is a departure 
from past precedent because it would 
allow veterans to sue the United States 
for a disability incurred in military 
service. This type of change would not 
simply be air dropped into a bill with-
out careful consideration within this 
committee. 
The VA estimates that the PACT Act 
will cause an unprecedented backlog of 
over 1.5 million disability claims. This 
will lead to longer wait times for vet-
erans and put a strain on DVA re-
sources and personnel. An increase in 
claims decisions is likely to result in 
an increase in appeals, which will add 
to the appeals backlog. 
All veterans, not just toxic-exposed 
veterans, will be forced to wait months 
or years for a final decision on their 
disability claim or appeal. This is a big 
risk to take when there is little to no 
science backing the benefits expansion 
under this bill. 
And our moral responsibilities? What 
will I say to the veterans in my district 
who could get healthcare now if we 
refuse to consider a bill that will pass? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good friend and 
cosponsor of H.R. 3967. She is the chair 
of the Disability Assistance and Memo-
rial Affairs Subcommittee and also a 
veteran herself and former commander 
of a naval surface ship. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, as a 20- 
year veteran myself, it is an honor to 
stand before you today. I would say 
that the urgency of what our veterans 
are facing should not be lost on this 
body: Autoimmune disorders, cancer, 
chronic disease, respiratory issues, in-
fertility, and organ failure are just a 
few in a lengthy list of conditions asso-
ciated with toxins during military 
service. 
Why should our veterans, who risked 
their lives on the battlefield, now have 
to battle for their healthcare when 
they return home? 
There should be no question of our 
commitment to the veterans who vol-
untarily served our Nation without 
hesitation. This body should not hesi-
tate to pass this legislation, the Hon-
oring our PACT Act. I am proud to 
serve a district that has such a strong 
military and veteran presence. 
Nearly one out of every six people in 
Virginia’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict is a veteran and even more of 
their family members. Many of those 
veterans come from the Gulf war era, 
with 42 percent of them having served 
in the post-9/11 era. My presence at this 
podium today reconfirms my unwaver-
ing commitment to all of our constitu-
ents who depend on the passage of this 
legislation to get the healthcare that 
they deserve from toxic exposure. 
Let me be clear. Veterans have 
earned the right to accessible VA 
healthcare. As such, the choice is clear 
that we need to pass the Honoring our 
PACT Act. Our work on this vital leg-
islation has been bipartisan, and it in-
corporates two bills that I have intro-
duced: The COVENANT Act, which rec-
ognized the toxic exposure of so many 
of our veterans and established their 
eligibility 
for 
healthcare. 
Further-
more, we have introduced in this legis-
lation a provision that brings the VA 
healthcare notifications into the 21st 
century, allowing the Secretary of the 
VA to notify our veterans of their dis-
ability determinations electronically, 
something that is long overdue and has 
been coordinated with and requested by 
the Secretary of the VA. 
Let me say again that as a 20-year 
veteran myself, I support this legisla-
tion, and I want to get this healthcare 
to all those veterans who served and 
those who desperately need it. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Iowa has 18 minutes re-
maining. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the benefits provided 
under this bill have little to no sci-
entific basis. For example, in 2020, the 
National Academies reviewed 11 of the 
24 burn pit-related conditions in the 
bill but could not establish a link be-
tween exposure to burn pits and those 
11 conditions. The other 13 conditions 
were 
not 
reviewed, 
which 
further 
proves the point that more research is 
needed. 
It is not fair to provide benefits to se-
lect veterans under this bill while tell-
ing other veterans to wait for the 
science. Instead, there needs to be a 
fair and consistent process to decide if 
there is enough evidence supporting 
the extension of benefits to a condition 
that may be linked to toxic exposure. 
This bill sets a dangerous precedent 
that we cannot afford to maintain for 
the next group of toxic-exposure vet-
erans wanting benefits with no sci-
entific support. May I also add that 
veterans need not be in a battle for 
healthcare if we pass today the Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act, which 
has already passed in the Senate. 
We have received zero assurance from 
the VA that the PACT Act can be im-
plemented without disrupting services 
to veterans. I hear every day from vet-
erans who cannot get care in a timely 
manner through the VA right now. The 
PACT Act would make millions more 
veterans eligible for care through the 
same system, much more than the 
Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act 
would, and of course that will have im-
plications for access. Even VA’s own 
providers have expressed concern about 
the impact an influx of new patients 
without accommodations and resources 
will have, clogging up an already over-
burdened system. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 151⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. MRVAN), my good friend who 
serves as chair of the Subcommittee on 
Technology Modernization on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today in support of Hon-
oring our PACT Act. 
Respectfully, the impact of this piece 
of legislation will be veterans receive 
world-class healthcare. 
As I meet with veterans and veteran 
groups from northwest Indiana, I con-
tinue to be grateful every day for the 
selfless service and sacrifice by our 
veterans and their families. 
Just yesterday, less than 24 hours 
ago, a veteran representing the DAV, 
came to me who had two forms of can-
cer, who was advocating not only for 
himself but other veterans to make 
sure they received the care and the ne-
cessity of care that they deserve, as we 
have a responsibility to ensure that all 
veterans receive world-class healthcare 
when they return home from pro-
tecting our freedoms and defending our 
democracy. 
I commend Chairman TAKANO for his 
consistent advocacy and leadership to 
bring this measure to the floor today. 
I appreciate the announcement yes-
terday that the VA will process claims 
for toxic-exposed veterans with certain 
rare respiratory cancers. More must be 
done. I encourage all my colleagues to 
vote for the Honoring our PACT Act so

that a regular and transparent process 
is established to ensure that all issues 
facing toxic-exposed veterans are com-
prehensively addressed. 
As I stated when I opened, the impact 
of this legislation is that veterans re-
ceive the world-class healthcare they 
deserve. 
b 1315 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I applaud the VA for initiating a re-
view of these nine rare cancers to de-
termine if they are linked to airborne 
hazard exposure while deployed. I am 
looking forward to hearing about the 
VHA’s research, which supported the 
expansion of benefits to these Gulf war 
and post-9/11 veterans. 
Likewise, I am interested in learning 
more about the number of veterans 
who would be impacted by this decision 
and the effect it will have on the VA. 
However, these nine cancers are only 
a subset of the conditions included in 
Chairman TAKANO’s bill. I believe more 
scientific research is needed to deter-
mine 
if 
additional 
disabilities 
are 
linked to airborne hazard exposure. 
Both the majority and the minority 
want world-class healthcare for our 
veterans, and thus, it underscores our 
concern with this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ), my good friend and 
neighbor in California, someone who 
has authored a great big section of this 
bill on our presumptives, a member of 
the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
and an active member on the Disability 
Assistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as we stand 
here right now, our servicemembers 
have returned home from the battle-
field only to become delayed casualties 
of war due to their battlefield exposure 
to toxic burn pits. 
My constituents, Jennifer Kepner 
and Alejandro Camacho, both devel-
oped cancers from the burn pits’ toxic 
smoke containing carcinogens they 
breathed day in and day out while serv-
ing our country. Jen Kepner died from 
pancreatic 
cancer, 
and 
Alejandro 
Camacho suffers from testicular can-
cer. 
Let me repeat that. They got sick be-
cause they were exposed to burn pits’ 
toxic smoke while doing their duty for 
our country. 
To make matters worse, both Jen-
nifer and Alejandro were turned down 
when applying for benefits because the 
VA said that there wasn’t enough evi-
dence to link their illness to their serv-
ice. 
To not give our veterans the proper 
care and benefits they earned and 
rightly deserve is a dereliction of our 
Nation’s duty. 
That is why I introduced the Pre-
sumptive Benefits for War Fighters Ex-
posed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins 
Act. 
It would create a presumption of 
service connection for 23 illnesses, in-
cluding cancers related to service near 
burn pits, and it has been included in 
the Honoring our PACT Act. 
My bill is the very soul of the Hon-
oring our PACT Act. It would take the 
burden off of our veterans to prove that 
they are sick as a result of their serv-
ice by presuming the reason they were 
diagnosed with this illness is because 
of their service near burn pits. 
Now is the time to fix this, and any-
thing short of including all 23 of these 
illnesses is not good enough. The 
Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act 
is not good enough. It will shortchange 
our veterans. It is like telling a pneu-
monia patient who needs antibiotics 
for the cure that, hey, listen, let’s just 
give you Tylenol, call it a day, and we 
have taken care of the patient. That is 
medical negligence, and that is not 
what we are going to do to our vet-
erans. 
We cannot have another Agent Or-
ange in our generation and ‘‘delay 
until dead’’ as our Vietnam veterans 
have said. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
passage of this lifesaving bipartisan 
bill. I urge them to stop the medical 
negligence and the dereliction of duty 
to come together as a country and do 
what is right because the science is 
there. It is not a secret. Carcinogens 
cause cancer. Burn pits’ smoke have 
carcinogens. Our burn pits veterans are 
delayed casualties from cancers. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the veterans who are 
sick may not be able to get benefits 
immediately under this bill since they 
will be waiting for the VA to process 
their claims during a 1.5 million-claim 
backlog. 
There is also no guarantee VA will 
get it right the first time. The VA does 
not have a great track record of accu-
rately processing claims while working 
to address a massive backlog. 
For example, during the Obama ad-
ministration, VA took shortcuts to ar-
tificially reduce the backlog, such as 
the provisional denial program. We 
should be focused on getting veterans 
the care they need now to recover 
while continuing to work on the best 
path forward to other benefits. 
Additionally, without a clear path 
forward in the Senate on the PACT 
Act, veterans will continue to wait 
while Congress works to get it right. 
The revisions to the presumptive 
framework in Title 2 were unveiled less 
than 2 weeks ago. We have not had a 
chance to discuss these changes pub-
licly with stakeholders and VA. As 
such, it is unclear if the changes made 
by the Rules Committee Print version 
would improve or hinder VA’s efforts 
to establish a consistent scientific 
process for deciding when to extend 
benefits based on toxic exposure. And 
by doing so, as my colleague suggests, 
we may, in fact, not go down a pathway 
determining why a veteran is ill and 
what other exposures may have caused 
their illness. 
I believe more time is needed to re-
fine the presumptive framework in this 
bill to ensure that veterans will receive 
a fair look at which conditions are 
linked to toxic exposure. We can pass 
the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans 
Act now as the first step to get these 
veterans the healthcare that they need 
as we continue to develop a bipartisan, 
bicameral way forward on the presump-
tive framework. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. BISHOP), my very good friend who 
serves as a subcommittee chair on the 
Appropriations Committee and also a 
former member of the House Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the 
Honoring our PACT Act, which will en-
sure that veterans who have been ex-
posed to toxic substances, materials, or 
environments during their military 
service, particularly toxic burn pits 
and Agent Orange, will receive the care 
and benefits they deserve. 
Exposure to these toxins has led to 
devastating health conditions suffered 
by veterans, including neurological dis-
orders, pulmonary diseases, rare forms 
of cancer, and many other conditions. 
In the past, the government has been 
too slow to recognize the link between 
exposure to toxic substances and the 
medical problems that veterans have 
dealt with when they returned home. 
As a result, veterans and their fami-
lies have been denied benefits and 
much-needed disability compensation 
to deal with the health effects of these 
toxins. 
The Honoring our PACT Act would 
correct these errors and renew our sol-
emn commitment to our Nation’s vet-
erans. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Honoring our PACT Act to ensure that 
our country fulfills Abraham Lincoln’s 
promise to care for him and her who 
shall have borne the battle. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
the concerns the minority had with 
this bill were laid out during the mark-
up of the PACT Act, as well as the 
roundtable last month. We did not see 
the revised text until it was published 
by the Rules Committee. 
At the ranking member’s direction, 
the minority staff were willing to work 
through these concerns with your staff 
line-by-line, but this was rebuffed. 
The minority staff was also told that 
any proposed changes to the scope of 
the bill would not be accepted. 
It is clear that the majority was not 
willing to address our concerns with 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

March 2, 2022 
(Mr. CASTRO), my good friend who 
serves on the Education and Labor 
Committee and is a member of the Per-
manent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence and is a subcommittee chair on 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
proudly represent what is known as 
‘‘Military City U.S.A.,’’ San Antonio, 
Texas, the home to hundreds, if not 
thousands, of veterans who, like others 
across the country, were exposed to 
open-air burn pits whose lives have 
been ruined, and for some, it has cost 
them their life. 
We have to stand up for our veterans 
the way they stood up for our country 
when they were on Active Duty. Yet, 
what I keep hearing from Republicans 
is that there is not enough informa-
tion. There is not enough money. 
Mr. Speaker, how often do you hear 
people around here ask whether it is 
too expensive to buy a tank, whether it 
is too expensive to buy a jet or an air-
craft carrier. Yet, when it comes to our 
men and women in uniform, who go 
risk their lives on behalf of our coun-
try and our allies, the question coming 
from Republicans is whether it is too 
expensive. 
Why don’t you just tell them that it 
is too goddamned expensive to save 
their lives? Why don’t you tell them 
that they are not worth the money? 
Because what you are saying is that 
you want tax cuts for billionaires and 
cancer for veterans. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
the question from Republicans is why 
not pass a bill that has already passed 
the Senate that would give access to 
lifesaving healthcare to our veterans 
now? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Mrs. HAYES), my very good 
friend who serves on the Education and 
Labor Committee with me and as is the 
subcommittee chair on the Agriculture 
Committee. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to urge my colleagues to support 
the Honoring our PACT Act, which up-
holds the promise we made to service-
members that we would care for them 
if they became sick or wounded while 
fighting to protect this country. 
This legislation recognizes the full 
range of military toxic exposure that 
servicemembers have faced. 
This monumental package also in-
cludes my bill, the Palomares Veterans 
Act, which would remove barriers to 
benefits and compensation for those 
veterans who responded to one of the 
largest nuclear disasters in history. 
Over 55 years ago, a B–52 bomber col-
lided with aircraft over the Spanish 
village of Palomares, causing radiation 
exposure to more than 1,600 U.S. air-
men who had no protection when they 
responded to the crash. 
Decades later, many of these airmen 
are suffering and dying from health 
conditions that likely came from ra-
dioactive material. But the VA still 
does not count Palomares as a radi-
ation risk event or provide these vet-
erans with benefits or disability. 
My bill, the Honoring our PACT Act, 
would address this, ensuring these vet-
erans get the healthcare and benefits 
they deserve and ensuring their sur-
viving spouses and children are eligible 
for benefits. 
The job of Congress is to appropriate 
funds, yet whenever we want to help 
people, my Republican colleagues say 
no. If we are not willing to support our 
veterans, what are we willing to sup-
port? 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
LOIS 
FRANKEL), my good friend who is a val-
ued member of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, 
serving 
on 
the 
Sub-
committee on Health. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I am blessed that my 
son, Ben, a Marine war veteran, re-
turned safely from tours in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Ben is now a small busi-
ness owner, and he has even given me 
two beautiful grandsons. And listen, 
not every family is as lucky. 
Our servicemen and -women put their 
lives on the line for our Nation, and 
yet for too long, countless veterans 
have unknowingly been exposed to en-
vironmental hazards and toxic waste, 
like burn pits, during their duty. And 
then they come back home with long- 
term health impacts like cancer, infer-
tility, and breathing issues. 
Mr. Speaker, they deserve better. We 
owe them better. And here is the thing: 
If we are willing to send our troops to 
war, we must also be willing to care for 
their health upon return, and this in-
cludes the 80,000 veterans in my home 
area of Palm Beach County. 
It is time for Congress to honor this 
commitment and pass the Honoring 
our PACT Act to provide access to VA 
healthcare to millions of veterans ex-
posed to toxic substances. 
The best way to thank our veterans 
for their service is with action. I urge 
my colleagues to pass this important 
bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 71⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
Republicans 
agree 
with 
Democrats 
about how important it is to help vet-
erans suffering from toxic exposure. 
However, there is nothing bipartisan 
about how the majority has gone about 
this. 
The majority has consistently re-
fused to meaningfully communicate 
with us on this bill. We are seeing simi-
lar refusal to work together in good 
faith on other fronts, as well. 
This is the third controversial vet-
erans bill that has gone before the 
Rules Committee this year alone. 
In 2017, when this committee had a 
Republican chairman, The New York 
Times called the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee ‘‘the most bipartisan in 
Congress.’’ That is not the case in the 
House anymore, not since the Demo-
crat majority took charge. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. MENG), my very good friend 
who serves on the House Appropria-
tions Committee. 
b 1330 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in favor of H.R. 3967, Honoring our 
PACT Act, authored by my friend and 
esteemed colleague, Chairman TAKANO. 
This important bill includes the text 
of my bill, the Mark Takai Atomic 
Veterans 
Healthcare 
Parity 
Act, 
named after our dear, late friend and 
colleague, Representative Mark Takai. 
H.R. 3967 would permit veterans who 
participated in the nuclear cleanup of 
Enewetak Atoll in the Western Pacific 
to be treated as radiation-exposed vet-
erans and receive service-connected 
compensation benefits. 
Current law only covers servicemem-
bers who participated in active nuclear 
tests and not those who participated in 
the cleanup. With the passage of this 
bill, Congress will finally right this 
wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank 
Chairman MARK TAKANO for his tre-
mendous leadership on this legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote for 
the passage of H.R. 3967. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Guam 
(Mr. SAN NICOLAS), my good friend who 
serves on the Committee on Financial 
Services and the Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, 
imagine a system that frustrates you 
being weaponized in order to deny you 
the care that you are entitled to and 
that you should be entitled to in this 
country. That is what we do when we 
say that the inefficiencies of the VA 
system is reason for us not to pass this 
bill. 
This bill is going to do so much good 
for veterans who deserve it, and it is 
going to do so much good for particular 
veterans who served in Guam and were 
exposed to Agent Orange. It is the only 
bill right now that is going to get that 
done. 
Mr. Speaker, the late Lonnie Kil-
patrick died from his exposure to 
Agent Orange. My bipartisan colleague, 
GUS BILIRAKIS, and I introduced a bill 
to address that exposure. This legisla-
tion that we are talking about today, 
the Honoring our PACT Act, will get 
that done. 
Let’s not weaponize the frustrations 
of the VA to prevent those kinds of so-
lutions. Let’s get this done for our vet-
erans. It is about time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1236 
March 2, 2022 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from the 
State of California (Mr. RUIZ), my good 
friend and colleague, the author of the 
provisions on the 23 presumptions. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I have been 
hearing these arguments or these pleas 
that our colleagues on the other side 
agree with the sentiment, that they 
agree that they want to take care of 
this. Well, those are just words. Wheth-
er they agree will be demonstrated by 
their votes. Those are actions. 
I am hearing the same excuses that 
our Vietnam veterans heard when they 
were dying from Agent Orange and 
pleading for help, the excuse that the 
science is not there; we need more 
time; oh, it costs too much. 
Well, listen here, the science is there. 
As a medical professional, I reviewed 
the science. The scientific studies were 
flawed. They did not ask the right 
questions. And there is enough evi-
dence from other extrapolated data 
that shows that carcinogens can cause 
cancer, that heavy toxic metals in your 
lungs can cause pulmonary fibrosis. We 
have to make sure that if the burn pits 
are illegal in the United States, they 
should be illegal everywhere else be-
cause of this science. 
Then we hear, ‘‘We need more time.’’ 
Well, look, it has taken us years to get 
to this point. I want them to ask the 
widows of General Kepner and all the 
veterans, the thousands of widows and 
sons and daughters who lost their par-
ents, if they need more time. To them, 
it is too late, and we need to act now. 
Mr. Speaker, this is reminiscent of 
the notion that our Vietnam veterans 
say, that what they want to do is delay 
till dead. Delay, delay, delay until they 
are dead. We cannot allow that to hap-
pen. 
Then the next is, ‘‘It costs too 
much.’’ Well, that is a value statement. 
That is a value statement. To us, val-
uing the lives of our veterans and their 
family members is more important 
than giving billions of dollars to bil-
lionaires in a tax law that short-
changed the middle class. Their Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act will 
shortchange our veterans and their 
widows who need the care right now be-
cause they are dying from burn pits. 
That is our value, and that is the 
value I am pleading to the folks on the 
other side to join us in, in a bipartisan 
way with unity to support our vet-
erans. 
Mr. Speaker, veterans are watching. 
They are listening. They care. Some 
are even listening to this with oxygen 
in nasal cannula taking their medica-
tions. Some could possibly be in their 
hospital 
bed 
taking 
chemotherapy. 
Some are in tears because a widow’s 
and their father or mother’s experi-
ences are finally being recognized, and 
finally, we are able to do something. 
They are watching, and your sym-
pathies will be reflected in your vote. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the blue water Navy 
and Agent Orange were different. In 
2011, the Institute of Medicine con-
cluded that, given the passage of time 
and lack of sampling data, there was 
not enough information to conclusively 
determine whether blue water Navy 
veterans were exposed to Agent Or-
ange. However, we already knew what 
conditions were linked to Agent Or-
ange. 
On the other hand, VA already pre-
sumes that certain veterans were ex-
posed to burn pits, but it is unclear 
what conditions are linked to that ex-
posure. The use of burn pits was more 
recent, and much of the data needed to 
determine whether benefits are war-
ranted for certain conditions is still 
available. 
That is why I support and why I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 6659, 
which has already passed the Senate, 
which would advance research into 
health benefits for toxic exposures and 
get needed healthcare for those vet-
erans now. 
Mr. Speaker, I was pleased during 
last night’s State of the Union that 
President Biden highlighted the need 
to address the needs of toxic-exposed 
veterans. 
As I stated earlier in debate just yes-
terday, VA announced it is initiating 
the rulemaking process to extend bene-
fits to certain Gulf war and post-9/11 
veterans 
who 
developed 
nine 
res-
piratory cancers. 
Clearly, Secretary McDonough has 
the authority to provide benefits for 
veterans on a presumptive basis. I ap-
plaud the Secretary for exercising his 
authority to provide toxic-exposed vet-
erans with the earned benefits based on 
science, and I urge him to continue to 
do so. 
We should pass the Health Care for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act now so we can 
send it straight to the President’s desk 
immediately while we continue to 
work with our Senate colleagues and 
VA on the right solution for additional 
benefits. However, toxic-exposed vet-
erans will not receive healthcare or 
benefits simply by virtue of passing the 
PACT Act in the House today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to give the final words 
on the underlying bill, the PACT Act, 
on my mind is a constituent, a Viet-
nam veteran named Zack Earp, a dis-
tant relative of the great Wyatt Earp. 
Zack sacrificed mightily on behalf of 
our country, and his body trembles 
today from Parkinsonism, one of the 
presumptives that got added during the 
blue water Navy debate. And I was 
happy to lead the final charge on get-
ting the Blue Water Navy Vietnam 
Veterans Act across the finish line. 
But do you know what? Passage of 
that bill and its signage into law fi-
nally brought justice to our Vietnam 
veterans who served on naval surface 
ships on the territorial waters of Viet-
nam. It was 40 years late, justice 40 
years late. 
Mr. Speaker, I vowed that this would 
not happen again. To pass half meas-
ures, one-tenth measures, or one-half 
of 1 percent measures, which is what 
the minority proposes to do today, as a 
substitute for a comprehensive bill is 
simply repeating the history of what 
we did to our Vietnam veterans. Burn 
pits are this generation of veterans’ 
Agent Orange. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends that 
we cannot repeat that history. We owe 
our Vietnam veterans that implicit 
promise that we would not repeat the 
history that was done to them. 
As for the cost, I hear the other side 
competing with the President. Let us 
send 
more 
billions 
of 
dollars 
to 
Ukraine. And I, myself, would support 
a robust response to Ukraine in terms 
of money, but where is that same sense 
of one-upmanship when it comes to 
taking care of the veterans here in 
America? 
People are falling over each other in 
this Chamber to get more money to 
Ukraine. That is the right thing to do, 
but it is also the right thing to do to 
take care of our veterans and to finish 
the unfinished business. 
Finally, the science, I am glad to see 
science is being taken so seriously by

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO) 
and the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan en bloc of amendments, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
en bloc package. Many of these amend-
ments strengthen the underlying bill. 
However, I wish we could have more 
time in committee to fully examine 
the impact these amendments would 
have on this legislation. 
While I will not oppose the en bloc 
package, some of the included amend-
ments are well outside the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs’ jurisdiction or 
may require additional work, and I 
must highlight these concerns. 
Three of the amendments clearly im-
pact the operations of the Department 
of Defense and are well outside the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs’ expertise 
or mission. 
Representative 
BUSH’s 
amendment 
No. 3 would necessitate that the VA re-
view known cases of toxic exposure on 
military 
installations 
both 
in 
the 
United States and abroad. Bush amend-
ment No. 4 requires a study of health 
outcomes related to waste from the 
Manhattan Project. 
If anyone is going to conduct such re-
views, it should be the Department of 
Defense, not the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. VA’s time and resources 
need to be focused on meeting the 
needs of veterans, not on investigating 
activities on military bases or as part 
of military programs. 
Yet another amendment, Representa-
tive PAPPAS’ amendment No. 17, would 
require VA to conduct a study outside 
of VA’s expertise and purview. 
b 1345 
This amendment would require Vir-
ginia to coordinate with the Depart-
ment of Defense to provide training to 
Active Duty servicemembers on toxic 
exposure. It is inappropriate for the VA 
to be involved in training Active Duty 
servicemembers, that is entirely the 
DOD’s purview. 
Finally, 
Representative 
SCANLON’s 
amendment 24 would authorize an addi-
tional $150 million in discretionary 
funding for VA’s Veterans Benefits 
Management System, ahead of an ex-
pected drastic increase in disability 
claims should the Honoring our PACT 
Act be enacted. I agree with the intent. 
We need to make additional invest-
ments in benefits IT, but this is not the 
right way to do it. 
According to the CBO, the bill al-
ready includes funding for IT improve-
ments. We have no plan from the VA 
about how various systems should be 
modernized and how much it will ulti-
mately cost. The worst thing we could 
do is throw money at individual sys-
tems with no coordination. 
Moreover, this amendment improp-
erly earmarks $150 million for VBMS, 
which is a dysfunctional and flawed 
system. VBMS has cost over $1 billion 
and has been struggling since its incep-
tion 10 years ago. I am not comfortable 
with spending another $150 million on 
it unless the VA gives us a plan ex-
plaining how it can be modernized. 
Moving forward, we need to work on 
allocating funding where it can have

the most impact. Again, I support the 
intent and look forward to ensuring 
that any IT funding supports veterans 
in the manner intended. 
As I stated earlier, while I do have 
concerns about these four amendments, 
I will support the en bloc package and 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Ms. BUSH), my 
good friend who serves on the Judici-
ary Committee and the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee. 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
TAKANO for his leadership on this his-
toric legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3967, the Hon-
oring 
our 
PACT 
Act, 
to 
expand 
healthcare, research, and resources for 
our veterans who are far too often ex-
posed to toxic substances, both around 
the world and at home in St. Louis. 
This means so much to me as a nurse, 
I see it all the time. 
I am proud to put forward four crit-
ical amendments to this legislation to 
help expand racial equity and study the 
military’s 
environmental 
impact 
through rigorous Department of Vet-
erans Affairs initiatives. My first two 
amendments ensure that VA research 
studies include a broader array of de-
mographic information, including race, 
ethnicity, and disability status in 
gathering information on the impacts 
of toxic exposure. 
Our third vital amendment ensures 
the VA will extend reviews of known 
cases of toxic exposure to military 
sites abroad. The Department of De-
fense needs to provide concrete data 
about the waste and pollution we are 
leaving in the nearly 750 military bases 
in over 80 countries around the world. 
Finally, our last amendment adds a 
new study to this bill to measure the 
harmful health consequences of Man-
hattan Project waste on our veterans 
and their families in St. Louis. 
If you are from North St. Louis there 
is a good chance that at some point in 
your life you have been exposed to 
toxic military waste like I have. From 
West 
Lake 
Landfill 
to 
Coldwater 
Creek, toxic military nuclear waste has 
been dumped in our communities, lead-
ing to rare cancers and birth defects. 
Our veterans worked with this waste 
and are still living with it. The study is 
just one step we are taking to care for 
their health and safety. I look forward 
to voting in support of the Honoring 
our PACT Act and advancing these 
critical amendments that will help us 
to save lives. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS). 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of amendment No. 8 in the 
en bloc. This amendment helps vet-
erans and their families navigate a bu-
reaucratic maze at VA. It is very frus-
trating a lot of times when they re-
ceive medical treatment at a non-VA 
facility. 
When a veteran is admitted to a hos-
pital or emergency department they 
currently only have 3 days to notify 
the VA. If they fail to notify the VA in 
that 3-day window, any claim associ-
ated with that visit will be automati-
cally denied. 
There are circumstances when get-
ting immediate medical care outside of 
the VA system is the veteran’s only op-
tion, especially during a medical emer-
gency. They and their family should 
not have to worry about paperwork and 
the bureaucracy if the veteran is facing 
a life-threatening condition or is un-
able to make his or her own healthcare 
decisions. 
My amendment simply just lengthens 
that window and adds another day onto 
that window to report the claim. When 
you think about this, if you are going 
in on an emergency basis and after you 
get stabilized—it might take a couple 
days in the hospital to get stabilized— 
that extra day doesn’t seem like much, 
but it is really important because they 
get stabilized and they get time to sort 
through where they are at. That is so 
important. We have helped hundreds 
and maybe thousands of veterans back 
in Ohio, and this comes up all the time, 
and they have to fight to get their 
claim. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is really im-
portant, just a little bit of extra time. 
It is a no-brainer issue. I appreciate the 
chair putting it in the en bloc because 
it is really important because veterans, 
especially when they are in a non-vet-
eran facility and have emergency care, 
they shouldn’t have to worry about 
that deadline, and it just gives them a 
little extra time. 
Mr. Speaker, I support amendment 
No. 8. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), 
my 
good 
friend who serves as a subcommittee 
chair on the Agriculture Committee 
and as a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, my 
commitment to supporting veterans 
suffering from toxic exposures has been 
ironclad since I first met the late Mi-
chael Lecik, a father, a husband, a fire-
fighter, and a veteran who died of can-
cer related to his exposures. 
It continued when I met Gillie Jen-
kins, an atomic war veteran from Ches-
terfield, Virginia, who in his 90s is still 
fighting for the recognition of his 
brothers in arms and the sacrifices 
that they made. 
Today, when I rise in support of my 
amendment to H.R. 3967, I am doing so 
inspired by William G. Collins, a vet-
eran from Louisa County, Virginia. My 
amendment would require the VA to 
investigate the long-term health im-
pacts of jet fuel exposures on our coun-
try’s servicemembers. 
Mr. Collins, a veteran from Louisa 
County, Virginia, is living with Par-
kinson’s. As a former Air Force crew 
fire chief, his years of constant expo-
sure to jet fuel put him at risk, but 
now the VA does not recognize Mr. Col-
lins’ condition as having a service con-
nection. Mr. Collins served honorably, 
and he should know that his country 
has his back. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
bring us one step closer to ensure that 
veterans 
like 
William 
have 
the 
healthcare benefits they deserve and 
the acknowledgment of their sacrifice. 
Mr. Collins says, ‘‘This disease has 
impacted my health, my economic se-
curity, and potentially my wife and I’s 
dream of spending our last years on our 
beloved farm where we raised our fam-
ily.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, today I urge my col-
leagues to support this long overdue 
amendment as we support all of our 
Nation’s veterans. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), the distin-
guished subcommittee chair of the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
here is the deal. When we send our 
servicemembers into harm’s way the 
deal is that we are going to take care 
of them when they get back home. It is 
more than a deal; it is a pact. It is 
something sacred. But for far too long 
Congress and the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs have been slow in acting 
on that pact citing the high cost or the 
lack of science. The result is a dis-
ability claims benefit process that is 
cumbersome and places the burden on 
the veteran himself or herself to prove 
toxic exposure. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment which streamlines this 
process. It helps ease the burden of the 
disability benefit claims process on 
servicemembers and their families by, 
number one, requiring the Secretary of 
the VA to share a list of resources for 
toxic-exposed veterans, caregivers of 
toxic-exposed veterans, and survivors 
of toxic-exposed vets, national vet-
erans service organizations, and other 
veterans’ groups. 
Number two, it requires the VA Sec-
retary to share an outreach program 
with those VSOs. I believe we have to 
take every step possible to ensure that 
we offer the best care to those who 
have served our Nation. My amend-
ment is a step forward in reaching the 
goal that servicemembers and their 
families should be made aware of every 
resource, and that includes the re-
sources included in the Honoring our 
PACT Act. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
these 23 amendments en bloc, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Iowa. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to discuss Ranking Mem-
ber BOST’s amendment to replace the 
Honoring our PACT Act with the 
Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act. 
The Health Care for Burn Pit Vet-
erans Act is a bipartisan legislation 
that has already passed in the Senate. 
It would expand healthcare for toxic- 
exposed veterans by extending VA’s en-
hanced combat eligibility period from 5 
to 10 years. That would give post-9/11 
combat veterans a decade after leaving 
the military to enroll in VA care with-
out having a service-connected dis-
ability rating or a low income. 
Those who have been out of the mili-
tary for more than a decade would be 
able to enroll during a 1-year open en-
rollment period. The bill would also 
improve training for VA staff on how 
to recognize and treat toxic exposure; 
research on the impact of toxic expo-
sure; and outreach about the resources 
available to veterans regarding toxic 
exposure. CBO has estimated that the 
bill would cost $1 billion in discre-
tionary funding over 10 years. 
b 1400 
This is in stark contrast to the over 
$300 billion discretionary and manda-
tory costs of the PACT Act. 
The Healthcare for Burn Pit Vet-
erans Act would not expand compensa-
tion benefits for toxic-exposed vet-
erans. 
I appreciate the importance of bene-
fits. That is why Ranking Member 
BOST and I remain committed to work-
ing across the aisle and Capitol to im-
prove benefits for toxic-exposed vet-
erans. 
The framework that the PACT Act 
establishes to do that, however, is un-
workable, and I am afraid the PACT 
Act will stall without a clear path for-
ward in the Senate. 
I don’t want to let the perfect be the 
enemy of the good on an issue as im-
portant as this one. I also don’t want 
to let this Congress go by without help-
ing veterans who are sick and dying 
from toxic exposure. As a veteran and 
as a doctor who has cared for sick and 
dying patients, that would be an unac-
ceptable outcome for me. 
Passage of the Healthcare for Burn 
Pit Veterans Act is a critical first step 
in saving the lives of veterans suffering 
from toxic exposure. The House should 
not let another day go by without send-
ing it to the President. The stakes are 
too high. 
Behind me is a picture of Lauren 
Price. She passed away from conditions 
she and her husband Jim believe were 
related to toxic exposure. Ranking 
Member BOST invited Jim to testify 
last year about Lauren’s legacy. Dur-
ing his testimony, Jim stressed the 
need to provide veterans like her with 
VA healthcare. As he said, benefits 
don’t mean much if a veteran isn’t 
alive to get them because they didn’t 
get the healthcare they need and 
earned. 
Jim’s message is an important one. 
Some veterans cannot afford to keep 
waiting for Congress to agree on a com-
prehensive way forward. That would be 
a monumental task, and we have not 
even started it yet. That is why the 
House must pass the Healthcare for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act today. I hope we 
will. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JOHNSON of Georgia). The gentleman 
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to Ranking Member BOST’s sub-
stitute offered in his absence by Rep-
resentative MILLER-MEEKS. 
I want to be clear about what this 
substitute is and what it is not. The 
ranking 
member 
has 
offered 
this 
amendment as the solution to address-
ing toxic exposure. But it is not that. 
The substitute amendment is the exact 
text of a Senator TESTER bill which is 
meant to be the first part of a three- 
part effort in the Senate. 
What Senator TESTER has proposed, 
is doing in three phases what we have 
done in the PACT Act together. Yet 
my colleague from Illinois and my col-
league from Iowa have taken the work 
of the Senate without intending to do

March 2, 2022 
any more. This is it. They are rep-
resenting this as the complete solution 
which amounts to really a bait and 
switch. 
This substitute amendment would 
strike the entire PACT Act and replace 
it 
with 
an 
expansion 
of 
existing 
healthcare eligibility for combat vet-
erans from 5 to 10 years. The Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that 
this provision will impact roughly 
16,000 veterans over the next 10 years. 
This is laudable, but let’s talk about 
the math. 
Over the past 20 years, 3.5 million 
servicemembers 
deployed 
to 
areas 
where they may have been exposed to 
toxic substances. So the ranking mem-
ber’s amendment would leave behind 
over 3.4 million veterans. 
This is not even a half measure, this 
substitute, this replacement, that they 
offer. It is not even one-tenth. It is 
one-half of 1 percent, a one-half of 1 
percent solution compared to the com-
prehensive bill that we need. 
The policy of this amendment is 
something we agree on. We should en-
hance eligibility for combat veterans 
which is why we included the language 
in the bill before you today, Mr. Speak-
er. However, it only covers less than 
half a percentage point of the number 
of veterans who would be covered under 
PACT. 
My colleague is asserting that less 
than one-half of a percentage point is 
enough to be done and then walk away? 
The math does not add up, and vet-
erans know it. That is why over 42 vet-
erans service organizations are sup-
porting the PACT Act. Again, I ref-
erence the letters previously inserted 
into the RECORD. 
During the President’s State of the 
Union Address last night, he high-
lighted the importance of this topic 
citing his own family tragedy and the 
loss of his son, Beau, to brain cancer 
after his military service. He called on 
Congress to ‘‘pass a law to make sure 
veterans devastated by toxic exposures 
in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the 
benefits and comprehensive healthcare 
they deserve.’’ 
Let me repeat that: pass a law to 
make sure veterans devastated by toxic 
exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan fi-
nally get the benefits and comprehen-
sive healthcare they deserve. 
The Bost substitute is far from com-
prehensive. In fact, it is a fraction of 
what our veterans have earned and de-
serve. 
It is time we honored our pact to our 
veterans. That is why I implore my col-
leagues to reject this incremental 
measure and join me in supporting the 
only comprehensive toxic-exposure leg-
islation that delivers on our sacred 
promise, the PACT Act. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 11⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
with all due deference to my colleague, 
Ranking Member BOST
has made it 
abundantly clear that this is a first 
step—not a last step—but an initial 
first step in getting veterans the 
healthcare that they need and deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge and implore my 
colleagues to pass Mr. BOST’s amend-
ment No. 5. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
who is my good friend and who serves 
on the Budget Committee, the Home-
land Security Committee, and as the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, and Homeland Security on 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my distinguished friend for 
yielding. 
I rise enthusiastically joining the 
President and joining our chairman in 
pushing the Honoring our PACT Act 
and just remind the underlying amend-
ment by Mr. BOST, one-half of 1 per-
cent, do we in this time, do our vet-
erans, do our soldiers deserve half 
treatment? 
I don’t think so. 
The Jackson Lee amendment adds to 
this legislation. It would add a report 
on the feasibility of modifying the in-
dividual longitudinal exposure record 
system used to register toxic exposure 
of military personnel to include mem-
bers of the National Guard who are de-
ployed in the United States in connec-
tion with a natural disaster without re-
gard to duty status and may record in-
formation regarding a suspected expo-
sure by the National Guard to toxic 
substances while they are in the midst 
of their rescues. 
We know and we thank the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee for recog-
nizing and working with my staff that 
the National Guard is involved in toxic 
matters on home side. They collabo-
rate with and support civilian authori-
ties and traditional first responders, 
they are called in as a helpmate. They 
serve to strengthen and expand local 
disaster response while the emergency 
services of a State or locale may have 
robust plans to deal with unexpected, 
sometimes disasters strike that over-
whelm their resources. 
Let me just show you, Mr. Speaker, 
they are involved in the work. This is 
an important amendment, and I ask 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, Chairman MCGOVERN, thank 
you for this opportunity to discuss briefly three 
Jackson Lee Amendment #13, to H.R. 3967, 
the Honoring our PACT Act. 
The PACT Act provides much needed atten-
tion to the issue of toxic exposure of military 
service personnel when it occurs during de-
ployment. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #13 would add a 
report on the feasibility of modifying the Indi-
vidual Longitudinal Exposure Record System 
used to register toxic exposure of military per-
sonnel, to include members of the National 
Guard who are deployed in the United States 
in connection with a natural disaster, without 
regard to duty status may record information 
regarding a suspected exposure by the Na-
tional Guard to toxic substances during such 
deployment. 
I thank the House Committee on Veterans 
Affairs for working with my staff on this Jack-
son Lee Amendment to H.R. 3967. 
The National Guard collaborates with and 
supports civilian authorities and traditional first 
responders in their efforts to respond to emer-
gencies and disasters. 
They serve to strengthen and expand the 
local disaster response capacity. 
While the emergency services of a state or 
locale may have robust plans to deal with the 
unexpected, sometimes disasters strike that 
overwhelm their resources and manpower. 
During these times the National Guard can 
play a vital role in saving lives, stemming suf-
fering and protecting property. 
This amendment is important because of 
the conditions that can exist during manmade 
or natural disasters that may expose National 
Guard members to toxic substances. 
National Guard service personnel provide 
vital services before, during and following dis-
asters that require that they come into contact 
with flood waters, wildfires and other disasters 
that by their nature would breach containment, 
manufacturing, and storage facilities for toxic 
substances that would pose a risk to people. 
I recall the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey 
and the hundreds of refineries, small and large 
chemical processing facilities, and storage fa-
cilities that were impacted by flood waters. 
Some of these impacts included the risk of 
explosions due to the loss of containment 
caused by a loss of electricity or the encroach-
ment of flood waters. 
As was the case when two explosions 
shook the Arkema chemical facility that re-
sulted in a fire because the temperature re-
quired to safely store chemicals was lost due 
to a power outage caused by Hurricane Har-
vey flooding. 
Many chemical facilities are located in low- 
lying coastal areas and vulnerable to damage 
from hurricanes, flooding, and erosion, which 
are increasing with climate change. 
Extreme weather can trigger industrial dis-
asters, including explosions, fires, and major 
chemical releases, as well as chronic chemical 
leakage into air, water, and soil. 
Researchers identified 872 highly hazardous 
chemical facilities within 50 miles of the hurri-
cane-prone U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Coastal areas are also densely populated 
and would be where National Guard would be 
deployed to evacuate and assist residents in 
advance of, during and following the landfall of 
a Hurricane. 
There are approximately 4,374,000 people, 
1,717 schools, and 98 medical facilities within 
1.5 miles of the facilities according to the 
Milken Institute School of Public Health, 
George Washington University, which col-
lected survey data. 
The Jackson Lee amendment would provide 
a report to inform the Committee on Veterans 
Affairs of the importance of including toxic ex-
posure data on National Guard personnel who 
are exposed to toxic substances when de-
ployed in response to disasters. 
In 2021, following Hurricane Ida’s landfall in 
an analysis by the Union of Concerned Sci-
entists (UCS) of the New Orleans area re-
vealed that 138 industrial facilities in and 
around the city—some of which use electricity

to contain hazardous chemicals—were poten-
tially without power, putting facility workers 
and nearby civilians at enormous risk. 
Flood waters, smoke from wildfires, and 
earthquakes have impacts on facilities, busi-
nesses, and research facilities that are safe 
until they are compromised by the impact of a 
natural or manmade disaster. 
I urge the Committee to make in order the

States Code, as added by subsection (a), as 
compared to members of the Armed Forces

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BROWNLEY) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to offer a straightforward amendment 
to H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT 
Act, which would simply ensure toxic– 
exposed veterans have access to mam-
mography screenings. 
I would like to begin by thanking my 
colleague from Iowa, Congresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS, for coauthoring this 
amendment which is based on her out-
standing bill. 
As chair of the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Subcommittee on Health, I very 
much want to see the gentlewoman’s 
good bill advance, which is why I am 
offering this amendment today. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, the condi-
tions related to toxic exposure mani-
fest themselves in many ways and on 
many different timelines. The inci-
dence rate of breast cancer in women 
veterans is 20 to 40 percent higher than 
the incidence rate of breast cancer 
among nonveteran women. From 2000 
to 2015, the VA saw the number of 
women diagnosed with breast cancer 
increase by five times for women ages 
45 to 65. This is partly due to better 
screening, but still more can be done, 
particularly related to those who have 
been exposed to toxic substances. 
Ensuring that veterans have access 
to lifesaving screening for breast can-
cer cannot depend on the time after 
separation from the military and must 
simply depend on whether a veteran 
served in a place where they were ex-
posed to toxins. 
This 
amendment, 
based 
on 
the 
SERVICE Act, directs the director of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
provide mammogram screening for fe-
male veterans who served in areas as-
sociated with burn pits and other toxic 
exposure. It also directs the VA to sub-
mit a report to both the Senate and 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committees 2 
years after enactment that compares 
the instances of breast cancer among 
members of the Armed Forces. 
Women veterans who served in areas 
with high toxic exposures should not 
have to wait until they start showing 
symptoms or reach a certain age to ac-
cess 
preventative 
mammography 
screenings. 
This is why I am proud to join Con-
gresswoman MILLER-MEEKS in offering 
this lifesaving amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I claim the time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Iowa 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I was pleased to introduce this amend-
ment alongside my colleague, Con-
gresswoman JULIA
BROWNLEY, from 
California.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1246 
March 2, 2022 
This amendment is based on our bill, 
H.R. 4794, the Making Advances in 
Mammography and Medical Options for 
Veterans Act. It would ensure that 
toxic-exposed 
veterans 
can 
access 
mammography screens through the VA 
healthcare system. As a doctor I know 
how very important preventive care is. 
Early detection of cancer or other seri-
ous conditions can be lifesaving for pa-
tients. 
Veterans deserve the very highest 
quality care that we can offer them, 
and that certainly includes timely ac-
cess to mammograms, particularly for 
the growing number of women who are 
volunteering to serve in our Armed 
Forces. 
I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY 
for working with me on this amend-
ment, and I am glad that it was made 
in order. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support that, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time is remaining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 21⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO), who is the 
great chair of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee and who has worked dili-
gently on this very, very important 
bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, the chair of the Sub-
committee on Health. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Brownley-Miller-Meeks amend-
ment. Women who have served in the 
military are 20 to 40 percent more like-
ly to develop breast cancer than 
women who have never served. It is be-
lieved that it is due to exposure to ra-
diation and other carcinogens while 
serving. It is therefore critical that VA 
ensure all veterans who have served in 
locations associated with toxic expo-
sure have access to prompt, high-qual-
ity breast imaging services to detect 
breast cancer early. 
This amendment would ensure just 
that. Any eligible veteran who was de-
ployed and exposed to burn pits and 
airborne hazards would be eligible for 
mammography screens by the VA. 
These screenings will save lives. 
Furthermore, it requires VA to sub-
mit a report to Congress on the rates of 
breast cancer among those veterans de-
ployed to such toxic environments and 
compare those rates against their vet-
eran peers who were not exposed, as 
well as the civilian population. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this commonsense amend-
ment. 
b 1415 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
all Members to support mammography 
screenings for toxic-exposed veterans 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. 
I would also like to say that we must 
pass this bill today, a bill that will fi-
nally, finally, bring justice to our vet-
erans and provide our commitment and 
promise that we made to our veterans 
who served our country, both men and 
women. So this bill is long, long over-
due. 
Men and women sign up for the 
Armed Forces. They know they may 
have to put their lives on the line. 
They did not know that they may die 
of toxic exposures. 
This bill is long overdue. We need a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the amendment and a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BROWNLEY). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BROWNLEY). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8, 
the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
UKRAINE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–96) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, which was 
expanded in scope in Executive Order 
13661 of March 16, 2014, Executive Order 
13662 of March 20, 2014, and Executive 
Order 14065 of February 21, 2022, and 
under which additional steps were 
taken in Executive Order 13685 of De-
cember 19, 2014 and Executive Order 
13849 of September 20, 2018, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond March 6, 2022. 
The actions and policies of persons 
that undermine democratic processes 
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten 
its 
peace, 
security, 
stability, 
sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity; and 
contribute to the misappropriation of 
its assets, as well as the actions and 
policies of the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation, including its pur-
ported annexation of Crimea, its use of 
force in Ukraine, and its purported rec-
ognition of the so-called Donetsk Peo-
ple’s Republic or Luhansk People’s Re-
public regions of Ukraine, continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13660 
with respect to Ukraine. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.
THE WHITE HOUSE, March 2, 2022. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will

further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1247 
March 2, 2022 
SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE OF 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 956) to support the Peo-
ple of Ukraine. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 956 
Whereas, on January 21, 1990, more than 
300,000 Ukrainians called for unity and inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union by forming 
a human chain between the cities of Kyiv 
and Ivano-Frankivsk; 
Whereas, on December 1, 1991, more than 90 
percent of Ukrainian citizens voted in a na-
tional referendum in support of independ-
ence, with majorities in every region; 
Whereas, 
on 
November 
21, 
2013, 
the 
Euromaidan protests began in favor of sign-
ing the European Union-Ukraine Association 
Agreement, resulting in the Revolution of 
Dignity and the removal of President Viktor 
Yanukovych by the Verkhovna Rada; 
Whereas, in February and March of 2014, 
the Russian Federation invaded the penin-
sula of Crimea, illegally annexed the region, 
held a sham referendum, and claimed the 
territory to be a part of Russia; 
Whereas, beginning in April 2014, the Rus-
sian Federation invaded the Donetsk and 
Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine insti-
gating violence, stoking conflict, arming 
separatists, and spreading disinformation on 
Ukrainian soil; 
Whereas, on July 17, 2014, Russian soldiers 
or Russian separatist fighters shot down the 
passenger flight MH17 flying over the Donbas 
with a Buk surface-to-air missile provided by 
the Russian Federation, killing all 298 inno-
cent passengers on board; 
Whereas, since February 2015, Russia has 
continued to fail to live up to its agreements 
under the Minsk agreements and the Rus-
sian-backed war in the Donbas has claimed 
approximately 14,000 lives; 
Whereas the Russian military conducted a 
large-scale buildup in and around Ukraine in 
March and April 2021 under the guise of mili-
tary exercises, leaving significant military 
equipment behind; 
Whereas the Russian military initiated its 
most recent much larger military buildup in 
October 2021 that culminated in approxi-
mately 190,000 forces by the time of Russia’s 
renewed full-scale incursion on February 24, 
2022; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, the State 
Duma of Russia passed a bill, approved by 
President Vladimir Putin, to officially rec-
ognize the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s 
Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic as 
independent; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, Vladimir 
Putin ordered Russian troops into the self- 
proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic and 
Donetsk People’s Republic after recognizing 
their independence; 
Whereas the decision to recognize the self- 
proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic and 
Donetsk People’s Republic as independent 
and order Russian troops into that territory 
was not only in violation of international 
law, Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity, and the Minsk agreements, but also 
tantamount to a declaration of war; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian 
forces, enabled by Belarus, launched its 
unprovoked full-scale renewed invasion of a 
peaceful, independent country, Ukraine; 
Whereas, since 2014, the United States has 
provided $3,100,000,000 in security assistance 
to Ukraine, including over $1,000,000,000 over 
the course of the last year, $200,000,000 of 
which was approved on December 27, 2021, 
and $350,000,000 of which was approved on 
February 26, 2022; 
Whereas it is the right of all countries to 
decide their own future, foreign policy, and 
security arrangements free from outside in-
terference or coercion; 
Whereas the Russian Federation repeat-
edly lied about their massive buildup of mili-
tary forces around Ukraine and claimed that 
reports Russia would invade Ukraine were 
hysteria; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the G7 
issued a statement condemning the ‘‘large- 
scale military aggression by the Russian 
Federation against the territorial integrity, 
sovereignty and independence of Ukraine’’; 
Whereas, on February 25, 2022, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization condemned ‘‘in 
the strongest possible terms Russia’s horri-
fying attack on Ukraine’’, called on Russia 
‘‘to turn back from the path of violence and 
aggression’’, and reaffirmed an ‘‘iron-clad’’ 
commitment to Article 5; 
Whereas 
the 
European 
Commission, 
France, Germany, Italy, the United King-
dom, and Canada joined with the United 
States, committed to coordinated economic 
sanctions, 
including 
severe 
restrictions, 
against Russia’s Central Bank and full 
blocking sanctions against Vladimir Putin; 
Whereas United States leadership is inte-
gral to nations around the world in con-
demning and imposing costs on the Russian 
Federation for its illegal, full-scale, renewed 
invasion; 
Whereas Russian forces have targeted ci-
vilians and have committed war crimes and 
crimes against humanity; 
Whereas, in the days since the renewed 
full-scale invasion began, Russian citizens 
have taken to the streets in cities and towns 
across Russia to protest Putin’s illegitimate 
and destructive war waged against a peaceful 
and sovereign Ukraine; and 
Whereas the United States, along with al-
lies in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and others 
around the world, has been actively respond-
ing to Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression 
against Ukraine with critical military, hu-
manitarian, 
and 
financial 
support 
for 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian people: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) demands an immediate cease-fire and 
the full withdrawal of Russian forces from 
Ukrainian territory; 
(2) supports, unequivocally, Ukraine’s sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity; 
(3) backs the continued use of sanctions, in 
coordination with United States allies and 
partners, to fully isolate the Putin regime 
economically for its unprovoked aggression 
against Ukraine; 
(4) urges the United States and its allies 
and partners to deliver additional and imme-
diate defensive security assistance to help 
Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and 
other threats Ukraine is currently facing 
from Russian forces; 
(5) commits to continuing to support re-
sistance by the Ukrainian people as long as 
the Russian Federation continues to violate 
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integ-
rity; 
(6) promises to continue to provide signifi-
cant additional aid and humanitarian relief 
to Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s ag-
gression, commends European partners for 
their efforts to relieve suffering on the 
ground, and urges the Russian Federation 
alongside United States allies and partners 
to guarantee safe passage out of the country; 
(7) reaffirms its strong support for the se-
curity of United States allies and ironclad 
commitment to Article 5 of the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO); 
(8) emphasizes that NATO’s relationship 
with Ukraine is a matter only for Ukraine 
and the 30 NATO allies; 
(9) pledges to support working with Europe 
and international partners to bolster Eu-
rope’s energy security and reduce its depend-
ence on Russian energy imports; 
(10) underscores the importance of main-
taining United States energy independence 
for the benefit of the American people and 
United States allies; 
(11) reiterates that Crimea and the terri-
tories illegally controlled by the illegitimate 
Russian-controlled governments in Donetsk 
and Luhansk are sovereign Ukrainian terri-
tory; 
(12) declares that the war in Ukraine, a 
democratic country, is the frontline of de-
mocracy 
and 
freedom 
versus 
authoritarianism 
represented 
by 
Putin’s 
Russia; 
(13) supports the right of the Russian peo-
ple to protest, including the current protests 
against Putin’s unprovoked war against 
Ukraine, and demands the immediate release 
of all those who have been unjustly detained 
in Russia for expressing their desire for 
peace; 
(14) comprehends that strongmen, dic-
tators, and authoritarians are watching the 
world’s response to Putin’s war against 
Ukraine and learning lessons for their own 
aggressive actions domestically and abroad, 
thereby making a strong and united response 
important to deter the expansion of territory 
by the use of military force beyond this cri-
sis; 
(15) states unambiguously that it will 
never recognize or support any illegitimate 
Russian-controlled leader or government in-
stalled through the use of force, and that 
only the people of Ukraine can choose their 
leadership through free and fair democratic

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H. Res. 
956. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my resolution, which I introduced 
with Representative SPARTZ, to dem-
onstrate bipartisan congressional sup-
port for the Ukrainian people. 
Today, we are witnessing the most 
devastating escalation of violence on 
the European Continent in decades.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1248 
March 2, 2022 
Vladimir Putin has launched an un-
justifiable, senseless war on a peaceful, 
sovereign nation, Ukraine. We are al-
ready seeing thousands of casualties, 
both Ukrainians and Russians, and 
hundreds of thousands of refugees flee-
ing to the European Union. 
As we speak, Putin’s army is encir-
cling Ukrainian cities, including the 
capital of Kyiv. His forces are bombing 
indiscriminately, ruthlessly killing ci-
vilians, and destroying critical infra-
structure. 
In his despicable and utterly false 
claims to denazify Ukraine, he has 
bombed the memorial at Babyn Yar, 
where, just weeks ago, Representative 
SPARTZ and I stood with other Mem-
bers of Congress at the site where tens 
of thousands were killed in massacres 
during the Holocaust. The streets we 
walked just a few weeks ago are now a 
battlefield, its citizens now soldiers. 
Let us be clear. This is but one per-
son’s war. This is caused by one indi-
vidual by the name of Vladimir Putin. 
It is his war. 
Ukraine, the United States, and our 
allies have all actively engaged in a 
historic diplomatic push since before 
Russia marched their troops into the 
sovereign territory of Ukraine. Never-
theless, Putin chose the path of an 
unprovoked war instead. 
It is a peaceful Ukraine that is plead-
ing for a cease-fire so that diplomacy 
and sanity can triumph over bloodshed 
and madness. 
Just this morning, the U.N. General 
Assembly held an emergency session 
that 
voted 
overwhelmingly against 
Russia’s aggression. This vote reaf-
firms the values that we stand for and 
unequivocally demonstrates that the 
world stands with Ukraine. 
In this dark time, the United States 
has 
helped 
usher 
unprecedented 
amounts of assistance from the United 
States, Europe, and our allies and part-
ners from all around the world, from 
North Africa to North America to the 
Indo-Pacific, to aid Ukraine in defense 
of its nation. I believe we must sustain 
that assistance as long as Ukrainians 
fight for a democratic future free from 
Russian oppression. 
The defensive security assistance we 
have provided and continue to provide 
Ukraine to help fend off its autocratic 
invader is absolutely critical. 
Also, it is of utmost importance that 
we continue to surge humanitarian aid 
to Ukraine and the countries in the re-
gion accepting the growing influx of 
refugees. As of yesterday, nearly 700,000 
had left their homes, left their country 
to seek safety, unsure of whether they 
will ever again see their homes. Esti-
mates project that that number will 
quickly reach into the millions, as well 
as those who are displaced but remain 
in Ukraine. 
Our allies in Europe have acted admi-
rably, so they have been accepting 
those fleeing the destruction. We must 
do our part to help them as well. 
Amidst all the bloodshed, we are see-
ing astounding courage displayed by 
President 
Zelensky, 
the 
Ukrainian 
Government, 
and, 
above 
all, 
the 
Ukrainian people. We are also seeing 
the unity of the transatlantic alliance, 
more unified than ever in the face of 
Vladimir Putin’s war. 
The people of Ukraine must continue 
to hear a message of loud and clear 
support from us, the United States 
Congress. They must see that we see 
their suffering, that we stand with 
them in their fight against an authori-
tarian invader, and that we will con-
tinue to usher as much support to their 
cause as the United States can muster. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution outlines 
the plan and sheds an indisputable 
light on the atrocities the Putin re-
gime and the Russian military are 
committing. It demands an immediate 
cease-fire and full withdrawal of Rus-
sian forces from Ukraine. It backs ad-
ditional coordinated economic meas-
ures to hold Putin accountable. 
It reaffirms our NATO Article 5 com-
mitments, reaffirms Ukrainian sov-
ereignty over Crimea and Donbas. It 
highlights the unprecedented global 
multilateral efforts the Biden adminis-
tration has helped usher. 
It states our commitment in the 
United States Congress to support the 
Ukrainian people throughout this ter-
rifying ordeal and delivers perhaps the 
most important message a resolution 
can deliver right now, that the House 
of Representatives will never ever rec-
ognize any illegitimate government 
that Putin hopes to install in Ukraine. 
It is up to the Ukrainian people and 
the Ukrainian people alone to choose 
their political leadership and their fu-
ture. 
I support this resolution, and I want 
to offer my sincerest thanks to Rep-
resentative SPARTZ, but also to my 
ranking member. We worked diligently 
on this resolution, to make sure that 
this was a bipartisan resolution. I ap-
preciate Ranking Member MCCAUL for 
his friendship and the way that we 
work together now, especially on this 
resolution. 
Democrat and Republican leadership 
worked collectively also. For working 
with me, I want to thank them. They 
have worked with me for what I believe 
is a very strong message, a unified 
message, to support the people of 
Ukraine. 
It is also a unified message to Vladi-
mir Putin, whose objective was to di-
vide us. He would have loved to have 
divided us from our European allies, 
loved to divide us from NATO, loved to 
divide us from within. 
But with this resolution, it becomes 
crystal clear: Mr. Putin, you can’t win 
this. We are going to stand against 
you, and we are going to preserve de-
mocracy because that is what is at 
stake here. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just thank 
Chairman MEEKS
for his leadership. 
This is really a historic time, not for 
only this Nation, but the world, for 
Ukraine. It is a time when we come to-
gether, not as Republicans or Demo-
crats, but as Americans in strong sup-
port of the people of Ukraine. 
I also want to thank Congresswoman 
VICTORIA SPARTZ, who is from Ukraine, 
who knows this story firsthand, and 
who very passionately has told her 
story about what it means, a country 
that has endured Hitler, a country that 
has endured Stalin, and now a country 
that is enduring Mr. Putin and Russian 
aggression. 
As we stand here, Ukrainians are 
fighting for their country and for their 
very 
lives. 
Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
launched the largest attack in Europe 
since World War II. 
b 1430 
His war machine has unleashed a bru-
tal barrage of missiles and rockets on 
innocent Ukrainian civilians. In fact, 
there are 40 miles just north of Kyiv of 
tanks and military weaponry that is 
getting ready to go in and encircle the 
capital city. 
But the people of Ukraine are inspir-
ing the world with their bravery in the 
face of this, of Putin’s evil and 
unprovoked attack. Fathers and moth-
ers, teachers and shop owners, taxi 
drivers and students are all taking up 
arms, making Molotov cocktails, join-
ing Ukrainian soldiers to defend their 
country. 
They are standing in front of the 
tanks, standing in front of the tanks. I 
have seen a child standing in front of a 
tank just like Tiananmen Square and 
the images coming out that are sent 
around the world so we can all witness 
this, this war against humanity and 
human rights, war crimes. 
They are risking their lives to fight 
for freedom, and that is what this Na-
tion stands for, freedom and democ-
racy. 
Despite the terror inflicted upon 
them by Putin’s bombs and rockets, 
the 
Ukrainian 
people 
have 
coura-
geously refused to relent. Vladimir 
Putin has underestimated them. He has 
underestimated 
their 
strength 
and 
their bravery. The resiliency of the 
Ukrainian people has been an inspira-
tion, really, for the world. 
We were told in our briefings, well, 
this will last 2 or 3 days, but they have 
stood up. Putin needs to understand 
that he has miscalculated, and this will 
cost him a very, very high price. He 
has underestimated the strength and 
bravery to his own peril. 
So I am pleased that we are able to 
come together, not as Republicans or 
Democrats, as I said, but really, as 
Americans, as we should, to express 
and send a strong message in support 
of the people of Ukraine and against 
this tyrant and this monster who is 
savagely killing civilians, as I speak. 
We have all seen the images of the 
women and the children and the refu-
gees as they leave their fathers and 
husbands behind who are left to fight 
this war.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1249 
March 2, 2022 
This resolution really does one thing: 
to tell the world in one united voice 
that the United States of America 
stands opposed to oppression, that we 
stand with the people of Ukraine, and 
we stand against Mr. Putin’s aggres-
sion. We must ensure that Putin fails, 
and I believe long term, he will. 
I am hopeful that today’s resolution 
will also lead to additional construc-
tive bipartisan steps to properly arm 
the Ukrainians in any way possible, as 
they have told us, we don’t need your 
troops, but we need your weapons to 
fight against the Russians. 
You know, there was a tweet that 
came out from a dead Russian soldier 
who sent a text to his mother, saying, 
I thought they were going to welcome 
us, that we were liberating them. And 
yet I am seeing Ukrainians and chil-
dren being run over by our tanks. And 
he says to his mother, this is the worst 
thing I have ever seen. 
He lies. He is deceptive. He lied to his 
own people that he is liberating these 
Ukrainians who are oppressed by the 
Russians. This is no liberation. This is 
not a liberation ceremony. 
This is tyranny at its worst, and op-
pression. We need to continue to sup-
port them as long as even one Ukrain-
ian citizen continues to stand up to 
Russia’s tyranny. 
As in February 1941, facing a dev-
astating bombing campaign by the 
Nazis—we can see the parallels here— 
this is similar to Hitler invading Po-
land. 
When they talked about the blitz, 
Winston Churchill made a direct plea 
to the United States for assistance, and 
it is timeless. It actually resonates 
today. He said, ‘‘Put your confidence in 
us. . . . We shall not fail or falter; we 
shall not weaken or tire. Neither the 
sudden shock of battle, nor the long- 
drawn trials of vigilance and exertion 
will wear us down. Give us the tools, 
and we will finish the job.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is what the Ukrain-
ian people want. It is what they are 
asking for. It is what they need. It is 
what the United States of America and 
our NATO allies will deliver. 
Today, 
facing 
the 
onslaught 
of 
Putin’s missiles and tanks, the Ukrain-
ian President, Zelensky, a most coura-
geous leader, as we have seen, who 
didn’t run away from his country like 
President Ghani. He is in the bunker 
right now, knowing that his very life 
and his survival is on the line. 
He made the same plea to us, and 
today, we have the opportunity to tell 
Ukraine that we have confidence in 
them by supporting this measure, that 
we will give them the tools they need 
to finish the job. 
So let me, once again, thank the 
chairman. This is when the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee is at its best, when we 
come together as Americans. As ELIOT 
ENGEL always said, partisanship stops 
at the water’s edge, and I firmly be-
lieve that commitment as well. 
I urge my Members to support this. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS: Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), who just re-
cently was walking the streets of Kyiv, 
talking to the people, listening to 
them, and their determination to pre-
serve 
their 
democracy. 
Mr. 
DAVID 
CICILLINE. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MEEKS for his extraordinary 
leadership in this very important mo-
ment. 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 956 
and in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. 
On 
February 
24, 
Vladimir 
Putin 
thought he was making another step 
toward realizing his delusional pursuit 
of reconstituting the U.S.S.R. when he 
ordered the brutal invasion of the sov-
ereign and peaceful nation of Ukraine. 
Vladimir Putin thought the Ukrain-
ian people would give in quickly to the 
violence and abandon their freedoms. 
Vladimir Putin thought President 
Zelensky would flee and capitulate to 
Russian demands. 
Vladimir Putin thought the world 
would turn a blind eye toward Russian 
aggression. 
Vladimir Putin thought wrong. 
In fact, as Chairman MEEKS said, we 
saw firsthand the determination and 
the will of the Ukrainian people to 
fight to preserve their own country and 
their own freedoms. They are doing 
that today, fighting day by day, hour 
by hour, to protect their country and 
secure a free and democratic future for 
themselves and their families. 
The free world has rallied together to 
impose devastating sanctions against 
Russia, against the Russian economy, 
and to hold the Putin regime and his 
enablers to account for their crimes. 
I strongly support this resolution, 
and I know the United States and its 
allies are united behind the people of 
Ukraine, behind the values of freedom 
and democracy and against the tyr-
anny of a thuggish dictator, Vladimir 
Putin. 
I thank Chairman MEEKS for his ex-
traordinary 
leadership 
and 
thank 
Ranking Member MCCAUL as well. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
SPARTZ), the lead Republican on this 
resolution, who was born and raised in 
Ukraine. Her grandmother is still there 
and has told her the stories of Hitler 
and Stalin and how bad this situation 
is on the ground. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I am 
very humbled to stand on the floor of 
this great institution with my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle to 
co-lead this important resolution and 
to show that this greatest country, the 
leaders of the free world, are going to 
stand up to the atrocities and tyr-
annies that are happening right now. 
I am very proud to have a strong, 
freedom-fighting Ukrainian heritage. I 
actually was born in the Soviet Union, 
when Ukraine was under that evil 
country. 
I am so proud that strong, brave 
Ukrainians are willing to fight again 
and again to be free. It should inspire 
all of us. Their bravery and actions are 
unbelievable. It should teach us, and 
maybe remind us, what it means to be 
a free country and how hard it is to get 
your rights and freedoms back when 
you lose them. We had so many people 
die for our freedoms, so let’s value and 
cherish them. 
I am very happy to see that this in-
stitution, when times are tough, when 
we have to get together, we can get to-
gether and show our allies we will 
stand together and show our adver-
saries and enemies we will stand to-
gether. Not just stand together, but we 
will also lead the world. 
I also want to tell the Ukrainian peo-
ple that the American people are in-
spired and humbled. They see your 
struggles and pray with you and stand 
with you. This resolution from we, the 
people, from this United States Con-
gress, is evidence of it. 
I also want to tell the Russian peo-
ple—I actually have some Don Cossack 
heritage—I know it is tough for you. I 
know what President Putin has done to 
you. It is awful. But you need to have 
the backbone to stand up, or we will 
find you in history worse than you 
could imagine. So you stand up and 
stop this atrocity before it causes more 
damage. What is happening there on 
the ground, it is not a war. It is slaugh-
tering, killing of the Ukrainian people. 
You are killing your fellow Orthodox 
Christians and East Slavs, and they 
went through history with oppression 
and suppression. How can you stand 
with that? I know that your propa-
ganda is strong. I know they tell you 
things that are awful. But open your 
eyes. Don’t be part of it. Tell your gov-
ernment that they have to stop this 
elimination and extinction of people. 
I also want to thank everyone here in 
this country for loving freedoms, for 
supporting freedoms, and being willing 
to be part of this challenge on the right 
side. Our actions should be decisive. In 
times like this, they require strong 
leadership and strong actions. 
We, as an independent branch of our 
Government—I always say we are co- 
equal, but first among equals because 
we do have the power of the purse and 
the power of war. So we have a lot of 
powers for a reason, and that is why 
our Founding Fathers gave us this 
power, because we are the people who 
should put pressure on our President to 
be more decisive and strong and have 
some stronger actions. 
On sanctions, we have to be tougher. 
We need to go after the energy sector. 
We need to make sure that a lot of 
oligarchs that are not on the list are 
there, they should be on the list, the 
key oligarchs. They understand that it 
is not just the Russian people that will 
be feeling the pain, that already they 
suppressed and stole money from them, 
but they will start feeling the pain. 
We also need to make sure that we 
will have a way to affect the financial 
system much more decisively.

We also need to make sure that these 
war crimes are going to go to inter-
national courts, and these people that 
make decisions on killing, on genocide, 
and using illegal weapons will also bear 
some responsibility. 
b 1445 
I also think we have a responsibility 
to provide safe passage in the humani-
tarian corridor, and I hope we will have 
other allies working with us and help 
us on that. 
But most important, we need to 
make sure that we will provide proper 
defensive legal aid to the Ukrainians 
that they can defend themselves from 
this extermination before it is too late. 
We must act, and I am very honored to 
be part of this effort to show that we 
are willing to lead as this institution. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ALLRED), who was walking the 
streets of Ukraine with us just a few 
weeks ago. 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support this bipartisan resolu-
tion supporting the people of Ukraine. 
As the chairman said, I was in 
Ukraine just a few weeks ago, in the 
beautiful city of Kyiv. I met the very 
people who today, despite facing a 
ruthless enemy, are waging an inspir-
ing campaign to save their democracy, 
including a young woman who told me 
she was going to get her white wine 
and Kalashnikov and defend her coun-
try. And she is. 
This resolution tells the world, and 
most importantly the Ukrainian peo-
ple, that the United States Congress 
stands with you. President Biden has 
used every tool at his disposal to unite 
the world in punishing Vladimir Putin 
for his unprovoked and unjustified war, 
and Congress will act to provide more 
resources to that effort. 
Because our work continues to fur-
ther help Ukraine defend itself and fur-
ther isolate Russia. Putin has a choice: 
To pursue his long-term strategic goals 
or to continue this unnecessary and il-
legal war on Ukraine. He cannot do 
both. 
We are united as a country and as a 
Congress in standing with the people of 
Ukraine in their fight for their democ-
racy. I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH), a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee and one of 
the longest serving Members of Con-
gress as well. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, over the weekend I met with 
over 100 Ukrainian Americans in my 
district office in Freehold, New Jersey. 
They told me how their families and 
friends in Ukraine are coping with 
Putin’s barbaric invasion, the loss of 
life, the many who are wounded, and 
their escalating concern as the bombs 
and missiles rain down on civilian tar-
gets. 
According to UNHCR, about 876,000 
Ukrainian refugees have left, that is as 
of March 1st, and about half have found 
safety in Poland. Most are women, 
children, and the elderly. 
Despite facing an existential threat, 
the free world continues to be aston-
ished 
by 
the 
Ukrainian 
people’s 
strength, courage, resiliency, and de-
sire to fight. Interviews coming out of 
Ukraine, especially in the bunkers, un-
derscores the Ukrainian people’s re-
solve. 
Let me just say how great it is to see 
Zelensky, who has stood up. He is a 
true hero and a tenacious leader, the 
President of Ukraine. This is Putin’s 
war, and he is a war criminal, Mr. 
Speaker. Putin’s puppet in Belarus, 
Alexander Lukashenko, is also a war 
criminal, and like Serbian Slobodan 
Milosevic and President Charles Taylor 
of Liberia, they need to be prosecuted 
and held to account for their war 
crimes. 
I would remind my colleagues that in 
a 2014 speech, right here, to a joint ses-
sion of the Congress, Ukrainian Presi-
dent Petro Poroshenko did ask the 
Obama administration for military as-
sistance, which he did not get, to de-
fend against Putin’s invasion of Cri-
mea. He said, ‘‘One cannot win the war 
with blankets.’’ 
He got several standing ovations, all 
of us were on our feet. But he got only 
more blankets. Let’s learn from that. 
Last June, as Russia deployed more 
combat forces on the border, Politico 
and others reported that there were 
delays in providing the kind of mili-
tary aid that Zelensky really wanted. I 
did ask Deputy Secretary of State 
Wendy Sherman today for a timeline, 
on how did this all come about. Did he 
ask for more and did not get it? We 
need to know this to learn from it, so 
we get it right the next time. 
Mr. Speaker, over the weekend I met with 
over one hundred Ukrainian Americans at my 
district office in Freehold. 
They told me how their families and friends 
in Ukraine are coping with Putin’s barbaric in-
vasion—the loss of life, the wounded and es-
calating concern as bombs & missiles rain 
down on civilian targets. 
They appealed for help. 
The humanitarian crisis is exploding—both 
inside the country and for those seeking ref-
uge. 
As of March 1st, according to the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)—there 
are more than 876,000 Ukrainian refugees— 
with about half finding safety in Poland. 
Most are women, children, and the elderly. 
Despite facing an existential threat, how-
ever, the free world continues to be aston-
ished by the Ukrainian people’s strength, cour-
age, resiliency and desire to fight. 
Interviews coming out of Ukraine—including 
in bunkers—underscore the Ukrainian people’s 
resolve. 
Under their extraordinarily heroic and tena-
cious 
leader—President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky—the people of Ukraine are rallying 
to defend their beloved homeland. 
This is Putin’s war—and he is a war crimi-
nal. 
Putin’s 
puppet 
in 
Belarus—Alexander 
Lukashenko—is also a war criminal. 
And 
like 
Serbian 
President 
Slobodan 
Milosevic and President Charles Taylor of Li-
beria, they need to be prosecuted and held to 
account for war crimes. 
Now more than ever, the United States and 
our allies must provide much-needed military 
equipment and humanitarian aid to the people 
of Ukraine as they fight to defend their free-
dom from a brutal dictatorship. 
I would remind my colleagues that in a 2014 
speech to a joint session of the U.S. Con-
gress, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko 
asked the Obama Administration for military 
assistance—which he didn’t get—to defend 
against Putin’s invasion of Crimea and said 
‘‘One cannot win the war with blankets’’. 
He got several standing ovations—and more 
blankets. 
Last June, as Russia deployed more com-
bat forces on Ukraine’s border, Politico and 
others reported that a modest military aid 
package had been put on hold. Key items 
under consideration for the package included 
short-range air defense systems, small arms 
and more anti-tank weapons . . .’’ 
Robust stockpiles of weapons could have 
bought 
deterrence—and 
if 
necessary, 
a 
means for the Ukrainians to defend them-
selves from Putin’s violence. 
At a Foreign Affairs hearing earlier today, I 
asked Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sher-
man what Ukrainian President Zelensky asked 
for over the past year—including air defense 
systems—and what he did or didn’t get from 
the Biden Administration? 
Her response may come in a closed door 
hearing next week. 
Comprehensive economic sanctions must 
degrade Putin’s capacity to wage war. 
Some highly efficacious sanctions have not 
yet been imposed, however. 
Russian oil revenues help fuel Putin’s ag-
gression in Ukraine. Not a drop of Russian oil 
exports should reach our shores. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CASTRO), the chair of the Sub-
committee on International Develop-
ment, International Organizations, and 
Global Corporate Social Impact. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of House Resolu-
tion 956 to condemn Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. 
Earlier today, the United Nations 
General Assembly voted overwhelm-
ingly to condemn Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine and demand an immediate 
withdrawal 
of 
their 
forces 
from 
Ukraine. 
Only four nations out of 193 stood 
with Russia. 140 stood with Ukraine. 
The world is united in condemning this 
invasion, and the House of Representa-
tives must speak as one and lead the 
way. 
As we debate, Russian attacks on 
Ukrainian civilians continue. Hundreds 
of thousands huddle in bomb shelters. 
Over 600,000 Ukrainians have already 
fled the country. Vladimir Putin is on 
a disastrous quest to rebuild the Rus-
sian empire at the expense of Ukrain-
ian sovereignty. 
This should be a simple vote. 
Now is our chance to show that Con-
gress 
stands 
with 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine. Now is our time to do what is

right. That is why I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), the ranking member on 
the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, 
Central Asia, and Nonproliferation. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I also want 
to thank Chairman MEEKS and Rep-
resentative SPARTZ for their leadership 
on this very important measure. 
Last week, the world watched in hor-
ror as Vladimir Putin shattered the 
peace 
in 
Europe 
and 
began 
an 
unprovoked assault on Ukraine and its 
innocent people. Put simply, this is the 
largest land war in Europe since World 
War II, a war that we hoped would 
never come again. We cannot condemn 
this senseless, brutal, and illegal inva-
sion in strong enough terms. 
In the face of this onslaught, the 
Ukrainian people are demonstrating in-
credible bravery as Russia brings to 
bear its overwhelming military fire-
power, at least in terms of soldiers and 
weaponry and equipment. But in terms 
of the combatants on the ground, one 
side is fighting for conquest. The other 
side is fighting for their homes and 
their families, and most importantly, 
their freedom. 
Thus far, at least, freedom is pre-
vailing. The Ukrainians, and President 
Zelensky especially, are rallying the 
free world and demonstrating once 
again that free men and women would 
rather die than submit to the forces of 
tyranny. 
As we stand here today to support 
the people of Ukraine, let us remember 
that their fight for freedom is far from 
over. We must ensure that they get the 
support that they need, that Putin is 
held accountable for his war crimes— 
and they are war crimes—and that he 
does not snuff out forever the light of 
democracy in Ukraine because that is 
what he wants to do. Freedom must 
prevail. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the president of 
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 
who has seen with his own eyes the 
unity that we now have with our NATO 
allies. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the distinguished 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee and my friend, the distin-
guished ranking member. 
Today is a test for liberal democracy 
all over the world, and particularly for 
us as Americans because today we wit-
ness the cost in blood, sweat, and tears 
in the fight for freedom that liberal de-
mocracy represents and provides: The 
simple desire of another people to have 
what we have and that all too often we 
take for granted, the desire to be a free 
people, under no one’s shadow, under 
no one’s yoke, and they are willing to 
put their bodies on the line to fight for 
that simple principle. 
Weak punditry all too often has cast 
the opinion that liberal democracy is 
on the decline. Well, not in Ukraine 
and not here. And not with our allies 
and not at the United Nations. Because 
the scales have fallen from eyes. The 
threat is real, and so are the stakes. 
All of us today must be Ukrainian. 
All of us must join that fight. All of us 
must understand that freedom, liberal 
democracy are resilient but also frag-
ile. They must always be perfected but 
also defended. 
This resolution today is not just 
about an expression of congressional 
solidarity. It is a recommitment by 
this body in the principles that founded 
this Nation that another people are 
fighting for to gain today. 
I urge passage and proudly support 
this effort. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a sad day, a tragic day, as we witness 
the horrific images that are coming 
out of Ukraine. 
I was there just 41⁄2 short weeks ago. 
I met with President Zelensky. I lis-
tened to the people on the streets of 
Kyiv. President Zelensky is a lion of a 
leader. He has displayed courage to the 
West. When he said, ‘‘I don’t need a 
ride, I need ammunition,’’ I think that 
all of us should look at that, we should 
listen to that. The time to act is now. 
We don’t have time to wait. Now is the 
time to act to help our Ukrainian part-
ners. He didn’t ask for troops inside 
Ukraine. He is asking for help. 
I hope that we will put Midland over 
Moscow, as the President last night in 
this Chamber said that it is time to 
buy American product. Energy security 
is national security, and that is abso-
lutely what this body should be doing 
is putting our own energy security into 
the hands of our partners and allies so 
that they can defend and deter against 
the 
malign 
influence 
of 
Vladimir 
Putin. 
Our heart and our prayers go out to 
the people of Ukraine, and our thanks 
to President Zelensky for his leader-
ship. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), the cofounder and co- 
chair of the Ukraine Caucus, who has 
worked on this her entire congressional 
career. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MEEKS
for his unyielding 
leadership on this important bill and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL for setting a 
tone for this entire Congress that we 
succeed when we work together, par-
ticularly in a cause as great as this, 
liberty for a country that voted for 
independence. Thirty years ago, 90 per-
cent of the people voted to be inde-
pendent of tyrannical Russia, and 
today now they are fighting again. 
The bipartisan nature of this bill 
today would warm the hearts of great 
American leaders, like President and 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower or Gen-
eral George Marshall or President John 
Kennedy or President Ronald Reagan, 
because across Europe they fully un-
derstood how many American lives 
were given to the cause of liberty so 
that we, their descendants, would pass 
it on to our descendants. 
We are here today in that fight be-
cause Ukraine is the scrimmage line 
for liberty in Europe today. The valor 
of the people of Ukraine against the 
Russian state is extraordinary. Our 
young people are learning what the 
price of liberty is, sadly, and the people 
of Ukraine are inspiring the world. We 
think so much of their valor, their 
fight, and their desire to join the world 
of free nations. May God bless them 
and may God bless America, and thank 
you for understanding a united Amer-
ica always wins for liberty. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), a dynamic Rep-
resentative from the great State of 
Texas. 
b 1500 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding, and I 
rise enthusiastically to support H. Res. 
956 and as well to make mention of H. 
Res. 943 that was introduced by myself 
and STEVE COHEN on February 25. 
Let me salute this resolution that is 
bipartisan that immediately calls on a 
ceasefire by Putin. This is Putin’s war. 
H. Res. 943 has been affirmed by its call 
for the shutting down of our airways to 
Russian carriers, and that has been 
done. 
But the real point is that we are now 
standing firmly for democracy and the 
fight of individual grandmothers and 
young people and individual Ukrain-
ians with their bare hands and with 
their weapons that have been given to 
fight for democracy. But the real ques-
tion that we are also standing for, and 
thank you for the United Nations vote, 
is that Vladimir Putin is a war crimi-
nal who is killing children. 
Mitka, a parliamentarian that I met 
at the OSCE of which we were a part of 
meeting in Lithuania and Vienna, talk-
ing to the soldiers that were on the 
border of Belarus and Lithuania— 
thank you to those soldiers that are 
now placed, almost 100,000 U.S. sol-
diers—is that Putin is killing without 
cause. He is killing grandmothers. He 
is killing children. Can we tolerate this 
bloodshed? No, we will not. And we will 
stand with this resolution to demand 
that democracy stands in the region 
and that we denounce his actions. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H. Res. 956, a resolution condemning the 
unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered 
by Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian head of the 
Russian Federation against the sovereign na-
tion of Ukraine and supporting the right of the 
people of Ukraine to freely determine their fu-
ture, including their country’s relationship with 
other nations and international organizations, 
without interference, intimidation, or coercion 
by other countries.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1252 
March 2, 2022 
I thank the Chairman of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, Congressman MEEKS of New 
York, for introducing this bipartisan resolution 
and urge all Members to support it to show 
the solidarity of the people of the United 
States with the people of Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution be-
cause it calls upon and commends the Biden 
Administration to honor and abide by the com-
mitments undertaken by the United States pur-
suant to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, 
signed at Washington, District of Columbia, on 
April 4, 1949, and entered into force on Au-
gust 24, 1949. 
The resolution also commits this body to the 
promotion and protection of democratic val-
ues, transparent and accountable government 
institutions, and support for needed economic 
structural reforms in Ukraine, including in the 
fiscal, energy, pension, and banking sectors, 
among others. 
The resolution also calls upon and com-
mends the Biden Administration for assem-
bling and working with an international coali-
tion of the world’s leading nations to ensure 
that all nations refuse to recognize the illegal 
invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation 
and to ensure that the Russian Federation is 
held accountable and sustain maximum eco-
nomic damage from the imposition of sanc-
tions as a consequence of its utter disregard 
for international law and norms. 
I am particularly pleased that the Biden Ad-
ministration has adopted the recommendation 
advanced in H. Res. 943, a resolution I intro-
duced on February 25, 2002 condemning this 
unprovoked attack by the Russian Federation, 
to ban all Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, 
from entering the airspace of the United 
States or landing on its soil. 
The United States is strongly committed to 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity of Ukraine. 
The United States strongly supports efforts 
to assist Ukraine to defend its territory against 
military aggression by the Russian Federation 
and by separatist and paramilitary forces. 
Ukraine was the second-most populous and 
powerful of the fifteen republics of the former 
and disintegrated Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics and the hub of the union’s agricultural 
production, defense industries, and military ar-
senal. 
In the three decades since gaining its inde-
pendence, Ukraine has sought to forge its own 
path as a sovereign state and sought closer 
economic, social, and political ties with the 
free market and democratic nations of the 
West. 
Since 2013, the Russian Federation has un-
dertaken a campaign of political, economic, 
and military aggression against Ukraine, in-
cluding the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines 
Flight 17, a civilian airliner, by Russian-backed 
Ukrainian separatists using a Russian-made 
missile taking the lives of all 298 innocent per-
sons on board. 
In February 2014, the military of the Russia 
Federation, without merit or cause, invaded 
the eastern part of the free and independent 
country of Ukraine, including the Crimean Pe-
ninsula, and backed a separatist insurgency in 
the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine, where 
fighting has killed over 14,000 people. 
The United States, a strategic ally of 
Ukraine, reacted swiftly to the Russian inva-
sion, condemning the military action in strong 
and bipartisan fashion, and providing military, 
humanitarian, and non-military financial assist-
ance to the determined but beleaguered na-
tion of Ukraine, which since 2014 has totaled 
approximately $1.5 billion. 
On September 14, 2014, the House of Rep-
resentatives adopted H. Res. 726, a resolution 
supporting the right of the people of Ukraine to 
freely determine their future, including their 
country’s relationship with other nations and 
international 
organizations, 
without 
inter-
ference, intimidation, or coercion by other 
countries, and committed itself to solidarity 
with the people of Ukraine. 
Interference and unprovoked aggressions by 
the Russia Federation ordered and led by 
Vladimir Putin continued unabated, including 
the mobilization and stationing of 150,000 
Russian troops surrounding Ukraine and 
armed forces positioned in Belarus to attack 
Ukraine from the north, including war planes 
and offensive missile systems, and the move-
ment of Russian naval vessels in the Black 
Sea to Ukraine’s south, including amphibious 
assault ships, missile cruisers, and sub-
marines, and the positioning of blood and 
medical equipment into position on their bor-
der. 
Vladimir Putin sought authorization from the 
Russian parliament to use military force out-
side of Russian territory by staging a fraudu-
lent on-camera meeting of his Security Council 
to grandstand for the Russian public and by 
recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory as 
so-called independent republics in clear viola-
tion, again, of international law, all of which 
was intended to set the stage for further pre-
texts and further provocations by Russia Fed-
eration to make further aggressions against 
Ukraine by military action. 
Vladimir Putin rejected every good-faith ef-
fort the United States and its allies and part-
ners made to address mutual security con-
cerns through dialogue to avoid needless con-
flict and avert human suffering. 
On February 23, 2022, the Russia Federa-
tion military, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, 
began a premeditated brutal assault on the 
people of Ukraine without provocation, without 
justification, without necessity, making out-
landish, false, and baseless claims that 
Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war 
against Russia and that Ukraine was prepared 
to use chemical weapons, and that Ukraine 
had committed a genocide. 
These actions were taken by Vladimir Putin 
at the very moment that the United Nations 
Security Council was meeting to stand up for 
Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, 
culminating in missile strikes on historic cities 
across Ukraine, followed by air raids and the 
invasion of Russian tanks and troops. 
Mr. Speaker, through this resolution the 
United States strongly condemns and opposes 
the unprovoked invasion and egregious act of 
aggression against sovereign state of Ukraine 
by the Russian Federation, the most provoca-
tive and destabilizing act of foreign aggression 
since the 1938 invasion of the Sudetenland by 
the Third Reich led by Adolph Hitler. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for H. 
Res. 956 to support the right of the people of 
Ukraine to freely determine their future, includ-
ing their country’s relationship with other na-
tions and international organizations, without 
interference, intimidation, or coercion by other 
countries. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), a dynamic Representa-
tive. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker. And I rise on this historic 
occasion to compliment the chair-
person and the ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. What they 
are doing today will be hailed in the 
annals of history as that which was 
necessary to help our friends in a time 
of need. 
Mr. Speaker, those who say that if 
we leave the world alone, the world 
will leave us alone are wrong. The 
world will find its way to our door just 
as it is now because Dr. King’s words 
are so right. Life is an inescapable net-
work of mutuality tied to a single gar-
ment of destiny. What impacts one di-
rectly impacts all indirectly. What is 
happening to Ukraine directly impacts 
us indirectly. 
We have a duty, a responsibility, and 
an obligation to help them and to 
make sure that when the final word is 
written, it will be said that we did all 
that we could to protect democracy. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, it is now 
my honor to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the distinguished majority leader of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the chairman of this com-
mittee, for yielding. We have traveled 
in various parts of the world together. 
We have seen pain, and we have seen 
progress. We are seeing pain now, and 
all I can say with respect to the re-
marks that were just made by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), amen. 
I thank Mr. MCCAUL for his working 
not as a Republican, and I thank Mr. 
MEEKS
not as a Democrat, but as 
Americans, Americans confronted with 
a crisis, a crisis for democracy, a crisis 
for the global community. I thank 
them both because they have, in the 
best traditions of this House and of 
this country, worked together to bring 
to the floor a resolution, which, indeed, 
speaks to the pain and to the moral re-
sponsibility of all those who love free-
dom and democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, as Russian 
missiles rained down on the cities of 
his country, Ukraine’s heroic Presi-
dent, President Zelensky, virtually ad-
dressed the European Parliament in 
Brussels. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
President 
Zelensky 
spoke of a horrendous missile attack 
that had just struck the main square of 
the besieged city of Kharkiv. ‘‘This,’’ 
he said, is ‘‘the largest square in Eu-
rope . . . it is called ‘freedom square.’ ’’ 
He went on to say: ‘‘And believe you 
me, in every square today, no matter 
what it is called, it is going to be called 
‘freedom square.’ In every city of our 
country. Nobody is going to break us. 
We are strong.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1253 
March 2, 2022 
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, he didn’t have 
to tell us that. We have seen that 
strength. We have seen that courage. 
We have seen that determination in the 
face of overwhelming force confronting 
them. 
These past 7 days, the people of 
Ukraine have indeed shown the world 
they are strong, they are courageous, 
they are united, and they are resolved 
to defend their freedom and their de-
mocracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I served as co-chairman 
of the Commission on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, otherwise known 
as the Helsinki Commission, for 10 
years from 1985 to 1995. It was a his-
toric time where democracy won the 
Cold War. It was in the final years of 
that Cold War that Ukraine in the 
nineties emerged and was guaranteed 
essentially by the international com-
munity, but certainly by Russia and 
the United States, that they would be a 
sovereign nation not just in the east 
but in the west as well. 
I had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, 
to travel to Kyiv, to Riga, to Vilnius, 
to Tallinn, to Sofia, to other cities be-
hind the Iron Curtain on a relatively 
regular basis during those 10 years, cer-
tainly in the 6 years from 1985 to 1991. 
In each place I saw a ‘‘freedom square’’ 
where either before or shortly after my 
visit people would gather to demand 
the right to choose their own future, 
their own leaders, and their own laws. 
I saw in many others who traveled to 
those cities and to those countries a 
yearning, I saw the commitment to de-
mocracy, their courage and determina-
tion. 
President 
Zelensky 
is 
correct: 
‘‘Wherever democracy thrives, every 
public square is a ‘freedom square.’ ’’ It 
may have another name, but it is a 
‘‘freedom square.’’ 
Americans have sacrificed much over 
the generations to secure our freedoms 
and to our great credit the freedom of 
others around the world. 
I tell people, Mr. Speaker, that 
America is the nation that had the 
most hegemony of power and used it so 
without acquiring the nations that it 
protected or imposing its will on the 
nations that it protected which is the 
least acquisitive superpower in the his-
tory of the world. 
Americans have sacrificed much over 
the generations to secure our freedoms 
and the freedoms of others. The land of 
the free and the home of the brave. 
Now, the tyranny and autocracy of 
Vladimir Putin tests us again. 
Though American forces will not be 
engaged directly in this war, that does 
not mean that America is sitting on 
the sidelines. Far from it. And we must 
be engaged. This resolution speaks to 
engagement. 
President Biden has unified not only 
NATO but a broad coalition of the 
world’s democratic nations and those 
committed to the post-war order of re-
specting peace, borders, and, yes, diplo-
macy. 
Dozens of nations have partnered to 
stand up to Putin and to support the 
freedom fighters in Ukraine. Together, 
we have imposed punishing sanctions 
that are already hurting Putin’s re-
gime. 
We are already seeing thousands of 
Russians taking to the streets in their 
country to demand that Putin end this 
unjust war, this unprovoked war, this 
criminal war, and stop the unnecessary 
death and destruction on both sides for 
which Vladimir Putin alone bears re-
sponsibility. 
Today, this House, the people’s House 
representing the greatest democracy in 
history, the leading democratic nation 
in the world, is expressing our support 
for the Ukrainian people in their strug-
gle for freedom and self-government. 
I hope and I urge that this resolution 
pass with not a single negative vote. 
Let there be no mistake throughout 
the globe that, yes, we have differences 
between Republicans and Democrats, 
but we in this House are all Americans 
committed to freedom, committed to 
democracy, committed to the peaceful 
relations between nations. 
It recognizes the egregious and inhu-
mane actions undertaken by the Rus-
sian military at Putin’s command, in-
cluding the shelling of civilian targets 
and the killing of innocents in order to 
instill fear and weaken Ukrainian re-
solve. 
We know that resolve, however, Mr. 
Speaker, will not be broken. We have 
seen it in the eyes of the President, and 
we have seen it in the eyes of the citi-
zens in those freedom squares. 
This resolution further recognizes 
importantly that Russian aggression 
against Ukraine did not begin last 
week. It began as soon as the Ukrain-
ian people rejected a Putin-backed au-
tocrat, established a true democracy, 
and sought the security and protection 
of stronger bonds with its fellow de-
mocracies in Europe and NATO, which, 
of course, it had every right as a sov-
ereign nation to do. 
Putin sent his forces to occupy Cri-
mea. Mr. Speaker, in my view we were 
not as determined that that should not 
happen at that time. We must not re-
peat that mistake. Putin instigated a 
violent, separatist uprising in the 
Donbas region that has festered for 8 
long years. 
His unprovoked and unjustifiable in-
vasion of Ukraine comes after it be-
came increasingly clear that the sepa-
ratists could not achieve Putin’s ex-
pansionist aims on their own. He tried 
to do it surreptitiously through agents. 
It did not succeed, so he took the next 
step, a tragic, criminal step. 
This resolution also makes clear that 
the United States will continue to sup-
port Ukraine by providing both mili-
tary 
and 
humanitarian 
assistance 
while maintaining painful sanctions 
against Putin for as long as he pursues 
this war of choice. 
In no small part, this resolution puts 
into action the promise that President 
Kennedy made when he took office at 
the height of the Cold War. 
This will not be a free war for any of 
us in the free world. It is going to cost 
us something. Gas prices may go up. 
But we want to stand on freedom’s 
side. 
I am in politics largely because John 
Kennedy ran for President as I was at 
the University of Maryland, and I was 
inspired by his call to service. 
I would urge all of you to read one 
more time John Kennedy’s inaugural 
address. It is an extraordinarily inspir-
ing address, an address not only to the 
American people, but to the entire 
world. And in it he said this: ‘‘Let 
every nation know, whether it wishes 
us well or ill, that we shall pay any 
price, bear any burden, meet any hard-
ship, support any friend, oppose any foe 
to assure the survival and success of 
liberty,’’ and of those freedom squares 
to which President Zelensky referred. 
b 1515 
Mr. Speaker, Americans and our al-
lies are being asked to pay a price, to 
bear a burden, to meet some hardship 
in the days and weeks and months 
ahead, not to sustain fire, not to live in 
buildings being bombed, not to have to 
move from their home to a refuge or 
another country, but some hardship. 
I know that our fellow Americans are 
up to the task. They have always been 
up to the task because those who say 
we take freedom for granted, who say 
the cost is too high, the burden too 
great, have always underestimated the 
American people. 
When we see Putin’s corrupt, evil, 
and menacing grab for power and ty-
rannical control, we are reminded of 
the tyrants and evil ideologies that 
Americans have fought and vanquished 
through our collective commitment 
and shared sacrifices. 
Mr. Speaker, today, let us make this 
House Freedom Square. Let us stand 
with those who are assaulted by a ty-
rant. 
The generation before mine, John 
Kennedy referred to England as ‘‘Why 
England Slept.’’ If we do not meet this 
tyrant now, we will pay greatly later. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
these brave Ukrainians who stand for 
freedom and liberty and international 
law. Let us all overwhelmingly, unani-
mously vote for this resolution and 
send a message, not just to Putin but 
to all the tyrants of the world who 
would test us once again, that we will 
not blink. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for 
his remarks. I think it is very impor-
tant this Chamber passes this resolu-
tion unanimously to send one voice to 
Putin that the American people stand 
for the Ukrainian people and against 
Mr. Putin. 
I think it is no coincidence—to me, it 
is fitting—that today is Texas Inde-
pendence Day. My forefathers fought 
for freedom and liberty for the same 
purpose, from tyranny. 
Since 2014, the world has watched the 
Ukrainian people fight to forge their 
own destiny in the face of violent at-
tacks by Russia. They are facing down

Putin’s missiles and tanks, risking life 
and limb for their freedom today. 
As President Zelensky warned the 
Russian troops invading his country 
just a few days ago, as he sits in the 
bunker, putting his life on the line, he 
said: ‘‘If they try to take our country, 
our freedom, our lives, the lives of our 
children, we will be defending our-
selves. . . . As you attack, it will be 
our faces you see, not our backs.’’ 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
honor his leadership and the bravery of 
the Ukrainian people, to send a strong 
message to these brave men and women 
that they are not alone, that the 
United States stands with them and 
will continue to stand with them for as 
long as it takes. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the camera of history is 
rolling on all of us today. What is hap-
pening today children yet unborn will 
be studying and looking at what we 
did, what we stood for, or did not. They 
will be studying in their history books 
whether or not when democracy was at 
stake, when sovereign nations were in 
peril, whether or not we stood up and 
stood out to protect freedom, sov-
ereignty of states, independence, or 
not. 
The fact of the matter is, if we don’t 
stand up now, those same children that 
I am talking about may not be able to 
live in a democratic society. That is 
why this is so important. 
Putin may think that he is encircling 
Kyiv now, but this United Nations 
vote, where 141 nations said they are 
not going to allow that to happen, is 
encircling Putin and his thugs. And we 
will stay there for as long as it takes 
until freedom rings because that is 
what this is all about. 
I think of today those that I met 
when I was in Kyiv, those that I had 
dinner with, those that worked in our 
U.S. Embassy, those that were driving 
taxis. As I see the pictures of them 
walking these streets today in front of 
Russian tanks, unafraid—I saw a pic-
ture of a woman standing and pointing 
at a Russian soldier, saying they would 
die there before she gives up. That is 
what this is all about. 
The words that the activist told me 
while I was in Kyiv, that we are ready 
to fight, just provide us the support 
that we need to protect our country 
and freedom. 
Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine and 
its people. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCCAUL 
and Congresswoman SPARTZ for work-
ing with me so that we can make a bi-
partisan message right here on the peo-
ple’s floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 956. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 426, nays 3,

HONORING OUR PROMISE TO AD-
DRESS COMPREHENSIVE TOXICS 
ACT OF 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 3967) to 
improve health care and benefits for 
veterans exposed to toxic substances, 
and for other purposes, is postponed. 
f 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 6886 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to remove the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP) as a 
cosponsor of H.R. 6886. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
f 
TIME TO SERVE OUR VETERANS 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to our 
veterans who served in or near the 
Panama Canal Zone during the Viet-
nam war. 
Hundreds of these veterans came 
home with major health issues after 
being exposed to deadly herbicides like 
Agent Orange and Agent Purple. Yet, 
to this day, they are not eligible to re-
ceive Federal benefits and disability 
compensation. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to say 
that we are one step closer to changing 
that. Today, I was proud to pass my 
amendment requiring the Department 
of Defense to study this issue, which is 
the first step to ensuring that these 
veterans finally will receive the care 
and benefits they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, these veterans hon-
orably served our Nation. Now, it is our 
turn to serve them and get this done. 
f 
HARRIET TUBMAN 200TH 
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the bicenten-
nial birthday of a true American hero, 
Harriet Tubman. 
Born in Dorchester County, in Mary-
land’s First Congressional District, 
Harriet Tubman is best known as the 
conductor of the Underground Rail-
road. Born a slave, Tubman escaped 
and risked her own freedom to guide 
countless other slaves to freedom at 
great personal risk. 
In honor of her life achievement, in 
the next few weeks, numerous events 
will be held in and around Dorchester 
County to celebrate her 200th birthday. 
The Harriet Tubman State Park and 
Visitor Center will be hosting discus-
sions with archaeologists and histo-
rians, as well as conducting walking 
tours, live music events, artifact dis-
plays, and a film premiere. 
As we close out Black History Month 
and begin Women’s History Month, I 
urge my colleagues and all Americans 
to join me in honoring the memory of 
Harriet Tubman. She truly embodied 
the American spirit. From her thirst 
for freedom to her courage under fire 
and her passion for helping her fellow 
man, she is an example to us all. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the opportunity to celebrate her here 
today on the floor of the people’s 
House. 
f 
HONORING BARBARA CURRAN 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. I rise to recognize 
the Honorable Barbara Curran, a life-
long public servant from New Jersey 
who broke many glass ceilings. 
Barbara was an accomplished schol-
ar, even earning her law degree in the 
evenings as a single mom. Entering the 
world of politics as a woman in the 
1970s, she was a force. Barbara was the 
first woman to serve in all three 
branches of the New Jersey govern-
ment—as assemblywoman, as a mem-
ber of the Governor’s cabinet, and as a 
superior court judge. She was referred 
to as the ‘‘blue elephant’’ for her com-
mitment to bipartisanship. 
Barbara cherished time with family 
and never missed an opportunity to 
send encouraging handwritten notes. 
At times, she was even called off the 
bench to take a call from her daughter. 
I am grateful for the role model Bar-
bara was to me and to so many who 
saw a path forward in politics through 
her example, and a glimpse at how to 
balance being a parent with the de-
mands of public service. 
In January, Barbara Curran passed 
away peacefully. My heart is with her 
daughter, Katie; her son-in-law, Pat-
rick; and her grandchildren, Duke, 
Marrin, Lilah, and Moira. 
I was honored to know Barbara, and 
she will be dearly missed. 
f 
STATE OF THE UNION LACKED 
TANGIBLE PLANS 
(Mrs. BICE OF Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in response to 
President Biden’s State of the Union 
address. 
While I appreciated that Biden em-
phasized the importance of continuing 
to support Ukraine, overall, his speech 
was a lot of talk without tangible plans

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1258 
March 2, 2022 
to solve the numerous issues that are 
devastating the Nation. 
The President’s speech didn’t address 
the root causes of inflation, a crisis 
that is crushing many American fami-
lies. 
I found it ironic that Biden talked 
about 
securing 
the 
border 
when, 
throughout his entire time in office, he 
has actively ignored the unprecedented 
number of illegal crossings, which are 
due to his open border policies cur-
rently in place. 
Finally, I am incredibly disappointed 
that he made no plan to restore Amer-
ican energy independence. We can 
produce affordable, reliable, and sus-
tainable energy right here at home in 
States like my home State of Okla-
homa. 
Frankly, his address focused a lot on 
rehashing and disguising Build Back 
Better while lacking concrete solutions 
to the pressing issues negatively im-
pacting the lives of American people. 
f 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, at 
last night’s State of the Union, Presi-
dent Biden had every reason to cite his 
extraordinary job creation record, the 
fastest job growth in U.S. history. 
After only one year in office, the Presi-
dent’s American Rescue Plan was at 
the center of this achievement. Our 
economic growth was the fastest in 
nearly 40 years. As a result, the United 
States had a faster recovery than every 
other advanced economy in the G7. 
This progress has been made even 
while the United States is trying to de-
feat COVID–19. As chair of the Sub-
committee on Highways and Transit, I 
was particularly pleased to hear the 
President 
emphasize 
infrastructure, 
making goods move faster and cheaper, 
because this can only add to the his-
toric 
job 
creation 
record 
he 
has 
achieved. 
f 
CALIFORNIA’S DEVASTATING 2021 
FIRE SEASON 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out to the Members 
here tonight once again that California 
had a very devastating fire season last 
year. The whole Western States of 
America have. 
The Dixie fire alone was nearly 1 mil-
lion acres in my district. Several other 
fires add up into the six-digit figures. 
What we really need to do is have the 
United States Forest Service identify a 
fire within the first 24 hours of when a 
fire occurs and then pounce on it and 
put the fire out—no more monitoring 
fire. 
Some other colleagues and I will be 
looking at legislation to put that in 
place. We were promised by the Forest 
Service that would be their policy. We 
need to enforce that. We need to have 
that be the dedication they have to-
ward taking care of these Federal 
lands. 
Indeed, there are multi-uses for peo-
ple, for timber, for preservation. But 
when they go up in smoke, it just be-
comes a horrific environmental prob-
lem: first, air quality, and then the 
ash, the silt that is going to wash into 
our streams and oceans and water stor-
age. 
The Forest Service needs to get on 
the job. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE PACT ACT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the PACT Act that 
Chairman TAKANO and the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs brought before us 
today. I was very pleased to vote for it. 
When those who go to serve our coun-
try abroad or even here at home come 
back to civilian life, they often carry 
with them the injuries of toxic expo-
sure, such as burn pits, and we have a 
moral obligation for their care. 
Madam Speaker, to shift to a dif-
ferent subject, as we watch the slaugh-
ter in Ukraine, I would urge the Gov-
ernment of the United States and the 
President of the United States to mobi-
lize our National Guard Partnership for 
Peace programs across the various 
States. Ohio is linked to Serbia and 
Hungary, and Illinois to Poland. 
There are ways for us as a country to 
use idle aircraft, like C–130 sitting on 
the ground in this country, where the 
American people want to donate blan-
kets and bandages in ways of caring for 
those who are being killed and injured, 
who are hungry in the Nation of 
Ukraine. That is an unrealized asset we 
have. 
We could do that overnight if we had 
the will to do it, the Partnership for 
Peace, the State Partnership for Peace, 
which is part of the U.S. Department of 
Defense under the National Guard Bu-
reau. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the President 
to help us help Ukraine.

SECURE THE BORDER 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I was 
shocked when President Biden said ‘‘we 
need to secure the border’’ during his 
State of the Union address. In his first 
year in office, over 2 million illegal im-
migrants were apprehended at the 
southern 
border, 
deportations 
de-
creased by 70 percent, and 11,000 mi-
grants were arrested who had previous 
criminal convictions. 
Actions speak louder than words, and 
when Mr. Biden halted construction of 
President Trump’s border wall and at-
tempted to reverse the remain in Mex-
ico policy, we knew that he didn’t want 
to secure the border. The Biden admin-
istration’s open border policies put im-
mense strain on law enforcement as 
they work to combat the fentanyl cri-
sis wreaking havoc on our commu-
nities. 
In fact, Cumberland County, Ten-
nessee, Sheriff Casey Cox recently took 
a trip to the southern border to gain a 
better understanding of the issue after 
a local 18-year-old woman died of a 
fentanyl overdose. Much like on my 
own trips to the border, Sheriff Cox ob-
served how understaffed and ill-pre-
pared we are to face the crisis under 
the Biden administration. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the President 
to back up his words with action and 
do what he said: secure the border. 
f 
AMERICANS CANNOT MAKE ENDS 
MEET 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, last night President Biden delivered 
a powerful speech on the state of our 
Union in this very Chamber. He out-
lined the historic achievements of the 
past year and spoke directly to the 
American people about his vision to 
continue building a better America. 
Despite the progress we have seen, 
too many of our fellow Americans still 
cannot make ends meet. Too many 
families are struggling to afford rising 
food, childcare, housing, and gas prices. 
And too many of our neighbors remain 
locked out of the promise of America. 
I stand with President Biden in his 
call to continue building our economy 
from the bottom up and the middle 
out. It is time to lower costs for fami-
lies by reducing prescription drug 
prices, expanding access to affordable 
healthcare, and investing in pre-kin-
dergarten education. 
It is time to increase pay by raising 
the minimum wage and protecting the 
right to organize. And, yes, it is time 
to extend the child tax credit. 
Last night, I was honored to host 
Shaneice Ball of Cleveland as my guest 
for the State of the Union. As a State- 
tested nursing assistant and a mom of 
three with one on the way, Shaneice is 
the epitome of resilience, tenacity, and 
the American people’s ability to per-
severe through tough times. 
f 
WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
with regard to what is going on in 
Ukraine, I stand with everybody in 
saying it is an absolutely horrific

thing. If the United States can keep 
Ukraine and free Ukraine, that is what 
we should all be hoping and praying 
for. 
We heard a speech last night, in addi-
tion to the very relevant numbers, and 
in addition to the numbers of people 
dying in Ukraine and the people being 
injured, we cannot forget that every 
month in America another 90,000 people 
cross our southern border. We cannot 
forget that every month in America 
8,000 more people die of drug overdoses. 
We cannot forget in America, com-
pared to 3 years ago, we deport, every 
month, approximately 6,000 less people 
from this country for committing 
crimes. 
Madam Speaker, I realize a lot is 
going on around the world and it is 
easy to forget about it, but America 
should not allow its politicians to for-
get about this huge sea of people cross-
ing the border and the huge number of 
people dying of drug overdoses and the 
broken hearts of their parents, their 
siblings, and their children.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S ADDRESS TO 
THE NATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, yesterday President Biden 
stood in this very room and addressed 
a Nation during the State of the Union 
that was looking to the kind of unity, 
strength, and commitment that we 
heard last night. We saw a President 
who is concerned as our leader for the 
people. We saw a President who has the 
empathy for the families and what 
they have gone through because he, 
himself, has lived that experience. We 
saw a leader who is not afraid to stand 
up to those that threaten all we love. 
America sent a clear message to the 
world that the United States stands 
steady and steadfast with the people 
and government of Ukraine. We are 
united against the unforgivable, un-
just, and unprovoked Russian invasion. 
America is united against Putin, his 
actions, and what he represents. 
The difference is striking. The dif-
ference is striking as to what Putin 
represents with his strong-man men-
tality, with his autocracy, with his ha-
tred of those he does not know versus 
what America stands for. 
America stands for the embrace of 
democracy because it is democracy 
that looks to maintain that when a 
people elect their government, that 
when a people vote for a President, 
such as we have seen in Ukraine, that 
that democracy must be honored, and 
nobody should be allowed to take it 
away. President Putin is not allowed to 
take it away. 
We saw a President who is building 
bridges. He is building bridges across 
our country and the world. He is build-
ing actual bridges, the kind of bridges 
that will connect a school bus to the 
student who needs to get to school in 
my district. He is building the kind of 
bridges that needed to be fixed decades 
ago that are falling down right before 
our eyes when he goes to dedicate 
them. 
Those are real bridges that we need 
in America, that so many Presidents— 
the President before talked about 
bridges and infrastructure, but who de-
livered? President Biden delivered to-
gether with this Congress. He delivered 
together with a bipartisan House vote 
where we actually thought it was bi-
partisan because we got 10 Republicans 
in this House to vote for that Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. 
But the other kind of bridges he is 
building are equally important to talk 
about because those are the bridges of 
unity. Our former President, he cared 
about walls. He cared about walls that 
divide us. He cared about walls that did 
not do anything that we need. Instead, 
we now have a President who builds 
the bridges of unity. 
Imagine the kind of work and diplo-
macy that this President had to do to 
overcome the threats that the United 
States would leave NATO, which is 
what our former President tried to do. 
Imagine the unity that had to be called 
out and that had to be cajoled, given 
that this President was faced with 
overcoming from our former Presi-
dent’s admiration for Putin. Everyone 
might remember, he has even recently 
called him a genius. Right? 
Instead, we had a President that said 
no, and that called Putin what he real-
ly is, a man who is delusional about 
what you can accomplish with force. 
This President, President Biden, has 
united a world together to repel and to 
impose sanctions that you wouldn’t 
have imagined. 
The idea that we now have Switzer-
land saying: No, it is not right, we 
shall not stay neutral because this is 
so wrong. We must stand up against 
the darkness. We must stand with the 
American people who seek light. We 
will stand against those who seek dark-
ness. We stand against those who want 
to govern from a place of hatred and 
fear because we will govern from a 
place of love for our communities, of 
love for our families, of love for democ-
racy, and of love for the idea that we 
must be a world united in the pursuit 
of peace. 
Madam Speaker, I loved the fact that 
I was able to invite a virtual guest to 
the State of the Union. I was able to 
invite 
Victoria 
Dominguez 
as 
my 
hometown hero. My hometown hero 
comes from Cuba, New Mexico. I had 
the great fortune of visiting with Vic-
toria Dominguez and the Cuba School 
District just the Friday before we flew 
out here. 
I can tell you, the love that Victoria 
Dominguez has for her community and 
for the children who attend her school 
is visible in that smile that she shares 
with you when she talks about them. 
Cuba is quite special because Cuba is 
nestled close to the mountains. The 
people of Cuba cut firewood to warm 
their home. The people of Cuba are 
connected with each other. 
The people of Cuba don’t necessarily 
have other resources. So when the pan-
demic hit, the children of Cuba did not 
have internet, they did not have the 
ability to remotely learn. The children 
of Cuba School Districts did not nec-
essarily have the nutrition they need-
ed, the supplies they needed to make it 
through that dark winter. 
But what did Cuba do? Cuba rallied. I 
love the fact that not only is Victoria 
Dominguez a hero, but the bus drivers 
of Cuba, New Mexico, are heroes. They 
have appeared on the cover of Time 
magazine because of the work they did. 
You see them standing in front of their 
buses because those school buses— 
working together with Cuba CARES— 
which 
our 
beautiful 
Victoria 
Dominguez 
organized—those 
school 
buses took to the students and their 
families the work that they needed for 
their schools. They took them the food 
that they needed to nourish their bod-
ies so that they could also nourish 
their brains. They took them what 
they needed. 
The thing is that as we are coming 
out of COVID—thank you, thank you— 
as we are coming out of COVID and we 
are learning to handle and to respond 
to it, as we are able to remove our 
masks, Cuba CARES isn’t going away 
because we know that caring for your 
community is not something you do 
once and walk away from. 
I know that Victoria Dominguez is 
going to continue caring for those 
beautiful children who attend the Cuba 
schools. I am so pleased to talk about 
the work that Victoria Dominguez does 
because it is the epitome of what we 
want to support within the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus because this 
is the Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus’ Special House. 
This is when we want to talk about 
the way in which we can promote and 
move agendas that focus on our com-
munities. That we can promote and 
pursue policy that comes from a place 
of love, that is about creating opportu-
nities, that is about imagining the pos-
sibilities, as President Biden said last 
night. That is what we need to do as a 
government. 
The last thing I want to say about 
our wonderful hometown hero is that 
Victoria Dominguez received both her 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
social 
work degrees from New Mexico High-
lands University.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1260 
March 2, 2022 
I need to give a shout-out to New 
Mexico Highlands University because 
my father received his degrees from 
New Mexico Highlands University. My 
mother went to school when she had 
seven kids and she worked so hard on 
that typewriter, and it would imprint 
those letters on her head. We would 
tease my mother, but she got that de-
gree from New Mexico Highlands Uni-
versity. 
New Mexico Highlands University is 
rated as one of the top—number 19—of 
those 
minority-serving 
institutions 
that help elevate their students from 
one socioeconomic ring to another. It 
is a minority-serving institution that 
is key in the upward ladder of social 
mobility. 
b 1730 
Now, the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus had some very key priorities, 
and I am so pleased to talk about the 
manner in which we have addressed 
those priorities. 
We believe that it is very important 
that we strengthen the care economy 
and that we invest in Medicaid home- 
and community-based services. We are 
going to make sure that we do not give 
up on the image of making sure that 
childcare is a universal benefit; that we 
cap out-of-pocket childcare costs so no 
family pays more than 7 percent of 
their household income; and that we 
provide the kind of training and sup-
port so that those children are cared 
for often and most often by women and 
often and most often by women of color 
and often by immigrant women; and 
that these caretakers of our most pre-
cious gifts—our children—will receive 
the pay that they deserve. 
We are not giving up on our impor-
tance of making investments—bold in-
vestments—in housing because we need 
that housing. 
When I was in Cuba, guess what they 
asked about? 
They asked about the importance of 
getting housing for their teachers at 
Cuba School. They want teacherages. I 
went and visited the Presbyterian Med-
ical Services where those doctors, 
nurses, and clinical workers serving 
their community were, and I said: 
What do you need? 
They said: We need housing for those 
so that they can come and work here 
because we are not close to a city cen-
ter. When we go and we visit Santa Fe, 
Taos, Las Vegas, all the different com-
munities in my large district and all of 
the communities in the districts of our 
hundred strong Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus members, housing comes 
up over and over and over again. 
So we are going to continue to fight 
so that we have housing choice vouch-
ers. We are going to continue to fight 
so that we address the backlog of pub-
lic housing. We want to make sure that 
we create affordable housing and that 
it is available so that we can begin cre-
ating the kind of wealth that families 
need when they are able to acquire a 
home of their own, because a home is 
one of the best ways of both providing 
that warmth and that care for your 
family and building wealth for not only 
yourself but future generations. 
I loved it last night when that Presi-
dent of ours focused on what do we 
need; and, yes, we need to focus on low-
ering drug prices. We need to use those 
savings to expand the availability of 
health to all because who, who should 
pay the outrageous sums that too 
many pay, including his special guest 
last night, for diabetes? 
We have said we need to cap it. I am 
proud that New Mexico has already 
capped it at $25. But not all States are 
as forward thinking as New Mexico, 
and so I applaud the President for his 
initiative that we cap it at $30 a month 
for insulin because it must not be 
something that we read in the papers 
where too many people ration their in-
sulin. And if you ration your insulin, 
you can die. 
If you ration your insulin, your 
health condition will worsen. You may 
lose your limbs, you may lose your life. 
And I have seen those who have lost 
their limbs, and I have seen those who 
for the rest of their lives are attached 
to dialysis because they could not af-
ford to pay for the insulin that they 
needed to treat their diabetes. 
Madam Speaker, we want to make 
sure that we make bold investments in 
climate jobs and that those invest-
ments go to the most impacted com-
munities. It is not and never has been 
a choice of jobs or environment. We 
can have both. 
I am very proud of the orphaned well 
bill that I introduced. It is called the 
Orphaned Well Cleanup and Jobs Act. 
In the Senate, Senator LUJA´ N has been 
carrying this mantle, and he intro-
duced the REGROW Act. Out of these 
two bills we saw $4.7 billion invested 
into cleaning up orphaned wells be-
cause orphaned wells don’t do anything 
for anybody. What they represent is 
that companies walked away from 
their obligation, from their legal obli-
gation, from their obligation to the 
communities where they dug those 
wells, where they drilled those wells, 
and where they pumped oil and gas 
from those wells. They walked away 
from their obligation to plug that well 
and to remediate the land around it 
once they were done. 
Those wells threaten our water table. 
They threaten our ability to have clean 
water when we turn on that tap. And 
very, very sadly, they worsen the cli-
mate crisis. What comes out of those 
wells when they are doing nothing for 
nobody—nothing 
for 
anybody—what 
comes out of them is the venting of 
methane, the leakage of methane. You 
can smell it when you go near those 
wells, Madam Speaker. I have visited 
those wells, and they are in places 
where they should not be. They are 
next to schools, and that methane is 
simply leaking and leaking and leak-
ing. It is 28 times or more—more po-
tent—more potent than CO2. 
So we need to make those kinds of 
investments where we are both cre-
ating jobs and addressing the climate 
crisis. 
I was so pleased when we heard the 
President speak last night about immi-
gration reform, because let me tell 
you, Madam Speaker, there isn’t any-
body in this Chamber who hasn’t bene-
fited from the work of immigrants. 
There isn’t anybody in this Chamber, 
except SHARICE DAVIDS and we had our 
wonderful Deb Haaland, who can’t say 
they are not descendants and daugh-
ters and granddaughters of immigrants 
at one time. I am a descendant and a 
granddaughter 
of 
immigrants 
even 
though I can trace my lineage back 17 
generations. But still they were immi-
grants then. 
They caused good things and bad 
things which we must recognize. That 
is our history. There was tension in our 
history. We have done both good and 
bad over the years, and we must recog-
nize it. 
But in terms of today, looking at 
what immigrants provide us, those 
Dreamers that we have are studying to 
be nurses, they are studying to be doc-
tors, they are studying to be teachers, 
and they are studying to be physicists, 
perhaps the engineers that will help us 
invent what we need to move on to the 
22nd century on a planet that still ex-
ists and a place we still love. We must 
provide for those Dreamers. We must 
make sure that DACA does not expire. 
This House did its job. This House 
passed the DREAM Act and sent it over 
to the Senate. But immigrants are not 
just students who will become our next 
teachers and nurses that we are sorely 
in need of right now. Immigrants are 
also those who care for our elderly, 
who care for our very young, who pick 
our fruits and vegetables, who clean 
the chickens and pork and prepare 
them to come to our supermarkets, and 
who stock those shelves. So we must 
also recognize that they are the essen-
tial workers who kept our regular lives 
going. 
When we were able to still get food 
from that supermarket, who was put-
ting their life on the line to provide it 
to us? 
It was immigrants. We must treat 
them with the respect that they de-
serve because they have fed all of us. 
So I was very pleased to listen to the 
President speak that we must do that. 
We are going to be calling upon the 
President because for some reason we 
could not get Republicans in the Sen-
ate—even though many of them sup-
ported these same immigration proce-
dures before—to vote to move those 
immigration bills forward. So we are 
faced with this Republican wall that 
divides. 
Why do we have these walls that di-
vide? 
Why do we have these walls that 
stunt progress? 
We will continue to meet, ask, and 
implore the President to lean into 
those words that he shared with us last 
night so that we can achieve through 
executive orders so much.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1261 
March 2, 2022 
I look forward to extending the tem-
porary protected status so that it ap-
plies not just to the countries from our 
American continents but also to those 
who are coming from Ukraine, because 
we cannot just condemn what Putin 
has done; we cannot just send the bil-
lion dollars that we have already sent 
to Ukraine for munitions and for as-
sistance; we cannot just do the more 
work that we have authorized today in 
this Chamber, but we must also recog-
nize that wars like this, that those who 
flee dangerous situations, those who 
flee their country, the place they love, 
with so little with them, that we have 
an obligation under international law 
and under our own law to welcome 
those who seek asylum in our country. 
A temporary protected status for the 
Ukrainians is the right thing to do, and 
we support that as well. 
So I am very pleased that we did, in-
deed, listen to the President talk about 
that importance last night because we 
know—that is the other thing we 
know—is Americans support—in over-
whelming 
numbers—a 
majority 
of 
Americans support fixing our broken 
immigration system. They know be-
cause they live it daily that immi-
grants provide for our country and that 
without immigrants the issues around 
the supply chains would have been so 
much worse. 
I am also really pleased about the 
way the President talked about deliv-
ering for Tribal communities and about 
delivering for rural communities. What 
this President and this Congress have 
done with regards to investments in 
rural America, in the small towns and 
villages that I find throughout my dis-
trict, in the small towns, villages, and 
hamlets that we find throughout Amer-
ica where people are working to pro-
vide us with the food we eat, with ev-
erything we need, with the pasture 
lands and the grass that our cattle 
need, with all of the bounty that we re-
ceive here in America, that we must 
also invest in those places. 
I was very happy to see that we had 
the CEO of Intel because in my district 
we have an Intel plant, and that plant 
is going to be benefiting from the in-
vestment that we have announced and 
that we passed out of this House with 
the COMPETES Act, because we are 
going to make it in America, we are 
going to invent it in America, and we 
are going to make sure that it is made 
and it is made everywhere in America 
because the priorities that we have in 
that COMPETES Act are things that 
are going to be done everywhere in 
America. 
I am so proud of the fact that we do 
have those huge gains in manufac-
turing jobs. Other Presidents keep 
talking about having gains in manufac-
turing jobs, but it is under this Presi-
dent—and that in 1 year—we had more 
than half a million jobs created, 
600,000-plus jobs. In New Mexico, we 
had 3,600 manufacturing jobs created. 
Now, our problem is we need to make 
sure everybody knows about that. We 
need to make sure that these voices 
about the possibilities and how we are 
creating opportunity and how we are 
delivering 
for 
those 
communities 
where we serve gets out there because 
sometimes all we listen to is those who 
vilify, is those who complain, and those 
who just want to tear everything down 
and don’t really have any good solu-
tions. 
What we are doing in this House and 
what we are passing out of this House 
are solutions. We know, and we heard 
the President speak eloquently last 
night, about the difficulties of infla-
tion. But we also heard the President 
speak about how we address inflation; 
how we address inflation without pe-
nalizing workers; how we pay workers 
more and make sure that costs come 
down. That is what the infrastructure 
bill will do. That is what the COM-
PETES bill will do. And that is what 
we do when we operate and we pass 
policies that focus on lifting up our 
communities, not dividing our commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, I am also so pleased 
at the President’s words that he said 
last night when he said: When we in-
vest in our workers, when we build the 
economy from the bottom up and the 
middle out, we can build a better 
America. 
Madam Speaker, unions are critical 
to establishing the good jobs with a 
fair pay and safe working conditions 
that make that possibility of building 
a better America from the bottom up 
and the middle out. 
That is a key distinction of what we 
have done in this Congress in the 14 
months that I have been so lucky to 
serve. In those 14 months, we have fo-
cused and we have invested in us. We 
have been with the people because the 
people have moved us along, and they 
have told us what we need because we 
have gone and visited and we have lis-
tened. 
b 1745 
I was trained as a rebellious lawyer. 
Why do I say that? People say, what 
does a rebellious lawyer do? I was very 
lucky. I got trained as a rebellious law-
yer at Stanford Law School. What the 
most important and powerful thing a 
rebellious lawyer can do is listen. 
What you saw last night was a Presi-
dent responding to what America has 
shared with us about what they need, 
about what our families need, what our 
communities need. That is what we 
have done in these last 14 months. 
We did not give away a whole bunch 
of money to the rich and the big cor-
porations because they don’t need it. 
They are recognizing incredible profits 
in the last 14 months, and they are 
passing on higher costs. So, the people 
who are carrying the burden of those 
profits are our families, our working 
families. 
But what we have done is, instead of 
giving away money to those who didn’t 
need it, we have invested in our com-
munities. We have invested in our com-
munities, in the American Rescue 
Plan, by giving people the money they 
needed to make it through those harsh, 
dark days. 
Do we remember what it was like in 
2020? It was dark. It was ugly. It was 
scary. We didn’t know if we were going 
to come out of it. People thought they 
were going to be losing their homes. 
How were they going to pay their 
rent? We helped them out. 
The number of small businesses that 
we have saved is amazing. 
Then not only did we save those busi-
nesses, but the other thing that we 
have done in the last 14 months is we 
have had record growth of new busi-
nesses starting. 
Those are the kinds of things that we 
need to celebrate even as we put our 
task to the metal, even as we work 
really hard to make sure that we ad-
dress the new issues that we face be-
cause our work is never done. Our work 
is never done. 
I have studied liberation theology in 
college and in graduate school. We 
talked about what it means to try to 
honor the creator, to honor what we 
are to do. It was about the fact that we 
need to try to create here on Earth the 
kingdom of God because it is not 
enough to say that you need to wait for 
it. 
Those of us who believe in whatever 
our beliefs are, we each need to move 
to say how we work today and every 
day to make the lives of those in our 
community better, to make sure that 
we welcome the stranger, because as 
the Scripture says, we were once 
strangers, too. 
To me, that is what we should do 
when we talk about immigration. We 
need to honor the words of love that 
are in those Scriptures. 
Today, as we celebrate Ash Wednes-
day, we must remember that we have a 
job to do here while we are on this 
Earth, and that is to make this place 
better for those who are less fortunate, 
for those who are on the bottom up and 
the middle out, for all of those. 
That is our job. We have a job for 
this beautiful place we call home, this 
beautiful planet we call home. 
As the Pope has pointed out, we have 
an obligation to protect this beautiful 
creation 
we 
have 
against 
climate 
change, which is part and parcel of, as 
the Pope has noted, greed. 
We must move away from being 
greedy and being mean and move to a 
place where our policies are made from 
a place of love, where we are waking up 
and fighting for our workers. We are al-
lowing them to unionize because it is 
through unionization that this country 
has always improved the conditions of 
our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, President Biden’s address to 
the Nation last night was a missed op-
portunity. Our country is mired in a 
historic number of crises of the Presi-
dent and his party’s own making at 
home, at our border, and abroad. 
The 
rhetoric 
in 
the 
President’s 
speech simply did not match his failing 
record. No amount of spin can change 
what every single American can see 
plainly and feel so personally. 
Madam Speaker, in simple summary, 
our Union is in a state of crisis. Hard-
working American families are being 
threatened by skyrocketing prices and 
empty store shelves; by alarming in-
creases in crime; by our wide-open bor-
ders and illegal immigration; by record 
overdose deaths; by delayed tax returns 
and 
government 
services; 
and, 
of 
course, not the least of which is the 
projection of weakness on America’s 
part on the world stage. 
Since the magnitude of these prob-
lems obviously has not convinced the 
President and his Democrat allies in 
Congress to reverse course, I am not 
sure anything will. 
But the State of the Union address is 
supposed to be an annual opportunity 
for the American President to take 
stock, to level with the American peo-
ple, to acknowledge what has worked 
and what has not. 
Republicans urged President Biden to 
take advantage of that opportunity 
last night to chart a new direction, to 
speak honestly, to accept responsi-
bility for the declining state of our 
country and pledge to do better. 
President Biden certainly would not 
have been the first American President 
to seek a reset—far from it. Presi-
dential resets are common, and they 
are 
necessary. 
But 
this 
President 
didn’t do that. 
What did we get instead? Another 
typical Biden speech. We got another 
series of warmed-over Democrat talk-
ing points taped together and pre-
sented to the American people as if it 
weren’t those same policies that got us 
into the messes that we are in. 
Madam Speaker, this evening, my 
Republican colleagues and I will pro-
vide a further response to the State of 
the Union that was delivered here just 
last night. 
But first, Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS), my friend and col-
league, for her remarks and for a pray-
er that is being shared tonight around 
the world. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
We are all inspired by the people of 
Ukraine and the leadership of Presi-
dent Zelensky and Mayor Klitschko. 
Today, Christian Ukrainians asked 
for Christians around the world to join 
in praying, specifically, Psalm 31. So 
please join me. 
O Lord, we come to You for protec-
tion. Don’t let us be disgraced. Save us, 
for You do what is right. 
Turn Your ear to listen to us. Rescue 
us. Be our rock, our protection, our 
fortress, where we will be safe. 
For the honor of Your name, lead us 
out of this danger. Pull us from the 
traps of our enemies, for we find pro-
tection in You alone. 
We entrust our spirit into Your hand. 
Rescue us, Lord, for You are a faithful 
God. 
We will be glad and rejoice in Your 
unfailing love. You have seen our trou-
bles and You care about the anguish of 
our souls. 
Have mercy on us, Lord, for we are in 
distress. Tears blur our eyes. Our body 
and soul are withering away. We are 
dying from grief. 
We are scorned by our enemies, de-
spised by their neighbors. Even our 
friends are afraid to come near. When 
they see us in the streets, they will run 
the other way. 
We are being ignored as if we were 
dead, as if we were a broken pot. 
We have heard the many rumors, and 
they are surrounded by terror. Their 
enemies conspire, plotting to take our 
lives. 
But we are trusting You, O Lord, say-
ing You are our God. Our future is in 
Your hands. Rescue us from those who 
hunt us down relentlessly. 
Let Your favor shine on Your serv-
ants. In Your unfailing love, rescue. 
Don’t let us be disgraced, O Lord, for 
we call out to You for help. Let the 
wicked be disgraced. Let them lie in si-
lence in the grave. 
Silence their lying lips, those proud 
and arrogant lips that accuse the 
godly. 
How great is the goodness You have 
stored up for those who fear You. You 
lavish it on those who come to You for 
protection, blessing them before the 
watching world. 
You hide us in the shelter of Your 
presence, safe from those who conspire 
against them. You shelter us in Your 
presence, far from accusing tongues. 
Praise the Lord, for He has shown us 
the wonders of His unfailing love. He 
has kept us safe when my city was 
under attack. In panic, we cried out, 
‘‘We are cut off from the Lord,’’ but 
You heard our cry for mercy and an-
swered our call for help. 
Love the Lord, all you godly ones, for 
the Lord protects those who are loyal 
to Him, but He harshly punishes the ar-
rogant. 
So be strong and courageous, all you 
who put your hope in the Lord. 
The word of the Lord. Thanks be to 
God. 
Amen. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. The 
words of the psalmist resonate today as 
much as they did when they were writ-
ten so many years ago, and our God is 
faithful. I thank the gentlewoman for 
putting that in perspective tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise during this Special Order to offer 
thoughts on the real State of the 
Union. 
Last night, the President addressed 
the Nation and attempted to rewrite 
the history of his first 14 months in of-
fice. The speech was short on solutions 
to our everyday challenges: record in-
flation, skyrocketing price of gas, and 
supply chain disruptions that are af-
fecting everything from food to con-
sumer goods. 
This administration owns this energy 
crisis, which is a direct result of its 
crippling domestic production. When 
we don’t produce our own energy, it 
makes us more vulnerable to global 
market fluctuations such as those 
caused by the Russian aggressions at 
Ukraine. 
The Biden administration continues 
to ignore the national emergency at 
our southern border with unprece-
dented illegal immigration, millions of 
apprehensions, and limited deporta-
tions. It is a serious situation that con-
tinues to threaten our national secu-
rity. 
Let’s focus for a moment here on 
U.S. energy. America’s been feeling the 
ripple of skyrocketing energy prices. 
The average gallon of gas in my home 
State of California is up 70 percent 
from this time last year, and heating 
our homes is over 30 percent more ex-
pensive than winter last year. 
Economic sanctions on Russia and 
the halting of the Nord Stream pipeline 
are sure to help increase the costs of 
energy, but they are necessary in order 
for to us to have independence. This re-
ality will be a wake-up call for the 
Biden administration to reverse their 
current course and understand that 
American-produced energy is the best 
path forward. 
After the President announced fur-
ther sanctions on Russia due to the 
unprovoked attack on Ukraine, he 
promised to supply energy to our Euro-
pean allies that depend on Russian nat-
ural gas. 
Since his first day in office, he has 
repeatedly stifled U.S. gas and oil pro-
duction, increasing our dependence on 
all things Russian oil. 
I am an adamant supporter of domes-
tic oil and gas production, including 
building new pipelines. Right under our 
feet lies the largest untapped oil supply 
in the world, more than enough to 
drive down costs for American con-
sumers and export liquefied natural gas 
to our European allies, removing our 
adversaries like Russia from their sup-
ply chain. 
In last night’s State of the Union, the 
President called to make Russia suffer

economic 
consequences 
for 
their 
unprovoked attack. He glossed over 
that he has repeatedly stifled U.S. en-
ergy production, halting the Keystone 
pipeline and suffocating domestic oil 
and gas leases. 
Unfortunately, he did the opposite. 
Just this week, he announced he is 
once again halting all new leases for 
drilling on our vast Federal lands, 
which we know how to do well and eco-
logically soundly. His solution? Import 
more gas from other adversaries such 
as China and the Middle East. 
Our Nation imports 7 percent of our 
oil from Russia. Although that may 
seem like not much, if they shut it off 
when we are not ready for it, that will 
cause a big ripple. 
We can’t just flip a switch and turn 
on our domestic energy supply. It will 
take time to do it. We know what we 
need to do. We need to get at it, to 
start now. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
being 
crushed under the weight of these eco-
nomic consequences from failed poli-
cies. We know what we need to do. 
Let’s get after it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, energy policy is national se-
curity policy. Energy security is na-
tional security. We know that acutely 
now. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield next to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, the 
state of our Union is atrocious. There 
are crises everywhere we look: record- 
high inflation; record-high illegal bor-
der crossings; a supply chain crisis that 
has stalled our economy; soaring en-
ergy prices; a devastating and deadly 
withdrawal 
from 
Afghanistan; 
an 
emboldened Russia trying to overthrow 
a sovereign country and a democratic 
ally, Ukraine. This is what a full year 
of complete Democratic control and 
failure has brought the American peo-
ple. 
The President is completely back-
ward. The policies he and his congres-
sional Democrat allies have pushed us 
into haven’t gotten us out of these cri-
ses. They have actually pushed us into 
these crises under his first, short 1- 
year term in office. 
The speech we saw last night was 
completely detached from reality. 
b 1800 
What the American people are hear-
ing from the Democrats is not what 
they are seeing, and it is not what they 
are experiencing. They can no longer 
afford to suffer these crises brought on 
by incompetent, arrogant, and out-of- 
touch leaders. 
Sadly, the speech last night indicates 
that this administration plans to dou-
ble down on their nonsense and spread 
lies and misinformation to the Amer-
ican people. All the American people 
want is truth, transparency, and con-
sistency instead of manufacturing ac-
complishments to talk about at the 
State of the Union, like the convenient 
overnight change in the science, or 
shall I say, political science as a wind 
must have blown in from the Senate 
and, miraculously, COVID doesn’t exist 
anymore. 
President Biden needs to own up to 
all of the problems he has created and 
actually come up with some real solu-
tions to get our country back on track. 
There is still time to do that. 
If he is unable to do that, I implore 
him, please. Pick up the phone. Call 
me. I am happy to help. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. Very well 
said. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy now to 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER), who announced 
this week that he will not be seeking 
reelection, and he will be sorely missed 
because he is a gentleman and a great 
legislator. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden had 
an opportunity during the State of the 
Union address to communicate to the 
American people what his administra-
tion has learned from its policy fail-
ures of the past year and lay out a plan 
to correct course. Unfortunately, that 
didn’t happen. 
I was not surprised that the Presi-
dent used this address as a political 
tool to double down on his assault on 
American energy, mandates, and Big 
Government spending. These policy de-
cisions have emboldened our adver-
saries and led to record high inflation, 
business losing workers, rising crime 
across the country, and a wide open 
southern border. 
If President Biden really believed 
that doing the same thing will solve 
any of the crises his administration 
created, he is either totally out of 
touch or ignoring the facts. Either 
way, the President took the easy way 
out. What is easy is not always right. 
Be assured, Republicans will not shy 
away from our duty to always put 
America first, to rebuild our economic 
engine, restore individual liberty, and 
renew the American Dream. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. I appre-
ciate him very much. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
to the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. WILSON), who has been a mentor 
to me and so many others in Congress. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. MIKE 
JOHNSON for his leadership and courage 
to present the truth tonight. 
Madam Speaker, last Friday, I was 
grateful as the ranking member of the 
U.S. delegation to the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe to 
address the Parliamentary Assembly in 
Vienna, Austria. Our delegation was 
ably led by co-chair STEVE COHEN. 
The bipartisan United States delegation of 
Democrats and Republicans, being trans-
atlantic with our valued European and Indo- 
Pacific allies have been unintentionally 
united about Putin’s war of mass murder in 
Ukraine, violating the principles of the Hel-
sinki Final Act. 
This emphasizes the devastating human 
cost of Putin’s war against the families of 
Ukraine, isolating Russia and Belarus from 
the modern world. 
This is Putin’s war, as correctly identified 
by Der Spiegel, the German news magazine. 
It is not a war in Ukraine. It is not Russia’s 
war. This is clearly to be forever condemned 
as Putin’s war. The responsibility of an in-
sane czar who is trying to build his power 
based on oil, money, and power, betraying 
young Russians to death. 
OSCE monitors have impartially relayed 
the tragic reality of this conflict every day 
under often difficult and dangerous condi-
tions. The Putin government and its proxies 
must restore the monitors’ ability to fulfill 
their mandate. 
I am personally grateful to have visited 
Russia a number of times where I was so im-
pressed by the talented citizens who today 
who are being betrayed by Putin in his ob-
session for oil, money, and power. 
Two months ago, I visited Kyiv, and it is 
horrifying to know of the attacks. 
The pictures that we see here—they 
have been sent worldwide—this is the 
road to the airport. I was so impressed 
when I was there in December to see 
the four, six, eight, now ten lanes of 
boulevards filled with cars, a very mod-
ern society with high rise buildings 
that could be anywhere in America, 
could be anywhere in the world, in the 
modern world. 
Now, sadly, we see that the cars are 
congested there and blocked. You have 
families. They have their pets with 
them. They have all the property that 
they could possibly carry. They have 
children. They have infants. They have 
elderly and sick persons and are trying 
to flee the rocket attacks solely the re-
sponsibility of Putin. 
Sadly, in Belarus, dictator Lukashenko 
has become a puppet of Putin to subject 
Belarusians 
to 
autocracy, 
facilitating 
Putin’s illegal war on the people of Ukraine. 
It is inspiring that the legal president of 
Belarus, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, would 
have her first loyalty to the people of 
Belarus, not to the war criminal, Putin. 
In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. 
God save Ukraine. Long live President 
Volodymyr Zelensky. God bless Amer-
ica. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you, Mr. WILSON, for all you do, and 
your expertise in foreign affairs is a 
great blessing to all of us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding me time this evening. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to re-
mind President Biden that the State of 
the Union is in crisis, more so than at 
any time in my lifetime. 
After sitting in the House Chamber 
last night listening to the President 
speak, I couldn’t help but think about 
the people of Tennessee that are strug-
gling to make ends meet. 
They are struggling due to sky-
rocketing 
inflation 
that 
has 
been 
fueled by President Biden and congres-
sional Democrats’ insatiable desire to 
recklessly spend trillions of dollars by

borrowing massive amounts of money 
from China and elsewhere, and highly 
mortgaging our children’s and grand-
children’s and their children that fol-
low after them, the future for these 
generations. It is gutless, and it is 
wrong. 
Madam Speaker, the State of the 
Union is not strong. In fact, under only 
1 year of President Biden’s leadership, 
migrant encounters at our southern 
border have increased 96 percent. More 
police officers were killed than in any 
year since 1995. The price of gasoline 
has increased 33 percent. The fentanyl 
that comes across our southern border 
has become the leading cause of death 
among people aged 18 to 45, with an 
American dying every 5 minutes and 15 
seconds. 
Afghanistan has been surrendered 
back to the Taliban, leaving behind 
hundreds of Afghans who were aligned 
with us during that long struggle, 
along with billions of taxpayer dollars 
in modern American weaponry. Now, 
another American ally is under attack 
by 
out-of-control 
Russian 
dictator 
Vladimir Putin. 
It is time to wake up and recognize 
that Biden’s administration and Con-
gressional Democrats’ policies are fail-
ing the American people. In fact, those 
policies have begun to do real damage 
to us at an ever-increasing pace. 
The people of my State, Tennessee, 
see right through this charade and im-
plore the President to act now before it 
is too late and reverse his policies to 
match the rhetoric that we heard in 
the State of the Union address. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, that was so well said. We are 
going to stay in the State of Ten-
nessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT), who is from that same 
area. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. JOHNSON for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, let me start off by 
offering my prayers to Ukraine, its 
people, and its leaders. I have asked my 
family to do that. Every night when we 
say our prayers, we pray for the people 
of Ukraine and their safety and the 
miracle of Biblical proportions that 
needs to occur in that country. It has 
happened before, and it can happen 
again. All of us hope that their country 
finds peace. We want to see this con-
flict end, Madam Speaker. 
Innocent Ukrainians are caught in 
the 
middle 
of 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
unprovoked war against their country. 
These civilians are not at all respon-
sible for the situation they find them-
selves in, yet they are the ones who are 
always paying the price. 
Homes are destroyed. Food and water 
are scarce. Medical supplies are in 
short supply. Many institutions nec-
essary for a stable society are under at-
tack. On top of it all, the Ukrainians 
are living under the constant threat of 
Putin dropping a vacuum bomb or 
something worse. Some reports indi-
cate that thermobaric bombs have been 
introduced to the theater, a whole new 
kind of hell that we are not used to in 
this country. 
Discussions are now taking place 
about the United States supporting the 
Ukrainians with humanitarian aid. The 
question remains, how will we pay for 
this important matter? Congress could 
save a whole lot of money, Madam 
Speaker, if we would seize Russian-held 
assets and use them to pay for humani-
tarian aid to Ukraine. Using a creative 
funding mechanism like this ensures 
that we are responsible stewards of our 
constituents’ tax dollars, especially 
given the challenges they face here at 
home. 
Since 2015, American taxpayers have 
spent nearly $3 billion on humanitarian 
aid to Ukraine. What is wrong with 
having those responsible for the cur-
rent humanitarian crisis pay for it, 
Madam Speaker? Vladimir Putin’s in-
vasion sparked this crisis. It makes 
sense that Russia should pay for the 
destruction and suffering it is causing 
these poor, innocent Ukrainians. 
I appreciate Mr. JOHNSON’s truculent 
use of this apparatus, and I do appre-
ciate his lackluster approach. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Mr. JOHNSON’s leadership in 
this Special Order. 
Last night, President Biden had an 
opportunity to pivot his failing admin-
istration by using the State of the 
Union to present a new plan that would 
actually help the American people and 
address the multitude of crises that he 
created by his policies. 
Instead, President Biden wasted his 
State of the Union speech by doubling 
down on his failed agenda and flat-out 
lying to the American people. 
When I heard his tough talk on sanc-
tioning Russia and his vow to buy 
American, I had hope that maybe this 
would include energy, American oil and 
gas. But no, his administration con-
tinues to double down on Green New 
Deal priorities and promote the pur-
chase of oil and gas from other coun-
tries. 
Why would he do that? Why would he 
encourage the United States to con-
tinue to buy over 635,000 barrels a day 
from Russia alone? Just look at the 
spot price of oil, $114 per barrel today, 
which means we are sending Vladimir 
Putin over $72.5 million every day to 
fund his war machine against Ukraine. 
Every dollar we spend on foreign en-
ergy weakens domestic energy produc-
tion. 
When 
he 
spoke 
about 
inflation, 
Biden’s only so-called solution to com-
bat 40-year high prices and hyper-
inflation was to tell businesses to 
lower costs. That was it. 
Despite promising that he will secure 
the southern border, Biden’s severely 
misguided immigration policies have 
led to over 2.1 million illegal encoun-
ters at our border in his first year 
alone, not to mention record high lev-
els of dangerous drugs like fentanyl 
flooding into our communities. 
Just today, his own acting assistant 
secretary of Border Security and Immi-
gration Policy at DHS admitted in our 
Homeland Security Committee meet-
ing that they are actively working to 
fight against and overturn the lower- 
court-mandated remain in Mexico pol-
icy at the Supreme Court level. 
Last night, the President conven-
iently claimed victory over COVID and 
urged Americans to stop looking at 
COVID as a partisan dividing line. But 
don’t forget, Biden has routinely en-
forced medical tyranny and used the 
pandemic as a weapon to sow division. 
Throughout his Presidency, Biden has 
said that unvaccinated Americans are 
destroying our economy, killing our 
people, and are the root of our coun-
try’s problems. No, Mr. President, that 
is simply not right. 
But it was right to say last night 
that the answer is not to defund the po-
lice. So why the change in message? 
For years, Democrats have dangerously 
called for defunding our brave men and 
women in law enforcement. Even can-
didate Biden said funding should be re-
directed away from our police. 
b 1815 
Meanwhile, there was no mention of 
the Biden administration’s abysmal 
failure in Afghanistan that resulted in 
13 fallen heroes, handed billions of dol-
lars worth of military equipment to 
the Taliban, and abandoned Americans 
behind enemy lines. 
After a year of his failed leadership, 
the American people know good and 
well that Biden’s speech was nothing 
but lip service. Actions speak louder 
than words, Mr. President. Americans 
are desperately waiting for—and de-
serve—a leader who will act on their 
behalf to fix the crises facing our Na-
tion. We are still waiting. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you, my friend. Well said. Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to yield next to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the Republican leader of 
our House Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
in this Special Order hour and for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today during 
this Special Order to offer thoughts on 
the real state of our Union. Last night, 
President Biden addressed the Nation 
and attempted to rewrite the history of 
his first year in office. 
His speech included a lot of Wash-
ington-speak and was short on solu-
tions 
to 
our 
everyday 
challenges: 
Record-high 
inflation, 
the 
sky-
rocketing cost of gas, and supply chain 
disruptions affecting everything from 
food to consumer goods. 
President Biden owns this energy cri-
sis, which is the direct result of his ad-
ministration crippling domestic pro-
duction: Ending the issuing of permits, 
the production on Federal lands, the

stopping of pipelines, the list goes on 
and on and on. 
When we don’t produce our own en-
ergy, it makes us more vulnerable to 
global market fluctuations such as 
those caused by Russian aggressions in 
Ukraine. You heard my good friend 
talk about how America under Presi-
dent Biden is buying over half a mil-
lion barrels of oil a day. In some small 
part or large part, America is funding, 
through that, the Russian aggression 
into Ukraine. 
President Biden continues to ignore 
the national emergency at our south-
ern border. I was just there last week, 
and it was incredible. We have unprece-
dented illegal migration, we have mil-
lions of apprehensions and limited de-
portations. This is a serious situation 
that continues to threaten our na-
tional security. 
Madam Speaker, actions speak loud-
er than words, and no amount of 
grandstanding is going to change the 
fact that the American people have a 
starkly different view from the Presi-
dent on the direction of our country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you, my friend, for your leadership. 
That was well said. As we say over and 
over and over, energy security is na-
tional security, and it is unconscion-
able that we are funding Putin’s ag-
gression in Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. MILLER), my dear friend. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, House Democrats who at-
tacked unmasked and unvaccinated 
Americans as super-spreaders and said 
they should be fired from their jobs 
suddenly decided to lift the mask man-
date and crowd together last night, 
hugging and kissing each other in a 
packed room right before the State of 
the Union to benefit President Biden’s 
political optics. 
COVID restrictions weren’t lifted be-
cause they were destroying children’s 
lives or killing small businesses. The 
restrictions ended because a politi-
cian’s poll numbers got too low, and he 
needed a political reset. The American 
people are disgusted by this political 
double standard. They are never going 
to forget it. 
But we are not surprised. Every deci-
sion the Biden administration makes 
has gone against the needs and the will 
of the American people. 
Americans want secure borders and 
police protection. What does the left 
do? Open our borders, facilitate an in-
vasion, and defund and demoralize our 
police. 
Americans want energy independence 
and affordable gas. What does the left 
do? They dismantle our domestic en-
ergy industry and are forcing Ameri-
cans to buy Chinese solar panels and 
batteries. 
The left may be woke, but Americans 
are awake. The state of the Union is 
ready for a change. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Well 
said. The hypocrisy was on display last 
night. It is just absurd. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, last night’s speech should have been 
the shortest State of the Union Ad-
dress in history. It is easy for everyone 
to see the state of the Union is much 
worse after one year under the Biden 
Presidency. 
This President, in order to keep en-
ergy independence, which is a national 
security issue and an economic secu-
rity issue, all he had to do was nothing. 
If he would have just stayed in his 
basement and we paid him to stay 
home, the country would be so much 
better off today with the prices we are 
paying at the pump, with the security 
of our Nation. 
There is nothing that impacts mid-
dle-income, 
lower-income, 
fixed-in-
come Americans than what we are pay-
ing at the pump. And now we are at 
risk of it going from $4 a gallon to $7 a 
gallon because of this President, and he 
has the travesty to not release Amer-
ican energy in the face of Russian ag-
gression in Ukraine. 
This President needs to allow all the 
drilling to take place in the United 
States, for us to unleash our resources 
and bankrupt the Putin regime so he 
cannot 
finance 
the 
invasion 
into 
Ukraine. But, no, what is happening? 
We are buying some 75,000 gallons of 
Russian oil a day at the cost of $100 a 
barrel, enriching Putin’s regime to the 
cost of $75 million per day. 
But it is worse than that. What did 
this President have to do to keep a se-
cure border? All he had to do was noth-
ing. If he had stayed home after Janu-
ary 20, 2021, Americans would still be 
largely safe at the border because ille-
gal immigration had been eradicated 
under the previous administration. 
But what did he do? He forced the 
cessation of the border wall, and he 
does not permit the border agents, the 
Border Patrol to do their job. Mean-
while, 2.2 million illegal aliens came 
across our border last year, and have 
been distributed into the interior of 
our country, flown at taxpayer expense 
all over the country in the dark of 
night from 160 countries. 
We don’t know what they are doing 
while they are here, and this President 
has not just allowed it to happen; he 
has facilitated it to happen. As a mat-
ter of fact, last night he had the gall to 
say, hey, we want to secure the border, 
when his policies have done just the op-
posite and continue to do just the op-
posite. 
Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitu-
tion says it is the responsibility of the 
President to protect the States from 
invasion, and he is doing just the very 
opposite willfully, purposefully, inten-
tionally. That is why so many of us 
have signed onto impeachment articles 
against this President, just because of 
what he has done on the border. Let’s 
pretend he had done everything else 
well—use 
your 
imagination—in 
his 
first year in the White House. Just be-
cause of what he is doing to the Amer-
ican people at the border, and he has 
the gall in the speech last night to lie 
to the American people and say that he 
wants to secure the border. It should 
have been the shortest speech ever be-
cause to get up there and lie to the 
American people about the policies 
that he is implementing that are harm-
ing this country, it is a travesty. 
Thank you, Chairman JOHNSON. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
GOOD said it so well, and that passion 
is felt all around this country. I hear it 
from my constituents. I know Mr. 
GOOD does as well. All of us do. People 
couldn’t even tune in last night. Our 
constituents are writing to us saying 
they couldn’t even watch it because it 
was nauseating how untrue it was. 
Here we are. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend from Lou-
isiana 
for 
his 
leadership 
and 
for 
hosting this here tonight. 
Less than 24 hours ago, the President 
delivered the State of the Union Ad-
dress in this very Chamber. I would 
like to respond on behalf of the Big 
First District of Kansas. 
Last night, Americans hoped to hear 
our Commander in Chief address the 
many crises facing our country and ex-
plain his plans for fixing them; a rea-
sonable request. Instead, we heard a 
monologue of half-truths and empty 
promises. 
This 
administration 
has 
failed on the world stage, creating one 
foreign policy disaster after another, 
and 
the 
repercussions 
are 
posing 
threats to America’s food supply, en-
ergy security, and our freedom. 
On the home front, this administra-
tion has created record inflation, which 
is destroying livelihoods and killing 
small businesses across the country 
and in my district. Drugs and crime are 
destroying American communities and 
families, and we have an open southern 
border where drugs and human traf-
ficking run rampant. The supply chain 
is still in disarray. Our country’s debt 
is at an all-time high, almost $30 tril-
lion, and the President has halted our 
march toward energy independence by 
killing the Keystone XL pipeline. The 
Biden administration has made a dis-
aster in his handling of the issues at 
home. 
Abroad, our country has an egregious 
trade deficit with China, a country 
that ripped off American farmers to 
the tune of $16 billion in the phase one 
trade deal, and this administration has 
done nothing to hold them account-
able. 
The President was getting lots of ap-
plause last night for talking a big game 
about supporting Ukraine, but we have 
done nothing meaningful so far as in 
response to the humanitarian crisis 
Vladimir Putin has created there. His 
financial 
sanctions 
won’t 
prevent 
China from bailing out Russia finan-
cially, and President Biden won’t stop 
buying half a million barrels of oil a

day from Putin because, again, Presi-
dent Biden killed the Keystone XL 
pipeline. 
Furthermore, the President clearly 
isn’t worried about the food implica-
tions of Russia taking over Ukraine, 
which is the breadbasket of Europe, by 
the way, and the third largest grain ex-
porter in the world, because he still 
hasn’t even appointed a USDA under 
secretary of foreign trade and agri-
culture. In 131⁄2 months he hasn’t even 
nominated one. 
Americans are a resilient people. We 
have proven that over the past 2 years. 
I would argue that Kansans are among 
the most resilient of all. We have made 
it through worse times than these. But 
I am standing here today to say enough 
is enough. We need to get this country 
back on track, and to do that we need 
a President who actually leads. 
Last night, I hoped that the Presi-
dent would tell us about how he plans 
to hold Russia accountable for its inhu-
mane invasion of Ukraine, stop infla-
tion, fix the supply chain, secure our 
southern border, and stand up for 
American farmers and ranchers who 
feed, fuel, and clothe the world. But he 
did not. Instead I heard an out-of-touch 
stump speech from a politician who 
wanted me to believe that everything 
is going to be just fine as long as he is 
in the White House. 
I pray for the President, and I want 
him to be successful, but in order for 
that to happen, he must lead. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Very 
well said, my friend. Thank you for 
being here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to another 
colleague now, the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to comment a little bit on 
the speech last night and some of the 
issues that have been ignored and 
should be addressed and some of the 
issues that were given such short shrift 
it was almost comical. 
The first issue I would like to address 
is inflation. Next time I should get my 
own billboard here. But if you look at 
M2, which is one measure of the mone-
tary supply, in the 1970s—and I am old 
enough to remember the 1970s when in-
flation was really a horrible thing and 
something that we were never supposed 
to repeat—M2 was going up at a rate of 
about 7 percent year over year. We now 
are up about 37 percent year over year. 
I mean, if you look at a graph, it is 
shocking the degree to which the Fed-
eral Reserve is just flooding money 
into our system. Of course, a major 
reason why they have had to do this is 
wildly excessive spending, because if 
you have excessive spending and for-
eign governments do not want to buy 
your debt, and who would want to buy 
your debt, you wind up with no alter-
native but to degrade the value of the 
dollar. 
I thought it was particularly amaz-
ing that the President said or told 
businesses that you have to ‘‘lower 
your costs,’’ meaning that we shouldn’t 
reduce wages, which is fine, but like it 
is an easy thing to lower your costs. I 
wonder, has President Biden ever actu-
ally talked to the businesses who are 
raising their prices? 
The first thing I hear about is the 
metals, the aluminum, the different 
kinds of steel that are up 300, 400, 500 
percent. When the market, the cost of 
these things go up to that degree, and 
you are a businessman, what in the 
world are you supposed to do? 
The cost of transportation is going 
up, and the amount we pay truckers, 
which is a tremendously good occupa-
tion, has gone up. Sometimes you can’t 
even get trucks. And what has Presi-
dent Biden done? He imposes a vaccine 
mandate on truckers, which further re-
duces the supply of an occupation that 
is already in demand, thereby guaran-
teeing the cost is going to continue to 
go up even more. 
I strongly encourage President Biden 
to have some of his staff run around 
Washington, D.C., or maybe run around 
and talk to some of the factory owners 
in this country and ask them or advise 
them what they are supposed to do to 
‘‘lower their costs.’’ Most of them, be-
cause we have a shortage of people 
working, are already probably exceed-
ing last year’s output in product. De-
spite the fact that they are doing that, 
and so, therefore, they are getting 
more per hour worked, but they can’t 
find any new ways to reduce costs. 
b 1830 
But, again, I hope President Biden 
sends some of his cabinet members 
around the country and either advises 
them on how it is going to be easy to 
lower your costs or hears from them 
how impossible it is for them to lower 
their costs. 
By the way, every single manufac-
turer I have talked to in the last 2 
months—and I bet I have talked to 15, 
20—every one of them thinks inflation 
is going to get worse. When I talk to 
farmers who use a variety of fertilizers, 
whatever, that goes into their product, 
they see the costs going through the 
roof. And every single farmer I talk to 
thinks inflation is going to get worse. 
So I strongly encourage the Biden ad-
ministration to have some people get 
out there among the hoi polloi and find 
out what is really going on with regard 
to inflation. 
Next, President Biden talked about 
the police. And maybe President Biden 
doesn’t realize what the problem he 
and his allies have created by going 
after the police. In Milwaukee, the city 
just to the south of my district, there 
was a dramatic increase to an all-time 
record high number of murders in 2020, 
something that you never thought you 
would see again, and it was exceeded 
again in 2021. 
Why is that happening? It is because 
President Biden and his allies have 
adopted an antipolice rhetoric, in par-
ticular implying an amount of racism 
out there, and they are pushing a bill 
that has already been through this 
House, a bill that will make it much 
easier to hire a policeman. 
Now, if a policeman wants to do his 
job, sometimes they have to arrest peo-
ple, sometimes they have to wrestle 
with people. If you can wind up being 
sued, you are much less likely to want 
to do that. And when you have police 
that are less engaged, particularly in 
our busiest cities, what are you going 
to get? More crime. We cannot say we 
are serious about the spiraling number 
of people who are being shot to death 
or stabbed to death in this country 
until we allow the police to be police 
again. We have got to stop that police 
hatred that goes on. 
And I don’t care whether we eventu-
ally send a few hundred million dollars 
around the country to hire more police 
or whatever President Biden has up his 
sleeve, what we have got to do is we 
have got to build respect for police 
again so that they are free to maintain 
the safety in this country. 
The third thing I will look at that I 
thought, again, was misleading to the 
public, concerns election laws. Many 
States, including Wisconsin, have a 
photo ID law. President Biden and his 
acolytes imply that a photo ID law is 
motivated by racism. Again, this is un-
necessarily divisive. 
One of the reasons why I feel that 
Joe Biden is the most divisive Presi-
dent in my lifetime, I have praised him 
for his speech last night in which he 
didn’t call this country racist after 
using the racial word or white suprem-
acy so much in his inaugural speech; 
nevertheless, it is a little bit ridiculous 
when in order to have fair elections 
some of us want to have photo ID and 
then people stand around when photo 
ID is needed for things that probably 
have a much more dramatic impact on 
the average person’s life, but it doesn’t 
bother them. 
We had a requirement here in town 
that you present proof of vaccine with 
which you had to produce a photo ID, if 
you wanted to go to a restaurant in 
this town. I would say it is a fairly sig-
nificant thing. Did anybody say that 
the District of Columbia was being rac-
ist because they required a photo ID if 
I want to eat at a restaurant? 
They want to look at my ID before I 
get in an airplane. If I had to fly some-
where to get some surgery, if I had to 
fly somewhere to see an ailing relative, 
that could be a real life-changing expe-
rience. Does anybody say, oh, it is rac-
ist to require a photo ID if I got on an 
airplane? We just put up with this rou-
tinely. 
Nevertheless, President Biden fans 
the flames of division by claiming that 
those of us who want to make sure that 
we have fair elections are motivated by 
racism when photo IDs are needed so 
commonly. 
The next thing I want to point out 
that I think he gave short shrift to 
with an insultingly small amount of 
time was the huge number of people 
who are dying of drug overdoses in this 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1267 
March 2, 2022 
I got this job only 7 years ago. At the 
time, 47,000 people a year died of drug 
overdoses. By comparison, in 12 years 
during the Vietnam war, 57,000 people 
died. And every politician was supposed 
to talk about it. Now we shoot up from 
47,000 to 100,000 people, and President 
Biden can’t even bring himself to talk 
about fentanyl, the drug responsible 
for most of those deaths. 
I don’t know why he wouldn’t talk 
about fentanyl. My guess is because 
overwhelmingly it is coming across the 
southern border, and he doesn’t want 
to do anything about the southern bor-
der. However, I would hope in the fu-
ture, President Biden would meet with 
law enforcement around the country, 
find out what it is like to have to tell 
the parents or siblings or children of 
the people who have died that their rel-
ative has died. That is a horrible thing. 
And I think to gloss over the 100,000 
deaths we have every year in this coun-
try—twice the number of people who 
died in the 12 years in Vietnam—was I 
thought very callous. But, again, I 
would encourage President Biden to 
ask members of his administration to 
get out and about a little bit, talk to 
relatives of people who have died of 
drug overdoses, particularly fentanyl, 
and maybe it will cause him to devote 
a little bit more time on that in next 
year’s State of the Union address when 
he realizes what a horrible situation we 
have. 
There are many other things that I 
don’t think were addressed accurately 
or in depth during the State of the 
Union address that should have been. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. GROTHMAN. That 
was well said. There is lot. We know 
you can go all night because there was 
a lot to complain about. 
Madam Speaker, tonight you have 
heard the response of so many of my 
Republican colleagues to the lack-
luster State of the Union address that 
was held here last evening. Perhaps the 
most glaring problem with his speech 
is that the President tried to ignore 
the fact that it is his lack of leadership 
that is what has created this dangerous 
situation that we are all in right now. 
All the crises you have heard about, 
the American people know the facts. 
I grew up in the seventies and 
eighties. I was a child of the Reagan 
era, and we remember in the Cold War 
he reminded us we maintain the peace 
through our strength. What he commu-
nicated to us so clearly is weakness in-
vites aggression. We have projected 
weakness on the world stage, and it is 
inviting Russian aggression. We pray 
and hope that we do not get a similar 
aggression from our other adversaries 
like China, North Korea, Iran, and the 
rest. 
The only thing holding back terror-
ists and tyrants and dictators and 
rogue operators around the globe is 
their perception of a strong America. 
That is what we stand for. We wish we 
could have heard that from the Presi-
dent in a more honest tone last night, 
but we didn’t get it. 
So we are here. We are going to con-
tinue to work on this side of the aisle 
to fix these problems, and we look for-
ward to the election cycle this fall 
where we believe the fortunes around 
here are going to change pretty sub-
stantially. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for being here tonight, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
CONGRESS 
MUST 
UNIFY 
AND 
STAND FOR THE AMERICAN PEO-
PLE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
last evening the President of the 
United States was strong, and he was 
clear to stay away from divisive rhet-
oric. But do my friends on the other 
side of the aisle realize that anything 
that has not been accomplished is be-
cause they have been obstructionists? 
The Wall Street Journal says that 
the President and his American Rescue 
Plan has led to less damage, and it is 
the biggest and best recovery, at least 
in the past 50 years. It has had the 
least economic impact in terms of 
long-term unemployment, weak label 
markers, inexperienced workers, evic-
tions 
and 
foreclosures. 
President 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan has led 
to less of that than any recovery in the 
last 50 years. 
We know that in Ukraine it is a dis-
aster. People are dying. It is Putin’s 
war, but the President has brought 
NATO together. 
And, yes, if we could pass Build Back 
Better, which they have obstructed, we 
would be able to have childcare for all 
of America. 
So I wanted to just, for this one mo-
ment, get on the floor to say in all that 
they have said, why don’t they take 
the call of the President? Let’s unify 
and stand for the American people. 
Stop complaining, and let’s get to 
work. President Biden called us to 
work as a strong America.

FULL EQUALITY FOR PUERTO 
RICO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Puerto Rico? 
There was no objection. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today joined by a good 
group of colleagues and legislators here 
in the House to commemorate the 
105th anniversary of granting U.S. citi-
zenship to the people of Puerto Rico 
and to reaffirm our commitment to full 
equality for the island’s two million 
Americans, which can only be achieved 
through statehood. 
Many people will ask how long has 
Puerto Rico been part of the United 
States? Before the Spanish-American 
War, Puerto Rico was part of Spain. 
After the Spanish-American War we be-
came a possession, a territory of the 
United States in 1898. 
In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt 
called on Congress to confer American 
citizenship to Puerto Ricans. Legisla-
tion was introduced to that effect be-
tween 1912 and 1913, which was sup-
ported by President William Howard 
Taft and then the Wilson administra-
tion. President Wilson had even cam-
paigned in 1912 on a promise to ensure 
U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans. 
On this day, March 2nd, President 
Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones- 
Shafroth Act, which extended statu-
tory U.S. citizenship to the residents of 
the island. 
The Jones-Shafroth Act would not be 
the last time Congress acted on a ques-
tion of citizenship. In 1940, the Nation-
ality Act conferred birthright citizen-
ship to persons born in Puerto Rico. 
The signing of the 1917 law cemented 
our relationship as an integral part of 
the United States. 
For 150 years, Puerto Ricans have 
been proud American citizens, and we 
have contributed greatly to this coun-
try in every field of endeavor. We even 
have Supreme Court judges, a lot of en-
trepreneurs, and many others in many 
areas. We proudly uphold and defend 
the ideals that define our Nation, in-
cluding 
more 
than 
235,000 
Puerto 
Ricans who have honorably served in 
the U.S. Armed Forces fighting side- 
by-side with our fellow citizens from 
the States. 
Yet, despite our contributions, de-
spite a longstanding commitment to 
the values that come with being an 
American citizen, the reality is that we 
are still not equal. That is the reality 
of Puerto Ricans every day. And then 
you have 3.2 million Americans living 
on the island and more than 5 million 
living on the mainland. That tells you 
that because of the current territorial 
status, Americans in Puerto Rico lack 
full voting representation in this Con-
gress. 
For example, I can represent people 
on this floor, but I cannot vote here for 
any measure that affects my island. 
b 1845 
I do the job of at least four Members 
of Congress. We do not have Senators 
that can be the voice of Puerto Rico 
because they are not elected on the is-
land. Yet, we need to apply all Federal 
laws to the island but without having a 
say or a vote on each of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1268 
March 2, 2022 
Our people cannot vote for our Presi-
dent, our Commander in Chief, and we 
have no say in the Federal decision-
making process, which impacts every 
aspect of our lives. 
Even though we are U.S. citizens and 
the Federal Government can and often 
does treat the island unequally under 
Federal laws and programs, and while 
it is true that Congress could pass leg-
islation today to address some of those 
disparities, it is similarly true that 
any future Congress could undo such 
efforts. 
When you revise our Constitution, 
specifically, the territorial clause of 
the U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Sec-
tion 3, it says specifically that: ‘‘The 
Congress shall have power to dispose of 
and make all needful rules and regula-
tions respecting the territory or other 
property 
belonging 
to 
the 
United 
States.’’ 
Yet, we are the most powerful Nation 
on Earth still having a colony in the 
Caribbean for more than 105 years. 
That is the reason. Because we are a 
territory, we will be always at Con-
gress’ mercy. As a territory, we will 
never truly enjoy the same rights and 
responsibilities as our fellow citizens 
in the States. 
Only statehood can guarantee our 
full equality as U.S. citizens. That is 
why the people of Puerto Rico have 
voted to reject the current territorial 
status, not once, not twice, three times 
in a row. To be admitted as a State of 
the Union, most recently in November 
2020 when a clear majority, an absolute 
majority of the people, 73 percent of 
the people who voted in that election, 
of those 73 percent of the people who 
voted, 53 percent voted for statehood. 
That is an absolute majority. 
You don’t have any delegates. You 
don’t have any mail. This is direct 
votes, in-person votes of the people of 
the island asking for statehood. Even 
statehood got more votes than any pol-
itician on the island. Statehood got 
more votes than any political party on 
the island. That means that is the big-
gest consensus ever on the island, three 
times in a row. 
As we commemorate the 105th anni-
versary of our American citizenship, it 
is crucial that Congress act to end 
Puerto Rico’s undemocratic territorial 
status and to respond to a vote for 
equality through statehood. 
I am proud to have partnered with 
Congressman DARREN SOTO, our broth-
er from Florida, to introduce bipar-
tisan legislation to achieve this using 
H.R. 1522, the Puerto Rico Statehood 
Admission Act, that will make a for-
mal offer of statehood. 
Never before has Congress even asked 
the people of Puerto Rico whether we 
want to continue as a territorial colo-
nial status or we want to achieve state-
hood or independence. 
This will be the first time ever this 
question will be made to the people on 
the island coming from Congress in a 
binding process—same thing happened 
in Hawaii, same thing happened in 
Alaska. They were asked the simple 
question: Do you want to become a 
State of the Union, yes or no? 
That 
same 
question 
was 
a 
ref-
erendum we held locally in Puerto Rico 
by the local laws with that majority. 
To say that, this bill will make a for-
mal offer of statehood, outlining a 
clear process to enable the island’s ad-
mission into the Union, should it be 
ratified by Puerto Rican voters in a 
federally 
sponsored 
yes-or-no 
ref-
erendum. 
Having said that, I think it is time. 
It is long overdue that we resolve the 
Puerto Rican unfinished democracy 
business. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO), our 
main sponsor on the Democrat side. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the Resident Commissioner. 
Madam Speaker, here is my partner 
in equality in the Resident Commis-
sioner 
JENNIFFER
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
And she is not the only one. Florida is 
in the House tonight in support of 
you—Representative 
DEMINGS, 
Rep-
resentative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, Rep-
resentative SALAZAR. We are all here to 
support our brothers and sisters back 
in my family’s native island. 
This is a little bit about history 
today, 105 years of citizenship. You 
know, I checked on ancestry.com, and 
the roots of my family back in Puerto 
Rico go back way further than they 
could ever tell—on the Soto side and on 
the Casanova side—with a few coming 
in the mid-1800s from the Canary Is-
lands, but the rest back further than 
you can uncover through the internet. 
When Teddy Roosevelt comes up on 
that San Juan Hill and you have the 
Spanish-American War, my relatives, 
my ancestors, were already there for 
an unknown and distant amount of 
time. 
I also see Representative WILD. Rep-
resentative WILD, thank you for being 
here as well from Pennsylvania. Penn-
sylvania is in the House. 
When I think about the turn of the 
20th century, my ancestors, some of 
whom I got to meet, like my great- 
grandmother, 
Altagracia 
Casanova, 
who still farmed by the time I was a 
little kid in Sabana Hoyos in Puerto 
Rico, they became citizens by statute. 
Then my great-grandparents, they had 
draft cards. They went and served in 
World War I. The first shots of World 
War I were fired off the coast of San 
Juan as the Germans attempted to 
enter the Caribbean. 
From there, we saw my grandparents 
stationed in places in the Caribbean in 
South America during World War II. 
We 
know 
of 
the 
great, 
famed 
Borinqueneers serving in all of those 
wars together, as well as Korea. 
This citizenship has been earned, en-
couraged, and in blood, in contribu-
tions in science and art and manufac-
turing and in so many other ways that 
have made this such a great United 
States of America. 
But it is the recent history that I am 
most concerned about. After the 936 ex-
emption ended, my family moved to 
central Florida from Puerto Rico. They 
were worried about the economic cli-
mate. They moved to central Florida 
for economic opportunity. My family 
up north, where I was raised, we soon 
followed and found ourselves in central 
Florida. 
We don’t want people to have to be 
forced to relocate because they are 
worried about economic prosperity. 
That is already in our family history 
as well. 
Then you look at after that recession 
coming in, then PROMESA, austerity 
measures, that would never happen to 
a State. The types of cuts to govern-
ment, the type of attack on sov-
ereignty was terrible. We have many 
pensioners who served as civil servants 
in Puerto Rico who now live in central 
Florida, 
places 
like 
Representative 
DEMINGS’ and my districts and, I have 
no 
doubt, 
in 
south 
Florida 
and 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ’ and SALAZAR’s 
districts as well. So it affects us di-
rectly and indirectly. 
Then we see, on top of that, Hurri-
cane Maria. What devastation, the 
highest death toll of any natural dis-
aster in modern American history. We 
see how important it is to have rep-
resentation and how important it is to 
have fair treatment. 
Then it has been the latest battles 
over these last couple of years. You 
and I have fought together, along with 
our allies here, on everything from 
food assistance to Medicaid to finally 
getting Puerto Rico treated equally in 
the American Rescue Plan, to finally 
getting the people of Puerto Rico 
treated equally in infrastructure. 
But those battles will continue if we 
do not resolve the territorial status. 
That is why I was honored to co-intro-
duce our bill, together with our friends, 
to admit Puerto Rico as a State, after 
a binding plebiscite, of course. 
I feel very good about where we are 
headed, to a bipartisan vote on the 
floor and putting forward a bill that 
the Senators can vote for. 
This is about making sure, as we see 
tyranny attacks of democracy versus 
autocracy in Ukraine and, frankly, in 
so many places around the Caribbean, 
Central and South America, this is 
where we can take a stand in the Carib-
bean for democracy and give our broth-
ers and sisters back on the island the 
opportunity to forge your own des-
tinies, and your Florida Rican brothers 
and sisters are with you. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I say thank you to our main 
sponsor. I will say, I don’t have the 
vote here in the House so I depend on 
all Members of the House to support 
Puerto Rico in many ways. 
In that sense, I will be always grate-
ful, DARREN, for your commitment and 
your help. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize now a 
dear friend from Florida as well who is 
here. 
Before recognizing her, I recognize a 
former Member of the House and cur-
rent Governor of Puerto Rico. Pedro

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1269 
March 2, 2022 
Pierluisi is here on the floor of the 
House. Thank you, Governor, for sup-
porting this. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan 
issue. You won’t find any other bill 
that will have bipartisan support. This 
is not a Republican issue. This is not a 
Democratic issue. This is the cost of 
equal rights. This is civil rights. This 
is democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot find a bet-
ter person to speak about that than my 
good friend from Miami, Congress-
woman SALAZAR. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SALAZAR). 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Resident Commissioner. 
Madam Speaker, for over 120 years, 
Puerto Rico, as we have said here, has 
enriched the United States with its 
culture and its people. 
The beautiful island of Puerto Rico 
that I know so well is the jewel of the 
Caribbean. Millions of Americans have 
flocked to its beaches and rainforests 
to soak in the incredible natural beau-
ty of the island of Puerto Rico. 
With that background, 105 years ago, 
as we have heard before, Puerto Ricans 
became citizens of this great country, 
the United States. Puerto Ricans are 
true Americans and true patriots be-
cause over 35,000 of them currently 
serve in the United States Armed 
Forces. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
235,000 
Puerto 
Ricans are veterans who have served 
alongside 
their 
fellow 
countrymen 
from the mainland, from the beaches of 
Normandy to the Mekong Delta. Its 
people, the Puerto Ricans, have made 
the ultimate sacrifice in the name of 
freedom and in the name of the United 
States of America. 
I should say that Puerto Rico holds a 
very special place in my heart because 
after my parents fled Castro’s Cuba, 
my family found refuge in San Juan, 
the capital of the island of Puerto 
Rico. Because of that decision, I spent 
a fantastic childhood in the island be-
cause we went to live in paradise in the 
1960s. 
It was in Puerto Rico where I first 
learned about American values. It was 
in Puerto Rico where I learned the 
meaning behind the American flag and 
the central value of freedom and lib-
erty. 
Puerto Ricans received the Cuban 
exile community with open arms. That 
is why today I take this opportunity 
from the floor of the United States 
Congress, as a Congresswoman for the 
city of Miami, the heart of the Cuban 
exile community in the United States. 
I thank the Puerto Ricans for their 
noble act of welcoming millions and 
millions of Cubans to the island and 
giving them the possibility of living in 
freedom, in peace, and living in para-
dise. 
Puerto Ricans have welcomed people 
from around the world to visit paradise 
and the Caribbean on American soil, 
the best of both worlds. Today, Puerto 
Ricans 
are 
American 
ambassadors, 
showing the beauty and diversity of 
our great country to the rest of the 
world. 
For that reason, I thank my very 
good friend, mi amiga, Resident Com-
missioner JENNIFFER GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, 
for her leadership on this floor. She is 
a relentless champion for the island’s 
future, for what the island deserves, 
and for what we need to see for the fu-
ture of Puerto Rico. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Thank 
you, Maria Elvira. You touched my 
heart with those words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today on behalf of the 
more than 80,000 Puerto Rican con-
stituents who call my district, Penn-
sylvania’s 
Greater 
Lehigh 
Valley, 
home. 
My community would not be what it 
is without the contributions of the 
Puerto Rican community. The United 
States would not be what it is without 
the contributions of this community. 
Every aspect of our national legacy, 
our cultural and artistic heritage, our 
groundbreaking discoveries in science 
and technology, the dynamism of our 
economy, and the strength of our 
Armed Forces has been shaped indeli-
bly by these fellow citizens. 
b 1900 
And yet despite their service, resi-
dents of the island cannot vote for the 
Commander in Chief. They lack voting 
representation in Congress. And de-
spite paying into programs like Medi-
care and Medicaid, they do not have eq-
uitable coverage under these programs. 
I am here to deliver a clear message. 
As United States citizens, the people of 
Puerto Rico have the right to full rep-
resentation in their government. This 
is a principle at the very core of our 
Nation’s founding. It should not be 
controversial, and, in fact, it is widely 
accepted among Americans of both po-
litical parties. 
In fact, my colleague who has gath-
ered us all here today and who has in-
troduced the Puerto Rico Statehood 
Admission Act is a Republican. Thank 
you for having me. Today, the 105th an-
niversary of the date when the people 
of Puerto Rico became United States 
citizens must mark the moment when 
we finally begin the work of passing 
legislation to give the people in Puerto 
Rico a long overdue voice and a vote in 
their future. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand 
today with my friends and colleagues 
as we mark the 105th anniversary since 
United States citizenship was granted 
to the people of Puerto Rico. In many 
ways, today is a joyous day in recogni-
tion of the decades of activism under-
taken by our Puerto Rican sisters and 
brothers. 
Yet, amidst the celebration, it is also 
an acknowledgement that for too long 
we have treated Puerto Rico and her 
residents as second-class citizens with 
laws and policies that put them at a 
real disadvantage. The residents of 
Puerto Rico, more than 3 million 
strong, pay Federal taxes, are U.S. citi-
zens with U.S. passports and U.S. cur-
rency, and they have long served brave-
ly in our military, just ask any 
Borinqueneer who fought valiantly in 
the Korean war. 
Yet, the people of Puerto Rico con-
tinue to be denied equal rights, includ-
ing voting representation in the United 
States Congress. This inequality has 
real consequences. As we saw so vividly 
in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, 
Puerto Rico faced injustices that no 
U.S. State would ever endure. 
These inequities exist not only when 
it comes to recovery assistance, it can 
be seen in tax and Medicare inequities. 
Put simply, these disparities are un- 
American. A stronger political voice 
can help remedy that. 
Today, I stand in solidarity with my 
colleagues in calling for what has been 
long overdue: statehood for Puerto 
Rico. 
In 2020, Puerto Ricans voted over-
whelmingly in support of statehood. 
The Puerto Rican people should be 
given a chance to cast a vote where 
those results will be respected. Now is 
the time for us to listen loudly and 
clearly to the calls from the Puerto 
Rican people. It is a matter of civil 
rights both on the island and in the 
greater diaspora. 
Legislators on both sides of the aisle 
understand how crucial it is that we 
fully support this effort, and I am 
proud 
to 
work 
with 
my 
friend, 
JENNIFFER
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, and was 
proud to work for many years with her 
predecessor, 
now 
Governor, 
Pedro 
Pierluisi. Today is proof of that. 
Puerto Ricans have made their desire 
for statehood clear, and Congress must 
follow suit. I will continue fighting for 
statehood to ensure that every citi-
zen’s voice is heard and to give respect 
to the Puerto Rican people that is long 
overdue. 
As we commemorate this 105th anni-
versary 
of 
citizenship 
for 
Puerto 
Ricans, let us remember that Puerto 
Rican statehood is a long overdue step 
toward equality and democracy for all. 
You cannot have true equality without 
full representation. We will be a better 
and stronger Nation when we include 
Puerto Rico as our 51st State. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like to recognize at 
this time and yield to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, we 
are a government of the people, by the 
people, and for the people, but our 
brothers and sisters, our fellow Ameri-
cans on the island of Puerto Rico are 
not recognized as a government by the 
people. Puerto Rican Americans re-
ceived citizenship 105 years ago today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1270 
March 2, 2022 
If we are going to truly be the land of 
the free, we must make good on Amer-
ica’s promise to be a government of the 
people for all people. We need to be 
who we say we are. We need to be the 
country where every voice and every 
person matters. For over a century, the 
residents of Puerto Rico have been 
treated as second-class citizens within 
our country. It is un-American and it 
is unjust. 
Second-class citizens not only in 
their vote, but also in healthcare, sen-
ior assistance, and the Child Tax Cred-
it. This is wrong. Today, on the 105th 
anniversary of the citizenship for Puer-
to Rico, it is time for us to stand up, 
yet again, and declare that equal rights 
are an American value, and that fair-
ness and justice are American values, 
and that the Americans on the island 
of Puerto Rico must have justice, must 
have fair treatment, and must have 
statehood. 
We fought this year to ensure that 
the residents of Puerto Rico would 
start to receive equal treatment on 
Federal programs like Social Security, 
Medicare, and the Child Tax Credit. 
This fight is not over, and we are not 
giving up. 
Yet, even with the weight of this 
fight for a century, I feel optimistic. In 
fact, I feel better than I ever have be-
fore. Puerto Ricans have spoken with a 
clear voice, with a fair and open vote, 
and demanded that it is time for full 
representation. 
I am grateful for the leadership of 
Congresswoman GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N
and 
Congressman SOTO on this issue, and I 
look forward to continuing the work in 
Congress until we get this done. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, how much time do I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 5 minutes remaining. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, you heard many of the Mem-
bers of Congress supporting this quest 
of Puerto Rico’s civil rights and de-
mocracy rights to vote. Sometimes 
people forget the contributions people 
of Puerto Rico have made to this great 
Nation, contributions that we feel 
proud of, like the nine Puerto Rican 
Medal of Honor recipients: Private 
First Class Fernando Luis Garcia, Mas-
ter Sergeant Juan Negron, Private 
Demensio

Miguel

Humbert Roque, and I can speak about 
many others. 
Historically, Puerto Rico has ranked 
among the top U.S. jurisdictions in 
terms of per capita military service. It 
is estimated that more than 18,000 
Puerto Ricans served our Nation dur-
ing World War I; 65,000 Puerto Ricans 
during World War II; 61,000 during the 
Korean war; 48,000 during the Vietnam 
war; 10,000 during the Gulf war, and 
25,000 during Operation Enduring Free-
dom and Iraqi Freedom. Yet, just last 
week we have 300 more that are already 
in Poland with the current situation in 
Ukraine. That is the patriotism Puerto 
Ricans feel about this Nation. 
Why do all those soldiers never re-
ceive the same benefits from being in 
the military when they come back 
home? Why should they be treated dif-
ferently with even programs that do 
not apply to them? And they cannot 
vote for the Commander in Chief? Even 
this Congress gave the Congressional 
Medal of Honor to our Borinqueneers, 
the 65th Regiment that fought in 
Korea, but yet they cannot vote for 
their Commander in Chief. 
Over 1,200 U.S. citizens of Puerto 
Rico have died while serving, paying 
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of 
America’s freedom, while lacking full 
voting representations and equality 
back home. Defending freedom, defend-
ing democracy around the world, but 
not having them back home. 
Our island is proud and rich in the 
tradition of military service. Today, 
thousands of Puerto Ricans serve on 
Active Duty and Reserves and all 
branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. Ap-
proximately, 8,400 currently serve in 
the Puerto Rico Army National Guard, 
and since 9/11 they have carried out 
over 16,000 deployments, more than 34 
States in the Union. 
Over 90,000 American veterans call 
Puerto Rico home. Unfortunately, de-
spite our military contributions and 
their honorable service on behalf of the 
Nation’s ideals, the current territorial 
status hurts Puerto Rico’s veterans 
and servicemembers. It denies them 
the representation in the Senate and in 
the House, and it denies them the right 
to vote for the President. It perpet-
uates the inequities of Federal laws 
and programs which are detrimental to 
veterans in terms of economic oppor-
tunity, health, security, and quality of 
life. 
Statehood for Puerto Rico and con-
gressional action to end the territorial 
status will benefit our veterans and the 
thousands of Puerto Ricans who cur-
rently serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. 
It will provide them real democracy 
through a vote and equal representa-
tion in Congress; through the ability to 
elect their Commander in Chief; and 
through a permanent union with their 
fellow citizens in the States. 
This is the time to respond for Puer-
to Rico. This is the right of the island 
to become part of this great Nation, 
more than 105 years since being a terri-
tory. This is the time for Congress to 
act. 
You have H.R. 1522, a bipartisan bill 
with more than 79 cosponsors, Repub-
licans and Democrats, asking for state-
hood and equality. With that, state-
hood will address many of the inequi-
ties in the Federal law that currently 
hinder economic growth and progress 
in Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, we celebrate the 
U.S. citizenship for Puerto Rico, but 
we want statehood now. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
CURRENT BORDER INSECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
have requested this time to address 
part of the State of the Union that was 
not addressed last night. In fact, we 
saw that the President was so bold as 
to say that the border is secure and 
tout the fact that they have caught 2 
million people at the border, as if that 
is success. That is what was said. 
What wasn’t said is what has been 
going on at the border for a long time 
and has been made worse by the poli-
cies that Joe Biden and his administra-
tion have put in place. Frankly, by the 
United States laws that he and his ad-
ministration have ignored, and that 
Secretary Mayorkas enables every day 
that he leads the Department of Home-
land Security down the wrong path for 
our country. 
So, we are here to talk about, stop 
the cartels. We are introducing a bill 
called the Stop the Cartels Act. We 
spend so much time on the sympa-
thetic cause of immigration and we 
conflate border security with immigra-
tion. 
We can have an incredibly secure bor-
der regardless of our immigration pol-
icy, and border security is, in fact, na-
tional security. The cartels pose a seri-
ous threat to the United States of 
America. The products that they push 
in our communities have killed over 
100,000 people. 
b 1915 
This past year, the leading cause of 
death for 18 to 45 year olds is fatal 
overdoses. The drugs are bad, but now 
they are poisoned with fentanyl, and 
we are not taking the threat seriously. 
So the first portion of the Stop the 
Cartels Act will focus on gathering in-
telligence. 
As we look at the country of Mexico, 
our southern neighbor, it controls the 
whole land portion of our southern bor-
der. That border is controlled by the 
cartels. I had Brandon Judd, the presi-
dent of the Customs and Border Patrol 
Union, at a hearing that we had to 
have offsite because Speaker PELOSI 
won’t have the hearing on the topic in 
any of our hearing rooms. She won’t 
let the committees of jurisdiction deal 
with it, so Republicans are forced to go 
offsite to talk about this important 
topic. 
When I asked him: Who controls the 
border? You or the cartels? Do the car-
tels control the border more than you? 
He said: You are not putting words in 
my mouth. That is the exact point. The 
cartels control the border. We don’t 
control the border. 
I said: Why don’t you control the bor-
der? 
He said: Because of policies. 
Do you need more resources? 
That is a different topic. What we 
need is good policy. We had policies

March 2, 2022 
that were working to control the bor-
der, and now we have policies that are 
not working. 
The Border Patrol controls it. We are 
not even on defense, we are not even on 
the field, and we are not even in the 
stadium because the policies of this ad-
ministration changed so that it gave 
complete control of our southern bor-
der to the cartels. 
Now, we could talk about all the cor-
ruption and the problems that the car-
tels are causing for Mexico. That is a 
problem that Mexico has to deal with, 
and we should be able to help them 
once we prioritize intelligence collec-
tion on the cartels on par with the 
other threats to our country, on par 
with China, with Russia, with Iran, 
with North Korea, with al-Qaida, with 
ISIS, and with the known credible 
threats to our country. 
The cartels should have the same 
level of intelligence priority as those 
other hostile or potentially hostile 
countries. And the cartels are clearly 
hostile. They do a lot of business 
here—billions and billions of dollars. 
So we have highlighted this map. 
These are the areas that we already 
know which cartels control. You have 
the states of Mexico listed, but you 
also have color coded which cartels 
control that. We would like to have the 
granular detail of what is the org 
chart, who leads the cartels. I am not 
saying we don’t have that, but we do 
not have it at the right priority. And 
then when we do have the intel-
ligence—just as we have seen, the in-
telligence community got Ukraine in-
credibly right. The problem wasn’t 
that we didn’t have good intelligence 
with respect to Russia, the problem 
was the administration didn’t do the 
right thing with the intelligence. But 
let’s first get the right intelligence on 
the cartels. 
So the next thing is we have cities, 
States, and counties that are com-
pletely ignoring the United States law. 
It is a Federal policy to decide who is 
a citizen and who is not a citizen. And 
when we go to enforce our laws as to 
who is here legally versus who is here 
illegally, that is clearly Federal juris-
diction. 
We have cities, States, counties, and 
other communities that are ignoring 
these laws—sanctuary cities. And those 
sanctuary cities are saying: Not only 
would this be a great place to base 
your illicit activity, cartels, we will 
protect you by being a sanctuary. 
Please come locate your illicit activity 
here. Bring your drugs, bring your 
guns, bring your labor trafficking, your 
sex 
trafficking, 
your 
human 
traf-
ficking, and bring your money laun-
dering business and every form of cor-
ruption into our communities. That is 
what these first two maps show. 
But let me show you next what the 
impact on our communities is, Madam 
Speaker. 
This young lady to my right is Lizzie 
Murphy. She died at 21 years old. Drugs 
are bad, but now they are poisoned 
with fentanyl. Seeing that it is not a 
good idea to take it without a prescrip-
tion or a specific use—a lot of people 
refer to it as a safe party drug—it is a 
bad decision. But it is not supposed to 
kill you. But when it is laced with 
fentanyl, that is what is happening to 
our young people. That is how fentanyl 
killed over 60,000 Americans last year. 
Not all of it is in the heroin. Not all of 
it is in the really hard stuff. Some of it 
is in the stuff that people never suspect 
is going to kill them. They take one 
pill, and they are dead. 
That is what happened to my friends, 
Mark and Kristi Murphy when their 
little girl took one Xanax. Their 
daughter—she is sitting here hugging 
her sister, close friends, best friends— 
doesn’t have her sister anymore. 
This is wrecking our communities, 
and we have got communities inviting 
this in by being sanctuary cities. 
We have got a President of the 
United States who is not just doing 
nothing, he is doing worse than noth-
ing. He is making it worse by empow-
ering the cartels. They exploit people, 
and they cause harm to our commu-
nities. 
To highlight the ways this is hap-
pening and the ways to solve it, I have 
asked some of my colleagues to join me 
in this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. It is good 
to be here. 
I am glad my friend is raising aware-
ness. I am going to go as quickly as I 
possibly can because I don’t know how 
much time I am going to take up. 
But let’s talk about fentanyl for just 
one quick second. Local reporting out 
of Tucson was that last year 13 million 
fentanyl pills were seized in Arizona 
alone—13 million. DEA has said 40 per-
cent of all pills seized have a lethal 
dose of fentanyl in them. I want you to 
think about that, Madam Speaker. You 
add that 13 million and you take it into 
what agents and local law enforcement 
has told us, and that is they only inter-
dict 8 to 10 percent. That means you 
have got over 100 million fentanyl pills 
floating around. 
The cartels control all of the border 
between every port of entry on our bor-
der with Mexico. Let me give you an 
example, Madam Speaker, of the story 
out of southern Arizona recently just 
in the last couple weeks. 
A lady was found wandering around. 
Local law enforcement deputies found 
her and assisted her. 
What did she have on her possession? 
A bag full of pills. They wanted to 
know what this was, was this an illicit 
drug or illicit? What is going on? 
She said: These are morning-after 
pills. I knew when I would be coming 
across the border that I would be raped 
multiple times so I brought a bunch of 
morning-after pills. 
That is fact. That is what is hap-
pening. It is not humane on the border. 
I find myself baffled by this. 
So let’s talk about cartels a little bit 
more. In a story from just early Janu-
ary—and I have been down to the bor-
der and talked to this team since then, 
a cartel, a Mexican cartel put out a hit 
on Cochise County sheriffs’ deputies— 
two of them—because they are on the 
border team. There is a small border 
team down there. They are very effec-
tive. They had a hit put on them by a 
cartel. 
So what happens? What happens? 
Why is the Biden administration ig-
noring this crisis? 
Let’s take a look at something else. 
In September of last year I said: How 
many unaccompanied children have 
been brought into the country? 
One hundred ten thousand roughly. 
They finally responded to a series of 
questions I had just this week. 
They said: We have lost contact with 
20,000 of those children. 
They basically have lost 20,000 unac-
companied children. 
This is the border under President 
Biden. 
Now, in Cochise County, 82 miles, a 
remote border crossing area, between 
the Border Patrol and the Cochise 
County Sheriff’s Office, about 16,000 il-
legal immigrants are detected every 
month in a huge, huge county. Two 
years ago the county recorded an aver-
age of 4 to 500 illegal aliens per month. 
Let’s give it to you more starkly, 
Madam Speaker: under the Trump poli-
cies, we slowed down illegal immigra-
tion. Under the Biden policies, we went 
from 4 to 500 people a month in this 
massive county to now 16,000 a month. 
What are they paying the cartels? 
A minimum of $1,000, but typically 
more like $4,000 per person coming in. 
Most of these folks don’t have $4,000. 
So what happens? 
They become indentured servants of 
cartels, and they are located in—and I 
know Mr. DAVIDSON is going to show 
you a map, Madam Speaker—they are 
in virtually every community in this 
country. 
There is a reporter named Jorge Ven-
tura. Jorge does a lot of work on the 
border issues. And I want to talk to 
you about cartels again and how they 
have infiltrated not just the border but 
they are also beyond the border. A year 
ago there were illegal marijuana farms 
in southern California. There are about 
100 in L.A. County. It is a huge county 
both geographically and population 
wise. 
Its 
neighboring 
county, 
San 
Bernardino County, had about 2 or 300. 
Today over 200 illicit marijuana farms 
are in L.A. County and over 1,100 in 
San Bernardino County. 
Now, why is that important? 
It is important for you to understand 
that those are coming in from cartels. 
The mayor of Lancaster, Rex Parris, 
said in July of last year that it is the 
cartels. They had seized more than 16 
tons of marijuana worth about $1.2 bil-
lion, and the mayor said: ‘‘We are very, 
very close to driving down the freeway 
and seeing bodies hanging from the 
overpasses. That is what is coming.’’

March 2, 2022 
Why does he say that? 
Because the cartels are ruthless. 
They have little value for human life. 
When you hear about children, toddlers 
being thrown over a border fence, that 
is the coyotes. 
Whom do they work for? 
The cartels. When you hear of chil-
dren 2, 3, and 4 years of age wandering 
around in 115-degree heat in Arizona’s 
desert without an adult present and 
without water, that is the cartels. 
They don’t care about human life. This 
is a business enterprise, and the prod-
uct is to move people and drugs into 
the country. 
So what happened just a week ago, 
not even a week ago? 
Prosecutors in Mexico in the town of 
San Jose de Gracia in the western 
State of Michoacan said that they 
can’t determine how many people were 
killed because attackers cleaned up the 
scene and removed any bodies. 
Mexicans have been left wondering 
what happened to about one dozen men 
who disappeared after they were seen 
lined up against a wall by drug cartel 
gunmen in this small village. 
In a video filmed by a resident of the 
town that was later posted on social 
media, bursts of gunfire break out, 
smoke covers the scene, the camera 
cuts away, and all the men, perhaps as 
many as 17, were killed. 
That is what cartels do. Cartels do 
not care about human life. And when I 
have had multiple briefings, as I go 
down to the border virtually every 
month of every year, I wonder where 
the border czar in this administration 
is. She got to El Paso, almost made it 
to the border, and didn’t quite get 
there. It is kind of like when she went 
over to Ukraine, she made it to Ger-
many but didn’t make it into Ukraine. 
I look, and I say: What happened? 
Why is this happening? 
And my briefers tell me the border is 
controlled by cartels. Between every 
port of entry no one enters this coun-
try without a cartel knowing about it. 
When I was in the Tucson sector 
right before Christmas, I went down 
and you see 2 miles of fencing, and 
there is 8 feet of gap, then another 2 
miles of fencing, and then it just stops, 
and then it goes for literally 60 miles 
with no fencing other than the Nor-
mandy barrier. I went to the gap, and I 
am standing there looking into Mexico. 
You can see, Madam Speaker, that gap 
is where all the pathways lead, and 
there is all the debris and crud that is 
out there. 
I said to my folks who were with me: 
Please videotape it because I am going 
to explain what was going on here. 
I didn’t bother to tell CBP, because I 
get down a lot. Sometimes I tell them 
I am going to be there. An agent rolls 
up. 
He said: Who are you talking to? 
He didn’t know who I was. 
I said: I am not talking to anyone. I 
am doing the video here for my con-
stituents. 
He said: Oh. I thought you were talk-
ing to the cartel scouts. 
I said: What do you mean? 
He said: We literally chased—before 
we detected you, we chased four cartel 
scouts back up through that gap, and 
they sit in a hooch on this little bluff. 
That is where the cartel scouts are as 
they are sending people through. 
b 1930 
The way it works is this. They will 
send a group of 100 people to some 
place, maybe the San Miguel gate down 
near 
Sassabe, 
near 
the 
Tohono 
O’odham Reservation. That takes the 
four or five people that are trying to 
patrol that area. They will go to that 
gate. They have to process those indi-
viduals. It is so remote that it takes 
literally hours to remove those people 
and get them bused to a detention fa-
cility and processed. 
In the meantime, they will see what 
we call ‘‘known got-aways,’’ dozens of 
known got-aways rolling through other 
parts of that border. They are dressed 
in camouflage. They are wearing carpet 
shoes. They have got backpacks filled 
with fentanyl and methamphetamine 
on their backs. 
I am just telling you, I appreciate my 
friend from Ohio, his efforts, and this 
very important piece of legislation. 
And I call upon this administration, 
don’t tell the American people—I am 
reminded of the ‘‘Darkest Hour.’’ It is a 
movie with Winston Churchill. The 
King says to Winston: Don’t lie to the 
people. Tell them the truth. 
I am asking this administration: Tell 
the people the truth. They can take it. 
They understand. 
Because last year, over 2 million, 
about 2,500,000 people, entered this 
country illegally; another 1.2 to 1.3 
million entered legally. Now, of those 
2.5 million, probably about 1.5 million 
are wandering around this country. 
They are somewhere in this country 
today. This administration let them 
go. 
Madam Speaker, we have to get con-
trol of our border. I find it remarkable 
that the deputy Homeland Security di-
rector was saying that we really need 
to protect the borders, that you won’t 
have a sovereign nation without a pro-
tected border. But he wasn’t talking 
about our border, which isn’t pro-
tected. He was talking about the 
Ukrainian border. 
I asked them to have the same con-
cern and care for the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der as they profess to have for the 
Ukraine border. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
look, if we look over on the far right, 
how does a young lady lose her sister? 
How does a young lady, 21 years old, in 
Ohio wind up dead from fentanyl poi-
soning, poison in the drugs? 
They know drugs are bad, but they 
are not supposed to kill them. They are 
in Ohio. Ohio is not—I mean, we do 
have a border. It is on Lake Erie with 
Canada. That is not the border that is 
causing our young people to die. That 
is not the one that is causing the lead-
ing cause of death for 18- to 45-year- 
olds to be fatal overdoses. 
It is all the way down here on the 
southern border. And it is not officially 
the Mexican Government. It is the car-
tels. And we refuse to collect the intel-
ligence at the right level. 
At our southern border, we have a 
joint task force. We don’t have a joint 
interagency task force. We have that 
out in the Pacific Ocean. We have that 
in the Caribbean and the Atlantic 
Ocean. But we don’t have a joint inter-
agency task force. 
The place probably that it makes the 
absolute most sense to have an inter-
agency task force is at the southern 
border. We have Customs and Border 
Protection. We have people that are fo-
cused on smuggling of people, smug-
gling of drugs, of guns. We have people 
that are focused on counterfeit prop-
erty. 
We are focused on levying taxes at 
the border, inspecting fruit at the bor-
der, and everything else. But we don’t 
have an interagency task force that 
uses the power of our military to con-
duct surveillance, that uses the power 
of our Director of National Intelligence 
and all the resources that we have to 
know everything about the cartels, not 
some benign name like Sinaloa, but, 
specifically, who leads that. 
We know who leads Russia. We know 
it is Vladimir Putin. They are a na-
tion-state. 
But we have these transnational 
criminal 
organizations 
that 
go 
unnamed. Again, they are involved in 
the activities not because they care so 
much about the activity itself. They 
want the money. 
We don’t have an organized way to 
collect all the intelligence on the 
money. What yachts are they buying? 
What properties do they own? How do 
they move this heavily cash business 
into other goods and services? 
They move everything that can store 
value possible all over the world to try 
to clean up this money. We don’t have 
the kind of pressure that was just 
brought to bear on Vladimir Putin 
going against the cartels. 
Vladimir Putin we finally recognized 
as evil as he invaded Ukraine. But 
when he was doing the menacing, 
threatening activity, when we had at 
least gone so far as to collect the intel-
ligence, we didn’t take the actions that 
could have stopped him. 
Here, we can’t even go so far as to 
collect the right level of intelligence. 
Intelligence is the first thing. 
The next slide I have deals with the 
sanctuary cities. We are going to 
defund the sanctuary cities. They can’t 
keep getting funded. They have to con-
form to U.S. law. 
We just had a Supreme Court ruling 
that said if you want to get paid for 
providing Medicare and Medicaid serv-
ices, you have to make your employees 
conform. We can do that to American 
citizens, and we can’t do that to deal 
with the cartels. 
Now, it is a different topic, I will 
grant you, but it is the same thing, the 
strings attached to the money. We

have to put the strings attached to the 
money to say, if you want the money 
that is collected here in the city, you 
have to reflect the laws of the United 
States of America, and you can’t offer 
sanctuary to these cartels that are 
killing our young people. 
There is more to the bill, but let me 
highlight in another way the con-
sequences of not stopping the cartels. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, up there 
where you sit, last night Joe Biden 
stood here and delivered his State of 
the Union address. He spoke about lots 
of issues. But he didn’t even touch on 
the biggest issue facing our country 
today, and that is the southern border. 
Make no mistake, the state of our 
border, it is not good. The Border Pa-
trol has encountered over 150,000 illegal 
aliens—not last year but just last 
month, in January, just 33 days ago, 
when they tallied up those numbers. 
That is a 96 percent, almost 100 percent 
increase from last year. 
Over 62,000, out of that 150,000, 62,000 
of those individuals were released into 
the United States. It is unbelievable. It 
is unacceptable. It is dangerous. 
When I get to travel around North 
Carolina and visit with law enforce-
ment, as I love to do and have the 
honor of doing, the sheriffs tell me 
there are about 3,200 counties in this 
amazing country. They said every sin-
gle sheriff right now is a border sheriff 
because of the policies that are hap-
pening right here, just down the street 
in the White House. There are drugs, 
fentanyl. 
We think about the devastation and 
the suffering years ago in the Vietnam 
war, a decade where we lost about 
70,000 servicemembers. We think about 
what we lose every single year, not in 
a decade, but every single year from 
drug overdoses. That is about 70,000, 
largely because of what happens at the 
border. 
Just a few months ago, when I was 
down there visiting with our Customs 
and Border Patrol agents, they were off 
duty that day. We were in a pickup 
truck as far as from here to, Madam 
Speaker, where you sit. They slammed 
on the brakes and said: I am sorry. I 
have got to go on duty. I have to arrest 
these cartel members. 
He said the sad thing is they will be 
back out on the street or, in this case, 
back out in the desert in just a few 
days. 
We looked all up and down the bor-
der, and there was tens of millions of 
dollars of steel just laying there. Then 
there was tens of millions of dollars’ 
worth of idle diesel equipment that has 
been idle since January 20 of last year. 
He said: You know what? We need to 
finish this wall. 
That is what the Customs and Border 
Patrol agent told me. He says: But 
what we really need, what we really 
need is an administration that has our 
back and, sir, right now, we don’t have 
that. 
Instead, Madam Speaker, what we 
have is an astounding 11,200 pounds of 
fentanyl, deadly fentanyl that was 
seized last year, and even more has 
made it into the homeland. It is killing 
thousands of our fellow Americans. 
Dangerous cartels are flooding this 
country with counterfeit prescription 
pills containing fentanyl and meth. All 
of this can be prevented and should be 
prevented. It must be prevented. 
The bottom line is it is time to finish 
the wall. It is time to support our bor-
der agents and end this administra-
tion’s dereliction of duty. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
this is a gravely serious matter. I high-
lighted a young lady, Lizzie Murphy; 
her sister, Catherine; her mom and dad, 
Mark and Kristi Murphy, who lost 
their daughter, their best friend, their 
sister. 
Communities like this are losing 
young people all over our country. I 
kind of wish I could say that it was 
only happening where the sanctuary 
cities are pictured. I kind of wish I 
could say it was only right next to the 
border that we have the problem. 
But our whole country is experi-
encing the problem because we won’t 
secure the border. This administration 
won’t secure the border. They won’t 
listen to the men and women whose 
duty it is to secure the border. 
I went down there a week after Joe 
Biden was inaugurated and they said: 
We told him. We will see what happens. 
They said they are going to do these 
things, and we told them this is what is 
going to happen. 
Now, when we go to the border, when 
they come and talk to us up here, the 
exact same things they knew were 
going to happen are happening. 
We stopped sanctuary cities. We put 
strings attached to the grants. But the 
other thing is we have this Flores set-
tlement. Congress has not provided 
clarity on the Flores settlement, so we 
provide funding so that we can hold 
people as long as they need to be held 
till their cases are adjudicated on the 
Mexican side of the border. 
We put pressure on the Government 
of Mexico to cooperate with us in this, 
and we put pressure on the Government 
of Mexico to resume their cooperation 
on intelligence-gathering. 
Just yesterday, ahead of the State of 
the Union, I have my county sheriffs— 
Butler County Sheriff Jones was here 
in Washington, D.C. Why? Not because 
he is a border sheriff in the strict geo-
graphical sense, but because he is a 
border sheriff there in Ohio. 
Let me close, Madam Speaker, by 
just highlighting that what happened 
to this family could happen to any-
body. I appreciate the time to speak to-
night. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tions of our world. Do not abandon 
those who put their trust in You. Lord, 
provide our Senators with a durable

sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be

f 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
for my remarks. 
Earlier this morning, it was an 
honor—a truly rare honor in my time 
in public service—to meet with Judge 
Jackson for the first time since her 
nomination to the Supreme Court. Be-
fore the meeting, I said Judge Jackson 
was brilliant and beloved, but now that 
I have met her, I will add another 
word: ‘‘belongs.’’ She is not only bril-
liant and beloved but belongs on the 
Supreme Court. 
I believe her nomination certainly 
merits a good number of votes from 
both parties, and I hope we see that as 
we move forward in the process. I am 
certain that when other Senators have 
a chance to meet with Judge Jackson, 
they will understand why she is beyond 
qualified to replace Justice Breyer on 
the Supreme Court. 
For one, if confirmed, Judge Jackson 
would have one of the most diverse pro-
fessional backgrounds of any sitting 
Justice. Throughout her career, she 
has been a Federal defender; worked in 
private practice; sat on the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission; served as a dis-
trict judge and as a circuit court judge 
on the DC Circuit; and of course, she 
was a clerk to Justice Breyer, the very 
same Justice whose seat she would now 
fill. 
As a district judge, Judge Jackson 
rendered more than 550 rulings and was 
rarely reversed by higher courts, illus-
trating her evenhanded application of 
the law and facts. Then, when you 
meet with her, you see that she has 
brought that broad experience and 
adopted 
it 
into 
her 
being. 
She 
empathizes with people. She empha-
sized to me that as a judge, she should 
try to understand both sides. You could 
tell, when you met her, that she really 
believed it and, since, has sort of inte-
grated all of her experiences into her 
being. She had an incredibly phe-
nomenal interview, as well as has an 
amazing record. 
For all of these reasons, Judge Jack-
son’s nomination has already won sup-
port from individuals and organiza-
tions across the political spectrum. 
She is supported by civil rights advo-
cates; she is supported by conservative 
judges and lawyers; she is supported by 
the Fraternal Order of Police. Someone 
who was a public defender is now sup-
ported by the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice? You can’t get much better than 
that. And she is supported by scores of

men and women who had the honor of 
working with her over the years. 
I have gone through her record. You 
can hardly find a single person she has 
met, as she has walked through life and 
met people, who has said a bad thing 
about her. And when you meet her, you 
can see why. When you meet her, you 
can see why. 
America will be much better off with 
someone like Judge Jackson on the Su-
preme Court. Our country deserves 
someone deeply experienced, broadly 
supported, and someone whose ele-
vation as the first Black woman Jus-
tice signifies a long overdue step to-
ward perfecting our Union. 
I am grateful to have had the chance 
to have met with the judge. I thank her 
for her time this morning, and I look 
forward to working with my colleagues 
to elevate this outstanding nominee to 
the Supreme Court very soon. 
In having met her and having studied 
her record, she deserves the support of 
Members from the other side of the 
aisle, and I am hopeful she will get a 
good number of them to support her. 
f 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the 
State of the Union, last night, before a 
joint session of Congress, President 
Biden made the case to the Nation and 
to the world that in the face of im-
mense challenges, the United States re-
mains strong and ready to meet the 
tests of our time. 
In an hour-long speech delivered be-
fore a Chamber that was much fuller 
than last year, President Biden dem-
onstrated, yet again, the kind of leader 
he has been all of his life: optimistic, 
unifying, decent, and honest. He is hon-
est about where we are today and 
where we must go. I applaud President 
Biden for laying out a bold, strong, and 
comprehensive vision that will reso-
nate with the vast majority of Ameri-
cans. 
In particular, I was glad the Presi-
dent 
focused 
on 
three 
important 
things. First, he united the parties in 
supporting Ukraine and against Putin. 
Second, he showed how under Demo-
cratic leadership America has turned 
the corner on COVID. Third, he con-
fronted the urgency of lowering costs 
for American families, something our 
caucus has been focusing on. 
First, I was glad that President 
Biden united the room, the country, 
and the world in opposing Vladimir 
Putin and his savage assaults on 
Ukraine. It is obvious that the Presi-
dent has done an incredibly good job in 
unifying the Europeans and the West 
as a united front against Putin. That 
was felt by people on both sides of the 
aisle. 
When the President called on the 
Chamber to stand up and applaud 
Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian Am-
bassador, the feeling in the room re-
minded me of the unity we all felt after 
9/11. But just like on 9/11, that unity 
comes with the sobering recognition 
that the scale of Putin’s brutality in 
Ukraine is worsening. Ukraine’s State 
Emergency Service reported this morn-
ing that more than 2,000 civilians—2,000 
men, women, and children—children— 
have now been killed as a result of 
Putin’s savage brutality. 
What is happening in Ukraine is car-
nage, and the blood of every one of 
those innocent people falls on the 
hands of Vladimir Putin and on his 
band of crony oligarchs. This evil man 
must be stopped. 
As an important step, last night, the 
Senate unanimously passed bipartisan 
legislation that will protect America, 
our government, and our critical infra-
structure from cyber attacks. Finally, 
the holds were lifted from the other 
side of the aisle, and we passed unani-
mously this cyber legislation. It is 
more important now than ever before 
because Putin is brandishing a cyber 
weapon. 
Cyber warfare is truly one of the 
dark arts perfected by Putin’s authori-
tarian regime. It is a weapon he is 
happy to employ around the world. 
When our authorities in government 
know of these attacks, they can pre-
pare against future attacks. They will 
know who is attacking, where they are 
attacking, how they are attacking, and 
that will allow them to strengthen our 
defenses against future cyber attacks. 
Many in the industry—at times, I be-
lieve even the Chamber of Commerce— 
were not for this legislation, but with 
the urgency of the moment—the need 
to protect ourselves from cyber at-
tacks—finally, the Senate rose to the 
occasion. So I thank Senators PETERS 
and PORTMAN for getting this bill done. 
The passage of this bill was little no-
ticed because it came right before Con-
gress adjourned for the State of the 
Union, but it is a giant step forward to 
protecting ourselves, and I am glad 
that we got it done last night. But, of 
course, we must do more. 
The Senate must keep working on a 
bipartisan basis to pass a robust aid 
package in the upcoming omnibus so 
we can send an unmistakable message 
to Ukraine that we stand with them 
and a message to Putin that we stand 
against him. The quickest way we can 
assure that aid reaches Ukraine is 
through the omnibus, which needs to 
get done next week; so I am glad that 
we seem to be having bipartisan sup-
port to get that done. 
Second, I was also glad President 
Biden showed how the country under 
Democratic leadership is turning the 
corner in the fight against COVID–19. 
By passing legislation last year to fund 
vaccines, expand testing, and support 
our healthcare workers, we are beating 
this disease. 
What the President said last night 
was absolutely correct in that we can-
not—we cannot—have COVID control 
our lives anymore, but neither can we 
let our guard down. Right now, as cases 
are dropping across the board, Congress 
must pass more funding for vaccines, 
testing, and therapeutics. 
‘‘Therapeutics’’ is a word for medica-
tion that helps alleviate the virulence 
of COVID. Very few people who take 
the therapeutics have to be hospital-
ized. We also have to ensure that our 
doctors and nurses and healthcare 
workers are prepared in case another 
variant comes this way so that we can 
stay as close to normal as possible even 
if another variant arrives. We have to 
have an ample supply of vaccines, of 
therapeutics, and of testing ahead of 
time. We cannot wait. Some of our Re-
publican colleagues seem to be saying: 
Oh, we don’t need this now. 
We do need it now while we still have 
the chance. If Congress waits until an-
other variant arrives, it will be too 
late. 
Let me say that again. Even as cases 
drop across the board, we cannot be 
complacent against COVID. Congress 
must pass more COVID funding now so 
we can be ready by funding vaccines, 
testing, therapeutics, and supporting 
our healthcare workers. If Congress 
waits until another variant arrives, it 
will be too late. So we need our Repub-
lican colleagues to join us in a bipar-
tisan way, just as they are joining us 
on Ukraine. 
Finally, I am glad that President 
Biden zeroed in on cutting costs for 
American families. A year into the 
President’s first year, the economy is 
surging and creating an unprecedented 
number of jobs. But people are strug-
gling because costs are also going up. 
Your wages are going up, but if the 
costs keep going up, it eats up those 
wage increases. 
Now, why are costs up? Costs are up 
because of supply chain disruptions 
stemming from COVID and pent-up de-
mand, as people during COVID didn’t 
buy a lot of things. All the while, 
Americans are watching incredulously 
as some of our largest corporations are 
raising prices despite growing profits. 
In some cases, executives are seeing 
lavish pay increases, and in the end, 
Americans are footing the bill. 
Senate Democrats will not stand for 
this, and we are working with the 
President to lower costs and build upon 
the wage growth we have seen over the 
past year. We are laser-focused on re-
ducing America’s costs, from lowering 
the costs of insulin so no one pays 
more than $35 a month, to lowering the 
cost of all prescription drugs, to low-
ering the cost of meat at the grocery 
store, to fixing our ocean shipping lines 
so the bottlenecks don’t raise their 
costs. Shipping costs have gone way 
up, as the President mentioned. 
Do you know what else we can do to 
lower costs? We can innovate. Congress 
should continue working to finalize our 
bipartisan, bicameral jobs and supply 
chains bill so we can boost American 
manufacturing, solve our chip crisis, 
and make our country less dependent 
on foreign tech companies. 
In short, despite everything 
the 
world faces, President Biden reminded 
supporters and critics alike why the 
American people entrusted him with

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
night, President Biden gave a State of 
the Union Address that might have 
worked OK for a popular administra-
tion that had been successfully tack-
ling America’s problems and naturally 
earning high marks, but that is not the 
reality in which we live. 
Democrats spent the last 12 months 
making major and painful policy er-
rors. The public overwhelmingly dis-
approves. President Biden didn’t need 
to stay the course and rehash a scat-
tered wish list; he needed to make a 
dramatic pivot. But he chose not to. 
The 
President 
first 
discussed 
Ukraine. Everyone agrees with the sen-
timents President Biden expressed, but 
the sentiments are not enough. The 
President articulated no meaningful 
new steps, no specific plan. He made no 
explicit commitment to keep flowing 
weapons, intelligence, and advanced 
capabilities into Ukraine as long as the 
Ukrainians need them, nor did he ex-
plain why his administration was slow 
to provide lethal assistance in the first 
place. Instead, the President focused on 
trying to claim credit for the remark-
able European and worldwide response 
that his administration did not foresee, 
let alone orchestrate. 
Apart from Ukraine, the President’s 
other remarks on our dangerous world 
were not just insufficient; they were 
basically nonexistent. 
The President spoke for over an hour 
but only mentioned China twice. Nei-
ther time had anything to do with na-
tional security or military moderniza-
tion. The President only mentioned 
Iran one time, and it was literally by 
accident. There were zero mentions of 
North Korea, zero mentions of the 
botched Afghanistan retreat the ad-
ministration originally boasted was a 
‘‘success.’’ Our 13 servicemembers who 
lost 
their 
lives 
were 
completely 
unmentioned until Governor Reynolds 
took the microphone. And there were 
zero mentions of rebuilding the defense 
budget that President Biden actually 
tried to cut last year. 
Meanwhile, the President’s speech 
tried to skate by the serious kitchen- 
table concerns that are actually keep-
ing families up at night. The President 
talked about ‘‘made in America’’ but 
keeps fighting against energy inde-
pendence. Democrats want us to ‘‘Buy 
American’’ but not American oil or 
gas. On President Biden’s watch, we 
have set a new record for importing 
Russian oil, and we are begging OPEC 
to produce even more, and his energy 
vision is to dump huge subsidies into 
supply chains that are dominated by 
China—borrowing from our grandkids 
to build back Beijing. 
The President tried yet again to re-
vive the zombie spending plans which a 
bipartisan majority of Senators have 
already killed and buried because they 
would make inflation even worse. He 
tried to brag about fancy technology 
on our southern border, as if we hadn’t 
just seen a new record for illegal cross-
ings on his watch. 
The President’s address was not re-
sponsive to the country’s concerns. He 
needed to pivot, but he didn’t. 
CNN conducted an instant poll. As 
you 
might 
expect, 
it 
oversampled 
Democrats. Even so, the percentage 
who gave the President’s speech high 
marks was the lowest they have seen in 
15 years. 
Iowa’s hugely successful Governor, 
Kim Reynolds, offered the clearest pos-
sible contrast. She spoke for the work-
ing families who are suffering under 
Democrat policies. She outlined a com-
monsense Republican vision of sta-
bility at home, strength abroad, law 
and order on our streets, and sanity in 
our public schools. 
November is just months away. If 
President 
Biden 
does 
not 
correct 
course sharply and quickly, the Amer-
ican people may correct course for him. 
TRIBUTE TO ANGIE SCHULTE 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, one of the occupational 
hazards of Senate service is having to 
say goodbye to truly remarkable staff 
professionals. 
I have already been through this 
rodeo with Angie Schulte. All the way 
back in 1988, this dedicated caseworker 
left my office for the nonprofit sector, 
but back in 2010, I leapt at the chance 
to hire Angie back as my State office 
manager, and her second tour of duty 
has been a huge success. 
I have known Angie for 40 years now. 
I have watched her master a wide vari-
ety of roles. She is an integral part of 
my State office. She keeps all of us on 
task and on time. But, unfortunately, 
tomorrow, her second tour of service 
will end with a second farewell. Angie 
is retiring after decades of hard work 
and phenomenal public service. 
For 12 years, Angie has been the 
steady rudder steering my instate 
team. If there was a complicated prob-
lem, she would fix it; a scheduling con-
flict, she would resolve it; a new staffer 
needed help growing into her role, she 
would provide it. Angie combines me-
ticulous 
efficiency 
with 
a 
totally 
charming and cheerful demeanor. 
My relationship with Angie actually 
predates my time in the Senate. Her 
mother Jeannette was my personnel di-
rector for my county administration. I 
was a newly elected Republican in a 
heavily Democratic county govern-
ment who needed all the smarts and all 
the help that I could get. Angie’s moth-
er Jeannette proved invaluable. 
In 1982, her daughter Angie came on 
board as office receptionist. I quickly 
promoted her, not once but twice. She 
served as office manager in my Neigh-
borhood Response Office. When I won 
statewide in 1984, Angie was one of my 
first hires. 
With the same vigor that helped Lou-
isville residents settle property dis-
putes and parking tickets, Angie began 
helping Kentuckians across the State 
navigate the morass of Federal Govern-
ment redtape. Expertise, an eye for de-
tail—Angie grew into the consummate 
public servant. Our whole team was 
overjoyed to welcome Angie back after 
her tenure with Metro United Way, one 
of the Commonwealth’s largest non-
profits. 
Angie is famous for humming and 
whistling while she works and for 
throwing extravagant birthday parties 
for her colleagues. She is unfailingly 
upbeat. She has a permanent positive 
attitude and, boy, does she get results 
for Kentucky. 
As you can see, it has been an honor 
to have Angie’s talents on our team. I 
am just grateful that when her sterling 
40-year career concludes tomorrow, a 
40-year friendship will not. 
So, Angie, I wish you every happiness 
as you spend more time with Steve, 
with Kathleen and Becca, and with 
those grandkids, Grant, Logan, and 
Elizabeth. 
I am eternally grateful for your out-
standing good work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S924 
March 2, 2022 
State of the Union Address. While the 
President tried to put a positive spin 
on things, the truth of the matter is 
the United States is not thriving under 
Democratic control. 
On the economic front, of course, 
Americans are struggling under the 
burden of the worst inflation in 40 
years. There are Americans raising 
families today who had not yet been 
born the last time inflation was this 
bad. 
Under Democratic control, Ameri-
cans have seen their standard of living 
decline as they face massive increases 
in the price of basic necessities from 
groceries to gas. Inflation is so bad 
that despite wage increases in 2021, 
Americans saw a de facto pay cut. 
After months of ignoring soaring infla-
tion numbers, the President and con-
gressional Democrats have at last been 
forced to start talking about inflation. 
Unfortunately, it has become clear 
they still don’t understand why this in-
flation disaster happened and how their 
massive government spending spree— 
the so-called American Rescue Plan 
Act—helped create this crisis. ‘‘The 
American Rescue Plan helped working 
people—and left no one behind,’’ the 
President said in his speech last night. 
‘‘It worked.’’ ‘‘It worked,’’ he said. If 
President Biden believes that, I have 
some oceanfront property in South Da-
kota to sell him. 
The truth of the matter is that work-
ing Americans are struggling right now 
in large part due to the American Res-
cue Plan. The American Rescue Plan 
Act was not a targeted COVID relief 
bill. It was a massive, unnecessary 
spending spree that sent too much gov-
ernment money into the economy, and, 
predictably, the economy overheated 
as a result. 
I am glad that Democrats are start-
ing to acknowledge our inflation crisis, 
but it would be nice to see them recog-
nize how it actually came about and 
commit to not repeating their mis-
takes in the future. 
Inflation is not the only domestic 
crisis that we have been facing on 
Democrats’ watch. Our Nation is also 
experiencing a border crisis that has 
resulted in a security, enforcement, 
and humanitarian nightmare. Almost 
from the day the President took office, 
we have seen a massive surge in at-
tempted illegal immigration across our 
southern border, and there is no end in 
sight. 
In January, the Border Patrol en-
countered more than 150,000 individuals 
illegally trying to cross our southern 
border, the highest January number in 
more than 20 years. These numbers, of 
course, only reflect individuals the 
Border Patrol has been able to appre-
hend. A Department of Homeland Secu-
rity official recently stated that more 
than 200,000 individuals have success-
fully evaded apprehension since Octo-
ber 
and 
have 
disappeared—dis-
appeared—into our country, more than 
200,000 individuals. It is not surprising. 
The Border Patrol is stretched thin and 
lacks sufficient resources to deal with 
this never-ending border surge. But it 
is deeply concerning. There are 200,000 
people entering our country without 
any security check or vetting, raising 
the risk of drug traffickers, criminals, 
or even terrorists finding their way 
into our communities. 
But perhaps the most concerning 
thing is that a full year after this mas-
sive surge began, the President gen-
erally continues to act as if this border 
crisis doesn’t exist. He is apparently 
unaware of or can’t be bothered to deal 
with the real security risk that this 
represents for our country. 
The President did allude to securing 
the border last night—something he 
does periodically—but given his track 
record, I am not holding my breath. In 
fact, he hasn’t even visited it nor has 
the Vice President, for that matter. 
When it comes to the world stage, 
things are a little better. The Presi-
dent’s first year in office was distin-
guished by his disastrous withdrawal 
from Afghanistan, which weakened our 
national 
security, 
diminished 
our 
standing with our allies, and resulted 
in our abandoning thousands of Af-
ghans who had worked with us and 
whom we had promised to protect. 
Currently, we are facing another 
international 
crisis—Russia’s 
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. While 
this is a crisis of Vladimir Putin’s 
making, President Biden was slow to 
move weapons and resisted imposing 
sanctions before Russia attacked. I 
hope that in the days to come, the 
President will stand strong against 
Russian aggression and not hesitate to 
impose any additional sanctions that 
may be necessary to isolate Putin and 
his cronies and to halt the Russian ad-
vance. 
As I said, the United States is not 
thriving under Democratic control. A 
big reason for that is because the 
President and congressional Democrats 
have had one thing on their minds 
since taking office and that is imple-
menting a wide-ranging, far-left social-
ist agenda. 
Democrats’ lack of leadership on the 
big issues facing our country and our 
world has been striking. I think the 
truth is that Democrats have seen 
those big issues as distractions from 
their real goal in taking office, and 
that is implementing that far-left 
agenda. While inflation spiked and 
then spiked again, Democrats were 
AWOL. They were focused on passing a 
massive tax-and-spending spree that 
would unquestionably make our infla-
tion problem even worse. 
And when that failed, they turned 
their focus to a Federal takeover of 
election law that they hoped would 
give them an advantage in the Novem-
ber elections. 
This week, as Vladimir Putin contin-
ued to pursue his apparent dream of re-
constituting the Soviet Union by push-
ing further into Ukraine, Democrats 
took a vote on, of all things, legisla-
tion to remove virtually all State-level 
restrictions on abortion. 
Yes, that was the big vote this 
week—legislation to remove nearly 
every State-level restriction on abor-
tion, despite the fact, I might add, that 
the majority of the American people 
support restrictions on abortion. But 
that doesn’t matter to Democrats. If 
the Planned Parenthood wing of the 
party wants a vote on unrestricted 
abortion on demand, that is what it 
gets. 
In yet another example of just how 
far the Democratic Party has run to 
the left and just how disconnected 
Democrats have become, last week, 
John Kerry, who serves as President 
Biden’s climate chief, expressed his 
hope that war with Ukraine would be 
averted because of the carbon emis-
sions such a war would create and how 
the war might distract from climate 
change. 
You can’t make it up. At the time of 
his remarks, Russia was on the verge of 
invading a sovereign nation—and pos-
sibly condemning an entire country to 
Soviet oppression—and a key member 
of the President’s administration was 
worried about how the war might dis-
tract from climate change. 
I am a longtime supporter of clean 
energy, but we have a big problem 
when members of our country’s leader-
ship are looking at the imperialist 
takeover of a sovereign nation, and 
their biggest concern is not human life 
and human freedom but carbon emis-
sions. 
But it is another sign of just how ide-
ological the Democratic Party has be-
come. Nothing—nothing—is allowed to 
come between the Democratic Party 
and its far-left agenda. 
President Biden made some nods to-
ward bipartisanship last night, but it 
remains to be seen whether Democrats 
and the President are capable of set-
ting aside their far-left agenda to ad-
dress the priorities facing this country. 
And given some of the measures the 
President proposed last night, I have 
my doubts. 
But I hope—I hope for the sake of our 
Nation—the Democrats will rethink 
their evermore rigid allegiance to the 
far left and instead work with Repub-
licans in a bipartisan fashion. 
The American people deserve better 
than what Democrats have given them 
over this past year. 
I yield the floor.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, as I 
speak here today on the U.S. Postal 
Service Reform Act, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin is waging a cruel, un-
just, and barbaric war of choice, fi-
nanced by a global addiction to fossil 
fuels, an addiction which Russia is only 
too happy to exploit right now. 
And the most effective way to reduce 
the 
long-term 
security 
threat 
to 
Ukraine and Europe and the United 
States and the whole world is to say 
that we are going to empty Vladimir 
Putin’s oil-and-gas-funded piggy bank, 
setting ourselves and our allies on the 
course to a future powered by domestic 
clean energy. 
We can use the power of our Federal 
Government to not only apply sanc-
tions but also destroy Putin’s dirty en-
ergy business model. 
The U.S. Government has 700,000 ve-
hicles in its fleet, and 160,000 of the 
U.S. Government’s vehicles belong to 
the U.S. Postal Service. Our Postal 
Service could play an important role in 
destroying the Putin business model by 
committing to clean instead of dirty 
energy to fuel its fleet. And it should 
start by reversing Postmaster General 
Louis DeJoy’s short-term decision to 
buy dirty, new postal trucks, energy- 
inefficient postal trucks, gas-guzzling 
postal trucks. 
As we import oil from Russia, we 
don’t need a new fleet of gas-guzzling 
postal vehicles in the United States be-
cause if we don’t get a truly next-gen-
eration electric fleet of postal trucks, 
we need the next generation of Postal 
Service leadership delivered express to 
the American people. 
This is just the latest stop in DeJoy’s 
disastrous postal route, and it is time 
for him to resign. This is just a leftover 
agenda from the Trump years, this 
commitment to inefficiency, to the 
consumption unnecessarily of oil and 
natural gas in our country. 
The Postal Service Board of Gov-
ernors and the Biden administration 
just can’t let this bad business, bad-for- 
climate, bad-for-health decision stand. 
If DeJoy won’t get rid of this decision, 
the U.S. Postal Service should get rid 
of him, especially at this moment 
where Russia is fueling an unconscion-
able invasion of Ukraine with oil 
money from the United States. 
It is the American people who have 
been paying $20 billion a year for Rus-
sian oil coming into our country to put 
in the gasoline tanks of the United 
States. And then he takes that money 
and uses it to buy tanks and planes and 
weapons to invade the Ukraine. 
A new fleet of electric postal trucks 
would receive a stamp of approval from 
the American people as it would lower 
costs, reduce pollution, and provide 
public health benefits while backing 
out the Russian oil that comes into our 
country every single day. 
Louis DeJoy wants to claim he 
doesn’t have the money to go electric, 
but that false statement should be 
marked ‘‘return to sender.’’ 
One study found that full electrifica-
tion would save the U.S. Postal Service 
$4.3 billion over the lifetime of the 
fleet. In other words, going all electric 
saves money for the American tax-
payer because going all electric is 
cheaper than going all gasoline or all 
diesel. We just save money, but we 
don’t have to send any money to Putin 
to run our Postal Service because that 
just doesn’t make any sense in 2022. 
Since taking office in 2020, Louis 
DeJoy has tried to pinch pennies at the 
U.S. Postal Service, so why is he now 
proposing a fiscally irresponsible plan 
that leaves $4.3 billion on the table in-
stead of in U.S. Postal Service’s budg-
et? 
If our new postal fleet is made up of 
vehicles that get less than 10 miles to 
the gallon, no better than the vehicles 
already in use, we are going to be tying 
our mail delivery system of the future 
to the dirty oil, inefficient oil, ineffi-
cient vehicle strategy of the past. 
We shouldn’t be proposing the Postal 
Service use the same energy from the 
time of the Pony Express, and these ve-
hicles that we are using today move at 
about the same speed as the Pony Ex-
press. 
It is time for us to just think smarter 
and not harder. That is all electric. 
That is backing out oil. That is just 
saying that we can have an infinity 
sign next to the efficiency of these ve-
hicles which we are driving and not 
this 10-mile-a-gallon, 1930s, 1920s view 
of how efficient the postal vehicles in 
our country should be. 
So this is simple. Electric postal 
trucks are cheaper. Electric postal 
trucks are cleaner. And this isn’t char-
ity; it is business. And you don’t have 
to take my word for it. Ask some of 
our most successful companies in the 
mail delivery industry. 
These are the competitors to the 
Postal Service. The Postal Service is 
constantly coming up here saying that 
we need more subsidies; we need more 
help to compete against these private- 
sector competitors. Well, UPS just 
placed a 10,000-vehicle purchase order 
for electric trucks. FedEx is moving to 
achieve a fully electric fleet by the 
year 2040. And Amazon is purchasing 
100,000 new electric delivery vehicles; 
that is 20 times more than our U.S. 
Postal Service is planning to get under 
Louis DeJoy. 
These trucks also would work for 
UPS routes today. Ninety-six percent 
of USPS routes are compatible with 
electric postal routes. Electric vehicles 
aren’t the future; they work for us, for 
our budgets, and for our energy secu-
rity right now. 
We need to protect our planet, and 
having all electric vehicles just dra-
matically reduces the greenhouse gases 
that we emit. But we also have to pro-
tect our national security. We have to 
be telling Russia that we don’t need 
your oil any more than we need your 
caviar. 
And the only way to do it, ulti-
mately, is for the United States—you 
just find a way to break our addiction. 
And the way to break our addiction is 
to just move to the kinds of transpor-
tation, automotive, U.S. Postal Service 
vehicles that don’t need oil and still 
get you just where you want to go. 
So that is our challenge right now. 
And we need to protect everything—ev-
erything—our health, our environment, 
our economy, our national security, 
and our own morality by ensuring that 
we move in this direction. 
And we need to protect our planet 
and our Postal Service by putting a 
‘‘Forever Stamp’’ on our transpor-
tation future, a fleet of battery-oper-
ated electric vehicles that will usher in 
a clean vehicle revolution in America 
and destroy the demand for oil and gas 
so that the business model of Russia is 
destroyed. 
This is the weapon that we can be 
using. This is the message we should be 
sending to the rest of the world. So I 
urge the White House, the U.S. Postal 
Service, and the Congress to take any 
and all possible steps to right this 
wrong decision from Louis DeJoy. The 
U.S. Postal Service needs to tear up 
this deal and buy a clean fleet, and if it 
doesn’t, it needs to get a clean start 
without Louis DeJoy, who is looking at 
the world in a rearview mirror. 
You have to look straight ahead to 
this all-electric vehicle future. Let’s 
ensure that the Postal Service’s next- 
generation delivery vehicles create a 
livable world for the next generation, 
not only of America but as a model for 
what the rest of the world has to do. 
What I hear from my Republican 
friends, what I hear from the American 
petroleum industry is, well, the Biden 
administration should just open up 
more leases to drill for oil, open up 
more leases immediately for more 
drilling. 
Well, here is the problem with the 
Republican Party; here is the problem 
with the American Petroleum Insti-
tute: The oil industry, the oil giants, 
have hoarded thousands and thousands 
of leases on public lands all across the 
United States, and they have not 
drilled on them. 
I have introduced legislation for 
years saying: Use it or lose it. You 
want the lease? You say it is impera-
tive? You are going to pay for that 
lease and then you don’t drill on it? 
Do you know what they are doing? 
They just hoard all of that land, and 
the land is the size of huge States in 
our country. That is how much land 
they have right now or that is owned

by the American people and leased to 
the oil companies. 
So they want to start drilling? Why 
did you bid for all those leases in the 
years gone by? Do you want to know 
why? They want to use this whole Rus-
sia situation as an opportunity to get 
even more leases that they won’t drill 
on and to get them cheap and to create 
a false sense of emergency here, when, 
if they want to drill, they have already 
got all of the leases they would ever 
need. They have a backlog of 20 years 
they haven’t even started on. 
So when you hear these crocodile 
tears from the American petroleum in-
dustry, from the American prevari-
cation industry, that is what it is all 
about. If they wanted to drill, they 
would be drilling right now—onshore, 
offshore. They have the leases. All they 
want to do is just get more and more 
and more and cheaper and cheaper and 
cheaper from the American people, 
while fighting to stop an all-electric 
vehicle revolution, stop a wind and 
solar revolution in our country. That is 
what their agenda is. That is what the 
American Petroleum Institute is all 
about—it is stopping an all-electric 
revolution; it is stopping a wind and 
solar revolution; it is stopping a bat-
tery revolution—because it destroys 
their business model as well, while 
hoarding leases, not drilling on them, 
and then coming in here hat in hand, 
demanding, in a lot of ways, that we 
give them even more leases that they 
are not going to drill on. They are just 
going to hoard it and save it for years, 
decades, generations to come. It is sad. 
It is a sad commentary on American 
corporate greed, but that is where we 
stand right now. 
So just be prepared to hear more lies 
from the American oil industry, lies 
that go right to the heart of what we 
really have to do as Americans for the 
next generation, and that is to stand 
up to those oil companies, stand up to 
the Russian oil oligarchs, and say: We 
are moving away from you historically. 
That is what young people in our coun-
try want. They want us to unleash our 
technological 
innovation 
genius 
in 
order to solve this problem, and it is 
wind, it is solar and all-electric vehi-
cles and battery storage technologies. 
And it is a moral challenge for us. It is 
a national security challenge for us. It 
is an environmental challenge for us. It 
is an economic challenge for us. 
We can already see the impact this 
oil control of the global economy has 
upon ordinary consumers in America 
and the rest of the world. Inflation is 
spiking—oil. 
Russia 
is 
invading 
Ukraine—oil. A new U.N. report says 
that we now have an evermore dan-
gerous warming of our planet—oil. And 
what did they do? They continued to 
lie. They continued to try to control 
our agenda so that we cannot pass the 
legislation to unleash our techno-
logical genius. That is our greatest 
strength. Their greatest strengths are 
their 
natural 
resources, 
but 
ulti-
mately, our greatest renewable re-
sources are the brains of the American 
people, especially the younger people, 
because if they were unleashed to in-
vent and deploy all of these new tech-
nologies, it would revolutionize not 
just our country but revolutionize the 
whole rest of the world. 
We gave the young people in our 
country in the 1990s and the early 2000s 
a chance to do that with our tele-
communications system. It is now 
called 
the 
internet. 
It 
is 
called 
broadband. Young people did that. We 
have to give the same opportunity to 
young people to do the same thing so 
that we back out the oil, we revolu-
tionize the way in which we transport 
ourselves, and we give hope to the rest 
of the planet that the United States is 
going to use all of its resources to ac-
complish that goal. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last 
night, of course, we all listened to 
President Biden’s prime-time oppor-
tunity to explain what his administra-
tion is doing to address the many chal-
lenges that our Nation is facing. 
Here at home, we know family budg-
ets are being plundered by the worst 
inflation in four decades. We are pay-
ing higher prices for everything from 
food to gasoline. We also know that 
there have been spikes in violent crime 
that have created public safety con-
cerns in communities across the coun-
try. After a year of hearing folks on 
the Democratic side of the aisle, the 
progressive base of the Democratic 
Party, calling for defunding the police, 
it was welcome to hear the President 
say last night that we should fund the 
police. It is long overdue. 
Of course, there is the humanitarian 
crisis at the southern border. As I have 
said before, Texas has 1,200 miles of 
common border with Mexico, and, of 
course, we have seen records shattered 
month after month of people coming 
across the border, claiming asylum, 
and then being placed by U.S. authori-
ties into the interior of the United 
States, given a notice to appear for a 
future court hearing, which, in all like-
lihood, will never occur. 
The human smugglers and drug car-
tels have figured out the weaknesses in 
our own laws and policies, and they are 
exploiting them, to the detriment of 
the American people. 
On drugs alone, 100,000 Americans 
died of drug overdoses last year, the 
overwhelming amount of which those 
drugs came across the southern border 
into the United States. And the cartels 
are smart. They figured out that if you 
flood the border with people, that is 
going to take the Border Patrol off the 
frontlines, and here come the drug car-
tels moving their poison across the 
border. 
Of course, the trials we are facing 
now abroad are not any easier. The pre-
cipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan 
without any kind of warning or con-
sultation with our NATO allies has 
caused the world to doubt the future of 
American leadership, and then the Chi-
nese Communist Party over in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China continues to 
commit genocide against the Uighurs 
and threaten attacks against a demo-
cratic Taiwan. 
Of course, very much on our minds 
today is the fact that Vladimir Putin is 
attempting to seize a sovereign nation 
and redraw the maps of Europe and 
testing the resolve of the United States 
and other democracies around the 
world. 
I, of course, like many, attended the 
President’s address last night and lis-
tened closely as he spoke about each of 
these challenges, beginning with the 
conflict—or 
I 
should 
say 
war—in 
Ukraine. 
When it comes to Russia, our allies 
are not strong enough on their own to 
deter Vladimir Putin or the Russian 
Federation. They are looking to the 
United States as part of NATO—the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization— 
for leadership. 
I was pleased to hear President Biden 
deliver a clear message to the world 
that we stand with the democracy in 
Ukraine and we will do everything we 
can to help the Ukrainians deter Putin 
and to defend their country. The Presi-
dent said we will continue to send mili-
tary, economic, and humanitarian as-
sistance to Ukraine, and it is clear that 
there is bipartisan support for that. 
But the fact of the matter is, most of 
our allies in Europe have been the ones 
who stepped up to the threat—of 
course, it is in their neighborhood—and 
we could have but did not impose sanc-
tions before Putin invaded rather than 
after the fact. 
I was disappointed that the President 
did not speak about what is at stake in 
Ukraine. It is something I talked about 
here on the floor a few weeks back. 
With so many challenges in our own 
backyard, it is easy for folks in Texas 
or Colorado or New Jersey or anywhere 
else around the country to wonder, why 
should I care about what is happening 
in Ukraine? 
Americans want to know, what dif-
ference does a war or a military con-
flict on the other side of the globe— 
what relevance does it have to me, and 
if it is important, how can we best 
help? 
Well, we know the answer to that 
question here in the House and the 
Senate. We know that this conflict is 
key to preserving our rules-based inter-
national order, that if Putin can get 
away with this, he can get away with 
anything. If Putin gets away with this, 
President Xi is waiting for his oppor-
tunity to unify Taiwan with mainland 
China. So this is a global geopolitical 
crisis. We know China and Iran, as I 
mentioned, and other adversaries are 
paying close attention. 
If Texans want America to stay out 
of another world war, then we better 
slam the door on Vladimir Putin now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S927 
March 2, 2022 
President Biden had a window to re-
mind the American people and our al-
lies around the world what is at stake 
in this conflict. Vladimir Putin has 
even put his nuclear forces on active 
reserve. He is rattling the nuclear 
sabre in order to threaten and intimi-
date NATO and the United States and 
the rest of the world, but he is also 
finding an incredible amount of cour-
age and resilience and leadership by 
people like President Zelenskyy in 
leading the courageous Ukrainian peo-
ple in their effort to resist this inva-
sion. 
So this is a very serious and very 
dangerous moment. Many of the things 
that Vladimir Putin has done are ee-
rily similar to what happened in Nazi 
Germany in the late 1930s and 1940s. 
On another topic, the President al-
luded to inflation last night, but he 
didn’t instill much confidence that he 
had a concept of what was at stake or 
how to solve the problem. When he 
talked about his plan to address infla-
tion, he said we need to cut our ex-
penses and overhead. Well, I talked to 
some of the cotton producers in Texas 
last week when I was home, and they 
told me that one of the biggest prob-
lems they have are the increasing costs 
of their inputs, things like diesel and 
energy, fertilizer, and the like. They 
don’t have any room to cut their over-
head unless they go out of business en-
tirely. 
So the President did not inspire 
much confidence when it came to deal-
ing with the scourge of inflation. But 
one thing we can do is quit making it 
worse by trying to continue to shovel 
more and more money out the door, 
chasing fewer and fewer goods and 
services. 
The President did try to recycle some 
of the elements of the Build Back Bet-
ter—or, as I like to call it, the ‘‘Build 
Back Broke’’—bill, but that bill, that 
policy is dead and buried. The Presi-
dent couldn’t even get support among 
his own political party. But he did try 
to rebrand it and respond to it in a 
way—rebrand it in a way that appeared 
to deal with the concerns that every-
body has about increasing costs and in-
flation, but it just did not make any 
sense. 
The President repeated the same line 
that has already been shot down a 
number of times. He talked about rais-
ing taxes on the American people, and 
he says no one earning $400,000 a year 
or less would pay a penny more under 
his plan. But, of course, this is the 
same President who said that the price 
of the $5 trillion Build Back Better bill 
was zero. I think the President has lost 
a lot of credibility when it comes to 
talking about taxes and spending. 
Well, what the President talked 
about last night was really a laundry 
list of his liberal agenda. This isn’t a 
new plan. This is the same old plan 
with a new name broken down into 
smaller pieces. None of this is going to 
address what is confronting the Amer-
ican people today when it comes to in-
flation or crime or the border or re-
gaining America’s leadership and credi-
bility in world affairs. 
While I mention crime, when it 
comes to crime, the President did af-
firm that defunding the police is not 
the answer. 
I see our friend, the Senator from 
New Jersey, on the floor of the Senate. 
I think he led an effort for us to have 
a vote on funding the police rather 
than defunding the police. 
Of course, this is a complete reversal 
from what we have heard from many of 
the President’s nominees, including 
those at the Department of Justice— 
people like Vanita Gupta who for 
months, if not years, chanted this 
mantra of defunding the police and 
criticizing the men and women in law 
enforcement who are the thin blue line 
between us and chaos. But there are 
some shining examples that I think the 
President could have pointed to. One is 
Dallas, TX. It is a shining example of 
how supporting our police both finan-
cially and with moral support and with 
smart plans can make a difference. 
In most major cities across the coun-
try today, crime is up in all categories. 
In Dallas, TX, violent crime is down by 
8.5 percent, and that is no accident. It 
is thanks to the great leadership of 
Dallas’s mayor Eric Johnson and Chief 
Garcia, chief of the Dallas Police De-
partment. 
I asked Chief Garcia yesterday in a 
hearing in front of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, I said: Is there any rea-
son, Chief Garcia, that the plan you 
implemented in Dallas couldn’t work 
elsewhere around the country? And he 
said: No, there is no reason. 
Of course, every plan needs to be 
adapted to local conditions; but what 
the Dallas Police Department and the 
city council and mayor have done is 
something that can be replicated in 
other parts of the country. 
Chief Garcia and other witnesses also 
testified to the importance of Project 
Safe Neighborhoods, which is a Federal 
program designed to go after gun 
criminals, particularly people who are 
felons in possession or people who use 
firearms for carjacking, drug trans-
actions, and the like. 
The fact of the matter is that Fed-
eral law with its mandatory minimum 
sentences for using a firearm illegally 
in violation of Federal law is a huge de-
terrent. And if you can’t deter people 
from using firearms, you certainly can 
lock them up for an extended period of 
time which, I think, sends a strong 
message that this sort of activity will 
not be tolerated and will deter future 
criminal activity. 
So there is a lot we can do when it 
comes to crime. We can also make sure 
that people who are suffering from 
mental health challenges aren’t di-
verted to jails and denied the treat-
ment that they need that can help 
them on the road to recovery. Those 
are the kinds of things that I wish we 
could have heard more about from the 
President last night. 
I was shocked when the President 
said we need immigration reform last 
night. I have been in the Senate for 
quite a while now, a member of the Ju-
diciary Committee. I am the ranking 
member 
on 
the 
Immigration 
Sub-
committee. When my party has been in 
the majority, I have been the chairman 
of the Immigration Subcommittee. For 
the President to say immigration re-
form is something we ought to do 
struck me as a throwaway line. And 
the reason I say that is because he has 
done nothing, zero, zip, nada, to stop 
the flood of migrants across our south-
ern border, together with the illegal 
drugs that come right behind them. 
I have tried to do my best on a bipar-
tisan basis working with people like 
Ms. SINEMA, a border State Senator 
from Arizona, to come up with some 
modest suggestions for the administra-
tion to deal with the crisis at our bor-
der. Unfortunately, we have not heard 
a peep out of the administration, at the 
same time that the President’s poll 
numbers, when it comes to border secu-
rity and immigration, are in the cellar. 
You would think that they would be 
looking for some sort of bipartisan op-
portunity to register a win and make 
some progress, but that would be 
wrong. 
Well, I was hopeful that we would 
hear more about the President’s plan 
to work with Republicans in a 50–50 
Senate to build consensus for bipar-
tisan solutions. Other than the bipar-
tisan support for Ukraine, we didn’t 
hear much about that last night. What 
we heard was a long laundry list of par-
tisan legislation that has been tried 
and failed during this last year. 
The Biden administration needs to do 
more to address inflation in a smart 
way—in an effective way. They need to 
do more to support our men and women 
in uniform who are the thin blue line 
between us and criminals; and they 
need to do something—anything—to 
address the humanitarian crisis at the 
southern border. 
I was hoping this could be a reset mo-
ment. You know, we all make mistakes 
in life, but the real test is whether we 
learn from those mistakes. But from 
the comments that the President made 
last night when it comes to these failed 
policies, it appears that he has learned 
nothing. 
The American people elected a 50–50 
Senate expecting to force us to work 
together, and we should do that. We 
should put the tried-and-true formula 
of building consensus and passing posi-
tive legislation to help the American 
people. We should use that formula 
again. It just simply blows my mind 
that the President and his party, with 
the prospect of an evenly divided Con-
gress, has tried to do so many things 
on a purely partisan basis, and, as you 
might expect, has failed to do so when 
he has been unable to unite even his 
own political party. 
Well, we need a stronger and a safer 
and a more prosperous country. As 
Governor Kim Reynolds said yesterday

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S928 
March 2, 2022 
evening, we can’t project strength 
abroad if we are weak at home. And we 
can’t support our allies, NATO, and our 
own military to deter authoritarian 
thugs like Putin if our economy isn’t 
strong here at home as well. 
So I continue to be an optimist and 
hope for the best, but last night’s mes-
sage was not encouraging. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1216 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to ask a unanimous 
consent request, and I am going to 
state the reasons for that before I ask 
for the request. And I appreciate my 
friend from New Jersey coming over to 
help me at this particular time. 
So, today, the issue is fentanyl. To-
day’s vote on this bill, as amended, 
should be a yes for every Member of 
the Senate. This measure extends the 
lifesaving authority placing fentanyl 
drugs in schedule I. In fact, a 15-month 
extension of this authority similar to 
the bill that I offer right now passed 
the Senate, and it passed the Senate 
unanimously in 2020. 
In case that you have not read the 
headlines for the past few years, 
fentanyl and its analogs are killing 
tens of thousands of Americans each 
year, and it happens that fentanyl and 
analogs are now the No. 1 cause of 
death for Americans ages 18 to 45, the 
most productive years of a person’s 
life. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion placed fentanyl and analogs on 
schedule I in the year 2018. Congress 
has already extended this authority 
like I am seeking today five times in 4 
years. Now, we are on the verge of ex-
tending it for a sixth time before it ex-
pires on March 11. 
During the Biden administration, 
these 
reauthorizations 
have 
gotten 
shorter and yet shorter. The periods of 
extension have been as short as just a 
few weeks. This has created constant 
doubt about whether fentanyl sched-
uling will even continue. 
I have received calls from families of 
people who have overdosed on fentanyl. 
I have received calls from law enforce-
ment seeking our help for them to en-
force the law. For the last 10 months, 
these families and these law enforce-
ment people have been in terror that 
this authority will disappear, that 
thousands then would die from the 
fentanyl overdoses. 
We have extended fentanyl sched-
uling five times in 4 years, but four 
have been in the last 10 months alone. 
While extensions preserve a lifesaving 
authority, this kind of legislation by 
extension is neither sustainable nor re-
flective of the great gravity of keeping 
fentanyl drugs in schedule I. A perma-
nently scheduled solution is the best 
answer; but, unfortunately, a perma-
nent scheduling action isn’t feasible 
right now. 
Now, why would that be the case? Be-
cause some members of Congress don’t 
support keeping fentanyl analogs in 
schedule I—or maybe at all. Some re-
ject our criminal drug laws altogether. 
That seems unbelievable, but that is 
what I sense from some of my col-
leagues. Fortunately, this is a fringe 
opinion and not very representative of 
the majority of Congress. Republicans 
and Democrats alike have voiced sup-
port 
for 
permanently 
scheduling 
fentanyl analogs, including even Presi-
dent Biden. But until Congress agrees 
on a bipartisan and a permanent solu-
tion, we must maintain the authority 
by extension. 
For years, I have been leading the 
fight to extend this authority in hopes 
of finding a permanent solution. I have 
urged Leader SCHUMER
to support 
measures that extend fentanyl sched-
uling as long as possible. I have asked 
President Biden to engage with bipar-
tisan congressional leaders on a perma-
nent solution. And I have requested 
that Chairman DURBIN hold a hearing 
on this issue in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. All these requests have obvi-
ously gone unanswered and ignored, or 
I wouldn’t be here today asking for 
unanimous consent. 
Scheduling fentanyl analogs matters. 
And why does it matter? It can save 
lives. Congress has the power. Congress 
has the responsibility to act. So we 
ought to do that in just a few minutes. 
But we can’t make meaningful bipar-
tisan change unless we have enough 
time to do it. 
So let’s pass a long-term extension 
and finally then lead the way to a per-
manent solution. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent request that the Senate proceed to 
the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 45, S. 1216; further, that the 
Grassley amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. BOOKER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I have 
to preface my remarks with my deep 
respect for the senior Senator from 
Iowa. I respect him not just because he 
slays it on Twitter, but I respect him 
because of his heart, because we have a 
great working relationship, and be-
cause we have worked together to deal 
with the drug crisis in America. We 
have worked together to make the ju-
dicial system more just. 
What you hear from the senior Sen-
ator is passion that comes from the cri-
sis, as he said. I have traveled his State 
considerably, and the opioid crisis is a 
crisis from New Jersey to Iowa—all 
over our country. He read the statis-
tics, but you could hear from his heart 
that these are families he knows; that 
these are people who have seen the tre-
mendous loss of young people through 
opioid overdoses. 
We cannot in this country tolerate 
one more overdose. I agree with the 
Senator’s sense of urgency in that we 
cannot tolerate one more death and 
that we have to address this public 
health crisis. But with this goal in 
mind, I cannot support the bill as it is 
offered today because extending the 
temporary 
scheduling 
of 
fentanyl 
analogs alone is a failed experiment. 
We have seen this temporary sched-
uling. We are in it right now. Classwide 
scheduling 
has 
not 
curbed 
the 
overdoses. In fact, overdoses have in-
creased during the period that fentanyl 
analogs have been scheduled by nearly 
40 percent from June 2019 to May 2020. 
Here is what makes it even worse. 
As a result of just blanket classwide 
scheduling—this 
broad 
sweep 
ap-
proach—the 
FDA 
recently 
testified 
that there is a potential lifesaving 
antidote to these fentanyl analogs. It 
is basically a stronger version of 
naloxone. That stronger version has 
been placed, because of this blanket 
scheduling, as a schedule I. The FDA 
knows that this could actually endan-
ger more people. 
Why in the midst of a public health 
crisis are we criminalizing the next 
naloxone instead of rushing it to the 
hands of researchers for study and 
evaluation? 
When you put something in schedule 
I, it is a declaration that doesn’t even 
have any health benefits. This is bad 
science and, therefore, bad policy. 
This bill, as it is now, would not pre-
vent the steady increase of fentanyl-re-
lated overdoses that we are seeing na-
tionwide. It wouldn’t achieve that be-
cause we have had temporary sched-
uling, and it is still going up. It will 
not prevent the loss of one loved one 
that we see happening right now or the 
pain that motivates my friend and sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
This is a public health crisis, and our 
strategies should be informed by the 
science as a public health response. It 
requires a response that is dictated by 
science- and evidence-based interven-
tions. Temporary scheduling, again, is 
not simply that. Classwide scheduling 
impedes scientists’ and impedes re-
searchers’ abilities to develop evi-
dence-based public health solutions 
that are needed to overcome the 
fentanyl crisis and deal with these 
fentanyl analogs. 
Look, right now, temporary sched-
uling has given this false impression 
that Congress is doing something to 
deal with fentanyl analogs while the 
death count goes up. What it has done, 
really, is allowed the government to 
neglect the deeper calling for us to 
really deal with the challenges as they 
are. There are a lot of evidence-based 
intervention 
strategies—things 
we 
know that work—that we are not in-
vesting in. There are things that could 
help these crises in our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S929 
March 2, 2022 
Fundamentally, research by the FDA 
has confirmed that what is being pro-
posed—classwide scheduling—has im-
properly scheduled substances with 
therapeutic promise and low abuse po-
tential. 
We 
need 
to 
submit 
all 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
to 
the 
same scientific evaluation that we 
have done for other controlled sub-
stances. We need to test for their dan-
gerousness. We must identify those 
that might be lifesaving overdoses. 
All we have done for nearly 4 years 
now is schedule these substances with-
out thinking about the scientific and 
medical evidence. Kicking the can 
down the road by temporarily sched-
uling these substances, yet again now, 
without making any effort to follow 
the scientific process, is irresponsible. 
We are preemptively criminalizing sub-
stances that may not be harmful and 
may actually be antidotes, that might 
be the answer in helping to curb these 
horrific overdoses and these horrible 
deaths. The temporary scheduling of 
fentanyl analogs without testing for 
pharmacological effects means that 
people will be convicted and incarcer-
ated for substances that may have no 
pharmacological effect. 
I want to again make clear that I am 
committed to ending this pandemic. I 
carry a picture in my wallet of some-
one who died from an overdose—it was 
given to me as I crisscrossed this coun-
try—so as to never forget the everyday 
emergency. 
As the President mentioned in his 
speech to this body yesterday, con-
fronting the opioid epidemic is some-
thing that Republicans and Democrats, 
united, can get behind. It should be bi-
partisan, but at the same time, our re-
sponse should not be guided by the 
same old drug war ideologies that 
didn’t stop the overuse of drugs. It 
should be guided by the scientific evi-
dence. It should be guided by compas-
sion. It should be guided by what 
works. 
Classwide scheduling ignores the sci-
entific and medical guidance. It sets in 
place a dangerous precedent, and it re-
peats mistakes we have made too many 
times in the past. 
I have seen the drug war go awry. I 
have seen this body act in ways that 
have compounded problems and not 
helped people. I have seen the people 
with addictions—that are diseases— 
with nothing but jail and prison. We 
can get out of this crisis if we follow 
the science and if we follow what 
works, but it means Democrats and Re-
publicans coming together. 
I have tremendous respect for my 
colleague. I know we can find a way to 
move forward together. I know, if we 
continue to work together, we are 
going to find a way forward. I know, 
because of my experience with the sen-
ior Senator and his grace, that if we 
dedicate ourselves to working together, 
we can get good things done for this 
country. We have done it before. In this 
case, I think we can do it again. 
So, with the deepest respect to my 
colleague, I respectfully object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to have just a short rebut-
tal. 
I thank my friend for his kind re-
marks about me as I know that he and 
I have worked together on a lot of 
pieces of legislation. 
I want to express my disappointment 
that my bill to extend fentanyl sched-
uling by 14 months cannot proceed at 
this point, but I won’t back down from 
trying to extend this authority in a 
meaningful and long-term way. 
There is more than one way to ad-
vance this bill. Today’s vote is just one 
of those ways. Like history shows us, 
this authority can be included in fund-
ing legislation or move as a bipartisan, 
unanimous bill. I will continue my ef-
forts for its inclusion in the upcoming 
omnibus appropriations bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Unless the Senator from New Jersey 
has something to say, I would like to 
proceed on another issue. 
Mr. BOOKER. The Senator may pro-
ceed. I have nothing else to say. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there 
are 192 nations on the face of this 
globe. Not one of those 192 nations, in-
cluding Ukraine, is a threat to Russia. 
Regardless, the Russian military is 
continuing to wage a full-scale war on 
the nation and the people of Ukraine. 
I am not sure of the reasons because 
I don’t know Putin. The highest I have 
been in the leadership of Russia was, 
once or twice in my life, when having a 
meeting with Mr. Lavrov, the Foreign 
Minister. I think, when it comes to 
Putin, he has got to satisfy his ego or 
he is sick or maybe both. 
The Ukrainian military and civilians 
are fighting for their homes. Obviously, 
they want to be an independent nation. 
They have our moral support and even 
some of our weapons, and they prob-
ably need a lot more help from the 
United States, short of putting troops 
in that country. I wish we had gotten 
them more defensive weapons before 
this invasion, but I still think there is 
more that we can do. 
I am an original cosponsor of the 
NYET bill. ‘‘Nyet’’ is the word for ‘‘no’’ 
in Russian. This legislation that goes 
by this acronym, the NYET Act, lit-
erally says no to Russian aggression, 
with 
tough, 
targeted 
support 
for 
Ukrainian resistance efforts, even if 
that turns into a guerilla war, and 
there are a number of other bills to 
crush the Putin regime. 
Russia, as we know, is a major oil 
and gas producer, so Putin’s actions 
are hurting not just Ukrainian and 
Russian citizens but Americans as well. 
Just think of the $1 or more increase in 
the price of gasoline we are paying 
today compared to 1 year ago. This sit-
uation comes at the same time Ameri-
cans across the country are already 
paying more for gas than at any time 
since 2014. That number comes from 
AAA data. 
Last night, I was encouraged to hear 
President Biden pledge to ‘‘use every 
tool at our disposal’’ to limit gas price 
hikes after he imposed sanctions on 
Russia. It is time for Congress and the 
White House to rethink policies that 
threaten our energy independence and, 
at the same time, our national secu-
rity. 
That is why already this week I have 
helped to introduce the American En-
ergy Independence Act with Senator 
HAWLEY, 
which 
would 
reverse 
the 
President’s shutdown of the energy sec-
tor and return it to full production so 
that we will have energy independence 
like we had until 12 months ago. 
Last night, the President talked 
about buying American products. Yet 
it seems like oil and natural gas—very 
major components of our economy— 
were excluded from his rhetoric. When 
it comes to oil, the United States im-
ports nearly 700,000 barrels of oil a day 
from Russia. That is why I introduced 
legislation 
yesterday 
with 
Senator 
MARSHALL that would ban purchases of 
Russian oil. 
I am also backing a new bill by Sen-
ator RUBIO to make American oil com-
panies sever ties with Russian state- 
owned oil and gas companies as many 
of these companies already have done. 
I support harsh sanctions that hit 
Putin where it really hurts him. In 
turn, you will affect the entirety of the 
Russian people, who are innocent of 
this dictator’s running of their coun-
try, all the harm he is causing them 
right now. But we ought to free the 
world from a Russian energy blackmail 
and keep gas affordable here at home 
with American-produced energy. 
Some of my colleagues are looking to 
lower prices at the gas pump by push-
ing for a gas tax freeze. That would be 
a very short-term, unsustainable move 
that would blow a hole in the highway 
trust fund. 
Instead, I hope colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle can work with the 
President to reverse decisions that 
have increased the price of domestic 
fuel production. 
You remember, on the first day in of-
fice, President Biden decided to shut 
down the Keystone Pipeline. President 
Biden should restart and expedite that 
pipeline. 
Also, in January 2021, President 
Biden issued an Executive order paus-
ing new oil and gas leases on public 
lands and Federal waters. 
In July 2021, the Interior Department 
halted all oil drilling on leased land 
within the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. 
Now, take all these actions. They sig-
nal to capital investors that the heavy 
hand of the Federal Government will 
work against fossil fuel investments at 
every turn. You know, you read about 
bank regulators all the time, discour-
aging banks from making loans to en-
ergy fossil fuels. This hostile regu-
latory environment has crippled in-
vestment in fossil fuels, which, in turn,

is the reason we have the high price of 
gasoline. 
Instead of more redtape, the Presi-
dent and Congress should work to cut 
regulations and Federal permitting 
that slow down, and has slowed down, 
domestic energy production. 
We were, as you know, energy inde-
pendent 12 months ago. Now, we are en-
ergy dependent. We have the President 
begging OPEC and Russia to ship us 
more oil. 
Policies that encourage investments 
in fossil fuel production will increase 
domestic production, and the result 
would be lower gas prices, just like we 
can look back at the last 12 months, 
and all the action that has been taken 
has driven up the price of gasoline. 
But instead of focusing on domestic 
energy independence last fall, as I have 
already referred to, President Biden in-
stead asked OPEC to pump more oil. 
The OPEC cartel, of course, did not 
honor that request. 
In 2000, when he was a Senator, now- 
President Biden acknowledged that 
anticompetitive behavior from OPEC 
harms American consumers and called 
on President Clinton to consider legal 
action against OPEC. OPEC is an orga-
nization which blatantly colludes to 
raise the price of oil. 
I have introduced the bipartisan bill 
entitled No Oil Producing and Export-
ing Cartels—it goes by the acronym 
NOPEC—which would allow the De-
partment of Justice to hold OPEC ac-
countable for its anticompetitive be-
haviors that artificially inflate global 
oil prices. I ask again for President 
Biden to publicly support the passage 
of NOPEC and work with Congress to 
pass this legislation into law. 
Besides focusing on fossil fuels, we 
know that ethanol makes up 10 percent 
of the gas sold in the United States. 
When oil prices are high, it gives high-
er blends of ethanol a clear competi-
tive advantage. 
Historically, gas prices gradually rise 
in the spring and peak late summer 
when people are driving more fre-
quently. But last fall, the Supreme 
Court rejected EPA’s regulation allow-
ing year-round E15 sales. Congress 
must move quickly to ensure that E15 
can be sold this summer. E15 is a clean-
er, higher-octane type of gasoline that 
contains more homegrown ethanol and 
less petroleum. 
Both biodiesel and ethanol are prov-
en domestic supplies of fuel that en-
hance our energy independence and, at 
the same time, lower greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Domestic biofuel producers are ready 
to step up and to give consumers lower 
gas prices that increase our national 
security and provide jobs in the heart-
land—good-paying jobs. 
Most Americans do not care where 
the oil was produced when they fill up 
their gas tanks. They just want to fill 
up their gas tanks without taking out 
a loan to do it. But when conflict oc-
curs in oil-producing regions around 
the world, Americans quickly realize 
the importance of your gas being a mix 
of West Texas crude and Iowa ethanol. 
In just over a year, we can see how 
the United States is losing energy inde-
pendence. Instead of focusing on do-
mestic fuel production, the President 
and his administration have caved to 
the most radical environmentalists in 
shaping our energy policy. It is time to 
reverse course. 
I am taking the President at his word 
when he said in the State of the Union 
Address last night that he wants to use 
every tool at his disposal to limit gas 
price hikes. So I have just given sev-
eral ways that we can use every tool 
that the President is talking about. 
And, of course, it is time to get to 
work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, 
I want to thank my colleague who just 
spoke about some really important 
issues. 
Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa talked 
about the fentanyl crisis that is facing 
our country. Unfortunately, this syn-
thetic opioid is now killing more and 
more Americans. We are back to record 
levels of overdose deaths, and probably 
two-thirds of them are caused by 
fentanyl. 
He is absolutely right. We need to be 
sure it is scheduled clearly as an illegal 
drug, as well as all the variants of it. 
STRENGTHENING AMERICAN CYBERSECURITY ACT 
OF 2022 
Mr. President, I am coming on the 
floor today to talk about another issue 
that is really important to our coun-
try, and that is protecting us from 
cyber attacks. 
Last night, I commend this body be-
cause the U.S. Senate passed legisla-
tion called the Strengthening Amer-
ican Cybersecurity Act of 2022. 
What does that mean? It means that 
we took the time to do our homework, 
had hearings, and reported out legisla-
tion that helps protect our government 
data, including personal data of Amer-
ican citizens, but also our national se-
curity data and other sensitive infor-
mation from cyber attacks. 
Also, we put in place provisions to 
help protect the private sector, par-
ticularly critical infrastructure. 
With what is going on right now 
around the world, particularly with re-
gard to Russia and Ukraine, it is in-
credibly important that we put up bet-
ter defenses here in this country, as 
well as helping Ukraine and other 
countries to fight against these cyber 
attacks. 
In recent years, we have seen this 
time and time again. I am sure you re-
member the Colonial Pipeline. Remem-
ber, they shut down gasoline distribu-
tion to the eastern part of the United 
States. These were cyber attacks. 
You probably heard of some of these 
other cyber attacks, like SolarWinds or 
ones where these criminal gangs de-
mand 
a 
ransom 
using 
so-called 
ransomware. This is happening increas-
ingly. 
Again, my concern is, particularly 
with what is going on today in our 
volatile and dangerous world, that it 
will continue to happen and even be-
come much more dangerous for us. 
The House of Representatives now 
has a chance to take up this legislation 
and pass it. They have been working 
with us on this all along on a bi-
cameral basis, the House and the Sen-
ate, Republican and Democrat. This 
hasn’t been a partisan issue. It has 
been one of these issues where we have 
worked together. 
Senator PETERS, who is the chair of 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
ment Affairs Committee—I am the 
ranking Republican, top Republican— 
we have worked together on this, but 
so did a lot of other members across 
the aisle. 
Senator RUBIO and Senator WARNER, 
Senator COLLINS, and others, they vi-
tally represent the Intelligence Com-
mittee, which also has a strong inter-
est in this. 
In my role as the ranking member on 
Homeland Security, we spend a lot of 
time focused on the oversight of this 
issue, how to respond to things like 
SolarWinds we talked about or Colo-
nial Pipeline or other cyber attacks. 
What we have found is that these cyber 
attacks are increasingly sophisticated 
and that our own government doesn’t 
have the tools they need, and that is 
why this legislation is so important. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an 
atrocity. It must not stand. But one of 
the things they have done in Ukraine 
for the last 8 years—and, really, before 
that as well, but particularly the last 8 
years, since 2014 when Ukraine decided 
to turn to the West, to turn to us—is 
Russia had done these cyber attacks 
relentlessly in Ukraine. And they are 
stepping them up right now, along with 
the horrible scenes we see of the bomb-
ings of innocent civilians in their 
apartment buildings. I saw today that 
not only have hospitals and childcare 
institutions been bombed but also the 
Holocaust memorial in Kyiv has been 
damaged. So what the Russians are 
doing is appalling, and the entire free-
dom-loving world needs to stand up to 
it, and we need to help Ukraine more. 
But one thing they have also done is 
they have launched these cyber attacks 
against the Ukrainian Government and 
against the private sector infrastruc-
ture in Ukraine. That, too, is a place 
where we can help. 
But, again, we need to be sure that 
we have our own house in order here to 
be able to be more helpful, to be able to 
provide the best practices, and to help 
Ukraine be able to deal with these at-
tacks, both kinetic attacks, these mili-
tary attacks, and also the cyber at-
tacks. 
Many times, the cyber attacks are 
also mixed with disinformation attacks 
because the Russians are flooding the 
zone 
and 
trying 
to 
take 
their 
disinformation 
and 
their 
lies 
and 
spread it around to the Ukrainian peo-
ple. By the way, not many people are

March 2, 2022 
believing it anymore because it is so 
outrageous. 
In China, we see another sophisti-
cated cyber adversary ramping up their 
rhetoric and their incursion into Tai-
wan’s air defense zone. All these 
threats make enacting this legislation 
we passed last night all the more im-
portant. 
Legislation has three complementary 
bills combined into one. First, it will 
protect our critical infrastructure bet-
ter from cyber attacks by increasing 
our visibility as a country into these 
cyber attacks and building the govern-
ment’s ability to warn potential vic-
tims and mount a nationwide defense 
and provide best practices to our crit-
ical infrastructure. 
It will strengthen the government’s 
own response and recovery capabilities, 
protecting sensitive data as well. And, 
finally, it will make government acqui-
sition and use of cloud services more 
secure, more accountable, more effi-
cient, and, significantly, keep coun-
tries like China and Russia from being 
able to access the cloud. 
All of these bills were passed out of 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
ment Affairs Committee with strong 
bipartisan 
support. 
And, 
again, 
it 
passed the Senate overwhelmingly last 
night. 
The first of these bills that I men-
tioned is called the Cyber Incident Re-
porting for Critical Infrastructure Act. 
Cyber attacks against U.S. critical in-
frastructure, whether by foreign gov-
ernments, like Russia and China, or 
criminal organizations, are, of course, 
a serious national security threat. 
Today, no one U.S. Government 
agency has visibility into all the cyber 
attacks occurring against critical in-
frastructure on a daily basis. We need 
that. We need to know what is going on 
to be able to warn other infrastructure 
and to be able to respond quickly. 
Right now, if Russia initiates a cyber 
campaign against U.S. critical infra-
structure, there would be nothing to 
ensure that the U.S. Government is no-
tified of that so it can mount a nation-
wide response and, again, warn other 
critical infrastructure operators simi-
larly situated. 
This bill would change that, enabling 
a coordinated, informed U.S. response 
to cyber attacks against the United 
States. 
The Cyber Incident Reporting Act 
will 
require 
critical 
infrastructure 
owners and operators to report sub-
stantial cyber attacks within 72 hours 
and ransomware payments within 24 
hours to what is called the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy. It is called CISA. 
CISA has done an effective job in the 
Trump administration, now in the 
Biden administration, but they need 
these tools to be able to do a better 
job. 
CISA having this information will be 
able to use the data to immediately 
contact the FBI and other appropriate 
law enforcement but also to help with 
best practices to mitigate the damage 
and to warn other critical infrastruc-
tures of threats, help these victims re-
cover, analyze trends, and enable a 
whole-of-the-nation defense and re-
sponse to these attacks. 
It is a cyber attack. It is not soldiers 
with guns, but it can have some of the 
same horrible impacts and damage to 
our economy and to individuals. Again, 
think of the oil pipeline, Colonial Pipe-
line, being basically shut off to the 
whole East Coast of the United States. 
The second bill that is part of this 
package is called the Federal Informa-
tion 
Cyber 
Security 
Modernization 
Act, or FISMA. 
FISMA is the acronym for the way in 
which we protect our Federal Agencies. 
And, unfortunately, we know that Fed-
eral Agencies—government Agencies— 
have 
failed 
to 
protect 
Americans’ 
data—our data, personal data. 
Last August, I released a report with 
Chairman PETERS detailing the signifi-
cant cyber security vulnerabilities of 
eight different key Federal Agencies— 
Homeland Security, State, Transpor-
tation, Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, Health and Human Services, Ag-
riculture, Education, and the Social 
Security Administration—the Social 
Security Administration where a lot of 
our sensitive information is kept. 
This report that we issued followed a 
report just a few years ago, in 2019, 
that I issued with Senator CARPER 
when I was chair of the Permanent 
Committee on Investigations, and we 
investigated all eight of these Agencies 
to determine how they were doing in 
terms of pushing back against cyber 
attacks. 
In last year’s report, only the De-
partment of Homeland Security had an 
effective cyber security program. No 
other Agency we reviewed met the 
standard. And we found that, govern-
mentwide, the average cyber security 
grade in pushing back against these 
cyber attacks was a C-minus—not the 
grade I would have wanted to take 
home to my parents. But that is the 
truth. We are just not prepared. 
The report identifies several common 
Agency vulnerabilities, including the 
failure to protect personally identifi-
able information. Again, think about 
some of these Agencies, HHS or Social 
Security. That is a big issue; second, 
maintain an accurate list of the Agen-
cies’ IT equipment so they know what 
they 
have; 
third, 
install 
security 
patches quickly; and, fourth, replace 
vulnerable and insecure legacy tech-
nology. A lot of these Agencies have 
technology that needs to be updated 
that is stovepiped—in other words, 
isn’t working well together and that 
makes it difficult to push back against 
these cyber attacks. 
In the 7 years since FISMA was last 
updated, Federal Agencies have had 
these same vulnerabilities year after 
year, putting America’s data at risk. 
So this legislation takes the important 
steps to remedy these systemic prob-
lems we identified. It incorporates rec-
ommendations from my bipartisan re-
ports with Senator PETERS and Senator 
CARPER and will adopt a risk-based ap-
proach to cyber security budgeting; po-
sition the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency—CISA, we 
talked about earlier—as the lead Agen-
cy in securing these Federal networks. 
There needs to be accountability, and 
that is missing now. 
We need to require Agencies to notify 
Americans whose personal identifiable 
information is compromised during a 
breach. To me, this is just a basic re-
quirement for government. If you have 
personal information that has been 
breached because the government sys-
tem has not been properly protected, 
you ought to be told about that so you 
can take your own steps to protect 
yourself. 
Complement the Cyber Reporting for 
Critical Infrastructure Act by ensuring 
that Federal Agencies and contractors 
also notify CISA when they suffer a 
breach. We talked about that earlier. 
But having that information is very 
helpful. 
And, finally, update the requirements 
for congressional notification when an 
Agency suffers a major cyber incident. 
We have an oversight responsibility 
here. We need to know if there has been 
a major cyber attack. 
Finally, this legislation includes a 
third 
part, 
which 
is 
called 
the 
FedRAMP Authorization Act. This is 
the one that will authorize the Federal 
Risk and Authorization Management 
Program that deals with cloud com-
puting 
and 
protecting 
the 
cloud. 
FedRAMP is a governmentwide pro-
gram administered by the General 
Services Administration that provides 
Agencies and cloud service providers 
with a standard approach to evalu-
ating, authorizing, and monitoring the 
security of cloud services. So when a 
Federal Government Agency wants to 
use the cloud services, they have to go 
through this process. 
In the first 4 years of FedRAMP, the 
program authorized only 20 cloud serv-
ice providers. Today, there are more 
than 230 cloud service providers—30 
percent of which are small businesses. 
This act builds on the successes of 
FedRAMP 
and 
Agencies’ 
continued 
push to adopt commercial cloud solu-
tions by addressing existing costs and 
processing times. 
But it also includes measures to 
strengthen the government’s response 
to foreign interference in our cloud 
systems. Supply chain security experts 
have warned us about the weaknesses 
in FedRAMP that leave our cloud sys-
tems vulnerable to interference from 
countries like Russia and China, North 
Korea, Iran. 
The reforms in this bill will allow for 
increased 
transparency 
and 
better 
monitoring of possible foreign influ-
ences in FedRAMP-approved systems. 
For example, it requires an Agency to 
review, on an interagency basis, gov-
ernment standards to identify and as-
sess the origin of software and code to

provide the transparency and account-
ability needed into the FedRAMP-ap-
proved systems that are developed and 
maintained by foreign engineers in 
countries like Russia and China. 
This bill also requires private-sector, 
third-party assessment organizations 
to disclose to GSA any information 
they have related to any foreign inter-
ests, any foreign influences, any for-
eign control, of course, or ownership, 
and to report a change in foreign own-
ership or control to GSA within 48 
hours. 
We have had instances like this 
where we are using cloud-based serv-
ices that then become bought by a for-
eign entity and that is not reported 
and therefore they continue to provide 
these services, which is something we 
need to stop. 
I commend the hard work of so many 
of my colleagues in crafting this broad-
er 
legislation, 
including 
Chairman 
PETERS, Chairman WARNER, Ranking 
Member RUBIO, Senator COLLINS of the 
Intelligence Committee, as well as so 
many other colleagues on the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee and the Intel Com-
mittee. 
I also want to thank our colleagues 
in the House, particularly Representa-
tives CLARKE and KATKO, because this 
has been a truly bicameral exercise, 
both in terms of the oversight and 
identifying what the problems are and 
coming up with appropriate legislation. 
And by the way, this legislation is 
strongly supported by those in the ad-
ministration who are responsible for 
dealing with cyber attacks. They need 
these tools, and they want these tools. 
We are not done yet because it has 
just passed the Senate. It has not 
passed the House. But we need to move 
quickly 
to 
enact 
these 
important 
changes to modernize our cyber secu-
rity posture. 
I urge the House to act quickly, to be 
sure we can protect ourselves from 
cyber attacks, particularly in this in-
creasingly dangerous environment. I 
would hope that we could send this 
critically important legislation to the 
President’s desk for signature very 
soon and be sure we are doing all we 
know to do to be able to better protect 
our country and our citizens in cyber 
attacks. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. President, we are also on the 
floor today talking about the postal re-
form legislation. I know we are going 
back and forth trying to determine 
how many amendments will be offered 
and which amendments are germane or 
relevant to the legislation or not. But 
let me just say that we already had a 
strong vote to move to this legislation. 
We had a vote of over 70 Members, 
which is rare around here—a strong bi-
partisan vote saying let’s move forward 
with this postal reform. And it is really 
important we do it because the post of-
fice is in deep trouble. And if we don’t 
act, it is going to get a lot worse. We 
are going to have big problems. 
In looking at this issue, again, in my 
oversight responsibilities on the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee, it looks like, in the 
next few years, the post office would 
probably go insolvent. And none of us 
wants that. When that happens, there 
would probably be a big government 
bailout. 
So this legislation, along with inter-
nal reforms that the post office is mak-
ing themselves—and I commend them 
for that—is intended to avoid that 
problem. It is intended to ensure that 
we can get this under control before 
there is an insolvency. 
Right now, the post office is pro-
jecting a 10-year loss of $160 billion if 
we just continue with the status quo. 
The reality is, the post office is in a 
tough business situation. Think about 
it. How many first-class letters have 
you sent recently? And how many did 
you send 5 years ago or 10 years ago? 
Probably more. Increasingly, we are re-
lying on sending things by email and 
not sending them by first-class mail. 
That changes the post office’s business 
model. 
They are also delivering to more and 
more 
addresses 
because 
everybody 
wants to be connected to the post of-
fice to receive packages, to receive 
other kinds of mail—advertising, news-
papers, bills. People who are reliant on 
getting their prescriptions through the 
mail are very eager to see the post of-
fice be strong and, of course, be a post 
office that addresses their universal 
service requirement—in other words, 
goes to every single mailbox around 
America. 
So the math doesn’t work very well 
when you have more and more address-
es and not as much first-class mail to 
be sent out. That is one reason that the 
post office is in trouble. And we need to 
address that new reality. 
The current Postmaster General, by 
the way, whose name is Louis DeJoy, 
came and talked to some of us yester-
day about this and talked about an am-
bitious plan that he has embarked on 
along with the support of the postal 
Board of Governors and the support of 
the previous administration and this 
administration to ensure that we can 
transform the post office by finding ef-
ficiencies, including transforming ex-
isting capabilities to make sure they 
more efficiently meet the needs of the 
American people. 
He has a 10-year plan that makes 
changes to make the post office more 
efficient, but it also continues to have 
this universal service obligation where 
everybody is going to be getting their 
mail. In fact, under our legislation, 
there is also a 6-day-per-week mail de-
livery requirement. So it is not just 
that everybody’s post office box or 
mailbox or door is being serviced by 
the post office but that it is done 6 
days a week. 
But he needs help to do that. In par-
ticular, he has made it very clear to us 
that he needs the financial space to be 
able to put these reforms in place to be 
able to take away some of the huge li-
abilities that they currently face at 
the post office. That is what we do in 
this legislation. 
First, we eliminate a burdensome 
prefunding 
requirement 
for 
retiree 
health benefits. This has really been a 
problem for the post office. It has made 
their lives much more difficult. We 
mandated this in Congress back in 2006 
for current employees. This has crip-
pled the post office financially. 
You 
should 
know, 
by 
the 
way, 
prefunding of healthcare retiree bene-
fits is something the Federal Govern-
ment does not do. So other Agencies 
and Departments don’t have to do that. 
It is also not something the private 
sector does. So it is something that the 
post office uniquely has had to deal 
with, and, again, it has been a financial 
burden for them that has really made 
their financial statements extremely 
difficult. 
Second, we require post office em-
ployees who are retiring, who have 
been paying into Medicare their entire 
career, by the way, to join up with Part 
B and Part D of Medicare—in other 
words, to go into Medicare, and instead 
of having the Federal employee health 
benefit plan be their plan, to have that 
be the backup and have Medicare be 
their primary payer. 
Everybody is in Part A, by the way, 
already—Medicare Part A. But some 
Postal Service employees are not en-
rolled in Parts B and D. 
Now, about 75 percent are enrolled in 
entire Medicare but, again, about 25 
percent are not. So that saves money 
for the post office because Medicare is 
not as generous a program, frankly, as 
Federal employee health benefit plans 
or the new Postal Service Federal 
health benefit plan. 
Third, we require the Postal Service 
to maintain its current standard of 
this 6-day-a-week delivery we talked 
about through an integrated delivery 
system of mail and packages. That 
simply says that the status quo ought 
to continue so that you are delivering 
packages and letters at the same time, 
not separately. That would be incred-
ibly inefficient, to say, OK, you are 
going to have a separate system for 
packages and a separate system for let-
ters. 
In addition to doing all these things, 
the Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that the bill is going to save 
money. It is going to save $1.5 billion a 
year to the American taxpayer. 
I would also like to note what the 
bill does not do because there has been 
some information out there, including 
one editorial I saw recently. One, it 
doesn’t appropriate any new funds to 
the U.S. Post Office. 
Two, it does not change the account-
ing or cost structure for packages and 
letters. So it does not disadvantage pri-
vate-sector carriers. It is the status 
quo. And that is very important to me. 
Third, it does not impact the sol-
vency of the Medicare hospital trust 
fund. That is the Part A trust that is

going broke in a short number of years. 
And that is the big focus of a lot of us: 
make sure that doesn’t happen. It does 
not affect Part A trust fund at all. 
It also does not increase the Medi-
care Part B or Part D premiums. And 
that is important, I think, to a lot of 
us. 
And, finally, it does not allow the 
post office to enter into new commer-
cial services like postal banking, which 
I believe would be a big mistake. 
The legislation received strong bipar-
tisan support when it was taken up in 
the House of Representatives a couple 
of weeks ago. It passed by a vote of 342 
to 92. Not much gets passed in terms of 
major legislation along those lines. 
And I am proud of the people who 
worked hard on this on both sides of 
the aisle and both sides of the Capitol 
to come up with a bipartisan bill. It is 
not the bill any one of us would have 
written, but it is the right bill to save 
the post office. 
I think Republicans and Democrats 
alike in the House looked at this and 
said: We have to do something here. We 
do not want the post office to go belly- 
up. 
Some say that this is a whole lot bet-
ter than the alternative. I agree with 
that. I think that is one of the reasons 
we need to pass this. It does get the 
Postal Service back on track; again, 
with reforms being undertaken inter-
nally at the post office itself—that 
combination of what we are doing here 
to provide them some financial space 
to be able to make the reforms and the 
reforms that they are doing. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this legislation. Let’s put 
the Postal Service in a position to suc-
ceed, to continue to provide these es-
sential services. Small businesses and 
our veterans with regard to their 
healthcare, prescriptions being deliv-
ered, and our rural constituents abso-
lutely need the post office to be there 
to service them. They rely on this. 
That is why so many, again, of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle 
strongly support this legislation. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator PETERS for working with us over 
time to find consensus on this bill. 
Let’s pass it and ensure that the Postal 
Service—the post office—remains via-
ble for years and years ahead. Nothing 
is more important to my rural con-
stituents, who talked to me about this 
quite a bit, than ensuring that the post 
office stays healthy. It is really impor-
tant to, again, some of the veterans I 
represent who get their needed medica-
tion through the mail. 
It is important to our voting system 
in this country because a lot of voting 
is by mail, including in Ohio, where for 
many years we had absentee voting 
that is no-fault absentee. We rely on 
our post office to ensure our ballots get 
delivered on time. 
This is an opportunity on a bipar-
tisan basis to ensure the post office re-
mains strong. I hope we take advan-
tage of it and pass this legislation and 
have appropriate amendments in the 
meantime and get this done in short 
order. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Indiana. 
S.J. RES. 32 
Mr. BRAUN. I am here today to talk 
about vaccine mandates. Of course, I 
led the effort on the vaccine mandate 
that was preposterous when our admin-
istration said ‘‘Either take a vaccine or 
lose your job,’’ impacting down to 100 
employees. 
Thank goodness the Supreme Court 
weighed in, citing that Congressional 
Review Act as one of the reasons it did 
it, taking that cue from here in Con-
gress. But there still are mandates re-
maining, and it has to do with the 
Biden administration’s pandemic poli-
cies that have just gone too far, and 
millions of workers are dealing with 
the consequences. 
You cannot make these arbitrary de-
cisions, especially when it was clear we 
were coming to some type of resolu-
tion, some type of different dynamic 
with the COVID saga, and then drop 
these kinds of mandates upon any enti-
ty at the worst possible time. 
In this case, we are talking about the 
CMS vaccine mandate on healthcare 
workers—10 million of them affected. 
The very same frontline workers who 
have been heroes and served their fel-
low Americans during the pandemic 
were given a choice: your careers or a 
vaccine. 
With all of the logic that went into 
the Supreme Court’s ruling on employ-
ers with employees down to 100, it 
should apply to healthcare entities as 
well. 
It is no surprise that you see 
healthcare workers leaving at the high-
est rate—leaving their profession—in 
over 20 years. It is worse in rural areas, 
like the State of Indiana, and that 
compounds other problems that rural 
places are contending with. 
It also fails to acknowledge evidence- 
based science that clearly tells us stuff 
now that we didn’t know before, like 
natural infection has a much better de-
fense against COVID and it has more 
durability. 
Common sense doesn’t make any dif-
ference, and now we have got this. He 
has robbed these healthcare workers of 
the freedom to make their own choices 
and added to the challenges patients 
have had to access the healthcare sys-
tem. Today, the Senate can overturn 
this mandate—another example of gov-
ernment in overdrive, getting into indi-
vidual decisions it was never intended 
to. 
I urge my colleagues to correct this 
later today, and let’s base this on 
science, not political science, which 
seems to drive so many of the decisions 
here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to use a stetho-
scope as a prop during my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
last year, I put my sport coats and ties 
away and broke out some scrubs, found 
my stethoscope and a lab coat, and 
went to work fighting COVID on the 
frontlines of hospitals and community 
centers in Wyandotte County, KS, and 
Seward County, KS. 
This is a picture of some of the he-
roes I worked with. I think what is im-
portant to note is this is a time when 
none of us knew how bad this virus 
was. It reminded me, as a medical stu-
dent, working on HIV patients. Myself 
geared up from head to toe with pa-
tient protective equipment, personal 
protective 
equipment, 
nurses, 
res-
piratory therapists, radiology techs— 
all of us not knowing how bad this 
virus was and how easily it could 
spread. 
Today, these heroes are being pun-
ished. These heroes came to work every 
day covered from head to toe in per-
sonal protective equipment, with each 
one knowing that they could contract 
COVID–19 from any one of their pa-
tients at any given time. 
This particular setting, an ICU—an 
ICU with 8 beds and 13 patients. 
Despite the risk to them, to their 
families—think 
about 
that. 
Think 
about having children at home or a 
spouse, that you were not only risking 
your own life but the fear of taking 
this virus home with you. But they 
threw themselves into the fire, so to 
speak, all in the effort to save Kansans 
from a pandemic that was raging 
across our communities. 
In the earliest months of this pan-
demic and still to this day, our 
healthcare heroes have displayed sac-
rifice and dedication to the American 
people. It is a reminder to all of us how 
essential these people are in ensuring 
the safety of our communities. 
They weren’t left unscathed. Between 
burnout and suicide, the pandemic 
took a heavy toll on their physical and 
mental health—doctors, nurses, all the 
supporting staffs in these hospitals, in 
the nursing homes, in the emergency 
rooms. 
The resulting exodus of fatigued and 
demoralized doctors and nurses and 
other frontline workers is exacerbating 
a labor shortage which already existed 
across rural Kansas and across rural 
America long, long before the pan-
demic occurred. 
Since February of 2020, roughly one 
in five healthcare workers has quit 
their job—one in five—according to a 
poll published late last year. In Sep-
tember, the American Nurses Associa-
tion sent a letter to HHS Secretary 
Becerra urging the Agency to declare 
the nursing shortage a national crisis 
and to take immediate action to con-
front the issue. 
I can tell you, I don’t talk to any 
doctor back home, any hospital admin-
istrator, who is not going to grab me 
and say: We have got a huge nursing 
shortage. You have to do something 
about it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S934 
March 2, 2022 
The nursing homes, the rehab centers 
are all suffering huge, huge nursing 
shortages. The nursing colleges are 
now having a huge shortage of teach-
ers. Nearly a third of the country’s 
15,000 nursing homes reported a short-
age of nurses or aides. Hospitals have 
been forced to recruit foreign nurses, 
and National Guardsmen have had to 
fill in as nursing assistants to ease 
these problems. These shortages are 
particularly impactful in rural areas 
like my home State of Kansas. 
The Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services acknowledges there are 
currently ‘‘endemic staff shortages for 
all categories of employees at almost 
all kinds of healthcare providers and 
suppliers.’’ Despite this acknowledge-
ment, President Biden and his public 
health officials went forward with this 
vaccine mandate, knowing it could and 
would lead to more firings—firings like 
those we saw in New York, where 33,000 
healthcare workers were fired—33,000. 
They were fired, retired, or placed on 
unpaid leave because they chose not to 
abide by the State’s mandatory inocu-
lation policy. 
Labor shortages at healthcare facili-
ties will impede access for the elderly 
and the poor—those who are supposed 
to be cared for under Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
In addition to the impact this would 
have on the healthcare workforce, this 
mandate puts additional burdens on 
hospitals and State surveyors. The rule 
requires covered entities to comply 
with redtape by requiring them to de-
velop and implement policies to ensure 
compliance with the mandate, mean-
while taking nurses away from that 
contact with the patients who need the 
attention. 
CMS estimated that the cost of this 
mandate 
on 
private-sector 
entities 
would exceed $158 million. Follow-on 
guidance issued by CMS recently also 
required State surveyors to enforce the 
Federal Government’s vaccine mandate 
by verifying compliance at healthcare 
facilities. This will take away, again, 
limited resources at the State level 
and prevent them from fulfilling their 
traditional surveying and certification 
duties, not to mention multiple States 
have laws on their books prohibiting 
vaccination as a condition of employ-
ment for State agencies. 
As a physician, I am confident that 
the vaccine has saved lives, and I am so 
grateful for the vaccines. However, 
whether to receive it or not is a per-
sonal choice between individuals and 
their doctor, not mandated via uncon-
stitutional Executive actions. I still 
believe in the sanctity of the patient- 
physician relationship. 
Make no mistake, this Federal vac-
cine mandate is not about public 
health or science and fails to account 
for changes in data and the cir-
cumstances of the virus. If it were, we 
would recognize natural immunity as a 
highly effective way to combat the 
virus. Mountains of evidence show that 
those who achieved immunity through 
natural infection—many of them being 
on our frontline, those healthcare he-
roes from yesterday—are highly pro-
tected against reinfection. 
The mandate was also crafted when 
the Delta variant was the dominant 
strain in the United States. Omicron is 
now the dominant strain. It is much 
milder and has a 91-percent lower risk 
of death than Delta. 
Additionally, research shows the tra-
ditional COVID vaccine dosing regimen 
provides 
little 
protection 
against 
transmission of the Omicron variant, 
basically said that natural immunity is 
at least as good if not better than vac-
cination from the original vaccines. 
As noted by Dr. Fauci, ‘‘Omicron, 
with its extraordinary, unprecedented 
degree of . . . transmissibility, will ul-
timately find just about everybody,’’ 
and even those who have received the 
initial vaccine and subsequent booster 
‘‘will still get infected.’’ And we saw 
that play out, right? We all saw that 
play out. Many, many people who had 
gotten the vaccine ended up with the 
Omicron virus, and certainly we also 
found out that natural immunity was 
much better than the original vaccines 
against Omicron. 
Most absurdly, in late January, the 
CDC 
issued 
guidance 
that 
allows 
COVID-positive healthcare workers to 
return to work. Let me say that again. 
The hypocrisy. The CDC issued guid-
ance 
that 
allows 
COVID-positive 
healthcare workers to return to work 
even if they are still testing positive. 
How many people in America would 
want 
a 
COVID-positive 
respiratory 
therapist intubating their loved one in 
an ICU? 
These examples just show how flawed 
the science is behind the CMS vaccine 
mandate. As previously stated, that is 
because this vaccine mandate is not 
about public health or science. The 
Biden 
administration’s 
mandate 
is 
about fulfilling their desire to control 
every aspect of our lives, and it is a 
slap in the face to the hard-working 
men and women who never took a day 
off in the frontline fight of the COVID– 
19 battle. 
These are real people with real fami-
lies. They are working to feed their 
families, and they have mortgages to 
pay. And these are smart people. These 
are well-educated people—people who 
thoughtfully considered the vaccine 
and then decided it was not best for 
them. These were my medical school 
classmates, 
successful 
physicians 
working at medical centers, experts in 
their fields who had looked at the data 
and had deeply either religious reasons 
or scientific reasons for not taking the 
vaccine. 
Each day, we hear from Kansans 
faced with the difficult decision of tak-
ing the jab or losing their job. We even 
surveyed dozens of healthcare pro-
viders across the State who are already 
citing shortages and other staffing 
issues due to the mandate. In fact, 87 
percent of the surveyed oppose the 
mandate or cited numerous concerns 
with it. 
These jobs can’t be replaced over-
night, and with the March 15 deadline 
for nearly all healthcare workers who 
haven’t received two doses looming, 
what we are about to witness is a gov-
ernment-induced labor shortage and, in 
turn, a health crisis we can’t afford. 
That health crisis will affect every 
American, whether you are waiting for 
your elective hip to be replaced or you 
are waiting to get your loved one 
moved from a hospital setting into 
some type of a nursing home or as-
sisted living facility. You all, every 
one of us, will be impacted. 
One respondent put it best when he 
told us this: 
[W]e are concerned that the execution [of 
the mandate] will exacerbate an already dire 
workforce crisis in long term care. A hard 
deadline with no resources for providers or 
glide path for unvaccinated workers is likely 
to push too many out the door and ulti-
mately, threaten residents’ access to long 
term care. 
Now, I know some here will say that 
the Supreme Court ruled to uphold this 
mandate earlier this year and this is 
settled, but that is not the full story 
here. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
opinion 
which lifted the stay on the rule fo-
cused primarily on the Secretary of 
HHS’s statutory authority to impose 
conditions upon healthcare facilities 
participating in Medicare and Med-
icaid. This does not mean it is a good 
rule or it is a beneficial condition to 
have placed on those facilities given 
everything I have laid out here today. 
In fact, it is a hardship to those facili-
ties, and it is a hardship for the fami-
lies of the loved ones who are in those 
facilities. 
This fight against a harmful rule 
continues here on the Senate floor, and 
I am going to keep fighting along with 
all those throughout this Nation’s Fed-
eral judicial system. 
Quick update. Sixteen States have 
joined together in a new filing last 
month to once again block the Federal 
Government from enforcing the man-
date in their respective States. Sixteen 
States think the CMS has got this 
wrong. They think the White House has 
got this wrong. Additionally, the attor-
ney general in my home State of Kan-
sas, Derek Schmidt, is leading the 
fight. He, along with nine other attor-
neys general, has asked a separate Fed-
eral court to reopen litigation. 
No, we are not even close to stopping 
this fight. 
It has been an incredibly tough time 
these past couple of years. We have lost 
over 950,000 Americans to COVID–19. 
We have seen mental health issues sky-
rocket, suicides on the rise, and sub-
stance abuse increase. 
But if there is one thing that is for 
sure, though, it is that Americans will 
keep fighting to get through this. 
Frontline workers in hospitals, doc-
tors’ offices, community health cen-
ters, and beyond will fight even harder; 
that is if we remove the burden of the 
vaccine mandate and our healthcare 
heroes aren’t forced to leave their jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S935 
March 2, 2022 
Just this week, England terminated 
their COVID vaccination requirement 
for all health and social services. We 
must do the same. I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution of dis-
approval 
to 
invalidate 
President 
Biden’s overreaching and harmful vac-
cine mandate for our healthcare work-
ers. This is a major element of the gov-
ernment’s overreaching COVID–19 re-
sponse that must begin to be scaled 
back. Not only is it coercive and un-
constitutional, the mandate does not 
take into account the fact that natural 
immunity is as effective as the vac-
cines and that vaccines do not prevent 
transmission of the Omicron variant. 
Additionally, we all know—we all see 
it—we have a massive labor shortage in 
our healthcare industry and must do 
everything in our power to fight for 
Americans who ran to the sound of the 
battle, for these are the true heroes of 
the pandemic and deserve our best 
fight and utmost respect. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as you 
saw at the State of the Union Address 
last night, a number of pandemic re-
strictions in Congress have seemingly 
ended, thanks to the CDC’s convenient 
decision to update its guidance on 
mask wearing and social distancing 
earlier this week. 
Some Democratic politicians in the 
room were cheering, chanting, embrac-
ing, and crowding. Though many of 
them continue to publicly condemn 
those who have chosen not to wear 
masks or socially distance, they were 
maskless and were not distanced them-
selves. So why the immediate change? 
Well, perhaps it is because they simply 
could not waste the political oppor-
tunity for partisan theater with which 
they could raise the curtain on their 
Big Government aspirational new nor-
mal. 
Sure, President Biden can attempt to 
hide behind CDC guidance, the very 
same CDC guidance that crafted a com-
plex system to provisionally grant 
Americans permission to live as free 
citizens, but he fell into a perpetual 
pitfall of the left. He forgot that Amer-
icans are a lot smarter, perhaps, than 
he thinks they are. 
Americans can see through the trans-
parent political theater and the con-
structive convenient timing. They see 
the hypocrisy. They know that the 
only science that has changed is the 
political science. They saw the power-
ful elite gather to praise their own 
playacted benevolence, foresight, and 
leadership, all while countless Ameri-
cans who are suffering from the real 
failures of President Biden and his 
party are losing their jobs because of 
draconian Federal vaccine mandates. 
What a sorry state of affairs and 
what a sad set of conditions. 
Americans see and feel the hypocrisy. 
The people of Utah and the United 
States do not want the false freedom 
pushed by a political class that refuses 
to relinquish control over citizens’ 
lives. They want real freedom, the kind 
promised by the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and protected by the Con-
stitution. They want to be able to live 
their lives, raise their families, and 
make their own medical decisions 
without a ‘‘Mother, may I’’ from Presi-
dent Biden or the vast throngs of 
nameless, faceless, unelected, unac-
countable Federal bureaucrats. 
They want to be able to provide for 
their families without the threat of 
being fired if they don’t submit to a 
medical procedure that they don’t 
want. 
I am honored to join my friend and 
colleague, 
Senator 
MARSHALL, 
in 
standing for American workers. Today, 
we stand for the millions of healthcare 
workers that were some of the heroes 
of this pandemic. They came to work 
and cared for the sick before vaccines 
were even available. They should not 
be forced to submit to a procedure or 
risk their livelihoods. 
This isn’t our first effort to end these 
Federal mandates. I have tried dozens 
of bills dozens of times to end this dra-
conian overreach. I am proud to con-
tinue this fight. 
We will not stop until freedom is re-
stored. We will not stop until American 
moms and dads can provide for their 
families without kowtowing to Presi-
dent Biden’s vaccine mandates and 
without submitting to Presidential 
medical orthodoxy in this or any fu-
ture administration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 15 minutes, followed by 
Senator MARSHALL for up to 1 minute, 
prior to the scheduled rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as 
my colleague from Utah just noted a 
minute ago, he has been asking for 
votes on this matter repeatedly. And 
today, he and others seek to invalidate 
a regulation issued by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services that 
require most healthcare providers to be 
vaccinated. 
And suffice it to say, this is some-
thing that the Supreme Court has 
ruled on. The Supreme Court has actu-
ally taken this up and agrees with our 
position that, in effect, this is an area 
where there is a strong public interest. 
And I believe what my colleague is pro-
posing is just far outside the main-
stream of opinion regarding vaccina-
tions in America. There simply is a 
point where an anti-mandate agenda 
becomes 
a 
dangerous 
anti-vaccine 
agenda, and my colleagues on the other 
side, in my view, have crossed that line 
quite some time ago. 
So I am just going to take a few min-
utes to describe why I think this is 
such an extreme position outside what 
the vast majority of Americans agree 
and in contrast to what the Supreme 
Court has said. 
Americans support a vaccine provi-
sion or requirement for healthcare 
workers by a 20- or 30-point margin—no 
surprise about that. Everybody is con-
cerned about sitting in a room with a 
doctor or nurse who may be contagious 
and who has been unvaccinated. I want 
to particularly emphasize the people 
affected here who are the most vulner-
able based on what we have seen during 
the pandemic. We are talking about 
those with chronic illness and seniors. 
Three-quarters of the Americans who 
died of COVID–19 were seniors, and 
200,000 of those COVID deaths were 
Americans living or working in long- 
term care facilities like nursing homes. 
Many others were in and out of hos-
pitals and doctors’ offices routinely. 
Making sure that healthcare workers 
are vaccinated, colleagues, I don’t 
think is about any partisan position. It 
is about a commonsense policy de-
signed to keep seniors—people I have 
worked with for 7 years; before I came 
to the Congress, I was director of the 
Gray Panthers—I think we all believe 
we want vulnerable people to be safe. 
So I am going to start by quoting a rul-
ing by the Roberts Court—hardly, at 
this point, colleagues, some kind of 
radical left judiciary. Recently, they 
allowed the vaccine requirement for 
healthcare workers to go forward, and 
I am just going to quote: 
Ensuring that providers take steps to 
avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to 
their patients is consistent with the funda-
mental principle of the medical profession: 
First, do no harm. It would be the very oppo-
site of efficient and effective administration 
for a facility that is supposed to make people 
well to make them sick with COVID–19. 
This vaccine provision or require-
ment is about keeping our healthcare 
workforce safe. Doctors and nurses in 
our country are overwhelmed. That is 
what they just told me as I went about 
my State, going to hospitals and vac-
cination sites and other healthcare 
programs. 
These providers have been working 
nonstop for years under extraordinary 
stress, and what they are all about is 
honoring that Hippocratic Oath and 
trying to save lives. At times in this 
pandemic, our hospitals have been jam-
packed with COVID patients. If lots of 
doctors and nurses are out sick during 
a big COVID wave, that has got an im-
pact on the standard of care for every-
body. It drops for COVID patients, for 
stroke patients, for people hurt in car 
accidents. 
Our 
country 
desperately 
needs to protect our healthcare work-
force. 
Now, right at the heart of my col-
leagues’ case—and as my friend from 
Utah said, we have had a number of de-
bates 
about 
this 
subject—my 
col-
leagues say every person is unique, and 
there needs to be flexibility when it 
comes to vaccines. Colleagues, I am 
just fine with that. The fact is, the ad-
ministration is allowing for medical 
and religious exemptions. Flexibility is 
written into the rule because that is 
just plain old common sense.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S936 
March 2, 2022 
Vaccine requirements aren’t any-
thing new for healthcare workers. Flu 
shot requirements have been common 
for a long time. When you go into 
healthcare, it is understood that a vac-
cine requirement can be part of the job. 
Furthermore, the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services has already 
pushed 
back 
the 
deadline 
for 
healthcare workers in several States to 
have their first vaccine dose. Origi-
nally, the deadline was in December. 
Now, it is February. The idea that this 
is somehow an inflexible and unreason-
able mandate coming from nowhere is 
just plain wrong. 
I would just close by way of saying it 
is time for us to move past these bat-
tles that I think regrettably continue 
to make this pandemic—which strikes 
me as having nothing to do with poli-
tics—such political hutzpah. 
It is good news that the Omicron 
wave is receding. With any luck, that 
will be the last major COVID wave that 
threatens to overwhelm our healthcare 
system. We all want our lives to get 
back to normal, and the way to do that 
is with smart public health policies— 
and smart public health policies, we 
know, consistently get broad support 
from the American people. That is 
what the vaccine provision require-
ment for healthcare workers is all 
about. That is why the Supreme Court 
upheld it. 
I would urge that we oppose this 
joint resolution and do everything we 
can to make sure that healthcare 
workers are going to be vaccinated. 
And as I said to my constituents when 
I was home this weekend, what I want-
ed to make sure was that everybody 
who could, get vaccinated as quickly as 
possible. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
appreciate the comments of my col-
league from the great State of Oregon, 
but his arguments all rely upon one as-
sumption, and that is that the vaccine 
works to prevent transmission. 
But the vaccines don’t work to pre-
vent transmission. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling was not 
a ruling on merit. The Medicare and 
Medicaid vaccine mandate will impact 
every family, every person across this 
great Nation. We already have a dire 
shortage of doctors, nurses, ultrasound 
techs, custodians, housekeepers, kitch-
en staff in all these hospitals and nurs-
ing homes. This mandate will result in 
more staffing shortages and firings. 
The science behind this mandate is 
quite outdated. Natural immunity is 
stronger 
than 
immunity 
achieved 
through vaccination at this point in 
time. 
Last night, during the State of the 
Union Address, President Biden said: 
Let’s stop looking at the COVID–19 as a 
partisan dividing line. 
Let’s take him at his word. Let’s 
make our actions be consistent with 
his words. Let’s repeal this divisive 
mandate today. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
our resolution. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3731 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the 
world is in chaos everywhere you turn. 
In the last week, Vladimir Putin has 
launched an unprovoked, naked war of 
aggression 
against 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine. The reason he did this is be-
cause of his imperial ambitions to re-
incorporate Ukraine into the greater 
Russian Empire in his mind but also 
because he perceived weakness and op-
portunity in the West and, regrettably, 
from President Biden. 
We saw last night the President con-
gratulated himself on the diplomatic 
coalition he has put together to con-
front Vladimir Putin. That is akin to 
Neville Chamberlain celebrating the 
coalition he assembled against Ger-
many after Germany invaded Poland. 
The whole point was to deter Vladimir 
Putin. That failed. Why did that fail? 
Because for the last year, the President 
has projected weakness and signaled to 
Vladimir Putin that he didn’t have the 
nerve to counteract his ambitions. His 
first action in office was to give Vladi-
mir Putin his No. 1 foreign priority—a 
no-strings-attached extension of a one- 
sided nuclear arms control treaty. 
Shortly after that, he gave Vladimir 
Putin his second foreign priority. He 
waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 
gas pipeline. We didn’t really take 
stern measures for the Colonial Pipe-
line hack from Russian-affiliated hack-
ers. We rewarded Vladimir Putin with 
a high-stakes summit last summer. 
But it is not just foreign policy; it is 
also domestic policy here at home. As 
day follows night, Vladimir Putin gets 
emboldened and more aggressive when 
the price of oil is higher. For the last 
year, the Biden administration has 
done everything they can to stifle the 
production of American oil and gas 
that would not only keep the price of 
gasoline lower for our citizens, keep 
the price of heating their homes lower, 
it would also constrain Vladimir Putin 
by reducing the revenues he has for his 
war machine. 
But the Biden administration’s war 
on oil and gas has, in fact, emboldened 
him, so much so that we are to this day 
still importing hundreds of thousands 
of barrels of Russian oil and petroleum 
products every day. 
Since Vladimir Putin launched his 
naked war of aggression last week, we 
have filled his coffers with millions and 
millions of American dollars to fund 
his aggression against the Ukrainian 
people. We still haven’t taken the steps 
necessary to stop this—sanctions on 
Russian oil and gas to cut off those 
revenues, to bankrupt Vladimir Putin’s 
war machine, but also to continue the 
pressure that those sanctions impose,

to begin to once again pump more oil 
and gas here at home. 
If we really wanted to add the pres-
sure to Vladimir Putin that oil and gas 
sanctions would put on him, we would 
unleash a flood of American oil and gas 
into the market and deprive Vladimir 
Putin of those revenues. But, instead, 
on the very day—literally the very 
day—last week when Vladimir Putin 
invaded Ukraine, President Biden halt-
ed all new oil and gas leases on Federal 
lands. Think about that. A ruthless 
dictator invades an innocent nation of 
45 million souls, using oil and gas as a 
weapon against the West, which could 
come to the aid of that nation, and 
President Biden’s action on that day 
was to halt all new oil and gas leases 
on Federal lands. 
To the extent the President even 
talked about energy in his speech last 
night, 
he 
simply 
made 
pipedream 
promises 
about 
green energy that 
maybe will come true in a decade or 
two but will do nothing at the moment 
to deter Vladimir Putin and, in fact, 
will continue to embolden him by high-
lighting a lack of seriousness to con-
front and undermine his aggression. 
In fact, the President only mentioned 
oil once last night in that entire speech 
when he bragged about releasing 30 
million barrels of oil from the Stra-
tegic 
Petroleum 
Reserve, 
which 
wouldn’t fuel our country for even 2 
days. 
What we need is not half measures; 
we need a sustained, reliable, and af-
fordable flow of American energy. That 
is why I am here to ask for unanimous 
consent for my bill ordering the Biden 
administration to start issuing new oil 
and gas leases for Federal lands. 
It won’t solve all of our problems, 
but it is an important and immediate 
step that we can take to start pro-
ducing the American oil and gas that 
will undercut Vladimir Putin’s war ma-
chine. 
President Biden’s foolish energy pol-
icy couldn’t have come at a worse time 
for Ukraine, but we can begin to end it 
right now by putting our American oil 
and gas workers back to work. I urge 
my colleagues to stand with Ukraine 
and to support the bill. It is really a 
choice between American energy or 
Russian energy. We can decide. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. 3731, which is 
at the desk; further, I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MARKEY. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object and to explain 
why to my colleagues here in the Sen-
ate. 
This is an unfortunate, terrible ex-
ploitation of a crisis in Russia by the 
oil and natural gas industry of the 
United States of America. They have 
no shame. They have no conscience. 
They have no sense of decency. 
This industry, this unscrupulous in-
dustry led by the American Petroleum 
Institute—really the ‘‘American Pre-
varication Institute,’’ which is what we 
are hearing here today and what we 
have heard on airways with tens of mil-
lions of dollars of television ads saying 
we have just got to ‘‘drill, baby, drill’’ 
here in the United States, that that is 
the answer to the invasion of Ukraine 
by the Russians. 
Well, a few facts might be helpful so 
that the American people can under-
stand, once again, that all the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute is about is 
tipping consumers upside down at the 
pump and shaking money out of their 
pockets. That is who they are. 
So just a few facts here: The oil in-
dustry in the United States has bid for 
leases on American public lands. Right 
now, 53 percent of the leases that the 
oil industry, the natural gas industry 
of the United States have onshore in 
our country—in our forests, in our 
fields—they are not drilling on them. 
Fifty-three percent of all the leases 
that they have from the American peo-
ple, have they been drilling to protect 
us against this day? No, they have not. 
What about offshore? Well, offshore, 
the oil industry is not using 77 percent 
of all of their existing leases off our 
shores. Right now. And what do they 
do? They come in here with crocodile 
tears, if only you would give us more 
leases, if only you would take more of 
the American people’s land and give it 
to us, then we will drill. 
Well, this is just hypocrisy on stilts. 
This is just, again, the American Pe-
troleum Institute engaging in exploita-
tive profit-making actions, and the Re-
publican Party, sadly, is cooperating 
with them in this time of crisis for the 
short-term benefit of the American Pe-
troleum Institute—which should hang 
its head in shame about this debate 
that we are having right now, when 77 
percent of all the leases offshore they 
haven’t drilled yet; 53 percent of all the 
leases onshore they haven’t drilled yet. 
And by the way, that area, you want 
to know how big it is? It is just slightly 
smaller than the State of Arkansas. In 
other words, they have got almost an 
Arkansas of public lands that they al-
ready own, they are already leasing 
from the American public, and they are 
not drilling on it. That would be every 
square inch of Arkansas. They are not 
drilling. 
What they do is they bid low for all 
the leases. They keep them. They wait 
for the day when the price goes high. 
Then they start drilling. They just 
hoard them. And they are looking for 
this as another opportunity to hoard 
more—to hoard more. 
Now, the President has responded by 
deploying the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve in the short term. There are 
600,000 barrels of oil a day that come 
into the United States. Thank God our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve has 600 
million barrels; in other words, you can 
deploy 600,000 barrels every day for 
1,000 days out of our Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to make up for the Rus-
sian oil. We can do that right now. 
But one thing that we should never 
do is just get stampeded by this oil and 
gas industry greed. This industry that 
has blocked our movement to all-elec-
tric vehicles, blocked our movement to 
wind and solar, blocked our ability to 
blunt the need to have oil for our vehi-
cles, natural gas for our homes because 
it is inconsistent with their business 
interests, their profit-making. They 
should just be ashamed of what they 
are doing here today—ashamed. 
And the Republican Party should 
have no part of it. GOP should not 
stand for ‘‘Gas and Oil Party.’’ That is 
what we are hearing here today. That 
is what I am listening to. 
And if we are going to respond, let’s 
respond together as a nation. Let’s not 
break this down into partisan politics, 
special interest politics in our country. 
Let’s come together as a nation. Let’s 
work to ensure that we are protecting 
ourselves, that we are protecting con-
sumers. 
And if the American Petroleum Insti-
tute wants to be part of this, there is 
nothing stopping them from bringing 
out 2 or 3,000 rigs this week, starting to 
drill on an area the size of Arkansas, 
waiting for them, so the oil can start 
pumping—not waiting to go through a 
whole leasing process, bidding process. 
They can do it right now. And you 
know what is going to happen? They 
are just going to sit there because they 
are making a bundle. They are tipping 
people upside down. They are exploit-
ing this. 
And by the way, let’s not understate 
the partnership which American com-
panies—some key oil companies—have 
with the Russians. That is real, too, 
right now. Let’s just not forget the 
whole history of this. How do we get 
here? How do we get bad foreign pol-
icy? How do we get bad national pol-
icy? How do we get bad oil and gas pol-
icy? How do we get it? Well, ulti-
mately, behind the curtain in almost 
every instance you find an oil and gas 
interest somewhere involved. 
And we are hearing it here today. We 
are hearing it here today. They want to 
drill off the coast of Florida. They 
want to drill off the coast of Maine or, 
at a minimum, they want the leases so 
they will be ready someday to be able 
to do it. That is their goal. And mean-
while, they just sit on their hands, not 
drilling, not drilling on an area the size 
of Arkansas because they know the less 
they do that is the more that we can 
create a panic in our country, with 
false answers—answers that may work 
on FOX, but it doesn’t work in reality. 
It just doesn’t work. It is just wrong— 
plain wrong—to be using this as an 
issue right now for the benefit of the 
‘‘American Prevarication Institute.’’ 
And behind this whole curtain of dark

money in our country looms the larg-
est voice, which is the oil and gas in-
dustry of our country. 
So we have got a chance here. We 
have got a chance to respond in the 
short run with the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, getting our allies to produce 
more oil, asking our own American 
companies to produce more oil, and 
then passing out here on the floor the 
tax breaks for all-electric vehicles. 
Now, I will give you a little number. 
If we just deploy 15 million all-electric 
vehicles, we would back out all the oil 
from Russia, just 15 million all-electric 
vehicles. The next 15 million backs out 
all of the Saudi oil. The next 15 million 
backs out all of the oil from the Middle 
East. 
You want to do something? You want 
to terrify them? You want to destroy 
their business model in Russia or the 
Middle East? That is what you should 
be doing. But, no, what we hear from 
the Republicans is we are not going to 
support any of that agenda: no money 
for wind, no money for solar, no money 
for all-electric vehicles, no money for 
new battery storage technologies—no, 
no, no, no to the long-term solution for 
the next generation of Americans, 
young people, pages here in the well 
who want to know what is the plan for 
the long term. 
So that is the sad fact of what is hap-
pening here today on the floor. So, 
from my perspective, we don’t need to 
be throwing good land and waters at 
bad actors in our society. It just is 
wrong. We shouldn’t do it. And as a re-
sult, I object to the motion of the Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. COTTON. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
MEDICARE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
imagine this. You are a CEO of a com-
pany, and one day your CFO comes 
into your office with bad news. The 
company’s costs are rapidly growing, 
and you aren’t bringing in enough 
money to keep pace with the rising 
costs. The solution here is simple: 
come up with a plan to reduce costs 
and continue serving your customers 
and honoring your agreements while 
ensuring that the company can stay 
afloat. 
If you don’t adapt and evolve, you 
fail and go out of business. Most Amer-
icans understand that. Unfortunately, 
Congress is not like most Americans. 
We are in charge of running Medicare, 
and for decades, the cost of Medicare 
has risen dramatically, but Congress 
has no plan to address future costs. 
And now we have Medicare’s Board of 
Trustees reporting that the hospital in-
surance trust fund, the fund which sup-
ports Medicare Part A, will be insol-
vent in 2026. You can see here is where 
we are. In just 4 short years—in just 4 
short years—we are going to run out of 
money to keep paying for services for 
Americans most in need. 
We are talking about things like 
emergency 
surgery, 
in-home 
healthcare, and hospice care. By 2030, 4 
years after insolvency, the trust fund 
will be $335 billion in debt. Medicare 
Part A cannot pay when it lacks funds. 
What makes matters worse, the 
Medicare trustees have been warning 
about this for years. They have told us 
that Medicare Part A hasn’t met even 
the most basic short-term goals for fis-
cal health since 2003. 
Let’s go back to the imaginary com-
pany I mentioned earlier. If you were 
an employee of that company and your 
salary depended on the company’s suc-
cess, how would you feel if, for 18 
years, the company’s leadership knew 
that the company would go under un-
less they fixed the problem, but it 
never happened? 
Instead of fixing the problem, no one 
did anything. They just kept using up 
the company’s savings. That is basi-
cally what has happened and continues 
to happen with Medicare. 
Here is what is shocking. Absolutely 
nothing has been done. Washington has 
completely ignored the warnings about 
the rising costs and declining revenues 
for Medicare, and there is no plan to 
repair the system. Career politicians in 
the Washington establishment have 
acted recklessly and immorally. 
They are plunging Medicare into bil-
lions of dollars of debt, debt that our 
grandchildren will have to pay off for 
the benefit of those in the present. To 
make matters worse, Washington poli-
ticians think they can continue to 
treat Medicare like a piggy bank and 
draw as much money as they want 
from 
it 
to 
pay 
for 
another 
unsustainable and unfunded program. 
We saw them use Medicare savings to 
help fund road construction in an infra-
structure bill. Make no mistake, I want 
to have better ports and better high-
ways, but robbing Peter to pay Paul 
with money Peter doesn’t have? That 
is wrong. 
Kicking the can down the road and 
letting our debt balloon is a disservice 
to the 60 million—60 million—Ameri-
cans, including the 4.5 million Florid-
ians, who rely on Medicare. 
Now, Senator SCHUMER is trying to 
pass a bill that will stick Congress’s 
greedy hand into the Medicare trust 
fund—this time to pay for the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
In 2020, Part B spending was $418 bil-
lion. By 2030, the cost will double to 
$871 billion. 
Look at this. I mean, this is unbe-
lievable. 
The Part B and Part D trust fund is 
funded through a combination of pre-
miums paid by beneficiaries and direct 
transfer from the U.S. Treasury of col-
lected tax revenue. That means the fu-
ture costs of Medicare Parts B and D 
are going to be paid for by higher pre-
miums for retirees and higher taxes for 
all Americans. 
Today, someone who retires at the 
Postal Service can keep their health 
plan into retirement, with the option 
of adding Medicare, but the Postal 
Service needs to pay the full cost of the 
health plan if the retiree doesn’t 
choose Medicare. Now, this is costly to 
the post office, so the proposed solu-
tion in Senator SCHUMER’s postal re-
form bill is to force all future retirees 
into Medicare as a means of saving 
money for the post office. This actually 
just shifts costs away from the Postal 
Service onto the Medicare Program— 
from one government program to an-
other—and it is a cost borne by hard- 
working taxpayers and nonpostal retir-
ees. This is a gift to the post office bal-
ance sheet, but it is a cost to every-
body else. In other words, the solution 
is as bad as the problem. 
On top of that, the CBO doesn’t even 
have an accurate estimate of how much 
this bill will actually cost. I sent a let-
ter to the CBO asking what the future 
cost of the bill would be to Medicare. 
While they could tell me there would 
be $5 billion in new deficits, they 
couldn’t provide data past 2031, when 
Medicare will be most affected by this 
proposal. Yet Congress wants to pass 
this bill and pretend like it is solving a 
problem when it only makes matters 
worse. If you look at the limited CBO 
score we have and think about what it 
says, it shows that it increases costs to 
Medicare and reduces costs to the Post-
al Service. 
Advocates are quick to say that it 
saves the government money, but that 
is wrong. The post office keeps all the 
savings and just moves the costs to 
Medicare. It doesn’t actually save the 
taxpayer any money. 
We have got to stop doing business 
like this. How can anybody in this 
body explain to their constituents that 
this is the right way to pass bills? How 
can anyone really say with a straight 
face that kicking the can down the 
road is the right thing to do? 
Do you know why the American peo-
ple don’t trust us? It is stuff like this. 
When Congress passes a bill like this, 
with zero committee process, zero 
amendments so far considered in the 
Senate, and the bill ends up being ter-
rible, well, it is not hard to see why the 
American people don’t have a ton of 
faith in Congress to solve problems. 
In 2020, Medicare spending was al-
most $1 trillion. That is $1 trillion in 
mandatory spending without any re-
view by Congress. 
I want real reform. I want to make 
sure retirees have the healthcare they 
have paid into and that the Postal 
Service is actually sustainable. That is 
why I have introduced an amendment 
to require the Postal Service to pay for 
any new costs to Medicare that this 
bill will bring. This will ensure that 
Medicare isn’t used like a piggy bank. 
This will ensure that the taxpayer and 
future nonpostal retirees aren’t forced 
to bear the burden of this Postal Serv-
ice bailout. It would ensure that the 
Postal Service pays their fair share. 
I am thankful to have the support of 
groups like 60 Plus that represent the 
interests of America’s seniors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S939 
March 2, 2022 
Unlike many career politicians who 
are running Washington off a fiscal 
cliff with over $30 trillion worth of 
debt, I have actually been a CEO. I 
have run companies and have had to 
help solve financial problems. I have 
listened to CFOs and have worked with 
budgets to turn things around. I didn’t 
come to Washington to fit in and main-
tain the status quo. I came to make 
real change that benefits American 
families, and this bill, as written right 
now, doesn’t do anything to help any-
one. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment and join me in demanding 
that Senator SCHUMER slow down and 
put this bill through the proper proc-
ess. American taxpayers and voters 
who sent us here deserve better than 
this. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Texas. 
TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, today is 
Texas Independence Day. One hundred 
eighty-six years ago today, Texans de-
clared our independence from Mexico, 
and we fired a shot for liberty that was 
heard around the world. 
As I have done a number of years in 
the past, I am going to read the letter 
from the Alamo that Lieutenant Colo-
nel William Barret Travis wrote call-
ing for help. It is a letter that ener-
gized Texans across our great State 
and that energized lovers of liberty ev-
erywhere. 
I read this letter the very first time 
that I ever stood and spoke on the Sen-
ate floor, and these are the words that 
inspire us even 186 years after they 
were written. 
Colonel Travis writes: 
To the People of Texas & All Americans in 
the World— 
Fellow Citizens & compatriots—I am be-
sieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexi-
cans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a 
continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 
hours & have not lost a man—The enemy has 
demanded a surrender at discretion, other-
wise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, 
if the fort is taken—I have answered the de-
mand with a cannon shot, & our flag still 
waves proudly from the walls—I shall never 
surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in 
the name of Liberty, of patriotism & every-
thing dear to the American character, to 
come to our aid, with all dispatch— 
The enemy is receiving reinforce-
ments daily & will no doubt increase to 
three or four thousand in four or five 
days. If this call is neglected, I am de-
termined to sustain myself as long as 
possible & die like a soldier who never 
forgets what is due to his own honor & 
that of his country—Victory or Death. 
William Barret Travis, Lt.Col.comdt. 
PS: The Lord is on our side—When the 
enemy appeared in sight we had not three 
bushels of corn—We have since found in de-
serted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into 
the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves. 
Travis. 
The brave men and women at the 
Alamo would go on to give their lives 
for 
liberty, 
including 
Travis, 
Jim 
Bowie, and Davy Crockett. 
Shortly thereafter, the Texans were 
victorious at the Battle of San Jacinto. 
With a cry in the air of ‘‘Remember the 
Alamo,’’ the heroes who gave their 
lives for liberty inspired a successful 
revolution, and the Republic of Texas 
was formed. 
Sam Houston, one of the founding fa-
thers of the Lone Star State, was also 
born on this very day 229 years ago. 
Sam Houston was a great American. 
He was born in Virginia and spent 
many years in Tennessee, where he 
served in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and then became the Governor of 
Tennessee. In Texas, he was the George 
Washington of Texas. He served as the 
commander in chief for the Texas 
Army and led the Texas Army to vic-
tory in our revolution. When Texas be-
came independent, Houston served in 
the Texas House of Representatives 
and then as President of the Republic 
of Texas. When Texas joined the United 
States, he served in the U.S. Senate 
and then, finally, as the Governor of 
Texas. 
He was a tireless, talented leader and 
a great statesman who believed in free-
dom. His words, ‘‘Govern wisely and as 
little as possible,’’ are still true today, 
and the Lone Star State still endeavors 
to follow that principle. 
The Republic of Texas was an inde-
pendent nation from 1836 to 1845—for 9 
years. Then Texas joined the United 
States of America. 
Indeed, there is one fact I discovered 
a couple of years ago. Heidi and I are 
members of the First Baptist Church in 
Houston. We discovered that the First 
Baptist Church was actually started by 
American missionaries in a foreign 
country. Texas was an independent na-
tion, and American missionaries came 
to the Republic of Texas and founded 
the First Baptist Church, which, today, 
thrives in my hometown of Houston. 
Texans are proud Americans, but we 
are also proud of the history—the di-
verse, brave, extraordinary history—of 
those Texans all those years later. Wil-
liam Travis, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, 
Davy Crockett, and all of the people 
they led risked everything to make 
freedom a reality for generations of 
Texans. 
I am reminded of a story that was 
told to me by a former Senator from 
Texas, my friend Phil Gramm. 
Phil Gramm, in the early 1980s, was a 
Member of the House of Representa-
tives. He was a Democrat. He was a 
conservative Democrat. Ronald Reagan 
was President, and Phil Gramm, as a 
conservative Democrat in the House, 
introduced the Reagan tax cuts, and he 
fought for the Reagan tax cuts. Phil 
described a meeting with other con-
servative Democrats in Texas back 
when we had conservative Democrats 
in Texas—a meeting wherein he was 
urging his fellow Democrats to support 
the Reagan tax cuts. Phil drew an anal-
ogy to the Alamo on that fateful day 
when Colonel Travis drew a line in the 
sand with a sword and called on each of 
the men there to step across that line 
and commit to defending the Alamo. 
One 
of 
those 
other 
conservative 
Democrats said to him at the time: 
Phil, everybody who stepped across 
that line died. 
Phil, in not missing a beat, chuckled 
and said: Yes. Yes, they did. And do 
you know what? Everybody who didn’t 
step across that line died, too, and no-
body remembers their names. 
Today, I celebrate heroes—heroes 
who fought to make freedom a reality 
for generations of Texans. Today, we 
celebrate, and we honor their sac-
rifices. 
To every Texan, I wish you a very 
happy Texas Independence Day. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
UKRAINE 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, the 
Ukrainian people have captured the 
hearts 
of 
freedom-loving 
men 
and 
women around the world since Putin 
launched his unprovoked invasion of 
their homeland last week. 
Even as we speak, they are still 
under attack, not just in the capital of 
Kyiv but in cities all across Ukraine. 
The images coming out of Ukraine are 
truly heartbreaking: newborn babies in 
need of intensive care, kindergarten 
buildings and apartment complexes 
being shelled indiscriminately, and 
tearful goodbyes between loved ones. 
Putin’s invasion has caused Europe’s 
largest refugee crisis this century. Ac-
cording to the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees, nearly 900,000 Ukrainians 
have fled to neighboring countries so 
far, but many of the other images we 
have seen show inspiring courage. Citi-
zens of EU countries have welcomed 
their Ukrainian neighbors with open 
arms. 
Regular, 
everyday 
men 
and 
women—teachers and software engi-
neers and moms and dads—have taken 
up arms to defend their country and 
their loved ones. President Zelenskyy 
has chosen to remain in Ukraine when 
he could have fled, refusing to desert 
his people in their darkest hour. 
The English writer G.K. Chesterton 
once said: 
The true soldier fights not because he 
hates what is in front of him, but because he 
loves what is behind him. 
I can’t think of a better way to de-
scribe this conflict. 
The Russians are fighting to fulfill 
Putin’s 
imperial 
ambitions. 
The 
Ukrainians are fighting to protect 
their families, their democracy, and 
everything that they hold dear. That 
may be their greatest advantage as 
they, God willing, continue to hold out 
in the coming days. 
Responsibility for this horrific inva-
sion lies squarely with Putin. Leading 
up to this crisis, President Biden and 
our allies offered Russia every oppor-
tunity to choose deescalation and 
peace. Instead, Putin chose to use di-
plomacy as a smokescreen, buying 
time while he prepared for war. 
In a deliberate message of contempt 
for 
the 
international 
community, 
Putin ordered the attack to begin

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S940 
March 2, 2022 
while the U.N. Security Council was 
meeting to discuss Russia’s buildup on 
the Ukrainian border. Here is a glimpse 
into how little power organizations 
like the U.N. have in moments of crisis 
like this: During this meeting on what 
to do about Russia’s coming invasion, 
the Russian Ambassador was presiding. 
Innocent Ukrainians as young as 6 
years old are being killed because one 
man fancies himself the next Joseph 
Stalin. Because of one man’s desire to 
restore the borders of the Soviet 
Union, the fundamental principles of 
security in Europe are in peril. 
In response to this invasion, Presi-
dent Biden has announced new sanc-
tions against Russia. These measures 
will affect 2 of Russia’s largest banks— 
Sberbank and VTB—as well as 45 of 
their subsidiaries. The administration 
is also imposing sanctions against sev-
eral other Russian financial institu-
tions and a number of state-owned en-
terprises. 
The United States, with our allies 
and partners, not just in Europe but 
also in Asia, have agreed to pursue 
even more aggressive sanctions against 
Russia. That includes beginning to re-
move certain Russian banks from the 
global SWIFT financial messaging net-
work. It includes freezing the currency 
reserves of Russia’s central bank. All 
of this will make Putin and his inner 
circle feel the pain. It will hurt Rus-
sia’s ability to wage war now and in 
the future. Many companies are joining 
this effort on their own, and they are 
withdrawing from the Russian market. 
Putin’s unprecedented aggression de-
mands an unprecedented response. Be-
yond economic sanctions, this invasion 
has only made the NATO alliance 
stronger and more resolved to stand 
firm against unlawful aggression. This 
includes Germany, which has tradition-
ally taken a more positive view of Rus-
sia than many of our other European 
allies. 
Germany’s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, 
has rightly committed to increasing 
Germany’s military investment after 
decades of putting defense spending on 
the back burner. Scholz also said Ger-
many would seriously pursue options 
to reduce their reliance on Russia for 
natural gas. If he follows through on 
increasing Germany’s military spend-
ing, that will bring German defense in-
vestment above the 2 percent target 
NATO has set for its members by 2024— 
a target that most NATO countries 
still aren’t meeting. 
While historically neutral Sweden 
and Finland are considering joining 
NATO, they aren’t members yet, but 
they are still sending much needed 
military aid to Ukraine. Even Switzer-
land has broken its tradition of neu-
trality in order to freeze billions in 
Russian assets being held in Swiss 
banks, and our other allies and part-
ners around the world, like Japan and 
Australia, are helping fund the Ukrain-
ian resistance as well. 
After this near universal condemna-
tion from the world’s democracies, 
Putin hasn’t backed down. No. He has 
turned to nuclear blackmail. He put 
Russia’s nuclear forces into special 
combat readiness on Sunday, explicitly 
using Russia’s nuclear deterrent to dis-
courage Western nations from sup-
porting Ukraine. 
This kind of escalation is unthink-
able to Americans but not to Putin. 
This is why the men and women of the 
U.S. Strategic Command, which is 
based at Offutt Air Force Base in Ne-
braska, work day and night to deter 
threats like these. There is a reason 
that their motto is ‘‘Peace is Our Pro-
fession.’’ 
Separately, 
at 
least 
five 
Offutt-based jets from the Air Force’s 
55th Wing are flying reconnaissance 
missions in Europe. Together, these 
planes have flown 10 of the 86 missions 
the United States and our NATO allies 
carried out in the days leading up to 
the Russian attack. I was told of these 
missions during a visit to Offutt last 
Friday. 
In addition to what we have done so 
far, I believe the Ukraine crisis de-
mands that we fundamentally reevalu-
ate our approach to dealing with Putin. 
We can no longer pretend that he 
might, one day, play by the same rules 
as the rest of us. 
Since he came to power, Presidents 
of both parties have sought to improve 
relations with him. Too often, they 
have overlooked decades of bad behav-
ior to try to achieve that goal, hoping 
that American restraint might lead 
Moscow to take that same approach. 
If it wasn’t clear even before this at-
tack, the events of the past week have 
proven that idea to be a fantasy. 
Putin thought Russia would get a 
quick win when he invaded Ukraine. He 
never expected this kind of resistance 
from the outmatched and the out-
numbered Ukrainians. But he didn’t ac-
count for their bravery. He didn’t ac-
count for the fact that while Russia is 
fighting to gobble up more land in 
Eastern Europe, the Ukrainians are 
fighting to protect their children, 
spouses, parents, and their very way of 
life. 
After the events of the past week, 
Putin’s naked aggression, his imperial 
ambitions, and his contempt for the 
international order are undeniable. 
Global norms and treaty obligations 
mean nothing—they mean nothing to 
him. Russia had explicitly sworn to up-
hold Ukraine’s territorial integrity in 
the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, one 
more agreement added to the long list 
of those Russia has violated under 
Putin. 
After his completely unprovoked in-
vasion, this would-be 21st-century czar 
has lost whatever credibility he had 
left. The United States and our allies 
must keep this in mind as we think 
about where we go from here. 
We have to accept that as long as 
Putin is in power, a cooperative rela-
tionship with Russia will not be pos-
sible. We have to do what we can to 
push back against Putin’s warmon-
gering and continue to support the 
brave people of Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
KLEPTOCRACY 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as 
I rise today, kleptocracy is on the 
march in Europe, showing how un-
checked corruption leads to evil. 
Vladimir Putin’s corrupt regime fab-
ricated a pretext to invade and sub-
jugate the sovereign and peaceful na-
tion of Ukraine. Putin’s attack helps 
divert the Russian people from his fes-
tering corruption and misrule, as jailed 
Russian 
opposition 
leader 
Alexey 
Navalny put it. 
America and our allies are meting 
out stiff sanctions; and my colleagues 
and I here in Congress are working on 
additional measures to deliver pun-
ishing financial blows to Putin and his 
corrupt oligarchs. But we must con-
sider how we arrived at this moment. 
Putin has, for decades, deployed cor-
ruption and kleptocracy to strengthen 
his grip on Russia’s government and to 
project power and influence throughout 
the region. In the process, he deci-
mated Russia’s free press, attacked— 
physically and economically—all polit-
ical opposition, and grew his own per-
sonal fortune to what is thought to be 
the largest in the world. I say ‘‘thought 
to be’’ because Putin’s wealth is hidden 
behind shell corporations and nestled 
in tax havens, far from the view of the 
people he robs and oppresses. And 
along the way, he cultivated—through 
favors, force, or fortunes—a group of 
oligarchs who serve him. 
It is important to understand that 
Putin isn’t special. We have plenty of 
kleptocrats around the globe. Putin 
just happens to be in charge of a big 
and oil-rich country with a military at 
his command, a gangster with an army 
running a gas station, as Senator 
McCain used to say. 
America is engaged in a growing 
clash of civilizations against this brand 
of corrupt leadership. Democracy and 
the free market are on one side; 
kleptocracy and corruption are on the 
other. And we will prevail in this clash 
by pursuing one powerful value of rule 
of law society: transparency. 
Kleptocrats and criminals seek the 
protection of our rule of law and our 
secure financial system to stow their 
illicit money, but they need anonym-
ity. They need to hide it. That is why 
so much anonymously owned luxury 
real estate sits empty in America, in 
some places actually driving up local 
housing costs for normal people. And 
that is why shell corporations in Amer-
ican States multiply. 
The Pandora Papers last year re-
vealed webs of American shell corpora-
tions and trusts hiding dirty assets. It 
revealed 
professionals—lawyers, 
ac-
counts, and real estate agents—aiding 
and abetting the hiding of those dirty 
assets. Shining the light of trans-
parency on kleptocrats’ money is a po-
tent countermeasure to their power. 
Late in 2020, Congress passed the 
most important anti-money laundering

March 2, 2022 
reform law in two decades: the Cor-
porate Transparency Act. It was very 
bipartisan. Senators GRASSLEY, GRA-
HAM, WYDEN, RUBIO, BROWN, CRAPO, 
WARNER, COTTON, and I all spent years 
getting that bill done. Our aim was to 
arm law enforcement with knowledge 
of the ‘‘beneficial owner’’—the real per-
son—who is behind American shell cor-
porations. 
Now, the Treasury Department’s Fi-
nancial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
FinCEN, is implementing our bene-
ficial ownership provisions. And the 
new rule promises to be a strong coun-
termeasure. 
It requires anyone who exerts sub-
stantial control directly or indirectly 
over a legal entity to identify them-
selves as the beneficial owner. That is 
what we wanted. It is clear enough so 
that companies know what they have 
to do, while minimizing the risk that 
bad actors can evade disclosure. 
And its timelines for reporting and 
updating beneficial ownership informa-
tion are fair, providing law enforce-
ment and national security officials 
timely information without imposing 
unreasonable turnarounds for legiti-
mate companies. 
The beneficial ownership rule also 
avoided 
a 
trap. 
Some 
had 
urged 
FinCEN to add exceptions to the re-
porting requirements on top of the 
ones Congress included in the bill. 
Well, we worked hard to come up with 
the right list of excepted entities. It is 
encouraging to see FinCEN stand firm 
and avoid watering down the rule with 
new unjustified exceptions. 
FinCEN is also working on a review 
of Bank Secrecy Act regulations with 
an eye toward a new ‘‘anti-money laun-
dering and counterterror financing’’ 
framework. This review offers a chance 
to take on some big challenges. 
We need to make sure American pro-
fessionals aren’t aiding and abetting 
kleptocrats. Investing in hedge funds, 
luxury real estate, high-priced art, ex-
pensive cars, mega yachts all requires 
help from professionals, and those pro-
fessionals aren’t bound to ‘‘anti-money 
laundering and counterterror financ-
ing’’ safeguards like our banks are. 
Private investment funds are worth 
about $11 trillion. You can hide a lot of 
mischief in $11 trillion. An FBI intel-
ligence bulletin leaked in 2020 warned 
that ‘‘threat actors’’ used those funds 
to launder their money into rule-of-law 
financial systems. That is a vulnerabil-
ity we need to close. 
This aiding and abetting problem, 
giving aid and comfort to our enemies, 
extends to professional services from 
lawyers, accountants, company and 
trust formation agents, even PR firms. 
But on this front, FinCEN’s hands are 
tied. Congress will need to step in to 
clean that up. 
Kleptocrats and criminals constantly 
change the methods they use to hide 
their money. Trade-based money laun-
dering, for instance, allows bad actors 
to trade everything from vegetables to 
washing machines as a way to move 
their money around internationally. 
We need better coordination among 
key agencies involved in overseeing 
trade and better information on sus-
picious financial and trade activity 
that is shared more efficiently among 
various Federal authorities. 
Real estate is a massive target for 
money launderers. In August of last 
year, the watchdog group Global Fi-
nancial Integrity released a report 
showing over $2.3 billion laundered 
through American real estate over the 
previous half decade. As Global Finan-
cial Integrity would tell you, this is 
just what they could identify. The real 
number is probably far higher. 
The good news there is we have a 
countermeasure that works well. In 
2016, FinCEN started the ‘‘geographic 
targeting order’’ program, which re-
quires title insurers to report to 
FinCEN beneficial ownership informa-
tion of shell companies that stash 
money in high-priced real estate. That 
program started in New York and 
Miami, then expanded to a dozen juris-
dictions nationwide. The Congressional 
Research Service has reviewed it and 
said these targeting orders work. 
Now, FinCEN is proposing a rule to 
make these orders permanent and ex-
pand 
coverage 
across 
the 
United 
States. It looks like FinCEN will de-
liver that improvement. And if it does, 
that is a big win, particularly if that 
rule lines up with our beneficial owner-
ship rule and if it extends to cover 
commercial, as well as residential real 
estate. 
In Congress, we should pass legisla-
tion to help FinCEN address profes-
sional aiders and abettors. There is bi-
partisan legislation in the House, the 
ENABLERS Act, which I hope to intro-
duce here in the Senate. I have also in-
troduced 
bipartisan 
legislation 
to 
make it a crime for foreign officials to 
demand bribes from Americans. At the 
moment, it is only a crime to pay 
bribes. And we should pay close atten-
tion to others in the dark economy, 
like drug traffickers and terrorists. 
I am working on legislation to target 
money laundering related to the illicit 
narcotics trade. Indeed, we had a hear-
ing on it today. 
Finally, we need to work together 
with the international community. 
When U.S. defenses are strengthened, 
kleptocrats will direct their dirty 
money to some other willing sanc-
tuary. So it matters that the Biden ad-
ministration has announced a trans-
atlantic, interagency task force to help 
crack down on ill-gotten assets stowed 
in the West by Russian oligarchs and 
their families, their mistresses, their 
stooges, whomever. This is exactly the 
right approach. We must work with 
friends abroad to close off hidey-holes 
for oligarchs, bolster the rule of law, 
expand judicial transparency, and in-
crease access to justice in struggling 
jurisdictions. 
I met recently with a Member of the 
Ukrainian 
Parliament 
who 
said 
a 
phrase—that we were talking about ac-
tually during the Munich Security 
Conference codel—which was: It is not 
enough to freeze the oligarch’s assets; 
we need to seize the oligarch’s assets. 
We can do so even theatrically, and 
to take a camera through the prepos-
terous and grotesque wealth and show 
the people of Russia what was stolen 
from them would be as significant a 
public 
relations 
victory 
as 
when 
Ukrainians 
went 
through 
their 
oligarch’s mansion and showed every-
thing from gold toilet seats to private 
petting zoos. 
Kleptocrats, 
like 
Putin 
and 
his 
oligarchs, can be defeated. A little sun-
light will vanquish them. Free soci-
eties and the rule of law can win the 
long battle we face against kleptocracy 
and corruption. 
This is a national security matter, 
not just a question of doing good. This 
is a national security matter, and 
these are the tools—the ones I have de-
scribed, the tools of transparency— 
that will secure our victory. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the war in Ukraine. One week ago, 
Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine by 
land, by sea, and by air. Now we know 
that thousands of people are dead. 
Vladimir Putin prepared for this in-
vasion, and he prepared over the course 
of at least 3 months. Month after 
month after month, he moved troops, 
he moved weapons, and he moved them 
to the border with Ukraine. Now, many 
of these troops are attacking the cap-
ital city of Kyiv. The Ukrainian people 
are fighting bravely. Their example is 
an inspiration to the world. They are 
outnumbered, they are outgunned, and 
yet they continue to fight for their 
freedom. 
Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin 
has caused this war. He alone is respon-
sible. He is responsible for the death 
and the destruction that the world is 
witnessing now. Yet, it is undeniable 
that the Biden administration’s so- 
called deterrence and diplomacy have 
failed. 
Joe Biden ran for President on com-
petence and on his foreign policy ex-
pertise. As a candidate for President, 
Joe Biden said Putin’s days of tyranny 
would be over if he became President— 
Putin’s days of tyranny would be over 
if Joe Biden were elected President. 
The opposite has occurred under this 
administration. 
Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
become 
emboldened like never before. Putin is 
cunning, he is opportunistic, and he is 
aggressive. When he sees an oppor-
tunity, he takes it. He can smell weak-
ness, and he views Joe Biden as weak 
and ineffective. Clearly that has be-
come even more so after Joe Biden’s 
disgraceful and deadly surrender from 
Afghanistan. Enemies of ours around 
the world have become emboldened. 
After 
Afghanistan 
fell, 
Vladimir 
Putin increased his weapons testing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S942 
March 2, 2022 
Just a few months later, Vladimir 
Putin put 100,000 troops on the border 
of Ukraine. How did the President of 
the United States, Joe Biden, respond? 
He lobbied this body, the Senate, 
against imposing sanctions on Vladi-
mir Putin. 
In January, this Senate voted on 
sanctions for Putin’s Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. I came to the floor; I argued 
that the Senate needed to act quickly. 
Almost every Democrat in this body 
had previously supported sanctions. 
Under pressure from the White House, 
the Democrats reversed course. They 
buckled to the demands of the Presi-
dent of the United States, who had a 
different view than this body in a 
broad, bipartisan consensus had had 
previously of sanctioning the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline between Russia and 
Germany. Senate Democrats blocked 
the sanctions. 
Look, energy is the reason that 
Vladimir Putin is flush with cash. He 
has hit the jackpot. His energy reve-
nues are up, and more than $1 out of 
every $3 that Vladimir Putin has in 
Russia’s treasury is energy-related. 
High energy prices today that Ameri-
cans are paying at the pump and people 
around world are paying are the reason 
why Putin can indefinitely—how he 
can afford this invasion. 
So who is Putin’s No. 1 rival for en-
ergy production? Well, it is the United 
States. But under Joe Biden, American 
crude oil production is down—down 
more than a million barrels each and 
every day from what it was prior to the 
pandemic. 
It is not a lack of American energy 
resources, and it is not a lack of Amer-
ican energy workers. They want to 
work. The energy is in the ground. This 
is a direct result of the far-left driven 
anti-American energy policies of the 
Joe Biden administration. 
On Joe Biden’s first day in office, he 
killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, and 
he bragged about it. So how much en-
ergy would be coming across from the 
Keystone 
XL 
Pipeline? 
Well 
over 
800,000 barrels a day. But that number 
today is zero. 
How much energy are we bringing in 
from Russia each and every day into 
the United States, imported from Rus-
sia, sending money to Vladimir Putin? 
Well, 670,000 barrels a day. If he hadn’t 
killed Keystone, we would be bringing 
more energy in that way, and we are 
now buying and sending money to 
Vladimir Putin. And the President 
bragged about it, thumped his chest: I 
killed Keystone. 
He also blocked new oil and gas 
leases on public lands, stopped Amer-
ican exploration for energy in the Arc-
tic. Joe Biden approves of Vladimir 
Putin producing energy; it seems he is 
only opposed to American energy pro-
duction. 
Just days before he surrendered in 
Afghanistan, Joe Biden sent his Na-
tional Security Advisor to beg Russia 
to produce more oil to sell to us. It is 
hard to believe. People watching said 
that can’t be true, and I would say: Go 
to the White House website. Go right 
now; see if it is still there. It was there 
two nights ago—the National Security 
Advisor 
saying: 
We 
are 
asking 
OPEC+—and the ‘‘plus’’ is Russia; it is 
Putin—to produce more energy to sell 
to us. 
Why should we depend upon people 
who are our enemies, whose intentions 
are not kind or caring for us, and who 
is now—Vladimir Putin is attacking 
his neighbor in a bloodthirsty way— 
rather than allow us to produce Amer-
ican energy that we have today in the 
ground in this Nation? 
So it is no wonder that Putin can 
now afford another assault. Oil hit over 
$100 a barrel last week—the highest in 
7 years, and it is even higher than that 
today. 
Today, American families in every 
State are paying $1 a gallon or more 
for each additional gallon of gas that 
they put in the tank than they were 
the day Joe Biden became President of 
the United States, and that is soon 
going to be even a higher number, a 
higher amount that people are going to 
be paying as a result of this President’s 
policies. The situation is getting worse. 
President Biden’s response to the 
buildup to the war in Ukraine has been 
mismanagement and weakness. After 
Russia invaded Ukraine, Joe Biden 
issued sanctions on Russia that are far 
too little too late. The Biden deter-
rence was after the fact. That didn’t 
seem more like punishment than deter-
rence. It reminds me when President 
Obama said he was going to be leading 
from behind. Deterrence after the fact 
is the same thing as no deterrence at 
all. Try to deter someone from doing 
something. 
Even after the invasion has occurred 
and even after we see the tanks lined 
up heading into Kyiv, Joe Biden is not 
yet ready to sanction Russian energy 
and clearly not ready to produce Amer-
ican energy to make up for what we 
buy from them. 
His Deputy National Security Advi-
sor went to the podium and said our 
sanctions are not designed to cause any 
disruption to the current flow of en-
ergy from Russia to the world. This ad-
ministration has caused plenty of dis-
ruption in the flow of energy from 
America, from our homeland. We are 
not going to disrupt energy from Rus-
sia, oh, no. It was actually Germany 
that stood up and finally stopped Putin 
from getting the pipeline. Joe Biden 
won’t touch the one industry that is 
propping up Vladimir Putin. Yet he 
seemed to be happy—Joe Biden seems 
to be happy with his continued war on 
American energy. He has effectively 
put harsher sanctions on American en-
ergy workers than he does on Russian 
energy thugs. 
The war in Ukraine is going to lead 
to higher energy prices in this country; 
there is no doubt about it. But we have 
seen no change in Joe Biden’s energy 
policies in spite of the abundant energy 
resources we have in this country. The 
White House Press Secretary was asked 
recently if Joe Biden was considering 
allowing more energy production here 
at home in the United States. We have 
the resources; we have the workers; the 
jobs are necessary; and, effectively, she 
just said no. We heard nothing about it 
in the State of the Union last night— 
not a thing. 
Over the weekend, actually, the 
President’s Press Secretary went on 
television and doubled down. She said 
she refused to rule out importing oil 
from Iran. Oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral lands are still in limbo. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission, FERC—and there will be a 
hearing before the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee tomor-
row—recently decided, in a 100-percent 
partisan 3-to-2 vote, to make it even 
harder to build natural gas pipelines in 
America. Harder. 
The 
day 
after 
Russia 
invaded 
Ukraine, 
this 
administration, 
the 
Biden administration, said uranium 
was no longer a critical mineral for the 
United States—no longer a critical 
mineral. American businesses get half 
of the uranium we use from Russia and 
its partners. It is a critical mineral but 
not according to the Biden administra-
tion. Now we are going to become even 
more dependent on Russia, and Putin 
will get even wealthier. 
It seems like Joe Biden and his advis-
ers want to turn our energy sector into 
what we have seen over the last num-
ber of years in Germany—dependent on 
other countries, begging enemies to 
help us keep the lights on. 
And just before the Russian invasion, 
John Kerry, the President’s Climate 
Envoy, said in an interview with BBC— 
this is the former Secretary of State of 
the United States—said he was con-
cerned that the war in Ukraine would 
distract people from his climate agen-
da. You can’t believe it. This is very 
disturbing to people all around my 
home State, and I would think all 
around America. This is a delusional 
obsession, distracted from the reality 
of the world and of our Nation. 
Innocent people are being slaugh-
tered. Vladimir Putin is conducting nu-
clear drills. People around the world 
are terrified. People are looking to the 
United States for leadership, and we 
have a high official of this administra-
tion concerned it is going to distract 
from this White House’s and this ad-
ministration’s climate agenda. 
The American people know what we 
need to do. We need to continue to sup-
port and send lethal weapons to our 
friends in Ukraine, and clearly we need 
to produce more American energy. We 
have it. We have it in the ground. This 
administration will not let us get it 
out. More American energy will help us 
at home. It will help bring down prices 
at home. More American energy will 
help us defund Putin’s military aggres-
sion. It is our energy dollars that are 
paying for Putin’s killing machine. 
More American energy will help our 
allies from being held hostage by

Vladimir Putin. This is why I have in-
troduced legislation called the ES-
CAPE Act, Energy Security Coopera-
tion with Allied Partners in Europe. It 
expedites the sale of natural gas from 
America to our NATO allies so they 
don’t have to buy it from Vladimir 
Putin. I brought it to the floor yester-
day, and Democrats objected to a unan-
imous consent to pass it. 
I sent a letter to the President today 
with every Republican on the Senate 
Energy Committee as well as Senator 
LUMMIS—sent a letter to the White 
House today detailing 10 specific ac-
tions that the President of the United 
States can take right now to produce 
more American energy and undermine 
Vladimir Putin and help other NATO 
allies and help the people of Ukraine. 
We as a nation are much better off sell-
ing American energy to our friends 
than for us as a nation to have to buy 
energy from our enemies. More Amer-
ican energy means more American 
strength and more American security. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The majority whip. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks 
ago, I came to the floor to request 
unanimous consent for the Senate to 
take up and confirm six U.S. attorneys 
and two U.S. marshal nominations. 
These nominees are all highly quali-
fied. They have critical law enforce-
ment experience, and they want to 
serve this country at new levels. They 
were voted out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which I chair, by a voice vote. 
They have the support of their home 
State Senators. They have the support 
of other local law enforcement. They 
deserve to be confirmed. We need 
them—right 
now—without 
further 
delay. 
And the obvious question is, Why are 
they being held up? Why are these dedi-
cated men and women not yet in office, 
ready to tackle violent crime—which 
we know is a problem across America? 
Why aren’t they in office to prosecute 
fraud and terrorism? Why aren’t they 
there to protect families and children 
across America? One reason—the jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
You see, when I made my unanimous 
consent request—a request joined by 
the majority leader and Senators from 
all the affected States—one Senator 
objected. Only one Senator refused to 
allow these individuals’ confirmation 
so that they could continue to serve 
this Nation and the cause of law en-
forcement. And that same Senator, the 
junior Senator from Arkansas, con-
tinues to engage in this mindless ob-
struction, jeopardizing the safety of 
communities outside of Arkansas for 
reasons which are still hard to under-
stand. 
Why is the junior Senator blocking 
well-qualified individuals from law en-
forcement? What has he got against 
law enforcement at this moment in 
America’s history? Well, it doesn’t 
have anything to do with the nominees 
themselves or their qualifications. We 
have asked him over and over. He has 
no complaint about any single one of 
them. He happened to pick these people 
out as his political targets. He is con-
cerned about a completely unrelated 
issue. Let me tell you what it is. 
In the summer of 2020, Federal law 
enforcement personnel were dispatched 
to Portland, OR, to help protect the 
Federal courthouse. A number of those 
Federal officers now face lawsuits re-
lating to the events that happened 
there. 
The Department of Justice often rep-
resents Federal employees who were 
sued 
in 
their 
individual 
capacity. 
Under governing regulations, the De-
partment of Justice goes through a 
process to determine that such rep-
resentation would be ‘‘in the interests 
of the United States.’’ 
And in this matter, the Department 
of Justice has either represented or 
paid for the representation of more 
than 70 law enforcement officials who 
have been sued. The Department has 
declined to represent one individual— 
only one—and continues to review 
three additional requests for represen-
tation. 
The Senator from Arkansas says he 
wants to know why, but the Depart-
ment of Justice has made it clear it 
can’t comment on these four cases. Re-
member what you first learned when 
you were elected to the U.S. Senate 
and somebody came to you and said: I 
need for you to be my advocate. I need 
for you to be my champion. 
You said to them: I would like to do 
it, but first you have to sign a privacy 
waiver, a confidentiality waiver. I 
can’t represent you or talk about you 
unless I have that waiver. 
The last time we came to the floor, I 
asked the junior Senator from Arkan-
sas: Have these three who are being 
under review, for example, these Fed-
eral employees, given you a privacy 
waiver? Can you tell us what the cir-
cumstances are that slowed it down? 
No. So here he is, their champion and 
advocate, and they don’t trust him 
with a privacy waiver or they would 
rather their circumstances not become 
public. They made that decision. It is 
pretty complicated in a way. The bot-
tom line is, who is paying for this com-
plication and the stalling tactic? Inno-
cent people, six U.S. attorneys, two 
U.S. marshals—not in the State of Ar-
kansas. 
The Department of Justice has made 
it clear it can’t comment on these 
cases ‘‘in light of significant confiden-
tiality interests and applicable privi-
leges.’’ 
The Senator from Arkansas is hear-
ing none of it. For example, DOJ’s reg-
ulations make it clear that commu-
nications about an employee’s request 
for representation are protected by an 
attorney-client privilege. The Senator 
from Arkansas wants us to ignore that. 
The Privacy Act prevents the Depart-
ment of Justice from disclosing per-
sonal records related to employees 
without their consent. 
Unless things have changed in the 
last 2 weeks, the Senator who is advo-
cating for these people has never re-
ceived that. He has never received 
those consents. These privileges pro-
tect the privacy of the very law en-
forcement personnel whose interests 
the junior Senator from Arkansas 
claims 
to 
represent. 
The 
Senator 
claims to be speaking on behalf of his 
deputy marshals, but he is asking the 
Justice Department to violate legal 
privileges and attorney-client privi-
leges that are designed to specifically 
protect them and other Federal em-
ployees. 
It is important to add that it is 
standard practice for any Member of 
Congress to obtain a Privacy Act waiv-
er. We have done it thousands of times 
in our office—an act that gives a waiv-
er for a constituent, authorizing the of-
fice to make inquiries on their behalf. 
Apparently, the Senator from Arkan-
sas doesn’t have that waiver or he 
would explain to us what the cir-
cumstances are. It seems that the peo-
ple he wants to protect don’t trust him 
with that information or don’t want it 
to become public. 
The Senator is upset that the Justice 
Department is following the law and a 
process required by their own rules and 
regulations—a process that now affects 
four individuals. His response is to 
block the confirmation of every U.S. 
attorney and every U.S. marshal on the 
Senate calendar. How can you claim, as 
he does, to be tough on crime if you are 
blocking well-qualified law enforce-
ment officials from serving because of 
a grievance that has nothing to do with 
them personally? The junior Senator 
from Arkansas should let these law en-
forcement officials do their job. 
Often we hear the complaint: Oh, 
they want to defund the police. You 
heard last night, President Biden said 
we need to fund the police and got a 
standing ovation from everybody. 
This is a new approach. Instead of 
funding the police, this one Senator is 
going to stop law enforcement from 
even doing their job. For example, yes-
terday, I chaired a hearing in the Judi-
ciary Committee. We examined how 
the Federal Government can help pre-
vent and respond to the surge in 
carjackings across America over the 
last 2 years. It was an important bipar-
tisan hearing with witnesses from law 
enforcement, community groups, and 
the 
automobile 
industry 
testifying 
about solutions to a problem that is an 
urgent issue in many of our commu-
nities and testifying to the need for 
U.S. attorneys to enforce the law in 
their jurisdictions. The same junior 
Senator from Arkansas, who is leaving 
these U.S. attorneys spots vacant be-
cause he is unhappy with the way he is 
being treated by the Department of 
Justice, didn’t attend the hearing. And 
he is blocking votes on Federal law en-
forcement nominees charged with help-
ing to protect our communities from

carjackings and other violent crimes. 
How can that be anything other than 
soft on law and order? 
Before I proceed to my unanimous 
consent, I want to note the over-
whelming support these U.S. attorneys 
and U.S. marshal nominees have from 
law enforcement professionals in their 
States. We are receiving dozens of let-
ters because of this outrageous hold by 
the Senator from Arkansas—letters 
that speak not just to the nominees’ 
qualifications but the need to confirm 
them now. 
Consider the support for Chief LaDon 
Reynolds to be the U.S. marshal for the 
Northern District of Illinois. Senator 
DUCKWORTH and I have received letters 
from the director of the Illinois State 
Police and police chiefs in towns and 
cities like Park Ridge, Hazel Crest, and 
Calumet Park. It is unanimous. Chief 
Reynolds is a man for the job, and he is 
waiting and waiting and waiting on the 
junior Senator from Arkansas. 
The Senate has also received letters 
of support for several of the other 
nominees who face this needless block-
ade. Aaron Ford, the attorney general 
of Nevada, has written in support for 
Jason Frierson to be that State’s U.S. 
attorney. Both Senators from Nevada 
took the floor last time we brought 
this issue up and supported him. 
The chiefs of police of Rochester, Du-
luth, and Saint Paul, MN, have joined 
the Sheriff of Ramsey County, MN, 
urging the Senate to quickly confirm 
Andrew Luger as Minnesota’s U.S. at-
torney and Eddie Frizell to be the 
State’s U.S. marshal. 
Mark Totten, nominated to be U.S. 
attorney for the Western District of 
Michigan, has the support of county 
prosecutors and sheriffs throughout 
the State, as well as from Michigan At-
torney General Dana Nessel and the 
Michigan Association of Police Organi-
zations. 
And the Sheriff of DeKalb County, 
GA, urges the Senate to swiftly con-
firm Ryan Buchanan to be U.S. attor-
ney for the Northern District of Geor-
gia. 
These law enforcement officials want 
reinforcement. We have the profes-
sionals to take over these positions 
now; one Senator holds them up. They 
are just a few examples of the broad bi-
partisan support these nominees enjoy. 
These State and local law enforce-
ment officials know how eminently 
qualified the nominees are, and they 
have told us as much. They know we 
can’t and shouldn’t waste another day 
supporting 
law 
enforcement. 
They 
know it is time for the Senate to act 
now. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider the following 
nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 660, 
661, 662, 663, 739, 740, 741, 742; that the 
Senate vote on the nominations en bloc 
without intervening action or debate; 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate; that 
any statements related to the nomina-
tions be printed in the Record; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action, and the Senate re-
sume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object because, here 
we are again, 2 weeks later and nothing 
has changed. 
The Democrats and the Department 
of Justice once again want their well- 
connected and wealthy political nomi-
nees confirmed, while the Department 
of Justice hangs out to dry four career 
law enforcement officers and threatens 
them with fiscal ruin and bankruptcy. 
The Senator from Illinois said I am 
having none of it. You are absolutely 
right; I am having none of it. 
These officers, I remind you, faced 
down 
leftwing 
street 
militias 
for 
months in Portland. They were at-
tacked with blinding lasers, ball bear-
ings, Molotov cocktails. There were ef-
forts to lock them into the courthouse 
and set it afire and burn them alive. 
Now, the Senator from Illinois keeps 
saying that my objections are com-
pletely 
unrelated—those 
were 
his 
words—or had nothing to do with these 
nominees. We have heard this now for 
weeks. I don’t know why he keeps re-
peating it. I will give my answer once 
again. I am not making objection to 
some random, unconnected agency. I 
am not upset that the Corps of Engi-
neers didn’t approve a water project in 
Arkansas. 
I am not making some doomed-to-fail 
demand like Merrick Garland should 
resign in disgrace—though he should. I 
am making a very specific point about 
this Department. 
If Merrick Garland and the Demo-
crats want their political nominees to 
be confirmed on a fast-track basis, 
then they need to protect their career 
law enforcement officers from financial 
ruin and bankruptcy. 
I have talked to these officers; the 
anxiety and the stress that this has 
created for them is real. They have re-
ceived no explanation whatsoever be-
yond ‘‘not in the interest of the United 
States.’’ That is not an explanation; 
that is a conclusion. 
Three of them haven’t heard any-
thing at all. It has been months—actu-
ally, more than a year. The Senator 
from Illinois said the Department of 
Justice often represents law enforce-
ment officers sued for actions in the 
line of duty. It is not ‘‘often rep-
resents.’’ It is ‘‘almost always rep-
resents.’’ 
I have spoken with multiple former 
Department of Justice leaders. They 
say they cannot remember a time when 
they declined to represent a law en-
forcement officer sued for actions in 
the line of duty. 
The 
Senator 
from 
Illinois, 
once 
again, waves around the idea of a pri-
vacy waiver like it is a big ‘‘gotcha’’ or 
something. I don’t have a privacy waiv-
er, but I know what these officers 
would say. They would say, We have no 
idea what the Department would tell 
us. 
So if the Senator from Illinois would 
like me to be a good bureaucrat and 
run off and get a privacy waiver, I 
guess I could do that. And then once 
they gave it to me, I would ask them, 
Why did you get denied coverage? And 
they would say, I don’t know. They 
won’t tell us anything. 
The point of the matter here is that 
career law enforcement officers are 
being hung out to dry and facing finan-
cial ruin. And they cannot get an an-
swer, and we cannot get an answer. 
Now, is it possible they engaged in 
misconduct? Sure. It happens. How-
ever, I would note, as I did last time, 
that all four officers are on unre-
stricted active duty—unrestricted ac-
tive duty. Three are in the special op-
erations group. One is in the warrant 
group. Both assignments likely to re-
sult in situations where the threat of 
violence, and even lethal violence, is 
high. 
If these officers somehow acted inap-
propriately in Portland to the point we 
can’t represent them when they are 
sued by leftwing activists, surely, they 
shouldn’t be serving high-risk war-
rants. Surely, they shouldn’t be out on 
the street in the special operations 
group. So I can only infer that is not 
the case. 
The Department of Justice won’t tell 
us anything more. They won’t tell 
these officers anything more. None of 
these facts has changed—nothing in 2 
weeks. 
The only thing we know that we 
didn’t know 2 weeks ago, actually, is 
that three of these marshals received 
an award for their service in Portland. 
This is the award that was given out 
to marshals who risked their lives in 
defense of the Federal courthouse in 
Portland. I blurred out the names to 
protect the safety of those marshals, 
but, I assure you, their names are on 
there. They received an award for their 
service. They are being sued for that 
very service, and the Department of 
Justice won’t represent them. They de-
serve answers. 
The Senator from Illinois said that 
last night the President spoke about 
funding the police after the Democrats 
spoke for years about defunding the po-
lice. Well, I have a suggestion, How 
about funding these officers’ legal de-
fenses? How about that for funding the 
police? 
Stand by the law enforcement offi-
cers who did their job and can’t now 
get an explanation for why Merrick 
Garland is not standing by them. 
And until that happens, I guess we 
can keep coming down here every week 
or 2 weeks because they deserve to be 
represented or we deserve a credible, 
fact-based explanation. 
Now, I am just one Senator. I can’t 
block these people forever. We can 
have a vote on them. We were in ses-
sion yesterday for 10 hours; we didn’t

have a single vote. On Monday night, 
we voted on late-term partial-birth 
abortion. If these are so important, we 
can have a vote on them. Or the De-
partment of Justice could just do what 
it should, which is right and moral: It 
should represent law enforcement offi-
cers who are being sued for actions in 
the line of duty, or it should give an 
explanation for why they are not. 
So I do object, and I will continue to 
object until that happens. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Right and moral? Is it 
right and moral to deny law enforce-
ment officials—the Senator is now 
leaving the floor. 
Is it right and moral to deny these 
law enforcement officials an oppor-
tunity to serve across the United 
States? 
I listened carefully, and I was wait-
ing for him to spell out—the Senator 
from Arkansas who just walked off the 
floor—his objection as to the qualifica-
tions of these law enforcement officers. 
He has none. There are none. 
These men he calls political ap-
pointees, the same thing happened 
under the Trump administration. Over 
85 of their U.S. attorneys were ap-
proved by voice vote, with no delay. 
One was held over for 1 week; that was 
it. 
And yet he has made a crusade of 
this to try to stop these individuals 
from serving in the States where they 
are desperately needed. 
The Senator from Arkansas is block-
ing the confirmation of these individ-
uals and, at the same time, calling the 
Democrats soft on law and order. Go 
figure. 
Don’t lecture me on law and order if 
you are coming to the floor to prevent 
qualified law enforcement professionals 
from helping the Justice Department 
combat violent crime. 
The reason I come to the floor and 
will continue to come to the floor is be-
cause we have a serious crime problem 
in my State and in the city of Chicago. 
I want to have the U.S. marshal there 
on the job doing everything he is sup-
posed to do to help the local and State 
law enforcement bring down the vio-
lence and the death rate. 
The Senator from Arkansas just 
doesn’t seem to understand basic law. 
The Department of Justice has an at-
torney-client privilege with these indi-
viduals as they review their cases. He 
has been unable to get a waiver so that 
he can even tell us publicly what the 
complaint might be by the Department 
of Justice from the viewpoint of those 
Federal officials. 
He can’t do it. It is good enough for 
him, if they are under review, to stop 
all other U.S. attorneys and marshals 
across the United States. 
Is this what America wants to see in 
Washington, this kind of obstruction? I 
think not. It doesn’t take political 
courage to harm an innocent person. 
And what the Senator from Arkansas 
has done is to harm individuals who 
simply want to serve America and 
make it safer. 
My Republican colleagues frequently 
claim to be the party of law and order; 
but in this matter, they are the ones 
playing politics on law enforcement. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
(Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, obvi-
ously, 
the 
images 
coming 
out 
of 
Ukraine and the heroism that we are 
seeing is inspiring people all across 
America, all across the world, and it is 
spurring governments to action, appro-
priate action. 
Just the other day, there was a world 
leader in charge of one of the world’s 
most important countries who was 
spurred to action. Despite his country 
and his government having a leftwing 
leaning, he made announcements—his-
toric, 
remarkable 
announcements— 
that not only stunned his country but 
stunned his world about the impor-
tance of a strong defense, military de-
fense, about the importance of being 
realistic about energy policies. No, I 
am not talking about President Biden, 
unfortunately. I am going to get to 
that. He missed a huge opportunity to 
do just that. I am talking about the 
world leader German Chancellor Olaf 
Scholz who in the last 2 days has said 
Germany, because of the current crisis, 
is going to almost double its defense 
budget to achieve its 2 percent GDP 
portion of national defense within the 
next year or two—a huge, stunning an-
nouncement by the Chancellor. 
A country that is addicted to Russian 
natural gas is now saying we are not 
going to have any and we are going to 
stop the Nord Stream 2 gas line—a 
huge, stunning announcement. That is 
global leadership. 
And, unfortunately, President Biden 
missed the opportunity last night at 
the State of the Union to do exactly 
the same on exactly the same issues. 
Let me talk about this a little bit 
more. I think we are starting to fully 
understand the implications as a na-
tion and as a world of what is hap-
pening in Ukraine. We have entered a 
new era of authoritarian aggression, 
led by Russia’s and China’s dictators 
who are increasingly isolated and dan-
gerous, who are driven by historical 
grievances, who are paranoid about 
their democratic neighbors and are 
willing to use military force and other 
aggressive actions to crush the citizens 
in countries like Ukraine and Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. 
These dangerous dictators—Vladimir 
Putin and Xi Jinping—are increasingly 
working together to put forward and 
implement their vision for the world: 
spheres 
of 
influence 
that 
revolve 
around them. 
If you saw and read, they joint com-
municated just a few weeks ago before 
the Beijing Olympics, Xi Jinping and 
Putin. It is a wake-up call to the world. 
It is a scary, darn document. That is 
what is happening. 
Again, we need to wake up; this ad-
ministration needs to wake up to this 
new era of authoritarian aggression be-
cause it is going to be with us, unfortu-
nately, in my view, for years, if not 
decades. 
The President had the opportunity to 
do what the Chancellor of Germany did 
in the last few days, and he didn’t. My 
view of this situation is that we need 
to face it as a country with strategic 
resolve and confidence and recognize 
that our country has extraordinary ad-
vantages, 
particularly 
relative 
to 
China and Russia. 
If we are wise enough to utilize and 
strengthen these advantages, what are 
they? They are our global network of 
allies, our lethal military, our world- 
class supplies of energy and other nat-
ural resources, our dynamic economy, 
and, most important, our democratic 
values and commitment to liberty. 
We must always remember that 
Putin and Xi Jinping’s biggest weak-
nesses and biggest vulnerabilities are 
that they fear their own people. They 
fear their own people. We need to re-
member that and exploit this vulnera-
bility in the months and years ahead. 
But what happened last night? Again, 
it was a missed opportunity because 
the 
President 
could 
have—should 
have—followed the lead of the Chan-
cellor of Germany, and he didn’t. 
He put forward a few good ideas that, 
I think, drew bipartisan support in the 
Chamber, certainly, talking about the 
brave people of Ukraine. That was 
something that all Americans are see-
ing and supportive of. Also, the Presi-
dent’s commitment to defend every 
inch of NATO territory, I think, is an 
important redline that he drew last 
night that, again, all of us support, but 
it was important for him to articulate 
it. 
Other 
topics—opioids, 
mental 
health, helping our veterans—count me 
in on those. 
But what he didn’t do was step up in 
front of the American people and, like 
the Chancellor of Germany, say: It is a 
new world, and we need to recognize it, 
and the Biden administration is going 
to make a course correction on some 
critical issues. 
What were those critical issues? Well, 
they are the exact issues that the 
Chancellor of Germany announced to 
his people. 
Yesterday, 23 Senators—we sent a 
letter to the President respectfully im-
ploring him to address the same issues 
that the Chancellor of Germany just 
did in this new era of authoritarian ag-
gression. We need a much stronger, ro-
bust military budget that can ensure 
the lethality and readiness of our

forces. If you don’t believe that, you 
are not watching what is going on in 
Ukraine. 
What we don’t need is another Biden 
budget like he put forward last year 
that increases, by double digits, the 
budgets 
of 
literally 
every 
Federal 
Agency in the Government of the 
United States, with the exception of 
two: Homeland Security and the De-
partment of Defense. 
The Biden budget last year cut those, 
and I guarantee you the dictators in 
Beijing and the dictator in Moscow no-
ticed. You can’t do that. He didn’t even 
mention it last night—didn’t even men-
tion it last night. And I guarantee you 
the dictators in Moscow and Beijing 
noticed and so did our European allies, 
which is, again, why what the Chan-
cellor of Germany did was so extraor-
dinary. He announced a budget dou-
bling the budget of the German mili-
tary—stunning. 
But the other area that we suggested 
strongly to the President of the United 
States to address to the American peo-
ple in this new era of authoritarian ag-
gression is energy. 
In our letter to the President yester-
day, we respectfully called out the 
President and said: With respect, Mr. 
President, you recently told the Amer-
ican people in a press conference that 
your administration was using ‘‘every 
tool at our disposal to protect Amer-
ican families and businesses’’ from ris-
ing energy crisis, but that is not true. 
It is not true, and the whole world 
knows it. Heck, the administration 
knows it. 
So we suggested 12 actions that the 
President of the United States could 
take and announce at the State of the 
Union that would help us with regard 
to energy: bring down costs, put Amer-
ican energy workers back to work, and 
not let Putin blackmail European al-
lies of ours with energy and continue 
to use it as a weapon. 
We asked for a course correction on 
the Biden administration’s energy poli-
cies, which, from day 1, have focused 
on restricting, delaying, and, indeed, 
killing the production of American oil 
and gas. 
All of this has had the predictable re-
sult, the catastrophic result of driving 
up energy prices at the pump and in 
home heating for American citizens— 
enormous increases, hurting working 
families, 
increasing 
pink 
slips 
for 
American energy workers like those in 
my State, the great State of Alaska, 
and again in the current crisis, signifi-
cantly empowering our adversaries, es-
pecially Vladimir Putin, who has used 
energy as a weapon against our allies 
for decades. 
So I am not going to go into each one 
of the topics or the actions that we 
suggested the President of the United 
States take, with the exception of one 
because it is so apparent that we need 
to do it and so apparent that the Presi-
dent should have announced it last 
night that I want to just briefly men-
tion it again here. 
We called on—and today in a press 
conference many of us called on—many 
Republicans and some Democratic Sen-
ators now have called on the Biden ad-
ministration to undertake sanctions 
and 
an 
embargo 
against 
Vladimir 
Putin’s strongest weapon, his export of 
natural gas and oil. 
Now, many people are saying: Well, 
you can’t do that as it relates to our 
European allies. What we are saying is, 
we understand there are challenges 
there. We are not talking about Eu-
rope. We are talking about the United 
States of America. 
I want you to understand these num-
bers. Right now, we are buying an aver-
age of almost 700,000 barrels a day of 
Russian oil. By the way, that number 
has increased 35 percent—actually over 
35 percent during President Biden’s 
first term. At the same time, the Biden 
administration is going to States like 
mine and saying, We are going to try 
to shut down Alaskan oil production. 
Does anyone in America, does anyone 
in the U.S. Senate, does anyone in the 
Biden administration think that that 
makes sense—increase imports of Rus-
sian oil to the United States while 
shutting down the production of Amer-
ican energy? 
They are doing it. We all know they 
are doing it. Heck, they know they are 
doing it. It makes no sense. 
In the last year, imports from the 
United States paid for that went 
back—oil imports of Russian oil, paid 
for in the United States going back to 
Russia—put $17 billion into Putin’s war 
chest—$17 billion. 
So a number of us—like I said, Re-
publican and now Democratic Sen-
ators—have been saying: This is nuts. 
We are trying to sanction Putin. We 
are trying to isolate Russia from the 
global economy, and there is this giant 
loophole, and it is coming right to the 
United States. We are paying for hun-
dreds of thousands of barrels a day of 
Russian oil going back to Putin, and 
they are still trying to shut down 
American energy production. Come on. 
Of course, some of this is driven by 
the far left that the Biden administra-
tion listens way too much to. Come on, 
Mr. President, my colleagues here, this 
is insane, and everybody knows it. Ev-
erybody knows it. 
What are we doing right now? We are 
subsidizing this war. We are sub-
sidizing—by the importation of 7,000 
barrels a day of Russian oil in the 
United 
States, 
we 
are 
subsidizing 
Putin’s war on Ukrainians. 
By the way, our friends in Canada, 
they just announced that they are not 
going to import any more Russian oil. 
Prime Minister Trudeau, well done, sir. 
By the way, had the Keystone Pipe-
line not been killed by the President of 
the United States a little over 12 
months ago, we would have up to 
700,000 barrels of oil from Canada. I 
would much rather be getting oil from 
Canada than Russia right now. 
If you think that this is an issue that 
is not impacting Ukraine, here is what 
the Foreign Minister of Ukraine re-
cently said about this topic: 
We insist on a full embargo for Russian oil 
and gas around the world. Buying Russian oil 
and gas right now means paying for the mur-
der of Ukrainian men, women and children. 
That is the Foreign Minister of 
Ukraine. What he is asking for is some-
thing we can easily do—block any more 
Russian oil, Russian natural gas com-
ing into the United States of America. 
People say: Well, where would we get 
it, then? I will tell you where we would 
get it. We would get it from the United 
States of America. 
The only thing that the President 
mentioned last night on this topic in a 
glancing manner—to be honest, it was 
a lame glancing manner. It was almost 
a pathetic attempt to just barely rec-
ognize that this giant issue had to be 
touched upon. He said we are going to 
briefly release oil out of the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. We are not going 
to produce more, which we could. We 
are just going to release a little more 
oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. 
Here is my answer to that: Mr. Presi-
dent, there is a much better Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve than the one you 
referenced last night. It is called the 
great State of Alaska. That is Amer-
ica’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And 
you need to let us, as your fellow 
Americans, help our fellow citizens and 
the rest of the world by producing. So 
it was a missed opportunity last night. 
We have world leaders who, right 
now, the Prime Minister of Canada on 
the imports of Russian oil, the Chan-
cellor of Germany on significantly rec-
ognizing the new era in which we are 
all in, saying: I have got to be serious 
about national defense and our mili-
tary, and I have got to be serious about 
energy. 
We had respectfully asked the Presi-
dent of the United States last night in 
the State of the Union to do just the 
same—just the same. The American 
people were watching, and he had an 
opportunity to talk about the con-
sequences, long term, of this new era of 
authoritarian aggression and say: ‘‘And 
I am going to make some course cor-
rections as the President of this admin-
istration because it is going to be what

H.R. 3076 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
about to file cloture on the postal re-
form bill, so let me say a few words 
about that. So this week the Senate 
has kept making progress toward our 
goal of passing and ultimately enacting 
the largest bill to support the U.S. 
Postal Service in a long, long time. 
This is a bipartisan bill, long overdue 
and far-reaching in how it will place 
our post office on secure footing for the 
future. 
Democrats have spent the day work-
ing with Republicans on a list of 
amendments that they want to hold 
with regard to this bill, and these nego-
tiations are ongoing. 
So while we work on an agreement— 
and to keep the process moving—I will 
be filing cloture so that we can take 
the next steps toward the final passage. 
It is my hope that we can arrive at 
an agreement tomorrow and finish this 
bill before the weekend. There is every 
reason in the world to do so. 
At the end of the day, the vast ma-
jority of Democrats and Republicans 
want to see this bill sent to the Presi-
dent’s desk quickly. 
I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for their contin-
ued work, especially Chairman PETERS. 
This postal reform bill has been a 
long time coming, and when passed it 
will ensure that the tens of millions of 
Americans who rely on the post office 
every single day for medicine, Social 
Security, checks, other goods, they can 
be sure that the post office remains in 
good hands and is strengthened. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send 
a cloture motion to the desk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clo-
ture motion having been presented 
under rule XXII, the Chair directs the 
clerk to read the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on Calendar 
No. 273, H.R. 3076, a bill to provide stability

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations en 
bloc: Calendar Nos. 441, 445, 458; that 
the Senate vote on the nominations en 
bloc without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that any statements related to 
the nominations be printed in the 
RECORD; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action, 
and the Senate resume legislative ses-
sion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
Claire A. Pierangelo, of California, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, Class of Minister-Counselor, to 
be 
Ambassador 
Extraordinary 
and

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
a reserve fund in section 3003 to allow 
the chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget to revise budget aggregates and 
committee allocations for legislation 
that would not increase the deficit over 
the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031. 
The Senate is considering H.R. 3076, 
the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022, 
which meets the condition of not in-
creasing the deficit over the relevant 
10-year period. As such, I am filing a 
revision to the aggregates and com-
mittee allocations under the budget 
resolution, which were last revised on 
February 8. Specifically, the Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that the 
bill would increase on-budget direct 
spending by $430 million over 5 years 
but decrease it by $73 million over 10 
years. 
I am also refiling two tables that I 
previously filed on February 8 to cor-
rect the amounts of budget authority 
allowable for fiscal year 2022. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

HONORING SERGEANT MARLENE 
R. RITTMANIC 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable life of Sergeant Marlene R. 
Rittmanic, a 21-year veteran of law en-
forcement who was fatally shot and 
passed away on December 30, 2021, 
while serving in the line of duty. Ser-
geant Rittmanic started her remark-
able career at the Iroquois County 
Sheriff’s Police Department, serving 7 
years before transferring to the Brad-
ley Police Department in 2007, for the 
last 14 years. 
Throughout her years of protecting 
and serving, Sergeant Rittmanic re-
ceived the Officer of the Year Award 
for Kankakee County and countless 
letters of commendation for her service 
to the community. She will be remem-
bered by her colleagues as a model offi-
cer and someone who looked forward to 
making memories with her fellow offi-
cers as the department’s photographer, 
posting inspirational and team-build-
ing photographs of the officers and the 
community. 
Sergeant Rittmanic was not only a 
dedicated law enforcement officer, but 
also a devoted wife and citizen who was 
loved and respected in her community. 
Sergeant Rittmanic served in the U.S. 
Army and was a proud disabled vet-
eran. Sergeant Rittmanic, a poet, also 
penned the prophetic poem, ‘‘The Color 
We Bleed is That of Deep Blue,’’ in 2001. 
Sergeant Rittmanic was tragically 
killed in the line of duty while ful-
filling her oath to serve and protect 
the people of the Village of Bradley, IL, 
and I am grateful for her years of serv-
ice. She leaves behind her wife, Lyn, 
and their 2 rescue dogs, Trigger and 
Abeline. May her service, sacrifice, and 
kind spirit serve as an inspiration to us 
all.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
NAVAL 
SUR-
FACE WARFARE CENTER INDIAN 
HEAD DIVISION 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the Naval Surface 
Warfare Center at Indian Head, MD. 
They were recognized as a winner in 
the 2022 Federal Laboratory Consor-
tium National Awards Program, also 
known as the FLC. The FLC Awards 
Program annually recognizes Federal 
laboratories and their industry part-
ners for outstanding technology trans-
fer achievements. 
The Excellence in Technology Trans-
fer Award recognizes employees of FLC 
member laboratories and non-labora-
tory staff who have accomplished out-
standing work in the process of trans-
ferring federally developed technology. 
Indian Head received the award for 
its efforts in developing Silent Spring, 
a technology that desensitizes home-
made explosives or HMEs. HMEs are 
extremely sensitive and unpredictable; 
a stray spark, a change in temperature, 
exposure to sunlight, or even an acci-
dental bump can set them off. 
Silent Spring shields volatile explo-
sive materials from these potential 
triggers. This allows explosive ord-
nance disposal and law enforcement 
personnel to more safely move the ex-
plosive materials, while preserving fo-
rensic evidence and minimizing dam-
age to existing infrastructure. 
Silent Spring is now available com-
mercially and is approved within the 
Department of Defense to address the 
highest priority EOD threats. The part-
nership has already provided hundreds 
of product units to Department of De-
fense 
explosive 
ordinance 
disposal 
users for demonstration and training 
and will soon do the same for the civil-
ian public safety and law enforcement 
communities. 
‘‘This collaboration is one of many 
we have across the command that de-
liver innovative technologies to the 
warfighter,’’ said NSWC IHD com-
manding officer Capt. Eric Correll. 
‘‘The faster we can get new innovative 
products to our warfighters and our 
first responder partners, the better.’’ 
This emphasizes the need to invest in 
energetics experts. The need for this 
experience is more apparent than ever. 
As foreign threats emerge, the bright 
minds at Indian Head have been able to 
meet and exceed these threats. 
Indian Head does not just explore the 
detection of explosive devices. They 
also look at ways to enhance the 
United States’ capabilities to deter for-
eign aggressors. 
Indian Head is a premier facility that 
has developed ejection seats for our pi-
lots and have developed materials that 
ensure that our military has the best 
and sharpest tools to deter our adver-
saries and keep the people of this coun-
try safe. 
Indian Head is an unsung hero that 
has tirelessly worked to ensure our na-
tional security and has humbly pro-
vided to this country for over a hun-
dred years. We must recognize the im-
portance of energetics research in this 
country. Other countries are recog-
nizing this, and we cannot ignore this. 
We need to continue to invest in this 
research and development, these are 
vital capabilities that keep our aggres-
sors at bay. 
I want to recognize and thank Indian 
Head for all of their contributions to 
the security of our country and for this 
great achievement.∑

itself as one of the premier dog train-
ing companies in the Nation. Following 
their combined 20 years of Active-Duty 
service in the U.S. Air Force, veteran 
owners Amy and Justin Pishner real-
ized their lifelong dream of training 
dogs and opened Valor K9 Academy. 
Thanks to Amy and Justin’s passion 
for training dogs and dedication to pro-
viding individualized service for each 
client, Valor K9 Academy has gained 
national recognition since its founding 
in 2014. What started as a two-person 
company has grown sixfold, with loca-
tions in Idaho, Washington, and Ten-
nessee. The success of Valor K9 Acad-
emy has also allowed Amy and Justin 
to open a second business, Valor Pro-
tection Dogs, which they operate out of 
Horseshoe Bend. 
In addition to developing lifelong re-
lationships with its canine clients, 
Valor K9 Academy has immersed itself 
in the community. The business rou-
tinely donates proceeds to support 
local rescues and Idaho veterans in 
need. Thanks to its efforts, Valor K9 
Academy is a beacon of entrepreneurial 
and philanthropic spirit for all of Idaho 
to behold. 
Congratulations to Amy, Justin, and 
all of the employees at Valor K9 Acad-
emy for being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for March 
2022. Thank you for your service to our 
Nation, and thank you for serving 
Idaho as small business owners and en-
trepreneurs. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13660 OF MARCH 6, 2014, WITH RE-
SPECT TO UKRAINE—PM 22 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, which was 
expanded in scope in Executive Order 
13661 of March 16, 2014, Executive Order 
13662 of March 20, 2014, and Executive 
Order 14065 of February 21, 2022, and 
under which additional steps were 
taken in Executive Order 13685 of De-
cember 19, 2014 and Executive Order 
13849 of September 20, 2018, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond March 6, 2022. 
The actions and policies of persons 
that undermine democratic processes 
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten 
its 
peace, 
security, 
stability, 
sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity; and 
contribute to the misappropriation of 
its assets, as well as the actions and 
policies of the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation, including its pur-
ported annexation of Crimea, its use of 
force in Ukraine, and its purported rec-
ognition of the so-called Donetsk Peo-
ple’s Republic or Luhansk People’s Re-
public regions of Ukraine, continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13660 
with respect to Ukraine.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
MARKEY, and Ms. DUCKWORTH): 
S. 3726. A bill to address research on, 
and improve access to, supportive serv-
ices for individuals with long COVID; 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, some 
studies have shown that upwards of 50 
percent of people who have had COVID– 
19 will experience some form of post- 
acute sequelae of COVID–19 infection 
PASC, 6 months after infection, includ-
ing neurological, cardiovascular, res-
piratory, and mental health symptoms. 
To date, there have been over 78 mil-
lion cases of COVID–19 in the United 
State and an untold number who were 
infected but did not have access to 
testing to confirm their diagnosis. 
PASC, 
commonly 
known 
as 
long 
COVID, is a growing public health cri-
sis in this country. I myself have expe-
rienced these symptoms and know 
firsthand the importance of increasing 
our understanding of the causes and 
possible treatments for long COVID. 
Given the disproportionate impact of 
COVID–19 on communities of color, 
persons with disabilities, seniors, and 
first responders, we must ensure that 
there is equity in our work to address 
the needs of individuals with long 
COVID. 
That 
is 
why 
Senators 
Markey, 
Duckworth, and I are introducing the 
Comprehensive Access to Resources 
and Education for Long COVID Act, or 
the CARE for Long COVID Act, legisla-
tion that would expand our knowledge 
of the symptoms of long COVID, bar-
riers to care, and disparities in diag-
nosis and treatment. This bill would 
synthesize data on patients’ experience 
with long COVID, compiling informa-
tion crucial for further research and 
improved policy and treatment. Addi-
tionally, this bill would encourage re-
search and recommendations around 
the health system’s response to long 
COVID, with an emphasis on reducing 
disparities in communities that have 
experienced 
disproportionate 
harm 
during the pandemic. To ensure action-
able research, this bill would require 
dissemination of findings to healthcare 
providers, patients, Federal Agencies, 
and other key stakeholders in a man-
ner that is accessible. 
This bill would also ensure that 
adults and children with long COVID 
have the resources they need to navi-
gate workplaces and schools, building 
on efforts by the Biden administration 
to recognize long COVID as a dis-
ability. Specifically, this bill would fa-
cilitate interagency coordination to 
educate the public on the impact of 
long COVID and the rights associated 
with employment, disability status, 
and education for individuals with long 
COVID. To ensure that individuals 
with long COVID can access existing 
resources, this bill would fund grants 
for 
medical-legal 
partnerships 
and 
other 
collaborations 
between 
healthcare providers, community-based 
organizations, and legal services. Re-
cipients would be able to use grant 
funds to support cooperative efforts, 
provide technical assistance, or hire 
staff in order to help individuals with 
long COVID access healthcare, social 
services, or legal services. 
Robust response to the long COVID 
crisis will continue our efforts to ad-
dress the equity and well-being of his-
torically marginalized communities. 
We cannot afford to let the needs of in-
dividuals with long COVID go unmet 
any longer. I urge my colleagues to 
support the passage of the CARE for 
Long COVID Act so that we can take 
necessary steps towards meeting the 
needs of diverse communities with long 
COVID.

529—SUP-
PORTING A DEMOCRATIC, PLU-
RALISTIC, 
AND 
PROSPEROUS 
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA ON 
THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
DECLARATION 
OF 
INDEPEND-
ENCE 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. 
JOHNSON, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. 
WICKER, and Mr. PETERS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 529 
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina has his-
torically been a pluralistic society influ-
enced by and composed of a diverse set of re-
ligions, cultures, and ethnicities; 
Whereas, on March 3, 1992, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina declared independence, and on 
April 7, 1992, the United States recognized 
Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent 
state; 
Whereas more than 100,000 people died and 
2,000,000 more were displaced in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995; 
Whereas the United States, alongside the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
played a crucial role in ending the war in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and brokering the 
General Framework Agreement for Bosnia 
and Herzegovina (also known as the ‘‘Dayton 
Agreement’’ and the ‘‘Dayton Accords’’) in 
November 1995; 
Whereas the Dayton Accords ended the 
war, affirmed the territorial integrity and 
political 
independence 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, established the Federation of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, 
and two tiers of government at the state, en-
tity, district, canton, and municipal levels, 
installed the NATO Stabilization Force 
(SFOR) as an international interim peace-
keeping force, and created the Office of the 
High 
Representative 
for 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina (OHR) to oversee civilian imple-
mentation of the accords; 
Whereas, since the Dayton Accords were 
signed, the Government and people of Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
have 
made 
important 
strides toward re-building a peaceful society 
based on democracy, human rights, the rule 
of law, and a free-market economy; 
Whereas, in 2004, the United Nations Secu-
rity Council adopted United Nations Secu-
rity Council Resolution 1575 authorizing a 
multinational stabilization force led by the 
European Union (EUFOR) as the legal suc-
cessor to SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 
Whereas, in 2008, the Peace Implementa-
tion Council Steering Board set out the re-
quirements that need to be met prior to the 
closure of the OHR in the 5+2 Agenda; 
Whereas, since 2009 and the case of Sejdic´- 
Finci, the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) has issued judgments concerning 
ethnic- and territory-based discrimination in 
the elections of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
requiring reforms, which have yet to be im-
plemented; 
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina was in-
vited to join a NATO Membership Action 
Plan in 2010, and Bosnia and Herzegovina 
submitted its first Reform Program to NATO 
in 2019; 
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina formally 
applied for European Union membership on 
February 15, 2016; 
Whereas, on May 29, 2019, the European 
Union adopted a roadmap to membership for 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, outlining needed re-
forms in the areas of democracy, the rule of

law, fundamental rights, and public adminis-
tration; 
Whereas the United States and the Euro-
pean Union have called on Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to implement election and tar-
geted constitutional reforms to ensure broad 
participation in the 2022 general election in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and to comply with 
the Sejdic´-Finci judgments from the ECHR; 
Whereas, on October 20, 2021, the United 
States and the European Union issued a joint 
statement supporting the territorial integ-
rity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and calling 
‘‘on all parties to respect and protect state 
institutions, resume constructive dialogue, 
and take steps to advance progress on the EU 
integration path—including on relevant re-
forms’’; 
Whereas some politicians in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and other countries in the re-
gion 
continue 
to 
make 
statements 
downplaying or denying the 1995 Srebrenica 
genocide; 
Whereas Milorad Dodik, a Bosnian Serb 
member of the Presidency of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, has hampered reconciliation ef-
forts through genocide denial, engaged in 
proactive and destabilizing security maneu-
vers, threatened to withdraw Republika 
Srpska from state-level institutions, includ-
ing the judiciary, the security services, the 
Indirect Tax Authority, and the armed forces 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and called for the 
dissolution of the OHR; 
Whereas, on December 10, 2021, the par-
liament of Republika Srpska voted in favor 
of denying the constitutional and legitimate 
authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 
areas of taxation, justice, and security and 
defense; 
Whereas the United States has imposed 
sanctions on Milorad Dodik pursuant to Ex-
ecutive Order 13304 (68 Fed. Reg. 32313; relat-
ing to the Termination of Emergencies With 
Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of 
Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001) and 
Executive Order 14033 (86 Fed. Reg. 31079; re-
lating to Blocking Property and Suspending 
Entry Into the United States of Certain Per-
sons Contributing to the Destabilizing Situa-
tion in the Western Balkans) for obstructing 
the Dayton Accords and corruption; 
Whereas, on January 9, 2022, Milorad Dodik 
presided over commemorations of an uncon-
stitutional holiday, Republika Srpska Day, 
which coincided with the day Bosnian Serbs 
declared their own state and ignited four 
years of war and bloodshed; 
Whereas international financial institu-
tions such as the International Monetary 
Foundation have warned that withdrawal 
from the Indirect Tax Authority would crip-
ple the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina; 
Whereas, in 2020, the economy of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina contracted by an estimated 
4.3 percent, and the youth unemployment 
rate rose to 33.6 percent, disrupting a five- 
year trend of decline in part due to the 
rampant 
corruption 
that 
remains 
unaddressed; and 
Whereas at least 400,000 citizens of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina have emigrated from Bosnia 
and Herzegovina over the past 8 years: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates Bosnia and Herzegovina 
on the 30th anniversary of its declaration of 
independence; 
(2) reaffirms strong and longstanding bi-
partisan support for Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
and continues to believe that peace and sta-
bility in Bosnia and Herzegovina is integral 
to the peace and stability of Europe as a 
whole; 
(3) calls on all parties to uphold the spirit 
of unity enshrined in the Dayton Accords 
and to redouble their efforts to enact elec-
toral and targeted constitutional reforms 
prior to the 2022 general election in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina; 
(4) calls on the members of the Presidency 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina to recognize their 
critical role in preserving stability and to 
work together in the best interests of their 
constituents as part of a sovereign and inde-
pendent Bosnia and Herzegovina within its 
internationally recognized borders; 
(5) encourages the Government of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to continue pursuing mem-
bership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation and the European Union and urges the 
European Union to increase its efforts, co-
operation, and assistance to swiftly advance 
the accession process; 
(6) calls on the President to prioritize ef-
forts to combat political corruption, demo-
cratic backsliding, unemployment, and brain 
drain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in par-
ticular, by focusing on youth engagement; 
(7) commends the continued efforts of the 
Office of the High Representative (OHR) to 
advance reforms, reaffirms the authority of 
the OHR as articulated in the Dayton Ac-
cords, and calls on members of the Peace and 
Implementation Council to provide their full 
support to the OHR and advancement of the 
5+2 Agenda; 
(8) calls on the President to develop an in-
clusive and comprehensive strategy for Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, in coordination with 
Bosnian and Herzegovinian civil society and 
the European Union, and to increase engage-
ment with minority groups in an effort to 
hear from a diverse cross-section of citizens 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, inclusive of all 
ethnic, political, or religious affiliations; 
(9) encourages the United Nations and its 
member states to continue to support the 
EUFOR-Althea stabilization force and to re-
view the current levels of the force in the 
face of challenges to the integrity of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina; 
(10) encourages the United States to con-
sider additional steps to support security 
and stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and to support EUFOR; 
(11) condemns individuals who are actively 
seeking to undermine the security, stability, 
and territorial integrity of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and urges the President and Eu-
ropean allies of the United States to hold 
such individuals accountable for their ac-
tions, including through the use of sanctions 
where appropriate; 
(12) condemns the inflammatory rhetoric 
of politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
others in the region who deny the severity or 
perpetration of war crimes and genocide in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina; 
(13) condemns politicians in Bosnian and 
Herzegovina and the region who— 
(A) persist in rampant corruption for per-
sonal enrichment at the cost of the pros-
perity 
of 
the 
citizens 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina; and 
(B) prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from 
adopting the reforms necessary to secure 
membership in the European Union and the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and 
(14) emphasizes that the United States 
Government will continue to support the 
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their 
quest to build a unified, pluralistic, pros-
perous, and peaceful state.

Whereas critical analysis and effective

SEC. ll02. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to reduce the dependency of allies and 
partners of the United States on Russian en-
ergy resources, especially natural gas, in 
order for those countries to achieve lasting 
and dependable energy security; 
(2) to condemn the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation for, and to deter that gov-
ernment from, using its energy resources as 
a geopolitical weapon to coerce, intimidate, 
and influence other countries; 
(3) to improve energy security in Europe 
by increasing access to diverse, reliable, and 
affordable energy; 
(4) to promote energy security in Europe

other allies of the United States to develop 
liberalized energy markets that provide di-
versified 
energy 
sources, 
suppliers, 
and 
routes; 
(5) to continue to strongly oppose the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline based on its detrimental 
effects on the energy security of the Euro-
pean Union and the economy of Ukraine and

States to encourage NATO member coun-
tries, including the United States, to work 
together to achieve energy security for those 
countries and countries in Europe and Eur-
asia that are partners of NATO. 
SEC. ll04. TRANSATLANTIC ENERGY STRATEGY.

E201 
March 2, 2022 
IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF 
COULSON TOUGH 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the distinguished life and public service 
of my dear friend Mr. Coulson Tough. He 
dedicated his life to improving his community 
and country and ushered an idea of The 
Woodlands into one of the top places to live 
in the country. 
At age 17, Coulson eagerly enlisted in the 
Army Air Corps, now known as the Air Force, 
where he served in Germany and France. 
After returning home, he attended the Univer-
sity of Michigan where he earned his bach-
elor’s degree in Architecture and met his ador-
ing wife Colleen Bohn. Coulson and Colleen 
then headed west to California to start their 
life together, and became parents to two won-
derful children, Bruce and Cindy. 
Mr. Tough spent the first 16 years of his ca-
reer in architecture in California, where he de-
signed a barn remodel for future president 
Ronald Reagan. In 1968, Coulson made the 
courageous decision to move his family to 
Texas, where he served as the Vice President 
of Facilities and Operations at the University 
of Houston. This is where Mr. Tough met 
George Mitchell, the founder of The Wood-
lands, and together, they created a thriving 
community. 
Mr. Tough showcased his passion for archi-
tecture and, while working alongside Mr. 
Mitchell, as Vice President of Building Devel-
opment for The Woodlands, helped bring his 
vision of a master planned community to life. 
The leadership and service of these two men 
undoubtedly made The Woodlands into what it 
is today. 
Around The Woodlands, citizens are re-
minded of Coulson’s legacy. He helped build 
130 buildings and pioneered the procurement 
of public art across the community. His favor-
ite art piece was a sculpture of a reclining boy 
termed ‘‘The Dreamer,’’ which resides at the 
intersection of West Panther Creek Drive and 
The Woodlands Parkway. 
Mr. Tough’s ideas live beyond his work as 
an architect. His dedication to serving his 
community was evident through his involve-
ment in the Rotary Club, The Woodlands 
Community Presbyterian Church, the Conroe 
ISD Board, and The Woodlands Chamber of 
Commerce, where he hired me as President. 
In addition to serving as a Trustee on the 
Conroe ISD Board, he was honored to have a 
school in The Woodlands named after him, 
Coulson Tough Elementary. 
Mr. Tough’s most recent project was to de-
sign and construct the Mitchell Physics Build-
ing and the Institute for Fundamental Physics 
and Astronomy at Texas A&M University. 
Coulson retired at the age of 77, but continued 
consulting on projects both in The Woodlands 
and Galveston, Texas. 
While we mourn with the Tough family, we 
also celebrate the life, service, and legacy that 
will live throughout our community for years to 
come. I am proud to join Mr. Tough’s family, 
friends, and the entire Woodland’s community 
in honoring his life and devotion to public serv-
ice. May God bless Coulson Tough.

HONORING KENESHA LEWIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious young lady, Mrs. Kenesha Lewis. 
Kenesha has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
achieve success. 
With over 10 years of restaurant manage-
ment experience, Kenesha has always had a 
love of serving people with excellence, bring-
ing smiles to their faces. 
Known as the ‘‘fruit lady’’ in her family for 
many years because of her love for fruit, 
Kenesha felt led in December 2018 to start 
creating beautiful fruit arrangements. She 
worked throughout the night, knowing she was 
being purposely driven because she was so 
filled with joy. After showcasing her arrange-
ments on social media and seeing the positive 
and enthusiastic responses, Kenesha, with her 
husband Jason, birthed Kay’s Kute Fruit, offer-
ing gorgeous fruit arrangements for all occa-
sions, as well as their all-natural smoothies. 
‘‘Being a young woman here in the Delta, 
it’s not a lot of health options,’’ Kenesha says. 
‘‘It’s not a lot of places you can go and get a 
healthy wrap and then you can go in the same 
place and have nice service.’’ 
Kenesha got the idea to start a business 
after her husband kept getting on her case for 
eating too much sugar. ‘‘I lost two teeth and 
he said, ‘wait a minute now, you’re too young 
to be losing these teeth.’ ’’ she recalls, laugh-
ing. ‘‘[he said] ‘Let’s figure this out.’ So, we 
created smoothies together and I said, okay, 
this is good for me.’’ 
It turns out, it was also good for business. 
Lewis exceeded her projected annual sales in 
her first month after opening. Growing up, she 
says people in her community were good en-
trepreneurs, but they usually worked out of 
their homes. Her mom is a stylist, and her dad 
ran a house painting business. 
Being a black woman, now with a storefront 
downtown, she sees herself as a role model. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Kenesha Lewis for the 
outstanding work and accomplishments she 
has made thus far.

TRIBUTE TO JAY MYRON 
JACKMAN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of a dear friend and 
great man, Jay Jackman, who died of Parkin-
son’s disease on January 17, 2022. 
Jay Jackman was born in New York City in 
1939 and raised in Brooklyn where his father 
instilled in him a love of political activism and 
a passion for justice. Jay was a graduate of 
Harvard College and the Columbia Medical 
School, did his medical residency at Stanford 
University, and was a graduate of the Has-
tings School of Law. He dedicated both his 
medical and legal careers to justice for all. 
After his residency in psychiatry, Jay ran a 
drug treatment program in San Francisco, 
then moved to Hawaii. Upon his return to Cali-
fornia, he worked in forensic psychiatry and 
psychiatry at Stanford University. He also 
served on the Foothill-DeAnza College Board 
for five years and was an advisor to the 
Democratic Clubs at Stanford. He served as a 
liaison from Stanford to the Democratic Party 
and was one of the early members of the Pe-
ninsula Democratic Coalition. He was a key 
member of the Santa Clara County Central 
Committee and the California Central Com-
mittee of the Democratic Party. After going to 
law school at age 60, he served as an expert 
witness in more than 250 capital cases, where 
he often tried to help prisoners escape the 
death penalty. 
Jay leaves his beloved wife, Myra Strober, 
his children Tenaya, Rashi and Jason, and his 
stepchildren Jason and Liz. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
of this good and great man and in extending 
our most sincere condolences to Myra and his 
entire family. Jay Jackman bettered our coun-
try every day of his life, and was a special 
blessing to me and countless others.

HIGH 
SCHOOL NAVY JUNIOR ROTC CA-
DETS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of the Chambers-
burg Area Senior High School Navy Junior 
Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) 
program. 
Under the leadership of Cadet Lieutenant 
Commander Ethan Baker, and under the guid-
ance of Commander Bruce Apgar and Master 
Sergeant Louise Montney, the Chambersburg 
Area Senior High School Trojan Cadets won 
multiple portions of the Academic, Fitness and 
Drill Competition held at Sterling High School 
in Camden, New Jersey this February. 
The Varsity Cadets finished first overall in 
the competition after winning the Academics, 
Personnel Inspection, Color Guard and Armed 
Regulation Drill portions of the competition. 
I am confident that the determination, atten-
tion to detail, and discipline that served these 
students so well in competition will continue to 
lead them to success in their academic and 
future endeavors. 
It is inspiring to see our community’s youth 
commit themselves to developing as leaders, 
and regardless of whether they find them-
selves serving our nation in uniform one day, 
I am incredibly proud of the work that the 
Chambersburg Area Senior High School 
NJROTC cadets done this past year, and I 
wish them every continued success.

HONORING LEFLORE COUNTY HIGH 
SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
team, Leflore County High School (LCHS) 
football team. 
LCHS football team has had a tremendous 
football season. They ended their 2021 sea-
son with an 10–4 record. 
On November 26, 2021, LCHS defeated 
Charleston High School. 24–22, in the North 
State 2A championship game in Charleston to 
advance to the state title game. On December 
4, 2021, the Tigers lost to Scott Central, 72– 
24, in Hattiesburg. 
Despite their loss, Leflore County celebrated 
them. LCHS is the district’s only high school to 
reach the state championship in football since 
the Greenwood and Leflore County districts 
merged in 2019. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the remarkable Leflore County 
High School Team for their commitment and 
hard work. 
CONGRATULATING ELIZABETH 
SAVAGE 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate Elizabeth ‘Liz’ Savage, a career at-
torney in the Disability Rights Section of the 
Civil Rights Division (CRD) at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice, who received the Maceo W. 
Hubbard Award in December. The Division’s 
highest award, it recognizes her exceptional 
work as an expert in disability rights law and 
her commitment to educating Americans with 
disabilities on how to access reasonable ac-
commodations guaranteed under law. The law 
referenced, of course, is the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), which I was proud to 
sponsor and helps shepherd to enactment in 
1990. 
I’ve known Liz Savage for many years, and 
during the time that I was leading efforts to 
pass the ADA, she was working at the Epi-
lepsy Foundation. Liz had been working with 
our former Majority Whip Tony Coelho, long a 
champion for disability rights, who served on 
the Epilepsy Foundation’s board at the time. 
Tony, of course, was the original author of the 
ADA, and I was honored that he asked me to 
take charge of it after he left the House. When 
I did, I was grateful for Liz’s support and as-
sistance, as she helped lead grassroots orga-
nizing and outreach to Members of Congress 
to educate the public and policymakers about 
what the ADA would achieve and how impor-
tant it would be to promoting equality, access, 
independence, and opportunity for those living 
with disabilities. She worked hard to build a 
coalition among national disability, civil rights, 
religious, and civic organizations in support of 
the ADA’s enactment. 
In addition to the ADA, Liz had a profound 
impact on a number of pieces of federal legis-
lation during her time at the Epilepsy Founda-
tion. These included the Family and Medical 
Leave Act, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, 
and Fair Housing Act amendments. Liz served 
as a tireless advocate in all of those efforts to 
ensure that the voices of people whose lived 
experience included dealing with a disability 
were included when policies were developed 
and adopted. 
For more than three decades, Liz has con-
tinued to fight for the rights and equality of 
people with disabilities. Over the past ten 
years, she has been working in the Justice 
Department’s Disability Rights Section, and 
the Maceo W. Hubbard Award she received in 
December is testament to her success and 
achievement in that role. I join in congratu-
lating her and thanking her for the service and 
many contributions she has made and con-
tinues to make for her country and for Ameri-
cans with disabilities. I hope my colleagues 
will join in congratulating Liz Savage as well. 
ENSURING WE ARE PREPARED 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, as climate 
change accelerates, it is more important than 
ever that we put our infrastructure in good 
working order, hardened against the powerful 
typhoons and other natural disasters that are 
associated with a warming planet. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that will 
ensure we have an adequate workforce in the 
Northern Mariana Islands to finish repairs from 
the typhoons that struck our islands in recent 
years and to build new infrastructure able to 
withstand future storms. 
Congress made the decision that additional 
foreign workers would be needed for this pur-
pose, when we passed the FY20 omnibus ap-
propriation, U.S. Public Law 116–94. Title IX 
provided up to 3,000 permits for Common-
wealth-only Transitional Workers (CW–1s) 
specifically for disaster-related construction 
projects during fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022. 
In the succeeding years, however, more 
funding has become available—for the Mari-
anas public water in the American Rescue 
Plan Act, for better roads in the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, for solid waste sys-
tems on the islands of Rota and Tinian in the 
2019 Disaster Relief Act—and those projects 
will all require skilled labor. 
Those projects will also occur in a time-
frame beyond 2022. Not only do large-scale 
infrastructure projects take time to design, bid, 
and build, but the money is scheduled over a 
five-year period in many cases. Add to that 
the impact of the pandemic on business ca-
pacity and the supply chain and the need for 
workers stretches for years ahead. 
How many workers will be necessary and 
when projects will be ready to proceed is not 
easily predicted. So, the legislation I have in-
troduced today simply authorizes the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security and the Governor 
of the Marianas to make the determination 
when construction workers are needed. The 
Governor will request the foreign workers to 
augment the Marianas labor force. The Sec-
retary will then decide whether the request is 
justified, whether qualified U.S. workers are 
truly not available, and whether adding foreign 
workers would in any way reduce the wage- 
setting power of local, U.S. workers in our is-
lands. 
Congress has made an historic investment 
in the Mariana Islands in the form of disaster 
recovery assistance and in funding infrastruc-
ture that can withstand future disasters. But 
that funding will need labor. The legislation I 
am introducing today will help ensure that 
labor needs are met, that projects are built, 
and that the Marianas is in a stronger position 
to withstand the corning climate change. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

H.R. 5683 would require the Under Sec-
retary for Management at the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to report to the 
Congress within 180 days of enactment on 
the department’s active contracts that re-
late to U.S.-Mexico border security and that 
are above $50 million. The report would need 
to include an assessment of whether contract 
personnel are necessary to fulfill the depart-
ment’s mission on the U.S.-Mexico land bor-
der and a strategy to improve the effective-
ness of such contracts. The bill also would 
require DHS to submit a plan to implement 
the strategy and brief the Congress every six 
months until the plan has been implemented. 
Using information from DHS, CBO expects 
that the department would need about $2 
million in contractor support and seven em-
ployees to produce the report and about 
twice as many employees to implement the 
strategy for two to three years after it is fi-
nalized. On that basis, and assuming the bill 
is enacted near the end of fiscal year 2022, 
CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 5683 
would cost approximately $6 million over the 
2022–2026 period; such spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Lindsay Wylie. The estimate was reviewed 
by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.

HONORING MICHAEL VOGEL 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Michael Vogel, who recently re-
tired after coaching volleyball for thirty-one 
years at Hempfield High School in Landisville, 
Pennsylvania. Mike’s time as coach was noth-
ing short of incredible, with a list of records 
and championship wins to prove it. Just to 
name a few, he led Hempfield’s girls’ 
volleyball team to win five District 3 Class 3A 
titles and two state championships while also 
leading the boys’ volleyball team to take seven 
PIAA–3A state titles and fifteen District 3 
Class 3A crowns. As coach of Hempfield’s 
boys’ volleyball team for twenty-four years, the 
team had a record of 1,106–94, an astounding 
feat. These accomplishments demonstrate the 
immense dedication that Mike showed to 
Hempfield High School and the many players 
he coached over the years. He taught them 
the value of sportsmanship and hard work, 
lessons that will last a lifetime. And for that, 
everyone across our community should be 
thankful for Mike. 
I wish Mike a restful and well-deserved re-
tirement and hope that the next volleyball 
coach at Hempfield High School will be able to 
meet the high bar that Mike set.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
REVEREND 
DAVE 
WASH-
INGTON, JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Reverend Dave Washington, 
Jr. 
Reverend Washington began his formal, 
education at Druid High School in Tuscaloosa, 
Alabama. He accepted a football scholarship 
to attend Alcorn State University, where he 
graduated with a degree in Chemistry. He 
later received a Master’s Degree in Education 
Administration from Jackson State University. 
Reverend Washington spent 11 years as a 
NFL Pro Football Player for the Denver Bron-
cos, Buffalo Bills, and San Francisco 49ers. At 
the age of 25, and while still playing in the 
NFL, Dave became a real estate developer. 
He designed and built a middle-class residen-
tial subdivision in Port Gibson, MS, which he 
named Trace Hills. Upon his retirement from 
the NFL in 1981, he served under the admin-
istration of Governor William Winters before 
taking on the Directorship of the Farish Street 
YMCA, where he developed the city’s largest 
little league football program. 
For all the lives Reverend Washington has 
touched, his legacy will continue in our hearts 
and in our interactions with colleagues, 
friends, and family. He was truly a dedicated 
man, husband, father, friend, and educator. 
Reverend Washington, Jr. will forever be re-
membered for his business acumen and pas-
sion for education, sports, mentoring, and en-
trepreneurship was a catalyst to many of the 
worthy endeavors for which he was involved. 
He was one who truly used his platform to le-
verage opportunities for others. He conceived 
and produced youth programs such as the 
HIS Ranch Youth Summer Program, the 12+2 
Men’s Youth Program, the annual Scholarship 
3-Point Slam Dunk Contest, the Canton Peace 
Rally and Golf Classic, and his crowning chari-
table achievement, ‘‘Super Bowl Super Kids 
Super Sunday’’, which was a precursor pro-
gram to the modern-day NFL Experience. His 
exceptional life of unyielding faith, devotion to 
family and the greater good will be cherished 
by his high school sweetheart of 51 years, 
Dianne Williams and his four children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Reverend Dave Wash-
ington, Jr. for his dedication and tenacity to 
serving his community and desire to be an ex-
ample for all.

HONORING BENJAMIN M. PULEX 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor an extraordinary young man, Ben-
jamin M. Pulex, who was taken too soon. I in-
clude in the RECORD his family’s loving tribute. 
Benjamin M. Pulex died at the age of 18 on 
Saturday, February 26, 2022, at his Skokie 
home with family at his side. Benjamin was 
born June 9, 2003, in Evanston, IL to devoted 
parents Magnolia Rivera-Pulex and Cesar 
Pulex. Benjamin grew up in a home filled 
with deep love and encouragement alongside 
his sister, Camila Pulex. Together the family 
prioritized values like love, respect, and 
gratitude. These values were often cultivated 
by regular family trips that fostered a sense 
of curiosity and stewardship for the environ-
ment and ocean life, while also turning Ben-
jamin into a well-seasoned traveler. His an-
nual trips to visit his family in Long Beach, 
California led to some of his greatest experi-
ences and memories, especially alongside his 
cousin Angelo Pulex. 
Benjamin graduated from Niles North High 
School (Class of 2021) with a group of amaz-
ing, long-time friends. Benjamin and his 
friends enjoyed soccer scrimmaging, playing 
video games, and eating out at local res-
taurants. Together (with support from Ben-
jamin’s father) they also founded a local soc-
cer team, the Skokie United Futbol Team 
HS21.

E204 
March 2, 2022 
After the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS) diagnosis that Benjamin received, he 
showed compassion and hoped that no other 
children would have to endure what he did. 
The greatest protection he had during his 
battle with ALS was the never-ending sup-
port and care given to him by his parents 
and family. Throughout every stage of Ben-
jamin’s illness Magnolia and Cesar were by 
his side providing the medical and emotional 
support he needed at any hour of the morn-
ing or night, while also striving to ensure 
that Benjamin found joy in moments and ac-
tivities throughout the day. Together they 
quickly became movie and anime aficionados 
bonding over movie classics and anime shows 
between treatments. 
Prior to his ALS diagnosis, Benjamin was 
an undergraduate student at North Park 
University interested in pursuing marine bi-
ology. He had received a private tour with 
the University of Washington’s faculty in 
2021 and was personally encouraged by fac-
ulty to transfer into the University of Wash-
ington’s Friday Harbor Laboratories pro-
gram. In a world full of complexity, Ben-
jamin was the opposite—he was caring, 
grateful, honest, and above all humble. He 
retained simple yet abundant pleasures in 
life: spending time with his loving family, 
his amazing group of friends, watching 
Spiderman movies and anime, listening to 
80’s music classics, adhering to his fierce loy-
alty to Real Madrid by watching games and 
cheering any hour of the day, also extending 
that team loyalty to the Seattle Seahawks, 
and immersing himself into caring and 
learning more about ocean life. Benjamin 
had a sharp sense of humor and quick wit, 
even making jokes and playing pranks 
throughout his battle against ALS, staying 
true to himself until the very end. 
Benjamin is survived by his parents, Mag-
nolia Rivera-Pulex and Cesar Pulex, his sis-
ter Camila Pulex, and a large and loving ex-
tended family.

RECOGNIZING THE 34TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MASSACRES AGAINST 
ARMENIANS IN SUMGAIT 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the thirty-fourth anniversary of the 
Sumgait pogroms, which is known as one of 
the most violent anti-Armenian massacres or-
chestrated by Azerbaijan. 
In February of 1988, the Armenian people of 
Nagorno Karabakh, more commonly known by 
its people and descendants as Artsakh, rose 
in peaceful protest to demand their right to 
self-determination. On February 27, 1988, ci-
vilians were subjected to violent riots and 
massacres, which lasted for three days. Many 
innocent civilians were injured, killed, and tor-
tured; some managed to escape and survive 
while coping with the catastrophe they sur-
vived. 
Unfazed by their oppression, the Armenian 
community remained strong and dedicated to 
preserving their self-determination toward a 
free-democratic country, that would finally end 
their rule under the Soviet Union. The courage 
demonstrated by the people of Artsakh must 
never be forgotten. 
Human rights violations cannot be ignored, 
and we must learn from our experiences to 
ensure basic human rights across the globe. 
In 2020, we saw the Azerbaijani government 
capture 25 Armenian soldiers and held them 
as prisoners of war. The fate of one prisoner 
remains unknown as of this date. The Azer-
baijani government must be held accountable 
for its violent aggression against the Armenian 
people. 
Today, the people of Artsakh continue to 
demonstrate strength and unity as they strive 
towards creating a better tomorrow for them-
selves and their sovereignty. As lawmakers, 
it’s imperative that Congress continues to work 
with our counterparts to support a free, pros-
perous, and secure Armenia and hold Azer-
baijan accountable. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the thousands 
of Armenian Americans living in my congres-
sional district, I ask my colleagues to stand 
with the people of Artsakh in remembering the 
lives lost during this tragic event. May their 
memory serve as a reminder for each one of 
us to continue advocating for human rights 
and democracy around the globe.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JIM 
LANCASTER 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of my friend, cousin, and lifelong 
Tennessean, Jimmie Knight Lancaster. He 
passed away on February 3rd after a remark-
able 92 years on God’s earth. 
He was born on June 11, 1929 in Smith 
County, Tennessee and was the oldest of twin 
sons born to Edward and Dimple Knight Lan-
caster. He was raised in a log cabin on the 
family farm and attended Lancaster Elemen-
tary School. After graduating from Gordons-
ville High School in 1947, he attended Ten-
nessee Technological University on a football 
scholarship where he received All-Conference 
honors as a single wing tailback. In college, 
he served as President of the ‘‘T’’ Club and 
was elected to Who’s Who Among College 
Students while graduating with the highest 
honors and his Bachelor of Science degree in 
Agronomy Agriculture in 1951. 
Mr. Lancaster dedicated much of his life to 
agriculture. He worked for the Wilson County 
Farm Bureau as its Agency Manager for over 
43 years. In fact, he’s now a member of the 
Wilson County Agricultural Hall of Fame in 
recognition of his exemplary work for local 
farmers throughout his career. 
Jim had an unquenchable thirst for learning 
throughout his life. He became a Certified Life 
Underwriter in 1972, earned an Advanced Es-
tate Planning Degree in 1973, and became a 
Chartered Financial Consultant in 1982. 
As a charter member and former Sunday 
School teacher at the Westland United Meth-
odist Church in Lebanon, Jim loved the Lord 
and cherished his family with all his heart. He 
and Vondell, the love of his life, were married 
for 67 years before her passing. Together they 
had five children, twelve grandchildren, eight-
een great-grandchildren, and two great-great- 
grandchildren. Jim’s and Vondell’s loving mar-
riage and devotion to family led to a lot of little 
Lancasters running around Middle Tennessee. 
Jim was a joyful role model and so many 
people in his community knew Jim in that way. 
He served as a leader in many local organiza-
tions including the Chamber of Commerce, 
Boy Scouts, Lebanon Jaycees, the Peoples 
Bank, the Lebanon Rotary Club, and Cum-
berland University, and was local camp Presi-
dent of Gideon’s International. He prided him-
self on being a consummate public servant 
and attempted to inspire others to do the 
same. 
He received countless awards for his serv-
ice over the years like becoming a member of 
the Robert E. Musto Insurance Hall of Fame, 
receiving an honorary Doctorate in Literary 
Letters from Cumberland University, the Jay-
cee’s Distinguished Service Award, the Rotary 
Club’s Paul Harris Fellowship Award and Ber-
nie Bass Good Citizenship Award, Tennessee 
Technological University’s Outstanding Service 
Award, and the Chamber of Commerce’s Life-
time Membership Award. But he was a hum-
ble man who wasn’t in it for recognition. He 
just loved serving his community and the peo-
ple in it. 
Jim Lancaster spent his entire life serving 
his community, the public, and the Lord. It is 
only suitable for Congress to recognize and 
honor his life and legacy. I was blessed to call 
Jim family. It is a bittersweet moment for me 
now to say he’s gone to be with our Lord. 
I thank Jim Lancaster for a life well lived 
that touched so many in such a positive way.

HONORING CHRYSTAL WILLIAMS- 
DAVIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Mrs. Chrystal Williams-Davis. 
Chrystal was born August 27, 1971, to the 
late Emma Turner Williams in Marks, Mis-
sissippi. She was the last born of 10 children. 
She attended schools in Quitman County and 
graduated from Quitman County High School 
in 1989. 
Immediately after graduating high school, 
she enlisted in the United States Army and 
was deployed in 1990 to Operation Desert 
Shield where she was in the Persian Gulf for 
one year serving during Operation Desert 
Shield/Storm. She received the Southwest 
Asia Service Medal, the Medal for the Libera-
tion of Kuwait, The Army Commendation 
Medal, and The National Defense Medal. 
Chrystal served a total of ten years in the 
United States Army Reserve. 
Chrystal returned home from Desert Storm 
and attained her certificate in Practical Nursing 
from Northwest Community college in 1995. 
Upon completion of Practical Nursing school, 
her mother Emma passed away suddenly. 
Chrystal was sad but remembered how proud 
her mother was of her accomplishment, and 
that gave her great comfort and pushed her 
even harder. She worked as a Licensed Prac-
tical Nurse for five years and decided it was 
time to advance her career in nursing. She 
then attended Mississippi Delta Community 
College where she obtained her Associate De-
gree in Nursing in 2005. She worked as an In-
tensive Care RN for several years and de-
cided once again that she wanted to have the 
ability to do more for her patients after seeing

HONORING TOBI PARKS AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Tobi Parks, the founder of xBk 
and the Board Vice President for the National 
Independent Venue Association Foundation, 
as Iowan of the Week. 
Surrounded by music her entire life, Tobi 
describes herself as a musician and creator at 
heart. Growing up with an understanding of 
what it takes to be successful in the music in-
dustry, Tobi was conscious that her unwaver-
ing passion for music could lead to a viable 
and fulfilling career path. Studying media com-
munications and audio production at Webster 
University, Tobi was able to foster her inter-
ests academically. While at first, Tobi was 
scared to put herself out there, those concerns 
never stopped her from pursuing her dreams 
in the music industry whether it was com-
pleting gigs or hosting shows on the radio. 
After university, Tobi moved to New York, 
where she worked for Sony focusing on copy-
right and licensing work. However, in 2015, 
Tobi moved to Des Moines and in the same 
year, she established an artist-development 
nonprofit label called Station One Records. 
Station One Records was created with the ob-
jective of granting artists the development that 
she wishes she could have had. In the end, 
the nonprofit promotes that finding and culti-
vating talent is the priority rather than the fi-
nancial benefits and end results. 
As a woman of color and a member of the 
LGBTQ+ community, moving to Des Moines 
with her family was a considerable change 
from her life in New York City. The decision 
was made based on the fact that they had 
family in the area, and she could still be le-
gally married in Iowa. Additionally, at the time, 
a member of the Des Moines Social Club ad-
vised her that one can do whatever they wish 
to do and find support anywhere in Des 
Moines. With that advice in mind, Tobi sought 
to build upon the live music ecosystem in Des 
Moines since she already had experience with 
running venues, booking artists, and touring. 
These experiences led to her founding xBk, 
which is a live entertainment venue in Des 
Moines in the Drake neighborhood. With the 
creation of xBk, there was an opportunity to 
increase the outreach of Station One, create a 
space to foster an artist community, and diver-
sify the genres of music seen in Des Moines 
through the venue. Furthermore, with the 
COVID–19 pandemic, her work as the Board 
Vice President for the National Independent 
Venue Association Foundation has pushed for 
xBk and other businesses to obtain necessary 
aid through emergency relief programs and 
additional grants. 
Tobi’s involvement in the music industry and 
Des Moines community encourages both the 
development of those she helps and the diver-
sity of the industry in general. Her determina-
tion and inclusive mindset have propelled her 
to success and make her truly worthy of being 
nominated for this award. Tobi serves as an 
inspiration and role model to all, and it is my 
honor to name her Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EXTRAOR-
DINARY SERVICE OF LEN SIMICH 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, today I rec-
ognize Len Simich for his extraordinary serv-
ice to the state of Minnesota as the longtime 
leader of SouthWest Transit. 
Since 1997, Len has served as the CEO of 
SouthWest Transit, a public transit agency 
serving the cities of Chaska, Chanhassen, 
Eden Prairie, and Carver. Under his leader-
ship, SouthWest Transit has embodied its mis-
sion to be more than a transit agency by put-
ting people first. This approach established 
SouthWest Transit as a nation-leading subur-
ban transit agency and key contributor to the 
region’s continued growth and economic de-
velopment. 
Len has helped guide SouthWest Transit 
from nearly the beginning, helming the agency 
for over two-thirds of its existence. In that 
time, he has spurred a fourfold increase in rid-
ership, the construction of numerous new tran-
sit stations, and the implementation of innova-
tive transit services such as SouthWest Prime. 
He also helped lead the agency through the 
many challenges that have faced transpor-
tation agencies in the past two-and-a-half dec-
ades, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Len’s dedication and ingenuity has been 
recognized time and time again at the state 
and national levels. Len was previously hon-
ored as the Minnesota Transit Professional of 
the Year, and the list of accolades for South-
West Transit are too numerous to fully list but 
include the American Public Transportation 
Association’s Outstanding Public Transpor-
tation System of the Year and the Federal 
Highway Administration’s National Environ-
mental Excellence Award. 
Even as he embarks on his retirement, both 
SouthWest Transit and the communities the 
agency serves will continue to benefit from his 
visionary leadership. His service has made it 
easier for families and friends to share mo-
ments together, for residents to achieve eco-
nomic success through access to job openings 
across the region, for seniors to live more 
independently and maintain access to the care 
and services they need, and for all to enjoy 
unique seasonal events like the Minnesota 
State Fair. Our region owes a debt of gratitude 
to Len for allowing us all to enjoy the fruits of 
his labor, and on behalf of a grateful commu-
nity, we wish him a happy, healthy, and mean-
ingful retirement.

tions to better quantify the condition of aging

OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
Proclamation. 
Whereas, Sandra Morriseau, 53, passed 
away on February 18, 2022, after a coura-
geous health battle. 
Whereas, Sandra was born on the 22nd of 
May in 1968 to parents Joseph (who preceded 
her in death) and Marie-Carmel Louisias. Her 
birthplace as well as the setting of her child-
hood was Brooklyn, New York. 
Whereas, she attended Clara Barton High 
School in Brooklyn. Shortly after, in 1989, 
Sandra moved to Miami Shores Florida with 
her parents and brother. While living in Miami, 
Sandra attended Barry University and pursued 
a degree in Nursing. She graduated and very 
quickly realized her calling was in the enter-
tainment industry. She spent her life com-
mitted to uplifting Haitian culture in the Miami 
area and had a zest for life that shined 
through all the events she worked on and the 
friendships she nurtured within the community. 
Whereas, through hard work and grace, 
Sandra accomplished many feats. Some of 
her accomplishments included becoming the 
first Island television employees, working at 
the 
Little 
Haiti 
Cultural 
Center, 
helping 
produce Sound of Little Haiti, and multiple 
other impressive acts. 
Whereas, in 2003, she married Riquet 
Morriseau and they had two beautiful children, 
Samara and Matthew Morriseau. Sandra was 
a dedicated wife and mother. She treasured 
her two children and embraced every moment 
with them. 
Whereas, she was a loving and compas-
sionate person who loved to go above and be-
yond in everything that she did. All her actions 
were committed with elegance and class. 
Those who knew her will remember Sandra 
for being a perfectionist, loving, and a caring 
daughter, sister, and friend. 
Whereas, let us strive to honor her memory 
by pursuing our passions and living a full life 
as she would have wanted us to.

HONORING KYLE KILLINGER 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a fellow Marine from Columbus who is 
making a difference for fellow veterans from 
sea to shining sea. 
Kyle Killinger set out on foot, running from 
San Diego, California on a cross-country jour-
ney to raise awareness for veteran suicide. 
Kyle completed his run just a few steps 
away from here at the Vietnam Veterans Me-
morial Wall. 
Kyle started his own non-profit, entitled, 
‘‘Because He’s My Brother’’ to raise aware-
ness of veteran suicide and post traumatic 
stress. 
He has raised money along his journey to 
benefit another organization that strives to pre-
vent veteran suicide, SAVE 22. I hope that 
each and every veteran is inspired by Kyle’s 
3,000–mile run. 
His long Journey through peaks and valleys 
is not unlike that of every man and women 
who has served our nation in uniform. 
My hope is that anyone who needs help 
finds the courage to ask. 
Semper Fi.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 
AND SERVICE OF WALTER J. KUSZ 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 100th birthday and the 
service of Walter J. Kusz. Through his com-
mitment to our country and his local commu-
nity, Walter has become an indispensable part 
of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
Mr. Kusz was born on March 2, 1922, in 
Ironwood, Michigan, to Joseph and Magdalena 
Kusz and was the middle of nine siblings. 
Walter and his bothers all went on to serve in 
the U.S. Military after high school during World 
War II and the Korean War. He was drafted in 
1943 and became a member of the U.S. 
Army–Air Corps after his completion of his 
basic training in Miami Beach, Florida. From 
there, Walter was assigned to Dowling Air 
Field in Washington, D.C., where he relayed 
meteorological data at the Pentagon to U.S. 
Bomber Command in Europe. He was then 
promoted to Staff Sergeant T–5 and joined 
Occupation Forces in Austria between 1945 
and 1946. 
As a Yooper and an avid outdoorsman, 
Walter also has a great passion for winter 
sports, snow skiing, and hunting. While serv-
ing in Europe, he joined the U.S. Army ski- 
jumping team and competed in competitions in 
Holmenkollen, Norway, and Garmisch, Ger-
many, Following his military service, he be-
came president of the Gogebic Range Ski 
Corporation and brought several competitions 
to the U.P. at Copper Peak during the 1970s 
and 1980s. In addition, Walter was a devoted 
hunter throughout his life, shooting his last 
buck at the age of 92. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the 100th birthday of Walter J. 
Kusz. His accomplishments inspire us all and 
we are grateful for his years of service to our

MILSPAW’S 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY AND LIFE OF COMMU-
NITY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize Mrs. Gloria Jean Weirich Milspaw 
upon the occasion of her 100th Birthday, as 
well as her continued, tireless service to our 
communities. 
Born and raised in Middletown, Pennsyl-
vania, Mrs. Milspaw became the first ever fe-
male drum major for the Middletown High 
School band in her sophomore year. She at-
tended West Chester State Teachers College 
for two years as a music major but left early 
in part due to the Great Depression and World 
War II. Though she later took the Civil Service 
exam and scored extremely high, she was told 
that women couldn’t be given the higher-level 
jobs that were ‘‘reserved for men with families 
to feed.’’ As a result, she was given a type-
writer and became a secretary. It was then 
that she met her future husband, Captain (and 
later Lieutenant Colonel) Lynn G. Milspaw, an 
engineer and Air Force pilot. They were mar-
ried in 1944 and endured the stress and hard-
ship of his military duty in both World War II 
and Korea, as well as his later duty as a high- 
level civil servant for the Air Force. Gloria 
sang with and directed church choirs and var-
ious music groups in all their travels and duty 
stations. 
While in Utah, Gloria took up and excelled 
at the hobby of watercolor, and within a few 
years she became President of the Utah Wa-
tercolor Association. After moving back to

Pennsylvania, she soon became a signature 
member of the Pennsylvania Watercolor Asso-
ciation as well. She also earned a degree in 
Interior Design, founded a small business, and 
took up skiing. One of her greatest challenges, 
however, was her rigorous fight against 
lymphoma—and—chemotherapy from which 
she made a full recovery at the age of 90. 
Mrs. Milspaw, now 100 years young, resides 
in the same town in which she was born, and 
remains a beacon of health and wellness in 
our community. She exercises daily, paints 
and sells watercolors, serves God and her 
church, and is constantly learning more about 
the world. I am humbled and privileged to 
commend and thank Mrs. Gloria Milspaw on 
her many successes both at home and 
abroad, and her lifelong dedication to being an 
active member of our communities. I wish her 
a wonderful birthday celebration, and God-
speed for many more days of a life filled with 
good health, happiness, prosperity, and love.

HONORING HERMAN MOORE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
innovative gentleman, Mr. Herman Moore. Mr. 
Moore has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication and a desire to achieve 
success. 
Herman Moore has been awarded top hon-
ors with the 2022 Black Engineer of the Year

American scientists and engineers around the 
country. The winners chosen are leaders 
shaping the future of science, technology, en-

as promoting diversity and inclusion in the

year’s BEYA STEM Global Competitiveness 
Conference, which was held in Washington, 
D.C. Feb. 17 through 19. 
He is the leader and main technical devel-
oper of the Army Facilities Components Sys-
tem project. On that project, he plays an in-
strumental role by providing direction and 
input to teams, sponsors, and customers to re-
solve technical solutions and enhanced appli-
cation features. Moore began his career at 
ERDC in 1996 and earned his master’s de-
gree in computer science in 2004. 
With Moore’s technical capabilities and lead-
ership experience at ERDC, he is always look-
ing for opportunities to serve as a mentor to 
junior scientists and to develop himself to ad-
vance the mission. His advice to engineers 
just beginning a career is to identify strengths 
and weaknesses. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Herman Moore for his 
passion and dedication to the field of Engi-
neering.

TRIBUTE TO PETER LEE 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Peter V. Lee, the first and only Exec-
utive Director of the highly successful health 
benefit exchange, Covered California. He 
leaves the organization to ‘look for the next 
mountain to climb.’ 
The story of the extraordinary success of 
Covered California is the history of Peter Lee’s 
tenure. As of January 31, 2021, Covered Cali-
fornia announced that 1,744,000 people, a 
new record high, had signed up for health cov-
erage. Under Peter Lee’s leadership, unin-
sured rates dropped 20.5 percent for Latinos, 
12.4 percent for Asian Americans and African 
Americans, and 8.3 percent for Caucasians. 
All this has been achieved with rate increases 
kept low. 
Peter Lee was unanimously confirmed as 
Executive Director by the Covered California 
board on August 23, 2011. Prior to serving as 
Executive Director of Covered California, he 
was the Deputy Director of the Center for 
Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS 
where he worked to improve care and reduce 
costs. He was the Director of Delivery System 
Reform for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services from 1995 to 2000 and the 
Executive Director of the Center for Health 
Care Rights. From 2000 to 2008, Peter was 
the CEO and Executive Director for National 
Health Policy of the Pacific Business Group on 
Health and the former Director of Programs for 
the National AIDS Network. Prior to this, Peter 
was a practicing attorney in Los Angeles. 
Peter Lee is a member of a pioneering Cali-
fornia health care family and his work at Cov-
ered California continued in that proud tradi-
tion. His grandfather, Russel Van Arsdale Lee, 
founded the Palo Alto Medical Clinic (now the 
Palo Alto Medical Foundation). His father, 
Peter Lee, founded the Family Medicine De-
partment at USC and, at risk to his career, 
spoke out in favor of Medicare in 1965. His 
uncle, Dr. Philip R. Lee, helped create and im-
plement Medicare, and served in the Clinton 
Administration as an Assistant Health Sec-
retary. His uncle, Dr. Hewlett Lee, was a high-
ly regarded and well-loved surgeon. Peter 
earned his undergraduate degree from UC 
Berkeley and his law degree from USC. 
Peter Lee’s work has improved the lives of 
millions of Californians and created a national 
model for other states to emulate. His tenure 
as Executive Director created a strong, vital 
organization well suited to continue its mission 
of service and innovation after his departure. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring and 
thanking Peter Lee for his outstanding work 
and in wishing him every blessing as he en-
ters the next chapter in his superb career.

HONORING 
COLONIAL 
STEAK 
HOUSE’S INDUCTION INTO THE 
ARKANSAS FOOD HALL OF FAME 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Colonial Steak House of 
Pine Bluff for being inducted into the Arkansas 
Food Hall of Fame Class of 2022. The 
steakhouse was one of three winners out of 
ten finalists submitted in the state of Arkansas. 
Having opened its doors in 1974, the Colo-
nial Steak House has and continues to be a 
staple in the Pine Bluff community. This local 
restaurant embodies the resilient spirit of Ar-
kansas, having survived a fire in the 1980s 
and the Coronavirus pandemic, For nearly fifty 
years, it has continually served the commu-
nity, not only with great food, but also with its 
drive to make the Pine Bluff area better. This 
was highlighted in 2020 when a $1,200.00 tip 
was left for one server. Colonial’s owners di-
vided it amongst the employees, even those 
who had the day off. Allie Hall and her busi-
ness partner Scott Mouser purchased the his-
toric steakhouse from her mom Dana Gately 
in 2020, and between the three of them, they 
have over fifty years of experience running the 
restaurant. To this day, if you come on a busy 
night, you can find three generations of 
Gately’s working there. 
I take this time today to congratulate Allie 
Hall, Scott Mouser, Dana Gately, and the staff 
of the Colonial Steak House on this well-de-
served honor. I thank them for their dedication 
to Pine Bluff, our community, and all the resi-
dents of Arkansas’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict.

OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Marshall’s 
Music and Bookstore. 
Marshall’s Music and Bookstore is a Black- 
owned family business on Farish Street in 
Downtown Jackson. The store has been 
around for 84 years. 
The store has its own story of surviving ev-
erything from the Great Depression, segrega-
tion and Jim Crow era to a pandemic, reces-
sion, and even digital transformation. 
Maati Jone Primm is a third-generation 
owner of the store, which prides itself on edu-
cating children and adults about Black His-
tory—which Primm stresses don’t begin in en-
slavement. 
Books, literature, and music are stacked on 
tables and shelves. The walls are adorned 
with striking images of African American 
changemakers with roots in Mississippi. 
Stacey Abrams from Gulfport, Ruby Bridges 
from Tylertown, Sam Cooke from Clarksdale, 
Charley Pride from Sledge, C.L. Franklin from 
Shelby, and Judge Mablean from Hazlehurst 
are only a few of the faces you will see.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E208 
March 2, 2022 
From February 27–29, 1988, hundreds of 
Armenians living in Sumgait, Azerbaijan were 
targeted in violent, ethnically motivated at-
tacks. Armenians were beaten, murdered, 
raped, burned alive, and driven out of their 
homes. Mass violence against Armenians con-
tinued in other Azerbaijani cities in the fol-
lowing years, including in Baku in 1990, and 
thousands of Armenians were displaced. At 
the time, Members of the U.S. Congress, both 
Democrat and Republican, urged Azerbaijan 
to stop these atrocious events and take steps 
to protect these Armenian communities. 
Many believe that these pogroms occurred 
in response to peaceful protests led by ethnic 
Armenians in Artsakh, or Nagorno-Karabakh, 
who were demanding independence from 
Azerbaijan 
and 
calling 
for 
democracy. 
Throughout the dispute over Artsakh, anti-Ar-
menian hatred and propaganda spread rapidly 
throughout Azerbaijan. It was this hatred and 
propaganda that fueled the Sumgait and Baku 
pogroms. 
We must be vocal in rejecting hatred, vio-
lence, and discrimination—and work tirelessly 
to ensure that history does not repeat itself. I 
ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the 
memory of those lost in the Sumgait and Baku 
pogroms. And I will continue to work with the 
Congressional Armenian Issues Caucus to re-
affirm our commitment to combatting human 
rights abuses around the world.

HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT

Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, as 
Co-Chair of the U.S.-Philippines Friendship 
Caucus, I rise today to pay tribute to a great 
Philippine statesman and friend to the United

In 1996, Ambassador Romulo was the

the US-Philippines Society. He administered 
the Society’s ‘‘Carlos P. Romulo Awards’’ in 
recognition of the contributions of Filipinos and 
Americans 
who 
have 
strengthened 
Phil-
ippines-U.S. ties, a core mission of the Soci-
ety. 
He was also chairman of non-profit founda-
tions: the Carlos P. Romulo Foundation for 
Peace and Development, which raises aware-
ness of critical issues that significantly impact 
the peace and development of the Philippines 
and the region at large; the Zuellig Family

health conditions in rural Filipino communities 
by providing training programs for local gov-
ernment health leaders; and the Asia-Europe

gether the peoples of Asia and Europe to ad-
dress common global challenges. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying tribute to an extraordinary dip-
lomat, statesman, and friend to the United 
States. Ambassador Romulo will be sorely 
missed by so many for his frankness, honesty, 
and dedication to deepening relations between 
our two countries.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
VAN BUREN TOWNSHIP PUBLIC 
SAFETY 
DIRECTOR 
GREGORY 
LAURAIN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Director Gregory Laurain 
on the occasion of his retirement from Van 
Buren Police Department after over 40 years 
of service to Van Buren Township, Michigan. 
His significant service to our community is 
worthy of commendation. 
Director Laurain is a graduate of the North-
western University School of Police Staff and 
Command and the elite FBI National Acad-
emy. A well-rounded leader in public safety, 
he is also a graduate of the Van Buren Town-
ship Fire Academy. He began his career with 
the Van Buren Police Department in 1980, 
working as a reserve police officer. A member 
of the first full time class of police officers in 
the history of the township, he became a pa-
trolman in 1981. Five years later he was pro-
moted to Detective Sergeant. In 2006 he was 
promoted to the role of Patrol Captain, super-
vising seven units within the police depart-
ment. In 2013, he was appointed to serve as 
Public Safety Director for Van Buren Township 
and was tasked with leading the entire Public 
Safety department, including the united police 
and fire departments. Under his leadership, 
the police department was accredited through 
the Michigan Law Enforcement Accreditation 
Commission making it one of only 43 agencies 
in the state to earn this honor. 
As a leader known throughout Southeastern 
Michigan, Director Laurain’s work did not end 
at the Township border. He served as Com-
mander of the Western Wayne County Special 
Operations Team, as a member of the Drug 
Enforcement Agency Airport Interdiction Team, 
and with the Michigan State Police Narcotic 
Interdiction Team. Known for his selflessness, 
integrity, and tireless work ethic, Director 
Laurain is an example among his peers. He 
was named President of the Wayne County 
Chiefs Association and Board President of the 
FBI National Academy Associates Michigan 
Chapter. Director Laurain is a member of the 
Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police and 
the Southeastern Michigan Chiefs of Police. 
He resides in Michigan with his wife and is 
looking forward to spending more time with his 
two daughters and grandchildren in retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Director Gregory Laurain for 
his over 40 years of exemplary service. He 
has effectively and selflessly served Van 
Buren Township and has been steadfastly 
dedicated to the safety of our community. I 
join with Director Laurain’s family, friends, and 
colleagues in extending my best wishes to him 
in retirement.
