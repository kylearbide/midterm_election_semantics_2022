NICOLE GEE EULOGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
every American knows the image of 
George Washington crossing the Dela-
ware, the fallen rifleman at Gettys-
burg, and the marines raising the flag 
at Iwo Jima. Our history is punctuated 
with moments of individual heroism 
and virtue so profound and moving 
that they live forever in the memories 
of our countrymen and the proud story 
of our country. 
To these iconic images, history has 
now added another: that of a young 
marine sergeant in full combat gear 
cradling a helpless infant in her arms 
amidst the unfolding chaos and peril in 
the besieged Kabul Airport and pro-
claiming: ‘‘I love my job.’’ 
The entire story of the war in Af-
ghanistan is told in this picture: the 
sacrifices borne by young Americans 
who volunteered to protect their coun-
try from international terrorism, the 
heroism of those who serve their coun-
try even when their country failed 
them, the idealism of a generation that 
tried to bring enlightened modernity to 
an afflicted society, and, most of all, 
the stark contrast between good and 
evil, tyranny and freedom, barbarity 
and justice, and brutality and mercy. 
Above all others, this is the image 
that describes it all. It is given power 
and immortality by the spirit of the 
young woman in this photo, Marine 
Sergeant Nicole Gee. Through the ages 
to come, this picture will speak of the 
sacrifice of blood and treasure of 20 
years of struggling and of the vision, 
hope, liberty, justice, and humanity 
that summoned patriots like Nicole 
Gee to leave their homes and families 
and place themselves in harm’s way on 
the other side of the world. As Shake-
speare put it: ‘‘This story shall the 
good man teach his son.’’ Historians 
looking back on this age will find its 
story summarized in this single picture 
and illustrated in the life, dreams, and 
ultimate sacrifice of Nicole Gee. 
They will note that her life ended 
just days after this photo was taken at 
the age of just 23 years. They will re-
member that this angelic young lady 
was cut down with 12 of her brothers 
and sisters by incarnate, insensate evil. 
They will ponder where that young life 
might have led. 
That is an important question, and 
the answer is known to all who knew 
her. She could have done anything she 
wanted. She was married to her high 
school sweetheart, 4.1 GPA at Oakmont 
High School, ‘‘one pretty badass ma-
rine,’’ as her sister put it. She could 
have done anything she wanted, and 
what she wanted most was to serve her 
country and to serve humanity. 
Who else but a guardian angel amidst 
the chaos and violence of those last 
days in Kabul could look beyond all 
that and look into the eyes of an infant 
and proclaim: ‘‘I love my job’’? 
Speaking of the fallen heroes of past 
wars, James Michener asked the haunt-
ing question: Where do we get such 
men? 
Well, here is the answer: We get such 
men and women from little towns 
across America like Roseville, Cali-
fornia. They leave their family and 
friends in pursuit of the highest virtues 
of which human beings are capable, and 
they do it because their country asks 
them and because it is noble. 
I don’t know how to offer condo-
lences to Nicole’s family, to her hus-
band, Jarod; her father, Rick; her sis-
ter, Misty; and her family and friends. 
The loss they bear is beyond my com-
prehension. I can only offer my awe 
and gratitude that humanity has with-
in itself a small band of brothers and 
sisters like Nicole Gee; for without 
them, America, that ‘‘last best hope of 
mankind on this Earth,’’ would not be 
possible. 
A few steps from here in the rotunda 
is a fresco called The Apotheosis of 
Washington. It depicts General Wash-
ington in uniform ascending to the 
heavens flanked by Victory and Free-
dom and surrounded by the essence and 
fruits of a free nation. And in that de-
piction, Washington beckons. 
From little towns like Roseville, 
California, decent young men and 
women with promising futures like Ni-
cole Gee have answered. I don’t know 
how their families can bear it, but I do 
know that we owe them. Before her fa-
ther left the stage at a community me-
morial, he had one request. He pleaded:

‘‘Never forget her please, never forget 
her.’’ 
We can never repay that debt except 
to honor her memory, keep her sac-
rifice always in mind, and to draw in-
spiration from her dedication and devo-
tion to God and country—to all those 
who sacrificed everything ‘‘to proclaim 
liberty throughout all the land and 
unto all the inhabitants thereof.’’ 
f 
MI CASA RESOURCE CENTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Mi Casa Resource Center, 
now in their 45th year of service. Mi 
Casa was founded in 1976 by a group of 
eight Latina mothers who dreamed of a 
better world for themselves and their 
families. They wanted a safe space to 
develop skills for employment and edu-
cation and expanded Mi Casa to include 
business 
development—delivering 
training for low-income entrepreneurs 
who just needed an opportunity. 
Today, Mi Casa is a pillar for women, 
Latinos, or anyone looking for business 
or career support in the Denver metro 
area. 
In the midst of the devastating pan-
demic, Mi Casa launched 45 new busi-
nesses, supported 45 Coloradans pivot 
to new careers, and reached more than 
1,800 
people 
overall. 
The 
trans-
formational impact of Mi Casa on our 
community cannot be understated. I 
commend them for their remarkable 
work, and I congratulate Mi Casa Re-
source Center on their 45th anniver-
sary. 
COMMUNITY CHURCHES 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the efforts of 
several churches in my district that 
worked tirelessly to provide relief, sup-
port, and resources to their commu-
nities during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
They hosted food banks for those in 
need, provided financial help to those 
struggling to make ends meet, and 
sought out opportunities to support the 
social, spiritual, and emotional needs 
of members. 
Our community is better because of 
them, and I recognize the volunteers 
who sacrificed their time, energy, and 
own well-being to provide relief to 
those who needed a lifeline extended to 
them. In a time of fear, they built a 
network of hope. 
I thank the staff, volunteers, and 
members of Mosaic Church, Friendship 
Church, Word in Action Church, City of 
God Church, Confluence Ministries, Or-
chard Church, Northern Hills Church, 
Colorado Multiethnic Coalition, Re-
newal Christian Center, and Hard Rock 
Church. 
The impact of this outreach in our 
communities is profound. I commend 
all involved for their ongoing effort to 
ensure that no one gets left behind. 
CELEBRATING DOUGLAS COUNTY 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Douglas County in 
Colorado’s Sixth District for being 
named the second healthiest county in 
the United States by the U.S. News & 
World Report. 
With all due respect to the rest of my 
colleagues, there is no State like Colo-
rado. We are home to 300 days of sun-
shine, the Rocky Mountains, world- 
class outdoor recreation, and excep-
tional small businesses. 
In a year defined by a devastating 
public health crisis, our State added 
another accomplishment: community 
health. 
With six of America’s top 257 health-
iest communities in Colorado, Douglas 
County ranks second. Home to count-
less walking trails, community-build-
ing events, and innovative infrastruc-
ture solutions, Douglas County is a 
great place to live. 
So come out to see what it is all 
about. I invite my colleagues to visit 
Douglas County and the rest of my in-
credible district to see for themselves 
what makes the Centennial State one 
of a kind. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF VITA LANTZ 
BROWN 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the career of 
Vita Lantz Brown. In Arapahoe Coun-
ty, the saying goes: If you want some-
thing done, ask Vita. And, if Vita asks 
you to do something, you just can’t say 
no. 
A force for change in our community, 
Vita’s faith drives her devotion to good 
government and diverse leadership. 
Vita is civic-minded and is committed 
to ensuring elected officials at every 
level are working to better the commu-
nity. 
She devotes her time and energy to 
many organizations, including Moms 
Demand Action, the Aurora NAACP, 
and countless others. As a servant 
leader, she also supports her commu-
nity by providing free babysitting, tu-
toring for children, volunteering at a 
local school, feeding the homeless, and 
serving as deaconess at Macedonia Bap-
tist Church. 
Vita’s life work is inspired by 2 Tim-
othy 4:7: 
I have fought a good fight, I have finished 
the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is 
in store for me the crown of righteousness. 
I thank Vita for her exemplary lead-
ership, expertise, and commitment to 
our community. 
30TH ANNIVERSARY OF AURORA NAACP 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the 30th anni-
versary of Aurora, Colorado’s NAACP 
branch. 
In 1991 Dr. Barbara Shannon-Ban-
nister founded the Aurora branch as an 
important step in a long career devoted 
to civil rights. She built upon the leg-
acy of her father’s work in her home-
town of New Orleans and later moved 
to Wyoming where she helped form the 
NAACP Wyoming chapter. 
She recognized a need in Aurora. 
Though Aurora was one of Colorado’s 
fastest growing cities, it lacked essen-
tial advocacy on civil rights issues. 
Dr. 
Shannon-Bannister 
addressed 
this gap by creating the Aurora branch 
of the NAACP. 
I extend my gratitude to Dr. Shan-
non-Bannister, current president Omar 
Montgomery, and all who have dedi-
cated their time and expertise to the 
Aurora NAACP over the last 30 years. I 
thank them for their commitment to 
the residents of my district and for 
continually working toward this cru-
cial mission. 
f 
SERGEANT GEE COMMEMORATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today with 
great remorse. Two weeks ago, U.S. 
Sergeant Nicole Gee, a marine from 
Roseville, California, was tragically 
killed in action during the August 26 
bombing at the Kabul International 
Airport in Afghanistan. 
As a physician of 30 years, I have 
written hundreds of letters to families 
whose loved ones have passed away. 
The letters that I wrote to Sergeant 
Gee’s family were amongst the hardest 
I have ever written. She gave her life in 
service and sacrifice to our Nation 
alongside 12 other marines and beloved 
U.S. servicemembers, all of whom we 
remember fondly with admiration, ap-
preciation, and a deep and humble re-
spect. 
Just a few days prior, Sergeant Gee 
commented upon her life as a marine, 
and she said: ‘‘I love my job.’’ 
Prior to her mission in Afghanistan, 
Sergeant Gee had been a maintenance 
technician assigned to Combat Logis-
tics Battalion 24 of the 24th Marine Ex-
peditionary Unit. Her unit was based 
out of the Marine Corps Base Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina, in my dis-
trict. 
I know I can speak for everyone in 
eastern North Carolina and the Camp 
Lejeune community in offering our 
most sincere condolences to Sergeant 
Gee’s husband, fellow marine Jarod 
Gee, as well as her family and loved 
ones during this extremely difficult 
time. 
Sergeant Gee’s bravery, empathy, pa-
triotism, and unwavering commitment 
to others will never be forgotten. Her 
willingness to put herself in harm’s 
way to protect her country and the 
cause of freedom is the most selfless 
act one can commit, and words are not 
enough to convey our district’s sadness 
and our gratitude. 
As a female marine, Sergeant Gee 
represented one of the fewer, one of the 
prouder. Women make up less than 10 
percent of the Marine Corps, but these 
women carry the same flag, fight the 
same fight, and bleed the same red 
blood as their brothers on the battle-
field. 
Sergeant Nicole Gee’s selflessness re-
minds us of the many sacrifices our 
women in uniform make for our coun-
try every day. We will never forget her

sacrifice or the sacrifices of her broth-
ers and sisters in arms. 
Importantly, she will always be re-
membered for her compassion and 
grace. Most Americans have seen this 
iconic photo of Sergeant Gee cradling 
and comforting an Afghan child at the 
Kabul Airport. This image is just a 
snapshot of her outstanding commit-
ment to others as her loved ones and 
fellow marines remember Nicole as an 
outstanding person who always had a 
positive attitude and never failed to 
put a smile on everyone’s face. 
b 0915 
Her dear friend, Marine Sergeant 
Mallory Harrison, recently took to so-
cial media to say: ‘‘I find peace know-
ing that she left this world doing what 
she loved. She was a marine’s marine. 
She cared about people. She loved 
fiercely, and she was a light in this 
very dark world.’’ 
One infantry marine who served in 
Afghanistan with her, Rowdy Woods, 
wrote: ‘‘Nicole loved what she was 
doing out here and she knew the risks. 
She did it anyway because she is and 
forever will be one badass marine.’’ 
For 2 weeks, residents and visitors in 
Onslow County have been paying their 
respects to Sergeant Gee and her 12 
fallen 
comrades 
outside 
of 
Camp 
Lejeune. 
Thank you to all the military fami-
lies and other community members for 
adorning the gates of Camp Lejeune 
with flowers, meaningful signs, and 
combat boots. 
The outpouring of love and support 
that I have seen in the Third District is 
a true testament to the epic legacy 
that Sergeant Gee and all of our other 
lost U.S. servicemen now leave behind. 
It is an honor to represent the ma-
rines in my district. They represent 
the very best amongst our steadfast pa-
triots, risking everything to preserve 
life and liberty for our great Nation. 
Their commitment is unmatched. 
I, again, extend my sincere condo-
lences to Sergeant Gee’s family, her 
friends, her fellow marines, and others 
who were touched by her wonderful life 
and valiant service. There is a true 
void in her absence. Sergeant Gee will 
be missed, but her sacrifice will never 
be forgotten. 
f 
BLACK LIVES MATTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, as a liberated Demo-
crat, unbought, unbossed, in the spirit 
of Shirley Chisholm. And I rise, not as 
a part-time freedom fighter, but a full- 
time freedom fighter. I don’t do it just 
because it is convenient, just because 
it is the issue du jour. I do it because 
I was born into the struggle. I didn’t 
enlist at a later time in life. 
As a full-time freedom fighter, I rise 
today, Madam Speaker, because Black 
lives still matter; and they matter, 
Madam Speaker, wherever they happen 
to be. They matter, not because they 
happen to be in the United States. 
They matter if they are in Haiti. Black 
lives matter. 
I have been to Haiti. I have seen the 
conditions there. We need to do some-
thing about our friends in this hemi-
sphere. And if they matter in Haiti to 
me, surely they matter at the southern 
border. 
Black lives matter wherever they 
are. Black lives matter regardless as to 
who is in power. They still matter. 
Changes in the power structure don’t 
change the circumstances. And as long 
as the circumstances exist, Black lives 
still matter. 
And as a 74-year old Black man, when 
I see men in uniforms, acting under the 
color of law, on horses, using the reins 
of the horses to do what was com-
parable to that which was done when 
you were trying to capture a runaway 
slave, or you were herding slaves in a 
given direction, Black lives matter. 
When I see that, I find it more than ap-
palling. It is sinful. It is something 
that we cannot tolerate. 
And you just can’t say, well, the cir-
cumstances are so bad that we have to 
use horses now to run down Black peo-
ple. Black lives matter. That kind of 
behavior is intolerable. And when I see 
it, I am going to speak up and speak 
out. 
So here is what I am going to do 
about it. I am not just going to say 
Black lives matter. I want justice for 
the Haitians. 
I remember when we had a policy to 
help the Cubans come into this coun-
try. By the way, I never opposed it. But 
the policy was wet foot, dry foot. You 
get one foot on dry land, your other 
foot could be in the Gulf of Mexico, and 
you had the right to take that other 
foot out of water, go on into Miami and 
start a life in this country and eventu-
ally become a citizen. I never opposed 
that policy. We didn’t have a similar 
policy for the Haitians. 
And I remember when Castro opened 
up the jails and let the criminals come 
down to Florida, we didn’t send them 
back. 
Black lives matter. It is not just a 
slogan for me. So here is what I am 
going to do. I am going to draft a reso-
lution condemning what we saw. 
We need to know whether Black lives 
matter to this Congress. We need to 
know. I am going to draft a resolution. 
And for those who don’t understand 
the rules, these kinds of resolutions are 
not privileged, so I can’t just bring it 
to the floor and demand a vote. So I am 
going to ask that it be allowed to come 
to the floor because Black lives mat-
ter. 
And we need to vote. We need to 
know where people stand on the great 
issues of our time. This is an issue of 
all time; it is not just today. We need 
to know where people stand. We need 
to vote. 
There are a lot of things that we need 
to vote on. We need to know where peo-
ple stand when it comes to Black lives, 
and all lives, I might add, but this is 
the Haitian issue that we are dealing 
with now. 
I have fought for the other persons 
who have come to the border. I spoke 
up when little girls were being ripped 
away from their mothers’ arms, so I 
am not new to this fight. 
And I want to assure you that I am 
going to bring the resolution to my 
colleagues, and we will find out wheth-
er Black lives matter to this Congress. 
f 
10TH ANNIVERSARY OF RUTHIE 
KINDNESS’ DISAPPEARANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to a cit-
izen of the great State of Washington, 
to share her story and to, once again, 
urge my colleagues to make it a pri-
ority for this Congress to end the crisis 
of missing and murdered indigenous 
women. 
Ruthie Kindness, a native woman of 
the city of Parkland, turned 31 just 
last month. Unfortunately, for her 
family and her loved ones, they spent 
her birthday just as they have over the 
last 10 years, without Ruthie, with no 
idea where she is, or even if she is 
alive. 
Ruthie disappeared on February 7, 
2011. For over a decade, her family has 
gone 
without 
answers, 
and 
little 
progress has been made in the inves-
tigation. 
Ruthie’s story is unacceptably com-
monplace for our tribal communities. 
She is one of nearly 6,000 women, 
Madam Speaker, that we know of who 
have been a victim of this crisis. 
Native American and Alaska Native 
women face a murder rate that is 10 
times higher than the national aver-
age. Many of their cases go unresolved 
for years or even decades, as with 
Ruthie’s case. 
We made critically important strides 
in addressing the crisis when President 
Trump signed Savannah’s Act and the 
Not Invisible Act into law just last 
year. But Ruthie and the thousands of 
women whose cases remain unresolved 
underscore that our work here is not 
yet finished. 
The life of Ruthie Kindness matters. 
Her family’s grief matters. The hole 
left in her community by her dis-
appearance, that matters. Finding an-
swers for them, delivering justice for 
Ruthie, and ending this threat for in-
digenous women once and for all, that 
matters. 
I call on each and every Member of 
this body to join me in renewing our 
commitment to our Native commu-
nities, and to delivering a lasting solu-
tion to protect these women from the 
disproportionate rates of violence that 
they suffer. 
If anyone has any information about 
Ruthie’s disappearance, please call the

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Blessed be Your glorious name, and 
may it be exalted above all blessing 
and praise. You made the heavens and 
all their starry host, the Earth and all 
that is on it, the seas and all that is in 
them. You give life to everything. 
Almighty God, how humbling it is to 
consider how You are indeed the source 
of our lives and all that surrounds us. 
Truly, when we consider the whole of 
life—not just our own affairs, not just 
today’s concerns—but the very exist-
ence of the universe, how can we not 
yield our whole selves to Your care and 
direction? 
So we ask that You, in Your mercy, 
would receive our prayers and forgive 
our indifference to Your authority; our 
arrogance that convinces us that our 
rightness exceeds Your righteousness; 
our wandering hearts which cause us to 
explore our personal liberties and ig-
nore Your law; our stubbornness which 
refuses to see the good in the other and 
disregards the God in their soul. 
Our God, may we bind ourselves to 
You this day. May we repent from our 
follies and remain ever faithful to Your 
covenant and steadfast love. 
In the mercy of Your name, we pray. 
Amen.

BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
over the past week we have seen tragic 
images coming from Del Rio, Texas. 
Caravans of migrants wading across 
the Rio Grande. Families sleeping 
under bridges. Border Patrol who are 
overworked and overwhelmed. 
These images don’t show a border 
under 
control, 
as 
President 
Biden 
promised. Instead, they are a picture of 
chaos, incompetence, and crisis. 
When President Biden picked Vice 
President Kamala Harris to be border 
czar, he assured us she was ‘‘the most 
qualified person to handle the job.’’ He 
also said she had a plan to ‘‘stem the 
surge of migrants.’’ 
Was the plan to dismantle Title 42 
and return to Mexico, which would 
have prevented this crisis? 
Was the plan to release hundreds of 
thousands of migrants into the country 
each month without a COVID test? 
Was the plan to effectively give the 
cartels control over the border and dis-
rupt local communities? 
If that was her plan, we can’t afford 
it anymore. This is more than a dis-
aster; it is a direct threat to Ameri-
cans’ safety. 
The Vice President often says we 
need to examine root causes to solve 
the border crisis. Well, the chaos in Del 
Rio confirms that the root causes are 
Democrats’ radical immigration poli-
cies. It is time for Congress to hold this 
administration accountable and secure 
the border. 
We need to hear from those respon-
sible for this failure, starting with the 
Vice President. Right now, it seems she 
is more interested in visiting talk 
shows and football games than visiting 
the border. 
Madam Vice President, this isn’t a 
news cycle to hide from, it is a humani-
tarian, national security, and public 
health crisis that must be stopped. 
The American people need action and 
answers, not the largest amnesty plan 
in American history. Do your job be-
fore the crisis gets even worse. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair.

NATIONAL DEBT 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, later 
this afternoon the House is set to con-
sider a continuing resolution on the 
Federal budget. Instead of taking time 
to hold meaningful discussions about 
budget offsets and reforms, Speaker 
PELOSI released bill text less than 24 
hours before the scheduled vote. 
Make no mistake, Speaker PELOSI 
and House Democrats have no interest 
in reining in Washington’s outrageous 
spending or addressing our national 
debt, now well over $28 trillion, which 
our children and grandchildren will 
have to repay. 
Earlier this year, House Democrats 
rammed through a partisan appropria-
tions package that cracked the door 
open for their far left priorities. Today, 
they are blowing the hinges off that 
door and setting the stage for their $3.5 
trillion tax-and-spend package, which 
will devastate America’s families and 
send the skyrocketing inflation soaring 
to even greater heights. 
That is not responsible. That is not 
good governance, and it is certainly 
not good stewardship of Americans’ 
taxpayer dollars.

RECOGNIZING WORLD 
ALZHEIMER’S DAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sep-
tember 21 as World Alzheimer’s Day. 
Alzheimer’s is a cruel disease that at-
tacks a person’s quality of life. People 
living 
with 
Alzheimer’s 
lose 
their 
memories, their independence, their re-
lationships, and ultimately their lives. 
Beyond the patients, caregivers and 
loved ones endure immense emotional 
and financial difficulties. In 2019, 16 
million Americans provided 18.5 billion 
hours of unpaid care for a loved one liv-
ing with Alzheimer’s disease or other 
forms of dementia. 
At this very moment, as I am speak-
ing on the floor, another American has 
developed this deadly illness. We have 
the resources and the great scientific 
minds to find a cure for Alzheimer’s. 
We must invest to find innovative 
treatments and cures. Americans de-
serve a healthcare system that can 
treat Alzheimer’s better than we do 
today. 
In honor of those who have battled 
and continue to battle this disease, 
let’s work together to raise awareness

A RADICAL ASSAULT ON THE 
SANCTITY OF LIFE 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3755, 
the deceitfully named Women’s Health 
Protection Act. This legislation con-
stitutes a radical assault on the sanc-
tity of life and the dignity of the most 
vulnerable Americans. 
I am grieved and shocked beyond 
words that Democrats are moving to 
force States across the country to ac-
cept abortion on demand, right up 
until the moment of birth. Along with 
so many Americans, I believe that life 
is beautiful, and that all babies must 
be given the opportunity to thrive. And 
yet, my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle want to eradicate every legal 
protection these little ones have, rath-
er than welcoming them with the love 
and joy and hope that they deserve. 
This bill gives abortionists the abil-
ity to decide which precious infants are 
‘‘viable’’ 
and 
worthy 
of 
life. 
It 
prioritizes the profitability of the abor-
tion industry over genuine and compas-
sionate care for mothers and children. 
No baby should be discarded because 
they were allegedly unwanted, and no 
mother’s needs should be subjugated to 
the demands of the abortion lobby. 
This is an incredibly urgent time in 
our Nation. I implore each and every 
one of my colleagues to stand up and 
fight for those who cannot protect 
themselves. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on H.R. 3755. 
f 
IMPORTANCE OF CARING FOR OUR 
SENIORS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of pro-
visions of the Build Back Better Act 
that will help substantially our seniors 
in western New York. 
The bill moving through the House 
recognizes the importance of human in-
frastructure, of care infrastructure, 
and this includes making big invest-
ments in our seniors. 
The bill provides Medicare coverage 
for hearing, dental, and vision benefits. 
It provides a Medicaid funding in-
crease so seniors can live safely at 
home. 
It recognizes the importance of care-
givers by providing a tax cut to sup-
port families who struggle to care for 
their loved ones. 
It addresses critical shortages in our 
health workforce so seniors, when they 
are in a nursing home or hospital, have 
access to the best professionals avail-
able. 
And it will cut prescription costs by 
using the leverage of the Federal Gov-
ernment to get a better deal for Medi-
care beneficiaries. 
These are all important investments 
in our seniors and those who love 
them, and they need our support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the provisions as 
Congress moves toward passage. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, every 
day the American people wake up to 
more concerning news at the southern 
border, and they are beyond outraged. 
Thousands of illegal immigrants con-
tinue to overwhelm ports of entry, the 
flood of illicit narcotics continues to 
skyrocket, and yet, this administra-
tion refuses to act. 
Over 1.2 million illegal immigrants 
have been apprehended at the southern 
border since February of this year, and 
in August, President Biden released 
close to 44,000 illegal immigrants into 
the U.S. 
Madam Speaker, this is yet another 
failure that President Biden can add to 
his growing list. If this administration 
does not act with a sense of urgency, 
America’s communities are in danger. 
It is time for action. 
f 
EXPANDING JOB TRAINING PRO-
GRAMS 
AND 
LOWERING 
THE 
COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, this 
weekend, I ran into a constituent 
whose story is a model for what we 
plan to deliver for more Americans 
through the Build Back Better Act. 
I met a mom in Media, from a solid 
middle-class family, and she was so ex-
cited to share the news about her son’s 
new job. After completing the new 
maritime career development program 
at Delaware Community College, he at-
tended a job fair and landed one of the 
new jobs at the Philadelphia shipyard, 
where he will be making $27 an hour 
and receiving full benefits. 
The Build Back Better Act will ex-
pand these kinds of opportunities and 
make them available to more Ameri-
cans. It will expand job training pro-
grams and lower the cost of higher edu-
cation by funding 2 years of tuition- 
free community college and increasing 
the value of Pell Grants. 
Using our Nation’s network of com-
munity colleges as the pipeline, this 
bill will help connect more Americans 
to good paying jobs. 
The policies in the Build Back Better 
Act are urgently needed, they will 
strengthen our economy, and they are 
popular. It is time to deal working peo-
ple back in. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
STEVE HEPP 
(Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute and cele-
brate the life of Steve Hepp, who 
passed away after a hard-fought battle 
with cancer. 
Steve dedicated almost his entire life 
to public service. He enlisted in the 
United States Marine Corps after he 
graduated from high school, where he 
served proudly from 1972 until 1976. 
This was just the beginning of his life-
time of dedicated public service. 
Steve continued to serve the Water-
town community in southeastern Wis-
consin in plentiful and meaningful 
ways on numerous city committees. 
But I would be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion what he is remembered most fond-
ly for, and that is being a small busi-
nessman, and the Silver Eagle Saloon, 
which remains in Watertown and is op-
erated by his family. 
I invite the Watertown community to 
raise a glass to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Steve Hepp for his resolute 
patriotism, his unparalleled contribu-
tions to those around him, and his un-
dying love for his wife Sue, his daugh-
ters Shae and Summer, and his grand-
children Carlos and Jocelyn. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my heartfelt 
condolences to his family and to any-
one who called Steve their friend. He 
will be sorely missed. 
f 
BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, almost 
exactly 8 months ago Joe Biden kicked 
off his presidency by signing an execu-
tive order that weakened our border se-
curity and promised a pathway to citi-
zenship for millions of illegal immi-
grants. These actions and his reversal 
of the previous administration’s poli-
cies have directly led to the worst ille-
gal immigration crisis the United 
States has faced in decades. 
Since the President took office, at 
least 1.2 million illegal aliens have 
crossed our border and the numbers are 
getting worse. 
His response? Continuing to double 
down on the current failed policy. 
Just last month, nearly 209,000 illegal 
aliens were encountered crossing the 
border, which is a 317 percent increase 
from August 2020. On top of this, Au-
gust marks the sixth straight month of 
illegal crossings, over 170,000 migrants. 
The latest saga, more than 12,000 mi-
grants living in makeshift encamp-
ments under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas.

HARRIS, have been missing in action. 
For the sake of all involved, more

b 1600 
TEXAS ANTI-ABORTION LAW 
(Mr. RASKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in very strong support of the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. 
Today in Texas a law has been put 
into place that transforms essentially 
everyone in the country into potential 
bounty hunters who can go and collect 
$10,000 by reporting on doctors, nurses, 
or family members who helped a 
woman 
exercise 
her 
constitutional 
right to seek an abortion in consulta-
tion with her physician. 
There is not even an exception for 
rape and incest under the draconian 
Texas anti-abortion law. A 15-year-old 
girl could be raped by her farther or 
her uncle and then have her mother go 
and take her to get an abortion, and 
the rapist—her father or uncle—could 
sue them for $10,000. Or anybody could 
sue them for $10,000. 
We need to codify Roe v. Wade and 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey to guar-
antee 
the 
constitutional 
rights 
of 
women against the new onslaught 
against reproductive freedom and wom-
en’s healthcare in the United States. 
f 
OPPOSING THE ABORTION ON 
DEMAND UNTIL BIRTH ACT 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my strong opposition to 
the Democrats’ abortion on demand 
until birth act, because as a father of 
four and foster parent, I am reminded 
each day that every life is precious and 
must be protected. 
For me, a huge part of my pro-life 
story is my son Isaac. Isaac was born 
with Down syndrome, and he brings so 
much joy to our family. That is why it 
breaks my heart that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are pro-
moting this legislation that would 
allow for discriminatory abortions on 
the basis of sex, race, and disability. 
It is disgraceful that there are people 
in this very Chamber who don’t believe 
that children like my son deserve the 
right to life. To perform abortion vio-
lence on defenseless babies is unthink-
able, and it is especially horrifying 
that this legislation would allow abor-
tion up until the moment of birth. 
This is not the direction our country 
should be headed, and 80 percent of 
Americans agree. I will be voting 
against the Democrats’ abortion on de-
mand until birth act because this legis-
lation is nothing less than barbaric. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to do the same. 
f 
ARMY STAFF SERGEANT RYAN 
KNAUSS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a photo of United States Army Staff 
Sergeant Ryan Knauss. He was one of 
the 13 servicemembers killed outside 
the Kabul Airport on August 26. 
Staff Sergeant Knauss grew up where 
I live in Corryton, Tennessee. He al-
ways dreamed of joining the American 
military and did so after graduating 
from Gibbs High School. 
When the Taliban rapidly took con-
trol of Afghanistan last month, it cre-
ated a dangerous situation for Amer-
ican citizens and our allies in the coun-
try. In response, our military ramped 
up its presence at Hamid Karzai Inter-
national Airport to assist with the 
evacuation 
efforts. 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Knauss, who previously served a 9- 
month deployment in Afghanistan, vol-
unteered to go back for this mission. 
Outside that airport was where Staff 
Sergeant Knauss would selflessly give 
his life so civilians could escape to 
safety. He was there helping complete 
strangers, but this wasn’t out of char-
acter for him. He loved helping people, 
and he died doing it. 
Following his death, Staff Sergeant 
Knauss returned home to east Ten-
nessee for a memorial service on Sep-
tember 11. Hundreds from our commu-
nity lined the procession route in 
honor of his heroism. And this after-
noon, at Arlington National Cemetery, 
Staff Sergeant Knauss was laid to rest. 
Look one more time at this picture 
behind me. This is what a true Amer-
ican hero looks like. It is not somebody 
who dribbles a basketball or hits a 
baseball or throws a football or acts or 
sings on stage. Remember the last 
American military casualty from the 
war in Afghanistan. Remember Staff 
Sergeant Ryan Knauss. 
f 
DEBT CEILING 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, since gain-
ing complete control of the U.S. Fed-
eral Government with the presidency, a 
narrow majority in the House, and the 
deciding vote in an equally split Sen-
ate, Democrats have started on a big 
and historic deficit spending spree. The 
national debt exceeds $28.7 trillion, and 
it is growing fast. There is no end in 
sight. 
To continue doing what the govern-
ment has done for decades—recklessly 
spending money with no regard to the 
impact on future generations—is the 
coward’s way out. True leadership 
takes courage. It doesn’t take much ef-
fort to stand here today and tell you 
about how stupid this kind of spending 
is, Mr. Speaker. The real challenge is 
actually doing something about it. 
Writing a budget, passing the budget, 
and appropriating money according to 
the budget is a process we have not 
completed on time since the nineties. 
Secretary Treasurer Janet Yellen re-
cently said that failing to raise the 
debt ceiling risked ‘‘irreparable harm 
to the U.S. economy and the liveli-
hoods of all Americans.’’ 
Ignoring their own Treasury Sec-
retary’s warning, Democrats decided to 
leave the debt ceiling increase out of 
their partisan budget reconciliation 
bill, risking financial disaster for the 
entire Nation. 
I recently led a letter to over 100 col-
leagues asking them to suspend this 
continuing resolution. While the Demo-
crats want to wave a magic wand and 
pretend the debt doesn’t exist, our 
debts are very real. Our Democrat col-
leagues need to do something about 
this.

BLUMENAUER). Members are reminded 
to heed the gavel.

pose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members be 
given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection.

Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this after-
noon, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 667, 
providing for consideration of three 
measures. 
First, H.R. 3755, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act, under a closed rule. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment from Chairman PALLONE, 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for the consid-
eration of H.R. 4350, the National De-
fense Authorization Act, under a struc-
tured rule. The rule self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
SMITH, provides 1 hour of debate on the 
bill equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices, and provides one motion to re-
commit. The rule makes in order 476 
amendments, provides en bloc author-
ity, and provides one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 5305, the Extending 
Government Funding and Delivering 
Emergency Assistance Act, under a 
closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of 
debate on the bill equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and the ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations, and provides one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule provides the majority leader 
or his designee the ability to en bloc 
requested roll call votes on certain sus-
pension bills through September 24. Re-
quested roll call votes on certain sus-
pension bills may be postponed through 
October 1. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same day authority to October 27 and 
provides that the ordering of the yeas 
and nays on the motion that the House 
suspend the rules and pass S. 2382 is va-
cated. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the 
three bills in this rule, H.R. 4350, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2022; H.R. 5305, the con-
tinuing resolution; and H.R. 3755, the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. 
I want to start by recognizing the 
contributions of the North Carolinians 
and all American servicemembers who 
served in Afghanistan over the past 20 
years. Your sacrifices will never be for-
gotten. 
It is in honor of these American he-
roes that I am proud to support the 
Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Au-
thorization Act. This bill invests in our 
servicemembers and their families and 
ensures that the United States is ready 
to confront future threats to our Na-
tion. 
This NDAA provides our men and 
women in uniform with a 2.7 percent 
pay increase; makes critical changes to 
how the military addresses sexual as-
sault; and improves TRICARE coverage 
and benefits, including by removing 
cost sharing for contraceptive cov-
erage. 
I am grateful that three of my 
amendments were made in order. Two 
of these amendments aim to support 
military women and families by requir-
ing reports on access to menstrual 
products and accommodations and on 
potential TRICARE coverage of pre-
conception and prenatal genetic carrier 
screening tests. 
My other amendment expands the 
definition of PFAS to better align with 
the current science. This change will 
help keep our servicemembers and all 
Americans safe from toxic chemicals.

September 21, 2021 
In addition to supporting our mili-
tary personnel, this legislation sup-
ports American innovation through a 
32 percent increase in defense-wide re-
search, development, testing, and eval-
uation. It also ensures that our HBCUs 
and other minority institutions are 
more able to contribute to DOD re-
search and development. 
Finally, this bill continues our com-
mitment to supporting our Afghan al-
lies by authorizing $500 million for the 
Department of Defense to support the 
relocation of at-risk Afghans. 
The continuing resolution included 
in this rule also supports efforts to 
evacuate our allies from Afghanistan. 
Afghans arriving to the U.S. or await-
ing processing overseas need medical 
care, food, housing, and other assist-
ance. This funding will ensure the gov-
ernment agencies involved in the reset-
tlement process have the capacity nec-
essary to help our Afghan allies build 
new lives in safety in the United 
States. 
In addition, the continuing resolu-
tion ensures that our government re-
mains funded, raises the debt ceiling, 
and provides relief to areas devastated 
by Hurricane Ida and other natural dis-
asters. 
Democrat or Republican, we are all 
Americans. We all benefit when our de-
mocracy and economy are healthy, and 
we all suffer when our country is in cri-
sis. 
Every Member in this body was elect-
ed to represent our fellow Americans. 
It would be a dishonor to the trust they 
bestowed upon us if we let the govern-
ment shut down or allow the country 
to default on the full faith and credit of 
the United States. 
This CR will provide much-needed re-
lief to communities devastated by re-
cent hurricanes and other disasters 
like the California wildfires. 
Thousands of homes have been de-
stroyed, and many Americans still 
have limited access to fresh water and 
electricity. Additional delays in relief 
could be the difference between life and 
death. 
Lastly, this rule includes the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, which safe-
guards reproductive freedom for people 
across this country. 
Roe v. Wade has been the law of the 
land for nearly 50 years. With this bill, 
the House is stepping in following the 
Supreme Court’s failure to uphold dec-
ades of American jurisprudence. 
This bill affirms what our Constitu-
tion and international human rights 
bodies have long upheld: that access to 
reproductive care is central to health 
and equality. A woman living in Texas 
should have the same access to care as 
a woman living in California. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. ROSS), my good friend, 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my re-
marks in a positive way by discussing 
H.R. 4350, the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. I am 
glad that this bill has not been 
poisoned by all the partisanship that 
has plagued the House for the past 
year, and that, as they have done for 
the past 61 years, the House Armed 
Services Committee came together and 
produced a bill that both Republicans 
and Democrats can support. We saw 
this in the overwhelming 57–2 vote to 
report the bill out of committee. 
This outcome wasn’t always assured, 
Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, President 
Biden proposed a defense budget num-
ber that was woefully inadequate for 
America’s defense needs. At a time 
when we are facing new and emerging 
threats around the globe, from the 
Middle East, to Afghanistan, to the 
South China Sea, we cannot afford to 
underfund our national defense. 
Chronic underfunding of national de-
fense was a hallmark of the Obama- 
Biden administration, and it appears 
that President Biden himself is deter-
mined to continue down that path. 
Fortunately, both the House and Sen-
ate Armed Services Committees dis-
agreed, and the House now has before it 
a bill that fully funds our defense needs 
for the coming fiscal year. 
The bill before us funds continued ac-
quisition of ships to ensure the U.S. 
Navy can meet its mission. It funds the 
procurement and development of new 
weapons systems, which ensures that 
our military will be well-prepared to 
meet any new and emerging challenges 
in the coming years. And it provides 
our servicemembers with a 2.7 percent 
pay raise. 
And perhaps most important of all, it 
includes many provisions designed to 
provide 
much-needed 
oversight 
of 
President Biden’s bungled withdrawal 
from Afghanistan. America deserves 
answers about the decisions that were 
made and the resulting failures of lead-
ership that occurred at all levels. 
Thanks to this bill, they can be assured 
that they will get them. 
And while I do not support every pro-
vision in the NDAA, I want to applaud 
the good work of the House Armed 
Services Committee. I think their 
process should serve as a model for all 
committees in the House. In an age 
when so much legislation is produced 
by one party behind closed doors in 
leadership offices, the committee did 
the hard work and produced a bill that 
both parties can support. Indeed, it is 
truly refreshing to be considering this 
bill today, and I want to commend 
Chairman ADAM
SMITH
and Ranking 
Member MIKE ROGERS for their good 
work and bipartisan working relation-
ship. 
Unfortunately, the next measure I 
will discuss isn’t nearly so positive. 
This bill is a continuing resolution to 
fund the government through Decem-
ber 3, 2021. But rather than advancing a 
clean, negotiated CR, the majority is 
using the bill as a vehicle to push 
through a suspension of the national 
debt limit. This is a nonstarter with 
Republicans, as the majority well 
knows and, as such, I expect all Repub-
licans will oppose it. 
Since taking control of the Presi-
dency and the Senate in January, the 
majority has been on a spending spree 
unlike any other in our history. Earlier 
this year, the Democrats rammed 
through a partisan $1.9 trillion rec-
onciliation 
bill, 
ostensibly 
about 
COVID relief, but really about pushing 
forward a laundry list of progressive 
policies. 
Last week, 13 authorizing commit-
tees met on another partisan reconcili-
ation bill, this one larded up with a 
whopping $3.5 trillion in progressive 
policies like those found in the Green 
New Deal. And sadly, even that wasn’t 
enough for some committees, who, ac-
cording to the CBO, spent more than 
double what the budget resolution told 
them to. These bloated spending meas-
ures come on top of normal Federal 
spending and on top of the large bipar-
tisan COVID–19 relief packages passed 
last year. 
The last suspension of the debt limit 
covered all the spending that was done 
in the past, along with the first 9 
months of the Biden administration. 
But since then, the majority has 
opened the national checkbook. They 
have done so with only Democratic 
votes. That is their prerogative. After 
all, they control the White House, the 
House of Representatives, and the Sen-
ate. 
But since the majority is spending 
this money over Republican objections, 
and without Republican cooperation, it 
is up to the majority to raise the debt 
limit. They should not expect Repub-
lican votes to help them cover their 
out-of-control spending. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a sad state of af-
fairs that what should be a relatively 
simple measure to fund the govern-
ment is being used in this manner. I 
urge my friends across the aisle to 
rethink this plan, and I hope they will 
come to their senses before government 
funding runs out nine days from now. 
Our last bill covered by this rule is 
somehow even more partisan and con-
troversial than the CR. This is H.R. 
3755, which the majority is pitching as 
a simple codification of the Supreme 
Court decision of Roe v. Wade. In re-
ality, this measure goes far beyond 
that. It is the greatest threat to the 
protection of innocent, unborn life that 
we have seen in over 50 years. 
The bill before us preempts any State 
law that seeks to protect life, including 
policies that those who identify as pro- 
choice support. Instead, every single 
State would be required to allow abor-
tion on demand at any time up to the 
point of birth. 
No more would States be able to pro-
tect conscience rights; no more would 
they be able to ban barbaric procedures 
like dismemberment abortions; and no 
more would they be able to prevent 
abortions targeting fetuses with Down

Syndrome, which 70 percent of the 
American people oppose. 
I would call on all Members, Repub-
licans and Democrats, to reject this 
measure. 
Protecting the unborn has always 
been one of my highest priorities as a 
Member of Congress. We need only to 
look at the Declaration of Independ-
ence for a reminder that the right to 
life is one of those inalienable rights 
endowed upon all of us, even unborn 
children, by our Creator. I urge this 
House to remember those words, re-
member the unborn, and to reject this 
egregious attack on life. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule and two of the underlying bills, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1630 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this rule and its un-
derlying 
legislation. 
Specifically, 
I 
want to highlight H.R. 3755, the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. 
The passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
just a year ago removed the last major 
impediment to an all-out assault by 
conservative extremists on the freedom 
of American women to make their own 
reproductive choices. With the cul-
mination of a decades-long campaign 
to pack the Supreme Court with far- 
right abortion foes, championed by The 
Federalist Society and MITCH MCCON-
NELL, we have seen a tidal wave of leg-
islation and court cases designed to 
overturn the constitutional protections 
outlined in Roe v. Wade. 
Those efforts have included S.B. 8, 
the Texas bill outlawing abortion after 
6 weeks and offering a bounty to vigi-
lantes who seek to enforce that ban; 
the Supreme Court’s refusal to block 
implementation of the Texas law; and 
the Court’s scheduling of a December 
argument in a case that seeks to over-
turn Roe v. Wade. They all dem-
onstrate a clear and present threat to 
women’s reproductive rights in this 
country. 
The decision to have, or not to have, 
a child is deeply personal and may pro-
foundly impact a woman’s mental, 
physical, and financial health and, in 
some instances, her very life. Women 
should have the freedom to make per-
sonal healthcare decisions with those 
they love and the doctors they trust, 
free from undue State interference and 
invasion of the woman’s privacy. 
With increasing attacks on women’s 
reproductive freedom, we are once 
again seeing the urgent need for Fed-
eral legislation to codify Roe v. Wade. 
To ensure that Roe’s protections re-
main, we must absolutely pass the 
Women’s Health Protection Act and 
protect a woman’s freedom to choose a 
safe and legal abortion, no matter 
where she lives. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, 
Mr. Speaker, I will offer an amendment 
to the rule to bring up H.R. 4828, the 
Border Security for America Act, for 
immediate consideration. 
The last couple of days have made it 
plainly obvious that the Federal Gov-
ernment has lost control of our south-
ern border. More than 15,000 migrants 
have set up camp under the Del Rio 
International Bridge. Customs and Bor-
der Patrol have been completely over-
whelmed, to the point that Texas Gov-
ernor Abbott had to take things into 
his own hands and deploy both the Na-
tional Guard and Texas Rangers to stop 
the flow. 
Rather than allowing the President 
to simply fiddle, we must do something 
in Congress to address this unprece-
dented crisis. H.R. 4828 will address the 
ongoing crisis in three ways. It would 
require the immediate resumption of 
construction of the wall at the south-
ern border; it would provide for new in-
vestments in technology; and it would 
ensure an appropriate level of Customs 
and Border Protection officers to fulfill 
CBP’s mandate at all ports of entry 
and along the border. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous materials, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER), my good friend and a 
distinguished Member, to further ex-
plain the amendment. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the previous question. 
There is absolutely no denying that 
there is a crisis at our southern border. 
I spent Saturday in Del Rio, Texas, 
where I would invite everyone in this 
House to go take a look for themselves 
at what I saw, nearly 15,000 people 
crammed under the bridge in unsafe, 
shanty-like structures after bum-rush-
ing our border and getting into this 
country illegally. Meanwhile, the port 
of entry is closed, just a hundred yards 
from this bridge. 
Most of these people are from the age 
of 18 to 35, but I spoke with many chil-
dren, families, and even women who 
were expecting within the next day, 
multiple of whom have given birth this 
past week, all while suffering the swel-
tering heat, 100 degrees during that 
day. 
You cannot fathom the horrific con-
ditions—the rape, the assault, the 
crime, the drugs—right here on our 
border. 
I spoke to migrants who told me that 
the U.S. border is easier to get into 
than that of Mexico, Honduras, El Sal-
vador, and Guatemala. This is unac-
ceptable and is a direct result of the 
Biden administration’s disastrous cri-
sis and policy at our border. 
Just today, senior DHS officials have 
told us that the border is secure. It is 
not. 
I am proud to join with Ranking 
Member KATKO and my colleagues on 
the Homeland Security Committee to 
offer a comprehensive border security 
solutions bill. It is time to stop playing 
political games with our security and 
with our immigration laws. We must 
return to policies that we know work 
to stem the flow of illegal immigration 
and regain operational control of our 
southern border. 
Enough is enough. Something must 
be done. I urge my Democratic col-
leagues to call this what it is, a crisis, 
and to stand for our border security. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD a Military.com article en-
titled ‘‘Defense Bills Would Provide 
New Food Allowance for Low-Income 
Military Families.’’ 
[From Military.com, July 27, 2021] 
DEFENSE BILLS WOULD PROVIDE NEW FOOD 
ALLOWANCE
FOR
LOW-INCOME
MILITARY 
FAMILIES 
(By Patricia Kime) 
A House panel is weighing a $770 billion de-
fense policy bill that includes a provision to 
give lower-income military families a basic 
needs allowance—a stipend that advocacy 
groups say would relieve stress and ‘‘food in-
security’’ among U.S. troops. 
The draft of the House’s 2022 National De-
fense Authorization Act released Tuesday 
contains a provision similar to the Senate’s 
proposal that would provide service members 
additional money for food and other basics if 
their household incomes do not exceed 130% 
of the federal poverty level—which in 2021 
meant $21,960 for a family of three, $26,500 for 
a family of four, and slightly higher for even 
larger families. 
This is the third time the proposal has 
been incorporated into the House defense 
policy bill; unlike previous years, it also has 
been included in the 2022 Senate defense bill, 
increasing the likelihood that it will pass 
later this year. 
For an E–4 with several years in the mili-
tary, a spouse and two children, the stipend 
could equate to roughly $250 extra a month. 
Advocates say the provision is needed as 
junior military service members face the 
stresses of supporting families in areas 
where spouse employment is low or child- 
care expenses make it difficult to pay 
monthly bills. 
‘‘When I got to the [Defense Department], 
I started talking about food insecurity, and 
I really did get a look that said to me, ‘We 
really don’t think we have a problem,’ ’’ 
Patty Barron, deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for Military Community and Family 
Policy, said at an event on military and vet-
erans food insecurity Tuesday. 
The data is mixed on the extent of food in-
security among military families. This year, 
the Defense Department’s Quadrennial Re-
view of Military Compensation found that an 
estimated 880 to 4,690 U.S. service members 
use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, or SNAP, a rate of between .08% 
and .42% of troops. Civilian usage of SNAP, 
also known as food stamps, is 9.6%. 
Critics note, however, that the report 
pulled data from only two months in 2019, 
and the data does not include numbers from 
40% of states, including several with large 
military populations such as California, Ha-
waii and Virginia. 
‘‘The reason we thought we didn’t have a 
problem is, we were looking at the low SNAP 
numbers, and we believe we are compen-
sating our people well, and if not, they will 
promote out of it and get those pay raises to 
solve the problem,’’ Barron added.

‘‘The department is much more aware of 
the issue now, and it is one of Secretary 
[Lloyd] Austin’s biggest priorities,’’ Barron 
said during the discussion hosted by the Cen-
ter For Strategic and International Studies. 
A survey released in May found that nearly 
33% of more than 5,600 respondents at an un-
identified Army installation were considered 
marginally food insecure, meaning they 
faced food hardship or had difficulties ensur-
ing that their food budget stretched through 
the end of the month. 
And according to a report from the organi-
zation MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hun-
ger, one in eight military families experi-
ences food insecurity compared with one in 
10 in the U.S. civilian population. 
‘‘The mental health of our service mem-
bers is key to their long-term connection to 
the military and the well-being of their fam-
ilies, and given that we find service mem-
bers’ mental health is associated with food 
insecurity, addressing food insecurity may 
be one way to address [mental health 
issues],’’ said Matthew Rabbitt, an econo-
mist with the USDA Economic Research 
Service, during the CSIS event. 
The House Armed Services Personnel Sub-
committee will consider its portion of the 
2022 National Defense Authorization Act on 
Wednesday. The bill is expected to be de-
bated by the full committee on Sept. 1 and 
must be reconciled with the Senate’s version 
before it can become law. 
The proposed legislation provides for a 
2.7% pay raise for military personnel in 2022 
and a number of other benefits, including an 
increase in parental leave for service mem-
bers and designated caregivers as well as fos-
ter parents, expansion of the department’s 
in-home, child-care pilot program and the es-
tablishment of an advisory council to sup-
port the services’ Exceptional Family Mem-
ber Programs. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable 
that members of our armed services 
and their families are going hungry. I 
have heard about this in my home 
State of North Carolina, where there 
are food banks associated with mili-
tary bases. 
I am grateful that this 2022 NDAA 
will provide servicemembers additional 
money for food and other basic needs. 
No one in America should go hungry, 
especially those serving our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Biden administra-
tion’s reckless and dangerous policies 
have led to a crisis on the southern 
border, as the illegal flow of drugs, 
weapons, 
and 
people 
continues 
to 
threaten American communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
SPARTZ), my good friend and a distin-
guished Member, to speak more about 
this crisis and solutions contained in 
H.R. 4828. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my enormous dismay 
with the situation at our southern bor-
der. 
I went to the border three times this 
spring and have seen firsthand the es-
calating human and national security 
crisis, but what I have seen from my 
colleagues going to the border this 
weekend is beyond any words. 
Our government is becoming an ac-
complice to human and drug traf-
ficking for Mexican cartels and is com-
pletely disregarding its duty to protect 
the American people. 
I am an immigrant myself and value 
the contributions of immigrants to our 
country over the years, but what is 
happening at the border is an invasion 
of our country and complete lawless-
ness. 
We are not an anarchy. We are a 
country with the rule of law. It is our 
duty as Congress to help the State of 
Texas protect our Republic. It is be-
coming even more urgent in light of 
the Afghanistan debacle and increased 
risk for terrorism. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
consider the Border Security for Amer-
ica Act. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
the time. I also am most appreciative 
to the members of the Rules Com-
mittee, who have devoted an inordinate 
amount of time to bringing this legis-
lation to the floor. 
I am also appreciative for the consid-
eration of three amendments that we 
will have in the NDAA. 
Our first amendment, Homes for He-
roes, requires the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, as well as 
public housing agencies, to improve 
consideration of and reporting on the 
status of veterans. 
Friends, outside of my office in Hous-
ton, there is an overpass. There are 
persons living under that overpass, 
some of whom claim to be veterans. 
We need to know what is happening 
to our veterans in this country. We 
want to make sure everybody is given 
equal opportunities and equal access to 
the opportunities that we have in this 
country. But I especially am concerned 
about 
the 
veterans 
because, 
quite 
frankly, it hurts my heart to hear 
someone say, ‘‘I served my country, 
risked my life,’’ and we find them 
sleeping under bridges. This will give 
us an opportunity to get more informa-
tion on what is happening to them. 
The second amendment is the Uni-
versal Residential Loan Application. 
This amendment will require housing 
enterprises to include a military serv-
ice question on the Universal Residen-
tial Loan Application in a prominent 
position on the form. 
This is done because many of our vet-
erans are not aware of the VA loans 
that are available to them, and we 
want to make sure that before they 
sign that loan application, they under-
stand that there are other opportuni-
ties available to them. 
We also have an amendment that will 
deal with our merchant mariners. This 
amendment requires the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to distribute a pay-
ment to the U.S. merchant marines 
who engaged in qualified service during 
World War II and who have not re-
ceived their just desserts, in the sense 
of something positive, for something 
that they did for this country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, fi-
nally, the private student loan bor-
rowers amendment, I am a cosponsor of 
this amendment with Representative 
ALMA ADAMS. This would extend the 
private student loan forbearance period 
to January 31, 2022, citing the COVID– 
19 pandemic as the rationale. 
I think these amendments are ex-
ceedingly important. They are in this 
NDAA, and I will be supporting it in 
large part because these amendments 
are there, as well as for other reasons 
that I have not been able to discuss 
today. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the crisis at the south-
ern border is affecting communities 
across the United States, but nowhere 
is that more apparent than in those 
communities that are near the south-
ern border. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
TONY 
GONZALES), my good friend and a dis-
tinguished fellow member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, to speak more 
about the need for the Border Security 
for America Act. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on the humani-
tarian and national security crisis hap-
pening as we speak in my district. 
The flood of migrants at the Inter-
national Bridge in Del Rio has high-
lighted the vulnerabilities we have in 
both our immigration system and as a 
Nation. That is why I rise today to 
speak in opposition to the previous 
question. 
We need much-needed commonsense 
reforms to provide the Border Patrol 
with more advanced technology, sup-
plemental boots on the ground, and ad-
ditional support to secure our southern 
border through infrastructure. 
In order to prevent an event like this 
from happening again, there needs to 
be substantial policy changes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the previous question. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, to the 
members of the Rules Committee, I ap-
preciate the hard work that you have 
put into getting this bill to the floor. 
I am only going to speak about one 
issue in this particular NDAA, some-
thing that I have been working on for 
10 years. 
This is a helmet that was given to me 
by sexual assault victims in our mili-
tary. 
Since I started working on this issue, 
200,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and 
airmen have been sexually assaulted in

the military, 20,000 a year. We have 
spent $2 billion on programs in those 10 
years that have yielded us nothing but 
more sexual assaults. 
Finally, in this very bill, we are 
doing what we should have done 10 
years ago. We are taking these cases 
out of the chain of command and mak-
ing the decisions by those who are pro-
fessionals, who are lawyers, who are 
trained, along with the investigators, 
so that we will have a situation where 
sexual assault victims feel like they 
can come forward and file their cases. 
I have had too many servicemembers 
say to me that they were ready to fight 
against the enemy that was outside the 
wire; they never thought the enemy 
was going to be a fellow soldier. 
I am grateful to all my Republican 
and Democratic colleagues who have 
recognized, finally, it is time to put 
their safety first. 
b 1645 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, it should be 
easy to agree that securing our south-
ern border is vital for national secu-
rity. Our next speaker will talk more 
about H.R. 4828 and the need for vital 
security improvements as part of an 
overall strategy to secure and protect 
the southern border. 
I yield 31⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. KATKO), the au-
thor of the bill, and the ranking Repub-
lican member on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question and in support of immediately 
considering legislation I introduced 
with dozens of my colleagues to ad-
dress the deadly, record-breaking crisis 
along the southwest border. 
Specifically, this bill, H.R. 4828, re-
quires the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to secure our Nation’s borders 
through the immediate renewal of the 
border wall project that was initiated 
by the previous administration, major 
investments in security technologies, 
and increased hiring of frontline Bor-
der Patrol agents and Federal law en-
forcement officers. 
The Border Security for America Act 
is a multifaceted solution to secure our 
borders and prioritize the safety of 
Americans. 
As a result of President Biden’s mis-
guided and destructive border security 
policies, there were 208,887 encounters 
along the southwest border in August 
2021. That is a 317 percent increase 
from the previous year. 
August was the sixth straight month 
with more than 170,000 illegal encoun-
ters, a trend never before recorded. In a 
24-hour period on August 1 of this year, 
the U.S. Border Patrol encountered 
over 5,900 individuals from 33 different 
countries trying to cross the border. 
This is not seasonal migration from 
Northern Triangle countries, as this 
administration would have you believe. 
This is a self-inflicted disaster stem-
ming from this administration’s de-
struction of any semblance of border 
security 
that 
began 
on 
President 
Biden’s first day. 
While many of us thought the border 
crisis couldn’t possibly get any worse, 
just this week over 15,000 migrants ille-
gally surged into Del Rio, Texas. 
According to the recently departed 
chief of the Border Patrol, the front 
line is rapidly losing the situational 
awareness required to know who and 
what is entering our homeland. Border 
Patrol has already intercepted known 
or suspected terrorists trying to come 
across the border this year ‘‘at a level 
we have never seen before.’’ 
Illegal immigration is not the only 
threat along the border. This year CBP 
has already seized enough fentanyl at 
the border to kill every man, woman, 
and child in the United States seven 
times over. That is just what we 
caught at the border. Without adequate 
resources and personnel, fentanyl and 
other destructive drugs are able to 
flood into our communities all over 
this great Nation and poison our con-
stituents, as has happened in my dis-
trict in central New York. 
In addition to ensuring preparedness 
along the border, the Border Security 
for America Act would resume con-
struction of the border wall system, re-
quiring the hiring and training of addi-
tional officers and agents to maintain 
an active-duty presence along the 
southwest border—something we don’t 
have right now, an increased number of 
agricultural specialists, K–9 units, and 
support officers. 
We know these policies work and 
that President Biden’s negligence has 
already proven dangerous to our na-
tional security. That is why this bill 
has the support of the National Border 
Patrol Council, which represents 18,000 
frontline Border Patrol agents and sup-
port staff. We are simply trying to pro-
vide the frontline agents with what 
they are asking for. 
I often hear my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, whom I respect, ac-
cuse Republicans of complaining about 
problems without offering solutions. 
Well, here we are, giving you the op-
portunity to vote on a strong, com-
monsense solution to secure our bor-
ders and protect our communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
security of the United States and to 
support our frontline men and women 
by passing this bill. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2022 
NDAA authorizes funding for cyberse-
curity investments in people, pro-
grams, and technology. It directs the 
executive branch to establish a cyber- 
threat information collaboration envi-
ronment 
which 
will 
facilitate 
the 
transmission, sharing, and analysis of 
cyber-threat information, which is so 
crucial, particularly at this time. 
This legislation implements key rec-
ommendations of the National Secu-
rity Commission on Artificial Intel-
ligence by authorizing funding for key 
AI-related initiatives, including invest-
ments in the workforce, emerging tech-
nologies research, and support for our 
small business contractors. 
Additionally, the legislation author-
izes 
funding 
to 
support 
biological 
threat reduction programs, requires a 
publicly available report on threats re-
garding weapons of mass destruction 
by China and Russia, and directs a re-
port on biosecurity efforts across the 
Department of Defense, all needed and 
crucial investments. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my good 
friend, and a fellow member of the 
Rules Committee, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and a member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act in-
cludes a provision requiring women 
now to register for the Selective Serv-
ice. We all know that men have 30 days 
from their 18th birthday to register for 
the Selective Service in case a draft be-
comes necessary. Of course, we also 
know the last draft was during the 
Nixon administration in 1972. 
We are fortunate to have an all-vol-
unteer military force, and we know 
that our citizens unite in times of 
need. The Selective Service System has 
outlived its necessity. 
However, since it remains a require-
ment, we must not fundamentally 
change the relationship between the 
government and the governed by add-
ing a provision to add women to the 
draft in this massive defense bill. 
A change of this magnitude requires 
its own vote by every Member rep-
resenting their constituents. I sup-
ported an amendment to strike this 
language from the bill by the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE), 
but unfortunately the Democrats are 
not permitting its consideration on the 
floor. 
I think this is a mistake. I think we 
should be heard. I think we should be 
transparent, we should be recorded, 
and then let’s get on with the business 
of replacing the Selective Service Sys-
tem. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for her leadership. 
Let me make a proclamation here on 
the floor of the House, that when you 
have the responsibility of governing, 
you govern. 
The President of the United States, 
President Biden, who believes in trans-
formational government, the House 
and the Senate, the House under the 
leadership of Speaker PELOSI, the Sen-
ate under the leadership of CHUCK 
SCHUMER. You govern. Today, we are 
making an enforced, pointed, and open 
statement about governing. 
Let me quickly start with the NDAA, 
the vehicle that helps the men and

women who put on the uniform unself-
ishly on our behalf. I am excited about 
the increase in quality-of-life dollars, 
the raise in personnel salaries, the con-
cern about families. I am increasingly 
excited about cyber protection, and as 
well that we ask the hard questions 
about Afghanistan and how we will not 
see the return of such. But we are not 
afraid to govern by asking those ques-
tions so that we can move forward. 
I am also excited about recognizing 
that the quality-of-life issues for our 
members in the military are impor-
tant. The Jackson Lee amendments 
emphasize those points: 
$10 million to fight triple-negative 
breast cancer impacting our women in 
the United States military, particu-
larly women of color. 
$2.5 million in PTSD. I have heard 
many times we give to PTSD, but it 
keeps growing and growing, and there 
are those in our constituency, our con-
stituents who need these ongoing serv-
ices. I have been working on this for a 
long time. 
To recognize that we must treat our 
men and women that go into the 
United States military academies fair-
ly. Does anyone know that they admit 
people with speech disorders? Good for 
them. But when they graduate, they 
are not given a command. My amend-
ment, that I hope to become law, will 
determine that you analyze all of your 
military students to make sure they 
have a command when they graduate. 
I am most excited about one that I 
will talk about quickly later. 
And then, of course, we have done so 
much great work with the momnibus 
to look at maternal mortality rates for 
military members traveling around the 
world. 
Space debris, to determine how we 
can remediate the risks and outline 
plans to reduce the incidence of space 
debris. 
To be able to ensure that we stop stu-
dents from being recruited when they 
go overseas to be engaged in spy oper-
ations. That happens. And we are glad 
to have that, as well as to begin look-
ing at renaming some of these bases 
after historic African Americans. 
Let me quickly say that amendment 
No. 194 should be one that we all come 
together on, tracing the history of the 
service of African Americans in the 
United States military, particularly in 
slavery, to recognize that they can be a 
vital legacy to the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
will talk further about that as we move 
into the NDAA, but let me talk about 
my original premise of governing. 
The continuing appropriations is cru-
cial, and I support the lifting of the 
debt ceiling not to spend money, but— 
when you have responsibility to gov-
ern, you govern—to pay our bills. Does 
anyone want to suggest that we should 
not? 
I am looking for a few good men and 
women on the other side of the aisle 
that will stand with us as Americans 
and be responsible to our fellow Ameri-
cans, governing, so that we can ensure 
we have a supplemental food program 
and other aspects of it, but we have to 
govern. 
More response to COVID–19. 
And finally, it is important to give 
women back their rights. Roe v. Wade 
is the law of the land, and we are going 
to pass that legislation along with my 
anti-stalking and vigilante bill because 
people are suffering with the Texas 
law. It has no place in society. It is a 
violation of the Constitution of the 
United 
States, 
and 
it 
should 
be 
quashed, with the Roe v. Wade codifica-
tion. I ask the other body to support us 
in that. I ask everyone to support the 
underlying bills. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. JACKSON), my good friend, and a 
distinguished member of the House 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of one of the most important 
bills that comes before Congress, the 
NDAA. This year’s NDAA follows the 
National Defense Strategy by modern-
izing our military, providing a pay 
raise for servicemembers, and restoring 
readiness. 
This legislation will modernize our 
nuclear triad, supporting the work 
done at the Pantex plant in Amarillo. 
The NDAA also includes provisions 
that will support Sheppard Air Force 
Base by funding the new fighter trainer 
and authorizing military construction 
for a new child development center. 
Also included are countless provi-
sions I authored that put servicemem-
bers first and ensure the safety of all 
soldiers, airmen, marines, and guard-
ians. 
The NDAA continues efforts on the 
Future Vertical Lift to make sure we 
have a rotary aircraft that can operate 
in future conflicts with China or Rus-
sia. 
As we consider amendments, I hope 
that this bill remains focused on na-
tional security and can be passed in a 
good-faith manner as we did almost 
unanimously in committee. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS 
for their leadership in putting together 
a bipartisan defense bill. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight an 
amendment that is sponsored by sev-
eral of our colleagues that will be in 
the NDAA and that we will hear more 
about this evening and tomorrow. It 
deals with PFAS, forever chemicals. 
We have debated issues about PFAS on 
this floor, but unfortunately members 
of our armed services sometimes end 
up being human guinea pigs for these 
PFAS. 
This amendment will deal with many 
of these concerns. It directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide DOD med-
ical providers with mandatory training 
with respect to the potential health ef-
fects of PFAS. We have seen this in 
North Carolina, particularly at Fort 
Bragg. 
It requires the EPA to obtain analyt-
ical reference standards for PFAS, for 
the 
development 
of 
protocols 
and 
methodologies and enforcement activi-
ties. 
It clarifies the scope of PFAS data 
reporting from the 2020 NDAA. 
It amends title III, section 318 to 
clarify that DOD must comply with 
safe incineration of PFAS as enacted in 
section 330 of the NDAA of fiscal year 
2020. 
It 
requires 
the 
report 
on 
DOD 
progress to comply with EPA safe 
PFAS disposal guidelines, and it re-
quires that this report be submitted 
one year after enactment of the act, 
and it includes that they report to the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
b 1700 
It requires the report to include the 
actions the DOD has taken to comply 
with that section. It defines the scope 
of prohibition to ensure that PFAS ma-
terials sent to third-parties for disposal 
are also covered by the provisions. 
It expresses the sense of Congress 
that the Air Force has contaminated 
real property with PFOS and PFOA 
chemicals, and it should use existing 
authority to acquire property and pro-
vide relocation assistance. 
It requires a report detailing con-
tamination sites and acquisition and 
relocation status. 
It requires a national primary drink-
ing water regulation for PFAS, and 
clarifies congressional intent by re-
quiring manufacturers to disclose all 
PFAS discharges over 100 pounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER), my good friend and 
the distinguished ranking member of 
the Oversight Committee. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in opposition to certain PFAS- 
related provisions that are included in 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
While it is important to provide fund-
ing for cleanup, it is also critical that 
efforts to regulate PFAS do so in a way 
that defines the chemicals consist-
ently, adequately, and properly as sup-
ported by sound science. In this cur-
rent version of the NDAA, what is de-
fined as PFAS is left open to interpre-
tation or defined under an extremely 
broad definition. 
Broad 
definition 
risks 
subjecting 
thousands of chemicals to unnecessary 
restrictions and create regulatory un-
certainty for numerous products. A few 
products that could fall under this 
overly broad definition include lithium 
ion batteries, semiconductors, refrig-
erants, and medical devices. These 
products that could be impacted, pro-
vide critical benefits to our military

and our broader society and should be 
manufactured in the United States. 
In the NDAA and with all legislation 
it is essential that we properly define 
PFAS up front so that implementing 
regulations can focus on materials 
such as PFOA and PFOS where there is 
scientific 
consensus 
for 
regulation. 
Throughout bicameral negotiations, I 
urge the careful consideration of draft-
ing PFAS definitions that are properly 
focused, targeted, and supported by 
sound science. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
point out some additional benefits of 
this NDAA in dealing with global chal-
lenges. 
H.R. 4350 invests in tools to combat 
the unprecedented challenge of a global 
pandemic, racial inequities, and a deep-
ening climate emergency. 
The NDAA authorizes funding for na-
tional defense and prioritizes programs 
and policies to confront the growing 
threat of China and Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. OBERNOLTE), my 
good friend. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
deeply concerned that the continuing 
resolution we are debating this after-
noon includes a suspension of the limit 
on our national debt through the end of 
next year. 
Our national debt is already at his-
toric levels. In fact, today our national 
debt represents about $85,000 for every 
American man, woman, and child, and 
it is going to get worse. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that at the rate we are going in 
just a few short years that debt will 
more than double, and just paying in-
terest on that debt will consume 10 per-
cent of everything our country makes. 
Every other time we have considered 
raising this debt ceiling that conversa-
tion has been accompanied by a discus-
sion of how we are going to pay that 
money back. But, unfortunately, that 
is not occurring today. 
I have introduced a constitutional 
amendment that would require the 
Federal budget to be balanced, which 
would help us pay down this national 
debt over time. But absent discussion 
of getting our fiscal house in order, it 
is unconscionable to leave that legacy 
of debt to our children and kick the 
can down the road. 
Mr. Speaker, I must urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, there are ad-
ditional wonderful amendments deal-
ing with cybersecurity that are in the 
NDAA. 
We will hear again about another cy-
bersecurity training pilot program for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs for 
veterans and members of the Armed 
Forces transitioning from service to ci-
vilian life. It creates a registered ap-
prenticeship program at the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy focused on cybersecurity and infra-
structure security. Both programs will 
be established in coordination with the 
Department of Defense. 
We know that we do not have enough 
people in civilian life with this cyber-
security training as we face these 
threats like we saw in my home State 
of North Carolina with the Colonial 
Pipeline. 
Having this transition from DOD to 
civilian life and having supportive ap-
prenticeship programs will go a long 
way to fighting cybersecurity. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JACOBS), my good 
friend. 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4350, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
Our Nation faces many challenges in 
the coming years, from the growing 
threat of terrorism brought on by our 
reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan 
to Chinese aggression. 
This bill reverses defense cuts pro-
posed by the Biden administration to 
fund our military and ensure our Na-
tion can counter any threat. 
It also addresses President Biden’s 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan by prohibiting financial support 
to the Taliban and allocating resources 
for counterterrorism operations. 
In addition, it provides our troops a 
pay raise and supports the procure-
ment of essential equipment. 
Finally, the bill includes a bill I in-
troduced to improve retention and 
readiness for providing opportunities 
for reservists, and the rule makes in 
order my amendment that will get 
more small and innovative companies 
access to DOD contracts. 
Mr. Speaker, we face numerous chal-
lenges both today and in the future. 
This legislation prioritizes resources 
for our military at a critical time, and 
I urge its passage. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), my very good friend 
and the distinguished Republican rank-
ing member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding. 
For months, Democrats have been 
pursuing a radical partisan agenda that 
will pile on trillions to our debt, and 
we are here today where they are ask-
ing Republicans to basically help them 
get a loan. 
They are pushing the most expensive 
piece of legislation in the history of 
the United States with the largest tax 
increase in the history of the United 
States. And yet Democrats are de-
manding we hold the door open so that 
they can ram through this partisan 
reckless agenda. 
The debt limit is a chance for Con-
gress to address government spending, 
something we have done since 1985. 
Sadly, today, the Democrats are 
playing chicken with a government 
shutdown by tying the debt ceiling to a 
CR so they can enact their multi-tril-
lion-dollar partisan tax and spending 
plan, which currently clocks in at $4.3 
trillion, no matter the harm it will do, 
no matter how it will fuel more infla-
tion that is crippling family budgets. 
Budget Republicans sent a letter to 
Congressional leaders back in July out-
lining over half a dozen approaches 
Congress has taken in the past to ad-
dress government spending with a debt 
limit increase. 
But they have ignored all of our sug-
gestions, because the fact of the matter 
is my colleagues have one goal in mind, 
an agenda of more spending, more debt, 
and more taxes on working-class Amer-
icans. 
Democrats control the White House, 
they control the Senate, and they con-
trol the House. If they want to spend 
trillions of Americans’ tax dollars, 
they can stand alone and ask for that 
loan. 
But Republicans will not cosign a 
loan for the Democrats’ reckless agen-
da that harms working families, fuels 
more record inflation, and rewards 
their political allies and donors.

MEM-
BERS: As faith-based, religious, and civil 
rights organizations that share a commit-
ment to religious freedom and the separation 
of religion and government, we write to ex-
press our strong and unequivocal support for 
S 1975, the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
We affirm our nation’s founding principle 
of religious liberty, which is integrally 
bound to reproductive freedom. Religious 
liberty includes the right to follow one’s own 
faith or moral code in making critical, per-
sonal reproductive health decisions, without 
political interference. While we respect the 
right of every individual, including our law-
makers, to hold their own personal and reli-
gious beliefs, our country’s Constitution de-
mands that no one impose a single religious 
viewpoint on all through civil law or regula-
tion. The Women’s Health Protection Act is 
essential legislation that embodies these 
shared ideals. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act is ur-
gently needed. The nearly 500 abortion bans 
and restrictions enacted since 2011 have se-
verely reduced or eliminated abortion access

in large swaths of the country and fall hard-
est on those who already face barriers to ac-
cessing 
health 
care—including 
women; 
Black, Indigenous, and People of Color 
(BIPOC); those working to make ends meet; 
members of the LGBTQI+ community; immi-
grants; young people; those living in rural 
communities; and people with disabilities. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act is an 
important bill that would enact protections 
on the federal level to safeguard access to 
high-quality care and to secure constitu-
tional rights by protecting patients and pro-
viders from political or religious inter-
ference. 
Rather than face onerous barriers due to 
their economic status, employment status, 
or zip code, this bill would ensure that each 
person can make a decision about abortion 
led by their own circumstances, faith, or be-
liefs. It would also protect the religious lib-
erty of individual health care providers seek-
ing to administer quality care to their pa-
tients and enable providers to deliver abor-
tion services free from burdensome restric-
tions designed to impede access rather than 
improve patient health. 
We believe in compassion, justice, and dig-
nity for all, compelling us to speak out for 
social justice and the right of every person 
to access comprehensive, affordable, and eq-
uitable reproductive health care. A compas-
sionate nation ensures equal access to qual-
ity, timely health abortion care for every-
one, an essential factor to social and eco-
nomic participation, reproductive and moral 
autonomy, and the right to determine our 
own lives. In contrast, laws that limit the 
availability of abortion disrespect human 
dignity, erode constitutional rights, exact 
far-reaching 
health 
and 
economic 
con-
sequences, and ignore the moral agency of 
physicians seeking to provide compassionate 
care. 
Furthermore, laws that eliminate options 
for some based on their geographic location 
are profoundly unjust, pushing care out of 
reach for the most marginalized among us. 
We cannot remain idle as state laws trans-
form our country into a map of ‘‘haves and 
have-nots’’ with regard to access to repro-
ductive health services. We call on Congress 
to pass Women’s Health Protection Act to 
protect access to abortion and to help us 
build a society where all can participate 
equally and thrive in our communities with 
dignity. 
Every day, we support equal, fair, and com-
prehensive access to health care and respect 
for personal decision-making. We support 
the Women’s Health Protection Act as a 
means to this end and urge you and your col-
leagues to do the same. The 117th Congress 
must act in solidarity with people and com-
munities fighting for racial, economic, and 
reproductive justice and commit to pro-
tecting the right of every person to make 
their own decisions about their bodies, free 
from discrimination and political inter-
ference. It is the right thing to do.

Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD a letter from the National 
Nurses United, dated September 21 ex-
pressing their resounding support for 
H.R. 3755. 
The letter states: ‘‘On behalf of the 
175,000 registered nurses represented by 
the National Nurses United, we write 
to you today to endorse the Women’s 
Health Protection Act of 2021 spon-
sored 
by 
Representative 
CHU. 
We 
strongly urge you to vote ‘yes’ on this 
critical piece of legislation when it is 
brought to the floor of the House of 
Representatives.’’ 
NATIONAL NURSES UNITED, 
September 21, 2021. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: National Nurses 
United supports the right of all women and 
people who can get pregnant to full and 
equal healthcare services, including repro-
ductive and family planning health services 
as a fundamental human right. On behalf of 
the 175,000 registered nurses represented by 
National Nurses United (NNU), we write to 
you today to endorse the Women’s Health 
Protection Act of 2021 (HR 3755) sponsored by 
Representative Judy Chu. We strongly urge 
you to vote yes on this critical piece of legis-
lation when it is brought to a vote on the 
floor of the House of Representatives. 
The 
Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act 
(WHPA) establishes a statutory right for 
health professionals to provide abortion care 
without any medically unnecessary restric-
tions or limitations that impede access to 
abortion. With increasing attacks on repro-
ductive rights, it is critical that Congress 
swiftly takes steps to protect access to abor-
tion and reproductive health care. 
Nurses, the majority of whom are women, 
play an essential role in the delivery of re-
productive health services for millions of pa-
tients every day, and we have a duty to advo-
cate for the health and safety of our pa-
tients. Without access to abortion services, 
patients who are pregnant may be at risk of 
illness and death due to pregnancy, or may 
be at risk of avoidable complications from 
unsafe and illegal abortion practices. Fur-
ther, 
access 
to 
quality 
reproductive 
healthcare allows people to make decisions 
for themselves on whether and when to have 
children, an essential component of equality 
that enables full participation in our society. 
Nurses know that unless we bring down the 
barriers to care, people will go without the 
necessary healthcare they deserve. 
The decision to have an abortion is a deci-
sion that should be made between a person 
and their healthcare providers—it is not a 
decision that politicians have any right to be 
engaged in. Patients have the right to seek 
abortion care with the counsel of a trusted 
healthcare provider, regardless of where they 
live, and it is critical that Congress protects 
that right. 
We urge you to stand with nurses and vote 
yes on HR 3755 to protect the right of all peo-
ple to access abortion care and reproductive 
health services.

BONNIE CASTILLO, RN,

DEAR
SENATOR
BLUMENTHAL
AND
REP-
RESENTATIVE CHU: On behalf of the under-
signed medical organizations, representing 
physicians dedicated to advancing the health 
of our patients, thank you for introducing 
the Women’s Health Protection Act (S. 1975/ 
H.R. 3755). The purpose of your legislation— 
to protect the patient-physician relationship 
and preserve the ability of physicians to pro-
vide 
evidence-based 
care 
to 
their 
pa-
tients——is critically important. 
Federal, state, and local lawmakers have 
long played an important role in our health 
care system. The myriad policies aimed at 
addressing the ongoing COVID–19 public 
health emergency provide a prime example 
of legislators acting to improve the health of 
their constituents. However, physician lead-
ers have long raised concerns, including in a 
New England Journal of Medicine com-
mentary nearly a decade ago, about the 
alarming increase in legislators ‘‘overstep-
ping the proper limits of their role in the 
health care of Americans to dictate the na-
ture and content of patients’ interactions 
with their physicians.’’ This overreach has 
taken many forms, including creating unnec-
essary obstacles for patients trying to access 
medically appropriate care, forcing physi-
cians to practice outside the bounds of evi-
dence-based 
medicine, 
and 
criminalizing 
physicians for providing compassionate and 
evidence-based care. The communities most 
impacted by these barriers are those already 
experiencing grave inequities in the health 
care system. The Women’s Health Protection 
Act would address an area of medicine sys-
tematically targeted with government over-
regulation—reproductive 
health 
care—by 
prohibiting these inappropriate restrictions 
and restoring the ability of patients to re-
ceive comprehensive care free from legisla-
tive intrusion. 
Thank you again for sponsoring this im-
portant legislation to prevent legislative in-
terference in the practice of medicine and 
protect the patient-physician relationship.

STATE OF NEW YORK, 
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
June 16, 2021.

Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,

DEAR CHAIRS
AND RANKING MEMBERS
OF 
THE COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE: As the 
Supreme Court has consistently recognized, 
‘‘[t]he ability of women to participate equal-
ly in the economic and social life of the Na-
tion has been facilitated by their ability to 
control their reproductive lives.’’ Accord-
ingly, laws that impose an undue burden on 
a woman’s right to choose to terminate a 
pregnancy are unconstitutional. Nonethe-
less, many states across the country have 
enacted laws in the name of promoting wom-
en’s health that do not, in fact, advance 
women’s health or safety but are instead de-
signed to restrict access to abortion services. 
These include laws requiring physicians have 
admitting privileges at hospitals and setting 
arbitrary requirements at women’s health 
clinics for the size of procedure rooms and 
corridors. As the Attorneys General of our 
respective states, we write in support of the 
Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act, 
which 
would protect the constitutional right to 
abortion by prohibiting medically unneces-
sary restrictions that specifically target 
abortion providers and undermine the avail-
ability of abortion services. 
The 
Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act 
(WHPA) targets onerous state laws that have 
been adopted in a concerted strategy to re-
strict access to abortion. In Whole Woman’s 
Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292 (2016), 
the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas law 
that required abortion providers to maintain 
admitting privileges at a local hospital 
failed to advance women’s health and posed 
an undue burden on women seeking an abor-
tion. Last year, a coalition of 22 attorneys 
general helped to win another victory in 
June Medical Services v. Gee, 140 S. Ct. 2103 
(2020), in which the Supreme Court held that 
a similar law in Louisiana was unconstitu-
tional. Rather than waiting for medically 
unnecessary restrictions to continue to be 
challenged in the courts—a process that can 
often take years—Congress should pass the 
WHPA to ensure that such restrictions are 
not imposed in the first place. Medically un-
necessary restrictions targeting abortion 
providers actually disserve women’s health 
and safety and pose challenges for states 
that aim to provide a full range of reproduc-
tive health services, including abortion serv-
ices. 
Often, strict requirements imposed on 
abortion providers are presented as measures 
to protect and advance women’s health. Yet 
evidence shows that these restrictions in-
stead lead to worse health outcomes for 
women. One recent study in Texas found 
that the maternal mortality rate in the 
state doubled between 2010 and 2012, a period 
in which access to women’s health care serv-
ices, including abortion services, had become 
more difficult to obtain. Women who find 
themselves too far from an abortion provider 
may have to delay obtaining an abortion, 
which can. lead to health risks and add to 
the cost of the procedure. Alternatively, 
some women may resort to ‘‘black market’’ 
or self-induced abortions, which can be ex-
tremely dangerous and lead to serious injury 
or even death. And women who are forced to 
carry a pregnancy to term after being denied 
abortion services are four times more likely 
to 
develop 
potentially 
life-threatening 
health conditions and are substantially more 
likely to experience physical violence from 
abusive partners or family members. These 
statistics illustrate the very real cost to 
women throughout the United States from 
burdensome laws that restrict the avail-
ability of safe and legal abortion care. The 
widely known negative effects of laws tar-
geting abortion providers undermines any 
argument that such laws are intended to pro-
mote women’s health. 
At the same time, the consequences of 
these laws are already evident across the 
country. Research from 2017 found that thir-
ty-eight percent of women between the ages 
of 15 to 44 live in counties without an abor-
tion clinic. Between 2014 and 2017, twenty- 
five abortion clinics shuttered in the South 
and the Midwest. As of June 2019, six states 
have only a single abortion clinic remaining. 
As providers close due to the impact of medi-
cally unnecessary restrictions, women are 
likely to be forced to travel farther and 
make greater sacrifices to get access to serv-
ices. Unfortunately, these burdens often fall 
disproportionately on lower-income women 
who cannot afford to travel, take time off 
work, or find childcare in order to get to the 
nearest provider. 
As Attorneys General, we are committed 
to ensuring that each state satisfies its con-
stitutional obligation to protect the right to 
choose to terminate a pregnancy within its 
borders. Among other things, we are deeply 
concerned about protecting the constitu-
tional rights of our residents who may need 
medical care while present as students, 
workers, or visitors in states with dras-
tically restricted abortion access. In addi-
tion, a substantial reduction in the avail-
ability of abortion services in some states 
can cause women to seek medical care in 
other states, thereby straining their health 
care systems. Indeed, history shows that 
many women will cross state lines, if they 
have the means to do so, when abortions are 
unavailable in the states where they live. 
For example, in the nearly three years be-
tween New York State’s liberalization of its 
abortion laws in 1970 and 1973 when the 
United States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade 
ruled that the right to choose was constitu-
tionally protected, close to 350,000 women 
came to New York from other states where 
abortions were entirely or largely unavail-
able.In the wake of recent abortion restric-
tions, some states, including several of our 
own, have experienced a substantial influx of 
out-of-state patients seeking abortions as a 
result of reduced access in their home states. 
Our states stand ready and willing to pro-
vide reproductive care services to those who 
need them. However, a significant and sud-
den increase in patients seeking abortions, 
especially as a consequence of laws that do 
not advance women’s health and decrease 
available services, runs the risk of straining 
the health care systems of less restrictive 
states. This in turn can impair the avail-
ability of care and affect the reproductive

choices of both residents and non-residents 
alike in those states. Our states aim to con-
tinue providing a wide range of reproductive 
health care services, including abortion serv-
ices, but our ability to do so could be sub-
stantially burdened by the responsibility of 
ensuring that all women in need of abortions 
are able to safely obtain one. The WHPA 
would address this problem by safeguarding 
access to abortion services in all states. 
We support the passage of the WHPA given 
how it will help to restore and facilitate ac-
cess to abortion services throughout the 
United States, upholding this critical con-
stitutional right. We look forward to work-
ing with you and your committees as you 
consider this legislation. Please let us know 
how we may be of assistance during this 
process.

Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by 
thanking my good friend from North 
Carolina. We don’t agree obviously on 
the rule, we don’t agree on every piece 
of legislation, but I appreciate the ci-
vility and the quality of the debate. 
Mr. Speaker, to me, as I look at both 
the rule and the underlying legislation, 
the phrase that immediately comes to 
my mind is the good, the bad, and the 
ugly. 
Let’s start with the good. There is no 
question that the National Defense Au-
thorization Act is a product of bipar-
tisan cooperation of the highest order 
on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee. Nobody got everything they 
wanted, but there are a lot of things in 
there that both sides worked together 
on to achieve. I particularly want to 
commend Chairman SMITH and Rank-
ing Member ROGERS for the manner in 
which they approached this bill. I want 
to commend them for the additional 
$25 billion. I know that the chairman 
didn’t support that, but obviously 
many Democratic Members did. I think 
that was an important sign that the 
country is united on the idea that we 
need to spend more on defense in these 
very dangerous times. 
Again, the quality of the compromise 
and some of the legislation that is in-
cluded in this is extraordinarily impor-
tant. The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. SPEIER) mentioned the issue of 
sexual assault. It is addressed in this 
bill in a bipartisan, thoughtful way. I 
thank her for her tireless work on that 
very important subject. 
I also thank those Members that 
worked hard to reposition our defense 
where 
we 
focus 
on 
our 
emerging 
threats, our near-peer threats of China 
and Russia while also dealing with 
North Korea, Iran, and the threat of 
global terrorism. 
It is a good bill. Not everybody will 
support it, but I think it will get over-
whelming support on both sides of the 
aisle, and I look forward to voting for 
it. 
To me, the bad is H.R. 3755. I make 
no bones about it, Mr. Speaker. I am 
strongly pro-life. I have a 100 percent 
pro-life voting record. I respect those 
with a different point of view, but this 
is not a codification of Roe v. Wade. 
This is a radical abortion bill that 
would allow abortion-on-demand in 
every State under almost any cir-
cumstances that the provider of the 
abortion deems appropriate. 
Quite frankly, it is an enormous 
overreach, and it will overturn dozens 
of State laws in many States all 
around the country, laws that have 
been constitutionally approved in the 
past. That is unfortunate, and I think 
many on our side that certainly work 
on women’s health are not going to 
vote in support of abortion-on-demand. 
b 1715 
Mr. Speaker, finally, to me, the con-
tinuing resolution unquestionably is 
the ugly. It is not all ugly. There are 
actually some good things in there. I 
actually commend my friends for vot-
ing to keep the government open. I 
would normally do that as well. No 
partisan debate there, at least not from 
me. 
I also very much support the relief 
for those Americans who have been the 
victims of natural disasters, which is 
contained in the bill. That, too, was ne-
gotiated by the Committee on Appro-
priations. It is an appropriate measure. 
So, too, is the money set aside to 
help those fleeing from the Taliban, 
those who worked with our forces in 
Afghanistan and who now come to our 
country and to other countries seeking 
refuge and support. We should honor 
the commitment and the sacrifice they 
made on our behalf. 
We could have passed a bill like that 
in a united, bipartisan fashion. Indeed, 
the Committee on Appropriations had 
essentially negotiated the deal. Then a 
decision was made by Democratic lead-
ership to interject a debt ceiling reso-
lution without any discussion, any ne-
gotiation, any way to lower that debt 
or offset it or slow it down or reform 
the process. That is what many of my 
friends object to. 
I voted for debt ceiling increases in 
the past under both Republican and 
Democratic 
Presidents. 
I 
certainly 
would be prepared to do so again, but 
not without addressing some of the 
drivers of the debt, and certainly not 
as a sign off on a $3.5 trillion reconcili-
ation bill that is on top of our normal 
appropriations, on top of the bipartisan 
release given and the coronavirus crisis 
thus far. 
That is a stretch too far. My friends 
know that it won’t work, yet we are 
going to kick it over to the Senate, 
where we know the support is not 
there. 
Mr. Speaker, I suspect we will be 
back on this floor dealing with this 
matter again, hopefully in a fashion 
where the two parties can work to-
gether and keep the government open 
and operational. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Following the withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan, we have a solemn duty to 
provide for our servicemembers and to 
keep our promise to our Afghan allies. 
The fiscal year 2022 National Defense 
Authorization Act will do both. 
This NDAA will also invest in our 
Nation’s defense by promoting cutting- 
edge research and development, much 
of which happens at our institutions of 
higher education, such as those in 
North Carolina’s Research Triangle. 
We also must pass the continuing 
resolution in order to support our Af-
ghan allies, provide relief to regions re-
covering from Hurricane Ida and other 
natural disasters, suspend the debt 
limit, and keep our government funded. 
Finally, we must pass the Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act 
to 
enable 
women across the country to access re-
productive healthcare, including abor-
tion care. 
I want to highlight a discrepancy be-
tween the rhetoric and policies of oppo-
nents of reproductive freedom, particu-
larly those from States like mine, in-
cluding Texas. These opponents claim 
to be pro-life, to be working to protect 
families and babies, but almost always, 
these are the same people who oppose 
Medicaid 
expansion, 
universal 
childcare, and the expansion of the 
child tax credit. 
In the United States today, babies 
that do not get prenatal care are five 
times more likely to die than babies 
that do get prenatal care. Prenatal 
care is one of the many critical forms 
of healthcare that Medicaid covers. 
Medicaid also provides postpartum 
care coverage to new mothers, and the 
American Rescue Plan gave States the 
option to extend that coverage from 60 
days to 12 months. Postpartum care is 
key to protecting new mothers from a 
variety of serious conditions that can 
develop after birth. Similarly, uni-
versal childcare and the child tax cred-
it are investments in babies and in 
families. 
Today, in America, supporting chil-
dren and families means supporting 
Medicaid 
expansion, 
affordable 
childcare, tax benefits for families—all 
of which are included in the Build Back 
Better Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question.

creditable as basic pay for retirement or any 
other purpose, that additional pay shall 
not— 
(1) be considered to be basic pay of the cov-
ered employee for any purpose; or 
(2) be used in computing a lump-sum pay-
ment to the covered employee for accumu-
lated and accrued annual leave under section 
5551 or section 5552 of title 5, United States

September 21, 2021 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in support of the Extending 
Government Funding and Delivering 
Emergency Assistance Act, which ex-
tends funding for Federal programs and 
services through December 3. 
With the COVID–19 pandemic still 
raging, amid many other serious chal-
lenges, this bill provides tens of bil-
lions of dollars to support the working 
middle-class families who live pay-
check-to-paycheck. It supports them 
through 
investments 
in 
education, 
health, housing, and public safety pro-
grams, and it ensures that we can con-
tinue to help the most vulnerable. 
Through investments in our schools, 
high-quality job training programs, 
and early childhood education, this bill 
will grow opportunity and uplift hard-
working American families. It will put 
food on the table for those who are 
hungry and provide a roof over the 
head for those who are unhoused. Fi-
nally, it will protect public health and 
safeguard our consumers from dan-
gerous products and unsafe food. 
But let me be clear. This is not a 
long-term solution. It simply allows 
additional time for bicameral, bipar-
tisan negotiations on a final year bill 
for fiscal year 2022. The House has ad-
vanced our process, and we are ready to 
begin negotiations with the Senate as 
soon as we complete work on this legis-
lation. 
As this bill provides critical support 
for our families and communities it 
also addresses recent emergencies that 
require Federal resources and incor-
porates feedback from Members on 
both sides of the aisle. It provides 
emergency 
supplemental 
appropria-
tions to respond to the recent disasters 
caused by climate change and to ad-
dress needs created by the end of more 
than 20 years of war in Afghanistan. 
The climate crisis gave us the devas-
tation of Hurricane Ida and last year’s 
hurricanes, 
recent 
wildfires, 
severe 
droughts, extreme heat, and winter 
storms. As a result, thousands of Amer-
icans across the United States are still 
in great need of assistance and support. 
I am proud that this bill provides $28.6 
billion in desperately needed Federal 
aid, including $7.5 billion for Hurricane 
Ida, so that survivors, small busi-
nesses, and hard-hit communities can 
rebuild and put struggling families 
back on their feet. We provide this re-
lief to virtually all corners of the Na-
tion, because all corners of the Nation 
need our help. 
As we respond to these disasters in 
the United States, we must address hu-
manitarian needs resulting from the 
end of the war in Afghanistan. This bill 
delivers $6.3 billion for urgent humani-
tarian assistance in the region and 
honors our commitment to our Afghan 
allies and their families who are now in 
the United States. It provides funding 
to support temporary housing, security 
screenings, and long-term resettlement 
of these Afghan evacuees. These people 
risked their lives to serve our Nation, 
and it is our moral imperative to pro-
tect them and to help them get back on 
their feet. 
Finally, the legislation suspends the 
statutory debt limit through December 
2022. 
Mr. Speaker, with this bill we are 
doing what is right: supporting work-
ing families and this country. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in reluctant opposition 
to H.R. 5305, a bill that contains many 
critical items, including a continuing 
resolution to fund the Federal Govern-
ment until December 3. 
Over the last month, Republican 
Members of the House and Senate have 
voiced concerns about tying a vote to 
suspend the debt ceiling with a vote to 
keep the government funded. 
It is disappointing, but that is ex-
actly what is happening here today. 
Even if this bill passes the House, we 
know it is going to face strong resist-
ance in the Senate. 
With only a few days left in the fiscal 
year, this decision alone could force us 
into an unnecessary and costly govern-
ment shutdown. 
I do want to thank our committee 
chair, Ms. DELAURO, for working to de-
velop a bill that includes priorities of 
Members on both sides of the aisle. 
In addition to this bill allowing crit-
ical adjustments to be made in govern-
ment programs over the next 2 months, 
we worked together on much needed 
supplemental funding to address hurri-
canes, wildfires, flooding, and other 
impacts of natural disasters. 
Unfortunately, the chair’s good faith 
efforts have been undone by other po-
litical decisions. 
Not only does this bill include lan-
guage to suspend the debt ceiling, the 
funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile 
defense system was removed from the 
bill after it was filed. 
I do not understand why this decision 
was made because it was only 4 short 
months ago that Israel faced rocket at-
tacks on a scale that had never been 
seen before. Israeli civilians would 
have suffered terrible casualties had it 
not been for Iron Dome. 
Iron Dome rocket interceptors need 
to be restored, and that is why funding 
was included as part of the original 
package. 
We should not be turning our backs 
on our steadfast ally at a time when 
they 
continue 
to 
face 
dangerous 
threats from terrorists. The decision to 
pull funding will leave Israel more vul-
nerable. 
In addition to this funding being re-
moved, there are some other items that 
deserve further review as we move for-
ward with the fiscal year 2022 appro-
priations process. 
For example, we must give the De-
partment of Homeland Security the re-
sources it needs to address the histori-
cally high number of migrants flooding 
our borders. 
The situation on the border is the 
worst it has ever been, and we must get 
it under control. 
Putting these issues aside, we all 
know the reality is that we must pass 
a bill to keep the government open. 
There is no time for delay. 
We should not pretend that by con-
sidering this bill on the floor of the 
House today that we will be any closer 
to sending a bill to the President’s 
desk to prevent a government shut-
down. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut for 
yielding, and I want to congratulate 
her for the job that she has done not in 
only passing 9 of the 12 appropriation 
bills that are over in the Senate, 
which, unfortunately, have not been 
considered, and the other three bills I 
know she is working very hard on, 
which would obviate the need for an-
other CR. But we have not done that 
yet, so we must pass this bill. 
There is no job, Mr. Speaker, more 
critical for Congress to perform each 
year than to fund the government. 
Again, I want to thank Chairwoman 
DELAURO and the members and staff of 
the Appropriations Committee and the 
ranking member for their work earlier 
this year to ensure that the House pass 
9 of the 12 appropriation bills. 
As we continue to work with the Sen-
ate to finish that work, it is imperative 
that we adopt this continuing resolu-
tion to keep the government open and 
serving the American people during 
these challenging times. 
The continuing resolution also in-
cludes much-needed emergency funding 
for disaster relief. Communities along 
the Gulf Coast were hard hit by Hurri-
cane Ida, and western States are con-
tinuing to deal with the devastating 
wildfires. 
At the same time, Mr. Speaker, this 
legislation 
also 
includes 
additional 
funding to facilitate the resettlement 
of our Afghan allies and their families. 
It is also essential that we suspend 
the debt limit to prevent a default that 
would trigger an economic catastrophe 
not only here but around the world. 
And this continuing resolution in-
cludes such a suspension. 
In my career over the 40 years that I 
have spent here, Republican and Demo-
cratic Secretaries of the Treasury and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4589 
September 21, 2021 
administrations have urged us not to 
allow the credit and faith of the United 
States of America to fail. 
In years past, Democrats and Repub-
licans came together to address the 
debt limit because we all know how 
dangerous it would be for America not 
to pay the bills it has already incurred. 
This is not for additional spending, this 
is for what we have already spent ei-
ther by spending it on objectives or 
cutting revenues. 
b 1900 
Let me remind everyone what we are 
talking about. This is about paying for 
what we have already bought. A family 
can’t just decide not to pay its credit 
card bill for purchases already made. 
Their credit would suffer—rightfully 
so—making them a risky bet for lend-
ers, who would be justified in charging 
higher payments. 
Now, we played chicken with the 
debt some years ago. It was in the 
early 2010s. The credit of the United 
States for the first time in 100 years 
was put down a notch—the credit of the 
United States of America. In much the 
same way, our country will suffer 
greatly if we do not act now to stave 
off this unnecessary and preventable 
crisis. 
During the previous administration, 
every time the President asked Con-
gress to take this same vote, Demo-
crats did the right thing and joined 
with 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
Leader 
MCCARTHY, and other Republicans to 
suspend the debt limit. We did it three 
times under a Republican President, 
the previous President. 
Now Congress is being asked to make 
that responsible choice again, but 
there is a Democratic President. Not-
withstanding Senator MCCONNELL’s ob-
servation that it would be unwise not 
to extend the credit of the United 
States, there apparently is a commit-
ment on the other side of the Capitol 
not to vote for a debt limit extension. 
I hope Republicans will be consistent 
and will do as they did before: vote to 
prevent a default and spare the Amer-
ican people from yet another damaging 
economic crisis right as we are coming 
out of a pandemic. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
Members, Republican and Democrat— 
this is not a Democratic debt; it is not 
a Republican debt. It is our debt. It is 
the debt of the United States of Amer-
ica. We don’t welch on our debts. We 
pay our debts. That is all this bill does. 
The debt limit is an absolutely phony 
issue. There is less than a handful of 
countries that have a debt limit, and 
none who come to a crisis of not paying 
their debt or extending that debt limit. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting for the 
continuing resolution to keep govern-
ment open—probably our primary re-
sponsibility—and prevent an economic 
disaster. 
Mr. Speaker, now, I heard the re-
marks of the gentlewoman, and she 
will be happy to hear that it is my in-
tention to bring to this floor a suspen-
sion bill before the end of this week 
that will fund fully Iron Dome. I was 
for that. I am still for it. We ought to 
do it. 
I talked to the Foreign Affairs Min-
ister, Mr. Lapid, just 2 hours ago and 
assured him that that bill was going to 
pass this House. I hope that my col-
league on that side of the aisle would 
join with me. 
I thank Chair DELAURO, with whom 
we just talked. She indicated she want-
ed that to be done. I intend to bring it 
to the floor, and it will be done. It is 
absolutely essential. 
There were 4,400 rockets in 10 days 
that rained down on Israel, one of our 
closest allies and friends. Luckily—no, 
not luckily. Because they had Iron 
Dome, very few lives were lost and very 
little property was lost. Too much, but 
nevertheless, Iron Dome saved lives 
and property and held Israel secure. 
The President wants this bill passed. 
Mr. SCHUMER wants this bill passed. 
The Speaker wants this bill passed. 
The chair of the Committee on Appro-
priations wants this bill passed. I want 
it passed. And I believe scores of others 
on both sides of the aisle want to make 
sure that Israel is secure and that she 
can replenish the assets of Iron Dome, 
which are defensive only—not offensive 
weapons, defensive only—so that if 
somebody sends a rocket toward either 
people or places in Israel, they will be 
able to intercept that rocket and save 
lives and save property. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for 
her leadership. I thank the Members of 
this body who are going to stand up, in 
my view, and are going to vote not 
only to keep government funded but to 
ensure that the United States of Amer-
ica does not fail to pay its debts. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Republican leader, the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER). 
Mr. Speaker, today, the national debt 
is a higher percentage of GDP than it 
has ever been. Our national debt 
threatens to burden future generations 
and limit our prosperity. After spend-
ing $5 trillion in the last year—$3.6 
trillion of which was bipartisan for 
COVID relief—it is time to address this 
very serious issue. 
This Democrat majority, however, 
has rushed headlong toward excessive 
and unnecessary spending. Working 
families are already feeling the impact 
of the $1.9 trillion spending bill that 
continues to drive record inflation. 
Now Democrat leadership is moving 
forward with an outrageous $3.5, maybe 
$4.5, maybe $5 trillion tax and spending 
spree, which is not only the single larg-
est bill ever brought before Congress— 
spending bill, that is—it is also the 
largest tax bill. It is also the largest 
anti-domestic energy bill. It is also the 
largest entitlement bill. And it is also 
the largest amnesty bill ever. 
The only thing that got cut from this 
was the $1 billion, which was somewhat 
explained, from the Iron Dome funding 
for defense of our ally Israel. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill would actually 
limit private-sector growth, which is 
the source of the revenue—the golden 
goose, if you will—and would reduce 
GDP as debt crowds out any benefit 
spending would have. This comes from 
a report from the Wharton School of 
Business. 
This is nothing short of Big Govern-
ment socialism suffocating free market 
capitalism. While this pill works its 
way through Congress, Democrats are 
asking Republicans to sign a blank 
check for their reckless spending. The 
Democrats are asking us to suspend 
the debt ceiling for the remainder of 
their time in the majority to finance 
reckless spending while we stand on 
the sidelines, which we are not going to 
do. 
As the Senate minority leader re-
cently put it, this is like cosigning a 
loan before a heavy gambler’s trip to 
Las Vegas. Democrats want unlimited 
borrowing authority to finance their 
Big Government socialist agenda, leav-
ing the American people to pay for 
these tax-and-spend, irresponsible poli-
cies in more ways than one. 
We simply cannot stand for this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, if this was for past 
spending that the majority leader sug-
gested, then the debt ceiling cap would 
be at today’s level of debt, which is 
about $28.6 trillion. We will see a much 
higher number coming our way. 
I will not support signing a blank 
check, as this majority has advanced 
the most reckless expansion of govern-
ment in generations. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chairwoman of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Energy and Water Development, and 
Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chair DELAURO for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with mixed feelings 
that I rise in support of today’s short- 
term continuing resolution. 
Once again, we need the means to 
keep the Federal Government’s lights 
on, make certain Social Security of-
fices function, and ensure national 
parks remain open to all. 
The American people deserve better 
performance from their elected leaders. 
We are in the middle of a global pan-
demic, and too many people are unsure 
of whether they can keep their own 
lights on. 
One bright spot in this bill is the in-
clusion of critical funding to respond 
to Hurricane Ida and other devasta-
tions wrought by climate change. 
This legislation will provide $6 bil-
lion for the Army Corps of Engineers, 
the Bureau of Reclamation, and the

Department of Energy to respond to 
these human and environmental disas-
ters. 
The energy and water portion also 
contains commonsense, necessary ex-
tensions to keep essential programs op-
erating for the next several weeks, and 
I support key provisions to responsibly 
lift the debt ceiling. 
Our Nation is still reeling from the 
GOP tax scam that blew up the deficit 
while giving away billions of dollars to 
the top 1 percent. The lack of action 
from our Senate Republican colleagues 
for the third year in a row is deeply 
concerning. Nine bills still await com-
mittee consideration, but Senate Re-
publicans would rather block efforts to 
help America build back better than do 
their jobs. 
I commend Chairwoman DELAURO’s 
leadership and Speaker PELOSI and Ma-
jority 
Leader 
HOYER
for 
their 
prioritization and passage in the House 
of 9 of our 12 appropriations spending 
bills, with all bills passed through com-
mittee. 
Gosh, Senate, come on. Catch up. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this continuing resolution. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Agriculture. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5305. As chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies, I would like to high-
light several items in our jurisdiction. 
The legislation includes $10 billion 
for agricultural disaster assistance pro-
grams to cover events in 2020 and 2021. 
Farmers, ranchers, and producers con-
tinue to face extreme climate events 
from extensive droughts out West and 
unprecedented heat in the Pacific 
Northwest to another year of massive 
wildfires in California and hurricanes 
that continue to batter the Gulf and 
Eastern seaboard States. Every region 
of our country is impacted. 
The bill also includes $275 million for 
the Emergency Watershed Protection 
Program to help communities address 
damages to infrastructure caused by 
natural disasters that impair the wa-
tersheds. 
Furthermore, it ensures that USDA 
can fully meet the demand for farm 
ownership loans, especially for begin-
ning and socially disadvantaged farm-
ers. It allows USDA to continue to pro-
vide loans to help expand economic op-
portunities and create jobs in rural 
areas, and it provides the authority 
and funding to allow the Food and Nu-
trition Service to increase the amounts 
of fruits and vegetables in the WIC food 
package. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee 
staff of both the Appropriations and 
Agriculture Committees. I also thank 
Chair DELAURO and the Members for 
their dedicated work on the many hard 
issues addressed in the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill so that programs 
meant to help America grow economi-
cally and recover from natural disas-
ters can continue to help people across 
this country. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), the chairwoman 
of the Appropriations Subcommittee 
on State and Foreign Operations. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 5305. I 
thank Chairwoman DELAURO for her 
tremendous leadership in bringing this 
forward, as well as our Speaker for en-
suring that our government stays open 
and responds to key emergencies here 
at home and abroad. 
I am especially pleased that this leg-
islation responds to the needs of West-
ern 
communities 
impacted 
by 
wildfires. My home State of California 
is experiencing the climate emergency 
firsthand. We have lost so many homes 
and lives and entire towns to wildfires 
over the last few years. 
It is a fact that climate change is 
driving these fires and extreme weath-
er events. This bill includes $28.6 bil-
lion to directly address the rising cost 
of climate change. 
As President Biden has said, justice 
must be at the heart of our response. 
We need to ensure that as we rebuild, 
we focus on those bearing the dis-
proportionate impact of the climate 
crisis, especially and particularly com-
munities of color. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs of the Committee on Appro-
priations, I am pleased that this legis-
lation includes over $6.3 billion to con-
tinue support for Afghan evacuees, ref-
ugees, and the growing humanitarian 
needs of the Afghan people. 
President Biden made a courageous 
decision to end two decades of war in 
Afghanistan. Many of us have argued 
for years that there is no military solu-
tion in Afghanistan and that the grow-
ing humanitarian crisis is further ex-
posing the horrific cost of our endless 
wars. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
we not only have a moral responsi-
bility to provide safe harbor for vulner-
able Afghans who fear for their lives 
but also to provide humanitarian as-
sistance to those suffering inside Af-
ghanistan. At least 18.4 million people 
in Afghanistan require humanitarian 
assistance due to the conflict, severe 
drought, and the COVID pandemic. 
I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1915 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, if we don’t pass this CR and 
disaster relief supplemental, we will 
have a cascade of nightmare occur-
rences. 
The Federal Government and so 
many programs that help our constitu-
ents will simply shut down. The United 
States will default on its debt, causing 
widespread economic catastrophe, and 
leave us a ‘‘permanently weaker Na-
tion,’’ as Secretary Yellen said. 
Millions of Americans will not re-
ceive emergency assistance to help re-
build from recent hurricanes, wildfires, 
droughts, and blizzards. 
Afghan evacuees will not receive ur-
gent humanitarian assistance. 
The National Institute of Standards 
and Technology will not receive the $22 
million in this bill to investigate the 
Surfside building collapse that hap-
pened in my district. 
We cannot abandon all these must- 
pass priorities for the American people. 
Republicans voted for a debt ceiling 
three times under Trump, and this pro-
posed increase would pay for debts that 
his administration incurred. 
Americans have been through enough 
in the last 18 months. Now is not the 
time to hold our economy hostage and 
tear vital strands from our safety net. 
Too many children, seniors, and work-
ing families are counting on the sta-
bility we have begun to secure in re-
cent months. 
Republicans must not play politics 
with our Nation’s fiscal stability. Too 
many Americans would get hurt. We 
must pass this CR. The alternative is 
catastrophic. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
DELAURO, Speaker PELOSI, and Mr. 
HOYER
for committing to bring the 
Iron Dome stand-alone suspension bill 
to make sure that we can stand by our 
ally Israel and replenish the vital Iron 
Dome missile defense system funding 
that Israel must have in order to be 
able make sure that she can defend 
herself by herself. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding, the dis-
tinguished chair of the Appropriations 
Committee, Congresswoman DELAURO 
from 
Connecticut. 
Thank 
you 
for 
bringing this important legislation to 
the floor in such a substantial way for 
our country in such need. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
continuing resolution, an essential step 
to keep government open. But it is not 
about government; it is about the peo-
ple, meeting their needs. Congress can

continue our work for the people, 
whether we are talking about Social 
Security recipients, veterans, millions 
who have a need and would benefit 
from what we are doing, and address 
the health crisis in our country, and 
the rest, this legislation goes a long 
way to doing that. 
In fact, it is essential that we keep 
government open. A government shut-
down would be a very bad thing for our 
country, for our economic growth, and 
for meeting the needs of the American 
people, as I suggested. 
This legislation secures government 
funding through December of this year, 
providing an appropriate amount of 
time for us to work in a bipartisan 
way, 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 
House and Senate, to address appro-
priations priorities in the regular order 
process for fiscal year 2022 while fund-
ing government and meeting the needs 
of people and avoiding a government 
shutdown, which would be catastrophic 
for families and the economy, and re-
cover from the COVID pandemic and 
the economic crisis. 
This legislation also meets other im-
portant priorities, helping American 
families devastated by recent natural 
disasters. Earlier this evening, we had 
a moment of silence for all those who 
lost their lives and for their families— 
it 
is 
very 
sad—in 
Hurricane 
Ida, 
throughout the country. 
Then, helping resettle Afghan evac-
uees fleeing danger, my colleague, Con-
gresswoman BARBARA LEE, has spoken 
about the need to do that and how im-
portant that is. We have a commitment 
in this House on both sides of the aisle, 
and the women on both sides of the 
Capitol, to help the Afghan women in 
any way that we can. 
Another item previously prioritized 
in the continuing resolution is the 
funding for the Iron Dome. I thank the 
chairwoman 
for 
her 
leadership 
in 
bringing this legislation to the floor 
this week to further express the will of 
Congress for the security of Israel 
manifested in funding for the Iron 
Dome. I thank her so much for that. 
Mr. Speaker, crucially, this funding 
will also include the suspension of the 
debt limit through December 2022. Ad-
dressing the debt limit is about pro-
tecting the full faith and credit of the 
United States, which the Founders 
wrote into the Constitution in the 14th 
Amendment. Section 4 states: ‘‘The va-
lidity of the public debt of the United 
States, authorized by law . . . shall not 
be questioned.’’ 
This is not about future spending. 
Some would like to give the impression 
we are just doing this. No, this is about 
paying bills already incurred, including 
to Social Security recipients, veterans, 
and millions who have benefited from 
the bipartisan COVID relief legislation 
passed last December. 
As I said before, Congress is ironclad 
in its commitment to never letting the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States come under threat, a commit-
ment that has long been bipartisan. 
Indeed, our approach in the CR to the 
debt limit is modeled after legislation 
proposed by GOP Senators in recent 
years. Since 2011, each of the seven 
times that the debt limit has been 
needed to be addressed, Congress has 
done so on a bipartisan basis, including 
three times during the Trump adminis-
tration when the debt, during the 
Trump administration, rose by $7.8 
trillion. Again, much of that was in-
curred in terms of honoring our com-
mitment on COVID, but a very big 
chunk of it in a tax scam that gave 83 
percent of the benefit to the top 1 per-
cent. 
It should be noted that just 3 percent 
of the current debt has been accumu-
lated under the Biden administration. 
Threatening to force the United 
States into default would be reckless 
and dangerous beyond measure. The 
last time Republicans tried this, a 
number of years ago, even the thought 
of not honoring the full faith and cred-
it lowered our credit rating. 
The failure to address the debt limit, 
as Secretary of the Treasury Janet 
Yellen recently stated, would ‘‘have ab-
solutely catastrophic economic con-
sequences. It would be utterly unprece-
dented’’ and ‘‘would precipitate a fi-
nancial crisis. It would threaten the 
jobs and savings of Americans, and at a 
time when we are still recovering from 
the COVID epidemic.’’ 
A study released just today found 
that the failure to address the debt 
limit would cost the U.S. economy up 
to 6 million jobs, wipe out potentially 
$15 trillion in household wealth, make 
borrowing rates skyrocket, and send 
the unemployment rate surging up to 9 
percent, almost twice the level it is 
now. As the report states, the situation 
would be cataclysmic and comparable 
to that suffered during the financial 
crisis of 2008. 
Indeed, this situation would be ‘‘fi-
nancial Armageddon,’’ according to 
Mark Zandi of Moody’s. It could ‘‘cause 
an immediate, literally cascading ca-
tastrophe of unbelievable proportions 
and damage America for 100 years,’’ ac-
cording to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie 
Dimon. 
As I mentioned before, this has al-
ways been bipartisan. Not everybody 
on every side of the aisle has voted for 
it, but nobody would let it fail. 
In 2019, when supporting a suspension 
of the debt ceiling under President 
Trump, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
stated, 
while supporting suspension of the 
debt, he stated that doing so ‘‘secures 
our Nation’s full faith and credit and 
ensures that Congress will not throw 
this kind of unnecessary wrench into 
the gear of our job growth and thriving 
economy.’’ 
If it was true then, why isn’t it true 
now? Why would Senator MCCONNELL 
reverse his position and decide to 
throw an unnecessary wrench into the 
gears of our job growth and thriving 
economy? Today the stakes remain 
high, and they remain the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
come together in the spirit of biparti-
sanship to protect the full faith and 
credit of the United States. 
I also want to, again, thank the com-
mittee and the distinguished chair for 
the bipartisan conversations that you 
have had, settling some internal as-
pects of this legislation, some of the 
important provisions in it. 
Remember, we cannot shut down the 
government. 
That 
would 
be 
cata-
strophic in its own right. We cannot ig-
nore and not support the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America. 
Right in this Constitution of the 
United States, the 14th Amendment, 
Section 4: ‘‘The validity of the public 
debt of the United States, authorized 
by law . . . shall not be questioned.’’ 
The 
Constitution 
says 
that. 
Why 
should the Congress question that? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote for the continuing resolu-
tion. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Maine (Ms. PINGREE), the chair of the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Inte-
rior, Environment, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the Extending Government 
Funding and Delivering Emergency As-
sistance Act. 
I am so grateful for the leadership of 
Chair 
DELAURO, 
who 
I 
know 
has 
worked tirelessly on this critical legis-
lation, and for the staff, who I know 
haven’t slept much lately. 
This bill maintains current govern-
ment services so that the important 
work funded through the Interior bill, 
such as preserving our natural and cul-
tural resources and upholding our re-
sponsibilities to Native Americans and 
Alaska Natives, can continue. 
I am pleased that this bill also con-
tains supplemental funding to provide 
desperately needed relief from the dev-
astation caused by climate change, ex-
treme weather events, and catastrophic 
wildland fire. 
This bill provides $1.8 billion to agen-
cies in the Interior bill for expenses re-
lated to the consequences of wildfires, 
hurricanes, and other natural disasters 
that have occurred since 2019. 
Western States, as we all know, are 
battling more and more historic high- 
intensity wildfires, so I am especially 
pleased that the bill includes $230 mil-
lion for hazardous fuels activities and 
$220 million for post-wildfire restora-
tion efforts at the Department of the 
Interior and the Forest Service. Such 
activities are essential to watershed 
protection, critical habitat, and burned 
area recovery in our Nation’s forests. 
These investments are essential to 
meet these current needs in such a 
critical time. Mr. Speaker, I urge ev-
eryone to support this bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to include the text 
of the amendment in the RECORD im-
mediately prior to the vote on the mo-
tion to recommit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4592 
September 21, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment would 
provide $1 billion to replenish Israel’s 
Iron Dome security system. 
Four months ago, Israel was under 
attack from terrorists. The rocket fire 
into Israel was on a scale that had 
never been seen before. Countless civil-
ian lives were saved because of the Iron 
Dome system that the United States 
has supported year after year. 
Because of the attacks this spring, 
Iron Dome rocket interceptors need to 
be 
restored 
immediately. 
Members 
have expressed their support for this 
funding for months. So has the Presi-
dent of the United States, and so has 
the Secretary of Defense. 
Now is the time to ensure Israel has 
what it needs to defend itself in the 
face of real and growing threats. This 
is a commonsense motion that would 
fund the Iron Dome system and reas-
sure our ally that America will never 
turn its back on the great State of 
Israel. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
motion, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey 
(Mrs. 
WATSON
COLEMAN), 
a 
Member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 5305, the Extending Govern-
ment Funding and Delivering Emer-
gency Assistance Act. This important 
piece of legislation will achieve two 
vital goals: keeping our government 
funded through December 3 and pro-
viding much-needed relief to areas im-
pacted by natural disasters this year. 
The emergency assistance is vital for 
my constituents who were heavily im-
pacted by Hurricane Ida, which caused 
historic flooding across central Jersey. 
This assistance will ensure that town-
ships and individuals in my district can 
fully recover and repair from the dam-
ages of the storm. 
Along with this funding, I am pleased 
to see the inclusion of canceling the 
outstanding balances of FEMA’s com-
munity disaster loans. 
b 1930 
This will lift a financial burden that 
New Jersey, as well as other States and 
territories, have struggled with in the 
wake of recovering from multiple dis-
asters dating back to Hurricane Sandy. 
I have been fighting for this relief with 
my New Jersey colleagues for years, 
and I thank the chairwoman from the 
bottom of my heart for working with 
me to get it included in the text. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill and 
its quick passage towards the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, 3 
weeks ago, the remnants of Hurricane 
Ida slammed into New Jersey claiming 
30 lives and devastating my district. 
President Biden’s major disaster dec-
laration unlocked the financial help 
that we need, and today Congress is 
heeding our call to fund that assistance 
with billions of dollars to help home-
owners and small businesses rebuild 
and 
to 
support 
the 
flood 
control 
projects that we desperately need the 
Army Corps to complete to prevent the 
next disaster. 
While we need the help—and I am 
proud to have played my part in secur-
ing it—we also know that the solution 
to 
these 
increasingly 
catastrophic 
storms can’t simply be that we apply 
to FEMA to help fix our homes every 5 
years or that we keep building ever 
higher and higher flood walls. We have 
got to recognize that climate change is 
4 feet of water in your basement, Mr. 
Speaker, and the cost of not dealing 
with it is far greater than the cost of 
transitioning away from fossil fuels. 
We can resign ourselves to half a 
country on fire and half the country 
under water, or we can lead the world 
to clean energy. I prefer to do that. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, as I said before, we all know we 
must pass a CR to keep the govern-
ment open. But this bill has too many 
fatal flaws, and passing it is simply a 
wasted opportunity. We are not any 
closer to sending a bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk to prevent a government 
shutdown. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support for this continuing resolution, 
especially the disaster supplemental 
portion. 
This bill contains crucial funding for 
my home State of Louisiana and for 
the residents of the Second Congres-
sional District affected by Hurricane 
Ida. Louisianians have been through a 
lot, and this bill recognizes that strug-
gle. It also helps us to begin working 
on those challenges. 
This Congress is stepping up and 
funding projects that will not only re-
pair the damage but also make our 
communities better and safer. The $3 
billion in Army Corps funding for flood 
and storm damage reduction projects 
will change the future of the commu-
nities across my State and across this 
Nation. It will build projects that will 
make communities stronger, safer, and 
more resilient. 
The $5 billion in CDBG funding for 
long-term disaster recovery will help 
communities affected by storms like 
Laura in the past year and start places 
affected by Ida on the road to recovery. 
It is not enough to repair these 
things to how they were. We need a re-
covery that reaches beyond and pre-
pares every community to be better, to 
be weather ready, and ready for the 
next series of storms. This Congress 
and the administration are taking the 
steps toward doing just that. I will con-
tinue to fight for more resources for 
the people of Louisiana and for the 
Second Congressional District. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this continuing res-
olution and to do the right thing by the 
people of America. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as Members of Con-
gress, our first duty is to the American 
people and especially to those in need. 
With the Extending Government Fund-
ing and Delivering Emergency Assist-
ance Act, we are supporting our Na-
tion’s working families, so many of 
whom are struggling to get by. 
By responding to the devastation of 
recent natural disasters, we can help 
the target communities and help the 
survivors rebuild and restore their 
lives, 
their 
livelihoods, 
and 
their 
homes. 
We can also do what is right to help 
those who risk their lives to serve our 
Nation in Afghanistan. By providing 
urgent humanitarian assistance and re-
sources to allow for the resettlement of 
Afghan evacuees in the United States, 
we can honor our commitment to these 
people and their families. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
do the right thing and pass this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
House, led by the Democratic majority, did its 
job, passing 10 of the 12 appropriations bills 
earlier this year, but Senate Republicans failed 
to hold a single markup of appropriations bills, 
making it necessary to pass this Continuing 
Resolution to avert a shutdown that would 
only further damage our economy. 
Throughout the 117th Congress, House 
Democrats have worked to deliver results for 
the American people, passing legislation to 
address each pillar of the ‘‘For The People’’ 
agenda: lower health care costs, higher wages 
by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corrup-
tion and strengthening our Democracy. 
And under the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI, the House has passed hundreds of 
bills, including legislation to crush the COVID– 
19 pandemic, build our economy back better, 
lower health care and prescription drug prices, 
raise wages, advance economic and retire-
ment security, end gun violence, act on the cli-
mate crisis, protect Dreamers, and strengthen 
voting rights. 
Mr. Speaker, let me briefly list several of the 
programs vital to Americans that are protected 
or extended by H.R. 5305. 
Section 101. Same Terms and Conditions 
for Continuing Appropriations as FY 2020. 
Section 101 states that appropriations are 
under the same terms and conditions, includ-
ing relevant authorities and prohibitions, as the 
fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills. 
Section 106. End Date of CR. 
Section 106 provides that the CR ends at 
the earlier of the enactment of a full-year ap-
propriations bill or December 3, 2021.

nation of employees due to lack of funds dur-
ing the duration of a CR. 
Section 113. Waiver Language for Intel-
ligence Programs. 
Section 113 provides waiver language for 
certain intelligence programs as well as agen-
cies that operate under the State Department 
Basic Authorities Act and Foreign Relations

some low-income women, infants and children 
up to age six. 
Section 127. Increased Flexibility for White 
House COVID Response. 
Section 127 allows a higher spending rate

essary to accommodate potential demand in-
creases for commitments for business loans 
through the 7(a) and 504 business loans, for 
the Secondary Market Guarantee Program,

pany (SBIC) program. 
Section 130. Extension for District of Colum-
bia Voucher School Accreditation.

the continuing resolution as necessary to re-
spond to declared disasters. 
Section 135. National Flood Insurance Pro-
gram (NFIP). 
Section 135 continues the authorization for 
the NFIP through December 3, 2021.

Programs. 
Section 148 extends funding for the Tem-
porary Assistance for Needy Families program 
and the Child Care Entitlement to States pro-
gram during the period of the continuing reso-
lution. The extension will allow HHS to make 
first-quarter payments to States. 
Section 152. Extending Availability of Fund-
ing for NIH multiyear research grants. 
Section 152 extends the availability of fund-
ing for multiyear research grants supported by 
the National Institutes of Health that were in-
terrupted in fiscal year 2020 by COVID–19 
and would have expired at the end of the fis-
cal year. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased and strongly 
support the inclusion of Divisions B and C in 
the legislation before us. 
Division B provides emergency supple-
mental appropriations in the amount of $28.6 
billion to address the rising cost of climate 
change: recent natural disasters, including 
Hurricanes Ida, Delta, Zeta, and Laura, 
wildfires, severe droughts and winter storms, 
and other natural and major disasters declared 
in 2021 and prior years. 
This funding will help working families, small 
businesses, and communities get back on 
their feet and rebuild, while repairing damage 
to federal facilities. 
Division C provides $6.3 billion in supple-
mental appropriations to support Afghan evac-
uees includes funding to temporarily house 
evacuees at American facilities and in foreign 
countries, 
provide 
necessary 
security 
screenings, and ultimately resettle eligible 
evacuees in the United States. 
The legislation also includes funding to pro-
vide humanitarian I assistance for Afghan refu-
gees in neighboring countries. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, as another example of 
the extraordinary and responsible leadership 
of Speaker PELOSI and Appropriations Com-
mittee Chair DELAURO, the legislation check-
mates the announced Republican intention to 
vote against raising the debt and to have the 
federal government default on its obligations 
by extending the public debt limit through De-
cember 16, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, American families do not get 
to choose which bills to pay and which ones 
to ignore; neither can the United States Con-
gress without putting the nation into default for 
the first time in its history. 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
The nation’s creditworthiness was one of its 
most important national assets and according 
to Hamilton: ‘‘the proper funding of the present 
debt, will render it a national blessing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, I strong-
ly support the provision in the bill before ex-
tending the public debt limit to December 16, 
2021. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me, in voting for H.R. 
5305, the ‘‘Extending Government Funding 
and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I also offer my strong support 
of the Rule governing debate of H.R. 3755, 
the Women’s Health Protection Act (’’WHPA’’), 
which would enshrine access to reproductive 
health care into law for all women across 
America. 
The refusal of the conservative majority on 
the U.S. Supreme Court to halt implementa-
tion of the odious and offensive Texas S.B. 8, 
the threat of other state attacks on the con-
stitutional right to reproductive choice recog-
nized in Roe v. Wade, and decades of prece-
dent have together mandated that the House 
act to protect women’s reproductive rights. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 667, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Granger of Texas moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 5305 to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
The material previously referred to 
by Ms. GRANGER is as follows: 
At the end of division A (before the short 
title) insert the following: 
SEC. ll. In addition to amounts otherwise 
provided by section 101, for ‘‘Procurement- 
Procurement, Defense-Wide’’, there is appro-
priated 
$1,000,000,000, 
for 
an 
additional 
amount for fiscal year 2022, to remain avail-
able until September 30, 2024, which shall be 
for the Secretary of Defense to provide to 
the Government of Israel for the procure-
ment of the Iron Dome defense system to 
counter short-range rocket threats: Provided, 
That such funds shall be provided to address 
emergent requirements in support of Oper-
ation Guardian of the Walls: Provided further, 
That such funds shall be transferred pursu-
ant to an exchange of letters and are in addi-
tion to funds provided pursuant to the U.S.- 
Israel Iron Dome Procurement Agreement, 
as amended: Provided further, That nothing 
in the preceding provisos shall be construed 
to apply to amounts made available in prior 
appropriations Acts for the procurement of 
the Iron Dome defense system. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 2(b) of rule XIX, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the motion 
to recommit. 
The question is on the motion to re-
commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

‘‘§ 873a. Art. 73a. Petition for DNA testing 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Upon a written petition by 
an accused sentenced to imprisonment or death 
pursuant to a conviction under this chapter (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘applicant’), the 
Judge Advocate General shall order DNA testing 
of specific evidence if the Judge Advocate Gen-
eral finds that all of the following apply: 
‘‘(1) The applicant asserts, under penalty of 
perjury, that the applicant is actually innocent 
of the offense for which the applicant is sen-
tenced to imprisonment or death. 
‘‘(2) The specific evidence to be tested was se-
cured in relation to the investigation or prosecu-
tion of the offense referenced in the applicant’s 
assertion under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(3) The specific evidence to be tested— 
‘‘(A) was not previously subjected to DNA 
testing and the applicant did not knowingly fail 
to request DNA testing of that evidence in a 
prior motion for postconviction DNA testing; or 
‘‘(B) was previously subjected to DNA testing 
and the applicant is requesting DNA testing 
using a new method or technology that is sub-
stantially more probative than the prior DNA 
testing. 
‘‘(4) The specific evidence to be tested is in the 
possession of the Government and has been sub-
ject to a chain of custody and retained under 
conditions sufficient to ensure that such evi-
dence has not been substituted, contaminated, 
tampered with, replaced, or altered in any re-
spect material to the proposed DNA testing. 
‘‘(5) The proposed DNA testing is reasonable 
in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and 
is consistent with accepted forensic practices. 
‘‘(6) The applicant identifies a theory of de-
fense that— 
‘‘(A) is not inconsistent with an affirmative 
defense presented at trial; and 
‘‘(B) would establish the actual innocence of 
the applicant of the offense referenced in the 
applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) If the applicant was convicted following 
a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at 
issue in the trial. 
‘‘(8) The proposed DNA testing of the specific 
evidence may produce new material evidence 
that would— 
‘‘(A) support the theory of defense referenced 
in paragraph (6); and 
‘‘(B) raise a reasonable probability that the 
applicant did not commit the offense. 
‘‘(9) The applicant certifies that the applicant 
will provide a DNA sample for purposes of com-
parison. 
‘‘(10) The petition is made in a timely fashion, 
subject to the following conditions: 
‘‘(A) There shall be a rebuttable presumption 
of timeliness if the petition is made within five 
years of the enactment of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 or within 
three years after the date of the entry of judg-
ment under section 860c of this title (article 60c), 
whichever comes later. Such presumption may 
be rebutted upon a showing— 
‘‘(i) that the applicant’s petition for a DNA 
test is based solely upon information used in a 
previously denied motion; or 
‘‘(ii) of clear and convincing evidence that the 
applicant’s filing is done solely to cause delay 
or harass. 
‘‘(B) There shall be a rebuttable presumption 
against timeliness for any petition not satisfying 
subparagraph (A) above. Such presumption may 
be rebutted upon the Judge Advocate General’s 
finding— 
‘‘(i) that the applicant was or is incompetent 
and such incompetence substantially contrib-
uted to the delay in the applicant’s motion for 
a DNA test; 
‘‘(ii) the evidence to be tested is newly discov-
ered DNA evidence; 
‘‘(iii) that the applicant’s petition is not based 
solely upon the applicant’s own assertion of in-
nocence and, after considering all relevant facts

communication or activity under subsection (b)

tion prohibited under subsection (b) that was

fense, that Inspector General may delegate re-
sponsibility for the investigation to an appro-
priate Inspector General of a military depart-

tributing factor in the personnel action prohib-
ited under subsection (b). Such circumstantial 
evidence may include that the person taking 
such prohibited personnel action knew of the

munication or participated in an activity pro-
tected under subsection (b) that was a contrib-
uting factor in a personnel action described in

termines in an investigation under subpara-
graph (D) that a personnel action prohibited 
under subsection (b) has occurred and that such 
personnel action shall result in an immediate 
hardship to the member alleging the personnel 
action, the Inspector General shall promptly no-

President determines appropriate. 
‘‘(2) 
SENTENCING
PARAMETERS.—Sentencing

would apply to the offense if the offense were 
tried in a United States district court; 
‘‘(iii) any military-specific sentencing factors;

an offense category unless the offense is identi-
fied as unsuitable for sentencing parameters

tity, disability, sexual orientation, and socio-
economic status of offenders. 
‘‘(3) SENTENCING
CRITERIA.—Sentencing cri-
teria established under paragraph (1) shall iden-

when there is no applicable sentencing param-
eter for a specific offense. 
‘‘(4) MILITARY SENTENCING PARAMETERS AND

Review Panel pursuant to section 946(f)(2) of 
this chapter (article 146(f)(2)). 
‘‘(iv) In addition to establishing parameters 
for sentences of confinement under clause (i)(I),

vention note that law enforcement officers and 
firefighters are more likely to die by suicide 
than in the line of duty, and emergency medical 
services providers are 1.39 times more likely to 
die by suicide than members of the general pub-
lic. 
(9) Invisible wounds linked to an underlying 
and undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can 
mirror many mental health conditions, a prob-
lem that can be addressed through connections 
to members of the Armed Forces and veterans 
who can better identify and address these 
wounds. 
(10) Urgent research is needed to highlight the 
connection between traumatic brain injury as a 
root cause of invisible wounds and suicide by 
members of the Armed Forces and veterans. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Congress— 
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
Warrior Call Day’’; 
(2) encourages all Americans, especially mem-
bers of the Armed Forces serving on active duty 
and veterans, to call up a warrior, have an hon-
est conversation, and connect them with sup-
port, understanding that making a warrior call 
could save a life; and 
(3) implores all Americans to recommit them-
selves to engaging with members of the Armed 
Forces through ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ 
and constructive efforts that result in solutions 
and treatment for the invisible scars they carry.

sonnel retention, and emphasize the need to or-
ganize, train, and equip for a potential future 
conflict in the space domain;

come fully operational, it should remain com-
mitted to building a ‘‘lean, agile, and fast’’ or-
ganization, as the Chief of Space Operations, 
General John W. Raymond, has often stated; 
and 
(3) in areas in which legislative action is need-
ed, including with respect to organizational 
structure and personnel requirements, the Sec-
retary of the Air Force and the Chief of Space 
Operations should maintain consistent commu-
nication with Congress to ensure that the 
founding principle behind the establishment of 
the Space Force—to build a small organization 
responsive to a rapidly changing domain—is 
upheld.

SEC. 1088. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CRI-
SIS AT THE SOUTHWEST BORDER. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) There were 1,300,000 illegal crossings be-
tween January, 2021, and July, 2021, at the 
Southwest land border of the United States. 
(2) The 212,672 migrant encounters on the 
Southwest land border in July 2021 was a 21- 
year high. 
(3) Noncitizens with criminal convictions are 
routinely encountered at ports of entry and be-
tween ports of entry on the Southwest land bor-
der. 
(4) Some of the inadmissible individuals en-
countered on the southwest border are known or 
suspected terrorists. 
(5) Transnational criminal organizations rou-
tinely move illicit drugs, counterfeit products, 
and trafficked humans across the Southwest 
land border. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the current level of illegal crossings and 
trafficking on the Southwest border represents a 
national security threat; 
(2) the Department of Defense has rightly con-
tributed personnel to aid the efforts of the 
United States Government to address the crisis 
at the Southwest border; 
(3) the National Guard and active duty mem-
bers of the Armed Forces are to be commended 
for their hard work and dedication in their re-
sponse to the crisis at the Southwest land bor-
der; and 
(4) border security is a matter of national se-
curity and the failure to address the crisis at the 
Southwest border introduces significant risk to 
the people of the United States.

(1) the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96– 
8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the Six Assurances 
provided by the United States to Taiwan in July 
1982 are the foundation for United States-Tai-
wan relations; 
(2) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, 
the United States decision to establish diplo-
matic relations with the People’s Republic of 
China rests upon the expectation that the future 
of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful 
means, and that any effort to determine the fu-
ture of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, 
including boycotts and embargoes, is of grave 
concern to the United States;

behavior of the People’s Republic of China to-
ward Taiwan is contrary to the expectation of 
the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan; 
(4) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, 
the capacity to resist any resort to force or other 
forms of coercion that would jeopardize the se-
curity, or the social or economic system, of the 
people on Taiwan should be maintained;

port the development of capable, ready, and 
modern defense forces necessary for Taiwan to

cluding by—

fense articles and services through foreign mili-
tary sales, direct commercial sales, and indus-
trial cooperation, with an emphasis on capabili-
ties that support the asymmetric defense strat-
egy of Taiwan, including anti-ship, coastal de-
fense, anti-armor, air defense, undersea war-
fare, advanced command, control, communica-
tions, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance, and resilient command and con-
trol capabilities; 
(B) ensuring timely review of and response to 
requests of Taiwan for defense articles and serv-
ices; 
(C) conducting practical training and military 
exercises with Taiwan that enable Taiwan to 
maintain a sufficient self- defense capability, as 
described in the Taiwan Relations Act; 
(D) exchanges between defense officials and 
officers of the United States and Taiwan at the 
strategic, policy, and functional levels, con-
sistent with the Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law

ning;

tary forces of the United States and Taiwan; 
and

fluence the free exercise of rights and demo-
cratic franchise. 
SEC. 1248. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INVITING TAI-
WAN TO THE RIM OF THE PACIFIC

strategic partnership based on long-standing

ple-to-people ties.

United States and Singapore is crucial to pro-
moting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific

rity Cooperation Partner’’ of the United States, 
as recognized in the Strategic Framework Agree-
ment between the United States and the Repub-
lic of Singapore for a Closer Partnership in De-
fense and Security, done at Washington, D.C. 
on July 12, 2005, plays an important role in the 
global network of strategic partnerships, espe-
cially in promoting maritime security and coun-
tering terrorism. 
(4) The United States values Singapore’s pro-
vision of access to its military facilities, which 
supports the continued security presence of the 
United States in Southeast Asia and across the 
Indo-Pacific region. 
(5) The United States should continue to wel-
come the presence of the military forces of 
Singapore in the United States for exercises and 
training, and should consider opportunities to

United States and Singapore in December 2019 
to establish a fighter jet training detachment in 
Guam. 
(6) The United States should continue to 
strengthen all aspects of the bilateral defense re-
lationship with Singapore, which benefitted 
from the signing of the 2015 enhanced Defense 
Cooperation Agreement to expand cooperation 
in the military, policy, strategic and technology 
spheres, as well as cooperation in non-conven-
tional security areas such as piracy and 
transnational terrorism, humanitarian assist-
ance and disaster relief, cyber-security, and bio-
security. 
(7) As the United States and Singapore have 
renewed the 1990 Memorandum of Under-
standing Regarding the United States Use of 
Facilities in Singapore and mark the 55th anni-
versary of bilateral relations in 2021, the United 
States should—

rity engagements in the Indo-Pacific region;

bers of the United States Armed Forces deployed 
to South Korea serves not only as a stabilizing 
force to the Korean peninsula but also as a re-
assurance to all our allies in the region; and 
(4) the United States should continue to— 
(A) maintain and strengthen its bilateral rela-
tionship with South Korea and with other re-
gional allies such as Japan; and

ence in South Korea to deter aggression against 
the United States and its allies and partners.

looking strategic partnership based on long- 
standing and mutually beneficial cooperation,

nomic ties; 
(2) robust security cooperation between the 
United States and Qatar is crucial to promoting 
peace and stability in the Middle East region; 
(3) Qatar plays a unique role as host of the 
forward headquarters for the United States Cen-
tral Command, and that partnership facilitates 
United States coalition operations countering 
terrorism;

ner of the United States, as recognized in the 
2018 Strategic Dialogue and the 2019 Memo-
randum of Understanding to expand Al Udeid 
Air Base to improve and expand accommodation

(5) the United States values Qatar’s provision

agement and financial assistance in expanding 
the Al Udeid Air Base, which supports the con-
tinued security presence of the United States in

SEC. 1302. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED 
STATES DEFENSE POSTURE IN EU-
ROPE. 
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
(1) The United States is steadfastly committed 
to upholding and strengthening its defense alli-
ances and partnerships in the European the-
ater. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) alliance is the bedrock of these relation-
ships, which are central to deterring Russian 
aggression, upholding territorial integrity and 
sovereignty in Europe, countering malign efforts 
to undermine the rules-based international 
order and disrupt shared values, fostering inter-
national cooperation against collective chal-
lenges, and advancing shared national security 
objectives worldwide.

H4695 
September 21, 2021 
(2) United States allies in Europe have made 
substantial strides on responsibility-sharing and 
defense investment since the Wales Declaration 
in 2014 and should be commended for their ongo-
ing efforts to increase complementary invest-
ments in NATO deterrence capacity. These ef-
forts have provided an accumulated increase of 
more than $130,000,000,000 in foreign invest-
ments between 2016 and 2020 to strengthen 
trans-Atlantic security, and it is essential that 
the United States continue to press NATO allies 
to achieve their Wales Summit pledges and con-
tinue to make progress on greater complemen-
tary defense investments. 
(3) The behavior of the Russian Government 
has not improved and has, in many aspects, be-
come increasingly belligerent since the invasion 
of Ukraine in 2014, with respect to— 
(A) military efforts to disrupt the territorial 
integrity of sovereign countries in Europe; 
(B) threats against the United States, NATO, 
and other United States partners; 
(C) intervention in allied democratic proc-
esses; 
(D) efforts to disrupt United States alliances, 
partnerships, and values; 
(E) acts such as assassination and the use of 
chemical weapons on the territory of other sov-
ereign countries; and 
(F) other high-risk, disruptive efforts. 
(4) Continued commitment to enhancing the 
United States and allied force posture in Europe 
is indispensable for efforts to establish and sus-
tain a credible deterrent against Russian aggres-
sion and long-term strategic competition by the 
Russian government. The Secretary of Defense 
must continue to— 
(A) support the European Deterrence Initia-
tive and other investments in a strengthened 
United States and allied force posture in Eu-
rope; 
(B) support rotational deployments and robust 
exercises in the European theater; 
(C) complete efforts to establish prepositioned 
stocks and effective staging infrastructure to 
maintain credible deterrence against Russian 
threats; 
(D) invest effectively in multi-service, cyber, 
information, and air defense efforts to counter 
modern military challenges, enhance the surviv-
ability and flexibility of the United States force 
posture, logistics, and planning; and 
(E) consider whether additional forward-posi-
tioned forces in Europe would reduce cost and 
strain, enhance credibility, and strengthen ca-
pabilities. 
SEC. 1303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SECURITY AS-
SISTANCE TO THE BALTIC COUN-
TRIES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States has cumulatively allo-
cated over $498,965,000 in Department of Defense 
partner capacity funding for the Baltic coun-
tries since fiscal year 2018, including over 
$219,000,000 for the Baltic security efforts known 
as the ‘‘Baltic Security Initiative’’, executed 
using sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United 
States Code, including assistance with respect to 
air defense, maritime situational awareness, am-
munition, C4ISR, anti-tank capability, special 
forces, and other defense capabilities. 
(2) The Secretary of Defense has completed 
the comprehensive Baltic Defense Assessment re-
quired by section 1246 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and has 
recommended continued robust, comprehensive 
investment Baltic security efforts in accordance 
with that assessment, with assistance executed 
using such sections 332 and 333. 
(3) The Secretary of Defense has assessed that 
the authority granted by such sections 332 and 
333 affords the most efficient and effective au-
thority to provide this assistance to the Baltic 
countries, and that attempting to provide the 
assistance pursuant to alternate authorities 
would hamper the Department’s ability to de-
liver assistance and implement the investment 
program established by the Baltic Defense As-
sessment. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—Congress strongly 
supports the robust assistance to accomplish 
United States strategic objectives in accordance 
with sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United 
States Code, including by providing assistance 
to the Baltic countries using those sections, 
funded by the Baltic Security Initiative. It is the 
sense of Congress that the security of the Baltic 
region is crucial to the security of the NATO al-
liance and these efforts are critical to ensure 
continued deterrence against Russian aggres-
sion and bolster allied security.

Assistance 
SEC. 1311. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR CER-
TAIN PAYMENTS TO REDRESS IN-
JURY AND LOSS. 
Section 1213(a) of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (10 U.S.C. 
2731 note) is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 
2022’’ and inserting ‘‘December 31, 2023’’. 
SEC. 1312. FOREIGN AREA OFFICER ASSESSMENT 
AND REVIEW. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Foreign Area Officers of the Army and 
their equivalent positions in the other Armed 
Forces (in this section referred to as ‘‘FAOs’’) 
are trained to manage, grow, and enhance secu-
rity 
cooperation 
relationships 
between 
the 
United States and foreign partners and to build 
the overall military capacity and capabilities of 
foreign partners. 
(2) At present, some senior defense official po-
sitions in United States embassies are filled by 
officers lacking the necessary skills, training, 
and experience to strengthen the relationships 
between the United States and its critical part-
ners and allies. 
(3) FAOs are trained to fill those positions, 
and deficiencies in the equitable use, assess-
ment, promotion, diversity and inclusion of such 
officers, as well as limitations on career oppor-
tunities, undermine the ability of the Depart-
ment of Defense to strengthen partnerships and 
alliances of the United States. 
(4) A federally funded research and develop-
ment center can provide a roadmap to correcting 
these 
deficiencies, 
strengthening 
the 
FAO 
branch, and placing qualified FAOs in positions 
of positive influence over United States partner-
ships and alliances. 
(b) ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Defense shall enter into an agreement 
with a federally funded research and develop-
ment center to conduct an independent assess-
ment and comprehensive review of the process 
by which Foreign Area Officers and their equiv-
alent positions in the other Armed Forces (in 
this section referred to as ‘‘FAOs’’) are re-
cruited, selected, trained, assigned, organized, 
promoted, retained, and used in security co-
operation offices, senior defense roles in U.S. 
embassies, and in other critical roles of engage-
ment with allies and partners. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The assessment and review 
conducted under paragraph (1) shall include the 
following: 
(A) Identification and assessment of the num-

nic diversity of FAOs. 
(C) An assessment of the assignment process 
for FAOs. 
(D) A review and assessment of the promotion 
criteria, process, and possible pathways for ca-
reer advancement for FAOs.

egorization of FAOs by geographic region. 
(F) An assessment of the training program for 
FAOs and its effectiveness.

official and security cooperation roles and as-
sessment to determine whether requirements are 
being met through the staffing process. 
(J) An assessment of how the broader utiliza-
tion of FAOs in key security cooperation and 
embassy defense leadership billets would im-
prove the quality and professionalism of the se-
curity cooperation workforce under section 384 
of title 10, United States Code. 
(K) A review of how many FAO opportunities 
are joint-qualifying and an assessment of 
whether increasing the number of joint-qualified 
opportunities for FAOs would increase recruit-
ment, retention, and promotion. 
(L) Any other matters the Secretary deter-
mines relevant. 
(c) RESULTS.—The federally funded research 
and development center conducting the assess-
ment and review described in subsection (b)

senior defense officials. 
(d) SUBMISSION TO CONGRESS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than December 31, 
2022, the Secretary shall submit to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives—

ases with respect to such individuals; 
(B) ensuring that each military service acad-
emy fosters a zero tolerance environment for

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Space Force, in collaboration with the 
United States Space Command, the military de-
partments, relevant Defense Agencies and, 
where practicable, the National Reconnaissance 
Office, should continue to build on the success-
ful Space Safari tactically responsive launch-2 
mission of the Space Force, which was a path-
finder to inform concepts of operation regarding 
tactically responsive launches; and 
(2) future efforts regarding tactically respon-
sive launches should not be limited to only 
launch capabilities, but should also include all 
aspects that are needed for rapid reconstitution 
and responsiveness to urgent requirements with 
respect to satellite buses, payloads, operations, 
and ground infrastructure. 
(b) PROGRAM.—Section 1609 of the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116– 
283) is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘The Secretary’’ and inserting 
‘‘(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(b) SUPPORT.— 
‘‘(1) ELEMENTS.—The Secretary of Defense, in 
consultation with the Director of National Intel-
ligence, shall support the tactically responsive 
launch program under subsection (a) during the 
period covered by the future-years defense pro-
gram submitted to Congress under section 221 of 
title 10, United States Code, in 2022 to ensure 
that the program addresses the following: 
‘‘(A) The ability to rapidly place on-orbit sys-
tems to respond to urgent needs of the com-
manders of the combatant commands or to re-
constitute space assets and capabilities to sup-
port national security priorities if such assets

tional Reconnaissance Office should, to the ex-
tent practicable, use launch services under a 
phase two contract of the National Security 
Space Launch program; and 
(2) for missions that fall outside of the re-
quirements of phase two of the National Secu-
rity Space Launch program, the Department of 
Defense and the National Reconnaissance Of-
fice should continue to leverage the growing 
launch provider base of the United States, in-
cluding those companies that provide smaller 
and 
ride-share 
launch 
capabilities, 
to 
incentivize sustained investment in domestic 
launch capabilities. 
(b) POLICY.—With respect to entering into 
contracts for launch services during the period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
Act and ending September 30, 2024, it shall be 
the policy of the Department of Defense and the 
National Reconnaissance Office to— 
(1) use the National Security Space Launch 
program to the extent practicable to procure 
launch services that are met under the require-
ments of phase two; and 
(2) 
maximize 
continuous 
competition 
for 
launch services as the Space Force initiates 
planning for phase three, specifically for those 
technology areas that are unique to existing and 
emerging national security requirements. 
(c) NOTIFICATION.—If the Secretary of Defense 
or the Director of the National Reconnaissance 
Office determines that a program requiring 
launch services that could be met using phase 
two contracts will instead use an alternative 
launch procurement approach, not later than 
seven days after the date of such determination, 
the Secretary of Defense or, as appropriate, the 
Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to 
the appropriate congressional committees— 
(1) a notification of such determination; 
(2) a certification that the alternative launch 
procurement approach is in the national secu-
rity interest of the United States; and 
(3) an outline of the cost analysis and any 
other rationale for such determination. 
(d) REPORT.— 
(1) REQUIREMENT.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
Chief of Space Operations and the Director of 
the Space Development Agency, and in con-
sultation with the Director of National Intel-
ligence (including with respect to the views of 
the Director of the National Reconnaissance Of-
fice), shall submit to the appropriate congres-
sional committees a report on the plans of the 
Secretary to address, with respect to launches 
that would be procured in addition to or outside 
of launches under phase two, the emerging 
launch requirements in the areas of space ac-
cess, mobility, and logistics that cannot be met 
by phase two capabilities, as of the date of the 
report. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report under paragraph 
(1) shall include the following: 
(A) An examination of the benefits of com-
peting up to two launches per year outside of 
phase two to accelerate the rapid development 
and on-orbit deployment of enabling and trans-
formational technologies required to address 
emerging requirements, including with respect 
to— 
(i) delivery of in-space transportation, logis-

SEC. 1623. REVIEW OF SAFETY, SECURITY, AND 
RELIABILITY OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
AND RELATED SYSTEMS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) On December 20, 1990, Secretary of Defense 
Cheney chartered a five-person independent 
committee known as the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk Reduction 
to assess the capability of the nuclear weapon 
command and control system to meet the dual 
requirements of assurance against unauthorized 
use of nuclear weapons and assurance of timely, 
reliable execution when authorized, and to iden-
tify opportunities for positive measures to en-
hance failsafe features. 
(2) The Federal Advisory Committee, chaired 
by Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, rec-
ommended changes in the nuclear enterprise, as 
well as policy proposals to reduce the risks 
posed by unauthorized launches and mis-
calculation. 
(3) The Federal Advisory Committee found, 
unambiguously, that ‘‘failsafe and oversight en-
hancements are possible’’. 
(4) Since 1990, new threats to the nuclear en-
terprise have arisen in the cyber, space, and in-
formation warfare domains. 
(5) Ensuring the continued assurance of the 
nuclear command, control, and communications 
infrastructure is essential to the national secu-
rity of the United States. 
(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Defense shall 
provide for the conduct of an independent re-
view of the safety, security, and reliability of 
covered nuclear systems. The Secretary shall en-
sure that such review is conducted in a manner 
similar to the review conducted by the Federal 
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and 
Risk Reduction. 
(c) MATTERS
INCLUDED.—The review con-
ducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall include 
the following: 
(1) Plans for modernizing the covered nuclear 
systems, including options and recommendations 
for technical, procedural, and policy measures 
that could strengthen safeguards, improve the 
security and reliability of digital technologies, 
and prevent cyber-related and other risks that 
could lead to the unauthorized or inadvertent 
use of nuclear weapons as the result of an acci-
dent, 
misinterpretation, 
miscalculation, 
ter-
rorism, unexpected technological breakthrough, 
or deliberate act. 
(2) Options and recommendations for nuclear 
risk reduction measures, focusing on confidence 
building and predictability, that the United 
States could carry out alone or with near-peer 
adversaries to strengthen safeguards against the 
unauthorized or inadvertent use of a nuclear 
weapon and to reduce nuclear risks. 
(d) SUBMISSION.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit to the congressional de-
fense committees the review conducted pursuant 
to subsection (b). 
(e) PREVIOUS REVIEW.—Not later than 30 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit to the congressional de-
fense committees the final report of the Federal 
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and 
Risk Reduction. 
(f) COVERED NUCLEAR SYSTEMS DEFINED.—In 
this section, the term ‘‘covered nuclear systems’’ 
means the following systems of the United 
States: 
(1) The nuclear weapons systems. 
(2) The nuclear command, control, and com-
munications system. 
(3) The integrated tactical warning/attack as-
sessment system. 
SEC. 1624. REVIEW OF ENGINEERING AND MANU-
FACTURING 
DEVELOPMENT 
CON-
TRACT FOR GROUND-BASED STRA-
TEGIC DETERRENT PROGRAM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) In September 2020, the Air Force awarded 
the engineering and manufacturing development 
contract for the ground-based strategic deter-
rent program. 
(2) The total development cost of the ground- 
based strategic deterrent program is expected to 
be approximately $100,000,000,000. 
(3) The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff recently noted that ‘‘we have got to make 
[the ground-based strategic deterrent program] 
more affordable. A three-stage, solid rocket 
ICBM should not cost as much as the forecast 
says it costs for now. After meeting with the 
program office at Northrop Grumman multiple 
times I think that program can come in signifi-
cantly cheaper. It’s designed correctly. It’s a 
digital engineering process that should be able 
to build things quickly and much more effec-
tively.’’. 
(4) The Air Force has placed significant im-
portance on digital engineering in achieving 
cost and schedule requirements with respect to 
the ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
(b) REVIEW.— 
(1) REQUIREMENT.—The Secretary of the Air 
Force shall provide for the conduct of a review 
of the implementation and the execution of the 
engineering and manufacturing development 
contract for the ground-based strategic deter-
rent program. 
(2) MATTERS
INCLUDED.—The review under 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) An analysis of the ability of the Air Force 
to implement industry best practices during the 
engineering and manufacturing development

program. 
(B) A review of the challenges the Air Force 
faces in implementing such industry best prac-
tices. 
(C) A review of the ability of the Air Force to 
leverage digital engineering during such engi-
neering and manufacturing development phase. 
(D) A review of any options that may be 
available to the Air Force to reduce cost and in-
troduce competition within the operations and 
maintenance phase of the ground-based stra-
tegic deterrent program. 
(E) Recommendations to improve the cost, 
schedule, and program management of the 
ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
(3) EXPERTISE.—The Secretary shall ensure 
that the review under paragraph (1) is con-
ducted by individuals from the public and pri-
vate sector, including not fewer than two indi-
viduals— 
(A) who are not employees or officers of the 
Department of Defense or a contractor of the 
Department; and 
(B) who have experience outside of the de-
fense industry. 
(4) PROVISION
OF
INFORMATION.—The Sec-
retary shall provide to the individuals con-
ducting the review under paragraph (1) all in-
formation necessary for the review. 
(5) SECURITY

mander of the United States Strategic Com-
mand, Admiral Charles A. Richard, said that 
the basic design criteria in the triad is that 
‘‘you cannot allow a failure of any one leg of 
the triad to prevent you from being able to do 
everything the President has ordered you to 
do.’’. 
(2) Admiral Richard further stated that in the 
event of one leg atrophying, ‘‘You are com-
pletely dependent on the submarine leg, and I’ve 
already told the Secretary of Defense that under 
those conditions I would request to re-alert the 
bombers.’’.

Subtitle D—Missile Defense Programs 
SEC. 1641. DIRECTED ENERGY PROGRAMS FOR 
BALLISTIC AND HYPERSONIC MIS-
SILE DEFENSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) In the fiscal year 2021 budget request of 
the Department of Defense, the Secretary of De-
fense removed all funding from the Missile De-
fense Agency to conduct research, engineering, 
or development for directed energy technologies 
that could be applicable for ballistic and 
hypersonic missile defense, and this removal of 
funding continued in the fiscal year 2022 budget 
request of the Department, despite Congress ap-
propriating funding for fiscal year 2021 for these 
efforts. 
(2) In January 2020, an independent Senior 
Executive Review Team noted that ‘‘If success-
fully developed, the unique features of diode 
pumped alkali laser, an efficient electrically 
powered, relatively short wavelength gas laser 
with the potential to deliver megawatt power 
with near diffraction limited beam quality from 
a single aperture would provide the Department 
of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency with 
an important strategic technology with the po-
tential for an attractive size, weight, and power. 
Such a system would have potential capability 
use cases across all services/agencies.’’. How-
ever, the Under Secretary of Defense for Re-
search and Engineering did not support contin-
ued investigation of this promising technology 
by the Missile Defense Agency. 
(3) In addition to diode pumped alkali lasers, 
there are other directed energy applications that 
have the potential to contribute to ballistic and 
hypersonic missile defense architecture, includ-
ing microwave and short pulse lasers tech-
nologies. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Director of the Missile De-
fense Agency should continue to fund promising 
directed energy technologies for ballistic and 
hypersonic missile defense, in coordination with 
the directed energy roadmap of the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and Engineering, 
with the intent to transfer technologies to the 
military departments as appropriate. 
(c) AUTHORITY

THE
MISSILE
DEFENSE 
AGENCY.— 
(1) DELEGATION.—The Secretary of Defense 
shall delegate to the Director of the Missile De-
fense Agency the authority to budget for, direct, 
and manage directed energy programs applica-
ble for ballistic and hypersonic missile defense 
missions, in coordination with other directed en-
ergy efforts of the Department of Defense. 
(2) PRIORITIZATION.—In budgeting for and di-
recting directed energy programs applicable for 
ballistic and hypersonic defensive missions pur-
suant to paragraph (1), the Director of the Mis-
sile Defense Agency shall— 
(A) prioritize the early research and develop-
ment of technologies; and 
(B) address the transition of such technologies 
to industry to support future operationally rel-
evant capabilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4794 
September 21, 2021 
The first thing I will say is thank 
you to all of the staff, certainly on the 
Armed Services Committee, but the 
Rules Committee as well, and the lead-
ership staff. This has been a truly bi-
partisan legislative process. 
We had our markup in committee 
which lasted, I will do a little quick 
math in my head, something like 16 
hours. We considered over 800 amend-
ments, with a variety of different vari-
ations, and we got that number up 
closer to 1100. And then before the 
Rules Committee there were, again, 
over 800 amendments submitted, and 
we have worked with Members of this 
body, 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 
members on the committee and off, to 
craft what I think is a very good piece 
of legislation. 
I think it is incredibly important, 
first of all, that we pass this bill so 
that Congress continues to exercise its 
authority to exercise oversight over 
the Department of Defense. 
I know Members on both sides of this 
aisle have lamented throughout the 
years the degree to which the executive 
branch has exerted more power over 
the years, where the legislative branch 
has exhibited less. Now, granted, you 
find that issue more troubling when 
the opposite party is in charge of the 
White House, but we are all troubled by 
that phenomena. 
We need to exercise our authority; 
this bill does that. To my mind, Con-
gress does not pass enough authorizing 
bills, but we do do so in the Depart-
ment of Defense, and have done so for 
over 60 straight years, and should do so 
again. 
This bill, I think, is particularly im-
portant because we are at an important 
moment in defense of this country and 
in dealing with our role in the world. 
We have never faced a more complex 
threat environment. We have threats 
from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, 
and transnational terrorist groups. 
In addition, we are now coming out 
of 20 years of war fought in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, both countries of which 
our military now is out and not fight-
ing those wars, and we have a whole 
bunch of change to deal with. 
At the same time, innovation has 
never been more important in properly 
defending this country. We need to up-
date and modernize our armed forces, 
everything from our information sys-
tems, to our command and control, to 
our platforms, to the support we give 
to our servicemembers. I am very 
proud that this bill reflects those prior-
ities. 
And the work has been done between 
Mr. ROGERS and myself and members of 
the committee to produce that prod-
uct. And I want to take a moment here 
to thank Mr. ROGERS, the ranking 
member, he has been a terrific partner 
in this process, as has his staff and as 
has his members. 
I think this bill reflects those prior-
ities. It figures out how to improve our 
ability to update the military more 
quickly, to better buy software, to bet-
ter innovate, to better embrace the in-
novative technologies that we need. 
Madam Speaker, I want to particu-
larly thank Mr. LANGEVIN, as the sub-
committee chair, who has taken the 
lead on the AI task force that looks at 
this question in great specificity. This 
bill really puts us in a position to mod-
ernize the force as we need to. 
One other crucial issue that we do in 
this is we address the issue of sexual 
assault in the military that continues 
to be a scourge upon service in the 
military. We have worked for years to 
try to address this issue, we have not 
been successful. 
This year, thanks in large part to the 
leadership of Congresswoman SPEIER, 
we have updated the UCMJ to create a 
special victims’ prosecutor to give sex-
ual assault and sex crimes the atten-
tion they deserve to make sure that we 
are protecting the men and women who 
serve in the military. It is a crucial as-
pect of this bill, and I strongly urge 
Members to support it. 
Lastly, let me just say that as you 
pore over this bill, everybody here will 
find something that they do not like. 
Everybody here will also find some-
thing that they wish was in there that 
is not. There is no doubt about that, 
because it is a very large bill, and it 
was a collaborative process. 
But it is the nature of the legislative 
process that you don’t get absolutely 
everything that you want. I hope Mem-
bers will keep that in mind. But it is 
also the nature of the legislative proc-
ess, in this case, that we have produced 
a product that everybody in this House 
can be proud of. 
And, again, I want to thank my Re-
publican counterpart. We have worked 
together to produce this. I urge support 
from all Members. This is a bill every 
Member, Democrat and Republican, 
can enthusiastically support, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

TELLIGENCE, 
September 8, 2021. 
Hon. ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SMITH: I write in response 
to your committee’s request, and concerning 
H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2022. Certain provi-
sions in the legislation fall within the juris-
diction of the Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence (the ‘‘Committee’’), as estab-
lished by Rule X of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives for the 117th Congress. 
In the interest of expediting floor consider-
ation of this important bill, I am willing to 
waive the Committee’s right to request a se-
quential referral. By doing so, the Com-
mittee does not waive any future claim over 
subjects addressed in the bill which fall with-
in the Committee’s jurisdiction. I also re-
quest that you urge the Speaker to name 
members of the Committee to any con-
ference committee on the bill. 
Please place this letter into the committee 
report on H.R. 4350 and into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our respective committees. 
Sincerely. 
ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, September 9, 2021. 
Hon. ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
SCHIFF: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 4350, the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2022. I agree that the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence has valid jurisdic-
tional claims to certain provisions in this 
important legislation, and I am most appre-
ciative of your decision not to request a re-
ferral in the interest of expediting consider-
ation of the bill. I agree that by foregoing a 
sequential referral, the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence is not waiving its 
jurisdiction. Further, this exchange of let-
ters will be included in the committee report 
on the bill. 
Sincerely, 
ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in strong 
support of H.R. 4350, the fiscal year Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
H.R. 4350 represents a truly bipar-
tisan bill, and I want to thank Chair-
man SMITH for his tremendous leader-
ship and cooperation in helping fashion 
it. This has been a truly bipartisan en-
deavor. 
b 2115 
Over the last few months, we have 
seen the best of our soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, marines, and guardians. They 
have performed in the toughest of envi-
ronments with the greatest level of 
skill and professionalism. Many gave 
their lives so others would have a 
chance for a better life. Without a 
doubt, our military is the greatest 
force the world has ever seen. 
Providing the authorities and re-
sources for our service that our serv-
icemembers need to defend our Nation 
and defeat our adversaries is the great-
est responsibility we have here in Con-
gress. We accomplished that responsi-
bility with the bill before us today. 
H.R. 4350 ensures our warfighters are 
the best equipped and trained in the 
world. 
The bill puts our servicemembers 
first, providing a 2.7 percent pay in-
crease and expanding benefits for their 
families. It also puts American workers 
first with historic investments in our 
defense industrial base. It also begins 
divesting legacy systems that will not 
help us deter future threats. Instead, it 
invests in new technologies like AI, 
hypersonics, and quantum computing 
that will help us stay ahead of our ad-
versaries. 
That is important because Russia 
and China are rapidly modernizing 
their militaries. China is outpacing us 
with advancements in emerging tech-
nologies and weapons systems, and we 
know China isn’t building these capa-
bilities purely for defense. In recent 
years, we have seen China use its mili-
tary to push out its borders, threaten 
our allies, and gain footholds on new 
continents. 
H.R. 4350 is laser-focused on pre-
paring our military to prevail in a con-
flict with China. It makes critical in-
vestments in new systems capable of 
surviving in a contested environment. 
It includes provisions that will remove 
China from our defense supply chain, 
and it reaffirms our support to allies in 
the region, especially Taiwan. Unfortu-
nately, threats from near peer adver-
saries like China and Russia are not 
the only ones we face. Terrorists con-
tinue their plots to destroy our way of 
life, and we must continue to take the 
fight to them anywhere and anytime 
they threaten us. With strong invest-
ments in new capabilities and readi-
ness, this bill enables our warfighters 
to do just that. 
Finally, regardless of how you feel 
about the war in Afghanistan, Madam 
Speaker, I think we are all horrified by 
its disastrous withdrawal. This bill in-
cludes over 20 provisions to provide ac-
countability to get us answers to ques-
tions we have been asking for here for 
months. 
This is a strong, bipartisan bill that 
will enhance our oversight of the DOD 
and ensure our military is properly 
resourced and equipped to defend our 
Nation and our allies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support the bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the National Defense Author-
ization Act. I commend Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS

September 21, 2021 
for their bipartisan cooperation in 
bringing the bill to the floor. I also 
want to thank Ranking Member BANKS 
and former Ranking Member STEFANIK 
for their bipartisan collaboration this 
year. I would also like to thank the 
members of the Cyber, Innovative 
Technologies, and Information Sys-
tems Subcommittee for their hard 
work, 
particularly 
Vice 
Chair 
HOULAHAN. 
Thanks to the work of my sub-
committee, this legislation harnesses 
cutting-edge technology to benefit our 
warfighters and our national security. 
This legislation includes a 36 percent 
increase in defense-wide basic and ap-
plied research and development and 
significant increases for historically 
Black colleges and universities. 
This bill also includes many provi-
sions recommended by the National Se-
curity Commission on Artificial Intel-
ligence, which I offered as a package of 
amendments during our committee 
markup. We are taking important steps 
in addressing the promises and chal-
lenges of this powerful technology, and 
I am thankful for the commission co-
chairs, Secretary Bob Work and Dr. 
Eric Schmidt, and members of that 
committee as well for their service. 
The NDAA builds off the important 
work of the Cyberspace Solarium Com-
mission by establishing the Joint Col-
laborative Environment at the Cyber-
security and Infrastructure Security 
Agency, called CISA. This program, 
which will live at the newly established 
Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, or 
JCDC, will facilitate public-private co-
operation in analyzing cyber threats. 
Beyond the CITI provisions, the 
NDAA fully funds the Virginia-class 
and Columbia-class submarine programs 
which are crucial to our deterrence 
posture against China. I am so proud to 
represent the Rhode Islanders who con-
struct these amazing vessels and do 
their part in keeping us safe. 
I am also proud of the reforms we 
made to the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice to address sexual assault and 
extremism and of our efforts to defend 
our military infrastructure against cli-
mate 
change. 
These 
achievements 
would not be possible, of course, with-
out the work of my subcommittee 
staff: staff lead Michael Hermann; Bess 
Dopkeen, Troy Nienberg, and Josh 
Stiefel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Rhode Island an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. I also thank minor-
ity staff, Sarah Moxley. Our clerk, 
Caroline Kehrli, is departing the sub-
committee, and her work has been in-
credibly invaluable. My legislative di-
rector, Caroline Goodson, and military 
fellow, Juliann Hitt, also made signifi-
cant contributions to the bill. 
Madam Speaker, Chairman SMITH 
has, once again, done a masterful job 
leading us through this process, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
the NDAA. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER). 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2022. Thanks 
to the leadership of Chairman SMITH 
and Ranking Member ROGERS, as well 
as the chairman of the Strategic 
Forces Subcommittee, JIM
COOPER, 
this year’s NDAA was, once again, 
compiled and reported for consider-
ation on the floor today in a bipartisan 
manner. This bill is also the product of 
the diligent work of the committee 
staff whom I would like to thank in-
cluding the Strategic Forces Sub-
committee’s 
PSMs, 
Maria 
Vastola, 
Grant Schneider, Ryan Tully, Whitney 
Verett, and Zach Taylor, as well as the 
committee’s majority staff director, 
Paul Arcangeli, and minority staff di-
rector, Chris Vieson. 
Admiral Richard, the Commander of 
U.S. Strategic Command, has told us 
we are facing a situation our Nation 
has not encountered before. We must 
deter two peer nuclear-capable com-
petitors simultaneously and must do so 
with each being deterred differently. I 
am confident that the FY 2022 NDAA 
before us today places us on the right 
path to properly observe both Russia 
and China. 
First and foremost, the bill increases 
top line defense spending by nearly $25 
billion, reversing the harmful and 
reckless cuts from the President’s 
budget, ensuring an annual growth of 5 
percent over the previous year, and 
funding the DOD’s most critical un-
funded priorities. 
Next, with one exception, the NDAA 
continues to fully fund programs with-
in the Department of Defense and De-
partment of Energy that modernize the 
Nation’s nuclear triad and modernize 
the nuclear command, control, and 
communications systems. This is espe-
cially critical to maintaining a safe, 
secure, and reliable strategic deterrent 
while China is undergoing an unprece-
dented and massive nuclear build-up 
and Russia is undertaking significant 
modernization of all three legs of its 
triad. Also, both Russia and China are 
developing brand-new, novel nuclear 
delivery systems. 
This NDAA fully funds capabilities 
necessary for the defense of Guam and 
prohibits reduction of our ICBM inven-
tory while simultaneously halting ef-
forts to retire or reconvert our low- 
yield nuclear warheads, which are cur-
rently deployed in defense of our Na-
tion. And this NDAA reverses Presi-
dent Biden’s detrimental and dan-
gerous budgetary cuts to our missile 
defense systems. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members to support this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN), who 
is a member of the committee. 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
This measure, which passed out of 
our committee with a strong bipartisan 
vote, 
reflects 
our 
commitment 
to 
strengthening our national security 
and serving those who serve all of us. 
I am particularly proud of the efforts 
of the Seapower and Projection Forces 
Subcommittee. This bill reflects the 
constructive input of members of the 
subcommittee from both sides of the 
aisle and makes a strong mark on our 
national security priorities on, above, 
and below the seas. 
For shipbuilding, the bill expands on 
the budget request to authorize 13 bat-
tle force ships. This reflects our com-
mittee’s focused effort to scrub the 
budget and our shipbuilding plans to 
augment our Navy fleet responsibly 
and consistently in a manner which 
our industrial base can support to re-
spond to emerging threats around the 
world. This includes the sustained con-
struction of two Virginia-class sub-
marines a year and continued produc-
tion of the Columbia-class submarine 
program. We augment our surface ca-
pabilities by authorizing three new 
DDG 51 destroyers, one of our most ca-
pable surface platforms, and author-
izing the Navy to seek a new contract 
for up to 15 ships over the next 5 years. 
This bill also continues the commit-
tee’s efforts to provide the Navy and 
Defense Department with tools needed 
to concurrently build the new 12 sub 
Columbia class without suffocating the 
rest of the Navy’s fleet. Specifically, 
the bill expands the authority of the 
National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to 
allow for multiyear, continuous pro-
duction of key components. Recent 
data from the Navy shows that the use 
of 
this 
authority 
since 
our 
sub-
committee enacted it in 2015 has al-
ready saved the Navy $1.4 billion in the 
Columbia program to the tune of over 
$100 million per boat. This bill will in-
crease those cost savings by expanding 
the scope of those tools to other com-
ponents of the platform. 
The bill also includes full funding to 
start the new sealift Tanker Security 
Program, an initiative we passed last 
year to get more U.S.-built tankers to 
sea. The bill supports the budget re-
quest for the fifth planned National Se-
curity Multi-Mission Vessel, another 
initiative to boost maritime training 
and sealift capacity. 
At every step of the way, our sub-
committee and the full committee ac-
commodated many bipartisan initia-
tives throughout this process. That is 
how the legislative process should 
work, and we are proud that our com-
mittee remains a place for constructive 
bipartisan collaboration. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of our Na-
tion’s security, I urge support for the 
bill. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN), 
who is the ranking member of the 
Readiness Subcommittee. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4800 
September 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4350. We have maintained 
the bipartisan tradition of the Armed 
Services Committee. 
Now, while this administration pro-
motes weakness abroad and tyranny at 
home, robust support for defense in 
this bill ensures that our adversaries 
understand that our military has the 
resources required to stymy their ag-
gressive ambitions which will guar-
antee that our military will succeed if 
called upon. 
This legislation will enhance readi-
ness by funding the unfunded requests 
of the services and the co-coms. It will 
maintain our commitment to the nu-
clear triad and modernization and ag-
gressively enhance our space capabili-
ties. It protects our troops against pun-
ishment for personal politics, prohibits 
dishonorable discharge for COVID vac-
cination refusal, and requires a plan for 
exemptions. And it begins to hold the 
Biden administration accountable for 
Afghanistan. 
Now, while this bill fosters U.S.- 
Israeli cooperation, including $300 mil-
lion for multiple collaborative pro-
grams, 
anti-Israel 
Democrats 
have 
stripped the continuing resolution of $1 
billion for the Iron Dome missile de-
fense system. 
What does it say about the Progres-
sive Caucus that they object to Israeli 
citizens 
defending 
themselves 
from 
missile attacks? 
It is reprehensible and anti-Semitic. 
Nevertheless, this bill as it currently 
stands is a bipartisan bill. 
I thank the chairman and ranking 
member for maintaining the collabo-
rative nature of our committee. I want 
to thank especially the chairman of 
the Readiness Subcommittee, JOHN 
GARAMENDI, for his leadership and com-
mitment to bipartisanship. I thank my 
readiness team, Ian, Dave, and Whit-
ney, for their invaluable hard work 
during this process. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI), who is the chairman of 
the Readiness Subcommittee. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in support of the fiscal 
year 2022 NDAA. I would like to start 
by thanking Chairman SMITH; Ranking 
Member ROGERS; and my colleague on 
the subcommittee, Mr. LAMBORN; and, 
of course, the House Armed Services 
staff who have worked many long 
nights putting this NDAA together. 
The bill that is before the House is a 
good bill, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support it. 
The jurisdiction of the Readiness 
Subcommittee covers a broad range of 
topics 
from 
civilian 
personnel, 
sustainment, and contested logistics to 
military construction, energy safety 
and environmental policy. With that in 
mind, I would just like to highlight 
some of the issues we have dealt with. 
Consistent with our work over the 
last 2 years, the readiness provisions 
continue efforts to address the climate 
change challenges of extreme weather 
and the necessity to reduce the green-
house gas emitted by the U.S. mili-
tary—the largest single emitter in the 
world. We require each installation to 
develop a master plan to do these 
things. 
The health and safety of our service-
members will always be a top priority 
of the subcommittee. The bill elevates 
the department’s focus on safety by es-
tablishing the Joint Safety Council and 
requiring the DOD to develop a plan for 
the establishment of a Mishap Inves-
tigation Review Board to provide over-
sight and independent review of safety 
and mishap investigations. 
This mark continues the subcommit-
tee’s work to improve the conditions 
for the servicemembers and their qual-
ity-of-life infrastructures, such as mili-
tary family housing, barracks, and 
child development centers. 
We also step up the military’s re-
quirement to address the PFAS con-
tamination on and off bases. 
The bill helps advance our military’s 
near-term readiness goals and drives 
the department to plan for and take ac-
tion against long-term threats. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the fiscal year 2022 
NDAA. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of 
the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Author-
ization Act (NDAA). I would like to start by 
thanking Chairman SMITH, Ranking Member 
ROGERS, and the House Armed Services 
Committee staff who have worked many long 
nights putting together this year’s NDAA. The 
bill that is before the House is a good bill, and 
I encourage my colleagues to support its pas-
sage. 
As the Chairman of the Readiness Sub-
committee, I believe the bill upholds our re-
sponsibility to provide congressional oversight 
of and support to the sustainment, logistics, in-
frastructure, and readiness of our military. I’d 
like to take a moment and thank my staff for 
their 
tireless 
work—the 
Readiness 
Sub-
committee staff, Jeanine Womble, Melanie 
Harris, Jay Vallario, Wendell White, Ian 
Bennitt, Dave Sienicki, and Sean Falvey, and 
my personal staff, Betsy Thompson, Rebecca 
Wolf, and Scott Bohn. I am proud of the Read-
iness Subcommittee’s contribution to this 
year’s bill, and I’d like to highlight the following 
provisions. 
Consistent with our work from the last two 
years, the Readiness provisions in the NDAA 
continue efforts to address the climate change 
challenges of extreme weather and the neces-
sity to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted 
by the U.S. military, the largest single entity in 
the world. The bill: 
Requires each military department to com-
plete installation master plans at two of their 
most at-risk installations within one year of en-
actment; 
Requires the Department to amend DOD 
building codes to require consideration of 
microgrids with islanding capability as part of 
planned new construction, and encourages the 
department to renegotiate contracts related to 
existing 
on-installation 
renewable 
energy 
projects to enhance installation resiliency dur-
ing power disruptions; 
Requires installation commanders to consult 
with local governments to ensure installation 
master plans include outside the fence line re-
siliency considerations; 
Requires the Department to assess energy 
and water usage at existing data centers and 
set conservation goals for new data centers; 
and 
Requires the Department to include EV 
charging infrastructure needs in their planning 
for new domestic military construction, and re-
quires the Department to adopt industry stand-
ard planning considerations in the develop-
ment and rollout of charging infrastructure at 
military installations. 
The bill also builds on efforts to address 
contested logistics challenges involving near- 
peer competitors by strengthening operational 
energy programs: 
Requires the Department to create a work-
ing group of program planners, energy staff, 
joint staff, and geographic combatant com-
mands to enhance integration of military de-
partment energy initiatives into operational 
planning and platform development to combat 
contested logistics challenges; 
Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Energy, Installations, and Environment to 
report on alternative fuels and mandates the 
conduct of a wholistic review of the associated 
production, transportation, geopolitical, com-
mercial, and research and development of al-
ternative energy; and 
Requires the Secretary of Defense to des-
ignate a Combatant Command as the agency 
responsible for global bulk fuel storage, deliv-
ery, and distribution, and directs the so-des-
ignated Combatant Command to conduct a 
strategy on the infrastructure and programs 
necessary to optimally support global bulk fuel 
management of the Department of Defense. 
The FY22 NDAA also builds on the Commit-
tee’s previous legislative and oversight activi-
ties to address poor conditions in barracks, 
child development centers and housing: 
Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Energy, Installations, and Environment to 
report on and provide a list of domestic facili-
ties and average facility childcare wait list, as-
sess efforts to find solutions and reduce wait 
times, assess the extent to which staffing 
availability impacts childcare availability, and 
assess whether including childcare facilities in 
agreements for new private housing would be 
an effective solution; 
Requires the military departments to con-
duct safety inspections and develop 10-year 
facility improvement plans for child develop-
ment centers; and 
Requires the Department to place higher 
priority on the sustainment of quality-of-life fa-
cilities such as barracks by setting aside a 
percentage of infrastructure sustainment funds 
for that purpose. 
Additionally, the bill builds on the commit-
tee’s oversight activities to address prevent-
able training accidents and build a culture of 
safety in the military departments: 
Establishes a Joint Safety Council within the 
Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense that 
advises on all operational safety matters, es-
tablishes safety standards, collects and ana-
lyzes safety data, and develops safety prior-
ities; 
Addresses concerns about the quality and 
objectivity of the military department’s mishap 
investigations by directing the Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense to develop a plan for the es-
tablishment of a Mishap Investigation Review

Board, which would provide oversight and 
independent review of mishap investigations; 
Requires the Secretaries of the Army and 
Marine Corps to develop a plan to address the 
recommendations contained in GAO’s recent 
report on tactical vehicle mishaps; and 
Requires the Secretary of Defense to review 
the risks, benefits, and plans for enhancing 
the protections for combat uniforms in an ef-
fort to protect service members from flash 
fires. 
Furthermore, the bill continues efforts to ad-
dress contamination associated with per- and 
polyfluorinated compounds on and around 
military installations: 
Requires the Department of Defense to re-
view current practices to prevent or mitigate 
AFFF spills and promulgate best practices for 
spill prevention and mitigation, enterprise 
wide; 
Increases transparency and facilitates infor-
mation-sharing with defense communities im-
pacted by PFAS contamination; and 
Places a temporary moratorium on the incin-
eration of PFAS-contaminated materials until 
DOD adopts and promulgates EPA interim 
guidance for disposal. 
The bill continues to build on efforts to sup-
port the Department of Defense civilian work-
force: 
Requires the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a report detailing the number of military, 
civilian, and contractor personnel assigned to 
or employed by OSD over the past ten years, 
to assess whether the number of civilian billets 
in OSD-Policy has kept pace with changes in 
the organization’s mission over time, and to 
provide a recommendation as to whether an 
increase to OSD’s statutory personnel caps is 
necessary to ensure sufficient civilian staffing 
and enable corrective action for any inappro-
priate contracting; 
Prohibits changes to the size or function of 
the Naval Audit Service until the Comptroller 
General completes a report on the operations 
of the Naval Audit Service; 
Requires the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop a plan to address the recommendations 
contained in the Comptroller General of the 
United States report entitled ‘‘Sexual Harass-
ment and Assault: Guidance Needed to En-
sure Consistent Tracking, Response, and 
Training for Department of Defense Civilians;’’ 
and 
Requires that the Secretary of Defense to 
establish relevant metrics, collect and report 
on diversity statistics, and report on the status 
of diversity and inclusion efforts among the ci-
vilian work force. 
The bill also continues efforts to ensure 
modern weapons systems are sustainable and 
affordable over time and to support our indus-
trial base: 
Requires the Comptroller General to report 
on organic maintenance capability and capac-
ity within the F–35 program including depot 
standup, technical data requirements, unique 
tooling, and contractor assistance in depot 
standup; assess the potential to transition sup-
ply-chain management from a contractor-led to 
a government-led function, and; assess key 
field-level maintenance challenges as well as 
mitigating actions. 
Requires the Comptroller General to provide 
annual reports in the years 2022–2025 on the 
F–35 program sustainment system, including 
an analysis of the sustainment strategy, an 
analysis of the Department’s ability to reduce 
costs toward affordability metrics, and an anal-
ysis of the Department’s efforts to provide 
oversight of key contractor-led sustainment 
functions. 
Requires the Secretary of Defense to initiate 
a pilot program to develop a digital twin of the 
facilities and operations of at least one gov-
ernment-owned and operated military depot 
that is not a shipyard. 
Requires the Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Tech-
nology to review efforts to digitize field-level 
maintenance for ground vehicles. 
The FY22 NDAA supports the missions at 
Travis and Beale Air Force Bases in my dis-
trict, and I’m also pleased this NDAA includes 
a 2.7 percent pay raise for our troops. Addi-
tional provisions that I was instrumental in se-
curing include: 
Requiring the Secretary of Defense to con-
tinue the FireGuard program, where the Na-
tional Guard assists in detecting and moni-
toring wildfires, for at least the next five years; 
Including bill language that adds trans-
parency to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet pro-
gram, and that aligns requirements for charter 
transportation of both Department of Defense 
personnel and cargo; 
Prohibiting the use of open-air burn pits dur-
ing overseas contingency operations unless 
an exemption is issued by the President of 
The United States for a particular location. 
Thirty days after an exemption is granted, the 
President would be required to submit a report 
to Congress detailing the location, size, dura-
tion, and need of the burn pit, the number of 
personnel assigned to the location, and the 
personal protective equipment or other meth-
ods that will be used by those personnel to 
mitigate the health effects of said pit; 
Directing the Department to pay fees asso-
ciated with the transfer of adopted dogs to the 
adoption agency or individual and directing the 
inclusion of veterinary care and services into 
the Joint Trauma Education and Training Di-
rectorate; 
Including significant Facilities Sustainment, 
Restoration, 
and 
Modernization 
(FSRM) 
projects on DOD’s online listing of military 
construction projects and MILCON contracting 
awards; and 
Authorizing the Maritime Administrator to 
use appropriated funds to purchase duplicate 
medals authorized under the Merchant Mari-
ners of World War II Congressional Gold 
Medal Act of 2020. This awards the Congres-
sional Gold Medal—one of our nation’s high-
est honors—to the Merchant Marine Veterans 
of World War II. 
This bill helps advance our military’s near- 
term readiness goals and drives the Depart-
ment to plan for and take action against long- 
term threats, and with that, I urge my col-
leagues to support the FY22 NDAA.

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), 
the ranking member of the Seapower 
and Projection Forces Subcommittee. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
I want to preface by saying that I do 
not agree with everything in this bill, 
but the committee-passed bill is wor-
thy of support. 
I want to especially thank Ranking 
Member ROGERS and Chairman SMITH 
for their attention to minimizing ex-
traneous provisions in the markup that 
have little to do with our national se-
curity or supporting our servicemem-
bers. Our struggle to close conference 
last year because of these issues were 
wholly associated with provisions that 
are not connected to national security. 
And these attempts, I believe, were of-
fensive, and similar attempts to in-
clude these unnecessary provisions this 
year should be rebuffed. 
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI has 
not listened to the lessons learned from 
last year’s conference and has decided 
to add several non-germane bills to the 
NDAA at Rules that have nothing to do 
with defense. 
I want to make this clear for my col-
leagues offering these amendments: We 
should not use servicemembers as a 
tool to achieve partisan gain. I repeat: 
We should not use servicemembers as a 
tool to achieve partisan gain. And I 
voted in opposition to the rule, but I 
hope that I can vote for final passage of 
this year’s NDAA. 
As to the committee mark, we start-
ed with an anemic budget request from 
the Biden administration that in the 
Seapower 
portfolio 
requested 
only 
eight ships, two of which were fleet 
tugboats. How the administration can 
set China as the pacing threat and re-
duce Navy force structure is simply 
baffling. 
Fortunately, with the leadership of 
Ranking Member ROGERS and others on 
the committee, we were able to author-
ize additional funds to the defense top 
line to provide the real growth nec-
essary to dissuade future conflict. With 
this, we authorized 13 battle force ships 
and rebuffed the administration’s re-
quest to retire three cruisers. 
Additionally, we sought to expand 
the submarine industrial base by au-
thorizing funds that enable a sub-
marine construction build rate of three 
by 2025. The mark also includes critical 
capabilities to support our Nation’s de-
terrence with continued strong invest-
ments in the Columbia-class ballistic 
missile submarine and the B–21 Raider 
bomber. 
I think this is a good bill in its cur-
rent form, and it is worthy of my col-
leagues’ support. 
MR. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself 11⁄2 minutes 
just to address a couple things the gen-
tleman from Virginia said. 
I want to be clear, it is the long-
standing practice of our committee 
that we take issues that are not in our 
jurisdiction. We have done it under Re-
publican leadership. We have done it 
under Democratic leadership. 
It is also the longstanding practice of 
our committee to work with the com-
mittees of jurisdiction, and only if in a 
bipartisan, bicameral way those com-
mittees of jurisdiction agree, does it 
ultimately go into the conference re-
port. So you don’t need to be afraid of 
stuff that you don’t like. Work with

your committees of jurisdiction and it 
goes into the conference report if we 
get agreement. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. 
Second, last year that is not what 
held us up. The two things that held us 
up last year were one thing that was 
very much within the jurisdiction of 
this committee, and that was whether 
or not to rename military bases; to 
change the names of the bases named 
for Confederates, very much in our ju-
risdiction. 
And the second thing was President 
Trump’s last-second desire, out of no-
where, to add section 230 to the bill. We 
weren’t held up by these things, and we 
will not be held up this year. If the 
committees 
of 
jurisdiction 
do 
not 
agree, we don’t do it. We just have that 
negotiation. If they can, we give them 
a ride. So don’t need to worry about 
that. It is a good bill. Go ahead and 
vote for it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
SPEIER), the chairwoman of the Mili-
tary Personnel Subcommittee. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to speak in support of this bill 
which passed out of our committee 
with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
This year’s NDAA continues the com-
mittee’s tradition of improving the 
lives of servicemembers and their fami-
lies by supporting a 2.7 percent pay 
raise; increasing parental leave for new 
mothers and fathers, including adop-
tive and foster parents; expanding fi-
nancial assistance for in-home child 
care; improving the legal representa-
tion for exceptional family members; 
and demanding an independent review 
of suicides. 
Following the horrifying murder of 
Specialist 
Vanessa 
Guillen 
and 
a 
ground swell of activism from sur-
vivors of military sexual trauma, H.R. 
4350 also boldly confronts sexual as-
sault and harassment in the military, 
which has been one of my top priorities 
for a decade, by removing the com-
mander from decisions related to pros-
ecution of special victim crimes, im-
proving sexual harassment investiga-
tions, and continuing to improve mili-
tary criminal investigative resources. 
It also establishes standalone of-
fenses for sexual harassment and vio-
lent extremism under the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice. 
These reforms will increase trust in 
the military justice system and en-
courage survivors of sexual violence to 
come forward. The bill also requires an 
independent 
review 
of 
whether 
to 
transfer additional offenses such as 
murder that are out of the chain of 
command. 
Where servicemembers serve, so do 
their families. That has been our 
mantra on this subcommittee, which is 
why this bill ensures that the military 
health system continues to have suffi-
cient providers to meet beneficiaries’ 
healthcare needs. 
H.R. 4350 also improves services cov-
ered under TRICARE, including contra-
ception, without copays. 
Together, servicemembers and their 
families make sacrifices for our Na-
tion, and we must continue our com-
mitment to them. 
I want to thank the ranking member, 
Congressman MIKE GALLAGHER, the ex-
traordinary staff of the committee: 
Ilka Regino, David Giachetti, Hannah 
Kaufman, Glen Diehl, and the fearless 
Staff Director Paul Arcangeli, and also 
Josh Connolly and Brian Collins from 
my staff. 
Thanks 
to 
Chairman 
SMITH
and 
Ranking Member ROGERS for an ex-
traordinary NDAA. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER), the ranking member of the 
Tactical Air and Land Forces Sub-
committee. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 
each year Congress considers one of the 
most important pieces of legislation, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. I applaud the bipartisan leader-
ship of Chairman ADAM
SMITH
and 
Ranking Member MIKE ROGERS. 
And as the ranking member of the 
Tactical Air and Land Forces Sub-
committee, I want to thank our sub-
committee chairman, DONALD
NOR-
CROSS, for his collaborative, bipartisan 
efforts. 
I am pleased the committee approved 
a bipartisan amendment in markup to 
increase the top line by $23.9 billion. 
This increase is needed to continue the 
progress we have made in rebuilding 
readiness and will facilitate moderniza-
tion programs necessary to prepare our 
military forces to compete with, deter, 
and win against peer challengers and 
adversaries. 
Under the subcommittee’s jurisdic-
tion, this bill continues critical over-
sight of the Air Force, Navy, and Ma-
rine Corps’ strike-fighter force struc-
ture and inventory management, set-
ting better conditions for ensuring the 
right mix of fourth and fifth generation 
fighters, and managing operational 
risk. Specifically, this legislation au-
thorizes funding for 80 F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighters, 24 F–15EX aircraft, 
and 12 F/A–18 Super Hornets. 
The legislation also reverses several 
proposed cuts, including procurement 
for the Army’s small caliber ammuni-
tion 
accounts. 
It 
also 
facilitates 
stronger oversight to ensure current 
ISR and counter UAS capabilities and 
capacity 
are 
maintained 
and 
prioritized to mitigate near-term oper-
ational risk and prevent future capa-
bility gaps. 
Outside the subcommittee’s jurisdic-
tion, I am pleased that this bill in-
cludes several provisions regarding the 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, including my provision requiring 
an accounting of the decision to leave 
Bagram Air Base. 
I am also pleased this legislation in-
cludes two of my bills, the CADET Act 
and the Connecting the Community to 
End Military Suicide Act. 
I do have concerns with several pro-
visions in the underlying bill, including 
the selective service, and I am hopeful 
we can work in a bipartisan manner to 
address those. I encourage support. 
MR. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. NORCROSS), the chair of the Tac-
tical 
Air 
and 
Land 
Forces 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his work and 
commitment to this country’s secu-
rity. 
Madam Speaker, this bill continues 
the long, proud tradition of bipartisan 
work for the Tactical Air and Land 
Subcommittee; our commitment to se-
curing our Nation and willingness to 
work through and share responsibility 
for the tough choices resulting in this 
bill, a bill that keeps America’s land 
and air forces the best in the world. 
I particularly want to thank our 
ranking member, Mrs. HARTZLER, for 
her input, her steadfast support in 
building this strong, bipartisan bill. 
Certainly, though we may disagree at 
times, we put the safety and security 
of our Nation and servicemen first and 
work together to pass this vital piece 
of legislation. 
I also want to thank our vice chair, 
Representative SHERRILL of New Jer-
sey, for her help. 
Madam Speaker, this bill equips and 
modernizes our Armed Forces by care-
fully and thoughtfully managing re-
sources. At the same time, this bill 
continues the necessary oversight to 
ensure responsibility of the execution 
by the DOD. This bill enacts: Vigorous 
oversight of our most complex and ex-
pensive program, the F–35, certainly an 
ambitious modernization strategy by 
the Army and a host of others; and of 
particular importance to me and Mrs. 
HARTZLER, strong support for risk re-
duction in our defense industrial base. 
To this point, this bill also includes 
my Buy American provision, which 
brings back jobs to the U.S. and can 
ensure that we get what we need when 
we need it, securing our fragile supply 
chain. 
I do want to take a moment in clos-
ing to thank the subcommittee staff, 
those who serve on this committee, 
certainly, led by Bill Sutey, Heath 
Bope, Carla Zeppieri, Liz Griffin, and 
Kelly Repair, and the last day of our 
clerk, Caroline, who has done a won-
derful job; and to my personal staff, 
Katie Lee, Chris Macleish, and Mark 
Moses. 
This is a bill that America can sup-
port and, certainly, we are encouraging 
all our Members to support this NDAA 
for fiscal year ‘22. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY), 
the ranking member of the Intelligence 
and Special Operations Subcommittee. 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise in strong support 
of the FY22 NDAA. Our military has 
and is facing unprecedented challenges, 
and this body is duty-bound to ensure

September 21, 2021 
our military is adequately funded and 
has the tools to win. We also do this by 
empowering American companies and 
the industrial base that provides goods 
and services to the DOD. 
The hardworking Mississippians who 
work for companies like Airbus, Hun-
tington Ingalls, Winchester, General 
Dynamics, Stark Aerospace, SpaceX 
and General Atomics keep our Nation 
safe and deserve the support of our 
Congress. 
This 
bill 
includes 
a 
Republican 
amendment boosting the defense top 
line by nearly $25 billion and reverses 
the administration’s reckless cuts to 
our national security, restoring fund-
ing for shipbuilding, procurement, mis-
sile defense, and modernization. 
This bill will also fund the unfunded 
top priorities of our military that the 
White House failed to support. Once 
passed, this bill further bolsters our 
military’s ability to maintain its domi-
nance in every domain, and ensures 
military leaders have the resources to 
take care of servicemembers and mili-
tary families. 
Additionally, this year’s NDAA will 
begin the process of holding the White 
House accountable for the mistakes in 
Afghanistan. For months, we have 
asked for more detail on the so-called 
over-the-horizon strategy to conduct 
counterterrorism. We received scant 
details ahead of the withdrawal, and 
America deserves answers to why the 
withdrawal was so unorganized in plan-
ning and execution run by the Com-
mander in Chief and the State Depart-
ment. 
The lack of planning leading up to 
the withdrawal and the continued in-
ability to maintain control on the 
ground by this administration is stag-
gering. 
The 
Armed 
Services 
Com-
mittee, 
particularly 
this 
Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Special 
Operations, will not allow these weak-
nesses of the administration to con-
tinue to place our citizens, allies, part-
ners, and overall national security at 
risk. 
This year’s bill calls for the adminis-
tration to provide a plan to get the rest 
of the American citizens out. 
Finally, I would be remiss without 
asking about my teammates, which is 
Tony Starks, Colin Hawkins, and Rod-
ney Hall, professional staffer, Patrick 
Nevins, and my battle buddy in all of 
this, Ranking Member GALLEGO. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO), 
the chair of the Intelligence and Spe-
cial Operations Subcommittee. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4350, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2022. 
I congratulate my colleagues for ful-
filling our obligation to debate and 
pass the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. This year’s bill contains mul-
tiple provisions to address strategic 
challenges presented by China, to con-
front our adversaries in the gray zone 
of conflict, and to strengthen the rela-
tionships with key allies and partners. 
As chair of the Intelligence and Spe-
cial Operations Subcommittee, I am 
proud of the provisions in this bill that 
represent critical reforms to the de-
fense intelligence enterprise, special 
operations 
forces, 
our 
ability 
to 
counter weapons of mass destruction. 
b 2145 
Our bill creates more agility across 
the defense intelligence enterprise by 
breaking down barriers to information 
sharing to enhance warfighters and 
combatant commanders in their ability 
to counter China and Russia in the in-
formation environment and focusing on 
expanding access to partners such as 
India and our steadfast Nordic partners 
such as Finland. 
The bill further supports rigorous 
oversight of our security posture in Af-
ghanistan and includes provisions to 
better understand the Department’s 
plans to address the threat environ-
ment while postured in an over-the-ho-
rizon capacity. Importantly, the bill 
also contains $500 million in relocation 
support for Afghan SIV holders. 
Finally, our bill authorizes an in-
crease of $105 million to the Coopera-
tive Threat Reduction Program, which 
will enhance our efforts to detect and 
fight emergent chemical and biological 
threats and develop medical counter-
measures such as vaccines and thera-
peutics. 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
subcommittee Ranking Member TRENT 
KELLY for his contribution to this bill 
and his bipartisanship, which helped 
create the foundations of such a strong 
bill during a particularly challenging 
year. I would also like to thank the 
staff—Shannon Green, Jessica Carroll, 
Zachary Taylor, and Patrick Nevins— 
for their tireless efforts to get it across 
the finish line. 
Colleagues, in addition to meeting 
the most pressing security challenges 
we face as a Nation today, this bill sup-
ports our servicemembers with a 2.7 
percent pay raise, increases parental 
leave for military families, improves 
women’s healthcare, and combats ex-
tremism in the military. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA-
GHER), the ranking member of the Mili-
tary Personnel Subcommittee. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I 
stand before you today in proud sup-
port of this bipartisan bill, which is a 
reflection of the hard work of both 
sides that went into this. This process 
remains some of the most gratifying 
work that we do in Congress and a tes-
tament to the way in which this insti-
tution can work when we put our mind 
to it. 
The FY22 NDAA includes a top-line 
budget that restores funding for ship-
building, procurement, missile defense, 
and a number of other priorities that 
will help ensure the national defense of 
our great Nation. 
The bill that was voted out of com-
mittee continues to support and im-
prove the lives of those who sacrifice 
for our country on a daily basis by au-
thorizing a military basic pay raise of 
2.7 percent. 
This bill reinforces the committee’s 
longstanding commitment to the mili-
tary family by requiring the Depart-
ment of Defense to increase parental 
leave, expands the in-home childcare 
pilot program, and improves support 
available to military families with spe-
cial needs children. 
This bill also addresses the threat of 
COVID–19 by prohibiting the use of 
DOD funds to conduct research, includ-
ing biomedical, infectious disease, and 
genomic research in China or with any 
entity controlled by the Chinese Com-
munist Party. It requires DOD to re-
port to Congress on the number of mili-
tary 
personnel 
infected 
with 
coronavirus at the 2019 Military World 
Games in Wuhan, China, and requires 
DOD and the Director of National In-
telligence to assess the involvement of 
the Chinese Communist Party in the 
origins of COVID–19. 
I thank the chairman and ranking 
member for an outstanding bipartisan 
bill. I thank them both for their work 
on it, and I am proud to be a member 
of this committee. 
Let’s do our duty. Let’s support serv-
icemembers, military families, and re-
tirees. Let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, at this time, I have no further 
speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and 
Information Systems. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4350, the FY22 
NDAA. 
Our current and future warfighting 
capabilities are contingent on modern-
izing the Department of Defense and 
recruiting and equipping the military 
with the most effective, secure, and 
cutting-edge technologies. 
Our adversaries are focused on our 
defeat on and off the battlefield. They 
are pouring money into research and 
development of emerging technologies, 
recruiting top scientists, and stealing 
intellectual property to gain a tactical 
edge. 
This NDAA pushes the Department 
to accelerate innovation and strength-
en its cyber posture, a critical capa-
bility if we want to maintain superi-
ority in the era of great power com-
petition. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
ROGERS, who, because of his leadership, 
fought for and gained nearly $25 billion 
in this bill to boost emerging tech-
nologies and cybersecurity programs 
during the markup.

These 
funds 
enhance 
areas 
like 
hypersonics, AI, and quantum com-
puting and make a historical invest-
ment to renovate the Department’s 
labs and testing facilities. 
As ranking member, I am also proud 
of the work that we have done on our 
subcommittee, the Cyber, Innovative 
Technologies, and Information Sys-
tems Subcommittee led by Chairman 
LANGEVIN, in this inaugural NDAA for 
this subcommittee. 
We included provisions to transition 
innovative technologies quickly into 
the hands of the warfighter, to help 
companies bridge the valley of death, 
and to implement many of the rec-
ommendations of the National Secu-
rity Commission on AI. 
In the past year, we have seen land-
mark cyberattacks, a trend which is 
likely to continue, and we must be pre-
pared. We bolster and strengthen the 
Department’s information security sys-
tems and improve sharing and analysis 
of cyber threat information across the 
Department. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this bill and encourage my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), a 
great member of the Armed Services 
Committee. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. I commend the out-
standing leadership of Chairman SMITH 
and Ranking Member MIKE ROGERS for 
delivering strong, bipartisan legisla-
tion that provides for our common de-
fense. 
While I am personally grateful that 
this bill includes dozens of my provi-
sions, I am most proud of the fact that 
the bill sends a clear bipartisan mes-
sage that we must keep our national 
defense spending level with inflation 
and reject the temptation to cut de-
fense when our allies and enemies are 
questioning American leadership. As 
the White House’s own strategic guid-
ance states, America must confront 
global challenges from a position of 
strength, not weakness. 
I am also proud that this bill in-
cludes multiple provisions ensuring 
oversight and accountability for the re-
cent debacle in Afghanistan. As we 
stand here today, this crisis is ongoing, 
with hundreds of U.S. citizens and resi-
dents, including my constituents from 
Nebraska, who are still trapped in Af-
ghanistan. Oversight of the way the 
botched withdrawal was handled is not 
and should not be a partisan issue, and 
I am proud that the House has not 
backed away from its responsibilities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE), one of 
our outstanding freshman Members. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the MILCON 
amendment. 
This is actually something that we 
agree on, that most people would agree 
on. We have apartments that our air-
men are staying in at Hill Air Force 
Base where literally they have to sec-
tion off corners of the sidewalk because 
bricks are falling off the building. 
This is not up to the standard of 
what we would like to provide for our 
men and women who are willing to go 
and serve in this capacity. This is 
something that we all agree on. 
The reason I stand to oppose the 
amendment is because it just increases 
the costs for a MILCON budget that is 
already laden with a lot of work with 
very little money. This will require a 
sort of preference for local hiring, 
which is a good thing, but it also adds 
in a lot of bureaucracy with respect to 
licensing and making sure that every 
single military construction contractor 
has all the little prerequisites for each 
State. This is something that we have 
rejected in the past, and it ultimately 
just adds a lot of cost. 
It is ironic that both the Trump and 
Biden administrations disagree with 
this. Chambers of commerce actually 
oppose this. A few others that are note-
worthy are the defense industry of 
America, Association of General Con-
tractors, and American Council of En-
gineering Companies. They all oppose 
this effort. 
Again, this impacts the skilled work-
force. Every single construction com-
pany that I talk to right now says they 
can’t even hire in their local area. So 
to require companies to go to each area 
where there is a base and take away 
some of their skilled workforce to then 
go hire a workforce that is in that par-
ticular city, it adds an extra burden. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), 
an outstanding member of our Armed 
Services Committee. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4350, this year’s National Defense Au-
thorization Act. As a member of the 
Armed Services Committee, I was hon-
ored to have a seat at the table in 
crafting this legislation, and I am 
pleased to have been successful in hav-
ing a good number of my priorities for 
Oklahoma’s Fifth District included in 
this bill. 
As a new member of the House 
Armed Services Committee, I was deep-
ly concerned when President Biden pro-
posed earlier this year to essentially 
cut our defense budget below the rate 
of inflation at a time when we are fac-
ing serious threats from around the 
world. 
I am thankful for the leadership of 
Ranking Member ROGERS in securing a 
bipartisan deal in this bill to provide 
the additional resources needed to 
meet our Nation’s defense needs. This 
bill makes important investments to 
protect our Nation from dangerous ad-
versaries like Russia and China. 
I also fought to include several items 
in the bill we are considering today, in-
cluding a measure I co-led with Con-
gresswoman GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N
to re-
quire DOD to survey access to mental 
health and suicide prevention services 
within the military healthcare system, 
as well as a modified version of my bill 
to protect servicemembers and their 
families with disabilities from being 
charged 
out-of-pocket 
expenses 
for 
needed ADA upgrades to their on-base 
housing unit. 
Lastly, 
I 
successfully 
advanced 
amendments to require the DOD to 
analyze the security threats resulting 
from the Taliban’s release of thousands 
of prisoners from Bagram Air Base and 
an amendment to increase resources 
for the Army National Guard to assist 
CBP with security operations on the 
southern border in light of the growing 
threats emanating from Afghanistan 
and elsewhere. 
Bottom line, this bill strengthens our 
Nation’s defenses, supports our brave 
servicemembers, and sustains impor-
tant defense programs across the Na-
tion and in my home State of Okla-
homa. 
Madam Speaker, certainly there may 
be provisions of this bill that not ev-
eryone agrees with, but I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
DESJARLAIS), another fine member of 
the Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. The bill before us today represents 
a much-improved effort over the Biden- 
Harris administration’s proposed budg-
et. 
There is no more important job than 
providing for the defense of our Nation. 
The specter of threats from an aggres-
sive China, a revitalized Russia, and 
radical Islamic terrorist states demand 
that we maintain a strong national de-
fense readiness and posture. 
This NDAA will give a much-deserved 
and needed pay raise and expanded ben-
efits to members of our armed services. 
We are making investments to ensure 
our military is the best equipped and 
trained in the world, with a focus on 
American jobs and our domestic manu-
facturing base. 
We are also investing in important 
new technologies like quantum com-
puting, hypersonic weapons, and auton-
omous systems. 
I am proud to say that Arnold Air 
Force Base, the University of Ten-
nessee Space Institute, Vanderbilt Uni-
versity, Fort Campbell Army Base, Oak

Ridge National Laboratory, and other 
Tennessee stakeholders will receive the 
funds that they need to carry out vital 
operations for our United States mili-
tary. 
That said, the bill is not perfect. I am 
disappointed in House Democrats for 
preventing my ‘‘no first use’’ amend-
ment from coming to the floor for a 
vote. In hearings before our committee, 
our military leadership emphasized 
that a ‘‘no first use’’ policy is a lim-
iting strategic mistake, and a number 
of our allies have expressed these con-
cerns directly to me as well. We should 
never tip our strategic plans to our ad-
versaries. 
It is also disappointing that those on 
the other side of the aisle have taken a 
bill intended to improve our military 
and muddled it with attempts to score 
political points. 
b 2200 
While I don’t support these poison 
pills, I am hopeful that my colleagues 
will remove them during conference be-
fore its final passage. 
That said, we must move forward 
with this legislation. I support making 
it stronger, avoiding nongermane polit-
ical issues, and getting it signed into 
law for our brave men and women in 
uniform. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ), an-
other fine member of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of the tens of thousands of mili-
tary families in northwest Florida, I 
rise in strong support of this year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
This bill does right by military fami-
lies by ensuring that we upgrade train-
ing systems, increasing their pro-
ficiency, and ensuring that our service-
members are safe when they go down 
range. 
The bill enhances platforms and 
equipment survivability to ensure that 
our troops are in the best possible posi-
tion to prevail in every battle and van-
quish any foe. 
The 2.7 percent pay raise is vastly 
needed and is a small debt of gratitude 
for the elite level of patriotism that 
our servicemembers show each and 
every day. 
The bill does right by the mission by 
investing in research, development test 
and evaluation by increasing our in-
vestment in cyber, by ensuring that we 
have a military construction budget 
that allows us to meet ambitious goals 
to be able to grow strategic mission in 
particular areas, and our investment in 
the space force ensures that America 
will always hold the high ground. 
With this legislation, America wins 
the future by focusing on great power 
competition, and by ensuring that we 
win that great power competition with 
great focus and great competence. 
I thank the bipartisan leadership of 
the committee, and I would note that 
that bipartisan leadership has been 
necessary because President Biden’s 
initial budget did not meet the needs of 
the country to the same degree that 
this House will. It is a testament to 
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member 
ROGERS that brighter minds have pre-
vailed. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, as I have made clear, I feel 
very strongly that this is a really 
strong, bipartisan bill. I urge all Mem-
bers of the House to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I just want to agree with Mr. ROGERS. 
This bill, as you can hear from the 
Members speaking in favor of it on 
both sides of the aisle, encompasses a 
lot of different provisions, all designed 
to make sure we can adequately defend 
the country; and, most importantly, 
designed to make sure that we protect 
the men and women who are serving us 
to protect that country. 
There are a lot of provisions in this 
bill focused on improving the quality 
of life, including a 2.7 percent pay in-
crease and significant increases to im-
prove things like childcare centers and 
barracks across the country. 
I think this bill does an excellent job 
of identifying the threats that we face 
and putting ourselves in the best pos-
sible position to meet those threats 
going forward. 
Again, no bill is perfect. We disagree 
on things. Everyone will have some-
thing in here that they wish were 
slightly different, but overall, I think 
we can support this bill. 
I do want to close by once again em-
phasizing, I know there is a lot of angst 
about the amendments that have been 
ruled in order; but, again, that is not 
unusual that we would deal with issues 
that are not necessarily directly within 
our jurisdiction. We work with the 
committees of jurisdiction in order to 
carry those bills. We will continue to 
work on that. 
I can say with confidence that there 
is no amendment that has been ruled in 
order that we are going to debate on 
that should impact any Members vot-
ing for this bill. This is a very strong 
bill. Do not forget the underlying pro-
visions in this bill that are so impor-
tant to the men and women who are 
serving this country, to the protections 
they need, the protections they de-
serve, and the protections that it is our 
obligation to provide for them and 
which I feel very, very strongly that 
this bill does. 
This bill deserves support from this 
committee. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

for debate has expired.

sions apply with respect to cannabis-related 
legitimate businesses and service providers. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) 
CBD.—The 
term 
‘‘CBD’’ 
means 
cannabidiol. 
(2) HEMP.—The term ‘‘hemp’’ has the 
meaning given that term under section 297A 
of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 
U.S.C. 1639o). 
(3) HEMP-RELATED LEGITIMATE BUSINESS.— 
The term ‘‘hemp-related legitimate busi-
ness’’ means a manufacturer, producer, or

Law 115–334) and the regulations issued to 
implement such Act by the Department of 
Agriculture, where applicable, and the law of 
a State or political subdivision thereof or In-

SEC. 5412. BANKING SERVICES FOR HEMP-RE-
LATED 
LEGITIMATE 
BUSINESSES 
AND HEMP-RELATED SERVICE PRO-
VIDERS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
(1) the Agriculture Improvement Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–334) legalized hemp by 
removing it from the definition of ‘‘mari-
huana’’ under the Controlled Substances 
Act; 
(2) despite the legalization of hemp, some 
hemp businesses (including producers, manu-
facturers, and retailers) continue to have dif-
ficulty gaining access to banking products 
and services; and 
(3) businesses involved in the sale of hemp- 
derived CBD products are particularly af-
fected, due to confusion about the legal sta-
tus of such products. 
(b) FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS’ HEMP 
BANKING GUIDANCE.—Not later than the end 
of the 90-day period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Federal banking 
regulators shall update their existing guid-
ance, as applicable, regarding the provision 
of financial services to hemp-related legiti-
mate businesses and hemp-related service 
providers to address— 
(1) compliance with financial institutions’ 
existing obligations under Federal laws and 
implementing regulations determined rel-
evant by the Federal banking regulators, in-
cluding subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, 
United States Code, and its implementing 
regulation in conformity with this title and 
the Department of Agriculture’s rules regu-
lating domestic hemp production (7 CFR 990); 
and 
(2) best practices for financial institutions 
to follow when providing financial services, 
including processing payments, to hemp-re-
lated legitimate businesses and hemp-related 
service providers. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.—The term ‘‘fi-
nancial institution’’— 
(A) has the meaning given that term under 
section 5312(a) of title 31, United States 
Code; and 
(B) includes a bank holding company, as 
defined under section 2(a) of the Bank Hold-
ing Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)).

terms

subject the funds and the account hold-
ers to rigorous anti-money laundering 
and ‘‘know your customer’’ require-
ments. Under FinCEN’s 2014 guidance, 
financial 
institutions 
must 
comply 
with a heightened anti-money laun-
dering reporting regime when pro-
viding services to cannabis businesses. 
This will strengthen the security of our 
financial system and our country by 
keeping bad actors like foreign cartels 
out of the cannabis industry. 
But most importantly, this amend-
ment will reduce the risk of violent 
crime in our communities. By dealing 
in all cash, these businesses and their 
employees become targets for robbery, 
assaults, burglaries, and more. In Colo-
rado, Travis Mason, a young father and 
Marine Corps veteran, was murdered 
while working as a security guard for a 
cannabis business. We cannot wait any 
longer to address this public safety 
threat. 
I want to thank my cosponsors on 
this 
amendment, 
Representatives 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, DAVIDSON, CORREA, BLU-
MENAUER, JOYCE, and BARBARA LEE, as 
well as former Representatives HECK 
and STIVERS. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, this is a fine piece of legisla-
tion in a stand-alone fashion. In fact, I 
voted for the gentleman’s stand-alone 
bill. I think what he is trying to ac-
complish is admirable and should be 
accomplished, but not in the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
He knows that I am not picking on 
his bill. I feel this way about anything 
that is not in our jurisdiction. 
But having said that, the language is 
not related to the NDAA, and I urge op-
position. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I just would remind the gentleman 
from Alabama the matter was deemed 
germane by the Parliamentarian. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
think the reason it was ruled germane 
by the Parliamentarian is the cartels 
control the drug trade in the United 
States. While most States have made 
some legal form for marijuana, the car-
tels still dominate the market. 
Part of the reason is the cash is in 
the black market. Legal operations in 
many states cannot be banked. People 
that work there can’t get mortgages. 
They don’t have access to the banking 
system. The reality is the financial in-
dustry is being pushed by regulators to 
kind of back-door and make something 
illegal. 
This has been done on any number of 
fronts, whether firearms are disfavored 
in some states, well, you know, you 
have reputational risk if you are going 
to bank these people. For too long in 
America we have had a standard that 
said, ‘‘Well, you are not going to bank 
these people, are you?’’ Who ‘‘these 
people’’ are has changed. 
This is preventing us from stopping 
the cartels. It is germane, and I urge 
everyone to support the amendment. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
Governors from 21 States and Terri-
tories endorsing the SAFE Banking 
Act, along with a list of 41 other di-
verse organizations who support the 
legislation.

DEAR
CONGRESSIONAL
LEADERS: As our 
States’ chief executives, we urge Congress to 
pass legislation allowing states with legal-
ized medical or adult-use cannabis to operate 
safely under the national banking system. 
We strongly support the passage of the Se-
cure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking 
Act of 2021 (H.R. 1996/S. 910) or similar legis-
lation that would remove the legal uncer-
tainty and allow banks and credit unions to 
provide services to state-licensed cannabis- 
related businesses. 
We were pleased that the House passed 
similar legislation in the 116th Congress 
(H.R. 1595). The SAFE Banking Act of 2021 al-
ready has more than 165 bipartisan House co-
sponsors and more than 30 bipartisan Senate 
cosponsors. The legislation has also received 
support from more than 30 associations. 
Currently, 36 U.S. states, four U.S. terri-
tories, and the District of Columbia have le-
galized the medical use of cannabis. Addi-
tionally, 18 states, two territories, and the 
District of Columbia have legalized rec-
reational use by adults over 21 years of age. 
Despite legalization of cannabis at the state- 
level, our financial institutions face enor-
mous legal risks and criminal and civil li-
ability under the Controlled Substances Act. 
These barriers disincentive financial institu-
tions from providing banking services to 
state-licensed and regulated cannabis busi-
nesses. 
Because few banks and credit unions pro-
vide these services, state-licensed cannabis 
businesses predominantly operate on a cash 
basis. Without banking services, state-li-
censed cannabis businesses are unable to 
write checks, make and receive electronic 
payments, utilize a payroll provider, or ac-
cept credit and debit cards. Cash only busi-
nesses pose a significant public safety risk to 
customers and employees. The cash-only en-
vironment also burdens state and local gov-
ernment agencies that must collect tax and 
fee payments in person and in cash, which 
creates additional public expenses and em-
ployee safety risks. 
State and federal governments have a 
shared interest in upholding the rule of law, 
protecting public safety, and transitioning 
markets out of the shadows and into our 
transparent and regulated banking system. 
Many of our states have implemented laws 
and regulations to reduce these risks while 
ensuring financial accountability of the can-
nabis industry. These public safety risks can 
be further mitigated on the federal level by 
passing the SAFE Banking Act to provide 
state-licensed cannabis businesses with ac-
cess to banking service providers. 
We urge you to pass the SAFE Banking 
Act of 2021 or similar legislation that would 
provide a safe harbor for depository institu-
tions that provide a financial product or 
service to a state-licensed cannabis business 
in states that have legalized cannabis. We 
look forward to working with you as legisla-
tion progresses to address this urgent public 
policy and safety concern. 
Sincerely,

Governor Ned Lamont, State of Con-
necticut; Governor John Bel Edwards, 
State of Louisiana; Governor Charlie 
Baker, State of Massachusetts; Gov-
ernor Steve Sisolak, State of Nevada;

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the SAFE Banking 
Act as an amendment to the NDAA. 
More than half—let me repeat, more 
than half of the U.S. population lives 
in a State jurisdiction where cannabis 
is legal. Veterans prefer cannabis to 
opioids to treat their invisible wounds 
that they bring back from the battle-
field. 
Cannabis customers and businesses 
are law-abiding citizens and entities, 
yet they have to pay their employees, 
their bills, and their Federal taxes with 
cash. It just does not make sense. 
As my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have pointed out, we need to 
get rid of that gray black market, 
bring this cash business into the bank-
ing system. 
Again, I rise in strong support of this 
commonsense measure. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time 
to close. 
This is a public safety and a national 
security matter, very germane to the 
issues at hand, dealing with foreign 
cartels and particularly the cash that 
is developed by this business that leads 
to crime. We have seen murders, rob-
beries, assaults, and then the potential 
for foreign malignant forces to get into 
the cannabis industry here in the 
United States. 
I urge the passage of amendment No. 
1 and yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question

amendment offered by the gentleman

The question is on the amendment

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that amendments 2,

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MS. DEAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
In title LI of division E, after section 5105, 
insert the following: 
SEC. 5106. PROTECTIONS FOR OBLIGORS AND CO-
SIGNERS IN CASE OF DEATH OR 
TOTAL 
AND 
PERMANENT 
DIS-
ABILITY. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 140(g) of the 
Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(g)) is 
amended— 
(1) in paragraph (2)— 
(A) in the heading, by striking ‘‘IN CASE OF 
DEATH OF BORROWER’’; 
(B) in subparagraph (A), by inserting after 
‘‘of the death’’, the following: ‘‘or total and 
permanent disability’’; and 
(C) in subparagraph (C), by inserting after 
‘‘of the death’’, the following: ‘‘or total and 
permanent disability’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(3) DISCHARGE IN CASE OF DEATH OR TOTAL 
AND
PERMANENT
DISABILITY
OF
BORROWER.— 
The holder of a private education loan shall, 
when notified of the death or total and per-
manent disability of a student obligor, dis-
charge the liability of the student obligor on 
the loan and may not, after such notifica-
tion— 
‘‘(A) attempt to collect on the outstanding 
liability of the student obligor; and 
‘‘(B) in the case of total and permanent 
disability, monitor the disability status of 
the student obligor at any point after the 
date of discharge. 
‘‘(4) TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY DE-
FINED.—For the purposes of this subsection 
and with respect to an individual, the term 
‘total and permanent disability’ means the 
individual is totally and permanently dis-
abled, as such term is defined in section 
685.102(b) of title 34 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations. 
‘‘(5) PRIVATE DISCHARGE IN CASES OF CER-
TAIN DISCHARGE FOR DEATH OR DISABILITY.— 
The holder of a private education loan shall, 
when notified of the discharge of liability of 
a student obligor on a loan described under 
section 108(f)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, discharge any liability of the 
student obligor (and any cosigner) on any 
private education loan which the private 
education loan holder holds and may not, 
after such notification— 
‘‘(A) attempt to collect on the outstanding 
liability of the student obligor; and 
‘‘(B) in the case of total and permanent 
disability, monitor the disability status of 
the student obligor at any point after the 
date of discharge.’’. 
(b) RULEMAKING.—The Director of the Bu-
reau of Consumer Financial Protection may 
issue rules to implement the amendments 
made by subsection (a) as the Director deter-
mines appropriate. 
(c) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall take effect 1 year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
DEAN) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment, 
which would require private student 
lenders to discharge private student 
loan debt for people who become to-
tally or permanently disabled. 
This amendment was inspired by a 
constituent who came to our office in 
need. Like many young Americans, my 
constituent pursued an education and 
chose to use private loans to help fund 
her college costs. She was also fully 
prepared to repay her loans, but trag-
ically she became permanently and to-
tally disabled. 
Because of her permanent disability, 
her mother must now take care of her 
for life, and not only is the mother her 
caretaker, she is also the cosigner obli-
gated to carry and pay for this debili-
tating debt. 
b 2215 
Though the student’s particular lend-
er allowed her debt to be discharged, 
her mother, who cosigned the loan, was 
not dismissed from that responsibility. 
Though this reality may be foreign to 
many of us, for those it does affect, it 
will change their lives forever. 
That is why this amendment would 
right a wrong and bring parity between 
protections for private student loan 
borrowers and Federal student loan 
borrowers. 
Currently, private student lenders 
are not required to discharge the obli-
gation of a borrower who becomes per-
manently disabled, only in the case of 
death. However, for Federal student 
loans in the case of permanent dis-
ability or death, loans are discharged. 
In addition, Federal student loans do 
not require cosigners. 
Specifically, my amendment amends 
the Truth in Lending Act to require 
discharge of private student loans in 
the case of permanent or total dis-
ability of the borrower; require the dis-
charge of cosigners in the case of the 
borrower’s permanent or total dis-
ability; require private lenders to dis-
charge a borrower’s obligation when 
they are notified that the Federal Gov-
ernment has discharged the Federal 
student loans of the borrower. 
As we debate the National Defense 
Authorization Act, it is important to 
highlight that our servicemembers are 
disproportionately using private stu-
dent loans. And these veterans who use 
private student loans disproportion-
ately use them to attend for-profit uni-
versities or institutions. In some in-
stances, veterans leave with nearly 
double the amount of debt compared to

their counterparts who use Federal 
veterans’ education benefits. 
Our veterans, our servicemembers, 
along with all of our constituents, de-
serve to be protected in the case of un-
expected hardship. 
I am pleased that in August, the 
Biden 
administration 
announced 
it 
would automatically cancel Federal 
student loan debt through the Total 
and Permanent Disability Discharge 
program. The TPD Discharge program 
provides loan discharge for the bor-
rower and the cosigner should the bor-
rower become totally and permanently 
disabled. 
This is a first step in providing 
323,000 Federal student loan borrowers 
with disabilities the relief they are en-
titled to under the law. 
It is our responsibility to codify and 
extend this same needed support to our 
private student loan borrowers and 
their families affected with these trag-
edies. 
I pray no one go through what my 
constituents have gone through. 
We must move this commonsense and 
important amendment forward, and I 
urge all members to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). The gentleman from Ohio 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment requires the discharge 
of private education loans in the event 
the borrower dies or becomes perma-
nently and totally disabled. Repub-
licans are very sympathetic to both 
situations. 
Private education lenders already 
provide relief to the estates of deceased 
student borrowers and the student loan 
borrowers who become permanently 
and totally disabled, if requested. 
Furthermore, in a competitive mar-
ket, student loan seekers are free to 
choose between lenders who observe 
similar practices and those who do not. 
Congress should not attempt to legis-
late the terms of agreement to which 
the parties have already agreed. 
This amendment imposes a new con-
dition on private education lenders in 
contracts that haven’t been negotiated 
or discussed between the lender and 
borrower. 
If this amendment becomes law, this 
clause would be automatic, increasing 
compliance costs for lenders, dimin-
ishing the market value of existing 
loans, and having the downstream ef-
fect of making credit more expensive 
for consumers. 
Therefore, I believe this amendment 
is a solution in search of a problem. It 
would insert Congress into a process 
that is already being utilized by lend-
ers. 
And while I understand the gentle-
woman’s concerns that led to drafting 
this amendment, I cannot support it in 
its current form. In fact, I would per-
sonally be happy to work with the gen-
tlewoman to solve the problem in a dif-
ferent way. 
I do oppose this amendment in its 
current form, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for wanting to work 
with me on this. Certainly this is a se-
rious problem, and it is a serious prob-
lem for my constituent, and I am sure 
constituents in any other district in 
our country. 
But there is a misstatement in the 
gentleman’s words. It is voluntary 
right now on the part of the private 
lenders, and this bill would codify the 
requirement to ensure that disability 
discharge for private student loans is 
not a choice. 
Certainly, when you sign up for a 
loan, you don’t think about planning 
for becoming totally disabled and un-
able to afford your own student loans. 
Unfortunately, as my constituent 
case shows, some private lenders do not 
voluntarily discharge for the borrower 
and the cosponsor in the case of perma-
nent and total disability. I believe we 
have a duty to stand up for the most 
vulnerable among us. This bill would 
help accomplish that goal. 
I commend the lenders who do step 
up voluntarily, but we need to codify 
this discharge of liability in the case of 
total or permanent disability. 
I urge support, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Ohio for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania. 
This amendment would require pri-
vate lenders automatically to dis-
charge loans for borrowers who die or 
become totally and permanently dis-
abled. 
As you can clearly see, this amend-
ment, like so many others we are de-
bating, has no relation to our Nation’s 
defense. 
In addition to being irrelevant to the 
bill we are considering, the language is 
also completely unnecessary. 
Private lenders, as my colleague has 
already said, already discharge loans 
for borrowers and their families who 
find themselves in these horrible cir-
cumstances. 
They do this not because they are re-
quired by the government to do so, but 
because it is the right thing to do. 
All this amendment would do is 
waste valuable time to create a govern-
ment mandate for a feature already 
commonplace in the industry. 
This amendment is yet another ex-
ample of Democrats finding ways for 
the Federal Government to take over 
every aspect of our lives and destroy as 
much as possible of the private sector. 
I urge my colleagues to object to the 
inclusion of this unneeded policy. 
Ms. 
DEAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
of 
course there is a clear nexus to our vet-
erans and our servicemembers, and it 
would be marvelous if all private stu-
dent loan lenders would voluntarily 
discharge in the case of permanent or 
total disability. It just simply isn’t the 
case. 
We are trying to ensure parity, re-
gardless of who the borrower owes. We 
don’t believe this would be a difficulty 
for all of these lenders who you say are 
willing to do this. 
If the lenders honestly want to fight 
this so that they can take every last 
dollar of the individuals and their fam-
ilies despite their suffering, they can 
go to court, and they can ask the court 
for a remedy. 
I urge support, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
would just reiterate that private stu-
dent lenders already work with bor-
rowers for these unplanned situations 
clearly in death and in disabilities 
alike. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

after consultation with the Secretary of the 
Interior, the Secretary of State, and the 
Governor of Guam and the Governor of the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, or the Governor of the Virgin Islands 
of the United States, as the case may be, de-
termines that— 
‘‘(A) an adequate arrival and departure 
control system has been developed in Guam 
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the 
United States; and 
‘‘(B) such a waiver does not represent a 
threat to the welfare, safety, or security of 
the United States or its territories and com-
monwealths. 
‘‘(2) ALIEN
WAIVER
OF
RIGHTS.—An alien 
may not be provided a waiver under this sub-
section unless the alien has waived any 
right— 
‘‘(A) to review or appeal under this Act an 
immigration officer’s determination as to 
the admissibility of the alien at the port of 
entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin 
Islands of the United States; or 
‘‘(B) to contest, other than on the basis of 
an application for withholding of removal 
under section 241(b)(3) of this Act or under 
the Convention Against Torture, or an appli-
cation for asylum if permitted under section 
208 of this Act, any action for removal of the 
alien. 
‘‘(3) REGULATIONS.—All necessary regula-
tions to implement this subsection shall be 
promulgated by the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, in consultation with the Secretary 
of the Interior and the Secretary of State. 
The promulgation of such regulations shall 
be considered a foreign affairs function for 
purposes of section 553(a) of title 5, United 
States Code. At a minimum, such regula-
tions should include, but not necessarily be 
limited to— 
‘‘(A) a listing of all countries whose na-
tionals may obtain the waivers provided by 
this subsection; and 
‘‘(B) any bonding requirements for nation-
als of some or all of those countries who may 
present an increased risk of overstays or 
other potential problems, if different from 
such requirements otherwise provided by law 
for nonimmigrant visitors. 
‘‘(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to 
grant or continue providing the waiver under 
this paragraph to nationals of any country, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of the Interior 
and the Secretary of State, shall consider all 
factors that the Secretary deems relevant, 
including electronic travel authorizations, 
procedures for reporting lost and stolen pass-
ports, repatriation of aliens, rates of refusal 
for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, 
exit systems, and information exchange. 
‘‘(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Home-
land Security shall monitor the admission of 
nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, and the Virgin Islands of the United 
States, under this subsection. If the Sec-
retary determines that such admissions have 
resulted in an unacceptable number of visi-
tors from a country remaining unlawfully in 
Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the 
United States, unlawfully obtaining entry to 
other parts of the United States, or seeking 
withholding of removal or asylum, or that 
visitors from a country pose a risk to law en-
forcement or security interests of Guam or 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United 
States, or of the United States (including the 
interest in the enforcement of the immigra-
tion laws of the United States), the Sec-
retary shall suspend the admission of nation-
als of such country under this subsection. 
The Secretary of Homeland Security may in 
the Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam 
and Northern Mariana Islands visa waiver 
program, or the Virgin Islands visa waiver 
program, at any time, on a country-by-coun-
try basis, for other good cause. 
‘‘(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor 
of Guam and the Governor of the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or 
the Governor of the Virgin Islands of the 
United States, may request the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security to add a particular country to the 
list of countries whose nationals may obtain 
the waiver provided by this subsection, and 
the Secretary of Homeland Security may 
grant such request after consultation with 
the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-
retary of State, and may promulgate regula-
tions with respect to the inclusion of that 
country and any special requirements the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Sec-
retary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to 
allowing nationals of that country to obtain 
the waiver provided by this subsection.’’.

REGULATIONS
DEADLINE.—Not 
later 
than one year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Secretary of State, shall 
promulgate any necessary regulations as de-
scribed in subsection (a) required to imple-
ment the waiver provided in such subsection 
for the Virgin Islands. 
(c) WAIVER
COUNTRIES.—The regulations 
described in subsection (b) shall include a 
listing of all member or associate member 
countries 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
Community 
(CARICOM) whose nationals may obtain, on 
a country-by-country basis, the waiver pro-
vided by this section, except that such regu-
lations shall not provide for a listing of any 
country if the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity determines that such country’s inclu-
sion on such list would represent a threat to 
the welfare, safety, or security of the United 
States or its territories and commonwealths. 
(d) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.— 
(1) DOCUMENTATION
REQUIREMENTS.—Sec-
tion 212(a)(7)(B)(iii) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(7)(B)(iii)) is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(iii) SPECIAL VISA WAIVER PROGRAMS.—For 
a provision authorizing waiver of clause (i) 
in the case of visitors to Guam or the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 
or the Virgin Islands of the United States, 
see subsection (l).’’. 
(2) ADMISSION OF NONIMMIGRANTS.—Section 
214(a)(1) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(a)(1)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands’’ 
each place such term appears and inserting 
‘‘Guam or the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of 
the United States’’. 
(e) FEES.—The Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity shall establish an administrative 
processing fee to be charged and collected 
from individuals seeking to enter the Virgin 
Islands in accordance with section 212(l) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1182(l)), as amended by this Act. Such 
fee shall be set at a level that will ensure re-
covery of the full costs of such processing, 
any additional costs associated with the ad-
ministration of the fees collected, and any 
sums necessary to offset reduced collections 
of the nonimmigrant visa fee or the elec-
tronic travel authorization fee that other-
wise would have been collected from such in-
dividuals. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman from Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this amendment, and 
I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I first want to give 
a little bit of a history lesson and some 
information to my colleagues here. 
The Virgin Islands and the terri-
tories, many of whom are outside of 
the customs zone, when one comes to 
the U.S. Virgin Islands in order to get 
to the mainland, you must go through 
Customs and Border Protection pre-
senting passport, et cetera, as you 
would in a foreign country. 
My amendment responds to the need 
for an expedited nonimmigrant visitor 
visa program in the U.S. Virgin Islands 
that is now currently available to 
other U.S. territories outside of the 
U.S. customs zone in the Pacific, which 
would aid the Virgin Islands in allow-
ing more visitors. Specifically, the Vir-
gin Islands is seeking authority to ex-
tend the special nonimmigrant visitor 
visa waiver program that is currently 
available in Guam and Northern Mari-
anas. 
Adding the Virgin Islands to this ex-
isting nonimmigrant visitor visa waiv-
er program would allow the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to consider 
approving visa-less entry into the Vir-
gin Islands up to and limited to 45 days 
primarily for residents of neighboring 
Caribbean countries. This would better 
enable the Virgin Islands to compete 
economically with other islands and 
nations in the Caribbean. 
It would apply solely to the Virgin 
Islands, and because we are outside of 
the customs zone by law, like other 
U.S. territories, it would not allow 
visa-less entry into any other part of 
the United States. 
It would allow individuals from other 
Caribbean islands to come into the Vir-
gin Islands on an expedited visa proc-
ess, which would lead to increased 
tourism, greater opportunities to host 
international events, and support our 
small business and medical facilities. 
For example, the Virgin Islands an-
nually hosts numerous yacht shows 
and regattas, which could yield addi-
tional economic support, except for the 
fact that we have a longer entry for 
our neighbors to come into the terri-
tories. 
Similarly, our young people cannot 
compete with our neighboring islands 
which are much closer to us than the 
United States. The U.S. Virgin Islands 
is over 1,000 miles to Florida, as op-
posed to the Bahamas, which is only 
180 miles to Miami. Cuba is only 300 
miles to Miami. We are way down the 
Antilles chain. 
This amendment would remain rea-
sonably limited in scope to the Carib-
bean community and other countries 
approved by the Department of Home-
land Security. 
The provision also allows the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to sus-
pend waivers to any individual or coun-
tries if they pose a risk to law enforce-
ment or security interests of the

United States or at the secretary’s own 
discretion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
extending 
visa 
waiver privileges in the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands for Caribbean countries will 
present yet another challenge for im-
migration enforcement and drug inter-
diction efforts. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has historically noted that a spe-
cial visa waiver program for the U.S. 
Virgin Islands would result in a signifi-
cant increase in overstays and make it 
easier for previously removed aliens to 
re-enter U.S. territory. This amend-
ment would also hamper our efforts to 
stop the import of illegal drugs. 
According to the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, cocaine is the prin-
cipal drug threat in the Caribbean with 
the U.S. Virgin Islands already serving 
as a major transshipment point be-
tween cocaine-producing countries in 
South America and the continental 
United States. 
b 2230 
A special visa waiver program for the 
U.S. Virgin Islands would also open the 
door to birth tourism, something we 
have already seen in the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, a U.S. territory in the Pacific. 
In 2017, The Wall Street Journal 
noted that ‘‘Saipan has become known 
as the latest hot spot for birth tourism, 
a place where women can give birth to 
babies who will automatically acquire 
U.S. citizenship.’’ The problem has be-
come so widespread that, in recent 
years, more children have been born to 
Chinese tourists on the islands than 
Americans. 
Chinese syndicates have also taken 
advantage of the CNMI program to en-
gage in human trafficking and forced 
labor. By any measure, the CNMI Visa 
Waiver Program has been an unmiti-
gated disaster. We should be getting rid 
of these programs, not expanding them. 
Madam Speaker, America’s immigra-
tion laws and visa restrictions should 
apply uniformly across the country. We 
should not be creating special loop-
holes or allowing States and territories 
to operate their own independent im-
migration systems. At a time when the 
United States is seeing record illegal 
immigration and record asylum claims, 
creating this visa program is a bad idea 
at the worst possible time. 
I have to say, I am stunned that the 
majority would bring this forth at this 
time when we have a deluge that is 
happening at the southern border. Now 
to create another loophole just like in 
the Pacific, only this time in the At-
lantic, it is not appropriate to be doing 
this at this time. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I find it very inter-
esting the concern that my colleague 
has for the U.S. Virgin Islands when we 
don’t get the economic support from 
that side of the aisle that would allow 
us to mitigate the need for opening our 
shores up to our Caribbean neighbors. 
As you can find out, we have received 
technical assistance from the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Office of 
the Chief Counsel, as well as the Office 
of Field Operations, in the process of 
developing this visa program. As I am 
sure my colleague is aware, under the 
auspices of this program, it does au-
thorize the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity to exclude or remove a country 
from the visa waiver program list if the 
Secretary determines inclusion would 
represent a threat to the welfare, safe-
ty, or security of the United States or 
its territories and its commonwealth. 
I find the use of birthright tourism in 
Saipan, if you would look at the data, 
is only a very small percentage of the 
overall visitors and that the related 
costs are outweighed by the extreme 
tourist and economic benefits to the 
Pacific. 
I also find it interesting that he is 
concerned about what is happening on 
the border at this time, considering 
that most of the individuals who are 
coming through that border are much 
closer, coming from countries, includ-
ing that of Haiti, which are much clos-
er to Florida than they are to the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
The thought that individuals would 
take the time and the resources to 
come to an island nation where they 
would have to go through Customs and 
Border Protection to move into the 
mainland is in itself a discussion that 
negates what he is concerned with. 
Additionally, as for drugs, yes, the 
Virgin Islands does have a problem 
with drug transportation, which is 
going through the U.S. Postal Service. 
I don’t think any of these visitors 
would be the individuals being put into 
the mail and going through the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for adoption of 
this amendment. It is germane, and it 
is related and worked through from 
Homeland Security. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
would just respond this way: America 
offers great support to all of our 
friends in the Caribbean. It is not accu-
rate that we don’t offer support. We do. 
The second point is that the Sec-
retary of—I am assuming she was refer-
ring to Homeland Security—could ex-
clude or change the program. How like-
ly is that when we see what is hap-
pening currently? When we were told 
by this government a month ago that 
people coming from Afghanistan would 
have an SIV, we have found very few of 
them have that. They have just been 
waived in on parole. 
That is part of the reason why Con-
gress needs to maintain its authority, 
because we cannot count on the execu-
tive branch enforcing the laws of this 
country. All we have to do is look at 
the news of the day to understand that 
we have open borders, and it is because 
the executive branch refuses to control 
our borders. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question

‘‘534. Merchant Mariner Equity Compensa-
tion Fund.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. Tonight, I rise to ex-
press my gratitude to many persons 
who have caused us to have this oppor-
tunity. I thank Chairman SMITH for his 
service and what he has done and 
Ranking Member ROGERS, the members 
of the Committee on Rules, and the 
members of the Committee on Vet-
erans Affairs. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to say that I 
do support the NDAA. I understand the 
need for a strong military, but I also 
rise tonight with an appeal for some 
compassion, compassion and, to a cer-
tain extent, mercy for our veteran mer-
chant marines. I ask for this compas-
sion because they didn’t get some of 
the benefits that others did. 
Let me just read the words, if I may, 
of President Roosevelt. On June 22, 
1944, these are his words when signing 
the GI Bill: ‘‘I trust Congress will soon 
provide similar opportunities to mem-
bers of the Merchant Marine who have 
risked their lives time and time again 
during war for the welfare of our coun-
try.’’ 
Congress did not provide similar ben-
efits for the merchant marines. As a re-
sult of Congress not doing so, most 
people don’t know that the merchant 
marines were denied benefits within 
the GI Bill, denied the stipend for the 
cost of living, books, and supplies as it 
relates to education, denied tuition- 
free education, denied unemployment 
benefits, denied medical benefits, de-
nied low-cost guaranteed loans, denied 
opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I appeal tonight for 
those who are still surviving, all of 
whom are in their nineties. I had the 
privilege of being with Mr. Charles 
Mills, 101 years young and still making 
the appeal for help for these veterans, 
who literally won a lawsuit to have 
themselves declared as such. 
I make the appeal for compassion for 
our merchant marines, who had a very 
high casualty count during World War 
II. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, the 
NDAA is one of the most important 
bills Congress passes annually. In fact, 
the past decade, the NDAA has been 
enacted every year. As such, the NDAA 
often becomes a grab bag for a variety 
of priorities. To protect the integrity 
of this process, I believe the NDAA 
should focus on strengthening the De-
partment of Defense—its systems, its 
programs, 
and 
its 
personnel. 
This 
amendment would provide an unprece-
dented $25,000 one-time payment from 
the VA to World War II merchant ma-
rines. Therefore, we should not be dis-
cussing this proposal as part of the 
NDAA. 
I thank Representative GREEN for his 
advocacy on behalf of the merchant 
marines, and I support the merchant 
marines. I am also grateful for the 
bravery of these men who served dur-
ing World War II. They faced danger, 
and some made the ultimate sacrifice 
in service to our country. 
That said, their service has been rec-
ognized. The GI Bill Improvement Act 
of 1977 provided a pathway to VA care 
benefits for civilian groups, known as 
active duty designees, who supported 
the Armed Forces in World War II. The 
merchant marines are considered ac-
tive duty designees and, as such, re-
ceived veteran status and eligibility 
for VA benefits decades ago. 
However, this amendment carves out 
a new benefit for merchant marines un-
like anything Congress has authorized 
in the past, not even for our most high-
ly decorated veterans. 
I have heard that merchant marines 
feel they were shortchanged because 
they did not receive the GI Bill bene-
fits. However, this bill creates an in-
equity among other veterans and ac-
tive duty designees by providing a 
thank-you payment for merchant ma-
rines. 
Ultimately, this amendment unfairly 
singles out one group of service above 
another. I also have questions about 
how many merchant marines would be 
covered under this amendment and 
why $25,000 was deemed as the appro-
priate amount. 
Considering this bill under regular 
order before the House Committee of 
Veterans’ Affairs would allow us to ask 
those questions. It makes more sense 
to have it done that way. This is why 
I cannot support this amendment’s in-
clusion in the NDAA tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, may I inquire how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Illinois 
has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, tuition benefits in today’s dollars 
would be about $8,000. The stipend for 
the cost of living, books, and supplies 
would be about $1,200. The unemploy-
ment benefits—and I am low-balling— 
would be about $16,000. 
The medical benefits we can’t meas-
ure. The loss of opportunities because 
of the loans that they could have re-
ceived we cannot measure. 
But we can do this: We can do what 
General Eisenhower asked us to do. We 
can do what President Roosevelt asked 
us to do and President Truman asked 
us to do. 
This is our opportunity, a unique mo-
ment in time to correct an injustice. 
And I appeal to you to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, as I men-
tioned, this amendment would provide 
an unprecedented $25,000 one-time pay-
ment for VA World War II merchant 
marines. It did not go through regular 
order. It did not go through the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. This amendment

should be placed in the committee that 
has jurisdiction to justify so that if not 
only this group but other groups would 
be able and should be able to receive 
benefits, as this amendment requires, 
we would be able to do that. 
Madam Speaker, I support our mer-
chant marines. I always have. My 20 
years in the State legislature, I did 
just that. As a matter of fact, at every 
veteran ceremony, I mentioned and 
brought up our merchant marines as 
our veterans. 
That being said, this is not the way 
to handle this bill. I plead with the 
Members of this body not to accept 
this. I am adamantly opposed. I would 
love to take it up in the committee, 
not in this bill where it is not the prop-
er place. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 2245 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, how much time do I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 1 minute re-
maining. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, to take this through regular order 
at this time would mean that we would 
call on witnesses who have long since 
gone to glory. It would mean that 
many of those who live today would 
not live to see the day that the justice 
would be served that they richly de-
serve. 
So I make an appeal on behalf of the 
those who have earned this compas-
sion, they risked their lives for their 
country, and many of them died. This 
is our final opportunity for many of 
them, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment, which makes clear 
that the statutory rights of service-
members and their families under the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or 
SCRA, 
cannot 
be 
waived 
through 
forced arbitration unless it is agreed to 
by the servicemember after a dispute 
arises. 
Americans who serve in our military, 
our veterans and their families sac-
rifice much in service to our country. 
Often they have fought to protect the 
fundamental idea that we are a Nation 
of laws and institutions that guarantee 
the rights and prosperity of every 
American. 
Since the Second World War, Con-
gress has created many laws, including 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 
to expand and strengthen the rights 
and protections of servicemembers and 
veterans. These laws are essential pro-
tections that guarantee every veteran 
and active duty servicemembers, in-
cluding the Reserves and National 
Guard the right to be free from work-
place discrimination on the basis of 
their military service, and the right to 
their day in court to enforce these pro-
visions. We are a stronger and better 
Nation because of these rights. 
SCRA prevents landlords from enact-
ing 
eviction 
proceedings, 
mortgage 
holders from foreclosing on a home, 
and lenders from repossessing a vehicle 
while a member of our armed services 
is on active duty. However, forced arbi-
tration clauses embedded in mortgages 
and titles prevent accountability for 
bad actors taking advantage of our 
servicemembers while they are pro-
tecting our country. 
For too long, forced arbitration has 
eroded these fundamental protections 
by funneling servicemembers’ claims 
into a private system set up by cor-
porations. Buried deep within the fine 
print of everyday contracts, forced ar-
bitration clauses block the brave men 
and women in uniform, as well as their 
family members, from having their day 
in court to hold corporations account-
able for breaking the law. 
Charles Beard’s story is an example 
of how forced arbitration impacts our 
servicemembers. 
While 
Charles, 
a 
former sergeant in the Army National 
Guard, was on tour in Iraq, the bank 
repossessed his family car in clear vio-
lation of SCRA. It was the only vehicle 
his wife and five children could rely on. 
When they attempted to hold the 
bank accountable for violating his 
rights, they forced his claim into arbi-
tration citing a clause in Charles’ con-
tract that he was required to sign to 
purchase the car, which waived his con-
stitutional right to a jury trial. 
This private system does not to have 
the same procedural safeguards of our 
justice system. It is not subject to 
oversight, it does not have a judge or 
jury, and it is not bound by laws passed 
by Congress or the States. These 
clauses allow companies to choose the 
arbiter and venue while denying serv-
icemembers any right to appeal. 
This is nothing short of corporate 
takeover or our Nation’s system of 
laws, and the American people have 
had enough. The overwhelming major-
ity of voters, including 83 percent of 
Democrats and 87 percent of Repub-
licans support ending forced arbitra-
tion. It is time to act. 
My bipartisan amendment would end 
this shameful practice by clarifying 
that arbitration clauses are only en-
forceable if agreed to by servicemem-
bers or their family after a dispute 
arises, thereby protecting their rights 
under the Servicemembers Civil Relief 
Act. 
As a Nation devoted to protecting 
our brave men and women in uniform, 
we have to ensure that their rights are 
actually enforceable in court. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleagues, 
GUY
RESCHENTHALER, 
JARED GOLDEN, ANTHONY BROWN, and 
Veterans 
Affairs 
Chairman 
MARK 
TAKANO
for their strong, bipartisan 
support for this amendment to protect 
our men and women in uniform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4816 
September 21, 2021 
This provision was incorporated in 
both the 2020 and 2021 NDAA. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, 
to support this amendment and protect 
American servicemembers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY) 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, arbitration clauses 
in contracts let private parties agree in 
advance on a way to resolve further 
disputes and have significant benefits. 
But for years, Democrats have worked 
relentlessly to undermine arbitration 
and the efficiencies arbitration agree-
ments often have for private parties. 
These agreements generally work 
well and the process itself is a fair and 
effective way to solve disagreements. 
Arbitration is also usually faster and 
cheaper than hiring an attorney and 
suiting up for drawn-out litigation. 
Making arbitration harder for cer-
tain claims will mean Americans spend 
more time in court with no guarantee 
of getting better outcomes. The Demo-
crat-driven campaign to up-end the use 
of arbitration will certainly benefit the 
plaintiff’s bar. But it will make life 
worse for the American people. 
With that context in mind, we can 
consider this amendment in light of 
the larger policy debate it is connected 
to. This amendment rests on the idea 
that 
pre-dispute 
arbitration 
agree-
ments are fundamentally problematic 
and unfair or work poorly. But that is 
not true. 
And this amendment cannot be con-
sidered in isolation. Instead, it is a pol-
icy gateway to the Democrats’ long-
standing priority to eliminate arbitra-
tion agreements entirely. This amend-
ment should be rejected. Separately, it 
is true that we can have a debate over 
the merits of arbitration agreements 
now in the context of the NDAA, but 
we should not be having that debate 
here and now. 
If the policy in this amendment is 
sound, Congress should consider that 
policy as an independent bill, in the 
light of day, and after appropriate con-
gressional oversight. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
oppose 
this 
amendment because it is bad policy 
and because of this flawed process, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO), the distin-
guished chairman of the Veterans Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment, 
which 
would prohibit the enforcement of 
forced arbitration clauses and con-
tracts covered by the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act, or SCRA. 
Forced arbitration has undermined 
the rights of servicemembers for years 
by forcing them to waive their ability 
to seek remedies through the courts. 
This prohibition on forced arbitration 
clauses would protect countless men 
and women wearing the uniform of our 
Nation from predatory lenders while 
being deployed. 
SCRA extends important financial 
protections to military service per-
sonnel who are currently serving on ac-
tive duty, and are often targeted for 
exploitation. These protections can 
range from prohibiting lenders from re-
possessing cars and foreclosing on 
homes while servicemembers are ac-
tively deployed. I will repeat, while 
they 
are 
actively 
deployed. 
This 
amendment will expand these protec-
tions to remove a common tool used in 
this exploitation. 
Those who serve in our military are 
inherently at a disadvantage against 
aggressive lenders as the nature of 
their service makes it difficult to seek 
fair resolve in any claims. While lend-
ers are aware of this unique cir-
cumstance, many seek to take full ad-
vantage of these servicemembers. And 
this is a shame. 
Our servicemembers protect us both 
at home and abroad, and it is time we 
safeguard their rights against preda-
tory lenders and others who shame-
lessly seek to exploit members of our 
military. 
So I am thankful to my colleagues 
for their leadership on this issue, Mr. 
CICILLINE, 
Mr. 
GOLDEN, 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER, and Mr. BROWN, and I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to vote in favor of this amend-
ment, and I hope it stays in after con-
ference. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, as I 
stated earlier, this is a policy gateway 
that the Democrats seek to eliminate 
arbitration. It has been a longstanding 
goal of my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle to achieve that goal, and 
this opens up the door to it. 
And I think about the debates that 
we have in the Judiciary Committee, 
where courts are being clogged up, 
talking about needing more judges, 
changing the circuits, things like that. 
This will add to the clogging of our 
courts, and that is why we should op-
pose this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Rhode Island has 15 sec-
onds remaining. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
when my friend said that the arbitra-
tion generally works, he is right, it 
generally works for big, powerful cor-
porations, employers, financial institu-
tions, but it doesn’t work for service-
men and women who are serving our 
country in the military. 
It makes it harder, it is more dif-
ficult, it is more costly. And, by the 
way, if you want to go to arbitration, 
you can elect to do it, you just can’t be 
forced into it if this amendment passes. 
We hear our friends all the time say to 
stand up for the men and women in 
uniform, show it by voting for this 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
The question is on the amendment

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of amendment No. 11 which 
would provide critical needed consumer 
protection to our servicemembers who 
hold medical debt. 
No one chooses to get sick, yet med-
ical debt is the leading cause of per-
sonal bankruptcy in our country, and 
the pandemic has only made paid our 
medical debt crisis worse, especially 
for our veterans. 
According to the Consumer Financial 
Protection 
Bureau, 
servicemembers 
and veterans are nearly twice as likely 
to submit debt collection complaints 
as the general public. And medical debt 
concerns comprise nearly 13 percent of 
servicemember debt collection com-
plaints. 
So this amendment is important be-
cause medical bills and reimburse-
ments are often vague and confusing. 
Servicemembers often assert that the 
calculation of the underlying debt is 
inaccurate and unfair. Other times, 
bills go missing during deployment or 
are delivered to the wrong recipient. 
So this amendment would strengthen 
servicemembers’ consumer protections 
regarding medical debt by preventing 
the collection of medical debt for 2 
years from the date of medical billing, 
and prohibiting credit agencies from 
reporting all medical debt collections 
for a year. 
b 2300 
My amendment also requires medical 
debt collectors to provide servicemem-
bers with their consumer rights upon 
contact. 
Together, these protections would 
provide servicemembers much-needed 
clarity to figure out what they actu-
ally owe and what the impact will have 
on their credit. 
So, Madam Speaker, debt collection 
particularly affects our young service-
members and veterans who have little 
credit history upon enlisting. 
Among servicemembers with 3 or 
fewer years of service, the CFPB has 
found 5 percent had medical debts in 
collection just prior to separation from 
service, and that number doubles to 
more than 10 percent within a year of 
their separation from service. As a re-
sult, those same individuals with 3 
years or less of service, on average, 
exit the armed services with subprime 
credit scores. 
So with that I really finally ask my 
colleagues to please help us ban med-
ical debt also for medically necessary 
procedures from ever even appearing on 
servicemembers’ credit reports. 
This amendment would not prevent 
States from implementing stronger 
protections for our servicemembers. It 
would not preempt existing consumer 
protections for our servicemembers al-
ready on the books. 
Again, I remind my colleagues that, 
again, this is really critical for our 
servicemembers. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition, and I am 
opposed to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment delays the collection 
of servicemembers’ medical debt for 2 
years. It outright bans the reporting of 
a servicemembers’ medically necessary 
procedures to a credit reporting agency 
ever, and it restricts the reporting of a 
servicemember’s debt obligations to a 
credit reporting agency for 1 year. 
Republicans have supported remov-
ing paid medical debt from a con-
sumer’s credit report that was unpre-
dictable and unavoidable. However, 
this amendment would remove all in-
formation related to medically nec-
essary procedures for servicemembers. 
Frankly, it exploits servicemembers to 
advance a cause my colleague has pre-
viously advocated for which is to elimi-
nate medical reporting altogether to 
credit reporting agencies. 
Debt, including medically necessary 
debt, is important criteria to assess a 
borrower’s creditworthiness and ability 
to repay and should appear on credit 
reports of consumers, including serv-
icemembers. It can improve their cred-
it scores if they pay their debts. Re-

September 21, 2021 
credit report has the potential to in-
crease the cost of credit, particularly 
for those borrowers who have limited 
credit history. 
Requiring the expedited removal of 
debt from such reports will undermine 
the safety and soundness of financial 
institutions and the financial system 
more broadly. It will further damage 
healthcare. Additionally, recouping a 
loss is a basic tenet of a credit-based 
economy. 
This amendment would be disastrous 
on an already broken healthcare sys-
tem. It would increase the cost of med-
ical care and limit access to the care 
for all. 
For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
oppose this amendment, I encourage 
my colleagues to oppose it as well, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. How much time is re-
maining, Madam Speaker? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan has 21⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I re-
mind my colleagues that all of these 
protections have already passed the 
House this Congress but have yet to re-
ceive action in the Senate. 
I want to remind my colleagues also 
the way the amendment is drafted 
right now currently, a medically nec-
essary procedure is defined as, one, 
healthcare services or supplies needed 
to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, 
condition, disease, or symptom that 
meet accepted standards of medicine; 
two, healthcare to prevent illness and 
detect illnesses at an early stage when 
treatment is likely to work best, again, 
for services like Pap tests, flu shots, 
and screening mammograms 
I want to remind my colleagues, this 
is a huge barrier. The credit reports are 
huge barriers for housing and employ-
ment for our veterans. We continue to 
support increased housing for our vet-
erans, increased mental health services 
for our veterans and all these other 
issues but, much of that is due to the 
fact that we have credit reports with 
medically necessary debt, medical pro-
cedures on there, and really no path-
way to protect our consumers, our vet-
erans, in this case. 
I really remind my colleagues again: 
we cannot continue to support housing 
and employment services for our vet-
erans, and the credit report, the credit 
score, all of that, is holding them hos-
tage unable to continue to create a 
good life in our country especially 
after sacrificing so much for our Na-
tion. 
So I really ask my colleagues this is 
the right thing to do. Again, this is ba-
sically folks who are getting sick that 
need healthcare, and we are not saying 
that they won’t be able to collect, the 
healthcare agencies, they are able to 
collect. This is just to prevent it from 
becoming a barrier for many of our vet-
erans who seek employment which does 
look at—many employers still now cur-
rently look at credit reports, and they 
also look at credit reports for housing. 
Again, we can’t continue to try to fund 
these kinds of supports when this is a 
huge barrier for our veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I would just reiterate that re-
couping a loss is a basic tenet of our 
credit-based economy. This amend-
ment would further limit credit op-
tions for all Americans, hurting those 
who buy care from any place who can’t 
collect debts, and it would therefore 
hurt those who need this the most. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment which would take a 
number of steps to address PFAS con-
tamination—a significant issue in my 
home State of Michigan and across the 
country. These include: Requiring a na-
tional primary drinking water regula-
tion for PFAS. 
Strengthening 
disclosure 
require-
ments for manufacturers who discharge 
PFAS into our environment. 
And mandating the DOD comply with 
safe incineration standards for PFAS. 
My amendment would also ensure 
that the Department of Defense med-
ical providers have the training they 
need to treat the effects of PFAS expo-
sure. 
This provision could literally not be 
more straightforward. ‘‘The Secretary 
of Defense shall provide to each med-
ical provider of the Department of De-
fense mandatory training with respect 
to the potential health effects of 
PFAS.’’ 
These potential health effects of 
PFAS exposure are serious. It has been 
linked to liver and kidney damage, 
thyroid problems, and cancer. 
Unfortunately, not all medical pro-
viders are familiar with the risks asso-
ciated with PFAS exposure nor the 
steps that should be taken for those 
who have been exposed. That is where 
my amendment comes in. With nec-
essary training, Department of Defense 
doctors would be able to identify ef-
fects before they get worse and refer 
their patients for appropriate treat-
ment. 
I am glad we are making strides else-
where in this NDAA to expand evalua-
tion of servicemembers for PFAS expo-
sure. This is something I have been 
fighting hard for. Our servicemen and 
-women deserve to know if they have 
been exposed to high levels of these 
dangerous chemicals. 
This amendment builds on these im-
portant provisions and prevents some 
of the situations we have already heard 
about whereby DOD firefighters are 
evaluated for PFAS exposure but not 
provided any additional guidance on 
what future treatment they should 
seek or side effects they should look 
out for. 
I am particularly proud that this 
amendment has garnered support from 
both sides of the aisle—Democrat and 
Republican—because the health of our 
servicemembers should not be a par-
tisan issue. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives 
DELGADO, 
FITZPATRICK, 
POSEY, MACE, LEGER FERNANDEZ, ROSS, 
SARBANES, and my fellow Michigander, 
Representative LEVIN, for their leader-
ship on this package of amendments. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join in supporting these 
commonsense amendments which will 
give our men and women in uniform 
the knowledge and the tools that they 
need to protect themselves. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the en bloc amendment offered by 
Representative SLOTKIN which makes 
seven separate and substantive policy 
changes to the Armed Services Com-
mittee’s bill. 
This amendment, like the underlying 
NDAA, contains provisions that are 
under the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, but 
we have never, never had a legislative 
hearing on these proposals. 
b 2310 
Unfortunately, I fear the lack of due 
diligence on these provisions will cre-
ate implementation confusion and bur-
densome outcomes, not just for the De-
partment of Defense and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, but for ev-
eryday Americans. 
This amendment focuses on PFAS 
chemicals, an entire class of over 9,000 
chemicals. Broadly speaking, everyone 
wants to address PFAS contamination, 
but we have to do it in a smart and 
thoughtful way; otherwise, there are 
considerable consequences. 
Let me point out a few of con-
sequences. 
First, the en bloc amendment’s provi-
sion related to an incineration morato-
rium does not use the defined term 
linking these provisions to the Defense 
Department, but addresses ‘‘materials 
sent to another entity or entities.’’ 
This makes it unclear who is subject 
to an incineration moratorium under 
section 318, potentially extending the 
temporary ban from just the military 
to any person. 
If the executive or judicial branches 
of our government adopt my reading of 
the en bloc amendment, it would have 
profound policy implications on waste, 
storage, and disposal practices in our 
country. Of greatest concern, a policy 
like this has the real potential to over-
whelm existing landfill capacity and 
leave few viable disposal options for 
Americans. This is not the outcome we 
want. 
Setting this interpretation aside, 
though, this language creates a struc-
ture where the Federal Government is 
now deciding on the disposal methods 
of municipal solid waste. This is en-
tirely unnecessary and impractical. 
Further, this framework disregards 
the Federal law governing these mat-
ters, the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act. 
Second, the Toxic Release Inventory 
reporting threshold provisions in this 
amendment 
also 
contain 
problems. 
These 
provisions 
would 
statutorily 
deem these chemicals, without sci-
entific review by EPA, chemicals of 
special concern and prohibit the use of 
existing exemptions. 
Complicating matters, EPA has only 
validated 29 measurement techniques 
for PFAS in drinking water. There are 
172 PFAS currently subject to report-
ing, making measurements on 143 
PFAS unreliable and subject to en-
forcement by EPA. 
Further expanding the reach of the 
Federal Government into areas with-
out proper justification. 
Finally, the amount of people or en-
tities that would need to report is un-
known and could be huge, encom-
passing many parties who neither made 
nor added PFAS to their processes. 
It is a reasonable expectation for 
these stakeholders that, to prove they 
don’t have it, they will need to use in-
valid tests or potentially install fil-
tering technology, even though there is 
no Federal standard. 
In another area, the en bloc amend-
ment recycles provisions from the 
PFAS Action Act which the House 
voted on recently and E&C Republicans 
largely opposed. These requirements 
would create duplicate reporting and 
submission burdens on manufacturers 
and 
administrative 
resource 
con-
straints at EPA and potentially each 
State. 
EPA is already compelling data pro-
duction on existing PFAS from the 
same people for the same ultimate pur-
pose under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act. It makes me 
wonder whether the purpose of these 
and other provisions is to get necessary 
information to EPA to help its essen-
tial data gaps and address PFAS con-
tamination, or if this is about some-
thing else entirely different. 
Much of our debate about the PFAS 
Action Act surrounded the fact that it 
would lead to a de facto ban on these 
chemicals, and it will. 
No one opposes the effort to hold 
DOD accountable for its messes or to 
keep the men and women of the Armed 
Forces and surrounding communities 
safe from environmental harm. But be-
fore we act on the far-reaching lan-
guage of the amendment, not to men-
tion some of the underlying bill, we 
need to know about the facts on the 
ground, especially for this motley crew 
of amendments. 
PFAS are a large class of chemicals, 
as I said, over 9,000, with essential uses, 
including many necessary for our na-
tional defense.

There is a strong lesson here for the 
majority: Follow regular order; hold 
hearings and markups, and your work 
could result in practical, workable, and 
effective policy and a public law. 
Unfortunately, my Democrat friends 
have done the opposite here, seriously 
completing the chance this language 
has at becoming law. I oppose the 
amendment. I urge others to do the 
same.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Ms. 
DEGETTE) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Colorado. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to add the first six titles of the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness in Public 
Lands Act to this year’s NDAA bill. 
This legislation will preserve nearly 
1.3 million acres of public land across 
Colorado, California, and Washington 
State, and it will add more than 1,000 
miles of river to the National Wild and 
Scenic Rivers System. 
Preserving these untouched public 
lands from the threat of future devel-
opment is more than just protecting 
our environment. It is about protecting 
our economy and jobs and our western 
way of life. It is also about ensuring 
that some of our Nation’s most elite 
military pilots have the opportunity 
and the space they need to train. 
Included in the nearly 1.3 million 
acres of land this measure would pro-
tect are some of our Nation’s most im-
portant military training grounds, in-
cluding the High Altitude Aviation 
Training Site, or HAATS, in Colorado, 
that is responsible for training some of 
our most elite helicopter pilots to take 
on some of the harshest conditions 
anywhere on the planet. 
As a fourth-generation Coloradoan, I 
know how important these lands are to 
the people in my State, and I know 
how important these training grounds 
are to the brave men and women who 
serve in our Nation’s military. 
The designations included in this 
amendment were not made up over-
night. They were the result of decades 
of hard work by citizens across the 
State of Colorado, and they have gar-
nered widespread support among the 
public across the West. 
It is why the legislation has been 
passed by this Chamber now three 
times in just 2 years, including as a 
part of last year’s NDAA bill, and 
again, this year, as a standalone bill. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives HUFFMAN, CARBAJAL, CHU, 
SCHIFF, KILMER, NEGUSE, and the chair-
man of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, Chairman GRIJALVA, for their 
unwavering support and all the work 
they have done to get this package to 
the floor. 
I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment to add a package of unrelated 
lands bills to the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. Collectively, this pair 
of bills, this one and the next one, 
amendments, would impose unneces-
sary and harmful restrictions on more 
than 21⁄2 million acres of lands in Colo-
rado, California, and Washington, in-
cluding nearly 11⁄2 million of acres of 
new wilderness designating many miles 
of wild and scenic rivers and creating 
100,000 acres of national monument ex-
pansion. 
These restrictions will have the ef-
fect of greatly reducing opportunities 
for multiple uses of these lands and 
will restrict forest management prac-
tices that will render these lands more 
prone to catastrophic wildfires. 
In Colorado alone, this amendment 
would designate approximately 570,000 
acres of new wilderness areas, 23,000 
acres of expanded wilderness, and 14,000 
acres of potential wilderness. 
Now, we already have 3.5 million 
acres of public lands in Colorado that 
are designated as wilderness, so that 
protection is already there.

Now, I do commend my colleague for 
her efforts to work with local stake-
holders to address some of their con-
cerns over the years that she has been 
working on this issue. But this pack-
age, unfortunately, does not come close 
to the kind of balance and consensus 
that should be required for a package 
of this magnitude. Many of the local 
communities impacted by this amend-
ment and that I have heard from have 
raised significant concerns, including 
the loss of motorized access and recre-
ation, which would threaten their local 
economy. 
A wilderness designation also makes 
it much more difficult or even impos-
sible to remove excess fire hazards or 
invasive species. There is no real man-
agement of the land. Future genera-
tions lose access to the land, at least 
for average, everyday people. In a true 
wilderness area, you can’t even ride a 
bicycle. 
This bill is inconsistent with pre-
vious designations and existing land 
uses by arbitrarily adding wilderness 
areas and wild and scenic river designa-
tions where those designations are not 
really appropriate. Supporting the dec-
laration of areas that do not actually 
possess these characteristics under-
mines the integrity of the Wilderness 
Act and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
for what was originally intended. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, the 
past 18 months have been difficult for 
all of us. But through the hardship, 
Americans have found solace and se-
renity in our beautiful public lands. 
Back home in Los Angeles, the Rim 
of the Valley Corridor stands out as a 
jewel of nature. We must preserve this 
area of striking beauty so that future 
generations can enjoy all that it has to 
offer. 
My amendment will add 191,000 acres 
of the Rim of the Valley Corridor to 
the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, empowering the Na-
tional Parks Service and the local 
community to better protect its nat-
ural resources and habitats. 
This is a cause I have worked on for 
two decades and one that has over-
whelming support among my constitu-
ents and those in the region. Let’s get 
it over the finish line. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive DEGETTE
for her extraordinary 
leadership, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the amendment. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), who has 
a district where, actually, this designa-
tion would take place. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding his time and for his leadership 
and protecting freedom for multiple 
uses of our public lands by opposing 
sloppy Democrat land grabs like the 
ones contained in this amendment. 
This amendment is loaded with more 
than 30 different land grabs that under-
mine our national security interests. I 
have actually traveled in helicopters 
with our servicemen and servicewomen 
who say that this bill would hinder the 
land that they currently practice over, 
with these wilderness designations, and 
it would prevent them from amazing 
training that they do, bringing people 
in worldwide. 
The U.S. Department of Defense uses 
750,000 tons of minerals each year for 
equipment and other important tech-
nologies. Copper is used to manufac-
ture military planes and ships. Silver 
is used in Apache helicopters. Beryl-
lium is used to enhance the speed of 
fighter jets. Molybdenum is used for ar-
mored vehicles, missiles, and aircraft. 
The amendment we are discussing 
proposes to add nearly 1.5 million acres 
of new wilderness and permanently 
withdraws 1.2 million acres from min-
eral production. 
Again, our Department of Defense 
needs 750,000 tons of minerals each 
year. This amendment permanently 
withdraws 1.2 million acres that con-
tain critical minerals and other rare 
earths that we need for defense, to pro-
tect our men and women in uniform. 
Approximately 550,000 of those 1.5 
million acres that would be locked up 
by these new wilderness designations 
are in my district. Now, can you imag-
ine if I had a bill designating the 16th 
Street Mall in Denver, Colorado, and 
said that there would be a wilderness 
designation. I mean, it is wild and sce-
nic, but I don’t have a bill that does 
such because I tend to my district. 
None of the Colorado acres proposed 
for the wilderness designation in this 
amendment are located in the district 
represented by the sponsor of this 
amendment, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Colorado has 2 minutes 
remaining. The time of the gentleman 
from Colorado has expired. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, all of the six areas 
in this bill have been studied, have 
been worked on, and have been under 
consideration for several decades, as 
my colleague, Mr. SCHIFF, pointed out. 
The areas in Colorado in my bill were 
originally 
designated 
as 
wilderness 
study areas in the 1980s, and they have 
already been managed as wilderness for 
almost 40 years. What this would do is 
it would simply make permanent what 
everybody in Colorado knows. These 
are the most special wild areas that we 
can have. 
My colleague from Colorado alleges 
that helicopter training would be pre-
vented by this bill, but, in fact, that is 
incorrect. After working with the Na-
tional Guard, we withdrew the areas 
that were scheduled to be wilderness 
and called them potential wilderness so 
that the helicopters can continue to 
land there, as I pointed out in my open-
ing statement, allowing our military to 
have the high-level training that they 
need. 
Finally, to my knowledge, there are 
no rare minerals in any of the six po-
tential areas of this bill. In fact, what 
we are doing is simply preserving for 
future generations the wilderness that 
we all know and the wilderness that 
stimulates 
jobs 
and 
the 
economy 
throughout the West. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this amendment and preserve these 
very special places, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Colo-
rado (Ms. DEGETTE). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

paragraph (A) shall be subject to— 
(i) valid existing rights; and 
(ii) such terms and conditions as the Sec-
retary may require. 
(C) LIMITATIONS.—The program carried out 
under paragraph (1) shall only include fugi-
tive methane emissions that can be captured 
for use, or destroyed by flaring, in a manner

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment with Chairman 
GRIJALVA. It would amend H.R. 4350 to 
add the text of two bills, H.R. 577, the 
Colorado 
Outdoor 
Recreation 
and 
Economy Act, and H.R. 1052, the Grand 
Canyon Protection Act. These bills 
have already passed the House with bi-
partisan support not once, not twice, 
but three times. 
They would protect our public lands, 
natural resources, and Tribal cultural 
sites and help preserve access to our 
clean water, clean air, and a livable en-
vironment. 
b 2330 
Of course, as climate change becomes 
a growing national security threat, we 
know that conservation becomes a 
moral imperative. My bill, the CORE 
Act, would conserve over 400,000 acres 
of public land and consists of four ti-
tles that Coloradans have been asking 
for Congress to pass literally for over a 
decade. 
One of those provisions that I would 
like to focus on tonight is the Camp 
Hale and 10th Mountain Division leg-
acy. This includes establishing the first 
ever national historic landscape at 
Camp Hale in my district in honor of 
the storied legacy of the Army’s 10th 
Mountain Division in Colorado and 
around the world. 
It was in the mountains of Colorado 
that American soldiers received the 
training that allowed them to defeat 
Germans in the northern Italian Alps 
and lead our Nation to victory during 
World War II. Those same soldiers 
came back to the State of Colorado and 
literally built the modern ski industry 
in our wonderful State. 
Hut visitors share the special spirit 
of the 10th Mountain Division in their 
pursuit of excellence, self-reliance, and 
love of the outdoors, and my constitu-
ents in Summit County and Eagle 
County and across Colorado have been 
imploring the United States Congress 
to take steps to make these protec-
tions a reality, literally for years. 
As a result, Madam Speaker, I would 
encourage my colleagues to support 
this important amendment to protect 
our treasured public lands, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 11⁄2 minutes. 
I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment because it restricts approxi-
mately 400,000 acres of land in Colo-
rado, and although the stated goal of 
the language is to protect and enhance 
outdoor recreation—and I agree with 
that goal as stated—the practical ef-
fect of this amendment would not be 
that at all. 
For one thing, the active manage-
ment of land that is under wilderness 
designation to prevent wildfires is 
much restricted, if not made impos-
sible. In a State with a lot of wildfire 
risk, that is simply not acceptable. 
Rural county commissioners have 
talked to me and other opponents of 
this bill and have raised concerns 
about negative economic impact of the 
withdrawal of 200,000 acres of oil and 
gas land and what effect that would 
have on their communities. 
This amendment would also lock 
away approximately 1 million acres of 
public lands in Arizona and perma-
nently ban mining and other multiple- 
use activities in that State. This mis-
guided and mistitled land grab has 
nothing to do with protecting the

Grand Canyon. Instead, it seeks to ban 
development of one of the largest 
tracts of uranium deposits in the coun-
try. 
The result of this is to make us more 
reliant on adversaries such as Russia. 
We already import 97 percent of our 
uranium from foreign sources, and that 
would only become more precarious if 
this took effect. Since 2018, the major-
ity of uranium imports have come from 
adversarial nations such as Russia. 
What this amendment is doing in the 
National Defense Act makes no sense 
at all. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, with 
much respect to my colleague from 
Colorado Springs, he knows, because 
we have debated this amendment every 
year for the last 3 years, every time we 
have successfully added this amend-
ment to this particular bill, that the 
statements regarding this bill and the 
notion that it locks up land in the way 
that he describes is simply not true. 
He knows that this bill only includes 
73,000 acres of wilderness with respect 
to the CORE Act. I know my colleague 
from Colorado Springs certainly is 
aware that this bill includes 80,000 
acres for specific recreational use, to 
preserve the ability for folks to be able 
to go mountain biking and to enjoy 
those outdoor areas. Of course, that is 
why this particular bill has so much 
support from local communities. 
I was a bit surprised, Madam Speak-
er, to hear this notion that county 
commissioners have talked to my col-
league from Colorado Springs. I would 
suggest that he talk to the county 
commissioners in Gunnison County, in 
Pitkin County, in San Juan County, in 
San Miguel County, in Eagle County, 
or perhaps the city councils in Avon, 
Basalt, 
Carbondale, 
Crested 
Butte, 
Glenwood Springs, perhaps Gunnison, 
maybe Mountain Village, Ridgway, 
Telluride. I don’t want to go through 
all of the communities, Madam Speak-
er, because I would expend my entire 5 
minutes. 
I think my point is fairly clear, 
which is that this bill has broad sup-
port within the communities that it 
would impact, and therefore I would 
certainly 
encourage 
my 
colleagues 
again to support this particular amend-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
LAMBORN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
let’s actually hear from Representa-
tives who live in these areas. 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong opposition to this amend-
ment. 
This amendment includes the Grand 
Canyon Protection Act, falsely named 
legislation, which has nothing to do 
with the Grand Canyon and is a cover 
for a giant Federal land grab that 
hurts our economy and our national se-
curity. 
This land grab of over one million 
acres in my State will destroy as many 
as 4,000 jobs and cost $29 billion in sac-
rificed economic activity. 
Now, I am perplexed that the major-
ity would bring this up under the Na-
tional Defense Authorization as this 
reckless land grab actually hurts our 
national security. We heard from the 
gentleman from Colorado that these 
are areas where we have some high 
grade uranium. In fact, the costarter of 
Greenpeace, 
Michael 
Shellenberger, 
has actually said that if you want a 
green economy like the other side does, 
you definitely have to have nuclear, 
and this is one of those ways. 
But we constantly keep going down 
this road where we make ourselves de-
pendent on other countries, like Rus-
sia, Uzbekistan, and those areas. Isn’t 
it interesting that we want to sub-
jugate ourselves to foreign interests 
and foreign oversight? That is not the 
way we should be doing it. We should 
have our own way of doing it. 
Last but not least, the way uranium 
is actually leached into the atmosphere 
is by air and by water, which are the 
portals that these breccia pipes have 
contained. Actually, taking the breccia 
pipes out of this area actually makes it 
easier for penetration of water in our 
subsurface areas. 
I urge this not be adopted and once 
again return it back to our States for 
any other jurisdiction. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time remains 
on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
has 1 minute remaining. The gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). The 
gentlewoman is from the western part 
of the State where this would actually 
take place, and I believe she is in touch 
with the people in her district. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment, which has nothing to 
do with the national defense, creates 
significant land restrictions on nearly 
400,000 acres of land in Colorado. 
This entirely inappropriate amend-
ment to the NDAA seeks to create 
73,068 acres of new wilderness in Colo-
rado, which will severely restrict all 
forms of recreation, much-needed man-
agement, and economic activity. We 
can all agree that we need forest man-
agement, and the answer is not a 
hands-off approach. 
While there are a lot of terrible poli-
cies in this amendment, one of my big-
gest concerns is the increased threat of 
disastrous wildfires that will result 
from the new wilderness designations 
and other land grabs in this bill. 
Colorado just came out of one of the 
worst wildfire seasons we have ever ex-
perienced. In 2020 the U.S. set a new 
record for the number of acres burned 
by wildfires, as more than 10.3 million 
acres went up in smoke. 
Wilderness is the most restrictive 
land use designation possible, and it 
prevents active management in our for-
ests, which is critical to prevent cata-
strophic wildfires. 
I have spent months meeting with 
foresters, experts in the timber indus-
try, and active management advocates. 
Every one of them has said we do not 
need wilderness areas in Colorado, and 
wilderness areas prevent active man-
agement of our forests and have exac-
erbated catastrophic wildfires. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment is a 
blatant attempt to sneak a deeply par-
tisan environmentalist wish list into 
the vital and important funding vehicle 
of our Nation’s defense. 
b 2340 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
would just again say I think many of 
the communities that I referenced and 
the various stakeholders that have 
been engaged and working on this bill 
would take offense at this notion that 
it is some, I think the word used was 
secret environmental wish list or what-
ever the case may be. 
Clearly this bill, in particular the 
CORE Act, has broad local support. 
With respect to wildfires, my district 
was the site of the first and second 
largest wildfires in the history of Colo-
rado in 137 years. It is why we created 
a bipartisan wildfire caucus working 
with several Republicans in the United 
States Congress to come together on 
solutions that would address this epi-
demic of pervasive wildfires across the 
Rocky Mountain west. 
This bill is about protecting the leg-
acy of public lands in Colorado and 
across the western United States to en-
sure that our children can enjoy the 
same public lands that we are so 
blessed and treasured to have in our 
State. 
Madam Speaker, again, I would urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, just 
like the previous amendment, this 
amendment was successfully added to 
last year’s NDAA, but the conferees 
properly dropped it from the final con-
ference report, so it ultimately failed. 
It is simply unacceptable that we 
would add an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act that 
not only has nothing to do with na-
tional defense, but this actually hurts 
our national defense by empowering 
adversaries like Russia with their ura-
nium production while limiting our 
own domestic national production of 
uranium. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE).

JERSEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 18 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I have an amendment at the

section 2851 of title 10, United States Code, 
as amended by this section and section 2803. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to offer my amendment 
that will help countless struggling 
small businesses and communities ac-
cess new opportunities and unlock the 
local economic potential of military 
bases across the country. 
My amendment would incentivize the 
use of local small businesses for mili-
tary construction projects by asking 
the Secretary of Defense to provide 
preference for businesses that will use 
workers from within the same State or 
within a 60-mile radius from where the 
work will occur. 
My amendment would also strength-
en a provision in the underlying bill to 
finally provide some transparency in 
the 
military 
construction 
project 
award process, helping small businesses 
at least be aware of when possible con-
tracts and subcontract opportunities 
become available. 
I represent Joint Base McGuire-Dix- 
Lakehurst, which for decades has been 
an economic engine in my community 
and in my State with thousands of jobs 
tied to operations on the base. 
However, too often contracts at bases 
like mine go unseen by small, local 
businesses who are qualified and ready 
and sometimes more cost effective 
than contractors from out of State. 
Since coming into Congress, I have 
met with business owners from around 
the Joint Base who have stressed to me 
that not only are they not considered 
for military construction contracts, 
but in many cases the Department of 
Defense does not even make local busi-
nesses aware of the contracts that are 
available. 
I introduced the Put Our Neighbors 
to Work Act and offer it as an amend-
ment here for the construction workers 
in my district who are looking for their 
next opportunity and to provide some 
fairness to the award process for small 
and local businesses who have been 
passed over for far too long. 
This is a good amendment that would 
help to expand opportunities for small 
and local businesses in the construc-
tion industry at a time when so many 
across the country are struggling. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
NORCROSS, Congressman GARAMENDI, 
and Congressman PFLUGER for helping 
push this bipartisan effort forward. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to stand up for small and 
local businesses by voting to pass this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Utah is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I oppose this amendment passion-
ately as I jumped into a debate on this 
during general debate, because I am so 
excited to jump into it. I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak. 
This to me is a classic case of we 
agree, we just are seeing a very dif-
ferent approach in how we want to go 
about doing this. I have enjoyed my 
time on the Armed Services Committee 
immensely these past 9 months, and for 
one reason alone, we can find areas of 
collaboration and areas that we can 
work on together. 
Military construction that will go to-
wards projects like providing housing 
for our men and women serving is a top 
priority across the board for Demo-
crats and Republicans. I am going to 
highlight just some of the funda-
mental, key reasons why this amend-
ment and many others, especially in-
dustry folks, with respect to the cham-
ber of commerce, the National Defense 
Industry of America, the Associated 
General Contractors of America, and 
American Council of Engineering Com-
panies, they oppose this effort. 
In addition to the industry side, and 
I never thought that I would say this 
as I start my debate, President Biden

September 21, 2021 
and his administration are also in op-
position to this for a few key reasons. 
One, this impacts skilled workforce. 
The local hiring preferences would sig-
nificantly impact the military con-
struction contractors’ workforce by 
creating scenarios where long-term, 
highly skilled workers may have to be 
laid off in order to meet local hire 
mandates. Then, in order to comply 
with 
the 
requirements, 
employers 
would have to bring in unnecessary and 
unskilled workers to fill those now va-
cant 
positions, 
creating 
additional 
costs and safety concerns. 
Local preference requirements false-
ly assumes that there is a local pool of 
qualified military contractors at the 
ready, and they are capable of per-
forming the work. In the language you 
see, the language even uses ‘‘when 
practical.’’ And I always struggle with 
that, because how can we legislate on 
‘‘when practical’’? 
I believe we should let the individ-
uals that are putting out bids and win-
ning these contracts determine what 
they can best do for those areas. 
Now, I am a huge supporter of local 
support. And you can go to Hill Air 
Force Base in Layton, Utah, to find out 
how we have been able to embrace the 
local community and enhanced use- 
lease projects. We are doing it better 
than anywhere else in the country, and 
I am firm on it, and I am actually will-
ing to share the best practices, and I 
am pushing hard to change up some of 
these budget requirements or these la-
beling requirements so we can kind of 
blow through the issues that we have. 
The MILCON budget is overloaded 
right now. We do not have the money 
to do a fraction of the projects that we 
have out there. Like I mentioned ear-
lier, bricks are literally falling off the 
dormitories for our airmen. 
Other reasons to oppose it. This is 
contrary to judicial precedence. Leslie 
Miller, Inc. versus Arkansas, the Su-
preme Court ruling held that the bid on 
Federal contracts cannot be required 
to first submit state licensing proce-
dures. It undermines competition. 
And lastly, but most importantly, it 
increases cost to contractors and gov-
ernment at a time where we don’t have 
enough money in our MILCON budget 
to add additional costs. 
So again, with the increased costs 
right now every construction company 
I talk to are bursting at the seams 
with potential projects and no labor to 
do it. If we add on additional require-
ments to hire specifically locally, even 
if the contract is sort of similar, if you 
do the base in Tinker and then you go 
to Air Force base, and you go to 
Wright-Patt, 
there 
is 
consistency 
there. There is opportunity to scale. 
This is a fundamental business concept 
where we have to be able to leverage 
and allow for business and industry to 
thrive and do this more cost effec-
tively. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 2350 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I am glad that we are able to 
have this debate and talk about what it 
is that we are trying to prioritize here. 
When we are talking about the workers 
here, this bill, this amendment, is not 
something that would force the Sec-
retary of Defense to hire unqualified 
workers to be able to work on our 
bases. That is absolutely not the case 
here. 
It is talking about, in the cir-
cumstances where there are qualified 
workers, wouldn’t we want to prioritize 
the local workers that are part of that 
community? 
We are proud in my district to host a 
military base. We are proud in New 
Jersey to have multiple different mili-
tary installations, and I am sure other 
States are very proud of the military 
installations that they host as well. 
I hope that the Department of De-
fense is proud of that partnership with 
our States. That is exactly what this 
is. It is a partnership. This can be a 
win-win. In the same way that we are 
looking out for our joint military base 
in our community, we would like the 
joint military base to think of itself as 
part of that community. 
I believe in the workforce of my 
State and other States, and I believe 
that the workforce across America is 
strong. I believe that we have the 
skilled labor all over this country to be 
able to do this. 
That is why we have been able to get 
this bipartisan bill. That is why I have 
been able to get the support of Con-
gressman PFLUGER and to be able to 
continue to move forward in the way 
that we need to do this for our small 
businesses, for our workers, to be able 
to help build strong national security. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Utah has the right to 
close. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I urge support for my amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I am just going to reiterate the con-
cept of the enhanced use lease that is 
done better than anywhere else that I 
have discussed or heard or seen at our 
base in Utah. 
I want to take this opportunity to 
highlight that that is embracing the 
local workforce, and it is doing it more 
cost-effectively on multiple different 
types of projects. 
I am going to continue to push for us 
to embrace that concept more within 
all of our military bases because it has 
proven to be a really good model to do 
it more cost-effectively and with the 
right type of labor. 
This adds an extra burden that is un-
necessary to be able to accomplish 
what we want it to. I will again reit-
erate that increased costs to a MILCON 
budget that can’t even do the work 
that it is trying to do right now is only 
going to exacerbate the issue. We need 
to let these companies that bid on 
these projects do this the appropriate 
way and without adding a whole bunch 
of extra burdens. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Sherman-Waters 
amendment, No. 746. 
Madam Speaker, for quite some time, 
Chairwoman WATERS and I have been 
in favor of strong sanctions against 
Russia for interference in our elec-
tions. 
Now, I don’t want this to be partisan. 
There is this idea that only Democrats 
care about protecting our elections 
from Russian interference. That is not 
the case. 
When the Senate was controlled by 
Republicans, the Senate Intelligence 
Committee issued a report stating: 
‘‘The Russian Government engaged in 
an aggressive, multifaceted effort to 
influence, or attempt to influence, the 
outcome of the 2016 Presidential elec-
tion.’’ But there are those who think 
that perhaps President Trump did not 
believe that Russia tried to influence 
our elections. 
Putting aside 2016, what did the 
Trump administration say about our 
2018 election? 
On September 30, 2019, the Trump 
Treasury Department announced sanc-
tions in response to Russian inter-
ference in our 2018 election, and then 
the Trump administration imposed 
sanctions on a ‘‘Russian agent’’ for try-
ing to influence our 2020 election. Par-
tisanship stops at the water’s edge. 
We need to stop Russia from inter-
fering in our elections. Both parties 
have imposed sanctions on Russia for 
doing so. The question is how we make 
those sanctions effective. 
Existing sanctions apply to the pur-
chase of sovereign debt—this is debt 
issued by the Russian Government— 
but only when you are acting as the 
underwriter, not purchases in the sec-
ondary market. That is ineffective. 
In May of this year, the Russian Dep-
uty Finance Minister told us that when 
he said sanctions-imposed restrictions 
don’t cover the secondary market and 
so they are going to be ineffective or, 
in his words: ‘‘So we don’t expect the 
share of nonresidents to move far from 
the current levels.’’ 
We need to listen to the Russian Dep-
uty Finance Minister as to how to 
make the sanctions that both Demo-
crats and Republicans agree on more 
effective. The sanctions imposed here 
will raise the cost of borrowing of the 
Russian Government by between half a

percent and three-quarters of a percent 
based on a rating by ACRA. 
Further, it is good economic policy. 
We have a scarce amount of investment 
capital in the United States. I want to 
see it invested in American businesses, 
either in stock or as loans by our 
banks and others to our companies. 
Can anybody make the argument 
that we are worse off if money is in-
vested in American companies instead 
of being lent to Vladimir Putin? 
There is no credible argument as to 
why American pension plans, asset 
managers, and households should be 
funding the Russian Government at a 
time when, in 2016, 2018, and 2020, both 
parties and former President Trump re-
alized that Russia was interfering in 
our elections and deserves to be sanc-
tioned. Let’s make those sanctions ef-
fective by adopting this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, it is my understanding that 
the ranking member of the committee 
of jurisdiction is opposed. Therefore, I 
must be opposed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SHERMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
see no substantive reason why the 
ranking member is opposed to this 
amendment. Both parties agree Russia 
has interfered in our elections in 2016 
but more recently in 2018 and 2020. 
Both parties and the Trump adminis-
tration agree that Russia should be 
sanctioned. But the Deputy Finance 
Minister of Russia pointed out that our 
sanctions so far have not been effec-
tive, that they are not effective until 
they apply to the secondary market. 
That is exactly what this amendment 
does. It is time to raise the cost of bor-
rowing by the Russian Government and 
to see that money invested in Amer-
ican businesses, lent to American com-
panies, instead of being lent to the 
Russian Government. 
Madam Speaker, I hear no sub-
stantive argument against that propo-
sition, and I urge adoption of the 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-

AMENDMENT NO. 23 OFFERED BY MR. SCHIFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 23 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the 
following new section: 
SEC. 5ll. EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE OBTAINED 
WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. 
Section 271 of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subsection: 
‘‘(d) Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, any information obtained by or with 
the assistance of a member of the Armed 
Forces in violation of section 1385 of title 18, 
shall not be received in evidence in any trial, 
hearing, or other proceeding in or before any 
court, grand jury, department, officer, agen-
cy, regulatory body, legislative committee, 
or other authority of the United States, a 
State, or a political subdivision thereof.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment clarifies the authority of 
military commission judges to order 
court processing at Guantanamo to be 
broadcast over the internet. This is a 
straightforward, 
noncontroversial 
amendment that the House has passed 
twice by voice vote. 
The GAO has studied this issue and 
concluded there are no technical bar-
riers to broadcasting proceedings on 
the internet, and it can be done while 
protecting classified information. 
This amendment comes down to sim-
ply whether or not we believe the 
American people have the right to ob-
serve the military commission pro-
ceedings, including against members of 
al-Qaida who planned the 9/11 attacks. 
I believe that families of victims, 
journalists, academics, NGOs, and any 
American interested should be able to 
follow the proceedings without flying 
to Guantanamo, a difficult and lengthy 
process at best. I also believe this 
amendment is important because these 
military commissions have, in fact, 
failed. 
After so many years, they have not 
delivered anything that could be called 
justice, but their distance hides the ex-
tent of their failings. 
As we work toward closing Guanta-
namo, which I strongly support, we 
should cease to hide the legal processes 
happening there. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, the amendment allows some 
of the most hardened terrorists in U.S. 
custody a platform to publicly broad-
cast their message. Letting these vi-
cious terrorists know there is a public 
audience for their hate will do far more 
harm than good. 
It is important to note that Federal 
courts have consistently stuck to their 
guns against broadcasting major ter-
rorism cases, such as the trial of 
Zacarias Moussaoui. I see no reason to 
make an exception for terrorists at 
Guantanamo. 
DOD has informed us they share 
these serious concerns and strongly op-
pose this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose the amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCHIFF. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
would simply point out that this 
amendment permits these judges to 
broadcast the proceedings so that peo-
ple can witness them. It doesn’t man-
date that this be done in every case. I 
think these judges ought to have the 
discretion to do so. 
This amendment makes it very clear 
that GAO has studied this issue and 
found that it is more than techno-
logically feasible. 
I think it is important that the 
American people, particularly the vic-
tims of 9/11 who would like to witness 
these proceedings, be allowed to do so. 
The victims of 9/11 can’t easily travel— 
many of them can’t travel at all—to 
Guantanamo to review the proceedings. 
I think that the victims of that hei-
nous terrorist attack should have the 
ability to face those and observe the 
proceedings against those who have 
been charged with those offenses. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I have a right to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama does have the 
right to close. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment to in-
crease 
transparency 
into 
the 
pro-
ceedings in Guantanamo and allow the 
victims of 9/11 to observe the pro-
ceedings, as many of them would like 
to, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I am concerned that adoption 
of this amendment would create a 
major recruiting platform for terror-
ists and create security risks. 
The Biden administration is opposed 
to this amendment. I oppose this 
amendment, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ I yield back the 
balance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-

amendment offered by the gentleman

The question is on the amendment

fornia (Mr. SCHIFF). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

AMENDMENT NO. 24 OFFERED BY MR. SCHIFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 24 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title X, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 1024. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF MILITARY 
COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS. 
Section 949d(c) of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(4) In the case of any proceeding of a mili-
tary commission under this chapter that is 
made open to the public, the military judge 
may order arrangements for the availability 
of the proceeding to be watched remotely by 
the public through the internet.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this amendment. 
In June 2020, as individuals came to-
gether to proclaim that Black lives 
matter and speak out against the mur-
der of George Floyd, Donald Trump 
saw these lawful protests as an oppor-
tunity to once again abuse the power of 
his office. 
The former President threatened to 
deploy U.S. military units to cities 
across the country to serve as de facto 
law enforcement. The threat only 
heightened an already tense situation 
and risked catastrophe had he followed 
through. 
The posse comitatus laws protect 
American citizens against the abuse of 
the military as a domestic law enforce-
ment agency, but it has loopholes that 
need to be fixed. My amendment would 
do so. 
The goals of this amendment are sim-
ple: strengthen restrictions to ensure 
the mission of the U.S. military cannot 
be abused and protect the civil lib-
erties of our citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, we al-
ready have laws that prohibit the 
United States military from carrying 
out domestic policy on United States 
soil. This amendment would prohibit 
evidence obtained by the military in 
violation of the Posse Comitatus Act 
from being used in a court or other 
legal proceedings. 
While I am actually sympathetic and 
believe this issue is one that is worthy 
of our consideration in its current 
form, I urge opposition. The issue is 
simply too complex to rush through 
here without careful consideration and 
deliberation in regular order. 
The implications of this amendment 
are also unclear. We have a crisis on 
our southern border, a crisis that con-
tinues to be ignored by Democrats and 
is continually getting worse. What hap-
pens, for example, if the continued fail-
ures of the Biden policies cause the sit-
uation at our southern border to be-
come so dire that our military is called 
to secure our border and the military 
obtains 
evidence 
of 
trafficking 
or 
smuggling or some other crime? 
We simply do not know enough about 
changing this longstanding legal docu-
ment here today to jam it into a Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. This 
is an issue that needs to go through a 
more robust process where the commit-
tees of jurisdiction can hold hearings 
and fully explore all possible con-
sequences. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the motion, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, it is 
not that complicated. The current 
posse comitatus laws prohibit violation 
of this rule against using the military 
for law enforcement purposes but apply 
it only to two branches of the military, 
the Army and the Air Force. This 
would extend it to the other branches 
of the military. It is as simple as that. 
It also provides that if you violate 
the law, you shouldn’t use the evidence 
from the violation of that law in court 
proceedings. That is a well-established 
principle of criminal law, and it ought 
to apply here as well. 
It is really quite simple. That is what 
this amendment would do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I be-
lieve I have the right to close on this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is correct. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, who 
has the right to close? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has the right to 
close. 
b 0010 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I would just say the gentleman 
in his introduction of the amendment 
said that while President Trump—he 
talked about President Trump and the 
riots that took place last summer—he 
said, well, I would just point out that 
while President Trump was talking 
about deploying the military to deal 
with the riots that were happening in 
so many major urban areas around our 
great country, what were Democrats 
doing? 
What were Democrats doing? 
They were defunding the police, and 
they were raising money to bail the 
very rioters out who were destroying 
property and attacking police officers 
to raise money to bail those individ-
uals out of jail. And now here tonight 
we have some policy that hasn’t been 
through committee and hasn’t been 
through any process trying to be put 
into the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I urge oppo-
sition to this, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I will 
now close. 
This amendment is quite simple. It 
would extend the posse comitatus law 
to all branches of the military so it is 
not abused. 
This is not about defunding the po-
lice. That is the usual red herring argu-
ment when there is no argument to be 
made on the merits. 
So this would simply say that the 
prohibition against abusing the mili-
tary and dragooning it as a method of 
enforcing domestic laws ought to be ex-
tended to every branch of the military 
not just two of the branches of the 
military. And those who would violate 
this law cannot use evidence gained in 
violation of the law against individ-

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2021 
No. 163 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who locked the oceans 
in their vast reservoirs, we honor Your 
glorious Name. 
Lord, Your power has sustained our 
Nation in the past, and we place our fu-
ture in Your hands. Each day we are in-
spired by the splendor of Your holiness. 
We see Your handiwork in the glory of 
the sunrise and the majesty of the sun-
set. 
Lord, continue to rule in the lives of 
our lawmakers. Do not turn a deaf ear 
to their prayers, as they seek to do 
Your will. Be for them their strength 
and shield during these challenging 
days. May they continue to find in You 
a future and a hope. 
We pray in Your amazing Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, September 21, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, 
a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, Speaker PELOSI and I put in 
motion the path to pass a continuing 
resolution that in one fell swoop would 
accomplish four very important things. 
It would keep the government open 
through December 3 of this year and 
avoid a needless and dangerous shut-
down. It would provide emergency 
funding to help resettle Afghan evac-
uees; it would approve tens of billions 
of dollars in disaster aid funding; and it 
will suspend the debt ceiling until De-
cember of 2022, commensurate with the 
time necessary to cover the debt of the 
bipartisan 
$908 
billion 
emergency 
COVID-relief bill passed at the end of 
last year. 
Now, today, I want to spend some 
time focusing on the last of these 
items, addressing the debt limit to 
avoid a first-ever default in American 
history. 
Throughout modern history, address-
ing the debt ceiling has consistently 
been done on a bipartisan basis. Let me 
repeat that. Throughout modern his-
tory, addressing the debt ceiling has 
consistently been done on a bipartisan 
basis. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has 
been raised approximately 80 times 
under both Republican and Democratic 
administrations and under both unified 
and divided government. So much for 
the argument by Leader MCCONNELL 
that when all three branches are con-
trolled by one party, the debt ceiling 
ought to be their exclusive domain. 
That is not what history has shown, 
and that is not what happened actually 
in 2017 when Donald Trump was Presi-
dent, MCCONNELL was majority leader, 
and MCCARTHY was Republican Speak-
er—I believe it was MCCARTHY back 
then—but the debt ceiling was renewed 
bipartisan. 
To do otherwise, to not do the debt 
ceiling in a bipartisan way, has been 
considered unthinkable because the 
consequences for the economy, for the 
American people, and for our standing 
on the world stage would be too severe. 
Senate Republicans and the Repub-
lican leader, however, are again engag-
ing in fantastical feats of sophistry to 
justify why this time is somehow dif-
ferent. We know it is not. We all know 
the truth. Democrats and Republicans 
both had a hand in approving the 
spending we now must pay. 
Look, we know the Republican jus-
tification for forcing a default is to-
tally dishonest, plain and simple. Don’t 
ask me; just listen to the Wall Street 
Journal. Here is what it said: 
Congress would still need to raise the debt 
limit this fall even if no new major spending 
programs were enacted. 
This idea that they don’t want to 
raise the debt ceiling to deal with fu-
ture spending is just totally false. Ask 
the Wall Street Journal. 
The fact is, our continuing resolution 
would suspend the debt limit through 
December of 2022, an amount of time 
commensurate with the debt incurred 
as a result of passing the bipartisan 
$908 billion emergency COVID relief 
legislation in December of last year. 
Remember, that legislation was drafted 
by Republicans, voted for by Repub-
licans, and put on the floor by Leader 
MCCONNELL, who voted for it, and 
signed by a Republican President. 
Democrats worked with our colleagues 
to pass this bill because it was the 
right thing to do for our families, our

small businesses, and suffering commu-
nities. 
Our CR is now carefully tailored— 
carefully tailored—to account for this 
debt. This is as reasonable as it gets. 
So for Republicans to suddenly throw 
their hands in the air and abscond from 
their responsibility to pay debt that 
they proudly supported is nothing 
short of a dine-and-dash of historic pro-
portions. 
Republicans racked trillions of dol-
lars of debt under President Trump and 
are demanding American families foot 
the bill. What will this do? It could 
stop payments to Social Security re-
cipients. It could stop payments to vet-
erans. It could raise interest rates, 
making a mortgage or car loan more 
expensive. It could cause local govern-
ments to pay more in interest, and 
that might mean increased taxes for 
people. This is playing with fire. Play-
ing games with the debt ceiling is play-
ing with fire and putting it on the 
backs of the American people. 
Of course, there is a very quick and 
easy way to make sure we avoid all of 
this from becoming even a possibility. 
Republicans simply don’t have to vote 
to force a default. It is that simple. 
Democrats will do the right thing 
and the responsible thing when the 
continuing resolution comes for a vote 
on the floor. We will see who among 
the Republican conference will do like-
wise. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ROHIT CHOPRA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
in addition to keeping our government 
open and maintaining our govern-
ment’s full faith and credit, Senate 
Democrats will also continue working 
this week on confirming even more of 
President Biden’s nominees to the 
bench and to his administration. 
For the information of my col-
leagues, later today, I will move to file 
a discharge petition on the nomination 
of Rohit Chopra to serve as Director of 
the Consumer Finance Protection Bu-
reau. In the wake of the financial crisis 
of 2008, the CFPB was created under 
the Obama administration with a sim-
ple mandate: protect American con-
sumers from predatory financial prac-
tices. 
Rohit Chopra is the right man to lead 
this Agency after it languished under 
the 
Presidency 
of 
Donald 
Trump. 
Trump didn’t really care about the av-
erage person being taken advantage of 
by the big financial institutions, de-
spite his claim he is a working-class 
President. Mr. Chopra, on the other 
hand, has a long history of defending 
student loan borrowers from unscrupu-
lous for-profit colleges and already 
served in the CFPB under President 
Obama, where he was defending the 
rights 
of 
middle-class 
people 
who 
might be taken advantage of by rapa-
cious financial institutions. He has the 
experience; he has the dedication; and 
he will have the support of Senate 
Democrats when his nomination is 
brought to the floor this afternoon or 
later this week. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over 
the next few weeks, Senate Democrats 
will also move forward on a number of 
noncontroversial nominees critical to 
keeping our country safe and advanc-
ing American diplomacy abroad. 
Over the last few months, there has 
been a growing backlog on these nomi-
nees due to Republican obstructionism, 
and it is our hope, starting this week, 
we can move to secure their confirma-
tion. 
But, last week, a number of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
announced they will seek to delay 
these nominees for no other reason 
than to score cheap political points in 
an effort to win fans on the far right. It 
is no secret. People leading this are all 
competing to run for President on the 
Republican side in 2024, and they are in 
feverish—feverish—pursuit of the ex-
treme right in this country, which they 
think will help them win a primary. So 
they tie this Chamber in a knot but, 
more importantly, jeopardize the secu-
rity of Americans. 
This is unacceptable. Every one of 
these nominees won bipartisan, if not 
unanimous, 
support 
in 
committee. 
That same level of support should con-
tinue on the floor. The Republicans 
who are delaying the confirmation of 
these nominees are deliberately mak-
ing the American people less safe—less 
safe on the foreign policy side, where 
we need nominees to the Defense and 
State Departments, and less safe on 
the domestic side as well, where there 
is talk of holding up U.S. attorneys 
who are in charge of prosecuting Fed-
eral laws in all the States. 
Under normal circumstances, all of 
these nominees should be dispensed 
with speedily and without controversy, 
but because of the self-interest of a few 
obstructionists, the Senate could be 
forced to drag out what is normally a 
simple process. 
I urge these colleagues to drop their 
theatrics immediately and allow these 
nominees to these critical Agencies to 
go through. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now a 
quick update on voting rights. Last 
week, several of my colleagues intro-
duced the Freedom to Vote Act, a pow-
erful new bill that would tackle head- 
on voter suppression, partisan gerry-
mandering, and the scourge of dark 
money. 
The legislation also responds to rec-
ommendations from election officials 
and includes new provisions to boost 
confidence in our elections, including 
critical anti-election subversion re-
forms, a flexible voter ID standard, and 
commonsense voter list maintenance 
requirements. This legislation will pro-
mote greater confidence in our elec-
tions, and I believe all Senators—Dem-
ocrat, Republican, and Independent 
alike—should support the package. 
At the end of last week, I moved to 
place the Freedom to Vote Act on the 
legislative calendar, enabling me to 
schedule a vote on this bill in the im-
mediate future. 
This week, my colleague Senator 
MANCHIN, who helped craft this legisla-
tion and relied on many of the good 
practices in West Virginia to do so— 
Senator MANCHIN, this week, is making 
an effort, a good-faith effort, to reach 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to win support of the Freedom to Vote 
Act, and, in fact, he has been meeting 
with a number of Republican col-
leagues. 
We are committed to finding com-
mon ground, if there is common ground 
to be found. We look forward to hear-
ing what changes Republicans might 
want to make. And if Republicans en-
gage earnestly and honestly, we will 
work with them. The voting rights 
working group I convened earlier this 
year is prepared to help in that effort, 
but we need to move quickly. Time is 
of the essence. 
As Senator MANCHIN said earlier this 
year regarding congressional action on 
voting rights, ‘‘Inaction is not an op-
tion.’’ I agree with Senator MANCHIN in 
that regard. 
To that end, it is my intention to 
hold a vote for the Freedom to Vote 
Act here on the Senate floor. If Repub-
licans are unwilling to move forward, 
Democrats will have to move on our 
own. Inaction from Republicans on vot-
ing rights is not an excuse to do noth-
ing. We are going to take action to 
make sure we protect our democracy 
and fight back against the disease of 
voter 
suppression, 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering, and election subversion 
that is metastasizing at the State 
level. 
f 
HAITI 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, and fi-
nally on Haiti, we have all seen these 
horrible 
images 
coming 
from 
our 
southern border as Haitian asylum 
seekers, simply looking to escape tyr-
anny and the problems, that they have 
sought—have been met at our doorstep 
with unimaginable indignity. 
Images of Haitian migrants being hit 
with whips and other forms of physical 
violence is completely unacceptable. 
This behavior must be addressed, and 
we must provide accountability. The 
images turn your stomach. It must be 
stopped, this kind of violence. 
Right now, I am told there are four 
flights scheduled to deport these asy-
lum seekers back to a country that 
cannot receive them. Such a decision 
defies common sense. It also defies 
common decency and what America is 
all about. Remember that lady in the 
harbor in the city in which I live. 
So I urge President Biden and Sec-
retary Mayorkas to immediately put a 
stop to these expulsions and to end this

title 42 policy at our southern border. 
We cannot continue these hateful and 
xenophobic Trump policies that dis-
regard our refugee laws. We must allow 
asylum seekers to present their claims 
at our ports of entry and be afforded 
due process. 
I commit to work with this adminis-
tration to provide resources so that we 
can establish safe, orderly, and humane 
processes for those seeking protections. 
Again, the policies that are being en-
acted now and the horrible treatment 
of these innocent people who have 
come to the border must stop imme-
diately. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDER—S. 2765 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there is a bill at the desk that 
is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The leader is correct. 
The clerk will read the bill by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2765) to provide that Members of 
Congress may not receive pay after October 
1 of any fiscal year in which Congress has 
not approved a concurrent resolution on the 
budget and passed the regular appropriations 
bills. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
TAXES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
senior House Democrat told us back in 
March of 2020 that COVID presented ‘‘a 
tremendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit our vision.’’ 
President Biden said last week that 
‘‘while 
this 
pandemic 
has 
been 
godawful for so many reasons . . . it 
does present us with an opportunity.’’ 
The 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree that Washington Democrats are 
assembling behind closed doors would 
put more debt, more borrowing, and 
more inflation on the shoulders of 
American families. It would make 
Washington, DC, dramatically more in-
volved in families’ childcare, their 
health coverage, their local energy 
utilities, and on and on. 
There are so many controversial 
changes being crammed into one mega 
bill that it must be a deliberate strat-
egy: try to achieve everything the far 
left has wanted for 20 years in one fell 
swoop before the country has time to 
realize what hit it. 
So today, I am going to focus on just 
one example. Let’s look at the tax 
hikes, a staggering historic set of tax 
hikes; tax hikes on small business, tax 
hikes on family farms, tax hikes on 
Americans that would shatter the 
pledge to spare people earning less 
than $400,000 a year, tax hikes that 
would put even more Americans into 
unfair double taxation of the death tax, 
massive taxes on the U.S. economy 
that would give us one of the least 
competitive tax structures in the de-
veloped world. 
For example, even Communist China 
taxes their own businesses signifi-
cantly less than President Biden and 
his allies want America to tax ours. 
Tax hike after tax hike after tax 
hike—a 
smothering 
wet 
blanket 
thrown onto an economy that is al-
ready struggling to fully recover be-
cause of the inflation and worker 
shortages 
that 
Democrats’ 
policies 
have already unleashed. 
So when you add it all up, Democrats 
want to ram through one of the largest 
peacetime tax hikes on record, if not 
the single largest. So let me say that 
again. Behind closed doors, Washington 
Democrats are drafting what may very 
well be the largest peacetime tax hike 
that our country has literally ever 
seen. 
But this isn’t to say that nobody gets 
a leg up in this bill. So listen to this. 
Somehow, mysteriously, many of the 
Democrats’ favorite groups and special 
interests come out just fine. Isn’t that 
fascinating? 
For example, their legislation would 
allow ordinary Americans’ charitable 
deduction on top of the standard deduc-
tion to expire. Ah, but they would re-
place it with a brandnew tax break of 
almost exactly the same dollar amount 
for union dues that go to Big Labor. So 
you take out a charitable deduction for 
regular Americans, put in a new one 
for union dues that would benefit Big 
Labor. They are scrapping Americans’ 
extra deduction for donating to charity 
and replacing it with a special subsidy 
for union dues for Big Labor. 
Really, you can’t make this stuff up. 
Sorry, Red Cross. Sorry, local churches 
and houses of worship. Sorry, soup 
kitchens. Democrats think the Team-
sters and the SEIU need the money 
more than you do. 
And they aren’t the only group that 
Democrats favor, who literally make 
out like bandits. Look at high-income 
earners in coastal blue States. The bill 
that raises taxes on everything that 
moves 
somehow—somehow—makes 
room for a special, gigantic tax cut for 
wealthy people who choose to live in 
high-tax States. More than half the 
benefit of the so-called SALT policy 
would go to the top 1 percent of house-
holds. 
There is also a special tax break for 
people who choose to purchase expen-
sive electric cars. You get the picture: 
make U.S. industry less competitive 
than China in order to massively sub-
sidize the coastal cosmopolitan life-
style. That is what the Democrats 
want. 
This bill would also create a new na-
tional dragnet for ordinary Americans’ 
banking 
information. 
Community 
banks and credit unions would be ham-
mered with new requirements to report 
to the feds whenever citizens make 
transactions—listen to this—in excess 
of $600. Community banks and credit 
unions would have new requirements to 
report to the Federal Government 
whenever citizens make transactions in 
excess of $600. 
Big Brother wants to peer into Amer-
ica’s bank accounts. Here is how one 
local Kentucky lender described this 
concept to me: a ‘‘flagrant violation of 
privacy and offense to liberty.’’ 
That pretty well sums it up. So, huge 
tax hikes on Americans, expensive 
giveaways for coastal elites, and new 
government snooping—snooping—into 
families’ finances. 
So that is just one corner of this 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that should never see the light of day. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a different matter. Last week, Sen-
ate Democrats announced what was 
marketed as a compromise on carving 
out a bigger role for Washington in 
elections all across our country. 
It was hardly the first time our 
Democratic colleagues had given their 
takeover of 50 States’ election laws a 
makeover. Over the years, it has some-
times been sold as an urgent overhaul 
of our democracy; other times as just a 
set of narrow tweaks. But for all of 
their attempts to change up the pitch, 
the unfortunate fact is that the bones 
of the Democrats’ proposal are still the 
same. 
The latest version is only a com-
promise in the sense that the center 
left compromised with the far left. 
Under the hood is the same Franken-
stein’s monster that has been there 
since 2019, years—years—before the 
State-level actions which Democrats 
now claim have made it all necessary. 
It still makes Washington bureau-
crats the de facto board of elections for 
all 50 States, dictating the terms of 
things like automatic and same-day 
voter registration. It still insists on 
impeding State efforts to ensure integ-
rity of voter rolls through popular, 
commonsense voter ID measures. It 
still has government dollars going di-
rectly to politicians’ campaigns—that

is the public funds for bumper stickers 
and attack ads. It still empowers par-
tisan regulators to circumvent the bi-
partisan FEC and engage in even more 
intimidation of private citizens who 
engage in political speech. And these, 
of course, are just to name a few. 
Now, surely, as the Senate continues 
to do its job and strike down misguided 
ideas like these, we will hear plenty 
from folks who consider it evidence 
that this body is broken. But, of 
course, that simply is not true. The 
Senate is fully capable of taking land-
mark, bipartisan action that makes it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat. 
Back in 2002, I was involved, along 
with my colleague Chris Dodd, in pass-
ing the Help America Vote Act. I was 
one of the leaders on that. We empow-
ered State and local election systems 
to follow commonsense guideposts for 
integrity and accessibility. It provided 
basically a grant program to States to 
help them upgrade their voter systems 
after the Florida election in 2000. And 
the Senate passed it 92 to 2—92 to 2. 
So if our Democratic colleagues real-
ly want to find common ground and act 
on common sense, the roadmap is right 
there. But, unfortunately, we know 
that has never been the case. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
latest 
‘‘com-
promise’’ is just a repackaging of what 
even reporters called a messaging bill 
that was headed nowhere. The sub-
stance is not really changing, so nei-
ther will the result.

The

Also 
under the previous order, the Senate 
will proceed to executive session to re-
sume consideration of the following 
nomination, which the clerk will re-
port. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Margaret Irene Strickland, of 
New Mexico, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the District of New 
Mexico. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The

The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARGARET IRENE STRICKLAND 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today 
the Senate will vote on the nomination 
of Margaret Strickland for the U.S. 
District Court for the District of New 
Mexico. 
For nearly 15 years, Ms. Strickland 
has served the people of New Mexico as 
a public defender and a civil rights at-
torney. With her extensive qualifica-
tions and distinguished career in public 
service, Ms. Strickland will make an 
excellent addition to the New Mexico 
District Court. 
She began her legal career in the Law 
Offices of the Public Defender for the 
State of New Mexico, a role in which 
she handled nearly every type of crimi-
nal case. Over the years—and this is an 
amazing number—she has tried nearly 
90 cases. The vast majority of her prac-
tice has been in Federal court. 
Here in the Senate, Ms. Strickland 
boasts the strong support of her home 
State Senators, Senators HEINRICH and 
LUJA´ N. Her nomination also received 
bipartisan support in our Judiciary 
Committee. She received a ‘‘well quali-
fied’’ rating from the American Bar As-
sociation. 
And like so many of the nominees 
coming from the Biden administration, 
she really shows professional diversity 
in her background. As a former public 
defender and civil rights attorney, she 
will offer a legal perspective that we 
often find missing from the bench. She 
has demonstrated an unwavering com-
mitment to equal justice under the 
law, and as a judge, she will ensure 
that every voice is heard in the court-
room. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
On another note, Mr. President, in 
the coming days, this Senate has a his-
toric decision to make and very little 
time to make it. We have to set aside 
politics, which the American people 
are begging us over and over to do, and 
we have to ensure that our government 
can continue to function in the midst 
of this public health crisis and a recov-
ering economy. Now, in any reasonable 
scenario, these would be noncontrover-
sial and nonpartisan endeavors, but 
sadly, at this moment in the U.S. Sen-
ate, reason is in short supply. 
In recent days, some of our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
have indicated that they are prepared 
to—listen to this—sabotage the routine 
process of government for political rea-
sons. This could have a catastrophic 
impact on this Nation. 
Last week, Senator MCCONNELL reit-
erated that Republicans will not join 
Democrats in voting to deal with the 
debt limit. What exactly does it mean? 
Well, imagine if you and I just up and 
decided to stop paying your credit card 
bills. If Congress fails to raise or sus-
pend the debt limit before the Treasury 
runs out of cash, our Nation runs the 
risk of default for the first time in his-
tory. That is why lawmakers have to 
set aside politics, as we have done 
nearly 80 times in our history, to keep 
the government’s bills being paid. 
Truthfully, this shouldn’t even be a de-
bate. 
Raising or suspending the debt limit 
has nothing to do with any new pro-
grams or new spending. It is about pay-
ing off the tab that the government has 
already incurred. We are receiving the 
bill at the restaurant after we have had 
the big meal; the question is whether 
we will pay it. 
Here is the kicker: Much of the debt 
that the Republicans are threatening 
not to pay was approved by Senate Re-
publicans when Donald Trump was in 
the White House. In other words, we 
are being asked to approve the Trump 
debt from his years in the Presidency, 
which largely had the support of the 
Republicans, and the Republicans are 
telling us: ‘‘Hands off. We won’t accept 
responsibility for the things we voted 
for during the Trump years.’’ 
The last time Congress suspended the 
debt limit was in August 2019, a little 
over 
halfway 
through 
President 
Trump’s term. Between then and the 
beginning of President Biden’s term, 
congressional Republicans approved $6 
trillion in new debt. In fact, during 
Trump’s one term in office, the na-
tional debt ballooned by 36 percent. 
Fiscal 
conservatives? 
During 
the 
Trump administration, the national 
debt ballooned by 36 percent. Well, that 
surely has happened before in history? 
No, I am sorry, it has not. That is the 
fastest it has grown under any Presi-
dent in American history. The Trump 
years were the biggest debt years in 
the history of the United States, and 
now the Republicans don’t recognize it. 
They want to walk away from it. 
You may be wondering: For what 
noble or productive purpose did the Re-
publicans go so deep in debt during the 
Trump years? Well, a big chunk of it 
was Donald Trump’s tax giveaway to 
the richest Americans—$2 trillion—$2 
trillion in tax cuts for people at the 
superwealthy level in America. And 
now it is time to say to the Repub-
licans: You voted for those tax cuts. 
The wealthiest people in America ap-
plauded you. Now would you at least 
step up and admit it? 
Nope. Now that it is time for Repub-
licans to pay for the meal that they 
ate, the political banquet, they are 
vowing instead to dine and dash. They 
are taking a page straight from the 
playbook of Donald Trump, the man 
who called himself proudly ‘‘the king 
of debt,’’ a man who didn’t pay his own 
bills as a businessman and who in-
curred the largest increase in the na-
tional debt of any President in history. 
And in the process, the Republicans— 
to take this incredible and inexplicable 
stand—are willing to risk the full faith 
and credit of the United States. 
When it comes to America’s debt, de-
fault is simply not an option for any 
rational person. There is not a single 
American who will emerge unscathed if 
the Republicans execute this political 
strategy.

threatens Social Security payments for 
tens of millions of Americans, it 
threatens healthcare coverage for tens 
of millions more, and it could slash 
benefits for our Nation’s veterans. Who 
could be proud of that vote? 
On a national global scale, default 
would be, in the words of Mark Zandi, 
Moody’s chief economist, ‘‘financial 
Armageddon.’’ It would send markets 
into free fall and threaten America’s 
status as the world’s reserve currency. 
Imagine that. You say to the seniors: 
Well, maybe/maybe not on your Social 
Security payments. And, incidentally, 
the stocks and the ETFs and the mu-
tual funds and the investments you had 
for your retirement—hang on tight; 
they are about to take a huge hit, a hit 
that is totally avoidable. 
Back in 2011, when House Repub-
licans initially refused to raise the 
debt limit, America’s credit rating was 
downgraded. So what? Interest rates 
went up, so we are paying more money 
in interest instead of paying it for 
things 
America 
values—healthcare, 
education, infrastructure. 
Some economists believe that epi-
sode hurt consumer confidence and 
hobbled our economy in the great re-
cession. It also stuck taxpayers with 
billions of dollars in increased bor-
rowing costs. Think about how fragile 
America’s economy is at this very mo-
ment. We are still recovering from a 
once-in-a-century public health crisis 
and the worst economic crisis in 75 
years. The last thing we need is a self- 
inflicted crisis that is motivated by 
partisanship. 
Mr. President, right now, our econ-
omy has to be our highest priority. We 
need to come together and get the gov-
ernment funded. We also have an obli-
gation to provide financial relief to 
Americans who have been hit by the 
environmental disasters. My State es-
caped that, but tomorrow that may not 
be the case. You never know with these 
extreme weather events. Hurricane Ida 
was an eye-opener for many parts of 
this country. People are suffering. Dis-
aster aid for these people is essential. 
We need to also help resettle the ref-
ugees from Afghanistan. They risked 
their lives for Americans; we should 
make a home for them here in the 
United States. 
We also want to make sure that we 
support our military in every way pos-
sible. 
Instead of bickering and political 
brinksmanship, Congress needs to rise 
to this moment of crisis. The American 
people sent us to Washington not to 
manufacture crises but to prevent 
them. That is exactly why Senate 
Democrats are moving ahead to put 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
plan in place. Pay our debts, invest in 
a prosperous future—that is our plan. 
We would love to have Republican sup-
port for it. We have a once-in-a-century 
opportunity to consider working fami-
lies, middle-income families, strug-
gling families, not the wealthy. 
The Build Back Better plan will grow 
our economy for generations to come. 
If fully enacted, it will create a future 
for every parent to take off work to 
care for a newborn child. Every high 
school grad can receive a college edu-
cation and set their sights on a good- 
paying job. And every senior citizen 
can afford prescription drugs they need 
without dipping into their saving. 
These investments will make America 
healthier, happier, stronger, and more 
prosperous. 
And unlike President Trump’s give-
away to the rich, President Biden’s 
Build Back Better plan is a prudent in-
vestment in our Nation’s financial fu-
ture. We are going to pay for it; that is 
the Senate Democrats’ intent. It will 
not be added to the deficit. 
I look forward to discussing that plan 
in detail in the weeks to come. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Senators THUNE, HEINRICH, 
and LUJA´ N be able to complete their re-
marks prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any objection? 
Seeing none, without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there has 
been a good discussion already on the 
floor this morning—I was listening to 
my colleague, the Democratic whip— 
discussing the upcoming challenges 
that we face this fall. We have got to 
fund the government, we are facing the 
debt limit issue, and of course the 
Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending- 
spree proposal that we will have to deal 
with at some point too. 
The issue that has been raised is, why 
wouldn’t Republicans want to help 
raise the debt limit? And I think the 
answer is very simple. The Democrats 
control the entire government here. 
They control the House, they control 
the Senate, they control the White 
House, and they have a procedure here 
in the Senate that enables them to 
raise the debt limit with 51 votes. They 
don’t need a single Republican vote to 
raise the debt limit. 
They keep arguing that, well, in the 
past, there have been, you know, pre-
vious times when the debt limit has 
been a bipartisan issue. And in most 
cases, those were times, of course, 
when there was divided government 
and there was actually negotiation 
over these issues, which there isn’t 
right now. I mean, this tax-and-spend-
ing spree being proposed by the Demo-
crats is the largest expansion of gov-
ernment as a percentage of GDP, I be-
lieve, in history—certainly going back 
to the 1930s. 
But there is no question that this is 
a blowout spending bill that the Demo-
crats have decided to do all on their 
own. Not a single Republican will vote 
for it. 
And so the debt increase that would 
accommodate all of that additional 
spending—the 
massive 
amount 
of 
spending, in some cases financed with 
tax increases—but that is another 
issue, and I am going to get to that in 
just a minute. But the amount of debt 
that would be added as a result of the 
$3.5 trillion the Democrats want to 
spend, on top of the $2 trillion that 
they spent earlier this year in Feb-
ruary—again, done all on Democrat 
vote; no Republicans participated in 
that—is a very, very different scenario 
than when there have been in the past 
attempts to actually work in a bipar-
tisan way. 
My colleague from Illinois mentioned 
the fact of the increase in the debt 
under the previous administration— 
what the level had been, somewhere on 
the order of 6 or $6.5 trillion—and I 
have to remind people that 4.5 trillion 
of that was negotiated in response to 
the crisis of the pandemic. And that 
was a negotiation between Republicans 
and Democrats, where both sides sat 
together and said, ‘‘We have to do 
something; we have to react in a quick 
way, a bold way, to what is happening 
around the country,’’ and created pro-
grams like the PPP program, which 
helped a lot of small businesses sur-
vive, 
helped 
with 
payments 
to 
healthcare providers for PPE and other 
costs to get them through this, money 
for vaccines, money for people who had 
been unemployed as a consequence of 
the pandemic. These were all costs as-
sociated with the pandemic that were 
negotiated in a bipartisan way, Repub-
licans and Democrats working to-
gether. 
What we have in front of us right now 
is the Democrats proposing the biggest 
expansion of government probably in 
the history of this country. And if you 
look at what they are calling $3.5 tril-
lion, a lot of outside groups, like the 
Committee for Responsible Federal 
Government, say it is $5.5 trillion. Ei-
ther way, it is a massive amount of 
spending, all of which would dramati-
cally increase the size of the govern-
ment in this country and people’s de-
pendence upon government. I call it 
the ‘‘free everything’’ bill because, es-
sentially, that is what it is. 
What I would simply suggest to my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
is that if you want to spend $3.5 trillion 
or $5.5 trillion—whatever that number 
is—and you want to do it with 51 votes, 
without any discussion or negotiation 
or attempt to even reach out to Repub-
licans on this, then, you ought to do it. 
Republicans were in the room. They 
negotiated a bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, $1.2 trillion, that passed here with 
69 votes, and would pass overwhelm-
ingly, I think, in the House, unless cou-
pled with this massive spending bill, 
and then it would be signed into law by

September 21, 2021 
the President. That is an example of 
what can happen when you sit down 
and negotiate. 
On this other $3.5 trillion they have 
decided to do, they have decided to ex-
pand massively the size of the Federal 
Government, and to do that, they are 
going to add to the Federal debt. And 
it seems pretty straightforward, I 
think—and I think most Americans 
would understand—that if you control 
the entire government—the House, the 
Senate, and the White House—and it is 
all your spending that is going to be 
necessary or that is going to be respon-
sible for requiring an increase in the 
debt limit, then you ought to do it 
with Democrat votes. I think that is a 
perfect way of looking at this that 
would fit with the views of where most 
Americans are, most of whom, I be-
lieve, don’t want to see their Federal 
Government going another $3.5 trillion 
into debt or massively expanding the 
size of the Federal Government at a 
time when inflation is already out of 
control. 
I want to speak to that because infla-
tion is rapidly becoming a serious prob-
lem. Currently, inflation is near a 13- 
year high. It has outstripped wage 
growth for many Americans, including 
the lowest earning workers. In other 
words, the rise in the price of every-
thing from goods to groceries has re-
sulted in a de facto pay cut for Amer-
ican workers. 
So why are we experiencing this level 
of inflation? Well, as I mentioned, one 
reason is Democrats’ decision in March 
to flood the economy with unnecessary 
government spending. President Biden 
and congressional Democrats took of-
fice mere weeks after Congress had ap-
proved a fifth—fifth—bipartisan COVID 
relief bill. And it was abundantly clear 
that we were not in immediate need of 
trillions more in government spending. 
But that didn’t matter. It didn’t mat-
ter to Democrats. 
Now that they were in control of 
Congress and the White House, they 
wanted to take advantage of the 
COVID crisis. So in the name of COVID 
relief, they pushed through a massive 
partisan piece of legislation, filled with 
unnecessary spending and handouts to 
Democrat interests groups. Schools, 
which had barely touched the tens of 
billions they had already been given, 
got billions more. State governments, 
the majority of which did not need 
more government assistance, got ac-
cess to a staggering—staggering—$350 
billion slush fund. Labor unions were 
made eligible for loans that were de-
signed to rescue Main Street small 
businesses. And I could go on. 
At the time, Republicans warned 
about the bill’s level of spending. And 
we weren’t alone. More than one liberal 
economist warned that pouring that 
much money into the economy at that 
time could result in inflation. And 6 
months later, here we are. Inflation is 
near a 13-year high, and Americans are, 
rightly, worrying about whether their 
paychecks will stretch to cover the 
higher prices that they are facing. 
In the face of that fact, and consid-
ering 
the 
substantial 
amounts 
of 
money we had to borrow to meet the 
COVID crisis, you might think that 
Democrats would be taking a moment 
to reflect and perhaps think about 
ways to rein in excessive spending. But 
you would be wrong. In fact, Demo-
crats have decided to double down on 
their failed strategy and pass another 
massive 
government 
spending 
bill, 
even bigger—even bigger—than the last 
one that I just mentioned. That is 
right. Now Democrats are putting to-
gether a $3.5 trillion spending bill to 
follow up on their $1.9 trillion spending 
bill from this last March. 
And to put those numbers in perspec-
tive, the entire Federal budget for 2019 
was less than $4.5 trillion. Dumping 
that much money into the economy is 
pretty much guaranteed to continue to 
fuel the kind of inflation that Ameri-
cans are currently experiencing. In 
fact, there is a good chance it could 
make things much worse. 
And that is not the only way Ameri-
cans are likely to suffer as a result of 
Democrats’ proposed tax-and-spending 
spree. Americans are going to also feel 
the pain of the $2 trillion in tax hikes 
the Democrats are contemplating. 
It always fascinates me how Demo-
crats think that you can just pass tax 
increases without consequences. To 
hear Democrats talk, you would think 
that you can impose $2 trillion in tax 
hikes and everything will just keep 
going along unchanged. But, of course, 
we all know that is not the way it 
works. There is no such thing as con-
sequence-free taxation. 
Raise 
taxes 
by 
any 
meaningful 
amount, and people are most likely 
going to change their behavior. A small 
business, for example, may think twice 
about hiring an additional worker if it 
is facing a tax hike. A larger business 
may decide not to open that new plant 
it has been planning or it may insti-
tute a hiring freeze or it may decide 
that it needs to encourage some early 
retirements. 
Democrats’ $2 trillion tax hike would 
be the largest tax hike in decades. 
Democrats are proposing to raise taxes 
on large businesses, on small busi-
nesses, on investment, and on retire-
ment savings. And the list goes on. And 
every one of those taxes will have con-
sequences for ordinary Americans. 
Democrats are proposing a corporate 
tax rate higher than the one imposed 
by communist China. That is going to 
put American businesses at a disadvan-
tage on the global stage. And when 
American businesses suffer, American 
workers suffer. 
Democrats always seem to forget 
that most Americans are employed by 
businesses, and that, as a result, when 
you raise taxes on businesses, ordinary 
Americans 
tend 
to 
feel 
the 
con-
sequences. 
If Democrats succeed in passing their 
$2 trillion tax hike, it is going to have 
serious economic consequences for reg-
ular 
Americans—consequences 
like 
fewer jobs and opportunities; slower or 
nonexistent wage growth, especially 
with higher inflation eroding house-
hold spending power; and fewer bene-
fits. 
Americans can also expect to see 
higher utility bills, thanks to Demo-
crats’ proposed tax hikes on large busi-
nesses and on energy development. 
I have been talking for a while now, 
and I haven’t even gotten to the spend-
ing side of the Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree. Frankly, it is difficult 
to know even where to start. This pro-
posal reads more like a spending ency-
clopedia. There is spending on pretty 
much every topic from A to Z. 
There are the big-ticket items, of 
course, the supposedly free stuff that 
Democrats are emphasizing, such as 
free community college and free pre-K. 
Then, there are the items Democrats 
aren’t advertising as much, like the 
$200 million—yes, $200 million—for a 
park in House Speaker PELOSI’s dis-
trict that features a luxury accommo-
dation and a golf course. Given that, I 
am not sure why this park needs $200 
million from the Federal Government, 
but I guess being Speaker ‘‘hath its 
privileges.’’ 
In fact, one Democrat Representative 
admitted as much, noting that it seems 
that, and I quote, ‘‘Speaker PELOSI gets 
maybe a little bit more . . . on some of 
these bills,’’ but then went on to argue 
that she deserves it for being Speaker. 
But moving on, there is a nearly $80 
billion increase in funding for the 
IRS—yeah, $80 billion. That is enough 
to nearly double the Agency’s size. But 
I guess you have to have a lot of new 
agents to collect all of those new tax 
hikes. 
Then there are new and expanded 
subsidies for electric vehicles. Under 
the Democrats’ proposal, a couple 
could be making well over half a mil-
lion dollars yet still claim more than 
$12,000 from the Federal Government to 
purchase an electric car. 
There is a Civilian Climate Corps— 
several of them, in fact—at various 
government Agencies, $20 billion for a 
National Climate Bank to subsidize 
Democrats’ 
pet 
environmental 
projects, and—I am not making this 
up—a new tax break to subsidize mem-
bership dues to unions—plus much, 
much more. 
And, of course, with all that govern-
ment spending comes new government 
regulations—a long, long, long list of 
them. 
The consequences of the Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending spree could be dev-
astating—for our economy and for 
American families. And, unfortunately, 
Democrats have the ability to force 
this legislation through on a solely 
partisan basis. 
I know there are at least some Mem-
bers of the Democrat Party here in 
Congress who are uncomfortable with 
the stratospheric levels of spending the 
Democrats are proposing, and I hope 
that their cooler heads will prevail. 
Meanwhile, I and every Republican 
will do everything we can to protect

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6563 
September 21, 2021 
Americans from Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spending legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
NOMINATION OF MARGARET IRENE STRICKLAND 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I am 
quite pleased that the Senate will soon 
be voting on the confirmation of Mar-
garet Strickland, President Biden’s 
nominee to be a district court judge for 
the District of New Mexico. 
Ms. Strickland was born and raised 
in the southwest border region where 
this district court seat presides. She 
attended New Mexico State University 
and the University of Texas at El Paso, 
before attending law school at New 
York University. 
Ms. 
Strickland 
returned 
to 
the 
Southwest after law school and started 
her career with the Las Cruces Office of 
the New Mexico Public Defender, rep-
resenting clients in the juvenile drug 
court and in felony defense work. 
In 2011, Ms. Strickland formed her 
own law firm, continuing her public 
service work representing indigent de-
fendants in Federal court. Ms. Strick-
land has litigated both criminal and 
civil cases, including a significant 
number in the Federal district court 
located in Las Cruces, NM. She has 
also appeared before the New Mexico 
Court of Appeals, the New Mexico Su-
preme Court, and the Tenth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, and filed before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
Ms. Strickland served on the board of 
the New Mexico Criminal Defense Law-
yers for over a decade, including as its 
president. In 2018, the Federal District 
of New Mexico appointed her to rep-
resent all Criminal Justice Act lawyers 
as a panel representative. 
Ms. Strickland has also done signifi-
cant volunteer work with programs 
that reduce the rate of euthanasia for 
companion animals. She and her hus-
band Greg foster dogs and puppies set 
for euthanasia so the dogs can be 
placed in a home. 
If confirmed, Ms. Strickland will be 
faced with one of the biggest Federal 
dockets in the country and inheriting a 
very heavy backlog of cases. 
I am, however, confident that her ex-
perience and her incredible work ethic 
will best position her to immediately 
get to work. 
Ms. Strickland is a highly qualified 
nominee with the right experience, the 
right temperament, and the right dis-
position to be a fairminded district 
court judge. The ABA agrees, giving 
her a majority ‘‘well qualified’’ rating. 
She has spent her entire professional 
career working in the community in 
which she will sit. She knows inti-
mately the impact that the legal sys-
tem has on everyday Americans, and 
she understands that serving as a judge 
is very different from serving as an ad-
vocate. 
She is ready and prepared to shift 
from zealously and effectively rep-
resenting clients to faithfully applying 
the law to the facts of a specific case. 
Both before and after her nomination 
was announced, New Mexicans called 
my office in favor of Ms. Strickland. I 
heard from judges, from prosecutors, 
from defense attorneys, and everyday 
New Mexicans. All of them called to 
say how much they believe in Ms. 
Strickland. Like those New Mexicans 
who called into my office, I believe Ms. 
Strickland belongs on the bench, and I 
am ready to cast my vote and help her 
get there. 
I 
enthusiastically 
support 
Ms. 
Strickland’s nomination for district 
court judge for the District of New 
Mexico, and I hope that all of my col-
leagues will join me in confirming this 
highly qualified nominee. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the nomi-
nation of Executive Calendar No. 231, Mar-
garet Irene Strickland, of New Mexico, to be 
United States District Judge for the District 
of New Mexico.

Whitehouse, Michael F. Bennet, Tim 
Kaine, Tammy Baldwin, Cory A. Book-
er, Sherrod Brown. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-
imous consent, the mandatory quorum 
call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the nomination 
of Margaret Irene Strickland, of New 
Mexico, to be United States District 
Judge for the District of New Mexico, 
shall be brought to a close? 
The yeas and nays are mandatory 
under the rule.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT RYAN KNAUSS 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
have come to the floor of the Senate 
today on behalf of myself and the sen-
ior Senator from Tennessee, MARSHA 
BLACKBURN, to honor the life and leg-
acy of a heroic Tennessean, U.S. Army 
SSG Ryan Knauss, who was killed in a 
terrorist attack while serving the 
country that he loves so in Afghani-
stan on August 26, 2021. 
Staff Sergeant Knauss served with 
the Army’s 9th Psychological Oper-
ations Battalion, 8th Psychological Op-
erations Group at Fort Bragg. He was 
from Corryton, TN—a small, rural 
community where love of country and 
volunteerism runs deep. 
Corryton is known for being the 
hometown of country music star Kenny 
Chesney, and now it will be known for-
ever as the home of our hero, SSG 
Ryan Knauss. 
Ryan was 23 years old when he laid 
his life down for his Nation. I have spo-
ken 
with 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Knauss’s 
widow Alena and his father Greg. 
Through our conversations, I got to 
know a little bit more about Staff Ser-
geant Knauss. And I am here today to 
share with you all and with the Amer-
ican people just who Staff Sergeant 
Knauss was. 
He was a devoted husband. Ryan met 
Alena when they were in high school 
working at a local pizza parlor. I 
sensed her deep love for Ryan when we 
spoke, and I am certain that Alena 
feels blessed to have had the oppor-
tunity to be loved by someone like 
Ryan.

He was a loyal son. After speaking 
with Ryan’s father Greg, it was clear 
the love and the commitment that SSG 
Ryan Knauss had for his family and his 
fellow soldiers was unwavering. 
I can only tell you that after hearing 
of Ryan’s dedication to his family and 
his country, it is the hope and prayer 
of every parent to have a son as honor-
able and principled as Ryan. As a fa-
ther, I told Greg I couldn’t fathom his 
grief. 
Ryan had hoped to soon become a fa-
ther himself. He and Alena had plans to 
try for their first child when he came 
back from overseas. And building a 
nursery was at the top of their to-do 
list when he was to arrive home. 
Staff Sergeant Knauss was a stead-
fast friend. His own friend spoke of his 
charm and intelligence at a memorial 
service at his former high school in 
Corryton. He was a charismatic person 
to whom people were instantly drawn. 
SSG Ryan Knauss was a proud and 
honorable soldier. And when his coun-
try needed him at such a dire time, he 
fiercely answered the call. 
Even as a child, Ryan knew his call-
ing was to serve. In a friend’s elemen-
tary school yearbook, Ryan wrote that 
he wanted to serve in the U.S. Armed 
Forces. And as a freshman in high 
school, he signed up for the ROTC pro-
gram. As one of his fellow soldiers ex-
plained, ‘‘This was his dream job, and 
he . . . ran with it.’’ 
Ryan’s unit, Detachment 10, de-
scribed it as follows: 
Ryan knew the dangerous situation he was 
going to, but protecting innocent civilians is 
one of the values that drove him. It has been 
said that life is not important except in the 
impact it has on other lives, and Ryan had 
an incredible impact on his family and 
friends. And thanks to his actions, thousands 
of children will have the joy of knowing a 
childhood free from danger and oppression. 
The Bible teaches us that no one has 
‘‘greater love than this, than to lay 
down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ Staff 
Sergeant Knauss did just that. He died 
a hero’s death. He made the ultimate 
sacrifice for his Nation, for all of us. 
Ryan will be remembered as a selfless 
and heroic man—a Tennessee volun-
teer—who, with a servant’s heart, gave 
everything of himself at just 23 years 
old for the country that he loved so 
dearly. 
I ask that each of you here today join 
me in continuing to pray for the 
Knauss family and uplift them in the 
coming days and months as they lay 
their soldier to rest at Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Madam President, from the moment 
that President Biden announced the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghan-
istan in April, the people of the United 
States—after two decades of war—had 
hoped to mark the end of our presence 
in Afghanistan with a secure and or-
derly exit and with our honor intact. 
As we know, what ensued proved to 
be the opposite. Hubris fueled the ad-
ministration to proceed with a flawed 
exit plan from Afghanistan. They al-
lowed a calendar to dictate our with-
drawal rather than the conditions on 
the ground. Loss of life and humilia-
tion have been the result, with our al-
lies and our partners openly ques-
tioning the resolve and the competency 
of the United States. 
Those harrowing images of Afghan 
teenagers falling from the sky after 
clinging to a U.S. military plane as it 
took off from the Kabul airport, the 
utter chaos at the gates of the Kabul 
airport, and the loss of 13 U.S. service-
members, 
including 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Knauss, would compel any reasonable 
person to ask why events had to unfold 
in this manner. 
Against the operational failure in Af-
ghanistan and this loss of credibility 
abroad, we are fortunate in knowing 
that the people of the United States 
still retain their unique spirit—that 
American desire to come to the aid of 
others in need. 
Those Americans stranded in Afghan-
istan, the former Afghan interpreters 
who stood with our military, Afghan 
women and children who worked with 
our aid organizations—these people 
needed our help, and our servicemem-
bers, our diplomats, our aid workers, 
and journalists all deserve recognition 
and credit for their sacrifice as they at-
tempted to help. 
TRIBUTE TO STAFF 
Madam President, I want to take this 
opportunity to highlight another group 
of Americans who rarely receive the 
public recognition they deserve, the 
staff right here in the U.S. Senate. 
These staffers shun the spotlight and 
dedicate their craft to represent the in-
terests of our constituents. 
When it became clear that the ad-
ministration was failing in Afghani-
stan, congressional staffers from across 
Capitol Hill—from both parties in 
Washington and in State offices and 
district offices around the country— 
rose to the challenge. These staffers 
helped with a modern-day ‘‘Digital 
Dunkirk.’’ They were united in the 
common cause of helping stranded 
Americans and Afghan allies. Many of 
them sprung to action instinctively 
and in an instant, almost as if they had 
been on call, like a doctor or a fire-
fighter, immediately ready to help 
mitigate the damage of this disaster. 
Some of those who did this work 
serve on my staff: Bobby Zarate, my 
national security advisor, spent count-
less hours engaging with counterparts 
in the State Department, commu-
nicating with Active-Duty military 
and veterans, including some on the 
ground in Afghanistan, and, of course, 
fielding requests from all corners to ex-
pedite cases of American citizens and 
allies in Afghanistan; Kevin Kim, a fel-
low in my office from the State Depart-
ment; Rachel Leong, a legislative cor-
respondent; and Bonny Warren, a case-
worker in my Cookeville office. They 
were all right there, too, every step of 
the way. 
For their work on behalf of folks in 
need, I want to thank them for all that 
they do and all they continue to do. 
I imagine many of my colleagues 
here in the Senate have similar stories, 
their own Bobbys, their own Kevins, 
and Rachels, and Bonnys helping those 
in need. And for the totality of their 
work, we, the Members of the Senate, 
owe our staff a great thanks. 
I am honored to describe the role 
that my office played and is continuing 
to play in rescuing Americans from Af-
ghanistan, but it didn’t have to be this 
way. And I hope, for the sake of our 
government and our country, that it 
will never be this way again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
MURPHY and I be allowed to complete 
our exchange before the next scheduled 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2770 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
after Joe Biden’s disastrous retreat 
from Afghanistan, the country has fall-
en to a medieval band of degenerate 
savages known as the Taliban. 
Despite its depraved behavior, you 
won’t hear anyone in our government 
call the Taliban what it is: a terrorist 
organization. 
Instead, 
Secretary 
of 
State Blinken has said, for example, 
that the Taliban ‘‘does not meet the 
test of inclusivity.’’ It is as if the Biden 
administration is more concerned that 
the Taliban is led by men than that it 
is led by terrorists. 
This administration has refused to 
declare that the Taliban is a foreign 
terrorist organization, perhaps because 
the President outsourced the security 
of American citizens to the Taliban 
last month and stood by as it took over 
a country of nearly 40 million people. 
Once again, the Biden administration 
is putting image, public relations, be-
fore everything else. It refuses to ac-
knowledge that the Afghan retreat was 
anything but an ‘‘extraordinary suc-
cess,’’ as Joe Biden has called it. And 
now it is refusing to call terrorists 
‘‘terrorists.’’ 
But the truth is obvious. If the 
Taliban isn’t a foreign terrorist organi-
zation, what is? The State Depart-
ment’s terrorism list includes groups 
like Shining Path, the Marxist-Len-
inist-Maoist guerillas in Peru, and 
Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese dooms-
day cult. 
If the State Department can go to 
the trouble of designating those groups 
as terrorist organizations, surely they 
can do the same for a band of jihadists 
whose hands are dripping with Amer-
ican blood. 
Indeed, the Taliban matches to a tee 
the definition for foreign terrorist or-
ganization under U.S. law. That law 
sets out three criteria: First, it must 
be a foreign organization. I would as-
sume the Biden administration would

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6565 
September 21, 2021 
concede even that point about the 
Taliban. Second, it must engage in ter-
rorist activity. Has the Taliban en-
gaged in terrorist activity? Countless 
victims of Taliban suicide bombings, 
targeted assassinations, IEDs, and acid 
attacks would surely answer yes to 
that question, if they survived those 
heinous crimes. 
Consider the following as well: At 
least 14 of the Taliban’s 33 so-called 
cabinet ministers are on the United 
Nations’ sanctions list for terrorism. 
No fewer than five were once held with 
terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. 
One of the most powerful factions of 
the Taliban is the murderous Haqqani 
Network—a 
twisted 
clan 
that 
the 
United States has already designated a 
terrorist organization under the Obama 
administration. 
The Taliban has put the leader of the 
Haqqani Network in charge of the 
country’s secret police and, yes, its im-
migration system, which is currently 
determining which persons can leave 
the country. 
Sirajuddin Haqqani is one of Amer-
ica’s most-wanted terrorists for at-
tacking the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and 
hotels full of civilians, among other 
crimes. 
It is also worth noting that the son of 
the Taliban’s leader and so-called emir 
blew himself up in a suicide attack 
against the Afghan Government in 
2017. Evidently, he thought the Taliban 
was a terrorist organization, even if 
some around Washington shrink from 
that label. 
Finally, the third criterion for a for-
eign terrorist organization is that its 
terrorism must threaten the security 
of Americans or our national security. 
With an estimated 100 Americans and 
thousands of green card holders cur-
rently trapped in Taliban-occupied Af-
ghanistan, I would say the answer to 
that question is also obvious. It would 
still be obvious even if we didn’t face 
an active hostage situation since the 
Taliban still provides safe haven to al- 
Qaida, who murdered thousands of 
Americans on September 11, 2001. 
Despite the Taliban’s empty promises 
that it would never again help al- 
Qaida, a recent United Nations report 
found that ‘‘the Taliban and al-Qaida 
remain closely aligned and show no in-
dication of breaking ties.’’ Al-Qaida 
continues to pledge allegiance to the 
Taliban, and its regional affiliate even 
operates under the Taliban banner in 
Kandahar. Now, that is a national secu-
rity threat to America, if there ever 
was one. 
So, to summarize, the Taliban is run 
by terrorists, it associates with terror-
ists, and it engages in terrorism. The 
Biden administration’s refusal to call a 
spade a spade is a grave insult to the 
memory of the Taliban’s victims and 
the tens of thousands of Americans 
who fought against it. It is worth re-
membering how many American lives 
the Taliban took, how many American 
warriors they maimed, and how many 
families they have shattered. That is 
terrorism. 
So I will be asking unanimous con-
sent for my bill, which would require 
Secretary Blinken to call the Taliban 
what they are—not a potential partner 
for 
Joe 
Biden, 
not 
a 
threat 
to 
inclusivity, but a terrorist organiza-
tion. 
Therefore, Madam President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 2770, 
which is at the desk; I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, how quick-
ly my colleagues forget that it was 
President Trump who entered into ne-
gotiations with the Taliban. It was 
President Trump who entered into an 
agreement with the Taliban that com-
mitted the United States to withdraw 
our forces. It was President Trump who 
sold out women and girls in that coun-
try by refusing to put their interests 
first at that negotiating table. It was 
President Trump who elevated the 
Taliban in the international commu-
nity by putting them face-to-face with 
our negotiators. 
It is important to note, as to the spe-
cific request that is being made by the 
Senator from Arkansas, that right 
now, the Taliban is already designated 
as a designated global terrorist entity 
under Executive Order 13224. So they 
are already designated as a terrorist 
entity. 
There are specific problems with this 
designation. First, I don’t think it is a 
great idea for us to be designating 
FTOs by statute. There is a reason why 
we generally allow the administration 
to do this. But maybe more impor-
tantly, what comes with an FTO is the 
withdrawal of humanitarian organiza-
tions from the country at hand. We 
know that because we saw it in Yemen. 
When President Trump designated the 
Houthis as an FTO for about a week, 
humanitarian 
organizations 
started 
pulling up their stakes. Right now, 
there are 18 million Afghans who are in 
need of lifesaving humanitarian assist-
ance. This is not the moment to take a 
step that will cause Afghans to starve. 
The second reason not to do this this 
way is because, whether we like it or 
not, we are in communication through 
intermediaries with the Taliban to get 
our people out, to get our partners out. 
There are flights leaving on a regular 
basis. And to designate them as an 
FTO, in addition to the existing des-
ignation that the Taliban has as a spe-
cially designated global terrorist enti-
ty, is to risk our ability to continue to 
bring our people out. 
We should be joined together as a 
Senate, despite the views we have on 
whether we should have stayed or left 
Afghanistan, in our support for the Af-
ghan people by making sure that we do 
not take steps to cut off humanitarian 
assistance to people in need and our be-
lief that we should be supporting this 
administration in their effort to con-
tinue to get our partners out. 
This designation done this way will 
risk both of those initiatives, and for 
that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
share my colleague’s grave concerns 
about the humanitarian disaster in Af-
ghanistan. I share his concerns about 
the fate of Americans and green card 
holders and their families and Afghans 
who fought alongside our troops who 
were also left behind in Afghanistan. 
Both of these crises—the humanitarian 
crisis and the crisis of Americans left 
behind Taliban enemy lines—are the 
responsibility of Joe Biden for his hap-
less, disorganized, chaotic execution of 
the withdrawal from that country. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Wyoming. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
growing list of disasters that is occur-
ring in this country and around the 
world as a result of the actions of 
President Biden. 
The most recent disaster is President 
Biden’s surrender of Afghanistan to 
global terrorists. For two decades, 
Americans fought and died in Afghani-
stan, and they did it to keep our coun-
try safe and free. On Thursday, August 
26, the United States lost 13 service-
members in Kabul, Afghanistan. It was 
the deadliest single day for our mili-
tary in more than a decade. One of 
those fallen heroes, 20-year-old Rylee 
McCollum, was from Wyoming. 
Despite heroic sacrifice by our serv-
icemembers, the Taliban, today, is 
stronger than ever. The Taliban con-
trols more territory than it did on Sep-
tember 11 of 2001, 20 years ago. Afghan-
istan is, once again, a safe harbor for 
terrorists. 
This disaster happened because Presi-
dent Biden paid more attention to the 
calendar on the wall than he did to the 
conditions on the ground. President 
Biden wanted symbolism. Well, we got 
symbolism. We got the symbol of ter-
rorists. It is the one they wanted. It is 
the symbol of helicopters flying, leav-
ing the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Af-
ghanistan—something that President 
Biden promised the American people 
they would never see, but there it was 
for the world to see. 
The entire world also witnessed des-
perate Afghan citizens. They were 
plummeting to their deaths as they 
tried to hang onto planes that were 
leaving from the airport. President 
Biden was so eager to pull our troops 
out of Afghanistan by an arbitrary date 
that he left hundreds, if not thousands, 
of American citizens trapped—hostages 
behind enemy lines. President Biden 
abandoned the strategically located 
Bagram Air Base. It is the one base 
that could have evacuated people safe-
ly. 
The Biden administration even gave 
the Taliban a list of American citizens. 
I mean, can you imagine that? The ad-
ministration gave the Taliban—the ter-
rorists—a list of American citizens, 
green card holders, Afghan allies, peo-
ple we wanted to get out of the coun-
try. To me and many Americans who 
heard that this happened, we saw it as 
a kill list—a list that the terrorists 
would use against American citizens 
and our allies on the ground—and we 
may never know how many are cap-
tured or tortured and are killed. 
We could have left Afghanistan with 
our honor intact. Instead, our enemies 
are now emboldened, and our friends 
are furious—furious at us. Billions and 
billions of dollars’ worth of American 
military equipment and military se-
crets are now in the hands of the 
Taliban. Joe Biden has armed the 
Taliban beyond its wildest dreams. The 
Taliban has seized more than 600,000 
American weapons. This includes over 
2,000 armored vehicles, like Humvees, 
MRAPs, and even American tanks. 
They also have at least 40 aircraft, in-
cluding Black Hawk helicopters and 
drones. The Biden administration has 
no plan either to get these weapons 
back or to destroy them where they sit 
on the ground. 
President 
Biden 
has 
surrendered 
America to the terrorists, and now I 
believe they are coming for us. 
Yet Afghanistan is just one of Presi-
dent Biden’s many failures. On issue 
after issue, this President has dis-
played complete incompetence. 
For instance, President Biden has 
displayed gross incompetence and mis-
management at our southern border. 
On President Biden’s first day in of-
fice—on the very first day—he flipped 
on a green light at the border, and he 
laid out the welcome mat. He shut 
down the construction of the border 
wall even though it had been fully paid 
for. He illegally ended the very suc-
cessful ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy, and 
he stopped all deportations. Ever since 
then—ever since that day 1 of his ad-
ministration—illegal immigration has 
been at an alltime high. 
Over the last week, we have seen 
more than 10,000 illegal immigrants 
crowding under a single bridge in Del 
Rio, TX. Since President Biden became 
President, more than a million illegal 
immigrants have crossed into our 
country. That is more than twice the 
population of Wyoming. Some of these 
illegal immigrants carry deadly dis-
ease; others carry illegal weapons. 
Since Joe Biden became President, our 
border 
agents 
have 
seized 
enough 
fentanyl—it is a deadly drug—to kill 
every American man, woman, and 
child. 
The Joe Biden border crisis is—and 
the word is important to hear here— 
‘‘unprecedented.’’ That is not my word. 
It is a direct quote from the Secretary 
of Homeland Security. Joe Biden’s Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, a few 
weeks ago, was caught on tape. He told 
our Border Patrol officers that the bor-
der situation ‘‘cannot continue.’’ 
He went on to say: 
If our border is our first line of defense, 
then we are going to lose. . . . This is 
unsustainable. 
Again, this is coming from President 
Biden’s Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
Yet Democrats in Washington want 
to double down on this open border pol-
icy. Senate Democrats have tried to 
give amnesty to over 8 million illegal 
immigrants. Now, they have failed, but 
if they had been successful, it would 
have been the largest amnesty for ille-
gal immigrants in our Nation’s history. 
Well, that sends a very loud message to 
people all around the world. It says, if 
you come here illegally, the Democrats 
are sure going to try to give you gov-
ernment benefits and maybe even citi-
zenship. This message from this White 
House 
and 
the 
Democrats 
only 
strengthens the magnet for people to 
come here illegally. 
Under President Biden, we have cho-
sen chaos on the border, and we have 
chaos also in Democratic-governed cit-
ies. Over the past year and a half, we 
have seen an unprecedented rise in 
murders, in shootings, and in violent 
crime in Democratic-run cities. Last 
year, the murder rate went up by a 
third. This year, it is up again. Nearly 
all of the increases are in cities run by 
Democrats. 
Last year, in Democratic cities, what 
did they do? Well, they cut more than 
$1 billion off the funding for our police, 
for law enforcement—for the people 
who are there to keep the cities and 
the streets safe. As a result, crime is 
out of control, and working families 
are scared. 
There is also something else that is 
worrying families all across America, 
and those are the skyrocketing costs 
they have to pay every time they fill 
up their tanks or when they go to the 
grocery stores. At a time when our 
economy should be booming, the pur-
chasing power of people’s paychecks is 
getting eaten away. Gasoline is now 
nearly a dollar more a gallon than it 
was when Joe Biden took office. Now it 
costs about $25 more to fill up your ve-
hicle. It costs about $25 more for a 
weekly trip of shopping at the grocery 
store. So $25 for gas and $25 for gro-
ceries is $50 a week. That is over $2,000 
a year in lost buying ability—lost 
power of the paycheck—for American 
families. 
Inflation is happening because of ex-
cessive 
Democratic 
borrowing 
and 
spending. Gas prices are also rising be-
cause President Biden is restricting 
American energy. He has killed thou-
sands of good energy jobs. He took an 
ax to the Keystone XL Pipeline. He 
stopped all new oil and gas leases on 
Federal land. It is no surprise to Amer-
icans that the price of energy is going 
up. 
And what is President Biden’s solu-
tion to this? Well, he wants to raise 
taxes on energy produced in America. 
He doesn’t want Americans to explore 
for energy and oil in the United States. 
No. His National Security Advisor, last 
month, actually asked foreign oil-pro-
ducing countries, including Saudi Ara-
bia and Russia—this is the National 
Security Advisor—to pump more for-
eign oil to lower the price of gas. And 
you say: How do you know that? Well, 
it was on the White House’s website, 
right there for the world to see. The

President would prefer for us to buy 
energy from our enemies rather than 
produce it here at home. 
Under the last President and the pre-
vious 
administration, 
the 
United 
States became energy dominant. Presi-
dent Biden seems very determined to 
make us energy dependent once again. 
I could go on. There are so many fail-
ures of the Biden administration to dis-
cuss. Every single one of these crises 
could have been avoided. Each one was 
predictable and could have been pre-
ventable. They could have been avoided 
with competent leadership in the White 
House. They could have been avoided if 
Democrats had stopped their mad dash 
to the left. 
The American people gave us a 50–50 
Senate. They didn’t ask for a leftwing 
agenda. No wonder recent polls show 
Americans, overwhelmingly, say the 
country is headed in the wrong direc-
tion. The American people know what 
they want: safe communities, secure 
borders, higher wages, lower prices. It 
is what I hear in Wyoming, and it is 
what I heard this past weekend. The in-
competence of this administration over 
the last 8 months cannot be allowed to 
continue. The American people deserve 
better. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs being tied on the question of re-
porting, I move to discharge the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs from further consider-
ation of the nomination of Rohit 
Chopra, of the District of Columbia, to 
be Director, Bureau of Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection for a term of five 
years. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
for the information of all Senators, we 
expect the vote on the motion to dis-
charge to occur around 5:40 p.m. 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Louisiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
SUPPLEMENTAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise, as I have before, to explain the ur-
gent need to pass a supplemental dis-
aster assistance bill. But this time it is 
not just for Hurricane Laura, which hit 
southwest Louisiana over a year ago; it 
now includes Hurricane Ida, the fifth- 
most powerful storm to hit the United 
States, which hit Southeast Louisiana 
last month. 
And here, for example, is some of the 
flooding that was related to Hurricane 
Ida. I should point out, by the way, 
that this is not considered a flood 
event. Well, if it is not considered a 
flood event, that looks like pretty bad 
flooding. This is considered a wind 
event; and so even when it is not con-
sidered a flood event, you see almost 
this entire community flooded. 
So I guess my statement, Madam 
President, 
is: 
We 
can’t 
afford—we 
should not allow the impact of an en-
tire year’s—now almost 2 years’—worth 
of natural disasters go unaddressed for 
fellow Americans. 
I mentioned it is over a year since 
Hurricane Laura wreaked havoc on 
Lake Charles. We are only a couple 
weeks shy of the 1-year anniversary of 
Hurricane Delta, a category 2 storm 
that followed on almost the exact same 
track to hit Southwest Louisiana. 
Those who were trying to recover were 
once again subjected to tremendous 
rains with flooding, and then Hurricane 
Ida. 
But before I go to Ida, let me also 
point out there were also unprece-
dented winter storms which unleashed 
catastrophic 
damage 
to 
livestock, 
crops, and buildings for Louisiana 
farmers. The same storms that got 
more publicity in Texas hit us as well, 
and then Ida and Tropical Storm Nich-
olas. 
In light of these storms, I must speak 
about the National Flood Insurance 
Program, or NFIP, which is set to roll 
out Risk Rating 2.0 on October 1, while 
many policyholders are still recovering 
from hurricane damage. 
FEMA said Risk Rating 2.0—FEMA 
said policyholders were supposed to be 
able to get the information of what 
their new premiums would be by Au-
gust 1. FEMA missed that deadline. 
They only recently made the informa-
tion available, less than 1 month of ad-
vanced notice. 
But despite the lack of transparency, 
we know Risk Rating 2.0 will increase 
costs. In Louisiana, 80 percent of pol-
icyholders will see increases in the 
first year. For some, premiums may be-
come unaffordable and could collapse 
the value of their home. 
Now, these aren’t rich people. The 
criticism of the program is that some 
rich person with a home on the beach 
gets subsidized flood insurance. That is 
not true. 
These are middle-income families 
and working families, whom the Presi-
dent, by the way, pledged not to in-
crease the cost on those earning less 
than 400,000 a year. These folks don’t 
make $400,000 a year; they make far 
less. They have a hard time paying 
their gasoline bill or their food bill, 
with the inflation we have had re-
cently, and now they are about to be 
socked with Risk Rating 2.0. 
By the way, Congress never passed a 
bill requiring that FEMA implement 
this. President Biden can stop it. He 
alone is responsible. He should ask 
FEMA to delay implementation of 
Risk Rating 2.0 or reconsider alto-
gether. At the end of the day, flood in-
surance must be affordable for the 
homeowner, accessible for the home-
owner, accountable to the taxpayer, 
and sustainable. 
I proposed with Senator MENENDEZ— 
and before Senator MENENDEZ, Senator 
GILLIBRAND—reforms 
to 
accomplish 
that. We can achieve that, but Risk 
Rating 2.0 is not the way to do so. It is 
time for Congress to conduct thorough 
oversight. 
And, of course, I represent the people 
of Louisiana, but I could speak of any 
place in the Nation which has flooded. 
Speaking for the people of Louisiana, 
but for all those fellow Americans who 
flooded, when you flood, you have been 
pounded; and my job is to help my fel-
low Americans, no matter where she or 
he lives, to get back on their feet. 
And right now I speak to the people 
of Louisiana: It is my commitment to 
you to attempt to do so. 
And we are strong. We are resilient. I 
drove through south Louisiana. There 
were people cleaning up their house by 
taking water-logged beds out, but they 
gave a thumbs-up when you went by. 
They are resilient. We are resilient 
people. 
On the other hand, when you see on a 
map of power outage and we are 4 
weeks out and there are still people 
who don’t have power back, and this is 
the United States of America? They 
don’t have homes—they don’t have 
electricity to their home. They can’t 
run their refrigerator. Their home is 
probably destroyed. It is a tough situa-
tion. 
So I ask my colleagues to pass a 
clean, separate disaster assistance bill. 
The formal request from the White 
House includes 2.3 billion for the Com-
munity Development Block Disaster 
Recovery Program; 275 million for the 
Emergency Watershed Protection Pro-
gram, 9 billion for the Wildlife and 
Hurricane Indemnity Program, 100 mil-
lion for reclamation projects to address 
western drought, and 2.6 billion for the 
Federal Highway Emergency Relief. 
This request includes initial, though 
informal, estimates of what may also 
be needed from damage inflicted by 
Hurricane Ida. Specifically, they ex-
pect the cost and needs stemming from 
Ida to likely exceed an additional $10 
billion in the form of CDBG Disaster 
Relief, Federal Highway Emergency 
Relief, Federal Transit Emergency Re-
lief, Small Business Administration 
disaster loans, and the Disaster Relief 
Fund, among other programs. 
And, of course, this is not just to ben-
efit our fellow Americans in Louisiana 
but also those in the Northeast. More 
people died in the Northeast related to 
Hurricane Ida than died in Louisiana. 
So this is not just for my State; it is

for our country—different regions, dif-
ferent neighborhoods, but all fellow 
Americans. 
So I ask that we pass this bill for the 
people of Lake Charles, pass this bill 
for the people of Terrebonne and 
Lafourche Parishes in Southeast Lou-
isiana, pass the bill for the people im-
pacted by Ida in the Northeast, and 
pass the bill for the people impacted by 
wildfires in the West. 
It is really simple. Let’s not let poli-
tics hold up a supplemental disaster re-
lief bill. Or put differently, let’s don’t 
leverage the pain of our fellow Ameri-
cans in a political game. Pass the dis-
aster relief bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TAXES 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am here 
today with a number of my colleagues 
from the Finance Committee to discuss 
in the next hour the partisan $3.5 tril-
lion reckless tax-and-spend bill that 
the Democrats are trying to cram down 
on the American people. 
The United States is experiencing un-
precedented economic pressures, in-
cluding significant inflation and record 
price increases, significant friction in 
labor 
markets, 
and 
intense 
inter-
national competition, all while the 
pandemic continues to threaten Ameri-
cans’ health and our economic recov-
ery. Yet the Democrats want to move 
forward with this reckless $3.5 trillion 
tax-and-spending spree that will stunt 
our economic recovery, further impede 
labor markets, and punish low- and 
middle-income workers with higher 
prices for everyday goods and services. 
The Democrats are currently debat-
ing just how high they want to increase 
taxes on American businesses and 
workers. House Democrats have pro-
posed to hike the corporate tax rate to 
26.5 percent from 21 percent. This 
would return our combined corporate 
tax rate, at 31 percent, to one of the 
highest among developed countries. 
Hiking the rate indisputably hits the 
middle class. Estimates suggest that 
workers shoulder up to 70 percent of 
the burden of the corporate tax. A re-
cent analysis performed by the non-
partisan Joint Committee on Taxation 
says the burden on over 98 percent of 
Americans who make less than $500,000 
a year increases over time. 
Let me make that clear. Ninety-eight 
percent of the increase that is felt by 
labor falls on those making less than 
$500,000 per year and the vast majority 
of that on those making less than 
$400,000 per year. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
argue 
that these increases do not violate 
President Biden’s pledge since they are 
not specific higher individual tax rates. 
But hard-working Americans do not 
care about the distinction between a 
direct or indirect tax; they care about 
how taxes hit their pocketbooks. A 
higher corporate tax rate would result 
in lower wages and reduced benefits, 
hit the nest eggs of everyone saving for 
retirement, and force consumers to pay 
more for everyday necessities. 
This plan would also impose hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes 
on U.S. businesses operating across the 
globe, overwhelmingly rewarding our 
foreign competitors and making the 
United States again one of the highest 
taxing 
countries 
in 
the 
developed 
world. These pro-China tax hikes would 
raise the relative cost of doing business 
in America and punish businesses sell-
ing products or services overseas, re-
igniting inversions and foreign acquisi-
tions, again putting America’s business 
climate back into trouble. 
Democrats also want to increase the 
top individual tax rate to 39.6 percent 
from 37 percent—a rate that kicks in at 
$400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for 
married couples. This includes a super-
charged marriage penalty, as unmar-
ried couples can earn almost a million 
dollars a year without being subject to 
increased taxes. 
Democrats have also proposed in-
creasing the number of Americans sub-
ject to the original death tax, includ-
ing farmers and small business owners. 
Others are pushing for a double death 
tax by eliminating the step-up in the 
basis entirely. Rather than be given 
time to grieve their loss, families could 
be forced to sell farms, businesses, and 
homes just to pay Uncle Sam. 
Less noticed are some of the plans to 
drastically expand the powers of the 
Internal Revenue Service and turn 
banks and credit unions into private 
investigators for monitoring law-abid-
ing Americans. This financial dragnet 
will force financial institutions into re-
porting deposit and withdrawal flows 
on as little as $600 in their customers’ 
accounts, exposing sensitive data to fu-
ture breaches. Whether the cutoff for 
monitoring transactions is $600 or 
$10,000, Americans of all income levels 
would have their private financial ac-
tivities reported to the leaky IRS. The 
threats to privacy and invasion of com-
pliant taxpayers’ personal financial af-
fairs are staggering. 
Moving on, the Democrats are also 
proposing sweeping government price 
controls on the very innovators in our 
healthcare system who helped to battle 
the pandemic by developing lifesaving 
vaccines and therapeutics. Under the 
guise of negotiation, government bu-
reaucrats would have the power to set 
prices for medications, devaluing the 
lives of the most vulnerable among us, 
including older Americans and those 
with disabilities. Their proposals could 
prevent scores of game-changing pre-
scription drugs from coming to the 
market in the years to come—with one 
recent study projecting as many as 342 
fewer new medication approvals in the 
next two decades—in addition to driv-
ing up the launch prices for new prod-
ucts. 
This even went too far for some of 
the House Democrats, with three Mem-
bers at least voting against this legis-
lation in committee. 
As I have indicated, this reckless tax- 
and-spend plan comes just over a year 
after we were experiencing one of the 
most prosperous economies in decades. 
Before the pandemic, a combination of 
reduced regulatory burden and pro- 
growth tax policies helped to create 
one of the strongest economies in our 
lifetime. All in the period of a short 
few years, we have seen that evaporate. 
We should be focused on policies that 
will get us past this pandemic and back 
to the strong and inclusive economic 
growth we were experiencing rather 
than taking advantage of a prolonged 
pandemic to reimagine America as a 
welfare state. 
This is the wrong time to raise taxes. 
Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Presi-
dent. Excuse me. I didn’t notice that I 
have been joined by the Senator from 
Nebraska. 
I will now yield more of my time to 
the Senator from Nebraska. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I know 
that Senator GRASSLEY is going to join 
us momentarily, so I will cut in line 
until he arrives. But I would like to 
thank Senator CRAPO for his leadership 
in organizing this. 
It is a little odd to be doing this on 
the Senate floor when we should be 
having markups and hearings in the 
Senate Finance Committee, but the 
Senate Finance Committee has not 
been considering any of this proposed 
legislation despite the fact that we are 
dealing with New Deal-size and -level 
legislation. Yet the Finance Com-
mittee is not considering it, so I thank 
Ranking Member CRAPO for bringing us 
to the floor. 
I want to talk about some of these 
taxing and spending issues, but I want 
to make it clear that I am not here to 
talk about this because I am obsessed 
about the marginal tax rates for the 
top 1 percent of Americans. I am not. It 
is not why I ran for office. But I am 
here today to talk about this because, 
as a China hawk, I am obsessed with 
the fact that the American people, the 
American Government, American tech-
nology companies and lots of compa-
nies that aren’t today thought of as 
technology companies but will increas-
ingly be technology companies oper-
ating in different verticals—I am ob-
sessed with the fact that our firms and 
our people are going to need to be able 
to compete with the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
The future of everything, from tech-
nology to trade, to global security and 
defense issues, is going to go one of two 
ways: It is either going to be led by the 
Chinese Communist Party or it is 
going to be led by the United States

September 21, 2021 
and our allies and Western values. The 
future of not just global economics but 
global security policy over the next 3 
and 5 and 7 and 10 years is going to be 
radically shaped by which direction we 
go. 
Failure is not an option. This next 
century is going to be defined either by 
oppression, censorship, and brutality— 
the sorts of things that we are seeing 
in Xinjiang right now as the Uighurs 
are brutally oppressed by the Chinese 
Communist Party—or we are going to 
see a world that is led by Western val-
ues and beliefs in trade and human 
rights and open navigation of the sea-
ways and transparent contracts and 
the rule of law. 
That is the proper context in which 
we should be considering this taxing- 
and-spending debate, and it would be 
helpful for the American people if we 
would discuss President Biden’s tax- 
and-spending spree in the context of 
that global technology and diplomatic 
competition with the CCP because 
these dangerous policies in this $3.5 
trillion or whatever pricetag it is going 
to end up at—this piece of omnibus leg-
islation is going to hurt our ability to 
compete against Beijing. 
Spending is out of control. The 
American people, last November, just 
10 months ago, elected an evenly di-
vided Senate. Yet somehow progres-
sives believe they have a mandate to 
radically remake America. You actu-
ally hear a lot of them use language 
about radically transforming America, 
as if an American public that voted for 
a 50–50 Senate was voting for some sort 
of radical remaking of American policy 
as a newer-new, bigger-big New Deal. 
They have spent trillions of dollars 
that we don’t have already this year, 
and now they are looking to add an-
other $3.5 trillion to expand cradle-to- 
grave government propositions about 
how government should interfere and 
interact with the average American’s 
life. 
Well, what is government? What a 
government is supposed to be is a com-
pact for the common defense. The first 
and most fundamental principle that 
government exists to do is make sure 
that everyone is free from violence and 
chaos and tyranny so that they can or-
ganize their lives and local commu-
nities. That is the first thing govern-
ment is supposed to be. Yet we also be-
lieve that government has some social 
safety net responsibilities. 
Stated in a summary fashion, you 
might say that the government is sup-
posed to be the army and we also have 
some social safety net insurance pro-
grams attached to them. It seems like, 
when you listen to Senator SANDERS 
speak, he thinks of it exactly the oppo-
site: The government is a giant insur-
ance company that just happens to own 
a navy. And sometimes it sounds like 
he doesn’t even really care if we own a 
navy; he just conceives of the govern-
ment as a giant insurance program 
where everything is compulsory and 
government decides what programs 
people need to have and what services 
they want. The vast majority of the 
American people don’t want that and 
they didn’t vote for that, and a 50–50 
Senate shouldn’t be trying to deliver 
that. 
This year, the President and my 
Democratic colleagues have increased 
spending in every area—social, envi-
ronmental, and economic policy-re-
lated. If there was an opportunity to 
spend over the course of the last 81⁄2 
months, they have taken it. A couple 
trillion here, a couple trillion there, 
and pretty soon, you are talking about 
real money. 
Now it is time to pay the piper, and 
my colleagues are talking about rais-
ing taxes. But this isn’t just any tax 
hike we are talking about. When you 
look at the corporate rates that we are 
looking at, we would be talking about 
the highest corporate tax rate in the 
industrialized world. These are just the 
new taxes. Yet even that doesn’t pay 
for all of the new spending. So we are 
talking about new legislation that 
would radically raise taxes to the high-
est corporate tax rates in the indus-
trial Earth and yet still not pay for all 
of the new spending they are talking 
about. When deficits grow forever, op-
portunities shrink. 
We have a Member of the House of 
Representatives who, in her supertele-
genic way, figured out how to get at-
tention last week by wearing a dress 
that said ‘‘Tax the Rich’’ on the back 
of it. What the dress should really read 
is ‘‘Tax the Young’’ because history 
tells us very clearly that when you def-
icit-spend at the level they are talking 
about doing here, this is a tax of cur-
rent older and wealthier people against 
younger people. That is how inflation 
works. That is how debt and deficit 
work. The dress should have read ‘‘Tax 
the Young.’’ 
These are tax hikes that make com-
munist China a much better business 
environment than the United States. 
Under the President’s plan, Americans 
would have a 32-percent combined rate, 
compared to a much smaller Chinese 
tax rate, at their baseline nominal 
level. But it is important to recognize 
that the Chinese tax code currently 
incentivizes high-tech businesses with 
an even lower 15-percent rate. So we 
are talking about north of a 30-percent 
rate against the Chinese Communist 
Party trying to make sure they attract 
investment by taxing their technology 
and digital companies at a 15-percent 
rate. This is the definition of shooting 
yourself in the foot. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle are a lot of smart folks, and they 
know that tax rates actually matter 
for international investment and for 
competitiveness. One of the ways you 
know 
they 
know 
is 
because, 
for 
months, 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Janet 
Yellen has been out seeking a global 
minimum tax arrangement. She is ad-
mitting the obvious truth—that a new 
tax increase will saddle American 
firms with a burden that other compa-
nies across the globe don’t have. 
The CCP is not going to bail us out, 
as we would potentially raise taxes to 
the highest rates in the world, by also 
raising their tax rates to bail out 
President Biden’s domestic agenda. 
Beijing looks at our endless debt, at 
our entitlement crisis, at our tax 
hikes, at our disunity, and they see a 
strategic advantage. 
These China-friendly tax hikes would 
raise the cost of doing business in 
America. 
These 
China-friendly 
tax 
hikes would drive innovation overseas. 
These China-friendly tax hikes would 
lead to more corporate inversions. 
These China-friendly tax hikes will 
hurt American R&D. 
If you want the 21st century to be de-
fined by global Chinese Communist 
Party leadership, you would tax and 
spend just like this legislation seeks to 
do. Reckless spending doesn’t steward 
a great nation. Super tax hikes do not 
promote innovation. 
Competition with the Chinese Com-
munist Party is the defining national 
security issue of our time, whether my 
colleagues in this body want to admit 
it on a regular basis or not. While the 
Chinese Communist Party plunders 
American intellectual property, steals 
American ingenuity, and pours invest-
ments 
into 
their 
state-run 
tech-
nologies, 
Washington 
is 
debating 
whether or not we should punish inno-
vative firms and innovative Americans. 
This isn’t strong. This isn’t smart. 
And the American people know better. 
I yield the floor to Senator GRASS-
LEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
2017, Republicans reformed the Tax 
Code in a traditional sense. We broad-
ened the tax base by reducing tax pref-
erences for special interests in favor of 
lower overall tax rates. 
We also had several other goals, in-
cluding maintaining the progressivity 
of the Tax Code, cutting taxes across 
all income groups—predominantly for 
the middle class—and making our busi-
ness tax system globally competitive. 
We were able to accomplish each of 
these goals in that 2017 tax bill. 
On average, taxpayers across all lev-
els saw a tax cut. Middle-income tax-
payers saw the largest percentage de-
crease in their tax bills. Also, we not 
only maintained the progressivity of 
our Tax Code, we made it more pro-
gressive. 
Moreover, the bill brought our busi-
ness tax system and rates in line with 
the rest of the world. You just heard 
Senator SASSE speak brilliantly about 
that point. It put an end to the prac-
tice of corporations moving head-
quarters offshore to avoid paying the 
highest tax rate in the developed 
world. 
In the process, it incentivized Amer-
ican businesses to invest here at home 
and made America a more attractive 
place for foreign companies to locate. 
Now, prepandemic, these reforms re-
sulted in the highest economic growth,

September 21, 2021 
the lowest unemployment, and the big-
gest wage gains that we had seen in 
decades. So when you talk about what 
the Democrats are proposing through 
reconciliation, it is kind of like they 
are ready to kill the goose that laid the 
golden egg. 
Now we are post-COVID. Democrats 
assert a massive expansion of govern-
ment is necessary to, in their words, 
build back better. But that is exactly 
backwards. America will build back 
better post-pandemic, but it won’t be 
because of the government. In fact, it 
is already happening due to the perse-
verance of the American people and the 
ingenuity 
of 
the 
American 
entre-
preneurs and job creators. 
Unfortunately, the tax bill unveiled 
by Ways and Means last week will only 
hinder our path back to the prosperity 
that we had prior to February 2020. 
Their bill is the exact opposite of tax 
reform. It would raise marginal tax 
rates on individuals and small busi-
nesses to a level not seen since before 
the 1986 tax act. 
Moreover, our corporate tax rate 
would once again be the highest among 
our major trading partners. These tax 
hikes will slow our recovery from the 
pandemic, and it will reduce capital in-
vestment; and it takes capital invest-
ment to create jobs. So it will result in 
fewer jobs, and it is also going to result 
in reduced wages beyond the reduced 
wages that is already happening be-
cause inflation is heating up. It will re-
invigorate corporate inversions with 
major companies fleeing overseas. 
In conjunction with raising tax rates, 
they narrow the tax rate base in favor 
of social and corporate welfare hand-
outs. Now, I say handouts because the 
majority of their bill’s $1.2 trillion in 
tax cuts aren’t reductions but turn out 
to be pure spending. 
According to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, $689 billion—or 57 percent— 
of their so-called tax cuts are actually 
outlays. That is a fancy way of saying 
Treasury is going to write the indi-
vidual or businesses a check that may 
exceed their taxes that they had other-
wise paid. 
This is turning our tax laws and the 
mission of the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice on its head. No longer would the 
Tax Code primarily be raising revenue 
necessary to fund essential govern-
ments. In fact, it would be about doling 
out cash to those that Democrats con-
sider worthy. 
Given 
their 
rhetoric, you might 
think that these types of cash pay-
ments would be reserved for low- to 
moderate-income individuals and fami-
lies. But, even very wealthy individuals 
buying electric cars, millionaires in-
vesting in green energy projects, and 
multibillion-dollar corporations will be 
in line for Federal checks. 
This is astonishing coming from a 
party claiming to be outraged by 
wealthy individuals and profitable cor-
porations paying zero tax. As recently 
as March of this year, President Biden 
castigated Amazon for not paying ‘‘a 
single solitary penny in federal income 
tax[es].’’ If he finds that unacceptable, 
then he should be beside himself about 
this Democrat tax proposal. 
Under their tax bills, a company such 
as Amazon would have an effective tax 
rate of not just zero, but negative. In 
other words, favored companies could 
receive a check from the government 
in excess of any income taxes owed. 
Meanwhile, disfavored groups would be 
left to pick up the tab. This includes 
Iowa family farmers, who could see 
their years of hard work taxed away as 
a result of the death tax exemption 
being slashed in half. 
What I have outlined here is a small 
sample of concerns that I have with the 
House proposal. Their bill is so chock- 
full 
of 
tax 
giveaways, 
counter-
productive tax policies, and punitive 
tax hikes that one former Democrat 
Senate staffer is quoted in the publica-
tion of POLITICO calling the House ap-
proach—in 
that 
person’s 
words— 
‘‘laughable.’’ 
I hope my Senate colleagues do bet-
ter. It will be hard for them to do any 
worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, in 2017, 
my colleague Senator SANDERS said: 
The function of reconciliation is to adjust 
federal spending and revenue, not to enact 
major changes in social policy. 
Now, fast forward to 2021, and Sen-
ator SANDERS and many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues have changed their 
tune. You see, Democrats in Congress 
are doubling down on their efforts to 
steer America toward the Democratic 
socialist policies laid out in Senator 
SANDERS’ budget with a $3.5 trillion 
spending plan that would be the most 
significant expansion of our social safe-
ty net programs since the 1960s. 
Democrats are seeking to enact these 
sweeping changes through reconcili-
ation—a partisan process, which Sen-
ator SANDERS himself said is not meant 
to be a vehicle for major policy 
changes. From job-killing corporate 
tax hikes to small business money 
grabs and hidden tax increases on the 
middle class, the Democrats’ plan will 
punish job creators and workers and 
make us less competitive on the global 
stage. 
Now, perhaps that is part of their 
plan—to remake the United States of 
America in the image of Western Eu-
rope. It is as if they want to punish 
businesses while rewarding unemploy-
ment and dependence on the Federal 
Government. 
Republicans want to empower Ameri-
cans to be self-sufficient, to unleash 
their God-given potential. That, after 
all, is the promise at the heart of the 
Declaration of Independence. It is that 
promise that has led generation after 
generation of people to our shores so 
that they, too, can realize the indi-
vidual liberty, the promise at the heart 
of America’s Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Republicans want to provide employ-
ment opportunities and a strong econ-
omy. We don’t want to make people be-
holden to the government for their 
livelihood. It is not healthy. That is 
not freedom. It is not American. 
As a young man, I visited the Soviet 
Union as part of a junior high school 
soccer exchange trip. I still remember 
what I saw there. Food was scarce. The 
water was, too. There were public 
water stations, where Russians drank 
from a communal cup. They were des-
perate for everyday items Americans 
take for granted: blue jeans, for exam-
ple; and chewing gum, too. For dec-
ades, Russians were denied this because 
it was a symbol of American culture. 
Now, think about that. A government 
that gives you everything can also 
take anything away, even chewing 
gum. 
Profligate 
collectivism—you 
might call it socialism—creates an en-
vironment where citizens progressively 
give up the right to decide how they 
spend their earnings, how they educate 
their children, how they get better 
when they are sick; a system where 
citizens are frozen on the lower rungs 
of the ladder of life’s opportunity, 
where upward mobility is unknown. 
That is why the Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spend proposal goes against ev-
erything we believe in this Nation. 
Among its many defects, their proposal 
picks winners and losers. It increases 
our dependence on foreign oil and al-
lows blatant double dipping. 
All of this is, of course, incredibly 
misguided and simply makes no sense 
when gas prices have jumped 40 percent 
since January, directly harming mid-
dle-income Americans who can’t afford 
a cent more. 
Punishing oil and natural gas pro-
ducers while propping up renewables— 
many of which have materials directly 
sourced from communist China—will 
have disastrous, wide-reaching effects. 
A 100-percent renewable energy-sup-
ported grid will result in blackouts and 
will make power delivery less reliable 
for millions of families, not to mention 
the job losses for the 10 million Ameri-
cans employed by these industries. 
Democrats are also proposing sweep-
ing changes to Medicare. This is a pro-
gram that is incredibly popular among 
our senior citizens, and it is already on 
shaky financial ground. It is projected 
to reach insolvency within the next 4 
years, prior to any changes by the 
Democrats that will undermine it. But 
Democrats are determined to add bene-
fits that private plans already cover 
more efficiently. Adding hearing, vi-
sion, and dental under traditional 
Medicare is duplicative of the coverage 
provided through Medicare Advantage. 
Seniors enjoy their high-performing 
Medicare plans, which come at little to 
no additional cost. Expanding Medicare 
is unnecessary, duplicative, and will 
come with higher costs, less access, 
and harm the quality of care providers 
are able to provide. 
These are just a couple of examples, 
but the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-

spend proposal would have harmful 
consequences across the board for our 
country and the freedoms we enjoy. 
Americans 
should 
be 
outraged—I 
know Hoosiers are—not only by this 
radical expansion of government but by 
the process Democrats are using to 
ram through their liberal agenda, pos-
sibly ramming it through a 50–50 Re-
publican-Democrat 
equally 
divided 
U.S. Senate. 
Now, Republicans have stood up to 
socialism again and again. And we 
must continue to do so by opposing 
this reckless tax-and-spending boon-
doggle. We must protect the American 
promise and ensure that this remains 
the land of the free. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I join 
my colleagues today in speaking out 
against the Democrats’ very reckless 
$3.5 trillion—that is with a ‘‘t’’—tax- 
and-spending spree that CHUCK SCHU-
MER
and NANCY
PELOSI
are rushing 
through Congress. They are going to 
make history if they get this passed. 
This will be the largest spending bill in 
our Nation’s history. Let me say that 
again. This will be the largest spending 
bill in our Nation’s history. 
Through 
this 
bill, 
Congressional 
Democrats are trying to reshape the 
very foundation of our great Nation. 
They are trying to pass their far-left 
policies and push the United States of 
America down the path of socialism. I 
don’t say that lightly. I don’t like to 
use a lot of hyperbole, but that is what 
is going on. 
This reckless tax-and-spending spree 
bill is packed full of tax increases and 
new spending programs that will kill 
hundreds of thousands of jobs; it will 
reduce economic growth; and it is 
throwing more fuel on the inflation fire 
that we see burning right now across 
this economy. In fact, according to the 
Tax Foundation, it would reduce take- 
home pay for low- and middle-income 
Americans. 
It will expand and insert the Federal 
Government into every aspect of Mon-
tanans’ and Americans’ lives, and it is 
going to bankrupt our country. You 
know, I am not actually sure the con-
gressional Democrats understand the 
impacts of their efforts and what a bur-
den this tax and spending will put on 
Montana families, Montana small busi-
nesses, Montana farmers and ranchers, 
and the future generations of Mon-
tanans. 
In fact, a few weeks ago, I heard one 
House Democrat actually say: 
We can’t go bankrupt because we have the 
power to create as much money as we need 
to spend. 
These are the actual words of a Dem-
ocrat in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives who will soon be voting on this 
legislation. 
It is baffling. Montanans and the 
American people know that money 
doesn’t grow on trees, and I would hope 
the 
congressional 
Democrats 
know 
that as well. 
Frankly, this mindset is terrifying as 
I think about the future of our coun-
try. The Democrats’ reckless spending 
bill comes at a time when Montanans 
are already facing skyrocketing prices 
on everything from gas to groceries. 
Montanans are feeling the pain in their 
pocketbooks every day because of these 
record-high inflation numbers. That is 
a direct result of the Democrats’ and 
President 
Biden’s 
tax-and-spending 
problem. You see, the Democrats al-
ready flooded the economy with nearly 
$2 trillion in new spending earlier this 
year on a purely partisan basis, and 
now we see inflation at a 13-year high. 
Think about it. Even if we experience 
no—in other words, zero additional rise 
in inflation for the rest of the year, 
Montanans would still be hit with an 
almost 5-percent increase in costs for 
the year. 
It is interesting. A few months ago, 
we heard the words: Well, this is all 
transitory. It is all transitory. This is 
going to go away in a few months. 
Many of us were skeptical and didn’t 
believe it. You are not hearing the 
word ‘‘transitory’’ anymore coming 
from the Democrats because if we take 
a look at the position the Federal Re-
serve has been talking about, they are 
telling us inflation is here to stay at 
north of 5 percent, certainly, this year 
and at numbers certainly greater than 
that ‘‘2 percent threshold’’ that was 
talked about—probably in the 4 percent 
to 5 percent in the outyears. 
If you spend any time at all speaking 
to leaders in this country, where they 
are every day looking at the supply 
chain price of goods, they are telling 
you there are inflationary pressures in 
every part of this economy. The abso-
lute last thing we should be doing is 
spending trillions more taxpayer dol-
lars on top of that $2 trillion partisan 
spending package the Democrats em-
barked on just this past March. 
We know that doing so will send in-
flation much, much higher. You see, in-
flation is a tax on all Montanans, on 
all Americans because as prices go up, 
paychecks shrink. And Democrats have 
many more tax hikes planned as they 
look to pay for this spending spree by 
asking 
Montana 
families, 
Montana 
small businesses, our farmers and 
ranchers to foot the bill. 
Now, I have heard my Democratic 
colleagues suggest this bill must be 
‘‘paid for.’’ But what does ‘‘paid for’’ 
mean? What does that mean? It is very 
simple. It means that Democrats’ reck-
less taxing and spending spree will be 
paid for by massive tax increases. 
Let’s go over a few of these tax hikes 
that Montanans will face if Democrats 
continue down this reckless path. For 
starters, this bill is absolutely an as-
sault on small businesses. By the way, 
small businesses create most of the 
jobs in this economy. It would gut the 
20-percent small business tax deduc-
tion, placing small businesses at a dis-
advantage. This deduction benefited 
more than 21 million small businesses 
in 2019, and it generated $66 billion in 
tax savings that these businesses could 
then reinvest and grow their business, 
create more jobs, pay their employees 
more. 
These savings help small businesses 
expand, allows them to compete in this 
global market, to offer raises as well as 
bonuses. Removing this tax benefit 
would make it harder—make it hard-
er—for them to expand and succeed 
against larger competitors. 
The Democrats’ reckless tax-and- 
spending spree bill would also increase 
the top income tax rate to nearly 40 
percent and drastically lower the in-
come thresholds for the top tax brack-
et. 
Some ask: What is fair? What is fair 
share? Paying 40 percent of your in-
come to the Federal Government is 
where the Democrats want to take the 
top rate. Since most small businesses 
are structured in what is known as a 
passthrough, meaning business profits 
are taxed as income, this tax hike 
would devastate our small business 
owners. In fact, these two provisions 
alone would hurt Montana’s small busi-
nesses drastically. 
Over 99 percent—listen to this again. 
Over 99 percent of Montana businesses 
are small businesses. We can’t let this 
happen. This would destroy livelihoods, 
harm local communities and local 
economies. In fact, the combined tax 
rate for passthrough businesses would 
rise above 50 percent in 40 out of 50 
States, including the State of Mon-
tana. 
This reckless spending bill will also 
supercharge marriage penalties in the 
Tax Code. You heard that right. You 
see, buried in the Democrats’ massive 
tax-and-spending spree is also an at-
tack on marriage. Married couples 
could be facing higher taxes simply be-
cause they are married. 
Democrats have also proposed the 
elimination of what is known as 
stepped-up basis. This is a backdoor 
death tax that will hit Montana family 
farms and ranchers particularly hard. 
You see, in Montana, agriculture is our 
way of life. Our farmers and our ranch-
ers work hard to put food on the table 
for their families, for our great State, 
for the country, and the entire world. 
The last thing that Montana farmers 
and ranchers need are more taxes, and 
that is what the Democrats are trying 
to do. 
In fact, Senator THUNE and I led a 
letter to President Biden, which was 
signed by every Member of the Repub-
lican conference, urging the President 
to reconsider this proposal. As of now, 
this is not currently in the House 
Democrats’ bill. But, unfortunately, 
the President and many of my col-
leagues here in this Chamber, on the 
other side of the aisle, continue to in-
sist that this be included in their bill. 
This reckless proposal will also dam-
age our international competitiveness. 
This is about a global economy. This is 
about winning the global race because 
they want to raise the corporate tax 
rate to 26.5 percent. If you combine

that with State corporate tax rates, 
the 
average 
corporate 
tax 
burden 
would rise to about 31 percent. And 
there is a startling piece of informa-
tion here. You take 31 percent and 
guess what. That rate would be higher 
than communist China. In fact, it 
would be one of the highest corporate 
tax rates in the entire world. 
The Democrats don’t understand why 
jobs leave our shores. I will tell you 
one reason why is because of tax pol-
icy. When you raise the rates higher 
than communist China, it is going to 
have a direct effect on jobs here in the 
United States. 
Do you know who is cheering about 
this tax increase in this provision? I 
will tell you who is cheering about it. 
China is. They know the Democrats’ 
tax increase will force American busi-
nesses to send American jobs overseas. 
That is the last thing we need because 
we need to be supporting American 
businesses, supporting the American 
worker, the American family, the 
American farmer, the American ranch-
er and the hard work they do every 
day. 
Sadly, the Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spending spree does exactly the op-
posite. Sadly, it will put China and our 
global competitors first. 
For all these reasons and many more, 
I am very concerned about what will 
happen if this dangerous proposal be-
comes law. I intend to fight vigorously, 
along with many of my colleagues 
here, against it every step of the way. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from Montana 
who just talked about the impact of 
this tax-and-spend bill on his constitu-
ents in Montana. I will say the same is 
true in 49 other States, including my 
State of Ohio. 
This is, we are told, the biggest tax 
increase on America in over 50 years. 
So this is a big deal. In terms of the 
spending we have been hearing today, 
it is the largest spending package ever. 
In inflation-adjusted terms, it is prob-
ably the largest social spending pack-
age since the New Deal. That is what 
we are talking about here. This would 
fundamentally change our country in 
so many ways. 
It is good that MIKE CRAPO, who is 
the top Republican on the Finance 
Committee, asked us to come on the 
floor today just to kind of talk about it 
because our constituents need to know 
what is going on. They need to under-
stand what the impact would be on 
them, their lives, their futures. 
There are new taxes being proposed 
in this on pretty much everything— 
small businesses. That was just talked 
about. Most businesses in Ohio and 
around the country are not what they 
call 
C 
corporations. 
They 
are 
passthroughs, like subchapter S—sole 
proprietors, 
partnerships. 
That 
is 
about 80 percent, 90 percent of the busi-
nesses. It is the smaller businesses. 
They get hit. 
There are actually taxes on marriage 
because of the marriage penalty. 
There are taxes on death because of 
the increase in the estate and gift tax. 
There are taxes on capital gains, which 
that is the part of our Code where you 
try to give people a little lower rate on 
longer term investment, try to encour-
age risk-taking and investments so 
that you can grow the economy, create 
jobs. 
There are also a bunch of other taxes 
in here. 
But the one that I want to talk about 
today is the tax on corporations be-
cause it gets less attention. People 
think: Gosh, they are big corporations. 
They can handle more tax increases. 
Some of them aren’t paying taxes. 
Well, they use the Tax Code some-
times that we set up here to avoid pay-
ing the full amount of taxes, but they 
pay plenty of taxes. When you increase 
the taxes, everyone says the same 
thing—whether it is the Congressional 
Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan 
group up here in the U.S. Senate, or 
whether it is the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, which is a nonpartisan group 
up here in the U.S. Senate or House, or 
outside groups looking at it—you in-
crease those taxes on these companies, 
who pays it? Workers, primarily, and, 
second, consumers. 
We just talked about inflation. Think 
about it. All this new stimulus spend-
ing—because that is what it is—will 
add to inflation. But so will these high-
er taxes because part of what happens 
is, if you have a higher tax on you, and 
you are trying to sell something, you 
have the same costs—maybe even high-
er costs coming in—you are going to 
charge more. Therefore, when you go 
to the store to buy something, there is 
going to be more inflation. 
All of this encourages more, not less, 
inflation at a time when inflation is al-
ready unacceptably high. I think ev-
erybody agrees with that. 
When the Democrats did the $1.9 tril-
lion package back in March—$1.9 tril-
lion, that used to be a lot of money— 
we just sort of say ‘‘$1.9 trillion.’’ But 
when they did that, everybody said: Oh 
my gosh, that is too much stimulus 
spending. It is going to cause inflation. 
The promoters of that said: No, it 
won’t. It won’t do that because the 
economy is so weak. It will be good for 
the economy. 
Well, it overheated the economy. And 
Larry Summers at the time, who was 
the former Secretary of the Treasury 
in a Democratic administration and 
economist on the other side of the 
aisle—he warned about it as did others. 
He said: Look, this is going to fuel in-
flation. 
Boy, has it. 
So, yes, people are getting some wage 
gains right now, higher pay. I like that 
a lot. I think it is great. Before 2019— 
before COVID hit—thanks to the tax 
reforms of 2017, primarily, in my view, 
wages were going up. February of 2020 
was the 19th straight month of wage 
gains over 3 percent annually. My gosh, 
that was great—mostly lower and mid-
dle-income earners, by the way. 
Some of that is happening now, but it 
is all being eaten up. If you have a 5- 
percent pay wage raise this year, you 
probably got nothing because you are 
going to have about 5 percent inflation. 
Your dollar is not going as far. So 
these are all issues that we have got to 
make sure the American people under-
stand. 
In terms of the corporations and 
what the problem is there, remember 
that before the tax reform in 2017, we 
had a lot of companies that were leav-
ing our shores—literally. They were 
saying: Do you know what? Our Tax 
Code is so bad in America that we are 
going to invert—that is the name the 
economists 
gave 
it—literally 
move 
their headquarters overseas to escape 
our uncompetitive Tax Code. 
I hated that, and I hope all Ameri-
cans did. I hope all Members of the 
Senate did. I think they did. They said: 
Why would we want to encourage com-
panies to go overseas? That way, their 
investments and their jobs are tending 
to go overseas as well. 
But it wasn’t just that. We had a lot 
of companies in the United States 
being bought by foreign companies. If 
you think about it, that made all the 
sense in the world. The foreign govern-
ments had a much better Tax Code for 
them, so they could buy a U.S. com-
pany and make more money on it than 
a U.S. company could under our Tax 
Code. Again, it is not what we wanted. 
We had a situation where the compa-
nies were going overseas in every sec-
tor of our economy. I am a beer drink-
er, so I was particularly concerned 
about the beer companies, and every 
single one of them went foreign. They 
were big. The largest U.S. beer com-
pany was Sam Adams, which had about 
a 1.4-percent market share. The rest of 
them all went overseas. So that is what 
was happening. 
There is some new data out showing 
that since the 2017 tax reforms were 
put in place, there was a 50-percent in-
crease in American companies buying 
foreign companies and a 25-percent de-
crease in foreign companies buying our 
companies. That was good. That was 
good. But now we are talking about 
going right back to the bad old days. 
One significant factor in companies 
going overseas and U.S. companies get-
ting bought out by foreigners was our 
high tax rate of 35 percent—the highest 
in the developed world. Everyone heard 
about that. But, also, there was a lack 
of enticements to keep valuable intel-
lectual property here in the United 
States; whereas, other countries pro-
vided that. Also, unlike other coun-
tries, we were in what was called a 
worldwide tax system, where we were 
requiring U.S. companies to pay taxes 
on their foreign earnings at the high 
U.S. rate, the 35-percent rate. Almost 
all of our competitors don’t do that. 
They use the so-called territorial sys-
tem, where you only tax in the foreign 
jurisdiction where you did the busi-
ness. You are not taxed twice. That is

one reason we were losing, so we 
changed that. 
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took 
bold steps to reassert our competitive-
ness as a country. We lowered the cor-
porate tax rate to 21 percent. We went 
to a territorial-type system—not en-
tirely territorial, as we still had a min-
imum tax, but we created an incentive 
to stay here. We created jobs and in-
vestments here. We lowered the cor-
porate rate, but we also had other in-
centives to create more intellectual 
property here in America. 
As a result, by the way, the corporate 
inversions stopped. They stopped. In-
stead of losing companies overseas, 
again, we started to buy more compa-
nies overseas and bring that invest-
ment to America. 
The foreign-derived intangible in-
come provision, which provided a re-
duced tax rate for U.S.-based busi-
nesses on high-return foreign market 
income served by U.S. operations, re-
sulted 
in 
companies 
like 
Cisco, 
Qualcomm, 
Synopsys, 
Google, 
Facebook, and others bringing back in-
tellectual property that was overseas. 
So it actually worked in the way we 
had hoped it would. It brought IP back 
here. That means jobs. That means re-
search. Others retained their intellec-
tual property here in the United 
States, like Intel and Disney and Gen-
eral Mills and others, because of these 
tax laws, because they were coming to 
us and saying: Why are we here in 
America, doing this? We should do it 
overseas based on what Congress has 
provided as a tax environment for us. 
The largest U.S. companies during 
that time period increased their do-
mestic 
research 
and 
development 
spending by 25 percent, to $707 billion. 
They increased their capital expendi-
tures by 20 percent, to $1.4 trillion. 
That is all good. Again, workers saw 
real benefits: a 50-year low in unem-
ployment; strong wage growth, par-
ticularly for low- and middle-income 
workers; the lowest poverty rate in the 
history of the country. We started to 
keep track of it back in the fifties. 
This follows an earlier study by the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
fice, or CBO, that found that 70 percent 
of the tax cuts ended up going into 
workers’ wages and benefits. So work-
ers and businesses both benefited in 
this opportunity economy. It was driv-
ing a lot of promising growth in the 
United States. 
The Democrats’ tax plan would sys-
tematically dismantle so many of 
these pro-growth tax cuts and reforms 
that Congress put in place in 2017. 
Under this new proposal, the corporate 
rate would be raised from 21 percent to 
about 28 percent. When combined with 
the average State and local corporate 
taxes in America, U.S. businesses will 
be on the hook for an average tax rate 
of about 32 percent—once again giving 
us the highest rate of taxation in the 
developed world. 
The Democrats would also increase 
the global intangible low-taxed income 
rate, called GILTI, and the base ero-
sion and anti-abuse tax rate, called the 
BEAT, which would punish U.S. compa-
nies that work to serve foreign mar-
kets. We should like that. We want 
U.S. companies to create jobs here to 
support their international sales. The 
proposal would modify this GILTI cal-
culation to a country-by-country basis, 
making it even more difficult to com-
pute and track U.S. tax liabilities for 
companies operating overseas—again, a 
disincentive that discourages invest-
ment in new and emerging markets. 
Why would we want to do that? 
Through these policies, Democrats 
would be creating a tax environment 
hostile to businesses and harmful to 
workers. 
According 
to 
the 
Inter-
national Tax Competitiveness Index, 
the Democrats’ plan would cause the 
United States to drop steeply down the 
rankings from 21st to 28th in the world 
among developed countries. It is the 
same ranking we had, by the way, be-
fore the 2017 tax reforms. 
Many businesses will make what is 
unfortunately a completely rational 
decision to move their headquarters 
again. We will see inversions again, 
taking with them thousands of good- 
paying jobs and billions of dollars in 
assets. Others that choose to stay here 
will nonetheless become prime targets 
for acquisition, as they were before, by 
businesses in other countries, like 
China, that would have a lower tax 
rate than we. 
But who ultimately bears the brunt 
of these Democratic tax hikes on busi-
nesses? Again, it is the workers. Just 
as the Congressional Budget Office 
found that 70 percent of the corporate 
tax cuts go into workers’ wages and 
benefits, the Tax Foundation found 
that 70 percent of tax increases are 
borne by workers. It is no surprise, 
then, that the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation, right here in this 
Congress, found that two-thirds of the 
Democrats’ corporate tax hike would 
fall on lower and middle-income tax-
payers. Let me repeat that. The JCT, a 
nonpartisan committee here in Con-
gress, found that two-thirds of the 
Democrats’ corporate tax hikes would 
fall on lower and middle-income tax 
taxpayers. 
By the way, that is about 100 million 
taxpayers who make less than $400,000 
a year. So much for the pledge that no 
one under $400,000 in income would pos-
sibly be affected. 
So I look at these facts, and I just 
can’t understand why we would want to 
move to this kind of a tax plan. Why 
would the American people support tax 
hikes that are going to be bad for 
workers and bad for our competitive-
ness as a country? Why are we pun-
ishing workers? They are the ones who 
get the short end of the stick here. 
Let’s focus on what works—on en-
couraging investment and growth here 
in the United States of America. That 
helps workers. Let’s not go down a 
path that will once again send U.S. 
jobs and U.S. investment overseas. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, the 
Democratic Party’s reckless $3.5 tril-
lion 
tax-and-spend 
reconciliation— 
their spending spree—will be a disaster 
for the American family. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget warns that this spree 
could increase the deficit not by $3.5 
trillion but by $5 trillion—a little bit of 
a bait and switch. Oh, it is only 3.5— 
only 3.5. It turns out the independent 
Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget says, no, more like 5.5. 
Now, today, my colleagues have shed 
light on the many costs of this eco-
nomic—I don’t know what to call it— 
potential catastrophe. Here are just a 
few in speaking from the perspective of 
my State. 
If our goal is to get back to the 
prepandemic economy, which, by the 
way, was the best economy of my life-
time—an economy in which there was 
record-low unemployment, which is to 
say 
record-high 
employment 
for 
women, African Americans, Hispanics, 
the disabled, high school dropouts; 
record-high employment for veterans, 
you name it—then this is not the way 
to go. 
By the way, the wage growth in this 
prepandemic economy was dispropor-
tionately for those in the lower quin-
tile of our Nation’s economy. So those 
who were lower waged to begin with 
were seeing the greater growth in their 
wages under the previous economy. 
Why does this matter a lot for my 
State? Louisiana is a hub of innovation 
for energy and other technologies. In-
novation creates jobs, raises wages, 
and puts food on the tables of working 
families in my State. Congress should 
encourage that. These are not the 
Ph.D.s in solar energy; these are the 
people who produce the oil and gas or 
use that oil and gas to make the plas-
tics that matter so much to a modern 
economy. 
By the way, you can’t help but notice 
the hike in the price of gasoline that 
has just occurred, and now they are 
using the term ‘‘energy poverty’’ be-
cause there is a hike in the price of 
electricity. This is hitting the families 
as a hidden tax. 
But this bill squashes that innova-
tion, and it is the new taxes and the in-
creased taxes as to how the spending 
spree is financed. 
As once said, ‘‘The power to tax is 
the power to destroy,’’ but these taxes 
are destroying the jobs and wage in-
creases that have been so important to 
these working families over the last 4 
years. 
The rhetoric, of course, is that this is 
about a few tax hikes on the wealthiest 
of 
Americans, 
but 
what 
we 
have 
learned from the Joint Committee on 
Taxation is that two-thirds of these 
tax increases will fall upon lower and 
middle-income families. 
As one example, again, House Demo-
crats propose hiking the corporate tax

rate to an uncompetitive 26.5 percent. 
The wealthy will still be wealthy. 
Studies show that when you raise cor-
porate tax rates, it translates into 
lower wages for the employees and 
lower dividends and stock escalation 
for the shareholders. OK. So that is the 
employee, the operator in the refinery 
who shows up to make sure that it runs 
safely, who goes home and helps pay 
the rent or pay off his mortgage, and it 
hurts the retiree, who is hoping that 
her stock portfolio will allow her to 
live a better life when she retires. 
It is billed as a hike to the corpora-
tions, those greedy corporations, but 
that hike is felt by the workers and the 
retirees. So when a family begins to 
figure out how to pay their higher elec-
tricity bill, how to pay their increased 
cost of gasoline with the inflation that 
has been eating up their budget—they 
have to pay more for food, and their 
children are going back to school, we 
hope, so they are buying those sup-
plies—they will not get the wage in-
crease they had previously hoped for. 
This hurts the entrepreneur who is try-
ing to start a small business, and by 
starting that small business, he em-
ploys other people. Rolling back the 
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, raising 
taxes on working families, will not 
help them. 
President Biden has proposed nearly 
doubling the capital gains tax, raising 
it to 39.5 percent. Again, who does that 
hurt? It hurts, again, the retirees who 
have been saving for their entire lives 
so that they can have good lives when 
they retire. 
The Democrats are really earning the 
title of the ‘‘tax-and-spend party’’ with 
this monstrosity. These taxes will 
stunt our economy, and the needless 
trillions in spending will skyrocket al-
ready increasing inflation, further im-
pacting working American families. 
Mark my words: This will be Presi-
dent Biden’s economic Afghanistan. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to join my colleagues 
in opposing the Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spending spree. 
The bill that we are talking about is 
the centerpiece of BERNIE SANDERS’ so-
cialist plan for America. The Demo-
crats’ plan does play favorites, how-
ever, and what they really focus on 
doing, interestingly, is hurting the 
working folks in rural America to give 
tax breaks to wealthy families in big 
cities in liberal States. 
The reason I tell you this is that this 
bill includes huge subsidies for people 
who buy and drive electric vehicles. 
You don’t see a lot of that in rural 
States with long distances between 
community to community. 
Well, the government is already giv-
ing billions of taxpayer dollars to elec-
tric vehicle manufacturers and for 
owners. Nearly 80 percent of the tax 
credits go to households making at 
least $100,000 a year. 
So what is happening now? The thing 
is, right now, the roads are being used, 
chewed up, vehicles on the road, and 
how is it paid for? Well, the highway 
trust fund. And how does that get paid 
for? People paying the gas tax. 
People who use electric vehicles do 
the same wear and tear to our high-
ways and pay nothing in terms of a use 
fee to use the highways as they do. So 
they are paying nothing in, they are 
using the services, they use the roads 
for free, and now they want subsidies. 
And that is what the Democrats are 
offering. This bill would give up to 
$12,500 to married couples to buy elec-
tric vehicles—12,500. 
What kind of income? Maybe there is 
an income limit. I mean, you don’t 
want to give it to rich people. So the 
Democrats said: OK, if you are a single 
person earning up to $400,000 a year, 
you can get a subsidy. If you are a mar-
ried couple earning up to $800,000 a 
year, you still get the subsidy because, 
boy oh boy, we are going to push those 
electric vehicles for the big cities and 
for our Democrat colleagues. 
Democrats have gone so far as to 
even want to spend $7 billion to sub-
sidize luxury electric bicycles—aston-
ishing. 
Now, 
these 
giveaways 
have 
a 
pricetag, and that is why Democrats 
want to pile enormous new taxes on 
the American people. They propose 
more than $2 trillion in additional new 
taxes. This would be the largest tax in-
crease in half a century, but it is still 
not enough to pay for all the new 
spending they want to do. 
That is why they are trying a back-
door tax increase. What the Democrats 
are proposing is putting the IRS on 
steroids—supersizing the IRS. They 
want to increase funding for the Inter-
nal Revenue Service by $80 billion. 
The IRS says: Hey, give us a lot more 
money. We can hire a lot more agents, 
and they can collect more money, even 
more than the $80 billion that you give 
us. 
So last week, Secretary of the Treas-
ury Janet Yellen said she wants to 
make banks report every transaction 
that is over $600—she didn’t just say it; 
she wrote it in a letter to the chairman 
of the House Budget Committee—so 
they can watch and look at, inves-
tigate, spy on families all across the 
country. 
I have heard more from people of Wy-
oming about this one letter from the 
Secretary of the Treasury than I have 
on many, many issues over the years. 
Every time somebody pays their 
rent, the IRS will now know about it. 
Make a car payment; the IRS will now 
know about it. Pay the plumber; the 
IRS will know about it. 
The amount of power that the IRS 
has will now be more than ever before. 
Democrats are going to send the IRS to 
shake down people for every last dime 
they can. It is too much power. It is 
too much of an invasion of privacy. 
The American people find this dan-
gerous and scary. 
The IRS is already one of the most 
powerful and unaccountable Agencies 
in the Federal Government, if not the 
most 
powerful 
and 
unaccountable 
Agency in the Federal Government. 
Now the Democrats want to unleash it 
even further. 
I just want to talk about one last 
tax, and it is a hidden tax, but it surely 
hurts many Americans, especially the 
poor. And it is a tax called inflation. 
Inflation is happening because Demo-
crats borrowed and spent too much 
money already. If they pass this, prices 
are going to continue to rise. People go 
to the grocery store; they are paying 
more. People go to the gas station; 
they are paying more. 
The Democratic Party’s priorities 
are backward, but under the Demo-
cratic Party today, prices are going up. 
Yet they are giving kickbacks to the 
wealthy, their powerful friends. This is 
heading America toward bankruptcy. 
The American people don’t want higher 
taxes. They want higher wages, lower 
prices, more jobs, more opportunity. 
They don’t want this reckless tax-and- 
spending spree—no, not one bit. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, so 
we are approaching a conversation 
about two big issues here—one is a gov-
ernment shutdown, which I have chal-
lenged this body a lot about of late to 
say: Why are we approaching another 
government shutdown? And then, on 
top of that, we can’t seem to get any of 
the 12 appropriations bills done, which 
there are 12 of them to be done by Sep-
tember 30, but exactly zero of them 
have actually gone through committee 
because this body is so consumed with 
focusing on a $31⁄2 trillion new entitle-
ment package—$31⁄2 trillion—a straight 
partisan package that would create a 
whirlwind of new entitlements. 
To give you a perspective of how big 
31⁄2 trillion is, 31⁄2 trillion is about the 
total revenue that the Federal Govern-
ment brings in in an entire year with 
all taxes, all fees. All everything is 
about $31⁄2 trillion. This is an addi-
tional package on top of that, of enti-
tlements of 31⁄2 trillion new dollars in 
entitlements. 
Now, if I go back to 2017, when we 
were trying to be able to supercharge 
the economy and to be able to create 
more jobs, we passed the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act. And in 2017, when we passed 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it did ex-
actly what we wanted it to do. It sim-
plified the Tax Code for the vast major-
ity of individual filers, it reduced taxes 
for just about every single filer, and it 
increased wages across the country. 
And it increased revenue coming into 
the Treasury because it stimulated our 
economy, which created more jobs, 
which created more opportunity for 
more people to make money. When 
more people make more money, they 
pay more in taxes, and it comes and 
covers it. That is what we did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6575 
September 21, 2021 
My Democratic colleagues are now 
proposing 
$2.1 
trillion 
in 
tax 
in-
creases—tax increases not to cover our 
deficit, tax increases to create new en-
titlements and to spend even more 
money. And the several ways they do it 
are very, very painful, as I read 
through their proposal. 
One of those is that they are pro-
posing to change the corporate tax 
piece, which sounds so good to say: We 
are just going to change the corporate 
tax piece so only corporations will pay 
this—the problem being 1.4 million C 
corporations in the United States, and 
84 percent of those corporations that 
are out there have 20 employees or less. 
So they can throw around the big 
corporations, and everyone thinks it is 
Conoco and Apple. It is—the vast ma-
jority—small businesses designed as C 
corps. 
And how are they going to make 
them more competitive? They are 
going to make those C corps more com-
petitive by raising the tax rate for all 
those corporations to make their tax 
rate higher than China. 
Let me run that past you again. To 
make us more competitive globally, 
they are going to make our tax rate 
higher than China’s tax rate, while we 
are trying to be able to compete with 
China on the world stage. 
Not only that, there is a global min-
imum tax that is already out there 
that is a small tax that is out there for 
every corporation. You know who has 
that already? The United States does. 
You know how that was created? It was 
created in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
in 
2017 
to 
make 
sure 
companies 
couldn’t scam out and couldn’t move 
their money into other places, that 
they would be here. But if they decided 
to move to a tax haven, it wouldn’t be 
there. But we set it at a rate to make 
us competitive. 
They want to take that rate and su-
percharge it and make it one of the top 
rates in the world. 
Now, 
the 
statement 
from 
Janet 
Yellen is that she has already talked to 
all of the other countries about this 
global tax, and they have said: Yes, we 
are on board with a global tax. You go 
first. 
Can I tell you something? I remem-
ber being a middle-school boy—any 
male does. I remember being a middle- 
school boy and hanging out with my 
friends and all of us were talking about 
doing something dumb, and it always 
ended with someone saying: Let’s all 
do it. You go first. 
That is what is being proposed right 
now by Janet Yellen, saying: Let’s 
have the highest tax rate in the world, 
and other countries will come and 
match it, and they will be competitive 
with us. You go first. 
I can assure you, that didn’t work 
out well as a middle-school boy; that is 
not going to work out well for our com-
panies, and it will not work out for our 
economy. 
There is this statement that should 
be ringing in the back of everyone’s 
head, this simple statement that was 
made years ago called inversions. Do 
you remember that old statement when 
we used to talk about corporate inver-
sions? That was American companies 
being bought by international compa-
nies and moved overseas for their head-
quarters. That was a common con-
versation during the Obama adminis-
tration, but something happened. That 
term went away because in the 2017 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bill, that 
stopped, and now American companies 
started buying foreign companies and 
moving them here, and everything 
shifted. 
This $3.5 trillion monstrosity of new 
entitlements will flip that again, and 
we will start hearing the word ‘‘inver-
sions’’ because American companies 
will be moved overseas. It is going to 
happen when we have a really bad, un-
competitive rate. 
Now, people may again say: Well, we 
are just going to stick it to rich people, 
but everyone kind of quietly knows 
that prices will go up, fewer people will 
get raises in those companies, and it 
will be less competitive for the United 
States long term. Everyone knows 
that. 
This $31⁄2 trillion bill of new entitle-
ments is also funded by giving the IRS 
billions of additional dollars to do 
more enforcement and to allow the 
IRS, as Janet Yellen has asked for over 
and over again, to be able to track 
transactions of Americans of $600 or 
more, either deposited in your account 
or out of your banking account. 
I can assure you, banks all over my 
State in Oklahoma are already saying: 
Don’t make us turn in the transactions 
of every one of our people to the IRS. 
Why does the IRS need this? 
Interestingly enough, I have actually 
asked the Commissioner of the IRS: 
Can you manage that much informa-
tion? 
And his answer was a very straight-
forward: No, we can’t even manage the 
information we have now, much less 
the amount of information that would 
come at us of transactions of $600 and 
more. 
This is the wrong direction. I could 
go on and on. In fact, I could give you 
31⁄2
trillion reasons why this is the 
wrong direction. It is the wrong policy. 
It is the wrong thing stepping out of an 
economy that is damaged by COVID. It 
is the wrong set of policies long term 
for our economy. It discourages work. 
And what we are facing right now in 
workplaces all over the country, from 
small to large companies, they are all 
saying the same thing: It is tough to 
get workers. Well, if you think it is 
tough to get workers now, wait until 
there is $31⁄2 trillion in new entitle-
ments dumped into the economy and 
see how hard it is to be able to hire 
workers then. This is the wrong direc-
tion for our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, that 
wraps up the presentations that we 
have for today, and I want to thank my 
Republican colleagues on the Finance 
Committee for coming and helping to 
explain the dangers of this incredibly 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that is being proposed here in Con-
gress. 
As we get more details, as this pack-
age gets played out, we will be back to 
explain further the dangers that there 
are. But I think we have shown very 
clearly today that not only is the 
spending going to be so damaging to 
this country, but the tax plan that is 
accompanying it will make us less 
competitive if, in fact, not completely 
back into last place in terms of com-
petitiveness globally and will impact 
people all across this country in their 
own tax burdens and their own infla-
tionary cost pressures, not just those 
who make over $400,000 per year. 
This tax-and-spend spree must be 
stopped. 
I yield back our time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am 
going to speak and make a unanimous 
consent request in a moment, and I am 
so anxious because a number of my Re-
publican colleagues—I remember being 
in middle school as well. You don’t 
want to be the first; you don’t want to 
be the last. Unfortunately, that is 
where we rank right now in terms of 
comparison to OECD, in terms of rais-
ing corporate revenue. I don’t think 
that is fair for hard-working Ameri-
cans. 
And the ranking member on the Sen-
ate Finance Committee is someone 
that I have huge, huge respect for and 
have worked with on many, many 
items. We are going to have a chance 
to debate part of these components, I 
think, going forward. But I would say 
this. When I first got the note: Well, 
the Senator from Idaho—it was one of 
my first times I was a gang member. 
The Senator from Idaho and I were 
part of something called the ‘‘Gang of 
Six,’’ and we were audacious enough to 
think that a proposal put forward by 
the so-called Simpson-Bowles Commis-
sion to take on the debt and deficit 
issues in our country was worthwhile 
and worth us both, frankly, offending 
folks in each of our respective parties. 
We were astonished that in the 2010– 
2011 timeframe, the country was look-
ing at $15 trillion of debt. We, obvi-
ously, were not very successful, since 
we are now at about $27 trillion in 
debt; and, I would argue, both sides 
bear lots of responsibility. I believe we 
cut revenues way too much. In the last 
year or so alone, we jointly added $5 
trillion-plus 
in 
terms 
of 
spending 
around COVID. 
But the one thing, I think, we both 
realized was what we shouldn’t do is 
ever mess with the full faith and credit 
of the United States of America be-
cause that is like giving an irrespon-
sible politician a hand grenade and say-
ing: Let that politician pull the pin out 
at any moment in time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6576 
September 21, 2021 
Well, there may be some folks now 
who are prepared to pull the pin out 
and put in jeopardy the full faith and 
credit of United States of America. If 
that happens over the next 30 days, the 
one thing that we can be guaranteed is 
it will rock the bond markets. It will 
rock how America views—how the rest 
of the world views America’s ability to 
honor its commitments. 
I fear, unless somebody—and, again, 
my friend from Idaho, I know, realizes 
this as well, is that if we mess with 
this, if we were to see—pull that hand 
grenade and have it explode on all of 
us, the American people aren’t going to 
decide whose fault it was or whose re-
sponsibility it was. All they are going 
to end up seeing, I believe, is that in-
terest rates are going to go up because 
we have not dealt with the debt and 
deficit. At $27 trillion, if interest rates 
go up 100 basis point, 1 percent, that is 
the equivalent of a—call it a tax or 
spending obligation—of $200 billion a 
year of additional interest payments. 
And those interest payments come be-
fore Medicare, come before Social Se-
curity, and come before payment to 
our soldiers. 
So I know we are rallying against 
spending, but let’s make sure—and we 
both ought to bear some responsibility 
on this—we don’t mess with the full 
faith and credit of the United States; 
because if we do that, in addition to all 
the things that you are making criti-
cisms of this reconciliation plan, you 
have just added another $2 trillion of 
spending—mandatory 
spending—over 
the next decade. 
So we can agree or disagree on the 
reconciliation pieces and what parts, 
but let’s guarantee one way or the 
other we don’t mess with the full faith 
and credit of the United States. 
And I thank my good friend from 
Idaho and all the good work that we 
have done together and continue to do 
together. And I am anxious to come 
back and—you know, some parts of 
your critique, I agree with; many I 
don’t. I know I am holding up also my 
colleague and friend from the Intel-
ligence Committee, the Senator from 
Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—CALENDAR NO. 
347 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to seek unanimous consent to 
confirm Mr. Matthew G. Olsen, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to be the next 
Assistant Attorney General for the Na-
tional Security Division at the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
As we all know, America recently 
marked the 20th anniversary of one of 
the darkest days in our history: the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
As chairman of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, I am privy to the intelligence 
information 
being 
collected 
from 
across our IC community, which sets 
forth the myriad threats our Nation 
continues to face both at home and 
abroad. And the Senator from Texas, 
who is a great member of the Intel-
ligence Committee, is aware of those 
threats as well. 
Our ability to counter these threats 
and ensure our national security is de-
pendent on having qualified individuals 
nominated by the President in place so 
they can do their jobs and, impor-
tantly, be held accountable through 
the confirmation process. 
Prior to the attacks of 9/11—and this 
was one of the things that were pointed 
out by the commission afterwards—lit-
erally 57 percent of the Federal Gov-
ernment’s Senate-confirmed top, top 
national security jobs remain vacant— 
57 percent. And one of the key rec-
ommendations of the 9/11 Commission 
was to accelerate the process of na-
tional security appointments. 
Unfortunately, if we fast-forward 20 
years, today you would think we would 
have learned the lesson, but today the 
situation is actually worse than it was 
prior to 9/11. Of the 170 confirmable na-
tional security-related positions, only 
44 have been filled. That is just 26 per-
cent. You know, my math shows that 
that means we have got about 74 per-
cent that are unfilled. We have got to 
do better. 
That is why it is essential for the 
Senate to swiftly confirm every single 
qualified national security intelligence 
professional whose nomination is pend-
ing on the Senate floor. That is why I 
strongly support the swift confirma-
tion of Matt Olsen. 
The National Security Division, or 
NSD, at the DOJ has remained without 
a confirmed senior leader for several 
months. Created in 2006, the NSD con-
solidates the Department’s primary na-
tional security operations and serves 
as a key link between the Department 
and the intelligence community. Its 
mission is to carry out the Depart-
ment’s highest priority: protecting the 
United States from threats to our na-
tional security by pursuing justice 
through law. 
Matt Olsen is eminently qualified for 
this position, given his years of service 
at the DOJ; as general counsel for the 
NSA; and a director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC, in 
which capacity he regularly briefed our 
Intelligence Committee. Matt is a con-
summate intelligence professional and 
an effective leader of the highest cal-
iber and personal and professional in-
tegrity. 
The NSD needs a confirmed leader in 
place. So I am urging my colleagues to 
confirm Matt Olsen immediately. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, Calendar No. 347, Matthew G. 
Olsen, of Maryland, to be an Assistant 
Attorney General; that the nomination 
be confirmed, the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, it is ironic that 
I come to the floor to be with my 
friend, the chairman of the Intelligence 
Committee, with whom I have proudly 
served and with whom I have worked 
on many different projects within the 
intelligence community and the juris-
diction of that committee. But this is 
one where we clearly see things dif-
ferently. 
Mr. Olsen, for most of his career—and 
it has been a distinguished career—has 
operated as a nonpartisan public serv-
ant. But as Senator GRASSLEY, ranking 
member on the Judiciary Committee, 
said at the time he had his hearing 
there, once the previous administra-
tion took office, it was like a switch 
got flipped and he turned into a par-
tisan warrior. 
Over the last few years, Mr. Olsen 
has 
made 
a 
series 
of 
serious 
ultrapartisan statements. Prior to the 
2016 election, he said that ISIS sup-
ported Donald Trump for President. 
Following the election, he claimed that 
the electoral college should be abol-
ished because it is a national security 
threat. He signed on to a number of let-
ters hysterically criticizing then-At-
torney General Barr and the Justice 
Department, and he failed to disclose 
these writings and other critical infor-
mation to the Judiciary Committee 
during the hearing on his nomination. 
I believe now, more than ever, it is 
absolutely critical that the Justice De-
partment and our intelligence commu-
nity operate free from political influ-
ence and bias. But I have no confidence 
that, if confirmed, Mr. Olsen’s partisan 
switch will get flipped back off. I fear 
he will continue to pursue his political 
objectives from within the Depart-
ment, using the powerful tools of the 
Department of Justice to pave the way 
for his partisan political agenda. 
And lest anybody think these con-
cerns are unprecedented or groundless, 
let me just point out that we now have 
a former lawyer with the FBI that has 
pled guilty for falsifying an application 
to the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Court in the process of inves-
tigating an American citizen. He has 
now pled guilty and is now serving pro-
bation, a lawyer with the FBI who er-
roneously communicated information 
to the court with which they relied 
upon to issue a warrant to surveil an 
American citizen, using the powers of 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court. 
And then, just this last week, an-
other lawyer has been indicted by Mr. 
Durham, the special counsel—some-
body who has a distinguished career as 
a former Federal prosecutor and has 
worked at a prominent firm that typi-
cally represents the Democratic Party. 
He now has been indicted for lying to 
the FBI, and it rises out of a conversa-
tion he had with a general counsel at 
the FBI, suggesting that there was 
some link between the Trump adminis-
tration—or Trump organization and a 
criminal-linked Russian lender called 
Alfa Bank.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6577 
September 21, 2021 
The indictment says that Michael 
Sussmann lied about the capacity in 
which he was providing this informa-
tion to the FBI. But, in fact, what he 
did is prepare white papers using con-
fidential information obtained from a 
technology client and fed that to the 
FBI while he claimed to be just a good 
citizen wanting to pass this informa-
tion along when he was actually on the 
payroll of the Clinton campaign. 
And, obviously, then talking to the 
press, leaking this narrative to the 
press, this has, I think, contributed to 
this false narrative of somehow that 
the Russians colluded with then-Can-
didate Trump in order to win the elec-
tion. There has been no evidence at all, 
whether if you look at the inspector 
general 
report—Inspector 
General 
Horowitz—about the now debunked 
Steele dossier, which supposedly was 
the basis upon which the FBI opened 
their investigation. 
So what we are talking about is peo-
ple in positions of trust and confidence 
in the U.S. Government abusing their 
power, lying to the FBI, and lying to 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court in order to pursue a partisan po-
litical objective. 
Now, I have no idea what Mr. Olsen 
would do, but I don’t think we can take 
any risks, given the fact he has now 
turned into a partisan warrior. We 
have got ample examples of people 
who, perhaps against their better judg-
ment, have thrown into this resistance 
attitude and simply forgotten their 
professional responsibilities. And when 
it comes to the intelligence commu-
nity and national security, we don’t 
need any more partisan warriors in 
these positions of trust. These should 
be nonpartisan professionals. 
So I don’t think Mr. Olsen has cer-
tainly satisfied me or many of my 
other colleagues that he can flip that 
partisan warrior switch off. For that 
reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just 
want to make a couple of quick com-
ments in response to my friend from 
Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. We have worked on a 
number of—or continue to work on a 
number of important items. But I 
think it is—various—he is citing a cou-
ple of lawyers at the front end of the 
legal process that have either been ar-
rested or have not gone through the 
whole judicial process yet. 
I don’t have the whole list in front of 
me, but I would be happy to present for 
the record the list of individuals affili-
ated with the Trump campaign who 
have been arrested and convicted and 
pled guilty because of lying to the FBI 
or involvement with Russia. I think 
our investigation, of which I am quite, 
quite proud—bipartisan, successful— 
clearly showed Russian interference in 
the 2016 elections. 
We have seen the results of the 
Mueller investigation. I can’t recall 
the exact number of convictions that 
arose out of that. And I agree with my 
friend, the Senator from Texas, that we 
don’t want—the last thing I want is 
any more partisanship between the in-
telligence community. 
And that is why I just again want to 
cite for the record the individuals—yes, 
Mr. Olsen joined a lot of intelligence 
professionals in raising concerns about 
the way the previous administration 
ran 
the 
intelligence 
community. 
Frankly, I think they ran it, in many 
ways, disrespectful to the folks who 
worked in that community. 
But, again, talking about Matt Olsen 
and his career, I have got a letter here 
that has got literally hundreds of intel-
ligence and DOJ professionals who sup-
port Mr. Olsen. Let me just cite a cou-
ple of them—all of them individuals, by 
the way, who have served Republican 
Presidents: Michael Chertoff, as we all 
know, Assistant Attorney General, also 
then subsequently head of DHS; Zach 
Terwilliger, U.S. attorney for the East-
ern District of Virginia, served under 
President Trump; Kenneth Wainstein, 
U.S. attorney for the District of Co-
lumbia, 2004 to 2006, under President 
Bush; Charles Rosenberg, served under 
President Bush in the Southern Dis-
trict and the Eastern District; Paul 
McNulty, again, served under President 
Bush, Eastern District of Virginia, U.S. 
attorney; Michael Mukasey, Attorney 
General under President Bush; Jesse 
Liu, U.S. attorney under President 
Trump in the District of Columbia. The 
list goes on and on. 
Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. WARNER. All I am hoping is 
that we would get a chance to debate 
Mr. Olsen’s qualifications and bring it 
to the floor for a vote. Instead, we have 
a whole clump of individuals who have 
been put on hold, a process that 99.9 
percent of Americans don’t understand. 
I think Mr. Olsen’s career and his 
service to our country deserves a free 
and fulsome debate. Those individuals 
who don’t want to vote for him, have at 
it. But we are not getting that oppor-
tunity because—and it is not my friend 
from Texas. Let me be clear. He is not 
the person who placed holds. That 
process is taking place, and, unfortu-
nately, I believe Mr. Olsen is not going 
to have his—not even his day in court 
but his day on the floor of the Senate, 
which I think, with his service to our 
country, he merits and deserves. 
Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would 
yield for a question? 
Mr. WARNER. Of course. 
Mr. DURBIN. As the chair of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, we have 
joint committee jurisdiction between 
the Intelligence and the Judiciary 
Committee in dealing with this nomi-
nation. 
This is an extraordinary individual. 
And I have to raise the most basic 
question, and that is: At this moment 
in history, is this the right moment to 
leave this spot vacant? To not have 
someone in leadership, a gentleman 
whom you have noted has bipartisan 
support for his intelligence creden-
tials? 
You mentioned quite a few names of 
those supporting him. A couple of the 
names of those supporting him that 
you did not mention: former NSA Di-
rector, GEN Keith Alexander; former 
Director of National Intelligence, Mike 
McConnell; Senator Saxby Chambliss, 
our friend and former colleague who 
served on the Intelligence Committee 
as a vice chair—all in support of Mr. 
Olsen’s nomination. 
And I would say, at this moment in 
history, without going into any graph-
ic detail or classified information, but 
to have this kind of vacancy in this 
spot, do you believe this has an impact 
on our security as a nation? 
Mr. WARNER. I would say to the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
you know, we all reflected recently 
where we were 20 years ago on 9/11. But 
one of the astounding things that came 
out of the report after 9/11 was that, at 
that moment, on 9/11 in 2001, 57 percent 
of the senior officials in the intel-
ligence community had not been con-
firmed. Those positions weren’t filled. 
The amazing thing is, 20 years later, 74 
percent of those top positions are not 
filled. I think that is a disservice to the 
memory of those who perished on 9/11, 
and I think it is unfortunate, to say 
the least. 
If Members have, in good faith, con-
cerns with Mr. Olsen, let’s debate and 
have at it. But the idea of a large block 
of intelligence and law enforcement 
professionals—and we need this posi-
tion at the Justice Department—sit-
ting unfilled because of an individual 
Member, on an issue not related to 
their qualifications, to put a blanket 
hold on a series of this President’s 
nominees does not make our Nation 
safer. 
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, sir. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what I 
was referring to earlier are examples of 
abuse of power by people in the U.S. 
Government who are in a position to do 
things to average citizens that, frank-
ly, if they can do them to powerful in-
dividuals like candidates for President 
or our sitting officeholders, what is the 
little guy supposed to do? 
If people are so blinded by their par-
tisanship or their desire to get some-
body that they violate their oath, they 
violate the law, and abuse power, what 
is the average man and woman sup-
posed to do? 
You know, it reminds me a little bit 
of the hearing that we had just a cou-
ple of days ago in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, where this monster named 
Larry Nassar, an Olympic physician for 
18 years, systematically and routinely 
sexually assaulted and abused young 
female Olympic athletes. 
And for years, these Olympic athletes 
tried to get the FBI to investigate 
their allegations against Dr. Nassar.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6578 
September 21, 2021 
And it took an extended period of 
time—I think it was a year and a half— 
before the FBI actually undertook the 
investigation. But it took a couple of 
our colleagues—people like Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
from Connecticut, Sen-
ator JERRY
MORAN
from Kansas—in 
order to stay on this issue until, fi-
nally, this monster, Dr. Nassar, was 
charged with crimes and convicted and 
now is going to serve in prison the rest 
of his life. 
But it haunts me to think, if these 
elite Olympic athletes whose names 
are known all around the world could 
not get the government to respond to 
their assault and to do them justice, 
what chance do the rest of us have? I 
am not worried about Members of Con-
gress; I am worried about my 29 million 
constituents. 
And so the examples I gave of Mr. 
Clinesmith, who lied to the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Court in order 
to get a warrant to illegally surveil an 
American citizen—that is an abuse of 
power that causes me very grave con-
cern. 
And when I read the indictment of 
Michael Sussman lying to the FBI 
about his connection to the Clinton 
campaign, while he compiled informa-
tion that was confidential, gave it to 
the FBI, claimed to just be a good cit-
izen and not representing any client, 
when in fact he was on the payroll of 
the Clinton campaign, and he was sys-
tematically leaking this information 
to the press to feed this narrative 
about Russian collusion—which has ob-
sessed Congress and the country for 
years. 
And now we know there is no factual 
basis for the allegations against then- 
Candidate Trump or then later Presi-
dent Trump. The Russian collusion 
narrative was not true, but it was fed 
by partisans who abused their power in 
order to gain politically. 
So I don’t know Mr. Olsen that well. 
Like I said, I know he has had a distin-
guished career. But something clearly 
snapped when he became a partisan 
lawyer. And I simply do not have con-
fidence that he will not abuse his 
power in pursuit of his partisan aims. 
There are better people that the 
President could nominate to serve in 
this sensitive position, and I will not, 
in good conscience, agree to simply 
allow somebody with this sort of track 
record to be confirmed. 
And as my colleagues know, the ma-
jority leader has all the tools he needs 
at his disposal to have a vote on the 
Senate floor on this nomination. But it 
shouldn’t be done by unanimous con-
sent. It shouldn’t be done outside of 
the public attention because there are 
so many things competing for people’s 
attention. I think this is a debate and 
a conversation we need to have about 
powerful public officials abusing their 
power for partisan political gain. 
What chance does the average Amer-
ican have if they will abuse that power 
to go after powerful public figures like 
a candidate for President or an incum-
bent President of the United States? 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, our 
friends across the aisle are moving full 
steam ahead with what I think is fairly 
described as a reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree, which is chock-full of unnec-
essary, 
unwarranted, 
and 
flatout 
unaffordable policies. 
Remember that we had to spend a lot 
of 
money—borrowed 
money—during 
the COVID crisis, which we did on a bi-
partisan basis because it was a na-
tional—indeed, an international and 
global emergency. 
But as we continue to get people vac-
cinated and put the pandemic in the 
rearview mirror, our colleagues simply 
want to continue spending money that 
we don’t have to pursue their ideolog-
ical and political agenda, to grow the 
government, to intrude more in peo-
ple’s lives, and to take more of what 
they earn rather than let them spend it 
as they see fit. 
Our colleagues want to impose crip-
pling tax hikes on job creators at a 
time when many of them are still 
digging out of the recession that was 
part of the pandemic. They want to 
dole out permanent welfare without re-
quiring able-bodied men and women to 
work. They want to discourage medical 
innovation through price fixing and 
implement a range of items from their 
far-left wish list. 
After charging nearly $2 trillion on 
the taxpayers’ credit card earlier this 
year, our Democratic colleagues are 
back at it for round 2. And this time, 
they are going all out. That is espe-
cially true when it comes to the energy 
sector. 
Over the past few years, we have seen 
no shortage of unrealistic and down-
right harmful policies to reduce carbon 
emissions. Now, there is a smart way 
to do it, and there is a self-defeating 
way to reduce emissions. One is to re-
duce the use of coal and increase the 
use of things like natural gas, which 
has much lower carbon content than 
coal. And we are doing that, and we 
have reduced emissions as a result. 
But our colleagues have proposed ev-
erything from the socialist paradise 
that is the Green New Deal to more 
targeted but no more realistic net zero 
emission bills. 
This reckless tax-and-spending spree 
compiles the most outlandish proposals 
into one of the greatest hits albums. 
The hallmark of this legislation is a 
full range of tax increases on the fossil 
fuel industry, which ultimately are 
passed along to consumers and con-
tribute to inflation and the increased 
costs that they have to pay in order to 
fill up at the pump. 
Whether we are talking about en-
ergy, agriculture, or any other indus-
try, higher taxes always mean higher 
prices for consumers. It is inevitable. 
Businesses can’t just take the in-
creases as a hit to their bottom line. 
They might raise taxes, lay off employ-
ees, postpone expansion plans, or im-
plement all of the above, but that is ex-
actly what this proposal would spur 
when it comes to the energy sector. 
It increases taxes already paid by en-
ergy companies on income earned in 
the global marketplace and subjects 
energy employers to double taxation of 
their foreign income. It also adds a 
brand new tax, the Superfund excise 
tax, which was eliminated 25 years 
ago—all in pursuit of more revenue to 
grow the size of the government. 
Our friends across the aisle want to 
resurrect this tax and force energy 
companies to pay more on every barrel 
of crude oil that is sold. Once again, 
the ultimate burden won’t be on those 
companies. It will fall to consumers 
who are already struggling to keep up 
with inflation. 
Gasoline prices are up 42 percent over 
last year. Natural gas is up 21 percent. 
Families in Texas are paying more on 
everything from electricity to gro-
ceries, to vehicles. This smorgasbord of 
higher taxes will only drive up costs 
for working families and hurt the very 
job creators we have been trying to 
help, over the last year and a half, dig 
out from under COVID–19. 
You have to wonder, if these policies 
are going to hurt working Americans 
and the economy, who benefits? Well, 
for starters, our geopolitical adver-
saries will benefit. The higher cost on 
domestic crude would, once again, 
make the U.S. reliant on imports of oil 
and gas from overseas, from countries 
like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and 
Venezuela perhaps. 
President 
Biden 
unintentionally 
demonstrated the hypocrisy of this ap-
proach when he pushed, earlier this 
year, to beg OPEC, the Organization of 
the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to 
increase production overseas to bring 
down oil prices here in the United 
States. In other words, he doesn’t want 
American oil and gas producers to 
produce oil and gas. He wants the Rus-
sians and the Saudis to do it to help us 
bring down prices here in America. 
It is just crazy. It makes no sense. If 
the President is worried about afford-
able energy, he needs to quit pushing 
policies that will drive up the cost for 
consumers at the pump. 
Other big winners include wealthy 
electric vehicle drivers. The sort of 
subsidies that are contained in this 
proposed package includes a tax credit 
for electric vehicle purchases, even if 
these cars are made—you guessed it— 
in China. And it is subsidizing—it is 
taking 
middle-income 
taxpayers’ 
money and giving it to people who are 
buying expensive cars because they are 
incentivized by the tax credit. Mean-
while, we have 280 million cars on the 
road in America that still depend on oil 
and gas in order to function because 
they have, yes, an internal combustion 
engine. 
On top of that, a bigger tax credit is 
given to electric cars built in union 
shops. Now, why would you favor a po-
litical supporter like organized labor?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6579 
September 21, 2021 
Well, I think the answer may be pretty 
obvious. Maybe union-built electric ve-
hicles are more green than other elec-
tric vehicles or maybe it is a favor 
doled out to a special interest group by 
my friends on the other side, to a polit-
ical constituency. 
As a reminder, unlike gas-powered 
vehicle drivers, EV drivers don’t even 
pay anything for the highways that 
they drive their car on. They don’t pay 
into the highway trust fund, which 
comes out of the cost of a gallon of gas, 
to help maintain our roads and bridges. 
So our friends across the aisle just 
keep on coming with tax breaks for the 
well-off and the well-to-do in a way 
that will burden hard-working Texans 
and Americans. 
I support efforts to reduce carbon 
emissions to preserve our air, land, and 
water for future generations, but these 
efforts shouldn’t pick winners and los-
ers, especially when wealthy Ameri-
cans are reaping the benefits at the 
cost of blue-collar workers. 
Like the rest of the reckless tax-and- 
spending spree proposal, the cost of 
this energy proposal far exceeds any 
benefit. It will drive up costs for Amer-
ican families, hurt our global competi-
tiveness, ultimately hurt our allies 
that depend on exported LNG to pro-
vide energy diversity, and it will em-
power our adversaries. 
So there is no reason to stick tax-
payers with the bill for these unneces-
sary policies when there are better 
ways to keep costs for consumers low 
while protecting our environment. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield 
back our remaining time.

HONORING SSG RYAN KNAUSS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is my honor to pay tribute 
today to a fellow Tennessean who made 
the ultimate sacrifice for his country. 
On August 26, 2021, at approximately 
9:30 am Eastern Standard Time, an 
ISIS-K terrorist murdered 13 American 
servicemembers in a suicide attack on 
the Abbey Gate leading into Hamid 
Karzai International Airport in Kabul, 
Afghanistan. 
Among the fallen was Corryton na-
tive SSG Ryan Knauss. Ryan served 
with the Army’s 9th Battalion, 8th 
Psychological Operations Group (Air-
borne), which put him directly in the 
heart of Afghan communities. His job 
was to build relationships with the peo-
ple he met there, and by all accounts, 
he succeeded with uncommon skill, 
empathy, and compassion. It was dan-
gerous work, but Ryan understood its 
importance. As his widow Alena re-
cently told a Knoxville newspaper, 
‘‘When he spoke of the people of Af-
ghanistan, all he saw were people that 
needed help. They were below no one in 
his eyes, not even Americans. He told 
me that all he saw were people of a dif-
ferent culture who deserved to be OK.’’ 
When the time came for the Army to 
support evacuations at the airport, 
Ryan volunteered for the mission. He 
knew that, by doing this, he would be 
putting himself in danger; but when he 
looked at the chaos unfolding there, all 
he saw were the thousands of women 
and children forced into the line of fire 
by the persistent, terrifying evil that 
was seizing control of Kabul. 
And so he went and faithfully exe-
cuted his duty. He was born to be a sol-
dier and died as the finest example of 
American heroism anyone could ask 
for. He was a loving husband, a loyal 
friend, and a light in the darkness. 
Ryan’s unit, Detachment 10, offered a 
statement following his death that I 
believe deserves a place in the RECORD. 
They said, ‘‘Ryan knew the dangerous 
situation he was going to, but pro-
tecting innocent civilians is one of the 
values that drove him. It has been said 
that life is not important except in the 
impact it has on other lives, and Ryan 
had an incredible impact on his family 
and friends. And thanks to his actions, 
thousands of children will have the joy 
of knowing a childhood free from dan-
ger and oppression.’’ 
Ryan, we are in awe of you. Thank 
you for your service to this country 
and for your sacrifice on behalf of all 
those who seek refuge within the com-
mon cause of freedom. 
(At the request of Mr. INHOFE, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
f 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CUS-
TER 
COUNTY 
SENIOR 
CITIZEN 
CENTER 
∑ Mr. 
ROUNDS. 
Madam 
President, 
today I rise to recognize the 50th anni-
versary of the Custer County Senior 
Citizen Center in Custer, SD. The Cus-
ter County Senior Citizen Center has 
continually been a place of resource, 
entertainment, recreation, and com-
munity for the venerable elder citi-
zenry of the Custer Community and 
southern Black Hills since 1971; the 50 
years of success the Custer Senior Cen-
ter has enjoyed is fully supported by 
the hundreds of volunteers who have 
donated thousands of hours every year 
for five decades to help the senior cen-
ter thrive and grow into the valuable 
community resource it has become. 
The Custer County Senior Center 
provides unlimited opportunities for 
growth, 
prosperity, 
increased 
lon-
gevity, and improved quality of life to 
our valuable senior citizens by pro-
viding educational, cultural, financial, 
medical, intellectual, and fitness pro-
grams throughout the year. 
The Custer County Senior Center will 
continue into the next 50 years pro-
viding unparalleled service to the gold-
en age population of Custer County, 
the Black Hills, and the State of South 
Dakota as it has done since its incep-
tion, with the support of the commu-
nity, the members, the volunteers, and 
the dedicated staff at the center.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PAUL M. MATULIC 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, today I 
wish to pay tribute to Paul Matulic, a 
dedicated member of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence staff for 
over 16 years. Paul’s total service to 
the U.S. Senate spans 27 years, the first 
11 of which were spent as foreign policy 
adviser to Senator Orrin Hatch. Since 
joining the staff in 2005, Paul has been 
resolute and unwavering in his com-
mitment to the committee’s oversight 
mandate. He has managed an array of 
critical responsibilities ranging from 
oversight of intelligence community 
covert action programs and regional 
monitoring of America’s national secu-
rity hotspots and warzones, to making 
key contributions in support of the 
committee’s most sensitive and high- 
profile investigative work. Paul never 
got anything but difficult assignments 
because I trusted him and I knew he 
would do an excellent job. 
Through it all, Paul maintained an 
erudite and exemplary professionalism 
that bettered both his colleagues in the 
performance of their oversight work 
and the intelligence professionals who 
he oversaw. Paul was exacting as an 
overseer, but he always balanced his 
demanding expectations with a heart-
felt, genuine admiration for the ex-
traordinary men and women of the in-
telligence community he helped over-
see. Paul enjoyed relationships of trust 
and respect with his colleagues and 
members of the committee alike be-
cause he was thorough, he was pre-
pared, and above all, Paul always gave 
you the truth, whether you wanted to 
hear it or not. 
Before coming to work for the Senate 
in 1994, Paul served as the vice presi-
dent of Hill & Knowlton, a global pub-
lic relations consultancy in New York 
City. Prior to that, Paul spent several 
years as an editorial and research as-
sistant in the office of former Presi-
dent Nixon. Paul earned a master’s de-
gree in international affairs and polit-
ical economy from Columbia Univer-
sity, and a bachelor of science in inter-
national affairs from St. John Fisher 
College in Rochester, NY. Prior to col-
lege, Paul experienced life at its 
grandest and grittiest, working from 
one side of the North American con-
tinent to the other, all the way into 
the Yukon Territory, spending time as 
a gravedigger, a magician, a ranch 
hand, a construction worker, a janitor, 
and a bartender. 
Paul’s work for the committee, by its 
very nature, defies elaboration in this 
public forum. It is enough to say that 
Paul approached every day in the office 
with one ideal in mind: Democracy is 
underwritten by a vigorous system of 
checks and balances and that account-
ability is all the more necessary when 
it is applied to intelligence activities 
that might otherwise escape public

scrutiny. The pride and purpose Paul 
took from being a part of that over-
sight mechanism were evident in the 
seriousness with which he approached 
his work. I am personally grateful to 
Paul for everything he did on the com-
mittee’s behalf. 
Paul plans to spend his retirement 
with Margo, the great love of his life, 
at his side. He intends to travel, read, 
and walk the woods of the Rock Creek 
Park where he has found so much com-
fort and solace over the years. The son 
of European immigrants, who emi-
grated himself from Canada when he 
was 4 years old, Paul’s story is a dis-
tinctly American one. Everyone who 
got to play a role in it these past 16 
years is better for it. 
It gives me great joy to publicly 
thank Paul for his contributions to the 
work of the committee, the integrity of 
congressional oversight, and the secu-
rity of this great Nation. He has been a 
credit to what we do from the moment 
he joined the staff. 
Congratulations and best of luck to 
you in retirement, Paul. Neither your 
expertise, your good humor, nor your 
wise counsel will soon be replaced.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CHIEF JON SIMPSON 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Bentonville Po-
lice Chief Jon Simpson whose dedica-
tion to law enforcement and commu-
nity service will be deeply missed fol-
lowing his retirement as chief of the 
Bentonville Police Department. 
Chief Simpson’s dedication is ground-
ed in his strong roots to northwest Ar-
kansas as a Bentonville native and 
graduate of the University of Arkan-
sas. He established a career in public 
safety, first in the security division of 
Walmart 
Stores, 
Inc., 
before 
transitioning to work for the city as a 
patrol officer in 1994, where his service 
quickly stood out. After only 2 years 
with the Bentonville Police Depart-
ment, Jon was named officer of the 
year. 
From there, the chief held numerous 
supervisory positions and led by exam-
ple, inspiring officers in both the patrol 
and criminal divisions. He was pro-
moted to a command staff member in 
2006 and, in 2011, was appointed chief of 
the Bentonville Police Department. In 
these leadership roles, Chief Simpson 
reorganized the rank structure of the 
department, added personnel with fur-
ther opportunities for advisory posi-
tions, and upgraded the department’s 
vehicles and equipment. Additionally, 
he led an extensive renovation to the 
police department building that added 
a bomb squad facility, emergency com-
munication center, criminal investiga-
tions building, and emergency oper-
ations center. 
The Bentonville community’s rapid 
growth and unique challenges certainly 
shaped Chief Simpson’s tenure. He rec-
ognized 
the 
high 
expectations 
of 
Bentonville citizens and was encour-
aged to do more to ensure his officers 
lived up to those standards. That ap-
proach led to the incredible level of 
safety 
and 
security 
within 
the 
Bentonville community today. Chief 
Simpson’s impact has also been recog-
nized beyond his own department. Re-
cently, the Arkansas Fraternal Order 
of Police in Little Rock recognized him 
with 
its 
Outstanding 
Police 
Chief 
Award. 
Chief Simpson has demonstrated a 
relentless pursuit to improve himself, 
his team, and the community he served 
throughout his career. I applaud his 
dedicated, decades-long commitment 
to law enforcement and the safety of 
his fellow Arkansans. He is a true pub-
lic servant who has strengthened law 
and order in Bentonville. It has been an 
honor to work with him during his ten-
ure, and I wish him all the best in his 
next endeavor.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BRENDAN O’NEILL 
∑ Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor a dedicated public serv-
ant of the First State, an attorney, 
community leader, and friend to many, 
who this summer concludes a distin-
guished legal career of more than 45 
years. 
Attorney Brendan O’Neill of Wil-
mington, DE, wore many hats during 
his career: county and Federal pros-
ecutor, a criminal defense lawyer in 
private practice, and chief public de-
fender. 
Delaware is known as a State of 
neighbors, and when it comes to 
Brendan O’Neill, there is no better 
neighbor. Brendan was, for a decade, 
my actual next-door neighbor, and we 
even studied and took the Delaware bar 
exam together in 1992. 
Looking back on his long legal ca-
reer, Brendan reminded his wife, Liz 
O’Neill, about all of the positions he 
has held over the years. 
‘‘I’ve had a very interesting profes-
sional life. It’s been a lot of fun,’’ 
Brendan said, adding as he often does, 
jokingly, ‘‘I’ve done everything but 
make money.’’ 
Brendan has had a truly remarkable 
run. Before I offer some sentiments and 
well wishes from family and friends, it 
is only appropriate to chronicle his ca-
reer. 
After graduating from the UC Davis 
School of Law in 1975, Brendan became 
a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County 
District 
Attorney’s 
Office, 
transitioning later to a Federal pros-
ecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
there. 
Following those early years, Brendan 
started a criminal defense practice, 
O’Neill and Young, in Santa Monica, 
which overlooked beautiful Palisades 
Park and the iconic beach on Ocean 
Avenue. That practice, cofounded with 
his college friend, Wayne Young, oper-
ated from 1979 to 1993. 
It was then, Liz said, that Brendan 
was ‘‘deported from California’’ to 
Delaware, where he landed a position 
as a lawyer in the civil division of the 
Delaware Department of Justice. 
In 1995, Brendan launched what would 
become a 26-year career in the Dela-
ware Public Defender’s Office. In May 
2009, Governor Jack Markell tapped 
Brendan to be the chief public de-
fender, a position of trust he fulfilled 
for 12 years. 
‘‘Brendan O’Neill was a fierce advo-
cate for his clients and a key pro-
ponent for the right of all accused to 
have a competent defense,’’ former 
Governor Markell said. ‘‘His was one of 
the most important nominations I ever 
made, and I’m not the least bit sur-
prised he is widely recognized as hav-
ing been a highly effective public de-
fender. Delaware is better for his serv-
ice, and I am proud to be associated 
with 
this 
intelligent, 
joyful, 
pas-
sionate, and competent leader. I have 
no doubt he will continue to be a wide-
ly respected member of the Delaware 
community in retirement.’’ 
During his 12 years as Delaware’s 
chief public defender, Brendan and his 
team overhauled the system for pro-
viding indigent criminal defense by 
creating the office of defense services, 
or ODS, which now includes the public 
defender’s office and the office of con-
flicts counsel. 
Brendan implemented the practice of 
vertical representation statewide in all 
courts. Attorneys with ODS success-
fully challenged the constitutionality 
of Delaware’s death penalty statute. He 
acquired additional office space for 
ODS’s Kent County and Sussex County 
practices and increased the focus on 
holistic defense to address clients’ on-
going needs and issues. 
On top of those accomplishments, 
ODS was voted as one of the best work-
places in Delaware for 10 consecutive 
years. 
Being a public defender is not an easy 
job. People outside of the legal profes-
sion often asked Brendan how he could 
represent folks who allegedly com-
mitted terrible crimes. Liz said that 
she was often curious about that her-
self, knowing the nature of his respon-
sibility. 
Brendan generally responded, Liz 
said, by reminding folks that public de-
fenders represent people who were ac-
cused of crimes and that the American 
legal system was founded on the pre-
sumption of innocence. Brendan often 
made the analogy that we don’t want 
doctors who chastise us about how we 
got our medical condition. We want 
doctors who listen to us and help us 
with our problems. 
The same goes for lawyers. We want 
them to fight for us, Brendan said, and 
help us get the best possible outcome. 
He often has held that there is no 
greater pressure than representing an 
innocent person. As a defense attorney, 
the facts are often not on your side, so 
you do the best you can to put on your 
case. 
Brendan’s career is full of people he 
has helped in very stressful situations,

facing potential consequences from los-
ing their license, their freedom, or 
their life. His clients benefited from his 
nonjudgmental nature, generous heart, 
good humor, practical approach, under-
standing, and kindness. 
‘‘I can only count on one hand, the 
times when he couldn’t see the good in 
his client,’’ Liz said. ‘‘In those cases, 
he always fought for someone close to 
them, a mother, wife, son, or daugh-
ter.’’ 
Despite the odds and the outcomes, 
Liz said, Brendan was consistently sup-
portive of his clients, sometimes even 
providing them with practical things 
like Liz’s favorite pair of sweatpants, 
which happened to be in the backseat 
of his car. 
He was a constant source of encour-
agement and positivity to many Dela-
wareans, whether it was the father say-
ing goodbye to his teenage son found 
guilty or the girlfriend of a drug dealer 
starting anew in the witness protection 
program. Brendan often stayed in 
touch with the family and friends of 
his clients long after the verdict came 
down. 
Brendan always fought hard for his 
clients, giving them and their loved 
ones his best shot. The courtroom was 
theater to Brendan, and he thrived on 
being prepared and at the top of his 
game. 
‘‘I remember many nights listening 
to a closing argument at the dining 
room table with a cardboard box as a 
podium and charts taped to the walls 
as he practiced his speech,’’ Liz fondly 
remembered. 
Brendan is a person who respects ev-
eryone’s role in the court system. He 
often would go out of his way to get to 
know the people who made it happen, 
including the bailiffs, court reporters, 
clerks, judges, and the ‘‘other side,’’ 
depending on his role as a prosecutor 
or a defense attorney. 
Many Delawareans don’t know that 
Brendan had a thriving pro-bono prac-
tice over the years. He counseled 
countless teens, young adults, and 
their parents about legal problems, 
things such as DUIs, disorderly con-
duct, speeding tickets, etc. He was 
there to provide nonjudgmental guid-
ance for legal issues and emotional 
support. 
Along 
with 
his 
pro-bono 
effort, 
Brendan 
volunteered 
innumerable 
hours over the years as a board mem-
ber for organizations such as the Cen-
tral 
YMCA, 
Catholic 
Charities, 
Salesianum School—and his current 
role as the chair of Autism Delaware, 
an organization close to his heart. 
Brendan is a person who embraces 
new beginnings. He looks forward in 
times of uncertainty, disappointment, 
success, and happiness and encourages 
others to do the same. There are so 
many examples, but the biggest one is 
leaving his California-based law prac-
tice, taking and passing the Delaware 
bar after 17 years of already being an 
attorney, and starting anew in Dela-
ware. 
Besides all of the volunteer work and 
his impressive career as our top public 
defender, Brendan’s hallmark is serv-
ing his clients, coworkers, friends, and 
family 
well. 
His 
five 
children— 
Brendan, Eamon, Brian, Claire, and 
Rainey—are paramount in his mind 
and life. 
If you are on his team, he is in your 
corner. Claire O’Neill Peabody, who in-
terned at the public defender’s office 
for a summer, wasn’t exactly sure what 
her dad did there other than being the 
chief cheerleader, making the rounds 
every day, stopping by offices telling 
people what a great job they were 
doing. He is known for motivating both 
his employees and his family with fa-
mous one-liners and other inspiring 
words. 
‘‘Dad has a phrase, saying, or one- 
liner for just about every situation life 
can throw at you,’’ Claire said. ‘‘One of 
his many mantras is ‘Next play!’ ’’ 
That one-liner, in particular, is one 
that he says to his kids all the time. 
‘‘While explaining it takes away from 
the one-liner magic,’’ Claire said, ‘‘I 
am pretty sure he wants us to take 
what we’ve learned from a previous ex-
perience but focus on the next thing in 
front of you.’’ 
Her dad’s own ‘‘next play’’ will in-
clude a lot of play: golf and tennis, two 
of his favorite activities. ‘‘He’s earned 
it,’’ Claire said. ‘‘So good luck on your 
next play, Duner! Hit em straight!’’ 
Eamon O’Neill said one of his favor-
ite things about his father is the abil-
ity to relish in the simple joys of life 
while they are happening. His dad does 
not need to lose something to appre-
ciate it; he enjoys what he has while he 
has it. 
‘‘For as long as I can remember, he 
has encouraged me to do the same,’’ 
Eamon said. ‘‘Often, this happened as 
we were driving to one of the thou-
sands of soccer practices my dad self-
lessly took me to over the years. As we 
were getting close to the field, he 
would remind me of how great and how 
much fun practice is and how lucky I 
was to be playing a game I loved with 
my friends.’’ 
This lesson did not always stick with 
Eamon as a teenager, but he thinks 
about it often as an adult. ‘‘The ability 
to be present and grateful and enthusi-
astic during the small and routine mo-
ments of life,’’ Eamon continued, ‘‘is 
something I love about dad and try to 
emulate every day.’’ 
Brian O’Neill, who plays offensive 
tackle for the Minnesota Vikings, said, 
‘‘play hard, have fun’’ is one of his 
dad’s most famous quotes. ‘‘He has said 
this to us a few thousand times over 
the years. The message is simple—give 
your best and have fun while doing it.’’ 
Brian said that his father has lived 
and exemplified that quote every day 
of his professional and personal life. ‘‘I 
know he gave his best—to his cases, 
clients, coworkers, and colleagues,’’ 
Brian said. ‘‘I know damn well he also 
had so much fun along the ride. He al-
ways says if you love what you do, 
you’ll never work a day in your life. If 
I can have half the fun he did in my ca-
reer—I know I’ll have a chance!’’ 
My family had the opportunity to get 
to know the O’Neills well. They lived 
next to us when we were in the Tri-
angle Neighborhood in Wilmington. 
There was a fence between our yards, 
and we took that fence down; we were 
one big family. 
Brendan is truly the salt of the earth. 
He is smart, loyal, and kind. He is 
funny and always makes everyone in 
the room feel welcome. 
‘‘You want Brendan on your team,’’ 
my wife Annie said. ‘‘He takes every-
thing in stride; he sticks by you. We 
love him, and he and his family fill our 
cup and our hearts!’’ 
For me, Brendan epitomizes what it 
means to be a good attorney, a good fa-
ther, and a good friend—really the best 
of Delaware, an immeasurably decent 
and kind person. 
Along with so many in our State, 
Annie and I wish him and his family 
the best in retirement. To Brendan, as 
the old Irish blessing goes: ‘‘May good 
luck be your friend in whatever you do 
and may trouble be always a stranger 
to you.’’ 
For your extraordinary dedication to 
advancing justice in the State of Dela-
ware, for all of the people whose lives 
you have positively impacted, and for 
the decades of service and sacrifice: 
Thank you.∑

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to print my bill for 
introduction 
in 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. The bill’s purpose is to des-
ignate 
the

S. 2771 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Colonel Charles Powell and his wife, 
Mrs. JoAnne Powell, served the community 
of San Angelo, Texas, with character and 
dignity. 
(2) Colonel Powell served as the base com-
mander of Goodfellow Air Force Base from 
1980 to 1984. 
(3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, 
Charles was ordered to help Goodfellow avoid 
closure and the displacement of many mem-
bers of the Armed Forces from the commu-
nity they had grown to love. 
(4) The impact of Charles’ career can still 
be felt today at Goodfellow Air Force Base, 
as it serves as a training school for thou-
sands of members from every Armed Force 
to train in cryptology, intelligence, and fire-
fighting. 
(5) JoAnne assisted thousands of constitu-
ents in the district offices of Representatives 
Tom Loeffler, Lamar Smith, K. Michael Con-
away, and August Pfluger. 
(6) One of the several duties JoAnne spear-
headed was the annual process of nomina-
tions to the military service academies, 
which was always a year-round process for 
her. 
(7) With JoAnne’s assistance, many of the 
young men and women of the 11th congres-
sional district of Texas went on to serve the 
United States and attend one of the military 
service academies. 
(8) In addition, JoAnne was a fierce advo-
cate of veterans and helped thousands of in-
dividuals gain access to the veterans benefits 
they rightfully earned. 
(9) JoAnne’s compassion and dedication 
helped make the Concho Valley a better 
place.

By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and 
Mr. TILLIS): 
S. 2773. A bill to amend the Leahy- 
Smith America Invents Act to address 
satellite offices of the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, innova-
tion is the lifeblood of the American 
economy. Thanks to our Founders, our 
Constitution anticipated the power of 
innovation and enshrined the basic 
idea that inventors should be given the 
incentive to do what they do best. The 
intellectual property clause has pushed 
the United States to be the long-
standing global leader in innovation. 
Unfortunately, like too many other as-
pects of our society, the benefits of our 
innovation ecosystem have not been 
equally felt by Americans from all 
backgrounds. Today, I am proud to in-
troduce 
the 
bipartisan 
Unleashing 
American Innovators Act, legislation 
that will make the patent system more 
accessible to Americans from all back-
grounds and ensure that we do more to 
harness the untapped potential that ex-
ists in our country. 
The Unleashing American Innovators 
Act builds on a legacy of broadening 
access to the patent system that I am 
particularly proud of. Ten years ago 
last week, Congress passed the Leahy- 
Smith America Invents Act, which was 
the most significant update to our pat-
ent laws in nearly sixty years. Under 
the Leahy-Smith Act, we created a net-
work of U.S. Patent and Trademark Of-
fice (PTO) satellite offices around the 
country, bringing the PTO closer to 
where Americans actually innovate. 
We lowered fees for small businesses 
and created a new micro-entity status 
to lower fees even further. We also cre-
ated a Patent Pro Bono program to 
help make legal resources more acces-
sible to prospective inventors. 
Now is the time to build on that suc-
cess. 
The 
Unleashing 
American 
Innovators Act will further boost ac-
cess to the patent system for underrep-
resented groups by explicitly directing 
existing PTO satellite offices to reach 
out to those who are underrepresented 
in in patent filings. A recent PTO 
study found that only twenty-two per-
cent of U.S. patents list a woman as an 
inventor, even though women make up 
more than fifty percent of our popu-
lation. Other studies have found that 
African Americans apply for patents at 
about half the rate of white Americans. 
We need to boost participation from in-
ventors in rural areas like Vermont as 
well. Congress must do more to ensure 
that these and other underrepresented 
groups have the opportunity to partici-
pate in the system. 
This bill will go further than our ef-
forts ten years ago by requiring the 
PTO to study whether additional sat-
ellite offices are needed to increase 
participation in the system by women, 
people of color, military veterans, indi-
vidual inventors, and any other groups 
that are currently underrepresented. It 
will also create a network of smaller 
community outreach offices, which 
will do the hard work of meeting pro-
spective innovators where they live. 
These offices will partner with local 
community organizations to create 
community-based programs to educate 
Americans about the patent system 
and the benefits of innovation and en-
trepreneurship. One such office will be 
located in northern New England so 
that it can help provide assistance to 
inventors in Vermont. 
The Unleashing American Innovators 
Act will also establish a patentability 
assessment pilot program to assist 
first-time prospective inventors in de-
termining whether an idea they have is 
likely to meet the threshold for patent-
ability. It will give the PTO study the 
efficacy of the Patent Pro Bono Pro-
gram to ensure that it is meeting the 
needs of underrepresented groups. Fi-
nally, it will further reduce application 
fees for small businesses and micro en-
tities to reduce the costs of obtaining a 
patent. 
By building on the structures we put 
in place in the Leahy-Smith Act ten 
years ago, we can ensure that the next 
generation of innovators in America 
reflect the full potential of our great-
est natural resource—the genius of the 
American people. I am proud to partner 
with Senator TILLIS on this important 
piece of legislation. Expanding access 
to the patent system is not a partisan 
issue; it is an issue of maintaining 
American competitiveness and extend-
ing opportunity to all Americans, no 
matter their background, economic 
status, or location. I urge the Senate 
to act swiftly to pass this bill. 
By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and 
Mr. TILLIS): 
S. 2774. A bill to amend title 35, 
United States Code, to address patent 
ownership, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. One of 
the fundamental underpinning of the 
patent system is transparency. In ex-
change for obtaining limited exclusive 
rights over their inventions, inventors 
disclose those inventions to the public, 
making transparent something that 
might otherwise remain secret. This 
transparency has tremendous benefits 
for our society by accelerating innova-
tion, and the patent system as a whole 
helps to drive our economy. I have 
fought for many years to bring even 
more transparency into the patent sys-
tem to further benefit the public, par-
ticularly by pushing for public disclo-
sure of who actually owns a patent. 
I am proud today to continue my 
partnership with Senator TILLIS on in-
tellectual property issues by intro-
ducing the bipartisan Pride in Patent 
Ownership Act, which requires patent 
owners to disclose their true identity 
when a patent is issued and when it is 
sold. I have long supported efforts in 
the Senate to achieve this goal and am 
excited to spearhead this effort now. 
The American people—any of whom 
may be charged with infringing a given 
patent—have a right to know who owns 
a patent, which often changes hands 
after being issued to the initial inven-
tor. Currently, to know who owns a 
patent, you have to engage in costly, 
time-consuming litigation to uncover 
that 
information. 
That 
simply 
shouldn’t be the case. This bill helps to 
ensure a fair innovation system for 
small businesses, non-profits, and inde-
pendent entrepreneurs who lack the re-
sources to engage in costly litigation 
just to discover who possesses exclu-
sive patent rights over a particular in-
vention. 
Transparency in patent ownership 
will also help us better understand how 
we are doing in the global competition 
for innovation. Currently, a whopping 
52% of U.S. patents are issued to for-
eign applicants. But there is no sys-
tematic way to track ownership of U.S 
patents, including when patents are 
sold to foreign entities. And Chinese 
companies like Huawei—which often 
serve as proxies for the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party—are 
wielding 
patent 
portfolios of unknown size and scope in 
the United States. 
Although we do not know what spe-
cific patents Huawei owns, in the last 
two years, it claims to have received 
an estimated $1.2 to $1.3 billion in pat-
ent licensing fees, and it is likely that 
most of those licensing fees come from 
Americans, based on U.S. patents. Fur-
thermore, Huawei’s patents cover fun-
damental technologies that will power 
our global future, such as the 50 mobile 
network. Its dominance over these cut-
ting-edge technologies unquestionably 
advantages China and disadvantages 
America. It is imperative, both for our 
innovation economy and national secu-
rity, to know who owns what patents 
and who is profiting. 
Senator TILLIS and I feel strongly 
about transparency in patent owner-
ship. We initially proposed this bill as 
an amendment to the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act earlier this Con-
gress, and it was cleared by the Chair 
and Ranking Member of the full Judici-
ary Committee for inclusion in that 
bill’s manager’s package that ulti-
mately failed. We have since received 
feedback from a wide spectrum of 
stakeholders, whose input we have 
worked hard to incorporate. As Chair-
man of the Senate’s Intellectual Prop-
erty Subcommittee, I will continue to 
utilize all of our Subcommittee’s tools 
along with Ranking Member TILLIS to 
improve transparency around patent 
ownership. This bill is an essential 
next step in that process, and I urge 
the Senate to act swiftly to pass it.

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources: 
S. RES. 373 
Whereas, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane 
Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico; 
Whereas Puerto Rico and the United 
States Virgin Islands were still recovering 
from a direct hit by Hurricane Irma when 
Hurricane Maria made landfall just 14 days 
later; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2021, the people 
of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin 
Islands living on the islands, as well as those 
living in the mainland United States, will 
commemorate the 4-year anniversary of Hur-
ricane Maria; 
Whereas, after the Great Galveston Hurri-
cane of 1900, Hurricane Maria is the second 
deadliest storm recorded in United States 
history; 
Whereas the people of Puerto Rico and the 
United States Virgin Islands living in both 
the mainland United States and on the is-
lands of Puerto Rico and the United States 
Virgin Islands have shown an incredible and 
resilient spirit in rebuilding after their 
record losses; 
Whereas Puerto Rico faced one of the long-
est blackouts in United States history, dur-
ing which millions of residents were left 
without power and basic services for nearly a 
year, triggering crises of physical and men-
tal health, migration, housing, and infra-
structure; 
Whereas, 4 years since Hurricane Maria 
made landfall in Puerto Rico, the electrical 
grid in Puerto Rico remains unreliable, leav-
ing millions of people without a secure 
source of power as they suffer intermittent 
brownouts and blackouts; 
Whereas, due to the impacts of Hurricanes 
Maria and Irma, thousands of people in Puer-
to Rico and the United States Virgin Islands 
still have blue tarps over their roofs; 
Whereas, as a result of Hurricane Maria, 
hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans were 
uprooted, and some Puerto Ricans have relo-
cated to the mainland United States; 
Whereas, due to unaddressed damage to 
homes in Puerto Rico, hundreds of Puerto 
Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria con-
tinue to need housing assistance from the 
territorial government and the Federal Gov-
ernment; 
Whereas the economic health of Puerto 
Rico continues to waiver as the preexisting 
debt crisis was exacerbated by the impact of 
Hurricane Maria; 
Whereas Hurricane Maria is the third most 
costly tropical cyclone in United States his-
tory, 
with 
damages 
estimated 
at 
$98,100,000,000; 
Whereas the Federal Government has allo-
cated approximately $71,000,000,000 in dis-
aster-relief funding to help the people of 
Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Is-
lands rebuild from other disasters that have 
impacted the islands since Hurricane Maria; 
Whereas, in Puerto Rico, the official death 
toll from Hurricane Maria stands at 2,975 vic-
tims, although some academic estimates 
place the toll at 4,645; 
Whereas 
many 
of 
the 
underlying 
vulnerabilities contributing to the massive 
death toll in Puerto Rico are still present, 
including an underfunded healthcare system 
and a shortage of medical physicians and 
specialists; 
Whereas the residents of Vieques, Puerto 
Rico, which number more than 8,000, lost the 
primary hospital and do not have an ade-
quate and comprehensive healthcare facility; 
Whereas, in a September 2020 report, the 
Office of the Inspector General of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security found that the 
Federal Emergency and Management Agency 
(in this preamble referred to as ‘‘FEMA’’) 
mismanaged the distribution of commodities 
in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 
Puerto Rico; 
Whereas FEMA lost visibility of approxi-
mately 38 percent of its commodity ship-
ments to Puerto Rico, worth an estimated 
$257,000,000; 
Whereas, in an April 2021 report, the Office 
of the Inspector General of the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development found 
that the administration of President Donald 
Trump created bureaucratic hurdles that de-
layed approximately $20,000,000,000 in hurri-
cane disaster recovery and mitigation funds 
to Puerto Rico; 
Whereas Puerto Rico and the United 
States Virgin Islands continue to battle with 
climate change, which has intensified trop-
ical cyclones, rising temperatures, coastal 
erosion, droughts, and flash floods, among 
other climate events; 
Whereas Puerto Rico continues to address 
and respond to other disasters, including the 
earthquakes of 2020 and the COVID–19 pan-
demic; and 
Whereas millions of Puerto Ricans and Vir-
gin Islanders still grapple with the physical, 
emotional, and economic damages caused by 
Hurricanes Maria and Irma: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) remains steadfast in its commitment to 
the people of Puerto Rico and the United 
States Virgin Islands to assist in restoring 
the islands to their full potential; and 
(2) resolutely assures that it will not aban-
don the plight of— 
(A) the millions of citizens of the United

September 21, 2021 
WYDEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 374 
Whereas estuary regions cover only 13 per-
cent of the land area in the continental 
United States but contain nearly 43 percent 
of the population, 40 percent of the jobs, and 
nearly 50 percent of the economic output of 
the United States; 
Whereas the oceans, estuaries, and Great 
Lakes of the United States continue to fuel 
economic growth across the United States, 
which is evidenced by the fact that, by 2016— 
(1) employment levels in economic sectors 
relating to oceans and estuaries had in-
creased by 14.5 percent from employment 
levels in those sectors in 2007, before the 
Great Recession; and 
(2) the average employment level of the en-
tire economy of the United States had in-
creased by 4.8 percent from that employment 
level in 2007, before the Great Recession; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2016, economic 
sectors relating to estuaries, oceans, and 
Great Lakes in the United States— 
(1) created 85,000 new jobs; 
(2) employed 3,300,000 individuals; and 
(3) contributed $124,000,000,000 to the gross 
domestic product of the United States; 
Whereas, by 2018, the ocean economy sup-
ported 2,300,000 jobs in the United States, and 
the compensation paid to employees in such 
sector was $161,900,000,000; 
Whereas the commercial and recreational 
fishing industries support more than 1,740,000 
jobs in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2017— 
(1) commercial and recreational saltwater 
fishing in the United States generated more 
than $244,000,000,000 in sales and contributed 
$110,700,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
(2) angler trip expenditures totaled nearly 
$10,500,000,000; and 
(3) saltwater recreational fishing supported 
487,000 jobs, generated $73,800,000,000 in sales 
across the United States, and contributed 
$41,500,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats 
for— 
(1) countless species of fish and wildlife, in-
cluding more than 68 percent of the commer-
cial fish catch in the United States by value 
and 80 percent of the recreational fish catch 
in the United States by weight; and 
(2) many species that are listed as threat-
ened or endangered species; 
Whereas estuaries provide critical eco-
system services that protect human health 
and public safety, including water filtration, 
flood control, shoreline stabilization, erosion 
prevention, and the protection of coastal 
communities during hurricanes, storms, and 
other extreme weather events; 
Whereas, by the 1980s, the United States 
had already lost more than 50 percent of the 
wetlands that existed in the original 13 colo-
nies; 
Whereas some bays in the United States 
that were once filled with fish and oysters 
have become dead zones filled with excess 
nutrients, chemical waste, and marine de-
bris; 
Whereas harmful algal blooms are hurting 
fish, wildlife, and human health and are 
causing serious ecological and economic 
harm to some estuaries; 
Whereas changes in sea levels can affect 
estuarine water quality and estuarine habi-
tats; 
Whereas section 320 of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330) (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Clean Water Act’’) au-
thorizes the development of comprehensive 
conservation and management plans to en-
sure that the designated uses of estuaries are 
protected and to restore and maintain— 
(1) the chemical, physical, and biological 
integrity of estuaries; 
(2) water quality; 
(3) a balanced indigenous population of 
shellfish, fish, and wildlife; and 
(4) recreational activities in estuaries; 
Whereas the Coastal Zone Management 
Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) provides 
that the policy of the United States is to 
preserve, protect, develop, and, if possible, 
restore or enhance the resources of the 
coastal zone of the United States, including 
estuaries, for current and future generations; 
Whereas 29 coastal and Great Lakes States 
and territories of the United States operate 
or contain a National Estuary Program or a 
National Estuarine Research Reserve; 
Whereas scientific study leads to a better 
understanding of the benefits of estuaries to 
human and ecological communities; 
Whereas the Federal Government, State, 
local, and Tribal governments, national and 
community organizations, and individuals 
work together to effectively manage the es-
tuaries of the United States; 
Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore 
natural infrastructure in local communities 
in a cost-effective manner, helping to create 
jobs and reestablish the natural functions of 
estuaries that yield countless benefits; and 
Whereas the week of September 19 through 
September 25, 2021, is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Estuaries Week’’ to increase aware-
ness among all people of the United States, 
including Federal Government and State, 
local, and Tribal government officials, about 
the importance of healthy estuaries and the 
need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 19 
through September 25, 2021, as ‘‘National Es-
tuaries Week’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Estuaries Week; 
(3) acknowledges the importance of estu-
aries to sustaining employment in the 
United States and the economic well-being 
and prosperity of the United States; 
(4) recognizes that persistent threats un-
dermine the health of estuaries; 
(5) applauds the work of national and com-
munity organizations and public partners 
that 
promote 
public 
awareness, 
under-
standing, protection, and restoration of estu-
aries; 
(6) supports the scientific study, preserva-
tion, protection, and restoration of estu-
aries; and 
(7) expresses the intent of the Senate to 
continue working to understand, protect,

VENEZUELAN WOMEN AND CHIL-
DREN 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. 
KAINE, and Mr. CASSIDY) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 375 
Whereas the Venezuelan refugee and mi-
gration crisis represents the largest recorded 
displacement crisis in the Western Hemi-
sphere, with over 5,400,000 Venezuelans dis-
placed outside of their home country as of 
November 2020; 
Whereas one-third of Venezuelans are food 
insecure, with the greatest impacts on chil-
dren, pregnant women, and the elderly, ac-
cording to the World Food Program; 
Whereas femicides in Venezuela have in-
creased significantly in recent years due to 
rises in criminal violence, intimate partner 
violence, human trafficking, endemic corrup-
tion, and lack of accountability for criminal 
offenses; 
Whereas the dire state of Venezuela’s pub-
lic health system, including extremely high 
maternal and infant mortality rates, has 
compelled women and girls to flee the coun-
try to give birth; 
Whereas a 2019 report from the United Na-
tions Population Fund stated that 95 in 
every 1,000 births in Venezuela from 2003 to 
2018 were to mothers aged 15 to 19; 
Whereas women and girls fleeing Ven-
ezuela face grave threats of sexual violence, 
exploitation, 
and 
trafficking 
by 
armed 
groups operating in border regions, such as 
the Eje´rcito de Liberacio´n Nacional (ELN). 
Whereas, after fleeing the horrors in Ven-
ezuela, Venezuelan refugees and migrants 
face additional challenges, including lack of 
access to safe shelter, jobs, documentation, 
healthcare, and increased restrictions on 
freedom of movement; 
Whereas governments in Latin America 
and the Caribbean participating in the re-
gional coordination forum, the ‘‘Quito Proc-
ess,’’ issued a joint declaration in November 
2019 committing to strengthen measures 
against human trafficking, gender-based vio-
lence, discrimination, and xenophobia, and 
to establish a regional protection protocol 
for Venezuelan refugee and migrant children 
and adolescents; 
Whereas, on February 8, 2021, the Govern-
ment of Colombia provided Temporary Pro-
tected Status to eligible Venezuelans in Co-
lombia—providing them temporary legal sta-
tus and work authorization for a period of 10 
years; 
Whereas, on March 8, 2021, the United 
States designated Venezuela for Temporary 
Protected Status and provided Deferred En-
forced Departure for eligible Venezuelans on 
January 19, 2021; 
Whereas the United States has committed 
to strengthen international protection of 
women and children through the United 
States Strategy on Women, Peace, and Secu-
rity, which aims to ‘‘promote the protection 
of women and girls’ human rights; access to 
humanitarian assistance; and safety from vi-
olence, abuse, and exploitation around the 
world,’’ as well as through the United States 
Government Strategy on Advancing Protec-
tion and Care for Children in Adversity; and 
Whereas the United States has prioritized 
addressing the issue of gender-based violence 
in humanitarian contexts by establishing a 
Safe from the Start initiative, implemented 
by the Department of State and the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses grave concern for the massive 
and growing humanitarian needs of Ven-
ezuelans, including over 5,400,000 Venezuelan 
refugees and migrants, with particular con-
cern for the impact of the displacement cri-
sis and the COVID–19 pandemic on women 
and children; 
(2) 
recognizes 
the 
many 
communities 
across Latin America and the Caribbean that 
continue to generously receive and host Ven-
ezuelan refugees and migrants while also 
fighting to recover from the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
(3) commends the efforts of the Govern-
ment of Colombia for granting Temporary 
Protected Status to Venezuelans, and calls 
on other refugee-hosting countries to con-
sider similar protections for Venezuelans;

Mrs. HYDE–SMITH (for herself, Mr. 
WARNOCK, and Mr. BRAUN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 376 
Whereas the last Sunday in September— 
(1) is designated as ‘‘Gold Star Mother’s 
Day’’ under section 111 of title 36, United 
States Code; and 
(2) was first designated as ‘‘Gold Star 
Mother’s Day’’ under the Joint Resolution 
entitled ‘‘Joint Resolution designating the 
last Sunday in September as ‘Gold Star 
Mother’s Day’, and for other purposes’’, ap-
proved June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895); 
Whereas there is no date dedicated to fami-
lies affected by the loss of a loved one who 
died in service to the United States; 
Whereas a gold star symbolizes a family 
member who died in the line of duty while 
serving in the Armed Forces; 
Whereas the members and veterans of the 
Armed Forces, through their service, bear 
the burden of protecting the freedom of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas the selfless example of the service 
of the members and veterans of the Armed

families of those individuals, inspires all in-
dividuals in the United States to sacrifice 
and work diligently for the good of the 
United States; and 
Whereas the sacrifices of the families of 
the fallen members of the Armed Forces and 
the families of veterans of the Armed Forces 
should never be forgotten: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 19

f 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, intend 
to object to proceeding to S. 2610, a bill 
to authorize appropriations for fiscal 
year 2022 for intelligence and intel-
ligence-related activities of the United 
States Government, the Intelligence 
Community Management Account, and 
the Central Intelligence Agency Re-
tirement and Disability Fund, and for 
other purposes, dated September 21, 
2021, for the reasons stated in the 
RECORD. 
Mr. President, I intend to object to 
any unanimous consent request relat-
ing to the passage of the Intelligence 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
(S. 2610), a bill to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2022 for intel-
ligence and intelligence-related activi-
ties of the United States Government, 
the Intelligence Community Manage-
ment Account, and the Central Intel-
ligence Agency Retirement and Dis-
ability System, and for other purposes. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have made every effort to promote 
greater awareness and flexibility for 
whistleblowers that wanted to bring 
their concerns to any member of the 
legislative branch. Unfortunately, this 
bill does the opposite, and it further 
codifies existing standard practices 
within the several intelligence agen-
cies to limit whistleblower access. This 
bill would allow whistleblowers with 
intelligence equities to bring their con-
cerns directly to Congress. But instead 
of allowing whistleblowers to bring 
their concerns to any Committee of ju-
risdiction, it limits the Committees a 
whistleblower can bring their concerns 
to only the House and Senate Intel-
ligence Committees. If the goal of this 
legislation is expanding whistleblower 
protections, 
then 
whistleblowers 
should be given more avenues, not 
fewer. This means allowing them to re-
port instances of wrongdoing to any 
committee of jurisdiction. 
I also have particular concerns that 
this legislation may inadvertently roll 
back protections for FBI employees 
that under current law, can bring their 
concerns to any member of Congress. 
Under the FBI Whistleblower Protec-
tion Enhancement Act, which Congress 
passed unanimously in 2016, FBI whis-
tle blowers can bring their concerns di-
rectly to any member of Congress. This 
bill would instead require FBI whistle-
blowers with Intel equities to bring 
their concerns exclusively to the Intel-
ligence Committees. 
In some instances this may be a good 
option for some whistleblowers, as well 
as the best way to protect national se-
curity. However, not all matters that 
are classified or that involve Intel eq-
uities 
are 
exclusively 
Intelligence 
Committee matters. There are issues 
that more appropriately fall under an-
other committee’s jurisdiction. For in-
stance, a matter involving Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance (FISA) Courts 
may be more appropriate for the Judi-
ciary committee; likewise a National 
Security Agency (NSA) matter may be 
better heard by the Armed Services 
committees. 
This would align with SSCI’s found-
ing documents which make it clear 
that its jurisdiction does not super-
sede, or take away from, any other 
committee’s jurisdiction. 
For these reasons, I request to be no-
tified before any unanimous consent 
agreement is agreed to regarding S. 
2610, as I intend to object unless the 
bill was joined with an amendment 
that would: 
1. Change the mandatory reporting to 
the House/Senate Select Committees 
on Intelligence to committees of Juris-
diction. 
2. Add a disclaimer that clarifies 
that, when codified, that this bill 
would not place additional restrictions 
on whistleblowers with intel related 
equities and that they retain all of 
their other rights under other federal 
whistleblower laws. 
f 
AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO 
MEET 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have

SALUD FAMILY HEALTH CENTER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate Salud Family 
Health Centers on their 51st anniversary. 
Salud Family Health Centers have been an 
integral part of the community for the past 51 
years. Originally known as, ‘‘Plan de Salud del 
Valle’’, or ‘‘the health plan of the valley’’, they 
began as healthcare providers to field workers 
in Fort Lupton, Colo. Over the years, they 
have grown significantly, opening numerous 
locations across the front range and Denver 
metro region. Since 1970, Salud’s commitment 
to people has remained their top priority. As a 
non-profit, 
Salud’s 
goal 
is 
to 
provide 
healthcare to those in the community that 
would not otherwise have access to afford-
able, quality health services. Throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the service provided by 
Salud has been invaluable for our community 
and my heartfelt appreciation goes to all the 
Salud staff and healthcare workers for taking 
such good care of our community during this 
difficult time. 
Congratulations to Salud Family Health 
Centers for 51 fantastic years, and I thank 
them for their numerous contributions to our 
community and state. We are lucky to have 
them in our community and wish them the 
best of luck in the coming years.

CONGRATULATING MEDFORD LEAS 
ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, l 
rise today to congratulate Medford Leas on 
their 50th anniversary. Medford Leas is a re-
tirement community with the mission of cre-
ating and advancing individual and community 
well-being for people aged 55 years and older. 
For the past five decades, Medford Leas 
has provided valued high quality residential 
and healthcare services to older adults. While 
the community began in 1971, Medford Leas 
can trace its roots back to 1911 when local 
members of the Religious Society of Friends 
created a low-cost boarding house for elderly 
women. 
Today, Medford Leas is a thriving commu-
nity with an arboretum, a fitness and low vi-
sion center, and provides residents with ac-
cess to adult college courses. While the com-
munity has expanded over the last five dec-
ades, Medford Leas continues to be guided by 
the teachings and beliefs of its founders; quali-
ties of peace and nonviolence, equality, and 
stewardship. These values are not only best 
personified by the daily interactions between 
staff and residents, but also when the commu-
nity took in twenty-one Japanese Americans 
who were interned during World War II. 
Since I was elected to Congress in 2018, I 
have had the privilege of getting to know 
many of the residents of Medford Leas and 
have participated in numerous events in their 
community—both in person and virtually. They 
are always willing to go above and beyond to 
be good neighbors and truly care about their 
own community and others less fortunate. It is 
truly an honor to be their Representative in 
Congress. 
On Medford Leas’ 50th anniversary, I ex-
tend my best wishes to every staff member 
and resident of the Medford Leas community.

CELEBRATING 
100 
YEARS 
OF 
SWEENEY 
CHEVROLET 
BUICK 
DEALERSHIP 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
wish the Sweeney Chevrolet Buick Dealership 
a happy 100th year anniversary. One hundred 
years ago, Gene Hopper founded Stearns 
Motor Sales Company with Arthur Sweeney by 
his side. Through developing long standing re-
lationships with both Buick and General Mo-
tors, Sweeney Dealership has become a trust-
worthy staple in the Youngstown community 
that expands four generations. 
Over their first 100 years, Sweeney has be-
come a symbol of car dealership excellence 
over the years. In 2017, they were chosen as 
the Chevrolet Dealer of the Year by Dealer 
Rater as well as once nominated for ‘‘TIME 
Dealer of the Year.’’ Not only that, 2020 
marked Sweeney’s fifteenth time receiving 
General Motor’s Mark of Excellence Award for 
2020. Despite the ongoing pandemic and the 
necessary changes to limit physical contact 
last year, their ability to reach this achieve-
ment is a testament to the level of care for 
their fellow neighbor. With only 10 percent of 
GM dealers receiving this award, Sweeney’s 
ability to win for the fifteenth time serves as 
proof for their level of excellence. 
Over the years, the dealership has also 
given back to the community that has gotten 
them this far. Sweeney has donated an esti-
mated amount of $200,000 dollars each year 
to the community, along with setting aside $50 
dollars from each car sold in the month of De-
cember in partnership with Operation Santa. 
We, therefore, recognize the Sweeney 
Chevrolet Buick Dealership on its 100th anni-
versary, and wish them all the best as they 
embark into their second century as a steward 
of the Youngstown community and the state of 
Ohio. 
MAKI DELAET 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Maki DeLaet of Wheat 
Ridge, Colorado for receiving the Wheat Ridge 
Business Association’s Member of the Year 
Award and the City of Wheat Ridge’s Special 
Recognition City Award. 
The Member of the Year Award is given to 
a member of the Wheat Ridge Business Asso-
ciation for their continued work both with the 
organization and the community as a whole. 
The Special Recognition City Award is given 
to a person or organization in Wheat Ridge 
who exemplifies outstanding service, leader-
ship, and participation in the community and 
aims to recognize them for their achievement. 
As President of the Wheat Ridge Business As-
sociation since 2018, Maki has contributed a 
significant amount of time to the organization 
and the larger Wheat Ridge community. Along 
with her work with the association, Maki is a 
successful leader in business with her com-
pany, EduCyber. 
Congratulations to Maki for her well-de-
served recognition, and I thank her for her 
contributions to our community.

RECOGNIZING THE RENAISSANCE 
VETERANS 
APARTMENTS 
AT 
FITZSIMONS IN AURORA, COLO-
RADO 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Renaissance Veterans Apartments at 
Fitzsimons in Aurora, Colorado, for receiving 
the 2021 Charles L. Edson Tax Credit Excel-
lence Award by demonstrating one of the most 
impactful uses of the Low-Income Housing 
Tax Credit—the primary tool to build new af-
fordable homes for the most vulnerable popu-
lations in Colorado and the Nation. 
As you know, our Nation’s lack of affordable 
housing has reached crisis levels in the wake 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. In Colorado 
alone, over 175,000 renters pay more than 
half of their monthly income on rent, leaving 
too little for other expenses like health care, 
transportation, and food, let alone education or 
retirement savings. 
However, using the Low-Income Housing 
Tax Credit, Renaissance Veterans Apartments 
built 59 new affordable homes in order to 
house and provide quality services to veterans 
who were formerly unhoused or are living with 
physical disabilities. 
I applaud the Colorado Coalition for the 
Homeless, National Affordable Housing Trust, 
Colorado Division of Housing, City of Aurora,

REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, Richard 
Trumka dedicated his life to elevating workers 
in America. During his tenure as President of 
AFL–CIO, he proudly represented the interests 
of more than 12 million union members, fight-
ing with unbridled passion and persistence to 
achieve fair hours, living wages, and better 
working conditions for all. Every American, 
union member or not, owes him a debt of grat-
itude for his tireless advocacy and commit-
ment to building a more equitable, more just 
workforce and economy. 
Richard was a remarkable leader. This is 
evident from the enormous legacy of accom-
plishment he leaves behind and by the respect 
he garnered from the people he worked with 
and on behalf of. I had the immense privilege 
of knowing Richard on a personal level. And 
as exceptional of a leader as he was, he was 
an equally exemplary person—one who was 
deeply committed to his family, his community, 
and his country. That kind of selflessness de-
fined Richard’s life and career—that same 
spirit will define his legacy, too. 
Richard was taken from us entirely too 
soon. And there are no words to ease the pain 
of this tragic loss, especially for his family and 
loved ones. But Richard will never truly leave 
us. His legacy will live on for generations to 
come, as a shining example of leadership and 
true public service. May his memory be a 
blessing.

KATE COOKE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kate Cooke of Wheat 
Ridge, Colorado for receiving the Wheat Ridge 
Business Association’s 2021 Special Recogni-
tion City Award. 
The Special Recognition City Award is given 
to a person or organization in Wheat Ridge 
who exemplifies outstanding service, leader-
ship, and participation in the community. Kate 
has exemplified these qualities and more with 
her work as a champion of small business. By 
helping to grow local small businesses, Kate 
has helped contribute to what makes Wheat 
Ridge unique while also benefiting our local 
economy and enhancing our community. 
Congratulations to Kate Cooke for her con-
tribution to the Wheat Ridge community and 
for receiving this award. 
IN RECOGNITION OF AVOCA BOR-
OUGH 
ON 
ITS 
SESQUICENTEN-
NIAL 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Avoca Borough, Pennsylvania 
as its residents celebrate its 150th anniversary 
of incorporation. 
On May 24, 1871, Avoca Borough, then 
known as Pleasant Valley, was officially incor-
porated after splitting from the nearby Pittston 
Township. Governed by three councilmen, 
Pleasant Valley was a booming community 
with four railroads, four churches, a board of 
trade, a school, and a fire company. 
In 1889, residents wanted to move the Marr 
Post Office to a more central location in the 
community. With another borough in the Com-
monwealth already claiming the name Pleas-
ant Valley, the United States Postal Service 
rejected their request, but the citizens were 
undeterred. They requested a name change to 
Avoca through the Luzerne County Court after 
the Avoca Hose Company. The court granted 
their request, and the name was officially 
changed. 
The twentieth century saw growth and pros-
perity for Avoca, and as the population grew, 
so did the needs of the community. In 1905, 
a group of Avoca’s most enterprising citizens 
met to discuss the need for a town bank, and 
on April 1, 1907, the First National Bank of 
Avoca opened on Main Street. In the early 
1920s, schools were struggling to accommo-
date the number of students due to a steadily 
increasing population. In 1925, the Avoca 
School Board finalized plans for a four-year 
high school building, which was completed in 
time for the 1926 school year. 
Avoca has always been home to patriotic 
Americans who valiantly served their country 
and sought to give back to their community. In 
1931, a group of ex-service members orga-
nized the American Legion McPhillips-WiddaI 
Post, and in 1946, Avoca veterans formed the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 8335. Both or-
ganizations supported civic and athletic pro-
grams in Avoca. 
Like many communities in the area, coal 
mining was the primary driver of the local 
economy. Many residents supported their fam-
ilies with careers in the mines, but the industry 
proved to be unsustainable. As the coal min-
ing industry began to decline in the 1940s, the 
Wilkes-Barre-Scranton 
Airport 
was 
con-
structed, which would become a flourishing re-
gional hub for travel throughout the Northeast. 
Through the 1950s, the anthracite coal mining 
industry continued its decline, forcing Avoca 
residents to relocate for more viable employ-
ment. 
Today, Avoca remains a tight-knit commu-
nity with thriving local businesses and a true 
small-town atmosphere. I am honored to join 
with Mayor Bob Mullen, Parade Grand Mar-
shals Chris Van Luvender and Bob Matthews, 
Anniversary 
Committee 
President 
Kelly 
O’Brien, and all the residents of Avoca in cele-
brating the Borough’s 150th anniversary. May 
the Borough continue to see growth and pros-
perity over the next 150 years.

HONORING JOHN AND TASHA 
HOLBEN AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor John and Tasha Holben, letter carriers 
for the United States Postal Service and proud 
union members, as Iowans of the Week. John 
has faced the rain, wind, heat, and snow for 
37 years to ensure the residents of Council 
Bluffs receive their mail in a timely manner. 
His wife, Tasha, has done the same for 17 
years. I am proud to honor their dedication 
and years of service. 
Working families like John and Tasha’s 
keep Iowa’s communities strong. They put in 
the hours every week to get the job done, 
serving their neighbors and advocating for fel-
low workers along the way. As letter carriers 
in southwest Iowa—where so many families 
rely heavily on the mail for critical needs like 
prescription drugs, income, and supplies for 
their small business—the impact of their ef-
forts is amplified. 
John and Tasha are long-time members of 
the National Association of Letter Carriers 
(NALC). John has been a member of the 
union his entire career, serving in various 
leadership roles for NALC Branch 314 such as 
president, officer, Sergeant at Arms, and now 
trustee. Tasha has also been an active mem-
ber of Branch 314 and has served in several 
officer roles. As active union leaders, they’ve 
helped bargain collectively for decent wages

and benefits, safe working conditions, and a 
fair shake not only for themselves but also on 
behalf of their union brothers and sisters’ fami-
lies. 
The Holben’s drive to serve their community 
goes beyond their day-to-day duties. John and 
Tasha enjoy volunteering at the NALC’s na-
tional food drive, which is held the second 
Saturday of May. Union members volunteer to 
pick up food and then transport it to local food 
pantries. Food pantries are always happy to 
see the influx of food in May, because often-
times they see a slump in donations following 
winter holidays. 
John additionally serves as a pastor at the 
Community of Christ Church in Council Bluffs, 
where he, Tasha, and the congregation help 
clean up their neighborhood every Earth Day. 
Instead of hosting a normal church service on 
the Sunday closest to Earth Day, members of 
the church walk around and pick up litter. 
They’re usually able to fill up several garbage 
bags as they clean up yards, streets, and 
sidewalks. 
As we celebrate Labor Day this week, I’m 
especially appreciative of John and Tasha, 
who have fought long and hard to maintain 
their union and ensure safe and reliable deliv-
ery of the mail to their neighbors. Through 
their activism and volunteer work, John and 
Tasha have made Council Bluffs a better 
place to live and work. Please join me in hon-
oring John and Tasha as our Iowans of the 
Week.

today to recognize the City of Wheat Ridge’s 
COVID–19 Response Team in Wheat Ridge, 
Colorado for receiving the Wheat Ridge Busi-
ness Association’s 2021 Special Recognition 
City Award. 
The Special Recognition City Award is given 
to a person or organization in Wheat Ridge 
community who exemplifies outstanding serv-
ice, leadership, and participation in the com-
munity. The COVID–19 pandemic had a pro-
found impact on our local community, the en-
tire country, and the rest of the world. The 
City’s COVID Response Team is comprised of 
city staff and community members, including 
Steve Art, Amber Garrett, Diamante Hornyack, 
Allison Lewis, Robin Lofton, Cindy Peterson, 
Allison Scheck, and Sara Spaulding. As the 
city dealt with an unprecedented pandemic 
and some of its darkest days, these men and 
women came to the aid of their community to 
help coordinate, develop and implement an ef-
fective and timely response to the various 
challenges and issues that have come up 
throughout the pandemic. 
I thank every member of the COVID–19 Re-
sponse Team for their hard work, dedication 
and sacrifice during this trying time, and con-
gratulations for receiving this award.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
IRIARTE WHITT 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of John Iriarte Whitt 
who passed away on Thursday, September 
16, 2021 at the University of Maryland Balti-
more Washington Medical Center in Glen Ber-
nie, Maryland. 
John had a decades long career in public 
service working as an important advisor to 
several of Guam’s key elected leaders over 
the years including Gov. Ricardo Bordallo, 
Gov. Carl Gutierrez, Congressman Robert 
Underwood, and Congresswoman Madeleine 
Bordallo. 
He was proud of his Chamoru heritage and 
was a longtime member of the Guam Society 
of America. He understood what it meant to 
be a Pacific Islander and lived his life serving 
others. He was a true patriot and was proud 
of his military service. 
As a graduate of the Air Force Academy 
and a B–52 Pilot, John had a tactical mind, 
which he put to good use developing political 
strategies and policy not just for the benefit of 
the people of Guam, but also for American 
Samoa and the rest of the territories. 
When I was first elected to Congress, John 
was still the Chief of Staff for Congresswoman 
Bordallo and was a great help to my freshman 
office. He was quick to volunteer his time and 
expertise not only with matters of policy, but 
with fostering a sense of camaraderie among 
the territorial delegation. 
His passing is not just a loss for Guam, but 
for the Pacific region at large. He will be 
missed.

REMEMBERING DIPLOMAT GEORGE 
S. VEST 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember and praise the contributions 
George S. Vest made to U.S. foreign policy. 
Vest had a long career as a U.S. diplomat 
during the Cold War. He died on August 24 at 
the age of 102. 
Among Ambassador Vest’s accomplish-
ments was representing the United States 
while initiating the 35-country multilateral diplo-
matic process that led to the signing of the 
Helsinki Final Act in August 1975. This proc-
ess continues to this day as the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or 
OSCE, based largely in Vienna with 57 partici-
pating countries. History records the U.S. ap-
proach to those negotiations, a Soviet initia-
tive, in late 1972 and 1973, as one of damage 
control, but Vest, his team and his successors 
did better than that. Working with our friends 
and allies in Europe, and engaging our Soviet 
and Warsaw Pact adversaries directly, they 
laid the groundwork for overcoming the East- 
West divide with a direct and frank dialogue 
based on a comprehensive definition of secu-
rity that included respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. At the time, addressing 
human rights issues in other countries was 
something diplomats hoped to avoid; over time 
it became recognized as essential to their se-
curity and developing relations. The negotia-
tions also produced confidence-building meas-
ures designed to lessen the risk of accidental 
war during a time of heightened tensions. 
Although neither Vest nor most of his fellow 
diplomats may have foreseen its potential 
value, their work eventually helped bring the 
Cold War to a peaceful end 30 years ago, and 
the OSCE continues to serve as a forum for 
addressing tension and instability in Europe to 
this day. 
Even in the darker days of the Cold War, 
this diplomatic process showed many coura-
geous human rights advocates—private citi-
zens—that they were not alone. It gave them 
the hope to keep fighting for a better world. As 
long as it remains true to its original Helsinki 
principles, it still does, and always will. 
As the Co-Chairman of the United States 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), better known as the Helsinki 
Commission, I believe it is important that we 
recognize George Vest’s early efforts. The 
U.S. Helsinki Commission was founded in 
1976 and has since helped to ensure that the 
multilateral diplomatic process Vest started re-
flects not only U.S. interests but those of any 
country—indeed 
any 
person—who 
values 
freedom and democracy. As the elections just 
held in Russia demonstrate, work still remains. 
George Vest was a combat veteran of 
World War II and later served in various diplo-
matic positions beyond those related to Hel-
sinki, including as advisor to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO), the State Depart-
ment’s liaison to the Defense Department, 
spokesman for the State Department Under 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, assistant 
secretary of state for European affairs, and 
U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Vest 
ended his career at the State Department as 
director general of the Foreign Service, recruit-
ing and selecting future American diplomats. 
Our debt to this fine public servant, and his 
legacy of promoting peace over decades, is 
boundless. I thank his living sons, George S. 
Vest IV and Henry Vest, for their father’s his-
toric service to our country.

HONORING EUGENE GUTIERREZ 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Eugene 
Gutierrez of Edinburg, Texas for his incredible 
commitment to the community of South Texas, 
his service for our country, and to celebrate 
his 100th birthday. 
Mr. Gutierrez was born on September 14, 
1921 and grew up in South Texas. He at-
tended Harlingen High School and, after grad-
uation, enlisted in the United States Army to 
pursue a career in engineering. However, after 
Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on 
December 7, 1941, Mr. Gutierrez’s military ca-
reer took a quick turn. 
Mr. Gutierrez began rigorous training with 
the First Special Service Force, an elite group 
of 1,800 troops from both American and Cana-
dian armies at Fort William Henry Harrison in 
Montana. They were later dubbed as ‘‘the 
Devil’s Brigade’’ by German opposition, in July 
of 1942. During his time fighting in World War 
II, Mr. Gutierrez was honored with numerous 
awards, including: two Bronze Stars, one for 
valor and the other for infantry combat, a Lib-
eration of France medal, a Good Conduct 
medal, a World War Two Victory medal, a 
First Special Service Force medal, and the 
Congressional Gold medal. 
Upon returning home from the war, Mr. 
Gutierrez went on to pursue a degree from 
Oklahoma State University and graduated in 
1950. He then settled in McAllen, Texas 
where he served as an educator, principal, 
and superintendent at McAllen Independent 
School District for 30 years until he retired in 
1980. Mr. Gutierrez continues to serve as an 
active member of the McAllen community 
through his work in the Sierra Club and as a 
parishioner at Our Lady of Sorrows Church. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the countless achievements of Eu-
gene Gutierrez. He dedicated his life to the 
betterment of his community and his legacy 
will no doubt inspire future generations to do 
the same. His military service, devotion to the 
community, and general love for life is admi-
rable. I thank Mr. Gutierrez, and wish him a 
happy 100th birthday. 
PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
MARTIAL ARTS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Personal Achievement 
Martial Arts of Wheat Ridge, Colorado for re-
ceiving the City of Wheat Ridge’s 17th Annual 
Business of the Year Award. 
Led by a persevering team, Personal 
Achievement Martial Arts was able to have an 
impactful year of education and training for 
local youth in the field of martial arts, despite 
the COVID–19 pandemic. They offer a wide 
array of programs spanning from preschool- 
aged children all the way up to adulthood. 
Personal Achievement Martial Arts strives to 
make an inclusive environment for every one 
of their students, and pass on their skills of 
self-defense on to eager learners. 
Congratulations to Personal Achievement 
Martial Arts for their contribution to the Wheat 
Ridge community and for receiving this award.

RECOGNIZING THE 234TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 234th anniversary of 
the United States Constitution, and to com-
mend the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion for their diligence in promoting this period 
of civic education known as Constitution 
Week. 
The United States Constitution is more than 
just an outline for good governance. It is a 
product of the greatest minds of its time. It 
stands as a written testament to our values as 
a nation; and, while many countries around 
the world have a constitution that establishes 
and organizes their government, our Constitu-
tion is different. Its predominate purpose is to 
limit the power of the federal government, and 
it encapsulates the most sacred of American 
values: that our government is, and will always 
be, accountable to the American people. 
I am reminded that our nation’s formative 
years were not without internal strife. Much 
like today, our founders were at a crossroad, 
and many wondered what form of government 
our fledgling nation would take. On September 
17, 1787, crowds gathered outside Independ-
ence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Constitu-
tional Convention had convened to decide the 
future of the country. As the delegates left the 
Hall that day, someone called out from the 
crowd, asking what kind of government we 
would have. Among the men leaving the build-
ing was Benjamin Franklin, one of the most 
esteemed figures in our nation’s founding. 
There, on the steps of Independence Hall, Mr. 
Franklin turned to face the inquiring voice and 
replied, ‘‘A Republic, if you can keep it.’’ 
Today we find our country again at a cross-
road. We must decide whether to maintain our 
foundational principles, or to tread down the 
path of authoritarianism. We can choose to 
hold fast to the values enshrined in our Con-
stitution, or to ignore them and risk losing our 
Republic. I am confident that our Constitu-
tional values and obligations will prevail in 
time. Through divine providence and the tire-
less efforts of organizations like the Daughters 
of the American Revolution, our obligation to 
the people has already survived over two cen-
turies, and will not easily be abandoned. 
On behalf of the 11th Congressional District 
of Georgia, and the United States House of 
Representatives, I earnestly commend the 
Daughters of the American Revolution for their 
efforts in preserving the legacy of our found-
ers, and the values enshrined in our United 
States Constitution.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Ridge, Colorado for receiving the Wheat Ridge 
Business Association’s 2021 Special Recogni-
tion City Award. 
The Special Recognition City Award is given

who exemplifies outstanding service, leader-
ship, and participation in the community. 
Vickie’s bakery, Grammy’s Goodies, has been 
a staple in Wheat Ridge for years, and has 
brought smiles to guests’ faces for as long as 
they have been open. The COVID–19 pan-
demic presented many challenges for and the 
local bakery but Vickie continued to serve 
local residents, even providing meals for front-
line workers during some of the worst days of 
the pandemic. 
Congratulations

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL AN-

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the centennial anniversary of 
the Richard Dingle American Legion Post 98 
in Saint Paul Park, Minnesota. Just as it has 
since 1921, Post 98 welcomes veterans into 
its membership ranks from all branches of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. Members are committed 
to fulfilling the Post 98 mission of imple-
menting the goals, aspirations, dreams, peace, 
and blessings for their country, friends, and 
families. 
On August 20, 1919, seventeen local vet-
erans gathered in Saint Paul Park to apply for 
a temporary charter in the American Legion, 
the fledgling national Veteran’s Service Orga-
nization which at the time was just one year 
old. Two years later, on July 2, 1921, Post 98 
applied for a permanent charter for the Rich-
ard Dingle American Legion Post 98 in honor

of World War I veteran Richard W. Dingle, a 
private in the U.S. Marine Corps, 5th Regi-
ment, 2nd Division who died during the Battle 
of Belleau Wood in France. To this day, Post 
98 upholds the important work of the Amer-
ican Legion to assist veterans and their fami-
lies finding careers, expanding their education, 
applying for health care and other benefits, 
and providing a supportive community for 
Saint Paul Park veterans. 
Throughout its history, Post 98 has been 
steadfast in service, not only to veterans, but 
to the entire community. You may find yourself 
at a baseball game where the American Le-
gion team is sponsored by Post 98, or at the 
Legion for dinner at the 328 Grill where you 
are likely to find families enjoying fun and 
games on the patio. You can also enjoy the 
Minnesota tradition of ‘‘booya’’ a rich stew 
cooked over an open fire, at the Legion’s an-
nual Booya fundraiser event, or stop by their 
Lenten Fish Fry each spring. Their long list of 
service work extends to all comers of the com-
munity, through donations to veteran’s organi-
zations like the Veterans Camp and Hastings 
Veterans Home, sending monthly care pack-
ages to active service members overseas, 
purchasing three fire trucks for the local fire 
department, donating school supplies, band 
uniforms and sports equipment to local stu-
dents, and even helping to build city parks. 
Post 98 is also home to the only Honor Guard 
in South Washington County, leading them to 
perform at 11 ceremonies each year on Me-
morial Day along with their service at vet-
eran’s funerals and other ceremonies. 
During the past year, Post 98 demonstrated 
true Minnesota hospitality and solidarity by ex-
tending a hand to union workers who were 
locked out of their jobs at the neighboring 
Marathon Refinery for more than six months 
during a contract dispute. Post 98 opened its 
doors to keep workers warm during bitter win-
ter months and hosted food drives for all 
members of the community. 
Led today by Commander John Dingle, Post 
98 continues to be a prominent member of the 
community as well as a leader in service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the members of the Richard Dingle 
American Legion Post 98 on its 100 years of 
service to veterans and the community.

HONOR FLIGHT OF OREGON 
HON. CLIFF BENTZ 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the Korean War veterans and Vietnam 
War veterans from Oregon’s Second Congres-
sional District who are visiting their memorials 
on the National Mall through Honor Flight of 
Oregon. When I have the opportunity to meet 
these heroes, I am reminded of the enduring 
words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who 
affirmed that ‘‘The history of free men is never 
really written by chance—but by choice—their 
choice.’’ 
The words he spoke then, Madam Speaker, 
still ring true today. Those who value liberty 
are indebted to these heroes, for each one 
made the choice to defend freedom through 
acts of extraordinary service and incredible 
sacrifice and bravery on behalf of our country. 
It is my privilege to include in the Record their 
names. 
The veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-
egon are as follows: William Baker, Air Force; 
Wendell Bayse, Navy; Harold Busch, Coast 
Guard; Charles Cruikshank, Army; Richard 
Dluehosh, Marine Corps; Roy Drago, Army; 
David Driggers, Navy; Garey Fritz, Army; Billy 
Gentry, Army; Richard Harley, Navy; Harl 
Hawkins, Jr., Marine Corps; Edmund Larios, 
Army; William Nunn, Army; John Pavllicek, 
Army; JeJy Peter, Army; James Prevatt, Army; 
Terrel Roberson, Army; Douglas Roberts, 
Army; Richard Thommen, Army; Gusravo 
Tovar, Army; Gregory Turnbow, Army: Gary 
Wishart, Navy; and Franklin Yates, Army. 
These heroes join over 240,000 veterans 
who have been honored through the Honor 
Flight Network of volunteers nationwide since 
2005. 
I would also like to recognize the volunteers 
and guardians traveling on this trip who have 
served our country: Donald Deland, Navy; 
Brian Driggers, Navy; Rodney Edwards, Army; 
James Hawkins, Army; Clinton McAuliffe, 
Navy; Dane Prevatt, USMC; Earl Schroeder, 
USAF; and Colben Keith Sime, USMC.; 
Madam Speaker, in his 1796 farewell ad-
dress, General George Washington said, ‘‘You 
have in a common cause fought and tri-
umphed together. The independence and lib-
erty you possess are the work of joint coun-
sels and joint efforts; of common dangers, 
sufferings, and successes.’’ As a nation, we 
must never take for granted the liberties we 
enjoy today, recognizing that these freedoms 
have been hard-won by the honor, commit-
ment, and sacrifice of our veterans. Each 
member in this chamber and citizen in these 
United States should be humbled by the cour-
age of the brave veterans who voluntarily un-
derwent ‘common dangers, sufferings, and 
successes’ in order to preserve our country 
and way of life. 
My colleagues, please join me in thanking 
these veterans and the volunteers of Honor 
Flight of Oregon for their remarkable service 
and devotion to our great country.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
GLORIA SMITH 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to remember the life of the won-
derful Gloria Smith of New Orleans. 
Or as she was affectionately known, Gran-
ny. 
Though we weren’t related by blood, she 
was still family to me. 
And to Granny, her family—her children, 
grandkids, and great-grandkids—were her 
world. 
She was born on February 28, 1935 in New 
Orleans, Louisiana to the late Willie Godfrey 
and Genevieve Francis. Gloria was the young-
est of two girls. 
In 1953, Gloria married her sweetheart, the 
late Frank Charles Smith, II. Together, they 
had nine children. 
My siblings and I grew up one block away 
from Granny, and her home was always a 
welcoming place bustling with people. 
Granny was witty and could always make 
you laugh. 
She brought a special type of charm and 
humor that was magnetic. 
She pulled you in and always knew how to 
lift you up if you were down. 
She radiated love. 
Granny never turned down an opportunity to 
dance. She knew how to have a good time 
and cherish every moment. 
She was a godly woman, and was very in-
volved in church and served in her children’s 
schools. 
Holidays, birthdays, and family gatherings 
will not be the same without her, or without 
her delicious homemade fried chicken and 
French fries, or gumbo, gravy and rice. 
Madam Speaker, please share a prayer for 
Granny and the entire family in this difficult 
time. 
Her favorite Bible verse was Psalm 118:24: 
‘‘This is the day the Lord has made; let us re-
joice and be glad in it.’’ 
She lived this truth every day of her eighty- 
six years, living life to the fullest. 
Everyone who knew her is blessed to have 
had her in their lives. 
I am lucky to count myself among them. 
We love Granny.

HONORING THE VICTIMS OF HATE 
CRIMES AFTER THE TERRORIST 
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
20 years ago, our country was shaken to its 
core during the terrorist attacks of September 
11th. 
9/11 was an attack on the very idea of 
America—on our freedoms, on our beliefs, 
and on our very way life. The response re-
quired courage, strength, and a sense of to-
getherness, and President Bush displayed that 
by going to a Mosque after these attacks as 
a message of peace and tolerance. 
Sadly, these attacks also led to a new type 
of terror for thousands of Arabs, South Asians, 
Muslims, Sikhs, and individuals from other re-
gions and religions. These individuals were 
targeted by violence and hatred because they 
were Muslim, or perceived to be Muslim. 
Twenty years ago, shortly after the attacks, a 
gas station in my district was the site of one 
of these hate crimes. A white supremacist 
walked into a Texaco Gas Station in Pleasant 
Grove, asked the clerk where he was from, 
and shot him in the face. 
Rais Bhuiyan survived the attack but was 
left sightless in one eye. Unlike his attacker, 
Mr. Bhuiyan showed courage following the at-
tack. He forgave his attacker and did all he 
could to prevent his execution, he even sued 
the state of Texas to prevent the loss of an-
other life. 
While we remember our friends, family, and 
neighbors who lost their lives on 9/11, we 
must also not forget the victims of hate crimes 
that also resulted from that attack. 
This is why I introduced a resolution yester-
day recognizing the 20th Anniversary of the 
9/11 terrorist attacks and honoring the victims 
of the hate crimes that followed. If we ever 
want to live in a world without hate, we must 
show tolerance, courage, and understanding 
rather than blind discrimination. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in honoring these victims 
so that we can look forward to a more peace-
ful and tolerant world.
