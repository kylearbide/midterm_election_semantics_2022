PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, we pause to approach 
You keenly aware that our business 
this evening is not to be the usual po-
litical discourse. Rather, tonight, we 
seek some sense of awareness of where 
we are, and look for direction as to 
where we should go as a Nation in 
these tumultuous times. In short, we 
wait in collective anticipation of an 
authoritative and visionary word. 
Remind us in this moment that the 
success of this Union is not to be found 
in prose or politics, but in Your Word, 
Your judgment, Your adjudication of 
our thoughts and the attitudes of our 
hearts. 
Redeem us from our own efforts and 
call us again as a country by Your 
name. May we take this opportunity 
today and every day that follows to 
humble ourselves and pray for our 
United States and its leadership. Then 
hasten us to listen and heed Your guid-
ance. 
May we seek Your face, turn from 
the ways that have threatened our Na-
tion, that you would hear from Heaven 
and forgive us our sins, and heal our 
land. 
In Your sovereign name, we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER. Members of Con-
gress, I have the high privilege and the

President of the United States. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
The PRESIDENT. It is good to be 
back. MITCH and CHUCK will understand 
that it is good to be almost home, 
down the hall. 
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice Presi-
dent—no President has ever said those 
words from this podium; no President 
has ever said those words, and it is 
about time—the First Lady—I am her 
husband—the Second Gentleman, Mr. 
Chief Justice, Members of the United 
States Congress and the Cabinet, and 
distinguished guests, my fellow Ameri-
cans: 
While the setting tonight is familiar, 
this gathering is just a little bit dif-
ferent, a reminder of the extraordinary 
times we are in. 
Throughout our history, Presidents 
have come to this Chamber to speak to 
Congress, to the Nation, and to the 
world to declare war, to celebrate 
peace, to announce new plans and pos-
sibilities. 
Tonight, I come to talk about crisis 
and opportunity, about rebuilding our 
Nation and revitalizing our democracy, 
and winning the future for America. 
I stand here tonight 1 day shy of the 
100th day of my administration, 100 
days since I took the oath of office, 
lifted my hand off our family Bible, 
and inherited a nation—we all did— 
that was in crisis: the worst pandemic 
in a century, the worst economic crisis 
since the Great Depression, the worst 
attack on our democracy since the 
Civil War. 
Now, after just 100 days, I can report 
to the Nation: America is on the move 
again, turning peril into possibility, 
crisis into opportunity, setback into 
strength. 
We all know life can knock us down. 
But in America, we never stay down. 
Americans always get up. 
And today, that is what we are doing: 
America is rising anew, choosing hope 
over fear, truth over lies, light over 
darkness. 
After 100 days of rescue and renewal, 
America is ready for takeoff, in my 
view. 
We are working again, dreaming 
again, discovering again, leading the 
world again. 
We have shown each other and the 
world there is no quit in America; 
none. 
One hundred days ago, America’s 
house was on fire. We had to act. And 
thanks to the extraordinary leadership 
of Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader 
SCHUMER, and with the overwhelming 
support of the American people—Demo-
crats, Independents, and Republicans— 
we did act. 
Together, we passed the American 
Rescue Plan, one of the most con-
sequential rescue packages in Amer-
ican history. 
We are already seeing the results. 
After I promised we would get 100 mil-
lion COVID–19 vaccine shots into peo-
ple’s arms in 100 days, we will have pro-
vided over 220 million COVID shots in 
those 100 days; thanks to all the help of 
all of you. 
We are marshalling—with your help, 
everyone’s help, we are marshalling 
every Federal resource. We have gotten 
vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies 
and over 700 community health cen-
ters, where the poorest of the poor can 
be reached. We are setting up commu-
nity vaccination sites, deploying mo-
bile units to get the hard-to-reach com-
munities. 
Today, 90 percent of Americans now 
live within 5 miles of a vaccination 
site. Everyone over the age of 16—ev-
eryone—is now eligible to get vac-
cinated right now, right away. 
Go get vaccinated, America. Go and 
get the vaccination. They are avail-
able. You are eligible now. 
When I was sworn in on January 20, 
less than 1 percent of the seniors in 
America were fully vaccinated against 
COVID–19. One hundred days later, 70 
percent of seniors over 65 in America 
are protected—fully protected. Senior 
deaths from COVID–19 are down 80 per-
cent since January—down 80 percent 
because of all of you. And more than 
half of all the adults in America have 
gotten at least one shot. 
At a mass vaccination center in 
Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurse: 
‘‘What is it like?’’ 
She looked at me and said every shot 
is like giving a ‘‘dose of hope,’’ was her 
phrase; ‘‘a dose of hope.’’ 
A dose of hope for the educator in 
Florida, who has a child suffering from 
an autoimmune disease. She wrote to 
me that she was worried about bring-
ing the virus home. She said she then 
got vaccinated at a large site in her 
car. She said she sat in her car when 
she got vaccinated and just cried— 
cried out of joy and cried out of relief. 
Parents are seeing the smiles on 
their kids’ faces, for those who are able 
to go back to school, because the 
teachers and school bus drivers and 
cafeteria 
workers 
have 
been 
vac-
cinated. Grandparents hugging their 
children and grandchildren instead of 
pressing hands against the window to 
say good-bye. It means everything. 
Those things mean everything. 
There is still—you all know it—you 
know it better than any group of 
Americans—there is still more work to 
do to beat this virus. We can’t let our 
guard down. But, tonight, I can say be-
cause of you, the American people, our

April 28, 2021 
progress these past 100 days against 
one of the worst pandemics in history 
has been one of the greatest logistical 
achievements this country has ever 
seen. 
What else have we done in those first 
100 days? 
We kept our commitment—Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans—of 
sending 
$1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of 
American households. We already sent 
more than 160 million checks out the 
door. It is making a difference. You all 
know it when you go home. For many 
people, it is making all the difference 
in the world. 
A single mom in Texas wrote to me. 
She said she couldn’t work. But she 
said the relief check put food on the 
table and saved her and her son from 
eviction from their apartment. 
A grandmother in Virginia, who told 
me she immediately took her grand-
daughter to the eye doctor—something 
she said she put off for months because 
she didn’t have the money. 
One of the defining images, at least 
from my perspective, in this crisis has 
been cars lined up for miles—and not 
people just barely able to start those 
cars; nice cars—waiting for a box of 
food to be put in their trunk. 
I don’t know about you, but I didn’t 
ever think I would see that in America. 
And all of this is through no fault of 
their own—no fault of their own, these 
people are in this position. That is why 
the American Rescue Plan is delivering 
food and nutrition assistance to mil-
lions of Americans facing hunger, and 
hunger is down sharply already. 
We are also providing rental assist-
ance—you all know this, but the Amer-
ican people, I want to make sure they 
understand—keeping people from being 
evicted from their homes, providing 
loans so small businesses could reopen 
and keep their employees on the job. 
During these 100 days, an additional 
800,000 Americans enrolled in the Af-
fordable Care Act when I established a 
special sign-up period to do that— 
800,000 in that period. We are making 
one of the largest one-time invest-
ments ever in improving healthcare for 
veterans; critical investments to ad-
dress the opioid crisis. And, maybe 
most importantly, thanks to the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, we are on track to 
cut child poverty in America in half 
this year. 
In the process, while this is all going 
on, the economy created more than 1.3 
million new jobs in 100 days; more jobs 
in the first 100 days than any President 
on record. The International Monetary 
Fund is now estimating our economy 
will grow at a rate of more than 6 per-
cent this year. That would be the fast-
est pace of economic growth in this 
country in nearly four decades. 
America is moving, moving forward. 
But we can’t stop now. We are in com-
petition with China and other coun-
tries to win the 21st century. We are at 
a great inflection point in history. We 
have to do more than just build back. 
We have to build back better. We have 
to compete more strenuously than we 
have. 
Throughout our history—think about 
it—public investment and infrastruc-
ture have literally transformed Amer-
ica—our attitudes, as well as our op-
portunities. The transcontinental rail-
road 
and 
the 
interstate 
highways 
united two oceans and brought a to-
tally new age of progress to the United 
States of America. Universal public 
schools and college aid opened wide the 
doors of opportunity. Scientific break-
throughs took us to the Moon and now 
to Mars, discovered vaccines, gave us 
the internet, and so much more. 
These are the investments we made 
together as one country, and invest-
ments that only the government was in 
a position to make. Time and again, 
they propel us into the future. That is 
why I proposed the American Jobs 
Plan, a once-in-a-generation invest-
ment in America itself. This is the 
largest jobs plan since World War II. It 
creates jobs to upgrade our transpor-
tation infrastructure; jobs modernizing 
our roads, bridges, highways; jobs 
building ports and airports, rail cor-
ridors, transit lines. It is clean water. 
And, today, up to 10 million homes in 
America and more than 400,000 schools 
and childcare centers have pipes with 
lead in them, including for drinking 
water—a clear and present danger to 
our children’s health. 
The American Jobs Plan creates jobs 
replacing 100 percent of the Nation’s 
lead pipes and service lines so every 
American can drink clean water. And, 
in the process, it will create thousands 
and thousands of good-paying jobs. It 
creates jobs connecting every Amer-
ican with high-speed internet, includ-
ing 35 percent of rural America that 
still doesn’t have it. It is going to help 
our kids and our businesses succeed in 
the 21st century economy. 
I am asking the Vice President to 
lead this effort, if she would, because I 
know it will get done. 
It creates jobs by building a modern 
power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to 
storms, hacks, catastrophic failures, 
with tragic results, as we saw in Texas 
and 
elsewhere 
during 
the 
winter 
storms. 
The American Jobs Plan will create 
jobs to lay thousands of miles of trans-
mission lines needed to build a resil-
ient and fully clean grid. We can do 
that. 
Look, the American Jobs Plan will 
help millions of people get back to 
their jobs and back to their careers. 
Two million women have dropped out 
of the workforce during this pandemic, 
2 million, and too often because they 
couldn’t get the care they needed to 
care for their child, or care for an el-
derly parent who needs help. 
800,000 families are on a Medicare 
waiting list right now to get home care 
for their aging parent or loved one with 
a disability. If you think it is not im-
portant, check out in your own dis-
trict, Democrat or Republican, Demo-
crat or Republican voters. Their great 
concern, almost as much as the chil-
dren, is taking care of an elderly loved 
one who can’t be left alone. Medicaid 
contemplated it, but this plan is going 
to help those families and create jobs 
for our caregivers with better wages 
and better benefits, continuing the 
cycle of growth. 
For too long we have failed to use the 
most important word when it comes to 
meeting the climate crisis: Jobs. Jobs. 
Jobs. For me, when I think climate 
change, I think jobs. The American 
Jobs Plan will put engineers and con-
struction workers to work building 
more energy-efficient buildings and 
homes, electrical workers, IBEW mem-
bers, installing 500,000 charging sta-
tions along our highways, so we can 
own the electric car market. Farmers; 
farmers planting cover crops so they 
can reduce the carbon dioxide in the 
air and get paid for doing it. 
Look, think about it. There is simply 
no reason why the blades for wind tur-
bines can’t be built in Pittsburgh in-
stead of Beijing. No reason. None. No 
reason. So, folks, there is no reason 
why American workers can’t lead the 
world in the production of electric ve-
hicles and batteries. I mean, there is no 
reason. We have the capacity. We have 
the brightest, best-trained people in 
the world. 
The American Jobs Plan is going to 
create millions of good-paying jobs, 
jobs Americans can raise a family on, 
as my dad would then say, with a little 
breathing room. And all the invest-
ments in the American Jobs Plan will 
be guided by one principle: Buy Amer-
ican. Buy American. And I might note 
parenthetically, that does not violate 
any trade agreement. It has been the 
law since the 1930s. Buy American. 
American tax dollars are going to be 
used to buy American products made in 
America to create American jobs. That 
is the way it is supposed to be, and it 
will be in this administration. And I 
made it clear to all my Cabinet people. 
Their ability to give exemptions has 
been strenuously limited. It will be 
American products. 
Now, I know some of you at home are 
wondering whether these jobs are for 
you. So many of you, so many of the 
folks I grew up with, feel left behind, 
forgotten, and our economy is so rap-
idly changing. It is frightening. I want 
to speak directly to you, because you 
think about it. That is what people are 
most worried about: Can I fit in? 
Independent experts estimate the 
American Jobs Plan will add millions 
of jobs and trillions of dollars in eco-
nomic growth in the years to come. It 
is an 8-year program. These are good- 
paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. 
Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure 
jobs created in the American Jobs Plan 
do not require a college degree. 75 per-
cent don’t require an Associate’s de-
gree. The American Jobs Plan is a 
blue-collar blueprint to build America. 
That is what it is. 
And it recognizes something I have 
always said in this Chamber and the

other. Good guys and women are on 
Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t 
build this country; the middle class 
built the country, and unions built the 
middle class. So that is why I am call-
ing on Congress to pass the Protect the 
Right to Organize Act, the PRO Act, 
and send it to my desk so we can sup-
port the right to unionize. 
And, by the way, while you are 
thinking about sending things to my 
desk, let’s raise the minimum wage to 
$15. No one, no one working 40 hours a 
week, no one working 40 hours a week 
should live below the poverty line. We 
need to ensure greater equity and op-
portunity for women. And while we are 
doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act to my desk as well. Equal pay. 
It has been much too long. And if you 
wonder whether it has been too long, 
look behind me. 
And, finally, the American Jobs Plan 
will be the biggest increase in non-de-
fense research and development on 
record. We will see more technological 
change, and some of you know more 
about this than I do. We will see more 
technological change in the next 10 
years than we saw in the last 50. That 
is how rapidly artificial intelligence 
and so much more is changing. And we 
are falling behind the competition with 
the rest of the world. 
Decades ago, we used to invest 2 per-
cent of our gross domestic product in 
America, 2 percent of our gross domes-
tic product in research and develop-
ment. Today, Mr. Secretary, that is 
less than 1 percent. China and other 
countries are closing in fast. 
We have to develop and dominate the 
products and technologies of the fu-
ture; 
advanced 
batteries, 
bio-
technology, computer chips, clean en-
ergy. The Secretary of Defense can tell 
you, and those of you who work on na-
tional security issues know, the De-
fense Department has an agency called 
DARPA, the Defense Advanced Re-
search Project Agency, the people who 
set up before I came here, and that has 
been a long time ago, to develop break-
throughs that enhance our national se-
curity. That is their only job, and it is 
a semi-separate agency. It is part of 
the Defense Department. It has led to 
everything from the discovery of the 
internet to GPS and so much more. It 
has enhanced our security. 
The National Institutes of Health, 
the NIH, I believe, should create a 
similar 
advanced 
research 
projects 
agency for health, and here is what it 
would do. It would have a singular pur-
pose: To develop breakthroughs to pre-
vent, detect, and treat diseases like 
Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. 
I will still never forget when we 
passed the cancer proposal in the last 
year I was Vice President, almost $9 
million going to NIH. And if you excuse 
the point of personal privilege, I will 
never forget you standing, MITCH, and 
saying to name it after my deceased 
son. 
It meant a lot. So many of us have 
deceased sons, daughters, and relatives 
who died of cancer. I can think of no 
more worthy investment. I know of 
nothing that is more bipartisan. So 
let’s end cancer as we know it. It is 
within our power. It is within our 
power to do it. 
Investments in jobs and infrastruc-
ture like the ones we are talking about 
have often had bipartisan support in 
the past. Vice President HARRIS and I 
met regularly in the Oval Office with 
Democrats and Republicans to discuss 
the American Jobs Plan. I applaud the 
group of Republican Senators who just 
put forward their own proposal. So 
let’s get to work. 
I wanted to lay out before the Con-
gress my plan before we got into deep 
discussions. I like to meet with those 
who have ideas that are different, that 
are better. I welcome those ideas, but 
the rest of the world is not waiting for 
us. I just want to be clear. From my 
perspective, doing nothing is not an op-
tion. 
Look, we can’t be so busy competing 
with one another that we forget the 
competition that we have with the rest 
of the world to win the 21st century. 
Secretary Blinken can tell you, I 
spent a lot of time with President Xi. I 
traveled over 17,000 miles with him. I 
spent over 24 hours in private discus-
sions with him. When he called to con-
gratulate me, we had a 2-hour discus-
sion. He is deadly earnest about becom-
ing the most significant, consequential 
nation in the world. He and others, 
autocrats, think that democracy can’t 
compete in the 21st century with au-
tocracies because it takes too long to 
get a consensus. 
To win that competition for the fu-
ture, in my view, we also need to make 
a once-in-a-generation investment in 
our families and our children. That is 
why I have introduced the American 
Families Plan tonight, which addresses 
four of the biggest challenges facing 
American families and, in turn, Amer-
ica. 
The first is access to good education. 
When this Nation made 12 years of pub-
lic education universal in the last cen-
tury, it made us the best-educated, 
best-prepared Nation in the world. I be-
lieve it is the overwhelming reason 
that propelled us to where we got in 
the 20th century, but the world has 
caught up, or catching up. They are not 
waiting. 
I would say, parenthetically, if we 
were sitting down, if we have set a bi-
partisan committee together and said, 
okay, we are going to decide what we 
do in terms of the government pro-
viding for free education, I wonder 
whether we would think, as we did in 
the 20th century, that 12 years is 
enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. 
Twelve years is no longer enough today 
to compete with the rest of the world 
in the 21st century. That is why my 
American Families Plan guarantees an 
additional 4 years of public education 
for every person in America, starting 
as early as we can. 
The great universities in this coun-
try have conducted studies over the 
last 10 years. They show that adding 2 
years of universal, high-quality pre-
school for every 3-year-old and 4-year- 
old, no matter what background they 
come from, puts them in the position 
to be able to compete all the way 
through 12 years, and increases expo-
nentially their prospect of graduating 
and going beyond graduation. 
Research shows when a young child 
goes to school, not daycare, they are 
far more likely to graduate from high 
school and go to college, or something 
after high school. When you add 2 years 
of free community college on top of 
that, you begin to change the dynamic. 
We can do that. 
And we will increase Pell grants and 
invest in historically Black colleges 
and universities, Tribal colleges, mi-
nority-serving institutions. The reason 
is, they don’t have the endowments, 
but their students are just as capable 
of learning about cybersecurity, just as 
capable of learning about metallurgy, 
all the things that provide those jobs of 
the future. 
Jill is a community college professor 
who teaches today as First Lady. If I 
have heard it once, I have heard it a 
thousand times. She has long said that, 
Joe, any country that out-educates us 
is going to outcompete us. She will be 
deeply involved in leading this effort. 
Thank you, Jill. 
The second thing is, the American 
Families Plan will provide access to 
quality, affordable childcare. I am pro-
posing legislation. We guarantee that 
low- and middle-income families will 
pay no more than 7 percent of their in-
come for high-quality care for children 
up to the age of 5. The most hard- 
pressed working families won’t have to 
spend a dime. 
Third, the American Families Plan 
will finally provide up to 12 weeks of 
paid leave and medical leave, family 
medical leave. We are one of the few in-
dustrial countries in the world. No one 
should have to choose between a job 
and a paycheck, or taking care of 
themselves and their loved ones, or 
parent, or spouse, or child. 
Fourth, the American Families Plan 
puts money directly into the pockets of 
millions of Americans. In March, we 
expanded a tax credit for every child in 
the family, up to $3,000 per child over 6 
years of age, and $3,600 for children 
under 6 years of age. With two parents, 
two kids, that is $7,200 in the pockets 
to help take care of your family. That 
will help more than 65 million children, 
and help cut childcare poverty in half. 
We can afford it. So we did that in the 
last piece of legislation we passed, but 
let’s extend that childcare tax credit at 
least through the end of 2025. 
The American Rescue Plan lowered 
healthcare premiums for 9 million 
Americans who buy their coverage 
under the Affordable Care Act. I know 
that is really popular on this side of 
the aisle, but let’s make that provision 
permanent so their premiums don’t go 
back up. 
In addition to my American Families 
Plan, I am going to work with Congress

this year to address other critical pri-
orities for American families. 
The Affordable Care Act has been a 
lifeline for millions of Americans, pro-
tecting people with preexisting condi-
tions and protecting women’s health. 
And the pandemic has demonstrated 
how badly it is needed. 
Let’s lower deductibles for working 
families on the Affordable Care Act, 
and let’s lower prescription drug costs. 
We know how to do this. The last 
President had that as his objective. 
We all know how outrageously expen-
sive drugs are in America. In fact, we 
pay 
the 
highest 
prescription 
drug 
prices in the world right here in Amer-
ica. We pay nearly three times for the 
same drug as what other countries pay. 
We have to change that, and we can. 
Let’s do what we have talked about 
for all the years I was down here in 
this body, in Congress. Let’s give Medi-
care the power to save hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars by negotiating lower 
prescription drug prices. 
By the way, that won’t just help peo-
ple on Medicare. It will lower prescrip-
tion drug costs for everyone. And the 
money we save, which is billions of dol-
lars, can go to strengthen the Afford-
able Care Act and expand Medicare 
coverage and benefits without costing 
taxpayers an additional penny. 
It is within our power to do it. Let’s 
do it now. We have talked about it long 
enough, Democrats and Republicans. 
Let’s get it done this year. 
This is all about a simple premise: 
Healthcare should be a right, not a 
privilege, in America. 
So, how do we pay for my Jobs and 
Family Plans? I have made it clear 
that we can do it without increasing 
deficits. 
Let’s start with what I will not do. I 
will not impose any tax increases on 
people making less than $400,000 a year. 
It is time for corporate America and 
the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans 
to begin to pay their fair share—just 
pay their fair share. 
Sometimes, I have arguments with 
my friends in the Democratic Party. I 
think you should be able to become a 
billionaire and a millionaire but pay 
your fair share. A recent study shows 
that 55 of the Nation’s biggest corpora-
tions paid zero Federal income tax last 
year. Those 55 corporations made in ex-
cess of $40 billion in profits. 
A lot of companies also evade taxes 
through tax havens from Switzerland 
to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands, and 
they benefit from tax loopholes and de-
ductions that allow for offshoring jobs 
and shifting profits overseas. 
That is not right. 
We are going to reform corporate 
taxes so they pay their fair share and 
help pay for the public investments 
their businesses will benefit from as 
well. 
We are going to reward work, not 
just wealth. We take the top tax brack-
et for the wealthiest 1 percent of Amer-
icans, those making over $400,000 or 
more, back up to where it was when 
George W. Bush was President, when he 
started, 39.6 percent. That is where it 
was when George W. Bush was Presi-
dent. 
We are going to get rid of the loop-
holes that allow Americans who make 
more than $1 million a year to pay a 
lower rate on their capital gains than 
working Americans who receive a pay-
check. We are only going to affect 
three-tenths of 1 percent of all Ameri-
cans by that action. 
And the IRS is going to crack down 
on millionaires and billionaires who 
cheat on their taxes. That is estimated 
to be billions of dollars by think tanks 
from the left, right, and center. 
I am not looking to punish anybody, 
but I will not add an additional tax 
burden to the middle class in this coun-
try. They are already paying enough. 
I believe what I have proposed is fair. 
It is fiscally responsible. It raises the 
revenue to pay for the plans I have pro-
posed that will create millions of jobs 
that will grow the economy and en-
hance our financial standing of the 
country. 
When you hear someone say that 
they don’t want to raise taxes on the 
wealthiest 1 percent and on corporate 
America, ask them: Whose taxes are 
you going to raise instead, and whose 
are you going to cut? 
Look at the big tax cut in 2017. Re-
member, it was supposed to pay for 
itself—that was how it was sold—and 
generate vast economic growth. In-
stead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. 
It was a huge windfall for corporate 
America and those at the very top. In-
stead of using the tax savings to raise 
wages and invest in research and devel-
opment, it poured billions of dollars 
into the pockets of CEOs. 
In fact, the pay gap between CEOs 
and their workers is now among the 
largest in history. According to one 
study, CEOs make 320 times what their 
average workers make. It used to be 
below 100. 
The pandemic has only made things 
worse. Twenty million Americans lost 
their jobs in the pandemic—working- 
and middle-class Americans. At the 
same time, the roughly 650 billionaires 
in America saw their net worth in-
crease by more than $1 trillion in the 
same exact period. Let me say that 
again: Just 650 people increased their 
wealth by more than $1 trillion during 
this pandemic. And they are now worth 
more than $4 trillion. 
My fellow Americans, trickle-down 
economics has never worked. It is time 
to grow the economy from the bottom 
up and the middle out. 
A broad consensus of economists left, 
right, and center agree that what I am 
proposing will help create millions of 
jobs and generate historic economic 
growth. These are among the highest 
value investments we can make as a 
nation. 
I have often said that our greatest 
strength is the power of our example, 
not just the example of our power. In 
my conversations with world leaders, 
and I have spoken to over 38 or 40 of 
them now, I have made it known that 
America is back. The comment I hear 
most often from them is: We see Amer-
ica is back, but for how long? 
My fellow Americans, we have to 
show not just that we are back but 
that we are here to stay and that we 
aren’t going to go it alone. We are 
going to do it by leading with our al-
lies. 
No one nation can deal with all the 
crises of our time alone, from ter-
rorism to nuclear proliferation to mass 
migration, 
cybersecurity, 
climate 
change, and, as we are experiencing 
now, pandemics. 
There is no wall high enough to keep 
any virus away. As our own vaccine 
supply grows to meet our needs—and 
we are meeting them—we will become 
an arsenal of vaccines for other coun-
tries, just as America was the arsenal 
of democracy in World War II and, as a 
consequence, 
influenced 
the 
world. 
Every American will have access to be 
fully covered by the vaccines we have 
for COVID–19. 
The climate crisis is not our fight 
alone, either. It is a global fight. The 
United States accounts for, as all of 
you know, less than 15 percent of car-
bon emissions. The rest of the world 
accounts for 85 percent. That is why I 
kept my commitment to rejoin the 
Paris accord because if we do every-
thing perfectly, it is not going to mat-
ter. 
I kept my commitment to convene a 
climate summit right here in America 
with all the major economies of the 
world, from China and Russia to India 
and the European Union. I said I would 
do it in my first 100 days. I want to be 
very blunt about it: My intent was to 
make sure that the world could see 
that there was a consensus and that we 
are at an inflection point in history. 
The consensus is if we act, we can save 
the planet, and we can create millions 
of jobs and economic growth and oppor-
tunity to raise the standard of living 
for almost everyone around the world. 
If you watched any of it—and you 
were all busy; I am sure you didn’t 
have much time—that is what vir-
tually every nation said, even the ones 
that aren’t doing their fair share. 
The investments I have proposed to-
night also advance a foreign policy, in 
my view, that benefits the middle 
class. That means making sure every 
nation plays by the same rules in the 
global economy, including China. 
In my discussion with President Xi, I 
told him we welcome the competition. 
We are not looking for conflict, but I 
made absolutely clear that we will de-
fend America’s interests across the 
board. America will stand up to unfair 
trade practices that undercut Amer-
ican workers and American industries, 
like subsidies for state-owned enter-
prises and the theft of American tech-
nologies and intellectual property. 
I also told President Xi that we will 
maintain a strong military presence in 
the Indo-Pacific just as we do with

NATO in Europe; not to start a con-
flict, but to prevent one. 
I told him what I have said to many 
world leaders, that America will not 
back away from our commitments—our 
commitment to human rights and fun-
damental freedoms and to our alli-
ances. I pointed out to him, no respon-
sible American President can remain 
silent when basic human rights are 
being so blatantly violated. 
An American President has to rep-
resent the essence of what our country 
stands for. America is an idea, the 
most unique idea in history. We are 
created, all of us, equal. It is who we 
are. We cannot walk away from that 
principle and, in fact, say we are deal-
ing with the American idea. 
With regard to Russia, I know it con-
cerns some of you, but I made it very 
clear to President Putin that we are 
not going to seek escalation, but their 
actions will have consequences if they 
turn out to be true, and they turned 
out to be true. So I responded directly 
and proportionately to Russia’s inter-
ference in our elections and the cyber 
attacks on our government and our 
businesses. They did both of these 
things. I told them we would respond, 
and we have. 
But we can also cooperate when it is 
in our mutual interests. We did it when 
we extended the New START Treaty on 
nuclear arms, and we are working to do 
it on climate change. But he under-
stands, we will respond. 
On Iran and North Korea, nuclear 
programs that present serious threats 
to America’s security and the security 
of the world, we are going to be work-
ing closely with our allies to address 
the threats posed by both of these 
countries through diplomacy, as well 
as stern deterrence. 
And American leadership means end-
ing the forever war in Afghanistan. We 
have, without hyperbole, the greatest 
fighting force in the history of the 
world. I am the first President in 40 
years who knows what it means to 
have a son serving in a war zone. Today 
we have servicemembers serving in the 
same war zone as their parents did. We 
have servicemembers in Afghanistan 
who were not yet born on 9/11. The war 
in Afghanistan, as we remember the de-
bates here, was never meant to be a 
multi-generational undertaking of na-
tion-building. 
We went to Afghanistan to get the 
terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We 
said we would follow Osama bin Laden 
to the gates of hell to do it. If you have 
been in the Upper Kunar Valley, you 
have kind of seen the gates of hell. We 
delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, 
and we degraded the terrorist threat of 
al-Qaida in Afghanistan. 
After 20 years of American valor and 
sacrifice, it is time to bring those 
troops home. Even as we do, we will 
maintain an over-the-horizon capa-
bility to suppress future threats to the 
homeland. But make no mistake, in 20 
years, terrorism has metastasized. The 
threat has evolved way beyond Afghan-
istan. 
Those of you on the Intelligence 
Committees, the Foreign Relations 
Committee, the Defense Committees, 
you know well we have to remain vigi-
lant against the threats to the United 
States, wherever they come from. Al- 
Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, 
Somalia, and other places in Africa and 
the Middle East and beyond. 
And we won’t ignore what our own 
intelligence agencies have determined 
to be the most lethal terrorist threat 
to the homeland today, white suprema-
cist terrorism. We are not going to ig-
nore that either. 
My fellow Americans, we have to 
come together to heal the soul of this 
Nation. It was nearly a year ago, before 
her father’s funeral, when I spoke with 
Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young 
daughter. She is a little tyke, so I was 
kneeling down to talk to her so I could 
look her in the eye. She looked at me 
and said, ‘‘My daddy changed the 
world.’’ 
Well, after the conviction of George 
Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right 
she was, if we have the courage to act 
as a Congress. 
We have all seen the knee of injustice 
on the neck of Black Americans. Now 
is our opportunity to make some real 
progress. The vast majority of men and 
women wearing the uniform and a 
badge serve our communities, and they 
serve them honorably. I know them. I 
know they want to help meet this mo-
ment as well. 
My fellow Americans, we have to 
come together to rebuild trust between 
law enforcement and the people they 
serve; to root out systemic racism in 
our criminal justice system; and to 
enact police reform in George Floyd’s 
name that passed the House already. 
I know Republicans have their own 
ideas and are engaged in very produc-
tive discussions with Democrats in the 
Senate. We need to work together to 
find a consensus. Let’s get it done next 
month, by the first anniversary of 
George Floyd’s death. The country sup-
ports this reform, and Congress should 
act. 
We have a giant opportunity to bend 
the arc of the moral universe toward 
justice, real justice. With the plans I 
outlined tonight, we have a real chance 
to root out systemic racism that 
plagues America and American lives in 
other ways; a chance to deliver real eq-
uity, good jobs, good schools, afford-
able housing, clean air, clean water; 
being able to generate wealth and pass 
it down through generations because 
you have access to purchase a house; 
real opportunities in the lives of more 
Americans—Black, 
White, 
Latino, 
Asian Americans, Native Americans. 
I also want to thank the United 
States Senate for voting 94–1 to pass 
the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act to pro-
tect Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers. They acted decisively. You can 
see on television the viciousness of the 
hate crimes we have seen over the past 
year and for too long. I urge the House 
to do the same and send that legisla-
tion to my desk, which I will gladly, 
anxiously sign. 
I also hope Congress can get to my 
desk the Equality Act to protect 
LGBTQ 
Americans. 
To 
all 
the 
transgender Americans watching at 
home, especially the young people who 
are so brave, I want you to know that 
your President has your back. 
Another thing: Let’s reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act, which 
has been law for 27 years. Twenty- 
seven years ago, I wrote it. The act 
that has to be reauthorized now will 
close the boyfriend loophole to keep 
guns out of the hands of abusers. The 
court order said this is an abuser. You 
can’t own a gun. It is to close that 
loophole that existed. It is estimated 
that 50 women are shot and killed by 
an intimate partner every month in 
America; fifty a month. Let’s pass it 
and save some lives. 
I need not tell anyone this, but gun 
violence has become an epidemic in 
America. 
Our flag at the White House was still 
flying at half-mast for the 8 victims of 
the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 
more lives were taken in a mass shoot-
ing in Colorado. 
In the week in between those two 
events, 250 other Americans were shot 
dead in the streets of America. 250 shot 
dead. 
I know how hard it is to make 
progress on this issue. 
In the 1990s, we passed universal 
background checks and a ban on as-
sault weapons and high-capacity maga-
zines that hold 100 rounds that can be 
fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. 
Mass shootings and gun violence de-
clined. Check out the report over 10 
years. 
But in the early 2000s, that law ex-
pired, and we have seen daily bloodshed 
since. I am not saying if the law con-
tinued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed. 
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose 
Garden, surrounded by some of the 
bravest people I know—the survivors 
and families who have lost loved ones 
to gun violence—I laid out several of 
the Department of Justice actions that 
are being taken to end this epidemic. 
One of them is banning so-called 
‘‘ghost guns.’’ They are homemade 
guns built from a kit that includes di-
rections on how to finish the firearm. 
The parts have no serial numbers, so 
when they show up at crime scenes, 
they can’t be traced. 
The buyers of these ghost gun kits 
aren’t required to pass a background 
check. Anyone from a criminal to a 
terrorist could buy this kit and, within 
30 minutes, have a weapon that is le-
thal. 
But not anymore. I will do every-
thing in my power to protect the 
American people from this epidemic of 
gun violence. But it is time for Con-
gress to act as well. I don’t want to be-
come confrontational, but we need 
more Senate Republicans to join the 
overwhelming majority of the Demo-
cratic colleagues and close the loop-
holes and require background checks to

purchase guns, and we need a ban on 
assault 
weapons 
and 
high-capacity 
magazines. 
Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We did 
it before, and it worked. 
Talk to most responsible gun owners 
and hunters, and they will tell you 
there is no possible justification for 
having 100 rounds in a weapon. 
What do you think, deer are wearing 
kevlar vests? 
They will tell you that there are too 
many people today who are able to buy 
a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to buy 
a gun. 
These kinds of reasonable reforms 
have overwhelming support of the 
American people, including many gun 
owners. 
The country supports reform, and 
Congress should act. This shouldn’t be 
a red or blue issue. And no amendment 
to the Constitution is absolute. 
You can’t yell ‘‘fire’’ in a crowded 
theater. From the very beginning, 
there were certain guns, weapons that 
could not be owned by Americans. Cer-
tain people could not own those weap-
ons ever. We are not changing the Con-
stitution. We are being reasonable. 
I think this is not a Democratic or 
Republican issue. I think it is an Amer-
ican issue. 
And here is what else we can do: Im-
migration has always been essential to 
America. Let’s end our exhausting war 
over immigration. For more than 30 
years, politicians have talked about 
immigration reform, and we have done 
nothing about it. It is time to fix it. 
On day one of my Presidency, I kept 
my commitment and sent a com-
prehensive immigration bill to the 
United States Congress. If you believe 
we need to secure the border, pass it, 
because it has a lot of money for high- 
tech border security. If you believe in a 
pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 
11 million undocumented folks—the 
vast majority who are here overstaying 
visas—pass it. If you actually want to 
solve a problem, I have sent a bill to 
take a close look at it. 
We also have to get at the root prob-
lem of why people are fleeing, particu-
larly to our southern border, from Gua-
temala, Honduras, and El Salvador. 
The violence. The corruption. The 
gangs. The political instability. Hun-
ger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. Natural 
disasters. 
When I was Vice President, the Presi-
dent asked me to focus on providing 
the help needed to address the root 
causes of migration. It helped keep 
people in their own countries instead of 
being forced to leave. 
The plan was working, but the last 
administration decided it was not 
worth it. I am restoring the program, 
and I asked Vice President HARRIS to 
lead our diplomatic effort to take care 
of this. I have absolute confidence she 
will get the job done. 
If you don’t like my plan, let’s at 
least pass what we all agree on. 
Congress needs to pass legislation 
this year to finally secure protection 
for Dreamers, the young people who 
have only known America as their 
home; and permanent protections for 
immigrants who are here on temporary 
protected status, who come from coun-
tries beset by man-made and natural- 
made violent and disasters; as well as a 
pathway to citizenship for farmworkers 
who put food on our tables. 
Immigrants have done so much for 
America during this pandemic and 
throughout our history. The country 
supports immigration reform. 
Congress should act. Let’s argue over 
it. Let’s debate it. But let’s act. 
And if we truly want to restore the 
soul of America, we need to protect the 
sacred right to vote. 
More people voted in the last Presi-
dential election than any time in 
American history—in the middle of the 
worst pandemic ever. That should be 
celebrated. Instead, it is being at-
tacked. 
Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send 
it to my desk right away. The country 
supports it, and Congress should act 
now. 
In conclusion, as we gather here to-
night, the images of a violent mob as-
saulting this Capitol—desecrating our 
democracy—remain vivid in our minds. 
Lives were put at risk, many of your 
lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary 
courage was summoned. The insurrec-
tion was an existential crisis—a test on 
whether our democracy could survive. 
It did. But the struggle is far from 
over. The question of whether our de-
mocracy will long endure is both an-
cient and urgent. As old as our Repub-
lic. Still vital today. 
Can our democracy deliver on its 
promise that all of us—created equal in 
the image of God—have a chance to 
lead lives of dignity, respect, and possi-
bility? 
Can our democracy deliver on the 
most pressing needs of our people? 
Can our democracy overcome the 
lies, anger, hate, and fears that have 
pulled us apart? 
America’s adversaries—the autocrats 
of the world—are betting we can’t. And 
I promise you they are betting we 
can’t. They believe we are too full of 
anger and division of rage. They look 
at the images of the mob that as-
saulted the Capitol as proof that the 
Sun is setting on American democracy. 
They are wrong. You know it. I know 
it. We have to prove them wrong. We 
have to prove democracy still works, 
that our government still works, and 
we can deliver for our people. 
In our first 100 days together, we 
have acted to restore people’s faith in 
democracy to deliver. 
We are vaccinating the Nation. We 
are creating hundreds of thousands of 
new jobs. We are delivering real results 
to people. They can see it and feel it in 
their own lives. 
Opening doors of opportunity, guar-
anteeing fairness and justice, that is 
the essence of America. That is democ-
racy in action. 
Our Constitution opens with the 
words, as trite as it sounds, ‘‘We the 
people.’’ 
It is time to remember that we the 
people are the government. You and I. 
Not some force in a distant capital. 
Not some powerful force that we have 
no control over. It is us. It is ‘‘We the 
people.’’ 
In another era when our democracy 
was tested, Franklin Roosevelt re-
minded us: In America: we do our part. 
We all do our part. That is all I am 
asking. That we all do our part, all of 
us. If we do that, we will meet the cen-
tral challenge of the age by proving 
that democracy is durable and strong. 
The autocrats will not win the fu-
ture. We will. America will. The future 
belongs to America. 
I stand here tonight before you in a 
new and vital hour in the life of our de-
mocracy and our Nation. And I can say 
with absolute confidence: I have never 
been more confident or optimistic 
about America, not because I am Presi-
dent, but because of what is happening 
with the American people. 
We have stared into the abyss of in-
surrection and autocracy, of pandemic 
and pain, and ‘‘We the people’’ did not 
flinch. 
At the very moment our adversaries 
were certain we would pull apart and 
fail, we came together. We united. 
With light and hope, we summoned 
new strength and new resolve to posi-
tion us to win the competition for the 
21st century on our way to a Union 
more perfect, more prosperous, and 
more just as one people, one Nation, 
and one America. 
Folks, as I told every world leader I 
have ever met with over the years, it 
has never, ever, ever been a good bet to 
bet against America, and it still isn’t. 
We are the United States of America. 
There is not a single thing—nothing— 
beyond our capacity. We can do what-
ever we set our minds to if we do it to-
gether. So, let’s begin to get together. 
God bless you all, and may God pro-
tect our troops. 
Thank you for your patience. 
(Applause, the Members rising.)

companied by the committee of escort,

vided. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, at the 
start of the year, the Senate Demo-
crats pledged that one of our top prior-
ities would be tackling climate change. 
I directed all of our incoming com-
mittee chairs to hold hearings and pre-
pare legislation on the climate crisis. I 
promised that any infrastructure bill 
would be green and focused on creating 
the green jobs of the future. Both of 
these efforts, I am happy to report, are 
well under way. 
And, today, as we approach the 100- 
day mark of this new Congress, the 
Senate will take the first major step in 
combating climate change on the Sen-
ate floor, by reinstating safeguards 
against methane emissions. 
Specifically, today’s vote will use the 
Congressional Review Act to reimpose 
commonsense 
regulations 
against 
methane leaks from the oil and gas in-
dustry, from production and processing 
to transmission and storage. 
And let me note that this would be 
the first time that the Senate Demo-
cratic majority has used the Congres-
sional Review Act. It is no mistake 
that we have chosen to use the law 
first on the subject of climate change. 
Under this Democratic majority, the 
Senate will be a place where we take 
decisive, ambitious, and effective ac-
tion against climate change. And this 
CRA, the reinstatement of the rule 
dealing with methane emissions, will 
be the most significant act that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2258 
April 28, 2021 
Senate has taken on climate change in 
more than a decade—and maybe sev-
eral decades. This measure will help us 
address the climate crisis in a very se-
rious way. 
Methane doesn’t get as much atten-
tion as CO2, carbon dioxide, but it 
packs a bigger punch. Over 20 years, a 
ton of methane warms the atmosphere 
86 times more than carbon dioxide. 
Thankfully, methane degrades faster in 
our atmosphere, and curbing methane 
emissions is relatively cheap. 
So when it comes to global warming, 
tackling methane delivers a huge bang 
for your buck. Even a little bit of 
methane reduction goes a long way, 
and it moves far more quickly than 
carbon dioxide reduction. So as we 
move on this bill, which will have its 
effect on global warming within a year, 
it gives us some time, although we 
don’t have much, to deal with the 
longer term and even more difficult 
issues of carbon dioxide. 
That is why President Obama put the 
rules in place nearly 6 years ago. And 
at the time, amazingly enough, even 
the oil and gas industry welcomed 
them. Industry doesn’t want leaks in 
their pipelines and production any 
more than we do. 
But President Trump, inexplicably, 
did away with these safeguards last 
September. It seems he does these 
things out of pique, mindlessly oppos-
ing something just because his prede-
cessor, Barack Obama, did it. It is very 
possible that the President didn’t even 
understand what he was doing. But he 
so often acted out of anger and vindic-
tiveness, not out of what was good for 
the country, that he ended up doing 
this. 
I am greatly looking forward to 
righting that wrong today, hopefully, 
in a bipartisan fashion. We have at 
least one Republican Senator who has 
joined us, and I hope that many more 
will follow suit. If the leaders of the oil 
and gas industry are for this, how could 
our Republican friends not vote for it? 
I won’t speculate on the reasons, but 
none of them are good. 
I want to commend my colleagues 
who have been leaders on this issue: 
Senator HEINRICH, Senator KING, Sen-
ator MARKEY. President Biden has 
challenged the United States to cut its 
greenhouse gas emissions in half by 
2030. The best way to achieve this am-
bitious goal is through bold action by 
this Congress, through legislation to 
reduce greenhouse pollution while cre-
ating millions of jobs and economic 
prosperity in the new clean energy 
economy. 
This is the first and a large step in 
that direction. We have many more 
steps we must take, of course. The Sen-
ate begins the important work of deal-
ing with the climate crisis today by 
passing these very, very significant, 
commonsense rules on methane. 
AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, this morning, President Biden 
unveiled landmark legislation designed 
to give American families a better 
chance to succeed in the 21st century 
economy, combining investments in 
education, childcare, and workforce 
training. 
The American Families Plan, as it is 
called, makes exactly the types of in-
vestment our country should have been 
making for a very long time. In many 
of these areas, the United States has 
lagged well behind other developed 
countries. 
Governments 
throughout 
Europe dedicate a significantly higher 
portion of their GDP to workforce re-
training and offer more flexible family 
leave policies. 
Some say these kinds of policies are 
not infrastructure, but they very much 
are. Childcare is a necessity in the 21st 
century, and a lack of access to 
childcare can be a throttle on future 
economic growth because it affects 
millions of American families. 
As technology and automation re-
place jobs in certain sectors of the 
economy, workforce training is a must. 
Giving our children a head start earlier 
in life with pre-K education has bene-
fits that span a child’s entire life and 
so will affect our country positively for 
decades to come, economically, so-
cially, and in renewing the American 
spirit, which is so important to our fu-
ture. 
These things are just as important. 
The kinds of policies that deal with 
human infrastructure are just as im-
portant as roads and bridges, which, of 
course, are, no doubt, important in 
their own right. This is not an either/ 
or—human infrastructure or brick-and- 
mortar structure. We must say yes to 
both. We don’t want to choose one 
versus the other. That is like choosing 
between children, both of whom we 
love. 
In the modern world, we need both 
infrastructure that matches a 21st cen-
tury economy and human infrastruc-
ture that allows our workers and fami-
lies to succeed in it. So I applaud Presi-
dent Biden for putting this plan to-
gether. It is just the right approach. 
I would add one final comment here. 
All of our Republican colleagues— 
every single one—regrettably, chose to 
oppose the American Rescue Plan, de-
spite the fact that a majority of Repub-
lican voters approved of the legisla-
tion. There seems to be a huge dichot-
omy between Republicans in Wash-
ington and Republicans in the rest of 
the country who approve of many of 
the policies in President Biden’s plans. 
Republicans in the rest of the coun-
try approved of the checks and invest-
ing in vaccines, and they approve of in-
vesting in infrastructure. I suspect 
many of these policies in the American 
Families Plan will get high marks as 
well. Childcare is popular. Early pre-K 
is popular. Early school-hood training 
is popular. Free community college is 
popular. The list goes on. 
Will our Republican colleagues start 
to listen to their constituents as well 
as the rest of the country, or are they 
still the party of Donald Trump, a 
party that opposes the other side at all 
costs? That is no good for America; 
that is no good for bipartisanship; and 
it is not even good for the Republican 
Party’s future. 
FIRST 100 DAYS 
Mr. President, now, tonight Presi-
dent Biden will address a joint session 
of Congress to mark the progress of our 
first 100 days and talk about where we, 
as a country, still need to go. I expect 
President Biden, unlike his prede-
cessor, will lay out the facts and appeal 
to our better angels. That is what he 
has been doing over these past 100 days: 
restoring respective, truthful, and re-
sponsive government. 
Almost as important is what Presi-
dent Biden is not doing. President 
Biden is not constantly stoking divi-
sion, outrage, and racial animus. He 
doesn’t fan the flames of every single 
culture war. He doesn’t seek to person-
ally dominate every single news cycle. 
He doesn’t insult, degrade, or con-
stantly lie. And it matters. 
Newspapers are littered with first-
hand accounts of Americans who feel 
they can finally sleep at night without 
worrying about what new scandal, out-
rage, or unhinged tweet the next morn-
ing would bring. As one Republican op-
erative put it recently, ‘‘Now there’s a 
sense of relief. Imagine there’s a car 
alarm that’s been going off for a long 
time and suddenly it’s quiet.’’ 
Politics is an important part of 
American life, but it is not meant to be 
all-consuming. It is not supposed to 
keep average citizens up at night. Poli-
tics is supposed to be where we come 
together to solve our differences ami-
cably, not an arena of endless partisan 
warfare or a bottomless pit of chaos. 
So as President Biden prepares to ad-
dress the Nation tonight, it is worth 
noting that, as much as we have ac-
complished in the first 100 days, the 
contrast in style, tone, and effective-
ness between President Biden and 
President Trump is important too. 
As we seek to repair the wounds left 
by January 6, as we seek to restore 
faith in government and in our democ-
racy, it is important—so important—to 
have political leaders who act with dig-
nity, honor, and have fidelity to the 
truth. 
I yield the floor.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, to-
night President Biden will deliver his 
first address to a joint session of Con-
gress. I will be there, and, like my fel-
low Kentuckians watching at home, I 
will be curious to hear how President 
Biden tries to square his rhetoric with 
the administration’s actions over the 
past 100 days. 
Back in January, many Americans 
hoped they could take the incoming 
President at his word. After a year 
spent beating back a historic pandemic

April 28, 2021 
and grappling with civil unrest, Presi-
dent Biden pledged he would be ‘‘a 
President for all Americans,’’ with 
plans 
to 
‘‘repair,’’ 
‘‘restore,’’ 
and 
‘‘heal.’’ 
The American people elected a 50–50 
Senate, a closely divided House, and a 
President who preached moderation. 
He promised that his whole soul was 
committed to uniting our people. Many 
hoped his administration would reflect 
that promise, but the first 100 days 
have left much to be desired. 
Over a few short months, the Biden 
administration seems to have given up 
on selling actual unity in favor of cat-
nip for their liberal base, covered with 
a hefty coat of false advertising. 
That is how the so-called American 
Rescue Plan, a grab-bag spending bill 
that directed less than 10 percent to 
vaccines and pandemic healthcare, was 
marketed as a COVID–19 relief meas-
ure. In actuality, it sent sums of 
money to State governments whose 
revenues had already rebounded and 
declared war on the formerly bipar-
tisan consensus that welfare spending 
should actually be linked to work. 
Or take H.R. 1, the sweeping effort by 
Democrats to mount a partisan take-
over of all 50 States’ voting laws, along 
with the Federal Election Commission 
for good measure. After a Republican 
won the White House in 2016, this was 
billed as a massive overhaul for a bro-
ken democracy. Now a nearly identical 
plan is, instead, being marketed as a 
modest dose of preventive mainte-
nance. It is still the same takeover it 
has always been. 
And now we have the American Jobs 
Plan, 
another 
multitrillion-dollar 
smorgasbord of liberal social engineer-
ing that would decimate entire indus-
tries and spend only a small fraction 
on roads and bridges. It is being sold as 
a serious effort to rebuild our Nation’s 
infrastructure. It is pretty brazen mis-
direction. 
At both ends of Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, Democrats have chosen to live in 
an alternate universe where both the 
campaign promises they made and the 
mandate the American people delivered 
were 
actually 
completely 
different 
than what happened right here on plan-
et Earth. 
Unfortunately, the real-life effects of 
this false advertising campaign have 
come thick and fast: pain and uncer-
tainty at home and dwindling leverage 
and virtue-signaling abroad. 
First came mixed messages on the 
status of the pandemic. Existing vac-
cine 
distribution 
efforts 
surpassed 
President Biden’s supposedly ambitious 
daily target on the day he was sworn 
in. 
When their own top health officials 
accidentally let slip the hard science 
on school reopenings, the administra-
tion bowed to Big Labor and walked 
back their comments. 
And the President continues to issue 
directives that are strangely out of 
step with the science, like his big an-
nouncement several weeks ago that, if 
citizens 
behave 
themselves—behave 
themselves—he would actually permit 
them to enjoy small outdoor gath-
erings on July 4th that the CDC guid-
ance already said would be safe right 
now. 
Then there is the environmental pol-
icy. On day one, President Biden 
rushed to cancel a pipeline project that 
would have employed thousands of 
Americans and freeze permitting for 
more safe, reliable domestic energy. He 
also announced an urgent return to an 
Obama-era deal that has proven unable 
to curb the signatories’ carbon emis-
sions and unnecessary for the United 
States to reduce our own. 
Why would he do that? Because the 
far left demanded it. In fact, the most 
radical liberals in Congress have taken 
credit for the input of their Green New 
Deal manifesto over this President’s 
new agenda. 
Meanwhile, Democrats have decid-
edly avoided taking ownership of the 
results of their own campaign rhetoric 
on immigration. Reckless mixed mes-
saging has come home to roost in the 
form of a humanitarian and security 
crisis on our southern border. Soaring 
numbers of migrants are arriving, some 
wearing Biden campaign shirts, con-
vinced, as one put it, that ‘‘Biden 
promised us that everything was going 
to change.’’ Among them are record 
numbers of unaccompanied children, 
cramped into overflow facilities, who 
have become the tragic face of this 
story. Yet through it all, the White 
House’s foremost concern seems to 
have been to avoid calling this what it 
is: a crisis. 
And while broken immigration policy 
threatens security at our borders, a 
dangerously misguided foreign policy 
threatens our safety and standing over-
seas. Years of carefully assembled mul-
tilateral sanctions had created an eco-
nomic straitjacket around Iran’s ter-
rorist state. But in its haste to turn 
the clocks back to the Obama era, 
President Biden’s negotiators have of-
fered to give up massive portions of 
this leverage just to get Iran back to a 
failed nuclear deal. 
Further east, American forces have 
been ordered to make a hasty, total 
withdrawal from Afghanistan; to leave 
coalition partners and vulnerable Af-
ghans high and dry, especially women 
and girls; to pave the way for Taliban 
rule; and to enable an al-Qaida resur-
gence that could again threaten our 
homeland. 
And while national security experts 
are nearly unanimous in urging the ad-
ministration to focus on competition 
with Russia and China, the White 
House has proposed to cut defense 
spending after inflation and put our 
Armed Forces on the back foot—ignor-
ing the facts, passing the buck, and 
squandering leverage. 
This is not what the American people 
bargained for, and they know it doesn’t 
have to be this way. Past Presidents 
and Congresses have found ways to 
work effectively to make lasting and 
bipartisan 
progress 
on 
important 
issues. For example, when we have 
crafted smart policies to improve ac-
tual infrastructure, big bipartisan ma-
jorities have signed on. 
Just last year, when we worked 
across the aisle on targeted rescue 
packages to help American families 
weather a once-in-a-century pandemic, 
not one—not one—of the five bills we 
passed last year earned fewer than 90 
votes right here in the Senate. This 
year, the story has been different. 
Behind President Biden’s familiar 
face, it is like the most radical Wash-
ington Democrats have been handed 
the keys, and they are trying to speed 
as far left as they can possibly go be-
fore American voters ask for the car 
back. 
But it is not too late. This White 
House can shake off its daydreams of a 
sweeping socialist legacy that will 
never happen in the United States. 
They can recommit to solving our Na-
tion’s actual problems, to fostering 
consensus instead of deepening our di-
vide. 
That is what the American people 
want and what they deserve, not an ad-
ministration that chooses to govern 
like it owes everything—everything— 
to the radical left. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Mexico. 
S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I am 
proud to join with the majority leader 
and with my colleagues from Maine 
and Massachusetts to lead this effort 
to restore responsible methane emis-
sion standards at the EPA. We can 
take commonsense action right now to 
slow 
climate 
change 
and 
simulta-
neously reduce the incredible waste of 
a valuable energy resource. 
Methane is the primary constituent 
in natural gas. It is an incredibly po-
tent driver of the greenhouse effect. 
Over the short term, it is actually 86 
times more powerful than CO2 emis-
sions. It is estimated that about a 
quarter of all the human-caused global 
warming that has occurred since the 
Industrial Revolution can be attributed 
to methane emissions. 
In the United States, the lion’s share 
of these human-caused methane emis-
sions are from the production of oil and 
gas. That is due in part to outdated— 
oftentimes, 
even 
faulty—equipment 
and pipes that leak methane into the 
air, wellheads that leak methane. 
Many oil and gas operators also en-
gage in a practice known as flaring, 
where operators ignite and burn off ex-
cess gas, and, worse yet, venting, where 
uncombusted natural gas is simply re-
leased into the air. 
Now, 
beyond 
the 
obvious 
con-
sequences for climate change, these 
types of methane emissions waste in-
credibly valuable energy resources. 
Fugitive methane also harms public 
health by polluting the air that we 
breathe. When methane leaks from oil 
and gas wells or pipelines or other in-
frastructure, 
harmful 
carcinogens—

April 28, 2021 
carcinogens like benzene and other 
volatile organic compounds—also leak 
into the air alongside it. That means 
more children suffering from asthma 
attacks and more seniors having trou-
ble breathing. 
Methane pollution is real and present 
in many States, and it is a real prob-
lem in my State of New Mexico. We 
saw clear evidence of this over the 
Four Corners region in northwestern 
New Mexico—the San Juan Basin—and 
southwestern Colorado, when a giant 
cloud of methane, about the size of the 
State of Delaware, became so large by 
the mid-2000s that it could actually be 
seen by NASA satellite images. 
This chart right here is a map from 
NASA of the western United States. 
You can see right here the cloud of 
methane over the Four Corners, which 
coincides exactly with the San Juan 
Basin, where much of our oil and gas 
has been produced over the course of 
the last several decades. 
You can see from this map, from the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, how real 
and urgent the issue is. In recent years, 
researchers have detected increasing 
levels of dangerous methane pollution 
now over southeastern New Mexico, 
over the Permian Basin, where oil and 
gas operations have been booming for 
the last decade. 
It is clear that this oil and gas pro-
ducing region has joined the San Juan 
Basin as another major contributor to 
our methane emissions challenge. 
Late last year, the EPA and the New 
Mexico Environment Department con-
ducted helicopter flights over both the 
San Juan and Permian Basins. They 
used forward-looking infrared tech-
nology that can detect emissions from 
oil and gas operations that would nor-
mally be invisible to the naked eye. 
I think if you could see methane, we 
would have solved many of these prob-
lems a long time ago. 
For an example of what this tech-
nology can help us see at an individual 
oil and gas operation level, look at this 
side-by-side image from the group 
Earthworks. As you can see, this is 
what the human eye sees—simple oil 
and gas infrastructure, the number of 
tanks, some piping. But by using infra-
red imaging, you can see the enormous 
amount of methane simply being vent-
ed or leaking into the air. That entire 
plume is invisible to the naked eye, 
and, were it not so, I would, once 
again, suggest that we would have 
solved these problems a long time ago. 
The overflights that were conducted 
by the New Mexico Environment De-
partment found that methane leak 
rates over New Mexico’s Permian Basin 
in 2020 had increased by 250 percent 
over 2019 levels. It is simply unaccept-
able. 
Nationally, the Environmental De-
fense Fund has found that while oil and 
gas production has not yet rebounded 
from a crash brought on by the pan-
demic last year, methane emissions are 
already soaring back to prepandemic 
levels. 
That 
is 
completely 
unacceptable 
when companies have the knowledge, 
have the technology, have the work-
force to fix these leaks and stop the 
wasteful practices of venting and flar-
ing. 
When we set clear rules and emission 
standards, most oil and gas operators 
are onboard with updating their equip-
ment and their practices to minimize 
methane leaks and to bring that nat-
ural gas that they produce to market. 
That is their business plan, not wasting 
methane. 
We saw this bear out in practice in 
New Mexico over these past 2 years, as 
our State’s oil conservation commis-
sion convened conservation and public 
health advocates and local oil and gas 
producers 
to 
establish 
State-level 
methane emissions rules. 
New Mexico’s new rules govern not 
just oil and gas production sites but 
also things like pipelines and storage 
sites that also oftentimes leak meth-
ane into the atmosphere. 
And under our new State rules, oil 
and gas operators have the flexibility 
to choose the best technologies to meet 
the target of capturing 98 percent of 
their natural gas by 2026. 
A spokesperson for the New Mexico 
Oil and Gas Association recently said 
that the group supports this goal and 
the newly finalized rules, which pro-
mote ‘‘safe, responsible production of 
oil and gas.’’ 
New Mexico has now joined other 
western States—States such as Colo-
rado, North Dakota, and Wyoming— 
that 
have 
already 
adopted 
strong 
State-level methane emissions rules. 
Until just recently, we also had 
strong Federal methane rules in place 
at the EPA. Now, unfortunately, these 
rules became one more target of the 
Trump 
administration’s 
reckless 
rollbacks of protections of our clean 
air and clean water in this country. 
Late last year, President Trump dis-
mantled an EPA rule that required oil 
and gas producers to monitor for meth-
ane leaks at their wells, at their com-
pressor stations, and at their other op-
erations. 
This rule, or rollback of a rule, is 
simply a disaster for our climate and 
for public health. It was even rejected 
by much of the industry that it was 
purporting 
to 
help. 
Many 
leading 
American oil and gas producers and 
companies simply panned President 
Trump’s rollback of these common-
sense methane standards. As just one 
example, Gretchen Watkins, Shell’s 
president in the United States, called 
the Trump administration’s rollback 
‘‘frustrating and disappointing,’’ and 
pledged to voluntarily continue reduc-
ing their methane emissions. 
Why would they do that? Because it 
is the right thing to do, because it 
makes business sense, because the roll-
back was, frankly, nonsensical. 
So repairing leaks and installing new 
leak detection technologies will also 
create a number of good-paying jobs. It 
is really the epitome of a win-win situ-
ation. 
Without clear Federal rules in place 
at the EPA, however, industry-led vol-
untary emissions reductions simply 
won’t go far enough to curb the prob-
lem that we have. We need clear stand-
ards that create clear requirements for 
reducing waste and harmful pollution. 
And it is not just me saying this. 
Since we announced this effort to use 
the Congressional Review Act, more 
and more leading companies in the oil 
and gas sector have come forward to 
say that they would welcome rein-
stating the EPA’s methane emissions 
standards. 
That includes the EQT Corporation, 
one of the Nation’s leading natural gas 
producers, which operates in West Vir-
ginia and Ohio and Pennsylvania. In a 
statement, EQT’s president and CEO, 
Toby Rice, called the reinstating of 
uniform Federal methane standards 
‘‘sound federal policies’’ and com-
mitted to ‘‘producing our natural gas 
in accordance with high environmental 
and social standards.’’ 
The major oil company Total USA 
says: 
We welcome direct federal regulation of 
methane emissions and support resolution 
via the Congressional Review Act. 
Shell U.S. tweeted: 
Sound policy surrounding natural gas is 
critical to its role in the energy transition. 
We need to restore the direct federal regula-
tion of methane emissions—and we urge Con-
gress to approve the methane resolution 
under the Congressional Review Act. 
Not my words; Shell—one of the 
world’s major producers of oil and gas. 
These are the words of industry lead-
ers who welcome us setting clear 
standards on methane emissions. 
We are voting to reinstate the com-
monsense methane requirements for 
the oil and gas industry’s production 
and processing segments and the meth-
ane and volatile organic compound re-
quirements for oil and gas trans-
mission and storage facilities. 
With this vote, Congress will once 
again affirm that the Clean Air Act re-
quires the EPA to take action to pro-
tect the air that Americans breathe 
from dangerous and harmful pollutants 
like methane, just like we did back in 
2017 when the Senate came together on 
a bipartisan basis to uphold similar 
rules that govern oil and gas produc-
tion on Federal Bureau of Land Man-
agement lands. In that vote, our 
former colleague Senator John McCain 
and our colleagues Senator SUSAN COL-
LINS
and Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM 
joined with Senate Democrats in re-
taining the BLM’s methane rule that 
promoted responsible development of 
natural gas resources on our public 
lands. 
I would hope that all of us, and I 
mean all of us, sincerely—this is an ef-
fort that should receive the support of 
every single Senator in this body. I 
would hope that all of us can come to-
gether on a bipartisan basis once again 
to restore and strengthen responsible 
Federal methane standards for oil and 
gas operators. I am so pleased that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2261 
April 28, 2021 
Senator COLLINS has already joined us 
as a cosponsor on this resolution. 
Finally, I would like to point out 
that these rules are important not just 
to the health of oil and gas producing 
States like New Mexico or Wyoming or 
Colorado, because these rules will en-
sure the safety of not just oil and gas 
production sites but also of the gas 
pipelines and the storage sites that 
exist in every State in this country and 
in communities across this country. 
These upstream segments of the oil 
and gas industry are in every single 
community you can imagine in all 
parts of the Nation. Just like we all 
know we need to remove poisonous lead 
from our drinking water pipes, we need 
to be sure that the natural gas lines 
that run into our homes and into our 
businesses are not leaking harmful 
methane pollution in the very spaces 
where we all breathe and live. 
As we transition towards a 100-per-
cent clean energy future, a future with-
out pollution, we must do all that we 
can to mitigate the harmful pollution 
caused by our current use of fossil 
fuels, and that is exactly what these 
rules are designed to do. 
As President Biden demonstrated 
just last week when he convened lead-
ers from around the globe, Americans 
are ready for us to move past former 
President Trump’s backward and reck-
less vision on climate. Restoring and 
strengthening methane standards at 
the EPA will be one of the most power-
ful steps we can all take here in this 
Senate today to confront the existen-
tial threat posed by greenhouse pollu-
tion and a warming planet, and it will 
make the air over all of our commu-
nities cleaner and healthier and easier 
to breathe. 
For all of these reasons, I would en-
courage once again not just a few of 
my colleagues but all of our colleagues 
to join us in voting for this bipartisan 
resolution to restore some common-
sense and some responsible Federal 
standards for the waste and leakage of 
methane.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this 
evening President Biden will deliver 
his first address to Congress. I have 
been asked, I think as most Members 
have, by the media: What do you ex-
pect to hear? What do you want to 
hear? 
Honestly, I am interested to hear the 
direction the President will set in his 
speech. The President’s inaugural ad-
dress leaned heavily into the theme of 
unity and bipartisanship, but unity and 
bipartisanship have not been a distin-
guishing feature of the Biden Presi-
dency. 
The President’s first major bill, a 
COVID relief bill, broke the streak of 
bipartisanship on COVID legislation—a 
streak that goes back to March of last 
year. Since that time, when we were 
the majority, we passed five bills, all of 
them with big bipartisan majorities. 
Under 
President 
Biden, 
Democrats 
shoved through a totally partisan bill 
filled with non-COVID-related liberal 
priorities. 
Republicans were more than ready to 
work with Democrats on additional 
coronavirus legislation. In fact, 10 Re-
publicans developed a COVID proposal 
and then met with President Biden to 
discuss it. But Democrats and the 
President were having none of it. It 
was ‘‘their way or the highway’’ on 
COVID legislation. No bipartisanship. 
No compromise. It was, support the 
Democrats’ bill and its wasteful spend-
ing on non-COVID-related priorities or 
be left out of the discussion. As I point-
ed out, only about 10 percent—10 per-
cent—of that ‘‘COVID bill’’ was actu-
ally COVID related. 
It was a deeply disappointing start to 
the Biden Presidency and a betrayal of 
the unity that President Biden had 
pledged himself to in his inauguration 
address. 
Unfortunately, the Biden Presidency 
has mostly continued along in the 
same partisan fashion. The President 
promised to be a President for the 
whole people yet seems more focused 
on making sure that he is the Presi-
dent for the far left. You don’t have to 
take my word for it. One of the leading 
voices of the far left in this Congress 
recently stated that President Biden 
had exceeded—not met; exceeded—pro-
gressives’ expectations. 
Between Democrats and the White 
House, the first 3 months of the Biden 
Presidency have been a long stream of 
policies and proposals that seem to 
have come right from the progressives’ 
playbook—proposals for tax hikes and 
more tax hikes and still more tax hikes 
to pay for new government programs 
like the President’s Green New Deal- 
esque Civilian Climate Corps; a sharp 
retreat from border security, with a 
huge crisis going on at the border as a 
result; a bill that would place unprece-
dented restrictions on the free exercise 
of religion in the name of equality; leg-
islation to dramatically revise our 
electoral system to ensure Democrats’ 
hold on power. The list goes on. 
Once an ardent defender of America’s 
core institutions, the President re-
cently established a commission to ex-
plore the idea of court-packing—per-
haps the most outrageously partisan 
and political proposal we have seen in 
this century. 
From the way Democrats are behav-
ing, you would think that the Amer-
ican people had elected overwhelming 
Democratic majorities and a President 
with a reputation as a strong leftist. Of 
course, that isn’t close to being the 
case. We all know that. Democrats 
have a razor-thin majority in the Sen-
ate and an almost equally thin major-
ity in the House of Representatives, 
where they lost a substantial number 
of seats. As for the Presidency, while 
certainly a Democrat won the election, 
it is worth noting that the only can-
didate who could win the Democratic 
primary was a man historically re-
garded as a moderate. That is right. 
Even among primary Democratic vot-
ers, the Democrats’ far-left liberal can-
didates did not fare so well. 
If there was any mandate in the elec-
tion, it was a mandate for moderation, 
for compromise. Yet the President and 
Democrats are behaving as if they had 
been delivered a mandate for a partisan 
revolution. 
There has been one encouraging 
thing lately, and that is the fact that 
President Biden seems to actually be 
considering pursuing bipartisanship on 
an infrastructure package. He has had 
multiple meetings on infrastructure 
with Republican Members of Congress, 
and while I am still waiting to see just 
how committed the Democrats are to 
achieving a bipartisan result, I am en-
couraged that the President is at least 
talking to the Republican Members. 
A bipartisan infrastructure proposal 
should be a slam dunk. Congress has a 
history of bipartisan collaboration on 
infrastructure legislation. In fact, our 
last major infrastructure bill, the 
FAST Act, received strong support 
from both Democrats and Republicans 
and was a remarkably successful bill. 
As chairman of the Commerce Com-
mittee, I helped to spearhead a bipar-
tisan reauthorization of the FAA, in-
cluding of critical programs to improve 
airport infrastructure, and last Con-
gress, the Environment and Public 
Works Committee developed major bi-
partisan infrastructure legislation. 
There is no good reason that we 
shouldn’t reach bipartisan agreement 
on another substantial infrastructure 
bill, but it will require a commitment 
from the Democrats and the President 
to real bipartisan work and a recogni-
tion that bipartisanship involves com-
promise and that no one side is going 
to get everything its Members want. 
Bipartisanship is not the Democrats 
inviting the Republicans to support the 
Democrats’ ideal bill. Bipartisanship is 
sitting down at the table, identifying 
what we agree on, and then working 
out a solution to our differences that 
involves both sides accepting com-
promises. 
I hope that, tonight, the President 
will go beyond empty talk about bipar-
tisanship and make an actual, concrete 
commitment to achieve bipartisan re-
sults, starting with infrastructure leg-
islation. I hope, although I do not real-
ly expect, that he will move away from 
the policies and partisan priorities of 
the far left and toward a more mod-
erate vision, more in keeping with the 
bringing together of Americans that he 
spoke of in his inaugural address. 
Ultimately, what matters the most is 
not what the President will say tonight

but what he will do in the days and 
weeks to come. Will he finally deliver 
on that promise of unity that he spoke 
of in his inaugural address or will he 
continue to pursue the partisan path 
that progressives have laid out for 
him? For the sake of our country, I 
hope he chooses bipartisanship. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 14 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the resolution of dis-
approval on the Trump EPA’s methane 
policy rule. 
This resolution we have in front of us 
today is nothing more than political 
posturing, I believe. Ironically, the 
Democrats are targeting natural gas 
for blame when methane emissions 
have actually fallen. According to EPA 
data, natural gas systems in the United 
States reduced their overall methane 
emissions by nearly 16 percent between 
1990 and 2019. It is widely recognized 
that the shale gas boom led to signifi-
cant greenhouse gas emissions reduc-
tions across our power sector. 
Some climate change advocates, in-
cluding those in Washington, want to 
ban oil and gas production and use, and 
they oppose the maintenance and ex-
pansion of our pipelines in this coun-
try. The CRA is part of that effort, I 
believe. 
The CRA is part of a plan to double 
down on an industry that the Biden ad-
ministration—obviously, from the day 
the President took office—does not 
support. Just yesterday, the Biden ad-
ministration’s Office of Management 
and Budget issued a Statement of Ad-
ministration Policy on the resolution 
we are considering today. The state-
ment does not hide the disdain that the 
administration has toward the oil and 
gas sector. The statement presents a 
laundry list of alleged harms to Ameri-
cans from the oil and gas industry and 
none of the benefits. It doesn’t mention 
that, as our natural gas production and 
use have gone up, our country’s overall 
greenhouse gas emissions have gone 
down. It does not talk about the wage 
gap between natural gas sector jobs 
and so-called green jobs. 
As POLITICO reported this week, 
‘‘The median wage for solar workers is 
$24.48 an hour compared with $30.33 for 
those employed by the natural gas sec-
tor, which amounts to a roughly $12,000 
annual wage gap.’’ 
In yesterday’s statement, the admin-
istration showed its cards for its next 
step. The passage of this resolution 
would 
lay 
the 
groundwork 
for 
a 
planned regulatory war on oil and gas. 
According to the administration, to-
day’s resolution ‘‘clear[s] the pathway 
for EPA to evaluate opportunities to 
promulgate even stronger standards 
under section 111 of the Clean Air Act 
to address dangerous methane and 
other pollution from both new and ex-
isting sources across the oil and gas 
sector.’’ 
That is right. They want to come for-
ward with even stronger clean air regu-
lations on the sector than the Obama 
administration did. But before even 
starting a rulemaking to ask for public 
comments, the Biden administration 
has made up its mind to regulate much 
more aggressively. I guess I am not 
really surprised. Now it is time; it is 
just waiting to identify the best oppor-
tunities to do so. 
We shouldn’t demonize an industry 
that is part of the lifeblood of our econ-
omy. We should celebrate the emission- 
reduction accomplishments and look 
for ways to further incentivize those. 
Let’s focus on solutions that address 
our climate challenges without de-
stroying 
the 
economic 
engines 
of 
growth, solutions that don’t pick win-
ners and losers. 
The market is pushing industry to 
lower its methane emissions. And for 
those still flaring gas, one way to re-
duce flaring is to build out our pipeline 
infrastructure so they can get the 
gas—the very commodity they are try-
ing to produce and sell—to the market. 
So let’s come up with solutions that 
actually help protect our planet and 
don’t overregulate industry for polit-
ical points, solutions like improving 
the environmental review and permit-
ting processes so that we can complete 
these pipeline projects more efficiently 
and cleaner. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
the resolution, and I urge my col-
leagues to focus on real, unifying solu-
tions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today is 
Workers Memorial Day, when we re-
member all of the workers in our Na-
tion who have been killed, who have 
been injured, or who became sick on 
the job. On this day, we reflect upon 
the losses these workers and their fam-
ilies have suffered, and we also—and I 
believe we must—recommit ourselves 
to ensuring that every worker in Amer-
ica is safe on the job. 
On a day like today, I am remem-
bering Pennsylvania workers—not only 
the workers of today and the chal-
lenges they face in the workplace and 
the challenges their families still face, 
especially in the grip of and, we hope, 
ultimately in the aftermath of a ter-
rible pandemic, but we are also, of 
course, remembering those who came 
before them, generations of workers in 
a State like Pennsylvania, folks who 
built this country, made this country 
run, and helped us win World War II, 
not to mention other battles, economic 
and otherwise. 
So we are remembering those stories. 
I am also remembering, of course, on a 
day like today a lot of stories from my 
home area. I live in northeastern Penn-
sylvania. I live in Scranton, PA, which 
at one time was the anthracite coal 
capital of the world, that region was. 
Every 
family, 
every 
community 
seemed to have a story about one of 
their loved ones—sometimes a grand-
father or a great grandfather or an 
uncle or a grandmother or some rel-
ative—and how they struggled in those 
days. 
One story is not, unfortunately, 
atypical. This is a story about an 11- 
year-old boy working in the anthracite 
coal mines. 
In those days, in order to pull the 
coal out of the coal mine, you had to 
fill a coal car with coal, but it had to 
be pulled out of the mines by a mule. I 
am talking about the early 1900s. 
In this case, this 11-year-old boy— 
and, of course, it was permissible in 
those days to allow someone that 
young to work in a coal mine—this 
young kid reached down to get the 
straps that connected the mule to the 
coal car, and then, when he was bend-
ing down to pick up one of those leath-
er straps, the rear hooves of the mule 
kicked him square in the face. 
Here is the description of what hap-
pened after that mule kicked the 11- 
year-old, and I am reading from an ac-
count: 
[The] kick hurled him over a loaded five- 
foot-high coal car and into the wall of the 
mine—the ‘‘face’’ of the mine, as the miners 
would say. 
The 
11-year-old 
had 
his 
nose 
smashed. 
He had an open wound from his forehead 
across his eyebrow, down his nose, through 
his lip, and into his chin. 
No ambulance was called. No paramedics 
came to save him. Work didn’t even stop. 
Then the account goes on to talk 
about how the mine boss had another 
young kid walk this 11-year-old out of 
the mine, taking the child home—a 
long, perilous journey home. 
Once he finally made it home, [the 11 year 
old’s] mother called a doctor and they laid 
him on the dining room table, where the doc-
tor sewed the long gouge in his face back to-
gether. There were no benefits—no worker’s 
compensation, no safety net in place to take 
care of the adult worker, much less an in-
jured child. 
That is, unfortunately, an account 
that was all too common in those days. 
Much has changed, fortunately, but, 
candidly, not enough. 
We mark today the 50th anniversary 
of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act going into effect. It just happens to 
be today. This is a landmark achieve-
ment in the fight to guarantee every 
worker a safe workplace. It was passed 
because of the tireless efforts of work-
ers and unions that stood up for their 
fellow working men and women and de-
manded government action that led to 
the so-called OSHA Act. There re-
mains, of course, much work to be done 
to protect our workers. 
Let’s turn to the pandemic and our 
workers. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has made 
clearer than ever the need for action to

strengthen workplace protections, en-
sure workers can stand up and advo-
cate for safe workplaces. 
The virus has touched every work-
place in the country, presenting a new 
threat to workers’ health on the job 
unlike any we have seen in our life-
times. 
Throughout the pandemic, millions 
of workers have been at risk—at risk of 
contracting the virus as they did their 
work, having to worry every day when 
they headed home about their health 
and, of course, the health of their fami-
lies. 
The death toll from this virus, this 
pandemic, is staggering. More than 
570,000 Americans are dead; more than 
26,000 
in 
Pennsylvania. 
These, 
of 
course, were mothers and fathers and 
grandmothers and grandfathers, sisters 
and brothers, neighbors and friends. 
The disproportionate effect on people 
of color is also staggering—those who 
are widely represented in the essential 
workforces that have continued to go 
to work every day throughout the pan-
demic. This disproportionate impact on 
people of color has been especially dis-
turbing and devastating. 
The toll never should have been this 
high, and workers never should have 
had to face the risk they faced every 
day during the pandemic. 
To honor all of these workers and 
their families, we must continue to 
take action to protect them on the job 
and ensure that workers are never left 
as vulnerable as they were in the pan-
demic. 
Now, we have made some steps— 
taken some steps recently. The Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, passed by Congress 
and signed into law by President Biden, 
has already been critical to helping 
protect workers from COVID–19. The 
rescue plan provided billions to help 
get Americans the vaccines they need 
and to ensure that frontline workers 
receive the supplies and personal pro-
tective equipment they need to stay 
safe on the job. It also included $100 
million for OSHA to protect workers 
on the job. So we can celebrate that on 
this celebration of Workers Memorial 
Day. This $100 million in funding is es-
sential to help defeat the pandemic but 
also, in the process, to keep workers 
safe. 
We must ensure that policies are in 
place to strengthen our workplace safe-
ty laws and also to strengthen enforce-
ment. 
We must ensure that the highest 
standards—the 
highest 
standards— 
which are informed by recent science, 
exist to protect workers from all 
threats to their health, whether it is 
exposure to COVID–19 in a grocery 
store or silica dust in a coal mine. 
We must strengthen workers’ ability, 
of course, to organize and bargain col-
lectively by passing the PRO Act, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
The PRO Act would ensure workers 
have a voice on the job and are able to 
advocate for safe working conditions. 
We must ensure that OSHA, the Oc-
cupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration, and its sister Agency, MSHA, 
the Mine Safety and Health Adminis-
tration, have the authority, the re-
sources, and the personnel they need to 
protect workers every day of every 
year. 
Our Nation’s workforce has done he-
roic work throughout this pandemic. 
One part of that workforce that has 
done both essential and heroic work 
over the past year is our Nation’s 
home- and community-based services 
workforce, often not talked about in 
the debates here in Congress. 
These workers are the backbone of 
our caregiving infrastructure, and we 
know that as part of the rescue plan, 
President Biden—I am sorry—as part of 
the American Jobs Plan the President 
has proposed and we have not yet 
passed, but we are working on it, Presi-
dent Biden has called for a $400 billion 
investment to be directed to invest in 
seniors and people with disabilities and 
to support this vital and undervalued 
workforce. 
This great American idea to develop 
the best caregiving workforce in the 
world—not one of the best, not second 
or third, the best workforce in the 
world—to care for and to provide sup-
port and services to people with dis-
abilities and seniors—this great Amer-
ican idea is an idea that is focused on 
that workforce, which is a workforce 
primarily of women of color making 
only $12 an hour. 
We can’t say that we have the best 
caregiving workforce in the world if we 
are not going to invest in that work-
force and lift them up. The American 
people want this to happen. This is 
overwhelmingly popular. More than 70 
percent of the American people want us 
to make this investment in home- and 
community-based 
services, 
thereby 
lifting up that workforce so that we 
can provide better care for people with 
disabilities and seniors so they can not 
only survive but also thrive. 
Making this investment is a vital 
part of raising standards and working 
conditions for this essential workforce 
and for all workers. 
Let me conclude with this, the story 
of the 11-year-old boy kicked in the 
face in the anthracite coal mines of 
northeastern Pennsylvania. That 11- 
year-old was my grandfather. His name 
was Alphonsus Liguori Casey, and he, 
like a lot of young kids, started in the 
coal mines at that age, at the age of 11, 
between—worked in the mines between 
1905 and 1910. Of course, when he 
worked in the mines, there were no 
protections—virtually none, even for a 
child. Thank goodness we have made a 
lot of progress since then, but we still 
have a long way to go to make sure 
that all workers in all workforces are 
protected in their workplace. 
We also have to make sure we are 
making the appropriate investments in 
them to call ourselves the greatest 
country in the world. We can’t say we 
are the greatest country in the world if 
we are paying people $11 or $12 an hour 
to do the important work they have to 
do every day and want to do. It is a 
high calling to care for people with dis-
abilities and seniors. 
So just like that 11-year-old boy and 
so many like him in those days, we 
have to make sure that today’s work-
force is the subject of our protection, is 
the subject of our attention, and is the 
subject of our investment. Let’s lift 
them up so that we have the best work-
force in the world and the safest work-
places, not only on Workers Memorial 
Day but every day.

S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here to speak on the upcoming 
methane Congressional Review Act 
matter and speak in support of over-
turning the Trump misrule regarding 
the problem of methane emissions. 
Let’s just start by setting the stage 
that about one-quarter of the global 
warming that we have experienced has 
been due to methane and about one- 
third of that is due to the activities of 
the oil and gas industry. So this is a 
very significant part of our climate 
problem—I should say our climate and 
oceans problem—and we don’t actually 
know how bad it is. 
The Environmental Defense Fund has 
recently estimated that methane emis-
sions from oil and natural gas oper-
ations could be as much as 60 percent 
higher than previous estimates. So it is 
a significant part of the problem. 
One of the reasons we don’t know 
how bad the problem is, is because of 
the way the oil and gas industry has 
behaved about reporting its methane 
problem. Now, just to understand, what 
the natural gas industry would like to 
tell you is that natural gas is a far 
cleaner fuel, far safer from a climate 
perspective, than coal or than oil— 
bunker oil or whatever else you want 
to burn. And it is true that once nat-
ural gas has been burned at the burner 
tip, it is less harmful. But what the 
natural gas industry wants you to for-
get is everything between the well and 
the burner tip because through that 
enormous web of piping occurs so much 
leakage that satellites flying overhead 
can pick up the pools of methane float-
ing in our atmosphere from the leak-
age. The natural gas industry doesn’t 
want to talk about that. 
One of the things that they did is 
they got the Trump administration to, 
early on, withdraw EPA’s request that 
in the previous administration the in-
dustries more or less agreed to that 
would have required oil and gas compa-
nies to report on their methane emis-
sions.

administration the offices at EPA, En-
ergy, and Interior, and other places im-
portant to the industry, they did what 
the industry wanted, and the very first 
thing, March 2, 2017, was to withdraw 
the request that would have had oil 
and gas companies report how bad 
their methane leakage actually was. 
It didn’t take long to follow that up 
on March 28, with an Executive order 
from Trump directing EPA to suspend 
or rescind existing methane regula-
tions for the oil and gas industry. 
But that wasn’t enough for the oil 
and gas industry. On April 19, they got 
EPA to postpone implementation of a 
rule that would have required them to 
equip new wells with equipment to pre-
vent methane leaks. You wouldn’t 
think that would be asking too much, 
particularly from an industry that 
wants to tell everybody that it is bet-
ter for the climate and the environ-
ment than the rest of the fossil fuel in-
dustry. But no, they asked EPA to 
undo that requirement so they could 
more readily leak methane from new 
wells. 
Even that wasn’t enough. In May of 
2017, they got the Department of the 
Interior to suspend a rule that would 
have required oil and gas companies to 
curb the flaring of methane from their 
oil and gas wells on public lands. 
And then again, September 11, 2018, 
they got EPA to propose a rule to 
weaken the methane leak detection 
and repair requirements for their new 
wells—weaken the detection and repair 
requirements 
for 
methane 
leakage 
from their own wells. 
Then they proposed a second rule to 
eliminate EPA’s regulatory authority 
over methane emissions from oil and 
gas facilities. That is getting a little 
bit out there because methane is a 
greenhouse gas regulable as a pollutant 
by the EPA, and it also has a whole lot 
of unfortunate characteristics for peo-
ple who have to breathe it in entirely 
apart from the climate harm and dam-
age it does. But that is what the oil 
and gas industry wanted the EPA to 
do, to eliminate its regulatory author-
ity over methane emissions. 
Then, more recently, on August 13, 
2020, they got EPA to promulgate a 
rule to eliminate that rule—to elimi-
nate that regulatory authority over 
methane emissions from oil and gas fa-
cilities. 
This is dirty conduct by an industry, 
to take advantage of its ability to 
plant industry operatives in positions 
of public responsibility in order to leak 
more methane, put less equipment in 
place to protect against methane leak-
age, and reduce its requirements even 
to report on the methane leakage that 
is going on. That is not responsible cor-
porate conduct. These rules are a dis-
grace. The CRA should pass, and we 
should get on to taking on this prob-
lem of methane. 
I will close by pointing out that I 
have a bill that would do quite a lot to 
solve this problem. One of the problems 
in this whole enterprise of pollution is 
that, when it is free to pollute, people 
will pollute. If corporations view them-
selves as having only an obligation to 
their shareholders and only an obliga-
tion to their shareholders that is de-
nominated in dollars, why would they 
ever spend any money at all to protect 
against pollution, unless they were re-
quired to or unless it had a cost? 
We know it actually has a cost. Peo-
ple suffer from pollution; that is a cost. 
Our oceans are acidifying because of 
carbon dioxide pollution; that is a cost. 
People lose their homes in wildfires 
that didn’t used to happen; that is a 
cost. My State has to plan to lose its 
current map to sea level rise and to 
lose precious shorefront land; that is a 
cost. These are real costs. The industry 
just doesn’t want to pay them. They 
want a free ride on everybody else’s 
suffering, and one way to solve that is 
to put a price on the pollution. 
And, by the way, this is not a liberal, 
Democratic 
environmental 
agenda. 
This is economics 101. Milton Fried-
man, for Pete’s sake, said that if you 
want to have an economic system that 
works, you have to put what he called 
‘‘negative 
externalities,’’ 
the 
bad 
things that happen that hurt other peo-
ple. You have to put the cost of that 
into the product. Otherwise, you don’t 
have a market system. You have a sub-
sidy system. You are picking winners 
and losers. 
As much as my colleagues on the 
other side like to say that they don’t 
like subsidies and they don’t want to 
see government picking winners and 
losers, when it is the fossil fuel indus-
try that gets subsidized, when it is the 
fossil fuel industry that is the winner, 
they can’t line up fast enough to sub-
sidize and pick winners and losers. 
So we are going to have to work pret-
ty hard to solve this problem because 
we have some real hazards in front of 
us. What my bill would do is to meas-
ure the thing that they didn’t want to 
do—measure methane emissions from 
oil and gas production. As I said, new 
developments in satellite technology 
means that we don’t have to depend on 
them any longer. We can actually do a 
lot of this measuring. We can check 
their measuring. We can, to use Rea-
gan’s phrase, ‘‘trust but verify’’ what 
they are reporting with a whole lot of 
other data that we can pull together. 
So get the data. How much are they 
leaking? Figure it out basin by basin 
because that is where it really happens. 
It happens in these pools that emerge 
from the basins from all of the leakage. 
And then put a price on it. 
It is not hard to do. There is a social 
cost of carbon that President Obama 
proposed. President Biden has put it 
back in at the previous level, while 
they get to work on figuring out what 
updates there should be to it. We have 
a social cost of carbon. You can quan-
tify the methane harm and compare it 
to the carbon harm. You can make an 
equivalency between those two and you 
can determine what the social cost of 
methane leakage should be. It is really 
not all that complicated. 
We would start it in 2023, so that the 
industry, which has been so reprehen-
sible in its leakage, in its influence 
over EPA, and in its influence in the 
Trump administration—we are actu-
ally giving them a chance to clean up 
their act and do what they should have 
done all along. So it would begin in 
2023, and it would cost them $1,800 per 
ton of leaked methane. 
You leak it; you pay for it. It is not 
that complicated. When I was growing 
up, we had a pretty simple rule in my 
family: You spill it; you clean it up. I 
don’t know why that is suddenly not an 
appropriate rule when the company 
and the industry gets big enough and 
has enough political power and dark 
money to be pulling strings around 
here. That ought to be the rule. You 
spill it; you clean it up. You leak the 
methane; you pay for it. 
So I hope that we can get that meth-
ane factor passed into law, as well, be-
cause we know perfectly well that this 
is not an industry that is going to pur-
sue the public interest if it is not re-
quired to. We saw that in the Trump 
administration. We saw it on March 2, 
2017. We saw it on March 28, 2017. We 
saw it on April 19, 2017. We saw it on 
May 10, 2017. We saw it on September 
11, 2018, on August 28, 2019, and on Au-
gust 13, 2020. Over and over and over 
again, they hurt the public by using 
their clout over the regulatory Agency 
of this country to their own benefit. 
You can’t count on them to take care 
of this on their own. They just won’t. 
They have proven that. That is not a 
contested fact any longer. We gave 
them the chance to clean up their act 
without this kind of requirement, and 
they totally failed. In fact, they spent 
all their energy trying to degrade the 
regulatory authority that kept them 
trying to clean up methane. 
Let’s solve this problem. Methane is 
a real problem. There is a lot of it 
changing our climate. The climate sit-
uation has become an emergency. 
Methane is easily preventable from 
leaking. And, by the way, here is the 
added bonus: It gives a lot of people 
jobs. There is a lot of work that we can 
do to reclaim the damage that the fos-
sil fuel industry has caused. Cleaning 
up the wells, cleaning up the mines, 
cleaning up the piping—those are all 
real jobs. 
So let’s get after it. Let’s start with 
the CRA. Let’s go on to a proper meth-
ane fee to put the leaking out of busi-
ness and on from there.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2265 
April 28, 2021 
body in years, perhaps the most con-
sequential vote in terms of our climate 
and the risk that climate change im-
poses on all of us here in America and 
across 
the 
world. 
It 
is 
a 
pretty 
straightforward vote, although it is an 
interesting procedural problem. 
The vote is a Congressional Review 
Act vote to repeal the repeal of the reg-
ulation on the release of methane from 
oil and gas, both drilling and transpor-
tation. A repeal of a repeal is the legis-
lative equivalent of a double negative, 
and, of course, we all know a double 
negative produces a positive, and that 
is exactly what will happen in this 
case. 
Some years ago, regulations were im-
posed upon the oil and gas industry to 
control the escape of methane from 
drilling operations. This isn’t about 
natural gas or oil; this is about fugitive 
gases that escape into the atmosphere 
as part of the drilling process or the 
transportation process. 
The problem is that methane is the 
nuclear weapon of climate change. 
Methane is 80 times as dangerous as 
CO2 in the atmosphere, in terms of cap-
turing heat and contributing to cli-
mate change—80 times; not 80 percent 
more, not 8 times more, 80 times more. 
Now, the good news is methane only 
persists in the atmosphere for about 20 
years; CO2, unfortunately, over 100 
years. So because of its short residence 
time and its high potency, removing it 
now will have immediate and substan-
tial effects on the overall amount of 
greenhouse gas that is in our atmos-
phere. 
There is nothing we can do in the 
short run to deal with climate change 
that is more significant than the vote 
that will take place on this floor in a 
few hours. This is probably, as I said at 
the beginning, one of the most impor-
tant votes that we will have in this 
Chamber in order to forestall and slow 
the climate catastrophe that everyone 
acknowledges is headed toward us— 
whether it is wildfires, whether it is 
changes in ocean temperature that af-
fect sea life, whether it is hurricanes, 
whether it is pure temperature. 
Let me talk a bit about climate 
change as a national security issue. I 
serve on the Armed Services and Intel-
ligence Committees. It is a national se-
curity issue for a number of reasons. 
One is sort of dollars and cents. It af-
fects our military facilities around the 
world that are going to be affected by 
rising sea levels. We are going to have 
to spend billions of dollars in order to 
shore up those facilities. So that is just 
kind of nuts and bolts, dollars and 
cents. 
But the part that really worries me 
is migration. We all know about the 
migrants from Syria, from the Syrian 
civil war. I don’t know the exact num-
ber—maybe 4 or 5 million. But those 
migrants upset the political system of 
all of Europe and created a major polit-
ical crisis. 
The estimate for climate migrants 
because of the inhospitality of the cli-
mate in the band around the central 
part of the Earth is in the hundreds of 
millions—between 100 and 200 million 
climate migrants who are escaping a 
place that they can’t live in anymore 
because of drought, because of famine, 
because of a lack of drinking water, or 
just because of high temperatures. 
Humans aren’t evolved to live in 
places that are at 130 degrees of heat. 
So people are going to be on the move. 
Think of the disruption caused by the 
immigration or the migration from 
Syria and multiply that by 10, 20, 30, 40 
times. That is what we are talking 
about, and that kind of pressure and 
famine and drought and all of those 
things throughout history are what 
have caused wars. 
It is a threat multiplier. It is a 
threat creator. It is, in fact, a national 
security issue. This isn’t about just 
being concerned about whether we will 
have more warm days in April. This is 
a national security issue, and it is of 
worldwide import. 
Now, why is this vote today impor-
tant if it is a worldwide issue? I have 
had people say to me: Angus, why are 
we going through all this? Why are we 
going to cost ourselves any money 
when it is just as big a problem coming 
from China or India? 
We can shut down all of our busi-
nesses in Maine, and we are still not 
going to be able to solve this problem, 
nor could we if we did it in the United 
States. Molecules of methane or CO2 
don’t care about borders. They go 
around the world, and they are causing 
this problem to happen around the 
world. 
But, yes, this vote today is important 
because it is a signal to the rest of the 
world that we are serious about this 
problem. A negative vote today is a 
signal to the rest of the world that we 
don’t care, and the rest of the world is 
going to be paying attention. 
This is a global problem. It is going 
to take solutions from every country 
and particularly from the larger emit-
ting countries, like the United States, 
like China, like India. But we have to 
show that we are willing to do it here, 
if we are going to ask other people to 
make these kinds of steps in their 
country. And that is why I think this 
vote has international implications as 
well as national. 
Now, what about the cost? Are we 
imposing some enormous cost, or are 
we talking about new technology? No, 
this is a relatively cheap way to get a 
major improvement in the emission of 
greenhouse gases. 
We are not talking about carbon cap-
ture, which is very important, but we 
are a ways away from cost-effective 
carbon capture technology, and the 
costs are still very high. This is of rel-
atively low cost. 
Regulating methane emissions from oil 
and gas production is the right thing to do 
for our climate and the air quality of com-
munities across the country. 
I couldn’t have said it better myself, 
but I am reading someone else’s words. 
It’s widely acknowledged that methane is a 
highly potent greenhouse gas with a global 
warming potential 80 times greater than CO2. 
Beyond the long-term impacts related to cli-
mate change, methane emissions also have 
implications for local air quality. We owe it 
to the communities where we live and work 
to reduce these emissions. 
Who said that? ANGUS KING didn’t 
say that. Shell Oil said that. Many, if 
not most, of the major producers of oil 
and gas in this country are supporting 
this vote today. This is not a vote 
where fossil fuel is on one side and the 
environmental community is on the 
other. No, this is a broad coalition of 
people worried about health, of people 
worried about the environment, of peo-
ple worried about climate change, and 
also people in the industry who are 
worried about the effects of this on 
their industry if we don’t take care of 
this. 
And here is very interesting data. We 
all know that different technologies 
have different impacts on the environ-
ment, and these bars are the emission 
levels per unit of energy produced of 
various alternatives: air pumps, wood 
pellets, natural gas, propane, heating 
oil, coal. These are all in use in the 
United States. 
We have substantially lowered our 
emission of greenhouse gases because 
of the conversion from coal and oil to 
natural gas, and that hasn’t been 
caused by regulation or by the dead 
hand of government. That is because of 
the market, because of the enormous 
production of natural gas in this coun-
try. 
Now, here is the problem—and I have 
always thought of natural gas as a 
transition fuel. Sixty percent of our 
electricity in New England comes from 
natural gas, and, indeed, our CO2 is 
down because of that. But here is the 
problem. See this little black line 
here? That is the actual emission from 
natural gas if you count methane. 
So the environmental, the climate 
advantage of natural gas disappears if 
you count the methane that is released 
in the production of natural gas. But it 
is controllable. It is not inevitable. It 
is not something that is impossible. 
There are now technologies to survey 
pipelines to detect leaks and to prevent 
them. It is really pretty straight-
forward. If you have a pipeline that is 
leaking and is putting methane in the 
atmosphere that is 80 times as bad as 
CO2, let’s fix it. And that is all we are 
talking about today. 
We are talking about restoring com-
monsense regulations on the release of 
dangerous 
climate-change-inducing 
gases, principally, methane. Some of 
the other things that are released are 
also dangerous for people living in the 
area of the well or the pipeline leak. 
I am not opposed to the use. I mean, 
right now, as I say, natural gas is the 
preferred alternative—and you can see 
why—except for the methane problem. 
So let’s eliminate that. Let’s make the 
chart look like this. Then, natural gas 
works. But we have to deal with meth-
ane.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2266 
April 28, 2021 
This is the low-hanging fruit of cli-
mate action. This is an opportunity for 
this country to make a statement 
internationally, to make a statement 
to our people, and to do something 
about the most serious environmental 
problem we face. 
Every day that goes by, it gets more 
expensive to deal with. Every day that 
goes by, it is going to be more difficult 
for our people, the impacts are going to 
be more catastrophic, and the impacts 
are going to be more difficult in terms 
of what we have to spend to deal with 
it. 
So let’s spend relatively little now to 
eliminate one of the most serious risks. 
It is not minor. It is a very significant 
part of the climate issue, and it is one 
that we can do at a relatively low 
price, with not a heavy hand of regula-
tion but commonsense regulation. And 
we can do something important for the 
American people and, indeed, for the 
people of the entire world. 
This is an important vote this after-
noon. I hope it is a resounding vote. It 
should be. It should be a resounding 
vote to say to the world and to say to 
the people of this country: We are on 
your side. We understand there is a 
problem heading for us, and we are 
going to act to deal with it. 
This is our responsibility. It is why 
we are here, and we have the capability 
to do this starting today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
think I will get done before, but, in 
case, I ask unanimous consent to be 
able to finish my statement before the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA POWER 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the 
nomination 
of 
Ambassador 
Samantha Power to be our next Ad-
ministrator of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. 
Ambassador Power’s qualifications 
for this position are beyond dispute. 
Her lifelong commitment to protecting 
human rights and preventing global 
atrocities, combined with the foreign 
policy experience she gained during the 
Obama administration, make her im-
peccably qualified for this role. 
I want to highlight, in particular, her 
leadership on the international effort 
to end genocide. Our struggle against 
these horrific crimes is ongoing and 
unrelenting. Like Ambassador Power, I 
was proud to see the Biden administra-
tion formally recognize the Armenian 
genocide, a recognition by the U.S. 
Government that was long overdue. 
Ambassador Power’s intellect, en-
ergy, and focus will be an enormous 
asset to USAID in the Administration’s 
efforts to end poverty around the 
world, help victims of conflict, improve 
food security, and build the kind of re-
silience that ultimately benefits the 
security and prosperity of the Amer-
ican people. 
This work is not easy, but it is ex-
actly the sort of work that President 
Biden described in his inaugural ad-
dress when he spoke of the United 
States as ‘‘a strong and trusted partner 
for peace, progress, and security.’’ 
It is also the work we must do to con-
front the immense crises we face 
around the world. Many of the conflicts 
Ambassador Power contended with dur-
ing her time at the United Nations con-
tinue today. New conflicts, as we know, 
are brewing in Ethiopia, Haiti, and 
Burma, and creating hundreds of thou-
sands of innocent victims and refugees. 
Climate change is increasing food in-
security, intensifying natural resource 
scarcity, and beginning to drive mass 
migration. 
And, of course, the COVID–19 pan-
demic is an ever-evolving threat, and 
its proliferation around the world will 
continue to endanger our public health 
here at home. As long as there is a 
COVID–19 virus anywhere, it can be ev-
erywhere. We cannot hermetically seal 
off our Nation. That is why this par-
ticular role of USAID is going to be in-
creasingly important. 
As we reengage with our partners in 
the world to meet these challenges, 
Ambassador Power will play a critical 
role. I am confident her experience, te-
nacity, and drive to build a better, 
more prosperous, peaceful world are ex-
actly what USAID and our country 
need at this moment. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
Ambassador Power’s successful con-
firmation. 
With that, I yield the floor.

trator of the United States Agency for 
International Development and on pas-
sage of the joint resolution of dis-
approval regarding the methane rule. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA POWER 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I 
have said many times in the past, 
Presidents should be given a good deal 
of discretion when choosing their polit-
ical appointees, and so long as their 
nominees are qualified and do not ob-
struct the advice and consent process, 
the Senate should not stand in the way 
of their confirmation. 
After all, Presidents are ultimately 
responsible for the actions of their ad-
ministration. And if the buck truly 
stops at the Resolute Desk, they need 
to be able to trust their subordinates 
to get the job done. 
That being said, I now come to the 
point of my coming to the floor; that I 
must vote no on the nomination of 
Samantha Power to be Director of 
USAID. 
On February 18, I sent a letter to Ms. 
Power 
asking 
questions 
regarding 
emails that came out of her office dur-
ing her time serving as U.N. Ambas-
sador. 
Heavily redacted versions of those 
emails obtained by my office appear to 
suggest that Ms. Power’s staff may 
have been working behind the scenes to 
remove the Islamic Relief Agency from 
the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanc-
tions list. 
That organization was placed on the 
sanctions list for what? Funneling 
money to terrorist groups, and, thus, 
removing it would allow that organiza-
tion to receive private donations as 
well as taxpayer funds. 
In her letter responding to my ques-
tions, Ms. Power claimed that she was 
not working to take the Islamic Relief 
Agency off the sanctions list. She fur-
ther claimed that the emails in ques-
tion were part of an effort to challenge 
false claims made by the Islamic Relief 
Agency at the U.N. denying their in-
volvement in terrorist financing. 
In order to verify her claims, I have 
requested, on multiple occasions, that 
she provide unredacted copies of the 
emails and complete answers to the 
questions that I posed in my original 
letter. 
But after 3 months, all I have re-
ceived is a collection of public press re-
leases. I have not received the emails I 
requested. I have not received answers 
to my questions. 
Normally, political appointees and 
nominees wait until after they are con-
firmed to start ignoring congressional 
inquiries, but in this case, it seems the 
Executive branch has decided advice 
and consent is going to be a mere for-
mality, and there is no need to wait. 
This seems to be a pattern. 
For instance, I asked the Secretary 
of HHS a number of specific questions 
for the record as part of the Finance 
Committee vetting process. I received 
responses that didn’t even try to an-
swer the substance of my questions. 
I also asked Interior Secretary Deb 
Haaland to reconcile some conflicting 
information on her House financial dis-
closures and responses to questions for 
the record for the Energy Committee 
about her taxes. They weren’t gotcha 
questions either. In fact, it was prob-
ably innocent mistakes on her part, if 
anything, but Secretary Haaland de-
clined to respond at all. 
Maybe the White House figures sim-
ply that they don’t need Republican 
votes so they don’t need to answer even 
routine vetting questions from Repub-
licans, but then the White House can’t 
blame Republicans for voting no on 
their nominees when they ignore our 
oversight questions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the 
methane problem is not a new one. It 
has quickly and drastically warmed 
our planet since the Industrial Revolu-
tion, and today it accounts for one- 
quarter of global warming. 
We have no time to lose. In the short 
term, methane is more than 80 times 
more powerful and damaging than its 
better known cousin named CO2. 
And 
while 
we 
have 
made 
more 
progress reducing our carbon dioxide 
levels, methane pollution has contin-
ued to surge in the background. Even 
last year, with more cars off the road 
and many stuck in their homes, meth-
ane pollution levels just kept rising. 
And it rose in record amounts. In 
2020, we saw the largest ever annual in-
crease in methane emissions. If we con-
tinue to fail to act, methane pollution 
from the oil and gas industry is pro-
jected to cause as much near-term 
global warming as 260 coal-fired power-
plants every year by 2025. 
This is a crisis brought on by human-
ity, but, thankfully, it is one that we 
can solve as well by humanity. We have 
the technology and we understand the 
science and we need now to summon 
the political will and the regulatory 
leadership in order to solve this meth-
ane problem. 
Last week, I sent a letter to Presi-
dent Biden asking him to lead the 
world in developing a bold domestic 
methane strategy, and although the 
administration’s economy-wide goals 
for greenhouse gas emissions are a 
good baseline start, we need robust and 
specific targets for methane. 
By voting today to rescind the 
Trump-era attacks on methane regula-
tions, we can protect the Clean Air Act 
instead of undermining it. By rein-
stating strong standards, we can pro-
tect public health and create new jobs 
in detecting and repairing leaks. By 
taking a stand today for environmental 
progress and good governance, we can 
begin to repair the immense damage 
done by Donald Trump. He was an 
enemy of science, a roadblock to 
progress, and a willing saboteur of 
American jobs and health as long as he 
could pursue his anti-environmental 
agenda. 
Today, we have an opportunity to re-
commit to climate action and to envi-
ronmental justice. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has helped expose the deep, sys-
temic, and historic injustices our com-
munities 
of 
color 
and 
low-income 
neighborhoods continue to face, com-
munities like those in Chelsea, MA, 
which has been affected by both poor 
air quality and some of the highest 
COVID–19 infection rates in the State 
and the Nation, or Weymouth, MA, 
which grapples daily with the public 
health and public safety threat of a 
natural gas compressor station. 
Big oil and big gas corporations have 
used places like Weymouth as a way 
station for pollution, without fear of 
reprisal for emissions of methane and 
toxic compounds. This week, we can 
stand up for justice for these commu-
nities instead of idly standing by. 
By passing this resolution on the 
floor this afternoon, we can make real 
progress for the climate, for our global 
community, and for all Americans who 
breathe different air because of their 
race, their ZIP Code, or their income 
level. 
In 
Massachusetts, 
Ralph 
Waldo 
Emerson said that health is the first 
wealth. Today’s vote is a decisive vic-
tory for our families. It will give the 
Biden administration the tools it needs 
to shut in this methane for a very inex-
pensive cost to the oil and gas indus-
try, providing real benefits to the 
health of our planet and the health of 
families in our country. As a result, I 
urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on that CRA. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA POWER 
Mr. President, I would like to speak 
on behalf of the nominee of the Biden 
administration to become the Adminis-
trator for the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development or USAID. 
He has a great nominee, Samantha 
Power, for this job. As noted in a New 
Yorker profile of her, Samantha’s last 
name, Power, comes from the Irish ‘‘de 
Paor’’ meaning ‘‘of the poor.’’ Fit-
tingly, she has dedicated her entire life 
in service of others, using her razor- 
sharp intelligence and fierce advocacy 
as a journalist, activist, and diplomat 
to stand with the world’s voiceless 
masses, all while simultaneously ad-
vancing U.S. interests by building 
bonds in every corner of the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2268 
April 28, 2021 
Ambassador Power has been known 
to be ferocious in the pursuit of justice, 
human rights, and democracy, always 
taking time to listen to other points of 
view with great humility. 
While she disagrees with Henry Kis-
singer on everything from politics to 
the no-brainer debate of the Red Sox 
versus the Yankees, Henry Kissinger 
said that Samantha ‘‘has an excellent 
analytical mind, and even on matters 
where I might have come to different 
conclusions, I respected her analysis’’— 
perhaps the highest praise ever given 
by a Yankees fan to a member of Red 
Sox Nation, of which she is proudly a 
member. 
As 
an 
immigrant 
from 
Ireland, 
Samantha’s personal background gives 
her a unique and deep respect for this 
country and all that it stands for. 
Spending time between Pittsburgh, At-
lanta, Dublin, and Boston, she received 
her bachelor’s degree at Yale Univer-
sity and went on to obtain her law de-
gree at Harvard University. She served 
in several key positions during the 
Obama administration, including as 
the Special Assistant to the President, 
the National Security Council Senior 
Director for Multilateral Affairs and 
Human Rights, and, notably, as the 
youngest ever U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations. 
Prior to entering government serv-
ice, she began her career as a war cor-
respondent, reporting from the siege of 
Sarajevo, became a Pulitzer Prize-win-
ning author, and served as the founding 
executive director of the Carr Center 
for Human Rights Policy at Harvard 
University. 
As she takes on the important work 
of 
leading 
USAID, 
the 
challenges 
Samantha 
Power 
will 
face 
are 
daunting: recovering from a global pan-
demic, revamping the state of global 
democracy, tackling the climate crisis, 
and extending lifesaving assistance to 
the nearly 1 billion people around the 
world who go to bed hungry every sin-
gle night. I know of no person more 
qualified to take on this task. She em-
bodies that bold red, white, and blue 
USAID logo, which states ‘‘From the 
American People.’’ 
In 2015, Samantha Power invited me 
to be her guest to attend His Holiness 
Pope 
Francis’s 
address 
before 
the 
United Nations General Assembly. For 
two Irish Catholics from Massachu-
setts, it was the experience of a life-
time. On that day, Pope Francis spoke 
of the need for compassion, inclusivity, 
and action to tackle the world’s shared 
challenges. Samantha’s career personi-
fies each of these qualities, and I know 
she 
will 
take 
her 
compassion, 
inclusivity, and unwavering desire for 
action and achieve great things for the 
people of the United States and for the 
world at USAID. 
There is no one better qualified, ever, 
to serve as the head of this Agency, 
and I would, with the greatest of en-
thusiasm, recommend an ‘‘aye’’ vote 
from every Member of the Senate on 
her confirmation as our Administrator 
of this great group who serves in every 
country around the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this 
body does not have to automatically 
raise taxes to pay for infrastructure. 
Now, I know some of my colleagues 
would disagree with me. Some want to 
raise the gasoline tax. The President— 
well, I think he wants to raise every 
tax known to man and beast to spend 
on infrastructure and other things. And 
that is—he is the President. He is an 
American. He is entitled to his own 
opinion. 
But I don’t think we spent nearly 
enough time looking at our current 
spending and asking ourselves if we 
could reprioritize some of the ways 
that we are spending taxpayer money. 
Let me put it another way. No person 
with even a casual relationship with 
the Federal budget and/or an IQ above 
a root vegetable believes that every 
single penny being spent today in the 
U.S. Government’s budget is being 
spent efficiently. I mean, it is just not, 
Mr. President. You know that. You 
have run a State before. You have put 
together a budget before. It is not. For 
example, we waste $144 billion a year, 
every year, on improper payments. We 
send checks to people who are not enti-
tled to receive them—for the earned in-
come tax credit, for example. We spend 
money on people who don’t exist or 
aren’t qualified to receive Medicaid. 
We even send money to dead people, 
and they cash the checks—or at least 
their relatives do. 
Now, I am not naive. I know that we 
will never ever—an organization as 
large as the Federal Government will 
never be able to avoid a percentage of 
improper payments. I understand that. 
But we ought to at least try, particu-
larly on sending the checks to dead 
people. Even if we could reduce that 
$144 billion by 10 percent or 20 percent 
or 25 percent, we are talking about a 
very large amount of recurring rev-
enue. 
A very simple solution—I suggested 
this to the White House, which hasn’t 
responded—we have passed legislation 
in this body, as you know, to try to 
stop sending checks to dead people. 
There is just one problem: It was made 
effective 3 years from now. I had to 
agree to it in conference to get the bill 
passed. There is no good reason for it 
other than some lobbyists insisted on 
it. 
President Biden right now, I think, 
could pick up at least $10 billion, 
maybe more—we are not sure how 
much—by just saying: Effective imme-
diately, my administration is no longer 
going to send checks to dead people. I 
mean, who is going to get mad? Who 
supports sending money to dead peo-
ple? The American people don’t. 
No. 
2, 
we 
could 
repurpose 
the 
money—a lot of the money that we 
have already appropriated. I have lost 
count on how much money we have ap-
propriated for coronavirus—not just on 
public health but also for our economy. 
Look, I voted for many of the bills. I 
didn’t vote for the last one because I 
felt the last one was unnecessary, it 
was too expensive, and it really wasn’t 
about the coronavirus. 
But I think all fairminded people can 
agree right now on two things: No. 1, a 
lot of the money we appropriated in 
the last coronavirus bill has not been 
spent, and No. 2, we are no longer in an 
economic crisis. The main crisis we 
have right now is that our small busi-
ness women and small business men 
can’t find workers. 
So we are currently not in an eco-
nomic crisis, and I think we can go 
back and take some of that money— 
and my State, Louisiana is going to 
take—some aspects of my State gov-
ernment—it will take them 10 years to 
spend all the money we sent to them in 
the last bill. I can tell you, given the 
option in my State, they are going to 
choose to spend that money on infra-
structure and not on what Congress 
sent them the money to spend it on. 
No. 3, there is a very interesting 
study by the CBO taking the years—I 
think it was 2013 to 2017. The CBO took 
the entire Federal nonmilitary work-
force, on which we spend $220 billion a 
year because we have to have workers, 
and they took every job in the Federal 
Government and compared it to every 
equivalent job in the private sector. It 
was a massive study. So it is apples to 
apples. The CBO found that the Federal 
Government, on average, pays a Fed-
eral worker 17 percent more annually 
than we pay the same worker in the 
private sector. 
Now, I won’t begrudge anybody a liv-
ing, but what if we could reduce that to 
15 percent or 12 percent? What if we 
could just not automatically fill every 
vacancy? What if we actually stopped 
and asked ourselves, if this position 
has been vacant for 8 months, maybe 
we don’t need it. I think there are 
enormous savings to be had. 
The final thing I will point out: 
Doing is better than having. Doing is 
better than having. You are happier 
when you have earned something than 
when somebody has just given it to 
you. 
We are the most generous Nation in 
all of human history. The American 
people spend about $1 trillion a year 
helping our neighbors and some folks 
who are not our neighbors but are less 
fortunate than we are. But we spend 
about $76 billion a year on Medicaid 
and on food stamps for adults who are 
able-bodied, who are 55 years of age and 
younger, and who don’t have children. 
Many of them could work. Now, I know 
there are obstacles to them being able 
to work. Maybe they need help looking 
for a job. Maybe they need employment 
counseling. Maybe they need help with 
transportation. But we could save 
enormous amounts of money, and our 
citizens, our people, and our neighbors, 
who are receiving this money, would be 
better off if they had a job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2269 
April 28, 2021 
We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. 
All we have to do is look to Denmark. 
Denmark does an extraordinary job. 
They are very generous in Denmark 
with their payments for unemploy-
ment, but they also have an infrastruc-
ture set up in government, which we 
could do, which works with people to 
get them a job and to get them off wel-
fare. And Denmark has saved an enor-
mous amount of money. Let me say it 
again. Doing is better than having. 
Am I saying we could save 100 per-
cent of that $75 billion? No. I don’t 
know how much we could save. Nobody 
else does either because we have never 
tried. 
Now, in about—I don’t know—7 min-
utes, I have just given you four or five 
ideas. I am not suggesting that this is 
anything. I am not pretending that I 
just discovered gravity or something. 
This isn’t Earth-shaking. I mean, you 
can find this with just a cursory 
amount of research. Just call the folks 
over at the Congressional Budget Office 
and ask them: What are some ways we 
can save money in our Federal budget? 
I just think we would all feel so much 
better. I know the American taxpayer 
would feel a lot better, if just for a lit-
tle while, as we talk about the impor-
tance of infrastructure, true infra-
structure—roads, bridges, broadband— 
if we just spent a little while, as we 
talk about infrastructure, on how to 
pay for it without putting our hand 
even further, deeper, and more fre-
quently in the taxpayers’ pockets, be-
cause it can be done. I watched the 
Presiding Officer do it in Colorado. I 
have seen too many public officials do 
it. I think we need to at least try. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of S.J. Res. 
14, which we will vote on later today. I 
want to thank Senator HEINRICH, Sen-
ator MARKEY, and Senator KING
for 
their leadership on this resolution. And 
I might be mistaken here, but I under-
stand that when the Presiding Officer 
was Governor of Colorado, the Pre-
siding Officer might have set the prece-
dent for the creation of this point of 
view that is expressed in the resolution 
before us. So the Navy salutes Colo-
rado. 
The American people rely on the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to 
ensure that our Nation has clean air, 
clean water, a clean environment, and 
a safe climate. Unfortunately, in 2020, 
under the previous administration, the 
EPA strayed from its mission any 
number of times. 
One of those missteps was that Agen-
cy’s methane rescission rule, which de-
regulated methane emissions from the 
oil and gas industry—our Nation’s larg-
est industrial source of this dangerous 
greenhouse gas. By passing this resolu-
tion, Congress, today, will reject and 
nullify this dangerous rule and restore 
clean air and climate protections from 
our Nation’s largest sources of meth-
ane pollution. 
Let me explain what methane is and 
why it is so harmful to our climate and 
to our health. 
Methane is a super pollutant that 
damages our lungs and our planet. 
Compared to carbon dioxide, methane 
is a small part of our overall green-
house gas emissions. Having said that, 
though, scientists tell us that methane 
is responsible for roughly—get this— 
one-quarter of the manmade global 
warming that we are witnessing today. 
Let me say that again: Methane is re-
sponsible for roughly one-quarter of 
the manmade global warming that we 
are experiencing and witnessing today. 
Over a 20-year period, methane is 84 
times more harmful to our climate 
than carbon dioxide—84 times. For a 
small 
molecule, 
methane 
punches 
above its weight when it comes to its 
contributions to climate change. 
The oil and gas industry is our Na-
tion’s largest source of methane, re-
sponsible for nearly 30 percent of total 
methane emissions. For comparison, 
this amount of methane pollution has 
the same climate effect as the emis-
sions from our Nation’s entire fleet of 
passenger vehicles in a year. 
In addition to damaging our climate, 
methane emissions also contribute to 
ground-level ozone, known as smog. 
Breathing in smog harms our lungs, 
and it aggravates lung diseases like 
bronchitis and asthma. Exposure to 
smog has been linked to premature 
death, and children and the elderly are 
particularly vulnerable to these health 
risks. If we want to meaningfully tack-
le the danger to our health and our cli-
mate, we need to reduce methane emis-
sions from the entire oil and gas sec-
tor. 
In 2016, as I was alluding to earlier, 
the EPA acted to do just that. Building 
on State actions, such as in Colorado, 
whose former chief executive is pre-
siding at this moment, the EPA put 
into place commonsense Clean Air Act 
regulations that required the oil and 
gas industry to update its equipment. 
The rule also required the industry to 
inspect frequently in order to find and 
repair leaks and malfunctions that are 
such a big source of our methane prob-
lem. 
Based on feedback from the oil and 
gas industry meeting, these new emis-
sion requirements did not place an 
undue burden on companies or raise 
costs for consumers. In fact, many oil 
and gas companies and industry groups 
supported the measures, and they still 
do. That is why it was so surprising 
when, in September of 2020, the EPA 
issued the final methane rescission rule 
to roll back what so many believed to 
be commonsense approaches for reduc-
ing methane risks. 
While 
the 
Trump 
administration 
moved forward with this damaging pol-
icy, 
the 
consequences 
of 
climate 
change were roiling—roiling—our Na-
tion. California, for example, experi-
enced its worst wildfire season on 
record, with historic forest fires cov-
ering an area about the size of the 
State of Rhode Island. Other Western 
States—including 
Oregon, 
Montana, 
and Colorado—were ablaze with un-
precedented damaging wildfires. 
At the same time, other parts of our 
country were being battered by violent, 
extreme weather. The people of Iowa 
experienced one of the most costly 
thunderstorms in history, with hurri-
cane force winds, causing $7.5 billion in 
economic damage. It flattened, I am 
told, over half of that State’s corn and 
soybean crops in one day. 
Coastal towns in Southern States 
like Florida, like Louisiana, and like 
South Carolina were battered by hurri-
cane after hurricane after hurricane. In 
the summer of 2020, last summer, we 
saw the most hurricanes in the Atlan-
tic Ocean in recorded history. 
Despite all of this, the Trump admin-
istration took a step to undo one of the 
key tools available to us to combat 
methane 
emissions 
that 
contribute 
greatly to climate change. The meth-
ane rescission rule was a stark depar-
ture from the widely accepted, science- 
based, and commonsense view that we 
should protect people and our planet 
from the dangers of methane. 
In promulgating the methane rescis-
sion rule, the Trump administration ig-
nored the global scientific community, 
including EPA’s own Agency scientists, 
who warned that the extreme weather 
events of 2020 were just the tip of the 
iceberg of consequences we can expect 
if we don’t keep global warming below 
an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius be-
tween now and 2040. 
The bottom line is that the Trump 
methane rescission rule would allow 
more methane pollution, increase pub-
lic health dangers, and bring us ever 
closer to the brink of irreversible cli-
mate catastrophe. It is this Trump 
EPA action that my colleagues and I 
reject today through the resolution be-
fore us. 
The methane rescission rule stated 
that methane couldn’t be regulated 
under the Clean Air Act. We reject 
that. The methane rescission rule stat-
ed that EPA couldn’t regulate the en-
tire oil and gas sector from wellhead to 
storage. We reject that. The methane 
rescission rule stated that greenhouse 
gasses couldn’t be regulated. We reject 
that. The methane rescission rule also 
reversed EPA’s longstanding position 
on what is required to regulate a pol-
lutant, making it harder for EPA to 
implement clean air and climate pro-
tections. We reject that as well. 
With approval of this resolution, 
though, EPA can and should still move 
forward to strengthen methane stand-
ards for the oil and gas sector in the fu-
ture. This effort is also very timely, 
coming on the heels of President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2270 
April 28, 2021 
Biden’s climate commitment for our 
Nation to reduce emissions by 50 per-
cent from 2005 levels by the end of this 
decade—by 2030. 
Passing this resolution will be good 
for our health. Passing this resolution 
will be good for our planet. And passing 
this resolution will be good for Amer-
ica’s economy. That is why so many 
States, so many environmental groups, 
and even a number of significant oil 
and gas companies support this resolu-
tion. 
Joining 
over 
60 
environmental 
groups, as well as 20 State attorneys 
general, seven major oil and gas com-
panies support today’s resolution to re-
instate requirements to control meth-
ane emissions. From the Environ-
mental Defense Fund to Shell, from the 
League of Conservation Voters to BP, 
from the Natural Resources Defense 
Council to Equinor, there is a broad 
consensus among stakeholders with 
different 
interests—different 
inter-
ests—that Congress should reject and 
nullify the methane rescission rule. 
So why do a number of oil and gas 
companies want Congress to reject the 
Trump rule, restore existing regula-
tions, and pursue further regulations? 
They know the best way to boost 
growth in their sector and across the 
economy is to keep methane and other 
climate pollution in check. With un-
checked methane releases in its oper-
ations, natural gas production and use 
become part of the climate problem, 
not a part of the solution as we endeav-
or to drive toward lower carbon fuels. 
Companies know where the global 
market is heading. They know regula-
tions will support innovation and tech-
nology deployment in their industry, 
bringing down emission reduction costs 
for everyone. 
I sometimes like to quote Albert Ein-
stein, who said, among other things: 
‘‘In adversity lies opportunity.’’ Think 
about that: ‘‘In adversity lies oppor-
tunity.’’ We can see that in the issue of 
methane 
pollution 
and 
in 
climate 
change. It presents plenty of chal-
lenges. Yes, that is true. But it also 
presents a remarkable opportunity. It 
is an opportunity for us to protect our 
planet, 
improve 
the 
air 
that 
we 
breathe, and strengthen our economy. 
At the same time, the product that 
the oil and gas industry is capturing 
can be sold to fuel more homes and 
businesses across the country. I want 
to say that again, too. At the same 
time, the product that the oil and gas 
industry is capturing can be sold to 
fuel more homes and businesses across 
the country. That is why today I will 
gladly vote for this resolution, which 
reaffirms that the Clean Air Act re-
quires EPA to take action to protect 
Americans from dangerous pollution 
like methane. 
In passing this resolution today, Con-
gress is rejecting the Trump rule’s 
baseless interpretation of the Clean Air 
Act and, in its place, reinstating com-
monsense methane public health and 
climate protections across the entire 
oil and gas sector. We are also clearing 
a path for additional protections from 
methane and other hazardous climate 
pollutants. 
As a Senate, we are making our in-
tent clear: The Clean Air Act gives 
EPA the authority and the mandate to 
establish methane emissions standards, 
even stronger than the ones we rein-
state with this resolution. This in-
cludes all facets of the oil and gas in-
dustry now and moving forward, from 
production to processing and from 
transmission to storage. 
We are saying to EPA loud and clear: 
It is your mission to protect the envi-
ronment, to protect human health and 
public welfare from the dangers of cli-
mate pollutants like methane. And 
there is a lot of work still to do before 
that mission can be achieved. It is time 
that we get to that work. We don’t 
have a lot of time to waste. 
I have a couple of unanimous consent 
requests I would like to offer. One is to 
place supportive materials into the 
RECORD. I ask unanimous consent to 
enter into the RECORD several of my 
materials in support of S.J. Res. 14 
that is before us today; first, the Biden 
administration’s Statement of Admin-
istration Policy supporting passage of 
the resolution; second, two letters of 
support for passing this joint resolu-
tion—one from the 57 leading environ-
mental and advocacy groups and an-
other, the Shell Oil Company. 
These 
letters 
demonstrate 
the 
breadth of support for regulating this 
harmful pollutant and rejecting the 
methane rescission rule. 
I ask unanimous consent for these to 
be inserted into the RECORD as appro-
priate. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
S.J. RES. 14—A
JOINT
RESOLUTION
PROVIDING 
FOR
CONGRESSIONAL
DISAPPROVAL
UNDER 
CHAPTER 8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE, 
OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE ENVIRON-
MENTAL
PROTECTION
AGENCY
RELATING
TO 
‘‘OIL
AND
NATURAL
GAS
SECTOR: EMISSION 
STANDARDS FOR NEW, RECONSTRUCTED, AND 
MODIFIED SOURCES REVIEW’’ 
(Sen. Heinrich, D–NM, and 23 cosponsors) 
The Administration supports passage of 
S.J. Res. 14, a joint resolution providing for 
congressional disapproval of the rule ‘‘Oil 
and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards 
for 
New, 
Reconstructed, 
and 
Modified 
Sources Review,’’ published at 85 Fed. Reg. 
57018 (September 14, 2020). This action would 
ensure that this rule, which eliminated pol-
lution standards for methane emissions from 
the oil and gas sector and eliminated all 
emission standards for the transmission and 
storage segments of that sector, will have no 
force or effect and reinstate the pollution re-
duction requirements established under the 
Clean Air Act in 2012 and 2016. 
Addressing methane leaks through detec-
tion and repair by using already cost-effec-
tive technologies can spur the creation of 
good-paying jobs fixing leaking equipment 
and pipelines—all while minimizing waste 
and reducing this powerful source of pollu-
tion. Today, the oil and gas sector is the 
largest industrial source of methane emis-
sions—a potent climate-disrupting green-
house gas that is responsible for approxi-
mately one-third of the global warming and 
the resulting climate disruption we are al-
ready experiencing from climate change. In 
order to effectively mitigate climate change, 
addressing methane pollution from this and 
other sectors is an urgent and essential step. 
Every American has a fundamental right 
to breathe clean air and drink clean water. 
These methane emissions—leaking during oil 
and gas production, transmission, and dis-
tribution activities—also contribute to the 
formation of smog, or ground-level ozone, 
which is harmful to both human health and 
agriculture. Oil and gas production is also a 
significant 
emitter 
of 
carcinogenic 
and 
smog-forming volatile organic compounds 
into frontline communities. These commu-
nities, as well as children, the elderly, out-
door workers, and individuals with res-
piratory conditions, are at higher risk of ex-
periencing harmful health outcomes due to 
exposure to such pollution. Oil and gas pollu-
tion can also be carried by the wind and in-
tensify air pollution problems in commu-
nities along that path, including across state 
boundaries. 
The Clean Air Act authorizes the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect 
Americans from dangerous air pollution, in-
cluding methane and volatile organic com-
pounds. Nonetheless, the rule that this reso-
lution disapproves of took four harmful ac-
tions that increased the amount of harmful 
pollution to which Americans are exposed: 
(1) the elimination of pollution standards for 
methane emissions from the oil and gas sec-
tor; (2) the elimination of all air pollution 
standards for the transmission and storage 
segments of the oil and gas sector; (3) re-
moval of the predicate that establishes 
EPA’s obligation to address the extensive 
methane 
pollution 
emitted 
by 
existing 
sources; and (4) establishment of a new, non- 
statutory requirement that EPA make an 
additional, pollutant-specific finding of sig-
nificant contribution to endangerment be-
fore addressing harmful air pollution from a 
sector already regulated under the Clean Air 
Act. All four of these actions would be re-
versed by the passage and signature of the 
resolution. 
S.J. Res. 14 will restore robust Clean Air 
Act pollution standards for this sector, pro-
tecting American communities. The resolu-
tion will also clear the pathway for EPA to 
evaluate opportunities to promulgate even 
stronger standards under section 111 of the 
Clean Air Act to address dangerous methane 
and other pollution from both new and exist-
ing sources across the oil and gas sector. The 
Administration looks forward to working 
with the Congress to restore these critically 
important pollution standards.

standards. We urge Congress to swiftly vote 
to pass this resolution, an action which 
would allow the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to accelerate strengthening 
safeguards against methane and other pollu-
tion. 
As you know, methane is a potent pollut-
ant that is responsible for around 25 percent 
of the impacts of climate change we are ex-
periencing today. In 2016, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) established regula-
tions to tackle methane and other dangerous 
emissions from new and modified sources 
within the oil and gas sector, which is the 
largest industrial source of methane pollu-
tion. This action took concrete steps to im-
plement science-based standards to combat 
previously unchecked emissions. The oil and 
gas sector is likewise a significant source of 
smog-forming volatile organic compounds 
and hazardous air pollutants in communities 
across the nation. 
In the waning days of the previous admin-
istration, EPA finalized a rule that elimi-
nated safeguards that protect our climate 
and communities from oil and gas pollution 
and attempted to erect barriers to the pro-
mulgation of future standards. Many oil and 
gas operators, natural gas users like utili-
ties, states, and environmental and health 
groups support federal standards to regulate 
methane emissions. Many environmental and 
health groups, state and local governments, 
utilities and other gas purchasers, oil and 
gas operators, and even the American Petro-
leum Institute (API), have expressed support 
for federal rules to curb the oil and gas in-
dustry’s wasteful methane releases—wasted 
gas worth $2.4 billion, which could be used to 
heat approximately 12.5 million homes in a 
year. Adopting S.J. Res. 14 and H.J. Res. 34 
will reinstate pollution protections and clear 
the path for EPA to move forward with wide-
ly-supported, sensible safeguards for meth-
ane and other pollution from oil and gas pro-
duction. 
We must take early action to reduce harm-
ful methane emissions as a necessary step to 
combating the climate crisis. Regulation of 
dangerous methane emissions is critical to 
lowering the magnitude of warming we will 
experience around 2050. We need leaders who 
will fight for a healthier future and seek am-
bitious next-generation standards for new 
and existing oil and gas facilities. S.J. Res. 
14 provides the EPA with a clean slate to get 
back to a regulatory process that makes sci-
entific sense and gets our goal of ambitious 
methane emissions reductions back on track, 
while advancing our collective climate and 
environmental justice goals.

Hon. TOM CARPER, 
Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment 
and Public Works, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE,

Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy

DEAR CHAIRMAN CARPER, RANKING MEMBER 
CAPITO, CHAIRMAN
PALLONE, AND
RANKING 
MEMBER RODGERS: Shell supports passage of 
a proposed joint resolution of disapproval 
under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) 
to rescind the 2020 rule ‘‘Oil and Natural Gas 
Sector: Emission Standards for New, Recon-
structed and Modified Sources Review’’ and 
reinstate the direct regulation of methane 
emissions from new and modified sources es-
tablished by the Environmental Protection 
Agency in 2016. 
Beginning in 2015, Shell worked with EPA 
and industry peers to develop a workable ap-
proach to regulating methane from onshore 
oil and gas sources. Shell was the first oil 
major to signal support for the rule. Begin-
ning in 2017, Shell urged the Trump Adminis-
tration to make desired refinements to the 
regulation, but to maintain the direct regu-
lation of methane from onshore sources es-
tablished by the previous Administration. 
The efficient regulation of methane from 
onshore oil and gas production makes good 
business sense, as methane captured is meth-
ane sold, advances the energy transition and 
expands the role of natural gas as a transi-
tion fuel. The 2016 rule sparked innovation, 
contributing to the development of more ef-
ficient and affordable pneumatics, better 
cameras and new airborne imagery, tools 
that help us better understand and control 
methane leaks from our assets. 
I have appreciated the leadership of those 
in Congress working to advance this joint 
resolution. I have attached an oped in sup-
port of the resolution published last week in 
the Houston Chronicle. 
Sincerely, 
GRETCHEN WATKINS, 
President. 
Mr. CARPER. Now, Mr. President, I 
will yield the floor, but before I do, I 
want to salute you for your role in an 
earlier day, in an earlier place, your 
State of Colorado, for helping get this 
started. We are in your debt. Good 
work. God bless. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, it has 
been nearly 100 days since President 
Biden delivered his inaugural address, 
promising our Nation ‘‘unity, not divi-
sion.’’ He called on all of us to ‘‘listen 
to one another,’’ noting that unity ‘‘re-
quires more than words.’’ 
I was there, and I was listening. I was 
hopeful that he actually meant what 
he said. But that very same day, as 
soon as he reached the other end of 
Pennsylvania Avenue, President Biden 
seemed to forget his own words as he 
began signing a record number of Exec-
utive orders. 
With the stroke of a pen, he unilater-
ally created a new migrant crisis by re-
versing the previous administration’s 
successful policies and ceasing con-
struction of the wall. 
He also killed thousands of jobs for 
American workers by canceling the XL 
Pipeline. And that was just his first 
day on the job. 
Since then, the President and his 
Democratic allies in Congress have 
used a partisan process to fast-track 
trillions of dollars of new spending for 
their pricey pet projects. 
Despite the President’s call for us to 
listen to one another, the Democrats 
are planning to, once again, fast-track 
another $2.2 trillion package being sold 
as 
an 
‘‘infrastructure’’ 
bill, 
even 
though it spends less on roads and 
bridges than it does on parts of the So-
cialist Green New Deal and other pro-
gressive priorities. 
And then right after that, they want 
to ram through another $1 trillion for 
so-called human infrastructure. 
The Democrats are threatening to 
end the right of Senators to debate by 
abolishing the filibuster so they can 
shove through their extreme agenda. 
This would fundamentally change the 
Senate, which has long been known as 
the world’s—not just America’s but the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, in 
which every State has equal represen-
tation and every Senator is given a 
voice in our national conversations. 
It is an interesting twist for the 
party that just a year ago proudly re-
sisted nearly every effort put forth to 
address the problems facing our Na-
tion. 
For purely partisan political reasons, 
Democrats even filibustered—yes, they 
filibustered—the JUSTICE Act that 
would have provided police reform fol-
lowing the deaths of George Floyd and 
others. 
This week, the Nation will have the 
opportunity to hear from the author of 
that bill, my dear friend Senator TIM 
SCOTT of South Carolina, who is deliv-
ering the Republican response to the 
President’s address this evening. No 
one better represents the type of posi-
tive leadership we need to unify our 
Nation than TIM. He truly is the per-
fect voice for the American dream. 
Growing up in a poor, single-parent 
household, TIM’s mother worked hard

to make ends meet. Despite some early 
challenges and setbacks, TIM success-
fully started his own business and was 
chosen, time and again, to serve in 
public office. 
As a Senator, TIM is focused on cre-
ating opportunities for others by tap-
ping into the potential of individuals 
and communities. TIM listens, and he 
works hard to bring people together. 
Folks, that is what President Biden 
promised to do, but he is not living up 
to that promise. Frankly, the Presi-
dent only seems to be listening to the 
far-left progressives within the Demo-
cratic Party who live on their own lib-
eral ‘‘Fantasy Island.’’ 
He and his liberal allies on the left 
are pushing tax hikes on working 
Americans, while giving tax breaks to 
wealthy coastal elites. They are bring-
ing back corrupt and costly earmarks. 
Democrats want to defund our police 
and abolish ICE. They want to remake 
nearly every aspect of our economy 
with their radical Green New Deal. The 
Democrats are plotting to pack the Su-
preme Court with ultraliberal Justices 
and destroy that institution. And to 
pad their numbers in Congress, Demo-
crats are attempting to make Wash-
ington, DC, a State. 
Does that sound like the unity and 
bipartisanship we were promised on 
day one? It sure doesn’t, folks. 
If President Biden actually listened 
to the voices of Americans who live 
outside of the DC swamp, he wouldn’t 
be hearing a demand for any of those 
radical proposals. 
The Senate is split 50–50, while 
Democrats hold a razor-slim majority 
in the House of Representatives. And 
according to a recent Gallup poll, an 
overwhelming two-thirds of Americans 
say they are dissatisfied with the way 
things are going in the United States. 
Based upon those responses, it sounds 
like the Democrats’ radical agenda is 
dividing, not unifying, our country. 
Iowans want Democrats and Repub-
licans to set aside partisan differences 
and work together on our national in-
terests. They want students to be able 
to safely return to their classroom and 
for folks to go back to work. 
Iowans want us to fix our roads and 
bridges and expand broadband to rural 
areas. They worry about the growing 
global influence of Communist China 
and the humanitarian and national se-
curity crisis on our southern border. 
They want us to protect the American 
dream for future generations. 
Folks, we can do this. 
President Biden, if you are listening, 
please hear me out. Giving into the 
deafening demands of the loudest on 
the left and attempting to silence half 
of the country will not solve our prob-
lems. It will only divide us more. 
To succeed, we need to consider the 
voices of all Americans and speak to 
what unites us so we can overcome our 
challenges. And we can overcome these 
challenges together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. First, Madam Presi-
dent, I would like to associate myself 
with the remarks of the Senator from 
Iowa, who did a magnificent job of 
pointing out what we are facing as a 
nation. And I admire her fortitude, her 
hard work, and her dedication as the 
vice chairman of the Republican con-
ference. 
Madam President, 99 days ago, Joe 
Biden took office. He took the oath of 
office. We were there. He gave an inau-
gural address. He said that ‘‘with 
unity, we can do great things.’’ He said 
that ‘‘unity is the path forward.’’ Well, 
that was the last example of unity and 
bipartisanship that we have seen from 
President Biden. He has lost all credi-
bility when it comes to bipartisanship 
or unity. 
In just 99 days, President Biden has 
already shown himself to be one of the 
most radical Presidents in American 
history. 
When I am in Wyoming, as I am 
every weekend and have been over 
Easter, as well, traveling the State and 
talking to people, they ask about two 
specific issues; one is energy, and the 
second is the southern border. On these 
two specific issues, President Biden has 
already done tremendous damage— 
damage to our country, damage to our 
people, damage to our economy. 
Right after his inaugural address 
about unity, President Biden drove to 
the White House, sat there, went in, 
and threw the unity speech out the 
window, and he drew a big target on 
the back of American energy, and he 
pulled the trigger. He shut down the 
Keystone XL Pipeline; he ended new 
fossil fuel projects on Federal lands; 
and he cut off traditional energy loans 
to developing nations that need our 
help and look to us for help. 
Well, these steps aren’t going to re-
duce carbon emission, but they will 
most certainly reduce jobs and wages 
for American energy workers. 
Also, on his first day, President 
Biden flipped on the big green light 
switch on our southern border. He sent 
out the word, laid out the welcome 
mat, and people from around the world 
came illegally to the United States. He 
stopped construction on the border 
wall, and he ended a policy that was 
successful. The policy was that known 
as the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
Now, the result wasn’t just one crisis; 
it was two. It was a humanitarian cri-
sis, and it was also a national security 
crisis. 
It is a national security crisis be-
cause two-thirds of the Border Patrol 
agents—and I went to the border and 
went with a number of Republican Sen-
ators and went on a midnight patrol 
with our border agents, and they told 
us that two-thirds of the Border Patrol 
agents are unable to do their jobs and 
keep us safe, unable to be there to en-
force the law. And they said that, so 
far, people have come into the country 
illegally from 56 different nations. 
The whole world knows the border is 
open. Our friends know it; our enemies 
know it; and this will make us less safe 
as a nation. 
There is also a humanitarian crisis at 
the border caused by President Biden. 
Just a month ago, a 9-year-old from 
Mexico died trying to cross the Rio 
Grande River. It is heartbreaking. That 
is what happens, though. This is what 
happens when more and more people 
try to come illegally to cross our bor-
der. 
Children who cross the border unac-
companied are sent to a facility that is 
prepared and appropriate for about 250 
children. The day we were there, there 
were 7,000 crammed in like sardines. 
That is Joe Biden’s plan for immigra-
tion. 
Ten percent of these children are 
testing positive for coronavirus. And 
we saw the testing process. We know 
that every child there was exposed to 
coronavirus based on the high percent-
age of those who were testing positive. 
Now, as these young people are re-
leased, those who have tested negative 
but who have just been exposed in the 
days before, they are being sent all 
across America, and they are spreading 
the virus and unknown variants of the 
virus to this country. 
Joe Biden is the superspreader of 
coronavirus today. Democrats think 
this is just fine. 
The Vice President of the United 
States is going to be up here tonight on 
Capitol Hill. She says: ‘‘We’re making 
progress.’’ 
NANCY PELOSI says: ‘‘We’re on a good 
path on the border.’’ 
Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Mayorkas says: ‘‘The border is secure 
and closed,’’ even though he has also 
said this is the worst case in 20 years 
for young people and we are on a path 
for up to 2 million illegal immigrants 
coming across the border this year. 
The White House refuses to use the 
word ‘‘crisis.’’ In fact, when the Presi-
dent and his Press Secretary have acci-
dentally called it a crisis—and they 
both have done that—the White House 
issued a correction. They said: No, no, 
not a crisis; only a challenge. 
Who do they think they are fooling? 
Two million illegal immigrants this 
year is not a challenge. It is a crisis. It 
is chaos at the border. It is cata-
strophic. 
Ninety-nine days ago, none of this 
was happening. For 99 days, Repub-
licans in the U.S. Senate have repeat-
edly looked for common ground with 
President Biden and the Democrats. We 
have stood for American energy. We 
worked to secure the border. Yet for 99 
days those efforts have been blocked by 
President Biden and a Democratic ma-
jority—which is hardly a big majority 
when it is 50–50, which you would think 
would be a mandate to move to the 
middle. 
Well, President Biden still has a 
thousand days or so left in his term. 
Tonight’s speech might sound a lot like 
his inaugural address with lots of 
promises. The American people know 
talk is cheap. It is time for President

Biden to start to practice what he is 
preaching. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
would like to start by thanking my 
colleague from Wyoming and my col-
league from Iowa for their comments 
about where we are as a country 100 
days into the Biden administration. 
It has been discouraging that we 
haven’t seen more bipartisan work and 
with regard to the border, having been 
down there a couple of weeks ago, par-
ticularly discouraging that we can’t 
come up with a bipartisan solution 
that deals with the obvious crisis on 
the border. 
Of course it is a crisis. Everybody 
knows that, including the Biden ad-
ministration. The question is, What are 
we going to do about it? Some of us 
have laid out some proposals that we 
think would be very sensible, that 
could be done on a bipartisan basis. Yet 
we are not getting the kind of coopera-
tion from the White House or the other 
side of the aisle, frankly, with regard 
to dealing with a clear crisis. 
In my time here in Congress, I have 
tried to work to bring Republicans and 
Democrats together on issues. I think 
that is the best thing for our country. 
I think you get, actually, better legis-
lation if you have input from both 
sides, and I think you also have more 
sustainable legislation. 
If you don’t work in a bipartisan 
way, what happens when there is a 50– 
50 Senate, as there is now, and where 
the Vice President can supply the tie- 
breaking vote, and if you do things on 
the basis of reconciliation or getting 
rid of the filibuster, which is what the 
Democratic majority currently would 
like to do, you end up lurching back 
and forth, don’t you? So you pass 
Democratic legislation and then, when 
Republicans take over, Republican leg-
islation. 
We should be focusing on American 
legislation. In my office, we have had 
some success with this bipartisan ap-
proach. Sixty-eight of my bills were 
signed into law by President Obama, 
and 82 of my bills were signed into law 
by President Trump—on important 
issues like the eviction crisis, job cre-
ation, and natural resource protection. 
So it can be done, and President Biden 
knows that. He served here in the Sen-
ate. In fact, he took pride in coming to-
gether with Republicans and Demo-
crats to actually have agreements on 
some of these tough issues. 
Although I didn’t vote for him be-
cause I thought that President Trump 
had better policy ideas, coming into 
this new administration, I was hopeful 
that President Biden would govern as 
he had campaigned. He promised, you 
remember, in his campaign to reach 
out to Republicans and Democrats 
alike. He talked about the need for 
unity. In fact, he gave that same 
speech in the primary and in the gen-
eral election, which I thought took 
some courage, frankly, to do so in the 
primary because most of his opponents 
did not take that position. Yet, now 
having gotten elected, he seems to 
have forgotten the pledges that he 
made. 
I listened to his inaugural address in-
tently, as I hope a lot of Americans 
did—and certainly my colleagues did— 
and he talked again about reaching 
out, going back to the days when we 
could work together, and he focused on 
unity. I was very hopeful with the tone 
he set that day, and I said so at the 
time. Yet that rhetoric has not been 
matched by action. It hasn’t been 
matched by action when it comes to 
key policy initiatives they have al-
ready put forward, including the latest 
COVID–19 spending bill that passed in 
March. 
Remember, despite a 50–50 Senate 
and very tight majority in the House of 
Representatives, there was no outreach 
to Republicans for the COVID–19 legis-
lation. Not a single Republican was 
consulted before unveiling the plan, 
and once it was out there, Democrats 
chose to work only among themselves 
and do it under what is called rec-
onciliation, where they don’t need a 
single Republican vote—this despite 
some of us having an alternative, 
which we actually presented to the 
White House. The next day, we were 
told: Thank you, but we are going to 
take the reconciliation approach, and 
we don’t need any Republican input. 
That is too bad because the COVID–19 
issue, obviously, is one where there has 
been not just bipartisanship but non-
partisanship. Five times last year, we 
passed major COVID–19 legislative ini-
tiatives with huge majorities. In one 
case, the biggest bill, the CARES pack-
age, passed with a 97-to-0 vote here. So 
this is one where we had always been 
able to work together. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion chose the partisan path. Right 
now, the Biden administration is re-
peating this same mistake, as far as I 
can tell, because they have introduced 
their $2.3 trillion infrastructure pack-
age without consulting, again, any Re-
publicans. 
We now hear that the White House 
and some Democratic leaders may 
want to pass this latest partisan pro-
posal by reconciliation as well. I hope 
that is not true because, again, this is 
an 
area—infrastructure—where 
we 
have been able to work together on a 
bipartisan basis and get things done. In 
fact, typically that is how it happens 
with infrastructure. 
Last Congress, we passed a bill out of 
committee on highways and bridges 
with a unanimous vote—not just a ma-
jority vote, a unanimous vote—by Re-
publicans and Democrats. But the pro-
posal they put forward, first, is not 
really about infrastructure because it 
dramatically expands the definition of 
‘‘infrastructure’’ so that it is not at all 
what traditionally you would think or 
I would think of as the kind of hard as-
sets—roads, bridges, ports, airports, 
transit, even broadband. 
Even the most generous description 
of ‘‘infrastructure’’ applied to this bill 
means that less than 20 percent of it, 20 
percent of $2.3 trillion, is about infra-
structure. It is about other things. And 
we can have a debate on those other 
things, whether it is nursing home sub-
sidies or whether it is subsidies to elec-
tric car companies or whether it is 
more childcare. Those are all issues we 
can discuss, but they are not, obvi-
ously, infrastructure issues. 
Proposing to pay for this huge plan 
with taxes on American workers makes 
it even worse. So the $2.3 trillion plan 
is not mostly infrastructure—80 per-
cent is not—but then the taxes that 
would apply to America and to Amer-
ican workers would be devastating, 
making us noncompetitive in the glob-
al economy again after finally we were 
getting our act together. 
In 2018 and 2019, we saw a big increase 
in our economy, large increases in 
terms of employment. Also, wages were 
going up. We had the lowest poverty 
rate in the history of our country, 
going back to the 1950s, partly because 
we were putting in place policies that 
made sense in terms of tax reform to 
create more incentives to invest and 
bring jobs here to this country. That 
would all be changed under these tax 
increases that are being proposed to 
pay for this big, new Biden infrastruc-
ture package. 
Making us less competitive in global 
markets and putting American workers 
at a disadvantage again is not the right 
way to go. The American people don’t 
want that. The American people think 
we should be doing all we can to get 
businesses back on their feet right now 
so that people can get employment and 
so we can ensure that the economy 
continues to improve as we come out of 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
Infrastructure, 
again, 
has 
always 
been so bipartisan. Why would, in this 
case, we want to take it down the par-
tisan road? 
Past Presidents, by the way, have 
shown that they can get big things 
done early in their administration. So 
during this first hundred days, there 
was an opportunity to reach out. I hope 
in the second hundred days, it will be 
different. 
Let me give a couple of examples. 
When President Bill Clinton got elect-
ed, he worked with Republicans and 
Democrats to pass what was called the 
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment. He got a lot of support from the 
Republican side of the aisle—in fact, 
even more than he got from the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle—and he pushed 
that through. Ronald Reagan’s eco-
nomic reforms of 1981 passed the Sen-
ate with an overwhelming margin of 89 
to 11. 
Last night, C–SPAN allowed us to 
look back in history at some of the 
speeches Presidents gave after their 
first hundred days. One was Ronald 
Reagan’s speech to the joint session 
that I saw last night. It was amazing. 
Republicans and Democrats alike were

standing because President Reagan 
said: ‘‘I want to work with all of you.’’ 
And he showed he would work with all 
of them by passing those economic re-
forms in 1981. 
We should all want the Biden admin-
istration to succeed in putting in place 
bipartisan policies that help our con-
stituents and help our country, but 
that can only happen if they agree to 
reverse course and engage with Repub-
licans in a genuine way. That is clearly 
what the American people want. In a 
recent poll, a Washington Post and 
ABC poll, 60 percent of respondents, in-
cluding two-thirds of Independents, 
said they wanted the Biden administra-
tion to work with Republicans to make 
these proposals bipartisan—twice the 
number that wanted him to pursue the 
partisan path chosen so far. 
I suggest to my constituents in Ohio 
and all Americans who will be listening 
tonight: Don’t just listen to the rhet-
oric; look at the action because the 
rhetoric thus far has not been matched 
by actions. 
We were promised bipartisanship as a 
path toward unity. For the sake of our 
country, it is time to keep that prom-
ise. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
rise today to talk about how Congress 
can work together in a bipartisan way 
to pass infrastructure legislation, fol-
lowing my colleagues from Ohio, from 
Wyoming, from Iowa—and my col-
league from North Carolina is here as 
well—with a real desire to come up 
with an infrastructure package, but we 
want it to be bipartisan. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that investing in our national infra-
structure is necessary to increase eco-
nomic growth, ensure global competi-
tiveness of American businesses, and 
create new, high-paying jobs. In fact, 
just last Congress, the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee 
unanimously approved a 5-year surface 
transportation 
reauthorization 
bill, 
which included about $300 billion for 
roads and bridges. That actually rep-
resents a 27-percent increase over the 
FAST Act. We really feel that bill, 
with its bipartisan support, creates a 
starting point—a starting point on a 
bipartisan basis—for the negotiations 
that we should have in developing the 
infrastructure package. 
Tonight we expect the President will 
outline his American Jobs Plan, but 
unfortunately it is not focused on in-
frastructure. It is a massive, $2.25 tril-
lion tax-and-spend bill that dedicates 
less than one-third, just over $600 bil-
lion, toward actual traditional infra-
structure. 
The administration’s plan would in-
crease the corporate tax from 21 per-
cent to 28 percent, resulting in reduced 
wages, increased costs for consumers, 
and a reduction in economic growth. 
The Biden plan would revert the U.S. 
tax system to a worldwide tax system, 
increasing taxes on U.S. multinational 
corporations, reducing the competi-
tiveness of American businesses, and 
driving U.S. jobs and profits to other 
countries. The 2017 tax bill brought the 
United States into a territorial tax 
system for the taxation of multi-
national companies. It has worked. 
From 1985 to 2017, 85 U.S.-based multi-
national corporations took advantage 
of corporate inversions, resulting in a 
$19.5 billion tax revenue loss to the 
U.S. Government. Since the 2017 Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, there have been no 
corporate inversions. The Biden plan 
would abandon this successful ap-
proach. 
Further, the administration has pro-
posed a $35 billion tax increase on U.S. 
energy producers, endangering U.S. en-
ergy independence, costing U.S. jobs, 
and empowering foreign energy produc-
tion. A recent study from the National 
Association of Manufacturers shows 
that nearly 1 million jobs would be lost 
in the first 2 years alone if this tax in-
crease goes through. 
Tonight we expect to hear from 
President Biden on additional pro-
posals to increase taxes on American 
workers as well as increase our debt 
and deficit. For instance, we have seen 
reports today that the President is 
going to seek to repeal stepped-up 
basis. Now, while the administration 
indicates there may be some excep-
tions, repealing stepped-up basis would 
place a significant and complex tax 
burden on small businesses and par-
ticularly family farms and ranches, not 
only in my State of North Dakota but 
across the country. 
Right now, the average age of our 
farmers in America is about 60 years 
old, and we need to get the next gen-
eration into farming, but they can’t do 
it if they have to sell the farm to pay 
the tax. 
A repeal of stepped-up basis would in-
crease the cost of capital, discourage 
investment, reduce the wages of work-
ers, and stunt economic growth in both 
the immediate and long term. A recent 
analysis from Ernst & Young shows 
that eliminating stepped-up basis will 
result in the loss of 80,000 jobs a year 
for the next 10 years and a loss of near-
ly $10 billion in GDP growth per year. 
While we continue to emerge from 
the COVID–19 pandemic, we should not 
be constraining economic growth by in-
creasing taxes and regulation. Instead, 
we should maintain the pro-growth, 
low-tax regime put in place in 2017 by 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and make 
targeted investments in traditional in-
frastructure, while reducing regulatory 
barriers to provide long-term certainty 
to Americans. 
Last week, I met with President 
Biden at the White House to share this 
very message—that Republicans stand 
ready to work with the administration 
and our Democrat colleagues on the in-
frastructure package, in a bipartisan 
and targeted manner, focusing on up-
dating our roads, bridges, railways, air-
ports, broadband, and other traditional 
infrastructure. 
We also support investing in energy 
infrastructure, including enhancing the 
45Q tax credit to accelerate the deploy-
ment of carbon capture and sequestra-
tion technology, as well as pipelines to 
provide the safe and efficient transpor-
tation of our natural resources. 
We should be working together for 
the American people to enact policies 
that will improve our national infra-
structure. To this end, I want to high-
light a number of bipartisan proposals 
that I have been working on with my 
colleagues across the aisle. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion with Senator SMITH, Senator CAP-
ITO, Senator WHITEHOUSE, and others to 
enhance the 45Q tax credit for carbon 
capture and sequestration. 
Also, Senator SMITH and I have legis-
lation that would empower rural elec-
tric and telecom cooperatives to refi-
nance existing debt, reinvest in im-
proved energy efficiency, and expand 
broadband delivery to more of their 
rural customers. 
Likewise, Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman WYDEN and I have introduced 
a bill that would encourage private in-
vestment in infrastructure by expand-
ing private activity bonds and creating 
a new infrastructure tax credit. 
Additionally, I have introduced legis-
lation with Senator BENNET that en-
sures that our farmers, ranchers, and 
producers have the regulatory flexi-
bility needed to safely and efficiently 
move their products—livestock, in par-
ticular—to market while ensuring the 
safety of all road users. 
We don’t need to burden hard-work-
ing Americans with increased taxes in 
order to pay for this. There are a num-
ber of potential options to provide the 
necessary revenue for a targeted infra-
structure package. For example, we 
can make modest changes to our user- 
fee-based highway trust fund system, 
ensuring that electric vehicles pay into 
the fund. We can repurpose unused Fed-
eral spending, including using funds 
from the recent American Rescue Plan 
Act. We could also use revenue gen-
erated from energy production on Fed-
eral lands. These are just a few of the 
ideas we put forward. 
Last week, Ranking Member CAPITO 
of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, along with the ranking 
members of the Banking, Commerce, 
Energy, and Finance Committees, un-
veiled the framework of an almost $600 
billion infrastructure package, which 
focuses investment in traditional infra-
structure. 
We should use this framework and 
begin working through regular order in 
a committee-driven process to produce 
a bipartisan, targeted infrastructure 
bill that does not increase taxes on 
American workers. That way, we truly 
upgrade our infrastructure, create jobs, 
and keep our economy growing. 
That is the right approach. We need 
to work in a bipartisan manner to get 
it done. 
And with that, I yield the floor.

ator from North Carolina.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2275 
April 28, 2021 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleagues from 
North Dakota, Ohio, Wyoming, and 
Iowa, who have spoken before me, and 
my colleague from Kansas, after me. 
I think Senator PORTMAN ended his 
statement by saying that we have 
heard the rhetoric, but we haven’t seen 
the actions. Well, in North Carolina, 
our State motto, in Latin, is ‘‘Esse 
quam videri.’’ It means: To be, rather 
than to seem. 
I think our State motto does a good 
job of summarizing the first 100 days of 
the Biden administration. As a Presi-
dential candidate, Joe Biden made it 
seem that he would govern as a mod-
erate, pragmatic deal maker, and he 
set the bar high in his inaugural ad-
dress. He said: 
My whole soul is in this: bringing America 
together, uniting our people, [and] uniting 
our nation. I ask every American to join me 
in this cause. 
I was actually inspired by that state-
ment, and I am one of the Americans 
who was willing to work for him on 
that cause. In fact, I was 1 of the 10 Re-
publicans who had the first official 
meeting with the President to see if we 
could come to common ground on the 
COVID relief package, after having 
successfully 
passed 
five 
bipartisan 
COVID relief packages in the last Con-
gress. 
Unfortunately, the President’s ac-
tions have not corresponded with his 
promises to date. Instead of leading on 
his instincts to bring America to-
gether, President Biden has followed 
his advisers’ recommendations to go it 
alone. He has pushed a highly partisan, 
ideologically driven agenda. 
And you don’t need to take my word 
for it. New York Representative ALEX-
ANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ
recently 
de-
clared that President Biden has exceed-
ed the expectations of progressives. 
Indeed, there has been a lot in 
Biden’s agenda for the left to like. It is 
an agenda designed to pass with no 
need for moderation and not a single 
Republican vote—no consensus whatso-
ever—proposing tax hikes on American 
families and businesses at a time that 
they are trying to rebound from the 
pandemic. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the 
middle of a national emergency. We are 
in the middle of a pandemic. We have 
spent and appropriated billions of dol-
lars to healthcare, to businesses to re-
cover. And now, long before the na-
tional emergency has been declared 
done, we are talking about taking 
those same dollars away. 
Offering mixed messaging and failed 
policies that have caused a humani-
tarian and security crisis at the south-
ern border is another issue. When I 
went down to the border about a month 
ago, the Press Secretary said: It is not 
a crisis; it is a situation. Now, a month 
later, the Press Secretary and the ad-
ministration say it is a crisis, but now 
it is a catastrophe. 
I saw a dead body floating in the Rio 
Grande River. Other people died. We 
heard the report of a 9-year-old. That 
doesn’t even count the number of peo-
ple who died along the way. 
It also doesn’t count the 300 or 400 
people 
who 
are 
called 
the 
‘‘got- 
aways’’—not the thousands who are 
coming in and going to the border 
agents but the hundreds every night 
who are crossing. They are bad actors. 
Many of them are gang members or 
they are smuggling drugs or are human 
traffickers, who are evading arrest. It 
is creating a dangerous situation. It is 
a catastrophe. The President hasn’t 
spoken on it. To my knowledge, the 
Vice President has never gone down 
there to get a bird’s eye view. 
The President has embraced the 
Green New Deal policies, like canceling 
the Keystone Pipeline. That one stroke 
of a pen ended thousands of labor union 
jobs, good-paying jobs. But even more 
heartbreaking are the communities 
that would have benefited from all of 
that commerce occurring in some of 
the most rural areas and most eco-
nomically challenged areas in our 
country. 
They rammed through an entirely 
partisan $2 trillion spending package. 
They called it COVID relief. But only 
about 9 percent of it actually had any-
thing to do with continuing to recover 
from the damage that COVID has 
caused this country. 
I am sure the President will talk 
about it tonight, a $2.3 trillion—air 
quotes—infrastructure bill that isn’t 
actually an infrastructure bill. In fact, 
they have been a little bit more intel-
lectually honest. Now they are calling 
it human infrastructure. 
I think most Americans, when you 
think about infrastructure, you think 
about roads, you think about bridges, 
you think about broadband. You don’t 
think about human infrastructure. But 
that is what is being pitched today, 
and it is being pitched on a partisan 
basis, without even attempting to get a 
single Republican vote. 
Americans did not elect President 
Biden to enact any of these partisan 
policies. They trusted him to come in 
and make deals—to settle for some-
thing less than 100 percent but some-
thing that was going to be embraced by 
more of the American people versus 
half, which is about where the Presi-
dent is today. 
And he has pursued this for 100 days. 
I hope he changes his mind, but here is 
one reason why I am not optimistic. 
His most audacious action, in my opin-
ion, is placating the far left and enter-
taining the idea of nuking the Senate 
legislative 
filibuster. 
In 
this 
very 
Chamber, 21 years ago, then-Senator 
Biden declared that defending the fili-
buster 
was 
about 
defending 
com-
promise and moderation. The promises 
he made on the campaign trail, the 
promise he made on the day of his in-
auguration—he noted that his speech 
was one of the most important he 
would ever give as a Senator, defending 
the filibuster. It is a shame that Presi-
dent Biden isn’t demonstrating the 
same political courage that Senator 
Biden did two decades earlier—the kind 
of courage that we are seeing today 
demonstrated by Senator MANCHIN and 
Senator SINEMA. Instead, the President 
has entertained the far left’s push to 
eliminate the filibuster and destroy 
this institution, to end bipartisanship 
and compromise—they really are no 
longer a necessity—so that any piece of 
fringe legislation can pass with a sim-
ple majority. 
The President, a 30-plus year de-
fender of the filibuster, should know 
better than anyone. He knows that the 
left is demanding a Faustian bargain— 
trading 2 years for the far left to have 
free reign in exchange for permanent 
destabilization 
of 
our 
Republic, 
emboldening future demagogues on 
both ends of the spectrum. 
Our country doesn’t need more par-
tisan 
pandering 
or 
political 
brinksmanship from this administra-
tion or from either party. That is why 
I stood against nuking the filibuster 
about 3 years ago, and I will as long as 
I am a U.S. Senator. 
There are plenty of Republicans like 
me who are willing to work with Presi-
dent Biden and even put some of our 
supporters out of their comfort zone 
for the good of this Nation. 
In fact, when I was sworn in, I said I 
would work to find common ground in 
areas where we may agree, and I would 
vigorously oppose policies where we do 
not. Unfortunately, to this point, I 
have only had the opportunity to do 
the latter. 
The willingness to negotiate has only 
been a one-way street on the part of 
Republicans. I went to the White House 
to try to find common ground on an-
other bipartisan COVID package, but it 
is ultimately up to the President 
whether he leads on bipartisanship in-
stincts or follows his advisers who are 
pushing him to keep governing from 
the left. 
Quite frankly, it doesn’t matter what 
the President says about bipartisan-
ship and uniting the country; it is what 
he does. And, tonight, I hope we will 
see it for the good of our great Nation.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
on January 20, President Joe Biden 
gave his inaugural address to the 
American people, saying that in order 
to overcome the challenges we face as 
a nation and ‘‘to restore the soul and 
[to] secure the future of America re-
quires more than words; it requires 
that most elusive of things in a democ-
racy: unity. Unity.’’ 
I end the quote. 
And he says for a second time: 
‘‘Unity.’’ In fact, he mentioned the 
word ‘‘unity’’ nine separate times 
throughout his inaugural remarks. Un-
fortunately, that ‘‘unity’’ President 
Biden preached about is nowhere to be 
found. 
One hundred days in office, and there 
has been zero bipartisanship from the

White House on any major issue. We 
have seen zero effort by the White 
House to take any Republican idea or 
concept seriously. In fact, they have 
done very little to reach across the 
aisle, engage Republicans, or have a se-
rious conversation with us. 
They have shown that they are not 
interested in bipartisanship, as they 
continue to jam through their radical 
agenda and seek power grab after 
power grab. 
We have seen a record number of Ex-
ecutive 
orders, 
the 
first 
partisan 
COVID relief bill, steps to grant DC 
statehood to tip the powers of scale, a 
directive that threatens private prop-
erty rights—the cornerstone of our de-
mocracy—an 
attempt 
to 
federalize 
elections and destroy election integ-
rity with H.R. 1, threats to eliminate 
the filibuster, increased gas prices for 
Americans at the pump, efforts to pack 
the Supreme Court, disguised measures 
to pass the Green New Deal, calls to 
defund police, mandates to allow bio-
logical boys to compete in girls’ sports, 
and tax increases on all Americans, 
and much, much more. 
Things are changing in DC. History 
will record President Biden as having 
spent more money than any other 
President in U.S. history in his first 100 
days. I am warning everyone: Grab 
your wallets. History will record Presi-
dent Biden’s misguided policies as 
making our Nation less safe, having 
created a health crisis, a national secu-
rity crisis, and a humanitarian crisis 
at the southern border. 
What I hope to hear from President 
Biden this evening is not likely to be 
covered in a speech. He is going to try 
to explain to us—even though our econ-
omy is recovering and we just borrowed 
and spent $2 trillion from our grand-
children—why we now need to spend 
another $2 trillion and why he needs to 
raise your taxes to do it. He is going to 
try to describe the legislation he wants 
passed as a so-called infrastructure 
bill, when less than 5 percent of it is 
going toward roads and bridges. 
He is going to try to convince Ameri-
cans of something that is a misnomer 
and not a truth. What he won’t tell you 
is this is a recipe to kill Kansas jobs 
and an economic catastrophe for this 
Nation. 
Last week, President Biden signed 
into law a bipartisan bill I introduced, 
alongside Senators BILL CASSIDY and 
TINA SMITH, to lower prescription drug 
prices for the American people. Addi-
tionally, we unanimously passed a bill 
out of the Ag Committee regarding car-
bon markets. These are both great ex-
amples of the unity the President 
spoke of in his inaugural address— 
Democrats and Republicans coming to-
gether to deliver solutions for the 
American people. 
These are good first steps, and in 
case there is more opportunity for bi-
partisanship, let me tell you where we 
can and should start. We can start with 
an infrastructure package that actu-
ally rebuilds our aging roads, bridges, 
and waterways; invest in future gen-
erations and ensure high-speed internet 
for all Americans and incentivize inno-
vation. We can start with staying the 
course laid out by Operation Warp 
Speed and get more shots in people’s 
arms so we can reach herd immunity 
sooner rather than later. We can start 
with people getting back to work and 
finally 
unleash 
our 
economy 
to 
prepandemic levels, and we can start 
getting all our kids back in school. 
As President Biden said in his inau-
gural address, ‘‘This is our historic mo-
ment of crisis and challenge, and unity 
is the path forward.’’ 
If he truly puts unity above all else, 
we can accomplish great things for the 
American people, for it is unity that 
will see this country come roaring 
back, not President Biden’s radical, 
partisan ways that have further di-
vided this Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1410 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
sadly, the United States is in the midst 
of the deadliest drug epidemic in our 
Nation’s history, caused by some of the 
deadliest drugs ever created. 
It appears that more than 80,000 
Americans died from drug overdose last 
year. By far, the biggest killers were 
lab-made opioids, such as fentanyl, 
which are cheap to produce and easy to 
mix with other street drugs such as 
heroin. These lethal cocktails have 
devastated countless communities and 
families across our Nation. Too many 
parents have come home to a dead 
child who mistakenly took a prescrip-
tion pill or a so-called party drug laced 
with this deadly fentanyl. 
Illicit fentanyl, the kind created in 
underground 
Chinese 
drug 
labs 
or 
smuggled across our porous southern 
border by Mexican cartels, is made 
only to addict and kill. For those dark, 
terrible purposes, fentanyl is unsur-
passed in the tragic history of addic-
tion. It is 50 to 100 times stronger than 
morphine. 
Just 
2 
milligrams 
of 
fentanyl, an amount equivalent to a 
few grains of salt, is enough to kill a 
grown man. 
Just last December, police arrested a 
man in Arkansas carrying 7 pounds of 
fentanyl. Depending on the purity of 
that fentanyl, that would have been 
enough to deliver a fatal dose to up to 
1.5 million Americans. That is far from 
the biggest fentanyl bust that police 
have ever made. 
That means that every time our Bor-
der Patrol stops a drug mule coming 
across our southern border, every time 
the Coast Guard intercepts a drug run-
ners’ vessel in our waters, and every 
time a SWAT team raids a drug deal-
er’s stash house, they could be averting 
what is, in effect, a mass casualty at-
tack on our country. 
Unfortunately, these Mexican drug 
cartels and Chinese superlabs are dia-
bolically creative in waging this new 
kind of opium war against the United 
States. When American law enforce-
ment 
started 
cracking 
down 
on 
fentanyl a few years ago, the cartels 
started producing so-called analogs or 
look-alike drugs that are chemically 
distinct from fentanyl, yet have no le-
gitimate medical uses but will kill you 
just as quickly. Some of these analogs 
are even more powerful than fentanyl— 
up to 150 times more potent of a drug 
that I would remind you, once again, 
is, itself, 50 to 100 times more potent 
than morphine. Because these drugs 
are chemically distinct from fentanyl, 
prosecuting and shutting down their 
creators is often prohibitively expen-
sive, requiring law enforcement to hire 
expert witnesses to testify the analog 
is, in fact, a deadly drug. 
In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration took the necessary and 
prudent step listing the entire class of 
fentanyl analogs as schedule I prohib-
ited substances. This decision closed a 
deadly loophole that drug dealers were 
using to escape punishment from poi-
soning our citizens, while still allowing 
legitimate researchers to apply for and 
obtain 
approval 
to 
research 
these 
analogs for potential medical or sci-
entific breakthroughs. 
The evidence suggests that this law 
enforcement action has been getting 
results. Since the classwide scheduling 
went into effect in early 2018, law en-
forcement 
encounters 
with 
uncon-
trolled fentanyl analogs plummeted by 
almost 90 percent. 
Of course, our work to solve the 
opioid epidemic is far from finished. We 
still have much to do to dismantle the 
cartels and drug trafficking networks 
that spread fentanyl and analogs and 
mix it with other drugs. But the DEA’s 
efforts to control fentanyl analogs 
were a step in the right direction. 
Last year, the Senate voted unani-
mously to extend the DEA’s emergency 
scheduling of fentanyl, but that exten-
sion is now set to expire. We have the 
opportunity—in fact, I would say we 
have the responsibility to permanently 
control these deadly fentanyl analogs 
so law enforcement has the legal 
backup it needs to take these dan-
gerous drugs off the streets. 
If Congress doesn’t act, this emer-
gency scheduling order is set to expire 
next week. The authority of our Border 
Patrol to seize these drugs as they 
cross the border will be dramatically 
reduced. Cartels will, once again, be 
able to exploit loopholes to evade pros-
ecution, and Chinese superlabs will get 
right back to work inventing new and 
creative ways to repackage fentanyl 
and to kill even more Americans. We 
cannot let that happen. 
I introduced a bill to solve this prob-
lem once and for all by merely elimi-
nating the expiration date on the law 
that protects us against these fentanyl 
analogs. I am asking my colleagues to 
approve it just like we did last year— 
unanimously. 
I would also like to urge my Demo-
cratic colleagues to disregard the lib-
eral activist groups that are lobbying

against 
controlling 
these 
deadly 
fentanyl analogs because they hope to 
use it as a bargaining chip to reduce 
criminal penalties for the most serious 
drug traffickers. Think about that. 
More Americans died of a drug over-
dose last year than in any other year in 
our history. Yet these liberal activists 
are trying to help the drug traffickers 
who spread these very poisons. If they 
succeed, drug dealers will have an easi-
er time killing Americans for profit, 
and prosecutors will have to waste val-
uable resources proving that each new 
form of fentanyl they encounter is, in 
fact, a deadly drug. 
We cannot play politics with this 
bill, trading the lives of innocent 
Americans for more lenient treatment 
of cartels and superlabs. Protecting 
Americans from deadly fentanyl should 
not be treated as a bargaining piece or 
poker chip. I ask my colleagues to 
think of the victims and think of the 
urgency of this measure. I am offering 
this bill on behalf of tens of thousands 
of Americans who were with us just 
last year but are not today because of 
these deadly synthetic drugs. I am of-
fering this on behalf of the countless 
Americans who can still be saved if we 
act. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure and, therefore, Madam Presi-
dent, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to immediate consideration of 
S. 1410, introduced earlier today; fur-
ther, I ask unanimous consent that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BOOKER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. I am deeply grateful to 
my colleague and friend, the Senator 
from Arkansas, for bringing this to the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. 
There is an urgency he described that 
I agree with. One hundred Senators 
here, and not one State has not been 
touched, devastatingly, by the fentanyl 
epidemic. These analogs present a cri-
sis to our country. Lives are at stake 
so I share his sense of urgency. 
I am hoping we can work together to 
find a way to stop, as he put it, these 
cartels and these drug labs from wreak-
ing such havoc on our country. I be-
lieve that together we can find a solu-
tion. In fact, there has been construc-
tive talk across the Capitol—bipartisan 
talk about finding a way to come to 
some kind of accord. 
In addition to that, I am hopeful that 
there are other bills out there that 
have the same ambition, the same goal, 
the same sense of urgency that I be-
lieve should be part of the discussion; 
for example, policies like the ones in 
the STOP Fentanyl Act, which I under-
stand Senator MARKEY will be intro-
ducing in the Senate very soon. I be-
lieve we should have time in the Judi-
ciary Committee to work on a longer 
term solution that cannot just deal 
with the international cartels, not just 
deal with these horrific drug labs but 
also empower people who are addicted 
to begin not to be punished simply 
with the criminal justice system but to 
find ways to provide treatment and 
support to people who are struggling 
with addictions to this horrific drug. 
So with that, I would like to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Objection is heard. 
The junior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. I thank my colleague 
from New Jersey for these remarks. 
Time is not on our side. This emer-
gency scheduling order expires next 
week. The Senate is not in session next 
week. 
I know that we want to empower ad-
dicts, as the Senator from New Jersey 
said; that we want to help give them 
the treatment they need to get back on 
their feet. That is a goal I share. 
We are talking, though, about drug 
dealers, drug traffickers, cartels, Chi-
nese superlabs. If we do not pass an ex-
tension—in my bill, a permanent ex-
tension of this emergency scheduling 
order—it is the addicts who will be 
hurt because the drug dealers and these 
cartels and superlabs will simply begin 
to flood our streets, once again, with 
the synthetic fentanyl analogs, which I 
remind you, again, can be 150 times 
more potent than fentanyl itself, which 
is 50 to 100 times more potent than 
morphine. 
I hope my Democratic friends will re-
consider in the short time we have this 
week, and we will be able to pass a per-
manent extension of this scheduling 
order. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
want to say, in conclusion, before I 
switch to another topic, that I appre-
ciate the willingness of the Senator 
from Arkansas to look not just at his 
bill but a powerful potential bipartisan 
extension however we can deal with 
this. The urgency does exist. We are in 
a crisis. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA POWER 
Madam President, I rise today to 
speak in support of Ambassador Pow-
er’s nomination to serve as Adminis-
trator for the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development or USAID. 
The mission of USAID is to advance 
the values of democracy throughout 
the world on behalf of the American 
people, and this mission has never been 
more critical than today. 
If confirmed, Ambassador Power will 
lead an Agency tasked with responding 
not only to the global crisis of COVID– 
19 and its devastating impact on vul-
nerable people across the world but 
with responding to some of the most 
pressing challenges facing the United 
States and the international commu-
nity: global democratic backsliding, 
human suffering caused by sexual- and 
gender-based violence, climate change, 
and violent conflict around the world. 
Now, Ambassador Power is an ex-
traordinary public servant. She has 
distinguished herself in her career and 
is 
more 
than 
capable 
of 
leading 
USAID’s efforts in addressing these 
global urgencies. She is clear-eyed and 
sober about the international chal-
lenges that she and USAID will face. 
Over the past 4 years, experts and ca-
reer professionals within the USAID 
were, unfortunately, silenced. Deci-
sions were politicized, and recruitment 
and retention were inadequate. Ambas-
sador Power will be the kind of leader 
this Agency now needs to restore integ-
rity, transparency, and to rebuild the 
morale among the dedicated profes-
sionals who drive USAID’s critical mis-
sion. 
Ambassador Power also understands 
that the United States will remain a 
global leader—really, must remain a 
global leader—who will be able to 
counter the influence of China’s ag-
gressive diplomatic and development 
agenda. If the USAID is seen, once 
again, by our international partners as 
a competent and trustworthy partner, 
this mission of countering China will 
be stronger. If the USAID is a com-
petent and trustworthy partner, we 
will build on our coalitions to counter 
China’s aggressive actions. 
President Biden could not have nomi-
nated someone more ready or more ca-
pable than Ambassador Power. She has 
had an impressive career from her 
work as a Pulitzer Prize-writing jour-
nalist to spending 8 years in the Obama 
administration on the National Secu-
rity Council, and then as the Ambas-
sador to the United Nations, where she 
championed 
the 
rights 
of 
women, 
atrocity 
prevention, 
and 
LGBTQ 
rights, reaching consensus with other 
countries on vital U.S. interests while 
going toe to toe with our adversaries. 
This is one of our more experienced 
international diplomats from America 
whom we have today, and by elevating 
Ambassador Power to the National Se-
curity Council, President Biden has 
made it clear that development and hu-
manitarian assistance will be an inte-
gral component to meeting our foreign 
policy objectives. It is important that 
we understand that development and 
humanitarian assistance are a critical 
part of our foreign policy. 
Finally, I just want to end with 
something 
that 
Ambassador 
Power 
shared in her most recent book. It is 
something that, I think, speaks so well 
to her humility, to her willingness to 
learn, and to why she will be the leader 
of the USAID—and, I say, of our entire 
Nation—and is what the world needs 
right now. Ambassador Power wrote 
about a meeting she had with the Am-
bassador from the Central African Re-
public, Charles Doubane, who described 
to her the horrific violence taking 
place in his country. 
She wrote that, during that meeting, 
she told him she didn’t have an agenda. 
She just wanted to learn from him

about what was happening in his coun-
try. She then writes that he starts 
speaking and then stops and gets very 
emotional. She assumes he is getting 
emotional about the horrific violence 
in his country, but he says to her, ‘‘No, 
it’s not that, Ambassador. What is hap-
pening in my country is terrible—more 
terrible than anything that has ever 
happened to us before. But I am emo-
tional because you are here. The 
United States of America is the great-
est country in the world, and you, 
America, are here.’’ 
That is the vision of America that 
has defined Ambassador Power’s ca-
reer, that has guided her in the awe-
some responsibility of representing 
this Nation and her values—rooted in 
the ideals of humility, grace, compas-
sion, and thoughtful leadership. 
I have known Ambassador Power 
since she and I were very young. It has 
been decades now of friendship and con-
nection. You can say many things 
about her, but her core is decency and 
honor. She will represent the best of 
us. She is exactly the leader we need 
right now as we navigate the increas-
ing and pressing challenges facing the 
world and our country. 
I am thankful. It would be enough for 
Ambassador Power to retire. It would 
be enough for her to say, ‘‘I have 
served 
my 
country’’ 
and, 
like 
Cincinnatus, will return to her plow, 
but, clearly, her calling has not yet 
fully been answered. She will continue, 
should this body believe it and endorse 
it, to serve this country. She will con-
tinue to honor the United States of 
America. She will continue to be a 
credit to our Nation and the world. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
support her nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
FENTANYL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
am 5 minutes late in coming to the 
Senate floor. I was supposed to be here 
on the fentanyl issue to support Sen-
ator COTTON. I know that an objection 
has been raised, but I want people to 
know how important I think this issue 
is. 
Today, we were considering—hope-
fully, by unanimous consent—passing a 
bill to permanently schedule fentanyl 
substances. 
Proactively 
scheduling 
fentanyl-related substances ought to be 
a big priority because too many Ameri-
cans’ lives have been lost to reject this 
critical measure. 
Some wrongly assert that controlling 
fentanyl analogs is partisan and unnec-
essary. That is simply untrue. Legisla-
tion to schedule fentanyl analogs is a 
bipartisan issue. Just last year, this 
body passed a bipartisan, 15-month ex-
tension bill unanimously. Also, such 
authority is necessary. The CDC esti-
mates 
that 
fentanyl 
analogs 
have 
killed 50,000 Americans in the last 12 
months. We must prevent overdose 
deaths. Prevention is possible when we 
use our laws to force China to stop the 
flow of fentanyl analogs. 
Opponents of permanent scheduling 
assert that the authority is broad and 
could result in too many arrests, but 
since the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration placed fentanyl analogs in 
schedule I, the Justice Department has 
convicted only 80 people under that au-
thority. So too many people being ar-
rested as an argument against their 
permanent extension is hogwash. This 
authority hasn’t resulted in vast and 
wide prosecutions; rather, this author-
ity has been targeted and deliberate, 
and, of course, that is the way it should 
be. 
So if controlling fentanyl analogs is, 
in fact, bipartisan and necessary, why 
isn’t supporting legislation then a no- 
brainer? Perhaps because of heightened 
partisanship, the Democrats can’t vote 
for legislation that helps law enforce-
ment, or maybe they can’t be seen as 
supporting any drug control law even if 
it could save thousands of lives. This 
position goes against the unfortunate 
truth that 50,000 Americans have died 
from these deadly fentanyl analogs. 
Politics has no place above human life. 
As frustrated as I am by this, it is 
not my nature to throw in the towel. I 
will always work hard to find middle 
ground. That is why I am asking every 
Senator to support Senator COTTON’s 
permanent extension or, at a min-
imum, my bill, the Temporary Exten-
sion of Fentanyl Scheduling Act. This 
bipartisan measure extends the author-
ity to schedule fentanyl analogs for 14 
months. It keeps fentanyl analogs in 
schedule I until July 2022, which is long 
enough for the administration to come 
to a permanent scheduling solution and 
allow for a deliberate and transparent 
dialogue with Congress. 
Simply put, we need to give ourselves 
enough time to find a solution to this 
major problem causing 50,000 lives to 
be lost every year. As history shows us, 
lengthy fentanyl scheduling legislation 
is not controversial. I am simply ask-
ing for a similar, bipartisan approach 
now. My bill is the only bipartisan 
temporary extension bill on the table. 
I am grateful for Senators HASSAN 
and SHAHEEN for teaming up with me 
and Senator CORNYN. 
We can’t limit ourselves in the fight 
against fentanyl. It is with this in 
mind that I urge all of my colleagues 
to support either a permanent exten-
sion or my bipartisan bill and to ex-
tend the authority to schedule fentanyl 
analogs for 14 months. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 185 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, Americans are worried about in-
flation. New polling shows that 87 per-
cent of Americans are concerned about 
the rising costs of household items, 
like diapers and gas and groceries. 
That is up from 77 percent just last 
month. They have good reason to feel 
that way. Right now, reports show that 
a third of American households making 
less than $50,000 in annual income are 
buying 
less 
because 
of 
increasing 
prices, and more than one-quarter of 
all households report that rising prices 
on goods are causing them to purchase 
less. 
Just this month, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported that, over the last 
12 months, food prices have gone up, 
and gas prices have risen 23 percent. 
That means, since Biden was elected, 
gas prices have increased about 70 
cents per gallon across the Nation. 
Year over year, consumer prices in-
creased 2.6 percent in March. That is 
up from an annual 1.7 percent increase 
in February. This is all in addition to 
statements from some of America’s 
largest corporations, like Procter & 
Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, which re-
cently announced that they are in-
creasing prices on a number of their 
products. 
That 
includes 
essential 
household goods, like toilet paper and 
diapers. 
The evidence of inflation is right in 
front of us. Just look at these numbers 
that show the percentage change in av-
erage unit prices versus last year: gro-
ceries up 2.6 percent; household goods 
up 5.2 percent; baby care up 7 percent; 
general merchandise up 7.1 percent. 
Wages never go up this fast. So who 
does it hurt? It hurts the poorest and 
those on fixed incomes. 
Businesses are also expecting price 
increases to continue. 
According to data from FactSet, 47 
S&P companies have mentioned infla-
tion on their earnings calls for Q1 2021. 
That is more than during any other 
quarter in the last 10 years. 
On its most recent earnings call, 
Procter & Gamble’s chief financial offi-
cer, Andre Schulten, said: 
The commodity cost challenges we face 
this year will, obviously, be larger next fis-
cal year. 
Who gets hurt the most when infla-
tion rises? Not the rich. It is working 
families, especially those on low and 
fixed incomes. 
I grew up poor and watched my par-
ents struggle to put food on the table. 
I know just how much a slight rise in 
prices can hurt a family, because I saw 
it while I was growing up, and that is 
what is happening right now across our 
Nation. 
We know that those in the Biden ad-
ministration are worried about this. 
They know that rising costs caused by 
their massive spending are bad for 
Americans, but they won’t say it. 
While they are reportedly worrying in 
private about the effects of their spend-
ing plans, they have had a different 
message in public. 
On April 13, the New York Times re-
ported that officials and aides at the 
White House and the Department of 
the Treasury have been holding private 
meetings for months to discuss infla-
tion and have conducted indepth inter-
nal analyses for senior officials and 
President Biden.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2279 
April 28, 2021 
Mr. Biden’s aides are sufficiently worried 
about the risk of that spending fueling infla-
tion that they shaped his infrastructure pro-
posal, which has yet to be taken up by Con-
gress, to funnel out $2.3 trillion over eight 
years, which is slower than traditional stim-
ulus. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this New York Times article, dated 
April 13, 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2021] 
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS QUIETLY 
OBSESSING OVER INFLATION 
(By Jim Tankersley) 
WASHINGTON.—Even before President Biden 
took office, some of his closest aides were fo-
cused on a question that risked derailing his 
economic agenda: Would his plans for a $1.9 
trillion economic rescue package and addi-
tional government spending overheat the 
economy and fuel runaway inflation? 
To find the answer, a close circle of advis-
ers now working at the White House and the 
Treasury Department projected the behav-
iors of shoppers, employers, stock traders 
and others if Mr. Biden’s plans succeeded. Of-
ficials as senior as Janet L. Yellen, the 
Treasury secretary, pored over the analyses 
in video calls and in-person meetings, look-
ing for any hint that Mr. Biden’s plans could 
generate sustained price increases that could 
hamstring family budgets. It never appeared. 
Those efforts convinced Mr. Biden’s team 
that there is little risk of inflation spiraling 
out of the Federal Reserve’s control—an out-
come that Wall Street analysts, a few promi-
nent Republicans and even liberal econo-
mists like Lawrence H. Summers, the former 
Treasury secretary, have said could flow 
from the trillions being pumped into the 
economy. 
Traditional readings of price increases are 
beginning to turn upward as the recovery ac-
celerates. On Tuesday, the Consumer Price 
Index rose 0.6 percent, its fastest monthly in-
crease in more than a decade, while a less 
volatile index excluding food and energy rose 
a more muted 0.3 percent. 
But Mr. Biden’s advisers believe any price 
spike is likely to be temporary and not 
harmful, essentially a one-time event stem-
ming from the unique nature of a pandemic 
recession that ruptured supply chains and 
continues to depress activity in key eco-
nomic sectors like restaurant dining and 
tourism. 
The administration’s view mirrors the pos-
ture of top officials at the Fed, including its 
chairman, Jerome H. Powell, whose mandate 
includes maintaining price stability in the 
economy. Mr. Powell has said that the Fed 
expects any short-term price pops to be tem-
porary, not sustained, and not the type of 
uptick that would prompt the central bank 
to raise interest rates rapidly—or anytime 
soon. 
‘‘What we see is relatively modest in-
creases in inflation,’’ Mr. Powell said in 
March. 
‘‘But 
those 
are 
not 
permanent 
things.’’ 
Armed with their internal data and conclu-
sions, administration officials have begun to 
push back on warnings that a stimulus- 
fueled surge in consumer spending could re-
vive a 1970s-style escalation in wages and 
prices that could cripple the economy in the 
years to come. 
Yet they remain wary of the inflation 
threat and have devised the next wave of Mr. 
Biden’s spending plans, a $2.3 trillion infra-
structure package, to dispense money gradu-
ally enough not to stoke further price in-
creases right away. Administration officials 
also continue to check on real-time meas-
ures of prices across the economy, multiple 
times a day. 
‘‘We think the likeliest outlook over the 
next several months is for inflation to rise 
modestly,’’ two officials at Mr. Biden’s Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein 
and Ernie Tedeschi, wrote on Monda in a 
blog post outlining some of the administra-
tion’s thinking. ‘‘We will, however, carefully 
monitor both actual price changes and infla-
tion expectations for any signs of unexpected 
price pressures that might arise as America 
leaves the pandemic behind and enters the 
next economic expansion.’’ 
Some Republicans call that posture dan-
gerous. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the 
chairman of his party’s campaign arm for 
the 2022 midterm elections, has called on Mr. 
Biden and Mr. Powell to present plans to 
fight inflation now. 
‘‘The president’s refusal to address this 
critical issue has a direct negative effect on 
Floridians and families across our nation, 
and hurts low- and fixed-income Americans 
the most,’’ Mr. Scott said in a news release 
last week. ‘‘It’s time for Biden to wake up 
from his liberal dream and realize that reck-
less spending has consequences, inflation is 
real and America’s debt crisis is growing. In-
flation is rising and Americans deserve an-
swers from Biden now.’’ 
Economic teams in recent administrations 
spent little time worrying about inflation, 
because inflationary pressures have been 
tame for decades. It has fallen short of the 
Fed’s average target of 2 percent for 10 of the 
last 12 years, topping out at 2.5 percent in 
the midst of the longest economic expansion 
in history. 
Shortly before the pandemic recession hit 
the United States in 2020, President Donald 
J. Trump’s economic team wrote that ‘‘price 
inflation remains low and stable’’ even with 
unemployment below 4 percent. As the econ-
omy struggled to climb out from the 2008 fi-
nancial 
crisis 
under 
President 
Barack 
Obama, White House aides feared that prices 
might fall, instead of rise. 
‘‘Given the economic crisis, we worried 
about preventing deflation rather than infla-
tion,’’ said Austan Goolsbee, a chairman of 
the Council of Economic Advisers during Mr. 
Obama’s first term. 
The conversation has changed given the 
large amounts of money that the federal gov-
ernment is channeling into the economy, 
first under Mr. Trump and now under Mr. 
Biden. Since the pandemic took hold, Con-
gress has approved more than $5 trillion in 
spending, including direct checks to individ-
uals. 
Mr. Biden’s aides are sufficiently worried 
about the risk of that spending fueling infla-
tion that they shaped his infrastructure pro-
posal, which has yet to be taken up by Con-
gress, to funnel out $2.3 trillion over the 
course of eight years, which is slower than 
traditional stimulus. 
Even before Mr. Summers and others 
raised economic concerns about Mr. Biden’s 
$1.9 trillion relief bill, officials were wres-
tling with their own worries about its infla-
tion risks. They had internally concluded, 
with direction from Mr. Biden, that the big-
gest risk to the economy was going ‘‘too 
small’’ on the aid package—not spending 
enough to help vulnerable Americans survive 
continued stints of joblessness or lost in-
come. But they wanted to know the risks of 
going ‘‘too big.’’ 
They tested whether an uptick in inflation 
might cause people and financial markets to 
expect rapid price increases in the years to 
come, upending decades of what economists 
call ‘‘well-anchored’’ expectations for prices 
and potentially creating a situation where 
higher expectations led to higher inflation. 
They estimated the odds that the Fed would 
react to such moves by quickly and steeply 
raising interest rates, potentially slamming 
the brakes on growth and causing another 
recession. 
The informal group that initially gathered 
to research those questions included Mr. 
Bernstein, a member of the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers; David Kamin, a deputy di-
rector of the National Economic Council; Mi-
chael Pyle, Vice President Kamala Harris’s 
chief economic adviser; and two Treasury of-
ficials, Nellie Liang and Ben Harris. More 
members have joined over time, including 
Mr. Tedeschi. 
The group reports regularly to Ms. Yellen 
and other senior officials including Brian 
Deese, who heads the N.E.C., and Cecilia 
Rouse, who leads the C.E.A. Its work has in-
formed economic briefings of Mr. Biden and 
Ms. Harris. 
‘‘The president and the vice president, 
their job is to deliver good economic out-
comes for the American people,’’ Mr. Pyle 
said in an interview. ‘‘Part of what deliv-
ering strong economic outcomes to the 
American people means is ensuring that 
their team is fully on top of both the 
tailwinds to the U.S. economy but also the 
risks that are out there. And this is one of 
them.’’ 
Mr. Pyle and his colleagues looked at fi-
nancial market measures of inflation expec-
tations, including one called the five-year, 
five-year forward, which currently shows in-
vestors expecting lower inflation levels over 
the next several years than they expected in 
2018. 
At the same time, officials at the Treas-
ury’s Office of Economic Policy conducted a 
series of modeling exercises to ‘‘stress test’’ 
the virus relief package and how it might 
change those price and expectation measures 
if put in place. They considered scenarios 
where consumers quickly spent their aid 
money, which included $1,400 checks, or 
where they did not spend much of it at all 
right away. They talked with large banks 
about trends in customers’ cash balances and 
how quickly people were returning to the 
work force. Ms. Yellen, a former Fed chair, 
helped adjust the models herself. 
The exercises produced a wide range of pos-
sibilities for inflation. But they never sug-
gested it would rise so rapidly that the Fed 
could not easily handle it by adjusting inter-
est rates or other monetary policy tools. 
They saw no risk of a sharp return to reces-
sion—and no reason to pull back from spend-
ing proposals that administration officials 
believe will help the economy heal faster and 
help historically disadvantaged groups, like 
Black and Hispanic workers, regain jobs and 
income. 
‘‘We’re going to see some heat in this econ-
omy,’’ Mr. Pyle said. ‘‘That heat is going to 
be good and redound to the benefit of wages 
and labor market conditions overall and par-
ticularly for a number of communities that 
have been at the margins of the labor mar-
ket for too long.’’ 
If the data proves that forecast wrong, offi-
cials say privately, they will be quick to 
adapt. But they will not say how. If inflation 
were to accelerate in a sustained and sur-
prising way, some officials suggest, the ad-
ministration would trust the Fed to step in 
to contain it. 
There is no plan, as of yet, for Mr. Biden to 
consider inflation-fighting actions of his 
own. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. The content 
and conclusions of these meetings and 
working groups have not been disclosed 
or been made available to the public.

same issue I have been sounding the

April 28, 2021 
alarm on for months, the Biden admin-
istration continues to mislead the 
American public and ignore the threat 
of inflation. 
Over the last 2 months, I have asked 
the National Economic Council about 
its plans to fight inflation and protect 
American families. 
I have written a Federal Reserve 
member, asked him what can be done 
to help families who are seeing sky-
rocketing gas prices and increasing 
mortgage rates. 
I have called on President Biden and 
Federal Reserve Chair Powell to lay 
out their clear plan to address inflation 
and rising prices that threaten Amer-
ican families. I have yet to get a 
straightforward or acceptable response. 
I have yet to hear them acknowledge 
this very real threat or propose a solu-
tion to protect families. 
So today Senator BRAUN and I are 
making a simple request that the 
Biden administration share with the 
Senate all of its notes, memos, and re-
ports regarding their discussions and 
plans to mitigate and prevent growing 
inflation. 
Inflation is a very real threat to the 
well-being of already struggling fami-
lies, and the last thing American fami-
lies need is to be misled by this admin-
istration. 
Right now, Democrats in Washington 
are living in a fantasyland where debt 
doesn’t matter, spending has no con-
sequences, inflation is impossible. 
But the reality is that inflation does 
have consequences, and it is the duty 
of everyone here, especially the Presi-
dent of the United States, to be open 
and transparent with the American 
people about what is happening with 
inflation. 
There is no reason the Biden admin-
istration should be hiding this informa-
tion. Americans deserve to know the 
consequences of massive government 
spending, and they deserve leadership 
that will show some fiscal responsi-
bility when it comes to their taxpayer 
dollars. 
I look forward to all my colleagues 
supporting 
this 
effort 
to 
increase 
transparency. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 185, submitted earlier 
today. I ask unanimous consent that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The senior Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, no serious 
economists across the ideological spec-
trum are concerned about inflation 
right now. No one is hiding informa-
tion at the White House. 
I am in meetings all the time with 
White House officials talking about 
this package. No one believes—first of 
all, no one is hiding information. No 
one believes what the Senator, the jun-
ior Senator from Florida, is saying 
about this. 
Perhaps some millionaire Senators 
want to make this into an issue, and I 
hear that over and over and over, but I 
talk to people like Jay Powell, Chair of 
the Federal Reserve, nominated by 
President Trump for that position. He, 
of course, keeps his eye on these kinds 
of things, but he has expressed no 
strong concern about inflation. 
And we even know that when some 
experts have been concerned, they have 
been wrong. We saw what happened in 
2008 after too many elites worried 
about inflation. What we really needed 
was to increase wages and get people 
back to work. The result from 2008 was 
a recovery that was too slow for most 
people, while so many of these big 
costs continued to rise. 
Our economy looks a whole lot better 
today than it did last year, but we 
can’t compare where we are today with 
where we were last year. We were on 
the brink of a once-in-a-generation 
health and economic crisis at this time 
last year. Millions of people, mostly 
low-wage workers, lost their jobs. Our 
economy ground to a halt as we tried 
to stop the spread of the virus. 
This 
year, 
we 
have 
made 
good 
progress with the American Rescue 
Plan, as the Presiding Officer from 
Wisconsin knows, getting shots in arms 
and money in pockets and kids back in 
school, people back to work. 
But our recovery is far from over. 
Just moments ago Fed Chair Powell 
said that we are seeing some tem-
porary upticks because things were so 
dire last year, but we still have a long 
way to go. 
The bigger risk to the economy is not 
doing enough to raise workers’ wages 
and to invest in the infrastructure that 
allows our economy to grow. 
We know corporate leaders, we know 
millionaire Senators, we know people 
at the top have done very—in many 
cases, 
have 
done 
very, 
very 
well 
through this, but we know millions of 
workers, many of them hourly work-
ers, have lost jobs. We know millions of 
workers, so-called essential workers— 
one essential worker said to me, works 
in a grocery store: I don’t feel essen-
tial. Frankly, I feel expendable because 
they don’t pay me much; they don’t 
protect me at work. Those are the peo-
ple we should be looking after. 
I want to raise wages. I want to bring 
down costs. That is exactly what the 
jobs plan and the family plan will do— 
bring down healthcare costs, make 
childcare more affordable, create more 
housing people can afford, bring down 
energy bills, make work—getting to 
work cheaper and easier with better 
transit. These are the costs that have 
been rising and eating away at family 
budgets for decades. 
If my colleague from Florida is so 
concerned about the cost of living and 
raising a family, I hope he will join me 
to allow Medicare to negotiate directly 
with drug companies to bring down 
prices for seniors. I hope he will join us 
in investing in childcare to bring down 
the cost of childcare. I hope he will join 
us as we work to create more housing, 
bringing down housing costs. I hope he 
will join us to raise the minimum 
wage. 
My first speech on this floor 14 years 
ago—14 years ago, my first speech on 
this floor was to raise the minimum 
wage, and we did, and it hasn’t been 
raised since. That is what the Senator 
from Florida and the Senator from In-
diana can help us with. 
But we know most of the conserv-
ative elites in this country—most 
won’t say out loud what this inflation 
alarmism is really about. They don’t 
want to invest in the American people. 
They don’t want to do anything to 
make Americans’ hard work pay off. 
They would rather try to scare people: 
Can’t spend this money because there 
might be inflation. 
They don’t want us to do what too 
many have failed to do: put money in 
people’s pockets and raise wages and 
rebuild infrastructure. 
I would ask my colleagues to listen 
to the words of a worker from West 
Virginia, Pamela Garrison. She testi-
fied at our first-ever work listening 
session, our ‘‘Dignity of Work’’ session 
in the Banking and Housing Committee 
yesterday. She said: 
We’re seeing corporations make billions 
every quarter in profit, but then when we 
ask for a minimum wage raise, we’re told 
that ‘‘no that will raise the cost of stuff, oh 
that’ll cost jobs.’’ 
Funny, corporate executives never 
seem to say they will have to raise 
prices when they give themselves bo-
nuses. It is just we will have to raise 
prices if we increase the minimum 
wage. 
This same Ms. Garrison also said: 
You know, they call me part of the 
working poor. The words ‘‘working’’ 
and ‘‘poor’’ shouldn’t be in the same 
sentence, and she is right about that. 
Real expenses for most families have 
gone up for decades, along with cor-
porate profits and the stock market. 
Executive compensation has exploded 
upward, and workers’ wages haven’t 
kept up. 
Executive 
compensation—produc-
tivity is up. Executive compensation is 
up. Profits are up. Workers’ wages are 
flat. That is the problem. That is what 
we should be working on. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, the decision by my colleague to 
block this resolution is clearly dis-
appointing. 
Let’s remember what this was about. 
This was about transparency. They just 
blocked the Senate from requesting 
basic information that is going to help 
all Americans. 
And just look at these numbers 
again. Just in the last 4 months, gro-
cery prices are up 2.6 percent; house-
hold care is up 5.2 percent; baby care is

up 7 percent; general merchandise up 
7.1 percent. We are clearly seeing infla-
tion. 
Senate Democrats just objected to 
transparency. That means they are 
against getting the facts, against en-
suring accountability, and against get-
ting the American people the informa-
tion they need to make smart decisions 
as prices keep rising. 
Eighty-seven percent of Americans 
are worried about the rising costs of 
goods. Apparently, so is the White 
House. So don’t the American people 
deserve the same information about 
what is happening with the economy? 
Floridians deserve to know the truth 
about inflation and so do the people of 
Ohio. Why does my colleague want to 
keep them in the dark? 
This administration is telling the 
American people one thing but saying 
something else behind closed doors. 
That is wrong. 
The American people deserve the 
truth. Inflation is real. It is happening. 
It is hurting American families. It is 
time President Biden does something 
about it, and I am extremely dis-
appointed my colleague is actually 
today helping the President mislead 
the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Madam 
President, 
today we mark Workers Memorial Day, 
when we honor and remember workers 
who have laid down their lives on the 
job. 
I have worn on my lapel since I was 
in the House, a pin depicting a canary 
in a bird cage given to me at a Workers 
Memorial Day rally in Lorain, OH, in 
the late 1990s. 
This pin depicts a canary going down 
in the mine. It suggests the mine work-
er taking a canary down in the mines. 
If the canary died from lack of oxygen 
or from toxic gas, the mine worker got 
out of the mines. He had no union 
strong enough to protect him and no 
government that cared enough to pro-
tect him in those days. 
To me, this pin represents the role of 
government to support the middle class 
and those who aspire to the middle 
class. It represents the progress we 
have made and the society we continue 
to fight for every day here. 
We know the story. Coal miners took 
the canary down into the mines. 
Throughout the 20th century, we have 
worked to change that. We passed 
workers safety laws and overtime pay. 
We banned child labor. We passed clean 
air and safe drinking water laws. We 
enacted Social Security and Medicare 
and workers’ rights and women’s rights 
and civil rights. 
But despite that progress over the 
last year, too many workers have felt a 
whole lot like those miners. They have 
felt like they are on their own. 
A moment ago, I mentioned a gro-
cery store worker in Cincinnati, who 
said: ‘‘They tell me I am essential, but 
I feel expendable.’’ 
That grocery store worker and thou-
sands of others have been on the 
frontlines of this pandemic, risking 
their lives so Americans could keep 
food on their table and get their pack-
ages delivered. They were changing lin-
ens in hospitals and driving buses and 
stocking shelves in supermarkets. 
Then workers go home at night and 
are anxious that they might spread the 
virus and infect their family. 
We know that hundreds of thousands 
of workers have been exposed to the 
virus on the job. Thousands have died. 
It is hard to get an exact count of how 
many because the previous administra-
tion didn’t bother to keep track. 
We know that food and commercial 
workers reported last summer that 
more than 16,000 grocery store workers 
have been exposed, more than 100 have 
died. We know those numbers keep 
going up. 
The National Nurses United has re-
corded at least 3,200 healthcare work-
ers have died. In meatpacking plants, 
the toll has been horrific. 
Last summer, 16,000 workers had been 
infected; the vast majority of them 
Black and Brown workers. More than 
230 died. 
And yet all of last year, the Trump 
administration and too many large cor-
porations failed to protect their work-
ers. The corporate lawyers that ran the 
Labor Department from the top down 
refused to issue workplace safety re-
quirements. 
Corporations ran a lot of feel-good 
TV ads saying thank you to essential 
workers, claiming these workers are 
the heart of their companies, but work-
ers didn’t ask for a PR campaign. They 
needed protections on the job. 
This Workers Memorial Day, today— 
we celebrate it every year—we remem-
ber the American workers who have 
lost their lives on the job from this 
virus, sometimes from gun violence, 
sometimes from workplace accidents. 
We honor them best by fighting to 
protect these workers and their fellow 
workers to make their hard work pay 
off. 
Yesterday, in the Banking and Hous-
ing Committee, we held the commit-
tee’s first-ever listening session. It was 
purely a listening session. No Senators 
got to ask questions. We just came to 
listen, with workers from Ohio and 
around the country, to hear how the fi-
nancial system affects their jobs and 
their lives. 
They shared powerful stories about 
their work, about how companies and 
economic policies prevent their hard 
work from paying off. 
We heard from a distribution worker 
in Ashtabula County, OH. He told us: 
We rarely go a few weeks without an in-
jury, largely because of the insane pace we 
work at. We have suggested that slowing the 
pace even just a little would improve safety 
and could save money, to which we were 
told, ‘‘Injuries don’t cost the company much 
money.’’ 
We heard from a Wells Fargo call 
center worker who talked about how 
the bank misclassified her to avoid 
paying overtime. They put her on sal-
ary. They said she was management. 
They worked her more than 40 hours. 
They never paid her an overtime dol-
lar. 
We heard from a full-time gig worker 
who works for multiple corporations 
like Uber and Instacart. He works full 
time. He has zero benefits because 
these companies claim he is an inde-
pendent contractor. 
We heard from a Michigan worker 
who lost her job when a private equity 
firm bought out her company. They 
laid off 3,100 workers in the Detroit 
area, and they pocketed the money. 
We heard from a worker in West Vir-
ginia who talked about working her 
whole life and never seeing that hard 
work pay off. She said the term ‘‘work-
ing poor’’ should not be two words that 
go together. 
If you work hard, you should be able 
to get ahead in this country. If you 
love this country, you fight for the 
people who make it work. 
If even the global pandemic, where 
America’s workers have been on the 
frontlines—if even that won’t get cor-
porations to rethink their business 
model that treats workers as expend-
able, it is time to stop letting them run 
the economy. That is what the new 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee is all about. Wall Street 
had its chance. They failed. If cor-
porate America won’t deliver for its 
workers, then we have to create a bet-
ter system centered on the dignity of 
work. That means safe workplaces. 
The Biden administration is taking 
steps toward finally issuing an OSHA 
emergency temporary standard. We 
went a whole year in the pandemic 
where the President of the United 
States simply refused and the cor-
porate lawyer who ran the Department 
of Labor simply refused to issue any 
standards on workplace safety. Think 
about that. Now it means laws and 
policies will reward work, like the 
earned income tax credit and the child 
tax credit—the junior Senator from 
New Hampshire is here and has been 
supportive of that; a strong overtime 
rule; ending misclassification that robs 
workers of their wages and their 
rights. It means a strong labor move-
ment. Unions give people power on the 
job. People ought to have the option, if 
they choose, of joining a union, allow-
ing them to join together to make 
their workplace safer. 
It is workers who make our economy 
successful. It is workers who allow cor-
porations and Wall Street investors to 
rake in record profits. It is time for 
that hard work to pay off for all work-
ers, no matter if you punch a clock or 
work for salary or work for tips or take 
care of your parents or take care of

your children. Work should be re-

this country, you fight for the people

rial Day and the other 364 days of the

Madam President, I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA POWER 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to voice my strong support 
for the confirmation of Ambassador 
Samantha Power to be the next Admin-
istrator of the United States Agency 
for International Development. I am 
confident that she brings the talent, 
skill, and experience required of this 
office and is the right person to lead 
this pivotal agency at a critical point 
in America’s return to global leader-
ship. 
Ambassador Power has worn many 
different hats throughout her sterling 
career—advocate, academic, advisor, 
and diplomat. But that trajectory has 
been propelled in large part by her 
time as a journalist, where she saw the 
day-to-day experiences of those living 
in places struggling against the tides of 
war, famine, genocide, and disease. She 
witnessed, first-hand, the tireless ef-
forts of USAID Foreign Service officers 
working in partnership with local 
stakeholders to uplift and empower 
communities around the world. And 
those early experiences seeing the 
work of USAID and the challenges the 
agency faces continue to guide her 
path. 
Like Ambassador Power, I spent the 
early part of my career seeing global 
conflict up close. As a staffer working 
on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee in 1988, I travelled to Iraq after 
Saddam 
Hussein 
used 
poison 
gas 
against the Kurdish people. It’s a trip 
that Ambassador Power recounts in 
her first book, A Problem from Hell, 
which won her the Pulitzer Prize in 
2003—and it’s a trip that animates so 
much of the work I do in the United 
States Senate. 
The world witnessed the horrific 
chemical weapons attacks on the Kurd-
ish people in Halabja in March 1988 and 
later that year, together with my col-
league, Peter Galbraith, I interviewed 
Kurdish survivors of other chemical at-
tacks that followed. It was a heart-
rending journey that stays with me to 
this day. But that experience, like Am-
bassador Power’s experiences in Bos-
nia, East Timor, Darfur, West Africa, 
and elsewhere, instilled in me a sense 
of moral urgency that hasn’t tired in 
the three decades since—and I know 
hasn’t tired in Ambassador Power ei-
ther. 
I’m confident that she’ll employ that 
sense of urgency in her new role as the 
Administrator of USAID, which bol-
sters peace and prosperity both in de-
veloping nations and here at home. The 
biggest threats that we face are inter-
connected and global—from climate 
change to cybersecurity to pandemics. 
As we’ve seen throughout the past 
year, viruses know no borders, and our 
ability to defeat COVID–19 depends 
upon our willingness to partner with 
other nations to stop the spread and 
mount a successful recovery. And as we 
reassert American values at the core of 
our foreign policy, we will also need to 
combat the Chinese government’s ef-
forts 
to 
export 
its 
model 
of 
authoritarianism to governments in 
developing countries. USAID will be at 
forefront of these missions and others. 
In Ambassador Power’s own words, 
‘‘Development is critical to America’s 
ability to tackle the toughest problems 
of our time—economic, humanitarian, 
and geopolitical.’’ 
Madam President, there is no doubt 
in 
my 
mind 
that 
Ambassador 
Samantha Power will serve our coun-
try well as the next Administrator of 
USAID. I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of her confirmation.

S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, Lead-
er CHUCK SCHUMER, Chairman TOM CAR-
PER of the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works, Senator ANGUS 
KING, Senator EDWARD MARKEY and I 
are leading supporters and sponsors of 
S.J. Res. 14, a joint resolution pro-
viding for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United 
States Code, of the rule submitted by 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
relating to Oil and Natural Gas Sector: 
Emission Standards for New, Recon-
structed, and Modified Sources Review, 
85 Fed. Reg. 57,018, Sept. 14, 2020, also 
known as methane rescission rule. We 
submit these comments to provide the 
Senate with addit{onal information re-
garding the intent in adopting this res-
olution. 
The atmospheric buildup of green-
house gases, such as methane, is chang-
ing the climate at a pace and in a way 
that endangers human health, society, 
our economy, and the natural environ-
ment. Specific public health impacts of 
anthropogenic climate change include 
respiratory 
harms 
associated 
with 
smoke inhalation from unprecedented 
climate-driven forest fires, heat stroke, 
and other health effects of increasingly 
frequent heat waves, and more wide-
spread vector borne diseases. Other 
public welfare impacts include dis-
placing U.S. communities by retreating 
snow and ice and rising sea levels, 
droughts that impact agricultural pro-
duction and farming communities, and

S2283 
April 28, 2021 
changes in the frequency and intensity 
of heat waves, precipitation, and ex-
treme weather events that have a dis-
proportionate impact on our Nation 
most vulnerable. 
A key chemical constituent of nat-
ural gas, methane is a leading contrib-
uting cause of climate change. It is 28 
to 36 times more powerful than carbon 
dioxide in raising the Earth’s surface 
temperature when measured over a 100– 
year time scale and about 84 times 
more powerful when measured over a 
20–year timeframe. 
Industrial sources emit greenhouse 
gases in great quantities, and methane 
emissions from all segments of the oil 
and gas industry are especially signifi-
cant in their contribution to overall 
emissions levels and surface tempera-
ture rise. 
It is not possible to address the prob-
lem of rising global atmospheric green-
house gas concentrations tEy achiev-
ing U.S. net greenhouse gas neutrality. 
The United States cannot become 
greenhouse gas neutral without reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions from all 
industrial sources, regardless of the 
relative size of any one emission source 
or the disparate locations of the points 
of emission. 
Within this context, the methane re-
scission rule should be disapproved by 
Congress. The rule finalized regulatory 
actions and introduced legal interpre-
tations that contravene the Clean Air 
Act and congressional intent for EPA 
to take strong action to regulate and 
abate greenhouse gas emissions, such 
as methane, from all sources. 
S.J. Res. 14 renders the methane re-
scission rule’s effect void and dem-
onstrates Congress’s disapproval of the 
new findings of fact and interpreta-
tions of law upon which this rule was 
based. 
By adopting this resolution of dis-
approval, it is our view that Congress 
reaffirms that the Clean Air Act re-
quires EPA to act to protect Ameri-
cans from sources of climate pollution 
like methane, which endangers the 
public’s health and welfare. 
In rejecting the methane rescission 
rule’s misguided legal interpretations, 
the resolution clarifies our intent that 
EPA should regulate methane and 
other pollution emissions from all oil 
and gas sources, including production, 
processing, transmission, and storage 
segments under the authority of sec-
tion 111 of the Clean Air Act. 
In addition, we intend that section 
111 of the Clean Air Act obligates and 
provides EPA with the legal authority 
to regulate existing sources of methane 
emissions in all of these segments. 
In addition, we do not intend that 
section 111 of Clean Air Act requires 
EPA to make a pollutant-specific sig-
nificant contribution finding before 
regulating emissions of a new pollutant 
from a listed source category, although 
EPA could make such a finding if it 
chooses to do so on a case-by-case 
basis. 
Disapproval of the methane rescis-
sion rule does not preclude future regu-
lation under section 111 of the Clean 
Air Act of methane, VOCs or other pol-
lution from the oil and gas industry. 
This resolution nullifies a rule that 
strips away public health and welfare 
protections and deregulates the oil and 
gas industry. Any future rule that im-
poses regulatory requirements on the 
oil and gas industry, provides addi-
tional public health and welfare pro-
tections, or establishes or strengthens 
standards on sources of methane and 
other pollutant emissions would have 
the opposite intent and effect of the 
methane rescission rule and therefore 
cannot be construed as ‘‘substantially 
the same’’ as the methane rescission 
rule. 
In fact, with the congressional adop-
tion of this resolution, we encourage 
EPA to strengthen the standards we re-
instate 
and 
aggressively 
regulate 
methane and other pollution emissions 
from 
new, 
modified, 
and 
existing 
sources throughout the production, 
processing, transmission, and storage 
segments of the oil and gas industry 
under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. 
The welfare of our planet and of our 
communities depend on it. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of the joint res-
olution of disapproval, which would re-
instate critical regulations on methane 
emissions from the oil and gas indus-
try. 
Last summer, the Trump administra-
tion finalized a midnight rule that 
weakened and in some cases altogether 
eliminated requirements that oil and 
natural gas companies limit methane 
and volatile organic compound emis-
sions from their operations. This ac-
tion was taken despite methane’s prov-
en harmful impacts on air quality, 
health, and climate change. 
Methane leaks from oil and gas wells 
are often accompanied by leaks of 
harmful carcinogens like benzene, re-
sulting in health effects for the most 
vulnerable, including children and sen-
iors. My home State of California is 
still dealing with the fallout of the 
Aliso Canyon gas leak—the worst gas 
leak in U.S. history-during which more 
than 100,000 metric tons of methane 
was emitted into the air. Many nearby 
residents reported having headaches, 
bloody noses, nausea, and rashes. 
Methane also has more than 80 times 
the global warming potential of carbon 
dioxide and accounts for 10 percent of 
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Accord-
ing 
to 
one 
study, 
the 
Trump 
aministration action will result in 
methane leaks equivalent to up to 592 
million metric tons of carbon dioxide. 
This will have irreversible effects on 
our climate. 
In California, we are already experi-
encing the destructive effects of cli-
mate change. California has seen rec-
ordbreaking and devastating droughts, 
floods, and wildfires. These disasters 
cannot be separated from global warm-
ing and the emissions of greenhouse 
gasses that cause it. 
I am glad to see Congress taking ac-
tion to reinstate necessary regulations 
on methane emissions, and I look for-
ward to taking additional action, along 
with my conngressional colleagues, to 
combat climate change and ensure 
clean air for all Americans. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
as we approach the 100-day mark of 
this new Congress, the Senate is about 
to take its first major step in fighting 
climate change. In a moment, the Sen-
ate will vote on reinstating common-
sense rules to reduce methane emis-
sions. It will be the first time the Sen-
ate Democratic majority has used the 
Congressional Review Act, and it is no 
mistake that we have chosen to use the 
law first and foremost on the subject of 
climate change. 
Under this Democratic majority, the 
Senate will be a place where we take 
decisive, ambitious, and effective ac-
tion against climate change. Of course, 
reducing methane emissions is not the 
only thing we need to do to fight cli-
mate change, but it is a very signifi-
cant and large first step. 
Methane accounts for roughly a quar-
ter of all the human-caused global 
warming that has transpired since the 
Industrial Revolution. Restoring these 
methane-reducing rules will be one of 
the most significant climate actions 
that the Senate has taken in more 
than a decade. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes and 
commend Senators HEINRICH, KING, and 
MARKEY for their great work on this 
issue. 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

the third time, the question is, Shall

DRINKING 
WATER 
AND 
WASTE-
WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam Prescient, this 
week, the Senate has the opportunity 
to take a major step on an issue that 
affects all Americans: infrastructure. 
Senator DUCKWORTH, my friend and 
fellow Illinois Senator, is leading a bi-
partisan effort to finance critical water 
infrastructure 
improvements 
across 
the country. 
The Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act authorizes $35 bil-
lion in funding to improve access to 
safe drinking water, fortify our water 
infrastructure against extreme weath-
er, lower the cost of utility bills, and 
rebuild aging water systems across 
America. 
More than 40 percent of authorized 
funds will go to small, rural, and dis-
advantaged 
communities, 
many 
of 
which have not seen water infrastruc-
ture improvements in decades. And be-
lieve me, our water infrastructure is in 
desperate need of improvement. 
My home State of Illinois has the 
most lead service lines of any State. 
Recent reports indicate that 8 in 10 Illi-
noisans live in a community where lead 
has been found in the drinking water in 
the last 6 years. Chicago alone has 
more than 380,000 lead service lines, the 
most of any city in the country. My 
hometown of Springfield has more than 
10,000 lead service lines. These numbers 
are tragic and unacceptable. Every 
day, millions of my constituents risk 
exposure to lead, which can impair 
brain development in children and 
harm pregnant mothers. The people of 
Illinois, like many others across the 
country, sorely need these pipes re-
placed. 
Thankfully, 
this 
bipartisan 
bill 
would begin to tackle the epidemic of 
lead in our Nation’s drinking water. It 
would authorize $100 million per year 
for lead service line removal and a fur-
ther $40 million per year for lead test-
ing in schools. Just imagine what that 
kind of funding could do to protect vul-
nerable people and children in Chicago, 
Springfield, and across our country. 
But unfortunately, lead is not the 
only water infrastructure problem fac-
ing our communities. A few weeks ago, 
I visited a small, rural town in Illinois 
called Centreville. Near my birthplace 
of East St. Louis, I have known this 
community all my life. Centreville’s 
population is mostly elderly, Black, 
lifelong residents. They have faced 
chronic wastewater and storm water 
issues for decades. Ordinary rainfall 
can overflow the town’s broken sewer 
systems and flood residents’ basements 
and lawns with raw sewage. No one 
risks taking a sip of water from the 
tap. 
I have heard from residents about the 
horror of stepping out of their front 
door in the morning to discover pools 
of sewage seeping up through the grass 
in their front yards. This is a tragic 
and dangerous situation and one that 
deserves significant Federal attention. 
And yet the problem has persisted for 
decades. Why? 
Centreville is one of the poorest 
towns in Illinois and has struggled to 
attract financial help. The town cannot 
meet the cost-share requirements of 
grant programs or qualify for the loans 
it so desperately needs. 
Well, the residents of Centreville 
have spoken up, they are fed up with 
officials looking the other way. They 
have every right to feel frustrated. 
They have every right to demand more 
of us. For decades our water policy has 
overlooked their needs and left them to 
fend for themselves. This cannot con-
tinue. 
That is why I am glad this bill offers 
towns like Centreville a chance to fix 
their broken pumps, shore up their 
drainage ditches, and begin addressing 
water issues that have been overlooked 
for far too long. The bill would waive 
many of the cost-share requirements 
for small, rural towns like Centreville, 
giving them a path to the funding they 
deserve. It also would give on-the- 
ground technical assistance to dis-
advantaged 
communities 
struggling 
with their water systems, and provide 
grants for repairing broken and out-
dated water infrastructure. 
To help ensure that this expertise 
reaches places like Centreville, I of-
fered an amendment to the bill to focus 
it even further. I want to thank the 
EPW Committee for including my 
amendment to require the EPA to 
prioritize distressed communities like 
Centreville, that have struggled to at-
tract funds and face the cumulative 
burden of wastewater and storm water 
issues. Flooding, lead, drinking water 
access—none of these problems are 
new. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle have spent years decrying the 
state of American infrastructure, and 
our water is no exception. Despite all 
the complaining, we have struggled to 
sit down together and actually address 
these issues. But for the first time in 
many years, we not only have a Presi-
dent willing to pursue bold and nec-
essary infrastructure policy, but a ma-
jority in the Senate willing to work 
with him to get it done. 
While President Biden’s American 
Jobs Plan includes billions more in 
funding to replace the Nation’s lead 
pipes, this bill is a good-faith, down 
payment on the President’s plan, and 
importantly, it has bipartisan support. 
The Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act is the first step to-
wards new, meaningful infrastructure 
policy. 
I hope that my colleagues will join 
me in supporting this bill, so we can 
put a bipartisan down payment on the 
infrastructure every American needs.

TRIBUTE TO TERRY HAMBY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our country recently took a long-over-
due step toward honoring the coura-
geous Americans who served in the 
First World War. Earlier this month 
and more than a century after the for-
mal end of the war, the United States 
raised the flag over the newly con-
structed National World War I Memo-
rial. I am immensely proud of this trib-
ute in our Nation’s Capital to the 4.7 
million Americans who sacrificed to 
preserve our way of life. Today, I would 
like give special thanks to a remark-
able Kentuckian who became a driving 
force bringing this memorial into ex-
istence. My longtime friend Terry 
Hamby, from Cadiz, is the chair of the 
World War I Centennial Commission. 
He deserves our sincere gratitude for 
his leadership and perseverance in giv-
ing every American the opportunity to 
honor our heroes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2285 
April 28, 2021 
Through the generations, the Hamby 
family has proudly answered the Na-
tion’s call to military service. The 
noble tradition dates back to the Civil 
War and Terry’s great-grandfather’s 
service in the Union Army. His grand-
father and father each courageously de-
fended our country in a global war. 
Next, it was Terry’s turn to wear the 
uniform as part of a Naval Air Wing in 
Vietnam. He later joined the U.S. 
Army Reserves until he retired fol-
lowing 26 years of military service. 
Terry’s son continued the family leg-
acy by joining the Navy in the Persian 
Gulf. Service and sacrifice are personal 
to this family. 
Even when Terry retired from the 
military, he continued working to sup-
port the world’s greatest fighting force. 
His hometown in Christian County, 
KY, neighbors Fort Campbell, one of 
our country’s premier military instal-
lations. Terry founded a contracting 
firm to provide services to the Defense 
Department and the men and women 
stationed at the base nearby, including 
the famed ‘‘Screaming Eagles’’ of the 
101st Airborne Division. 
To know Terry is to instantly like 
him. I have had the privilege to call 
him a friend for many years, and I have 
always been impressed by his love of 
our country and respect for the men 
and women who protect it. So when I 
had the chance through my leadership 
position to appoint a member of the 
World War I Centennial Commission, 
Terry was the clear choice. His fam-
ily’s tradition of service, as well as his 
civilian contributions to the military, 
gave him an important perspective for 
this project. I also knew the commis-
sion would benefit from Terry’s busi-
ness mindset as it raised funds to ad-
vance its mission. His colleagues on 
the commission quickly recognized his 
talents too. They elected Terry to 
chair the organization and this monu-
mental effort to honor America’s he-
roes. 
The memorial found a fitting home 
only blocks from the White House in a 
park named for General John J. Per-
shing, the commander of the American 
Expeditionary Forces on the Western 
Front of World War I. After an inter-
national competition with more than 
300 entries, the commission selected a 
design titled ‘‘The Weight of Sac-
rifice.’’ Terry and his wife, Carolyn, re-
cently took Elaine and me on a tour of 
the memorial. One of its most striking 
features is an approximately 60 foot 
long depiction of ‘‘A Soldier’s Jour-
ney.’’ Dozens of overlapping figures tell 
the stories of warriors leaving home for 
the battlefield before their ultimate 
triumph. It is emotional piece that 
shows these soldiers’ toil and sacrifice 
to build a lasting peace. 
Even now that the memorial is offi-
cially open to the public, Terry hasn’t 
stopped working to honor the World 
War I generation. He has turned his at-
tention to gathering support for rec-
ognition of female telephone operators 
called the ‘‘Hello Girls.’’ Other than 
nurses, these were the first women in 
uniform who played a consequential 
role in our country’s wartime effort. 
With Terry working for their cause, I 
am confident these selfless women will 
receive the national attention and 
gratitude they deserve. 
So I encourage my Senate colleagues 
and all Americans to plan a visit to the 
World War I Memorial. It is a striking 
commemoration of our brave men and 
women in uniform, those who sup-
ported them, and the Americans who 
never came home. Terry Hamby has 
earned our praise for his unyielding 
drive to build this tribute. Without 
him, the United States would still be 
waiting for a proper memorial to these 
heroes. Kentucky and our country are 
proud of the mark he has left on our 
Nation’s Capital.

S.J. RES. 14 
Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that a letter 
from attorneys general of New York, 
California, 
Colorado, 
Connecticut, 
Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Mary-
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min-
nesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, Vermont, Washington, and the 
District of Columbia, and the chief 
legal officers of Chicago and Denver on 
the importance of passing this resolu-
tion be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
APRIL 26, 2021. 
Re Senate Joint Resolution 14/House Joint 
Resolution 34—Disapproval of Environ-
mental Protection Agency Rule Rescind-
ing Methane Regulation. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Senate Majority Leader, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL 
Senate Minority Leader,

Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Minority Leader, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR SCHUMER, SENATOR MCCON-
NELL, SPEAKER PELOSI, AND REPRESENTATIVE 
MCCARTHY: The Attorneys General of New 
York, 
California, 
Colorado, 
Connecticut, 
Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wash-
ington, and the District of Columbia, and the 
chief legal officers of Chicago and Denver 
support using the Congressional Review Act 
(CRA) to invalidate a regulation of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) that 
eliminated important limits on air pollution 
from oil and gas facilities, 85 Fed. Reg. 57,018 
(Sept. 14, 2020) (Rescission Rule). Because 
that rule is legally flawed and would signifi-
cantly increase pollution that harms our 
residents and natural resources, using the 
CRA to expeditiously nullify the rule is jus-
tified. Restoring the prior regulation will en-
sure that new oil and gas facilities apply 
common sense, cost-effective measures to 
control emissions of methane and volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), and facilitate 
state efforts to limit pollution from existing 
oil and gas facilities. 
METHANE AND VOCS EMITTED BY OIL AND GAS 
FACILITIES 
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is 
responsible for about a quarter of the global 
warming we are experiencing today. Oil and 
natural gas facilities are the single largest 
industrial source of methane emissions. 
Methane emissions from oil and gas sources 
are harming the States and our residents by 
significantly contributing to climate change. 
Our States are experiencing substantial inju-
ries from climate change, including property 
damage and hazards to human safety associ-
ated with sea level rise and increased sever-
ity of storms and flooding; increased deaths 
and illnesses due to intensified and pro-
longed heat waves; harms to lives and prop-
erty caused by increased frequency and dura-
tion of wildfires; and damage to public 
health—particularly among our children, el-
derly, and those with lung ailments—due to 
local air pollution exacerbated by hotter 
temperatures. These injuries are often most 
severe in low-income communities and com-
munities of color. Scientists have found that 
substantial reductions in global methane 
emissions this decade is critical if we are to 
have a realistic chance of avoiding cata-
strophic effects from climate change. 
Oil and gas facilities are also a substantial 
source of VOCs, a primary component of 
ground-level ozone (smog). Several of our 
States experience persistent and widespread 
unhealthy levels of smog, which EPA has 
found results in numerous harms to public 
health, including triggering asthma attacks 
and even premature death. The States’ smog 
problems are often substantially caused or 
exacerbated by the transport of smog precur-
sors, such as VOCs, from emission sources lo-
cated upwind. More than 9 million people 
live within a half mile of an existing oil or 
gas well, including approximately 600,000 
children under the age of five and 1.4 million 
over 65, groups that are especially sensitive 
to the health risks posed by ozone and other 
local air pollution. 
THE RESCISSION RULE 
The Rescission Rule eliminated methane 
emission standards for new (including modi-
fied and reconstructed) oil and gas facilities1 
that EPA issued four years earlier pursuant 
to section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. See 40 
C.F.R. part 60, subpart OOOOa, 81 Fed. Reg. 
35,824 (June 3, 2016). Through common sense, 
cost-effective approaches such as more effi-
cient technology and leak detection and re-
pair, the 2016 rule secured important reduc-
tions of methane and VOC pollution. EPA 
sensibly required that the emission stand-
ards apply to similar equipment used in the 
production, processing, and transmission and 
storage segments, i.e., up to the point that 
natural gas is delivered for distribution to 
businesses and consumers. In sum, the 2016 
rule helped to prevent and mitigate signifi-
cant harms to public health and the environ-
ment while increasing the efficiency of nat-
ural gas operations. 
Despite these substantial public health, en-
vironmental, and economic benefits, the 
Trump EPA nonetheless promulgated the 
Rescission Rule, which repealed the require-
ments that directly targeted methane emis-
sions at new facilities. The Rescission Rule 
also eliminated pollution abatement require-
ments for methane and VOCs emitted by fa-
cilities engaged in the transmission and stor-
age of natural gas, despite the fact that this 
segment uses some of the same equipment 
(e.g., compressors, pneumatic pumps) as pro-
duction and processing facilities. EPA ac-
knowledged that the Rescission Rule would 
result in increased pollution emissions from 
new facilities, including 448,000 more tons of

methane, 12,000 more tons of VOCs, and 400 
more tons of hazardous air pollutants by 
2030. 85 Fed. Reg. at 57,065. 
EPA also included in the Rescission Rule a 
new hurdle for limiting pollution under sec-
tion 111(b) of the Clean Air Act: to adopt 
emission limits on any additional pollutant 
for sources already regulated under section 
111(b), EPA must make a pollutant-specific 
‘‘significant contribution’’ finding. See 85 
Fed. Reg. at 57,019. This new obstacle con-
travenes EPA’s longstanding position that 
the agency may require emission limits for 
other pollutants from already-listed sources 
provided it demonstrates a rational basis for 
doing so, and creates an unjustified road-
block making it more difficult for EPA to 
carry out its mission to protect public 
health and the environment. The D.C. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals recently vacated a re-
lated EPA rule that sought to implement 
EPA’s new significant contribution finding 
requirement, further undermining this the-
ory. 
As noted above, the Rescission Rule would 
result in significant increases in emissions 
from new oil and gas facilities. These pollu-
tion increases are just part of the story, 
however, because the rule also blocks Clean 
Air Act regulation of existing oil and gas fa-
cilities—facilities that collectively emit sub-
stantial amounts of methane pollution. 
Under the Clean Air Act, there must be pol-
lutant emission standards in effect for new 
facilities under section 111(b) of the Act to 
trigger the requirement under section 111(d) 
of the Act for EPA to promulgate emission 
guidelines that facilitate states’ developing 
plans that limit emissions of the same pol-
lutant from existing facilities. 
EPA is required under its regulations to 
issue existing source emission guidelines 
‘‘upon or after promulgation’’ of standards 
for new facilities, 40 C.F.R. 60.22a(a). Al-
though EPA did not issue the guidelines in 
2016 when it finalized the previous new 
source rule, it began work that year to 
‘‘swiftly’’ develop guidelines to limit meth-
ane emissions from existing sources. That 
work ground to a halt shortly after the 
Trump Administration took office, leading a 
group of our States to sue EPA in on the 
grounds that it had unreasonably delayed 
issuance of the emission guidelines, New 
York v. EPA (D.D.C. No. 18–773). In that liti-
gation, EPA contended that it could not be 
compelled to issue the guidelines because it 
was in the process of eliminating its statu-
tory obligation to regulate methane from ex-
isting sources, a process that culminated in 
the Rescission Rule. 
Significantly, the Rescission Rule was op-
posed by a wide range of stakeholders, from 
independent domestic companies such as 
Jonah Energy and Pioneer Natural Re-
sources to the largest oil and gas companies 
such as BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil. These in-
dustry leaders support the direct regulation 
of methane from oil and natural gas facili-
ties because it is the right thing to do for the 
environment, will lead to consistent regula-
tion across the U.S., and can be cost-effec-
tively achieved. 
THE DISAPPROVAL RESOLUTIONS 
Pursuant to the CRA, enacting the dis-
approval resolutions, once signed by the 
President, results in the subject rule ‘‘being 
treated as though such rule had never taken 
effect.’’ 5 U.S.C. 801(f). Here, by restoring the 
2016 rule’s emission standards for new facili-
ties and paving the way for EPA to facilitate 
state regulation of methane from existing fa-
cilities, passing the disapproval resolutions 
under the CRA would result in substantial 
public health, environmental, and economic 
benefits. According to EPA, the 2016 rule was 
expected to reduce 510,000 tons of methane, 
210,000 tons of VOCs, and 3,900 tons of haz-
ardous air pollutants in 2025 alone. 81 Fed. 
Reg. at 35,827. Between the health benefits of 
the 2016 rule and the increased revenues that 
operators would realize from recovering nat-
ural gas that would otherwise be released, 
EPA determined that the 2016 rule would re-
sult in a net benefit of $170 million in 2025. 
Id. at 35,827–28. 
Enacting the disapproval resolutions would 
also help EPA promptly fulfill its obligation 
to develop emission guidelines that states 
can use to craft plans to limit methane from 
existing sources. Had EPA continued on the 
path it began in 2016, those guidelines would 
have been issued some time ago and states 
would now be implementing them. Although 
Congress cannot turn back the clock, it can 
take action now that gives EPA clear direc-
tion to promptly discharge its overdue statu-
tory duty to limit emissions from these ex-
isting, polluting facilities. 
Finally, passing the disapproval resolu-
tions would not risk invalidating any subse-
quent regulations pursuant to the CRA’s 
‘‘substantially the same’’ language. See 5 
U.S.C. 801(b)(2) (prohibiting a ‘‘new rule that 
is substantially the same as the [dis-
approved] rule’’ unless specifically author-
ized by Congress). The Trump EPA acknowl-
edged that the Rescission Rule is a ‘‘deregu-
latory action.’’ 85 Fed. Reg. at 57,067. As dis-
cussed above, it (1) eliminates direct regula-
tion of methane from new facilities (remov-
ing the predicate for state regulation of ex-
isting facilities pursuant to section 111(d) of 
the Clean Air Act), (2) repeals methane and 
VOC limits on new facilities in the trans-
mission and storage sector, and (3) creates a 
new legal requirement for EPA to regulate 
additional pollutants from already-listed 
source categories under section 111. 
Disapproving the Rescission Rule thus 
would restore the provisions in the 2016 rule 
that directly regulated methane and VOCs 
from sources in the transmission and storage 
sector, and would reinstate EPA’s legal in-
terpretation permitting regulation of addi-
tional 
pollutants 
from 
already-listed 
sources. Accordingly, disapproval of the rule 
would not stand in the way of EPA using its 
statutory authority in the future to promul-
gate more protective standards for new fa-
cilities under section 111(b) of the Clean Air 
Act and more protective emission guidelines 
for existing facilities under its section 111(d). 
Indeed, it would be absurd to contend that a 
CRA resolution disapproving a purely ‘‘de-
regulatory action’’ would bar a protective fu-
ture regulation under the statute’s ‘‘substan-
tially the same’’ language. 
We urge the Senate and the House to 
promptly pass the CRA resolutions dis-
approving the Rescission Rule. Thank you 
for your consideration of this important 
matter.

York; Matthew Rodriquez, Acting Attorney

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DAVID SOULES 
∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, 
David Soules was one of the kindest 
people you could ever meet. His easy 
laugh and infectious enthusiasm was 
always such a welcome presence, espe-
cially on excursions onto his favorite 
southern New Mexico public lands. I 
will always treasure the way David 
could put his ‘‘engineer’s brain’’ to 
work, diving into complex problems 
and looking for solutions, from public 
access and wildlife habitat restoration 
to the siting of transmission lines. He 
was also a real listener, with a rare ap-
petite to always learn something new. 
David always had time to sneak away 
to a quiet corner to compare notes, 
share thoughts, and strategize about 
how to make something better. 
The 
decade-plus-long, 
community- 
driven effort to establish the Organ 
Mountains 
Desert 
Peaks 
National 
Monument was successful because of so 
many different people. But it is truly 
impossible to imagine it happening 
without David Soules. David knew 
every inch of the Organ Mountains- 
Desert Peaks, and his methodical docu-
mentation of historical places, arti-
facts, and unique Chihuahuan desert 
ecosystems was instrumental in quali-
fying the area for monument designa-
tion. The National Monument and the 
10 new Wilderness Areas that are now 
protected forever within it will endure 
as an everlasting gift from David to all 
of us. 
David held a doctorate in mechanical 
engineering and became nationally rec-
ognized expert in the field of imaging 
through turbulence during his career 
spanning over 37 years at White Sands 
Missile Range. During that same time, 
David became a lifelong sportsman and 
champion for wildlife, serving on the 
New Mexico Game and Fish Commis-
sion, 
coauthoring 
the 
‘‘Exploring 
Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Na-
tional Monument’’ guidebook, serving 
as a member and supporter of numer-
ous nongovernmental sportsmen’s and 
conservation organizations, including 
on the boards of New Mexico Wild and 
the White Sands Missile Range Histor-
ical Foundation. 
David Soules was a dear friend and 
an incredible mentor to my boys. I am 
thinking of his wife, Nancy, their two 
sons, Kevin and Keith, their grand-
children, and all those who knew, 
loved, and will forever miss David. 
Whenever I am hunting mule deer or 
javelina in southern New Mexico, I will 
remember David and all he did to pro-
tect the wildlife and wild places that I 
hold dear.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRIAN CUCCIAS 
∑ Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
today I honor a visionary leader whose 
years at the helm of Ingalls Ship-
building have left a profound impact on 
the State of Mississippi and on the na-
tional security posture of the United 
States. I have had the pleasure of asso-
ciating with Mr. Brian Cuccias both 
personally 
and 
professionally 
over 
many years. 
As president of Ingalls Shipbuilding, 
Mr. Cuccias led the largest manufac-
turing employer in Mississippi. Lo-
cated near Brian’s hometown of Biloxi, 
the Pascagoula shipyard sits on 800 
acres of land along the Pascagoula 
River. With 11,500 employees, Ingalls is 
the largest supplier of U.S. Navy sur-
face combatants and has built nearly 70 
percent of the current fleet of Navy 
warships. 
Mr. Cuccias began his career at 
Ingalls in 1979. when he joined Litton 
Data Systems, which was then a major 
division of Litton Industries, then 
owner of what is today Ingalls Ship-
yard. He served as a financial analyst 
for several Navy programs, including 
amphibious assault ships and Spruance 
and Kidd-class destroyers. Since then, 
he has held a number of positions of in-
creasing responsibility, including as-
sistant to the group vice president of 
Avondale industries; sector vice presi-
dent for material for Northrop Grum-
man Ship Systems; program manger 
and vice president for Northrop Grum-
man’s DDG 1000 program; and vice 
president for surface combatants for 
Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. 
Mr. Cuccias left his mark on both the 
shipbuilding industry and Navy surface 
combatant programs. Universally rec-
ognized for his superb leadership, busi-
ness acumen, and commitment to mar-
itime security, his 2014 appointment as 
president of Ingalls Shipbuilding came 
as no surprise to those of us who knew 
him. During his tenure, Ingalls has 
continued to set the standard for ship-
building excellence, delivering five na-
tional security cutters to the Coast 
Guard, along with two America-class 
amphibious assault ships and two San 
Antonio-class 
amphibious 
transport 
docks to the Navy. Additionally, Mr. 
Cuccias oversaw the reactivation of the 
Arleigh Burke-class production line, de-
livering four guided missile destroyers 
to the Navy after a 5-year hiatus. As he 
departs, he leaves the shipyard in per-
haps its strongest position ever, with 13 
ships in various stages of production. 
Mr. Cuccias has left an indelible im-
pact on the Ingalls workforce. He 
spearheaded numerous investments in 
the health and safety of shipyard em-
ployees and their families. In 2015, 
Ingalls dedicated a Family Health Cen-
ter in Gautier, MS a full-service health 
care facility for employees, depend-
ents, and retirees covered by the ship-
yard’s health care plans. As part of a 
$600 million 4-year upgrade to build the 
Shipyard of the Future, he supervised 
the installation of covered, environ-
mentally controlled facilities to pro-
tect workers from the elements—again 
prioritizing the health of the Ingalls 
workforce. 
Always active in his community, Mr. 
Cuccias served on the executive com-
mittee and board of directors for the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast Business Coun-
cil, as well as on the boards of directors 
for the Mississippi Economic Council, 
the Mississippi Partnership for Eco-
nomic 
Development, 
the 
Jackson 
County Economic Development Foun-
dation, and the Salvation Army of Mo-
bile, AL. In 2018, he was honored as one 
of the Top CEOs in Mississippi by the 
Mississippi Business Journal. 
I want to express my deep gratitude 
and appreciation to Brian Cuccias for 
his outstanding leadership in Mis-
sissippi and for his unwavering support 
for the missions of the U.S. Navy. As 
he departs Ingalls for retirement, I 
wish him and his family ‘‘fair winds 
and following seas.’’∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT DE-
LIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION 
OF CONGRESS ON APRIL 28, 2021— 
PM 8 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States which was which was ordered to 
lie on the table: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Madam Speaker. Madam Vice Presi-
dent. No President has ever said those 
words from this podium, and it’s about 
time. The First Lady. The Second Gen-
tleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of 
the United States Congress and the 
Cabinet. My fellow Americans. 
While the setting tonight is familiar, 
this gathering is very different—a re-
minder of the extraordinary times we 
are in. 
Throughout our history, Presidents 
have come to this chamber to speak to 
the Congress, to the Nation, and to the 
world. 
To declare war. To celebrate peace. 
To announce new plans and possibili-
ties. 
Tonight, I come to talk about crisis— 
and opportunity. About rebuilding our 
Nation—and revitalizing our democ-
racy. And winning the future. For 
America. 
As I stand here tonight—just one day 
shy of the 100th day of my Administra-
tion. 100 days since I took the oath of 
office—lifted my hand off our family 
Bible—and inherited a nation in crisis. 
The worst pandemic in a century. The 
worst economic crisis since the Great 
Depression. The worst attack on our 
democracy since the Civil War. 
Now—after just 100 days I can report 
to the Nation: AMERICA IS ON THE 
MOVE AGAIN. 
Turning peril into possibility. Crisis 
into 
opportunity. 
Setback 
into 
strength. Life can knock us down. But 
in America—we never stay down. In 
America—we always get up. 
And today—that’s what we’re doing: 
America is rising anew. 
Choosing hope over fear. Truth over 
lies. Light over darkness. 
After 100 days of rescue and renewal, 
America is ready for takeoff. 
We are working again. Dreaming 
again. Discovering again. Leading the 
world again. 
We have shown each other—and the 
world: There is no quit in America. 
100 days ago, America’s house was on 
fire. We had to act. 
And thanks to the extraordinary 
leadership of Speaker PELOSI and Ma-
jority Leader SCHUMER— 
And with the overwhelming support 
of the American people—Democrats, 
Independents, and Republicans—we did 
act. 
Together—we passed the American 
Rescue Plan. One of the most con-
sequential rescue packages in Amer-
ican history. 
We’re already seeing the results. 
After I promised 100 million COVID– 
19 vaccine shots in 100 days—we will 
have provided over 220 million COVID 
shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling 
every Federal resource. We’ve gotten 
the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies 
and over 700 community health cen-
ters. 
We’re setting up community vaccina-
tion sites and are deploying mobile 
units into hard-to-reach areas. 
Today, 90% of Americans now live 
within 5 miles of a vaccination site. 
Everyone—over the age of 16—every-
one—is now eligible and can get vac-
cinated right away. 
So, get vaccinated now. 
When I was sworn in, less than 1% of 
seniors were fully vaccinated against 
COVID–19. 
100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors 
are fully protected. 
Senior deaths from COVID–19 are 
down 80% since January. Down 80%. 
And, more than half of all adults in 
America have gotten at least one shot. 
At a mass vaccination center in 
Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse 
what it’s like. She looked and said 
every shot feels like a dose of hope. 
A dose of hope for the educator in 
Florida who has a child who suffers 
from an auto-immune disease. She

There’s still more work to do—to

But tonight—I can say because of

progress these past 100 days against 
one of the worst pandemics in history 
is 
one

We kept our commitment and we are

We’ve already sent more than 160

It’s making a difference. 
For many people, it’s making all the 
difference in the world. 
A single mom in Texas wrote to me. 
She said when she couldn’t work—this 
relief check put food on the table and 
saved her and her son from eviction. 
A grandmother in Virginia told me 
she 
immediately 
took 
her 
grand-
daughter to the eye doctor—something 
she put off for months because she 
didn’t have the money. 
One of the defining images of this cri-
sis—has been cars lined up for miles— 
waiting for a box of food to be put in 
the trunk. 
Did you ever think you’d see that in 
America? 
That’s why the American Rescue 
Plan is delivering food and nutrition 
assistance to millions of Americans 
facing hunger—and hunger is down 
sharply already. 
We’re also providing: Rental assist-
ance to keep people from being evicted 
from their homes. 
Providing loans to keep small busi-
nesses open and their employees on the 
job. 
During these 100 days an additional 
800,000 Americans enrolled in the Af-
fordable Care Act because I established 
a special sign up period to do that. 
We’re making one of the largest one- 
time investments EVER in improving 
health care for veterans. 
Critical investments to address the 
opioid crisis. 
And, 
maybe 
most 
importantly— 
thanks to the American Rescue Plan— 
we are on track to cut child poverty in 
America in half this year. 
In the process the economy created 
more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 
days. 
More new jobs in the first 100 days— 
than any President on record. 
The International Monetary Fund is 
now estimating our economy will grow 
at a rate of more than 6% this year. 
That will be the fastest pace of eco-
nomic growth in this country in nearly 
four decades. 
America is moving. Moving forward. 
And we can’t stop now. 
We’re in a competition with China 
and other countries to win the 21st 
Century. 
We have to do more than just build 
back. We have to build back better. 
Throughout our history, public in-
vestments 
and 
infrastructure 
have 
transformed America. 
The transcontinental railroad and 
interstate highways united two oceans 
and brought us into a totally new age 
of progress. 
Universal public school and college 
aid opened wide the doors of oppor-
tunity. 
Scientific breakthroughs took us to 
the Moon and now to Mars, discovered 
vaccines, and gave us the Internet and 
so much more. 
These are the investments we make 
together, as one country, and that only 
government can make. 
Time and again—they propel us into 
the future. 
That’s why I proposed the American 
Jobs Plan—a once-in-a-generation in-
vestment in America itself. The largest 
jobs plan since World War II. 
It creates jobs to upgrade our trans-
portation infrastructure. Jobs modern-
izing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs 
building ports and airports, rail cor-
ridors and transit lines. 
It’s clean water. 
Today—up to 10 million homes—and 
more than 400,000 schools and child 
care centers—have pipes with lead in 
them, including for drinking water. 
A clear and present danger to our 
children’s health. 
The American Jobs Plan creates jobs 
replacing 100% of the Nation’s lead 
pipes and service lines—so every Amer-
ican—so every child—can turn on the 
faucet and be certain to drink clean 
water. 
It creates jobs connecting every 
American with high-speed internet, in-
cluding 35% of rural Americans who 
still don’t have it. 
This will help our kids and businesses 
succeed in a 21st Century economy. 
And I am asking the Vice President to 
help lead this effort. 
It creates jobs by building a modern 
power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to 
storms, hacks, and catastrophic fail-
ures—with tragic results as we saw in 
Texas and elsewhere during winter 
storms. 
The American Jobs Plan will create 
jobs to lay thousands of miles of trans-
mission lines needed to build a resil-
ient and fully clean grid. 
The American Jobs Plan will help 
millions of people get back to their 
jobs and their careers. 
2 million women have dropped out of 
the workforce during this pandemic— 
too often because they couldn’t get the 
care they need for their family, their 
children. 
800,000 families are on a Medicaid 
waiting list right now to get homecare 
for their aging parent or loved one with 
a disability. 
This plan will help these families and 
create jobs for our caregivers with bet-
ter wages and better benefits. 
For too long, we have failed to use 
the most important word when it 
comes to meeting the climate crisis. 
Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about 
climate change, I think jobs. 
The American Jobs Plan will put en-
gineers and construction workers to 
work building more energy efficient 
buildings and homes. 
Electrical workers—installing 500,000 
charging stations along our highways. 
Farmers planting cover crops, so 
they can reduce carbon dioxide in the 
air and get paid for doing it. 
There’s no reason the blades for wind 
turbines—can’t be built in Pittsburgh 
instead of Beijing. No reason why 
American workers can’t lead the world 
in the production of electric vehicles 
and batteries. 
The American Jobs Plan will create 
millions of good paying jobs—jobs 
Americans can raise their families on. 
And all the investments in the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan will be guided by one 
principle: ‘‘Buy American.’’ 
American tax dollars are going to be 
used to buy American products made in 
America that create American jobs. 
The way it should be. 
Now, I know some of you at home are 
wondering whether these jobs are for 
you. You feel left behind and forgotten 
in an economy that’s rapidly changing. 
Let me speak directly to you. 
Independent experts estimate the 
American Jobs Plan will add millions 
of jobs and trillions of dollars in eco-
nomic growth for years to come. These 
are good-paying jobs that can’t be 
outsourced. 
Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs 
created in the American Jobs Plan do 
not require a college degree. 75% do not 
require an associate’s degree. 
The American Jobs Plan is a blue- 
collar blueprint to build America. And, 
it recognizes something I’ve always 
said. Wall Street didn’t build this coun-
try. The middle class built this coun-
try. And unions build the middle class. 
And that’s why I’m calling on Con-
gress to pass the Protecting the Right 
to Organize Act—the PRO Act—and 
send it to my desk to support the right 
to unionize. 
By the way, let’s also pass the $15 
minimum wage. No one should work 40 
hours a week and still live below the 
poverty line. 
And we need to ensure greater equity 
and opportunity for women. Let’s get 
the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk 
for equal pay. It’s long past time. 
Finally, the American Jobs Plan will 
be the biggest increase in non-defense 
research and development on record. 
We 
will 
see 
more 
technological 
change in the next 10 years than we 
saw in the last 50 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2289 
April 28, 2021 
And we’re falling behind in that com-
petition. 
Decades ago, we used to invest 2% of 
our GDP on research and development. 
Today, we spend less than 1%. China 
and other countries are closing in fast. 
We have to develop and dominate the 
products and technologies of the fu-
ture—advanced 
batteries, 
bio-
technology, computer chips, and clean 
energy. The Defense Department has 
an agency called DARPA—the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency— 
that’s there to develop breakthroughs 
to enhance our national security— 
which led to the internet and GPS and 
so much more. 
The National Institutes of Health, 
the NIH, should create a similar Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency—for 
Health. 
To develop breakthroughs to prevent, 
detect, and treat diseases like Alz-
heimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. 
This is personal to so many of us. I 
can think of no more worthy invest-
ment. And I know of nothing that is 
more bipartisan. 
Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s 
within our power. 
Investments in jobs and infrastruc-
ture like the ones we’re talking about 
have often had bipartisan support. 
Vice President HARRIS and I meet 
regularly in the Oval Office with Demo-
crats and Republicans to discuss the 
American Jobs Plan. 
And I applaud a group of Republican 
Senators who just put forward their 
proposal. 
So, let’s get to work. We welcome 
ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t 
waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an 
option. 
We can’t be so busy competing with 
each other that we forget the competi-
tion is with the rest of the world to win 
the 21st Century. 
To win that competition for the fu-
ture, we also need to make a once-in-a- 
generation investment in our fami-
lies—in our children. 
That’s 
why 
I’m 
introducing 
the 
American Families Plan tonight, which 
addresses four of the biggest challenges 
facing American families today. 
First, access to a good education. 
When this Nation made 12 years of 
public education universal in the last 
century, it made us the best-educated 
and best-prepared nation in the world. 
But the world is catching up. They 
are not waiting. 
12 years is no longer enough today to 
compete in the 21st Century. 
That’s why the American Families 
Plan guarantees four additional years 
of public education for every person in 
America—starting as early as we can. 
We add two years of universal high- 
quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- 
year-old in America. 
The research shows that when a 
young child goes to school—not day 
care—they are far more likely to grad-
uate from high school and go on to col-
lege. 
And then we add two years of free 
community college. 
And we will increase Pell Grants and 
investment in Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, 
and Minority-Serving Institutions. 
Jill is a community college professor 
who teaches today as First Lady. She 
has long said any country that out-edu-
cates us is going to outcompete us— 
and she’ll be leading this effort. 
Second, the American Families plan 
will provide access to quality, afford-
able child care. We guarantee that low- 
to middle-income families will pay no 
more than 7% of their income for high- 
quality care for children up to the age 
of 5. The most hard-pressed working 
families won’t have to spend a dime. 
Third, the American Families Plan 
will finally provide up to 12 weeks of 
paid family and medical leave. No one 
should have to choose between a job 
and paycheck or taking care of them-
selves and a loved one—a parent, 
spouse, or child. 
And fourth, the American Families 
Plan puts money directly into the 
pockets of millions of families. In 
March we expanded a tax credit for 
every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 
Child Tax Credit for children over 6 
—and $3,600 for children under 6. With 
two parents, two kids, that’s up to 
$7,200 in your pocket to help take care 
of your family. This will help more 
than 65 million children and help cut 
child poverty in half this year. To-
gether, let’s extend the Child Tax Cred-
it at least through the end of 2025. 
The American Rescue Plan lowered 
health care premiums for 9 million 
Americans who buy their coverage 
under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s 
make that provision permanent so 
their premiums don’t go back up. 
In addition to my Families Plan, I 
will work with Congress to address— 
this year—other critical priorities for 
America’s families. 
The Affordable Care Act has been a 
lifeline for millions of Americans—pro-
tecting people with pre-existing condi-
tions, protecting women’s health. And 
the pandemic has demonstrated how 
badly 
it 
is 
needed. 
Let’s 
lower 
deductibles for working families on the 
Affordable Care Act. 
And let’s lower prescription drug 
costs. We all know how outrageously 
expensive they are. In fact, we pay the 
highest prescription drug prices in the 
world right here in America—nearly 
three times as much as other coun-
tries. We can change that. 
Let’s do what we’ve always talked 
about. Let’s give Medicare the power to 
save hundreds of billions of dollars by 
negotiating lower prices for prescrip-
tion drugs. That won’t just help people 
on Medicare—it will lower prescription 
drug costs for everyone. The money we 
save can go to strengthen the Afford-
able Care Act—expand Medicare cov-
erage and benefits without costing tax-
payers one additional penny. We’ve 
talked about it long enough—Demo-
crats and Republicans. Let’s get it 
done this year. 
This is all about a simple premise: 
Health care should be a right, not a 
privilege in America. 
So how do we pay for my Jobs and 
Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we 
can do it without increasing deficits. 
Let’s start with what I will not do. I 
will not impose any tax increases on 
people making less than $400,000 a year. 
It’s time for corporate America and 
the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay 
their fair share. Just pay their fair 
share. 
A recent study shows that 55 of the 
nation’s biggest corporations paid zero 
in Federal income tax last year. No 
Federal taxes on more than $40 billion 
in profits. A lot of companies evade 
taxes through tax havens from Switzer-
land to Bermuda to the Cayman Is-
lands. And they benefit from tax loop-
holes and deductions that allow for 
offshoring jobs and shifting profits 
overseas. That’s not right. We’re going 
to reform corporate taxes so they pay 
their fair—share and help pay for the 
public investments their businesses 
will benefit from. 
And, we’re going to reward work, not 
wealth. We take the top tax bracket for 
the wealthiest 1% of Americans—those 
making $400,000 or more—back up to 
39.6%. That’s where it was when George 
W. Bush became President. 
We’re going to get rid of the loop-
holes that allow Americans who make 
more than $1 million a year pay a 
lower rate on their capital gains than 
working Americans pay on their work. 
This will only affect three tenths of 1% 
of all Americans. 
And the IRS will crack down on mil-
lionaires and billionaires who cheat on 
their taxes. That’s estimated to be bil-
lions of dollars. 
Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. 
But I will NOT add to the tax burden of 
the middle class of this country. 
They’re already paying enough. What 
I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally re-
sponsible. It raises the revenue to pay 
for the plans I’ve proposed that will 
create millions of jobs and grow the 
economy. 
When you hear someone say that 
they don’t want to raise taxes on the 
wealthiest 1% and on corporate Amer-
ica ask them: whose taxes are you 
going to raise instead, and whose are 
you going to cut? 
Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was 
supposed to pay for itself and generate 
vast economic growth. Instead it added 
$2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge 
windfall for corporate America and 
those at the very top. 
Instead of using the tax savings to 
raise wages and invest in research and 
development, it poured billions of dol-
lars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, 
the pay gap between CEOs and their 
workers is now among the largest in 
history. 
According to one study, CEOs make 
320 times what their average workers 
make. The pandemic has only made 
things worse. 20 million Americans lost 
their jobs in the pandemic—working 
and middle-class Americans. 
At the same time, the roughly 650 
billionaires in America saw their net

worth increase by more than $1 tril-
lion. 
Let me say that again. 
Just 
650 
people 
increased 
their 
wealth by more than $1 trillion during 
this pandemic. 
They are now worth more than $4 
trillion. 
My fellow Americans, trickle-down 
economics has never worked. 
It’s time to grow the economy from 
the bottom up and middle-out. 
A broad consensus of economists— 
left, right, center—agree that what I’m 
proposing will help create millions of 
jobs and generate historic economic 
growth. These are among the highest 
value investments we can make as a 
nation. 
I’ve often said that our greatest 
strength is the power of our example— 
not just the example of our power. 
And in my conversations with world 
leaders—many I’ve known for a long 
time—the comment I hear most often 
is: we see that America is back—but 
for how long? 
My fellow Americans, we have to 
show not just that we are back, but 
that we are here to stay. 
And that we aren’t going it alone— 
we’re going to be leading with our al-
lies. 
No one nation can deal with all the 
crises of our time alone—from ter-
rorism to nuclear proliferation to mass 
migration, 
cybersecurity, 
climate 
change and as we’re experiencing now, 
pandemics. 
There’s no wall high enough to keep 
any virus away. 
As our own vaccine supply grows to 
meet our needs—and we are meeting 
them—we will become an arsenal of 
vaccines for other countries—just as 
America was the arsenal of democracy 
in World War II. 
The climate crisis is not our fight 
alone, either. It’s a global fight. 
The United States accounts for less 
than 15% of carbon emissi ons. 
The rest of the world accounts for 
85%. 
That’s why I kept my commitment 
to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement 
on my first day in office. 
And I kept my commitment to con-
vene a climate summit right here in 
America, with all of the major econo-
mies of the world from——China and 
Russia to India and the European 
Union in my first 100 days. 
I wanted the world to see that there 
is consensus that we are at an inflec-
tion point in history. 
And the consensus is if we act, we 
can save the planet—and we can create 
millions of jobs and economic growth 
and opportunity to raise the standard 
of living for everyone in the world. 
The investments I’ve proposed to-
night also advance a foreign policy 
that benefits the middle class. 
That means making sure every na-
tion plays by the same rules in the 
global economy, including China. 
In my discussion with President Xi, I 
told him that we welcome the competi-
tion and that we are not looking for 
conflict. 
But I made absolutely clear that I 
will defend American interests across 
the board. 
America will stand up to unfair trade 
practices 
that 
undercut 
American 
workers and industries, like subsidies 
for state-owned enterprises and the 
theft of American technologies and in-
tellectual property. 
I also told President Xi that we will 
maintain a strong military presence in 
the Indo-Pacific just as we do with 
NATO in Europe not to start conflict— 
but to prevent conflict. 
And, I told him what I’ve said to 
many 
world 
leaders—that 
America 
won’t back away from our commitment 
to human rights and fundamental free-
doms. 
No responsible American President 
can remain silent when basic human 
rights are violated. 
A President has to represent the es-
sence of our country. 
America is an idea—unique in the 
world. We are all created equal. It’s 
who we are. We cannot walk away from 
that principle. 
With regard to Russia, I made very 
clear to President Putin that while we 
don’t seek escalation, their actions 
have consequences. 
I responded in a direct and propor-
tionate way to Russia’s interference in 
our elections and cyber-attacks on our 
government and businesses—and they 
did both of those things and I did re-
spond. 
But we can also cooperate when it’s 
in our mutual interests. 
As we did when we extended the New 
START Treaty on nuclear arms—and 
as we’re working to do on the climate 
crisis. 
On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear 
programs that present a serious threat 
to America’s security and world secu-
rity—we will be working closely with 
our allies to address the threats posed 
by both of these countries through di-
plomacy and stern deterrence. 
And American leadership means end-
ing the forever war in Afghanistan. 
We have the greatest fighting force 
in the history of the world. 
And I’m the first President in 40 
years who knows what it means to 
have had a child serving in a warzone. 
Today we have service members serv-
ing in the same war as their parents 
once did. 
We have service members in Afghani-
stan who were not yet born on 9/11. War 
in Afghanistan was never meant to be 
a multi-generational undertaking of 
nation-building. We went to Afghani-
stan to get the terrorists who attacked 
us on 9/11. We delivered justice to 
Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the 
terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghani-
stan. 
After 20 years of American valor and 
sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops 
home. 
Even as we do, we will maintain an 
over-the-horizon capability to suppress 
future threats to the homeland. 
But make no mistake—the terrorist 
threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan 
since 2001 and we will remain vigilant 
against threats to the United States, 
wherever they come from. 
Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, 
Syria, Somalia, and other places in Af-
rica and the Middle East and beyond. 
And, we won’t ignore what our own 
intelligence 
agencies 
have 
deter-
mined—the most lethal terrorist threat 
to the homeland today is from white 
supremacist terrorism. 
And my fellow Americans, we must 
come together to heal the soul of this 
Nation. 
It was nearly a year ago before her 
father’s funeral, when I spoke with 
Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young 
daughter. As I knelt down to talk to 
her so we could talk eye-to-eye, she 
said 
to 
me, 
‘‘Daddy 
changed 
the 
world.’’ 
After 
the 
conviction 
of 
George 
Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right 
she was—if we have the courage to act. 
We have all seen the knee of injustice 
on the neck of Black America. 
Now is our opportunity to make real 
progress. 
Most men and women in uniform 
wear their badge and serve their com-
munities honorably. 
I know them. I know they want to 
help meet this moment as well. 
My fellow Americans, we have to 
come together. To rebuild trust be-
tween law enforcement and the people 
they serve. To root out systemic rac-
ism in our criminal justice system. 
And to enact police reform in George 
Floyd’s name that passed the House al-
ready. 
I know the Republicans have their 
own ideas and are engaged in produc-
tive discussions with Democrats. We 
need to work together to find a con-
sensus. Let’s get it done next month, 
by the first anniversary of George 
Floyd’s death. The country supports 
this reform. Congress should act. 
We have a giant opportunity to bend 
to the arc of the moral universe toward 
justice. Real justice. 
And with the plans I outlined to-
night, we have a real chance to root 
out 
systemic 
racism 
that 
plagues 
American life in many other ways. A 
chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs 
and good schools. Affordable housing. 
Clean air and clean water. 
Being able to generate wealth and 
pass it down through generations. Real 
opportunities in the lives of more 
Americans—Black, 
white, 
Latino, 
Asian American, Native American. 
I also want to thank the Senate for 
voting 94–1 to pass the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders from the vicious 
hate crimes we’ve seen this past year— 
and for too long. 
I urge the House to do the same and 
send that legislation to my desk as 
soon as possible. 
I also hope Congress can get to my 
desk the Equality Act to protect the 
rights of LGBTQ Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2291 
April 28, 2021 
To all the transgender Americans 
watching 
at 
home—especially 
the 
young people who are so brave—I want 
you to know that your President has 
your back. 
And another thing. Let’s reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act, 
which has been law in this country for 
27 years since I first wrote it. 
It will close the so-called ‘‘boy-
friend’’ loophole to keep guns out of 
the hands of abusers. It’s estimated 
that more than 50 women are shot and 
killed by an intimate partner—every 
month in America. Pass it and save 
lives. 
And I need not tell anyone this, but 
gun violence is an epidemic in Amer-
ica. 
Our flag at the White House was still 
flying at half-staff for the 8 victims of 
the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 
more lives were taken in a mass shoot-
ing in Colorado. 
In the week between those mass 
shootings, more than 250 other Ameri-
cans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. 
I know how hard it is to make 
progress on this issue. 
In the 1990s, we passed universal 
background checks and a ban on as-
sault weapons and high-capacity maga-
zines that hold 100 rounds that can be 
fired in seconds. 
We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and 
gun violence declined. 
But in the early 2000s, that law ex-
pired and we’ve seen the daily blood-
shed since. 
More than two weeks ago in the Rose 
Garden, surrounded by some of the 
bravest people I know—the survivors 
and families who lost loved ones to gun 
violence—I laid out several steps the 
Department of Justice is taking to end 
this epidemic. 
One of them is banning so-called 
‘‘ghost guns.’’ They are homemade 
guns built from a kit that includes the 
directions on how to finish the firearm. 
The parts have no serial numbers, so 
when they show up at a crime scene, 
they can’t be traced. 
The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t 
required to pass a background check. 
Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist 
could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 
minutes, put together a lethal weapon. 
But not anymore. 
I will do everything in my power to 
protect the American people from this 
epidemic of gun violence. 
But it’s time for Congress to act as 
well. 
We need more Senate Republicans to 
join with the overwhelming majority of 
their Democratic colleagues, and close 
loopholes 
and 
require 
background 
checks to purchase a gun. 
And we need a ban on assault weap-
ons and high-capacity magazines again. 
Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve 
done it before . . . and it worked. 
Talk to most responsible gun owners, 
most hunters—they’ll tell you there’s 
no possible justification for having 100 
rounds—100 bullets—in a weapon. 
They will tell you that there are too 
many people today who are able to buy 
a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. 
These kinds of reasonable reforms 
have the overwhelming support of the 
American people—including many gun 
owners. 
The country supports reform, and the 
Congress should act. 
This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue 
issue. It’s an American issue. 
And here’s what else we can do. 
Immigration has always been essen-
tial to America. Let’s end our exhaust-
ing war over immigration. For more 
than 30 years, politicians have talked 
about immigration reform and done 
nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. 
On day one of my Presidency, I kept 
my commitment and I sent a com-
prehensive immigration bill to Con-
gress. 
If you believe we need a secure bor-
der—pass it. 
If you believe in a pathway to citi-
zenship—pass it. 
If you actually want to solve the 
problem—I have sent you a bill, now 
pass it. 
We also have to get at the root of the 
problem of why people are fleeing to 
our southern border from Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. 
The corruption. The gangs. The polit-
ical instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. 
Earthquakes. 
When I was Vice President, I focused 
on providing the help needed to address 
these root causes of migration. It 
helped keep people in their own coun-
tries instead of being forced to leave. 
Our plan worked. But the last adminis-
tration shut it down. 
I’m restoring the program and asked 
Vice President HARRIS to lead our dip-
lomatic efforts. I have absolute con-
fidence she will get the job done. 
Now, if Congress won’t pass my 
plan—let’s at least pass what we agree 
on. 
Congress needs to pass legislation 
this year to finally secure protection 
for the Dreamers—the young people 
who have only known America as their 
home. 
And, permanent protections for im-
migrants on temporary protected sta-
tus who come from countries beset by 
man-made and natural made violence 
and disaster. 
As well as a pathway to citizenship 
for farmworkers who put food on our 
tables. 
Immigrants have done so much for 
America during the pandemic—as they 
have throughout our history. The coun-
try supports immigration reform. Con-
gress should act. 
And if we are to truly restore the 
soul of America—we need to protect 
the sacred right to vote. 
More people voted in the last Presi-
dential election than ever before in our 
history—in the middle of one of the 
worst pandemics ever. That should be 
celebrated. 
Instead it’s being attacked. Congress 
should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act and send them to 
my desk right away. The country sup-
ports it. Congress should act. 
As we gather here tonight, the im-
ages of a violent mob assaulting this 
Capitol—desecrating our democracy— 
remain vivid in our minds. 
Lives were put at risk. Lives were 
lost. Extraordinary courage was sum-
moned. 
The insurrection was an existential 
crisis—a test of whether our democracy 
could survive. 
It did. 
But the struggle is far from over. The 
question of whether our democracy will 
long endure is both ancient and urgent. 
As old as our Republic. Still vital 
today. Can our democracy deliver on 
its promise that all of us—created 
equal in the image of God—have a 
chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, 
and possibility? 
Can our democracy deliver on the 
most pressing needs of our people? 
Can our democracy overcome the 
lies, anger, hate and fears that have 
pulled us apart? 
America’s adversaries—the autocrats 
of the world—are betting it can’t. 
They believe we are too full of anger 
and division and rage. 
They look at the images of the mob 
that assaulted this Capitol as proof 
that the sun is setting on American de-
mocracy. 
They are wrong. 
And we have to prove them wrong. 
We have to prove democracy still 
works. 
That 
our 
government 
still 
works—and can deliver for the people. 
In our first 100 days together, we 
have acted to restore the people’s faith 
in our democracy to deliver. 
We’re vaccinating the Nation. We’re 
creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
We’re delivering real results people can 
see and feel in their own lives. Opening 
the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing 
fairness and justice. That’s the essence 
of America. That’s democracy in ac-
tion. 
Our Constitution opens with the 
words, ‘‘We the People’’. 
It’s time we remembered that We the 
People are the government. You and I. 
Not some force in a distant capital. 
Not some powerful force we have no 
control over. It’s us. It’s ‘‘We the Peo-
ple.’’ 
In another era when our democracy 
was tested, Franklin Roosevelt re-
minded us—in America: we do our part. 
That’s all I’m asking. That we all do 
our part. 
And if we do, then we will meet the 
central challenge of the age by proving 
that democracy is durable and strong. 
The autocrats will not win the fu-
ture. America will. The future will be-
long to America. 
I stand here tonight before you in a 
new and vital hour in the life of our de-
mocracy and our Nation. 
And I can say with absolute con-
fidence: I have never been more con-
fident or more optimistic about Amer-
ica. 
We have stared into an abyss of in-
surrection and autocracy—of pandemic 
and pain—and ‘‘We the People’’ did not 
flinch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2292 
April 28, 2021 
At the very moment our adversaries 
were certain we would pull apart and 
fail. 
We came together. United. With light 
and hope, we summoned new strength 
and new resolve. To position us to win 
the competition for the 21st Century. 
On our way forward to a Union more 
perfect. More prosperous. More just— 
As one people. One Nation. One Amer-
ica. 
It’s never been a good bet to bet 
against America. And it still isn’t. We 
are the United States of America. 
There is nothing—nothing—beyond 
our capacity—nothing we can’t do—if 
we do it together. 
May God bless you all. 
May God protect our troops.

By Ms. COLLINS: 
S. 1429. A bill to provide compensa-
tion for United States victims of Liby-
an state-sponsored terrorism, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to reintroduce the Justice for 
the Living victims of Lockerbie Act. 
This bill would create a process to seek 
justice for a group Pan American 
World Airways pilots who lost their ca-
reers and pensions following the bomb-
ing 
of 
Pan 
Am 
Flight 
103 
over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, and the subse-
quent bankruptcy and closure of Pan 
Am. 
On December 21, 1988, the State of 
Libya committed an infamous act of 
terror by bombing Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 
innocent civilians. Despite Pan Am’s 
greatly improved financial position in 
1988, the media coverage of the ter-
rorist attack wreaked havoc on Pan 
Am sales leading to its bankruptcy in 
1991. 
In 2008, the U.S. entered into the 
U.S.-Libya Humanitarian Settlement 
Agreement, in which Libya paid $ 1.5 
billion to settle claims by U.S. citizens 
for Libyan-sponsored terrorism. After 
payments by the State Department to 
families 
of 
death 
victims 
from 
Lockerbie and the La Belle Disco 
bombing in Germany, compensation to 
other victims was to be determined by 
the Foreign Claims Settlement Com-
mission. The Commission could only 
consider further claims referred to it 
by the State Department. 
One of these claimants was a group of 
senior Pan Am pilots, most of whom 
were veterans, who were over the age 
of 50 and lost and livelihoods when Pan 
Am went bankrupt and closed. Due to 
the federally required retirement age 
of 60 at that time, and the airline in-
dustry’s seniority system, they were 
unable to get new pilot jobs with other 
airlines. Two of these pilots reside in 
Maine—Ron Fitch of Poland Spring 
and Schafer Bean of Diamond Cove— 
and I have heard their stories and their 
pleas for justice on behalf of their own 
families and the others who suffered as 
a result of Libya’s acts of terrorism. 
Mr. Fitch served nearly ten years in 
the Air Force and flew rescue heli-
copters during the Vietnam War. Mr. 
Bean served in the Navy where he was 
stationed at the former Brunswick 
Naval Air Station during the 1960’s. 
Both of these veterans told me that 
lost their jobs, pensions, health care, 
and savings as a result of the Pan Am 
bombing.

Libya, which had been joined with the 
families 
of 
those

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2296 
April 28, 2021 
Lockerbie, was dismissed by the courts 
due to sovereign immunity. Following 
the 2008 settlement agreement with 
Libya, the group of pilots approached 
the State Department in 2009 seeking 
the necessary referral to have their 
claims heard by the Foreign Claims 
Settlement 
Commission. 
For 
more 
than four years the State Department 
failed to refer the group’s claims to the 
Commission, but following bipartisan 
letters to then-Secretaries Clinton and 
Kerry signed by myself and more than 
60 other members of Congress, the 
State Department finally referred the 
claims in 2013. 
After an initial denial of claims in a 
preliminary ruling by the Commission 
in July 2016, the group of pilots was 
granted a hearing in December 2016. So 
many of the pilots and their families 
attended the hearing that it was moved 
to a U.S. District Court courtroom in 
Washington, D.C. Three senior Pan Am 
executives testified at the hearing, in-
cluding the former Pan Am CEO, 
Thomas Plaskett; former Pan Am Sen-
ior Vice President for Finance, Ramesh 
Punwani; and former Pan Am Vice 
President of Strategic Planning, Peter 
Pappas. 
Each 
explained 
why 
the 
Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent 
media coverage directly caused the air-
line’s collapse. 
In January 2018, more than a year 
following that hearing, the Commis-
sion ruled against the pilots. Using an 
undefined standard of proof and apply-
ing international law, the Commission 
argued that Pan Am’s demise was not 
caused by the Lockerbie bombing, con-
trary to the testimony of the former 
Pan Am executives themselves. The pi-
lots’ referred claim was the very last of 
the Libya claims adjudicated by the 
Commission, and the Libya settlement 
fund is now exhausted from the claims 
it approved prior to the final adjudica-
tion of the pilots’ claims. 
Mr. President, these terrorism vic-
tims were denied an opportunity to 
even make their case for four years by 
the Department of State, and when fi-
nally referred to the Foreign Claims 
Settlement Commission, they were 
forced to wait another three years for a 
preliminary ruling and another two 
years for a final decision, by which 
point the Commission had already 
awarded claims that essentially ex-
hausted the settlement funds provided 
by Libya. That simply is not fair, and 
I believe these Mainers and other 
Americans deserve a quick and fair 
process to compensate them for their 
losses. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
working toward justice for all of the 
victims of the Lockerbie bombing per-
petrated by Libya. 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and 
Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 1432. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Energy to establish an elec-
tric grid resilience grant program and 
an electric grid resilience research and 
development program; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to join Senator CORNYN in introducing 
the ‘‘Preventing Outages With En-
hanced Resilience and Operations Na-
tionwide (POWER ON) Act of 2021’’. 
This legislation would authorize the 
Federal government to offer grants to 
States and Tribal governments to mod-
ernize the electrical grid and better 
withstand extreme weather events and 
natural disasters. 
It would also serve as a catalyst for 
our Nation’s research and development 
and deployment of new technologies 
that will ensure our Nation’s grid can 
meet the challenges of climate change 
and continue to provide reliable elec-
tricity to our citizens. 
The ‘‘POWER ON Act’’ is a bipartisan 
step-forward to combating the dev-
astating impact of climate change and 
keep the lights on for everyone. 
This legislation would help protect 
America’s electric grid and make it 
more resilient. 
Climate change is real and nowhere 
is that fact more clear than in my 
State of California. As the State con-
tinues to experience historic wildfires, 
droughts, dangerous mudslides, pro-
longed heatwaves, and extreme wind 
events that prompt sustained power 
shutoffs, the Federal government can 
and must help. We must work with 
States to invest in our electrical infra-
structure and make our grids more re-
liable. 
This legislation would establish a 
grant program through the Depart-
ment of Energy for States and Tribal 
governments to award funds to eligible 
entities to deploy projects that en-
hance the resilience of the electric 
grid. 
This legislation specifically includes 
natural disasters, such as wildfires, and 
extreme weather such as heatwaves, 
drought, and high winds as threats to 
the resiliency of the electrical grid. 
Additionally, 
it 
explicitly 
includes 
Public Safety Power Shutoffs, which 
have become all too routine in Cali-
fornia in recent years, as eligible 
events. 
To protect ratepayers, this legisla-
tion ensures that a utility may not 
seek any cost recovery for any grant 
awarded through this new program. 
Lastly, this legislation would estab-
lish a grant program through the De-
partment of Energy for research, devel-
opment, demonstration, and commer-
cial application of innovations to en-
hance resilience and strengthen emer-
gency response and management of the 
electric grid. 
California has always been a leader 
in research and development, and this 
new program would allow universities, 
national laboratories and others to 
make our grid smarter and more resil-
ient. This legislation will not only 
work to harden our grid but it will 
allow our world-renowned institutions 
to usher in new technologies that will 
keep our grid and our citizens safe. 
I thank my colleague Senator COR-
NYN and our House partners, Represent-
atives DORIS MATSUI, JARED HUFFMAN, 
DOUG LAMALFA, EDDIE BERNICE JOHN-
SON, KEVIN BRADY, and MICHAEL BUR-
GESS for championing this bill. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass the ‘‘POWER ON 
Act’’ as quickly as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

(2) represented countries that had severed 
diplomatic relations with Hungary because 
of its German alliance; 
Whereas Carl Lutz, upon arrival in Buda-
pest, began to work to help Jews receive 
Swiss diplomatic protection so they could 
flee Nazi persecution; 
Whereas, in 1944, Carl Lutz received per-
mission to issue protective papers to save 
8,000 Jews from deportation, which Lutz de-
termined to mean 8,000 families, not 8,000 in-
dividuals; 
Whereas Carl Lutz extended Swiss protec-
tion to 76 buildings that operated as safe 
houses for Jewish refugees seeking protec-
tion, including a department store called the 
Glass House, which served as a refuge for up 
to 3,000 Jews and as a headquarters for the 
Zionist underground; 
Whereas, in November 1944, Carl Lutz and 
his wife, Trudi Lutz, joined a death march to 
various concentration camps, pulling Jews 
out of the line to issue as many protective 
papers as possible; 
Whereas, at the end of World War II, Carl 
Lutz and his coconspirators, including his 
wife, his staff, and the Zionist underground 
members, saved over 50,000 Jews, which was 
half of the surviving Jewish population of 
Budapest; and 
Whereas the United States is deeply in-
debted to Carl Lutz, who was responsible for 
the largest civilian rescue mission of Jews 
during World War II: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life and legacy of Carl Lutz; 
(2) recognizes that the heroic effort of Carl 
Lutz went above and beyond the call of duty 
to save the Hungarian Jews ‘‘condemned to 
die’’ because he believed it to be a ‘‘matter of 
conscience’’; and 
(3) expresses deep appreciation to Carl Lutz 
on behalf of the United States for facili-
tating the largest civilian rescue mission of 
Jews during World War II, saving over 50,000 
Jews through the protective papers and doc-
umentation he issued.

NIZING 
THE 
LATE 
GILBERT 
METZ, 
THE 
LAST 
HOLOCAUST 
SURVIVOR WHO LIVED IN MIS-
SISSIPPI, AND COMMENDING ALL 
EDUCATORS WHO TEACH ABOUT 
THE HOLOCAUST AND ALL GENO-
CIDE 
Mr. WICKER submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 182 
Whereas April 7, 2021, marked the inter-
national observance of Yom Hashoah, also 
known as ‘‘Holocaust Memorial Day’’, a day 
to remember and mourn the millions who 
died during the Holocaust of World War II; 
Whereas Gilbert Metz, born in France and 
inmate 184203 in Auschwitz and Dachau, was 
liberated from Dachau on April 29, 1945, and 
moved to Natchez, Mississippi; 
Whereas the Mississippi Legislature passed 
House Concurrent Resolution 104 titled ‘‘A 
Concurrent Resolution Commending Gilbert 
Metz As Mississippi’s Only Holocaust Sur-
vivor’’ on April 4, 1998, which recognized Gil-
bert Metz as Mississippi’s only Holocaust 
survivor; 
Whereas Gilbert Metz, the last Holocaust 
survivor in Mississippi, passed away on De-
cember 17, 2007, and is survived by his 3 chil-
dren, Sylvain Metz, Helene Johnson and her 
husband, Mark, and Lawson Metz and his 
wife, Kay, 5 grandchildren, 3 step-grand-
children, and 4 great- and step-great-grand-
children; 
Whereas awareness of the Holocaust is de-
clining, as more than 1 in 5 Millennials and 
Generation Z individuals in the United 
States are unaware of the Holocaust or are 
not sure if they have heard of the Holocaust; 
and 
Whereas educators throughout the United 
States and the world have committed to 
teaching about the Holocaust and all geno-
cide to ensure that these atrocities are never 
forgotten, even as those who endured these 
dark chapters in human history are no 
longer with us: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and honors the late Gilbert 
Metz as the last survivor of the Holocaust in 
Mississippi; 
(2) recognizes the declining awareness and 
knowledge of the atrocities committed dur-
ing the Holocaust; and 
(3) commends all educators in the United 
States and the world who teach about the 
Holocaust and all genocide.

IRAN’S STATE-SPONSORED PER-
SECUTION OF ITS BAHA’I MINOR-
ITY AND ITS CONTINUED VIOLA-
TION 
OF 
THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
COVENANTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. DURBIN, and Mr. BOOZMAN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 183 
Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 
1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 
2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020, Congress de-
clared that it— 
(1) deplored the religious persecution by 
the Government of Iran of the Baha’i com-
munity; and 
(2) would hold the Government of Iran re-
sponsible for upholding the rights of all Ira-
nian nationals, including members of the 
Baha’i Faith; 
Whereas according to the United States 
Commission on International Religious Free-
dom’s 2017 annual report, ‘‘Since 1979, [Ira-
nian] authorities have killed or executed 
more than 200 Baha’i leaders, and more than 
10,000 [Baha’i] have been dismissed from gov-
ernment and university jobs [in Iran]’’; 
Whereas the United Nations General As-
sembly Resolution on the Situation of 
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
(A/RES/75/191), dated December 16, 2020, ex-
presses serious concern about— 
(1) ‘‘ongoing severe limitations and in-
creasing restrictions on the right to freedom 
of thought, conscience, religion or belief’’; 
(2) ‘‘restrictions on the establishment of 
places of worship’’; 
(3) ‘‘undue restrictions on burials carried 
out in accordance with religious tenets’’; 
(4) ‘‘attacks against places of worship and 
burial’’; and 
(5) ‘‘other human rights violations, includ-
ing but not limited to harassment, intimida-
tion, persecution, arbitrary arrests and de-
tention, and incitement to hatred that leads 
to violence against persons belonging to rec-
ognized and unrecognized religious minori-
ties’’; 
Whereas on January 29, 2020, the United 
States Commission on International Reli-
gious Freedom ‘‘condemned an Iranian court 
order allowing authorities to confiscate 
properties owned by Baha’is in the village of 
Ivel in Mazandaran Province’’; 
Whereas the Iran section of the Depart-
ment of State’s 2019 Report on International 
Religious Freedom states that— 
(1) ‘‘The government bars Baha’is from all 
government employment and forbids Baha’i 
participation in the governmental social 
pension system. Baha’is may not receive 
compensation for injury or crimes com-
mitted against them and may not inherit 
property. A religious fatwa from the supreme 
leader encourages citizens to avoid all deal-
ings with Baha’is.’’; 
(2) ‘‘Baha’is and those who advocated for 
their rights reported Baha’is continued to be 
major targets of social stigma and violence, 
and perpetrators reportedly continued to act 
with impunity. Even when arrested, per-
petrators faced diminished punishment fol-
lowing admissions that their acts were based 
on the religious identity of the victim.’’; 
(3) ‘‘There continued to be reports of non- 
Baha’is dismissing or refusing employment 
to Baha’is, sometimes in response to govern-
ment pressure, according to [the Baha’i 
International Community] and other organi-
zations monitoring the situation of the Ba-
ha’is.’’; and 
(4) ‘‘According to media and NGO reports, 
Baha’is continued to face charges that in-
cluded ‘insulting religious sanctities,’ ‘cor-
ruption on earth,’ ‘propaganda against the 
system,’ ‘espionage and collaboration with 
foreign entities,’ and ‘actions against na-
tional security.’ Charges also included in-
volvement with the Baha’i Institute for 
Higher Education (BIHE), a university-level 
educational institution offering mainly dis-
tance learning, that the government consid-
ered illegal.’’; 
Whereas on March 11, 2020, the Department 
of State released the 2019 Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices, which states 
that Iranian authorities ‘‘barred Bahai stu-
dents from higher education’’; 
Whereas the Baha’i International Commu-
nity documented a more than 50 percent in-
crease in hate propaganda directed against 
the Baha’is in the 12-month period ending in 
August 2020 compared to prior years with 
more than 9,500 such articles, videos, or web 
pages appearing in Iranian government-con-
trolled or government-sponsored media; 
Whereas the Government of Iran is a party 
to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, done at New York Decem-
ber 19, 1966, and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
done at New York December 16, 1966, and is 
in violation of its obligations under such 
covenants; 
Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive 
Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divest-
ment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) authorizes 
the President to impose sanctions on individ-
uals who are ‘‘responsible for or complicit in, 
or responsible for ordering, controlling, or 
otherwise directing, the commission of seri-
ous human rights abuses against citizens of 
Iran or their family members on or after 
June 12, 2009’’; and 
Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and 
Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public Law 
112–158) amends and expands the authorities 
established under the Comprehensive Iran 
Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment 
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–195) to sanction 
Iranian human rights abusers: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the Government of Iran’s 
state-sponsored persecution of its Baha’i mi-
nority and its continued violation of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical Rights and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
(2) calls on the Government of Iran — 
(A) to immediately release the imprisoned 
or detained Baha’is and all other prisoners 
held solely on account of their religion; 
(B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of 
hate propaganda against the Baha’is; and 
(C) to reverse state-imposed policies deny-
ing equal opportunities to higher education, 
earning a livelihood, due process under the 
law, and the free exercise of religious prac-
tices; 
(3) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State, in cooperation with responsible na-
tions— 
(A) to immediately condemn the Govern-
ment of Iran’s continued violation of human 
rights; and 
(B) to demand the immediate release of 
prisoners held solely on account of their reli-
gion; and 
(4) urges the President and the Secretary 
of State to utilize available authorities to 
impose sanctions on officials of the Govern-
ment of Iran and other individuals directly 
responsible for serious human rights abuses, 
including abuses against the Iranian Baha’i 
community.

‘‘TARDIVE DYSKINESIA AWARE-
NESS WEEK’’ 
Mr. MURPHY (for himself and Mr. 
CASSIDY) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 184 
Whereas many people with serious, chronic 
mental illness, such as schizophrenia and 
other schizoaffective disorders, bipolar dis-
order, or severe depression, require treat-
ment 
with 
medications 
that 
work 
as 
dopamine receptor blocking agents (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘DRBAs’’), including 
antipsychotics; 
Whereas many people who have gastro-
intestinal disorders, including gastroparesis, 
nausea, and vomiting also require treatment 
with DRBAs;

April 28, 2021 
Whereas, while ongoing treatment with 
DRBAs can be lifesaving, for some people it 
can also lead to Tardive Dyskinesia; 
Whereas Tardive Dyskinesia is a move-
ment disorder that is characterized by ran-
dom, involuntary, and uncontrolled move-
ments of different muscles in the face, trunk, 
and extremities; 
Whereas, 
in 
some 
cases, 
Tardive 
Dyskinesia may— 
(1) cause people to experience movement of 
the arms, legs, fingers, and toes; 
(2) affect the tongue, lips, and jaw; and 
(3) cause swaying movements of the trunk 
or hips and may impact the muscles associ-
ated with walking, speech, eating, and 
breathing; 
Whereas Tardive Dyskinesia can develop 
months, years, or decades after a person 
starts taking DRBAs and even after they 
have discontinued use of those medications; 
Whereas not everyone who takes a DRBA 
develops Tardive Dyskinesia, but if Tardive 
Dyskinesia develops it is often persistent; 
Whereas common risk factors for Tardive 
Dyskinesia include advanced age and alco-
holism or other substance use disorders; 
Whereas postmenopausal women and peo-
ple with a mood disorder are also at higher 
risk of developing Tardive Dyskinesia; 
Whereas a person is at higher risk for 
Tardive Dyskinesia after taking DRBAs for 3 
months, but the longer the person is on these 
medications, the higher the risk of devel-
oping Tardive Dyskinesia; 
Whereas studies suggest that the overall 
risk of developing Tardive Dyskinesia after 
taking DRBAs is between 10 and 30 percent; 
Whereas it is estimated that over 500,000 
people in the United States suffer from 
Tardive Dyskinesia; 
Whereas, according to the National Alli-
ance for Mental Illness, 1 in every 4 patients 
receiving 
long-term 
treatment 
with 
an 
antipsychotic medication will experience 
Tardive Dyskinesia; 
Whereas years of difficult and challenging 
research have resulted in recent scientific 
breakthroughs, with 2 new treatments for 
Tardive Dyskinesia approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration of the Department 
of Health and Human Services; 
Whereas Tardive Dyskinesia is often unrec-
ognized and patients suffering from the ill-
ness are commonly misdiagnosed; 
Whereas regular screening for Tardive 
Dyskinesia in patients taking DRBA medica-
tions is recommended by the American Psy-
chiatric Association; 
Whereas patients suffering from Tardive 
Dyskinesia often suffer embarrassment due 
to abnormal and involuntary movements, 
which leads them to withdraw from society 
and increasingly isolate themselves as the 
disease progresses; 
Whereas 
caregivers 
of 
patients 
with 
Tardive Dyskinesia face many challenges 
and are often responsible for the overall care 
of the Tardive Dyskinesia patient; 
Whereas the Senate can raise awareness of 
Tardive Dyskinesia in the public and med-
ical community: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of May 2, 2021 
through May 8, 2021, as ‘‘Tardive Dyskinesia 
Awareness Week’’; and 
(2) encourages each individual in the 
United States to become better informed 
about and aware of Tardive Dyskinesia.

IN 
THE

OF

PRESIDENT RELATING TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION’S DISCUSSIONS 
AND PLANS TO ASSESS, MITI-
GATE, AND PREVENT GROWING 
INFLATION 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. BRAUN, and Mr. LEE) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs: 
S. RES. 185 
Whereas the Federal debt and rising infla-
tion is a real crisis that hurts real Ameri-
cans; 
Whereas the national debt of the United 
States is $27,900,000,000,000; 
Whereas this represents $223,441 in debt per 
taxpayer; 
Whereas in March President Biden and 
Democrats in Congress pushed through a 
wasteful $1,900,000,000,000 ‘‘COVID’’ spending 
bill that will further increase the Federal 
debt to $30,000,000,000,000; 
Whereas the Biden Administration and 
Democrats in Congress continue to push 
massive spending proposals that would con-
tribute to inflation, which increases the cost 
of everyday goods and disproportionately af-
fects low-income and fixed-income families; 
Whereas the cost of everyday purchases, 
like diapers and groceries, are increasing 
while home prices and rents continue to rise; 
Whereas food and gasoline prices have 
risen significantly over the past year, up 3.5 
percent and 23 percent, respectively, in 
March 2021, according to the Consumer Price 
Index; 
Whereas the latest figures from the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics show the Consumer Price 
Index and Producer Price Index increasing 
2.6 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, over 
the year, the fastest increases in nearly a 
decade; 
Whereas several notable economists have 
expressed concern about the impact of the 
Biden 
Administration’s 
massive 
Federal 
spending, with warnings that a stimulus- 
fueled surge in consumer spending could re-
vive a 1970s-style escalation in wages and 
prices that could cripple the economy in the 
years to come; 
Whereas the New York Times reported on 
April 13, 2021, that officials and aides at the 
White House and the Department of the 
Treasury have for months held private meet-
ings to discuss inflation and conducted in- 
depth internal analyses for senior officials 
and President Biden; 
Whereas the content and conclusions of 
these secret meetings and working groups 
have not been disclosed and made available 
to the public; 
Whereas the New York Times also reports 
that ‘‘Mr. Biden’s aides are sufficiently wor-
ried about the risk of spending fueling infla-
tion that they shaped his infrastructure pro-
posal, which has yet to be taken up by Con-
gress, to funnel out $2.3 trillion over eight 
years, which is slower than traditional stim-
ulus.’’; 
Whereas the Biden Administration con-
tinues to refuse to address or acknowledge 
the effects of rising inflation on American 
families, despite indications that inflation 
could significantly increase this year; and 
Whereas the partisan actions of the Biden 
Administration have real life consequences 
for Americans: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the President is requested 
to transmit to the Senate not later than 14 
days after the date of the adoption of this 
resolution documents in the possession of 
the President relating to the Administra-
tion’s discussions and plans to mitigate and 
prevent growing inflation, including a de-
tailed timeline of events and participants as 
well as any correspondence, reports, presen-
tations, notes, or memorandum produced in 
preparation for, during, or as a result of 
these activities.

Mr. ROMNEY (for himself and Mr. 
MURPHY) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 186 
Whereas Nazi Germany invaded France on 
May 10, 1940, and after brief but intense hos-
tilities, secured the surrender of France on 
June 22, 1940; 
Whereas, as a consequence of the Nazi con-
quest, the lives of French Jews and Jewish 
and non-Jewish persons of other nationali-
ties seeking refuge in France were put in 
grave and imminent danger; 
Whereas many thousands of those persons 
fled to Bordeaux, France, and elsewhere in 
southwest France, seeking to traverse Spain 
and escape to Portugal; 
Whereas, in 1939, the Government of Por-
tugal under Antonio de Oliveira Salazar 
issued Circular 14, which sharply restricted 
the availability of visas to displaced persons; 
Whereas the Consul General of Portugal in 
Bordeaux was Dr. Aristides de Sousa Mendes 
do Amaral e Abranches; 
Whereas, in June 1940, confronting a hu-
manitarian crisis and in defiance of Circular 
14, Sousa Mendes, assisted principally by his 
diplomatic 
colleagues 
Jose 
de 
Seabra, 
Manuel de Vieira Braga, and Emile Gissot, 
issued without charge tens of thousands of 
visas, including thousands to fleeing Jews; 
Whereas Sousa Mendes reportedly stated, 
‘‘I declare that I shall give, free of charge, a 
visa to whosoever shall request it. My desire 
is to be with God against Man rather than 
with Man and against God.’’; 
Whereas those visas, as well as Sousa 
Mendes’ personal intervention at the border 
between France and Spain, enabled the refu-
gees to reach safety in Portugal; 
Whereas, in July 1940, the Government of 
Portugal under Oliveira Salazar responded 
by recalling Sousa Mendes, dismissing Sousa 
Mendes later from active diplomatic service, 
and subjecting him to economic retribution 
and subsequent ostracism; 
Whereas, in 1941, Sousa Mendes explained, 
‘‘In truth, I disobeyed, but my disobedience 
does not dishonor me. I chose to defy an 
order that to me represented the persecution 
of true castaways who sought with all their 
strength to be saved from Hitler’s wrath. 
Above the order, for me, was God’s law, and 
that’s the one I have always sought to ad-
here to without hesitation. The true lesson 
of Christianity is to love one’s neighbor.’’; 
Whereas, in 1954, Sousa Mendes died penni-
less in Lisbon, Portugal, under the cloud of 
the discipline imposed for his defiance; 
Whereas, in 1966, Yad Vashem recognized 
Sousa Mendes as a Righteous Among the Na-
tions for his selfless efforts to save Jewish

lives at personal risk to himself, making 
Sousa Mendes the first of a number of diplo-
matic rescuers to be so honored; 
Whereas, in 1988, the United States Senate 
passed Senate Resolution 270, 100th Congress, 
agreed to June 23, 1988, to commemorate 
Sousa Mendes’ humanitarian efforts; 
Whereas, in 1986, President of Portugal 
Mario Soares posthumously rehabilitated 
Sousa Mendes, decorating Sousa Mendes as 
an Officer of the Order of Liberty; 
Whereas, in 1988, the Parliament of Por-
tugal posthumously granted Sousa Mendes 
the status of Ambassador; 
Whereas, in 1995, President of Portugal 
Mario Soares posthumously bestowed on 
Sousa Mendes the Grand Cross of the Order 
of Christ; 
Whereas, in 2017, President of Portugal 
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa posthumously be-
stowed on Sousa Mendes Portugal’s highest 
honor, the Grand Cross of the Order of Lib-
erty; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Parliament of Por-
tugal unanimously voted to memorialize 
Sousa Mendes in the National Pantheon in 
Lisbon; and 
Whereas, in 2020, on the 80th anniversary of 
his heroism, the United States Commission 
for the Preservation of America’s Heritage 
Abroad initiated commemorations in honor 
of Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux, France, and 
Portugal: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors and salutes the humanitarian 
and principled work of Dr. Aristides de Sousa 
Mendes do Amaral e Abranches, Consul of 
Portugal in Bordeaux, France, for acting 
with great courage and at personal risk to 
issue transit visas to French Jews and other 
persons, sparing them from Nazi occupation 
and the Holocaust, thus saving many thou-
sands of innocent lives; and

S. RES. 188 
Whereas COVID–19 has infected more than 
28,000,000 people in the United States and 
taken the lives of more than 500,000; 
Whereas, on May 15, 2020, President Trump 
unveiled Operation Warp Speed, the nation-
wide effort to accelerate development of an 
effective COVID–19 vaccine; 
Whereas Operation Warp Speed success-
fully ‘‘deliver[ed] by the end of [2020] a vac-
cine at scale to treat the American people’’; 
Whereas Operation Warp Speed, to date, 
has supported the authorization of 3 COVID– 
19 vaccines in 9 months, rather than years; 
Whereas the Department of Defense and 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices partnered together to support the devel-
opment, manufacturing, delivery, and ad-
ministration of such COVID–19 vaccines; 
Whereas the Director of the National Insti-
tutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, praised 
the Trump Administration for the unprece-
dented success of Operation Warp Speed in-
cluding that multiple safe and effective 
COVID–19 vaccines ‘‘got done in 11 months 
from when we first knew about this virus 
[which] is at least 5 years faster than it’s 
ever been before’’; 
Whereas, on October 16, 2020, the Trump 
Administration and Operation Warp Speed 
announced a public-private partnership to le-
verage the expertise of certain private sector 
entities to distribute and administer COVID– 
19 vaccines to nursing homes and long-term 
care facilities as quickly as possible, pro-
tecting the most at-risk populations in the 
United States; 
Whereas, on December 8, 2020, President 
Trump 
signed 
an 
Executive 
Order 
prioritizing access for the people of the 
United States to the COVID–19 vaccines pur-
chased by the United States Government; 
Whereas, on December 11, 2020, the Food 
and Drug Administration authorized the 
first vaccine for emergency use to prevent 
COVID–19; 
Whereas, on December 14, 2020, an inten-
sive care unit nurse in New York City be-
came the first person to receive the COVID– 
19 vaccine in the United States; 
Whereas Operation Warp Speed helped to 
support development, manufacturing, and 
distribution of vaccines, including procuring 
an initial 400,000,000 doses of COVID–19 vac-
cines, contract options that the Biden Ad-
ministration is reportedly levergaing to pur-
chase additional doses; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, by the time 
President Trump left office, more than 
21,000,000 doses of a COVID–19 vaccine had 
been administered in the United States; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, on January 20, 
2021, the last day in office for President 
Trump, 1,511,443 doses of a COVID–19 vaccine 
were administered, setting the United States 
on pace to meet the initial goal of the Biden 
Administration to administer 100,000,000 vac-
cines within the first 100 days of the Biden 
presidency; and 
Whereas the rapid development and de-
ployment of COVID–19 vaccines has helped 
the United States combat the spread of 
COVID–19, protect at-risk populations in the 
United States, and begin the process of re-
opening the schools, offices, and public 
spaces of the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the accomplishments of the 
Trump Administration and Operation Warp

DEAR
CONGRESSIONAL
LEADERS: As our 
States’ chief executives, we urge Congress to 
pass legislation allowing states with legal-
ized medical or adult-use cannabis to operate 
safely under the national banking system. 
We strongly support the passage of the Se-
cure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking 
Act of 2021 (H.R. 1996/S. 910) or similar legis-
lation that would remove the legal uncer-
tainty and allow banks and credit unions to 
provide services to state-licensed cannabis- 
related businesses. 
We were pleased that the House passed 
similar legislation in the 116th Congress 
(H.R. 1595). The SAFE Banking Act of 2021 al-
ready has more than 165 bipartisan House co-
sponsors and more than 30 bipartisan Senate 
cosponsors. The legislation has also received 
support from more than 30 associations. 
Currently, 36 U.S. states, four U.S. terri-
tories, and the District of Columbia have le-
galized the medical use of cannabis. Addi-
tionally, 18 states, two territories, and the 
District of Columbia have legalized rec-
reational use by adults over 21 years of age. 
Despite legalization of cannabis at the state- 
level, our financial institutions face enor-
mous legal risks and criminal and civil li-
ability under the Controlled Substances Act. 
These barriers disincentive financial institu-
tions from providing banking services to 
state-licensed and regulated cannabis busi-
nesses. 
Because few banks and credit unions pro-
vide these services, state-licensed cannabis 
businesses predominantly operate on a cash 
basis. Without banking services, state-li-
censed cannabis businesses are unable to 
write checks, make and receive electronic 
payments, utilize a payroll provider, or ac-
cept credit and debit cards. Cash only busi-
nesses pose a significant public safety risk to 
customers and employees. The cash-only en-
vironment also burdens state and local gov-
ernment agencies that must collect tax and 
fee payments in person and in cash, which 
creates additional public expenses and em-
ployee safety risks. 
State and federal governments have a 
shared interest in upholding the rule of law, 
protecting public safety, and transitioning 
markets out of the shadows and into our 
transparent and regulated banking system. 
Many of our states have implemented laws 
and regulations to reduce these risks while 
ensuring financial accountability of the can-
nabis industry. These public safety risks can 
be further mitigated on the federal level by 
passing the SAFE Banking Act to provide 
state-licensed cannabis businesses with ac-
cess to banking service providers. 
We urge you to pass the SAFE Banking 
Act of 2021 or similar legislation that would 
provide a safe harbor for depository institu-
tions that provide a financial product or 
service to a state-licensed cannabis business 
in states that have legalized cannabis. We 
look forward to working with you as legisla-
tion progresses to address this urgent public 
policy and safety concern.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the undersigned 
state 
bankers 
associations, 
representing 
banks of all sizes; we write to express our 
support for H.R. 1996, the Secure and Fair 
Enforcement Banking Act (SAFE Banking 
Act) of 2021. This strongly bipartisan legisla-
tion scheduled for consideration on this 
week’s suspension calendar would be an im-
portant step to address the conflict between 
federal and state laws and how banks safely 
work with legal cannabis and cannabis re-
lated businesses. 
Although we do not take a position on the 
legalization of marijuana, our members are 
committed to serving the financial needs of 
their communities—including those that 
have voted to legalize cannabis. Currently, 36 
states covering 70 percent of the nation’s 
population have legalized cannabis for med-
ical or adult-use. Despite this ever-growing 
voter preference, current federal law con-
tinues to prevent banks from safely banking 
these businesses without fear of federal sanc-
tions. As a result, this segment of our local 
economies is forced to operate on an all-cash 
basis, which creates serious public safety, 
revenue administration, and legal compli-
ance concerns in the communities we serve. 
The impact on our local economies could 
also prove significant, as revenue paid to un-
related industries that provide products and 
services to state-authorized cannabis busi-
nesses such as law firms, accountants and 
contractors is technically money derived 
from illegal activities, and thus could be 
considered money laundering. This raises the 
significant question of whether financial in-
stitutions can bank these ancillary busi-
nesses, as such actions could likewise be con-
sidered violations of the money laundering 
laws. Without a change to federal law, that 
entire portion of economic activity in legal 
cannabis states may be marginalized from 
the banking system. 
The SAFE Banking Act is a banking-spe-
cific bipartisan solution that would address 
the reality of the current marketplace and 
allow banks to serve cannabis-related busi-
nesses in states where the activity is legal. 
We urge members of the House of Rep-
resentatives to support H.R. 1996, the SAFE 
Banking Act, when this bill comes before the 
House on this week’s suspension calendar.

US CANNABIS COUNCIL, 
Washington, DC, April 19, 2021. 
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE STIVERS, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. WARREN DAVIDSON, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, 
VELAZQUEZ, STIVERS AND DAVIDSON: On 
behalf of the United States Cannabis 
Council (USCG), I write to you to sup-
port the swift passage of H.R. 1996, also 
known as the SAFE Banking Act. 
The SAFE Banking Act addresses a 
crucial problem within the emerging 
cannabis industry: access to regulated 
financial services. As states continue 
to legalize cannabis, opening new eco-
nomic opportunities for business own-
ers, one problem continues to persist— 
Black Americans and other racial mi-
norities are precluded from the state- 
legal industry due to a lack of financ-
ing and barriers to entry. 
By protecting banking institutions 
that extend financial services to the 
cannabis industry, existing operators 
and minority-owned businesses seeking 
access into the industry benefit from 
access to institutional capital. Indeed, 
today’s situation is reminiscent of a 
previous era in which minorities were 
routinely redlined out of access to 
banking credit, capital, and cash. The 
SAFE Banking Act would alleviate the 
problem of minority equity and access 
with the cannabis industry in crucial 
ways. Further, it protects the 321,000 
employees directly affected by the can-
nabis industry’s lack of access and 
whose retirement, insurance, and bank-
ing accesses are constantly in peril. 
It is imperative that the SAFE Bank-
ing Act is passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives. In doing so, the House 
would take a meaningful first step in 
establishing a more equitable cannabis 
industry within the US, ensuring mi-
norities that were most affected by the 
War on Drugs are properly represented. 
The US Cannabis Council voices its 
support for H.R. 1996 and commends the 
bill authors and Speaker PELOSI for 
your and her attention to this impor-
tant issue. 
Sincerely, 
STEVEN W. HAWKINS, 
Interim President & CEO, 
U.S. Cannabis Council.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I include

2021. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
ACTION PARTNERSHIP, 
Medford, MA, March 17, 2021. 
RE SAFE Banking Act—Position: Support. 
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Member of Congress 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE STIVERS, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. WARREN DAVIDSON, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, STIVERS, AND
DAVIDSON: 
Thank you for the opportunity to once 
again participate in this historic dis-
cussion of the SAFE Banking Act. 
LEAP’s previous executive director, 
Major Neill Franklin (Ret.), was hon-
ored to have testified in the sub-
committee hearing in 2019 and we 
would like to affirm our ongoing sup-
port of this important bill. 
I spent 21 years in law enforcement, 
and upon leaving, I continued to serve 
the public. My mission has always 
been, and will always be, to promote 
safety and justice. As the executive di-
rector of the Law Enforcement Action 
Partnership (LEAP), a nonpartisan, 
nonprofit of police prosecutors, judges 
and 
other 
criminal 
justice 
profes-
sionals, I’ve helped ensure our mission 
is to mobilize the voice of law enforce-
ment in support of policies that will 
make us all safer. 
At a time when more than a dozen 
states have voted to regulate and con-
trol marijuana, and dozens more have 
implemented 
programs 
for 
medical 
marijuana, it is beyond time for the 
federal 
government 
to 
update 
the 
banking system to support these demo-
cratic choices. 
When my predecessor testified in 
2019, he told the story of a dispensary 
owner from Orange County, California, 
who was kidnapped, tortured, perma-
nently mutilated, and left for dead. By 
the grace of God, he survived this des-
picable act of violence, but the condi-
tions under which marijuana industry 
workers risk similar victimization per-
sist. 
The conditions persist because one of 
the fastest growing markets in the 
country has nowhere to legally put its 
money. When thieves know a business 
is operating in cash, it becomes a fairly 
simple matter to target the owners and 
employees. Suddenly, something as 
mundane as making a tax payment be-
comes a potentially lethal situation. 
This lack of regulatory framework is 
precisely why voters have made the 
drug legal in some parts of the coun-
try. 
Underground 
markets 
enrich 
criminals at the expense of everyone’s 
safety. We cannot simply acknowledge 
marijuana is now legal in some states 
or look the other way while it happens; 
we have to build a model for how to 
keep people safe while voters decide to 
move the industry above-ground. 
Police agencies can access financial 
records more easily when the trans-
actions are documented in secure bank-
ing records. Banks can assist with in-
vestigations by flagging suspicious ac-
tivity and alerting authorities to busi-
nesses that may be involved in orga-
nized crime. Financial records are used 
to locate people, estimate the size of an 
organization, and build cases against 
hardened criminals. A well-known ex-
ample is Al Capone, who, after a life-
time of notoriety, was finally arrested 
for tax-evasion. When marijuana busi-
nesses have to work with cash, banks 
have limited ability to flag suspicious 
activity—and 
otherwise 
legal 
busi-
nesses are more likely to be overrun by 
cartels in the absence of a paper trail. 
I’m not one for fear mongering—what 
I testify to is rooted in experience and 
research. Any police officer who has 
worked 
the 
street 
or 
investigated 
enough robberies will testify to the 
same regarding any business forced to 
handle large amounts of cash. 
The SAFE Banking Act presents us 
with an opportunity to help stabilize 
the marijuana industry and enhance 
public safety. I believe it is my respon-
sibility as a lifelong public servant to 
stay involved in this legislation to the 
very end. 
Thank you for your time and for 
bringing the SAFE Banking Act to a 
vote. 
Respectfully, 
LIEUTENANT DIANE 
GOLDSTEIN (Ret.), 
Executive Director, 
Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP). 
MOUNTAIN WEST 
CREDIT UNION ASSOCIATION, 
Denver, CO, March 18, 2021. 
Congressman ED PERLMUTTER. 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PERLMUTTER: I write 
to you today in support of the Secure and 
Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act of 
2021. This legislation provides important pro-
tections for our credit unions that wish to 
provide financial services to legal entities in 
their states. 
As financial services providers serving 
nearly 4 million members in Arizona, Colo-
rado and Wyoming, credit unions play a cen-
tral role in our communities by fulfilling 
banking needs that may not be otherwise 
available. Currently, however, we cannot 
serve an industry that generates several bil-
lion dollars in sales and tax revenues—the 
recreational cannabis industry—without sub-
stantial risk due to ongoing uncertainty 
over federal enforcement of the Controlled 
Substances Act. This has become not only a 
states’ rights issue, but an important public 
safety issue. Without access to standard 
banking services, some of these companies 
have had to come up with alternative solu-
tions. Many are unable to undertake the 
most basic functions of successful busi-
nesses, such as paying vendors, employees, 
and taxes, but instead have large amounts of 
money unsecured, unaccountable and at risk 
for abuse. 
The SAFE Banking Act would provide the 
safe harbor we need as financial services pro-
viders to service this growing industry and 
protect our members and the taxpayers of 
our states. This is a matter independent of 
the question of legalization of cannabis and 
is about ensuring that legal businesses have 
the basic financial services they need for 
compliance and accountability.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
FEDERALLY-INSURED CREDIT 
UNIONS, 
Arlington, VA, April 19, 2021. 
Re H.R. 1996, the SAFE Banking Act of 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: I write to you today on behalf of the Na-
tional Association of Federally-Insured Cred-
it Unions (NAFCU) in conjunction with the 
House’s scheduled vote on H.R. 1996, the 
SAFE Banking Act of 2021, to urge the House 
to support this legislation. NAFCU advo-
cates for all federally-insured not-for-profit 
credit unions that, in turn, serve over 124 
million consumers with personal and small 
business financial service products. 
As you are aware, the vast majority of 
states have authorized varying degrees of 
marijuana use, ranging from limited medical 
use to decriminalization and recreational 
use at the state-level. NAFCU has heard 
from a number of our member credit unions 
in these states that they are being ap-
proached by their members, or potential 
members, that have a small business in or 
are serving the legal cannabis industry in 
their state and are seeking banking services 
for their small business. 
As the cultivation, sale, distribution, and 
possession of marijuana remains illegal at 
the federal level under Schedule I of the Con-
trolled Substances Act, the majority of cred-
it unions remain hesitant to provide finan-
cial services to these members and their 
small businesses. While the 2013 memo from 
U.S. Deputy Attorney General James M. 
Cole (‘‘Cole Memo’’) and the 2014 guidance 
from FinCEN have attempted to provide 
clarity to financial institutions, uncertainty 
remains for financial institutions in this 
area. Guidance can be rescinded at any time 
and in fact, former Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions took action in 2018 to essentially re-
scind the ‘‘Cole Memo.’’ For financial insti-
tutions, such as credit unions, there are ad-
ditional regulatory challenges that com-
pound the uncertainty of providing financial 
services to state-authorized marijuana-re-
lated businesses (MRBs). These go beyond 
just concerns about criminal or civil pen-
alties, but also extend to requirements re-
lated to proper Suspicious Activity Report 
(SAR) and anti-money laundering (AML) fil-
ings as required under the Bank Secrecy Act, 
access to federal deposit insurance and a 
Federal Reserve master account, and even 
potential issues with the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS). Missteps in these areas could 
prove devastating to an institution. It 
should be noted that these risks also exist 
when providing financial services to ancil-
lary businesses that provide products and 
services to MRBs and fall within the credit 
union’s field of membership, even if the 
state-authorized MRB does not 
NAFCU does not have, and is not taking, a 
position on the broader question of the legal-
ization or decriminalization of marijuana at 
any degree at the federal or state level. How-
ever, we do support Congress taking the 
steps found in H.R. 1996 to provide greater 
clarity and legal certainty at the federal 
level for credit unions that choose to provide 
financial services to state-authorized MRBs 
and ancillary businesses that may serve 
those businesses in states where such activ-
ity is legal. While H.R. 1996 does not address 
every issue on this front, it seeks to provide 
a safe harbor for financial institutions that 
wish to serve such businesses and would be 
an important step towards improving clarity 
and addressing what is often perceived as 
misalignment between federal and state 
laws. It is with this in mind that NAFCU 
urges you to support the SAFE Banking Act 
of 2021 when it comes before the House. 
Thank you for your attention to this im-
portant issue. We look forward to continuing 
to work with you on this and other issues of 
importance to credit unions. Should you 
have any questions or require any additional 
information, please do not hesitate to con-
tact me or Sarah Jacobs, NAFCU’s Associate 
Director of Legislative Affairs. 
Sincerely, 
BRAD THALER, 
Vice President of Legislative Affairs.

DEAR SENATOR BROWN, SENATOR TOOMEY, 
REPRESENTATIVE WATERS
AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE MCHENRY: On behalf of the nation’s 
State Treasurers, I wanted to thank you for 
your leadership on critical state finance 
issues and to express our support for the Se-
cure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking 
Act of 2021 (H.R. 1996). While we do not take 
any formal position on efforts to expand the 
legality 
of 
cannabis—medical 
or 
rec-
reational—our 
association 
remains 
con-
cerned by the ancillary effects posed by le-
gitimate participants in the industry lacking 
reliable access to the federally regulated 
banking system. 
By July of this year, 15 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia will have legalized adult 
use cannabis, and 36 states will have legal-
ized access to medical cannabis. Nonetheless, 
conflicts between federal banking laws and 
state cannabis laws create unsafe conditions 
where many cannabis related businesses rely 
on cash-only business models, despite other-
wise fully complying with their state’s 
health and safety rules. Unbanked cannabis 
businesses are frequently unable to write 
checks, make and receive electronic pay-
ments, utilize payroll providers, accept debit 
or credit cards, or pay taxes through a finan-
cial institution. The condition makes tax 
collection more difficult and burdensome for 
both businesses and governments, and sub-
stantially increases the likelihood of tax 
fraud. The inability to access banking serv-
ices not only directly impacts cannabis busi-
nesses, but also the secondary service pro-
viders in our states who do business with 
them. 
The National Association of State Treas-
urers continues to support commonsense fed-
eral laws and regulations to provide essen-
tial banking services to legitimate cannabis 
businesses, promote public safety and finan-
cial transparency, and facilitate tax and fee 
collection without compromising federal en-
forcement of anti-money laundering laws 
against criminal enterprises. To that extent, 
we fully support the key elements of the 
SAFE Banking Act that comport with our 
association’s policy as outlined in this letter 
and that is contained in our policy resolu-
tion (see attachment). We also thank Rep. 
Perlmutter, Rep. Stivers, Sen. Merkley, Sen. 
Daines and all of their colleagues for leading 
on this issue. 
I have asked our policy director, Brian 
Egan, to follow up with your offices should 
you have any questions, comments or con-
cerns. Please consider our members and pro-
fessional staff as resources to you and your 
teams. 
Thank you again for your consideration on 
this matter.

SHAUN SNYDER, 
Executive Director,

Hon. NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE STIVERS, 
House of Representatives,

Hon. WARREN DAVIDSON, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, STIV-
ERS, VELA´ ZQUEZ, AND DAVIDSON: On behalf of 
the 1.4 million members of the National As-
sociation of REALTORS (NAR) and its affil-
iate, the Institute of Real. Estate Manage-
ment (IREM), thank you for introducing the 
‘‘Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Bank-
ing Act of 2021.’’ This bipartisan bill provides 
a clear framework for cannabis businesses to 
access financial services. As more states le-
galize cannabis use, the industry continues 
to rapidly grow, with more than $10 billion 
in sales and $1 billion in state tax revenue al-
ready recorded. However, the barriers keep-
ing these state-legal businesses from access-
ing federally-insured banks can impede their 
ability to grow while raising safety issues in 
their communities. 
Thirty-six states have legalized cannabis 
for medical or recreational use, a number 
that is expected to continue to go up in the 
coming years. Despite this, current federal 
law prevents federally-insured banks from 
working with cannabis businesses, as well as 
ancillary businesses that provide them with 
goods and services—including real estate 
professionals who have cannabis business 
owners as their clients. As a result, those 
states are struggling to address significant 
challenges to public safety and the regu-
latory compliance issues that arise with 
cash-only businesses. 
The SAFE Banking Act takes an impor-
tant step toward enabling financial services 
for legitimate cannabis-related businesses by 
specifying that their proceeds will not be 
considered unlawful under federal money 
laundering laws, thus allowing these busi-
nesses access to federally-insured banking 
institutions. Further, it directs the Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) 
and federal banking regulators to issue guid-
ance and exam procedures for banks working 
with cannabis businesses. As the legal state- 
cannabis industry grows, the connections to 
other types of industries—including real es-
tate—will grow as well. 
State-legal cannabis businesses require 
real 
estate—farmland, 
warehouses, 
and 
storefronts—creating multiple contacts to 
other industries and businesses, each of

which is affected by current laws keeping

and ensuring further growth to the U.S.

RECOGNIZING 
GITANJALI 
RAO, 
COLORADO’S 4TH DISTRICT CON-
GRESSIONAL 
APP 
CHALLENGE 
WINNER 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ms. Gitanjali Rao for being selected 
as Colorado’s 4th District Congressional App 
Challenge Winner. With one in five pre-teens 
in the U.S. reporting being cyberbullied, 
cyberbullying 
others, 
or 
having 
seen 
cyberbullying, Ms. Rao’s app ‘‘Kindly’’ serves 
as a preventative measure to help protect 
America’s children from this unfortunately 
common harassment. 
Ms. Rao, a student at STEM School High-
lands Ranch and TIME’s 2020 Kid of the Year, 
created the app ‘‘Kindly’’, a one-of-a-kind app 
that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to 
detect and prevent cyberbullying at an early 
stage. Ms. Rao’s commitment to young people 
affected by cyberbullying is a credit to her. Her 
hard work and ingenuity are showcased 
through this thoughtful, innovative app. She 
has shown true leadership in her community, 
and her app will help defeat cyberbullying 
around the country. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Colorado, I extend my best wishes to Ms. 
Rao. Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recog-
nize Ms. Rao for her great accomplishments.

IN HONOR OF NATIONAL ARAB 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. MARIE NEWMAN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate April as Arab American Heritage 
Month and honor the outstanding contributions 
that Arab Americans have made to this coun-
try. 
For over a century, Arab Americans have 
been an integral part of virtually every aspect 
of American society, including medicine, law, 
business, education, technology, government, 
military service, and culture. The incredible 
contributions and heritage of Arab Americans 
have helped us build a better nation. 
Men and women of Arab descent have 
strengthened their communities through in-
volvement in community service and public life 
and by sharing their rich culture and traditions 
with neighbors and friends. In Illinois’ Third 
District, which has one of the largest con-
centrations of Palestinian, Jordanian, and Syr-
ian Americans in the country, the Arab Amer-
ican community is a fundamental part of our 
civic life and culture. 
Unfortunately, Arab Americans continue to 
face misconceptions, bigotry, and anti-Arab 
hate. These civil rights abuses, and instances 
of harmful stereotyping and bullying, must be 
combatted through education, awareness, and 
legislation. 
Arab Americans join all Americans in the 
desire to see a peaceful and diverse society, 
where every individual is treated equally and 
feels safe; we must continue to work towards 
a future where every American is able to live 
free from discrimination. 
I am proud to celebrate the extraordinary 
contributions Arab Americans have made to 
this country, and I am deeply honored to rec-
ognize National Arab American Heritage 
month this April.

IN MEMORY OF MARY SOMERS 
BALLARD 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mrs. Mary Somers Ballard. 
Mrs. Ballard was born in Holyoke, Massachu-
setts on July 22nd, 1919. She passed away 
on April 14, 2021. 
Mrs. Ballard was a descendant of two of the 
co-founders of Rhode Island. She was a proud 
New Englander who trained in nursing at 
Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
She enrolled at Boston University and worked 
at Massachusetts General Hospital. At the age 
of 23, she entered the U.S. Army Nurse 
Corps, 811th Air Evacuation Squadron. When 
asked why she joined the military, she said 
‘‘We were at war. I joined the Army Air Corps 
because I thought I could make a contribu-
tion.’’ First Lieutenant Somers served two 
years in England. Following D–Day, she cared 
for the wounded soldiers in hospital flights 
from France and Germany to England. Mrs. 
Somers was stationed with U.S. troops behind 
enemy lines during the Battle of the Bulge and 
entered Paris the day after its liberation. After 
the war, she remained in the reserves until 
she married. 
First Lt. Somers met her physician husband, 
Captain Joseph Aloysius Ballard, while serving 
at the Chanute Field Army Hospital in Illinois. 
They married on April 2, 1948. Dr. and Mrs. 
Ballard made their home in Lexington, Ken-
tucky, where they raised eight children and 
were active members of Christ the King 
Church. Mrs. Ballard had 17 grandchildren 
and 11 great-grandchildren, with 2 more ex-
pected in July. In 2015, at the age of 95, Mrs. 
Ballard threw out the first pitch at the Lex-
ington Legends Military Appreciation Night to 
highlight Kentucky’s women veterans. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot, celebrate her life, and appreciate her for 
her service and sacrifice to our nation during 
World War II. As a part of ‘‘The Greatest Gen-
eration’’, Mrs. Ballard was an important part of 
the war effort to preserve the freedoms that 
we enjoy today. I am forever grateful for 
Americans like Mary Somers Ballard.

DISTRACTED DRIVING AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join thousands of organizations 
and individuals around the country in observa-
tion of Distracted Driving Awareness Month. 
Ten years ago, a mother who lost her daugh-
ter to a distracted driving crash successfully 
petitioned this body to have April officially des-
ignated as Distracted Driving Awareness 
Month. Unfortunately, we are still dealing with 
the impact of distracted driving on our road-
ways. 
Research shows that using electronic de-
vices increases cognitive distraction. This can 
be deadly on the road, where a split-second 
distraction can cause a crash. Approximately 
3,142 people died in distraction affected driv-
ing crashes in 2019—that’s eight people every 
day dying from a completely preventable 
cause—and this number is widely believed to 
be undercounted. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the roads 
have become much more dangerous. Motor 
vehicle deaths in 2020 are estimated to be the 
highest in 13 years, despite dramatic drops in 
miles driven Americans stayed home. While 
it’s too early to have a full understanding of 
what caused this increase in the number of 
people dying in crashes, distraction certainly 
played a part. 
Recognizing these dangerous trends, I’m 
proud to be the leader of the SAFE TO DRIVE 
Act with my colleagues MIKE GALLAGHER and 
STEVE COHEN. SAFE TO DRIVE incentivizes 
states to pass laws eliminating distraction on 
our roadways. I hope my colleagues will join 
me in supporting passage of this legislation. 
I encourage all motorists to commit to driv-
ing attentively and safely, without the distrac-
tion of cell phones or other devices. I also 
hope my colleagues will join me this month in 
raising awareness about this important issue. 
Do it for all of our constituents. Their lives are 
more valuable than any call, email, or text.

CONGRATULATING 
SHERIFF 
TYSON STEPHENS ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Sheriff Tyson Stephens, Emanuel 
County’s longest-serving sheriff, on his recent 
retirement. 
Sheriff Stephens first entered public service 
in 1982, and has spent his career ensuring the 
community is a safe place to live, work and 
raise a family. He has certainly made an im-
pact on Emanuel County, and it will continue 
to be felt for years to come. 
I know that his family has made many sac-
rifices over the past three decades, and it is 
time for him to enjoy this next chapter with his 
wife, children and grandchildren. I thank Sher-
iff Stephens for his service and commitment, 
and congratulations on his retirement.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL MATTHEW D. GORSUCH 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Mat-
thew D. Gorsuch of the U.S. Air Force, upon 
his departure from the Department of the Air 
Force Directorate of Legislative Liaison. As-
signed as a Liaison Officer to the U.S. House 
of 
Representatives, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Gorsuch served as a critical bridge between 
key senior leaders within the Department of 
Defense, to include the Secretary of the Air 
Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of 
Space Operations and 147 assigned Members 
of Congress, to include the Speaker and the 
Chairman of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee. Over these past two years, he led 
international travel for four Speaker congres-
sional delegations, including bi-lateral engage-
ments with state leaders from the United King-
dom, France, and Poland, strengthening 
bonds with the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion. His actions reinforced Federal priorities 
for both the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Acts. He will be 
deeply missed after exceptional years of serv-
ice. 
Lieutenant Colonel Gorsuch is a native of 
Leoti, Kansas, and is a graduate of Oklahoma 
State University with a Bachelor’s in Mechan-
ical Engineering and a Master’s of Business 
Administration. He is a 2018 graduated De-
fense Legislative Fellow. 
Lieutenant Colonel Gorsuch began his ca-
reer in 2003 at Vance Air Force Base, Okla-
homa, as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot, 
and has since held numerous Special Oper-
ations assignments, flying the MC–130H Com-
bat Talon II at Hurlburt Field, Florida, and 
Royal Air Force Mildenhall in the United King-
dom. Trusted for his tactical acumen, he was 
assigned as a Combat Air Advisor in the 711th 
Special Operations Squadron, the very same 
squadron he is departing the Legislative Liai-
son to Command. His extensive background in 
aviation has been critical to our work in 
strengthening, recapitalizing, and building our 
Nation’s air and space forces. 
This moment is bittersweet, as we are deep-
ly saddened to see Matt go. However, we are 
excited for what awaits him, wish him luck as 
he commands his prior unit, and look forward 
to seeing what his future holds. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. Con-
gress and a grateful Nation, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Lieutenant Colonel 
Gorsuch for his dedicated service to the U.S. 
Air Force, U.S. House of Representatives, and 
to our Nation.

HONORING 
THE 
175TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
FREDERICKSBURG, 
TEXAS 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the 175th anniversary of Fredericks-
burg, Texas. Fredericksburg was founded on 
May 8, 1846, by Baron Otfried Hans von 
Meusebach as the second prominent German 
settlement in the Texas Hill Country. Those 
brave settlers established a cordial relation-
ship with the local Comanche tribes allowing 
the town to grow into what it is today. Now 
many years later, Fredericksburg has grown 
into the national spotlight for its wonderful at-
tractions and rich German-Texan culture. 
Sites throughout Fredericksburg are near 
and dear to my heart. I love to visit 
Luckenbach dance hall with my family and lis-
ten to local songwriters cover Waylon Jen-
nings and Willie Nelson. I recommend visiting 
fields of bluebonnets and wildflowers in the 
spring 
and 
enjoying 
some 
world-famous 
peaches in the summer. While some of the 
buildings and faces have changed in Fred-
ericksburg, the people are still the same hard-
working, friendly Texans who helped mold the 
state. 
Fredericksburg is full of American history. 
Giants like Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz 
call Fredericksburg home. Admiral Nimitz led 
American forces to victory in the battle of Mid-
way, regarded as the most important battle in 
Naval History. The beautiful National Museum 
of the Pacific War, named in his honor, re-
sides in downtown Fredericksburg. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
pay tribute to the many figures who helped 
shape the history of Fredericksburg. I want to 
extend my thanks to the Mayor and city lead-
ership who have worked with me on important 
issues throughout my first two terms, and to 
groups like the Gillespie County Historical So-
ciety who work hard to preserve the history of 
the region. It is an immense privilege to serve 
those who will continue to shape the future of 
Fredericksburg, Texas for the next 175 years. 
I hope my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives will join me in congratulating the 
town of Fredericksburg on this historic occa-
sion. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 77TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF EXERCISE TIGER 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep and poignant gratitude that I rise today 
to celebrate the American heroes who lost 
their lives seventy-seven years ago during Ex-
ercise Tiger. Paving the way for the D-Day in-
vasion that would take place on June 6, 1944, 
Exercise Tiger, while once kept secret, is now 
regarded as having been both a tragedy and 
a critically instructive component of the Allies’ 
mission to end World War II. The lives lost on 
that fateful day were honored by the soldiers 
who learned from Exercise Tiger and carried 
their memory into battle during the liberation of 
France. It is a story we must never allow our-
selves to forget. 
Before the assembled British, Canadian, 
and American forces could carry out the D- 
Day invasion, 4,000 soldiers conducted a 
massive simulated landing to rehearse and 
prepare for that immeasurably vital military 
act. However, what started as a military exer-
cise ended as one of the greatest military trag-
edies of World War II. The calm, dark night of 
April 28, 1944, burst into chaos and combat 
when German U-boats ambushed the Tank 
Landing Ships (LSTs) transporting American 
soldiers. Almost 750 American servicemen, in-
cluding over 200 Missourians, would give their 
last full measure of devotion when their ves-
sels were either destroyed or severely dam-
aged. But Allied forces would not be deterred, 
as the brave soldiers on those vessels banded 
together to repel enemy attacks and move for-
ward with their mission. Even in the face of 
immense loss, a well-equipped enemy force, 
and little help from nearby Allied forces, the 
tenacity and determination of the soldiers and 
sailors involved ensured that the landing oper-
ations would continue mere hours after the ini-
tial attack. Allied Commanders planning the 
eventual D-Day invasion learned from Exer-
cise Tiger and incorporated new strategies to 
ensure soldiers would be protected from bar-
rage before landing on the beach. Without the 
bravery of the forces that fought that day, it is 
possible that even more American, Canadian, 
and British lives would have been lost on D- 
Day, and that the invasion of France, which 
hinged on secrecy, speed, and synchronicity, 
would have failed. It is not hyperbole to say 
that the soldiers and sailors of Exercise Tiger 
changed the course of world history and that 
we are forever indebted to their sacrifice. 
It is a time-honored tradition in the United 
States for us to gather and celebrate the her-
oism and sacrifices of the countless fathers, 
mothers, brothers, sisters, and children who 
have died to protect our nation from foreign 
and domestic threats. On the last Monday of 
May, thousands congregate to quietly observe 
and remember the names found on marble 
headstones cascading across Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. On the fourth day of July, we 
join friends and family for a celebration of our 
nation’s independence. On each November 
11th, we reach out to the veterans in our lives, 
thank them for their service, and if we are 
lucky, listen to their stories of service. Scat-
tered between these national celebrations are 
memorials hosted in small towns and big cities

across America that pay tribute to the local 
legends who fought to protect the freedoms 
we hold dear. Every year since 1989, the Ex-
ercise 
Tiger 
Commemorative 
Foundation, 
alongside the Coast Guard Station Barnegat 
Light, have celebrated the heroes of Exercise 
Tiger with a wreath-laying ceremony at sta-
tions across the United States. It is now the 
longest-running wreath tribute in Coast Guard 
history. 
Moreover, this year, the Exercise Tiger 
Commemorative Foundation has worked with 
the Audrain County Commissioners to memo-
rialize and celebrate the oft-overlooked her-
oism of our nation’s Black soldiers and sailors. 
We must never lose sight of the fact that while 
Black soldiers were fighting for the freedom of 
France, they themselves were not free in 
America. As they parachuted in Normandy 
and stormed Omaha and Utah Beaches, our 
nation was upholding the horrors of segrega-
tion and Jim Crow. They did so because they 
believed in the promise of America. We are all 
eternally indebted to that faith and their sac-
rifices, and I want to thank the Foundation and 
the Audrain County Commissioners for work-
ing to ensure that all our veterans receive the 
praise, glory, and honor they have earned. 
A 5,000-pound anchor, located in Audrain 
County, serves as the memorial for the heroes 
of Exercise Tiger. However, it is more than 
just a relic of the past. Rather, it is a constant 
reminder that our freedom was paid for by the 
sacrifices of those who came before us. At the 
beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, a blue 
ribbon was wrapped around that anchor, and 
it was only to be cut down when a vaccine 
was developed. On April 28, 2021, as our sci-
entists, healthcare workers, and soldiers en-
gage in a noble crusade against COVID–19 at 
vaccination sites across the country, that rib-
bon will be removed. While its removal does 
not signal the end of the pandemic, it does 
celebrate the fact that we are accomplishing 
what seemed impossible just months ago. We 
have demonstrated, like the Greatest Genera-
tion before us, that America can overcome 
any threat when we are united, be it a fleet of 
enemy submarines or an elusive virus. That 
capacity will always be worth celebrating. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and my 
colleagues in honoring the nearly 750 Ameri-
cans, including 201 Missourians, who gave 
their lives during Exercise Tiger. Additionally, 
please join me in extending a heartfelt ‘‘thank 
you’’ to the Audrain County Commissioners, 
the Exercise Tiger Commemorative Founda-
tion, and the Coast Guard Station Barnegat 
Light, for organizing these memorial events 
each year since 1989. On April 28th, it is my 
fervent hope that we all take a moment to re-
member the victims and veterans of Exercise 
Tiger and to re-affirm our commitment to hon-
oring their legacy each day through selfless 
service to others in our community.

HONORING DR. KANIKA BOWEN- 
JALLOW 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Dr. Kanika Bowen-Jallow, a re-
spected pediatric surgeon at Cook Children’s 
Pediatric Hospital in Prosper, Texas. 
As a child, Kanika developed an early fas-
cination for medicine, spending hours playing 
Operation and with her Playskool Doctor Kit. 
This desire to care for others would continue 
to grow, prompting her to diligently work to-
wards her medical degree at the University of 
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and later 
spending an additional nine years training to 
become a pediatric surgeon. Dr. Bowen-Jallow 
credits her success to the support of her lov-
ing family who encouraged her to pursue her 
education and realize her dreams. 
Recently, the American Pediatric Surgical 
Association recognized Dr. Bowen-Jallow as 
the ninth Black female pediatric surgeon in the 
U.S. 
Dr. Bowen-Jallow’s dedication to providing 
the highest quality of care is evidenced by her 
involvement in a variety of professional organi-
zations, including the American Pediatric Sur-
gical Association, as a Fellow of the American 
College of Surgeons, a Fellow of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, and a number of na-
tional committees that address the need for 
excellent, comprehensive pediatric surgical 
care. Further, her research in the area of 
childhood obesity has earned her multiple rec-
ognitions from respected publications. Addi-
tionally, Dr. Bowen-Jallow consistently works 
to increase and promote diversity in medicine, 
serving tirelessly as a mentor to young people 
in communities of color. 
As a highly esteemed surgeon, educator, 
mother, and wife, Dr. Kanika Bowen-Jallow 
recognizes the trust and faith placed in her by 
patients and their families and serves as a 
shining example of service before self. I en-
courage my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating Dr. 
Bowen-Jallow’s many achievements in the 
area of medicine and wish her continued suc-
cess as she serves as an inspiration to those 
around her.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
GENE 
MULLIN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Eugene Mullin, known to all 
as Gene, who died on April 5, 2021, three 
years after being diagnosed with cancer. He 
was born in the San Francisco Bay Area on 
April 21, 1937, and lived most of his life in 
South San Francisco. 
Gene Mullin gave generously of his time 
and considerable talents in service to our 
country, serving in the Judge Advocate Corps 
of the U.S. Army from 1959 to 1960, and 
earned a Bachelor’s degree and a lifetime 
secondary teaching certificate from the Univer-
sity of San Francisco (USF). 
A lifelong teacher, Gene Mullin taught Social 
Studies at South San Francisco High School 
for 32 years. He was named the San Mateo 
County Teacher of the Year in 1991, was hon-
ored as Alumnus of the Year 2011 by USF’s 
School of Education, and Riordan High 
School’s first Alumnus of the Year in 2010. He 
coached basketball for two decades, served 
as President of the SSF CTA, and made edu-
cational videos on social studies topics. Thou-
sands of South San Francisco students bene-
fitted from his complete dedication to them 
and his commitment to their education. 
Gene Mullin began his career in local public 
service in 1972 when he was appointed to the 
South San Francisco Planning Commission. 
He served seven years on the South San 
Francisco City Council, two of them as Mayor. 
He was elected to the California State Assem-
bly in 2002, representing California’s 19th As-
sembly District, and served for three exem-
plary terms. Gene wrote several books about 
local government and received numerous well- 
deserved awards and honors for his public 
service. He will be remembered for his devo-
tion to the people of South San Francisco, and 
particularly to the youth of the community and 
his role in getting them involved in govern-
ment. He was a hardworking legislator who 
set the gold standard for public office with his 
integrity and commitment to his constituents. 
Gene Mullin was preceded in death by his 
beloved wife Terri. He leaves his son, Kevin 
Mullin, who is currently the Speaker Pro Tem-
pore of the California State Assembly, his 
daughter Jennifer, and five adored grandsons. 
Gene’s son Kevin said ‘‘His legacy on civic 
engagement lives on through the lives of his 
legions of students, as well as his children and 
grandchildren. He was our proverbial north 
star and we’ll never be the same with him 
gone.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in extending our 
condolences to Gene Mullin’s family. Gene 
was a cherished friend and I had the deepest 
admiration and respect for him. He was a 
great and good man, a superb educator, a 
highly effective legislator and a mentor to 
many. He made his community better by the 
way he lived, led and worked, and he 
strengthened our nation immeasurably.

IN RECOGNITION OF JESU´ S 
MORALES 
HON. MARIE NEWMAN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor my guest to President Biden’s Address 
to a Joint Session of Congress, Jesu´s Mo-
rales, who is a union hospitality worker in Illi-
nois’ Third District and a member of UNITE 
HERE Local 1. Thanks to the passage of the 
American Rescue Plan, laid off union workers 
are now able to stay on their employers’ 
health plans until the fall, providing critical re-
lief to workers like Jesu´s who was struggling 
to pay for the daily medicine and care his fam-
ily needs. 
Millions of union workers like Jesu´s—who 
have given decades to their work—saw their 
jobs taken away by this pandemic only to see 
their employer health plans taken away too. 
Without work and without relief from their gov-
ernment, these workers struggled between 
paying their families’ urgently needed medi-
cine and putting food on the table. Thanks to 
the American Rescue Plan, workers like Jesu´s 
are now able to stay on their employer’s 
health plans at no cost through the end of 
September. 
Our union workers have given everything to 
our city and country, and it is time we honor 
them in return. That is why I am proud to 
honor Jesu´s this week as my virtual guest to 
President Biden’s Address to a Joint Session 
of Congress. We will not stop fighting to en-
sure our workers and struggling families are 
receiving the relief they need to survive this 
pandemic.

Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

the Columbia County School System, for her 
commitment to our students’ education, and to 
congratulate her on her upcoming retirement. 
Dr. Carraway has dedicated her life to edu-

school district saw growth while under her 
leadership, and she will be remembered for al-
ways prioritizing the well-being of our stu-

dented challenges. 
She led the school district as it was one of 
the first in Georgia to reopen following the 
COVID–19 outbreak. Thanks to her leader-
ship, Columbia County students were able to 
continue learning and stay on track academi-
cally. I know parents are eternally grateful for 
her actions to get students back in the class-
room in such a prompt and safe manner.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF MICHAEL SPELLMAN 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the outstanding 34-year career 
in public safety of the City of Groton Police 
Chief Michael Spellman. Chief Spellman re-
cently announced his retirement, after serving 
the public as a member of law enforcement in 
various capacities including resident state 
trooper for 25 years, followed by a stint as a 
detective in the statewide narcotics squad, 
and culminating in his appointment to the 
Chief of the Groton force. Throughout that 
long tenure he upheld the highest standards of 
ethics, 
professionalism, 
and 
compassion, 
never losing focus on his mission ‘‘to protect 
and serve.’’ 
A lifelong proud resident of the Pawcatuck 
section of Stonington, Michael is a proud 
alumnus of Stonington High School where he 
was involved in student government, a multi- 
sport Varsity letterman, and an honorable 
mention as an Offensive Guard on the 1980 
New Haven Register All State Team. Michael 
demonstrated his leadership skills early in life 
and took his talents to Central Connecticut 
State University where he would earn his B.A. 
in political science and public administration. 
After earning his degree, Michael decided to 
dedicate himself to working on the front lines 
to protect the public as a law enforcement offi-
cer. In 1987, Michael graduated from the 96th 
Training Troop of The Connecticut State Po-
lice—the rest, they say, is history. Starting his 
career as a state trooper at Troop E in 
Montville, Michael served the community as a 
state police officer in East Lyme, Danielson, 
and Meriden. While simultaneously working as

April 28, 2021 
a state trooper—Michael was also active in 
several community coalitions including the 
Quality-of-Life Task Force, The Women’s Cen-
ter of Northeast Connecticut Community Part-
nership Team, the statewide Casino Unit, 
among many other organizations. His hard 
work and dedication was rewarded when he 
was named State Police Troop Commander in 
Colchester, where he took command over 100 
sworn and civilian employees providing pri-
mary law enforcement for 11 municipalities 
and a population of over 100,000. Between 
2010 and 2014, Michael briefly departed the 
realm of public service to join the private sec-
tor as a security consultant. Heeding the call 
back to public service, however, Michael 
joined Groton’s local force as a patrol officer 
in 2014. As was expected with his extensive 
background—he climbed the ranks to Chief in 
2017, going on to work as a critical asset in 
furthering Groton City Police Department’s 
mission to ensure the safety and protection of 
our citizens. 
In his time as Chief of Groton Police Mi-
chael transformed the impact and culture of 
the local police force. His community policing 
style connected the department and members 
of the public in a way that allowed officers to 
work in tandem with citizens to tackle issues 
together. Under Michael’s leadership the de-
partment also underwent an era of moderniza-
tion, including joining the state radio system, 
implementing body cameras, de-escalation 
training, and hiring the first ALEC (Autism and 
Law Enforcement Education Coalition) certified 
instructor in Connecticut. These milestones 
exemplify only a small degree of what has 
been accomplished under Michael’s leader-
ship. For further example, in 2016 Michael 
made national headlines when he led the res-
cue mission to save a woman who accidently 
drove her car into the Thames River. This act 
garnered Michael and two fellow officers the 
department’s Lifesaving Award. One of my 
most memorable experiences as a Congress-
man was joining Chief Spellman for a ride 
along in the city a couple of years ago. He 
showed me parts of the community that were 
experiencing difficulty with the opioid crisis, 
and I saw him in action personally checking 
for the health and safety of some the more 
vulnerable citizens who clearly regarded him 
as a friend and neighbor, not a threatening 
outsider. Police work is a difficult balancing act 
for even the most talented experienced offi-
cers, and he showed me his almost effortless 
skill in mastering that balance. 
Michael amassed a multitude of accolades 
and awards throughout his career including 
MADD awards for DWI enforcement and edu-
cation, the Women’s Center of NECT Con-
necticut Crisis Center Distinguished Profes-
sional Award, five Outstanding Service Med-
als, three Unit Citations, and many other rec-
ognitions. A heavily decorated career such as 
Chief Spellman’s represents his true commit-
ment to keeping the community safe. One final 
comment I would like to share is that Chief 
Spellman comes from a family in which public 
service is an honored tradition. His late father 
James, Senior was a longtime first selectman 
of Stonington who made a huge positive dif-
ference in southeastern Connecticut. His 
brothers also have been pillars in the commu-
nity in various local and state offices and en-
deavors. I truly believe that his dad would be 
immensely proud of them all and applaud Mi-
chael’s departure on his own terms with a 
sterling reputation that upholds the family’s 
legacy. 
Madam Speaker, now, in May 2021, we 
sadly say goodbye to Michael’s conscientious 
leadership. As he steps down from his post as 
Chief, we can only go on to hope that the ex-
ample of his leadership will pass down to fu-
ture generations within the Groton Police De-
partment. I want to congratulate Michael on a 
civic service career spanning thirty-four years, 
and with this congratulations I ask the Cham-
ber join me in appreciating Groton Police 
Chief Michael Spellman and his dedication to 
serving the public. We thank Michael for ev-
erything he has done as a first responder. 
Best wishes to him for a joyful retirement and 
I wish his wife Heather Buffinton and two chil-
dren, Michael and Hannah, continued happi-
ness, and success.
