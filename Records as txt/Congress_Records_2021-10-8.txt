prayer: 
Good and gracious God, President 
Kennedy encouraged us not to ask 
what our country can do for us, but 
what we can do for our country. 
Jesus of Nazareth said that He had 
not come to be served but to serve. 
Lord, may we embark upon this new 
day, and every day, with that same 
spirit of service. 
May we humbly serve You, and our 
sisters and brothers, in our every word 
and deed. Then there will be true char-

We make this prayer in Your holy 
name. 
Amen.

HONORING ART IBELETO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend 
Art Ibeleto in commemoration of his substan-
tial contributions to Sonoma County through 
his remarkable career as the Pasta King. 
Art was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 
October 2, 1926, but moved with his family to 
Sesta Godano, Italy, as a toddler. At age 17, 
he was drafted into Mussolini’s Hitler-propped 
Republic of Salo` Army, but shortly after joining 
the Army, he made the brave decision to join 
the Italian resistance and fight against the 
Fascists and Nazi Germany. Following the end 
of World War II, Art immigrated to Petaluma, 
California where he met his wife, Vicki 
Ghiradelli Ibeleto, and worked as a farmer, a 
mechanic, a truck driver, and a factory worker. 
In 1961, Art purchased land in Sonoma 
County where he and his wife started building 
their business empire with a Christmas tree 
farm. In 1974, Art created the Spaghetti Pal-
ace as a booth at the Sonoma County Fair as 
a United Lodges, Sons of Italy project. As his 
booth grew in popularity, Art started building 
other businesses including a catering and 
freezer-case foods company, vineyards to 
grow premium wine grapes, and Art’s Place, a 
popular Italian restaurant in Rohnert Park. As 
a restaurateur, Art gained notoriety for his sa-
vory dishes. He was dubbed the ‘‘Pasta King’’ 
by journalist Bill Soberanes and became 
known by that title for the rest of his career. 
Art’s contributions to the Sonoma County 
community extended beyond his entrepre-
neurial endeavors. Over multiple decades, Art 
held benefit pasta feeds that brought the com-
munity together to raise money for charitable, 
educational, and civil causes. Furthermore, Art 
co-founded the North Bay Italian Cultural 
Foundation and served as state president of 
the Order of the Sons and Daughters of Italy 
in America. For his contributions to the com-
munity, Art won a number of local, state, and 
congressional awards, including Representa-
tive MIKE THOMPSON’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict American Dream Award in 2017, and a 
lifetime achievement award from Senator Mike 
McGuire in 2018. In 2021, I introduced a bill 
to rename the Cotati Post Office after Art to 
honor his contributions to the Sonoma County 
community. The bill was passed through the 
House Oversight Committee and was reported 
out of the Committee on June 29. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Art’s 
innovative entrepreneurship and selfless serv-
ice made a profound impact on Sonoma 
County. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor him here today. 
COMMENDING CHRISTOPHER 
WILLIAMS 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to recognize and honor the out-
standing service of Christopher Williams, who 
retires this week after 30 years as a public 
servant at the Congressional Budget Office. 
Christopher Williams joined CBO in 1991. 
He has served for many years as a principal 
analyst in the Macroeconomic Analysis Divi-
sion. In that capacity, he played a pivotal role 
in producing and describing CBO’s economic 
projections. Christopher developed and main-
tained the econometric model used to produce 
those projections and, later in his tenure, he 
took primary responsibility for generating and 
explaining CBO’s projections of consumer 
spending and the components of national in-
come. Christopher contributed regularly to 
CBO’s annual reports, including The Budget 
and Economic Outlook, and worked on numer-
ous CBO studies, which covered topics rang-
ing from national health expenditures to the ef-
fect of foreign aid in economic development 
and the effects of tax policy on labor markets. 
By all accounts, Christopher’s colleagues at 
CBO appreciate his dedication, dependability, 
collaboration, and breadth of experience. They 
will miss his generosity with his time and 
knowledge and, especially, his kindness. 
I know my colleagues will join me in extend-
ing our thanks and appreciation to Christopher 
for his service to our country. We wish him 
well in his future endeavors and hope that the 
Nation will continue to benefit from his exper-
tise and commitment.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
CAPTAIN TODD D. MOORE 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate and commend Captain 
Todd D. Moore for his time as the Com-
manding Officer of Naval Submarine Base 
New London. After two and a half years of dili-
gent service as the 52nd Commanding Officer 
of SUBASE New London located in Groton, 
Connecticut, Captain Moore turned over his 
command to Captain Kenneth M. Curtin, Jr. on 
September 24, 2021 at a Change of Com-
mand ceremony on the base with family, 
friends, and colleagues in attendance. Al-
though his time as the Commanding Officer at 
Naval Submarine Base New London has con-
cluded, Captain Moore’s legacy with the U.S. 
submarine Force will live on as an impressive 
example of leadership during an unprece-
dented global pandemic. 
Native to Willoughby Hill, Ohio, Captain 
Moore was quick to expand his horizons and 
achieve an education that spanned multiple 
states. He graduated from New York’s Ham-
ilton College summa cum laude with degrees 
in Physics and Classical Studies. From there, 
he enriched his military career path with a 
master’s degree in National Security and Stra-
tegic Studies at the Naval War College. It is 
worth noting Captain Moore carried on the val-
ues of education throughout his career and 
the betterment of his naval service with his 
participation and completion of an advanced, 
joint warfare training at the Joint Forces Staff 
College’s Joint and Combined War-fighting 
School in 2007. 
Armed with a qualified educational back-
ground, Captain Moore was of course already 
on his way to a decorated and accomplished 
naval career prior to his time as Commanding 
Officer of SUBASE New London. He com-
pleted three deployments in the Indo-Pacific 
as a division officer aboard the USS Pasa-
dena, as the Combat Systems Officer aboard 
the USS Asheville, and as the Executive Offi-
cer about the USS Georgia. He went on to 
serve as Commanding Officer of both the USS 
New Mexico and more recently the USS Mont-
pelier immediately prior to his service as Com-
manding Officer of SUBASE New London. In 
his time in Command of the USS New Mexico, 
Captain Moore conducted the very first Vir-
ginia-class submarine surfacing at the North 
Pole and successfully completed a Northern 
Atlantic deployment. 
Captain Moore served our nation in a wide 
range of capacities both on land and at sea. 
On the international front, Captain Moore 
played a role as the United Nations’ Military 
Observer for the UN’s peacekeeping mission 
in the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO. 
Notably, Captain Moore further directed his 
service toward our national security apparatus 
as branch chief in the Capability and Re-
source Integration directorate at U.S. Strategic 
Command. Here in eastern Connecticut, 
Moore also spent time as the lead tactics in-
structor at the Naval Submarine School in 
Groton, Connecticut. Captain Moore continued 
his example of service as a Deputy on the 
staffs of Submarine Squadron Twelve and 
Four and as a Prospective Commanding Offi-
cer and Intermediate Leadership Course in-
structor for the Naval Leadership & Ethics 
Center. 
Since 2019, Commanding Officer Moore has 
played an effective and crucial role as the 
man-in-charge of SUBASE New London. In 
his time as Commanding Officer for SUBASE 
New London, Captain Moore pursued cam-
paigns to meaningfully connect with the naval 
community. This pursuit paid huge dividends 
when his stewardship of the base turned itself 
on its head with the outset of the COVID–19 
pandemic employing his down to earth ‘‘nuts 
and bolts’’ leadership style, Captain Moore led 
his community through the worst of the pan-
demic, setting a nationwide example for mo-
rale and public health with the base achieving 
the highest vaccination rates among all Navy

installations, at home and abroad. In doing so, 
Captain Moore maintained the essential day- 
to-day mission of the base, keeping sailors 
trained and ever improving upon their mission 
of combat readiness. The 15 attack sub-
marines stationed in Groton still kept a high 
tempo of deployments and did not miss one 
single day of schedule due to the pandemic. 
Captain Moore never ceased his work to 
better the community on SUBASE New Lon-
don via his connection to the families and 
childcare on the naval base. During his com-
mand, he oversaw the opening of the only 
United Service Organizations center in Con-
necticut which will continue to help provide 
much-needed resources and relief for the 
servicemembers and families of SUBASE New 
London. For all his efforts in his two and a half 
years of command, it is no surprise that the 
men and women at Naval Submarine Base 
New London will remember Captain Moore as 
he is—a devoted, enduring, and passionate 
leader. 
Madam Speaker, I have had the honor to 
represent the Town of Groton and the 
servicemembers on SUBASE New London for 
many years in Congress, and as such, I have 
seen firsthand Captain Moore’s dedicated 
work. As he turns over his command of 
SUBASE New London, Captain Moore will 
continue to work on the base with the Under-
sea Warfighting Development Center to help 
decide future investment priorities for the sub-
marine force. To that end, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in congratulating 
and thanking Captain Todd D. Moore on a 
long history of service to our country, and fur-
ther wishing himself, his wife Carrie and two 
children the best in this new chapter for their 
family.

MARIE BEELER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Marie Beeler for receiving 
the Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Woman 
of the Year Award. 
This award is given to a member of the 
community who has displayed outstanding 
leadership and a passion for helping those 
around them. Marie has been described as a 
local hero. someone who sees the good in 
people, and who is able to recognize the 
issues facing her community and tackle them 
head on. 
Through her work with HOPE (Help Our 
People Eat), Arvada High School, Severe 
Weather Network, migrant ministry, Hope 
House and a variety of other causes and orga-
nizations, she has helped feed thousands of 
Coloradans in need. She personally hauls 
loads of canned goods, backpacks full of 
school supplies and other heavy items in and 
out of her truck. Her passion comes from a 
deep belief that a child is only able to learn 
when he/she fed and alert. Enabling children 
to learn will ensure they get an education 
which will lead to a good-paying job and suc-
cess beyond the classroom. Marie has con-
tinuously served as the voice and a champion 
for 
those 
who 
need 
it 
most—the 
disenfranchised, the poor, or the minority— 
across Arvada. 
Congratulations to Marie Beeler for receiv-
ing the Woman of the Year Award. Her hard 
work, compassion and dedication to our com-
munity is greatly appreciated.

HONORING GEORGE M. TABER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor George M. 
Taber for his monumental contributions to the 
California wine community. 
Born and raised in Riverside, California, in 
1942, Mr. Taber attended Loyola High School 
in Los Angeles where he graduated in 1960. 
He then graduated from Georgetown Univer-
sity in 1964 where he received his BA in Polit-
ical Science. One year later, Mr. Taber at-
tained his Degree in European Studies while 
attending the College of Europe in Bruges, 
Belgium. Although he never moved back to 
California, he reconnected with his Californian 
roots after writing his article on the 1976 
Judgement of Paris, an event that showcased 
California’s finest wines in competition with top 
wines from France. At this event, Napa Valley 
Wineries took first prize for both their red and 
white wines. He was the only reporter who 
covered this event that forever changed Cali-
fornia’s standing in the wine community and 
attracted world-wide attention. The influence of 
Mr. Taber’s reporting was so influential that 
the San Francisco Chronicle deemed his arti-
cle as ‘‘the most significant news story ever 
written about wine.’’ 
As a hard-working and dedicated journalist, 
Mr. Taber dedicated 21 years of his life as a 
reporter and editor with TIME Magazine based 
in Bonn, Germany; Paris, France; Houston, 
Texas; and New York. With his growing love 
for wine, he went on to write several books, 
including ‘‘Judgment of Paris: California vs. 
France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting 
That Revolutionized Wine’’ and ‘‘To Cork or 
Not to Cork,’’ which won the Jane Grigson 
Award from the International Association of 
Culinary Professionals. This award is given to 
those who have demonstrated distinguished 
scholarship and research into cookbooks. Mr. 
Taber was also a finalist for the James Beard 
Award for best book on wine and alcohol and 
the Andrew Simon Award for best wine book. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. 
Taber’s exemplary journalism has brought 
great prosperity to California’s wine commu-
nity. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor him here today.

Sheriff and dedicated public servant of Sevier 
County, Tennessee. Mr. Seals is currently the

and has served the citizens of Sevier County 
with honor and integrity and I proudly honor 
him.

HON. CYNTHIA AXNE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize two dedicated leaders for mental 
health and suicide prevention in our commu-
nity—Joni Thornton and Nicole Mortenson. 
Joni and Nicole are co-chairs of the Out of the 
Darkness Central Iowa Walk. The annual walk 
is part of the American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention in Iowa and helps raise awareness 
for suicide prevention and mental health in the 
community. 
Joni and Nicole led a very successful walk 
in Ankeny on September 19. Hundreds of 
Iowans gathered at the DMACC campus to 
share hope for families affected by suicide. 
The event also featured a virtual memorial 
wall on Facebook to honor the lives lost to sui-
cide in the past year.

The co-chairs aim to make the walk family- 
friendly year after year, because suicide and 
mental health do not just impact adults. There 
has been an increase in pediatric mental 
health issues in recent years, and mental 
health affects the whole family. The co-chairs 
have included events for the whole family in 
the walk, from face painting and bracelet mak-
ing to live music and therapy dogs. 
Although the walk takes place on one day, 
Joni, Nicole, and their team begin preparing 
for the event months in advance. They start 
planning in January and meet often to orga-
nize sponsors, vendors, and volunteers. This 
year, the walk had 15 sponsors supporting the 
event. 80 percent of every dollar from spon-
sorships goes to suicide prevention and men-
tal health research tight here in Iowa. 
Joni and Nicole are tireless advocates for 
mental health, and their dedication to raising 
awareness in the community is remarkable. 
Joni has worked with the American Suicide 
Prevention Foundation for 12 years and Nicole 
has served the organization since 2015. Both 
women coordinate an amazing walk that pro-
vides a space for families of those lost to sui-
cide to feel understood and to meet other fam-
ilies affected by suicide. 
The American Suicide Prevention Founda-
tion offers free resources for individuals and 
families across the region. The organization 
has monthly support groups, community-based 
presentations, and programs to help Iowans 
become more aware of mental health. 
Joni and Nicole’s advocacy for suicide pre-
vention and mental health awareness have 
changed lives and provided hope for countless 
Iowans. It is my pleasure to honor Joni Thorn-
ton and Nicole Mortenson as Iowans of the 
Week.

HONORING NEWS 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor NEWS, Napa 
County’s only domestic violence and sexual 
abuse agency, as it celebrates its 40th anni-
versary. 
Founded in 1981, NEWS was created by 
members of the Napa County community with 
the mission of providing a safe place for 
women and children who experienced domes-
tic abuse. With the help of local Napa County 
leaders, NEWS founders were able to acquire 
a house, and begin to shelter survivors of do-
mestic abuse when they had nowhere else to 
go. Since 1981, NEWS has grown into an or-
ganization that serves over 1,300 Women, 
Men, Children, and LGBTQ+ folx annually. 
The critical services NEWS provides to the 
Napa community include a 24-hour domestic 
violence and sexual abuse help line, referral 
services for domestic violence and sexual 
abuse survivors, and food, clothing, transpor-
tation, and medical support. Additionally, the 
NEWS shelter provides private bedrooms, pri-
vate bathrooms, a family room, a full kitchen, 
and spacious areas for children to play for up 
to 20 community members at a time. Further, 
the NEWS court advocates assist survivors in 
filing protective orders, and NEWS case man-
agers work with clients to find safe and afford-
able housing. 
NEWS is an active member of several local, 
state, and national organizations that advocate 
for and promote domestic violence and sexual 
abuse prevention. These organizations include 
the California Partnership to End Domestic Vi-
olence, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, 
the Community Leaders Coalition, the Napa 
County Continuum of Care, the Napa County 
Behavioral Health Committee, the Napa Valley 
Communities Organized Against Disaster, and 
more. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
NEWS’ contributions to our community have 
made Napa County a safer place for survivors 
of domestic violence and sexual abuse. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor it 
here today.

RECOGNIZING 
JOHN 
BASALYGA, 
ITALIAN AMERICAN MAN OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor John Basalyga who will be rec-
ognized as the Italian American Man of the 
Year by the Columbus Day Association of 
Lackawanna County at their annual gathering 
on Sunday, October 10, 2021. 
John was raised in the Pocono Mountains of 
Pennsylvania. When he began his career in 
2001, he knew he wanted to maintain the 
deep connection he felt to his home region by 
creating jobs and supporting the local econ-
omy. He founded Eastern Roofing Systems in 
Jessup, Pennsylvania, which began as a small 
local business and eventually grew into one of 
the largest commercial and industrial roofing 
contractors in the country, known for a com-
mitment to quality and innovation. 
In 2006, John founded JBAS Realty and 
began turning industrial properties into hous-
ing, transforming spaces from the region’s 
manufacturing past into modern accommoda-
tions. The Lofts at 300 Bowman in Dickson 
City, the Railroad Lofts in Moscow, the Ware-
house Lofts in Scranton, and the North Valley 
Lofts in Olyphant are a testament to John’s ar-
chitectural and design vision and his commit-
ment to providing housing in Lackawanna 
County. His company also takes on commer-
cial properties. In 2015, John acquired the 
Mall at Steamtown, which he transformed into 
the Marketplace at Steamtown: a modern, 
mixed-use facility that attracts tourists and 
locals to downtown Scranton. Other properties 
that have benefitted from John’s talent and ex-
pertise include Crunch Fitness; the Olde Brook 
Inn, a popular fine dining restaurant; Geisinger 
Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine, set to 
open later this year; and the Rock Creek Cor-
porate Center and the Rock Creek Shops. 
John is always working on new and innova-
tive ventures that improve the landscape of 
our community. He recently founded Serenity 
Care, LLC, which will own and operate five 
senior care centers in Lackawanna and 
Luzerne Counties. In his most ambitious move 
yet, he plans to demolish the Red Carpet Inn 
to construct the City of Scranton’s tallest build-
ing, which will feature retail establishments, a 
restaurant, a hotel, office space, and residen-
tial units. 
His success in commercial roofing led John 
to expand his business to include independent 
service and residential departments in 2019. 
Eastern Residential Solutions won an Angie’s 
List Super Service Award in 2020 and is inte-
gral to John’s charitable work. The company 
recently provided a new roof for a local vet-
eran through the Beacon of Hope Project in 
2020, and in 2021, they donated the labor and 
materials to replace all the roofs at South 
Scranton Little League. 
I am honored to join with the Columbus Day 
Association of Lackawanna County in recog-
nizing John as the Italian American Man of the 
Year. John’s hard work, dedication, and vision 
have transformed the City of Scranton, and I 
wish him all the best as he continues to help 
our beloved city reach new heights.

RECOGNIZING JESSICA NEUWIRTH 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, 
Jessica Neuwirth, for her longstanding com-
mitment to women’s rights and her work 
against human trafficking around the world. 
As one of America’s preeminent lawyers 
and activists on women’s rights and a grad-
uate of Harvard Law School, Jessica has 
worked extensively in the international wom-
en’s rights movement with the United Nations, 
in international criminal courts, and within the 
larger global women’s movement. She served 
as Special Advisor on Sexual Violence to the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, 
drafting the sections on sexual violence of the 
historic Akayesu judgement in 1998, which de-
fined rape for the first time in international law 
and found sexual violence to constitute a form 
of genocide. 
Jessica continued her important work in the 
international sphere, helping to organize a 
global Afghan Women’s Summit just three 
months after 9/11 in December 2001, and a 
Beijing +10 campaign on laws which discrimi-
nate against women, resulting in the creation 
by the Human Rights Council of a UN Working 
Group on Discrimination Against Women in 
Law and Practice. She played a key role in 
the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act in 2000, as well as the international 
Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, adopted by the 
United Nations in 2000. Jessica has also 
served as Special Advisor on Sexual Violence 
to the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, where she continued to highlight the 
gruesome use of rape as a weapon in armed 
conflicts around the world. Today, as the Rita 
E. Hauser Director of the Human Rights Pro-
gram at the Roosevelt House Public Policy In-
stitute at Hunter College, Jessica serves as an 
incubator for the Global Reparations Fund for 
Victims of Sexual Violence launched last year 
at the United Nations. 
It is therefore no surprise that Jessica was 
honored this past week with the insignia of 
Knight of the French Legion of Honour. This is 
the highest award that a citizen or noncitizen 
of France can receive, and speaks volumes 
about the strong devotion, and enduring drive 
for justice that has characterized Jessica for 
her entire life.

her over the years, including the National Or-
ganization for Women’s Susan B. Anthony

RECOGNIZING 
OCTOBER 
AS 
NA-
TIONAL SPINE HEALTH AWARE-
NESS MONTH 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask that my colleagues join me in 
recognizing October as National Spine Health 
Awareness Month. 
In 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans 
suffered from chronic neck or back pain ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Those numbers increased to near-
ly 45 percent in adults with income below the 
federal poverty level. Back pain is also the 
number one cause of missed workdays and 
the leading cause of job-related disability and 
pain. In fact, it costs $250 billion to the U.S. 
economy annually. 
Unfortunately, during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, many of us have been sitting more, 
eating more, and moving less: all of which 
have exacerbated spinal problems. 
The National Spine Health Foundation 
(NSHF) located in my district in Reston, Vir-
ginia, is the only patient-centered non-profit 
dedicated to helping patients overcome debili-
tating spinal conditions. The Foundation is es-
pecially dedicated to helping prevent abuse of 
opioids used for pain. Back pain is the most 
common non-cancer related reason for an 
opioid prescription. Decreased opioid use also 
reduces the risk of future opioid dependency. 
I would like to congratulate NSHF on receiv-
ing the International Society for the Advance-
ment of Spine Surgery’s award in 2021 for its 
research on the hospital protocol called En-
hanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS). The 
ERAS for back and neck surgeries has re-
sulted in a greater than 50 percent reduction 
in postoperative opioid consumption and pain 
scores. 
In addition, NSHF’s Medical and Scientific 
Board includes fifty of the top spine specialists 
in the nation. Through patient education, 
award-winning research, and advocacy, NSHF 
partners with these top spine specialists to 
provide patients with the tools to make in-
formed decisions by providing information on 
prevention, nonsurgical and surgical treat-

CELEBRATING 
THE 
132ND 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF ST. JAMES A.M.E. 
CHURCH 
OF 
DOUGLASVILLE, 
GEORGIA 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 132nd 
anniversary of the St. James African Methodist 
Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church of Douglasville, 
Georgia on October 10, 2021. 
Since its founding in 1889, St. James 
A.M.E. 
Church 
has 
served 
the 
greater 
Douglasville area through ministry, service, 
and fellowship. As they mark this momentous 
occasion, it is my pleasure to extend congratu-
lations to the church leaders, elders, and con-
gregation. There are many ways to gauge the 
impact a religious institution has on its com-
munity. However, one of the most telling is its 
longevity, for that demonstrates that teaching 
of a loving gospel can move generations of 
God’s people. 
The mission of St. James A.M.E. is to min-
ister to the spiritual, physical, emotional, and 
environmental needs of all people through 
spreading the word of Christ. However, this 
church community does not just preach the 
gospel on Sundays, but instead carries the 
gospel with them every day through their good 
deeds. Saving the lost, serving the needy, 
feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, hous-
ing the homeless, caring for the sick, are only 
a few examples of how St. James A.M.E. im-
pacts its community. 
St. James A.M.E. has been a beacon of 
Christian light and fellowship for a very long 
time. They take care of their community and 
those that are struggling. Loving our neighbors 
as we love ourselves is deeply engrained in 
St. James A.M.E.’s culture. Through the spirit 
of selfless generosity and love for others, God 
has shined his light on this congregation, and 
you all have taken that light and steadfastly 
turned it on your community. For fifteen years, 
St. James A.M.E. has partnered with the At-
lanta Community Food Bank to serve meals 
and provide goods to fellow neighbors. During 
the COVID–19 pandemic, the church set up a 
mobile food bank and food pantry for patrons 
to easily get meals for their families. Addition-
ally, St. James A.M.E. organized a COVID–19 
vaccination event to ensure that citizens of the 
greater Douglasville area had access to this 
lifesaving vaccine. 
Throughout the 132 years of St. James 
A.M.E., its members and fellow Black and Afri-
can American neighbors were not afforded the 
same freedoms as their white brothers and 
sisters. This church has lived through the 
great Civil Rights Movement and the contin-
ued effects of racism and bigotry. Through 
their perseverance, they have continued to 
promote equality in their community, through 
actions such as working tirelessly during the 
2020 election cycle to ensure voters were reg-
istered and had all the information they need-
ed to cast their ballot on election day. 
I am pleased to congratulate your church 
leaders, elders, and the generations of 
congregants at St. James A.M.E. Church for 
setting positive examples as leaders in min-
istry for the city of Douglasville. From the first 
pastors back in 1889, Reverend Pierce and 
Reverend Lawrence, to today’s Reverend 
LeRoy Ladson, Jr., these leaders have 
grounded this community’s faith and united the 
people of Douglasville through the Word of 
God. 
Madam Speaker, as St. James A.M.E. 
Church of Douglasville, Georgia marks its 
132nd anniversary, I would like to applaud this 
church’s steadfast commitment to God’s Word 
and God’s people. I want to close with a fitting 
scripture that epitomizes the spirit of St. 
James A.M.E., Galatians 6:9, which reads, 
‘‘And let us not grow weary of doing good, for 
in due season we will reap, if we do not give 
up.’’ 
May God continue to bless St. James 
A.M.E. Church of Douglasville, Georgia.

HONORING THE GOVERNMENT 
SERVICE OF DAVID GOOTNICK 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and thank GAO Director 
David Gootnick for his 27 years of federal 
service, including 20 years at the Government 
Accountability Office. His leadership on 50 re-
ports and testimonies covering the territories 
and freely associated states has been a crit-
ical source of information and insight for the 
Natural Resources Committee. In particular, I 
want to highlight David’s five reviews of the 
implementation of minimum wage increases in 
American Samoa—beginning in 2010 and last 
reporting in 2020. These reports provided vital 
information that helped Congress monitor eco-
nomic conditions in the territory and take ap-
propriate actions to revise the schedule of 
America Samoa minimum wage increases. I 
thank David for his service, and congratulate 
him on his retirement. Best wishes to him on 
his future activities.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CORPORAL BURL MULLINS 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Corporal Burl Mullins, who 
served in the United States Army during World 
War II and the Korean War and spent his life 
in service to our country. I want to extend my 
sincerest gratitude to Cpl. Mullins and his fam-
ily for his courage and bravery, as his dedi-
cated service cost him the ultimate price. 
Corporal Mullins was born in Kentucky on 
December 19, 1926 and began serving in 
World War II on March 23, 1945. He contin-
ued to serve through the post-war period for 
one year and nine months. Remarkably, less 
than two years later, Cpl. Mullins enlisted for 
a second term of service on September 2, 
1948 to serve in the Korean War. 
At only twenty-three years old, Cpl. Mullins 
was reported Missing in Action on November 
30, 1950 after enemy forces attacked his unit 
in the Chasin Reservoir, North Korea. While 
his remains originally couldn’t be found, they 
were later recovered at the location of the bat-
tle where he went missing. It was determined 
that he was likely killed in action. 
In June 2018, after nearly 70 years MIA, 
U.S. President Donald Trump and D.P.R.K. 
Chairman Kim Jong-Un conducted a summit 
meeting in Singapore where Chairman Kim 
promised to repatriate American remains col-
lected by the D.P.R.K. during the Korean War. 
A month later, Cpl. Mullins’ remains were re-
turned home to the U.S. where he was re-
united with his family. His family, who were 
unsure if they would ever know what hap-
pened to him, were glad to have closure and 
described it as a ‘‘wound finally healed.’’ 
Cpl. Mullins’ return home was celebrated by 
the small Kentucky community where he grew 
up. His casket was escorted by a veterans 
motorcycle group, and his funeral precession 
was met with community support, as some 
members of the community gathered to wave 
their American flags and pay their respects. 
The family is grateful to President Trump for 
the return of their loved one. 
Madam Speaker, Corporal Burl Mullins was 
a courageous patriot who gave his life in serv-
ice to our country. I am proud to honor him 
and his family.

HONORING HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. Each year 
from September 15 to October 15, the history 
and culture of Americans whose ancestry can 
be traced from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, 
and Central and South America is recognized 
and celebrated. This observation was first es-
tablished as Hispanic Heritage Week under 
President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. President 
Ronald Reagan later expanded the observ-
ance to a full month in 1988. This thirty-day 
period encapsulates many celebrations of 
independence for Latin American countries. 
September 15 is the anniversary of independ-
ence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico and Chile 
also celebrate their independence days on 
September 16 and September 18. 
During this month, we pause to recognize 
the profound influence of Hispanic Americans 
across the country. Guided by the promise of 
freedom and in search of a better life for 
themselves and their families, some of these 
individuals arrived with nothing but the clothes 
on their back and the hope of a better tomor-
row. Once here, they charted their course, and 
created their own unique American destinies. 
In turn, their contributions have brought new 
ideas, new cuisines, new cultures to us all, 
and their presence here has created a more 
prosperous nation for all Americans. Hispanic 
Americans have had influence on practically 
every part of American history, from sports, to 
the fine arts, to science. Each day I am proud 
of their countless contributions to our country’s 
story, and I would like to take this month to 
honor the crucial role that Hispanic Americans 
play in our society, and in Georgia’s Sixth 
Congressional District in particular. 
The Hispanic community in Georgia is 
proud, vibrant, and ever-growing. I am proud 
to represent so many of the men and women 
who have contributed so much to our commu-
nities each day—over half of Georgia’s His-
panic population lives within the metropolitan 
Atlanta area. Hispanic Americans help con-
tribute to what makes this Nation remarkable, 
and I am honored to lift up the voices of those 
who have selflessly dedicated their lives to 
building up themselves, their community, and 
this country. Over the course of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Hispanic Americans from all 
walks of life demonstrated their commitment to 
community and selfless service in their daily 
lives. Doctors saved lives, essential frontline 
workers kept grocery stores and pharmacies 
operational, and trusted community leaders 
continue to encourage their friends and neigh-
bors to get vaccinated. I am routinely im-
pressed by the spirit of service and leadership 
displayed by Hispanic Americans in my district 
who work hard to give back to their own com-
munities. Their work should be recognized 
every day, but particularly during Hispanic 
Heritage Month. Therefore, I am honored to 
highlight two individuals who deserve special 
recognition: Natalia Garzo´n and Zulma Lopez. 
Natalia Garzo´n was born in Colombia but 
raised in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama. 
Her passion for diversity and connectivity is 
what led her to pursue a career in Literature, 
Creative Writing, and French. Prior to her work 
in Atlanta, Natalia worked with nonprofits in 
Central America. She is a founder of RISE, a 
nonprofit that seeks to empower students in 
low-income neighborhoods in Panama. In At-
lanta, she has worked as a Teacher’s Assist-
ant at Montclair Elementary, an ESL Associate 
Tutor for Tibetan monks and nuns, and she 
has established a partnership between the 
LAA ’s Club de Lectura and the Fox Center for 
Humanistic Inquiry at her alma mater Emory 
University. In September of 2020, Natalia was 
named the director of development for We 
Love BuHi, an organization that works to pre-
serve the multicultural identity of Atlanta’s 
Buford Highway. During the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Natalia and We Love BuHi pivoted 
their focus to providing the people of the 
Buford Highway Corridor with locally sourced 
and culturally centric food to families that were 
in need. Their efforts fed over 52,000 people, 
and impacted nearly 15,000 families. Once 
COVID–19 vaccinations were made available, 
Natalia was an instrumental part of We Love 
BuHi’s multilingual vaccination outreach ef-
forts, which partnered with other local organi-
zations and the cities of Doraville and 
Dunwoody to train volunteers and run multi-
lingual vaccination clinics. 
Zulma Lopez identifies herself as an immi-
gration attorney, a small business owner, and 
most importantly, a mom. She was born and 
raised in Puerto Rico, where she obtained her 
undergraduate degree and J.D. from the Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico. During law school, 
Zulma also juggled the responsibilities of 
being a mom to her two oldest sons. In 2007, 
she moved to Georgia to reunite with her 
childhood friend and now husband Dax Lopez, 
and gave birth to a daughter and son to com-
plete her family. In 2014, she opened her own 
law practice, Lopez Immigration LLC, to give 
families their own shot at the American dream 
by representing them before United States 
Citizenship and Immigration Services and filing 
family-based immigration petitions. As both an 
immigration attorney and a small business 
owner, she is passionate about creating op-
portunities for women and minority business 
owners in DeKalb County. As a mother who 
balanced her own professional development 
and education while raising her sons, she 
feels strongly about supporting students from 
preschool through college. In 2020, Zulma 
was elected to represent House District 86 in 
the Georgia House of Representatives, where 
she serves as the only Latina in the Georgia 
General Assembly. As an elected official in 
North DeKalb County, Zulma represents some 
of the same constituents that I have the privi-
lege of representing here in Congress. I am 
proud of our shared constituency. 
It is my distinct honor and privilege to recog-
nize two of the many Hispanic Americans who 
work hard every day to make a difference in

uals and the many others whose stories have

JUSTIN ANDRADE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Justin Andrade for receiv-
ing the Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s 
Image Award. 
Justin is known as a selfless and inspira-
tional young man who grew up in Arvada. He 
became a local hero after running 280 miles 
from Adams State University in Alamosa, 
Colo. back home to Arvada in honor of his 
childhood friend, Cameron Holland, and to 
raise funds for the Cameron Holland Scholar-
ship. 
Justin’s courageous, ultra-marathon-like ef-
forts demonstrated his commitment and lead-
ership abilities and I wish him all the best in 
the future. Congratulations to him on receiving 
this award and I look forward to his future ac-
complishments.

RECOGNIZING THE INTERNET AR-
CHIVE 
FOR 
CELEBRATING 
ITS 
25TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker. I rise to 
honor the Internet Archive on the 25th anni-
versary of its founding in 1996. The organiza-
tion has developed an extraordinary and high-
ly accessible digital library and has become an 
indispensable asset to society. 
While physical records of books, news-
papers, videos, and audio have long been 
conserved by libraries and archives, no such 
record keeping existed for the internet in its in-
fancy. Aware of the importance of saving dig-
ital documents, the Internet Archive was 
founded with the mission to conserve digital 
cultural artifacts for the public and for genera-
tions to come. That mission is vital in an age 
where the internet plays such a central role in 
all of our lives. 
To date, the Archive has stored an aston-
ishing 588 billion web pages, 28 million 
digitized books and texts, 14 million audio re-
cordings, 6 million videos, 3.5 million images, 
and 580,000 software programs. Millions of 
people around the world contribute to the Ar-
chive and countless more benefit from having 
access to it. The world-class team of employ-
ees and volunteers that administer the Internet 
Archive are a major reason why the project 
has been such a success, and I’m proud that 
many of my constituents contribute to the Ar-
chive. 
The Internet Archive’s success is also due 
to the fact that it is managed as a values-driv-
en nonprofit organization. The Archive is a 
large part of how we will tell the story of our 
time and it’s a privilege to congratulate the 
Internet Archive on celebrating 25 years of 
cataloging the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in congratulating 
all of the employees, volunteers, and users of 
the Internet Archive for celebrating its 25th an-
niversary.

CELEBRATING HOWARD E. 
ROBINSON, SR.’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life and accomplishments of 
Howard E. Robinson, Sr., a constituent of Vir-
ginia’s 4th Congressional District. In February, 
Mr. Robinson will reach the milestone birthday 
of turning 100 years old. 
Howard E. Robinson, Sr., was born on Feb-
ruary 1, 1922 in Chase City, in Mecklenburg 
County, Virginia, to Robert and Mary Robin-
son. Mary a domestic worker, and Robert, a 
janitor, both believed in education to provide 
ladders of economic mobility for their children. 
Mr. Robinson attended the Thyne Institute, 
which was established by the United Pres-
byterian Church and dedicated to educating 
Black children. Thyne Institute was the only 
school in Mecklenburg County for children of 
color to attend for almost 50 years, and due 
to the abhorrent policies of the Jim Crow 
South, Mr. Robinson was unable to attend an 
integrated school. 
From a young age Howard understood the 
principles and ideas of hard work. To pay for 
his education at the Thyne Institute he cut 
grass for the school and drove the principal 
and his daughter into Chase City to shop. 
Howard would graduate from the Thyne In-
stitute as valedictorian, and go on to study at 
Virginia State College, now known as Virginia 
State University (VSU), on a full scholarship. 
While in college Mr. Robinson met Anna 
Smith, who he would marry in 1951. Mr. Rob-
inson graduated from Virginia State College 
with a degree in biology. 
Upon graduation from Virginia State Col-
lege, Howard returned to the Thyne Institute to 
teach geography and English. In 1942 as 
World War II raged on, Howard was drafted 
into the United States Army where he served 
as a clerk and chauffer for a Captain at Fort 
Sill, Oklahoma. Howard was honorably dis-
charged after more than two years of service. 
Following his service, Howard and Anna 
built a home in Chase City and became active 
in their community. Howard returned once 
again to the Thyne Institute, where he would 
teach biology, chemistry, and general science 
at the middle and high school levels for fifteen 
years. Howard went on to teach and serve as 
a guidance counselor in Mecklenburg County 
Public Schools at East End High School for 35 
years. 
Howard continued to pursue his own edu-
cation throughout his career. At the request of 
the Principal and Superintendent, Howard pur-
sued graduate level coursework from the 
George Washington University, Virginia State 
College, and obtained a master’s degree in 
Guidance from the Hampton Institute, in 1962. 
After spending his career in education, he 
retired in 1987. 
Howard has dedicated his life to service. In 
total, he taught for fifty years. It is estimated 
that he educated, counseled, and inspired 
more than 10,000 students during his career. 
He also has provided civic, church, and aca-
demic leadership in the Southside community. 
Howard has lived a life of purpose, integrity, 
and love. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in wishing Howard E. Robinson, Sr., a 
happy 100th birthday.

Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joe Hengstler for receiving 
the Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Young 
Professional Award. 
The Young Professional Award is given to 
an up-and-coming Arvada community member 
who has stood out for their work over the past 
year. As Executive Director at the Olde Town 
Arvada Business Improvement District, Joe 
has proven to be a steady force during the 
pandemic, tirelessly working to support Olde 
Town businesses and the Arvada community 
as a whole. Joe led the organization during a 
pivotal time and developed new and creative 
ways to aid businesses during a difficult time. 
Joe also volunteers his time with the Arvada 
Festivals Commission and helps lead the Ar-
vada on Tap Festival. 
Having worked with Joe personally, I want 
to extend my appreciation for his leadership 
and contribution to our community and wish 
him all the best in his future endeavors. Con-
gratulations to him on receiving the Arvada

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN EDWARDO 
SANTIAGO 
HON. RITCHIE TORRES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to pay tribute to Captain 
Edwardo Santiago, who is retiring after 32 
years of service at the Lincoln Hospital Police 
Division in the heart of my district. As a public 
hospital with the busiest Emergency Depart-
ment in New York City and the third-busiest 
Emergency Department in the nation, Lincoln 
is an indispensable medical facility for my con-
stituents. 
On the Occasion of the Retirement of Cap-
tain Edwardo Santiago, we honor him for his 
dedication and selflessness in service to the 
Bronx community. We hereby recognize and 
acknowledge his numerous achievements by 
sharing some of his professional achieve-
ments and contributions: 
Captain Santiago’s distinguished and honor-
able career began in 1985 when he served in 
the United States Marine Corps as a 0341 
Mortarman. He received numerous com-
mendations for his outstanding service, includ-
ing the Navy Achievement Medal, Good Con-
duct Medal, and Meritorious Mast until his 
Honorable Discharge as an E4 - Corporal in 
1989. 
Following his Honorable Discharge, Captain 
Santiago returned to the Bronx and began 
working at Lincoln Hospital, where he would 
spend the remainder of his career. Captain 
Santiago served as a Hospital Police Officer 
for four years protecting Lincoln Hospital’s pa-
tients, personnel, and visitors until he was pro-
moted to Investigator, where he served as a 
Crime Prevention Officer. 
Captain Santiago’s exceptional service was 
reflected through his subsequent promotions 
to Detective, Sergeant, and Lieutenant until he 
became Captain in 2003, a position he has 
held ever since. As Captain, he has ensured 
the safety and security of the Hospital through 
a wide array of duties. Captain Santiago 
oversaw numerous programs and initiatives in 
the Hospital Police Department, served as a 
Preventing and Managing Crisis Situation In-
structor for New York City Health and Hos-
pitals, and maintained the proper level of dis-
cipline and duty for all subordinates. Captain 
Santiago has been an exemplary public serv-
ant in every role he has held, and he is ad-
mired by his many colleagues and friends for 
his selflessness and work ethic. 
On the occasion of his retirement from the 
Lincoln Hospital Police Division, I am honored 
to pay tribute to Captain Santiago for his nu-
merous achievements in service to the people 
of the South Bronx. We proudly recognize 
Captain Santiago for the tenacity, camara-
derie, 
and 
dedication 
he 
has 
exhibited 
throughout the last 35 years. I join the Lincoln 
Hospital community in wishing him the best as 
he moves on to the next chapter in his life.

CONGRATULATING THE REPUBLIC 
OF CHINA ON THEIR NATIONAL 
DAY 
HON. MICHELLE FISCHBACH 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I send 
my congratulations to the Republic of China 
on the upcoming October 10th celebration of 
Taiwan’s National Day. 
Taiwan’s democratic model of government 
serves as a role model to other nations. The 
people of Taiwan’s dedication to elections that 
are open, free, and fair shows their commit-
ment to freedom. The United States and Tai-
wan share a strong bond over our mutual 
commitment to the personal freedom for our 
citizens and for the citizens of the world. 
The United States and Taiwan have shared 
a trade partnership with each other that brings 
benefit to both nations. I am proud that in 
2018. Taiwan made a deal with the United 
States to buy $1.5 billion in soybeans from my 
State of Minnesota and neighboring Iowa. This 
powerful relationship helps to promote the 
prosperity of businesses and citizens both in 
Taiwan and the United States. 
Once again, I wish to express my congratu-
lations on this 110th anniversary of Taiwan’s 
National Day.

HONORING ERIN MURPHEY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and congratulate Erin 
Murphey of Island Heights, New Jersey for 
achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. Erin is the 
first young woman to become an Eagle Scout 
in Ocean County, New Jersey, and among the 
Boy Scouts of America’s inaugural class of fe-
male Eagle Scouts. 
Erin’s passion for Scouting started when 
she first heard her father’s stories about his 
own time as a Boy Scout. Being able to par-
ticipate in the organization’s program was al-
ways something Erin wanted to do; however, 
it wasn’t until February of 2019 when changes 
in membership policies allowed her and thou-
sands of young girls to join. Once she joined 
Troop 570, she committed herself to making 
the most of her time. In addition to going 
camping and learning traditional scout skills, 
Erin worked to expand her council’s high ad-
venture and sailing programs, attended a lead-
ership conference in New Mexico, and was 
elected by her peers into the Order of the 
Arrow, Scouting’s National Honor Society. Erin 
also worked for four summers at the Joseph 
A. Citta Scout Reservation, a local Boy Scout 
camp in New Jersey, starting as a counselor 
and ultimately serving as the Resident Pro-
gram Director. Erin credits her outgoing per-
sonality, comfort with public speaking, and 
leadership to her experiences at camp having 
interacted with thousands of scouts. 
To earn the rank of Eagle Scout, Erin 
worked to complete 41 merit badges that 
ranged in subjects from railroading to engi-
neering to personal finance as well as com-
plete an Eagle Project that benefits the com-
munity. For her project, Erin Jed a team of 20 
volunteers for three days, amounting to 55 vol-
unteer hours, in cleaning and repainting half of 
the stone street signs in her town. 
Anyone involved in Scouts BSA will say that 
achieving the rank of Eagle Scout is not an 
easy process. In 2019, only 8 percent of all 
Scouts BSA earned the Eagle Scout rank. 
When you consider the barriers that Erin and 
other young women had to overcome on top 
of the traditional requirements, achieving this 
award makes this occasion much more his-
toric. Because of pioneers like Erin, the path 
to the Eagle summit will be easier for young 
women in the future who aspire to a similar 
goal. Erin herself said it best, when asked 
what piece of advice she could give to female 
scouts, she said ‘‘enjoy the journey and don’t 
let anything stop you’’. 
Madam Speaker, the example set by this 
young woman and her supportive family dem-
onstrates the rewards of hard work, dedica-
tion, and perseverance. Erin is now a part of 
a select group of women who have earned 
both their Eagle and Gold Award, the highest 
rank in Girl Scouts. I know that I speak for all 
of New Jersey’s Third Congressional District 
when I say congratulations and good luck to 
Erin on her next steps.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
CPL. 
RALPH 
SARRATT 
BOUGHMAN 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life and service of Cpl. 
Ralph Sarratt Boughman. Ralph was born on 
April 19, 1929, and passed away on Decem-
ber 2, 1950. He grew up on the family farm 
one of ten children born to J.Q. and Grace 
Laxton Boughman near Santuc, South Caro-
lina. As a young man he helped with chores 
around the farm. In his spare time, he roamed 
those 180 acres hunting, fishing, and enjoying 
nature. 
On August 10, 1948, he joined the U.S. 
Army. He was 19 years old when he was in-
ducted at Ft. Jackson in Columbia, South 
Carolina and was stationed there from August 
16, 1948, through November 2, 1948, taking 
basic training. Boughman was stationed in 
Japan for around a year and then was trans-
ferred to Korea. 
Boughman was a member of Company B, 
1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 7th In-
fantry Division. During the Korean War he was 
reported missing in action on Dec. 2, 1950, 
when his unit was attacked by enemy forces 
near the Chosin Reservoir, North Korea. Fol-
lowing the battle, his remains could not be re-
covered. He was presumed dead on Dec. 21,

1953. He received the Purple Heart, the Army 
of Occupation Medal with Japan clasp, the Ko-
rean Service Medal with three Bronze Service 
Stars and the Presidential Unit Citation with 
one Gold Star-Navy. 
On July 27, 2018, following the summit be-
tween President Donald Trump and North Ko-
rean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in June 
2018, North Korea turned over 55 boxes, be-
lieved to contain the remains of American 
service members killed during the Korean 
War. The remains arrived at Joint Base Pearl 
Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii on August 1, 2018, 
and were subsequently sent to the DPAA lab-
oratory for identification. Boughman’s remains 
were accounted for on April 20, 2020. His late 
mother’s prayers for the next twenty-five years 
of her life was to ask God to ‘‘bring Ralph 
home with the other boys.’’ Ralph’s sister, 
Pansy Bourne, who turned 90 on September 
29, 2021 continued those prayers until he 
came home. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Cpl. 
Ralph 
Sarratt 
Boughman, faithfully served his country and is 
finally home in his resting place in Union, 
South Carolina as of May 11, 2020. I proudly 
honor his legacy and service.

HONORING CHRISTOPHER J. SMITH 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Christopher J. 
Smith in celebration of his career as a reporter 
and columnist for the Press Democrat over the 
past 44 years. 
Born in Pasadena, California, on May 4, 
1954 to Don and Edythe Smith, Mr. Smith de-
veloped a love of journalism early on in his life 
working as a paperboy. He then became a 
manager for his hometown paper, the River-
side Press Enterprise. Mr. Smith then attained 
his bachelor’s degree in journalism from San 
Jose State University in 1976, where he sup-
ported himself throughout school by working 
for the circulation department of the San Jose 
Mercury News on weekends. Mr. Smith’s dedi-
cation and work ethic did not go unnoticed 
and helped him land a position as a reporter 
and columnist for the Press Democrat, where 
he still works as a freelance writer. Through-
out his career, Mr. Smith has made significant 
contributions to the community through his 
writing and reporting on important community 
members, including centenarians, Pearl Har-
bor veterans, peace activists, and other indi-
viduals who have made a difference in the 
community. Mr. Smith is especially recognized 
for his contributions to the Press Democrat’s 
coverage of the October 2017 wildfires that 
earned the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize. He 
continued to report on the lives of those af-
fected by the fires for the next two years. ‘‘The 
surprise, VIP guests at the reborn Paradise 
Ridge Winery,’’ and ‘‘Family of Angel the cow 
still struggling to rebuild, return to ranch nearly 
two years after Tubbs fire’’ are some of his 
notable articles. 
In addition to his illustrious career, Mr. 
Smith has taken on many philanthropic 
projects within his community. He serves on 
the board of the Bridge to the Future, a com-
munity program that works with underprivi-
leged youth ages 14 to 18 to sharpen their life 
skills and prepare them for the future. Mr. 
Smith was a member of the Exchange Club, 
a service organization that aids many local 
communities and counties in the United 
States. Further, he volunteers for Dining Out 
for Life, an annual fundraising event that 
raises money for community-based organiza-
tions that serve people living with or impacted 
by HIV. He also assists in coordinating the an-
nual awards dinner given by the Boy Scouts of 
America every year. Mr. Smith is described by 
his family and community as generous, coura-
geous, and resilient. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. Smith 
has worked tirelessly for the betterment of the 
Santa Rosa community through both his re-
porting and volunteer work. Therefore, it is fit-
ting and proper that we honor him here today.

CELEBRATING 
HISPANIC 
HERIT-
AGE MONTH AND HONORING OR-
LANDO ROLO´ N 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Hispanic 
Heritage Month, I am paying tribute to Florid-
ians who have made outstanding contributions 
to our community and our country. 
Today I rise to honor the Chief of Police for 
the City of Orlando, Orlando Rolo´n. 
Orlando, who was born in Puerto Rico, 
moved to Central Florida with his family in 
1977. 
In 1982, Orlando enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps Reserve and served for 
four years. Following his military service, Or-
lando continued to build a life in Central Flor-
ida and worked in construction. 
Orlando joined the Orlando Police Depart-
ment in 1992. His commitment to fostering ef-
fective communication with the Spanish- 
speaking residents of Orlando led him to be-
come the first Hispanic spokesperson in the 
history of OPD. Orlando has used his exten-
sive experience and leadership abilities to 
bring people together, from traveling to Puerto 
Rico to assist with hurricane recovery efforts 
to providing crucial briefings in Spanish to the 
friends and families of victims of the Pulse 
nightclub shooting. 
In 2018, Mayor Buddy Dyer appointed Or-
lando to become the Orlando Police Depart-
ment’s 39th Chief of Police. Chief Rolo´n is the 
first person of Hispanic heritage ever to hold 
this position. 
As Chief and throughout his nearly 30 years 
of service to the Department, Orlando has 
dedicated himself to improving trust and effec-
tive communication between law enforcement 
and our community. He has a servant’s heart 
and the City of Orlando is safer and stronger 
because of him. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Chief Orlando Rolo´n.

CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF 
BIVOUAC 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Biv-
ouac, a family-owned small business located 
on bustling State Street in Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan. Their 50 years spent outfitting the lives of 
those in our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Founded in 1970 by Mr. Ed Davidson while 
he was a student at the University of Iowa, he 
set up shop on Williams Street in Ann Arbor 
in 1971. It started off as an army surplus store 
catering to anti-war activists, but after the 
move to their current location on South State 
Street, the store has become an Ann Arbor 
mainstay for clothing and outdoor gear. With 
their expansive storefront in the historic Nick-
els Arcade, Bivouac is a familiar shopping 
destination for many University of Michigan 
students and the locals who call Ann Arbor 
home. 
Bivouac goes beyond just making sales by 
contributing to causes with local impact and 
lending a hand to their neighbors. For their 
50th anniversary, they are donating ten per-
cent of their sales to the Huron River Water-
shed Council. They’ve also held charity shop-
ping events for organizations such as Ozone 
House, a shelter for homeless youth based in 
Ypsilanti. 
For years, Bivouac has outfitted hundreds. 
Former customers—now parents—bring their 
children back to the store when they begin 
school at the University of Michigan to get the 
coats and layers needed to survive a chilly 
Michigan winter. What started off as an idea of 
a University of Iowa senior has grown into an 
Ann Arbor icon and now since the partial re-
tirement of Mr. Davidson, his son AJ Davidson 
now serves as President of the store and han-
dles day-to-day operations.

UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO LEGAL 
CLINICS—MARKING 50 YEARS OF 
SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
HON. SARA JACOBS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the occasion of the 50th an-
niversary of the University of San Diego 
School of Law’s free legal clinics. 
Over the past half-century, the University of 
San Diego (USD) School of Law’s free legal 
clinics have offered assistance to underserved 
members of society while providing opportuni-
ties for law students to learn first-hand from 
highly skilled attorneys and interact directly 
with actual clients. These pro bono services to 
the San Diego community have provided di-
rect client legal services to thousands of San 
Diego residents in need. 
USD School of Law’s free legal clinics have 
developed a model program in the experiential 
training of law students in the practical appli-
cation of their legal knowledge. This program 
has emphasized the principled practice of law, 
instilling in students the importance of just, 
ethical, and exemplary legal practice. 
In recent years, USD School of Law’s free 
legal clinics have expanded to distinct direct 
client services clinics. 
The Appellate Clinic provides students the 
opportunity to litigate an appeal in the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. This is a year-long 
clinic in which teams of students will handle 
appeals from start to finish. 
The Civil Clinic assists in supplemental So-
cial Security Income and Social Security dis-
ability, uninsured motorist defense and con-
sumer issues. 
Education and Disability Clinic represents 
clients at meetings with school district per-
sonnel and Regional Center Staff. Matters in-
clude school discipline (suspensions and ex-
pulsions), special education placement and 
services, Regional Center and Early Start 
services, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act. 
The Entrepreneurship Clinic provides com-
prehensive legal assistance to individuals who 
wish to start or expand a small business or 
not-for-profit organization, as well as for trade-
mark and copyright issues. 
Federal Income Tax Clinic represents tax-
payers who have disputes with the Internal 
Revenue Service in matters such as collection 
actions or audits, earned income tax credits 
and offers in compromise. 
The Immigration Clinic offers assistance for 
immigration-related problems such as asylum, 
immigrating family members, naturalization 
and deportation. 
California State Income Tax Clinic rep-
resents low-income taxpayers who have dis-
putes with the Franchise Tax Board in matters 
of state tax appeals. 
California State Sales and Use Tax Clinic is 
a joint effort between USD Legal Clinics and 
the California State Board of Equalization. 
Under the supervision of an attorney from the 
California State Board of Equalization’s Tax-
payers’ Rights Advocate Office, students will 
represent clients with Sales and Use Tax ap-
peals before the Board of Equalization. 
Veterans Clinic provides free legal assist-
ance to veterans in disputes with for-profit in-
stitutions over the use of GI Bill funds and 
predatory lending associated with education 
loans. Legal services range from advice to 
identification of potential claims to representa-
tion of student veterans in litigation, arbitration 
and other forms of alternative dispute resolu-
tion. 
Women’s Legal Clinic will meet the legal 
needs of women, men, and families who are 
the victims of human trafficking and others by 
helping with domestic violence restraining or-
ders, child custody and guardianship matters, 
and dissolution cases. 
Workers’ Rights Clinic assists lower-income 
workers with a variety of employment law 
issues including employee rights, discrimina-
tion, medical leave, workplace safety, unpaid 
wages, unemployment benefits, harassment 
and wrongful termination. 
USD School of Law’s free legal clinics have 
provided tens of millions of dollars of free legal 
services to low income and underserved resi-
dents in San Diego County. 
USD School of Law’s free legal clinics have 
trained many of San Diego’s finest attorneys, 
who themselves have added to the reputation 
of the San Diego legal community. 
Madam Speaker, for 50 years USD School 
of Law’s legal clinics have made a tremen-
dous difference in the lives of San Diego resi-
dents. The next 50 years promise to see out-
standing benefits by continuing this fine tradi-
tion.

HONORING STEVEN SPURRIER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Steven Spurrier 
for his monumental contributions to the Cali-
fornia wine community. 
Born on October 5, 1941 in Cambridge, 
England, Mr. Spurrier was raised by his loving 
parents, John and Pamela Spurrier. After re-
ceiving his secondary education at Rugby 
School, Mr. Spurrier went on to attend the 
London School of Economics. He entered the 
wine industry soon after he completed his 
education in 1964, becoming a trainee with 
the oldest wine merchant in London: Chris-
topher & Co. After concluding his tenure with 
Christopher & Co., Mr. Spurrier moved to 
Paris in 1970 where he bought and operated 
a wine shop, Les Caves la Madeleine, the fol-
lowing year. Mr. Spurrier’s shop quickly be-
came one of the most renowned in the city. 
He then utilized his successes as proprietor to 
establish L’Academie du Vin in 1973, France’s 
first private wine school that formed the step-
pingstones for modern wine education. 
More notably, Mr. Spurrier organized a blind 
wine tasting competition, judged by French 
wine experts, between Californian and French 
wines with his colleague Patricia Gallagher. In 
what came to be known as ‘‘the Judgment of 
Paris,’’ wines from California won, paving the 
way for the global prominence of Napa Valley 
wine. 
During his illustrious career in the wine in-
dustry, Steven received multiple international 
awards for his writing on wine. In 2001, he 
was awarded Le Grand Prix de l’Academie 
Internationale du Vin and the Maestro Award 
in memory of Andre Tchelistcheff, America’s 
most influential post-Prohibition winemaker. 
His successes did not stop there, as he won 
Decanter Magazine’s man of the year in 2017 
for his devotion to wine appreciation, cultiva-
tion, and production. He was a recurrent judge 
for international wine tasting competitions and 
governed as chairman of the Japan Wine 
Challenge and the Decanter World Wine 
Awards. After a life devoted to all aspects of 
wine, Steven passed away in March 2021, liv-
ing on through his wife Bella, and his two chil-
dren, Christian and Kate. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Steven 
Spurrier has made a lasting impact on Napa 
Valley’s renowned viticulture through his life-
long devotion to wine and community. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

ACKNOWLEDGING 
THE 
IMPOR-
TANCE OF FUNDING FOR THE 
WEATHERIZATION 
ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAM 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. McKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
acknowledge the importance of robust funding 
for the Weatherization Assistance Program in 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The purpose 
of this program is to prepare the buildings that 
low-income Americans live in for the require-
ments of the 21st century. 
The current limitations to the formula that 
provide funding for this program, however, will 
not cover the costs of ensuring that homes are 
cool enough in the hot weather, warm enough 
in the cold weather, or dry enough in any sea-
son. The formula for calculating the value of 
investments in homes must reflect the ex-
pected impact on the safety of participants 
and their homes under anticipated weather 
conditions, and the impact on their health and 
of adapting their energy system to meet future 
requirements. The current program cost limits 
mean that switching a home to a cleaner fuel 
mix is rarely possible. The same limits impede 
the integration of apprentice workers and other 
trainees into the program. 
Therefore, the Secretary must ensure that 
the regulations for this Program achieve the 
statutory goals of permitting a combination of 
deep retrofit measures sufficient to keep par-
ticipants safe from extreme weather condi-
tions, minimize the greenhouse gas emissions 
from their homes, and ensure health condi-
tions in weatherized homes. 
The Secretary should establish the appro-
priate costs for an average package of retrofits 
that delivers retrofits of sufficient scale to 
produce safe, healthy, and efficient homes 
with the cleanest possible fuel mix, and to ad-
just applicable regulations to support this mis-
sion, particularly by ensuring the costs attrib-
uted to a home are no more than the costs of 
services provided directly to that home.

HONORING 
AMY MERCADO 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Hispanic 
Heritage Month, I am paying tribute to Florid-
ians who have made outstanding contributions 
to our community and our country. 
Today I rise to honor Amy Mercado. 
Amy was born and raised in the Bronx. Her 
mother, Carmen, was a New York City Police 
Officer, while her father, Victor, was a New 
York City Transit Police Detective. Amy and 
her family moved to Central Florida in 1996. 
In 2004, Amy earned her bachelor’s degree 
from American Intercontinental University and 
later earned her Executive MBA from the Jack 
Welch Management Institute at Strayer Uni-
versity. She worked in health care at Florida 
Hospital Orlando, now Advent Health. Amy 
has also served as the Director of Operations 
for a U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty 
Crops Program. Beyond these roles, Amy has 
worked in other diverse industries, including 
management, operations, and legal services. 
In 2016, the people of House District 48 
elected Amy to represent them in the Florida 
House of Representatives. She was subse-
quently re-elected in 2018. In 2020, Amy was 
elected to the office of Orange County Prop-
erty Appraiser and is the first Latina ever to 
serve in this role. 
Amy has continued to positively impact Cen-
tral Florida through her public service and

OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Regional Water Authority and 
congratulate them on their 20th anniversary. 
A reliable water supply is critical to the Sac-
ramento region as it allows our families to 
thrive and our businesses to grow. The Re-
gional Water Authority (RWA) was formed in 
2001 with a focus on addressing the reliability, 
quality, affordability, and availability of our re-
gion’s water supply. RWA is made of up cities, 
water and irrigation districts, mutual water 
companies, investor-owned water utilities and 
community services districts. 
Over its 20 years of work, RWA has played 
a critical role in supporting effective manage-
ment of our region’s water resources. From fa-
cilitating implementation of our region’s con-
junctive use program to reduce diversions 
from the American River during dry water 
years to preparing the American River Basin 
Integrated Regional Water Management Plan, 
RWA has served the Sacramento region well. 
Its work will continue to be critical as we face 
a changing climate and work towards a resil-
ient water supply to support our vibrant econ-
omy. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking 
the Regional Water Authority for their 20 years 
of work on behalf of the greater Sacramento 
region, and I look forward to working with 
them over the next 20 years.

HONORING JUDY SWANSON 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Judy Swanson as she is honored 
by Peninsula Family Service (PFS) with a Life-
time Achievement Award. ‘‘Lifetime’’ has a 
special meaning in the case of this remarkable 
woman whom I’ve been honored to call a dear 
friend for over 35 years. 
Judy is an exceptional community leader 
and philanthropist. She has dedicated her life 
to advancements in science, focusing broadly 
on oncology and science education. She per-
sonifies PFS’s passion for transforming lives in 
San Mateo County. With her leadership, PFS 
successfully offers older residents services to 
keep them healthy and connected to the 
broader community. San Mateo County has a 
great deal of household wealth, but many fam-
ilies struggle. During the COVID emergency, 
PFS offered COVID information to the elderly, 
and continued its longstanding programs offer-
ing senior peer counseling, housing, nutrition 
and transportation assistance. Hundreds of 
children ages 0–5 from the most economically 
vulnerable families were served at early learn-
ing centers. Judy understands that this service 
is essential because 80 percent of brain devel-
opment occurs during these early years. 
As a member of the Hillsborough Auxiliary 
to PFS, Judy has helped dozens of partici-
pants in the organization’s financial literacy 
programs take out small, manageable loans in 
order to meet their annual requirements and to 
build a credit score. Judy is a major bene-
factor and rolls up her sleeves when the auxil-
iary that she leads raises funds to support the 
mission of transforming lives. 
Judy also serves as the CEO and Director 
of the Swanson Foundation and is a regular 
donor to leading research institutes and sci-
entists in the United States. As a board mem-
ber of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research 
Foundation, she helps staff to identify re-
searchers whose fields hold the greatest un-
discovered promise in oncology. The institute 
funds researchers early in their careers and 
helps them thrive through the cycle of early 
discovery to the point where government 
grants begin to flow due to promising findings. 
Judy’s late husband, Bob Swanson, played 
this role for many years and ultimately helped 
co-found, 
and 
was 
the 
first 
CEO 
of, 
Genentech. Judy’s dedication to oncology re-
search is due in no small part to the fact that 
Bob died far too early of brain cancer. In his 
memory, she fights for those for whom cures 
could be around the comer if enough leading- 
edge technology commences. She also sup-
ports oncology research at MIT, Bob’s alma 
mater, and is a member of the President’s Cir-
cle of the National Academies of Science, En-
gineering and Medicine. 
Judy is also a strong supporter of science 
education and the arts, serving on the Tech 
Interactive in San Jose, and the board of the 
San Francisco Ballet. She is a graduate of 
Michigan State University and a lifetime mem-
ber of the International Chapter of Young 
President’s Organization and The Chief Ex-
ecutive’s Organization. 
Madam Speaker, the long recitation of ac-
tivities of Judy Swanson does not describe the 
greatest fact of all: Judy Swanson has an 
enormous heart. She is constantly looking for 
opportunities to advance the quality of peo-
ple’s lives and generously supports programs 
and projects large and small. She deserves 
the appreciation of untold millions who will 
some day benefit through the discoveries she 
funds, the science lessons they learn at The 
Tech in San Jose or their experiences of joy 
through the San Francisco Ballet. We are only 
on Earth for the blink of an eye. However, 
Judy Swanson understands the point made by 
Archimedes when he said, ‘‘Give me a lever 
long enough and a fulcrum on which to place 
it, and I shall move the world.’’ Judy Swanson 
moves the world with each day that she be-
gins anew her life’s work.

RECOGNIZING MALNUTRITION 
AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Malnutrition Awareness 
Week. This week marks the tenth observance 
of Malnutrition Awareness Week, which was 
founded by the American Society for Paren-
teral and Enteral Nutrition in 2012. 
Each year during this week. participating or-
ganizations seek to educate health care pro-
fessionals about early detection and treatment 
of malnutrition, educate consumers on the im-
portance of discussing their nutrition status 
with health care professionals, and increase 
awareness of nutrition’s role in patient recov-
ery. 
Malnutrition is particularly prevalent in vul-
nerable populations, such as hospitalized pa-
tients, older adults, and minority populations. 
For example, one in two older adults is either 
malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. 
Our Nation has financial as well as moral in-
centives to reduce malnutrition. Good nutrition 
can keep people healthy and out of health 
care institutions, thus reducing health care 
costs. Untreated malnutrition can lead to the 
loss of lean body mass, in turn causing com-
plications such as delays in wound healing 
and recovery from surgery, illness, or disease. 
In fact, the current estimated cost for disease- 
associated malnutrition in older adults alone is 
$51.3 billion per year. 
The good news is that common-sense solu-
tions exist that can help reduce the prevalence 
of malnutrition now.

October 8, 2021 
Clinical quality measures have been devel-
oped and tested to help improve nutrition 
screening and intervention and are being im-
plemented by a learning collaborative of over 
300 hospitals nationwide. Recognizing the 
linkages between malnutrition, food insecurity, 
and hunger, the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services should consider adding a mal-
nutrition composite quality measure to its 
Medicare inpatient acute care reporting sys-
tem. 
Additionally, the Departments of Health and 
Human Services and Agriculture should work 
together to develop dietary guidance for the 
prevention and treatment of malnutrition in 
older adults and those with chronic conditions. 
Malnutrition has been exacerbated by the 
global COVID–19 health pandemic that has in-
tensified disparities, inequities, and social iso-
lation and is further compounded by food inse-
curity. The importance of nutrition has been 
recognized by Congress with our passage of 
four different COVID–19 emergency funding 
bills, all of which I was proud to support. 
I commend all those associated with Mal-
nutrition Awareness Week, particularly the 
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral 
Nutrition and the Defeat Malnutrition Today 
coalition. I also commend all those on the 
front lines of providing nutrition services to 
those in need, especially the national network 
of Meals on Wheels programs in our nation. 
Working together, we can stop malnutrition 
in the United States. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to accomplish this goal.

CURTIS FAY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Curtis Fay for receiving the 
Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Rising Star 
Award. 
The Rising Star Award is given to a young 
Arvada resident who has shown the potential 
for great community leadership for years to 
come. Curtis is a student at Arvada High 
School and has a special passion for tech-
nology and has found ways to use technology 
as a way to help fellow students and teachers. 
He even created a new internship position at 
the school focusing on technology assistance. 
He also assisted in overseeing numerous 
events at Arvada High. 
Congratulations to Curtis Fay for receiving 
the Rising Star Award and for his contributions 
to our community. I wish him the best of luck 
in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE CAREER OF BETTY 
JOHNSON 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the remarkable career of Betty 
Thomas Johnson. 
Born on December 18, 1946, Betty was 
adopted by Richard and Rosalie Thomas in 
early 1947. After spending most of her life in 
Cook County, Illinois, Betty and her husband 
David Johnson moved to Springfield, Missouri. 
Once in Springfield, Betty began her advocacy 
work for the Alzheimer’s Association chapter 
in Southwest Missouri. One of Betty’s major 
focuses was organizing annual events. These 
events brought awareness of Alzheimer’s to 
the public and raised money for the organiza-
tion while highlighting people diagnosed with 
Alzheimer’s and their caregivers. Betty helped 
organize six of these annual events during her 
time with the organization. 
On top of this, Betty also advocated on be-
half of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to 
her elected officials. Until her retirement in 
2016, Betty met with me and my staff at least 
three times a year. During these meetings, 
Betty would keep my office updated on new 
and existing programs and sought our contin-
ued support in her efforts. 
Madam Speaker, Betty Johnson has spent 
her career advocating for people diagnosed 
with Alzheimer’s. She has organized events to 
raise awareness and met with elected officials 
in support of her work. I have been honored 
to work with Betty over the last several years 
and am honored to recognize her dedication 
and hard work here today.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN 
ROSENBERG 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to wish John Rosenberg a happy 
90th birthday! The storied life of this Holocaust 
survivor and retired poverty law attorney has 
been filled with remarkable trials and triumphs, 
both figuratively and literally. John is, without 
a doubt, one of the greatest civil rights attor-
neys of our lifetime, especially for the people 
of Kentucky’s Appalachian region. 
Giving us more reason to celebrate, I also 
rise to congratulate John on the 50th anniver-
sary of AppalRed, the Appalachian Research 
and Defense Fund of Kentucky, a non-profit 
law firm that he established to help low-in-
come people in 37 Appalachian counties in 
eastern and south-central Kentucky where 
more than 240,000 people live in poverty. 
Over the last five decades, John and his team 
of pro-bono attorneys, have helped folks in our 
region get and keep basic needs, including: in-
come, adequate food and health care, safe 
and sanitary housing, and personal protection 
from violence and abuse. They do not charge 
for legal services as they fight for justice for 
the most vulnerable people in the mountains. 
John painfully learned the reality of civil in-
justice at a very early age. When he was only 
7 years old, John and his family were pulled 
out of their home in Magdeburg, Germany by 
Nazi soldiers. His father spent 17 days in the 
Buchenwald concentration camp before being 
released with an ultimatum of 30 days to flee 
their homeland. After spending a year in an in-
ternment camp in Holland, the Rosenberg 
family safely boarded one of the last ships to 
the United States with no belongings. 
The determination to survive and experience 
liberty and justice continued throughout his life 
and inspired his mission for civil rights. John 
graduated from Duke University and enlisted 
in the U.S. Air Force. Using the G.I. Bill, he 
later earned a law degree from the University 
of North Carolina in 1962. Before arriving in 
Kentucky, John was a trial attorney and sec-
tion chief in the Civil Rights Division at the 
U.S. Department of Justice. He was respon-
sible for several high-profile cases including 
the first trial under the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 in Selma. He also was heavily involved 
in the investigation and trial preparation for the 
case involving three murdered civil rights 
workers that inspired the 1988 film, Mississippi 
Burning. In Kentucky, his work largely focused 
on advocating for coal miners, fighting for pro-
tections and benefits for impoverished fami-
lies, and closing what he calls the ‘‘justice 
gap’’ in Appalachia. 
His journey from a World War II Nazi Ger-
many Holocaust survivor to an Eastern Ken-
tucky pro-bono civil law hero is astounding. I 
count it a great honor to celebrate John 
Rosenberg’s 90th birthday and the countless 
accomplishments that he has made on behalf 
of so many Americans and Appalachian fami-
lies.

Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Hispanic 
Heritage Month, I am paying tribute to Florid-
ians who have made outstanding contributions 
to our community and our country. 
Today I rise to honor Johanna Lo´pez. 
Johanna was born in Puerto Rico. She 
earned her Bachelor of Arts in Hispanic Stud-
ies from the University of Puerto Rico and 
holds a Master of Arts in Higher Education 
from the Universidad Interamericana de Puer-
to Rico. 
Later, Johanna moved to Central Florida 
where she taught Advanced Placement Span-
ish at Colonial High School for 19 years. While

being named the 2017 OCPS Teacher of the 
Year. Johanna has also received the Gov-
ernor’s Shine Award for Inspirational Teach-
ers, the Queen Smith Award for Commitment 
to Urban Public Education, Macy’s Magic of 
Leadership Award, the Wings of Inspiration 
Award, Coca-Cola’s Educator of Distinction 
Award, and the Life Changer of the Year 
Award. 
Johanna founded the Families Presentes 
Movement, a non-profit that educates and em-
powers Latino families and educators across 
Central Florida. Their online forum, Familias 
Presentes: Estudiantes Excelentes, informs 
and engages parents on a wide range of edu-
cation-related issues and opportunities. She 
also founded Maestros Puertorriquen˜os en 
Accio´n, or Puerto Rican Teachers in Action, 
which is dedicated to providing aid and assist-
ance to educators displaced from Puerto Rico 
after Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017. Jo-
hanna was also involved with many other or-
ganizations including the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation Teacher Advisory Council, the 
OCPS Foundation Board and Mi Familia 
Vota’s Education Committee.

HONORING PATRICIA GASTAUD- 
GALLAGHER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia 
Gastaud-Gallagher for her monumental con-
tributions to the California wine community. 
Born on April 25, 1945 in Wilmington, Dela-
ware, Patricia Gastaud-Gallagher received her 
bachelor’s degree in Government from Con-
necticut College for Women in 1967. Two 
years after receiving her first degree, she be-
came a freelance journalist and editor for the 
International Herald Tribune. It was during this 
time that Ms. Gastaud-Gallagher discovered 
her niche for wine and became the first Direc-
tor of Acade´mie du Vin in Paris, France, from 
1973 until 1989. Acade´mie du Vin, founded by 
Steven Spurrier in 1973, is France’s first pri-
vate wine school dedicated to teaching wine 
appreciation. With the desire to further her 
wine education, Ms. Gastaud-Gallagher re-
ceived a degree as an Oenology Technician 
with honors from the Universite´ de Bourgogne 
in Dijon, France in 1988. 
As a result of Ms. Gastaud-Gallagher’s love 
for wine and her determination to showcase 
California wine, she helped organize the fa-
mous May 24, 1976 Judgement of Paris blind 
wine tasting along with Steven Spurrier. This 
event attracted international attention to the 
astounding quality of Napa Valley wines, 
which had outperformed France’s top wines in 
tasting. Ms. Gastaud-Gallagher continued to 
influence the world of wine through her var-
ious roles as a writer and academic. She first 
became a columnist for two wine publications, 
l’Amateur de Bordeaux and Cuisine & Vins de 
France from 1985 until 1991. Shortly after 
these positions, she became Editorial Director 
for the International Who’s Who in Wines & 
Spirits. As a result of her contributions in the 
French wine industry, Ms. Gastaud-Gallagher 
became one the few non-French natives to re-
ceive the Chevalier du Me´rite Agricole in 
1993. Two years later, she became the Aca-
demic Director and Director of the Wine De-
partment at Le Cordon Bleu, a school in Paris 
dedicated to providing world-class culinary and 
hospitality instruction. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Pa-
tricia Gastaud-Gallagher has made a lasting 
impact on the Napa Valley wine community 
and California’s standing in the world of wine. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
her here today.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
RON KAGAN FROM THE DETROIT 
ZOO 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ron Kagan on the occa-
sion of his retirement after nearly 28 years of 
service to the Detroit Zoological Society. His 
nearly three decades of service to the ani-
mals, staff, and patrons of the Detroit Zoo is 
worthy of commendation. 
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Mr. Kagan 
studied Zoology at the University of Massa-
chusetts and at the Hebrew University in Jeru-
salem. Prior to coming to Detroit, he worked at 
the Jerusalem Zoo and the Dallas Zoo and 
Aquarium. Mr. Kagan first served as Director 
of the Detroit Zoo before becoming the Execu-
tive Director CEO of the Detroit Zoological So-
ciety. 
During Mr. Kagan’s tenure at the Detroit 
Zoo, he was responsible for many impressive 
new exhibits, programs, and conservation ef-
forts. These include the National Amphibian 
Conservation Center, the Berman Academy 
for Humane Education, the Ford Education 
Center and several exciting exhibits such as 
Arctic Ring of Life, Australian Outback Adven-
ture, and the Holtzman Wildlife Foundation 
Red Panda Forest. Mr. Kagan has led the way 
in conservation and sustainability at the Detroit 
Zoo. In 2015, the Association of Zoos and 
Aquariums 
named 
the 
Detroit 
Zoo 
the 
greenest zoo in the United States. Under the 
leadership of Mr. Kagan, the successful 
Greenprint sustainability program has been in-
strumental in transitioning the Zoo to 100 per-
cent renewable energy. 
An advocate for compassionate conserva-
tion and animal welfare, he has encouraged 
the rescue of exotic animals and created the 
Center for Zoo and Aquarium Animal Welfare 
and Ethics. In 2004, the Detroit Zoo was the 
first zoo to decide to no longer keep elephants 
in captivity for ethical reasons, the Zoo’s be-
loved elephants were sent to a sanctuary in 
California to live the rest of their lives in 
peace. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ron Kagan for his exemplary 
years of service. Mr. Kagan’s visionary leader-
ship has transformed the Detroit Zoo for the 
better. His endless compassion for animals 
and the wellbeing of his entire community has 
made a true difference in the lives of those big 
and small. We thank him once again for his 
lifelong dedication to animal welfare and sus-
tainability and to leaving a better world for the 
next generation. I join with Ron’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my best 
wishes to him in retirement.
