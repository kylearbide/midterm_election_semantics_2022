Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 2020 
No. 218 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of all creation, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
We come before You again, O Lord, to 
implore Your blessing upon a nation 
seeing continually high rates of infec-
tion with COVID–19. Our hospitals are 
near breaking point in the availability 
of beds for those who are stricken. 
Thank You again for those men and 
women of science who have developed 
the vaccines now beginning to be dis-
tributed. This is a great sign of hope in 
the midst of so much suffering and 
fear. Lord, have mercy. 
Bless the Members of this House, and 
of the Senate, as the omnibus and the 
coronavirus relief bills are presented 
and considered today. Give them wis-
dom and generosity; increase their 
trust that Your people in this Nation 
will use the assistance coming their 
way to fuel a struggling economy. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
4(a) of House Resolution 967, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
COVID VACCINE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I join in the prayer of the Chaplain this 
morning. I believe it is important to 
open this day of lifesaving relief with a 
prayer to ask that our Congress comes 
together and stands in the face with 
help on the way to dying Americans 
from COVID–19, the families of those 
who have died and those who are on the 
front lines fighting against this virus. 
It is important that we help our 
schoolchildren with educational dollars 
and, as well, make sure that the vac-
cines are going as fast as they can to 
the sites across America. 
I spoke to hospitals in my district, 
smaller hospitals and community hos-
pitals that are still waiting for their 
vaccine. We know that they want their 
frontline medical professionals to keep 
saving and serving the public. 
So this is going to be a historic and 
important day. We know it is not what 
we want in complete, but we know we 
will be working into the new year to be 
able to respond to the needs of the 
American people helping our local gov-
ernments and, as well, making sure 
that those children who will be return-
ing to school and those teachers, as 
well, will be protected after they have 
the opportunity—the teachers, in par-
ticular—to have the vaccine. This is a 
historic day. Let us work together. 
f 
RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I asso-
ciate myself with your comments and 
those of our Chaplain, Father Conroy, 
that it is appropriate to start today 
with a prayer, and every day, but espe-
cially a day when we are seeing over 
300,000—and the number getting high-
er—Americans who are dying from the 
coronavirus. 
We have hope because there is a vac-
cine. We have hope because we have a 
President who recognizes science and, 
again, the need for us to distribute the 
vaccine in the most equitable, fair, and 
free way. By that President, I mean 
one who will take office 1 month from 
now, Joe Biden. 
I do want to speak to the bill that 
will be on the floor shortly. It is a 
good, bipartisan bill. As different from 
bills that had been proposed on the 
Senate side by the Republican leader, 
it does things that his bill never did, 
and that is that it addresses the food 
needs of the American people. Maybe 15 
million children are food insecure in 
our country, and adults as well. 
Millions of families are on the verge 
of eviction, and this legislation ad-
dresses the rental needs and the short- 
term moratorium. We can accept a 
short-term because we will have a new 
President during the length of that 
moratorium to extend it further if nec-
essary. 
We also have in the legislation direct 
payments, which were not in the Re-
publican bill, to America’s working 
families. I would like them to have 
been bigger, but they are significant, 
and they will be going out soon. 
The President may insist on having 
his name on the check, but make no 
mistake, those checks are from the 
American people. The American peo-
ple’s name should be on that check, no 
individual, because that is the source 
of the resources for those checks—tax-
paying Americans. 
In addition to that, the list goes on 
of some of the very positive things that 
are on the bill—quite frankly, some of 
them did not come to agreement until 
yesterday—whether 
we 
are 
talking 
about WRDA, the Water Resources De-
velopment Act; a big jobs bill had bi-
partisan support but some disagree-
ment over language, but by the time

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7288 
December 21, 2020 
that was resolved, it pushed the bill 
from coming to the floor later. 
We didn’t have, at the start of the 
day, sick leave. That is in the bill, al-
most $2 billion for sick leave. 
It didn’t have the EITC, the earned 
income tax credit, for working poor 
people to have that boost, as well as 
the child tax credit. It did not have the 
employment retention tax credit—bi-
partisan support on WRDA and on that. 
Then we came to agreement not only 
on the language, but where that initia-
tive would be placed in that. So many 
of these things need to be precisely 
written and assembled in order for a 
bill to come to the floor, which we an-
ticipate will be pretty soon this morn-
ing. 
One of the things, though, that is dis-
appointing because, for a long time 
now, House Democrats and the Senate 
have been saying we want to crush the 
virus and put money in the pockets of 
the American people. The title of our 
bill before was about honoring our he-
roes, our State and local workers who 
are on the front line. 
We talk about those on the front 
lines who are our heroes. They are nec-
essary in meeting and crushing this 
virus. We are talking about healthcare 
workers in cities, counties, and States. 
We are talking about first responders, 
police and fire, some who are the first 
on the scene to help someone with the 
coronavirus. 
We are talking about our teachers, 
our teachers, our teachers, who are the 
custodians of our children for a large 
part of the day. We are talking about 
our transportation, sanitation, and 
food workers and those who make our 
lives possible. 
I think it would be interesting to 
point out that, as enthusiastic as we 
are about the PPP provisions in this 
bill, and we all support them in a bi-
partisan way, it is important to note 
that small businesses—I always say 
there is nothing more optimistic than 
starting a small business, maybe get-
ting married—but the optimism, the 
hope, and the dream that people have 
is completely, shall we say, darkened 
by the assault of this virus, and that is 
why we had to start by crushing the 
virus. 
We couldn’t pass legislation until 
now because the administration simply 
did not believe in testing, tracing, 
treatment, wearing masks, sanitation, 
separation, and the rest—the scientific 
approach. It has become clear to us 
now that they believed in herd immu-
nity, a quackery springing right from 
the Oval Office and not denied suffi-
ciently by some in the CDC and the 
rest. 
Now we have a vaccine, and that 
gives us hope, a vaccine that springs 
from science. 
People say around here sometimes: I 
am faith oriented, so I don’t believe in 
science. 
I say: Well, you can do both. Science 
is an answer to our prayers, and our 
prayers have been answered with a vac-
cine. 
In this legislation, we have a provi-
sion for it to be developed, purchased, 
and distributed in a way, again, that is 
fair, equitable, and free. 
What we couldn’t get ever—even with 
the previous legislation just on top, 
testing, et cetera—was the adequate 
language 
to 
recognize 
that 
this 
coronavirus has taken a horrible toll 
on our whole country, more so among 
people of color. People of color have 
died from the coronavirus. 
A child who was Hispanic had eight 
times more of a chance of going to the 
hospital with the coronavirus than a 
White child. If you are African Amer-
ican, there is five times more of a 
chance of going to the hospital because 
of the coronavirus. So now we have a 
vaccine we hope will reach everyone as 
soon as possible. 
One item that I am heartbroken 
about in this bill, though, is that, 
while we make an attempt to crush the 
virus, we don’t do it adequately enough 
in terms of recognizing the toll on peo-
ple of color; but we will have to do that 
in the public sentiment of it, in the de-
mand that we make on Governors and 
others who are in charge of the dis-
tribution. 
We put money in the pockets of the 
American people. We want to do more, 
but, nonetheless, we are meeting the 
deadline of December 26 for unemploy-
ment insurance, which was vital. 
But the third thing, honoring our he-
roes, as I said earlier, healthcare work-
ers, our first responders, police and 
fire, sanitation, transportation, food 
workers, teachers, teachers, teachers, 
we just decided that, while they are on 
the front line, while they are risking 
their lives to save lives—many of the 
healthcare workers, the police and fire, 
et cetera, many of them have lost their 
jobs. Many of them have already lost 
their lives. Many have lost their jobs. 
So why is it that this Congress and 
this White House refuses to recognize 
the value, the contribution, and the 
sacrifice of our, again, heroes, our peo-
ple on the front line? 
It is interesting, I think, to note 
that, when we passed a number of bills 
in a bipartisan way—and we will pass 
this one today—in the course of that, 
with the CARES Act and the followup 
on the PPP bill and this bill now, we 
are approaching $1 trillion that we are 
putting out for PPP. 
b 0915 
If that is what is needed and is spent 
effectively, that is a worthy expendi-
ture. Almost $1 trillion—well over 
$750,000. This bill alone, over $300 bil-
lion. So we have PPP. 
Now, in order for the private sector 
to function, in order for us to live our 
lives, we need to have the public sec-
tor: 
public 
transportation, 
public 
schools, public health, the list goes on. 
So it is not about public/private. It is 
about people, people who are doing 
their jobs, again, risking their lives to 
save lives and lose their life and may 
lose their jobs. Many have lost their 
lives. Many more, of course, have lost 
their jobs. 
Madam Speaker, we have approach-
ing $1 trillion for the PPP; small busi-
ness, which I support all the way; and 
$150 billion or $160 billion for State and 
local government, which enables the 
private sector to function, which en-
ables us to crush the virus, which en-
ables us to meet the needs of people. 
Madam Speaker, $150 billion to $160 
billion versus well over $800 billion al-
ready. How could that be right? Except 
the Republicans insist on saying: We 
don’t want to give money to blue 
States where the coronavirus is. 
It is in red States, too. It knows no 
borders and it knows no party, this vi-
cious virus. But somehow, other Re-
publicans have said to our heroes, our 
healthcare workers, our teachers, our 
transportation, our police and fire, and 
the rest—sanitation workers, so impor-
tant; food, food, food—you are not wor-
thy of support because perhaps you are 
in a blue State, predominantly, and, 
therefore, we undervalue your con-
tribution to our society, to our econ-
omy, and especially now, as we try to 
minister to the needs of people in this 
coronavirus crisis. 
How do you think these vaccines 
come into a State? They go from a lab 
to your arm magically? No. They have 
to be received, distributed, adminis-
tered, and done so fairly, equitably, 
and free. 
Who do you think is going to do 
those jobs if you don’t respect the role 
of State and local government in all of 
this? But don’t think of it as govern-
ment. Think of it as people. Think of it 
as yourself needing all of that. 
So I would hope that, as we see the 
need for what we have done in this 
nearly $900 billion legislation that we 
will vote on today, that everyone un-
derstands it is a first step. It is the 
first step, as President-elect Biden has 
said. It is the first step. And we will 
need to do more to get more virus as-
sistance to crush the virus, but also 
more money to buy more vaccines. 
We need to have the Defense Produc-
tion Act in play to hasten the manu-
facture of these vaccines, and we need 
to be able, as I said, to get the job 
done, and that takes people. 
People need to be respected. Their 
worth needs to be valued, and the enti-
ties under whose auspices they work, 
public hospitals, all the rest, and edu-
cation, so important. 
And yet, many of our teachers have 
lost their jobs. We need more teachers 
because we need more space to sepa-
rate, to, again, protect our children. 
We have always said, if we want the 
economy to open up and we want our 
schools to open up, you must crush the 
virus, at least take the precautions so 
that people are not in jeopardy if they 
go to work or when they go to school. 
Schools should be the safest places in 
America for our children, and they can 
be if science is respected and the mask- 
wearing, distancing, and the rest. But 
you need more space; you need better

ventilation, as BOBBY SCOTT tells us 
over and over; and we need more teach-
ers. 
This is a big mistake. The Repub-
licans said you can get a small amount, 
not even approaching in any way, the 
PPP—again, no resentment there; we 
support that. But the recognition that 
that is important should also recognize 
that the sector of our economy that 
supports the private sector be recog-
nized. 
So, on that score, you come to a situ-
ation where, how could it be that we 
only have $160 billion for State and 
local, where we have approaching $1 
trillion dollars for PPP, not recog-
nizing that the private sector is con-
nected to the public sector? 
Now, one more point on that. 
They said: You can have some money 
for State and local—we will decide how 
it will be distributed—if you do sur-
render the rights of workers. 
In other words, just in case anybody 
doesn’t know, there are essential work-
ers who are required to go to work. If 
they don’t because they are concerned 
about danger to their health and the 
health of their families because the 
workplace is not safe, they cannot go 
on unemployment insurance. And if 
they go to work and contract the virus, 
they have no recourse, because that is 
the way the Republicans want it. 
That is the way the Republicans 
want it: antiworker. 
Madam Speaker, just for good meas-
ure, they have thrown in certain as-
pects of the Civil Rights Act, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the 
Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA—the 
list goes on—in section 42 of their hei-
nous liability bill of all of the actions 
that cannot be taken. 
And I asked one of the Republican 
Senators: What does preventing the 
ADA, American with Disabilities Act, 
to honor its responsibility? 
They said: Why not have the Cham-
ber of Commerce call you and tell you. 
I said: Why don’t you not waste my 
time or the Chambers’ time about why 
the ADA should not be enforced be-
cause of the virus? 
This is coronavirus-centric. We said 
that we can find a compromise on li-
ability for the time of the virus and in 
a way that is fair to those employers 
who want to protect their workers and 
to the workers. They decided they 
would turn it into some massive, long- 
term, ever-encompassing liability—just 
so wrong to work with. That is not 
what our system is about. 
But, nonetheless, I still thought we 
could try to find a compromise. We 
couldn’t. They were absolute: Just call 
the Chamber of Commerce. They will 
tell you why they can’t meet the needs 
of their workers. 
Madam Speaker, heading back to the 
money, nearly $1 trillion PPP. 
$160 billion—and not even giving the 
States and localities the flexibility to 
use the funds for both addressing the 
COVID needs, the health needs, but 
also the revenue lost. Even the Repub-
lican Governors wanted that flexi-
bility, but they wouldn’t give it to us 
then, and they wouldn’t give it to us 
now for fear that some blue State Gov-
ernor or city or mayor or county exec-
utive might take advantage of that. 
We have never done enough for local-
ities. That is a pitch we have made. 
That is what we have in the Heroes 
Act. But there was no market for that 
on the Republican side of the aisle. 
So when we say it is a first step, that 
is basic. Let us thank God CHUCK SCHU-
MER was able to dismantle, in part, the 
Toomey resolution that would tie the 
hands of a President to meet the needs 
of the American people and our econ-
omy by exercising section 13(3) of the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
Madam Speaker, we got past that, 
which took a long time. I felt Wednes-
day night we were finished. This mon-
strosity reared his head the next morn-
ing. Leader SCHUMER effectively was 
able to fix it—it still should not even 
have been initiated, but, nonetheless, 
fix it—in a way that enabled us to go 
forward. And that is why it has taken 
this long to get here in these last few 
days. 
Madam Speaker, again, I look for-
ward to NITA LOWEY bringing the legis-
lation to the floor. As the chair of the 
Committee on Appropriations, this will 
be her last bill on the floor. In fact, it 
is the last bill for many of us here, but 
hers as chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. 
She 
and 
her 
staff— 
Shalanda and Chris and so many oth-
ers—and all of our chairs did such a re-
markable job, and their staffs deserve 
so much credit for all of this. 
Again, we will do some good with 
this legislation, but we must recognize 
that more needs to be done to crush 
the virus, to put more money in the 
pockets of the American people—from 
the American people to the American 
people—and, again, to fill in the gap 
that has been purposefully left to 
honor our heroes with all that. 
As we review policy and legislation 
and negotiation and all that, just al-
ways have in our hearts every single 
one of the people who have died from 
the coronavirus. It can be stopped. It 
can be crushed. But that is a decision, 
it is a decision, and a decision to recog-
nize where it is hurting people the 
most. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to a 
strong bipartisan vote today on this 
legislation, respecting it for what it 
does, not judging it for what it does 
not, but recognizing that more needs to 
be done. 
Again, with high praise for all of our 
chairs, and, again, special recognition 
of Madam Chair NITA LOWEY for her 
last bill on the floor, again, I say con-
gratulations to all the staff who 
worked so hard. 
But it all comes back to families who 
lost their loved ones, those millions 
and millions of people who were in-
fected, some more seriously than oth-
ers. We don’t know the after-effects it 
may have, but we do know that we 
have hope. 
We have a vaccine, and we have a 
President coming into office who be-
lieves in science and cares about people 
and values the work that our first re-
sponders and our healthcare workers, 
et cetera, do for us. 
Madam Chair, prayerfully, as you 
and our chaplain began, prayerfully, I 
close my remarks, assuring, for what-
ever it is worth, that many of us who 
serve in this body and represent the 
American people have had a death in 
the family, because so many people 
have lost their loved ones, whom we 
have all lost. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF AID 
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of our bipartisan leg-
islation to both fund the government 
and for the COVID relief package. As 
Speaker PELOSI just noted, this bill is 
far from perfect, but we can’t let the 
perfect be the enemy of the good. 
Madam Speaker, today, is the dark-
est day of the year. It is a fitting sym-
bol of the misery and suffering that so 
many people are facing in our country 
right now. The effects of this pandemic 
have been cruelly uneven. 
Some people have remained rel-
atively unscathed. Some people can 
work remotely, still have their jobs, no 
one around them has gotten sick or 
died within their immediate circle, 
while others are awash in misery: un-
able to return to work, unable to pay 
their rent, to pay their utilities; people 
around them have gotten sick. 
People have lost their lifesavings in 
their small business, and many hun-
dreds of thousands have died, including 
my 92-year-old father-in-law, who, in 
April, 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
the 
coronavirus and died within 48 hours. 
Today’s relief package—and that is 
what it is is relief—will provide much- 
needed help for millions of Americans. 
So while today is the darkest day of 
the year, every day will get a little 
brighter, and spring will surely follow 
our dark winter. But we must remem-
ber that, while spring is on its way, 
there is so much more that needs to be 
done. 
Our State and local governments 
must have relief from their massive 
loss of revenues. Without our help, po-
lice officers, teachers, and other heroes 
on the front line will face layoffs. 
Madam Speaker, we need to continue 
today’s spirit of bipartisanship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7290 
December 21, 2020 
The 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
is 
dev-
astating our communities, especially, 
disproportionately, African-American, 
Latinx, Asian-American, and Indige-
nous people, who are suffering the 
worst of this pandemic. Eight million 
people have slipped into poverty since 
the start of this pandemic, and one in 
four adults are suffering from hunger 
during COVID–19. 
I am pleased that we were able to 
come to this agreement. 
I want to thank our Speaker, NANCY 
PELOSI, who has worked day and night 
for what some of us are calling a sur-
vival package. It is a lifeline payment 
until we can do something and do jus-
tice by the American people. 
I also want to just thank Chairman 
PALLONE, 
Congresswoman 
DELAURO, 
Chairwoman NITA LOWEY, and all of 
our staffs for the amazing work that 
they have done to put in so many of 
our priorities on a wide range of issues. 
This bill sets aside $2.8 billion to en-
sure that minority communities hit 
hardest by COVID get the testing and 
vaccine support they need. 
I look forward to working with my 
Tri-Caucus and Native American col-
leagues to see that this funding is used 
to engage local community organiza-
tions and trusted messengers in the 
community so people can get the infor-
mation that they need to keep them-
selves and their families safe.

the Senate amendment thereto, and to con-
sider in the House, without intervention of 
any point of order, a motion offered by the 
chair of the Committee on Appropriations or 
her designee that the House concur in the 
Senate amendment with an amendment con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 
116-68. The Senate amendment and the mo-
tion shall be considered as read. The motion 
shall be debatable for one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
adoption without intervening motion. The 
question of adoption of the motion shall be 
divided for a separate vote on the matter 
proposed to be inserted as divisions B, C, E, 
and F, and the Chair shall first put the ques-
tion on such portion of the divided question. 
If either portion of the divided question fails 
of adoption, then the motion shall imme-
diately be considered to have failed of adop-
tion. 
SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution, 
the House shall be considered to have taken 
from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 1520) 
to amend the Public Health Service Act to 
provide for the publication of a list of li-
censed biological products, and for other pur-
poses, with the Senate amendment thereto, 
and to have concurred in the Senate amend-
ment with an amendment consisting of the 
text of Rules Committee Print 116-69. 
SEC. 3. The Clerk shall be authorized to 
make necessary technical and conforming 
changes in the engrossment of the House 
amendments specified in the first two sec-
tions of this resolution, to include correc-
tions in spelling, punctuation, section num-
bering, and cross-references. 
SEC. 4. If a veto message is laid before the 
House on H.R. 6395, then after the message is 
read and the objections of the President are 
spread at large upon the Journal, further

bill shall be postponed until the legislative 
day of Monday, December 28, 2020; and on 
that legislative day, the House shall proceed 
to the constitutional question of reconsider-
ation and dispose of such question without 
intervening motion. 
SEC. 5. The chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations and the chair of the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence may insert

deem explanatory of the Senate amendment 
and the motion specified in the first section 
of this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) 
is recognized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
SHALALA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1271, 
providing for a motion to concur with 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 133 with 
a House amendment. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. It 
provides that the question on adoption 
of the motion shall be divided for a sep-
arate vote on the matter proposed to 
be inserted as divisions B, C, E, and F. 
The rule provides that upon adoption 
of this resolution, the House shall be 
considered to have concurred in the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 1520 with a 
House amendment. The rule also pro-
vides that the chairs of the Committee 
on Appropriations and the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence may 
insert explanatory materials in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD not later than 
December 28 and authorizes the Clerk 
to make technical corrections to the 
bill. 
Finally, the rule allows for consider-
ation of a possible veto message on the 
conference report to H.R. 6395 on De-
cember 28, 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the bill in this rule. This COVID 
bill has taken far too long. We started 
these negotiations before the first day 
of summer in June, the longest day of 
the year, and here we are now headed 
into the darkest day of the year, the 
first day of winter. 
I also want to acknowledge the hard 
work of our Appropriations chair, NITA 
LOWEY, and Ranking Member GRANGER. 
But this didn’t have to happen. The 
pain that has been inflicted on the 
American people did not come just 
from the novel virus that has spread 
like wildfire across this Nation, but 
also from the elected leaders sent to 
Washington to help people and to help 
this great Nation. 
Our failure to reach an agreement 
until today only added fuel to this 
wildfire. It meant that not only did 
people get the coronavirus, but when 
they did, their families often went hun-
gry, their bills went unpaid, and they 
faced possible eviction or foreclosure. 
Madam Speaker, for 8 years, I worked 
in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building 
not very far from here. Inscribed in the 
lobby of that building is a quote from 
Hubert Humphrey: ‘‘The moral test of 
government is how the government 
treats those who are in the dawn of 
life, the children; those who are in the 
twilight of life, the elderly; and those 
who are in the shadows of life, the sick, 
the needy, and the handicapped.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we have failed that 
moral test. We have no right to make 
children go hungry in this country. 
While this bill will certainly bring us 
closer to passing that moral test, it is 
too late for too many people, and it 
will be too little for others. Nonethe-
less, we should pass this bill imme-
diately. 
There are a number of things that I 
am pleased to see included in this bill: 
a long-fought and negotiated bipar-
tisan and bicameral compromise to 
protect patients by ending surprise 
billing; multiple-year funding for com-
munity health centers, the backbone of 
our Nation’s primary care system for 
the most vulnerable; and an added 
boost in weekly unemployment bene-
fits and relief checks for people who 
have been waiting for months for help. 
There will be more than $300 billion 
for small businesses and money to help 
schools, for hospitals, and for vaccine 
distribution. It will also provide food 
assistance to hungry children and their 
families. 
This package will be bigger than the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act. It is the biggest package we have 
passed since the CARES Act in March. 
b 1615 
But there is still more to do. I hope 
when the 117th Congress convenes in 
January, that they will not forget the 
American people who will still be suf-
fering and will need more. I hope that 
they will remember the people in my 
district, a district heavily dependent 
on travel, on tourism, and the service 
economy. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that the fam-
ilies in my community in Miami, 
which have been devastated by the last 
9 months—and so much more must be 
done to help them. 
But, today, we must pass this bill. It 
is time to be done with this, and we 
can wait not a moment longer. 
Simply put, with this bill, we are at-
tempting to right our moral compass 
and fulfill our obligation to those suf-
fering across our country and to help 
guide us out of this dark winter. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA), 
my good friend, for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a rule that provides for con-
sideration of a package of items that 
are of great importance to the country. 
The House amendment to the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 133 includes not 
only a bipartisan omnibus appropria-
tions bill covering the remainder of fis-
cal year 2021, but also a $900 billion bi-
partisan pandemic relief package to 
provide help to millions of Americans 
who have suffered as a result of the 
pandemic. 
It also includes a bipartisan com-
promise addressing surprise medical 
bills, something that has been a pri-
ority for both parties. 
Finally, it includes a number of end- 
of-the-year tax and healthcare-related 
extenders that are critical to those 
they serve, especially during a pan-
demic. 
While I know that we are all thrilled 
to be here today to bring these items 
to the floor, I am frustrated that it has 
taken this long to reach this deal, and 
I know the American people share that 
frustration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7292 
December 21, 2020 
The reality is that we could have had 
this deal months ago on a pandemic re-
lief package, and we could have had 
this deal. Individual components could 
have been passed across the floor in 
July of this year. Instead, Americans 
were left to suffer. All the while, jobs 
were being lost and businesses being 
closed; all the while, small businesses 
across the country were forced to make 
difficult decisions about which employ-
ees to keep and which staff to let go; 
all the while, a deal was available here 
in Congress that could have extended 
unemployment insurance and extended 
the Paycheck Protection Program, a 
program which Democrats in the House 
rejected extending 41 times. 
These two key backstops could have 
helped millions of Americans. Instead, 
Democrats chose to play politics and 
chose not to take yes for an answer. 
But now that the election is over and 
the end of the year is at hand, suddenly 
there is room for a deal, a very bipar-
tisan deal that was on the table all 
along and that could have been passed 
into law months ago. 
Madam Speaker, for today, we will 
look past that. Though this overall bill 
is massive, I think it is easiest to di-
gest if you consider it in three separate 
sections: 
Section 1 is the bipartisan, bicameral 
omnibus appropriations bill, which will 
include our appropriations work for fis-
cal year 2021. The appropriations proc-
ess works best when it is bipartisan, 
and with today’s bill, we have accom-
plished that end. 
Once we step past the partisanship, 
we are able to work together and reach 
a deal that will fully fund the govern-
ment for the fiscal year. Our constitu-
ents deserve no less. 
Madam Speaker, the deal before us 
covers all 12 spending bills and it en-
sures that taxpayer dollars will go 
where they are needed most. In par-
ticular, I am pleased that this bill in-
cludes key provisions supporting our 
response to the pandemic, like $20 bil-
lion for coronavirus vaccines, an in-
crease in funding for the National In-
stitutes of Health, and a further $3 bil-
lion to rebuild the Strategic National 
Stockpile of medical supplies and per-
sonal protective equipment. It fully 
funds our defense needs and ensures a 3 
percent pay raise for all military per-
sonnel. It continues to fund needed im-
provements for border security. And, 
perhaps most importantly, it main-
tains all pro-life protections, as has 
been the case in previous years. And 
the harmful, partisan riders that ap-
peared in Democratic partisan appro-
priations bills from earlier this year 
have been removed. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is worth 
noting that this bill came about as a 
result of regular order. The Committee 
on Appropriations produced each of the 
12 appropriations bills from a regular 
committee 
process. 
Members 
were 
given the opportunity to amend, ques-
tion, and fully examine most of the 
bills on the floor, and the House and 
Senate met together to conference the 
bills into a final product. This dem-
onstrates how powerful and effective 
regular order can be. 
Madam Speaker, the second piece of 
this bill is the $900 billion pandemic re-
lief package. For all of 2020, Ameri-
cans—and indeed the world—have lived 
under the specter of this pandemic. It 
has touched every American’s life in 
some way or another, but many Ameri-
cans have been hit harder than others. 
Millions have caught this disease, 
and hundreds of thousands have died. 
Millions more have lost their jobs, and 
millions have seen their wages or earn-
ings cut. This has been a crisis that 
touches us on so many levels. A health 
crisis is bad enough, but adding an eco-
nomic crisis on top of it makes this 
year the toughest that many of us can 
remember. 
The coronavirus relief package before 
us will do several things to ease the 
burden on all Americans. It will extend 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
will ensure that many small businesses 
will be able to keep their employees on 
the payroll. It will extend expanded un-
employment insurance, thus providing 
more funds to unemployed workers to 
help make them closer to whole. And it 
will provide economic impact pay-
ments of $600 to almost every Amer-
ican, except those with high incomes. 
Though I expect this may not be the 
last time Congress responds to the 
COVID pandemic, I hope that in the fu-
ture the Speaker will embark on a dif-
ferent path of resolution. A relief pack-
age like this one may not have been ev-
erything that both parties wanted, but 
a compromise deal that provides real 
help to American workers is better 
than no deal at all. And that com-
promise could have and should have 
been reached months ago. I hope the 
majority will remember that going for-
ward. 
Madam Speaker, the third section of 
today’s package is a number of mis-
cellaneous bipartisan items, including 
a bill intended to address the problems 
of surprise medical billing. This is a 
problem that is known far too well by 
many Americans. 
You see a doctor or you visit an 
emergency room, and only learn after 
the fact that a medical professional 
you saw during your treatment is out-
side your insurance network. This can 
lead to a wildly expensive bill for the 
patient, who may not have had any 
choice in the matter. 
The bipartisan bill before us today 
will help solve this problem. It will en-
sure that the patients will only be re-
sponsible for covering the portion not 
covered by their health insurance at 
in-network rates when they don’t have 
the ability to choose an in-network 
doctor, like in emergency situations. 
The bill also will make pricing more 
open and transparent and will require 
insurers to notify patients in advance 
if they are going to receive out-of-net-
work care. 
These reforms will give patients and 
consumers more choice and will make 
sure that they are not subjected to 
massive, surprise bills, ones that pa-
tients frequently have not planned for. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
applaud 
my 
friends on the Committee on Ways and 
Means, the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, and the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor for coming to this 
important compromise, and I look for-
ward to supporting its passage in law. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I take a mo-
ment to acknowledge my very dear 
friend, Representative DONNA SHALALA, 
who is managing her final rule on the 
floor today. I have always enjoyed my 
interactions with my friend and it has 
always been a pleasure serving with 
her on the Committee on Rules. She 
has been a helpful ally when we have 
agreed and a worthy opponent when we 
have not. 
Much more importantly, she has al-
ways been, first and foremost, a public 
servant. She was a public servant be-
fore she arrived in Congress. I have no 
doubt she will continue to be a public 
servant when she leaves. We have all 
benefitted from her leadership at the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services during the Clinton years, from 
her many years as a leader in edu-
cational institutions, from her tireless 
participations on countless boards and 
commissions and committees, all of 
which were rendering important serv-
ice to our country. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to miss 
my friend on the Committee on Rules. 
This Congress is going to miss her, but 
I know the country is going to con-
tinue to have the benefit of her splen-
did service and insight. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my distinguished colleague for 
his very kind words. I will say that I 
have enjoyed working with him. I have 
deep respect for his leadership in this 
Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), 
the 
distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding to 
me. 
Madam Speaker, across America, 
people are dealing with a loss of a job, 
a business, or even a loved one. People 
are hurting, and they are hurting badly 
not only from this pandemic, but also 
from the incompetence, the callous-
ness, and the negligence of the current 
occupant of the White House. 
When I talk about people hurting, I 
don’t mean big corporations or Fortune 
500 companies. I am talking about our 
workers, our middle class, those on the 
edge of the middle class, and those 
struggling in poverty. That is where 
our focus should be. And thanks to the 
bipartisan efforts of Members on both 
sides of the Capitol, we are acting right 
now—not next year or during the next 
administration, as some have sug-
gested—but right now. 
This deal is not everything I want— 
not by a long shot—but the choice be-
fore us is simple. It is about whether

we help families or not. It is about 
whether we help small businesses and 
restaurants or not. It is about whether 
we boost SNAP benefits and strengthen 
antihunger programs or not. And it is 
about whether we help those dealing 
with a job loss or not. 
To me, this is not a tough call. We 
need to pass this, and then we need to 
prepare to build on it in the next Con-
gress, hopefully, in a bipartisan fashion 
and with an administration that actu-
ally gives a damn about the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, before I conclude, I 
also join the gentleman from Okla-
homa in recognizing the service of Con-
gresswoman SHALALA. Over the years, 
she has had many titles: Doctor, treas-
urer, college president, chancellor, as-
sistant secretary, secretary, congress-
woman—and I could go on. 
Often, DONNA has done it first: She 
was among the very first Peace Corps 
volunteers. She was the first woman to 
lead a Big 10 Conference college. She 
was only the second woman to lead a 
major research university. And DONNA 
was the first Lebanese American to 
serve in a President’s Cabinet. 
Madam Speaker, there is a saying in 
Arabic, which in English is: ‘‘Do good 
and throw it into the sea.’’ 
It means this: The reward is doing 
good. Not the praise or recognition. 
Just simply an act of doing good. 
And DONNA SHALALA does good, pe-
riod. I know she will continue to do 
good. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO), my good friend and 
distinguished colleague on the Com-
mittee on Rules. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am 
glad that we finally have a bipartisan 
deal for COVID relief, but the process 
has been absolutely terrible. 
I have to tell you that we have, what, 
6,000 pages? And what did we get? 
We got it, like, maybe 2 hours ago, 
the text of it. We were waiting all 
night. 
In fact, Speaker PELOSI had called 
Members back last week. We thought 
we were going to be doing this last 
Wednesday. Instead, we were doing all 
these suspension bills. People had to 
fly from all over the country—all the 
Congress Members—in crowded air-
ports, crowded planes; not really good 
for mitigating COVID, if you ask me. 
Madam Speaker, I will say, though, 
that I am glad that, finally, after 
months and months of Republicans 
asking for a bipartisan COVID relief 
bill that could actually get signed into 
law, we are actually here today, even if 
it is a couple days before Christmas. 
And it is a bill that will help small 
businesses and their workers, will help 
the airline industry, will be a solution 
to Americans who are struggling with 
surprise medical bills. 
b 1630 
For those who are unemployed be-
cause of the coronavirus, because the 
governments have shut down the busi-
nesses, it will give unemployment in-
surance relief. But there will be protec-
tions in there to make sure that the 
people are really unemployed and that 
they will accept a reasonable offer for 
a job. 
Also good in the bill is that there is 
not only money for vaccine procure-
ment but for distribution of the vac-
cines. 
On that note, I want to applaud 
President Trump for his action in Oper-
ation Warp Speed and for working with 
the private sector to get vaccines done 
and out the door in record time. This 
has never been done before in history. 
Normally, it takes years and years for 
vaccines to be done. 
Thank you, President Trump, for 
your hard work for the American peo-
ple. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, first, let me thank 
Chairman MCGOVERN for his very kind 
words. I have enjoyed serving under his 
leadership. 
Let me say to my colleague, Mrs. 
LESKO, years of bipartisan investments 
in NIH have, in fact, led to Operation 
Warp Speed. Decades of investments in 
training the world’s best scientists 
have led to a very fast-paced develop-
ment of a vaccine. So, it is not just the 
present President; it is Presidents be-
fore that who believed that we should 
have world-class science in this coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, this bill will not end all the suf-
fering. However, it will ease the pain 
for many who are suffering, with $25 
billion for eviction prevention, $13 bil-
lion for food in the form of SNAP, and 
$600 cash in pocket. It won’t end all the 
suffering, but it will ease much of the 
pain. 
For this, I thank Chairman MCGOV-
ERN, Mr. COLE, and Ms. SHALALA. Of 
course, I am always honored to serve in 
the Congress of the United States of 
America under the leadership of the 
Honorable 
MAXINE
WATERS, 
and 
I 
thank her for her $25 billion in rental 
assistance. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), my very good friend and 
the distinguished ranking Republican 
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for his leadership on this issue and so 
many other issues over the years. 
Madam Speaker, for months now, our 
Nation’s entrepreneurs and small busi-
ness owners have been pleading for ad-
ditional help from Congress. I have 
been hearing this from small busi-
nesses back in my district in the great-
er Cincinnati area. I know that my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle have 
been hearing the same thing from their 
constituents. 
While I am relieved that Congress is 
finally acting on those cries for help, I 
am dismayed that it has taken this 
long. I introduced a bill back in Sep-
tember, 3 months ago, that could have 
been brought to the floor and helped 
those small businesses that so des-
perately needed that help back then. 
That bill included many of the same 
provisions that we are voting on today. 
Instead, this House, under Democratic 
control, considered bills about mari-
juana and online conspiracy theories, 
for example. It is an embarrassment 
that it has taken this long because 
every moment of delay put more small 
businesses at risk of permanent clo-
sure. 
These small businesses, restaurants, 
shops, and manufacturers employ near-
ly half of this country’s workers and 
form the backbone of communities all 
across the country. Fortunately, the 
provisions in today’s relief package 
will bring critical assistance to these 
workers and their families. 
The Paycheck Protection Program, 
which has supported over 50 million 
employees, will be reopened for new 
and second-time applicants. Funds will 
be reserved for very small businesses 
and community lenders. The list of eli-
gible expenses will be expanded so that 
small business owners can purchase 
PPE, for example, to keep employees 
and their loved ones safe. 
There are many more details in the 
package, too many to go into here. But 
the bottom line is this: These provi-
sions will bring meaningful help to 
millions of Americans. 
Just in my district in Cincinnati and 
the surrounding area, a PPP loan 
helped keep 140 employees on the pay-
roll at the Silver Spring House res-
taurant. A PPP loan enabled HomeWell 
Care Services, an assisted living facil-
ity, to continue their important work 
for our community’s elderly popu-
lation. And the folks at Neyer Plumb-
ing used PPP funding to carry on as an 
essential business. 
These are real people with real fami-
lies to support and bills to pay. That is 
why it is so important that we pass 
this package without additional delay. 
Small businesses and their employees 
are tough; they are resilient. Across 
the country, we hear stories about 
small businesses giving back to their 
communities, 
even 
when 
they 
are 
struggling themselves. 
It is time for Congress to meet the 
moment and get further help in the 
hands of working Americans. As a mat-
ter of fact, it is far overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this long- 
overdue legislation. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA).

relief package in this rule. We did it 
before. We must do it again. 
Our past COVID legislation kept the 
economy afloat and our poverty rate 
flat. However, as Democrats passed 
more bills, the Senate and the Presi-
dent put a pause on those efforts. 
Now, the pandemic is raging, hos-
pitals are bursting, and our economy is 
hurting. That is why we must play our 
part with Federal funding to combat 
this disease and carry on through the 
locally mandated shutdowns. 
This relief package will allow us to 
avoid calamity and aid our recovery by 
providing small businesses with PPP, 
laid-off employees with unemployment 
insurance, families with checks, farm-
workers with PPE, renters with direct 
relief, and the ailing with the HOS-
PICE Act. 
To help State and local governments, 
there is funding for broadband, food, 
healthcare, education, and transpor-
tation. 
Look, this package should have been 
bigger. It should have been done 
quicker. It is not entirely what we 
want. But it is what we need to be that 
bridge to a vaccine-fueled revival in 
2021. If we do that, we will further the 
faith in what we do here in Congress 
for the future of our democracy. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my very good friend 
and a distinguished member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee and the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. 
BURGESS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
hearing some of the earlier discussion, 
just for a data point, this is December 
21, the longest night of the year, as 
they say. 
On August 21, the former Vice Presi-
dent, in accepting the Democratic 
Party nomination for President, in his 
acceptance speech, said: Look, let’s be 
clear. No miracle is coming. 
Well, here we are, 4 months later, 
with not one but two vaccines, each in 
excess of 90 percent effective; abso-
lutely phenomenal. 
As another data point, in August 
2014, the Ebola crisis was raging in 
Western Africa. A vaccine was out of 
phase 1 trials. It took 51⁄2 years to de-
liver that vaccine. This one was deliv-
ered in 10 months. It is absolutely in-
credible. 
Look, in the bill before us today, 
there are some high points, and there 
are some low points. A couple of things 
I do want to point out. 
The Independence at Home Act that I 
introduced with Congresswoman DIN-
GELL several years ago was continued 
and expanded. 
One of the biggest deals for me is 
coverage for immunosuppressive drugs 
after a renal transplant. I have been 
working on this for 10 years. Now, we 
have provided additional protection for 
people who are recipients of renal 
transplants so that they can continue 
to get their immunosuppressive drugs. 
Some flexibility has been provided in 
the bill to allow for value-based care. 
The alternative payment model thresh-
old is frozen for 2 years. That is impor-
tant. 
Project ECHO, which allows for pri-
mary care doctors in remote areas to 
be able to consult with specialists, has 
been continued. That is a big deal. 
The out-of-network billing has been 
tough, and it has been tough in a year 
that has been tough on our Nation’s 
frontline healthcare personnel. The 
out-of-network billing language has 
improved dramatically over the last 18 
months. I cannot say that it is perfect, 
but some of the more recent improve-
ments, such as the prevention of put-
ting payment data from public payers 
in the independent dispute resolution 
process, are pretty big wins for our 
physicians. 
I will also add that it is an unusual 
time that they should have to be facing 
additional cuts when our doctors have 
been on the front lines of providing 
care for America’s patients during this 
pandemic. Faced with out-of-network 
payment reductions from the insurance 
companies and with reductions through 
the evaluation and management codes, 
the E and M codes, it is a funny way to 
go about rewarding those that we 
would refer to as our Nation’s heroes. 
Still, Mr. Speaker, the American peo-
ple do need the relief that is provided 
in this coronavirus package. 
Ms. SHALALA. I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
help is on the way. Help cannot come 
faster. Help is desperately needed. 
Seventeen million Americans are in-
fected by COVID–19. Almost 320,000 are 
dead, and the numbers keep growing. 
Hospital beds are overutilized. Cities 
across America are getting refrigerated 
trucks. Help is on the way. 
People are being evicted, and this 
legislation helps us stop the evictions. 
It provides for cash disbursements, up 
to $2,400 for a family of four and $300 
extra in weekly unemployment pay-
ments. 
For hungry families, 54 million hun-
gry families in America, including our 
young military personnel, help is on 
the way. 
This bill is a bill we wrote months 
ago. It is downsized, but it is the very 
language that we have written. So we 
know, in the new year, we will come 
back again to save lives. 
Let’s get this done in unity. We know 
how it was blocked. We know the other 
House did not move forward. We know 
we did not get leadership on this bill. 
But as I close, let me thank Sec-
retary 
Shalala, 
Congresswoman 
SHALALA, for what she brought to this 
Congress, 
what 
insight, 
what 
specialness, and what kindness. 
We wish you the very best, and I look 
forward to working with you in the fu-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, help is on the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
for the Rule that the House is debating to pro-
vide for the consideration of the Fiscal Year 
appropriations for the federal government and 
urgently needed COVID–19 relief funding. 
Chairman MCGOVERN, and Ranking Member 
COLE, thank you for your work to bring this 
Rule before the House so that Members can 
debate and vote for urgently needed aid to 
communities across the nation and the funding 
needed to keep the federal government oper-
ational through the remainder of Fiscal Year 
2021. 
As a senior member of the Committees on 
the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on 
the Budget, and the representative of the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, an epicenter 
for COVID–19 infections, I recognize the ur-
gency of providing assistance now, but I also 
recognize that the assistance is insufficient to 
the needs of our state and local governments, 
our hospitals, or the people of our great na-
tion. 
I support this rule that will facilitate passage 
of this interim package, while also saying that 
more is needed. 
Before the Rules Committee also was the 
omnibus appropriations bill providing funding 
to continue the operations of the federal gov-
ernment through September 30, 2021, thus 
avoiding a wasteful and irresponsible shut-
down. 
I am relieved that at long last, agreement 
has been reached between the bicameral 
leadership to provide needed and long over-
due relief to the tens of millions Americans 
whose lives and livelihoods have been dev-
astated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I am grateful that efficacious vaccines have 
been discovered and are on their way to pro-
viding much needed protection and relief, but 
this is just a down payment on the relief and 
support needed for our country to recover 
from the pandemic and build back better. 
Over the course of the 116th Congress the 
House Rules Committee has done its job and 
provided expert guidance on the progress of 
nearly 600 bills that have passed the House 
and gone to the Senate. 
These bills included legislation to lower 
health care and prescription drug prices, raise 
wages, advance economic and retirement se-
curity, end gun violence, act on the climate cri-
sis, protect Dreamers, and strengthen voting 
rights. 
For example, in this Congress the House 
has passed and sent to the Senate the fol-
lowing major legislative bills: 
H.R. 1, For the People Act; 
H.R. 2, Moving Forward Act; 
H.R. 3, The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug 
Costs Now Act; 
H.R. 4, Voting Rights Advancement Act; 
H.R. 5, Equality Act; 
H.R. 6, The American Dream & Promise 
Act; 
H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act; 
H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act; 
H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act; 
H.R. 582, Raise the Wage Act; 
H.R. 1425, Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Enhancement Act; 
H.R. 1585, Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act; and 
H.R. 7120, George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act. 
Also among the bills passed by the House 
was H.R. 3710, the Cybersecurity Vulnerability 
Remediation Act, legislation that increases the 
responsibilities of the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) with respect to cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7295 
December 21, 2020 
The National Cybersecurity and Commu-
nications Integration Center of DHS under this 
bill is directed to disseminate protocols to 
counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including 
in circumstances in which such vulnerabilities 
exist because software or hardware is no 
longer supported by a vendor. 
This bill would also provide the Science and 
Technology Directorate the flexibility to estab-
lish a competition to develop remedies for cy-
bersecurity vulnerabilities. 
Today, our nation is still attempting to un-
derstand the scope and breath of the latest 
Russia sourced attack on federal government 
cyber assets. 
In this moment we must address the crisis 
created by COVID–19, and the Cybersecurity 
threat that is ongoing. 
There are consequences for the Senate’s 
failure to take up House bills once they are re-
ceived in the Senate. 
In truth the Republican-controlled Senate 
has been missing in action for much of the 
116th Congress. 
Whether it is the urgent need to fortify our 
election systems from confirmed foreign inter-
ference, notably from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, 
or lower prescription drugs prices and expand-
ing and protecting the right of all Americans to 
affordable, accessible, high quality health 
care, fixing our broken immigration system, or 
hold a wayward Executive to account, the 
other body has failed the American people in 
its basic duty to promote the general welfare 
and provide for the common defense. 
The consequences of its complete disregard 
for the work of the House is now more appar-
ent than ever and is illustrated perfectly by the 
Senate’s failure to take up and vote on the 
HEROES Act passed by the House in March 
of this year to address the devastating budg-
etary and fiscal impacts of the COVID–19 pan-
demic which the President exacerbated by his 
incompetent response to the crisis. 
The numbers are heartbreaking. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the over 
315,000 families who have lost loved ones 
and the tens of thousand who are sick, and 
the many others who will struggle with the ef-
fects of COVID–19 over the coming days, 
weeks, months, and years. 
We owe a special debt to first responders 
who are the lifelines for those who are very ill 
or who will need medical care to overcome 
this coronavirus. 
The need to begin work on the next aid 
package is evident in the economic impact of 
COVID–19. 
Congress and the Executive Branch must 
be able to manage more than one crisis at a 
time, while avoiding crisis management deci-
sion making when possible. 
The Obama Administration exemplified what 
a President and a Congress working in con-
cert can accomplish. 
The first two years of Obama’s Administra-
tion had Democrats in charge of the House 
and Senate, which made it possible for the 
Legislative and Executive Branches to work in 
concert to attack and repel the economic dis-
aster the nation faced from the housing value 
collapse; and addressing health care dispari-
ties by passing the Affordable Care Act both 
of which saved millions from economic dis-
aster and saved tens of thousands of lives. 
The Obama Administration had a flu pan-
demic in 2009 and Ebola that threatened to 
become endemic in 2013. 
Both of these global health emergencies 
were expertly managed and because of this 
most Americans cannot recall the threat. 
President Obama had to deal with an eco-
logical disaster in the form of the Deep Hori-
zon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threat-
ened the environment and delicate hatcheries 
for sea turtles and the tourism industry long 
the coast. 
Both the turtles and tourism were saved, 
and as with the flu pandemic and Ebola crisis 
most Americans cannot recall the incident, be-
cause their lives were not overly disrupted and 
the problems were addressed effectively. 
That is the sign of a good president be-
cause he kept American safe. 
When President Obama left office on Janu-
ary 20, 2017, unemployment was at 4. 7 per-
cent; but today, due to the mismanagement of 
the COVID–19 pandemic by President Trump 
and Republicans, unemployment skyrocketed 
to 8.4 percent and currently stands at 6.7 per-
cent. 
When Trump took office in January 2017, 
there were 241,000 initial unemployment in-
surance (UI) claims for the week ending Janu-
ary 28, 2017 and at the beginning of the 116th 
Congress 
in 
January 
2019, 
there 
were 
236,000 initial UI claims. 
Today, due to the mismanagement of the 
COVID–19 pandemic by President Trump and 
Republicans, there were 885,000 initial UI 
claims for the week ending December 12, 
2020. 
Approximately 30 million Americans have 
lost the job they had earlier this year because 
of this Administration’s ineptitude and cavalier 
regard for the well-being of the American peo-
ple. 
During President Obama’s last full year in 
office in 2016, the national debt was $20.02 
trillion but due to the misguided economic poli-
cies and utter mismanagement of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, the national debt has increased 
by $6.7 trillion and is projected to reach an all- 
time high of $29.6 trillion by the end of the 
FY2021 fiscal year. 
The annual deficit had been cut to $585 bil-
lion (3.2 percent of GDP) in the last year of 
the Obama Administration but under the mis-
management of the current Administration, we 
have seen the deficit balloon nearly seven-fold 
to $3.1 trillion or 15.2 percent GDP, the larg-
est since 1945 relative to the size of the econ-
omy. 
Continuing this Administration’s unbroken 
chain of woe, in 2019, after repeated attempts 
by Republicans to undermine and sabotage 
the Affordable Care Act, there were 33.2 mil-
lion uninsured Americans, 5 million more than 
when President Obama left office. 
It has been estimated by reputable experts 
that from February 2020 through May 2020 
alone, an estimated 5.4 million Americans be-
came uninsured because of unprecedented 
job loss caused by the Republican mis-
management of this pandemic. 
Given the wreckage to the economy and the 
damage to the lives and livelihoods of the 
American people, it is unconscionable that this 
Administration is pursuing a lawsuit to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act, which would 
take health care coverage away from 20 mil-
lion Americans and take away protections for 
132 million persons who have pre-existing 
conditions. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
members of the Rules Committee to join me 
by voting for a rule to bring the bill to the floor 
today. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON), my very good 
friend. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
think 
it 
was 
Winston 
Churchill who said you can always 
count on Americans to do the right 
thing after they have exhausted all 
other options. 
You know, Congress looks that way 
to me from time to time. This is not 
the process or the timeline or the 
structure I have argued for. This 
COVID–19 package doesn’t have all the 
provisions that I have asked for. It is 
clearly not a perfect bill. 
Yet, it is the targeted and focused re-
lief that our country needs. It follows 
the framework that a bipartisan group 
of eight Senators and eight House 
Members, including myself, unveiled a 
few weeks ago. 
We knew then that it was not a per-
fect bill, but we knew it was the way 
forward. I am proud of the role that I 
have played and that the Problem 
Solvers Caucus has played in breaking 
this gridlock. I am proud of the role 
that we have played in making sure 
that our economy and our schools can 
stay open and that our testing and our 
vaccine deployment can be ramped up. 
Madam Speaker, this has been a 
messy week, but this is a good day for 
America. 
Ms. 
SHALALA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
thank you for your kind words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
CROW). 
b 1645 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I grew 
up knowing what it felt like to strug-
gle financially, that fear and anxiety of 
not knowing where your next rent 
check would come from, working a 
shift at Arby’s or a 14-hour day on the 
construction site and still not making 
ends meet. That is why I am voting for 
this bill. 
As imperfect as it is—and there are 
plenty of things that are not in this 
bill that should be—it will provide im-
mediate relief for millions of families 
and small businesses that simply can’t 
wait any longer, including those that 
are left out of prior rounds of relief. 
For example, my district is one of 
the most diverse districts in the Nation 
and home to thousands of refugees and 
immigrants. That is why I have been 
fighting hard to get payments to 
mixed-status ITIN families in this bill. 
We have been successful in doing that. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with the Biden administration 
to provide more relief in the coming 
months so that we can tackle this cri-
sis together. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR).

lation to deliver more resources to the

American people to defeat the COVID– 
19 virus and provide much-needed relief 
from government-imposed lockdowns 
of the economy. 
Ultimately, no amount of govern-
ment spending can substitute for a 
fully functioning, open economy free of 
government lockdowns. But I am con-
fident this relief package, which pro-
vides over $284 billion to reload and 
strengthen the Paycheck Protection 
Program, will help bridge the gap until 
COVID–19 vaccines are widely distrib-
uted. It does so in a fiscally responsible 
way by rescinding and reallocating $429 
billion in Federal Reserve emergency 
lending authority, and it repurposes 
unused PPP funds. 
Importantly, this bill provides effec-
tive, targeted relief, with a net price 
tag of approximately $325 billion in 
new outlays. It does not include the 
liberal wish list that was the center-
piece of the Speaker’s originally $3.4 
trillion Heroes Act, a fiscally reckless 
proposal that needlessly delayed this 
reasonable bipartisan compromise. 
For months, I have called on Con-
gress and the administration to sim-
plify the PPP forgiveness application 
for small businesses to ease their bur-
dens and ensure lender participation. 
Today, that goal becomes a reality. 
I also support the bill’s extension of 
troubled 
debt 
restructuring 
relief, 
which allows lenders to work with 
their borrowers to modify loans. And I 
strongly support its provision to en-
sure small businesses can deduct ex-
penses covered by PPP loans. 
While it has taken far too long to get 
to this point, the bill we are passing 
today will bring much-needed help to 
American workers, families, and small 
businesses, without putting more mas-
sive amounts of debt on the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this legislation. 
To be clear, this package is nowhere 
near enough. House Democrats passed 
three times more relief in May; our Re-
publican colleagues did nothing. We 
passed more than double this 2 months 
ago; our Republican colleagues did 
nothing. 
This package is not commensurate to 
the magnitude of the crisis we face. We 
need to do more, including vital aid to 
State and local governments and help 
for our restaurant industry, but this is 
a start. 
This legislation includes important 
funding 
for 
vaccine 
distribution, 
schools, small businesses, and a des-
perately needed extension of unem-
ployment insurance. 
I am pleased that this legislation 
also extends clean energy tax credits, 
provides disaster tax assistance, helps 
prevent tragic flame jetting accidents, 
and provides help for the hardworking 
men and women in my district and 
across this country. 
Madam Speaker, this is not enough, 
but it is a start. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to 
quickly respond to my friend from 
California. It is just, frankly, not accu-
rate to say Republicans did nothing. 
The reality is Democrats in the Sen-
ate did nothing. They were offered a 
bill about the size of this bill. Actually, 
it was a little bit larger—as I recall, it 
was about a trillion dollars—than this 
bill, and they wouldn’t allow it to come 
to the floor to be heard. 
This deal has been on the table since 
July. My friends chose to hold it up, 
for whatever reason—be it political or 
in hopes of getting a better deal—and 
they prolonged the suffering of the 
American people, and I regret that. 
But we are here today. We have 
worked together. We have got all the 
appropriations bills done. I am proud of 
that. We have got a good relief package 
here. I am proud of that. We have 
taken care of some important issues. 
I see my friend, the chairman of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. He had 
a lot to do with that, on surprise med-
ical billing. That is a bipartisan ac-
complishment and achievement. 
So let’s build on the things that we 
have and see what we need to do in the 
next Congress. 
But, again, for one side to point fin-
gers at the other here is just simply, in 
my view, not appropriate. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Ways and Means. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, let me 
proceed with acknowledging that this 
legislation had many crucial elements 
that were developed and constructed by 
the Committee on Ways and Means on 
a bipartisan basis. 
We expanded on unemployment in-
surance. We provided an additional 
supplement of $300 a week. We ex-
panded the retention tax credit, which 
was very important. We maintained 
and expanded the EITC and the child 
credit. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
DONNA SHALALA, because perhaps one 
of the most important elements in this 
successful piece of legislation was ad-
dressing surprise medical billing. She 
supported my position on this from day 
one, and she couldn’t have been more 
earnest. She has been a terrific Mem-
ber of this House. 
We provide direct payments. We pro-
vide assistance in terms of tax extend-
ers. We add a really good job on the re-
newable tax credits as well, and we ex-
pand eligibility for a round of checks 
to include people in mixed-status fami-
lies. 
Many of these pieces of legislation 
people said couldn’t happen and, in-
deed, they did. 
We addressed those who are most vul-
nerable. 
And, the truth is, we also give Joe 
Biden a chance after January 20, be-
cause of the duration of this legisla-
tion, to provide what we all know is 
going to be a plan for additional assist-
ance to members of the American fam-
ily. 
Madam Speaker, there are 20 million 
Americans collecting unemployment 
insurance right now in America. For 
people at the lower end of the economic 
spectrum, this has been cruel and cal-
lous. We need to come to their assist-
ance. 
People with white-collar jobs, they 
have held on and their unemployment 
rate is significantly less. But we know 
how stubborn this problem is, and until 
we defeat the virus, it is hard to see 
how we get to a full economic recovery. 
I hope that the argument will not be, 
once Mr. Biden takes the oath, that we 
need to proceed to austerity. What we 
do in this legislation with these checks 
is we provide additional liquidity, 
which then provides additional demand 
for people at the lower end of the eco-
nomic spectrum. 
This is a very good piece of legisla-
tion. I am very proud of what the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means did to help 
get us to this day. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the rule and the un-
derlying COVID relief package: 
Another $284 billion for PPP loans for 
small businesses that have been hurt-
ing 
for 
so 
long, 
particularly 
res-
taurants that are struggling. Finally, 
Main Street will get some help. We 
bailed out Wall Street a long time ago 
and all the big guys; now we have got 
to bail out Main Street. 
$20 billion in EIDL grants for small 
businesses; another $600 in stimulus 
checks for individuals and children. It 
should have been $1,200, but we will 
take the $600 now, and we will be back 
after January 20. 
$300 for unemployment benefits. It 
should have been a little bit more. You 
can’t live on $300. 
$13 billion for SNAP. People are 
starving, the lines are longer, made up 
of families and children. 
$14 billion for public transit, in addi-
tion to $4 billion for the MTA. The 
MTA has a $12 billion gap. We will be 
back for the rest of that money. 
$68 billion for purchasing vaccines, 
and $20 billion for distributing them. 
Broadband. 
And, finally, Madam Speaker, $4 bil-
lion for Gavi, an international vaccine 
distribution alliance, because it is not 
an epidemic; it is a pandemic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. We will not be free 
of COVID unless the rest of the world 
is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7297 
December 21, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
House 
Democrats 
took the necessary action to defeat 
this virus and restore the economy in 
May, but MITCH MCCONNELL said let’s 
hit the pause button. So Americans 
have waited 7 long months for the GOP 
to take action to end their suffering. 
As over 300,000 Americans lost their 
lives, they said more testing was not 
necessary. 
As veterans and children waited in 
lines at food banks, they proposed a 
tax credit for business lunches. 
As 8 million more Americans fell into 
poverty, they proposed cutting unem-
ployment benefits. 
As one out of four women have lost 
their jobs and have left the workforce, 
they fought to limit paid leave and ac-
cess to childcare. 
As 40 million Americans teeter on 
the verge of homelessness, they fought 
to shield corporations from negligence 
and deny workers basic safety protec-
tions. 
This bill is too little too late, but it 
is a lifesaving bridge to a better time 
and a new President who will focus on 
restoring Americans’ jobs and their 
health. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I beg to differ with 
my good friend from Massachusetts. It 
wasn’t Republicans who did nothing; it 
was Democrats who did nothing. 
The Senate actually offered a tril-
lion-dollar package in July. We are 
here approving a $900 billion package 
today. 
The President of the United States 
offered a $1.8 trillion package at one 
point. We are approving a $900 billion 
package today. 
Now, we may do more later, but the 
reality is my friends drug this out all 
summer long. We could have had a 
package very similar to what we had 
many months ago. That would have 
helped 
unemployed 
Americans. 
It 
would have helped Americans with 
small businesses. It would have reas-
sured the economy. My friends chose 
not to do that. 
I am glad, since the election, they 
have decided to bargain in good faith. 
We have bargained in good faith. We 
have what we think is a good product 
in front of us. But if we want to write 
history, we have a considerably dif-
ferent version of it than has been por-
trayed on the floor here today, put in 
front of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I also just want to 
add for the record that, while we are 
busy bashing the President, I haven’t 
heard too many people thank the 
President of the United States for Op-
eration Warp Speed, unprecedented tri-
umphs to actually deliver a vaccine in 
less than a year. All the critics said, 
not possible. The President deserves 
credit for that, and so does his admin-
istration. 
That is something that all of us, re-
gardless of party and partisanship, 
should be proud of; and, frankly, it is 
something we owe the President a 
great deal of gratitude for. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, let 
me remind my distinguished colleague 
from Oklahoma that we sent the He-
roes Act in May. 
And while I agree that the adminis-
tration should get some credit for Op-
eration Warp Speed, as I have pointed 
out, it has been decades of investment 
in the science that led to Operation 
Warp Speed. 
Many of us would have appreciated, 
and we would have saved lives, if we 
had made the same kind of investments 
in testing so that we had an instant 
test, and we would have ended up sav-
ing lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
they said it couldn’t be done, that 
Democrats and Republicans could actu-
ally come together, not only in the 
House, but in the Senate, too, and pass 
a COVID–19 emergency relief package. 
But, finally, after 9 months, it is about 
to happen. We are about to cross the 
finish line. This is as close to a Christ-
mas miracle as you can find in a nor-
mally polarized Washington. 
b 1700 
With the virus raging across the Na-
tion, the 50–Member strong bipartisan 
Problem Solvers Caucus put country 
over party and helped craft a package 
that will help put food on the table, 
distribute vaccines to our commu-
nities, save our struggling small busi-
nesses, put money in the pockets of 
American families, and help keep fami-
lies in their homes. 
This 
emergency 
relief 
package 
wouldn’t have happened without the 
weeks of hard work from the Problem 
Solvers Caucus and a bipartisan group 
of Senators who put country ahead of 
party to help our families, small busi-
nesses, and communities. This was 
truly a model for how we should govern 
in Washington. 
This marks a critical downpayment 
in our ongoing fight against COVID. If 
you look in New Jersey, where 1 in 500 
have lost their lives, and 30 percent of 
small businesses are out, we clearly 
have more work to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, 
which is a critical step forward. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to agree with the distin-
guished gentlewoman from Florida, my 
good friend, about the investments in 
NIH. I want to remind her that it was 
Newt Gingrich and John Porter who 
doubled the NIH during the Clinton 
years, who actually put more money in 
there 
than 
the 
administration 
re-
quested. 
I will also remind my good friend 
that when I was chairman, we put more 
money in than the Obama administra-
tion requested; and we continued to do 
more money than the Trump adminis-
tration requested, which actually re-
quested some cuts. 
So the reality is that Congress—on a 
bipartisan basis, I must say, because I 
had the support of my ranking mem-
ber, now our distinguished chairwoman 
of the Labor, Health, and Human Serv-
ices Subcommittee, ROSA DELAURO, in 
those decisions—Congress, but particu-
larly Republicans, have made those in-
vestments over the years. 
And I think the country—I agree 
with my friend—has reaped enormous 
benefits from that. I hope we continue 
down that road in the next Congress 
with the next administration. I am 
looking forward to that possibility. 
But I simply wanted to let the record 
reflect what the contribution from our 
side of the aisle has been in that re-
gard. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t disagree with my colleague, but 
it was bipartisan, and I think that is 
the important thing about those in-
vestments over the years. 
My point was it was those invest-
ments that made it possible for Oper-
ation Warp Speed. I never suggested 
that it was one party versus another 
that made that bipartisan investment. 
It has been decades of bipartisan in-
vestments that have made a difference. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. 
BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for yielding. 
I rise today to support this legisla-
tion because my constituents des-
perately need the unemployment bene-
fits, the stimulus checks, the food as-
sistance, the eviction moratoriums, the 
small business Minority Development 
Institution funds and the CDFI assist-
ance funds, and other protections in 
this bill. 
Seven months after the House passed 
the Heroes Act, Republicans have fi-
nally relented to allow more support to 
the American people who are strug-
gling through the three pandemics: 
COVID–19, economic hardships, and so-
cial injustices. 
So let me be clear: The GOP has had 
a knee on Americans’ necks by holding 
this bill up, and it still falls short of 
what we need to get through this crisis. 
But I will continue to stand up for 
my constituents of the Third Congres-
sional District and for people across 
this Nation and my colleagues to work 
with the Biden administration to get 
people the support they need to build 
back better. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to remind my friends who en-
gage in revisionist history, we haven’t

December 21, 2020 
held anything up. The Senate put a $1 
trillion offer on the table back in July. 
My friends didn’t think that was good 
enough. The President put a $1.8 tril-
lion deal on the table. They didn’t 
think that was good enough. 
We are here now with a bipartisan, 
good bill. We may need to do more 
later. We will see. But the reality is 
our friends held unrealistic positions 
with a lot of policy riders on them that 
they knew were never going to be ac-
cepted, and they did that throughout 
the election season. 
Fine. The election is over. All of a 
sudden we are back and we are able to 
compromise 
after 
the 
election. 
It 
would have been better for the Amer-
ican people had we done that back in 
July. My friends chose a different path, 
but I am glad they have changed their 
mind since the election. I am glad we 
have something in front of us that is 
genuinely bipartisan. We will pass it on 
a bipartisan basis today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
The agreement before us today recog-
nizes that to get our economy moving 
again, to return to something that 
feels like normalcy, we must get this 
virus under control. 
In this agreement, Democrats se-
cured billions to rapidly distribute a 
free and safe vaccine and to invest in 
nationwide testing and tracing meas-
ures that will save lives. 
It isn’t perfect, and more action is re-
quired to address the challenges that 
Americans are facing, but it is every-
thing we can do right now with this 
Senate and this President. 
With this bill, we have averted a sud-
den end to unemployment benefits that 
millions would have faced and added 
$300 per week to the benefit. 
We funded a new round of survival 
checks and emergency rental assist-
ance, included an eviction moratorium, 
and boosted SNAP and child nutrition 
benefits. 
And for the small businesses strug-
gling to keep the lights on, this bill 
provides billions in economic assist-
ance to forgivable loans. 
Across this country, people in com-
munities like mine are hurting. Frank-
ly, they have been hurting for far too 
long. 
We are going to work with the Biden- 
Harris administration to build on this 
progress and deliver for the American 
people, and I am confident that bright-
er days are ahead. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I begin by saying 
what a privilege it has been to serve 
with my good friend from Florida these 
last 2 years, not only in Congress, but 
most especially on the Rules Com-
mittee. And what a particular pleasure 
it is for me to have the opportunity to 
manage and work with her on her very 
last rule on the floor. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, I thank 
all my colleagues for their consider-
ation 
of 
this 
bipartisan 
package. 
Though it has taken us a long time to 
get to this particular point, it is a real 
bipartisan compromise. And I think, at 
the end of the day, it will pass with a 
substantial bipartisan vote and it will 
benefit every American. 
The package today will fully fund the 
government through September 30th of 
2021, and will ensure that taxpayer dol-
lars are spent where they are needed 
most. I think that is an important 
point because, lost in all of this, the 
appropriations process has actually 
done what it was supposed to do. 
I compliment my friends on the Ap-
propriations Committee; particularly 
our distinguished chair, Mrs. LOWEY, 
and our distinguished ranking member, 
Ms. GRANGER. They brought all 12 bills 
through the committee. They got a full 
committee process. They were reported 
out of committee. Ten of those bills 
came to the floor. On the floor, those 
bills got full consideration. We sat and 
bargained with our friends in the 
United States Senate, and now I have 
brought these bills back. That is the 
way Congress ought to work. I am 
proud the Appropriations Committee 
worked that way. 
We also will be taking up in this par-
ticular bill a pandemic relief bill, en-
suring extensions for programs like un-
employment insurance and the Pay-
check Protection Program, which will 
protect millions of Americans who 
have lost their jobs and lost income as 
a result of this pandemic. 
The package is a very important 
package. And we have some disagree-
ments on it. We have had some back 
and forth on it in the last several 
months, but still, at the end of the day, 
we have come together, we have done 
something important, and I think we 
have set the stage for perhaps some-
thing later in the next Congress. We 
will see. But this is an important relief 
measure for the American people, and I 
certainly urge all my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support it. 
Finally, the package also includes a 
bipartisan 
compromise 
on 
surprise 
medical billing and a number of issues 
to provide targeted tax relief to people 
who 
have 
suffered 
through 
the 
coronavirus crisis and particular indus-
tries. I think that is appropriate. I 
thank my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle and multiple committees that 
have been part of that particular com-
promise. 
Madam Speaker, it is often said on 
this floor that it is not a perfect bill, 
but a $900 billion relief package that is 
badly needed to the American people 
close to Christmas Eve is something 
that every Member on this floor ought 
to be proud of, and I hope every Mem-
ber in this Chamber will see fit to sup-
port. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and, 
most importantly, to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
underlying measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. COLE, for 
his generous remarks. I agree with 
him, this is a bipartisan bill that is not 
perfect. I don’t think anyone in this 
Chamber believes that it is perfect. 
Madam Speaker, the time to pass 
this bill was yesterday. It was 6 months 
ago. We pray that most Americans will 
be able to get a vaccine to stop this 
killer. But it is not just Americans. To 
be safe, people around the world must 
get the vaccine. 
There will be a lot of darkness before 
enough Americans and people around 
the world have the vaccine to bring our 
lives back to normal. Before that time, 
the government must help. 
By the way, it is not our money. It is 
the people in our communities who 
have been paying taxes for years. We 
are taking the resources back to them. 
We have to help the unemployed, the 
shuttered 
small 
businesses, 
the 
strained hospitals, and, most impor-
tantly, the hungry child. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and the previous 
question. 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today dur-
ing a critical time in the history of the nation. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
315,000 Americans have died, as a result of 
the Administration’s mismanagement of the 
federal response to COVID–19. 
It has especially impacted the African Amer-
ican community and other communities of 
color. 
Millions of jobs have been lost, countless 
small businesses have closed, and many oth-
ers hospitalized. 
For the sake of controlling the virus we have 
all quarantined, as we eagerly await a vac-
cine. 
It is against this backdrop that we fashion a 
relief bill. 
Scripture teaches that which you do for the 
least of these you do for Him. 
I am proud to fight for the least of these dur-
ing these critical times and support this bipar-
tisan solution for COVID and the budget. 
I want to commend all leaders who helped 
make this deal possible, especially Speaker 
NANCY
PELOSI, Leader STENY
HOYER
and 
Democratic 
Caucus 
Chairman 
HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES. 
This bill is critical as it helps all those im-
pacted by COVID, especially the black people 
and other communities of color that have been 
disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. 
I am proud to support this bill, which pro-
vides $900 billion for COVID relief. 
This is important as the agreement outlined 
provides another round of $600 in economic 
stimulus checks and another $300 per-week in 
unemployment benefits, and it supports small 
businesses, which are the engines of our 
economy. 
It also provides funds to support local 
school districts and provides much-needed 
funds for coronavirus testing and vaccine dis-
tribution.

December 21, 2020 
I am also proud to help secure this legisla-
tion because it supports paid sick leave, pro-
vides 25 billion in rent relief and an extension 
of the eviction moratorium. 
This relief bill is going in the right direction 
but make no mistake, this is not enough and 
must only be a down-payment. 
The $1,200 stimulus checks in the CARES 
Act from earlier this year was an important 
factor in controlling the economic fallout from 
the initial onset of the coronavirus, and I am 
disappointed that tonight that this Congress 
will not now act as we did in the Spring. 
The situation is more dire now and calls for 
more—not less—economic stimulus. 
And, I am especially proud that the dis-
bursements from this relief bill starts on the 
first day of Kwanzaa, December 26. 
And, critically, this legislation supports Com-
munity Development Financial Institutions and 
Minority Depository Institutions by as much as 
$12 billion: 
The agreement includes dedicated PPP set- 
asides for very small businesses and lending 
through community-based lenders like Com-
munity 
Development 
Financial 
Institutions 
(CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions 
(MDIs); $9 billion in emergency U.S. Treasury 
capital investments in CDFIs and MDIs to sup-
port lending in low-income and underserved 
communities, 
including 
persistent 
poverty 
counties, that may be disproportionately im-
pacted by the economic effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic; and $3 billion in emergency 
support for CDFIs through the CDFI Fund to 
respond to the economic impact of the pan-
demic on underserved low-income and minor-
ity communities. 
The legislation we will pass today also in-
cludes 4.2 billion for mental health and sub-
stance abuse help and another $7 billion for 
broadband. 
This bill includes SBA grants, not just loans 
so it is critical for all applicants that they com-
plete paperwork accurately so that there is no 
delay in submitting paperwork. 
I encourage all constituents to reach out to 
my office if they need help. 
And the legislation we will pass today also 
allocates $1.4 trillion for the budget which is 
why we must consider the COVID relief bill 
today together with the budget bill. 
This bill also helps secure $10 billion for as-
sistance in child-care to help get parents back 
to work so we can be ready to return to some 
semblance of normalcy. 
I am also proud to support this bill because 
this legislation supports paid sick leave, pro-
vides tens of billions in rent relief and an ex-
tension of the eviction moratorium, another 
$14 billion in SNAP benefits and $80 billion in 
funding for our colleges and universities.’’ 
It is often said that our budget is a blueprint 
of our values and with the budget we pass 
today, Madam Speaker, is an affirmation of 
the Gospel of Matthew. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

sert the following:

PARENCY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 351(k) of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)) is amended 
by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(9) PUBLIC LISTING.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(i) INITIAL PUBLICATION.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of enactment of the Purple 
Book Continuity Act of 2020, the Secretary shall 
publish and make available to the public in a 
searchable, electronic format— 
‘‘(I) a list of each biological product, by non-
proprietary name (proper name), for which, as 
of such date of enactment, a biologics license 
under subsection (a) or this subsection is in ef-
fect, or that, as of such date of enactment, is 
deemed to be licensed under this section pursu-
ant to section 7002(e)(4) of the Biologics Price

lication of the first list under clause (i), the Sec-
retary shall revise the list to include each bio-
logical product which has been licensed under 
subsection (a) or this subsection during the 30- 
day period or deemed licensed under this section 
pursuant to section 7002(e)(4) of the Biologics 
Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. 
‘‘(iii) PATENT INFORMATION.—Not later than 
30 days after a list of patents under subsection 
(l)(3)(A), or a supplement to such list under sub-
section (l)(7), has been provided by the reference 
product sponsor to the subsection (k) applicant 
respecting a biological product included on the 
list published under this subparagraph, the ref-
erence product sponsor shall provide such list of

clause (ii), include such information for such bi-
ological product. Within 30 days of providing 
any subsequent or supplemental list of patents 
to any subsequent subsection (k) applicant 
under subsection (l)(3)(A) or (l)(7), the reference 
product sponsor shall update the information 
provided to the Secretary under this clause with 
any additional patents from such subsequent or 
supplemental list and their corresponding expiry 
dates. 
‘‘(iv) LISTING OF EXCLUSIVITIES.—For each bi-
ological product included on the list published

LI-
CENSE.—If the license of a biological product is 
determined by the Secretary to have been re-
voked or suspended for safety, purity, or po-
tency reasons, it may not be published in the list 
under subparagraph (A). If such revocation or 
suspension occurred after inclusion of such bio-
logical product in the list published under sub-
paragraph (A), the reference product sponsor 
shall notify the Secretary that— 
‘‘(i) the biological product shall be imme-
diately removed from such list for the same pe-
riod as the revocation or suspension; and 
‘‘(ii) a notice of the removal shall be published 
in the Federal Register.’’.

MATION TO BE LISTED.—Not later than 3 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services shall—

(a); and

UNITED STATES-MEXICO 
ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ACT 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 1271, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 133) to promote economic 
partnership and cooperation between 
the United States and Mexico, with the 
Senate amendment thereto, and ask for 
its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the Senate amend-
ment. 
Senate amendment: 
Strike out all after the enacting clause and 
insert: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States- 
Mexico Economic Partnership Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States and Mexico have bene-
fitted from a bilateral, mutually beneficial part-
nership focused on advancing the economic in-
terests of both countries. 
(2) In 2013, Mexico adopted major energy re-
forms that opened its energy sector to private in-
vestment, increasing energy cooperation be-
tween Mexico and the United States and open-
ing new opportunities for United States energy 
engagement. 
(3) On January 18, 2018, the Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cul-
tural Affairs at the Department of State stated, 
‘‘Our exchange programs build enduring rela-
tionships and networks to advance U.S. na-
tional interests and foreign policy goals . . . 
The role of our exchanges . . . in advancing 
U.S. national security and economic interests 
enjoys broad bipartisan support from Congress 
and other stakeholders, and provides a strong 
return on investment.’’. 
(4) According to the Institute of International 
Education, in the 2015–2016 academic year, more 
than 56,000 United States students studied in 
other countries in the Western Hemisphere re-
gion while more than 84,000 non-United States 
students from the region studied in the United 
States, but only 5,000 of those United States stu-
dents studied in Mexico and only 16,000 of those 
non-United States students were from Mexico. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to continue deepening economic coopera-
tion between the United States and Mexico; 
(2) to seek to prioritize and expand edu-
cational and professional exchange programs 
with Mexico, including through frameworks 
such as the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Ini-
tiative, the Young Leaders of the Americas Ini-
tiative, Jo´venes en Accio´n (Youth in Action), 
the Fulbright Foreign Student Program, and the 
Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program; and 
(3) to promote positive cross-border relations 
as a priority for advancing United States for-
eign policy and programs. 
SEC. 4. STRATEGY TO PRIORITIZE AND EXPAND 
EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH MEX-
ICO. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State shall 
develop a strategy to carry out the policy de-
scribed in section 3, to include prioritizing and 
expanding educational and professional ex-
change programs with Mexico through frame-
works such as those referred to in section 3(2). 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The strategy required under 
subsection (a) shall— 
(1) encourage more academic exchanges be-
tween the United States and Mexico at the sec-
ondary, post-secondary, and post-graduate lev-
els; 
(2) encourage United States and Mexican aca-
demic institutions and businesses to collaborate 
to assist prospective and developing entre-
preneurs in strengthening their business skills 
and promoting cooperation and joint business 
initiatives across the United States and Mexico; 
(3) promote energy infrastructure coordina-
tion and cooperation through support of voca-
tional-level education, internships, and ex-
changes between the United States and Mexico; 
and 
(4) assess the feasibility of fostering partner-
ships between universities in the United States 
and medical school and nursing programs in 
Mexico to ensure that medical school and nurs-
ing programs in Mexico have comparable ac-
creditation standards as medical school and 
nursing programs in the United States by the 
Accreditation and Standards in Foreign Medical 
Education, in addition to the Accreditation 
Commission For Education in Nursing, so that 
medical students can pass medical licensing 
board exams, and nursing students can pass 
nursing licensing exams, in the United States. 
(c) BRIEFING.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall brief the appropriate con-
gressional committees regarding the strategy re-
quired under subsection (a). 
SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘appropriate congres-
sional committees’’ means—

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mrs. Lowey moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 133 with an 
amendment consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 116–68. 
(For text of the House amendment to 
the Senate amendment, see Book II of 
this RECORD.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1271, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for one hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude 
extraneous 
material 
on 
the 
House 
amendment 
to 
the 
Senate 
amendment to H.R. 133. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to present 
legislation that comprises all 12 fiscal 
year 2021 appropriations bills, a num-
ber of items agreed to on a bipartisan 
basis between authorizing committees, 
and a coronavirus relief package. 
The 12 appropriations bills include a 
strong increase in nondefense discre-
tionary funding, allowing Congress to 
make important investments for the 
people. 
I am particularly proud that we have 
been able to fund better education for 
our students; more affordable housing; 
food security initiatives; safer commu-
nities, with funding to address Amer-
ica’s gun violence epidemic; clean air 
and water; action on the climate crisis; 
and care for our veterans, with a spe-
cial emphasis on suicide prevention 
and gender-specific care. 
As chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on State, Foreign Operations, and Re-
lated Programs, I am also proud that 
this legislation bolsters international 
security and stability. In particular, 
the Middle East Partnership for Peace 
fund will support people-to-people ex-
changes and economic partnerships be-
tween Israelis and Palestinians. 
Turning to the coronavirus relief por-
tion of the legislation, the bill provides 
$892 billion to confront the pandemic. 
While 
Republican 
intransigence 
means the legislation doesn’t include 
the State and local relief that is des-
perately needed, the amounts it pro-
vides for education, public health, and 
transportation will greatly benefit our 
local communities. 
Of particular importance to me, the 
$4 billion for GAVI will help children

December 21, 2020 
across 
the 
world 
receive 
the 
coronavirus vaccine, though far greater 
investments are needed to support 
international COVID–19 response. 
President-elect 
Biden 
has 
spoken 
about the dark winter that we face be-
cause of this pandemic. It is my hope 
that this bill will be a source of light 
as we face that winter. 
I am proud that, through the careful 
use of Federal funds, the appropria-
tions in this bill will help set our Na-
tion on a course to build back better. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this bill that will provide funding for 
the Federal Government through the 
end of the fiscal year as well as provide 
another round of desperately needed re-
lief 
for 
those 
affected 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
The appropriations package we will 
consider today is critical because it 
will allow us to prevent an unnecessary 
government shutdown and avoid a 
wasteful continuing resolution that 
simply straight-lines funding until the 
end of next year. 
The bill makes us safer by ensuring 
we have the funding and the tools nec-
essary to both discourage our enemies 
and defend ourselves against them. 
The funds provided in this bill are 
also critical to continue the fight 
against public health threats both at 
home and abroad. 
The bill ensures that longstanding 
provisions to protect life, reduce bur-
densome regulation, and preserve our 
way of life are retained. 
I would like to highlight some spe-
cific programs in the appropriations 
package. 
This bill supports another significant 
increase for the National Institutes of 
Health, including funding for vital re-
search on Alzheimer’s disease and to 
find cures for cancer. 
It provides more than half a billion 
dollars for NASA, to help maintain our 
superiority in space. We will need to 
continue to do more in future years to 
establish a sustainable presence on the 
Moon. 
The bill also funds the U.S. Space 
Force so the United States has a lead-
ing edge against China and Russia. 
The bill keeps us safe by providing 
the same level of funding as last year 
for the border wall. It also rolls back 
attempts to limit the President’s au-
thority to provide additional funds, if 
needed. 
The bill continues to rebuild our 
military, modernize our nuclear weap-
ons stockpile, and strengthen our al-
lies, such as Israel. This bill strongly 
supports our veterans and our troops 
by increasing pay for our military; ad-
dressing the healthcare needs of our 
brave warfighters and their families, as 
well as those who previously served; 
and ensuring that the United States 
military has cutting-edge equipment, 
such as the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter 
and the V–22 Osprey, so that they can 
discourage and take on any fight 
against our enemies. 
The bill retains longstanding Second 
Amendment and pro-life protections 
that my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle wanted to eliminate. In fact, 
it secures the largest pro-life victory in 
a 
generation 
by 
maintaining 
the 
Trump administration’s Title X Fam-
ily Planning regulations. 
It drops the dangerous policy provi-
sions my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle included in the House bills, 
including riders aimed at defunding the 
police. 
Billions of dollars of unnecessary 
emergency spending that the majority 
included in their bills is stripped away 
in this package. Many of these provi-
sions are considered poison pills that 
were opposed by Republicans and the 
White House. 
Also before us today is another round 
of coronavirus relief. Specifically, our 
package will: ensure the timely dis-
tribution of vaccines across the coun-
try; help small businesses affected by 
the economic downturn; and provide 
much-needed relief for airports and the 
airline industry, which is so important 
for thousands of hardworking Texans 
in and around my district. 
I am glad we were able to come to-
gether on this agreement today, and I 
want to thank my colleagues, Mrs. 
LOWEY, Senator SHELBY, and Senator 
LEAHY, for working together in good 
faith. 
Plain and simple, this package is 
good for our economic security and our 
national security because it addresses 
the most pressing threats we face as a 
country. I hope it will be supported. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), the distinguished chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Energy 
and Water Development. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, America 
is grateful for Mrs. LOWEY’s years of 
honorable, dedicated, and enlightened 
service. We will so miss her leadership, 
bright smile, and affable nature. 
I would also like to thank Ranking 
Member SIMPSON, who has been a con-
stant and truly valued partner, as well 
as our wonderful subcommittee staff: 
Jaime Shimek, Scott McKee, Mark 
Arnone, Farouk Ophaso, and Mike 
Brain, who have labored tirelessly to 
produce this bill. 
The Energy and Water division of 
this bill captures the American spirit 
of ingenuity and national energy inde-
pendence. It provides the foundation of 
critical investments to meet the chal-
lenge of climate change, to which $12 
billion, or 24 percent of our overall bill, 
is dedicated. Without question, our En-
ergy and Water bill is this year’s most 
important climate change legislation, 
with our overall bill dedicated to sus-
taining life on Earth. 
Instead of the President’s short-
sighted and devastating cuts, our bill 
invests in the future to meet serious 
national priorities: real jobs, as we 
achieve building back better by pro-
viding $7.8 billion for the tremendous 
Army Corps of Engineers, $145 million 
above 2020; real innovation to invest 
into the future in partnership with our 
universities 
and 
private-sector 
innovators; providing $39.6 billion for 
the Department of Energy, $1 billion 
above 2020; real security within the De-
partment of Energy, as we responsibly 
fund a nuclear deterrent while boosting 
nonproliferation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. 
KAPTUR. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
we 
achieve real impact, as our bill in-
creases the Department’s Energy Effi-
ciency and Renewable Energy program, 
ARPA-E, Advanced Energy Research, 
and the Office of Science. 
In sum, the Energy and Water divi-
sion of this bill invests in innovative 
programs to yield future opportunities 
for new-age jobs. 
I don’t support the cuts in the ATVM 
program related to advanced tech-
nology for vehicles, but I will say that 
I support the legislation overall and be-
lieve that our bill is needed more than 
ever to heal our Nation and advance 
our leadership globally. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former chair-
man of the full committee and ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, 
but I want to first congratulate our 
committee’s chair and ranking member 
for their great work on putting to-
gether this enormous and enormously 
important bill. 
First, I want to say how rare this day 
really is in another way. It is the first 
time that we have had a ranking mem-
ber who is a female, Ms. GRANGER, and 
the first female chairman of the com-
mittee, NITA LOWEY. We will miss her 
enormously on this committee and in 
the Chamber. 
This bill is enormous. It is not per-
fect, but it reflects a fair compromise 
that includes funding for many impor-
tant priorities at home and abroad and 
vital assistance for all those negatively 
impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
As ranking member of the Com-
mittee on State, Foreign Operations, 
and Related Programs, I want to tell 
you, this bill provides critical funding 
for our national security. This includes 
$3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financ-
ing for Israel and robust support to 
combat transnational crime and the 
flow of illegal drugs. 
The bill is also tough on China, as it 
commits serious resources behind our 
Indo-Pacific strategy. This includes ex-
posing the censorship and propaganda 
wielded by the Chinese Communist

Party and countering Beijing’s debt- 
trap diplomacy through well-funded, 
open, and transparent U.S. develop-
ment by the Development Finance Cor-
poration and the Countering Chinese 
Influence Fund. 
This bill also protects our core val-
ues. It maintains all pro-life protec-
tions from last year and rejects efforts 
to undo the President’s historic poli-
cies that protect the sanctity of life. 
This bill is also great for my district 
in Kentucky, if I can be parochial. It 
provides the resources we need to con-
tinue to fight the opioid epidemic, 
which is now more important than 
ever. 
It fully funds my AML pilot program, 
which is truly breathing life back into 
my southern and eastern Kentucky 
communities. It helps our small busi-
nesses and so many Kentuckians who 
are fighting tooth and nail to survive 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
This package does not have every-
thing that we wanted, but it is a good 
bill, and I think a fair compromise. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues’ 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to wish everyone 
a merry Christmas. 
b 1830 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the distin-
guished majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, while 
today’s vote to provide relief to fami-
lies who are suffering due to cir-
cumstances far beyond their control is 
welcome, it is long overdue and insuffi-
cient to fully meet their needs. 
Democrats put forth our priorities 
last May to bring relief to those who 
are sick, unemployed, homeless, and 
hungry. Republicans instead chose to 
ignore and obfuscate the widespread 
suffering. 
This short-term package will provide 
direct payments and unemployment 
benefits extension and some assistance 
to help families afford rent, food, 
water, and broadband. I applaud our 
Speaker for negotiating these critical 
provisions and my colleagues who came 
together in a bipartisan way to drive 
this compromise, but this package 
must be viewed only as a downpay-
ment. 
Most of us can hardly wait to begin 
the new year with renewed hope. Our 
resolve as we come into 2021 with a new 
Congress and a new administration is 
to provide the leadership and support 
Americans need and deserve to get us 
beyond this pandemic. There can be no 
greater pursuit in 2021. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. SIMPSON), the ranking member of 
the Energy and Water Development, 
and Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the fiscal year 2021 
omnibus appropriations bill, and par-
ticularly the Energy and Water Devel-
opment and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act. 
As ranking member of the sub-
committee, I am pleased this bill is sig-
nificantly improved from the House 
bill in many ways. 
First and foremost, the bill strongly 
supports our national nuclear security 
programs, providing $15.3 billion for 
the Weapons Activities account, an in-
crease of $2.9 billion above fiscal year 
2020. This funding supports the mainte-
nance and modernization of our nu-
clear weapons system, which will en-
sure a credible and reliable nuclear de-
terrent. 
One of my personal priorities is pro-
moting innovation and growth in nu-
clear energy. This bill provides almost 
$1.4 billion for research, development, 
and demonstration activities, includ-
ing increased funding for the Advanced 
Small Modular Reactors Program and 
the Advanced Reactors Demonstration 
Program, both programs focused on 
building the next generation of carbon- 
free technologies to be deployed here 
and abroad. 
The bill also includes critical water 
storage projects in the drought-prone 
West, such as the Anderson Ranch Dam 
raise in my district in Idaho. 
Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I 
would like to thank the full committee 
ranking member, KAY GRANGER, who 
has so ably led our Republican Con-
ference on appropriations matters all 
Congress long. And full committee 
Chairwoman 
LOWEY
deserves 
our 
thanks for her many years of service in 
this committee and to the Nation. We 
will miss her. 
Energy and Water Development, and 
Related Agencies Chairwoman MARCY 
KAPTUR and I, again, worked well with 
our Senate partners, LAMAR
ALEX-
ANDER and DIANNE FEINSTEIN, to ad-
vance national and constituent inter-
ests throughout the programs that are 
funded in this bill. 
Finally, I would like to thank staff 
on both sides of the aisle for their hard 
work—extremely hard work—particu-
larly this last month, working to help 
bring this bill to completion. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
appropriations 
package, which includes the Energy 
and Water division, is a strong bill, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY), 
the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Defense, who has spent the last 35 
years in the Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, we all share his knowl-
edge, which he shares with us so will-
ingly, and we appreciate his service, 
not just to the committee, but to the 
Congress, to the country, and we wish 
him the very, very best. We thank him 
for his service in the Congress and on 
this committee. 
(Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding and 
her kind remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues support H.R. 133. 
The Defense portion of this bill con-
tinues to focus on the well-being and 
morale of those in uniform. For exam-
ple, the bill provides an additional $116 
million for upgrades to childcare facili-
ties and directs the military services to 
present innovative ideas to address the 
serious backlog for childcare. 
However, I must also share my con-
cerns over DOD and its lack of compli-
ance with many congressionally di-
rected reporting requirements. For ex-
ample, last year, the committee di-
rected the Department to submit a re-
port on its contracts for advertising 
services with socially and economi-
cally disadvantaged small businesses. 
The report was 5 months late. 
The Department has also habitually 
redirected funding in contravention of 
congressional intent. One DOD official 
referred to these transfers of billions of 
dollars as anomalies. I refer to them as 
habitual abuses. I hope in the future it 
will recognize Congress’ constitutional 
prerogatives. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, since it was 
mentioned, this will be my last floor 
statement after nearly 44 years of 
working in the House. I want to thank 
all of the wonderful staff who have 
made what successes we have enjoyed 
possible. 
I also want to thank my parents, 
John and Helen Visclosky, and my sis-
ter, Annamarie Visclosky, who be-
lieved in me when I was an unem-
ployed, young former staffer and made 
my incredible life journey possible. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CALVERT), the ranking 
member of the Defense Subcommittee. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this legislation. 
First, I want to thank Chairwoman 
LOWEY for her hard work and her dedi-
cation to this institution, and I wish 
her well in her retirement. 
And I certainly want to thank our 
ranking member for her hard work and 
all the things that went into getting 
this bill together. I know it is difficult. 
We certainly appreciate it. 
And, finally, Chairman PETE
VIS-
CLOSKY, not only my chairman, but my 
close friend, who has worked hard on 
this bill, and he has done a wonderful 
job over the years and is certainly a 
patriot who deserves the credit in put-
ting this Defense bill together. 
The Constitution grants Congress the 
explicit and sacred responsibility to 
provide for our Nation’s defense. This 
bill before us today does just that. It 
provides funding for many key pro-
grams consistent with the National De-
fense Strategy and its focus on great 
power competition with China and Rus-
sia. 
The bill prioritizes and funds pro-
grams essential to our continued mili-
tary dominance. It provides our com-
batant commanders with the resources 
and equipment they need to carry out 
their missions around the world. 
We continue key investments in 
fifth-generation combat aircraft, ships,

and 
two 
Virginia-class 
submarines, 
while also continuing to invest in the 
essential research and development of 
new technologies essential to main-
taining U.S. military superiority. 
We continue to prioritize the health 
and welfare of our men and women in 
uniform. The funding in this bill re-
flects the longstanding concerns that 
so many of our Members have had with 
Defense health programs, sexual as-
sault prevention, suicide prevention, 
and the long-awaited electronic health 
record, which we need to get fixed. 
We must get this bill signed into law 
as soon as possible. According to the 
DOD comptroller, a continuing resolu-
tion wastes $1.7 billion per month and 
stops many of the modernization prior-
ities that are the cornerstone of main-
taining our military’s superiority over 
near-peer threats such as China and 
Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we 
were 
able 
to 
overcome 
politically 
charged issues to negotiate this final 
passage. I urge all the Members to vote 
for it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair of 
the Subcommittee on Labor, Health 
and Human Services, Education, and 
Related Agencies, and now the chair of 
the full committee, where I know she 
will serve with her great knowledge 
with distinction. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from New York, and I 
hope to fill her shoes in what she has 
done to promote the welfare of the 
lives of the people of this country. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this 
bill. 
We are at a critical moment. We are 
not just living through a public health 
crisis, but an economic one; two crises, 
which have magnified existing inequal-
ities. 
Tens of millions of workers are un-
employed. Millions of families are fac-
ing hunger, many for the first time in 
their lives. Small businesses are going 
under, and over 300,000 Americans have 
lost their lives. 
The COVID relief package that we 
are voting on today is a start, and I 
thank my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives for elevating it to pro-
vide important relief. 
It brings back the enhanced Federal 
unemployment insurance, direct pay-
ments, a second round of PPP loans, 
$13 billion in emergency food assist-
ance, and a temporary boost to the 
monthly food stamp program. And, 
critically, it includes my Preventing 
Online Sales of E-Cigarettes Act. 
Despite strong Republican opposi-
tion, it provides nearly $2 billion to 
maintain the paid leave option. I will 
fight for paid sick days and paid family 
and medical leave in the new year so 
that no worker is left behind. 
In the Labor-HHS provisions, we 
were able to secure $155 billion in life- 
or-death funding: $73 billion for the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices and $82 billion for the Department 
of Education. 
However, it is only a start, and we 
must do so much more. We need aid to 
cities and States. We need a child tax 
credit and much more money for 
childcare. 
Let us act and get the people the help 
they need. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), the ranking member 
of the Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, Education, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to have the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies’ bill included in this im-
portant appropriations package. As we 
have done every year since I have 
served on the subcommittee, we have 
been able to reach a compromise. I 
want to highlight a few of the many 
provisions in the Labor-HHS section of 
the bill. 
The agreement boosts funding for the 
National Institutes of Health by $1.25 
billion. I am proud to say this increase 
represents the sixth straight year of 
sustained increases for the NIH, thanks 
to bipartisan and bicameral support. 
And funding resources, expertise, and 
investments we have made over the 
past 6 years in biomedical research, 
along with public health planning 
through mechanisms like the Infec-
tious Disease Rapid Response Reserve 
Fund, are helping us come out of this 
pandemic faster than predicted. 
Make no mistake, this is not an acci-
dent. It is a result of years of quiet in-
vestment, planning, and scientific dedi-
cation. I am glad this conference agree-
ment continues these investments in 
biomedical research. It will benefit the 
Nation. 
Finally, the bill also funds the Presi-
dent’s childhood cancer initiative and 
continues support to end the HIV epi-
demic. 
This conference agreement before us 
today also increases funding for edu-
cation and training programs, includ-
ing $52 million for an increase in career 
and technical education, a $10 million 
increase for TRIO and GEAR UP. We 
have increased funds for Impact Aid 
and special education and provided 
funds for veterans to integrate back 
into the workforce. 
Finally, the bill continues existing 
funding restrictions, including those 
important to the pro-life community, 
and drops new controversial language. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude 
by thanking Ranking Member KAY 
GRANGER
and 
Labor, 
Health 
and 
Human Services Chair ROSA DELAURO. 
Ms. GRANGER has been a valiant leader 
navigating our members through some 
difficult decisions to bring us here 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to acknowl-
edge the negotiating skills of the chair 
of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, Ms. 
DELAURO. I very much look forward to 
serving with her as both the chair of 
my subcommittee, as well as the chair 
of the full committee in the next Con-
gress. 
Last, but certainly not least, I also 
want to thank our full committee 
chair, Mrs. LOWEY, who has had an out-
standing career and navigated us to 
this point. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Mili-
tary Construction, Veterans Affairs, 
and Related Agencies. 
b 1845 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support the combined 
fiscal year 2021 government spending 
and coronavirus relief package. 
The package before us today does not 
have everything the American people 
need. It shortchanges key relief pro-
grams, like aid to our first responders 
and State and local governments. 
But the American people are suf-
fering and need immediate relief. Sup-
port from Congress is long overdue. 
The package includes critical Demo-
cratic priorities we fought for, like 
money for small businesses, extended 
unemployment 
benefits, 
individual 
stimulus checks, and public health 
funding to eradicate the coronavirus. 
It contains legislation I authored to 
reauthorize the EARLY Act, which 
educates young and at-risk women 
with breast cancer. 
The appropriations bills in this pack-
age advance key priorities, like $250 
million 
for 
Everglades 
restoration, 
fighting 
child 
exploitation 
on 
the 
internet, and protecting migrants and 
holding DHS accountable. 
As chair of the Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, 
we fund improved healthcare for vet-
erans, modernize the VA electronic 
health record system, and improve 
military infrastructure to ensure readi-
ness. 
And we did not include funding to re-
imburse the President for his theft of 
military funds for the racist border 
wall. 
The Democratic House passed our 
coronavirus relief bill in May and our 
appropriations bills in July. Repub-
licans failed to do their job. They have 
showcased 
unprecedented 
incom-
petence and cruelty this year. 
Why did Republicans block this relief 
package until now? 
They thought we were too generous 
with the American people, and they 
wanted to protect corporations who 
put workers in harm’s way, and then 
tried to shackle the Federal Reserve in 
a last-minute effort to make it harder 
for the Biden administration to help 
struggling small businesses. 
Democrats will keep fighting for ad-
ditional aid once President-elect Biden 
takes office. That cannot come soon 
enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7305 
December 21, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MOOLENAAR), a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation 
finishing the appropriations process for 
2021 because it funds important prior-
ities for Michigan families. It includes 
funding for the construction of a new 
lock at the Soo Locks, the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative, rural broadband 
internet access, and NIH research into 
cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s. 
Of course, there is more work to do. 
Many communities have been af-
fected by disasters this year, including 
my district, where two dams failed and 
communities were flooded. 
Congress should do more to help all 
communities affected by natural disas-
ters this year, and I will be doing ev-
erything I can to help those in my dis-
trict apply to receive Federal assist-
ance. 
I am glad we have this bill done for 
the American people, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues 
across the aisle to craft bipartisan leg-
islation again in the new year. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia, (Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for her long career helping working 
men and women throughout the Na-
tion. 
I rise in support of this historic legis-
lation. Under this bill, we were able to 
secure expansion of Pell grants to 
make it easier for students to access 
aid by streamlining the free applica-
tion for Federal student aid. We were 
able to eliminate the ban on Pell 
grants for incarcerated students. We 
were able to discharge debts for many 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. And we were able to invest $82 
billion in schools and colleges. 
I am particularly proud that we were 
able to provide an end to the legal pro-
hibition of the use of Federal funds in 
transportation to promote school inte-
gration. That is right. It is still illegal 
until this bill passes. 
Finally, I want to praise the inclu-
sion in this legislation of the fact that 
we are finally ending surprise medical 
bills and the problems along those 
lines. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we will pass the 
bill and do a lot for students and work-
ers. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART), the ranking 
member of the Transportation, Hous-
ing 
and 
Urban 
Development 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
also thank the chair, Mrs. LOWEY, for 
her long career helping working men 
and women throughout the Nation. 
I thank Chairman PRICE for working 
with me on the transportation and 
housing title of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill includes $230 
million for port infrastructure pro-
grams, which is crucial to coastal 
States, but also, frankly, to our entire 
freight network. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
bill includes $390 million to the Mari-
time Academy Training Ship Program. 
This bill also renews housing assist-
ance for millions of Americans in need. 
It is our duty to meet this commit-
ment, especially for our elderly; our 
disabled; and our heroes, our veterans. 
I am also very pleased the bill pro-
vides $3 billion for homeless assistance 
grants. 
I have seen the results of those pro-
grams firsthand, as we effectively 
eliminated homelessness among vet-
erans in Miami-Dade County. 
As a final point on the THUD bill, I 
would note that this agreement drops 
the controversial riders, allowing us to 
move forward. 
This omnibus itself continues strong 
investments also into our national de-
fense. It funds Everglades restoration 
and prioritizes school safety initia-
tives. 
Once again, Chairman LOWEY
and 
Ranking Member GRANGER led the way 
through these very difficult times by 
working day and night and never giv-
ing up. 
A final word to Chairwoman LOWEY 
as she manages her final bill. You 
know, you can agree or disagree with 
this honorable Member from New York, 
but she is always honorable, straight-
forward, a true gentlewoman, and she 
has been a huge asset to this institu-
tion and to our country. Godspeed, 
Madam Chairwoman. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE). We came to Con-
gress together, and he is the chairman 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of this final 
omnibus package that includes critical 
legislation from the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
First, this agreement includes $69 bil-
lion to crush the coronavirus by sup-
porting the rapid and equitable dis-
tribution of COVID–19 vaccines, as well 
as critical testing and contact tracing. 
Second, this package finally ends 
surprise medical bills for American 
consumers. These surprise bills have 
burdened millions of patients with 
crushing 
medical 
debts. 
It 
saves 
money, which pays for a 3-year exten-
sion to fund community health centers 
and other vital healthcare programs. 
Third, the bill phases down HFCs. 
This is a big win in the fight against 
climate change, along with the reau-
thorization of the Pipeline Safety Act, 
which reduces methane leaks. 
And, fourth, we provide major assist-
ance for struggling families to better 
afford their internet service. 
These are just a few of the key provi-
sions from the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
But I want to end by thanking the 
chair, NITA LOWEY. As she mentioned, 
she and ELIOT ENGEL, myself, and Rich 
Neal are the last in our class. I hate to 
say it that way. She has been an out-
standing legislator and a great friend. 
My only regret is that she is going to 
just leave Richie Neal and myself to 
carry on here. So I really wish she 
would not leave, but I know she wants 
to, and I wish her the best. I love you, 
Nita. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), the rank-
ing member of the Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
I also add my thanks to my good 
friend, Chair LOWEY, upon her retire-
ment from Congress. Thank you so 
much for your grace-filled leadership 
all these years. I am very happy for 
you in this new phase of life. 
Also, Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair-
man of the Agricultural, Rural Devel-
opment, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee publicly here, Chair SAN-
FORD BISHOP. He has such a profes-
sionalism and courtesy and a working, 
friendly 
bipartisan 
spirit. 
I 
really 
think it is important that America 
hears that. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill underwrites 
the stabilization policies for our farm-
ers and ranchers, the protection of our 
drug supply, and what I call the farm 
of the future. 
Now, these elongated deliberations 
have created extra time for us here in 
Congress. I know you would probably 
prefer to be in Maryland. I certainly 
would prefer to be in Nebraska. But we 
have had important work to do here. 
Given the extra amount of time, I 
took some liberties and I visited with a 
young farmer near here, Mr. Speaker. 
He lives in the Shenandoah Valley. And 
on a cold Virginia night, I actually 
sanitized my own shoes and walked 
with him in his poultry house, and we 
talked. We talked about costs, fer-
tilizer reuse, mechanical versus digital 
monitors, and options for integrating 
renewable energy into his operations. 
Checking his birds is a routine he du-
tifully performs. And that is what 
America’s farmers are about: con-
stancy, vigilance, hard work. And 
whether it is in the field or among live-
stock, the day in and day out life of the 
farmer in Nebraska or Virginia or 
Georgia is what keeps America strong 
and helps feed the world. 
This bill supports our production ag-
ricultural system in many traditional 
ways, while we also witness an oppor-
tunity to expand the farm family. New 
forms of small-scale niche agriculture 
marry high-tech with high-touch, con-
necting the rural to the urban, the 
farmer to the family, and the farm to 
the table. This is the future of farming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7306 
December 21, 2020 
Of particular importance, the bill 
supports rural broadband, as well as 
protecting our drug supply. It is an im-
portant bill from the constructs of the 
most basic systems in America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY: Mr. Speaker, 
the bill supports rural broadband. And 
that is more than wires laid. It is about 
creating an ecosystem of livability so 
that the benefits of telehealth and tele- 
education and telework, along with 
precision agriculture, can be distrib-
uted equitably throughout the country. 
The inspiring COVID vaccine approv-
als by the FDA have shown us what we 
can do together, and this bill also pro-
tects our drug supply while keeping un-
safe drugs out. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important that 
these provisions make it into law. That 
is why I am happy to support this bill. 
Again, Chair LOWEY, thank you for 
your leadership. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS), the chairwoman 
of the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
The relief in this bill is desperately 
needed, as families struggle during the 
pandemic crisis. The negotiations were 
difficult. They were tough. I wish we 
could have done even more, but I am 
pleased we have done as well as we 
could have done to provide relief for so 
many in desperate need for their gov-
ernment to come to their aid. 
As chairwoman of the Financial 
Services Committee, I am proud to 
have secured $25 billion in emergency 
rental assistance. We need much more. 
We also got an extension of the evic-
tion moratorium and $12 billion in low- 
cost, long-term capital and grants to 
the minority depository institutions 
and the credit unions and the commu-
nity development financial institu-
tions. 
I thank Ranking Member MCHENRY, 
Chairman CRAPO, and Ranking Member 
BROWN for working with me on these 
provisions. 
I am so pleased that the legislation 
includes stimulus payments for fami-
lies and individuals. Not enough, but I 
am pleased. 
I am also pleased it includes new 
funding for unemployment insurance. 
Not enough, but I am pleased. 
I am also pleased we have support for 
Los Angeles International Airport in 
my district and small business forgiv-
able PPP loans. This bill will also ex-
pand the amount of PPP loans for 
which restaurants are eligible by a con-
siderable amount. 
Let me be clear: Much more is need-
ed, but this bill is a most important 
first step, and I am very pleased that 
we are able to come to the aid of all of 
our constituents. 
I thank NANCY PELOSI for the tre-
mendous job that she did in negoti-
ating to get us to this point. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
FLEISCHMANN), the ranking member of 
the Homeland Security Subcommittee. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Before I begin, I wish to convey my 
warm thoughts and sentiments to Mrs. 
LOWEY from New York, who is chair-
man of this committee. It has been a 
privilege to work with you for almost a 
decade in my capacity, and I wish you 
the best in your future. And I thank 
you for your service to this great 
House. 
b 1900 
Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise in sup-
port of the bill we have before us, 
which is the result of months of nego-
tiations on how best to manage our 
government’s resources in fiscal year 
2021 and respond to the COVID pan-
demic that has gripped so many of our 
communities. 
Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member 
of 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
Sub-
committee, I thank my full committee 
leader, Ms. GRANGER, for her great 
leadership in pulling this omnibus to-
gether. I also thank Subcommittee 
Chairwoman Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD from 
California, along with Senators CAPITO 
and TESTER across the hall, for their 
work and comity in resolving these dif-
ficult and challenging issues. It is a 
pleasure to have served with Chair-
woman ROYBAL-ALLARD in this role. 
Mr. Speaker, I think we have a very 
balanced agreement. We continue to 
provide $1.375 billion for border secu-
rity and funds flexibility for Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement to re-
spond to detention needs. 
Further, we have significant invest-
ments in many of our Nation’s security 
components, 
including 
the 
great 
United States Coast Guard, cybersecu-
rity and infrastructure, and FEMA 
grants to our States and localities to 
respond to disasters. 
Further, the bill before us eliminates 
the riders and policy provisions con-
tained in the House-reported bill that 
would have inhibited the Department 
of Homeland Security from fulfilling 
its law enforcement responsibilities at 
our borders and in the interior of our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this package. It is time for the fiscal 
year to get underway. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish all a happy and 
healthy new year. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), a senior member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank Chairwoman NITA 
LOWEY for once again doing such a phe-
nomenal job. I am going to miss her 
tremendously. 
Let me just say how much I support 
this survival bill, which provides a few 
months of relief for those suffering 
from the severe impacts of COVID. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Congress-
woman Chair DELAURO and Chairman 
PALLONE for their work with our Tri- 
Caucus to include $2.8 billion for test-
ing and vaccine support in the commu-
nities of color hardest hit by COVID. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank our sub-
committee chairs and staff for includ-
ing so many of our priorities and for 
their diligent work on this. 
It is really shameful that it has 
taken Republicans so long to realize 
that their constituents are desperate 
for help and need their government to 
give them a lifeline during this terrible 
time, also. 
Eight million people have slipped 
into poverty since the start of this pan-
demic, and one in four adults are suf-
fering from hunger during COVID–19. 
318,000 people have died from the 
Trump 
administration’s 
scandalous 
mismanagement. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
support this bill. Let’s give this lifeline 
to people. Let’s move forward and build 
on this downpayment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this legislation to provide 
relief to our fellow Americans, accel-
erate our Nation’s economic recovery, 
and ensure our great Nation comes 
back better, stronger, and healthier 
than ever. 
I don’t want to belabor my deep con-
cerns with the process except to say, 
Mr. Speaker, that it is fundamentally 
broken and that it was unnecessarily 
prolonged for purely political reasons. 
The American people waited, and wait-
ed for months. They deserve better, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, 
fellow Texan and ranking member, KAY 
GRANGER; our leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY; 
KEVIN BRADY; and many others who 
helped finalize this agreement. 
It is far from perfect. I haven’t met 
perfect legislation since coming to 
Washington. But it does a good job of 
supporting 
our 
struggling 
families, 
small businesses, healthcare profes-
sionals, teachers, and other frontline 
workers at a time when many des-
perately need it, and all of this at a 
fraction of Speaker PELOSI’s $3.3 tril-
lion bailout bonanza, which included 
cash for illegals, legalizing marijuana, 
and a host of other unnecessary and ir-
responsible provisions. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no small feat to 
keep our annual spending below the 
budget cap, and I commend my col-
leagues, including Chairwoman LOWEY, 
for that. 
To do that and prevail in protecting 
troops and including their pay raise, 
funding for the border wall, preserving

the sacred protections for our unborn, I 
have got to tell you, that is pretty darn 
good. 
It is hard for me to stand for some of 
this stuff in this bill, this omnibus. But 
on balance, it is good for the country, 
and I am standing with Chairwoman 
LOWEY, and I am standing with my fel-
low Texan, KAY GRANGER. 
God bless America. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), my friend for 32 
years in the House, the outstanding 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor. I thank 
her 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
KAY 
GRANGER for bringing this in a very 
strong bipartisan way. 
I spoke this morning at some length, 
so it is on the record as to my attitude 
here. I salute the legislation that is 
here and urge passage, but I do want to 
take a minute to thank the Madam 
Chair. 
She has served in the Congress for a 
long time. We have sat side by side 
over the years with ROSA DELAURO, 
STENY HOYER, and Mr. CLYBURN as ap-
propriators. I have seen her writings- 
based astute political knowledge, her 
strategic thinking, her encyclopedic 
knowledge of the legislation produce 
the results, understanding what the 
process will bear and what the country 
needs first and foremost. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair-
woman LOWEY. I don’t know how many 
more times we will thank her, but 
hopefully, when the coronavirus goes 
away, we can all join in embracing her 
great leadership and expressing grati-
tude. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to just again 
take a moment in recognition of the 
other chairs who worked to make this 
legislation so, so effective with direct 
payments through the employee reten-
tion tax credit, the unemployment in-
surance, to name a few. 
Congresswoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
with 
Small Business, under her leadership 
and working in a bipartisan way, small 
businesses, which are the heart of our 
economy, have received almost $1 tril-
lion in these coronavirus bills, almost 
$1 trillion. We support that, but I also 
would hope there would be some com-
mensurate recognition of the jobs of 
small business, the jobs of State and 
local government. They have received 
only $160 billion in all of these bills, 
$160 billion. 
Does that sound familiar? That is ex-
actly the amount of money that the 
Republicans put in the CARES bill to 
give to the wealthiest in our country, 
yet for all the States and localities, 
and it was retroactive, having nothing 
to do with coronavirus, $160 billion. 
They thought that was commensurate 
with 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
our 
healthcare workers, our State and 
local police and fire, first responders, 
transportation, sanitation, food work-
ers, our teachers, our teachers, our 
teachers. 
So, yes, there is more work to do, and 
it will cost some money, but it will 
protect jobs. Most importantly, it will 
meet the needs of the American people 
to crush the virus and to do so in a way 
that brings us all into the future in a 
very safe way. 
I thank Congresswoman VELA´ ZQUEZ 
for her extraordinary leadership in 
that regard. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank MAXINE WATERS 
for coming to the need of people, rent-
ers, landlords, et cetera, with her im-
portant legislation—of course, we want 
more, but for now, this will see us 
through—her Community Development 
Financial Institutions legislation, her 
MDIs, making all that available in the 
small business piece, available to so 
many more people. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SCOTT from 
Virginia. Student loans, childcare, I 
thank him for making it right. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PALLONE 
for his leadership again and again. Vac-
cines, the vaccine issue is so impor-
tant, how it is delivered, how it is pro-
duced, distributed. Going from vaccine 
to vaccination, from lab to arm, so 
much is required, and much of it is in 
this bill. Testing and tracing are still 
needed. We still need to provide a relief 
fund that goes along with that. I thank 
him for the personal interest he took 
in broadband. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DEFAZIO on 
transportation and WRDA. Yesterday 
morning, we didn’t even have WRDA in 
the bill. That is why this all has taken 
longer to do. So, I thank him for the 
important role that he played. We all 
know about the airlines and the rest, 
but there is so much more. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PETERSON 
for his work on nutrition. People are 
hungry in our country, and we had to 
fight for nutrition money, but I thank 
him for his persistence. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCGOVERN 
for his advocacy in the Congress for 
children and hunger, as well as ROSA 
DELAURO. But Mr. MCGOVERN has gone 
on hunger strikes and the rest. He real-
ly values what is in this bill on nutri-
tion to feed the hungry in our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. MALONEY 
for saving our Postal Service. 
Just a brief reference to say thank 
you. This has been a long, difficult ne-
gotiation. These chairs, their members 
of the committees, and their staffs 
have been invaluable. Shalanda and 
Chris, I thank them so much for mak-
ing all this happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I reference the state-
ment I made this morning about one 
thing and another, about the attitude 
we have to this and the need for us to 
recognize this as a first step and the 
need for us to address the important 
contribution of our health workers, po-
lice and fire first responders, sanita-
tion, transportation, food workers, our 
teachers, our teachers, our teachers. 
If we are going to safely reenter the 
economy and our schools, we must 
crush the virus. 
I have hope to crush the virus. That 
is why we could support this bill. It 
doesn’t go all the way, but it takes us 
down the path, a first step. 
I have hope of crushing the virus, and 
I have hope because of the election of 
Joe Biden as President of the United 
States, a President who will follow 
science. He will follow science, and he 
will recognize that we have to meet the 
needs of all the American people wher-
ever they live in our country, espe-
cially addressing BARBARA LEE’s con-
cerns about the communities of color 
that have been underserved in so much 
of what we have done. 
Mr. Speaker, I have great apprecia-
tion for Madam Chair NITA LOWEY. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Madam Chair for yielding, and I thank 
Ranking Member KAY GRANGER for her 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity 
to do a video, as we all are commu-
nicating with one another virtually, 
about my colleague and friend with 
whom I have served for over three dec-
ades, NITA LOWEY. 
I went to school in NITA LOWEY’s dis-
trict many, many years ago. When she 
came here, we became friends. Shortly 
thereafter, she came on the Appropria-
tions Committee, and we served to-
gether, as Speaker PELOSI said, on the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee. I served on that committee for 
23 years. I have great affection for that 
committee. 
We served under a gentleman named 
Bill Natcher from the State of Ken-
tucky. He used to stand when he pre-
sented that bill to the floor and say: 
‘‘This is the people’s bill.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is the people’s bill. 
b 1915 
This is a bill that must pass. They 
say that good things come to those who 
wait. They have waited too long, had 
too much pain, physically; too many 
deaths; too much psychological dam-
age; too many lost jobs. This is, how-
ever, a good thing that will come to 
those who need it so badly. 
I want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY, 
who has performed such extraordinary 
service on the Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies for a long 
time; and the Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams for a long time; and for the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
I want to thank my friend, KAY 
GRANGER. We are perceived as being 
awfully partisan, and this has been a 
partisan project as well. It took us 
from May 15 until today to get this 
done. We passed, in the interim, Octo-
ber 1, another bill of substantially less-
er sum than the one we passed in May, 
and a little more than what we are 
passing—actually, twice what we are 
passing today. All of it was needed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7308 
December 21, 2020 
The American people have been wait-
ing and watching and hoping that Con-
gress would not only be able to avert a 
shutdown but also to provide much- 
needed COVID–19 relief. 
Mr. Speaker, we now have a bipar-
tisan agreement, and the legislation 
will achieve both of those aims. 
KAY GRANGER, as I said, is somebody 
who was a mayor in Texas, and mayors 
know they have to get things done, and 
Congresswoman 
GRANGER
has 
been 
somebody who wants to get things 
done. She and NITA LOWEY have been a 
team in getting things done. I thank 
both of them. 
This bill completes the appropria-
tions process by investing in the Amer-
ican people, in our national defense, in 
economic opportunity, in strength-
ening safety net programs that keep 
Americans out of poverty. 
As I said, I thank both NITA LOWEY 
and KAY GRANGER. 
I particularly want to thank an ex-
traordinary Member of this body. She 
is not called a Congresswoman. She is 
not a Member of this body, but she is a 
person without whom we would not be 
nearly as successful as we have been 
over this last year. She has made this 
year less painful for millions and mil-
lions and millions of Americans. 
Her name is Shalanda Young. She 
sits right behind me, an extraordinary 
talent whose leadership makes seminal 
contributions to all the sections of this 
bill and to previous bills dealing with 
appropriations and the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
She is, in many ways, an indispen-
sable person when we come to dealing 
with bills of this magnitude. She works 
for Mrs. LOWEY, as does Chris Bigelow. 
Both have done extraordinary service. 
Shalanda Young, Mr. Speaker, rep-
resents the best of us. I say that be-
cause she represents a lot of the staff 
we have here. She is extraordinarily 
talented, extraordinarily patriotic, and 
extraordinarily dedicated to the work 
of the American people, and extraor-
dinarily underpaid. 
Members are going to be underpaid in 
this bill, too. We beat our chest, and we 
have money in there that says we don’t 
get a COLA one more time. Aren’t we 
so courageous. I am disgusted by that, 
Mr. Speaker, and I want all of America 
to know; I want all of my constituents 
to know. Every Member in this place, 
whether I agree with them or not, is 
worth a COLA, at least trying to keep 
them even with the cost of living in 
this country. We struck it one more 
time, as we pretend that we think the 
COLA is unjust. 
However, that is de minimis to this 
bill, but, certainly, will not dissuade 
me or ought not to dissuade anybody 
from 
voting 
enthusiastically, 
ener-
getically, and proudly for this bill. 
As a result of this omnibus, the next 
President will be able to start his ad-
ministration focusing on immediate 
challenges instead of trying to finish 
the previous year’s work. 
I want to say something on that one 
more time. I have talked to Ms. 
GRANGER, who is going to be here. 
There is no reason, Mr. Speaker, why 
we can’t pass appropriation bills by 
September 30, the ending of the fiscal 
year, October 1 being the beginning of 
the new fiscal year. 
I am frustrated, as the majority lead-
er who is supposed to be able to make 
things work here, with my colleagues. 
We did make it work here, but our Sen-
ate colleagues did not pass a single bill 
prior to the election, so here we are. 
In 
addition, 
this 
end-of-the-year 
package includes critical clean-energy 
legislation passed by the House earlier 
this 
year 
that 
makes 
important 
progress toward addressing the climate 
crisis while ensuring that America can 
create good jobs by leading the clean- 
energy economy. 
We were also able, in this bill, Mr. 
Speaker, to include legislation that 
protects patients from surprise bills by 
removing them from the fight between 
insurers 
and 
providers 
and 
imple-
menting a fairer process for resolving 
disputes. 
On COVID–19 relief, while we were 
unable to secure agreement on every 
priority that Democrats and some Re-
publicans wanted—we don’t always get 
everything we want. So be it. That is 
the process. 
We were able, however, to include 
many of the provisions we included in 
previous bills on May 15 and October 1, 
which I referred to earlier, for which 
Democrats 
have 
been 
fighting 
for 
months 
and 
that 
Americans 
des-
perately need. 
These include resumption of ex-
panded unemployment benefits, an-
other round of direct payments, relief 
for renters, and assistance to make 
sure that Americans can put food on 
the table. In the richest country on the 
face of the Earth, we have people in 
food lines who can’t feed themselves. 
That is not only wrong, but it is im-
moral and inconsistent with my faith 
and, I think, the faith of most. 
There is additional help for small 
business—appropriate—and 
resources 
to help schools reopen safely. 
In addition, we secured another $3.36 
billion for GAVI, and I thank the chair. 
It is a small program, relatively speak-
ing, but it is about keeping people 
healthy around the world. 
We are a shrinking globe, and this 
COVID crisis came from abroad—wher-
ever it came from, Europe, contrary to 
the President saying it came only from 
China. It came from Europe; it came 
from China. We have a moral responsi-
bility to make sure that it doesn’t keep 
coming and that we help our brothers 
and sisters abroad as well so that we, 
too, can be healthy. 
In the new year, we will continue to 
work to ensure that our country can 
meet the challenges of COVID–19, in-
cluding help for State, local, Tribal, 
and territorial governments that are 
on the front line. Who is delivering the 
shot in the arm? States and local gov-
ernments. 
No compromise is perfect, of course, 
and this is not perfect. So many people 
have said that, but that goes without 
saying. We don’t do perfect. We are 
human beings. If we do the right thing, 
we do the best we can. It is essential 
that we move forward and do our jobs 
for the American people. 
That is why the House did its job by 
passing the Heroes Act in May and 
again in October and why we passed ap-
propriation bills to fund nearly all of 
government by July 26. 
It is disappointing, as I have said, 
that the Senate waited until November 
to begin serious consideration of appro-
priation bills. I don’t mean the sub-
committees didn’t work; they just 
didn’t report anything out. 
Thankfully, though, we are taking 
action together. America, we are tak-
ing action together. And you can be 
pleased when you see the board light 
up, mostly overwhelmingly green. 
I urge the President to sign this leg-
islation without delay, just, Mr. Speak-
er, as I urge him to sign the National 
Defense Authorization Act in which 
you played such a critical role, Mr. 
Speaker, and we passed earlier this 
month. I fear that he will veto this bill 
for an unrelated, totally nongermane 
issue, and we may be back here on the 
28th. 
If we are not here on the 28th, again, 
NITA LOWEY, I want to say to you: 
Thank you. How much we appreciate 
your contribution, and how much we 
appreciate the contribution of all of 
those who might be leaving either vol-
untarily or involuntarily. We thank 
them for their service. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s finish the work of 
the 116th Congress. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BRADY), the ranking member on 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Ranking Member GRANGER for 
her terrific leadership on this bill and 
throughout this session. 
This agreement is a big, important 
win for American workers, healthcare 
providers, Main Street businesses, and 
families. 
In this agreement, we have Repub-
lican tax relief for American families. 
We permanently make it easier to de-
duct high medical costs and lifetime 
learning costs. We extend for 5 years 
the tax credit for paid family and med-
ical leave, plus we take it one step fur-
ther by helping businesses pay off stu-
dent loans for workers. 
We have big wins for patients and 
families together. We end surprise 
medical bills when you visit the ER or 
have scheduled medical procedures. We 
require that patients be given a true 
and honest bill ahead of a scheduled 
procedure, and we make it easier to 
find in-network doctors and providers. 
In addition to helping patients, we 
also help our doctors. We increase their 
pay and stop two-thirds of planned 
Medicare cuts for certain providers. We 
also increase doctor pay by over $3 bil-
lion and add 1,000 new graduate med-
ical education slots to help train more 
doctors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7309 
December 21, 2020 
We took needed action to improve 
healthcare in rural areas. 
It also contains strong antifraud 
safeguards for unemployment. 
We offer crucial tax help for millions 
of Americans and small businesses with 
another round of stimulus checks, 
more funds and flexibility for PPP 
loans. 
We also include important technical 
corrections to the new U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement, which will help our 
economy rebuild from this pandemic. 
Maybe most importantly, we have 
big wins in this package to help us de-
feat the virus once and for all with bil-
lions more in funding for vaccines, 
testing, distribution, and more. 
This bipartisan solution is so impor-
tant to the American people. This is a 
strong and needed package. Its benefits 
will be felt for years to come. 
I also want to finish by thanking our 
committee 
chairman, 
RICHIE
NEAL, 
who worked so closely with me and all 
of our committee members on these 
wins for the American people. It has 
been an honor to work with him this 
Congress. 
I am also very proud of the work and 
leadership that Republicans have ex-
emplified throughout this Congress, es-
pecially among the Ways and Means 
Committee. I will gladly and strongly 
vote in support of this bill, and I en-
courage all of my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I close, I want to take a mo-
ment to recognize my good friend and 
our full committee chairman, NITA 
LOWEY, as this will be the last bill that 
she will take to the floor. 
She is the first woman to hold the 
gavel 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee, and her retirement is a huge 
loss to our country, to our committee, 
and to me personally. 
When I was named as ranking mem-
ber and she was named as chair, she 
called me into her office. We really had 
never worked together. We were on dif-
ferent committees. I will never forget 
what she said. She said: We are going 
to do it on time and on budget, and we 
will become best friends. 
b 1930 
I wasn’t sure she wasn’t crazy, but I 
said: I will do that. 
We became good friends, and we did 
things on time and on budget. Every-
thing was a joy working with her be-
cause she always knew what she want-
ed and what she wanted to do. She was 
inclusive, and we did turn and have a 
friendship that I will always cherish. 
So I wanted to make sure that you 
knew that I realized I had a unique op-
portunity in working with you. I 
learned a lot, and we had a good time, 
didn’t we? 
I also want to take a minute to 
thank the members of our committee 
and our staff for their hard work this 
year. This really is a must-pass bill 
that I look forward to getting signed 
into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of these bills, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time, and I 
rise to address this House for the final 
time. 
For 32 years, it has been my privilege 
to serve as United States Representa-
tive from New York; and in the 116th 
Congress, it has been my distinct honor 
to be the first chairwoman of the 
House Appropriations Committee. 
By wielding the power of the purse, 
this bill will make a profound dif-
ference in the lives of millions of 
Americans 
and 
people 
around 
the 
world. 
I am proud to have worked with so 
many of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to assemble this bill and other 
legislative successes. You have chal-
lenged and inspired me, and I treasure 
the friendships that we have made. 
My dear friend, KAY GRANGER, it has 
been such an honor getting to know 
you. Texas values, New York values, no 
matter what they say, we became good 
friends and worked so well together. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
I would be remiss if I did not thank 
the talented staff who have worked so 
hard to put this bill together, led by 
Clerk and Staff Director Shalanda 
Young, the extraordinary Shalanda 
Young, who is way back there. 
Thank you, Shalanda Young. 
And also the extraordinary deputy 
staff director, Chris Bigelow. What a 
team. They manage. No matter how 
much paper and no matter what the 
challenge, they seem to be able to put 
it all together and get it right. 
Shalanda and Chris, I thank you— 
and always with an assist by my chief 
of staff, Elizabeth Stanley. 
I do want to thank the staff director 
of the State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related 
Programs 
Subcommittee, 
which I chair, Steve Marchese. 
There is one principle that has guid-
ed my 32 years in public service: When 
you see a problem, whether it is here or 
in the district or in another commu-
nity, do something about it. 
Too many people see a problem. They 
are good people, but they will all go off 
to this personal activity or another 
personal activity. Members of Congress 
know, when they see a problem, we 
have a responsibility to address it and 
do something about it to make life bet-
ter for our community, the Nation, and 
the world. This bill does something to 
crush this virus and set us on the 
course for a strong and equitable recov-
ery. 
Mr. Speaker, for the last time and 
with a deep sense of gratitude for the 
honor of serving in this House, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2021 that funds our government and 
provides desperately needed relief to Amer-
ican families. I’m proud to support many of the 
provisions in this legislation, understanding 
that no compromise is perfect. Frontline work-
ers, including public health workers, fire-
fighters, and other essential workers employed 
by state and local governments continue to 
need our support. 
The bill before us today provides a lifeline to 
those who are struggling from the COVID–19 
pandemic and the recession it has caused. It 
extends critical programs first authorized by 
the CARES Act including $300 per week in 
additional unemployment benefits, a second 
round of direct payments of up to $600, $284 
billion for additional small business loans 
under the Paycheck Protection Program, and 
$13 billion in nutrition assistance for Ameri-
cans facing hunger. It also provides $25 billion 
to help renters pay their rent and stay in their 
homes. I’m deeply disappointed that the Ad-
ministration and the Senate Majority Leader 
would not allow restaurants and their workers 
to receive our help. With over 300 bipartisan 
cosponsors on the RESTAURANT Act, these 
businesses and their workers should have 
been in this legislation. 
In addition to pandemic relief, the bill funds 
the government through the remainder of the 
fiscal year, avoiding a costly government shut-
down before the holidays, and invests in crit-
ical priorities, including clean energy, afford-
able housing, public schools, and broadband. 
I’m proud to have secured $100 million for the 
electrification of Caltrain, $8.9 million for envi-
ronmental conservation of the San Francisco 
Bay, $33 million for construction of the Linac 
Coherent Light Source upgrade (LCLS–II) at 
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and 
$85.2 million for the Stratospheric Observatory 
for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at NASA 
Ames. 
Our country is in the midst of the worst pub-
lic health crisis in a century, and I’m proud to 
say that the Democrats on the Energy and 
Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I 
have had the privilege to lead, have stepped 
up to the challenge by securing provisions that 
include the following: 
Provide billions to ensure the free, timely, 
and equitable distribution of safe, effective 
vaccines and more resources for a national 
testing strategy: 
End surprise medical billing. No patient will 
face an unexpected, expensive bill just be-
cause they are caught in a web of providers. 
Assist doctors and public and rural hospitals 
survive the pandemic by stopping planned 
Medicare and Medicaid cuts. 
Provide three years of funding for critical 
public health programs including Community 
Health Centers, Teaching Health Centers, the 
National Health Service Corps, and the special 
diabetes programs. 
Restore Medicaid coverage for the citizens 
of the freely associated states living in the 
U.S., to whom America has for too long aban-
doned its commitments to. 
Improve Medicare coverage for beneficiaries 
across the country by simplifying Part B enroll-
ment; permanently authorizing the use of tele-
health for mental health care; eliminating cost- 
sharing for colorectal cancer screenings; and 
extending coverage for immunosuppressive 
drugs for kidney transplant patients. I’m espe-
cially proud to have co-led and championed 
the immunosuppressive drug coverage legisla-
tion to correct a short-sighted coverage policy

December 21, 2020 
which will save 375 kidney transplants each 
year. This provision appears in Section 402 of 
Division CC and is based on H.R. 5534, the 
Comprehensive 
Immunosuppressive 
Drug 
Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act 
of 2019. 
Improve the Medicaid program by expand-
ing access to certified community behavioral 
health clinics; eliminate spousal impoverish-
ment for partners of Medicaid beneficiaries re-
ceiving home and community-based services; 
and continuing the Money Follows the Person 
rebalancing demonstration which makes it 
possible for people on Medicaid to transition to 
a safer home or community-based environ-
ment and still maintain Medicaid funding. 
Lower health care costs by strengthening 
parity in mental health and substance use dis-
order benefits; removing gag clauses on 
health price and quality information; ending a 
loophole that allowed drugs for opioid use dis-
order to benefit from the orphan drug designa-
tion; and making it easier for biosimilar prod-
ucts to come to market by increasing patent 
and exclusivity transparency. This final provi-
sion appears in Section 325 of Division BB, 
and it is a bill I’m proud to have sponsored, 
H.R. 1520, the Purple Book Continuity Act. It 
requires patent information for biologics to be 
submitted to the FDA and published in the 
publicly-available ‘‘Purple Book.’’ By creating a 
single, searchable list of licensed biologics, 
manufacturers will be able to plan a pipeline of 
lower-cost biosimilar products for years to 
come. 
I’m also proud to have several health appro-
priations which I requested included in today’s 
agreement. These items represent the critical 
advancement of life-saving research and care, 
including: $15 million for the Pancreatic Can-
cer Research Program at the DOD, which I’ve 
long championed and which comes as the 
world continues to mourn the deaths this year 
of several iconic Americans from this very ag-
gressive cancer, including Congressman John 
Lewis and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg; $42.9 billion for the NIH for forward 
thinking investments in medical research; 
$597 million for critical biodefense and public 
health emergency preparedness at BARDA, 
which my legislation created. Another $19.7 
billion is in the COVID–19 relief agreement for 
BARDA to manufacture and procure vaccines; 
$350 million for the Children’s Hospitals Grad-
uate Medical Education Program to support 
pediatric medical residents’ training; and $5.4 
million for research on Chronic Fatigue Syn-
drome at the CDC to better understand this 
terrible disease. 
There’s still so much more the American 
people need. We must increase federal fund-
ing for the Medicaid program during this health 
and economic crisis, including home-and-com-
munity-based services, improve infection con-
trol and quality in our nation’s nursing homes, 
and address the public health crises that con-
tinue during the COVID–19 pandemic, such as 
America’s unacceptable rates of maternal mor-
tality, suicides, and overdoses. I’m proud of 
what we’ve accomplished in the Health Sub-
committee this year and energized to continue 
the fight in 2021. 
Today’s agreement includes important clean 
energy provisions, including my legislation, 
H.R. 1420, the Energy Efficient Government 
Technology Act, which appears as Sections 
1003 and 1004 of Division Z. The bill requires 
government agencies to develop plans to im-
plement best practices for energy manage-
ment, purchase more energy efficient informa-
tion and communications technologies, and 
submit to periodic evaluation of their data cen-
ters for energy efficiency. 
Data centers are a critical part of our na-
tional infrastructure and are found in nearly 
every sector of our economy. The federal gov-
ernment alone has more than 2,000 data cen-
ters which store everything from Social Secu-
rity and tax records, toe-books at the Library 
of Congress. Despite their importance to our 
government and our economy, many are ex-
tremely inefficient when it comes to energy 
use. 
The good news is many data centers can 
significantly reduce their energy use using ex-
isting technology and best practices. This will 
reduce not only the government’s carbon foot-
print but also its energy bills. My bipartisan 
legislation has the potential to save taxpayers 
hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced en-
ergy costs in the future, while setting an ex-
ample for the private sector to reduce energy 
usage at data centers. 
We must ensure students in need can con-
tinue their studies during the pandemic as col-
leges begin another semester of remote learn-
ing, and I’m proud that our agreement in-
cludes funding for these students. Section 902 
of Division N is modeled on H.R. 6814, the 
Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education 
Students in Need Act, bicameral legislation I 
introduced on May 13, 2020. 
The provision provides $285 million to ex-
pand connectivity for historically Black col-
leges and universities, Tribal colleges and uni-
versities, 
Hispanic-serving 
institutions 
and 
other minority-serving institutions, their stu-
dents, and minority-owned businesses near 
those colleges. The funding can be used to 
purchase routers, modems, wi-fi hotspots, tab-
lets, and laptops. Funding recipients must 
prioritize low-income students. The legislation 
also 
establishes 
the 
Office 
of 
Minority 
Broadband Initiatives within the NTIA to carry 
out programs expand access to broadband at 
and in communities around HBCUs, TCUs, 
HSis and other MSis. 
Between 2012 and 2018, over $1.2 billion in 
9–1–1 fees were diverted to uses other than 
9–1–1. While most states curtailed this horrific 
practice, four states continue diverting 9–1–1 
fees: New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, 
and Nevada. I first co-led the bipartisan 9–1– 
1 Fee Integrity Act to require by statute that 
9–1–1 fees can only be used for 9–1–1 pur-
poses on September 14, 2018. I’m pleased 
that the legislation appears in Section 902 of 
Division FF. 
I’m pleased that today’s agreement includes 
funding for AI R&D. The Joint Explanatory 
Statement for Division B includes direction for 
AI R&D to expand at NSF and NIST, including 
with a focus on increasing AI workforce diver-
sity and developing a framework for ethical 
and safe AI. I’ve twice written to the House 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies re-
questing robust AI R&D funding, and I thank 
them for their leadership in taking an important 
step to increase AI funding. 
I’m pleased that this legislation includes 
funding for several technology and tele-
communications matters that are priorities for 
me and for our country, including $3.2 billion 
for a $50 per month emergency broadband 
benefit for low income families, Pell Grant re-
cipients, students eligible for free or reduced 
lunch, and recently unemployed individuals; 
$1.9 billion to ‘rip and replace’ telecommuni-
cations equipment made by insecure supplies, 
like Huawei and ZTE, which I first asked the 
FCC to investigate in 2010; $250 million for 
the FCC’s COVID–19 Telehealth Program; 
and $65 million to develop reliable broadband 
maps which are critical for the federal govern-
ment and all states to know where broadband 
support funding would be most effective. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to empha-
size the appropriate application and interpreta-
tion of Section 404 of the Intelligence Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which has 
been included as Division W of the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act of 2021. 
Section 404 was authored by Chairman 
BENNIE THOMPSON of the Committee on Home-
land Security. Its essence is to establish a 
specialized fellowship program related to cy-
bersecurity and intelligence within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. The program is 
meant for certain undergraduate students from 
diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, and other back-
grounds. And the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity—who shall administer Section 404— 
also will have authority to hire successful fel-
lowship participants as Department employ-
ees, and into positions involving cyber or intel-
ligence. 
The broader and most compelling goal 
being, of course, to ensure that the Depart-
ment and the Federal government are doing 
their utmost to recruit, hire and retain a highly 
diverse workforce. The language of Section 
404 must be interpreted and implemented by 
the Department broadly, with a mind towards 
attainment of this lawful objective; under no 
circumstances should it be read in an inappro-
priately narrow or needlessly restrictive fash-
ion. 
Although Section 404 does not require that 
students attend Historically Black Colleges or 
Universities or Minority-Serving Institutions in 
order to participate in the fellowship program, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security—who will 
administer this authority—should make exten-
sive efforts to promote the fellowship among 
students from HBCUs and MSIs. 
Together with the other Members of the 
Homeland Security and Intelligence Commit-
tees, I will look forward to receiving the report 
required by Section 404, which will permit 
Congress to confirm that, in fact, the Depart-
ment is conducting the necessary outreach to 
HBCUs, MSIs, and other Institutions of Higher 
Education; and, consistent with the approach I 
have set forth here, reading and applying Sec-
tion 404’s language in a manner that fulfills 
the initiative’s overarching goal. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to lend my support of this fiscal year 2021 ap-
propriations package. 
I thank the Chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, Mrs. LOWEY, and my friend, Chairman 
SERRANO, as they prepare to retire for their 
many years of dedication and hard work to 
this institution and I wish them both well. 
I also want to thank Ranking Member 
GRANGER for her outstanding leadership this 
year. 
I’m pleased that this bill supports the Trump 
Administration’s Moon to Mars Artemis initia-
tive and rejects radical demands to defund the 
police. It also restores long-standing Second 
Amendment protections that have enjoyed his-
torical, bipartisan support yet were excluded

December 21, 2020 
from the House-passed Commerce, Justice, 
Science Appropriations Act. 
I am also pleased that this bill rejects issues 
which previously held up a COVID relief 
agreement. This bill provides individuals, fami-
lies, health care providers, and businesses the 
assistance which we can agree on, to help ev-
eryone get through this pandemic. It also 
looks to the future by providing additional 
funding to expand internet access in rural 
areas. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, The 
House amendment to the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 133, the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021, includes many important provisions. 
Among them is Section 203 of Title II, Division 
BB, based on H.R. 7539, the Strengthening 
Behavioral Health Parity Act—an important 
step forward in improving the effective en-
forcement of mental health parity laws that 
govern group and individual health plans and 
coverage. I am pleased to see this legislation 
advance as part of our continuing efforts to 
ensure the promise of parity is realized for all. 
As Chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, which has legislative juris-
diction over employee health benefit plans (in-
cluding provisions of the Mental Health Parity 
and Addiction Equity Act and the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA) as 
well as oversight jurisdiction over the United 
States Department of Labor, I would like to 
provide additional clarification for the record 
regarding the interactions between this legisla-
tion and existing enforcement and compliance 
efforts by the Secretary of Labor. 
First, no provision of Section 203 in any way 
restricts, alters, or otherwise interferes with the 
existing enforcement and oversight authority of 
the Secretary of Labor, including the Sec-
retary’s authority to investigate, audit, and 
seek equitable or other relief to enforce any 
requirements of federal law. The requirement 
that the Secretary examine the comparative 
analyses of at least 20 plans annually serves 
as a floor, not a ceiling, on the Department’s 
enforcement actions, and the Department re-
mains authorized to continue to utilize its 
broad authority under Sections 502, 504, 506 
of ERISA and other laws to enforce all re-
quirements of this bill, Part 7 of ERISA, and 
any other requirements of federal law. 
Second, no provision of Section 203 in any 
way restricts, alters, or otherwise interferes 
with the rights of group health plan partici-
pants to bring an action to enforce their rights 
under Section 502 of ERISA, nor does it im-
pact judicial review of any statutory violations. 
This bill also should not be interpreted to cre-
ate any additional presumption in favor of 
health plans and issuers during judicial review 
of nonquantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) 
determinations, and the Secretary remains au-
thorized to seek equitable or other relief, in-
cluding relief regarding the re-adjudication of 
claims. All provisions should be interpreted to 
ensure the broadest access to relief for plan 
participants. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of the 900 billion 
dollar economic relief package which has 
been agreed to by Members of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle. While this package is 
far from what is actually needed, it is nec-
essary to act right now and we do not have 
any additional time to wait. This bill will direct 
billions of dollars in aid to unemployed individ-
uals who are suffering with no other hope or 
help in sight. 
It will provide up to $600 in stimulus checks, 
it will extend unemployment benefit checks, 
extend a moratorium on evictions for 1 month, 
325 billion for business relief with 275 billion 
going to paycheck protection, 82 billion for 
schools, 20 billion for vaccine distribution. 
While this is not quite exactly what I was look-
ing for, it will hold us until President Biden 
takes the reins and leads us on. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, 
the American people are incredibly frustrated, 
and rightly so. This relief package, while a 
step forward, should have been passed 
months ago. House Democrats first passed 
the Heroes Act in May; at the same time, Ma-
jority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL called for a 
‘pause’ and Senate Republicans refused to act 
until now. 
More than 315,000 Americans have died 
from COVID–19. Experts have said if we had 
made a larger investment in testing and trac-
ing, many of these deaths could have been 
prevented. Millions of Americans are unem-
ployed and many are facing food insecurity. 
Our state and local governments, including 
first responders, have been on the frontlines of 
this pandemic but are being left out of this re-
lief package. We can and we must do more. 
As I have said before, we cannot get the 
economy up and running until we conquer the 
virus. 
Today’s relief package makes significant in-
vestments in testing and tracing efforts, vac-
cines, therapeutics, and medical supplies and 
funding for underserved communities, all of 
which are critical to crushing this pandemic. 
This package provides help for the millions 
of Americans who are struggling right now. It 
strengthens critical programs for those who 
are unemployed by extending and enhancing 
unemployment insurance and rental assist-
ance. It also offers $600 in direct payments to 
low- and moderate-income Americans and in-
cludes a $13 billion increase in food assist-
ance programs to help the millions of families 
facing food insecurity. 
This bill also includes vital funding for small 
businesses, including specific funding for arts 
and cultural programs and smaller businesses 
who weren’t able to access the initial relief 
funding. 
These are welcome steps forward, but they 
are just a down payment on what needs to be 
done. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
which includes my bipartisan Water Power Re-
search and Development Act. 
As we work to mitigate the climate crisis 
and transition to a 100 percent clean energy 
economy, we cannot ignore our ocean. It cov-
ers more than 70 percent of the surface of our 
planet, and we can capture the power of its 
waves, currents, and tides to power our 
homes, buildings, and communities. 
Marine energy has tremendous potential as 
one of the last untapped renewable energy 
sources, and federal investment can help 
unlock it. Earlier this year, I was pleased to 
work with my House Oceans Caucus CoChair, 
Congressman DON YOUNG, and another ma-
rine energy enthusiast from the east coast, 
Congressman TED DEUTCH, to introduce the 
bipartisan Water Power Research and Devel-
opment Act. The bill would reauthorize funding 
for research, development, demonstration, and 
commercialization of marine energy within the 
Department of Energy’s Water Power Tech-
nologies Office. Importantly, the bill authorizes 
funding for existing and new National Marine 
Energy Centers, including the Pacific Marine 
Energy Center—operated by Oregon State 
University, the University of Washington, and 
the University of Alaska Fairbanks. 
Researchers at Oregon State University are 
leading the way on this innovative work. 
Through the Pacific Marine Energy Center, 
OSU is currently in the process of developing 
PacWave, the first of its kind wave energy test 
facility off the Oregon Coast. Their leadership 
scaling up the PacWave testing facility will 
catalyze this nascent industry. Additionally, we 
are fortunate to have the advanced manufac-
turing capacity of companies like Vigor, which 
recently constructed an 826-ton wave energy 
device that was deployed off the shores of Ha-
waii. It was not until I visited Vigor to see the 
device that I grasped the scale of this re-
source and what we can gain from it. 
I appreciate the support of Chairwoman 
JOHNSON in helping to secure the inclusion of 
the Water Power Research and Development 
Act in today’s comprehensive energy package 
and end of year spending bill, and I am thrilled 
that it will soon be signed into law. I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this bill, which is 
an important step forward in advancing ocean 
climate action. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of this relief bill because the Amer-
ican people cannot wait another day. 
Over 315,000 Americans are dead. Three 
out of every 4 small businesses have seen 
their revenues fall, and thousands have shut 
their doors for good. 
Food insecurity has doubled for families with 
children, and millions of Americans are turning 
to food banks for the first time. 
In most states, 1 in 5 households are be-
hind on rent. More than 10 million people are 
unemployed. 
But it’s been over six months since the 
House passed the Heroes Act, comprehensive 
legislation to address these issues months 
ago. 
And all this time, Republicans have refused 
to lift a finger to provide relief to struggling 
families. It is shameful that it took this long for 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
come to the table. 
And let me be clear—$600 in direct pay-
ments and an additional $300 per week in un-
employment is not enough—in fact, it’s just 
half of the aid that we passed in the CARES 
Act. 
So, while I am disappointed in my Repub-
lican colleagues and recognize this bill is not 
ideal or as comprehensive as the Heroes Act- 
it will provide some much-needed relief to the 
American people until we can pass a more ro-
bust stimulus under the Biden Administration. 
I’d particularly like to thank all the staff from 
member offices, to committee offices, to lead-
ership and floor staff, who worked long hours 
and through the weekend to help put this 
package together. 
For small businesses, this bill takes action 
to authorize a second round of PPP loans to 
the hardest hit businesses. Importantly, it will 
set aside funding reserved for small busi-
nesses with 10 or fewer employees and those 
in underserved communities. It also utilizes 
small banks and mission-based community 
lenders to guarantee fair access to small em-
ployers. 
And finally, this bill provides for what we 
have been hearing on the ground from small

businesses—the need for cash infusions 
through grants. By establishing new guardrails 
and allocating $20 billion to the EIDL grant 
program, we are targeting the hardest hit 
small businesses to receive these grants. 
Meanwhile, 
as 
shuttered 
entertainment 
venues, including our cultural institutions and 
movie theaters, that depend on large crowds 
to survive have been closed by the pandemic 
and faced difficulties accessing PPP and other 
SBA programs, this bill creates a new $15 bil-
lion dollar grant program to target these estab-
lishments that have experienced a dramatic 
decline in revenue. 
But our efforts do not end here. We will con-
tinue to seek more assistance next year be-
cause Main Street, especially our independent 
restaurants, and working families deserve for 
us to come back to the table to provide a life-
line while we await vaccine distributions. 
So today, I’m voting yes but I urge my fel-
low members, let’s not stop here. Let’s come 
back in January and pass more relief for the 
American people. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
call attention to one of the many important 
provisions of today’s legislation. In particular, I 
rise to discuss Section 1109 of Title XI of Divi-
sion FF, relating to aquatic ecosystem protec-
tion, which comes from the FUTURE Western 
Water Infrastructure and Drought Resiliency 
title that I authored in H.R. 2 earlier this year. 
Today’s provision is an improved version of 
that legislation, and it is the result of the ongo-
ing bicameral water infrastructure negotiations 
between the committees of jurisdiction. I am 
grateful for the work done on both sides of the 
Capitol and both sides of the aisle to bring this 
to fruition. This aquatic ecosystem protection 
provision is designed to fund broadly-sup-
ported fish passage projects in the western 
states, and the specific intent is to help 
projects like the one in the Eel and Russian 
River basins in California, where we have a 
chance to significantly improve fish passage 
and habitat on the Eel River while providing 
long term certainty and reliability for Russian 
River water users. 
The Potter Valley Project Ad Hoc Com-
mittee has been refining this effort for several 
years, and we now have a Two-Basin Partner-
ship that is taking the next steps. The intent of 
this new aquatic ecosystem protection statute 
is to support the important work of the Two- 
Basin Partnership, as well as other commu-
nity-supported 
restoration 
projects 
like 
it 
around the west. 
I am including in the RECORD letters of sup-
port from the Round Valley Indian Tribes, 
Humboldt County, Sonoma County Water 
Agency, Mendocino County Inland Water and 
Power Commission, and California Trout—col-
lectively known as the Two-Basin Partner-
ship—as well as from the Nature Conser-
vancy, Trout Unlimited, and California Trout— 
collectively known as the California Salmon 
and Steelhead Coalition. 
I thank my colleagues for working with me 
to bring this legislation to fruition, and thank 
the staff in both the House and Senate who 
have helped in this effort, especially Matthew 
Muirragui from the House Natural Resources 
Committee and John Driscoll, Logan Ferree, 
and Ben Miller on my personal staff. I look for-
ward to working with the next administration to 
support this win-win outcome for the North 
Coast and North Bay. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN HUFFMAN: The Round Val-
ley 
Indian 
Tribes, 
Humboldt 
County, 
Sonoma County Water Agency, Mendocino 
County Inland Water and Power Commis-
sion, 
and 
California 
Trout, 
collectively 
known as the Two-Basin Partnership, write 
in strong support of the aquatic ecosystem 
restoration provision included in H.R. 2, 
which we understand you and your staff have 
negotiated for inclusion in the omnibus ap-
propriations bill. 
The Potter Valley Project is a hydro-
electric facility that, in addition to gener-
ating a small amount of electricity, diverts 
water from the Eel River into the Russian 
River basin. The Project’s main facilities in-
clude two dams on the Eel River, a diversion 
tunnel and a hydroelectric plant. Citing eco-
nomic concerns, current Project owner Pa-
cific Gas & Electric announced in January 
2019 that it would not seek a new license 
from Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion to continue operating the facilities. 
PG&E’s decision to not re-license the Project 
left an uncertain future for both Eel and 
Russian River interests. Instead of leaving it 
up to the utility and federal regulators to de-
termine the region’s water future, local lead-
ers decided to work together to protect the 
interests of both river basins. The Two-Basin 
Partnership is a direct outgrowth of that 
collaborative effort, which brought together 
diverse stakeholders to develop a com-
promise solution for the future of this aging 
and non-economically viable hydroelectric 
project. 
The Partners have joined together as the 
applicant for the Project, with the collective 
goal of restoring 288 linear river miles of 
spawning habitat at the headwaters of the 
Eel through the removal of Scott Dam, while 
ensuring water supply reliability on the Rus-
sian River. Additional components of the 
proposed Project Plan include improving a 
water diversion infrastructure at Cape Horn 
Dam and developing infrastructure to pro-
vide water to meet summer irrigation needs 
for farmers and ranchers in Potter Valley. 
As you know, this legislation would di-
rectly support the Two-Basin Solution’s 
shared objectives, which include: minimizing 
or avoiding adverse impacts to water supply 
reliability, 
fisheries, 
water 
quality 
and 
recreation in the Russian River and Eel 
River basins; improving fish passage and 
habitat on the Eel River sufficient to sup-
port recovery of naturally reproducing, self- 
sustaining and harvestable native anad-
romous fish populations including migratory 
access upstream and downstream at current 
project dam locations; and protecting tribal 
cultural, economic, and other interests in 
both the Eel and Russian River basins. 
On behalf of the Two-Basin Partners, we 
strongly support this inclusion and your con-
tinued support of our efforts on the Eel and 
Russian Rivers.

DECEMBER 18, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN HUFFMAN: The Nature Con-
servancy, Trout Unlimited, and California 
Trout, collectively known as the California 
Salmon and Steelhead Coalition, write in 
strong support of the aquatic ecosystem res-
toration provision included in H.R. 2, which 
we understand you and your staff have nego-
tiated for inclusion in the omnibus appro-
priations bill. 
The Coalition is a strategic partnership 
founded to increase streamflows in Califor-
nia’s North and Central Coast watersheds, 
with the goal of restoring and protecting 
wild salmon and steelhead and creating 
water reliability for people. We are working 
toward a California where water use manage-
ment harmonizes and meets the needs of peo-
ple, needs of fish and ecosystems. It is for 
these reasons that the Coalition is working 
together 
to 
support 
the 
Potter 
Valley 
Project relicensing effort as a major restora-
tion opportunity. 
The current Potter Valley Project Plan is 
built around a unique collaboration among 
conservationists, 
county 
governments, 
tribes, farmers and other water interests to 
shape a new future for the Project, a set of 
obsolete hydroelectric facilities in the upper 
Eel River and Russian River Watersheds. 
This effort, if successful, will implement one 
of the largest dam removals in the history of 
the United States while strengthening the 
security of local water supplies. 
The project consists of two dams on the 
upper Eel River—Scott and Cape Horn—as 
well as a system of trans-basin tunnels that 
divert 
approximately 
60,000 
acre-feet 
of 
water per year from the Eel to the Russian 
to generate hydroelectric power. This water 
ultimately flows to agricultural and munic-
ipal users in the Russian River Watershed. 
But, perhaps more importantly, the project 
blocks fish from reaching 288 linear stream 
miles above Scott Dam that were once the 
spawning grounds for some of the largest 
salmon and steelhead runs in California. 
In January 2019, PG&E chose to dis-
continue its efforts to renew the project’s li-
cense, which expires in 2022, from the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
This left the door open for a different entity 
to license the project. Seeing this as an op-
portunity to remove the dams blocking the 
headwaters of the Eel River, California 
Trout joined with a diverse coalition— 
Sonoma Water, Mendocino County Inland 
Water and Power Commission, and Humboldt 
County—to notify FERC that they would ex-
plore taking over the re-licensing of the 
project. Over the subsequent year, those par-
ties—joined by the Round Valley Tribe— 
worked with a team of technical consultants 
to develop a proposed plan to take over the 
project and implement a ‘‘Two-Basin Solu-
tion’’ that would remove Scott Dam, im-
prove fish passage at Cape Horn Dam and 
build new infrastructure to deliver secure 
water supplies to farmers who currently rely 
on the project. 
In the spring of 2020, the three Coalition 
groups helped negotiate an initial plan pro-
posing the removal of Scott Dam and the im-
plementation of a Two-Basin Solution to 
modernize this project to improve water sup-
ply reliability for farms and communities in 
the Russian and Eel River Basins; the plan 
will also help to restore struggling salmon 
and steelhead runs by reconnecting the river 
to its headwaters. In April the Coalition se-
cured a $1.1 million CDFW grant that will be 
used to develop that proposal into a com-
plete re-licensing plan. We have also made 
inroads with the communities that would be 
most affected by dam removal and lobbied 
for state and federal funding that will be 
needed to further develop and implement the 
plan.

California. Thank you for your leadership 
and support.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, the first wave of 
stimulus spending proved frustrating for a lot 
of small and medium sized business. 
Many mom and pop businesses ran in to 
loan processing problems because there were 
problems with their applications. 
Many applicants did not know that their ap-
plications needed to be cured from any de-
fects or that there were defects with their ap-
plication. 
Some other small businesses were rejected 
because their lender ran out of allocation be-
cause the lenders were focused on larger 
loans. 
That is why, Democrats were able to secure 
$325 billion in small business aid this time 
around. 
Democrats secured critical funding and pol-
icy changes to help small businesses, includ-
ing minority-owned businesses, and nonprofits 
recover from the pandemic. 
This deal includes over $284 billion for first 
and second forgivable PPP loans, dedicated 
set-asides for very small businesses and lend-
ing through community-based lenders like 
Community Development Financial Institutions 
and Minority Depository Institutions, and ex-
panded PPP eligibility for 501(c)(6) nonprofits, 
including destination marketing organizations, 
and local newspapers, TV and radio broad-
casters. $20 billion is included for new EIDL 
Grants for businesses in low-income commu-
nities, $3.5 billion for continued SBA debt re-
lief payments, and $2 billion for enhancements 
to SBA lending. 
This deal also includes $15 billion in dedi-
cated funding for live venues, independent 
movie theaters, and cultural institutions. 
Small businesses that took a PPP loan and 
saw their revenues fall by 25% will be eligible 
for a second loan. 
Congress will also allow PPP borrowers to 
take tax deductions for covered business ex-
penses. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1271, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question of adoption of the mo-
tion is divided. 
The first portion of the divided ques-
tion is: Will the House concur in the 
Senate amendment with the matter 
proposed to be inserted as Divisions B, 
C, E, and F of the amendment of the 
House? 
The question is on the first portion of

BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2020 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (S. 4996) to en-
sure funding of the United States 
trustees, extend temporary bankruptcy 
judgeships, and for other purposes, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MFUME). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 4996 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bankruptcy 
Administration Improvement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Because of the importance of the goal 
that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at 
no cost to the taxpayer, Congress has closely 
monitored the funding needs of the bank-
ruptcy system, including by requiring peri-
odic reporting by the Attorney General re-
garding the United States Trustee System 
Fund. 
(2) Congress has amended the various 
bankruptcy fees as necessary to ensure that 
the bankruptcy system remains self-sup-
porting, while also fairly allocating the costs 
of the system among those who use the sys-
tem. 
(3) Because the bankruptcy system is 
interconnected, the result has been a system 
of fees, including filing fees, quarterly fees in 
chapter 11 cases, and other fees, that to-
gether fund the courts, judges, United States 
trustees, and chapter 7 case trustees nec-
essary for the bankruptcy system to func-
tion. 
(4) This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act— 
(A) ensure adequate funding of the United 
States trustees, supports the preservation of 
existing bankruptcy judgeships that are ur-
gently needed to handle existing and antici-
pated increases in business and consumer 
caseloads, and provides long-overdue addi-
tional compensation for chapter 7 case trust-
ees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reor-

EXPLANATORY MATERIAL STATE-
MENT 
ON 
THE 
INTELLIGENCE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FIS-
CAL YEAR 2021, SUBMITTED BY 
MR. SCHIFF, CHAIRMAN OF THE 
HOUSE 
PERMANENT 
SELECT 
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
The following is the explanation of 
the Intelligence Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021 (hereinafter, ‘‘the 
Act’’). 
This explanation reflects the result 
of 
negotiations 
and 
disposition 
of 
issues reached between the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) 
and the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the 
(hereinafter, ‘‘the Agreement’’). The 
explanation shall have the same effect 
with respect to the implementation of 
the Act as if it were a joint explana-
tory statement of a conference com-
mittee. The term ‘‘Committees’’ refers 
to both SSCI and HPSCI. 
The 
explanation 
comprises 
three 
parts: an overview of the application of 
the annex to accompany this state-
ment; unclassified congressional direc-
tion; and a section-by-section analysis 
of the legislative text. 
PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED 
ANNEX 
The classified nature of U.S. intel-
ligence activities prevents the SSCI 
and HPSCI (collectively, the ‘‘congres-
sional intelligence committees’’) from 
publicly disclosing many details con-
cerning 
the 
conclusions 
and 
rec-
ommendations 
of 
the 
Agreement. 
Therefore, a classified Schedule of Au-
thorizations and a classified annex 
have been prepared to describe in de-
tail the scope and intent of the con-
gressional intelligence committees’ ac-
tions. The Agreement authorizes the 
Intelligence Community (IC) to obli-
gate and expend funds not altered or 
modified by the classified Schedule of 
Authorizations as requested in the 
President’s budget, subject to modi-
fication under applicable reprogram-
ming procedures. 
The classified annex is the result of 
negotiations between the congressional 
intelligence 
committees. 
They 
rec-
oncile the differences between the con-
gressional intelligence committees’ re-
spective versions of the bill for the Na-
tional Intelligence Program (NIP) for 
Fiscal Year 2021. The Agreement also 
makes recommendations for the Mili-
tary Intelligence Program (MIP) and 
the Information Systems Security Pro-
gram (ISSP), consistent with the Na-

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 2020 
No. 218 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Beautiful Savior, Your mighty power 
makes us glad. We celebrate the vic-
tories You have given us in the past 
and trust You with our future. 
Lord, You have been our dwelling 
place in all generations, and we are 
sustained 
by 
Your 
steadfast 
love. 
Today, surround our Senators with the 
shield of Your favor as they labor to 
keep our Nation strong. Inspire them 
to be obedient to Your commands, 
doing what You desire of them as You 
fill them with Your wisdom. 
Lord, manifest Your power through 
their labors so that this Nation will 
fulfill Your purposes. May Your angels 
guard us in all our ways. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, his-
tory will look back at 2020 and find 
many lessons and even some silver lin-
ings to unpack. 
The loss of more than 300,000 Amer-
ican lives so far will be mourned for 
years to come. Operation Warp Speed, 
which 
President 
Trump 
launched, 
turned out to be a historic public-pri-
vate partnership. It has delivered a 
lifesaving vaccine in record time, shat-
tering scientific benchmarks along the 
way. For the last 9 months, Americans 
have pulled together in shared sacrifice 
to do their part. 
As the COVID–19 vaccine makes its 
way into the communities across our 
country as it is right now, I encourage 
my fellow Iowans to keep pulling to-
gether. When public health officials 
say it is your turn to get a vaccine, roll 
up your sleeve. I will be doing the same 
when my turn arrives. 
Getting immunized is the only way 
we will beat the virus and get back to 
the normal way of American life. His-
tory will show Americans turned the 
page on the pandemic when all of us 
roll up our sleeves. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday leaders in the Senate and the 
House and the Secretary of the Treas-
ury reached a major agreement that 
struggling Americans have needed for 
months. 
We are going to pass another historic 
rescue package to help American fami-
lies through this pandemic. We are 
going to pass full-year government 
funding so the Armed Forces and all 
Federal Departments have the re-
sources and the certainty they need. 
And we are going to do both of these 
things as soon as possible. 
Senate Republicans have been trying 
since July—July—to get more tar-
geted, bipartisan relief into the hands 
of the American people. Back in July, 
we proposed to send about $1 trillion to 
priorities including a second round of 
the Paycheck Protection Program, di-
rect checks for households, and funding 
for healthcare providers, testing, and 
K–12 schools—back in July. 
Democrats said no. They said they 
would block anything short of their 
multitrillion-dollar leftwing wish list. 
Here was one headline that particu-
larly underscores their view: ‘‘$2 tril-
lion or bust: Democrats draw red line 
in coronavirus spending battle.’’ 
So, in July and in August, when Re-
publican Senators tried to extend ex-
piring Federal unemployment benefits, 
Democrats blocked us. Laid-off work-
ers lost their benefits. 
In September and again in October, 
as people kept hurting, the virus kept 
spreading, and schools tried to find 
footing, every Republican voted for a 
multihundred-billion-dollar 
package. 
Both times Democrats blocked the re-
lief. Their view was all or nothing. 
But a few days ago, with a new Presi-
dent-elect of their own party, every-
thing changed. Democrats suddenly 
came around to our position that we 
should find consensus, make a law 
where we agree, and get urgent help 
out the door. 
In a few days of hard work, we have 
assembled another historic bipartisan 
rescue package: just under $900 billion 
of relief targeted toward our fellow 
Americans who need help the most. 
I will begin where this pandemic will 
end: vaccinations. Thanks to the ge-
nius of science and the leadership of 
President 
Trump, 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed has produced safe and effective 
vaccines. Now, we need to distribute 
them nationwide. 
This rescue package provides many 
billions more dollars to expand vaccine 
purchasing and vaccine distribution. 
Until we have won, we need to keep 
wearing masks and taking precautions. 
Even so, more Americans will fall ill, 
so this legislation continues to fund 
health providers and COVID testing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7888 
December 21, 2020 
The pandemic has fallen especially 
hard on children and parents. Our leg-
islation includes major funding—more 
than $80 billion—for K–12 schools to re-
open safely and get kids’ educations 
back on track. There are billions more 
for childcare providers to reopen safely 
as well, and new investments in rural 
broadband will improve both education 
and telehealth down the road. 
Then there are Americans’ personal 
finances, the impossible kitchen table 
questions that millions of working 
families have faced this year through 
no fault of their own. 
Back in March, thanks to Chairman 
RUBIO, Senator COLLINS, and Senator 
CARDIN, we created a Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. It saved small busi-
nesses and helped millions of American 
workers 
keep 
receiving 
paychecks 
rather than pink slips. 
It would be insanity for us to have 
saved these jobs all this time only to 
drop the ball with the end in sight, so 
this bill will send more than $280 bil-
lion to reopen the PPP for a targeted 
second 
round, 
and 
we 
made 
sure 
churches and faith-based organizations 
will continue to be eligible. 
Of course, millions have already been 
laid off, so months after Republicans 
tried to stop benefits from expiring in 
the first place, this package will re-
sume a temporary Federal supplement 
to unemployment insurance, and it ex-
tends other programs for the self-em-
ployed and gig workers that would 
have expired. 
Thanks to the particular leadership 
and direction of President Trump and 
Secretary Mnuchin, households will re-
ceive a second round of direct relief 
checks—$600 per adult and per child. 
This is just some of the aid that will be 
heading Americans’ way in a matter of 
hours. No sprawling leftwing wish list, 
no unconstrained bailouts for State 
and local government with no connec-
tion to COVID needs—just smart, tar-
geted, bipartisan policies, what Senate 
Republicans have been recommending 
since the summer. 
I cited a figure of $900 billion, but lis-
ten to this. The net new cost—new 
cost—is less than roughly $350 billion. 
We are recovering more than half a 
trillion dollars in unspent money that 
Congress had already set aside and 
channeling it to these urgent needs. 
Thanks to our colleague Senator 
TOOMEY, this legislation winds down 
some of the temporary emergency pow-
ers we lent the Federal Reserve to 
make sure our financial system sur-
vived last spring. 
A lot of talented leaders helped make 
this happen. Leader MCCARTHY
has 
been an invaluable partner. White 
House Chief of Staff MARK MEADOWS 
has been central. Colleagues such as 
Senators COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, ROM-
NEY, CASSIDY, and PORTMAN
helped 
prod the Senate toward consensus with 
their bipartisan work. And I just men-
tioned Senator TOOMEY. 
I want to give particular thanks to 
the Secretary of the Treasury, Sec-
retary Mnuchin. Before the pandemic, 
Steven was already a crucial partner 
for the Republican majorities in Con-
gress. We enacted the most consequen-
tial tax reform in a generation. We 
helped create the conditions for explo-
sive job growth, wage growth, and 
record-low unemployment. Our country 
had the strongest possible starting 
point to weather this storm. 
This year, the Secretary has been 
even more essential. He helped Con-
gress develop and pass the historic 
CARES Act in record time. It pre-
vented a complete economic collapse at 
the hands of the virus. From drafting 
CARES to implementing it, to the in-
tervening months, to this latest pack-
age, Secretary Mnuchin has been an ex-
tremely capable and patient partner. 
He helped guide our Nation through 
this dark period toward the daybreak 
that lies ahead. 
On behalf of the Senate and the coun-
try, I thank the Secretary for his 
countless hours of work and his incred-
ible 
effectiveness 
in 
extraordinary 
times. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a related matter, while this rescue 
package will dominate headlines, we 
are also set to fund the entire Federal 
Government on a bipartisan basis. 
We must not overlook the tireless 
work from Chairman SHELBY, Senator 
LEAHY, and our Appropriations Com-
mittees in both Chambers. Their hard 
work goes beyond just avoiding shut-
downs. Full-year funding bills give our 
Armed Forces the certainty to make 
plans and budgets so we can continue 
to modernize our capabilities and keep 
pace with competitors like Russia and 
China. 
This year’s bills also tackle impor-
tant domestic priorities. Everything 
from agricultural research to the fight 
against opioid abuse, to border security 
and law enforcement are provided for. 
We aren’t defunding the police or abol-
ishing ICE around here—not on our 
watch. 
Federal law enforcement from the 
U.S. Marshals to the Border Patrol will 
get the resources they need to protect 
innocent Americans and uphold the 
rule of law. 
And I want to especially thank 
Chairman SHELBY and Congresswoman 
GRANGER for beating back a number of 
far-left poison pills. These bills main-
tain pro-life guardrails on funding, se-
cure President Trump’s approach to 
title X, and respect our citizens’ Sec-
ond Amendment rights. 
The Senate is about to cast some in-
credibly impactful votes. None of us 
think any of this legislation is perfect, 
but a big bipartisan majority of us rec-
ognize the incredible amount of good it 
will do when we send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
The American people have waited 
long enough. I am glad for our country 
that we are now moving ahead to-
gether. 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will be in a period of morning busi-
ness, with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
WINTER SOLSTICE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I 
say anything else, I want to say happy 
winter solstice. And 2020 is almost 
gone. It is an announcement I made to 
my family this morning, and I hope 
America shares it. We are turning a 
corner as a nation and to a new year 
and a new season, and, I hope, a much 
better day for all of us across this 
country. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
9 
months ago, in March, we created the 
relief known as the CARES Act, and it 
passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. 
It was a measure intended to address 
the pandemic and the resultant eco-
nomic downturn in America. I have 
heard various estimates of the total 
cost, but it is somewhere in the range 
of $2 trillion to $3 trillion. It was the 
largest single investment in our Nation 
in our history. It was a massive na-
tional response to a massive national 
health crisis, and it worked, at least on 
the economic front. I believe that it 
created demand in our economy that 
otherwise would not have been there, 
and it gave some businesses a chance 
to survive. Sadly, all did not, and many 
are still suffering. But it was nec-
essary. It was done on a bipartisan 
basis. It was massive, and I believe it 
achieved its goal. 
It started us on the course of dealing 
with the COVID–19 coronavirus, and 
one has to look back and say it only 
had limited success in that regard. As 
of today, we have lost more than 317,000 
American lives, and millions have been 
infected. Our hospitals are still overrun 
with patients. But we did the right 
thing, and we quickly realized what we 
did could make a difference. 
The 
unemployment 
compensation, 
which we provided for millions of 
Americans, was not only the humane 
thing to do but, as economists would 
tell you, it was the best single thing 
you could do to fight a recession. A

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7889 
December 21, 2020 
person who is unemployed, without a 
paycheck, will spend virtually every 
penny they are given into the econ-
omy, not bank it away for another day. 
That spending created consumer de-
mand and gave some businesses a fight-
ing chance. 
The Paycheck Protection Program, 
through the Small Business Adminis-
tration, was the work product of many, 
but I want to single out Senators BEN 
CARDIN and MARCO RUBIO for their bi-
partisan effort. I later saw Senator 
COLLINS and Senator SHAHEEN working 
to give it another day. But here was a 
program which extended a lifeline to 
American businesses—forgivable loans 
if the money were spent on the neces-
sities: utilities and rent and mortgage 
and payroll. 
I will quickly add that we have a re-
sponsibility to taxpayers to make an 
honest assessment of how that program 
was implemented. I am sorry to say 
that I have already heard anecdotal 
evidence that some of the loans were 
not carefully made. That is to be ex-
pected in something of this magnitude. 
But, by and large, this program was es-
sential. 
Money 
that 
we 
put 
into 
healthcare made a difference. The 
CARES Act also protected those who 
were renting from eviction, delayed the 
payment of student loans, and a litany 
of other measures that made a dif-
ference. 
That bill—the CARES Act of March 
of 2020—was really written with a no-
tion that this was a short- to medium- 
term challenge. Many thought that, by 
the middle of this year, we would be 
turning the corner. Sadly, that was not 
the case. As of July, it was apparent 
that the worst was yet to come. 
Speaker PELOSI, of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, introduced a measure 
known as the Heroes Act in an attempt 
to have a follow-on relief bill after the 
CARES Act. It was passed but was not 
considered in this Chamber. 
The Republican leader, who spoke 
earlier today, said at the time that 
there were two things he wanted to 
make clear. First, he wanted to meas-
ure whether it was a needed follow-on 
bill. Second, he was drawing a redline 
that said unless we provided immunity 
from liability for corporations and 
businesses, he wouldn’t consider an-
other 
relief 
act. 
And 
the 
matter 
stalled. 
The Speaker went on to pass another 
bill, a smaller one in size, but nothing 
happened. She went into conversations 
with Mr. Mnuchin and Senator SCHU-
MER on the Democratic side here, but 
little was produced from that ex-
change. We were stuck, stalled. As of 
the election day of November 3, it 
wasn’t clear that there would ever be 
another relief bill this year. 
I want to say a word about what hap-
pened next because I know more detail 
about that than some. It was about 4 
weeks ago when a Republican Senator 
and a Democratic Senator invited six 
of their colleagues for dinner. It was a 
bipartisan 
group. 
When 
Senator 
MCCONNELL mentioned the participants 
earlier, he only mentioned Repub-
licans. I want to let you know who was 
in on it on both sides, Democrats and 
Republicans. Yes, it was Senator COL-
LINS, 
Senator 
MURKOWSKI, 
Senator 
CASSIDY, and Senator ROMNEY at the 
initial meeting; on the Democratic 
side, Senator MANCHIN, Senator WAR-
NER, myself, and Senator SHAHEEN. Our 
ranks changed over the several weeks 
when we were debating to include 
MAGGIE
HASSAN
of New Hampshire, 
ANGUS
KING
of 
Maine, 
and 
ROB 
PORTMAN of Ohio. 
For 3 or 4 weeks, we tried to write a 
relief bill. We did it by phone, by Zoom, 
and through staff work that was end-
less. Finally, Tuesday of last week, we 
were able to announce it. Let me get 
this number right, a $748 billion con-
sensus bill for relief. We were unable to 
reach a final agreement when it came 
to State and local funding, as well as 
the question of liability. We set those 
aside, but we produced this $748 billion 
bill, much of which is included in this 
relief package we are going to consider 
today. 
I want to thank my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, for their 
patience and determination to reach 
that point. I really believe that we 
ended up opening the conversation. The 
leaders, thank goodness, moved in to 
follow on and make it a reality. 
Today, we are going to seriously con-
sider a measure to keep America’s 
economy moving and give us a fighting 
chance against the coronavirus. I think 
this bipartisan effort, this grassroots 
bipartisan effort by the 8 of us—soon to 
be 10 or 11 before it was all over—will 
make a significant difference in this 
Nation. We are going to come through 
with dramatic offers of relief across 
the board. It is in the range of $900 bil-
lion, is the total. I don’t know the 
exact amount. 
It is going to provide several more 
weeks of unemployment compensation. 
The final agreement, I am told, re-
duced the number of weeks that we 
proposed, and I am sorry for that, but 
it did include a cash payment, which, 
under the right circumstances—I don’t 
know all the details—could be a god-
send for many families across the 
United States who are desperately try-
ing to survive in troubling and difficult 
times. 
It also extends the PPP program I 
mentioned earlier for small businesses 
to give them a chance for the kinds of 
loans and forgivable loans that might 
give them an opportunity to see an-
other day. 
Money 
is 
there 
especially 
for 
coronavirus vaccine distribution and 
logistics—testing, tracing, and the vac-
cine. 
I would say this. In fairness, I agree 
with the Republican leader, who gave 
credit to the Trump administration for 
the Warp Speed program. That has 
been a dramatic success. To think that 
we have come up with not just one but 
two vaccines that work against this 
COVID–19 is an amazing achievement, 
and I am glad that it received the high 
priority it deserved under this adminis-
tration and particularly glad that the 
researchers and scientists who spent 
countless hours exploring opportuni-
ties for this vaccine were ultimately 
successful. America owes them a great, 
great debt of gratitude. 
What is going to happen next? There 
are some parts of this measure which, 
as we study it, we will realize are inad-
equate. Merely extending unemploy-
ment benefits for 10 or 11 weeks may 
not be long enough. We may have to re-
turn to take a look at it. Whether we 
have enough money for logistical sup-
port for vaccines remains to be seen. 
Whether the businesses of Americans 
need another helping hand, we also 
have to consider that as well. 
Let us hope that in the new year and 
the new President’s administration, 
that we will have a more positive, bi-
partisan approach. This experience this 
year was disappointing in some re-
spects, but it ended well with the bill 
we are going to consider this after-
noon. 
I want to thank all the colleagues, 
Senators, who joined me in this bipar-
tisan effort, who started the conversa-
tion on Capitol Hill last week. We have 
more work to be done. We are not out 
of the woods. We have to consider 
measures that will address the reality 
of the economy in the future. We want 
to make sure that Americans have a 
chance to get back to work and busi-
nesses have a chance to survive in this 
time of COVID–19. 
By the middle of next year, it has 
been estimated—this is not for certain, 
but I hope it is right—by the middle of 
next year, all Americans who are seek-
ing a vaccination will be able to re-
ceive one, and that will be a day when 
we can finally hope that we will have 
reached that magic number of herd im-
munity and turn the corner on this ter-
rible pandemic. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER for 
coming to the floor and asking me to 
say a word or two more. I want to say 
this about the Members of the Senate, 
both 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans. 
There has been more activity on the 
floor of the Senate in the last several 
days than I have ever seen. And it isn’t 
just rollcalls; it is Members standing 
on the floor to discuss the details of 
this agreement. There were parts we 
were never going to agree on, that is 
for sure, but so many times, I would 
step into a conversation on the floor 
where they would be hammering out 
the final details of an agreement. It 
was heartening. There has been so lit-
tle of that activity on the floor in the 
past year or two. It is perilously close 
to legislating to have Members of the 
Senate of both political parties work-
ing toward agreeable language that can 
solve America’s problems. Let’s hope 
we have more of that. 
Unfortunately, the Senate has drifted 
away from its traditional role of delib-
eration and legislation. This year, for

example, we have only considered 29 
amendments in the entire year in the 
Senate, absent the impeachment pro-
ceeding. 
Twenty-nine 
amendments. 
The year before, 2019, there were 22 
amendments. That is a waste of talent. 
The men and women of the Senate 
should come together, hopefully on a 
bipartisan basis, but regardless, should 
come together to debate the issues and 
offer their best ideas and, having of-
fered them, be given the chance to vote 
up or down. I think that appetite is 
strong on both sides of the aisle. 
On the Democratic side, Senator 
MERKLEY of Oregon has been a leader 
in discussing changes in the Senate 
rules, and we reached out to Repub-
licans as well to engage in that con-
versation. I think we are a better Sen-
ate for it if we do it and a better Na-
tion for it if the debate becomes rel-
evant to the issues of the day from peo-
ple across America who are watching 
closely to see if we understand what 
they are struggling with economically 
and politically.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
heard the remarks of the Senator from 
Illinois. It is a hope that we can change 
the way the Senate operates and do 
more amendments and do more debat-
ing on the floor. We haven’t seen much 
give from some of our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, but hopefully 
that could and will happen. 
Now, about remarks here, every day, 
it seems, for the past week or so, I have 
come to the floor ready to talk about 
the merits of bipartisan legislation we 
have been drafting, not wanting to be 
critical at all. Then I listen to the Re-
publican leader. The leader’s remarks 
just about every day this week as he 
has opened the Senate have been so 
nastily partisan and in so many ways 
false that I have no choice but to cor-
rect the record as the Democratic lead-
er. 
The Republican leader’s accusation 
that the blame for this bill’s delay lies 
totally on one side is just ridiculous. It 
is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ thinking. It 
defies all the facts as to what we have 
seen. Then his comparison—that the 
agreement we are voting on today and 
the most recent Republican offer are so 
similar—is absurd. The two bills are 
nothing alike, and I had to point that 
out several times. 
I have a chart here. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this chart printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. SCHUMER. I am just going to 
read from it, comparing the new, bipar-
tisan relief agreement to the December 
1 GOP proposal of Leader MCCONNELL. 
How about direct payments? This bill 
has $600 per individual, $1,200 per mar-
ried couple, $600 child dependent. Many 
of us didn’t think that was enough, but 
it is in the bill. Do you know how much 
was in the Republican leader’s pro-
posal? Zero. 
Unemployment insurance. This bill 
that we are voting on has $300 per week 
of enhanced UI and other program ex-
tensions through March 14. What does 
the Republican leader’s bill have? Zero 
enhanced UI. Program extensions end 
January 31. 
This bill has $13 billion in SNAP; the 
Republican leader’s bill, zero. 
This bill has $25 billion in rental as-
sistance; the Republican leader’s bill, 
zero. 
This bill has $45 billion in transpor-
tation for airlines and mass transit and 
buses and airports and highways. What 
does the Republican leader’s bill have? 
Zero. 
This 
bill 
has, 
very 
importantly, 
money for community development fi-
nancial institutions and minority in-
stitutions, $12 billion. What does the 
Republican leader’s bill have? Zero. 
SBA grants, $20 billion this year; Re-
publican leader’s bill, zero. 
Debt payments and enhancements for 
SBA. This bill, $5.5 billion; Republican 
bill, zero. 
SAMHSA funding for mental health 
and substance use disorder. This bill, 
$4.25 billion; Republican leader’s bill, 
zero. 
NIH COVID research, $1.25 billion; 
Republican bill, zero. 
Broadband 
so 
homes 
can 
get 
broadband. This bill, $7 billion; Repub-
lican leader’s bill, zero. 
The list could go on. There is a com-
plete difference between the two bills. 
We all know as well that the Repub-
lican leader, who blames Democrats for 
delay, said for several months that the 
Senate should be on pause. As Demo-
crats were demanding more action, the 
Republican leader was unmoved. The 
Republican leader’s answer was that 20 
Republican Senators wanted to do 
nothing more at all. When he finally 
proposed legislation, it was completely 
partisan, insufficient, and littered with 
poison pills. 
I forgot to add one thing that was in 
the leader’s bill but not in this bill— 
the broad corporate liability immunity 
provision, which the Senator from Illi-
nois tried to straighten out. Another 
huge difference—a poison pill. 
So when the leader finally proposed 
legislation because of public pressure 
to do something, it was partisan—no 
Democratic input, zero—insufficient, 
much too little in so many areas, as I 
mentioned, and littered with poison 
pills designed to ensure the bill would 
fail. Most notably was a provision to 
give corporations, no matter how egre-
gious their behavior, sweeping immu-
nity from legal accountability. Leader 
MCCONNELL said on the floor that for 
Republicans, corporate immunity was 
a red line. 
And he blames the Democrats, as he 
did again today, for why this bill is 
being debated now? It is just turning 
truth on its head. It is like ‘‘Alice in 
Wonderland.’’ 
Even in the recent negotiations, the 
Republican majority made an eleventh 
hour demand that had nothing to do 
with helping people during this pan-
demic but, rather, sabotaged the in-
coming Biden administration’s recov-
ery effort and restricted the Federal 
Reserve’s ability to save jobs and right 
the economy in a time of crisis. 
Thankfully, 
the 
agreement 
we 
reached contains neither the leader’s 
corporate immunity provision nor Sen-
ator TOOMEY’s last-minute provision to 
handicap the Fed’s authority to sta-
bilize the economy in a crisis. And it 
will do a whole lot of good, besides, 
some of the programs I mentioned. 
Look, after months of tense and dif-
ficult negotiations, we have this agree-
ment. It is not as large as Democrats 
want. It is certainly larger than what 
many Republicans want. That is the 
nature of compromise. It does us no 
good to end the year with the kind of 
bitter, partisan fighting that has de-
fined too much of the year. In a new 
session and under a new administra-
tion, we can and should do better be-
cause our job is far from over. 
The bill today is a good bill. Today is 
a good day, but it is certainly not the 
end of the story. It cannot be the end 
of the story. Anyone who thinks this 
bill is enough doesn’t know what is 
going on in America. Anyone who 
thinks this bill is enough hasn’t heard 
the desperation in the voices of their 
constituents, has not looked into the 
eyes of a small business owner on the 
brink of ruin. 
By all rights, there should be direct 
assistance in this bill for State and 
local governments. The checks should

be larger. While this agreement in-
cludes a new and larger forgivable PPP 
loan for restaurants, we need to do 
much more for restaurants. We have bi-
partisan legislation to deliver the re-
lief that is truly needed, the RES-
TAURANTS Act, which, regrettably, 
did not make it into this legislation. 
We must do all we can to save res-
taurants, and I will not stop fighting 
until we pass the RESTAURANTS Act 
into law. This bill cannot and will not 
be the final word on congressional re-
lief from the coronavirus pandemic. 
This is an emergency survival package. 
When we come back in January, our 
No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left 
by the bill and then get the economy 
moving with strong Federal input. 
Still, the significance of this package 
should not be underestimated. It will 
be the second largest bill—the second 
largest Federal input—in the history of 
our country. It will be the second larg-
est amount of Federal dollars going to 
the people ever. The times demand it. 
Even some of our conservative Repub-
lican friends will vote for it, and it is 
good we have it. For much of the year, 
it looked unlikely that it would ever 
get done, and our success today, our 
ability to pass this bill today, should 
give us confidence we can do more. We 
can end the year on a rare note of opti-
mism. 
Now, Queen Elizabeth, every year, 
gives a talk to her subjects about the 
status of the monarchy and the British 
royal family. In a very challenging 
year, 
she 
called 
the 
year 
annus 
horribilis—a horrible year. Unlike in 
1992, which was the year Elizabeth re-
ferred to the problems with Charles 
and Diana, this year has been an annus 
horribilis not just for Great Britain 
and the royal family, which she was 
talking about, but an annus horribilis 
for the entire world. 
The global COVID–19 pandemic has 
infected more than 70 million people 
across the globe. Another 500 million 
have gone, likely, undiagnosed. There 
are 1.6 million people who have died, 20 
percent of whom have been Americans, 
more than 315,000—more than the en-
tire population of Pittsburgh or St. 
Louis, more than all of the American 
combat deaths in World War II. The 
September 11 attacks to my fair city 
shaped much of the first decade of this 
century. In 2020, our dear country has 
suffered the equivalent of a 9/11 attack 
every day for 106 days in a row. 
We have lost so much. We have 
missed holidays and reunions, retire-
ments and graduations, bar mitzvahs 
and confirmations, weddings and funer-
als. Trapped in our homes, our compan-
ions were isolation and loneliness and 
the faint glow of tiny screens. The 
image of seeing people on the screen, 
watching their loved ones pass away 
when they couldn’t be with them, will 
stay with us forever. Doctors had to 
stack iPads in waiting rooms for end- 
of-life conversations—how tragic, how 
awful. There were cars lined up, bump-
er to bumper, for food assistance. 
Grandchildren, wrapped in protective 
gear, waved goodbye to grandparents 
from across the silence of a hospital 
room. 
It has been a horrible year—annus 
horribilis. Yet here, at the very end, fi-
nally, there is hope—not just one, not 
just two, but three strong beacons of 
hope. One, soon many Americans will 
have the vaccine. Two, Joe Biden will 
become President. He has the experi-
ence and the empathy to handle the 
COVID crisis and will replace a man 
who has shown no capacity or even in-
terest in doing so. And, three, we are 
on the verge of passing another his-
toric, bipartisan relief bill to deliver 
emergency assistance during a time of 
national emergency. So there are three 
beacons of hope: the vaccine, a new ad-
ministration, and a bill that will help 
in an emergency. 
Very soon, our country will close the 
book on the most chaotic President in 
recent history. Joe Biden, an experi-
enced leader and a person of funda-
mental human decency, will become 
the 
46th 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
KAMALA
HARRIS, 
my 
good 
friend and hard-working colleague, will 
become the first woman, the first 
Black person, and the first Asian 
American to ascend to the Vice Presi-
dency of the United States. Together, 
they will return competency and com-
passion to our government after 4 long 
years of division and demonization, 
which far too many people have toler-
ated and gone along with. 
Even though this disease has not 
been vanquished yet, there is light at 
the end of the tunnel in the form of a 
vaccine. Everyone should appreciate 
how miraculous that truly is. It usu-
ally takes between 5 and 10 years to de-
velop a new vaccine—5 to 10 years. It 
took American doctors, biochemists, 
and medical researchers less than 10 
months to produce not one but two via-
ble vaccines for the coronavirus. The 
discovery of a vaccine in a single cal-
endar year is the crowning scientific 
achievement of the 21st century—the 
medical Manhattan Project of our 
times. It is a reminder that, when we 
work together and persevere and sac-
rifice for one another, nothing—noth-
ing—is beyond our capacity as a na-
tion. 
The same resilience and innovation 
and fortitude that saw our country 
through its darkest hours has emerged 
once again. COVID–19 has changed our 
country, but it has not changed our 
character. America is the night-shift 
nurse fashioning protective equipment 
from shoelaces and sheets of vinyl. 
America is a restaurant owner who 
sent meals to frontline workers for 
free. America is the home-stitched 
mask sent to friends and families. It is 
the metallic clang of pots and pans 
that 
celebrates 
essential 
workers. 
America is the grocery store clerk and 
the busdriver and the plasma donor and 
the lab technician, late at night, 
poring over the results of a clinical 
trial. It is the Brooklyn doctor, 62, on 
the verge of retirement, who, for 2 
straight weeks, worked day shifts at 
the ICU and night shifts at the nearby 
hospital before finally succumbing to 
the disease himself. 
Last week, the first American—a 
nurse 
in 
Queens—was 
vaccinated 
against COVID–19. Many millions will 
soon follow. Eventually, our businesses 
will reopen, our economy will reopen, 
and life will reopen. We will travel and 
worship and send our kids to school 
and see our friends and be together 
again. It won’t be tomorrow or next 
week or even next month, but it will 
happen, not because we merely waited 
long enough, not because we were pa-
tient, but because we persevered. 
Our job right now is to help the coun-
try get from this stormy present to 
that hopeful future, to survive this 
dark winter until spring thaws the ice. 
Our job is to do what is necessary—pass 
this bill, pass another stronger bill 
next year—whatever it takes to hold 
our country together until we eradi-
cate the awful scourge of this disease. 
At the end of this annus horribilis— 
this horrible year—let us give the 
American people another reason to 
hope. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am, like 
many of my colleagues, very pleased 
that we have reached an agreement on 
a final COVID relief package and none 
too soon. 
Last week, we celebrated what will, 
hopefully, be a turning point in the 
COVID fight—the first coronavirus vac-
cinations. We need to build on that mo-
mentum and make sure that vaccine 
distribution goes swiftly and smoothly 
so that we can vaccinate as many 
Americans as possible as quickly as 
possible. The COVID relief package will 
help us achieve that goal by providing 
important funding for vaccine distribu-
tion. It will also provide critical sup-
port to Americans to help them weath-
er the rest of the pandemic, including a 
second round of paycheck protection 
funding for the hardest hit small busi-
nesses, money to help schools reopen 
safely and operate so that our kids 
aren’t left behind, and more money for 
coronavirus treatment and other front-
line medical priorities. 
I am very pleased that the final pack-
age includes my Paycheck Protection 
for Producers Act, which will help 
more farmers and ranchers benefit 
from the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. The bill also includes funding to 
allow the Department of Agriculture to 
provide additional assistance to farm-
ers and ranchers. Ag producers were 
dealing with a challenging agricultural 
economy even before the pandemic hit, 
and the coronavirus has only made 
things tougher. I strongly advocated 
for including additional funding for 
farmers and ranchers in this legisla-
tion, and I am very glad that the final 
bill includes this support.

December 21, 2020 
The final package also explicitly 
makes biofuels, like ethanol and bio-
diesel, eligible for USDA assistance at 
the discretion of the Secretary of Agri-
culture. Biofuel producers have suf-
fered from a drop in fuel demand dur-
ing the pandemic, and I hope the Sec-
retary will ensure that they are able to 
receive assistance, which will further 
help our ag economy recover. 
I am very happy that the COVID re-
lief package includes an extension of 
the Thune-Warner Employer Participa-
tion in Repayment Act. The Thune- 
Warner bill allows employers to make 
tax-free contributions to their employ-
ees’ student loans of up to $5,250 per 
year. This is a win for employees, who 
get help in paying off their student 
loans, and it is a win for employers as 
they look to attract and retain tal-
ented workers. Our bill was included in 
the CARES Act—the major coronavirus 
relief legislation we passed in March— 
but it was scheduled to expire at the 
end of the year. Under the coronavirus 
relief package, however, our legislation 
will be extended for an additional 5 
years. 
The COVID relief package also in-
cludes Senator CORNYN’s Small Busi-
ness Expense Protection Act, which I 
cosponsored. This legislation will en-
sure that small businesses that qualify 
for forgiveness of their Paycheck Pro-
tection Program loans can still deduct 
their ordinary business expenses on 
their taxes. 
The relief package also includes leg-
islation I introduced this summer with 
Senator ENZI that will establish anti-
fraud measures within the Pandemic 
Unemployment Assistance program so 
that we can ensure that beneficiaries 
are truly eligible for the program. 
We 
have 
addressed 
a 
lot 
of 
coronavirus priorities in this relief 
package, and I am very pleased that we 
are finally getting it out the door. Re-
publicans spent months pushing for ad-
ditional, targeted coronavirus relief, 
and I am glad the Democrats finally 
decided that they were ready to work 
with us in a bipartisan way to arrive at 
this legislation. 
The Senate Democratic leader was 
just here, once again, attacking Repub-
licans over their failure—the Demo-
crats’ failure—to work with us to get a 
coronavirus 
relief 
bill 
sooner. 
We 
brought up multiple times on the floor 
legislation that could have passed if 
there had been a little cooperation 
from the Democrats. He pointed out 
that this bill we are going to be voting 
on today looks nothing like the Repub-
lican bill, which isn’t the case. There 
are a lot of similarities between the 
bill that we put on the floor in Sep-
tember and again in October—about 
$600 billion in targeted relief that ad-
dresses the most fundamental needs 
the American people need right now. 
One is an unemployment insurance ex-
tension for those who are unemployed. 
The very amount that is in the bill 
that we will vote on today was in the 
Republican bill that we brought to the 
floor in September and again in Octo-
ber and voted on here. 
The vaccine money—the money that 
is out there to help with the vaccines 
that are going to be so effective in try-
ing to get this pandemic under con-
trol—was also in the bill that was on 
the floor both in September and in Oc-
tober. 
The relief for small businesses that 
have been hit hard by this pandemic 
and have seen their balance sheets and 
their income statements get depleted 
by its economic impact also would 
have been funded with additional Pay-
check Protection Program relief in the 
bill that we brought before the Senate 
both in September and again in Octo-
ber. That very assistance is included in 
the legislation that we will vote on 
today. 
Money for schools, as I mentioned 
earlier, to help them reopen safely— 
something that was in the legislation 
that we voted on in September, again 
in October—is in the legislation that 
we will vote on today. 
The only things that are different, 
really—substantially 
different—from 
what we brought up on the floor back 
then are the assistance checks that are 
included in this legislation. That is 
something that was a priority. It was a 
priority for Members on the Repub-
lican side; it was a priority for Mem-
bers on the Democratic side; it was a 
priority for the White House, so it 
ended up being included in this and, 
hopefully, will provide some much 
needed relief to people across this 
country who have been struggling with 
their personal finances and their fam-
ily finances through the pandemic. 
So those are all things that we have 
discussed and debated previously, and I 
would point out that, contrary to the 
assertions made by the Democratic 
leader just now, there were numerous 
attempts to try and move this legisla-
tion previously. 
Now, it is fair to say that the House 
of Representatives did send the Senate 
a $3.4 trillion package, which was 
bloated and included lots of nonpan-
demic, 
noncoronavirus 
relief-related 
items—things that were on their lib-
eral wish list. That wasn’t realistic, 
and they knew it. That was a campaign 
document designed to try and help 
them, at the time, win an election. 
But I am glad they have decided to 
get down and negotiate in a serious 
way because the number that we are 
going to be passing today—a little 
under $1 trillion, about $900 billion—is 
very close to what Republicans put on 
the floor in September and again in Oc-
tober. 
It is a far cry from the $3.4 trillion 
bloated bill that the Democrats sent 
over from the House and the Demo-
crats here in the Senate tried to ad-
vance and suggested that that should 
be what the Senate should vote on. 
We have said all along that we need 
to address this in a targeted way, a fis-
cally responsible way, a way that rec-
ognizes the most critical needs out 
there, both on the healthcare front and 
also on the economic front, and we 
have moved aggressively to address 
those needs not once, but twice. 
Legislation, a real bill brought to the 
floor, which received a majority vote 
in the U.S. Senate—52 U.S. Senators in 
September and again in October voted 
here on the floor of the U.S. Senate to 
do the very things that I just men-
tioned—but it was blocked from even 
being considered by the Senate Demo-
crats. 
We all know here in the Senate it re-
quires 60 votes to invoke cloture. It is 
a procedural motion to get on a bill. 
The Senate Democrats gave us no sup-
port to even get on the bill. 
So, as a consequence, even though 
there was majority support—52 U.S. 
Senators voting in favor of getting on 
and debating the bill—because the 
Democrats blocked it, we didn’t even 
have an opportunity to debate—not 
even to get on it, let alone offer amend-
ments and have a discussion and a con-
versation and work on legislation. If 
they had objections to it or things they 
wanted to improve or things they 
wanted to make better, they would 
have had an opportunity to do that if 
we had simply been able to get on the 
bill. 
So we are where we are today at this 
late hour in the year—December 21, 
Christmas week—doing this now be-
cause they didn’t want to do it earlier, 
and some have publicly acknowledged 
that one of the reasons they didn’t 
want to do it earlier is that there was 
a campaign underway, and they had 
hoped that there would be a new Presi-
dent, an opportunity to do it their way 
later. 
But, nevertheless, we have before us 
now, finally, at long last, a piece of leg-
islation that addresses the most crit-
ical needs that are out there, and it is 
very similar in many ways, in terms of 
the substance, the content, and the fea-
tures of the bill and the overall 
pricetag, to what Republicans have 
brought on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
previously. 
So I am glad that we are finally 
going to get this done, but I absolutely 
disagree with the statements that were 
made earlier by the Democratic leader, 
because they don’t reflect reality. In 
fact, they don’t reflect anything close 
to reality about what has been hap-
pening here in this Chamber over the 
past several months when it comes to 
trying to provide much needed relief to 
the American people who are suffering 
from this pandemic. 
There are a couple of things that I 
would just mention briefly that aren’t 
included in the bill, and I wish they 
were. 
I have a bill called the Remote and 
Mobile Worker Relief Act, and I am 
sorry that was not included in the final 
bill. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation 
would 
have prevented unexpected tax bills 
and tax complications for medical pro-
fessionals who traveled to other States

to help during the pandemic and for 
Americans who worked from home to 
help slow the virus’s spread. 
It is unfortunate that opposition 
from a handful of States with aggres-
sive taxation policies—like the Senate 
Democratic leader’s home State of New 
York—has so far prevented legislation 
like mine from getting through Con-
gress. But I will continue to fight for 
tax relief for remote and mobile work-
ers. 
It has been a difficult year for our 
country. There are way too many virus 
infections, way too many hospitaliza-
tions, way too many people who have 
lost loved ones from this dreaded virus. 
It has affected people in so many 
ways—their health, their confidence, 
their economic standing and status, 
their mental health. There are just so 
many—so many—effects of this, and 
this winter is likely to be very chal-
lenging. 
But the encouraging news is that 
there is light at the end of the tunnel. 
There is a vaccine out there that will 
get more widely out there, and thanks 
to the resources that we put into the 
first coronavirus bill—the CARES Act 
that passed last March—those vaccines 
have been moving forward at record 
speed—five times faster than any vac-
cine in history. 
Light is at the end of the tunnel. The 
vaccines are coming. They are going to 
be proven to be very effective, and 
there is additional funding in this par-
ticular legislation that we will vote on 
today to make sure that it gets distrib-
uted as quickly as possible. 
We are going to make it through 
this, and I look forward to sending the 
additional relief that is included in 
this legislation that we will move 
through the Senate today and put on 
the President’s desk, where he can sign 
it into law. I look forward to seeing 
that additional relief get out to the 
American people. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING JASON SHUPING 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of 
Concord, NC, Police Officer Jason 
Shuping, who was tragically killed in 
the line of duty this week. 
Officer Shuping was only 25 years old 
and had served the Concord Police De-
partment for 11⁄2 years with honor and 
distinction. 
Officer Shuping and Officer Kaleb 
Robinson were responding to a 9–1–1 
call for a car crash and an attempted 
carjacking. Officers Shuping and Rob-
inson located the suspect and were pre-
pared to bring him to justice. However, 
when Officer Shuping, Officer Robin-
son, and a third ALE officer ap-
proached, 
the 
suspect 
immediately 
began opening fire. 
Officers Shuping and Robinson were 
both shot. Additional officers arrived 
on the scene and took out the suspect. 
While Officer Robinson is, fortu-
nately, expected to make a recovery, 
Officer 
Shuping, 
tragically, 
passed 
away from his injuries. 
Jason Shuping was an outstanding 
police officer who courageously ran to 
danger to protect residents of Concord. 
He was also a loving son and a hus-
band to his wife Haylee. He was active 
in his community since his childhood. 
He attended East Rowan High School 
in Salisbury, and he was an honor stu-
dent and track and field athlete at 
UNC-Pembroke. 
He was a young man with a bright fu-
ture ahead of him, described by those 
who knew him as a ‘‘gentle soul who 
made an impact.’’ 
His hometown paper, the Salisbury 
Post, noted: ‘‘Whether it was staying 
after practice to provide coaching to a 
youngster or coming back home from 
college to play the handbell in his 
church’s ensemble, you could always 
count on Jason Shuping.’’ 
It is no surprise to see the outpouring 
of love coming from the community of 
Concord to honor his life and service. 
There have been a candlelight vigil and 
a touching law enforcement escort that 
brought many residents and a long line 
of American flags proudly displayed. 
As we gather with our families this 
Christmas, my thoughts and prayers 
will be with the family of Officer 
Shuping, as well as the families of 
Mount Holly Police Officer Tyler Hern-
don and Nash County Deputy Sheriff 
Jared Allison, who also lost their lives 
this month in the line of duty. 
Those families are going through an 
unimaginable period of grief, but they 
should know that the people of North 
Carolina are forever grateful for the 
selfless service of their loved ones, and 
I will never forget the ultimate sac-
rifice that they made in answering the 
call to protect others. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.

CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to thank all of my col-
leagues who worked so hard on the bill 
that is coming to the floor today, the 
pandemic relief package. 
We know all the top priorities in 
there—the vaccine distribution—and I 
want to thank Senator SCHUMER and 
leaders and those on both sides of the 
aisle who put more funding into that. 
I want to thank the group who has 
worked so hard on this agreement and 
this negotiation in the Senate for their 
work, including Senator MANCHIN and 
Senator ROMNEY and Senator WARNER 
and Senator SHAHEEN and Senator HAS-
SAN and Senator DURBIN, as well as all 
of their Republican colleagues, Senator 
COLLINS and Senator MURKOWSKI, Sen-
ator CASSIDY, who worked so hard on 
this original agreement, with many 
others who joined in as well. 
This bill contains such important 
priorities, 
including 
unemployment 
and help for our hospitals and help for 
our rural areas—housing, rent, small 
businesses, unemployment, the direct 
checks. 
I think we all know that there is 
more work to be done, including next 
year, including for our cities and our 
States, but it is so important that we 
get this done by the end of the year. 
I wanted to focus on something that 
I have worked on for quite a while with 
Senator CORNYN from Texas. We have 
done this on a bipartisan basis from 
the beginning, and it is the Save Our 
Stages Act. 
When we first introduced it in July, 
we knew that it was going to be a long 
road, and we also knew that the only 
way we would get this done is by stick-
ing together as a team and by working 
with other Members of Congress from 
red and blue States. And by the end— 
this bill is included in full in this pack-
age—we had 57 Senators who sponsored 
this bill out of 100, with many more 
supporting it. We had over 200 House 
Members. 
We worked so hard to make this 
about America and American music 
and American theater and American 
culture. 
We all know that you can’t go stand 
in a mosh pit in the middle of a pan-
demic. 
These 
live 
entertainment 
venues were among the first businesses 
to close, and they will almost certainly 
be among the last to reopen. 
This was about, yes, Nashville and 
New York, but it was just as much 
about the Fargo Theater or a small, 
small country music venue in Texas. 
And while we see the light at the end of 
tunnel with the vaccines, we know that 
it will be quite a while before these 
businesses, which operate on such thin 
margins as it is, can keep going. 
I think we also know the importance 
of the arts and music, not only as a 
cultural icon in America but also as an 
economic driver. It is one of our No. 1 
exports, when you combine all of it. 
And the fact that we were able to stick 
together with not only the nitty-gritty 
of this bill and this coalition and actu-
ally add partners as we went along is a 
tribute to all the musicians out there, 
all the venues, all the lighting opera-
tors, all the truckers—everyone who 
came together and said: We are going 
to get this done. 
I know when Senator CORNYN and I 
first introduced this, people kind of 
patted us on the head and said: Oh, this 
sounds nice. But I think when people 
started to hear the facts and how much 
this matters to economies and even 
small towns, it made a difference. In 
the end, to quote Minnesota’s own Bob 
Dylan from ‘‘The Times They Are a- 
Changin,’’ he says: 
Come senators, congressmen 
Please heed the call 
Don’t stand in the doorway 
Don’t block the hall 
No one blocked the hall. 
I want to thank my colleagues, and I 
want to especially thank Senator COR-
NYN. We have led many bills together, 
and we had to go back and forth a lot.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7894 
December 21, 2020 
I want to thank Dayna Frank, who is 
the head of First Avenue in Minnesota, 
made famous, of course, by Prince. 
Prince wouldn’t be Prince if not for 
First Avenue. Everyone in our State, 
when they think about First Avenue, 
they think about Prince. 
She is the head of the National 
Venue Association. She called me one 
night in the beginning of the pandemic 
and said: I just can’t make it through 
this without some help. 
They already received PPP loans, but 
that is not enough for these venues be-
cause 
of 
the 
unique 
circumstance 
where they can’t partially open. You 
can’t go to a theater right now and sit 
elbow-to-elbow with your friends and 
family. 
I also want to thank my legislative 
director, Doug Calidas, who has worked 
on this from the beginning, including 
all the last month’s late-night negotia-
tions. He did a wonderful job. 
I want to thank Senators SCHUMER 
and MCCONNELL
and Representatives 
Speaker PELOSI and Leader MCCARTHY 
for getting this over the finish line— 
Senator MCCONNELL for putting it in 
his original bill and Senator SCHUMER, 
who cares so much about this because 
of all of the great music and acts and 
everything coming out of New York 
State. It was certainly very, very help-
ful—and that would put it mildly—to 
have Senator SCHUMER
in the room 
where it happened, where the last nego-
tiations were made. 
I also want to thank Senators SHA-
HEEN and COLLINS, who worked on this 
in the original negotiation; Senators 
CARDIN and RUBIO with the Small Busi-
ness Committee, who made this a pri-
ority; and finally, our House authors, 
our bipartisan House authors out there, 
Representatives WELCH and WILLIAMS, 
for their work. 
So how this works—the Small Busi-
ness Administration will create a new 
$15 billion grant program to help 
venues cover 6 months of expenses and 
make it through this pandemic. We are 
very hopeful that once the summer 
comes, we are going to see more and 
more openings because of the vaccine, 
because of what I hope will be, with a 
new administration, an increased em-
phasis on testing, and that we will see 
more and more venues able to open. 
The grants can be used to cover all 
the major costs the venues have to pay 
to stay in business, including rent and 
mortgage, utilities, employee wages, 
key benefits, maintenance costs, State 
and local taxes, payments to contrac-
tors, and purchases of protective equip-
ment. 
Venues that are at the greatest risk 
of closing—sadly, we have already lost 
a number of our venues—will have pri-
ority access to the majority of the 
grant funding. All venues will be able 
to apply within 4 weeks of the pro-
gram’s launch with the Small Business 
Administration, but in the first 2 
weeks, those venues that have suffered 
90 percent revenue loss over the year 
before will be the first to be able to 
apply for these grants. 
So we in Congress don’t want to let 
the music die, and we don’t want that 
to happen to any of our other places of 
culture in America either. That is why 
over the last month or so, we have 
worked with the museums and with the 
zoos, and I want to especially thank 
Senator SCHUMER for his work on that, 
as well as Senator BLUNT and many 
others who worked with us—as well as 
the movie theaters. 
We wanted to make sure that if we 
expanded our coalition, that we didn’t 
hurt the originals, which were these 
small, small theaters and small music 
venues across the country. We did not 
do that, because this new program will 
be a lifeline for small entertainment 
venues across the country, such as 
First Avenue and the Bluestem Amphi-
theater in Moorehead, MN. 
It will also help the millions of 
Americans who work behind the scenes 
and who have been sidelined, from the 
engineers and truckdrivers to the tick-
et takers and the designers and the 
spot operators. It will help revive the 
local economies of neighborhoods and 
small towns across this Nation. 
It is not every day that a coalition 
sticks together from beginning to end, 
that they kept with their original pur-
pose, haven’t been picked off, haven’t 
gotten into infighting, but this group 
did it. Maybe it is because so many 
Americans at home right now cherish 
music and entertainment and that part 
of America like they have never done 
because 
they 
are 
watching 
things 
alone. They are listening to concerts 
by themselves. They are listening to 
them with their iPhones, or they are 
listening to them on their computers, 
and it is not quite the same. 
We also know that all of these artists 
don’t exactly get a big boost up by 
themselves with huge funding when 
they first start out. So many of them 
start out at these little venues—a 
country music band playing at the 
Bluestem Amphitheater; a little local 
theater troupe trying out a new play in 
Lanesboro, MN. They can’t do it with-
out these venues. 
So today we celebrate the fact that 
we held together. Not only are we pass-
ing this bill as a part of this package, 
we actually brought in friends, and we 
brought in partners, and we made it an 
even bigger deal than it was to begin 
with. 
So as I began by quoting the great 
Bob Dylan from Minnesota, I will end. 
He once said: 
Well, I sing by night, wander by day. 
I’m on the road and it looks like I’m here 
to stay. 
Finally, we are reaching out to this 
group of employees and these busi-
nesses and saying: We want you to be 
here to stay. 
So thank you to Save Our Stages and 
to all of our colleagues who worked so 
hard on this, and special thanks to my 
friend Senator CORNYN. Again, when we 
did this, we didn’t know if we would be 
able to mount this grassroots effort, 
but it happened because artists and 
fans just wouldn’t give up. So thank 
you very much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank, first of all, the preceding 
speaker, Senator KLOBUCHAR, for her 
efforts to help those venues in those 
entertainment areas that at this point 
have been left out. We certainly have 
some of those in West Virginia, and I 
am pleased to say that the coronavirus 
package we are putting together today 
will help those folks and hopefully get 
them over the hump. 
Before I begin, I would like to wish 
everybody, as much as they can, a 
happy holiday and a joyful new year. 
Turning the page of 2020 is something I 
think we are all pretty anxious to do. 
Sometimes it seems like the longest 
year, and sometimes it seems like the 
shortest year, but it definitely seems 
like ‘‘Groundhog Day’’ a lot of the 
year. 
I am very pleased that we have this 
relief package in front of us. While I 
am 
glad 
an 
agreement 
has 
been 
reached, we certainly should have done 
this earlier and could have done this 
earlier. We have been working since 
July to deliver targeted additional re-
lief through efforts such as we put for-
ward in the CARES Act, and it has 
been voted down twice—once in Sep-
tember and once in October. 
To date, we, the Republicans, have 
offered 
targeted 
relief 
legislation, 
voted in favor of enhanced employment 
benefits, more money for our schools, 
which would have been great to have 
had in early September and should 
have had in early September. We voted 
in favor of stand-alone emergency 
funding for the Paycheck Protection 
Program, which we know is exceed-
ingly important, and more dollars for 
vaccines and testing so that we could 
get the great news of the vaccine that 
we see coming forward out to every-
body in this country. We offered all 
kinds of ideas to the other side, but 
they blocked it—all of it. I am glad to 
say that after all this, we have finally 
joined together, realizing that, yes, a 
deal is better than no deal. 
Last week, unfortunately, a very 
good friend of mine passed away after 
battling coronavirus. At one point in 
her life, she was a small business 
owner. I thought so much about her 
over the last several weeks. I thought, 
what would she say if she knew that 
months ago, as a small business owner, 
we could have delivered the same help 
to her that we are delivering today. 
We have to do better by the people 
we represent. It is disappointing that 
politics has gotten in the way. It is dis-
appointing and, quite frankly, insult-
ing, in my view, when I see the Speaker 
of the House admitting to holding out 
on this relief because she thought it 
would be beneficial politically in the 
end. We can do much better than this. 
I am also a proud member of the Ap-
propriations 
Committee. 
We

December 21, 2020 
worked hard to get these funds and re-
sources where they are most needed, 
especially in a year like this one. But 
due to delays, critically needed re-
sources to combat the opioid epidemic 
have had to wait; investments to im-
prove broadband have had to wait; re-
search dollars into Alzheimer’s have 
had to wait; and the list goes on. This 
is so frustrating to me, as it should be 
to every American, and I know they 
are frustrated because they tell us they 
are. 
But here now, we were able to in-
clude funds for things that are impor-
tant to me in my State of West Vir-
ginia, such as fossil energy research, 
our universities, and the many Federal 
facilities that call West Virginia home. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this important legislation that reflects 
our Nation’s priorities and funds the 
government, which is our responsi-
bility as Members of Congress. 
Within the Omnibus appropriations 
act is the fiscal year 2021 Homeland Se-
curity appropriations bill. I chair that 
subcommittee, and it is with great 
pride that I can report to the American 
people and to West Virginians that this 
title invests billions of dollars to pro-
tect our homeland. 
We maintain our commitment to bor-
der security through a border wall sys-
tem to include physical barriers and 
enhanced technologies. 
We avoided a drastic cut to our cyber 
security capabilities that we see we 
need now more than ever after all of 
the reports and the vicious cyber at-
tack that we uncovered that has been 
launched against many of those in our 
country, not just the government but 
the private sector as well. 
We continue our commitment to use 
every resource at our disposal in the ef-
fort to prevent those opioids that are 
killing our people. We see overdoses 
going up and deaths from overdoses 
going up during this pandemic. We 
tried to get the resources to our Home-
land Security folks to prevent those 
drugs from entering into this country 
at all. 
The men and women at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security work con-
stantly against threats both old and 
new, traditional and emerging, and de-
serve the support this legislation gives 
them. 
So while this is great news in the 
end, I will repeat what I said earlier, 
and that is, Congress can do better. We 
could have done this earlier, and it 
should have been done earlier. So there 
is no reason we should be standing here 
several days before Christmas dis-
cussing the items that were ready to go 
several months ago, but we are where 
we are. As we turn the page gleefully 
into 2021, I think we should all pledge 
to one another and to the country that 
we will do better, that we will work 
better with each other and prevent pol-
itics from infecting every decision that 
could positively impact so many people 
in this country. 
Lastly, I give a hat tip to my friend, 
whom I will miss seeing and who was a 
great friend to our family, a longtime 
friend of our family. Godspeed. I know 
she is dancing up there with her mom 
and dad because they loved to dance. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Repub-
licans like to mock modern monetary 
theory—the idea that government can 
print money with impunity and that 
government can spend whatever it 
wants without the need to tax. Modern 
monetary theory is basically the Dick 
Cheney ‘‘deficits don’t matter’’ crowd, 
trussed up with a new fancy title. 
Most Republicans rightly lampoon 
this quackery; that is, when they are 
not practicing the quackery them-
selves. Today, many of these same Re-
publicans will vote for a bill that 
makes modern monetary theory look 
like child’s play in comparison. The 
monster spending bill presented today 
is not just a ‘‘deficits don’t matter’’ 
disaster, it is everything Republicans 
say they don’t believe in. 
This bill is free money for everyone. 
Proponents don’t care if you are fully 
employed or own your own house or 
own your own business. ‘‘Free money 
for everyone,’’ they cry. And yet, if 
free money were the answer and if 
money really grew on trees, why not 
give more free money? Why not give it 
out all the time? Why stop at $600 a 
person? Why not $1,000? Why not $2,000? 
Maybe these new free-money Repub-
licans should join the ‘‘everybody gets 
a guaranteed income’’ caucus. Why not 
$20,000 a year for everybody? Why not 
$30,000? If we can print up money with 
impunity, why not do it? 
The Treasury could just keep print-
ing the money; that is, until someone 
points out that the Emperor has no 
clothes and that the dollar no longer 
has value. To so-called conservatives 
who are quick to identify the socialism 
of Democrats, if you vote for this 
spending monstrosity, you are no bet-
ter. When you vote to pass out free 
money, you lose your soul, and you 
abandon forever any semblance of 
moral or fiscal integrity. 
So the next time you see Republicans 
in high moral dudgeon, claiming and 
complaining about spending of Demo-
crats and socialism, remind them—re-
mind them if they supported this mon-
strous bill, that really the difference 
between the parties is less Adam Smith 
versus Marx and more Marx versus 
Engels. 
How bad is our fiscal situation? Well, 
the Federal Government brought in 
$3.3 trillion last year and spent $6.6 
trillion. The deficit last year, a record- 
busting $3.3 trillion. If you are looking 
for more COVID bailout money, we 
don’t have any. The coffers are bare. 
We have no rainy day fund. We have no 
savings account. Congress has spent all 
the money long ago. 
The economic damage from this pan-
demic is not the reason for this run-
away spending. This spending has been 
going on for decades. Every year, even 
before we get to all the extra COVID- 
free money, we have been spending $1 
trillion we don’t have. 
Today’s money is gone, so Congress 
is spending tomorrow’s money. The 
spending chart is a red line of red ink 
that goes on forever. When we talk 
about spending tomorrow’s money, it is 
not just the money that we need next 
month. It is the money we might need 
in a decade. It is the money we will 
need in one, two, three generations 
from now—for national defense and for 
infrastructure. This is the money that 
your children and your grandchildren 
will pay back with interest. 
The deficit doubling and tripling— 
under George Bush, it went from $5 
trillion to $10 trillion. Under President 
Obama, it went from $10 trillion to $20 
trillion. We are now at $27 trillion, but 
we are adding it at $1 trillion a year be-
fore we get to this COVID budget-bust-
ing bailout. 
Every tax-paying American already 
owes over $136,000, and they are staring 
at projections into the future that 
show no end. We are $27 trillion in debt 
today. How do we expect a child to 
have the economic opportunity when 
this crushing debt is their inheritance 
from Congress? The numbers are mind- 
boggling. It is hard to conceive of what 
$1 billion is, much less $1 trillion. 
How big is $1 billion? Well, a billion 
seconds ago was 1988 and Reagan was 
President. A billion minutes ago, Jesus 
walked the shore of the Sea of Galilee. 
A billion hours ago, man still lived in 
caves. But $1 billion ago, was just 80 
minutes ago—$1 billion ago, at the rate 
Congress spends money, was just 80 
minutes ago. 
All of this should be setting off alarm 
bells. But the only alarm bells in Con-
gress are sounding the alarm for more 
spending and more debt. No cuts, no 
offsets, 
no 
pay-fors, 
and 
no 
prioritization. Just print it up. Print 
up more money and give it out to ev-
erybody because it is free money. Come 
and get yours while the getting is good. 
But it leads to a mountain of debt. 
Spend all this money and leave the fu-
ture to figure itself out. 
John 
Maynard 
Keynes 
was 
once 
asked: What about the long run? 
He said: In the short run, you can 
make a stimulus. You can print money, 
and you can give it to everybody. 
And Maynard Keynes, his response 
was: In the long run, we will all be 
dead; no concern for the future, only 
for the immediate. 
Our budget deficit for 2020 was $3.3 
trillion, but this new spending package 
will also give us another $2 trillion in 
the next fiscal year. By refusing to ac-
knowledge the debt crisis, we are only 
hastening the day of economic reck-
oning. 
Total debt was 55 percent of GDP just 
20 years ago. Today, it is 128 percent of 
GDP. So our annual or our total debt is 
more than our GDP—128 percent of our 
GDP. The World Bank estimates there

is a tipping point of debt to GDP at 
about 77 percent. Every percentage 
point costs another 10th or so of eco-
nomic growth. So every year, we are 
giving out somewhere between 5 to 8 
percent of growth every year because 
of this burden of debt. This is thou-
sands of jobs, every year—tens of thou-
sands of jobs that we lose because of 
this burden of debt. 
We are borrowing and worsening this 
debt crisis in part because too many 
Governors and mayors have imposed 
heavyhanded restrictions that crush 
business. It isn’t the pandemic that is 
killing the economy; it is the govern-
ment’s overzealous response that is 
killing the economy. The pandemic 
itself was disruptive, but Congress is 
being asked to help to perpetuate these 
lockdowns. The more money we give to 
the States, the more they keep us in 
lockdown. 
Every bailout dollar printed and 
passed out to the Governors only al-
lows these tin-pot dictators to perpet-
uate the lockdowns. Their rules are ar-
bitrary and unscientific. Governors and 
mayors across the country are picking 
winners and losers. 
Businesses, some that have been in 
families for generations, are being 
wiped out because they are not allowed 
to open. Restaurants have to close 
their doors for indoor dining, but then 
they are told they can open at limited 
capacity, but then they are told they 
have to close again. Then they are told 
they can open outside, and then they 
are told they can’t open outside. Con-
fusing doesn’t even explain the half of 
it. 
Bars are told they can only serve al-
cohol if people are sitting and not 
standing and only if they have heavy 
foods on their menus. 
Restaurants are told they can serve 
outdoors, and then they have their per-
mission revoked after they have sunk 
time and money converting their res-
taurant to outdoor services, but a ca-
terer is told they can still serve out-
side. 
Businesses are told they have to 
close at an arbitrary time determined 
by government officials, as though the 
virus only comes out late at night. A 
business in one ZIP Code can open, but 
one in an adjoining ZIP Code across the 
street has to close, as if the virus can’t 
cross an imaginary line. 
Airlines are allowed to fly, but hotels 
have to limit their occupancy, so you 
may not have anywhere to stay when 
you get there. 
Mom-and-pop stores and specialty 
stores are forced to close, but big-box 
store competitors are allowed to stay 
open. 
How is any business expected to sur-
vive with this kind of arbitrary regula-
tion that changes from day to day? 
Meanwhile, 
many 
schools 
remain 
closed—despite overwhelming evidence 
showing kids can learn safely in per-
son—which means parents can’t go to 
work, which forces parents to leave 
their jobs and take care of homebound 
kids. Now they have no income because 
the government forced them to leave 
their jobs to take care of their kids. 
And many kids are struggling with this 
improvised virtual school. 
The need for help is real. I hear it 
every day from Kentuckians and across 
the country. But it is clear that gov-
ernment has worsened the economic 
damage and acted as the biggest obsta-
cle to economic recovery. 
There is no free money that can get 
us out of this situation. The only thing 
that can save us is to open the econ-
omy. If we give these tin-pot dic-
tators—these Governors—more money, 
they are less likely to open the econ-
omy. 
The answer is not printing up and 
distributing ‘‘free money’’; it is open-
ing the economy. We are not even de-
bating the real answer to this. We are 
like, just print up the money and shov-
el it out the door, the deficit be 
damned, the threat of the destruction 
of our currency be damned. 
We can choose to let our economies 
open with guidance and precautions 
but not obstruction. Let people rebuild 
their livelihoods. Reopen our schools so 
our kids can return and parents can go 
back to work. 
Congress should do away with auto-
matic spending increases and scruti-
nize where in the budget we can find 
savings to pay for the pressing needs 
arising from the pandemic, but we 
shouldn’t simply print up money and 
pass it out to everyone. Or Congress 
can follow the status quo. Congress can 
continue to borrow from our kids—the 
same children we have locked out of 
our schools. Congress can keep ena-
bling and shutting down businesses by 
force, spend all of today’s money and 
all of tomorrow’s money, and then 
good luck. Good luck figuring out how 
to pay for all of this massive debt. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. There 
is another alternative that won’t be de-
bated, and that alternative is to open 
the economy. It is not too late to 
change our course. Cut unnecessary 
spending. Eliminate waste. Stop fight-
ing a $50-billion-a-year war in Afghani-
stan that hasn’t had a military mission 
in at least a decade. 
Make the hard decisions now. We 
can’t keep pretending that more debt is 
a sustainable policy course. ‘‘Leader-
ship’’ is not passing on the problem to 
someone who can’t protest; ‘‘leader-
ship’’ is making the hard choices now. 
This is what we have to do. 
I will oppose this new debt, and I will 
continue to sound the alarm until we 
change our course. Our country can be 
saved. We can survive this if we pull to-
gether. But adding more debt is a mis-
take. It is not the solution, and we 
should resist it. 
Thank you. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was 
going to speak in a few minutes, but 
things have been filed now appro-
priately. 
Let me speak in my role not only as 
the Senator from Vermont but as the 
vice chairman of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee. We have had months 
of delay and painstaking negotiations. 
Sometimes those negotiations have 
gone all weekend long, until midnight, 
1 or 2 o’clock in the morning. But this 
afternoon, we will have before us a 
spending package. It includes all 12 ap-
propriations bills for fiscal year 2021. It 
also 
includes 
a 
vitally 
important 
COVID relief package. Those are the 
numbers and figures, but let’s talk 
about what it means. 
It provides funding for programs that 
are critically important to the Amer-
ican people, and I would like to see it 
swiftly passed and on the President’s 
desk. After all, it is not like we are 
suddenly rushing things. We are 2 
months and 20 days into the fiscal 
year. It would be absolutely outrageous 
if we delayed it further. 
As vice chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee, I worked hard to 
reach agreement on this Omnibus ap-
propriations bill that will fund the 
Federal government through the re-
mainder of the fiscal year, without re-
lying on a long-term continuing resolu-
tion, as sometimes has been done in 
the past. That was not an easy task. 
The budget caps are very lean this 
year, and we had to stay within those. 
They provided a less than 1-percent in-
crease 
in 
nondefense 
discretionary 
spending, and that is to meet the needs 
of a nation that is reeling from the 
worst public health pandemic in a cen-
tury. 
Under normal circumstances, that 
would be difficult, but it is made even 
more difficult because of the global 
health and economic crisis we face. 
Notwithstanding the tight top line, we 
have produced a bill that provides im-
portant increases in programs that 
serve the American people and invest 
in our economy. 
I think the bill finally drives a stake 
through the heart of the administra-
tion’s effort to substantially diminish 
the role of government in helping 
Americans in need and in promoting 
economic growth. 
We all know that President Trump’s 
first budget proposed to substantially 
diminish the role of government. He 
wanted to cut nondefense spending by 9 
percent in fiscal 2018 and 18 percent by 
2021. He wanted to completely elimi-
nate programs millions of Americans 
rely on every day. For 4 years, in Con-
gress, leading Republicans and Demo-
crats came together and we rejected 
these 
ill-conceived, 
arbitrary, 
and 
reckless cuts. 
This year, I will say to my col-
leagues—those who have worked hard 
with us on the Democratic side and on 
the Republican side and who came to-
gether on this, and, especially, those 
who worked with us in the Appropria-
tions Committee—we are going to do 
the same in rejecting these arbitrary 
cuts. 
Now, this agreement is the product of 
weeks of hard work and compromise.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7897 
December 21, 2020 
This is not the bill I would have writ-
ten on my own. It includes things I 
support and, I must admit, some things 
I oppose. But that is often the way leg-
islation is. No one Senator gets every-
thing that he or she wants. But to-
gether, we can get things that the 
country wants, and on balance, passage 
of this bill is unquestionably in the in-
terest of the American people. 
Let me talk about some of those 
things. The omnibus spending bill in-
cludes increases for education and 
early childhood programs. It provides 
more funding for substance abuse and 
mental health services. I think every 
one of us knows, from what we hear 
from back home, that these services 
are of utmost importance in these ex-
tremely difficult times. It provides 
more for food assistance programs both 
here and abroad—the assistance that is 
desperately needed as many families 
struggle to survive during this pan-
demic. And it includes increases for 
housing and homelessness services to 
help those who are the most vulner-
able. These are all programs that my 
fellow Democrats fought hard to in-
clude. 
I support this agreement. As I said, I 
appreciate those who have worked with 
us weekends, holidays, and after mid-
night on so many nights. But I am 
deeply disappointed that Congress is so 
unforgivably late in completing our 
work. There is absolutely no reason 
whatsoever why this bill could not 
have been finished months ago. 
I thank Chairman SHELBY, Chair-
woman LOWEY, and Ranking Member 
GRANGER
for their cooperation and 
partnership. We worked through our 
differences on the Omnibus spending 
bill. As the Big 4, we realized we had to 
balance the needs and requests of all of 
our Members. I urge all Members to 
support it. 
That is for the Omnibus. 
Now, before us today is a much de-
layed COVID relief package. It, too, is 
the product of bipartisan compromise, 
and while it falls short in some critical 
areas, I support the agreement. It is 
also long overdue. The American peo-
ple have been waiting for help for far 
too long, and I am worried our Repub-
lican leadership took a wait-and-see 
approach. We were ready to go on this 
last summer, but for 270 days Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Senate Re-
publicans have blocked every reason-
able effort to provide desperately need-
ed relief, even as Members of their 
party said quietly: We wish we could do 
something. 
Now, this package is far from perfect, 
but time is not on our side. We cannot 
let the perfect be the enemy of the 
good. Let’s look at what the good 
things are in here. It provides much 
needed investments in our economy 
with support for small businesses— 
small businesses like those in my State 
of Vermont or those in the State of the 
Presiding Officer or anybody else here. 
It provides relief for unemployed work-
ers by extending unemployment bene-
fits into March. It makes investments 
in vaccine production and distribution. 
It supports health providers, educators 
and farmers and transportation pro-
viders. It provides critical investments 
to expand broadband in rural and low- 
income areas, access which is vitally 
important during these difficult times, 
when many schools and many busi-
nesses are operating remotely. 
It includes another round of direct 
payments to millions of Americans 
who are still struggling to pay their 
mortgage or their rent and feed their 
families and heat their homes and meet 
their monthly obligations. Many can’t 
do all those things. Now they will at 
least get help. 
I urged that this bill also includes $4 
billion in emergency funding for the 
Gavi Alliance. Let me explain that. 
And I appreciate those Senators who 
supported me on that money, the emer-
gency funding for Gavi. This is for the 
procurement and delivery of vaccines 
to countries around the world whose 
rudimentary public health systems are 
being 
overwhelmed 
by 
COVID–19, 
whose economies are in free fall due to 
the virus. We cannot defeat this global 
pandemic, and international travel and 
Congress will not recover without 
fighting the virus overseas. 
Just as we did during the Obama ad-
ministration when we were faced with 
Ebola, the administration and the Con-
gress came together and said: Sure, we 
will protect here in the United States, 
but we will also work at getting rid of 
it in other countries because if it flour-
ishes in another country, it is an air-
plane trip away from our country. 
I support the package, but I want to 
be very clear. This COVID bill is only a 
first step. We have to do more. 
Vermonters and the American people 
need more. 
The direct payments included in this 
package are a fraction of what we 
should have provided, given the dire fi-
nancial situation of millions of people 
across this Nation. People are hungry. 
Unemployment continues to plague our 
economies. 
We 
should 
have 
acted 
months ago, but let’s at least act on 
this today. Families are struggling to 
pay their rent and put food on their 
table. 
I will continue to fight for more. I 
made hundreds of phone calls from my 
own State of Vermont. I talked to peo-
ple whom I never met, but I know that 
they are people who are typical of 
Vermonters, but they are typical of 
people in any one of the States we rep-
resent. I hear the fear in their voice. I 
hear the concern they have. In the mid-
dle of winter, as snow is coming down, 
do we heat or do we eat? How many 
meals should we, as parents, go with-
out so we can make sure our children 
are fed? How are children going to do 
school if they are hungry? 
Look at State and local govern-
ments. Around the country, they have 
laid off over 1.3 million teachers, first 
responders, and other employees since 
March. They need our help. Sometimes 
there are things that we don’t talk 
about. Rates of spousal abuse and child 
abuse have increased during the crisis. 
We should be providing funds for the 
Violence Against Women Act and child 
abuse prevention grants, just as Repub-
licans and Democrats joined me a few 
years ago when I greatly expanded— 
with the help of Senator MIKE CRAPO in 
a 
bipartisan 
fashion—the 
Violence 
Against Women Act and the things we 
did. None of us, even at that time, 
could have conceived of the crisis we 
are facing now in the country. 
In my State, Vermonters are facing 
the coldest, darkest months of winter. 
They are struggling to heat their 
homes. And families need help paying 
their utility bills through the LIHEAP 
program, and we will help that pro-
gram. When it is 20 degrees below zero 
and you have had 15 inches of snow 
overnight, you can’t really look at this 
as an abstract thing and say: Golly, 
maybe we should have a program to 
heat our home. You are going to die if 
you don’t. 
And we are finally making progress 
in delivering a vaccine to the American 
people, but the pandemic is far from 
over. We know that, notwithstanding a 
lot of the things said about this is on 
its way and everybody is going to get 
one, there are huge gaps in all parts of 
our country and getting the vaccine to 
them. 
I will be the first at the negotiating 
table to work with President Biden and 
the 117th Congress to address the many 
needs that remain unmet in this bill. 
The House will send this bill over to 
us. I would urge all Members to vote on 
it when it comes here. 
Again, I have to look back at the his-
tory of this body. I have to look at the 
people who have worked so hard on so 
many things over the years. I know 
that we have people in both parties 
who are trying to address the needs of 
our country. 
I don’t say this with pleasure but 
with sadness, I am the dean of the 
United States Senate. Next year, I will 
start my 47th year in this body. I have 
seen us come together at a time when 
it is needed, but then I see one of the 
greatest needs I have seen in my years 
in the Senate that we ignored for 
month after month after month. All of 
this could have been done in July or 
August or September or October or No-
vember, not at the very last minute. 
And why didn’t we? We had to take 
time. We had to take time breaking 
long tradition—all of the promises that 
have been given by the other side. We 
had to take time to move one special 
interest-supported judge after another 
to lifetime jobs, but they will be paid 
well. They don’t have to worry about 
paying their bills. 
In all 50 of our States, we had people 
being tossed out of their homes, tossed 
out of their apartments, lost their jobs, 
unable to feed their children, or the 
fear and anxiety a parent has in telling 
a child: No, I don’t know what tomor-
row will be like. I don’t know what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7898 
December 21, 2020 
next month will be like. We will pray, 
and we will hope, but I don’t know. 
We could have stopped that anxiety 
in June, when the House bill came over 
here, or in July or in August or Sep-
tember and October and November. We 
are doing some of it now. 
But I ask every Senator to search 
their conscience. Wouldn’t it have been 
better if all of us from both sides did 
something and said: Put everything 
else aside, put aside all the special in-
terest nominations. Put that aside, and 
let’s care for the one special interest 
we should have and that is the Amer-
ican people—care for those men and 
women who elected us from either 
party, who rely on us. 
I have never seen this country so 
split apart or having such fear except 
for a privileged few, and maybe that in-
cludes us. I am not here to represent 
me. I am here to represent over 600,000 
Vermonters and fulfill my oath to the 
whole country, 320 million Americans. 
What we should be doing is saying that 
never again will we let these kind of 
partisan politics slow us and not allow 
us to go forward. 
We know, and it is easy to say now, 
we should have taken the bill that 
came from the House of Representa-
tives last summer and brought it up on 
the floor. If anybody didn’t like it, file 
an amendment to change it. Vote for it 
or vote against it. Vote for or against 
the amendments you might bring up. 
That is what we usually do. I know how 
to vote. I voted over 16,000 times. Why 
don’t we just vote? If we had done that 
this summer, it may not be a perfect 
bill, but it would be better than where 
we are. Every Member—Republican and 
Democratic alike—would have had a 
chance to bring up their amendment. 
They could have made their case, ei-
ther win or lose. We go to the com-
mittee conference; we have the bill 
done. 
I say all this not to just be a tech-
nocrat of what needs to be done but to 
say this is how you reflect the needs of 
the American people. 
We faced the threat of Ebola in the 
last administration. We stood together, 
both parties. We helped the countries 
that were suffering from Ebola and, in 
doing so, we protected the United 
States of America, and we helped those 
in this country who might face it. That 
was a shining moment. That was a mo-
ment of America at its best. This is 
not. 
I do hope we can do better next year. 
I know as senior Democrat on the Ap-
propriations Committee, I will fight to 
do better. But I also use my voice and 
what example I might give as dean of 
the Senate to say to both parties: Here 
is what we do. 
I think of such examples as Bob Dole, 
one of the best leaders this Senate had, 
a Republican. He came together with 
Senator Pat Moynihan, one of the most 
brilliant Senators I served with, a 
Democrat. And that Republican and 
Democrat came together and set aside 
their philosophical differences, cared 
for the country, and saved Social Secu-
rity. 
I could give so many more examples. 
That was a Senate that acted as a con-
science of the Nation, and how did they 
do that? They appealed to our con-
science. I just use that one example be-
cause people said that they couldn’t 
possibly do the difficult things nec-
essary to save Social Security. Demo-
crats wouldn’t give this; Republicans 
wouldn’t give that. Instead, you had 
two Senators of conscience who said: 
We can do it. Let’s do it. Let’s use our 
leadership and our conscience to bring 
others 
together. 
And 
that 
distin-
guished the Republican Senator Robert 
Dole, and that distinguished the Demo-
cratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moy-
nihan and they came together and we 
saved Social Security. 
Those of us in the Senate in both par-
ties who voted for the final package 
knew we were going to have to vote for 
some things that would be unpopular 
with constituencies. But instead of 
worrying about special interests or sin-
gle-issue constituencies, we worried 
about the men and women of our 
States and what they would face if we 
didn’t come together. And that is what 
we voted for, and we saved it. 
I sometimes say that Senators are 
merely constitutional impediments to 
their staffs, but we could not do the 
work we do without the staff. 
I want to thank the staff who worked 
tirelessly to produce the bill. By ‘‘tire-
lessly,’’ I mean until after midnight 
many nights and weekends and holi-
days. When the rest the Senate had 
gone home, they were still working. I 
know them. Much of the time, I would 
be on the phone with them. I would be 
working with them and, finally, I 
would say: It is so late. Everybody 
should go to bed. When I woke up in 
the morning, there would be an email 
sent to me at 3 o’clock or 4 o’clock in 
the morning because they kept on 
working. 
So I thank Chuck Kieffer, Chanda 
Betourney, 
Jessica 
Berry, 
Dianne 
Nellor, Jean Taol Eisen, Erik Raven, 
Doug 
Clapp, 
Ellen 
Murray, 
Scott 
Nance, Rachael Taylor, Alex Keenan, 
Michelle 
Dominguez, 
Tim 
Rieser, 
Dabney Hegg, and all the staff of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee on 
both bills. I would thank Chairman 
SHELBY’s staff: Shannon Hines, Jona-
than Graffeo, and David Adkins. 
Normally, at this time, Senators 
might just put these names in the 
RECORD, but I wanted to say them out 
loud, on the floor, because they should

ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT 
AND 
THE 
PEOPLE 
OF 
THE 
UNITED STATES TO ‘‘BUY AMER-
ICAN’’ 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to encourage all Americans 
to join the fight to support our Nation 
and our jobs and stand up against the 
growing threat of Communist China. 
I have been saying it for months: 
Buying American products is the No. 1 
thing we can do to support American 
jobs and stand up to our foreign adver-
saries. 
There is a new Cold War occurring 
between the United States and Com-
munist China, and we must be crystal 
clear about the negative impacts of 
continuing to buy Chinese-made prod-
ucts. 
General Secretary Xi is a dictator 
and human rights violator. He is yet 
another Communist leader trying to be 
the dominant world power. 
The Communist Party of China is 
stripping the people of Hong Kong of 
their freedoms—as the Presiding Offi-
cer experienced when he was over 
there—cracking down on dissidents, 
militarizing the South China Sea, sup-
porting Maduro’s genocide in Ven-
ezuela, surveilling its citizens, and im-
prisoning more than 1 million Uighurs 
in internment camps simply because of 
their religion. 
Communist China is stealing Amer-
ican jobs and technology and spying on 
our citizens. 
Is this the kind of nation we want to 
be sending our money to? 
Absolutely not. 
Washington politicians have been too 
concerned with short-term political 
success and have long ignored the long- 
term threats of Communist China to 
our way of life but not anymore. It is 
time to take action. 
Now, more than ever, Americans 
must remember that every time we buy 
a product made in China, we are put-
ting another dollar into the pocket of 
the people stealing our jobs and our 
technology, denying their people basic 
human rights and propping up dan-
gerous dictators like Maduro in Ven-
ezuela. 
We cannot continue to rely on coun-
tries like Communist China, which lied 
about the coronavirus and refused to be 
a partner in solving this crisis, for crit-
ical supplies. 
This outbreak has shown why we 
need to end our reliance on foreign sup-
ply chains. As a nation, we need to fi-
nally take a stand and demand that 
Communist China is removed from our 
supply chain. 
I am proud to lead my colleagues in 
a 
bipartisan 
resolution 
calling 
on 
Americans to buy products made in the 
United States whenever possible. 
Buying American is not partisan, and 
I am glad my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle are continuing to

come together to encourage Americans 
to take a stand. 
I know it is not always easy, but it is 
an important step we can all take at 
home to support American jobs, Amer-
ican producers, and American manufac-
turers, while helping build up the U.S. 
supply chain. 
In my State, we take immense pride 
in products made in Florida. It is a 
driving force that led to our incredible 
economic turnaround. 
A return to this pride in homegrown 
businesses and products ensures that 
America remains strong as the undis-
puted leader of the global economy. 
We all must do our part to support 
our Nation and make it clear to Com-
munist China that the United States 
won’t stand for their behavior. 
I am committed to supporting Amer-
ican businesses over Chinese products. 
I am urging my colleagues to join me 
in this effort and pass this resolution 
today. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation be dis-
charged from further consideration and 
the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 625. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 625) encouraging the 
Government and the people of the United 
States to ‘‘Buy American’’. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Scott amendment at the desk to the 
resolution be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2726) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the resolving clause and in-
sert the following: ‘‘That— 
(1) it is the policy of the United States 
Government to ‘‘Buy American’’ products for 
public use when fiscally and reasonably pos-
sible, in accordance with the Buy American 
Act of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.); and 
(2) the Senate supports American manufac-
turing and strengthening our American man-
ufacturing base. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I know of no further debate on the res-
olution, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the question is, Shall 
the resolution, as amended, be agreed 
to? 
The resolution (S. Res. 625), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Scott amendment to the preamble be 
agreed to, the preamble, as amended, 
be agreed to, that the Scott amend-
ment to the title be agreed to, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2727) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on July 15, 2019, President Donald 
J. Trump signed Executive Order 13881 titled 
‘‘Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, 
Products, and Materials’’ (84 Fed. Reg. 34257), 
which would enforce the Buy American Act 
of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) to the greatest 
extent permitted by law; 
Whereas, the Buy American Act of 1933 re-
quires Federal agencies to procure materials 
and products domestically— 
(1) when the materials are intended for 
public use within the United States; and 
(2) when the materials to be procured (or 
the materials from which they are manufac-
tured) are present in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commer-
cial quantities of a satisfactory quality; 
Whereas American-made products are de-
veloped under United States’ regulations and 
undergo testing to ensure their compliance 
with United States’ safety standards, which 
are among the highest standards in the 
world; 
Whereas American-made products are pro-
duced by workers earning competitive wages 
and working in safe working conditions; 
Whereas purchasing American-made prod-
ucts supports the producers of those prod-
ucts and their communities; 
Whereas, according to the Manufacturing 
Institute, each dollar spent in sales of manu-
factured products supports $1.33 in output 
from other sectors of the economy; 
Whereas, according to the Manufacturers 
Alliance for Productivity and Innovation 
Foundation, for every full-time job in manu-
facturing, there are 3.4 full-time equivalent 
jobs created in non-manufacturing indus-
tries; 
Whereas, according to a 2017 poll conducted 
by Reuters and Ipsos, when buying products, 
nearly 70 percent of Americans find it impor-
tant that the products they buy were made 
in the United States; 
Whereas strengthening American manufac-
turing supports employment in the United 
States, produces innovation and the seeds for 
future industries, and supports the global 
competitiveness of the United States; 
Whereas a strong American manufacturing 
base is an important component in helping 
to revitalize the United States economy as it 
recovers from the global COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas a strong domestic supply chain 
for certain goods and close cooperation with 
trusted allies can support national security 
and public safety; 
Whereas the global COVID–19 pandemic 
presented significant challenges for the glob-
ally interconnected supply chain of medical 
products and has heightened the need for 
supply chain security of a variety of critical 
materials and products; and 
Whereas, regarding the manufacturing of 
critical medical supplies and products essen-
tial to national security, national stockpiles 
and a healthy domestic industrial base would 
help handle any future surge in need for 
these supplies: Now, therefore, be it 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2728) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the title) 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A resolu-
tion affirming the benefits of ‘Buying Amer-
ican’.’’. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7900 
December 21, 2020 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, here we 
are, the 21st of December, 4 days till 
Christmas, and Congress is finally get-
ting around to doing its duty on 
COVID–19 relief, as well as the Omni-
bus appropriations bill, which will keep 
the government open and keep the 
lights on through the end of the fiscal 
year next September. 
I have to editorialize here that I 
think this is a terrible process. It is a 
terrible process. I just saw one of the 
Texas delegation House Members say-
ing: I am expected to review thousands 
of pages of an appropriations bill and 
COVID–19 relief bill in the next couple 
of hours and then vote on it this 
evening? 
Well, we will be in the same posture. 
As terrible as this process is, it was in-
tentionally created. I am sure that the 
Appropriations 
chairman, 
RICHARD 
SHELBY, and Leader MCCONNELL would 
have loved to have had a regular appro-
priations process to vote out each of 
the subcommittee appropriations and 
pass them using regular order, giving 
the Members of the Congress a chance 
to offer amendments and maybe im-
prove the bill, but we weren’t provided 
that opportunity because, essentially, 
the Democratic leader and the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives under-
stand that this kind of broken process 
empowers them to the detriment of in-
dividual Members of the Congress and 
to the detriment of the people we rep-
resent. It empowers them, not the 
rank-and-file Members. 
So, I believe this is a—and the same 
thing is true on COVID–19, of course. 
We passed the CARES Act in March. 
We tried to come back and replenish 
some of those funds. We were success-
ful in doing so, for example, in the Pay-
check Protection Program, but it was 
obvious there was more need, and on at 
least three occasions—maybe four, but 
at least three—we offered another half 
trillion dollars in relief, only to be 
blocked by Democrats here in the Sen-
ate. 
Speaker PELOSI was candid. She basi-
cally said: Well, this is about politics. 
We don’t want President Trump to get 
credit for Congress stepping up in a bi-
partisan way to provide relief to the 
American people in the runup to the 
election. 
So this is where we are. We know 
what we have to do. We have to prevent 
the government from shutting down. 
We know that there is genuine need 
across the country for more COVID–19 
relief, so we need to do that. But I 
would also point out, we are going to 
do roughly $900 billion of an additional 
COVID–19 relief bill when Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democratic leader in 
the Senate, Senator SCHUMER, turned 
down a $1.8 trillion offer from Sec-
retary of the Treasury Mnuchin. So, 
rather than accept twice as much ear-
lier because it didn’t fit their political 
playbook, now they are accepting half 
when they realized they have run out 
of runway. 
Well, the monthslong stalemate has 
finally broken. Yesterday evening, the 
so-called ‘‘four corners’’—the Speaker, 
the Republican leader in the House, the 
Democratic minority leader here in the 
Senate, and Senator MCCONNELL—they 
reached agreement on a bipartisan 
package of bills to support the Amer-
ican people through the continued 
fight against COVID–19. And despite 
my comments about the process and 
what brings us here with so little time 
and ability to affect some of the con-
tent, I hope this legislation will pass 
and reach the President’s desk in a 
matter of hours. 
I think we could all agree that this 
bill could not have come soon enough. 
Since this summer, Republicans and 
Democrats have been miles apart on 
the size and shape of the next COVID– 
19 bill. Democrats, as I indicated, want-
ed a $3 trillion bill they called the He-
roes Act, while we supported a more 
targeted 
approach. 
That 
is 
when 
Speaker PELOSI uttered those now fa-
mous words: Nothing is better than 
something. 
Well, I have always believed that 
something is better than nothing. But 
the 
big-picture 
disagreements 
pre-
vented any progress from being made, 
even though we, by and large, agreed 
on about 80 percent of what needed to 
be done, and that is included in the bill 
that we will vote on here in the next 
few hours. 
Well, after the election, the Speaker 
and Democratic leader here in the Sen-
ate, I guess, decided that they no 
longer needed to hold the American 
people hostage because the election 
had now come and gone. So there were 
bipartisan negotiations that broke out, 
which have led to targeted package 
bills—to a targeted package that could 
earn the support of both parties and 
the signature of President Trump. It is 
safe to say there could not be a more 
urgent need for action from Congress. 
The last several days have proven 
that we are, indeed, at an inflection 
point—turning point—in our ongoing 
fight against the virus. One successful 
vaccine has already been administered 
to thousands of healthcare workers 
across the country. In my State alone, 
the Governor estimates that a million 
people will be vaccinated by the end of 
this month. That is something we 
should all be thankful for and applaud. 
On Friday evening, the FDA author-
ized a second safe and effective vaccine 
made by Moderna, meaning that mil-
lions more doses will be reaching 
Americans—in particular, our frontline 
heroes—in the coming days. These are 
developments that we have been wait-
ing, hoping, investing, and praying for, 
but it is not a silver bullet. We are still 
battling this pandemic, and it is likely 
to be with us for the foreseeable future. 
But the good news is, people who are 
particularly 
vulnerable 
because 
of 
their age or underlying chronic ill-
nesses will likely be able to get the 
vaccine no later than March. Dr. Fauci 
said that by June, anybody in America 
who wants the vaccine can get it. 
This next phase of our fight will de-
termine how quickly we are able to de-
feat COVID–19 and regrow our econ-
omy. This legislation will clearly help 
us get there. 
First, it will provide the needed sup-
port for vaccine distribution. Not only 
has there been a modern-day medical 
miracle in developing these safe and ef-
fective vaccines, but now the logistics 
of getting it to 330 million people in 
America are completely daunting, but 
it is happening. Millions of doses have 
already been delivered to hospitals 
across the country, and in the coming 
months, tens of millions more will be 
distributed as we launch this massive 
vaccination campaign. 
While the cost of the vaccine has al-
ready been covered, the range of associ-
ated expenses that come with it has 
not been. For everything from trans-
portation infrastructure to deliver the 
vaccines 
to 
ultra-low 
temperature 
freezers to store them, to personal pro-
tective equipment for our healthcare 
heroes to safely administer them, those 
costs have added up and need to be pro-
vided for in this legislation. This legis-
lation will, in fact, provide billions of 
dollars to help cover these kinds of 
costs and to ensure the race to dis-
tribute these vaccines is as successful 
as the race to develop them. 
Part of that is through relief for air-
lines, which will transport the vaccines 
to communities across the country. 
This assistance will enable our airlines 
to carry out their important role in the 
vaccine relay race, all while keeping 
their employees on payroll and pre-
paring for a strong postpandemic re-
covery. 
These two successful vaccines so far 
are moving us closer and closer to the 
end of this crisis, but we still have a 
ways to go, and the American people 
need and deserve our support in getting 
there. 
Millions of workers have no way to 
earn a paycheck. Food banks are expe-
riencing 
Depression-era 
lines 
each 
week. Farmers and ranchers have lost 
their traditional markets. Small busi-
nesses are sinking, and parents and 
teachers are still worried about a safe 
return to in-person learning for our 
students. 
This targeted relief package will send 
desperately needed support to each of 
these groups for each of those causes. 
The workers who had the rug pulled 
out from them earlier this year will 
continue to receive the federally en-
hanced unemployment benefits under 
the CARES Act that would otherwise 
expire the day after Christmas. And 
State unemployment benefits will be

bolstered, as I said, by $300 a week in 
Federal benefits through March 14 of 
next year. 
We will also provide a second, more 
targeted direct payment to the hardest 
hit Americans, with up to $600 per indi-
vidual. That means that a family of 
four making up to $150,000 will receive 
$2,400 in the coming days. This bill will 
ensure that the basic needs of low-in-
come households, schoolchildren, and 
those in long lines at food banks will 
be met. 
It also provides $13 billion for a time- 
limited Federal nutrition benefit in-
crease, as well as at least $1.9 billion 
for the Coronavirus Food Assistance 
Program at food banks. 
Our farmers and ranchers and pro-
ducers who have lost significant or all 
the value of their crops will also re-
ceive $13 billion in agricultural assist-
ance to strengthen the farm safety net 
which benefits us all. 
This has been a difficult year for mil-
lions of families in Texas and across 
the country as parents have worried 
about how to pay bills and buy gro-
ceries, let alone Christmas gifts under 
their tree for their children. 
I know this will not erase all of the 
financial uncertainty, but it will go a 
long way to provide some help to those 
whose livelihoods have been thrown 
into chaos, and I hope it will also pro-
vide reassurance for the parents and 
teachers who have worried about a safe 
return to in-person learning. 
This legislation provides $82 billion 
for education and will help our K–12 
students, colleges, and universities get 
their education programs back on 
track. 
This relief bill will also extend addi-
tional support to Texas small busi-
nesses. Our small businesses continue 
to struggle with the arrival of winter 
weather. That has been especially true 
for restaurants and other businesses 
that have relied on outdoor seating. 
Many of these businesses utilized the 
Paycheck Protection Program to help 
them cover payroll and other expenses 
earlier this year, but the program ex-
pired in August, and our hardest hit 
small businesses are in dire need of 
more support. 
This legislation will provide another 
$284 billion in the Paycheck Protection 
Program. This has been an enormously 
successful program in my State, with 
414,000 loans that are convertible into 
grants 
under 
some 
circumstances 
worth some $41 billion. This has been a 
lifesaver for many of our small busi-
nesses and the workers they employ. 
The hardest hit businesses will be able 
to take a second draw of the PPP and 
provide for stability for their busi-
nesses and their employee until this 
crisis ends. 
I am glad this bill also includes lan-
guage from a bill I introduced to clar-
ify tax deductibility for business ex-
penses paid with a forgiven PPP loan. 
The average PPP loan in Texas was 
$99,000, and without this change, those 
businesses that received that PPP loan 
and grant would face a $36,000 tax li-
ability. 
That would start to show up in Janu-
ary with the estimated taxes being 
paid by many small businesses that 
pay on a quarterly basis. That sort of 
unexpected tax liability would be a 
slap in the face for those businesses 
that saw this life ring and decided to 
grab a hold of it. This change will en-
sure loan recipients aren’t saddled with 
an unexpected tax liability that could 
absolutely sink their struggling busi-
nesses that have been hanging on by a 
thread. 
I appreciate Chairman GRASSLEY of 
the 
Finance 
Committee, 
Ranking 
Member WYDEN, and their staffs for 
fighting to include this change, which 
will clarify that these expenses should 
have been tax deductible all along. 
That is what Congress intended in 
March when we passed the CARES Act. 
I am also glad the Omnibus that is 
paired with this package includes other 
legislation that I introduced with our 
friend AMY
KLOBUCHAR, the Senator 
from Minnesota, called the Save Our 
Stages Act, designed to help our small 
independent 
entertainment 
venues 
across the country from closing their 
doors for good. 
These Main Street businesses were 
excluded from the original Paycheck 
Protection Program, even though they 
were among some of the hardest hit 
small businesses. Event venues were 
the first to close when COVID–19 hit, 
and they are likely to be the last to 
open once it is gone. This funding will 
help them stay afloat until that long- 
awaited day finally arrives. 
I thank Senator KLOBUCHAR, who has 
been my partner in this bipartisan ef-
fort, as well as Senator RUBIO, who has 
been a champion for these venues dur-
ing the final critical stages of negotia-
tions. 
The government funding legislation 
includes a number of other bipartisan 
bills which have had nearly unanimous 
support in both the House and the Sen-
ate, including a bill I introduced with 
our colleague BOB MENENDEZ from New 
Jersey. 
This legislation will finally, after 25 
years or more, establish a National 
Museum of the American Latino, which 
will improve Latino representation 
within the Smithsonian Institution. 
This museum will honor the contribu-
tions of Latinos throughout our Na-
tion’s history and give their stories a 
brick-and-mortar home here in our Na-
tion’s Capital. I am thrilled that gen-
erations of Americans will be able to 
get a more accurate view of our Na-
tion’s history when they visit this new 
Smithsonian museum, and I can’t wait 
to be among its first visitors. 
There is no question that there are 
additional measures I would have liked 
to 
have 
seen 
included 
in 
the 
coronavirus relief legislation, and I am 
sure that is true for every Member. But 
this targeted package includes critical 
funding and support for Texans and 
Americans at this watershed moment, 
and it will break the stalemate which 
has paralyzed Congress for months 
now. 
The American people are suffering. It 
is not time for politics as usual. It is a 
time to come together to compromise 
and to make good on our commitment 
to support them. 
I appreciate the work of our col-
leagues who fought for a deal that will 
give our country added strength during 
this next critical phase of our fight, 
and I look forward to voting for this 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

THANKING STAFF 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, so 
much of the Senate’s work happens be-
hind the scenes and out of the spot-
light. Over the past few weeks, there 
are scores of Senate staffers—probably 
more than scores; hundreds, I would 
say—who have spent many late nights 
and some sleepless ones putting this 
emergency relief and omnibus bill to-
gether, so I wanted to come back to the 
floor today and acknowledge all of the 
hard-working Senate Democratic staff. 
To create a law, there are staffs from 
committees and Senators’ offices who 
are truly experts. They make sure 
what we Senators want to achieve is 
written properly. They have years— 
some, decades—of experience in their

formation of how programs work. They

thank you, thank you, to everyone on 
the committees. 
I also want, for a moment, to thank 
my staff. Everyone believes they have 
the best staff on the Hill. I am cer-
tainly no exception. I would never ever, 
ever be able to do what I do without 
them. I know over the past several 
days many of them have tested the 
limits of exhaustion, hardly sleeping at 
all, but I want them to know that all 
their energy, ingenuity, and brilliance 
will have made the lives of their fellow 
citizens better in New York and across 
the country. 
I have told them that they can look 
back at any age and know they have 
kept businesses going, kept people em-
ployed, kept people fed, kept people 
from getting sick, and even kept people 
from dying, kept people alive. That is 
the great work my staff and the other 
staffs have done. 
So to my staff, whom I am so deeply, 
deeply grateful to, thank you, thank 
you. Thank you to my chief, Mike 
Lynch; my deputy chief, Erin Sager 
Vaughn; my policy director, Gerry 
Petrella, and my legislative director 
and his wife, Meghan Taira; my State 
director, Martin Brennan; deputy State 
director, Steve Mann; Steve Barton; 
Mike Ianelli; and all the regional direc-
tors from across the State. 
The executive team in my office is a 
tremendous asset to me and to the 
Democratic caucus: Michelle Mittler, 
Megan Murphy Vlasto, Emily Sweda, 
Raisa Shah, and Sophia Coutavas. 
The press team supports both me and 
the entire Democratic caucus day in 
and day out: Justin Goodman, Alex 
Nguyen, Monica Lee, Ken Meyer, An-
gelo Roefaro, Allison Biasotti, Paige 
Tepke, Alice Nam, and everyone at the 
Senate Democratic Media Center. 
Jasmine Harris, Oriana Pina, and 
Dan Yoken and his amazing team of re-
searchers: Andrew Ogden, Leela Najafi, 
and Hanna Talley. 
The whole team is supported by the 
great budding talent of our press as-
sistants: Alexandra Robinson, Alexa 
Sledge, and Cyre Velez. 
Cietta Kiandoli, Sol Ortega, and 
Julietta Lopez do fantastic engage-
ment with many groups of people af-
fected by the legislation we pass. 
Josh Molofsky and Tony Rivera are 
my speechwriters and every day bring 
poetry 
and 
organization 
to 
my 
thoughts. 
A special, special thanks to the Schu-
mer ‘‘Legislative Team.’’ These staff-
ers are so incredibly hard-working and 
are always striving to find the best so-
lution for our country and New York: 
Anna Taylor and Marisa Hawley; Jon 
Cardinal, Leeann Sinpatanasakul, and 
Rob Hickman; Mike Kuiken, Reza 
Zomorrodian, and Yazeed Abdelhaq; 
Matt Fuentes, Dili Sundaramoorthy, 
and Juan Negrete; Christina Hender-
son, who just won for city council in 
Washington, DC, and is leaving us; 
Ramon Carranza; Catalina Tam; Lane 
Bodian and Rodney Kazibwe; Veronica 
Watters; Zack Rosenblum, Ryan Eagan

and Vandan Patel; Reggie Babin, Lucy 
Panza, Mark Patterson, Didier Barjon; 
Helena Contes; Charlie Ellsworth, Kai 
Vogel; Jim Secreto, Patricio Gonzalez, 
and Josh Gutmaker. 
And, of course, I have to thank the 
brilliant 
floor 
staff 
led 
by 
Gary 
Myrick. What a blessing. 
A special thank-you from me and the 
caucus and the entire staff to Tricia 
Engle, Dan Tinsley, Brad Watt, Steph-
anie 
Paone, 
Liza 
Patterson, 
Nate 
Oursler, and Rachel Jackson. 
Thank you and also farewell to 
Reema Dodin, Senator DURBIN’s tre-
mendous floor staffer who for years has 
looked after the caucus and the floor. 
She is heading to the White House to 
help 
the 
President-elect, 
and 
we 
couldn’t be happier and prouder to 
have a Senate denizen at the other end 
of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
There are so many more incredible 
staffers who deserve recognition and 
thanks for making this institution 
come to life. My entire staff helped 
with the efforts this year, and as I con-
clude today, they are still helping. I 
would like to include all of their names 
in the RECORD. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the following names: 
There being no objection; the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. SCHUMER. It is a lot of names.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE ANDERSON 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
would like to recognize a critical mem-
ber of my staff, Mike Anderson—he is 
known as ‘‘Big Mike’’—who left my of-
fice in August to pursue a legal career 
in his hometown of Anchorage, AK— 
something he has aspired to do since a 
young age. 
Mike was my communications direc-
tor, but it was much more of an appro-
priate title for Mike because he di-
rected so many things in my office, so 
much of our communication both in-
ternally and externally. You would 
often find Mike going from staff mem-
ber to staff member, asking them ques-
tions, relaying information from one 
team to the next. 
In our office, if you had a question 
about what anybody was up to, what 
anybody was doing in Alaska, here in 
our DC office, in our Alaskan offices, 
you would ask Mike. That is a special 
quality. He is an incredibly hard work-
er, incredibly gifted young man, and we 
are going to miss that talent in Mike 
very much. 
Mike is no stranger to Alaska polit-
ical offices. Fresh out of college at the 
University of Alaska Fairbanks, he 
took a job with Congressman YOUNG 
and then worked for Senator MUR-
KOWSKI. 
In 2014, he was looking for a little 
more adventure on the calm side. I was 
looking for someone to help with my 
communications on my campaign. It 
was my first run for office. I was run-
ning against an incumbent with big 
name recognition in our State. Mike 
came on board and took a chance on 
me. It is something I will never for-
get—loyal, great worker. 
He had been taking a lot of classes at 
night at Catholic University of Amer-
ica for the past few years, working in 
my office, and balancing it all. He was 
on the clock around the clock and did 
it with grace, humor, hard work, and 
excellence. 
As I mentioned, he was our office 
communicator, but he was also the of-
fice friend, the person you would go to 
for advice on things big and small, the 
person you would call on for an assist 
if you needed to move. It helped that 
he lived up to his name—6 feet, 8 
inches. He is a big guy. Mike always 
showed up, working together—as we 
called in our office one team, one fight. 
We got big things done for our State. 
Speaking of one team, one fight, my 
office has a pretty good hoops team. 
Mike, as you can imagine—UAF var-
sity basketball player back in Alaska— 
was the critical member of that team. 
We have won a lot of games, particu-
larly against the Cruz Texans. In fact, 
Senator CRUZ once gave Mike the nick-
name ‘‘Denali’’ for his size and how he 
dominates the middle of the key on the 
hoops court. 
Mike is going to make a great lawyer 
in Alaska. As a State, we have so much 
potential—the biggest fisheries in the 
country, the largest energy fields, huge 
military complexes, and fascinating, 
important Alaskan Native legal issues. 
More than anything, Alaska needs good 
leaders with integrity, brilliant law-
yers, hard-working people like Mike 
who love their State and give it all 
back to their State, and that is what 
he is going to do. 
We haven’t seen the last of Mike. He 
has always been part of our team, and 
I am sure that is what he will do, work-
ing continually in the great State of 
Alaska to make sure our State thrives. 
Mike, great job. Good luck to you. 
You are going to be missed. Best wish-
es on a bright future ahead.

CHINA 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
despite what you might be reading in 
the press, there are a lot of recent, im-
portant, bipartisan achievements hap-
pening right here in the Senate. We are 
going to vote soon on another major 
COVID relief bill, which is really im-
portant. That will be our fourth major 
COVID relief bill this year—much 
needed, of course, for the health of 
Americans and for our economy. I 
think that when the history of this 
very challenging year is written, that 
is what is going to be remembered— 
four 
major, 
bipartisan, 
important 
pieces of legislation, not the rancor in 
the Senate, which has been part of our 
history, part of the Republic since the 
founding of the Republic. 
A number of other major bipartisan 
accomplishments have also occurred 
just in the past few months—the Na-
tional 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act, 
which passed with over 80 Senators; the 
Great American Outdoors Act, prob-
ably the biggest conservation act in 
over 50 years; and the Save Our Seas 
2.0, a bill I was proud to author, the 
most comprehensive ocean cleanup leg-
islation ever to come out of the Con-
gress. This is just to name a few. 
Let me name another important bi-
partisan accomplishment that is start-
ing to occur in the Congress, and that 
is dealing with China, the important 
issue of China and China policy. I know 
people might be saying: Wait, are you 
crazy? 
China? 
There 
is 
bipartisan 
agreement on what is happening with 
regard to this relationship, the United 
States and China? 
The answer is, yes, we have made sig-
nificant progress on this issue, too, and 
it is important. I want to explain that 
a little bit because I think it is a topic 
that we need to be focusing on more 
and more in the U.S. Senate. 
Like the Presiding Officer, I am hon-
ored to be completing my first term as 
a U.S. Senator and honored, like the 
Presiding Officer, to have been re-
elected to continue my service. 
Six years ago when I started my time 
here in the U.S. Senate, I started a se-
ries of speeches that focused on the 
U.S.-China relationship and the impor-
tance of it. We all have been focused 
post-9/11 certainly on al-Qaida, ISIS, 
the big issue of violent extremist orga-
nizations, which has been the appro-
priate focus. But as I started my career 
here 6 years ago, I started to give a se-
ries of speeches where I said the big-
gest challenge that we face long term 
from a geostrategic standpoint for the 
United States for decades to come is 
going to be our relationship with the 
rising power of China. 
What I was saying 4 years ago, 5 
years ago in this body is that nobody is 
talking about it. It is really important, 
and we are not focused on it. You can’t 
say that anymore. Now everybody is 
talking about China. There has been an 
American awakening about China. And 
that is good. That is important. That is 
progress. And it has been bipartisan. 
I want to thank President Trump and 
his team because I think they deserve 
a lot of the credit. 
They laid out their national security 
strategy, their national defense strat-
egy. These are very well-written strat-
egies that, in essence, said that in the 
United States of America, post 9/11, it 
was appropriate to focus on al-Qaida, 
ISIS, violent extremist organizations, 
getting weapons of mass destruction. 
That was clearly the main focus of our 
national security. 
But what their strategies have been 
saying is that, yes, we need to continue 
to focus on that, but now we need to 
prioritize the great power competition

that is upon us with China as the pac-
ing threat. 
As you know, most Senators—Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans—particularly 
the ones who focus on national secu-
rity and foreign policy issues, particu-
larly those on the Armed Services 
Committee—they agree with us. They 
agree with this reorientation. Again, 
this is important. This is progress, bi-
partisan progress, on what is really 
going to be one of the most—what is 
the most important bilateral relation-
ship in the world. 
What we need to start doing—and I 
say ‘‘we,’’ this body, the Congress, the 
executive branch—is we need to start 
putting details and principles into a 
long-term strategy, a bipartisan strat-
egy that will be enduring to address 
this challenge, to address the challenge 
that is the challenge for the next dec-
ade—the rise of China and how we, as 
the United States of America, need to 
deal with it. As I mentioned, I believe 
this is going to be the defining national 
security issue for our Nation for the 
next 50 to 100 years. 
What I want to do today is lay out a 
couple of key principles on what I see 
are some of the ways in which we can 
bring a bipartisan approach to address-
ing this challenge. Last year, I was 
honored to be invited by the heritage 
center—the Heritage Foundation—as 
part of their lead lecture series on the 
Asia-Pacific to talk about this issue. I 
gave remarks, an address that I called 
‘‘Winning the New Cold War with China 
and How America Should Respond.’’ 
Some of the principles that I laid out 
in that address from some of my expe-
riences in the U.S. relationship with 
China over the last quarter century are 
what I would like to talk about. Those 
experiences for me have kind of run the 
gamut as a U.S. marine; as a National 
Security Council staffer and Assistant 
Secretary of State under the excep-
tional leader, Condoleezza Rice, when 
she was National Security Advisor and 
then Secretary of State; as the State of 
Alaska cabinet official in charge of en-
ergy and natural resources—which are 
so important to my State but also to 
Asian markets—and as a U.S. Senator. 
First things first: I believe, as I men-
tioned, there has been an awakening 
about the challenge posed by China. As 
I mentioned, 6 years ago in this body, 
not a lot of Senators were talking 
about it. Now everybody is, and that is 
important. I also think that there is a 
recognition—whatever you want to call 
the tensions that have arisen—that the 
U.S. and China have entered into a 
much more strategic competition era— 
phase—with tensions that I have re-
ferred to as a ‘‘new Cold War’’ with 
each other. This state of relations has 
only been exacerbated by the pan-
demic, which, of course, started in 
China and was covered up by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
When I talk about this issue of a new 
Cold War with China, I want to be clear 
on one thing. This is not a challenge— 
or tensions—of our choosing. It is the 
result of a conscious decision by the 
Communist Party leadership of China 
to overturn key elements of the U.S.- 
led, rules-based international order, de-
spite that order enabling China to 
emerge prosperous and strong from its 
so-called century of humiliation. This 
new Cold War is not an inevitable con-
sequence of China’s rise or our status 
as an established power. Rather, I be-
lieve, it stems from China’s rejection 
of becoming a ‘‘responsible stake-
holder’’ in the international system 
that the United States has led since 
the end of World War II—a system from 
which China probably, more than any 
other country in the world, has bene-
fited from. 
But recognizing that we have this 
new tension, that we have a new Cold 
War with China, does not mean that 
the nature of the global challenge is 
identical to that posed by the Soviet 
Union or that our response should be 
the same. However, it does mean that 
the United States and our allies need 
to recognize this challenge, address it, 
counter it in ways that avoid major 
conflict but in ways that also avoid 
compromising our core values and in-
terests and principles in liberty. 
Let me talk a little bit about what I 
call America’s awakening. 
Since President Nixon initiated the 
opening of relationships with China, 
many hoped that the country’s polit-
ical and economic system would open 
as the country developed and joined 
this broader, Western-led international 
system. Others believed that even if 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
re-
mained in control, its external behav-
ior and relationship with the United 
States would not be affected. When the 
United States supported Chinese entry 
into the World Trade Organization, 
President Bill Clinton remarked that 
American 
workers 
and 
consumers 
would be the greatest beneficiaries— 
American workers. Ultimately, this 
has proven not to be true. 
Equally misguided was the hope that 
as China grew economically, it would 
liberalize politically. The expectation 
was that China would lower its trade 
barriers and follow WTO practices, re-
specting intellectual property rights, 
promoting basic safety standards for 
exports, curbing subsidies of its main 
industries, and not subjecting im-
ports—our imports—to illegal, non-
tariff barriers. None of that has turned 
out to be true. China did not meet 
most of its commitments under the 
WTO and still hasn’t. Rather, it has 
employed its new access to Western 
markets—American markets—to pur-
sue large-scale theft of technology, ex-
ploiting the openness of the American 
economy without allowing American 
companies reciprocal access to its mar-
kets as it is required to do. 
Let me give one example of this that 
I have seen in my experience. In 2003, 
over 17 years ago, I was in an Oval Of-
fice meeting as a National Security 
Council staffer with President George 
W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and the 
Vice Premier of China, Madam Wu Yi, 
at the time. The President, President 
Bush, strongly believed in the protec-
tion of intellectual property rights, 
and he raised this issue with Madam 
Wu Yi right there in the office—very 
aggressively, leaning over in his chair. 
Madam Wu Yi looked at the President 
of the United States and said: Mr. 
President, I am in charge of this. We 
are going to fix this. We are working 
on it. You have my commitment, Mr. 
President. That was in the Oval Office, 
17 years ago. 
Where are we on intellectual prop-
erty theft from China? It is worse 
today than when Madam Wu Yi made 
that commitment in the Oval Office. 
As a matter of fact, the U.S. Trade 
Representative Office estimates that 
Chinese theft of American intellectual 
property costs the U.S. economy an es-
timated $600 billion annually, not to 
mention the thousands of jobs lost. 
President Obama also tried to stem 
these blatantly unfair, nonreciprocal 
practices, but Beijing did not honor the 
common 
understanding 
reached 
by 
President Obama and Xi Jinping in 
2015, curbing cyber hacking of govern-
ment and corporate data for economic 
gain. Such theft continues unabated 
today. 
These episodes raise an even bigger 
problem between the United States and 
China. It is the problem that I call 
‘‘promise fatigue’’ with China. Think 
about it. Broken promises extend well 
beyond the economic sphere, like intel-
lectual property. 
Here is another example. Standing 
next to President Obama in the Rose 
Garden in 2015, President Xi Jinping 
promised the President of the United 
States not to militarize the South 
China Sea. The commitment was bro-
ken within months, when China took a 
very aggressive policy of militarizing 
many of the islands and built up is-
lands in the South China Sea to the 
consternation of every single country 
in the region. After enduring this 
promise fatigue with the Chinese for 
decades, we, the Congress, the execu-
tive branch of the U.S. Government, 
are finally getting wise. Everybody 
thinks trade should be a win-win, but 
Chinese leaders appear to view it much 
more as a zero-sum game. 
Ironically, this promise fatigue and 
China’s predatory, nonreciprocal trade 
practices have brought about—and did 
bring about—the new, much tougher, 
and, in my view, much needed approach 
from the Trump administration that 
we had prior to the pandemic. 
We have this situation where we are 
not trusting our relationship with 
China with promises that have been 
made but have not been kept across a 
whole host of spheres, where the ten-
sions in the South China Sea are grow-
ing. But this current state of affairs 
was not preordained. 
In 2005, then Deputy Secretary of 
State and future World Bank President 
Robert Zoellick encouraged China in a 
very well-regarded speech to become a

‘‘responsible stakeholder’’ in the inter-
national system, which had done so 
much to enable China’s rise in pros-
perity. Zoellick’s speech challenged 
China to change its behavior, to sup-
port and promote and, certainly, not 
undermine the U.S.-led economic order 
that had brought peace and prosperity 
to China and so many other countries 
in the Indo-Pacific. 
For a time, it appeared that China’s 
leadership 
was 
contemplating 
this 
American offer to be a responsible 
stakeholder in this global system—the 
one that we had set up after World War 
II. In my trips as an Assistant Sec-
retary of State to China, I heard Chi-
na’s leadership in many meetings—in-
cluding in meetings with Hu Jintao, 
the President, and other senior lead-
ers—where they talked about being a 
responsible stakeholder, where this in-
vitation on working through the sys-
tem we had developed was clearly 
something they were contemplating. 
But over time, it has become increas-
ingly clear that the Chinese Com-
munist Party has rejected this concept, 
this idea to be a partner with us in bol-
stering the international order that 
has benefited China so significantly. 
In fact, the opposite has happened. 
China is now working to systemically 
build an illiberal sphere of influence 
that threatens to exclude America and 
erode our alliances in the region that 
have kept the peace in the region for 
decades. The challenge we face today is 
rooted in the attempt by the Com-
munist Party of China to popularize its 
authoritarian model abroad to ensure 
China’s rise as a great power under the 
Communist Party’s leadership. Presi-
dent Xi made this clear at the 19th 
Party Congress, where he championed 
China’s model as a new option for other 
countries and nations that want to 
speed up their development. We must 
always remember, the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s primary goal in domes-
tic and foreign policy is to ensure the 
survival and preeminence of the party. 
The key driver of U.S.-China com-
petition and tension today is China’s 
ambition to project its authoritarian 
model abroad. China’s development 
under a Leninist political model serves 
as an inspiration for many illiberal ac-
tors and aspiring autocrats around the 
world. It uses its economic influence as 
a means of exerting political pressure. 
Additionally, Chinese companies and 
state-owned and state-subsidized indus-
tries are not bound by the anti-corrup-
tion laws that American and Western 
companies must adhere to. 
Chinese indifference to establishing 
standards of transparency, which we 
have certainly seen now with the pan-
demic, and project implementation 
through its Belt and Road Initiative re-
sult in elite deals that concede corrup-
tion abroad, weaken prospects for long- 
term prosperity, and undermine the 
sovereignty of weaker nations. 
China is seeking to undermine de-
mocracy and human rights and the rule 
of law and international institutions— 
from pushing its norms for controlling 
cyber space to silencing critics of its 
human rights record, including critics 
in the United States, to pushing for the 
enforcement of the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative at the United Nations. China is 
using its growing voice on the global 
stage to legitimize an approach at 
home and abroad that undermines 
American interests. 
A recent Hoover Institution study ar-
gues that China is looking to gain in-
fluence in the United States to shape 
attitudes and, ultimately, American 
policy toward China. And although we 
have not experienced the same level of 
political interference as, say, some of 
our allies, like Australia, where politi-
cians and donors linked to the Chinese 
Communist Party try to sway the 
country’s policies on sensitive issues, 
China is clearly engaged in what the 
National Endowment for Democracy 
calls a significant, sharp-powered cam-
paign to influence American policy 
here at home. This recent spy scandal 
with a Congressman from California is 
just a recent example of this. 
Fortunately, the Trump administra-
tion and Members of Congress on both 
sides of the aisle have awakened to the 
long-term challenge that China poses 
to America’s national security and eco-
nomic security interests. As I noted, 
the Trump administration’s more real-
istic approach on China, laid out in its 
national security strategy and national 
defense strategy, offers a clear-eyed 
view of Chinese ambitions and our need 
to counter them. At a time when there 
is not enough bipartisan agreement— 
although, I think there is more than, 
certainly, we get credit for—there is 
broad, bipartisan focus and support 
within the U.S. Government and, I be-
lieve, in the U.S. Senate on the stra-
tegic challenges posed by China. 
So we have had an important Amer-
ican awakening and a good beginning 
with the recent U.S. national security 
and national defense strategies, and I 
believe it is strongly in America’s in-
terest for the incoming Biden-Harris 
administration to continue these strat-
egies that have strong bipartisan sup-
port here. In fact, in my recent meet-
ing with Secretary of Defense nominee 
GEN Lloyd Austin, I encouraged such 
an 
approach 
on 
national 
security 
issues, particularly as it related to 
China. 
Yet these strategic documents that 
we are talking about need more meat 
on the bones. What are more details 
and principles that we can add to the 
national security strategy of our Na-
tion that can ensure bipartisan support 
for a longer term U.S.-China strategy? 
Let me recommend five core elements 
that, I think, should be key in moving 
forward with regard to our relationship 
with China. 
First, we need to demand reciprocity 
in all major spheres of the U.S.-China 
relationship. Second, we need to rein-
vigorate American competitiveness so 
we can outcompete and outinnovate 
China. Third, we need to continue to 
rebuild our military’s strength and ca-
pability. Fourth, we need to deepen and 
expand our global network of alliances. 
Finally, we need to remember that em-
ploying our democratic values is a 
huge, critical, comparative advantage 
in countering China’s global authori-
tarian influence around the world. So 
let me briefly touch on each of these. 
First, we need to demand reciprocity. 
The United States must insist that the 
relationship with China be defined by 
reciprocity and fairness. For too long, 
the United States has ignored the 
promise fatigue—that I have talked 
about—with 
China 
and 
accepted 
unfulfilled Chinese promises across so 
many spheres of the bilateral relation-
ship. You have seen it. When you raise 
the issue of reciprocity with senior 
Chinese officials, whether that be in 
Beijing or with the Ambassador, and 
they finally acknowledge that, yes, the 
relationship isn’t reciprocal, they say 
it is because ‘‘China is still a devel-
oping country.’’ 
I would respectfully tell senior Chi-
nese officials: Don’t use that argument 
anymore. It is an insult to the intel-
ligence of American officials. We need 
a reciprocal relationship because every 
American understands and agrees with 
this—that it is about fairness, basic 
fairness. 
I posed an important question of reci-
procity to former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger at a Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing a couple 
of years ago, and he acknowledged 
that, to have an important, sustain-
able, great-power relationship between 
two of the most important countries in 
the world, reciprocity was critical. The 
citizens of our country need to feel 
that the relationship is fair and that a 
general policy of reciprocity is impor-
tant and critical in that regard, but we 
all know it hasn’t been that way. 
The Trump administration has made 
significant progress on pressing for 
more reciprocal relationships in our 
trading relationships, which is very im-
portant, but we all know that the re-
ciprocal relationship doesn’t exist. Chi-
nese 
companies 
and 
government- 
backed investment funds can come to 
the United States and buy companies, 
but we would have no opportunity to 
do the same. Yet it needs to go much 
further than economics. Let me give 
you an example. We need reciprocity in 
the free exchange of ideas. American 
journalists are not allowed to travel 
freely in China, and if they are not, 
then, why should Chinese journalists 
be allowed to travel freely in the 
United States? 
Similarly—and this body is focused 
on this—there are over 100 Confucius 
Institutes, established by the Chinese 
Communist Party, at American univer-
sities. When I was in Beijing a couple 
of years ago and met with senior Chi-
nese officials, I mentioned this. 
I said: I was recently with the Am-
bassador, and he said that just to go on 
the campus of Beijing University you 
need to be accompanied by a Chinese

official. So if there were real reci-
procity in the relationship, if you can 
have Confucius Institutes at American 
universities, how about we get James 
Madison Institutes of freedom and lib-
erty at Chinese universities? 
Of course, the Chinese wouldn’t ac-
cept that. 
They said: Well, Senator, Confucius 
Institutes only teach culture and lan-
guage, and a James Madison Institute 
of freedom and liberty and democracy 
in China would be teaching propa-
ganda. 
That is what they said. 
This is just one of many examples 
wherein we must have a reciprocal re-
lationship between the United States 
and China going forward. 
Second, we must reinvigorate Amer-
ican 
competitiveness. 
The 
United 
States is no stranger to global military 
and economic cooperation, as we have 
known throughout the Cold War with 
the Soviet Union. Our comparative ad-
vantages globally remain significant, 
but we can and should do more to bol-
ster other areas at home. We should 
bolster STEM education, double down 
on basic research, and support Federal 
agencies like the National Science 
Foundation. 
We need to be able to outcompete and 
outinnovate China, and, importantly, 
better understand China, its culture, 
its language, its history, and its strat-
egy with the new generations of Ameri-
cans who are focused on these issues, 
just as Russian and Soviet studies were 
emphasized during the Cold War with 
the Soviet Union. Many of our most 
significant 
challenges—our 
national 
debt, infrastructure projects that take 
years to permit, an education system 
that leaves too many Americans be-
hind, a dysfunctional immigration sys-
tem—are all self-inflicted wounds. 
I believe that the real challenges 
posed by China, as they become more 
broadly apparent throughout our coun-
try, will start to spur the bipartisan 
motivation that will be needed to ad-
dress these significant but solvable 
American challenges in order to make 
us stronger. 
Third, we must continue to rebuild 
our military. From 2010 to 2016, the De-
partment 
of 
Defense’s 
budget 
was 
slashed by 25 percent. Readiness plum-
meted, and at the same time, the Chi-
nese undertook a massive building of 
its military and the modernization of 
its forces while it also made concrete 
moves to militarize the South China 
Sea. History shows, particularly with 
regard 
to 
America’s 
authoritarian 
rival, that American military weak-
ness encourages authoritarian provo-
cations globally. We must make sure 
that, as we continue to engage China, a 
strong U.S. military provides a hedge 
against Beijing’s contemplating risky 
and destabilizing military actions as 
its military strength and capabilities 
continue to grow. China has a long his-
tory of using its military to achieve 
strategic ends when countries are not 
ready, and we must be ready. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, I 
have mentioned that, gosh, almost 25 
years ago, I was a young marine infan-
try officer who was deployed as part of 
an amphibious task force to the Tai-
wan Strait, which included two carrier 
battle groups as part of the U.S. re-
sponse to Chinese provocations on the 
eve of the Presidential elections in Tai-
wan. It was a long time ago, but it was 
certainly an example of the American 
commitment and resolve of one of our 
allies during a period of heightened 
tensions in the Taiwan Strait that we 
need to remember and be able to react 
to with a strong military. 
Fourth, we need to expand and deep-
en our alliances. The recalibration of 
our relationship with China should be 
done in partnership with our allies. 
The cultivation and nurturing of these 
relationships must be a foundational 
pillar of any American strategy as it 
deals with China. 
Our greatest strategic advantage in 
dealing with China is this: We are now 
a rich nation with longstanding histor-
ical ties that have been reinforced by 
decades of diplomatic, military, and 
economic cooperation based on shared 
values with our friends and allies in 
the region. By contrast, China is an 
ally-poor nation, with North Korea as 
its closest friend and ally. The unity of 
the West and our Asian allies is essen-
tial to maintaining high global stand-
ards and transparency, accountability, 
anti-corruption, a peaceful resolution 
of conflict, and the importance of 
international law, particularly in the 
global areas of sea, space, and cyber 
space. 
Finally, we must employ America’s 
democratic values as a critical com-
parative advantage. We should never 
forget that our democratic values were 
critical in our successful victory over 
the Soviet Union during the last Cold 
War. In President Reagan’s famous 
Westminster speech before the British 
Parliament 
in 
1982, 
in 
which 
he 
launched the National Endowment for 
Democracy, he argued that America 
would win the Cold War not through 
hard power alone but through the 
power of our ideals. 
As he reminded our audience and our 
close allies in Britain, ‘‘Any system is 
inherently unstable that has no peace-
ful means of legitimizing its leaders.’’ 
China’s unelected leaders, like all au-
thoritarians, ultimately fear their own 
people. Our leaders do not. 
It is fear that has driven China to de-
velop an Orwellian social credit score 
to rank its people, while detaining as 
many as 1 million Chinese workers in 
concentration camps. Why else does 
the Chinese Communist Party invest so 
heavily in facial and gait recognition 
technology to monitor their own citi-
zens? Why comprehensively censor the 
internet to preclude even the most 
glancing criticism of the Communist 
Party and its leaders? Why do China’s 
internal security services employ more 
people than the People’s Liberation 
Army, the world’s largest military? 
The answer lies in fear, and the goal, 
above all else, to make sure the Com-
munist Party remains in power. 
President Reagan saw the power and 
promise of our democratic ideals as a 
potent critical instrument to challenge 
America’s global rival, then the Soviet 
Union, because the aspiration of free-
dom is universal and remains the core 
commonality 
that 
underpins 
the 
strongest partnerships of the United 
States with other nations. The belief 
that liberty, democracy, and free mar-
kets reflect and strengthen the size of 
our alliance system is something that 
is fundamental to the United States 
and our allies during the Cold War with 
the Soviet Union and now during our 
challenges with China. Helping coun-
tries protect their sovereignty so they 
can be responsive to their citizens and 
effective partners of our Nation is im-
perative at a time when Chinese influ-
ence risks pulling nations into a new 
‘‘Sinosphere’’ hostile to American in-
terests and our democratic ideals. 
Let me conclude by predicting that 
the new challenges I describe with 
China are going to be with us for dec-
ades. We must face this fact with con-
fidence and strategic resolve and bipar-
tisan work in the U.S. Senate. 
America has extraordinary advan-
tages relative to China: our global net-
work of alliances, our military power 
and economic leadership, our innova-
tive society, our abundant energy sup-
plies—we are now the No. 1 producer of 
oil, natural gas, and renewables in the 
world—our world-class universities, the 
world’s most productive workforce, and 
a democratic value system that makes 
countries far more comfortable as 
American partners than subservient 
members of a new ‘‘Middle Kingdom’’ 
led by China. 
As a result of the long twilight strug-
gle with the Soviet Union, we also 
know what works—maintaining peace 
through strength, promoting free mar-
kets and free people at home, and hav-
ing the confidence in George Kennan’s 
insight that the Chinese Communist 
Party, like the Soviet Communist 
Party, likely bears within it the seeds 
of its own decay. 
While 
democracies 
are 
resilient, 
adaptive, and self-renewing, there are 
many vulnerabilities embedded in Chi-
na’s perceived strengths. 
One-man rule creates acute political 
risks. Historical grievance can breed 
violent 
nationalism. 
State-directed 
economic growth can produce massive 
overcapacity and mountains of debt. 
The gradual snuffing out of freedom in 
places like Hong Kong creates sponta-
neous protests of tens of thousands and 
huge global backlashes across the 
world. China’s budding military power 
and historical view of itself as a nation 
and culture superior to others is begin-
ning to alarm neighboring states, in-
spiring them to step up security co-
operation with our Nation. Nearly half 
of all wealthy Chinese want to emi-
grate—and these are the winners from 
China’s four decades of heady economic 
growth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7908 
December 21, 2020 
As we have in the past, Americans 
can prevail in this geopolitical and ide-
ological contest, but doing so will re-
quire a new level of strategic initia-
tive, organization, and confidence in 
who we are and what we stand for. This 
also means that we must redouble our 
efforts in making this strategic case to 
others around the world, particularly 
our allies, and we must continue to 
work on bipartisan solutions that have 
enduring support in this body for dec-
ades to come as it relates to our chal-
lenges with China. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Alaska. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
this is the time of year when we all 
look forward to wrapping things up, as 
they say. 
Many around the country, when they 
think about wrapping things up, think 
about presents that they are going to 
put under the tree for their family. We 
think about it as closing up business 
for the balance of the year, and that is 
really where we are. 
Hopefully, in a couple hours here, the 
House will proceed in taking up the 
omnibus bill, along with the COVID re-
lief package, along with a host of other 
matters that the Congress has been 
working to address in this past year. 
I would like to speak this evening for 
a few moments on the significance of 
where we are, but I want to start with 
just a story that I just now received 
from one of my staff people back in 
Alaska, and she got a video from the 
medical staff at the Sub-Regional Clin-
ic there at St. Mary’s. St. Mary’s is a 
small community up on the Yukon 
River, and probably, I would say, 500 
people, maybe more, in St. Mary’s. But 
it is just a reminder to me that, re-
gardless of where you are, hope is com-
ing with the vaccine. 
The comment that she shared is this 
video, a pictorial of the health aides, 
the PA—the physician’s assistant—and 
personnel getting their COVID shots. 
It was 13 degrees out. And the mobile 
office where the vaccine was adminis-
tered was inside a chartered Cessna 208 
Caravan sitting on the airport tarmac 
there in St. Mary’s. After the shot, she 
and her staff hung out in their heated 
trucks for about a half an hour to see 
if they had any allergic reactions. 
When none showed signs, the Caravan 
took off to the next village airport. 
It is just an example that no matter 
where you are, how remote you may 
be, the logistics that may be required 
to provide for this hope that comes by 
way of the vaccine. 
People around the country are hope-
ful. Our job now, as we wrap up, is to 
make sure that we deliver this relief 
quickly. 
I mention the COVID relief. I have 
been fortunate to be teaming with a bi-
partisan, 
bicameral 
group 
of 
law-
makers for the past 5 or 6 weeks to see 
if we couldn’t come up with a proposal 
that could kick-start the COVID talks. 
We have had an opportunity for 
many of us to come to the floor to 
speak to not only how that came to be 
but the ultimate result, which was a 
multihundred-page document, legisla-
tion, that totaled $908 billion. But it 
addressed everything from vaccine de-
velopment and distribution to what we 
are going to do to assist our small busi-
nesses with additional rounds of PPP, 
to extensions to unemployment insur-
ance, to what we can do with food as-
sistance, 
nutrition 
assistance, 
and 
what more might be done to help with 
rental assistance. It was truly respon-
sive to the need. 
Where we are today is having moved 
that conversation and that debate for-
ward, I think, in a constructive, in a 
positive way. We are here with a pro-
posal that looks different than what we 
had produced, but that is the nature of 
what happens in a body where you have 
to come together to sort out the issues. 
And what we will have is legislation 
that, again, like the CARES Act, is 
likely going to be proven imperfect, 
but we have to respond to the situation 
on the ground, whether it is in Alaska 
or whether it is in Arkansas, and we 
cannot do it too soon. So this is going 
to be key, and it is going to be critical. 
I am very pleased that legislation 
that I had introduced that would ex-
tend the coronavirus relief funding— 
the opportunity for States and local-
ities and Tribal governments to be able 
to spend those funds down. Running up 
against the deadline here of the end of 
this year was a real concern for so 
many, and so that has been included as 
part of this bigger package, in addition 
to so much that is good. 
The carrier for all of this is the Om-
nibus appropriations bill. I have been 
really pleased to be a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. For some 
years now, I have been chairing the Ap-
propriations Interior Subcommittee. 
This is significant, certainly, for our 
State, with oversight of our public 
lands, and also of Native affairs, in-
cluding the EPA. It is a pretty broad 
portfolio. 
We have been working on this duti-
fully as a subcommittee all year—all 
year. I certainly wish that I had had 
the opportunity to be able to bring my 
bill—our bill—to the floor for full de-
bate by all Members, and then we could 
move to the Ag bill, to the T-HUD bill, 
to the Defense bill—do them all sepa-
rately. 
But for a host of different reasons— 
most of them all come back to poli-
tics—unfortunately, we have not been 
able to do that. That is something that 
I regret. That is something that I 
would hope that we, as Members of the 
Senate, can say: We can do better. 
We pledge to do it better every year. 
We put our colleagues in a heck of a 
spot. Not all of us are on the Appro-
priations Committee. Not all of us have 
the privilege to be a chairman or a 
ranking member and know the guts 
and the insides of each aspect of these 
bills. 
But we come here with a process like 
this at a late hour, and we say: This is 
one where you need to know that we 
have been working it hard. We have 
taken into account all the priorities 
and considerations on both sides. We 
worked it back and forth. We worked it 
with the House, and here we are. But 
this is not a good process. We can and 
we must do better with that. 
Now, having said that, I am very 
proud of the Interior bill that we have 
built. I am proud of my staff. We were 
a little bit leaner this year in terms of 
our staffing, but with good leadership, 
led by Emy Lesofski and Nona, as well 
as Lucas on the team, we were able to 
do the work that we needed to do and 
in a way that I am proud of and proud 
of their efforts. 
There is so much that is wrapped up 
in this bigger, broader bill, and I think 
it is going to almost be gaspworthy 
when you see the 5,000-some-odd pages 
I am told that we will have. 
It is not only the appropriations. It is 
the COVID bills. It is the water re-
sources development bill, the WRDA 
bill—very, very significant. There are 
good bills from the Indian Affairs Com-
mittee that I have participated in, 
water bills that we have been working 
on. 
But the one that I want to speak to 
a little more in detail this evening— 
and I was hoping that my ranking 
member, Senator MANCHIN, might be 
here on the floor, but not yet—but I 
wanted to speak about title Z in the 
omnibus bill. 
Z, I just imagine that they put it at 
the end because they figured it was the 
best or maybe because they knew that 
the process that the Energy Act had 
gone through had probably been more 
rigorous and lengthy than just about 
anything out there. But Z we are at. 
I begin my comments with regard to 
this Energy Act that is contained in 
this bill by acknowledging that I am 
probably speaking on the floor for the 
last time as the chairman of the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
because I have hit my limit, if you will. 
I have had the honor and the privilege 
to be both the chairman and the rank-
ing member on the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee now for a total 
of 12 years, which is pretty good. 
It is pretty good to be in a position 
to be able to advance legislative policy. 
I have been very, very fortunate to 
work with great members. Senator 
Bingaman was the chairman when I 
was his ranking and, of course, I was 
with Senator WYDEN as the ranking 
member when he was chairman. I have 
had the great privilege to work with 
Senator CANTWELL
when I was the 
chairman and now Senator MANCHIN. I 
think about these past 2 years and 
what we have been able to accomplish 
and just kind of the recap of where we 
have been and how productive we have 
been as a panel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7909 
December 21, 2020 
We started this Congress with pas-
sage of the John D. Dingell, Jr., Con-
servation, Management, and Recre-
ation Act. This is a bipartisan package 
of more than 120 different measures fo-
cused on public lands, natural re-
sources, and water. 
We had worked on a lands package 
throughout the last several months of 
2018. I want to give former Ranking 
Member CANTWELL a real big shout-out 
here because her leadership was very 
key in that process. We weren’t able to 
get it across the finish line at the end 
of the last Congress, but we reintro-
duced it in January of 2019. We passed 
it through the Senate in February, and 
the President signed it into law in 
March. That was a pretty good start— 
120 bipartisan bills. 
These were bills, when you think 
about it, that related to national 
parks, to forests, to sportsmen’s ac-
cess. We delivered on the Federal Gov-
ernment’s promises to Alaska Natives 
who served during the Vietnam war. 
We permanently reauthorized the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, and we 
provided new authorities to help pro-
tect from natural hazards such as vol-
canic eruptions. I will note that the 
Kilauea just erupted on the Big Island 
of Hawaii. I believe it was yesterday or 
the day before. So it is important to be 
addressing our natural hazards. 
We did that at the beginning of the 
Congress. Then Senator MANCHIN and I 
set our sights on something that hadn’t 
been done in a long time, and that was 
modernization of our Nation’s energy 
policies to make real reforms and bring 
them in line with our current chal-
lenges and our opportunities. So we 
started with some very broad—very 
broad-based—hearings and then took a 
very specific and deep dive into some of 
the issues and the technologies. 
Then we started moving bills. We 
were negotiating and we were reporting 
dozens of bills as part of our regular 
order committee process. Knowing how 
things work around here, we knew we 
weren’t going to be able to move them 
each individually as stand-alone bills, 
so we wrapped them up into a broader 
bill. We called it the American Energy 
Innovation Act. 
We brought that bill to the floor in 
February. We were going just great. We 
were working through, and it was kind 
of nice, again, to be the first bill on the 
floor when we began our legislative 
business. And we stalled out. We were 
interrupted. We were taken off the 
track by an unrelated dispute over a 
measure that is jurisdictional to an-
other committee, and this was just at 
the start of the global coronavirus pan-
demic. 
But I said: We are not done. We are 
not stopping just because we hit a 
roadblock here. We are going to keep 
working. 
We kept working. We kept working, 
and we kept looking for a way to pass 
the first major Energy bill since 2007— 
and 2007 is a long time that we hadn’t 
updated and reworked our energy pol-
icy, so it was worth working on. I kept 
saying: Don’t count us out. Don’t write 
us off. 
Over the past few months, we found 
that opening. We worked with really 
good partners over on the House side 
over at Energy and Commerce and the 
House Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, and we wrote what we have 
called simply the Energy Act of 2020— 
pretty simple, pretty beautiful, in my 
opinion. 
But our Energy Act is included now 
as division Z in the year-end omnibus. 
It provides for reforms and new au-
thorities related to a range of emerging 
technologies, including advanced nu-
clear; carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage; carbon removal; renewables; 
and energy storage. It reauthorizes 
programs that many of us are sup-
portive of and want to advance: Weath-
erization Assistance and ARPA-E. It 
features the bulk of my language re-
lated to critical minerals and mate-
rials to help us rebuild our domestic 
supply chains, which we know are so 
critical. It reflects our strong commit-
ment to cleaner energy to help us ad-
dress climate change without raising 
the cost of energy or imposing divisive 
mandates. 
So I would suggest to the Presiding 
Officer that this Energy bill is just the 
perfect bookend for this Congress. 
What started as a major lands package 
is now going to end with a major en-
ergy package. Again, as I mentioned, it 
has been since 2007. It is the first En-
ergy bill—the energy side of the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee—the first Energy bill in almost 
13 years. It was President George W. 
Bush who signed the last one on De-
cember 19, 2007. 
So I want to thank Ranking Member 
MANCHIN for his leadership on the en-
ergy package, as well as all of the com-
mittee members who contributed to it. 
We had great help within our com-
mittee. We had great help within this 
body. At last count we were looking at 
input and contributions from some 70 
different Members. 
I also want to acknowledge the ex-
traordinary work of the staffs. I had 
the opportunity to give a tribute to my 
staff director, Brian Hughes, who is 
leaving after many years on the com-
mittee. He did a fabulous job of advanc-
ing this, as did Spencer Nelson, Pat 
McCormick, 
Annie 
Hoefler, 
Lucy 
Murfitt. There were so many others. 
That team was extraordinary. 
But they were joined by an extraor-
dinary team that Senator MANCHIN 
had, led by his staff director, Renae 
Black, and other individuals there who 
really helped us advance this—Sam 
Fowler and so many. We can’t thank 
them enough. 
I also want to really give sincere 
thanks to our House partners because 
they were this ‘‘six corner’’ working 
group here: FRANK PALLONE, the chair-
man at Energy and Commerce and the 
ranking member, GREG WALDEN; the 
Science chairwoman, BERNICE JOHNSON, 
and 
the 
ranking 
member, 
FRANK 
LUCAS. We could not have reached an 
agreement without their leadership 
and their willingness to work together. 
I also want to acknowledge and 
thank Leader MCCONNELL and Senator 
SCHUMER for agreeing to work with us 
and help us secure this opening and 
this commitment. 
I can’t remember how many times 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
had 
said: 
You 
know, LISA, you are probably going to 
figure out a way to pull a rabbit out of 
the hat here. And I don’t know if this 
is a rabbit out of the hat, but I think 
persistence certainly has paid off. So I 
want to thank the teams who really 
helped to make this happen. 
In addition to a good energy bill, the 
year-end omnibus also includes the bi-
partisan water package featuring nine 
provisions that are important to West-
ern States, such as Colorado, Montana, 
and Arizona. Lane Dickson on my En-
ergy Committee staff was fabulous 
there. We added a few more lands bills 
into the final package. Lucy and Annie 
helped us on that. We really have 
worked to advance so much out of the 
committee. 
All of these accomplishments—our 
lands package, our energy package, our 
water package, the lands bills that we 
tried to add to everything that moved 
and occasionally passed by UC, and 
measures I haven’t spoken to, includ-
ing the Great American Outdoors Act— 
these are all the hallmarks of a highly 
productive Congress and the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee. I am pleased to have been able 
to shepherd these measures into law. 
But what I am proud of—more than 
any piece of legislation, more than 
anything out there in the time that I 
have been able to lead this committee, 
what I am most proud of is the bipar-
tisan way in which this committee has 
operated. Our commitment to biparti-
sanship has produced continually good 
results for our country. 
What I found as ranking member and 
now as chairman is that there is sim-
ply no substitute for working together 
and across party lines to find agree-
ment wherever it is possible. 
So I thank Senator MANCHIN for fol-
lowing that same approach, to our 
committee colleagues for their own bi-
partisanship and collegiality, to our 
House colleagues who have helped us 
with that. 
I see that my friend from the great 
State of Washington and Pacific North-
west is here, and I want Senator CANT-
WELL to know that as I have spoken of 
the accomplishments of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, I am 
very thankful and appreciative of her 
leadership and what she has provided 
over the years. Working together with 
her team, we have accomplished good 
things for the right reasons. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington is recognized. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, if I 
can just congratulate my colleague

from Alaska and the ranking member, 
Senator MANCHIN, for their great work 
of getting these energy provisions that 
have been—I don’t know how many 
Members, but I am sure just about 
every Member in our body has had 
something to do with it and a lot of ac-
tual individual legislation. So this was 
a long effort by our colleague, the 
chair of the committee, and I thank 
her for her diligence on this. She has 
had many of us up to Alaska to look at 
hydropower and alternative resources 
and 
how 
their 
grid 
needs 
better 
connectivity and products that can 
withstand and provide energy in sub-
zero weather and all sorts of challenges 
that they face. 
But, clearly, these tools that will be 
in this legislation will move us for-
ward. So thank you and thanks to Sen-
ator MANCHIN for working so diligently 
to get this finally over the goal line. It 
is a big moment. Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are 44. 
Upon reconsideration, the motion is 
agreed to. 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1964 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise and 
in a moment I will ask unanimous con-
sent to right a wrong that has lingered 
for over a century and to call up and 
pass H.R. 1964, the Lumbee Recognition 
Act. Prior to that, I want to say that I 
am honored, with my colleague Sen-
ator TILLIS, to represent the Lumbee 
people. 
The Lumbee are the largest Native 
American Tribe east of the Mississippi 
River, with a membership of over 
60,000. They have called the present- 
day counties of Robeson, Scotland, 
Hoke, and Cumberland their home in 
North Carolina. They have been a cohe-
sive part of the community in North 
Carolina for centuries, and they have 
developed unique Tribal instructions 
that have served their membership well 
in the face of extraordinary adversity. 
They have been teachers, farmers, 
doctors, small business owners, sher-
iffs, clerks of court, State legislators, 
and judges. Many have protected our 
Nation by serving in the Armed Forces. 
Their contribution to their commu-
nity, to the State of North Carolina, 
and to the country is innumerable. 
Their commitment to education is 
unparalleled. In the 1800s, the State au-
thorized the Tribe to run the State’s 
school district for Lumbee children. 
The State also authorized the opening 
of a specially advanced Indian school 
known as the Normal School to train 
teachers to teach in Lumbee Indian 
schools. Although the State provided 
no money for construction for the fa-
cilities, the Lumbees pulled together 
and constructed an Indian Normal 
School of their own. Since then, the In-
dian school has been in operation con-
tinuously. Today it is the University of 
North Carolina at Pembroke. 
The State of North Carolina recog-
nized the Lumbee Tribe in 1885. Three 
years later, the Tribe began its quest 
for full recognition. Over the next 50 
years, they repeatedly petitioned the 
Federal Government for assistance but 
to no avail. 
Then, during the height of the 
shameful termination era, Congress 
passed the Lumbee Act of 1956. This 
partial 
recognition 
designated 
the 
Lumbees residing in Robeson and ad-
joining counties of North Carolina as 
the ‘‘Lumbee Indians of North Caro-
lina,’’ while simultaneously blocking 
the Lumbees from accessing Federal 
services and benefits available to other 
federally recognized Tribes. It is noth-
ing short of discrimination. 
To put this in context, four other 
Tribes were terminated by Congress in 
1956, like the Lumbees. All have had 
their Federal recognition status re-
stored. Only the Lumbees have yet to 
receive the full Federal recognition 
they deserve. As a matter of fact, in 
2018, this Senate recognized Indian 
Tribes. In 2019, seven Tribes in Virginia 
were recognized by this Congress and 
this Senate. 
It is unfortunate while the Lumbee 
Tribe is incredibly resilient, decades of 
discrimination have caused severe eco-
nomic consequences for the people. 
Robeson is one of the poorest counties 
in the United States. The 1956 law has 
put them on an unequal footing com-
pared to other federally recognized 
Tribes and has prevented them from 
obtaining access to critical services 
through the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
and the Indian Health Service. This is 
simply unjust and it is immoral. 
To correct this injustice, since 1987, 
members of North Carolina’s congres-
sional delegation from both sides of the 
aisle have repeatedly come together to 
introduce the Lumbee Recognition Act, 
which would grant full Federal recogni-
tion to the Tribe. 
Over the past 11 years, I have been 
proud to be the lead sponsor of this leg-
islation in the Senate, and it has al-
ways been a bipartisan effort. 
This year, the bill was led by a 
Democratic Member of the House of 
Representatives, G. K. BUTTERFIELD, 
and supported by Congressman HUDSON 
and Congressman BISHOP, both Repub-
licans. Last month, the House passed 
the Lumbee Recognition bill by voice 
vote unanimously. Let me say that 
again—by voice vote unanimously. 
You would think that this great de-
liberative body could process and un-
derstand the—really the discrimination 
that is going on here to these folks. 
People claim that the Lumbees are not 
a Tribe. Yet read the statistics—it is 
the largest Tribe east of the Mississippi 
River. I think they finally educated the 
House. But despite the overwhelming 
support for doing the right thing, Con-
gress has yet to actually do it. 
The time for excuses is over. The 
time for action is now. It is time to fi-
nally do what should have been done 
130 years ago. It is time for the Federal 
Government to recognize the Lumbees 
for the Tribe they are. 
I have had a great partner in Senator 
TILLIS, and I would yield to him for 
any comments he would like to make. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator BURR for his leadership and 
leaning into this for many years before 
I even joined the Senate. 
I thank Senator Dole for filing this 
bill that actually even had Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
cosponsorship 
many, 
many years ago. 
I thank the Lumbee people for their 
patience, but, quite honestly, when you 
are talking about the ninth largest 
Tribe east of the Mississippi River—I 
am sorry—the ninth largest in the Na-
tion and the largest Tribe east of the 
Mississippi River, a Tribe that has been 
seeking recognition since 1888—they 
were recognized as Indian by the State 
of North Carolina in 1885. In 1956, they 
were partially recognized. 
We heard a unanimous vote coming 
out of the House. They were prepared 
to provide recognition. In November, 
we heard President Trump and Vice 
President Biden both say they support 
recognition. So we are so close. 
There is a compelling case. It is a 
century in the making. And the fact 
that we couldn’t get this through today 
when it passed unanimously out of the 
House just a month ago I think is a 
shame. 
I appreciate Senator BURR for his pa-
tience and his tenacity. We are not 
going to let this go. Hopefully, it gets 
done tonight, but we have to recognize 
that the Lumbee people deserve rec-
ognition, they deserve respect. They 
have been fighting for it for a century, 
and I am going to fight for it as long as 
I am in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my 
colleague, and I reiterate that if for 
some reason there is an objection—and 
I think there will be tonight—either 
before we swear in a new Congress or 
after we swear in a new Congress, I 
promise my colleagues that this place 
will come to a grinding halt, and we 
will take up through regular order the 
Lumbee Recognition Act. We will de-
bate it for as long as people want to, 
and we will make the case as to why 
this discrimination is despicable. 
So, at this time, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Indian Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 1964 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my 
colleagues for their time tonight, and I 
urge all of our colleagues to prepare. 
This will be back up. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the recognition. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on For-
eign Relations be discharged and the 
Senate proceed to the en bloc consider-
ation of the following nominations: 
PN1938, PN2024, PN2101, PN2030, and 
PN2025; that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate; that if con-
firmed, the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table en bloc and the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, first of all, let me 
say to my dear friend from New Jersey, 
I fully agree with the five nominees he 
has put in front of the Senate. Indeed, 
we had good confirmation hearings on 
all five of those, and none of these 
five—other than the one I am going to 
the talk about in a second—are polit-
ical appointments. These are career 
people who have had long and distin-
guished service with the Secretary of 
State, and they are all very legitimate 
appointees to the places they are ap-
pointed to, which I am going to reit-
erate here in just a minute. 
In any event, one was left off the list. 
I know Senator BOOKER
had some 
issues with that, but I think, in the 
spirit of cooperation and in the spirit 
of bipartisanship, he offers five, and I 
will offer a compromise of one more. I 
think that is absolutely fair—five for 
one. 
But I object, and indeed I would ask 
unanimous consent that we do as sug-
gested by Senator BOOKER, and that is 
discharge from the committee and ap-
prove the following six nominations: 
PN1938, Mr. Kevin Blackstone, Class of 
Minister-Counselor, to be Ambassador 
to the Democratic Republic of Timor- 
Leste; PN2024, Ms. Cynthia Kierscht, 
Class of Counselor, to be Ambassador 
to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania; 
PN2101, Mr. Brian D. McFeeters, Class 
of Minister-Counselor, to be Ambas-
sador to Malaysia; PN2025, the Honor-
able Geeta Pasi, Class of Career Min-
ister, to be Ambassador to the Federal 
Democratic 
Republic 
of 
Ethiopia; 
PN2030, the Honorable David Reimer, 
Class of Counselor, to be Ambassador 
to the Republic of Sierra Leone; and fi-
nally, William E. Todd, PN1598, to be 
Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan. 
As I said, none of these are political. 
They have all had long and distin-
guished careers with the State Depart-
ment. They all have great backgrounds 
to be Ambassadors, and I appreciate 
Senator BOOKER helping me move all 
six of these forward. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent 
that all six of those be discharged and 
be considered and passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the 
Senator so modify? 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I just 
want to say I appreciate my friend and 
my colleague, and truly, when he in-
voked the spirit of cooperation and the 
spirit of bipartisanship, I felt lucky 
that he didn’t invoke the spirit of 
Christmas as well. 
Mr. RISCH. I would like to amend. 
Mr. BOOKER. But I do want to let 
him know that, indeed, the five people 
are nonpolitical individuals with the 
State Department. I wish we could just 
move them and get confirmed. But I do 
have an objection to the sixth that he 
would seek to add, so I will not modify 
my request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
Mr. RISCH. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, it is 
good to see you in that seat, sir. The 
post of Ambassador to Pakistan is one 
that is highly relevant to American na-
tional securities, as I think all 100 of us 
understand. The person selected to im-
plement the U.S. foreign policy and en-
gage diplomatically with the Pakistani 
Government must be someone who un-
derstands that American-Pakistani re-
lationship and the complex and evolv-
ing challenges to regional stability in 
South Asia. That person must also be 
someone who can be trusted by the 
American people and by their col-
leagues at the State Department to 
carry out U.S. foreign policy decisions. 
Unfortunately, there is a disturbing 
and documented pattern of behavior 
from Mr. Todd that I believe makes 
him unqualified to serve as our Ambas-
sador to Pakistan. 
From 2017 to 2019, Mr. Todd served in 
a variety of management positions at 
the State Department, including as 
Acting Director General and Assistant 
Secretary for Human Resources and as 
Acting Under Secretary for Manage-
ment. 
During that time, the House Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and the Sen-
ate 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
opened investigations into allegations 
that senior State Department officials, 
including Mr. Todd, were engaging in 
prohibited personnel practices against 
other members of the State Depart-
ment’s career workforce. 
As a result of these investigations, 
multiple State Department officials 
told the committees that the adminis-
tration wanted to punish career offi-
cials at the State Department often for 
doing their jobs, for following proce-
dures and protocols, and also punish 
them for just raising concerns about 
policies that they believed sincerely 
would be dangerous or deleterious to 
American interests. 
Mr. Todd was one of the people polit-
ical appointees turned to to help carry 
out a lot of those actions. When asked 
about those allegations in the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was 
reported clearly that he was unreason-
ably agitated, even raising his voice 
when asked about just these routine 
issues. 
The incoming administration has an 
enormous task. We know the chal-
lenges in that region. In the entire 
State Department, there have been 
challenges as well. We should give that 
new administration a chance and not 
promote someone for what is a really 
critical ambassadorship in a very com-
plex and challenging region. We need 
to make sure that we have someone 
prominent in the role who can com-
mand the confidence of State Depart-
ment officials, and that, in many ways, 
gives the incoming administration a 
chance to deal with that vacancy, 
which has been, I will note, vacant for 
2 years without a nomination. 
He clearly does not have the tem-
perament or the track record of stand-
ing up for his own employees or for the 
institution of the State Department. 
We should be doing everything in our 
power to restore credibility to Amer-
ican leadership, not just overall in the 
world stage, which I know we all agree 
on, but also in that region, and work to 
repair a lot of the harm that this indi-
vidual may have been involved in cre-
ating that hurt morale so much. 
I have a lot of confidence in the 
chairman’s leadership. We have a com-
mittee that often works in a bipartisan 
manner, and I am grateful for that. It 
is one of the pleasures I have in serving 
in the Senate. This role is critical to 
the country—the U.S. Ambassador to 
Pakistan. Ambassador Hale left the 
post in September of 2018, and it was a 
year before the administration nomi-
nated someone to the post. So, again, I 
just find it, on top of my previous re-
marks, odd that the chairman and oth-
ers are now saying that we need this 
Ambassador now. I believe that is not 
the case, and I believe that there 
hasn’t been an urgency from the ad-
ministration to fill this ambassador-
ship until today. 
So it is for these reasons that I op-
pose Mr. Todd’s nomination, and I hope 
that my colleague will move the other 
five. They are deserving Foreign Serv-
ice officers and should be confirmed. 
They should not be held up because of 
objections to the nominee we have been 
discussing. 
So we agree on these five nominees. I 
truly urge my colleague that we should 
not obstruct them because of our dif-
ferences over one. There is a true ur-
gency, I believe, in this season to get 
what we can agree on done, and dis-
agreement rooted as substantially as I 
believe this one is should not hold up 
the other ones. That is why I think the 
nominees to Ethiopia, Mauritania, Ma-
laysia, and Sierra Leone—I do really 
believe 
they 
should 
be 
confirmed 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator BOOKER
for his kind words 
about the committee. I want to com-
mit that we will continue to work in a

bipartisan fashion. On the other hand, 
we have a disagreement here regarding 
this particular person. He is a well- 
qualified 
career 
State 
Department 
nominee. He has been nominated, of 
course, to be Ambassador of Pakistan. 
Ambassador Todd is a career member 
of senior executive service. He is well 
qualified to serve as the Ambassador. 
He is currently serving as the Deputy 
Under Secretary of State for Manage-
ment. He has a wealth of experience, 
having previously served as Ambas-
sador twice, to Cambodia and Brunei. 
His qualifications notwithstanding, 
now is really not the time to leave the 
ambassadorship and the mission in 
Islamabad vacant. 
The others we have are also good. I 
don’t think that it is unfair to ask that 
we have a trade of five for one. 
In any event, we respectfully dis-
agree at this point. I have no doubt, as 
we move forward, we will have other 
things we do agree on, but at this time, 
I am going to continue to object to the 
five. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss crit-
ical parts of today’s funding bill that is 
before us this week. These are the re-
sult of bipartisan work that we have 
done. And the Presiding Officer is a 
member of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, a valued member 
who has contributed significantly to 
the legislation before us. 
As chairman of that committee, I am 
so grateful for your participation be-
cause I am going to talk about some 
things that we have been able to do on 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee together and in a bipar-
tisan way. You have done such a re-
markable job with the Save Our Seas 
legislation, and we continue to support 
that. 
Now I am going to talk about a cou-
ple of additional things that are part of 
this end-of-the-year legislation that we 
will be voting on later this evening. 
The first is historic, bipartisan cli-
mate innovation legislation. The sec-
ond is comprehensive legislation to up-
grade America’s water infrastructure. 
So I want to talk about two different 
things: One is the climate innovation 
legislation and then what is commonly 
known as the WRDA bill, the Water 
Resources Development Act. Both of 
these measures passed the committee 
with unanimous bipartisan support. 
The Republicans and Democrats on 
this committee have worked together 
to reduce emissions and to do it 
through innovation—not taxation, not 
regulation, but do it through innova-
tion—free market innovation, not pun-
ishing government regulations. I be-
lieve that is the best way to go as we 
address the challenges of our environ-
ment and our climate. 
We have reached a historic agree-
ment in the committee, and we will on 
the floor tonight in the Senate, to in-
clude environmental innovation provi-
sions in this government funding bill. 
The environmental innovation agree-
ments include three specific bills that 
will significantly reduce greenhouse 
gases. I have had the privilege of work-
ing closely with my friend, the com-
mittee ranking member, TOM CARPER 
from Delaware, on each of these three. 
The first is called the USE IT Act. 
This legislation ensures that Wash-
ington is a willing partner in the re-
search and the development of carbon 
capture technologies and projects. Car-
bon capture holds the key to signifi-
cant carbon emission reductions. These 
captured emissions can be used to cre-
ate building materials, medical sup-
plies, even clothing. They can also be 
used to extract more natural resources 
to provide more energy for all of us. 
The USE IT Act is going to expedite 
permitting so that important carbon 
capture projects can get moving. It 
supports the research and the use of 
carbon capture. It includes direct air 
capture—actually, carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere—that will take carbon 
emissions straight out of the air. It is 
very innovative. 
This kind of research is now already 
happening in my home State of Wyo-
ming, in Gillette, WY, at the Inte-
grated Test Center, which is associated 
with the University of Wyoming School 
of Energy Resources. 
I have worked closely with Senators 
WHITEHOUSE and CAPITO and CARPER on 
the USE IT Act in having it passed, 
first, through our committee, then 
through the full Senate, and tonight, 
in a bill that will be ultimately sent to 
the President of the United States for 
his signature. 
The second measure, part of this in-
novative work, is a bill sponsored by 
Ranking Member CARPER to reauthor-
ize the Diesel Emissions Reduction 
Act. 
This program has already signifi-
cantly reduced the amount of black 
carbon in our air by replacing older en-
gines in buses—school buses and trucks 
and other vehicles. This is working 
well. These replacement engines make 
diesel equipment cleaner and more effi-
cient. 
The legislation that we will reau-
thorize this evening sees that this im-
portant program will then continue all 
the way through the end of 2024. 
The last element of our bipartisan 
agreement will phase down the use of 
chemicals 
known 
as 
HFCs. 
These 
chemicals are in every home in Amer-
ica, from cars to refrigerators to air 
conditioners. 
This agreement is going to authorize 
a 15-year phasedown on the production 
of these chemicals. Innovative break-
throughs in chemistry have led to the 
development of cleaner replacement 
chemicals. This legislation tonight will 
help protect our air while keeping 
costs down for the American people. 
Importantly, the agreement, the bi-
partisan agreement we have come up 
with, safeguards the essential use of 
HFC chemicals when substitute chemi-
cals are less effective. Some examples 
including bear spray. We use it in Wyo-
ming. I know they use it in Alaska. It 
protects hikers. It is also used in fire 
suppression systems on planes that 
protect travelers. And we need it. 
I know in my hometown of Casper, 
the defense spray manufacturer, the 
Safariland Group, employs about 75 
people. They use HFC chemicals to 
make defense sprays. It is a critically 
important part of their business. 
If they were forced to use replace-
ment chemicals, those sprays would be 
far less effective. Well, if you are 
around a bear, you want to make sure 
you have the most effective spray 
available. So with the changes we have 
negotiated into this important bill, 
companies like the Safariland Group 
will be able to continue making high- 
quality products that people want and 
people need and that can save their 
lives. 
We also made sure that the manufac-
turers using these chemicals have a 
clear set of rules to go by—one clear 
set of rules to go by. So our agreement 
preempts State and local laws to en-
sure that the specific essentials that 
are being used are protected. 
Now the manufacturers won’t have to 
deal with different sets of rules in dif-
ferent States, which has been a real 
problem. This clears that up. The end 
result is clean air and clear rules. We 
need both of those. 
I really want to thank Ranking Mem-
ber CARPER, Senator JOHN KENNEDY of 
Louisiana for working with me to 
reach an agreement that will reduce 
the use of HFC chemicals while pro-
tecting consumers and manufacturers 
alike. 
All of these three measures support 
market innovation. All three will re-
duce greenhouse gases, and they will do 
it in ways that will not harm the econ-
omy. 
The government funding bill that we 
are going to be addressing a little later 
this evening also includes bipartisan 
water 
infrastructure 
legislation. 
I 
know in the Presiding Officer’s home 
State of Alaska and in my home State 
of Wyoming, water is critical, as it is 
across the entire country. But you and 
I have focused specifically on this. 
Certainly, in Wyoming, dams, levees, 
ports, reservoirs, and water systems 
are important to every community all 
across the country. The infrastructure 
is critical. People say the word is ‘‘in-
frastructure,’’ but when we think about 
it, what it really means is dams, ports, 
reservoirs, levees, and water systems. 
That really, I think, shows more what 
we are talking about than just this 
overall word ‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
It protects all of us from dangerous 
floods and storms, while also providing 
water for our families and our farms. 
The government spending bill to-
night includes the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 2020. It is the result 
of months of negotiations between 
committee leaders from the Senate and 
the House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7914 
December 21, 2020 
The bipartisan legislation is fiscally 
responsible. It helps grow the economy; 
it cuts redtape; and it makes our com-
munities safer. It will spur economic 
growth by creating jobs and by author-
izing vital projects. 
In my home State of Wyoming and 
across the Rocky Mountain West, ac-
cess to consistent water supply is es-
sential for ranchers and farmers. The 
water that we need in our home States 
to grow crops and raise cattle has to be 
delivered on time. 
In several communities, the water 
reservoirs 
that 
serve 
farmers 
and 
ranchers happen to be old. These aging 
reservoirs and irrigation systems need 
maintenance or full rebuilding. This 
bill makes these projects a significant 
priority. 
The legislation will also establish a 
new Army Corps of Engineers program 
for construction of new, small water 
storage projects or the expansion of ex-
isting ones. It will also authorize the 
Army Corps of Engineers to carry out 
sediment removal projects in water 
reservoirs. This improves water qual-
ity, and it increases water quantity. 
The bill authorizes projects to main-
tain shipping lanes, to deepen ports, to 
upgrade aging dams, and to increase 
water storage across the West. Main-
tained 
shipping 
lanes 
ensure 
that 
American-made goods are shipped from 
the heartland to the coasts and around 
the world. Deepened ports result in in-
creased commerce. If our major ports 
are dredged and deep, then more ships 
can use them to export more goods. 
These projects that we are getting 
ready to adopt tonight will all create 
jobs and expand commerce in Amer-
ica’s cities and the heartland. To en-
sure these important projects get mov-
ing, the bill cuts redtape to speed up 
the Army Corps of Engineers’ process. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act is going to expedite the permit-
ting, the construction, the repair, and 
the maintenance of many Army Corps 
projects. Communities can’t afford to 
wait years and years for flood manage-
ment or water storage projects to be 
completed. They need them now. 
Finally, this legislation will make 
communities safer. The critical infra-
structure projects included here will 
help prevent damaging floods by main-
taining dams and levees. Floods can 
take a terrible toll in property damage 
and on human life. 
The legislation allows the Army 
Corps of Engineers to focus efforts on 
fixing aging flood management infra-
structure. It prioritizes the dams and 
levees most at risk. 
I would like to really thank the 
House Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture 
Committee 
chairman, 
PETER 
DEFAZIO, and the ranking member, 
SAM GRAVES, for working with us to 
get this legislation to the finish line. 
I want to thank Infrastructure Sub-
committee Chair CAPITO and Ranking 
Member CARDIN for their work as well. 
I say to the Presiding Officer, as I 
wrap this up and thank you for your in-
volvement, I want to thank every 
member of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, and specifically the 
ranking member, TOM CARPER—whose 
staff has worked so closely with mine— 
for working with me on this bill. I am 
so grateful for his partnership as we 
have worked together over the last 4 
years as I served as chair and he served 
as ranking member. We have not al-
ways agreed on every issue, but we 
have respected the positions of each of 
us. We have worked and found common 
ground, found solutions, and I believe 
made a real difference for the economy 
and, most importantly here, the envi-
ronment. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
DAINES). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CYBER SECURITY 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express concern over a monu-
mental breach to the Nation’s national 
security infrastructure. 
Last week, the Washington Post, 
among other publications, reported 
hacks of several government agencies 
by way of the SolarWinds platform 
over several months. 
The New York Times, on the 17th of 
this month, had a headline that in-
cluded these words: ‘‘Officials Warn of 
‘Grave Risk.’ ’’ But in that report, the 
New York Times indicated that at 
least 40 companies, government agen-
cies, and think tanks had been infil-
trated. The infiltrated agencies include 
the Departments of Defense, State, 
Homeland Security, Treasury, Com-
merce, Energy, and Energy’s National 
Nuclear Security Administration, as 
well as the National Institutes of 
Health. That is about seven different 
entities, if you include the Department 
of Energy as one entity, in the hacking 
of different parts of the Department, 
and there could be more. 
All the reporting indicates that the 
hackers are affiliated with Russian in-
telligence. Russia has proven itself 
both capable and willing to invade and 
exploit our digital infrastructure for 
its own ends. 
While 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Mike 
Pompeo confirmed that Russia was be-
hind this damaging breach of our sys-
tems, 
President 
Trump 
is 
casting 
doubt—and that might be an under-
statement. 
Even in the waning days of his ad-
ministration, our national security 
continues to suffer at the hands of the 
President’s 
deference 
to 
Vladimir 
Putin. 
I have to say for the record, I hope 
this number changes, but only about 10 
Republican Senators have expressed 
concerns. I hope that number grows ex-
ponentially in the next couple of days. 
I have to ask: What if this breach oc-
curred under a Democratic President— 
President Obama, for example? Would 
there be more than 10 statements or 11 
or 12? This should be categorically, 
roundly condemned by every U.S. Sen-
ator of either party. 
These hacks renew the urgency for 
additional 
resources 
for 
defensive 
cyber security across our government. 
This need is not a new one. In fact, the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency, known as CISA, C-I-S-A, 
was stood up within the Department of 
Homeland Security in 2018 precisely to 
shore up the U.S. Government’s de-
fenses against such hacks, such intru-
sions. 
However, as we all know, just days 
after the 2020 Presidential election, 
President Trump fired CISA’s Director, 
Chris Krebs, for contradicting the 
President’s own false claims regarding 
the election. 
The President has failed to take this 
hack, this attack on our security, this 
attack on our government seriously. 
This hack raises serious questions 
about the nature of cyber espionage 
and what constitutes hostile acts by 
another country. 
These are questions I look forward to 
exploring as we learn more about the 
scope and nature of this latest breach. 
While both of our countries certainly 
engage in espionage, we must be vigi-
lant in the protection of our own data 
and technology from foreign inter-
ference, and we need to hear more from 
Senators on both sides of the aisle 
about this attack. 
The second and related issue is the 
reporting just in the last day or so, re-
ports that the President may be seek-
ing to invoke the Insurrection Act to 
impose martial law and refuse to step 
down from the Presidency next month. 
The reporting indicates that these dis-
cussions took place in the Oval Office. 
I would argue—I think most Ameri-
cans would argue—that even the mere 
discussion of martial law, the mere 
mention of it, the mere invocation of 
the whole notion of martial law is both 
harmful and dangerous. 
Republican Senators, so far, have not 
condemned these actions that bla-
tantly 
violate 
democratic 
norms. 
Maybe one, maybe two—I hope that 
number grows as well—but the silence 
from the majority party in the Senate 
on this report is deafening. I would 
hope that every Senator would roundly 
condemn the mere mention of martial 
law. 
Attempting to seize election ma-
chines—that would be the effect of the 
invocation of martial law if it were 
operationalized—election machines in 
a number of States seized by the gov-
ernment of the United States. 
I have got to ask the question: In 
America? In the United States of 
America? Is that what the White House 
is really discussing? 
All that America expects—and it is 
not much—is that Senators of both 
parties would condemn, in the strong-
est possible terms, even the discussion 
of martial law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7915 
December 21, 2020 
The Army Secretary and the Army 
Chief of Staff released a joint state-
ment clarifying, based on these dan-
gerous actions proposed by the Presi-
dent’s team, that ‘‘there is no role for 
the U.S. military in determining the 
outcome of an American election.’’ 
It is hard to believe that those offi-
cials in our government who help de-
fend our country would even have to 
say that based upon what the reporting 
indicates. 
So I hope that, even in this holiday 
season, it is made very clear by every 
Member of the U.S. Senate that this 
will not be tolerated and has to be con-
demned. We can’t just say: Oh, well, it 
is another outrage, another insult. It 
should be condemned, just like the ac-
tions 
of 
the 
Russian 
Government 
should be condemned as well. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I just 
want to make a couple of brief com-
ments about the legislation we are 
going to be voting on, we hope, to-
night. 
I will talk about, for purposes of 
time, not the spending bill or the 
spending portion, the so-called omni-
bus. I will talk about the COVID–19 re-
lief provisions. I won’t go through all 
of them, obviously, but there is a lot of 
good news for many Americans in this 
legislation. 
The 
consensus 
on 
unemployment 
benefits will help a lot of Americans: 
$300 per week for all Americans receiv-
ing unemployment benefits through 
March 14. The Pandemic Unemploy-
ment Assistance Program is extended 
to help self-employed individuals, gig 
workers, and others in nontraditional 
employment. 
The economic impact payments for 
Americans across the country: $600 for 
individuals making up to $75,000 a year 
and $1,200 for couples making up to 
$150,000 per year, as well as a $600 pay-
ment for each dependent child. That 
means a family of four would receive 
$2,400 in direct payments. 
The Paycheck Protection Program, 
so-called PPP: $284 billion for the first 
and second PPP forgivable loans. 
There is more money for transpor-
tation, more money for health, and, in 
particular, money for the procurement 
of vaccines and therapeutics, as well as 
money for vaccine distribution. 
Education is funded for more than $80 
billion; emergency rental assistance, 
$25 billion; the Postal Service, $10 bil-
lion; childcare, $10 billion—both very 
important. 
The ones I am especially grateful for, 
even though on a lot of these I would 
vote for higher numbers—a lot of us 
would—are the nutrition provisions: 
$26 billion in agriculture and nutrition 
funding. Half of that will be used for di-
rect payments to farmers who have suf-
fered losses due to the impact of the 
pandemic. The remaining 13, the other 
half of the 26—$13 billion will be used 
to combat food insecurity, which is on 
the rise due to the economic impact of 
the pandemic. 
There is a lot in here that is positive 
for American families, for workers, for 
small businesses, and for so many 
other needs. It took way too long. This 
is months overdue. There are gaps in 
it. 
I think this is a 3-month bill to help 
folks get through January, February, 
and March. I think we will need an-
other bill after that. And, obviously, I 
am very disappointed we don’t have 
dollars in here to help nursing homes, 
which I fought very hard for. We will 
keep up that fight. 
It doesn’t have the direct help to 
State and local governments, even 
though there are provisions that will 
help States but not nearly enough. 
So it is far, far from perfect, but I 
think it is important that we pass it to 
provide direct help to people who have 
challenges, whether it is with employ-
ment or running a small business or 
supporting their families. 
The last point I will make on this is 
that we gather here today—and we 
hope the vote will be tonight before 
midnight, but we don’t know. But it is 
just ironic that today is the 21st of De-
cember, the winter solstice, the dark-
est day of the year. 
I was noting this weekend Elizabeth 
Dias wrote an op-ed, a very thoughtful 
op-ed, in the New York Times about 
winter and all of the ways different 
cultures have dealt with the darkness 
and the severity of winter. But here is 
what she says, and I hope it provides a 
context for what we are about to pass 
and what we must do in the months 
ahead when the virus is still raging and 
the death number keeps climbing. Here 
is what Elizabeth Dias says: 
The great irony of winter is that the mo-
ment darkness is greatest is also the mo-
ment light is about to return. Each year the 
winter solstice comes with the promise that 
the next day will be brighter. 
In this season of hope and this holi-
day season, we hope and we pray that 
this legislation will bring some light to 
people’s lives, that it will give them a 
sense, in addition to having a vaccine 
available now, that brighter days are 
ahead. 
We can’t underestimate the darkness 
that has engulfed so many families, but 
we hope tonight that we provide at 
least a measure of light to all the dark-
ness that so many families have faced. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to engage in a col-
loquy with my friend and colleague 
from the State of Delaware, TOM CAR-
PER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
have just recently been talking about a 
number of pieces of legislation that 
have come through the Environment 
and Public Works Committee: the 
water resources act, the USE IT Act, 
the act called DERA to eliminate and 
reduce emissions from diesels, as well 
as additional legislation on HFCs. 
My partner in all of those is here on 
the floor now, and I would just like to 
ask him if he would—since he has been 
such a great partner for the last 4 years 
that I have chaired the committee— 
talk about this as an accomplishment 
for the environment, for the com-
mittee, and for the Senate and for the 
country. 
So I am just kind of curious, from his 
standpoint, where he sees things as a 
sign of success. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if my 
colleague will yield. 
As Senator CASEY leaves, I thought 
his point about longest night and every 
day that follows will be brighter, and 
some of the provisions that Senator 
BARRASSO
and I, along with JOHN 
NEELY KENNEDY, have included in the 
Nation’s major budget piece of legisla-
tion ensure that it will be brighter. 
One of the pieces of legislation, as 
Senator BARRASSO knows, deals with 
the 
phasedown 
of 
HFCs, 
hydrofluorocarbons. 
They 
are 
1,000 
times worse for climate change than 
carbon dioxide. Under the legislation 
that we have offered, it will phase 
down their utilization over the next 15 
years by 85 percent. What is that 
worth? It is worth a half a degree Cel-
sius—just this one thing, just this one 
provision. 
A lot of people on this planet think 
the biggest challenge that we face on 
this planet right now, an existential 
threat, is the fact that our planet is 
getting warmer and that we need to do 
something about it. In this legislation, 
we do take a big bite out of it. 
And my hope is what it will be is that 
it will serve as a source of encourage-
ment for other Democrats and Repub-
licans, maybe an Independent or two, 
to take other steps as we come back 
into the new year with the new admin-
istration and make further progress. 
One of the great things that I love 
about our HFC legislation—thanks, 
colleague. 
One of the great things, Mr. Chair-
man, that I love about our HFC legisla-
tion is that it shows that you can do 
good things for our planet and create 
jobs. That is what I said: do good 
things for our planet in the battle 
against climate change and create jobs. 
How many jobs? Tens of thousands of 
jobs—in this country, in this country; 
billions of dollars’ worth of economic 
growth—in this country—and at the 
same time doing good things with re-
spect to climate change. 
Interestingly, it is not every day you 
find legislation supported by the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, most 
major environmental groups, and co-
sponsored by, gosh, two-thirds of the 
Senate—Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
alike.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7916 
December 21, 2020 
In that case, we have done it. We 
threaded the needle. I just want to 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
and for his patience and the staff in 
working with us. And our thanks to 
Rich Russell, your staff leader on the 
majority side; Mary Frances Repko, 
the staff leader on our side; and every-
body who worked with her. 
But more than a decade ago, I re-
member standing next to my colleague 
JOHN BARRASSO—I remember standing 
right over close to where he is standing 
tonight, and a guy named George 
Voinovich came up to me—from Ohio. 
He and I had been Governors together 
for a number of years. Love the guy. 
He said: I am looking for a Demo-
cratic cosponsor for a bill. He said: Do 
you want to think about it? I said: 
Well, what is it? He said: It is a pro-
posal that fosters collaboration be-
tween businesses, folks who have buses 
with diesel engines, trains with diesel 
engines, boats with diesel engines, 
trucks with diesel engines; and it uses 
some Federal money, some government 
money, in order to use technology that 
is available to reduce the emissions 
from those diesel engines by more than 
80 percent. 
I said: Tell me more. And he told me 
more, and about a day or two later we 
signed on and introduced the legisla-
tion. He was kind enough to let me be 
his Democratic lead. 
One month later, it was enacted. I 
have been here 20 years; I have never 
seen legislation with that kind of effect 
go through just like that. It was pretty 
amazing. Every so often, we reauthor-
ize it; we increase the authorization. 
We have done it again with respect to 
reauthorizing the Diesel Emission Re-
duction Act. 
One of the things I love about it is 
that it gets a lot of different stake-
holders involved, and for a limited 
amount of Federal dollars, we can have 
a multiplier effect that can be, for 
every Federal dollar, $5, $6, $7, $8 that 
have come in from the private sector. 
That is the way we ought to do it. 
The last one is USE IT. Not many 
people think Delaware is a farm State, 
but we raise a ton of chickens. I think 
for every person in my State, there are 
like 300 chickens or more. Those chick-
ens eat corn and soybeans. We raise 
corn and soybeans. Our farmers have 
land that is close to the beach. We have 
five-star beaches in Delaware: Reho-
both, Bethany, Dewey, and others. 
There is always pressure for develop-
ment and encroachment on our farms, 
and developers are trying to buy out 
the farmers and pave paradise and put 
up a parking lot. What we have figured 
out how to do is—and it is not just—we 
haven’t figured out through this legis-
lation, the so-called USE IT Act, but 
what we do is—the idea is to take car-
bon out of the air and to use it for a 
better purpose. 
One of those better purposes is to re-
plenish the soil in my State, in Wyo-
ming, in Montana, and other places so 
that our farmers will be less inclined to 
leave the land. They will stay on the 
land. They will be able to make money, 
support themselves and their families. 
It creates a virtuous cycle. That is a 
wonderful thing. 
I don’t think we are going to be 
joined here yet—I called him just to 
give him a heads-up, but I don’t think 
he is able to get here that quickly, but 
JOHN NEELY KENNEDY from Louisiana 
was a big part of the work we did on 
HFCs. I just want to say, in his ab-
sence, a real big thank-you to him. I 
want to thank—gosh, I think 70-plus 
Senators—Democrats and Republicans 
alike—who cosponsored our HFC bill. I 
want to thank our leadership, espe-
cially on our side but on both sides, for 
pushing to make sure these three bills 
would be included in the final com-
promise. 
In addition to all the other things 
that were accomplished—and Senator 
CASEY and others talked about that— 
we have actually done some good 
things for our planet. Senator BAR-
RASSO is going to move over and be the 
senior Republican on the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee come 
January. I will remain on Environment 
and Public Works, be the senior Demo-
crat. I want to say that this has been a 
wonderful partnership, just a wonderful 
partnership—fun, funny, serious when 
we had to be, collegial, and really fo-
cused on getting things done for Wyo-
ming, for Delaware, for the other 48 
States as well. 
So you are not going to be too far, 
and I will still be around. We will have 
a chance to work on other things. It 
has been a real joy to work with you on 
these three items, and hopefully in the 
future we will have many, many more. 
Mr. BARRASSO. I thank Senator 
CARPER. I appreciate it. 
You know, it is interesting: Senator 
ALEXANDER recently gave his speech, 
his farewell address, and he said that 
sometimes politics is like a split- 
screen television set. On the one half, 
you see all the fighting and contention 
and the dysfunctional side. And on the 
other side of the screen, you see the 
functioning side. But not many people 
look at that functioning side. 
What we have been able to do as a 
partnership on the Environment and 
Public Works Committee was func-
tional—in a bipartisan way, coming up 
with solutions. As you mentioned, 
there were over 70 cosponsors on the 
one piece of legislation. All of them, I 
think, got through the committee 
unanimously. That is something that 
made no news because there wasn’t a 
fight. There was cooperation for the 
betterment—to make sure we protected 
the economy and, at the same time, 
preserved the environment. That is 
what we need do: Continue to make 
sure that we can protect both and con-
tinue with economic development as 
well as environmental stewardship for 
our Nation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor tonight to talk about 
many provisions that are currently 
moving their way through the House of 
Representatives and on our way to us. 
Obviously, our colleagues here are, I 
think, relieved that we have been able 
to give relief to the American people; 
that is, that we have been able to ex-
tend unemployment benefits and add 
bonuses to those unemployment bene-
fits in the amount of 300 extra dollars 
per week, and we have been able to ex-
pand the COBRA tax credit programs 
to help people who have been unem-
ployed and not been able to continue 
their insurance be able to continue 
health insurance. This is very impor-
tant for laid-off workers in the State of 
Washington, like the aerospace work-
ers. 
We are very glad that we were able to 
give a stimulus check of $600 per indi-
vidual and $1,200 for married couples; 
that we were able to get the PPP pro-
gram that helps small businesses so 
that they can continue to try to make 
ends meet as we continue to work our 
way through this pandemic; and that 
we have been able to give $9 billion to 
healthcare workers who are stretched 
so thin on these battle lines, who need 
every support that we can give them. 
I want to talk about the rental as-
sistance. We are at a point where, if we 
didn’t act tonight, if we didn’t act be-
fore we left here, many more people 
were going to be without homes. It is 
so important for us to have these pro-
visions and programs like SNAP, the 
additional money for broadband, for 
healthcare, and for other things that 
are essential in helping to commu-
nicate during this pandemic for both 
healthcare and for education. 
I also wanted to mention work that 
was done in tandem with this legisla-
tion, specifically on the affordable 
housing tax credit. The affordable 
housing tax credit was always impor-
tant. Affordable housing was always 
important, but in a pandemic, in a 
COVID crisis, it becomes even more 
important. The affordable housing tax 
credit 
is 
something 
that 
Senator 
YOUNG and I worked on with Senator 
WYDEN and Senator Isakson, and we 
wanted to say that we needed to do 
more than what our current Tax Code 
could do in helping build more afford-
able housing. 
The affordable housing tax credit has 
provisions that have been in law since 
1986, but, actually, using the tax cred-
its and how they worked have been a 
fluctuating rate, so the consequence is 
that the historic rate of what people 
could get to use the tax credit has 
changed, and this legislation will put a 
floor of 4 percent in to give investors a

bigger idea of what this investment can 
do for the market. 
We believe that it will add, in the 
State of Washington, more housing 
that is needed immediately, more 
housing that is needed on the national 
basis, and help us stabilize things in 
the near term so that we can work on 
affordable housing and how we can put 
more incentives for people to build af-
fordable housing. 
People 
know 
affordable 
housing 
doesn’t just get built. People don’t just 
go out and say: I am going to build 
housing at this low rate. 
The tax credit is a tax credit that 
helps people do it by giving those bor-
rowers the ability to work with the tax 
credit. But the American people have 
been greatly impacted by so many 
trends—baby boomers reaching retire-
ment age, not being able to save, peo-
ple being pushed out of the last eco-
nomic 
crisis 
into 
a 
rate 
of 
unaffordability. It really has been a 
dramatic increase. 
According to the Hudson Institute, 60 
percent of our affordable and low-cost 
housing was lost from the housing 
stock between 1985 and 2013. That is the 
housing that we had that was afford-
able. Basically, the time period ends, 
and they end up being swallowed up, 
like so many places in Puget Sound, 
into 
market-based 
rates. 
Literally, 
people are pushed out of their housing, 
and then there is no other affordable 
housing in the region. 
These tax credits can help us build 
more affordable housing for the long 
run. Over the next decade, nearly 
500,000 low-income housing tax credit 
unions and 655 other subsidized units 
will reach the end of their affordability 
period. Just like I was saying, they are 
going to get to a point where they are 
no longer in a protection of affordable 
housing, and the consequence is that 
growth and demand are pushing us 
even higher. 
For example, seniors—10,000 baby 
boomers retire each day. That means 
that those low-income seniors, those 
woefully inadequate to pay for increas-
ing housing costs, are going to be grow-
ing every single day and putting more 
demand on the system. 
For veterans, nearly 2.5 million older 
veteran households—almost a quarter 
of men and women who helped protect 
our country—are cost-burdened. That 
means they spend more than 30 percent 
of their income on housing. The lack of 
affordable housing in our country has 
been a longstanding crisis, but the 
COVID crisis has made it much worse. 
One in five renters is behind on their 
rent, and the eviction moratorium ex-
pires in less than 2 weeks. 
As I said, I am pleased that we are 
voting tonight, hopefully, on this legis-
lation that includes a 1-month eviction 
moratorium and $25 billion for rental 
assistance and that we will continue to 
work on these issues. And I am glad 
that we are working on the passage of 
not just the low-income housing tax 
credit fix of a 4-percent floor but also 
that we will continue to work across 
the aisle on this legislation moving 
forward. 
At a minimum, the 4 percent could 
increase affordable housing production 
by at least 130,000 affordable homes 
over the next decade. That is critically 
important—130,000 
more 
affordable 
homes over the next decade. It could 
generate and help us with job growth— 
162,000 jobs and about $18 billion in 
wages and impacts to the economy. 
Building more affordable housing 
helps us solve lots of problems. We 
have an increase in demand, as I just 
articulated, and a COVID crisis. Invest-
ing in affordable housing is very good 
for us in helping our economy grow and 
putting a roof over people’s heads. 
I would also like to mention as part 
of the small business package, the Pay-
check Protection package, a provision 
that was supported by so many of our 
colleagues to help make sure that we 
continue to get local news and infor-
mation out to the public. People under-
stand that local news has been threat-
ened ever since the transition to an in-
formation age and has certainly been 
challenged by what I think are unfair 
practices by tech companies and the 
compensation for material and proper 
reimbursement on advertising. 
The issue for us is that COVID has 
created an environment where we abso-
lutely need to get the news, and we ab-
solutely need to get the local news. It 
is imperative that we do what we can 
in this legislation to help small news-
papers, small broadcasters, small radio 
stations that didn’t previously get 
helped in the last COVID package so 
they can continue to communicate im-
portant local news to people through-
out the United States. 
I want to thank Senators SCHUMER, 
CARDIN, and, obviously, I want to 
thank specifically Senator BOOZMAN 
for working so hard on this legislation 
with me and introducing legislation. I 
want to thank Senators KLOBUCHAR, 
ERNST, and many of our other col-
leagues who signed on to that legisla-
tion, as well as our House colleagues, 
Representatives 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
CICILLINE
and SENSENBRENNER, who 
also worked hard on getting this provi-
sion 
in, 
and 
Senators 
RUBIO
and 
MCCONNELL for helping us in this proc-
ess. 
These provisions are important to 
help make sure that large public insti-
tutions, like the University of Wash-
ington and others, continue to also get 
information out to the public. 
This news information and local in-
formation isn’t going to go away with 
the help and support of this bill, but it 
may be a lifeline in helping us continue 
to make sure we have critical public 
health information available to the 
public at all times, and, hopefully, we 
will then go on to really understand 
what has happened to local news and 
information and do something in the 
future Congress to help fix the inequi-
ties that are existing today. 
If I could, I also just mention quickly 
the issue about broadband. This legis-
lation that we are going to be voting 
on 
includes 
$7 
billion 
for 
more 
broadband priorities, $1 billion for 
connectivity issues for Tribal country. 
I know, as the Presiding Officer knows, 
that Indian Country needs a lot of 
connectivity. 
So 
getting 
more 
broadband into those communities will 
be very helpful. 
The COVID package also contains 
money, additional funding, that I know 
Senator WICKER and others worked on 
for telehealth. Telehealth is a critical 
path during the COVID crisis to make 
sure communities have the ability to 
get expert advice into our homes, into 
our communities, to connect people 
with information. 
This telehealth grant is a very im-
portant program in the State of Wash-
ington. I think we probably got some-
thing like $8 million previously from 
telehealth, and this will help us con-
tinue. 
I am disappointed that we did not in-
clude priorities in here for the E-rate 
program to help close the homework 
gap. This is something Senator MAR-
KEY and others worked on very hard, 
and it is very disappointing that we 
can’t come to an agreement on some-
thing as important as E-rate. This leg-
islation 
provides 
the 
ability 
for 
hotspots for people who may be going 
to college and not going to classes, but 
are in or around a university. 
I think that is a good idea, but we 
were prohibited from doing the same 
thing for students at the K–12 level. 
One thing the pandemic has shown us 
is that students are at home and need 
to be able to connect to stay connected 
to their education schedule, to do their 
homework, and to be part of the edu-
cation system. I hope that we will ad-
dress this inequity in the bill in the fu-
ture. 
I am pleased that, working with Sen-
ator WICKER, we were able include lan-
guage that gives the Federal Trade 
Commission new authority to seek 
civil penalties for scams and deceptive 
practices related to the COVID pan-
demic. You probably think this is al-
ready something that was on the 
books, but in reality, the way the Fed-
eral Trade Commission has operated, 
they had to give a warning first, al-
most like a cease and desist. The next 
thing you know, the same practice 
would pop up over here, with somebody 
making a claim about how safe their 
product was or how this would stop 
COVID or something of that nature. 
In my home State alone, the FTC re-
ports 
that 
consumers 
have 
been 
scammed out of nearly $5 million since 
the pandemic and the number is over 
$200 million nationwide. These scams 
can range in everything from straight-
forward identity theft to making all 
sorts of accusations on people during 
the quarantine period. 
I want to thank Senator WICKER for 
working with us on this important leg-
islation. Now the FTC will be able to 
go after and find these people on first-

time offenses. I think this is so impor-
tant to do to make sure that we are po-
licing an environment where public 
health is so important. 
I also want to thank Representative 
SCHAKOWSKY for leading this effort on 
the other side of the Capitol. 
I also want to talk about very impor-
tant aviation legislation that we were 
able to include as part of the larger 
omnibus 
package 
that 
is 
moving 
through the House, as I said, tonight. 
It is so important that we make safe-
ty a No. 1 priority in the United States. 
If we want to be No. 1 in aviation, we 
have to be No. 1 in aviation safety. 
Chairman WICKER and I worked with 
our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to produce important legislation 
that improves the safety reforms need-
ed at the FAA—the safety reforms of 
oversight of manufacturing and the 
certification process, and reforms that 
will help us here in Congress better 
stay on top of the information as far as 
the certification process. 
This is so critical after the crash of 
the Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian Flight 
302, both involving Boeing 737 Max air-
crafts and the loss of 346 lives. 
I can never say how painful this inci-
dent has been for those families. I can 
never say how much they have suffered 
in this horrific tragedy that has be-
fallen them, but I know that these re-
forms are what are needed, and their 
help and support in passing this legis-
lation has been critical. 
I want to thank all of the families 
who helped us in communicating why 
the safety reforms are important, but I 
want to thank, particularly, Michael 
Stumo and his wife, Nadia Milleron, 
who lost their daughter Samya Stumo 
in the Ethiopian air crash, and to let 
them know that, even though we are 
putting a big down payment on safety 
reforms in the U.S. Congress by passing 
this legislation, this process does not 
stop with the passage of this legisla-
tion. 
We need to continue to do more to 
improve aviation safety and to con-
tinue to act, even on a global basis, to 
be leaders—the United States leading 
the way on what aviation safety needs 
to be. 
I also want to thank our staff: Doug 
Anderson, Ronce Almond, David Mar-
tin, 
Laurence 
Wildgoose, 
Jonathan 
Hale, Melissa Porter, and David Strick-
land for their work. And on the other 
side of the aisle: Mike Reynolds, James 
Mazol, Simone Perez, MaryAsa Eng-
land, and John Keyes. 
Many Members participated in the 
formation of this legislation. I want to 
thank Senator DUCKWORTH
for her 
work with us on the NTSB rec-
ommendations and flight deck alert 
system, which were part of this pack-
age of bills to reform the FAA and the 
FAA process. 
I want to thank Senator MORAN for 
his focus on helping us build those 
standards that we are talking about as 
far as the FAA going to ICAO and say-
ing: These are the continued standards 
for improvement in aviation safety. 
I want to thank Senator BLUNT for 
his leadership on the Air Grants Pro-
gram, a very important program that 
we think will help build up the exper-
tise and knowledge of very, very tech-
nical subject certification for people 
here throughout the process of over-
sight and legislating and the executive 
branch. 
I want to thank Senators CRUZ and 
BLUMENTHAL for working on such crit-
ical elements in the legislation as to 
how the certification process itself 
works and what we needed to do to 
continue to bolster it. 
Tonight, we are sitting one step clos-
er to reforms that really will be mean-
ingful. It will return the FAA to being 
in charge of what are the oversight 
members of manufacturers who are 
doing the work of the certification 
process. It is clear that the individuals 
who are part of this unit report to the 
FAA. They are supervised by the FAA. 
You can no longer have incentives at 
the FAA for expediting work. You, ba-
sically, now have a new whistleblower 
protection, thanks to my colleague 
Senator WICKER
and his incredible 
work on this legislation. You have bet-
ter accountability on misconduct. You 
create new safety reporting standards 
for the FAA employees. 
We repeal authorities that would per-
mit a certification by industry. That 
industry could continue to make rec-
ommendations about the certification 
process is something, in specific provi-
sions, that are repealed here. 
We also prohibit interference with 
FAA designees. That is, no one can try 
to influence a manager or someone di-
rectly involved in the certification of 
the process. We also tried to make sure 
the process itself worked better. And, 
again, many of my colleagues played 
critical roles in this. 
On required safety system analysis 
on any plane coming through the proc-
ess—whether it was new or a deriva-
tive—you still have to do a safety sys-
tem analysis. You have to have regula-
tions that are the most up-to-date as it 
relates to making sure you comply, as 
we said in this legislation, with the 
NTSB recommendations on flight crew 
alert systems and to mandate a safety 
management system for manufactur-
ers. This is something that is long 
overdue. And in some instances, people 
said: Oh, the OMB and executive 
branch don’t think we need to do these 
things. Oh, these things are cost pro-
hibitive. These are regulations we 
don’t need to put in place. 
Trust me, having a safety manage-
ment system is essential, and we 
should make sure that this is in place 
as this legislation requires within the 
next few years. 
This legislation also requires disclo-
sure of safety critical information. 
This was something, as I said, our col-
leagues, 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL
and 
CRUZ and many others, worked on as 
part of this legislation. 
It also provides expert teams of pan-
els. At the beginning of any kind of 
certification process, the FAA will be 
assisted by the best experts in avia-
tion, whether they come from NASA or 
the Air Force or outside individuals 
who understand the latest and greatest 
technology. Why do we have that? Be-
cause we know that we are in an era of 
unbelievable technological change in 
which now the human interface with 
technology is so critical. Whether you 
are going to be in driverless cars or 
whether you are in Amtrak with posi-
tive train control or you are in the 
flight deck of an airplane and the soft-
ware that is working with it, we need 
to understand how people are going to 
respond to human factors. 
We all get frustrated with our own 
computers and our own software, but 
we need to put safety first when it 
comes to a pilot interacting with that 
software in the cockpit of an airplane. 
It also helps us make sure that the 
process for the certification appeals 
are strengthened and that we tighten 
the process. We need to listen to the 
engineers on the ground. The engineers 
are telling us what we need to do, and 
we need to listen to them. I hope that 
the leaders, both within manufacturing 
and the FAA, will do that. 
As I mentioned, this legislation es-
tablishes a National Air Grant Pro-
gram. Some of you can think of it here 
on Capitol Hill as similar to the Sea 
Grant Program, a program that was 
long-established to give us technical 
expertise on OSHA and maritime issues 
here in Congress. We want the same 
thing for aviation to exist. 
It is too important of a sector and 
safety is too important to not have a 
technical skill set here that can stay 
on top and replace individuals as re-
tirements happen throughout the avia-
tion system. 
It requires disclosures to Congress of 
post-crash assessments. If the FAA 
goes and investigates a crash, you have 
to notify Congress of that information. 
Why? We want to stay more on top of 
that information. It requires an identi-
fication of safety trends. I have no 
doubt that we are going to hear—when 
it comes back as these annual reports 
for the next several years—that this 
issue of human interaction in a tech-
nology cockpit is going to continue to 
be the largest safety trend issue, just 
as it is going to be in the automotive 
area and just as it is going to be in 
transportation. 
Those are just some of the highlights 
of a very comprehensive safety reform 
legislation. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator WICKER for his help, his leader-
ship, his most recent report on whistle-
blower activity, and helping us get this 
legislation over the goal line. 
I also, as I said, want to thank, 
again, those families. Our hearts and 
sympathies are still every day with 
you as you continue to face moving 
forward. We are not going to forget. We 
are going to continue to put safety as 
the biggest priority for us here in the 
U.S. Congress and continue to move

December 21, 2020 
forward on a process that puts the indi-
vidual engineers on the line responsible 
for safety to make sure everyone con-
tinues to listen to their directives and 
their recommendations. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
REMEMBERING ALLAN WEBER 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise out 
of respect and in memory of Gove 
County 
Sheriff 
Allan 
Weber, 
who 
served his community faithfully over 
the last two decades. 
Allan was born and raised on his fam-
ily’s farm near Park, KS, and he went 
on to marry Connie, his high school 
sweetheart. The couple has three chil-
dren—Andrea, Brandon, and Cory. To 
those who know Allan, it was always 
clear that his family meant everything 
to him. His many grandchildren were 
his pride and joy. 
In 1996, he ran for Gove County sher-
iff and served his community faithfully 
for over two decades since first elected. 
Gove County is out in Western Kansas. 
It is flat. It is the prairie. It is windy. 
It is hot in the summer and cold in the 
winter. It is farmers and ranchers. It is 
often a struggle to earn a living in 
Gove County. I know the county well. 
Despite those challenges, it is made up 
of people who work hard, care for each 
other, and try to make good lives for 
themselves and their families. 
In rural areas like Gove County, the 
sheriff oftentimes wears multiple hats, 
and Sheriff Weber was no different. In 
addition to serving as sheriff, he was 
also the public information officer and 
the emergency operations center com-
munity liaison. 
Kansans also never fail to step up to 
help their neighbors in hard times, and 
Allan did the same. After the tragic 
death of a neighboring county’s sheriff, 
he stepped up to serve as the interim 
sheriff in Sheridan County, making 
him the first person ever to serve two 
counties as sheriff at the same time—a 
first in Kansas’s history. He saw his 
brothers and sisters in blue as an ex-
tended part of his family, and he held 
them in the highest regard. 
His colleague in law enforcement, 
Sheriff Tim Morse of Jackson County, 
which is on the other side of the State, 
wrote this: 
Kansas has lost a great sheriff. Gove Coun-
ty Sheriff Allan Weber has spent the last 
couple of months fighting COVID–19 in a 
Denver hospital. Today, Sheriff Weber was 
escorted back to Gove County by Colorado 
and Kansas Highway Patrols along with 
countless Kansas Sheriffs and law enforce-
ment officers for one last time . . . Sheriff 
Weber was an honorable man who was re-
spected by all. He will be greatly missed. 
He respected those in blue, and those 
in blue respected him. 
He was a dedicated public servant 
both in his home community and at 
the State level. He served the Kansas 
Sheriffs’ Association on its board and 
as its president. I talked to the Kansas 
Sheriffs’ Association today, and they 
wanted me to recognize Sheriff Weber’s 
professionalism and his dedication and 
that he served as president of the Asso-
ciation for two consecutive terms, 
which is a rare circumstance and 
speaks to his effectiveness in the role 
and the admiration that his colleagues 
held for him. 
His community also loved and re-
spected him. They came together to 
welcome him home one last time with 
an honor parade down Highway 212, in 
Quinter, this past Saturday night, with 
hundreds of cars and people lined up to 
recognize his service and sacrifice over 
a lifetime. 
Connie, his wife, said: 
It was such a beautiful homecoming. I 
know he was bursting with pride and love. 
After the November election, when he woke 
up in the intensive care unit, I told him he 
was sheriff for the next 4 years, and he gave 
me a small smile and nodded his head. He 
loved the Gove County community’s mind 
and was always ready to give the ultimate 
sacrifice if he had to. There were times that 
his heart broke doing his job, but he did 
what was right. He lived life day-to-day and 
enjoyed it and everyone. He worked hard and 
loved gently. He will be missed by many. 
The outpouring of love, support, and 
shared memories on their Quinter Com-
munity Facebook page has been con-
stant and speaks to the interconnect-
edness of a small community. 
I should tell you that the population 
of Gove County is about 2,612, and the 
county seat of Gove has a population of 
70. It is in places like Quinter, like 
Gove, and like Gove County where the 
sheriff is known by everyone, and the 
sheriff is interwoven into the life of the 
community and the county. 
So many of his friends and family 
have remarked on Allan’s contagious 
smile, how ornery he was, but, most 
importantly, as to the selfless way he 
served people. Those of us in public 
service ought to look to Allan as a role 
model in that selfless service of others. 
Sheriff Allan Weber embodied so many 
values in Kansas—faith, family, fellow-
ship, service, and good old-fashioned 
hard work. He will be missed by many. 
Robba and I extend our deepest sym-
pathies to his family—both his loved 
ones, which includes one of my staff 
members, Chelsey Ladd, his cousin, and 
his brothers and sisters in blue. 
May God bless Allan Weber. May we 
praise him for the life he lived, and 
may we look to him as a role model to 
try to do what he has done. 
I offer my condolences and respect, 
on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to the 
family of Sheriff Allan Weber. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEN-
NEDY). The Senator from Maine. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, later 
tonight, the Senate will vote on com-
prehensive legislation to fund the gov-
ernment throughout the remainder of 
fiscal year 2021 and to provide addi-
tional, long-overdue funding to address 
the ongoing emergency needs of our 
country during the persistent COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
I am proud to have helped lead a bi-
partisan, bicameral coalition that lit-
erally worked night and day to develop 
a commonsense plan that provided the 
foundation for this final agreement. 
There are many important compo-
nents of the package before us, includ-
ing assistance for struggling families; 
additional funding for testing, vaccine 
distribution, and healthcare providers; 
resources to help our schools operate 
safely in a COVID environment; and 
aid for the Postal Service and for air-
lines, airports, mass transit, and motor 
coach companies that keep our country 
moving. 
I come to the floor tonight, however, 
to focus on one aspect of the agree-
ment, and that is the extension and ex-
pansion of the Paycheck Protection 
Program, better known as PPP. 
As the Presiding Officer well knows, 
the PPP has been a critical lifeline for 
more than 5 million small employers, 
at one point helping to sustain the jobs 
of upwards of 50 million Americans. It 
was one of the most successful pro-
grams in the CARES Act. It was so suc-
cessful that it went through the initial 
allotment of money in just 13 days, and 
then we had to pass additional legisla-
tion replenishing it. 
In the State of Maine, the PPP has 
provided nearly $2.3 billion in forgiv-
able loans to 28,000 small businesses— 
that is 3 out of 4 of the small busi-
nesses in my State—and has helped 
sustain more than 250,000 jobs. 
In its original form, the program pro-
vided one-time loans sufficient to sup-
port 8 weeks of payroll, plus a limited 
amount to help cover certain overhead 
expenses. All of this was completely 
forgivable as long as the borrowers re-
tained and paid their employees and 
kept within the other parameters of 
the program. Our whole purpose was to 
help our small businesses save jobs and 
pay their workers, keeping the em-
ployer-employee relationship alive so 
that they could reopen and Americans 
could quickly return to work when the 
pandemic subsided. 
When Chairman MARCO RUBIO and I, 
together with Senators BEN CARDIN and 
JEANNE SHAHEEN, put the PPP together 
at the onset of the national emergency, 
none of us could have imagined that 
the pandemic would still be forcing 
shutdowns and curtailing operations 
and that extreme mitigation measures 
would be necessary these many months 
later. Yet, sadly, the virus is still 
spreading, and many of the steps taken 
to fight it, although they may be nec-
essary to protect public health, threat-
en catastrophic damage to many of our 
small businesses and their employees— 
small businesses that have now spent 
their PPP loan funds but are still un-
able to return to normal operations. 
I talked with a restaurant owner in 
Bangor, ME, where I live, who told me 
that he, because of the size of his res-
taurant and to comply with the public 
health spacing and social distancing 
guidelines, can only have four tables a 
night. Because the Governor of Maine 
has imposed a 9 p.m. curfew, he can’t 
turn over those tables to compensate

for the reduced number of people he 
can serve at one time. It is so tough, 
and I could hear the pain in his voice 
when he talked about having to lay off 
some of his longstanding staff in order 
to just stay alive. 
That is why the $284.5 billion pro-
vided in this bill to extend and expand 
the PPP is so vital. The program im-
provements in this bill are the result of 
months of work on the part of Chair-
man RUBIO, Ranking Member CARDIN, 
Senator SHAHEEN, and myself. I am 
pleased to see that so much of the Con-
tinuing the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram Act that Chairman RUBIO and I 
introduced this fall is reflected in this 
final bill. 
The final bill also reflects the very 
hard work that our bipartisan, bi-
cameral coalition put into assistance 
to small business. Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN
and I had countless meetings, 
Zooms, and phone calls to work out the 
details in conjunction with the rest of 
the members of our group. 
I would like to take a moment to 
outline a few of the key features that 
are included in this package. 
First, the bill will allow the hardest 
hit small businesses to receive a second 
forgivable PPP loan. To ensure that as-
sistance is targeted to those most in 
need, eligibility for these second loans 
is generally limited to small businesses 
with 300 or fewer employees that have 
seen their gross revenues drop by 25 
percent in some quarter this year com-
pared to an identical quarter in 2019. 
Second, recognizing the severe im-
pact that the COVID–19 mitigation 
measures have had on our restaurants 
and hotels, the bill maintains the gen-
eral terms for the loans for these enti-
ties but with an important enhance-
ment. The maximum forgivable loan 
size for hotels and restaurants is in-
creased to 3.5 times their average 
monthly payroll costs compared to 2.5 
times for other borrowers. This in-
crease in the loan amount will be so 
critical to the very survival of busi-
nesses like Simones’ Hot Dog Stand 
and Restaurant in Lewiston, ME, and 
the 
Angler’s 
Family 
Seafood 
Res-
taurant, which has locations in Hamp-
den, Searsport, and Newport. These 
small businesses all received forgivable 
PPP loans during the first round, but, 
faced with continuing dining restric-
tions and a long, cold winter, they are 
really worried about their survival and 
about being able to retain and pay 
their valued employees. 
Third, forgivable expenses under the 
program are expanded in very common-
sense ways. Supplier costs and invest-
ments in facility modifications and 
personal protective equipment needed 
to operate safely during the pandemic 
will now be part of the forgivable over-
head expenses. This is especially im-
portant to restaurants struggling to 
adapt dining restrictions or to get a 
high-quality 
food 
supply 
because, 
through no fault of their own, they 
have fallen behind on their bills. 
Fourth, the bill extends the PPP to 
small 501(c)(6) organizations that are 
not lobbying groups and that have 300 
or fewer employees, such as local 
chambers of commerce and economic 
development organizations. 
Fifth—and I want to give credit to 
our colleague Senator CRAMER for this 
concept—the bill greatly simplifies the 
loan forgiveness process for small bor-
rowers with loans of no more than 
$150,000 and directs the Small Business 
Administration and the Treasury De-
partment to develop a simplified loan 
forgiveness form for these borrowers. I 
remember when the first form came 
out and it was 14 pages long and so 
complicated that you would need an 
advanced degree in economics or a CPA 
to help you figure it out, even if you 
had a very small loan. 
The bill, to guard against fraud and 
abuse, also provides the SBA with $50 
million in additional audit funding. 
Finally, the bill sets aside funding 
for smaller businesses and borrowers in 
underserved communities to ensure 
that they get the help they need 
through, for example, CDFIs and mi-
nority business associations and depos-
itory institutions. It also includes $25 
million for the Minority Business De-
velopment Agency. 
Mr. President, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program is the result of a bipar-
tisan commitment to support our small 
businesses and their employees, to 
keep them afloat, the businesses afloat, 
and the employees paid during this 
pandemic. It has been by any measure 
a tremendous success, but many of 
these hardest hit small businesses re-
quire more help now in order to sur-
vive, and this bill aims to provide that 
help. 
Before I close, I want to talk briefly 
about another provision of the bill, and 
that is the grant assistance provided 
for live venues, museums, and movie 
theaters. Let me make clear that I sup-
port funding for our community-based 
live venues. I know they have really 
been hurt. They have had to cancel 
their seasons. They have lost all their 
ticket revenues. They are in real dan-
ger. 
I have enjoyed these throughout 
Maine, like the Ogunquit Playhouse 
and the Center Theater for the Per-
forming Arts in Dover-Foxcroft. They 
are the heart and soul of our smaller 
communities. 
I was disappointed to see that the 
final bill had stripped provisions from 
our bipartisan, bicameral group that 
we included in our package to try to 
keep the focus of these grants on these 
smaller entities. Specifically, our pro-
posal would have limited the grant 
amounts that related entities could re-
ceive to no more than $10 million and 
excluded museums with endowments 
larger than $75 million—commonsense 
safeguards. Now, I do appreciate that 
the legislation sets aside $2 billion for 
entities with 50 employees or fewer, 
but I am concerned that, as drafted, 
many venues and museums with sig-
nificant endowments and other re-
sources could be the largest bene-
ficiaries of this section because of the 
safeguards that were stripped out by 
the negotiators. 
For example, a museum in New York 
City, say, with a billion-dollar endow-
ment could receive an outright grant 
as long as the museum has an audito-
rium and meets the other eligibility re-
quirements. That surely does not seem 
like an appropriate use of taxpayer dol-
lars to me and was clearly designed to 
help large city venues that will survive 
without our help. 
Nevertheless, I am pleased to support 
this package. This COVID relief is vi-
tally needed for our struggling fami-
lies, for our hard-hit small businesses, 
for our challenged schools, for our 
stressed healthcare system, to promote 
the distribution of the vaccine and 
more testing, and to help our over-
whelmed Postal Service. I urge support 
for the package. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
YEAR-END ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
with the Senate poised to complete 
some major business for the country 
and wrap up a most unusual year, I 
want to express some gratitude to the 
men and women behind the scenes who 
make our work possible. 
Passing a historic rescue package 
and a full-year funding bill would be a 
serious undertaking even in ordinary 
circumstances. And, of course, this 
pandemic year has brought anything 
but ordinary circumstances to the Sen-
ate, just like everywhere else. 
For about 10 months and counting, 
COVID–19 has imposed new challenges 
on hundreds of people who are already 
plenty busy enough. 
After much of the Senate worked re-
motely in April, we came back to work 
in early May—like the essential insti-
tution that we are. Month after month, 
we have taken smart and careful pre-
cautions and remained an exemplary 
safe workplace. All along, we have not 
just continued to govern but completed 
landmark confirmations and historic 
legislation for the American people. 
None of this would have been possible 
without many people beyond the 100 of 
us with our names on these desks. 
I want to thank the Office of the Sec-
retary of the Senate, led by Julie 
Adams and Mary Suit Jones. This team 
encompasses everyone from the tal-
ented professionals who sit on the dais 
to the Official Reporters of Debate, to 
Disbursing and many other offices. 
Thanks to our Parliamentarian, Eliz-
abeth 
MacDonough, 
who 
faithfully 
calls the balls and strikes. She won the 
admiration of our temporary presider, 
Chief Justice Roberts, before we re-
claimed her as the Senate’s own. 
Thanks also to Senate Sergeant At 
Arms—Mike 
Stenger 
and 
Jennifer

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7921 
December 21, 2020 
Hemingway and their whole team, from 
the doorkeepers to the IT team that 
stood up enormous telework capabili-
ties almost overnight, to the workers 
who clean offices, move furniture, and 
keep this place running in hundreds of 
ways. 
Our Architect of the Capitol, Brett 
Blanton, assumed his role just before 
the pandemic hit. He never missed a 
beat. His team tackled cleaning in a 
way that exceeded industry standards, 
reconceived the food services, and, 
again, physically kept the Capitol 
functioning. 
Of course, very special thanks are 
due to our Attending Physician, Dr. 
Brian Monahan, and the entire team he 
leads. Believe me, they already had a 
full-time job caring for Members of 
Congress and the Supreme Court. We 
have leaned on Dr. Monahan in count-
less ways all year long. His expertise 
and wise counsel have been a credit to 
the Senate throughout the pandemic. 
Here in the Chamber, I want to thank 
our cloakroom teams, led by Gary 
Myrick on the Democratic side and 
Robert Duncan on ours. Duncan had 
only just stepped into his current role 
when the crisis began to unfold. He 
navigated about 10 years’ worth of big 
challenges in his first 10 months in the 
top job. Thanks to him and his capable 
deputy, Chris Tuck. 
Another key group these past months 
has been our Rules Committee, led by 
Chairman BLUNT and his staff director, 
Fitzhugh Elder. The committee has run 
point on coordinating many of the 
changes 
and 
adaptions 
that 
have 
helped keep this body safe. They have 
done 
an 
outstanding 
job 
without 
enough recognition or thanks. 
We are grateful to the men and 
women of the Capitol Police, led by 
Chief Steven Sund, who have stood 
their posts even when most of the rest 
of us have worked remotely. They have 
stood strong during this pandemic, dur-
ing protests both peaceful and other-
wise, and during the other daily oper-
ations that they handle with courage 
and professionalism. 
Across the board, I want to thank all 
of our Senate staff. Both the smaller 
footprint who have continued phys-
ically working at the Capitol and those 
who kept up their hard work remotely 
have confronted all kinds of novel chal-
lenges. Our institution and our country 
are grateful to you all. 
Last but not least, I want to thank 
my own team. My personal office, led 
by departing chief of staff Phil Maxson, 
has fought every day for Kentuckians’ 
needs and priorities throughout this 
crisis. Our State offices, steered by 
Terry Carmack, kept us connected to 
our constituents in new ways. My com-
munications director, Robert, Steurer, 
and all their colleagues who staff these 
operations are invaluable to me and to 
Kentucky. 
Here in the Capitol, my leadership 
staff has given an incredible amount of 
themselves to me, to our team, and to 
the Senate the entire year. 
Remember, this is somehow still the 
same calendar year that began with an 
impeachment trial, continued through 
the CARES Act, other major legisla-
tion over the summer, a Supreme 
Court vacancy and confirmation this 
fall, and finally the all-out legislative 
sprint since Thanksgiving. 
First, my two deputy chiefs of staff. 
Stef Muchow runs our operations in an 
incredibly historically complex time to 
handle operations. She has worn about 
10 different hats all year long—as 
usual. Scott Raab handles policy. He 
has led his colleagues through a legis-
lative year like no other, from mam-
moth negotiations and historic rescue 
packages to our most particular prior-
ities and everything in between. We 
have all leaned on Scott heavily, and 
he has been indispensable. 
Beneath them, within our operation, 
are a lot of talented folks I am lucky 
to have. I want to name them very 
briefly. 
My chief counsel, Andrew Ferguson, 
offers brilliant advice, from impeach-
ment to policy to the judiciary. 
Robert Karem, my defense policy ex-
pert, has brought critical institutional 
leadership as 2020 tested everything 
from national security to continuity of 
government. 
Jane Lee handles her massive port-
folio—and more besides—with incred-
ible effectiveness and calm under fire, 
and she sings the best Christmas carols 
in the office. 
Terry Van Doren is a policy master 
who delivers for Kentucky and the 
country every time. 
Erica Suares and Jim Neill are expert 
liaisons and advisers who keep me con-
nected inside the Senate and beyond. 
Steve Donaldson has been my point 
man for all things election law during 
this election year. 
John Chapuis is a seasoned Senate 
veteran who picked quite the time to 
join our team and cover economic pol-
icy. 
Jody Wright fights to get good people 
in good positions with good cheer. 
Andy Quinn is a master of words and 
ideas. 
David Popp heads my press team. He, 
Doug Andres, Scott Sloofman, and 
their whole operation keep my message 
and the Republican conference’s mes-
sage front and center. 
Sarah Steinberg manages my days, 
and Alex Jenkins manages my office— 
both with great humor and even great-
er professionalism. 
Moon Sulfab keeps our technology 
systems running and our spirits high. 
I have to mention our healthcare ex-
pert Jen Kuskowski, who worked re-
motely this spring while expecting her 
baby boy and has been cheering us on 
while on maternity leave. We can’t 
wait to get her back. 
Thanks to Grace Graham and Peter 
Oppenheim, whom Senator ALEXANDER 
generously shared from his HELP Com-
mittee staff to help us in Jen’s absence. 
Rounding out our leadership team 
are crack researchers Robert Utsey and 
David Hauptmann; skilled communica-
tors Dylan Vorbach, Valerie Chicola, 
Suzanne Youngblood, Emily Hauck, 
and Katherine Grayson. 
Our frontline troops, the jacks-of-all- 
trades who keep everybody in line, are 
Victoria Mason, Elise Stebick, and 
Spencer Abraham. 
Finally, at the head of this entire 
team is our fearless leader, our chief of 
staff, Sharon Soderstrom. Everybody 
on Capitol Hill and everybody in Wash-
ington knows that Sharon is one of the 
smartest, most dedicated, and most ef-
fective staff leaders working at any 
level in any branch of government. She 
is my first call and my last call on 
every subject. She was in the leader’s 
office before I was. She supported both 
Trent Lott and Bill Frist. So I count 
my blessings on a daily basis that I am 
lucky No. 3. Sharon bears the weight of 
the world on her shoulders and not 
only delivers but somehow prioritizes 
lightening everybody else’s load while 
she is at it—a walking master class in 
leadership. 
I am proud of all that we have ac-
complished for the country in this 
challenging year, and I couldn’t be 
gladder to be heading into 2021 with 
these talented professionals at my side. 
So I thank them, Mr. President. I 
thank them, one and all.

ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair lays before the Senate the fol-
lowing message from the House: 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Resolved, that the House agree to the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 
133) entitled ‘‘An Act to promote economic 
partnership and cooperation between the 
United States and Mexico,’’ with an amend-
ment to the Senate amendment. 
MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I move to concur 
in the House amendment to the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 133. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is pending. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that there be 60 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided between the lead-
ers or their designees; and that fol-
lowing the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the motion to 
concur without further motions or 
amendments in order and that 60 af-
firmative votes be required to adopt 
the motion to concur. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. HOEVEN. North Dakota is an en-
ergy powerhouse, and our late-night 
producers work around the clock to en-
sure homes and businesses in the Mid-
west have affordable and reliable ac-
cess to power when it is needed most. 
But the PTC, the wind production tax 
credit, 
is 
creating 
artificially 
low 
prices in markets for power generation. 
Qualified wind projects are receiving 
up to 21⁄2 cents per kilowatt hour from 
the taxpayer. These subsidies distort 
the market and are forcing out the 
critical coal-fired baseload generation 
we need to keep the lights on. 
Since Congress established a wind 
production tax credit in 1992, wind 
power has been able to transition from 
an emerging technology to a multibil-
lion-dollar industry that is clearly 
commercially viable. That is why we 
worked on a bipartisan agreement in 
2015 to phase down and sunset the wind 
tax credit at the end of 2019. 
We had an agreement to do the 
phaseout, and the wind industry agreed 
to it. I worked with Senator THUNE and 
AWEA, the American Wind Energy As-
sociation, and others to do it. And they 
agreed. We had an agreement. That is 
why we are opposed to extending the 
PTC and offer an amendment to strike 
it. 
We saw what happened in California 
over the summer, and we can’t afford 
to have blackouts and brownouts dur-
ing the coldest of winter weather 
months. We, instead, must strengthen 
grid resiliency and reliability by keep-
ing diverse sources of generation avail-
able at all times, including when the 
wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t 
shining. That means baseload. 
Instead of extending the production 
tax credit, we should be working on 
making technologies like carbon cap-
ture and sequestration commercially 
viable. 
The American Wind Energy Associa-
tion states on its website that ‘‘growth 
in the wind industry is expected to re-
main strong when the PTC is fully 
phased out.’’ Why, then, are we consid-
ering another extension of this credit 
when the leading trade association ex-
pects to see strong growth for the wind 
industry without the credit? 
We need to bring back a level playing 
field for competition in our electricity 
markets and reverse the trend of tax-
payers continuing to subsidize a ma-
ture, multibillion-dollar wind industry. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and ensure that the wind 
production tax credit sunsets. 
With that, I would like to ask for 
some words from my cosponsor on the 
amendment, Senator CRAMER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise to 
join my colleague Senator HOEVEN in 
offering this amendment and urging 
our colleagues to support the amend-
ment to strip the wind protection tax 
credit from this massive bill. 
I feel like I am living in an episode of 
the ‘‘Twilight Zone,’’ and I wish I could 
say that I am surprised. But I am not, 
because here we go again. Despite nu-
merous requests and appeals and deals 
with the leader and the chairman of 
the Finance Committee to not jam this 
body with a 13th extension of the wind 
protection tax credit, here we are with 
another one in front of us. 
Since the credit’s inception in 1992— 
and for a lot of those years I was a util-
ity 
regulator—it 
has 
always 
been 
promised that it would be temporary 
and would expire. Last year, we got 
jammed at the last minute with an-
other extension, and, rightfully, the 
people back home are really, really 
upset with us. And it didn’t sit very 
well with me either. 
That is why, in April of this year, I 
led a letter to Leader MCCONNELL with 
colleagues from West Virginia, Wyo-
ming, and Georgia saying it was time 
to finally level the playing field and 
get rid of this market-distorting atroc-
ity. 
In July, I led another letter to Chair-
man GRASSLEY with even more col-
leagues—from 
West 
Virginia, 
Wyo-
ming, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Penn-
sylvania—with the same message: Let 
this credit expire. 
Yet here we are again. The requests 
have fallen on deaf ears, and we have 
simply been given another pill to swal-
low with the extension today. 
Some in this town have pointed to an 
extension in carbon sequestration cred-
its like 45Q and 48A, as if they were an 
equal trade. They are not. Despite 
years of pleading, the Treasury Depart-
ment—yes, 
this 
Treasury 
Depart-
ment—still has not finalized regula-
tions. So an extension of 45Q is moot if 
there is no way to actually monetize 
the credit. 
Of equal importance, financial inves-
tors have said if renewable credits are 
extended, they will absorb whatever 
tax appetite exists because they are 
predictable, and those deals have been 
done many times. 
Just to reiterate, they can’t even uti-
lize 45Q because Treasury hasn’t fin-
ished the regulations 3 years after Con-
gress expanded the credit. 
More to the point, while there are 
some great proposed carbon sequestra-
tion projects planned in North Dakota, 
their benefit is targeted, while in con-
trast, hundreds of miners and the local 
communities they have built are being 
hurt by the extension of the production 
tax credit. I strongly support carbon 
sequester projects, but to assume that 
the potential benefits of 45Q or 48A are 
equal to the unilateral harm of the 
wind credit is disingenuous at best. 
I have heard from utilities who actu-
ally use the wind PTC, but they said 
they don’t need it because the market 
is so awash with wind credits, they 
can’t even monetize them. It is com-
pletely upside down. In fact, the PTC 
credits are actually taking money 
away from other clean energy projects 
like nuclear clean coal, taking emis-
sions-free energy right off the grid. 
Just a few days ago, POLITICO said 
this: The simplest option for tax ex-
tenders would be to let all 33 that are 
scheduled to expire at the end of the 
year to be renewed. 
I have a simpler plan. Let them all 
expire. K Street wouldn’t like it, but it 
would be one less section in this giant 
package. 
One final point, in all of my time in 
Congress—and that has been 8 years

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7923 
December 21, 2020 
now—the wind production tax credit 
has never been extended through reg-
ular order or an open discussion or 
even hearings. Despite our objections 
or promises from the wind industry 
that it should expire, in the 11th hour 
with the government shutdown loom-
ing, it gets dropped into the Members’ 
laps. That alone should be a red flag 
that the only time it has enough 
chance to pass is when it rides the 
coattails of our national defense and 
the 
government 
operations. 
It 
is 
shameful. 
I support the amendment from Sen-
ator HOEVEN, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it as well. Let the wind PTC 
expire. 
I yield my time. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague Senator CRAMER and turn 
to my colleague Senator LANKFORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
will be brief. I did what many of us did 
today. 
We 
spent 
the 
day 
digging 
through a 5,600-page bill, trying to find 
out what is in it. We broke it up into 
hundreds of pages of chunks and sepa-
rated it among our staff and just start-
ed reading through it as quickly as we 
could, trying to be able to pull out the 
details. 
We found a lot of things that we real-
ly like. We found a few surprises as 
well. So help us, we found, right in the 
middle of the document on tax policy, 
a zombie—the wind production tax 
credit. Something that we had heard 
had died—in fact, something that we 
had heard died 2 years ago; in fact, 
something that we had heard died 6 
years ago when all of us agreed it 
should die. In fact, the plan was to 
take it down a little bit each and every 
year until it finally got to zero. The 
problem was, when it got to zero, some 
lobbyist helped somebody get it back 
in last year, and it suddenly, after 
going to zero, reappeared. And then, so 
help me, it reappeared again. 
So this temporary credit that dis-
torts 
the 
market, 
that 
literally 
changes the prices in all of our en-
ergy—whether that be oil or gas or coal 
or solar or hydroelectric or nuclear— 
gives a special perk to one, and all of 
the rest of them get furious. But for 
whatever reason, this simple credit 
can’t seem to go away. 
When we agree to something, we 
should probably stick to it, and we 
agreed years ago to phase this out. But 
yet this zombie keeps reappearing and 
walking the halls of the Senate. 
Our simple challenge is this. Let’s 
put this zombie in the daylight. Let’s 
have the real argument over it and de-
termine: Is this distorting the energy 
market for everybody else, including 
all of our renewables? Is it something 
we need to keep? 
I live in Oklahoma, and if you know 
our song, you know ‘‘the wind comes 
sweeping down the plains.’’ We have 
been called the Saudi Arabia of wind 
power. I promise, you can’t drive very 
far in Oklahoma without seeing a field 
of windmills. We have lots of wind 
power, and we think it is a great en-
ergy source. But it is a mature energy 
source, and it does not need the wind 
production tax credit. So let’s sunset 
it. 
With that, I yield. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank my colleague Senator 
LANKFORD. Also, we would like to 
thank Senator ALEXANDER, Senator 
BARRASSO, and others who support this 
legislation. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent 
that our motion to concur with the 
amendment, which is at the desk, be 
agreed to; and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-
leagues, I will be brief. I want to give 
the Senate a sense of where we are 
with respect to this issue. In front of us 
right now is a bipartisan agreement to 
extend a variety of provisions to pro-
mote clean energy and reduce carbon 
emissions. 
When I talk to colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, there is enormous 
support for the effort to reduce carbon 
emissions. Now, I can look around this 
Chamber and point out colleagues who 
have worked with me on the renewable 
energy provisions that are part of this 
bipartisan agreement, which includes 
not just the credit for wind but also 
solar and other renewable energy. I 
would submit this is the best approach 
we have today, which is to make sure 
that we don’t miss out on critical in-
vestments right now. 
For the future, I have a plan to move 
to a technology-neutral system that 
would avoid picking winners and los-
ers, take this mess of a Tax Code, with 
more than 40 separate energy provi-
sions, throw it in the trash, and say we 
are going to focus on one thing—reduc-
ing carbon emissions. We aren’t there 
today. What is here today is climate 
change. That is why it is so important 
that we pass this bill and reject this 
amendment. 
With that, I want to thank my col-
leagues from North Dakota. I remem-
ber enjoying going to North Dakota 
with the sponsor of this amendment. I 
will tell you, if you are over 6 feet tall, 
make sure to exercise before you go to 
North Dakota because you will be in 
the smallest airline seat in the history 
of aviation. 
JOHN HOEVEN is a very good and car-
ing man. I am looking forward to work-
ing with him on these issues in the fu-
ture. 
And with that, I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I would ask my col-
league from Oregon—and I did have 
him in North Dakota. We had a great 
time, and I appreciate his coming out 
to see the energy we produce in our 
great State. 
I would ask the gentleman for his 
help on carbon capture technologies. 
We put funding in place to advance 
those carbon capture technologies, and 
I ask for his help and his colleagues’ 
help in that endeavor. 
Mr. WYDEN. I would say to my col-
league, I am always interested in work-
ing with him in the future. After we 
pass this bill, with these important 
provisions to meet our immediate 
needs, let’s set as our lodestar reducing 
carbon emissions. 
When you and I served on the Energy 
Committee together, that was an ap-
proach that brought together Repub-
licans and Democrats. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I thank my cosponsors 
on this amendment and our efforts will 
continue. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

PURPLE BOOK CONTINUITY ACT 
OF 2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

Resolved, That the House agree to the 
amendment of Senate to the bill (H.R. 1520) 
entitled ‘‘An Act to amend the Public Health

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
move to concur in the House amend-
ment to the Senate amendment, and I 
know of no further debate on the mo-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the question is on 
agreeing to the motion to concur in the 
House 
amendment

amendment. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the motion to reconsider

f 
UNITED 
STATES—MEXICO 
ECO-
NOMIC PARTNERSHIP ACT—Con-
tinued 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to engage in a col-
loquy with my colleague, Finance 
Committee Ranking Member WYDEN, 
to discuss a tax provision included in 
the omnibus appropriations bill cur-
rently before the Senate. The tax title 
in this bill contains important clari-
fications to, and expansions of, the Em-
ployee Retention Tax Credit estab-
lished under section 2301 of the CARES 
Act. This credit has provided vital pay-
roll support to struggling businesses in 
Iowa and across the country. The en-
hancements included in this bill are 
necessary to help more employers ac-
cess the credit. Importantly, the bill 
clarifies that businesses that received 
Paycheck Protection Program loans, 
or PPP, are still eligible for the credit 
based on other wages and benefits paid. 
Does Member WYDEN agree that our in-
tent is to allow struggling small busi-
nesses to access the retention credit, 
even if they have received a PPP loan? 
Mr. WYDEN. That is correct. COVID– 
19 
has 
shuttered 
small 
businesses 
across the Country. This is especially 
true in Oregon, where small businesses 
are the backbone of our economy. En-
suring businesses can access relief from 
both the Paycheck Protection Program 
and the Employee Retention Tax Cred-
it is critical. The legislation before us 
today would allow businesses who took 
out a PPP loan to access the retention 
credit in two instances. First, those 
businesses that have had or will have 
their loan forgiven can claim the credit 
for any wages that were not paid for 
with PPP loan proceeds. Second, a 
business that does not have its PPP 
loan forgiven can claim the credit for 
any wages. As this change will be ret-
roactive, does the Chairman agree that 
it is equally as critical that these 
small businesses are able to quickly 
and easily claim these past credits 
they will now be eligible for? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. That is why we 
are allowing these businesses, both 
those with forgiven loans and those 
without, to claim credits for wages 
paid in previous quarters that this bill 
makes eligible for the credit on their 
fourth quarter 2020 payroll tax filings. 
This will prevent small businesses from 
having to amend their previously filed 
payroll tax returns, easing the paper-
work burden for both taxpayers and the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Service. 
I 
know 
Ranking Member WYDEN will join me 
in urging the IRS to do all they can to 
simplify and expedite the process for 
eligible businesses retroactively claim-
ing the retention credit. The last thing 
these businesses need right now is addi-
tional, complex payroll tax filings. 
I thank the ranking member for en-
gaging in this colloquy to discuss this 
important issue and the clarification 
included in the pending appropriations 
bill. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish 
to enter remarks regarding the Con-
solidated 
Appropriations 
Act, 
2021, 
which I will refer to as the 2021 
Approps Act. 
Specifically, my remarks are about 
sections 1001 through 1005 of the 2021 
Approps Act. I was the sponsor and 
principal drafter of these sections. I 
also negotiated the final legislative 
text of these sections with Treasury 
Secretary Steven Mnuchin and my 
Democratic colleagues in the Senate, 
including Democratic Minority Leader 
CHUCK SCHUMER. 
These sections relate to the Federal 
Reserve’s temporary emergency lend-
ing facilities under section 13(3) of the 
Federal Reserve Act that are creatures 
of the CARES Act P.L. 116–136. These 
facilities were established in response 
to the extreme turmoil in the credit 
markets caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic in March 2020. They were made 
possible by $500 billion in funding and 
authority provided by the CARES Act. 
As a result, these facilities are often 
referred to as the CARES Act facilities, 
which is how I will refer to them. 
The CARES Act facilities are the Pri-
mary Market Corporate Credit Facil-
ity, the Secondary Market Corporate 
Credit Facility, the Municipal Liquid-
ity Facility, the Main Street Lending 
Program, and the Term Asset-Backed 
Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The 
CARES Act required and Congress in-
tended the CARES Act facilities to 
cease operations by December 31, 2020. 
I was one of the two Republican Sen-
ators involved in drafting the CARES 
ACT provisions that provided the fund-
ing and authority for the CAREES Act 
facilities. During the last 2 days—De-
cember 19, 2020 and December 20, 2020— 
I have spoken at length on the Senate 
floor about the creation, intended pur-
pose, and success of these facilities, as 
well as the impact of sections 1001 
through 1005 of the 2021 Approps Act on 
these facilities and the reasons for en-
acting these sections. As a result, I will 
not repeat those remarks now. 
Today, I would like to focus on the 
impact of one particular section of the 
2021 Approps Act: section 1005. But let 
me first remind my colleagues of what 
sections 1001 through 1005 of the 2021 
Approps Act do. Collectively, these sec-
tions rescind more than $429 billion of 
unused money out of the CARES Act 
facilities and use that money for other 
important purposes; definitively end 
the CARES Act facilities by December 
31, 2020, as Congress intended and the 
CARES Act requires; forbid the CARES 
Act facilities from being restarted; and 
prevent the CARES Act facilities from 
being replicated without congressional 
approval. 
Specifically, section 1005 of the 2021 
Approps Act prevents the creation of 
any Federal Reserve emergency lend-
ing facility established under section 
13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act that is 
‘‘the same as’’ any CARES Act facility. 
Because an earlier version of TALF 
was established in 2008 prior to the 
CARES Act, section 1005 of the 2021 
Approps 
Act 
specifically 
allows 
TALF—but only TALF—to be rep-
licated in the future without congres-
sional approval. Under section 1005 of 
the 2021 Approps Act, all of the other 
CARES Act facilities—the Primary 
Market Corporate Credit Facility, the 
Secondary Market Corporate Credit 
Facility, the Municipal Liquidity Fa-
cility, and the Main Street Lending 
Program—cannot be replicated in the 
future without congressional approval. 
So what does it mean for a new facil-
ity to be ‘‘the same as’’ a CARES Act 
facility? That question can easily be 
answered by looking at the purpose of 
the CARES Act facilities. The purpose 
of each CARES Act facility is identi-
fied in its term sheet. 
Let’s walk through them. The pur-
pose of the Primary Market Corporate 
Credit Facility was to lend directly to 
corporations by purchasing bonds or 
syndicated 
loans 
from 
them 
at 
issuance. The purpose of the Secondary 
Market Corporate Credit Facility was 
to purchase corporate bonds and cor-
porate bond Exchange Traded Funds 
(ETFs) in the secondary market. The 
purpose of the Municipal Liquidity Fa-
cility was to lend directly to states and 
municipalities by purchasing their mu-
nicipal bonds from them at issuance. 
The purpose of the Main Street Lend-
ing Program was to extend credit di-
rectly to small or medium sized busi-
nesses, including nonprofit organiza-
tions. 
These purposes are clear and are 
what define each of the CARES Act fa-
cilities. A future lending facility that 
had the same purpose as a CARES Act 
facility would be the ‘‘same as’’ as 
CARES Act facility and therefore could

not be created without congressional 
approval. The Treasury and the Fed-
eral Reserve would need to come to 
Congress for approval, just as they did 
at the time of the creation of the 
CARES Act facilities. 
Unfortunately, I have seen some un-
informed reporters and outside com-
mentators incorrectly assert that sec-
tion 1005 of the 2021 Approps Act only 
prevents the creation of new lending 
facilities if the facilities are ‘‘identical 
to’’ or ‘‘exactly the same as’’ the 
CARES Act facilities. That is mani-
festly not true. Section 1005 of the 2021 
Approps Act does not say that, nor was 
that the intent of Congress. I should 
know because unlike these reporters 
and commentators I drafted and nego-
tiated the final text of section 1005 of 
the 2021 Approps Act with my Demo-
cratic colleagues, including Minority 
Leader SCHUMER. 
During the course of our negotia-
tions, Democrats actually proposed 
that we use the phrase ‘‘identical to’’ 
in section 1005 of the 2021 Approps Act. 
I specifically rejected this proposal be-
cause ‘‘identical to’’ is far too limited 
in scope. If section 1005 of the 2021 
Approps Act had used the word ‘‘iden-
tical to’’ than that would mean only a 
new facility that is identical to a 
CARES Act facility in every way would 
be prohibited. That would defeat the 
entire purpose of section 1005. 
It would have allowed the Treasury 
and the Federal Reserve to essentially 
restart 
the 
CARES 
Act 
facilities, 
which section 1005 of the 2021 Approps 
Act separately prohibits them from re-
starting, by simply tinkering with 
their terms and launching them under 
a new name. For example, the terms of 
the Municipal Liquidity Facility only 
allow it to purchase bonds directly 
from and state and municipal issuers 
that have a maturity of up to 3 years. 
If a new facility was the same in every 
way as the Municipal Liquidity Facil-
ity with the exception that it could 
purchase bonds with maturities up to 
10 years, rather than up to 3 years, 
than it would not be ‘‘identical to’’ the 
Municipal 
Liquidity 
Facility 
and 
therefore could be created. However, 
such a facility would be the same as 
the current Municipal Liquidity Facil-
ity because it is lending directly to 
States and municipalities. 
My Republican colleagues and I did 
not want to permit for such a loophole 
in the law. That is why I specifically 
rejected my Democratic colleagues’ 
proposal that we use the phrase ‘‘iden-
tical to’’ any CARES Act facility. In 
our negotiations, I told him that we 
did not want the Treasury and Federal 
Reserve to replicate the CARES Act fa-
cilities by tinkering with their terms 
and then launching them under dif-
ferent names. Ultimately, my Demo-
cratic colleagues conceded on this 
point and agreed to compromise by 
using the broader phrase ‘‘the same as’’ 
instead. 
So where does that leave us? Section 
1005 of the 2021 Approps Act prevents a 
new Federal Reserve emergency lend-
ing facility from being established 
under section 13(3) of the Federal Re-
serve Act without congressional ap-
proval, if the facility has the same pur-
pose as a CARES Act facility. The 
CARES Act facilities were unprece-
dented facilities that the Treasury, 
with the support of the Federal Re-
serve, requested that Congress make 
possible. Congress did so through the 
CARES Act. These facilities required 
legislation in March 2020 and the same 
types of facilities would require legis-
lation in the future if the Treasury and 
the Federal Reserve believed they 
needed to engage in such bond pur-
chasing and direct lending again. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to 
thank the Senator from Virginia, the 
vice chairman of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence, for his 
work on the Intelligence Authorization 
Act, which is now part of the omnibus 
appropriations bill. I wish to address a 
few provisions that have been removed 
or modified. 
First, the IAA, as reported by the 
Senate 
Intelligence 
Committee 
in 
June, included a provision requiring 
the DNI to submit a report to the con-
gressional intelligence committees on 
the implementation of Presidential 
Policy Directive 28. That report covers 
the classified annex referenced in sec-
tion 3 of PPD–28. 
This report is extremely important. 
It will allow the committees to con-
duct oversight of signals intelligence 
collection conducted pursuant to Exec-
utive Order 12333. It will also provide 
the committee the ability to under-
stand how the government interprets 
and implements PPD–28, which has 
broad legal, policy, and diplomatic im-
plications. In response to the outrage 
from our European allies regarding 
U.S. signals intelligence operations re-
vealed by Edward Snowden, President 
Obama issued PPD–28 in January 2014. 
PPD–28 covers topics that are directly 
relevant to both Americans and for-
eigners, such as bulk collection. The 
directive, and its classified annex in 
particular, is designed to evaluate the 
benefits and risks of signals intel-
ligence operations. It was intended to 
reassure our allies about the scope of 
U.S. signals intelligence collection and 
to serve as a cornerstone for data-shar-
ing agreements, which are still ongo-
ing. Unlike FISA collection, however, 
there is no judicial oversight of collec-
tion conducted pursuant to EO 12333 
and governed by PPD–28. For all these 
reasons, therefore, it is absolutely crit-
ical that there be serious congressional 
oversight of PPD–28. 
The PPD–28 reporting requirement 
was not merely part of the IAA re-
ported by the committee. It was in the 
version of the IAA that was attached to 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act that passed the full Senate in July. 
That version was never passed into 
law, however, because the IAA fell off 
the NDAA, which is why the IAA is 
now part of the omnibus appropriations 
bill. 
Unfortunately, during the negotia-
tions leading up to this bill, the House 
Intelligence Committee minority in-
sisted that this bipartisan, Senate- 
passed provision be modified so that 
the portion of the report on the classi-
fied annex of PPD–28 is submitted to 
the chairmen and ranking minority 
members of the congressional intel-
ligence committee. To the extent this 
language could be misinterpreted to 
limit access by the full committees, it 
is unacceptable and unprecedented. 
Congress should not be in the position 
of passing legislation that could be 
seen as limiting its ability to fulfill its 
own oversight responsibilities. 
Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator 
from Oregon. I agree that the report re-
quired by the IAA on PPD–28 is criti-
cally important and central to the 
committee’s oversight responsibilities. 
I share the Senator’s dismay that this 
provision was modified in this way and 
through what I consider to be an unfor-
tunate conference process that should 
not be repeated. More generally, I op-
pose legislation that would purport to 
restrict full committee access and im-
pede the critical oversight provided by 
the full committee. 
This provision, as modified, states 
that the DNI will submit the report to 
the chairman and vice chairman. It 
does not, however, preclude its provi-
sion to the other members of the com-
mittee. As vice chairman of the com-
mittee, it is my intent to push for the 
full committee to get this report. It is 
also my intent to seek to amend this 
language so that it is not misinter-
preted to limit full committee access. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator 
from Virginia. On another topic, the 
vice chairman and I worked together to 
include in the IAA a number of criti-
cally important provisions protecting 
whistleblowers. Again, at the insist-
ence of the House Intelligence Com-
mittee minority, those provisions were 
taken out. The latest was the removal 
of a provision that would help whistle-
blowers whose security clearances have 
been revoked as a form of reprisal. 
Those provisions need to be passed into 
law. 
Mr. WARNER. I agree. I strongly sup-
ported each of the five whistleblower 
protection provisions in the IAA. It is 
my intent to keep fighting for them so 
that they are on next year’s IAA and 
are passed into law. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friends 
from Oregon and Virginia for their 
hard work on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. I agree with them that 
oversight by the full Senate Intel-
ligence Committee on these and other 
intelligence matters is at the core of 
the Senate’s constitutional responsibil-
ities. I, too, agree that the language 
should not be interpreted to limit that 
full committee oversight. I also strong-
ly agree with the Senators’ views on 
the critical importance of protecting 
whistleblowers. The abuses of the out-
going administration have illustrated 
the urgent need for these legislative 
protections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7926 
December 21, 2020 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, Sen-
ator CARPER, ranking member of the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works, Senator JOHN KENNEDY, and I, 
as chairman of the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works, are the 
principal Senate authors of section 103 
in Division S of the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2021—the American 
Innovation and Manufacturing, ‘‘AIM’’, 
Act of 2020, hereinafter ‘‘section 103’’. 
This bipartisan legislation will phase 
down the production and consumption 
of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, which are 
potent greenhouse gases that con-
tribute to climate change. As authors, 
we submit these comments to provide 
the Senate with additional information 
regarding the development of section 
103. 
Section 103 establishes a new, na-
tional program administered by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy, EPA, to phase down the production 
and consumption of certain HFC sub-
stances. Section 103 vests EPA with au-
thority to phase down the production 
and consumption of these substances in 
a comprehensive manner. It is designed 
to provide regulatory certainty. Spe-
cifically, section 103 requires EPA to 
implement an 85 percent phase down of 
the production and consumption of reg-
ulated HFC substances, so those levels 
reach approximately 15 percent of their 
2011–2013 average annual levels by 2036. 
Importantly, this section includes pro-
visions to safeguard consumers and 
American manufacturers from cost in-
creases during the phase down while 
still adhering to the phase down time-
table in subsection (e)(2)(C). 
The text of section 103 reflects bipar-
tisan, necessary improvements to the 
original, introduced text in the Senate. 
On March 4, 2020, Senator KENNEDY 
filed amendment No. 1504 to S. 2657, 
which was identical to stand-alone leg-
islation, S. 2754, the American Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Act of 2019. 
Ranking Member CARPER of the U.S. 
Senate Committee on Environment and 
Public Works Committee, EPW, co-
sponsored amendment No. 1504 and S. 
2754. EPW Chairman BARRASSO opposed 
amendment No. 1504 and S. 2754 as in-
troduced, hereinafter ‘‘introduced leg-
islation’’. 
On March 25, 2020, Chairman BAR-
RASSO
and Ranking Member CARPER 
began an electronic information-gath-
ering process on S. 2754 by EPW to so-
licit the views of stakeholders. This 
process allowed EPW to hear safely 
from many stakeholders during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The extensive in-
formation-gathering process generated 
filings from a range of industries, 
States, interest groups, and individ-
uals. 
We relied on the valuable informa-
tion gained through that process to im-
prove the introduced legislation and to 
reach collective agreement on amended 
text. This agreement was filed as 
amendment No. 2655 to S. 2657 on Sep-
tember 10, 2020. Section 103 closely re-
sembles the text of amendment No. 
2655. 
Our agreed-upon changes to the in-
troduced legislation have focused in a 
few key areas identified by Chairman 
BARRASSO. The first key area is ‘‘essen-
tial uses’’ of regulated HFC substances. 
The introduced legislation offered im-
mediate relief for some special cir-
cumstances, including feedstocks and 
process agents. For example, in a pro-
vision that has been present in all 
versions of the legislation, subsection 
(e)(4)(A) assures there are no regu-
latory requirements for ‘‘a regulated 
substance that is used and entirely 
consumed (except for trace quantities) 
in the manufacture of another chem-
ical.’’ Where trace quantities of an 
HFC regulated substance, including im-
purities or unreacted feedstock chem-
ical, remain through transformation of 
a regulated HFC substance into an-
other product, that activity is covered 
by the exemption as soon as the Act is 
enacted into law. 
The introduced legislation did not 
provide immediate protection for es-
sential uses. Subsection (e)(4)(B) now 
provides that relief for essential uses. 
Congress has identified six essential 
uses in subsection (e)(4)(B)(iv) that are 
designated by law as essential uses 
upon enactment: No. 1, propellant in 
metered dose inhalers; No. 2, defense 
sprays; No. 3, structural composite 
preformed polyurethane foam for ma-
rine use and trailer use; No. 4, the etch-
ing of semiconductor material or wa-
fers and the cleaning of chemical vapor 
deposition chambers within the semi- 
conductor manufacturing sector; No. 5, 
mission-critical 
military 
end 
uses, 
such as armored vehicle engine and 
shipboard fire suppression systems and 
systems used in deployable and expedi-
tionary applications; and No. 6, on-
board aerospace fire suppression. 
In 
implementing 
this 
legislation, 
EPA must allocate, by rule, the full 
quantity of allowances needed by each 
of these six congressionally designated 
uses for at least 5 years. This rule-
making only determines the quantities 
of mandatory allowances that are allo-
cated to each of the six uses above. 
Under 
subsection 
(e)(4)(B)(i)–(iii), 
EPA may, by rule, designate other uses 
as essential uses and allocate any such 
use a quantity of allowances, provided 
certain criteria are met and subject to 
the applicable phasedown timelines 
and regulations for the production and 
consumption of HFCs under (e)(2)–(3). 
The Administrator is required to re-
view each essential use application 
every 5 years and shall continue to 
make available essential use allow-
ances if the Administrator determines, 
subject to notice and opportunity for 
public comment, that statutory cri-
teria 
are 
met 
under 
subsection 
(e)(4)(B)(v). 
The second key area of change from 
the introduced legislation is express 
preemption of certain State and local 
laws, reflected in subsection (k)(2). 
With respect to an exclusive use for 
which a mandatory allocation of allow-
ances is provided under subsection 
(e)(4)(B)(iv)(I), subsection (k)(2)(A) pre-
empts any enforcement of a statute or 
administrative action by a State or po-
litical subdivision of a State for 5 years 
from the date of enactment. Preemp-
tion is potentially extendable for up 
to—but not more than—10 years, as 
provided in subsection (k)(2)(B). 
The third key area of change from 
the introduced legislation is the pro-
tection of consumers and businesses 
from cost increases. Of particular note, 
under subsection (f)(2)(B), EPA cannot 
accelerate 
the 
15-year 
regulatory 
timeline faster than HFC consumption 
levels that the market is already 
achieving. However, EPA must ensure 
any level set under this subsection is 
at least as stringent as the production 
and consumption levels of regulated 
substances required under subsection 
(e)(2)(C) for a given year, as provided in 
subsection (f)(6). Language to protect 
consumers and businesses, particularly 
residential and small business con-
sumers, has also been added to regu-
latory provisions throughout the bill, 
including essential uses (subsection 
(e)(4)–(5)), accelerated schedule (sub-
section (f)), and technology transitions 
(subsection (i)). 
Together we support section 103. We 
thank our House colleagues for work-
ing together with us to improve further 
our Senate agreement reached in Sep-
tember 2020. Through negotiations with 
leaders of the U.S. House of Represent-
atives Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, we agreed to additional changes 
to improve legislative clarity, includ-
ing language to help protect afford-
ability for residential and small busi-
ness consumers while also protecting 
the environment. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, section 
20l(f) of the unemployment extension 
provisions of the bill we are consid-
ering this evening contains language 
limiting retroactive Pandemic Unem-
ployment Assistance compensation for 
applicants that had not applied by the 
date of enactment of this bill. 
It is my understanding that this pro-
vision is intended to cover individuals 
who have known for months of their 
eligibility for benefits but failed to 
apply in a timely manner. However, it 
is also my understanding that this pro-
vision is not intended to apply in cases 
where the individuals have only re-
cently learned they would be eligible 
for PUA and a State unemployment of-
fice had previously advised those indi-
viduals not to apply for benefits. This 
is the case, for instance, for secondary 
schools students in Minnesota, who 
were advised by the State that they 
were not eligible for PUA, but a court 
recently determined that the students 
were indeed eligible earlier this month. 
It is also my understanding that this 
provision is not intended to apply to 
individuals who have filed a regular 
State unemployment insurance claim 
that remains in adjudication, who later 
find out that they are ineligible for 
regular unemployment compensation 
and must apply for PUA instead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7927 
December 21, 2020 
Senator WYDEN was the lead Demo-
cratic negotiator on the unemployment 
provisions of this bill. Does he share 
the same understanding of the intent 
of this provision? 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes. That language was 
not intended to limit retroactive com-
pensation for individuals who were pre-
viously advised by a State, that they 
were ineligible for PUA, nor was it in-
tended to limit retroactive compensa-
tion for individuals who have a regular 
unemployment insurance claim in ad-
judication and later find out they need 
to apply for PUA. 
Ms. SMITH. Thank you for the clari-
fication and for your work in drafting 
the unemployment compensation lan-
guage in this bill. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to 
talk about the inclusion of critical pro-
tections for renters in the bill before us 
today. These include $25 billion in 
emergency rental assistance and an ex-
tension of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention’s nationwide evic-
tion moratorium through January 31, 
2021. 
This bill does not include all that I 
have been calling for since this crisis 
began, nor is it the bill I would have 
written on my own, but it is a long 
overdue and essential start on the help 
families urgently need to stay or be-
come safely and stably housed right 
now. And it is arriving as millions of 
renters across the country are on the 
precipice of an entirely preventable 
eviction crisis. 
One in five renters are behind on rent 
right now. For renters in households 
with children, this number is one in 
four, and for Black renters, the rate is 
nearly one in three. Economist Mark 
Zandi estimates that renters are $70 
billion behind on rent, with average 
back rent of nearly $6,000. With mil-
lions of families potentially facing 
eviction or displacement, without this 
bill, the current CDC eviction morato-
rium would have expired on December 
31, making for a very unhappy new 
year for many renters across the coun-
try. 
A wave of evictions in the middle of 
this pandemic will set back millions of 
families, interrupt jobs and educations, 
and exacerbate inequality in this coun-
try. It will also make it harder to keep 
people healthy and get the virus under 
control. 
I have heard from Ohioans how badly 
people need housing assistance. A 
group of Ohio’s homeless services orga-
nizations told me recently about the 
tremendous surge in family homeless-
ness they are seeing during the pan-
demic. One reported that 80 percent of 
their shelter requests have been fami-
lies with kids. These are families with 
nowhere to go and trying to balance 
work and school. How many of them 
could have stayed in their homes, and 
not disrupted their lives—and their 
kids’ lives—if the Federal Government 
had just stepped in with rental assist-
ance? 
In Columbus, there are over 100 evic-
tion trials every day, even with the 
current CDC moratorium in place. An 
advocate I spoke with told me that he 
expected there to be a ‘‘massive flood’’ 
of eviction cases in January after the 
CDC moratorium expires. 
We did not have to be here. Since the 
passage of the CARES Act in March, I 
have been calling for more help for 
renters and homeowners to withstand 
the COVID–19 pandemic and its eco-
nomic effects. In May, I introduced S. 
3865, the Emergency Rental Assistance 
and Rental Market Stabilization Act of 
2020, 
to 
provide 
these 
resources 
throughout the country. The House 
passed this bill as part of the Heroes 
Act in May. Unfortunately, Senate 
Leader MCCONNELL did not see the ur-
gency to act on COVID relief for fami-
lies, and we are just coming to the 
floor with a bill to help address the 
COVID–19 crisis 7 months later. 
Today’s bill, while not going far 
enough, takes action to help renters re-
main or become stably housed and keep 
their utilities running. The $25 billion 
in rental assistance and extension of 
the eviction moratorium will work to-
gether to protect renters from evic-
tions in the midst of the pandemic in 
the middle of winter. The eviction mor-
atorium extension helps prevent evic-
tions while families await assistance. 
Rental assistance will ensure that fam-
ilies can pay their bills and remain in 
their homes during and after the pan-
demic without being forced to make 
impossible choices between rent and 
food or medicine. 
Given how badly these resources are 
needed in the community today, the 
Department of Treasury must do all 
that it can to implement this rental as-
sistance program quickly and success-
fully. 
This means ensuring that States and 
communities can quickly provide funds 
to those who need them and minimize 
artificial paperwork and documenta-
tion barriers for applicants trying to 
access the funds Congress intended 
them to have. Treasury should avoid 
establishing requirements that are bur-
densome for both renters and grantees 
administering emergency rental assist-
ance programs and that will slow down 
dollars going to keep the heat on and 
pay landlords. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has had 
broad impacts on individuals, families, 
businesses, availability of government 
services and supports, and throughout 
our economy. It has changed where and 
how many people work. It has made it 
more difficult not just to keep a job, 
but also to find a new job, to get 
enough hours, and to find child care or 
someone to care for a sick loved one. 
All of these challenges brought on by 
the pandemic have made it more dif-
ficult for families to make ends meet. 
These effects are likely to exist for 
months and years to come. As Congress 
has stated in this bill, given the enor-
mous documentation challenges facing 
families as businesses close and service 
jobs reduce in hours, an applicant’s 
written attestation should be the only 
documentation 
required 
to 
dem-
onstrate a connection to the pandemic. 
In addition to financial assistance for 
rent, utilities, and other housing costs, 
the bill permits grantees to fund hous-
ing stability services. This will allow 
grantees to offer households services 
they may need to remain or become 
stably housed, including case manage-
ment, landlord-tenant mediation, legal 
services, eviction prevention services, 
rehousing services, services to connect 
eligible households to other public sup-
ports, and referrals to other services 
for behavioral, emotional, and mental 
health issues, domestic violence, child 
welfare, employment, and substance 
abuse treatment. 
Finally, the emergency rental assist-
ance fund in this bill provides non-
taxable assistance for renter house-
holds that does not count toward in-
come for calculating eligibility for 
other programs. Emergency assistance 
is just that—emergency assistance for 
an extraordinary event—and it should 
not be used to penalize families fur-
ther. If there is any confusion about 
the taxability of this assistance, the 
Department of Treasury, in consulta-
tion with the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice, should provide guidance to clarify 
this for grantees and participants. 
I will continue to fight for the hous-
ing resources and protections our rent-
ers and homeowners need to stay in 
their homes. I also look forward to 
working to successfully deploy the his-
toric resources and protections pro-
vided in this bill.

Relations Committee be discharged 
from further consideration and the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. Res 774. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. BOOZMAN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Boozman amendment to 
the resolution be considered and agreed 
to; the resolution, as amended, be 
agreed to; the Boozman amendment to 
the preamble be agreed to; the pre-
amble, as amended, be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2733) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the resolving clause) 
On page 2, lines 10 and 11, strike ‘‘staff 
worldwide;’’ and insert ‘‘staff, who work tire-
lessly, and often at great personal risk, to 
combat hunger and save lives around the 
world;’’. 
On page 3, line 3, strike ‘‘nutrition’’ and in-
sert ‘‘nutrition, including’’. 
The resolution (S. Res. 774), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2734) was agreed

(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
Beginning in the second whereas clause of 
the preamble, strike ‘‘Whereas the WFP’’ 
and all that follows through the semicolon in 
the fifth whereas clause and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas the WFP is the largest inter-
national humanitarian organization that ad-
dresses hunger, promotes food security, and 
saves lives, including in response to many of 
the most dangerous and complex crises in 
the world; 
Whereas, in 2019, an estimated 135,000,000 
people around the world suffered from acute 
hunger and the WFP provided nutrition as-
sistance to nearly 100,000,000 people in 88 
countries; 
Whereas the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has 
contributed to a significant increase in hun-
ger around the world, and the WFP has 
surged its capacity in order to meet that 
compounded need; 
Whereas the United States played an inte-
gral role in the founding of the WFP, re-
mains its strongest supporter, and provides, 
as of the date of adoption of this resolution, 
more than 40 percent of its annual resources; 
In the seventh whereas clause of the pre-
amble, strike ‘‘Price’’ and insert ‘‘Prize’’. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 774 
Whereas, on October 9, 2020, the Norwegian 
Nobel Committee announced that the Nobel 
Peace Prize for 2020 has been awarded to the 
United Nations World Food Programme (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WFP’’) 
‘‘for its efforts to combat hunger, for its con-
tribution to bettering conditions for peace in 
conflict-affected areas and for acting as a 
driving force in efforts to prevent the use of 
hunger as a weapon of war and conflict’’; 
Whereas the WFP is the largest inter-
national humanitarian organization that ad-
dresses hunger, promotes food security, and 
saves lives, including in response to many of 
the most dangerous and complex crises in 
the world; 
Whereas, in 2019, an estimated 135,000,000 
people around the world suffered from acute 
hunger and the WFP provided nutrition as-
sistance to nearly 100,000,000 people in 88 
countries; 
Whereas the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has 
contributed to a significant increase in hun-
ger around the world, and the WFP has 
surged its capacity in order to meet that 
compounded need; 
Whereas the United States played an inte-
gral role in the founding of the WFP, re-
mains its strongest supporter, and provides, 
as of the date of adoption of this resolution, 
more than 40 percent of its annual resources; 
Whereas the WFP has stated, ‘‘Until the 
day we have a medical vaccine, food is the 
best vaccine against chaos’’; and 
Whereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee, 
in announcing the winner of the Nobel Peace 
Prize for 2020, stated, ‘‘The work of the 
World Food Programme to the benefit of hu-
mankind is an endeavour that all the nations 
of the world should be able to endorse and 
support’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) joins the other countries of the world 
in— 
(A) affirming the mission of the United Na-
tions World Food Programme (referred to in 
this resolution as the ‘‘WFP’’) on the occa-
sion of being awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace 
Prize; and 
(B) supporting the leadership of the WFP 
Executive Director, David Beasley, and the 
contributions of the more than 17,000 WFP 
staff, who work tirelessly, and often at great 
personal risk, to combat hunger and save 
lives around the world; and 
(2) remains committed to the goal of the 
international community to end hunger, 
achieve food security, and improve nutrition, 
including through the work of the WFP.

demic, and options for alternative, non-addict-
ive therapeutics for pain; and 
(3) the National Science Foundation and the 
National Institutes of Health have recognized 
that fundamental questions in basic, clinical, 
and translational research would benefit greatly 
from multidisciplinary approaches and collabo-
ration.

Research and Treatment Act’’ or the ‘‘EF-
FORT Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
(1) research gaps currently exist in the pre-
vention and treatment of opioid addiction; 
(2) the National Science Foundation’s re-
search on opioid addiction has increased un-
derstanding of the neuroscience of addiction, 
substance abuse intervention, the role of il-
licit supply networks, the secondary effects 
on families, the use of technology to address 
the opioid epidemic, and options for alter-
native, non-addictive therapeutics for pain; 
and 
(3) the National Science Foundation and 
the National Institutes of Health have recog-
nized that fundamental questions in basic, 
clinical, and translational research would 
benefit greatly from multidisciplinary ap-
proaches and collaboration.

f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, here is 
where we are on the status of the De-
fense authorization bill. 
The Senate has passed this annual 
bill to support our servicemembers and 
our national security every year for 
the last 59 years. As I indicated when I 
filed cloture on the NDAA conference 
report after Thanksgiving, my inten-
tion was and is to ensure the Senate 
continues fulfilling our obligation to 
the men and women of our Armed 
Forces. 
I hope the President will not veto 
this bill, which redoubles our commit-
ment to modernization, advances cut-
ting-edge capabilities, and equips our 
military with the tools and resources 
they need to compete with our great 
power adversaries on land, on sea, in 
the air, and in cyberspace. These are 
the steps we need to take to continue 
to compete with Russia and China. 
In the event that President Trump 
does elect to veto this bipartisan bill, 
it appears the House may choose to re-
turn after the holidays to set up a vote 
to consider the veto. The Democratic 
leader and I have agreed to a unani-
mous consent request as follows: The 
Senate will meet for pro forma sessions 
only until December 29, when we will 
return to session. 
In the event that the President has 
vetoed the bill and the House has voted 
to override the veto, the Senate would 
have the opportunity to process the 
veto override at that time. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged and the Senate proceed to 
the en bloc consideration of the fol-
lowing nominations: PN1938, PN2024, 
PN2101, PN2030, and PN2025. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nominations 
en bloc. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate; that if con-
firmed, the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table en bloc; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
actions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
C. Kevin Blackstone, of Virginia, a Ca-
reer Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, Class of Minister-Counselor, to 
be 
Ambassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Plenipotentiary of the United States of 
America to the Democratic Republic of 
Timor-Leste; Cynthia Kierscht, of Min-
nesota, a Career Member of the Senior 
Foreign Service, Class of Counselor, to 
be 
Ambassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Plenipotentiary of the United States of 
America to the Islamic Republic of 
Mauritania; Brian D. McFeeters, of 
Virginia, a Career Member of the Sen-
ior Foreign Service, Class of Minister- 
Counselor, to be Ambassador Extraor-
dinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to Malaysia; 
David Reimer, of Ohio, a Career Mem-
ber of the Senior Foreign Service,

Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of 
the United States of America to the 
Republic of Sierra Leone; Geeta Pasi, 
of New York, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career 
Minister, to be Ambassador Extraor-
dinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the Fed-
eral Democratic Republic of Ethiopia? 
The nominations were confirmed en

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 1301 of title XIII of the FY21 con-
solidated appropriations act delays im-
plementation of reforms to the U.S. 
Agency for Global Media outlined in 
section 1299Q of the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. While 
the FY2021 NDAA has not yet been en-
acted and may be enacted following the 
enactment of the 2021 Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, Chairman RISCH and I 
believe it is Congress’s intent that 
these two provisions be understood 
concurrently and that the reforms out-
lined in section 1299Q be delayed for 90 
days following enactment of the FY2021 
NDAA. 
f 
CASE Act 
Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. President, after 
many years of work to ensure small 
creators have a voice, I am glad to 
share the Copyright Alternatives in 
Small-Claims Enforcement Act, also 
known as CASE Act, passed the House 
and Senate and is awaiting the Presi-
dent’s signature. This bipartisan and 
bicameral legislation is critical for 
protecting the creative middle class in 
Louisiana and across America who rely 
upon commercializing their creative 
works for their livelihood. 
Photographers, visual artists, inde-
pendent movie directors, musicians, 
authors, and other creators who make 
up the creative middle class rely on 
copyright to protect their works from 
unauthorized reproduction. However, 
under current law, copyright owners 
with small infringement claims cannot 
obtain relief because district court liti-
gation costs are higher than the dam-
ages sought. That is where CASE Act 
comes in. This legislation creates the 
Copyright Claims Board within the 
U.S. Copyright Office to provide a sim-
ple, quick, and less expensive forum for 
small copyright owners to enforce their 
rights. 
The creation of this bill began more 
than 7 years ago. In 2013, after a com-
prehensive study, the U.S. Copyright 
Office made several legislative rec-
ommendations to help independent cre-
ators 
in 
enforcing 
their 
constitu-
tionally protected copyrights. Since 
then, Congress has worked in lock-step 
with the U.S. Copyright Office to cre-
ate a framework to accomplish this 
goal. That framework culminated in 
CASE Act. 
In response to concerns raised by the 
library community, the bill now in-
cludes a blanket opt-out provision for 
libraries and archives. This opt-out is 
expressly limited to activities covered 
by section 108 of the Copyright Act. It 
does not apply to activities that fall 
outside that section, such as websites 
making and offering unlicensed copies 
of works. A library or archive must re-
main in full compliance with section 
108 at all times to be eligible for the 
blanket opt-out privilege and would 
lose its eligibility for the blanket opt- 
out if, at any time, it is found to have 
violated any of the conditions through-
out section 108. 
I want to extend my gratitude to the 
photographers, musicians, artists, au-
thors, and many other creators who 
have helped make the passage of CASE 
Act a success. There are so many indi-
viduals who have been instrumental in

cial recognition are Copyright Alli-

f 
PROTECTING LAWFUL STREAMING 
ACT 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today I 
want to say a word about the need to 
revise title 18 so that criminal com-
mercial enterprises that stream pirated 
content to users are subject to the 
same felony penalties as criminal com-
mercial enterprises that distribute to 
users or reproduce pirated content. The 
provisions of the Protecting Lawful 
Streaming Act target clearly criminal 
conduct committed with criminal in-
tent. Lawful internet and streaming 
services, licensees, other mainstream 
businesses, and users engaged in ordi-
nary activities do not risk prosecution. 
Most importantly, businesses engaged 
in those activities are clearly excluded 
by the requirements that a defendant 
be engaged in conduct that is primarily 
designed, intentionally marketed, or 
has no commercially significant pur-
pose or use other than for use in illegal 
streaming. Nor do those engaged in 
noncommercial activities risk prosecu-
tion under this statute. Noncommer-
cial activities are explicitly excluded 
by the terms of section 2319C(a). It is 
intended that none of these activities 
shall be subject to any risk of criminal 
prosecution under this bill. 
More generally, it is well established 
that criminal penalties are the excep-
tion rather than the rule in cases of 
copyright infringement. As the Depart-
ment of Justice itself has noted, crimi-
nal sanctions are appropriate only with 
respect to certain types of infringe-
ment—generally when infringer knows 
the infringement is wrong, and when 
the infringement is particularly seri-
ous or the type of case renders civil en-
forcement by copyright owners espe-
cially difficult. As such, criminal pros-
ecution has been and is appropriately 
reserved for serious forms of large- 
scale, commercial infringement, not as 
a means of targeting ordinary business 
disputes between legitimate companies 
or those which are otherwise ade-
quately addressed through civil litiga-
tion. The new section 2319C, in par-
ticular, 
requires 
willfulness, 
which 
means that the statute does not apply 
in the absence of an intentional viola-
tion of a known legal duty. 
Consistent with this, a provider of 
broadband 
internet 
access 
service 
would not be subject to prosecution 
under this statute, for example, based 
merely on the attributes or features of 
its service, nor could prosecution be 
predicated on the misuse of its service 
by its customers or others in further-
ance of an infringement scheme, where 
the service provider does not itself 
share the requisite criminal intent of 
the underlying substantive offense and 
act with specific intent to further it. In 
this regard, offering high-speed connec-
tions that allow its customers to ac-
cess the internet, failing to block or 
disable access to particular online lo-
cations, or failing to take measures to 
restrict the use of or deny its cus-
tomers access to such service would 
not be sufficient to demonstrate the 
requisite criminal intent under the 
bill. This conduct would also not other-
wise meet the prerequisites under the 
aiding and abetting statute, regardless 
of whether the broadband internet ac-
cess service provider might be civilly 
liable in such circumstances under the 
differing standards for contributory or 
vicarious liability. 
A person who willfully and for pur-
poses of commercial advantage or pri-
vate financial gain offers or provides to 
the public a digital transmission serv-
ice violates the statute under section 
2319C(a)(3) when that person inten-
tionally promotes or directs the pro-
motion of its use in publicly per-
forming works protected under title 17 
without the authority of the copyright 
owner or the law. The language of sec-
tion 2319C makes clear that it is the of-
fering of an illicit digital transmission 
service, 
as 
defined 
by 
section 
2319C(a)(1)–(3), that is an offense, not 
the marketing activities done by or at 
the direction of a person offering an il-
licit digital transmission service, as re-
ferred to in section 2319C(a)(3). Thus, 
an entity that provides only commer-
cial online marketing services and does 
not itself also provide an illicit digital 
transmission service would not be sub-
ject 
to 
prosecution 
under 
section 
2319C(a). Further, it is not the intent of 
this legislation to create potential aid-
ing and abetting liability for main-
stream third party ad networks or 
marketers. An online marketing serv-
ices provider could be liable for aiding 
and abetting an unrelated entity pro-
viding 
unlawful 
streaming 
services 
only where the online marketing serv-
ices provider shared the same requisite 
criminal intent of each element of the 
underlying 
substantive 
offense 
and 
acted with specific intent to further it. 
Thus, an online marketing services 
provider which places an advertisement 
for an entity that is violating section 
2319C(a) would face aiding and abetting 
liability only if the online marketing 
services provider was itself associated 
with the criminal venture of the illicit 
digital transmission service to such an 
extent that it shares the criminal in-
tent of the person offering the service 
and acted with the requisite specific 
intent to commit or facilitate the un-
derlying offense. 
Similarly, a service that streams 
content uploaded by users would not be 
subject to prosecution merely because 
some users might upload infringing 
content. The service would be subject 
to criminal liability only if it had the 
requisite criminal intent and acted 
with specific intent to further it. 
The provisions of this statute also do 
not apply to any person acting in good 
faith and with an objectively reason-
able basis in law to believe that their 
conduct is lawful. Thus, a bona fide 
commercial dispute over the scope or 
existence of a contract or license gov-
erning such conduct or a good-faith 
dispute regarding whether a particular 
activity is authorized by the Copyright 
Act would not provide a basis for pros-
ecution. For example, neither a cloud- 
based DVR service nor an application 
provided by a multichannel video pro-
gramming distributor, MVPD, to en-
able such MVPD’s customers to access 
its video service utilizing a mobile de-
vice, which were the subject of prior 
civil copyright infringement challenges 
based on good faith disagreements re-
garding the scope of rights under the 
Copyright Act, would be actionable 
under this provision if the provider of-
fering such services met this standard. 
By contrast, a party that merely as-
serts an applicable contract, an excep-
tion, or a belief that the person’s con-
duct was lawful, in a case where the as-
sertion is not made in good-faith, is 
merely a pretense, or is otherwise not 
based on an objectively reasonable in-
terpretation of the law, would not 
avoid prosecution on that basis. 
The statute provides for an enhanced 
penalty in section 2319C(b)(2) for some-
one who knowingly commits an offense 
in connection with 1 or more works 
being prepared for commercial public 
performance. 
The 
‘‘should 
have 
known’’ standard in section 2319C(b)(2) 
applies only after a finder of fact deter-
mines beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the person committed an offense under 
subsection 
(a). 
The 
‘‘should 
have 
known’’ 
standard 
should 
not 
be 
conflated with the standards of willful-
ness, not primarily designed, no com-
mercially 
significant 
purpose, 
and 
intentionality set forth in section 
2319C(a), all of which define the under-
lying offense and are intended to pro-
tect lawful internet and streaming 
services, content licensees, and non-
commercial users. 
Finally, 
the 
statute 
in 
section 
2319C(d)(3) defines a work being pre-
pared for commercial public perform-
ance, based on the definition of ‘‘work 
being prepared for commercial dis-
tribution’’ in section 506(a)(3) of the 
Copyright Act, while updating that def-
inition to account for the challenges of 
piracy in the modern streaming envi-
ronment. Section 2319C reflects the

fact 
that 
infringement 
threatens 
unique harm when it occurs prior to or 
in the earliest windows of commercial 
availability. 
The 
definition 
in 
2319C(d)(3) 
recognizes 
that 
in 
the 
modem streaming environment, not all 
motion pictures are developed for the-
atrical distribution. The updated defi-
nition of a ‘‘work being prepared for 
commercial public performance’’ af-
fords appropriately enhanced penalties 
for violations of the statute involving 
pre- and just-released film and tele-
vision content, whether in a first the-
atrical window or immediately upon 
release to the public via a streaming or 
other platform. The legislation does 
not make corresponding changes to the 
definition of ‘‘work made for commer-
cial distribution’’ in section 506(a)(3). 
Whether it is appropriate to harmonize 
the definitions is a question that is be-
yond the scope of this particular legis-
lation, which does not otherwise make 
changes to title 17. Section 2319C(d)(1) 
defines ‘‘motion picture’’ as defined in 
the Copyright Act, which includes non-
theatrical motion pictures, television 
shows, and broadcasts of live events.

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, this ex-
planation reflects the status of nego-
tiations 
and 
disposition 
of 
issues 
reached between the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence and the 
House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence for the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
The explanation shall have the same 
effect with respect to the implementa-
tion of this act as if it were a joint ex-
planatory statement of a conference 
committee. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
joint explanatory statement for the In-
telligence Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2021 be printed into the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL 
YEAR 2021 
The following is the explanation of the In-
telligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021 (hereinafter, ‘‘the Act’’). 
This explanation reflects the result of ne-
gotiations and disposition of issues reached 
between the Senate Select Committee on In-
telligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) 
and the (hereinafter, ‘‘the Agreement’’). The 
explanation shall have the same effect with 
respect to the implementation of the Act as 
if it were a joint explanatory statement of a 
conference committee. The term ‘‘Commit-
tees’’ refers to both SSCI and HPSCI. 
The explanation comprises three parts: an 
overview of the application of the annex to 
accompany this statement; unclassified con-
gressional direction; and a section-by-sec-
tion analysis of the legislative text. 
PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX 
The classified nature of U.S. intelligence 
activities prevents the SSCI and HPSCI (col-
lectively, the ‘‘congressional intelligence 
committees’’) from publicly disclosing many 
details concerning the conclusions and rec-
ommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, 
a classified Schedule of Authorizations and a 
classified annex have been prepared to de-
scribe in detail the scope and intent of the 
congressional intelligence committees’ ac-
tions. The Agreement authorizes the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) to obligate and ex-
pend funds not altered or modified by the 
classified Schedule of Authorizations as re-
quested in the President’s budget, subject to 
modification under applicable reprogram-
ming procedures. 
The classified annex is the result of nego-
tiations between the congressional intel-
ligence committees. They reconcile the dif-
ferences between the congressional intel-
ligence committees’ respective versions of 
the bill for the National Intelligence Pro-
gram (NIP) for Fiscal Year 2021. The Agree-
ment also makes recommendations for the 
Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the 
Information 
Systems 
Security 
Program 
(ISSP), consistent with the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, and 
provides certain direction for these two pro-
grams. The Agreement applies to IC activi-
ties for Fiscal Year 2021. 
The classified Schedule of Authorizations 
is incorporated into the bill pursuant to Sec-
tion 102. It has the status of law. The classi-
fied annex supplements and adds detail to 
clarify the authorization levels found in the 
bill and the classified Schedule of Authoriza-
tions. The congressional intelligence com-
mittees view direction and recommenda-
tions, whether contained in this explanation 
or in the classified annex, as requiring com-
pliance by the Executive Branch. 
PART II: SELECT UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL 
DIRECTION 
This Joint Explanatory Statement incor-
porates by reference, and the Executive 
Branch shall comply with, all direction con-
tained in the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence Report to accompany the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021 (S. Rept. 116–233) and in the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence 
Report to accompany the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (H. Rept. 
116–565).

and 
vulnerabilities, an assessment of the IC’s and 
DoD’s identification and mitigation of such 
risks and vulnerabilities, and recommenda-
tions for the IC and DoD to improve identi-
fication and mitigation of such risks and

Section 324. Assessment of demand for student 
loan repayment program benefit. 
Section 324 requires the head of each IC 
element to calculate the number of per-
sonnel who qualify for a student loan repay-
ment program benefit, and compare it to the

Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, pursuant 
to Senate rule XXXIII, I wish to inform 
all Senators that on December 18, 2020, 
the Committee on Rules and Adminis-
tration adopted the ‘‘U.S. Senate Al-
ternate Vehicle Parking Regulations,’’ 
which supersede and replace the cur-

scooters. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the regulations as 
adopted be printed in the RECORD.

REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my friend and 
former colleague, Senator Paul Sar-
banes, who passed away December 6, 
2020. I join the entire Nation in mourn-
ing his passing. 
Paul was born in Salisbury, MD, on 
February 3, 1933. His first job was bus-
ing tables and washing dishes at his 
parents’ 
restaurant 
on 
Maryland’s 
Eastern Shore. He attended Princeton 
University, 
where 
he 
received 
the 
Moses 
Taylor 
Pryne 
Honor 
Prize, 
Princeton’s 
highest 
undergraduate 
honor. He was a Rhodes Scholar, which 
earned him admission to Balliol Col-
lege of the University of Oxford in Ox-
ford, England. Upon his return to the 
United States, Paul attended Harvard 
Law School. 
In the early 1960s, Paul Sarbanes 
clerked for Fourth Circuit Judge Mor-
ris A. Soper before entering private 
practice with two Baltimore law firms. 
In 1966, Paul ran for the Maryland 
House of Delegates in Baltimore City, 
where he served on both the Judiciary 
and the Ways and Means Committees. 
Four years later in 1970, Sarbanes 
was elected to the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, representing Maryland’s 
Fourth and later Maryland’s Third 
Congressional Districts from 1971 to 
1977. Paul continued his public service 
when he was elected to the U.S. Senate 
in 1976. Senator Sarbanes served Mary-
land well. He sat on many committees 
but was chairman of the Senate Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs Com-
mittee prior to my years as chairman. 
After serving five terms in the U.S. 
Senate, Paul retired to Maryland in 
2007. The same year, he earned the For-
eign Language Advocacy Award from 
the 
Northeast 
Conference 
on 
the 
Teaching of Foreign Languages in rec-
ognition of his lifelong commitment to 
the ancient world’s values and lan-
guages. 
Paul was admired by many and will 
be missed by his sons, JOHN and Mi-
chael, his daughter, Janet, and his 
seven grandchildren. He was known for 
his intellect and tenacity and will be 
remembered for his devotion to Mary-
land and the Nation. I ask the entire 
Senate to join me in recognizing and 
honoring the life of Paul Sarbanes.

TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would 
like to start by thanking my good 
friend Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER for 
his nearly two decades in the Senate 
and his longstanding devotion to im-
proving our country. His dedication to 
the people of Tennessee and Americans 
throughout our Nation has been un-
wavering. We have served together in 
the Senate for 18 years, but he has been 
in public service for much longer than 
that. 
I remember when Senator ALEX-
ANDER was first elected to the Senate 
in 2002. He was no stranger to his new 
colleagues. LAMAR had already served 
as the Governor of Tennessee, the 
president of the University of Ten-
nessee, and the Secretary of Education 
under George H.W. Bush. He also ran 
for President in 1996 and again in 2000. 
We should have seen the writing on 
the wall then—that Senator ALEX-
ANDER would be one of the smartest 
and most ambitious Members we would 
serve with throughout our careers. 
Born in Maryville, TN, LAMAR grad-
uated Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt 
University and went on to receive his 
juris doctor from the New York Univer-
sity, NYU, School of Law. He then 
clerked on the Fifth Circuit for Judge 
John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans. 
Following his time in Louisiana, he 
moved to Washington to work as a leg-
islative 
assistant 
for 
then-Senator 
Howard Baker of Tennessee. This is 
when he met his beloved wife Honey. 
They married and had four children, 
and his remarkable career took off. 
During LAMAR’s time as a U.S. Sen-
ator, he served as the chairman of the

December 21, 2020 
Senate Republican conference, an im-
portant leadership position in which he 
influenced his fellow Members to ac-
complish conservative achievements by 
working in unison. 
Currently, LAMAR is the chairman of 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions, HELP, Committee— a‘‘Class A’’ 
committee in the Senate. In 2016, he 
was instrumental in passing the over-
whelmingly bipartisan 21st Century 
Cures Act—landmark legislation that 
has brought new innovations and ad-
vances to patients who need them fast-
er and more efficiently. 
I have been blessed to serve with 
LAMAR on the Senate Rules Committee 
and the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, where he is the current chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Energy 
and Water Development. 
In this role on Appropriations, he has 
supported and advanced a host of im-
portant national priorities, such as nu-
clear security, critical infrastructure 
projects across the country, and the 
science and research taking place at 
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I, 
along with my colleagues on the com-
mittee, am grateful for his hard work 
to craft many years of significant and 
influential funding measures. 
LAMAR came to the Senate as a staff-
er and is leaving as chairman of one of 
the largest and most significant com-
mittees in the Senate. His impact and 
leadership during his time here has 
been both substantial and constructive. 
LAMAR and I have travelled the world 
together. Annette and I have enjoyed 
the many hours spent with Honey and 
him. He will be missed in the Senate. I 
thank Senator ALEXANDER for his dedi-
cation to the betterment of our coun-
try and wish him all the best in his 
next chapter of life.

HONORING AMERICA’S FALLEN 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as we ap-
proach the end of another year, I rise 
to remember all those American men 
and women who have given what Presi-
dent Lincoln called ‘‘the last full meas-
ure of devotion’’ in service to this 
great Nation. 
I often reflect on the Gettysburg Ad-
dress when thinking about our service-
members and veterans. We all know 
this short, somber speech has reverber-
ated throughout our history with an 
influence that vastly exceeds the few 
minutes for which Lincoln actually 
spoke. In November 1863, President 
Lincoln stood on the battlefield in Get-
tysburg to bless those brave soldiers 
who had fallen in what was the blood-
iest battle in U.S. history up to that 
point. The ‘‘last full measure of devo-
tion’’ remark has always resonated 
with me, as it does with so many 
Americans, but Lincoln had another 
message in his address. He said, ‘‘It is 
for us the living, rather, to be dedi-
cated here to the unfinished work 
which they who fought here have thus 
far so nobly advanced.’’ 
Even in moments of mourning, Lin-
coln charged those still standing to re-
dedicate themselves to the hard work 
of preserving our Nation’s integrity, 
protecting our fundamental freedoms, 
and building our families’ security and 
prosperity. In a time of great division, 
this was no small task, and it today re-
mains one of our urgent and most sol-
emn tasks. 
The year after the Gettysburg Ad-
dress, the women of Boalsburg, PA, 
began a tradition that would carry on 
for generations. They gathered to-
gether to decorate the gravestones of 
their loved ones who had gone to God. 
They wanted to reach beyond the pain 
to show their fathers, husbands, broth-
ers, and sons that their memories en-
dure in the hearts and minds of the liv-
ing. Honoring the spirit and sacrifice of 
our military and veterans isn’t just 
about isolated days of commemoration 
on Veterans Day and Memorial Day 
each year, it is about the work we do 
every day to be worthy of their valor, 
as my father used to say. 
As we discuss a potential U.S. with-
drawal from Afghanistan, combat the 
resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East, 
exercise oversight over other U.S. mili-
tary engagements overseas, and look to 
resolve increasingly complicated global 
crises, we must not forget those who 
have given the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to our country, particularly in 
the most recent wars. The numbers are 
important: 7034 Americans have lost 
their lives in the wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, with an additional 7 killed 
in African Command operations since 
2001. This includes 300 servicemembers 
from Pennsylvania—the fifth highest 
toll of any State. Over 53,000 have been 
wounded, including more than 2,000 
from Pennsylvania. Although this ad-
ministration refuses to be transparent 
in its deployment tracking, press re-
ports indicate that approximately 7,500 
Americans are currently serving in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, with an addi-
tional 65,000 serving in the Persian Gulf 
and Saudi Arabia. 
This year, for the first time in nearly 
two decades, Pennsylvania did not lose 
any servicemembers abroad. While I 
am grateful Pennsylvania did not suf-
fer losses this year, this milestone only 
serves as a reminder of the grim toll 
that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq 
have taken on the Commonwealth and 
the Nation. As families of fallen serv-
icemembers continue to mourn, we 
must reconsider the nature of our mili-
tary commitments overseas and recom-
mit to ensuring those who serve are 
taken care of. 
These fighting men and women were 
born into families, not into divisions 
and brigades. They are sons and daugh-
ters, husbands and wives, fathers and 
mothers. Their love for their families 
is matched only by their devotion to 
our country. 
But many more bear the scars of war. 
Some families have a loved one who 
served in Iraq or Afghanistan and re-
turned home but was one of the 53,250 
wounded. And we must not overlook 
the unusually high percentage of Iraq 
and Afghanistan veterans who have 
died since returning home, whether 
from drug overdose or suicide. Thou-
sands of American families continue to 
pay a terrible price for the courage and 
dedication of their family members 
who gave life and limb for this country. 
As we look to a new year and a new 
Congress, I am reminded of the mo-
ments 
when 
policymakers 
reached 
across the aisle, putting partisan dif-
ferences aside to implement ideas that 
best served the American people. We 
can think about the establishment of 
the first system of State veterans 
homes after the Civil War, enactment 
of the GI bill after World War II, cre-
ation of the modern, Cabinet-level De-
partment of Veterans Affairs under 
President Reagan, all required fore-
sight and courage to see come to fru-
ition. The year ahead provides an op-
portunity for further bipartisan co-
operation in service of our veterans 
and our men and women in uniform. 
Each of us, those who have served 
and those who haven’t, must be a part 
of the effort toward healing. We can 
meet today’s challenges with the spirit 
of the women in Boalsburg so many 
years ago, to remember our past and 
keep working towards our future. We 
can continue our work here in Wash-
ington, in Pennsylvania, and across the 
Nation, to ensure we are worthy of the 
valor of the men and women we com-
memorate today. I call on my col-
leagues in the Senate to reflect every 
day on the sacrifice of those who came 
before us. 
As another year comes to a close, we 
remember and honor those who have 
laid down their lives for this great Na-
tion. God bless them.

TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DOUG 
JONES’ STAFF 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, as I men-
tioned in my farewell speech last week, 
I also wanted to spend a few final mo-
ments here on the Senate floor hon-
oring my incredible staff. As the first 
Democrat elected to the Senate from 
Alabama in two decades, I had no idea 
how many brilliant young folks would 
want to come work in my offices, but 
we were absolutely overwhelmed with 
the talent my election attracted—and 
not just from Alabama—we had appli-
cants from all over the country. We of 
course tried to give priority to folks 
from Alabama, but we did have a few 
from other States who brought special 
expertise and who, after just a short 
time with us, became honorary Ala-
bamians. 
Some of my staff came from other 
Senate or House offices where they had 
been biding their time, hoping 1 day to 
work for an Alabama Democratic Sen-
ator. Their experience was critical. 
Some staff members brought no legis-
lative experience at all, but they were 
quick and eager learners and got up to 
speed unbelievably fast. What they all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7937 
December 21, 2020 
had in common was a deep and sincere 
commitment to doing the right thing 
for the right reasons. 
There were very few shortcuts and 
very few easy decisions, but we all 
worked hard to understand the issues 
backwards and forwards and to do our 
best for the people of Alabama and for 
our country. Although each member of 
the staff was acutely aware that I 
would have to stand for reelection in 
just 3 short years, they were as com-
mitted as I was to not let political con-
siderations enter into our delibera-
tions. Instead we focused on the needs 
of our constituents, big and small, and 
doing all we could to make sure those 
needs were met. 
Over the past 3 years, we have be-
come a family, and we have had some 
fun to boot. Equally important, we 
have gotten things done. We led or 
coled over 20 bipartisan bills that were 
signed into law. We mustered enough 
support to finally repeal the Widow’s 
Tax. We secured permanent Federal 
funding for HBCUs and minority-serv-
ing institutions. We made things easier 
for folks applying for Federal student 
loans. We secured authorizations and 
appropriations for hundreds of millions 
of dollars in funding for defense-related 
projects in Alabama. We set up a proc-
ess to collect and make available to 
the public the Federal records from un-
solved civil rights crimes. We com-
pleted 2,094 requests for casework help 
and responded to hundreds of thou-
sands of calls, letters, and emails from 
Alabama constituents. We submitted 
624 letters in support of Alabamians’ 
grant 
applications, 
resulting 
in 
$270,973,411 in awards for municipali-
ties, nonprofits, colleges and univer-
sities, rural fire departments, health 
centers, and others. Out of the out-
standing high school seniors who I 
nominated to our military service 
academies, 44 have received appoint-
ments, and that is in just our first 2 
years alone; we won’t know the results 
for 2020 until next spring. We did more 
than 1,000 interviews, speeches, town-
halls, and events across the State of 
Alabama and in DC. None of these 
things, absolutely none of them, would 
have been possible without the hard 
work and unflagging dedication of my 
staff. 
My time in the U.S. Senate was en-
hanced immeasurably by the tangible 
and intangible contributions of my 
staff. As I said earlier, we knew we 
only had 3 years guaranteed, and we 
made the most of it. From our amazing 
record of legislative accomplishments, 
to our warm and welcoming office cul-
ture, to our emphasis on bipartisanship 
and collegiality, we made a positive 
difference, and I am immensely proud 
to have served with each of them. 
Although it is impossible to go 
through the contributions of each I do 
want to single out a few who really 
made the office click or were respon-
sible in some way for a major accom-
plishment. 
First is my chief of staff Dana Gresh-
am. Dana came to me by way of the 
House and then the Department of 
Transportation. He has always been a 
leader, and for me, I was so proud to 
have him as the first African-American 
chief of staff for a Democratic Senator. 
He was instrumental in building the 
staff and guiding the delicate nature of 
Beltway and Alabama politics. 
My legislative director Mark Libell 
brought a level of experience and direc-
tion to our legislative team that I 
think is unmatched in the Senate. He 
brought a level of skill to the legisla-
tive process that is largely responsible 
for the many successes we had. 
Katie Campbell doubled as the dep-
uty legislative director and legislative 
assistant on our healthcare related 
matters. She brought a tremendous 
amount of knowledge and was thus a 
tremendous resource for our healthcare 
agenda, which was always one of my 
top priorities. 
On the Banking Committee, I was 
fortunate to have Mike Berman for a 
couple of years before he moved into 
the private sector. Mike began the 
painstaking process of revising the 
country’s 
money 
laundering 
laws 
which his successor on the staff, 
Lauren 
Oppenheimer, 
picked 
up. 
Thanks to their combined efforts and 
working with colleagues and various 
stakeholders and regulators, Congress 
passed as part of the NDAA an update 
to our money laundering laws for the 
first time in decades. 
My friend of 20 years Cissy Jackson 
came to Washington after practicing 
law with me in Birmingham. She had 
no legislative experience but soon be-
came a rockstar among the Senate 
staff on both sides of the aisle, first 
with the Homeland Security Com-
mittee and then as my MLA on the 
Armed Services Committee. So much 
of what we were able to secure for the 
people of Alabama in the NDAA is a di-
rect result of Cissy’s tireless and per-
sistent efforts. 
Rebecca Howard handled education 
policy for me. Through her efforts, we 
secured 
additional 
and 
permanent 
funding for HBCUs, as well as the suc-
cess in simplifying the FAFSA form, 
which will allow so many kids in Ala-
bama to receive a college education. 
She also coordinated the annual HBCU 
symposiums that we conducted each 
year. 
The director of my State staff was 
Brantley Fry. Brantley made sure that 
I stayed incredibly busy when I was at 
home. We traveled from one end of the 
State to the other. We visited busi-
nesses, military installations, schools, 
and farms. She coordinated the town-
halls and roundtables, all with an eye 
to the important issues facing the 
State. 
Heather Fluit was my communica-
tions director and she did tremendous 
work keeping the people of Alabama up 
to speed on all the good work that we 
were doing in Washington and around 
the State. This could be a difficult job 
at times on weedy issues like money 
laundering, but Heather excelled. 
I could not conclude these remarks, 
however, without once again noting 
what was one of my proudest moments 
in the Senate when we successfully 
eliminated the Military Widow’s Tax. 
It took a tremendous amount of effort 
and persistence in making that legisla-
tion a reality, and so much of the cred-
it goes to Sarah Kate Sullivan in my 
office. Like me and my colleague Sen-
ator COLLINS, Sarah Kate never gave 
up, and today, so many military fami-
lies will benefit from her efforts. 
My wife Louise and I thank each of

bottom of our hearts. We love them all

very best in their future careers:

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RICHARD RONALD 
KNOCK 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise to 
honor the passing of a great Ken-
tuckian, Richard Ronald Knock, or 
Dick, as he was known to his friends 
and family. He died December 8, 2020, 
at the age of 82. 
Dick was born June 28, 1938 in Cold 
Spring, KY. Dick’s name was always 
mentioned with high praise. He was 
valued in his community, as he was 
known to lend a helping hand when 
needed and provided a thoughtful ear 
when spoken to. Mr. Knock came from 
a humble upbringing, but through his 
own deeds, he rose to the pinnacle of 
his profession, being a respected mem-
ber of many institutions, including as 
CEO of Knock Investments; CEO of 
Omaha Enterprises; through his service 
on the Board of Trustees at University 
of the Cumberlands; and as chairman of 
Board of Commissioners for the Boone 
County Water District. 
Dick was also an active political pun-
dit within his community. His commit-
ment to freedom was unmatched, and 
he often proved to be a great source of 
wisdom for elected leaders such as my-
self. Dick worked tirelessly in bringing 
Republicans throughout the Common-
wealth together in the name of free-
dom. I can recall during my first elec-
tion he opened his house for an event 
that featured my predecessor, Senator 
Jim Bunning, that helped unify Repub-
licans in a critical area of our State. A 
picture from that event hangs in my 
Washington office to this day. With his 
passing, we have lost one of our bright-
est and loudest freedom fighters, but, 
as Dick would want, the voices of lib-
erty will remain loud and clear. 
While we share in the great sadness 
of his passing, it with great joy we look 
back 
at 
his 
life, 
his 
many 
accopmlishments, and the positive im-
pact he had on his community and 
Kentuckians 
across 
the 
Common-
wealth. We honor Dick and his family, 
and may he rest in peace.∑ 
f 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ACADEMY OF ART MINISTRIES 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, today I would like to take a 
moment 
to 
recognize 
a 
milestone 
achievement for a ministry in my 
State. The Academy of Arts Ministries 
is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 
South Carolina on January 8, 2021. This 
ministry has trained thousands of stu-
dents in the arts and sent them out in 
their local communities to share the 
Good News about God through their 
art. 
Its founder, Dr. Nicky Chavers, has 
dedicated the last 50 years to giving 
young people a safe avenue to be cre-
ative through the Logos Theatre, na-
tion-wide traveling ministries, a pro-
fessional film company and more. The 
young people in my great state of 
South Carolina have truly benefited 
from the sacrifices of Dr. Chavers and 
the entire team at the Academy of Art 
Ministries.∑

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 2726. Mr. SCOTT of Florida pro-
posed an amendment to the resolution 
S. Res. 625, affirming the benefits of 
‘‘Buying American’’; as follows: 
Strike all after the resolving clause and in-
sert the following: ‘‘That— 
(1) it is the policy of the United States 
Government to ‘‘Buy American’’ products for 
public use when fiscally and reasonably pos-
sible, in accordance with the Buy American 
Act of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.); and 
(2) the Senate supports American manufac-
turing and strengthening our American man-
ufacturing base. 
SA 2727. Mr. SCOTT of Florida pro-
posed an amendment to the resolution 
S. Res. 625, affirming the benefits of 
‘‘Buying American’’; as follows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on July 15, 2019, President Donald 
J. Trump signed Executive Order 13881 titled 
‘‘Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, 
Products, and Materials’’ (84 Fed. Reg. 34257), 
which would enforce the Buy American Act 
of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) to the greatest 
extent permitted by law; 
Whereas, the Buy American Act of 1933 re-
quires Federal agencies to procure materials 
and products domestically— 
(1) when the materials are intended for 
public use within the United States; and 
(2) when the materials to be procured (or 
the materials from which they are manufac-
tured) are present in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commer-
cial quantities of a satisfactory quality; 
Whereas American-made products are de-
veloped under United States’ regulations and 
undergo testing to ensure their compliance 
with United States’ safety standards, which 
are among the highest standards in the 
world; 
Whereas American-made products are pro-
duced by workers earning competitive wages 
and working in safe working conditions; 
Whereas purchasing American-made prod-
ucts supports the producers of those prod-
ucts and their communities; 
Whereas, according to the Manufacturing 
Institute, each dollar spent in sales of manu-
factured products supports $1.33 in output 
from other sectors of the economy; 
Whereas, according to the Manufacturers 
Alliance for Productivity and Innovation 
Foundation, for every full-time job in manu-
facturing, there are 3.4 full-time equivalent 
jobs created in non-manufacturing indus-
tries; 
Whereas, according to a 2017 poll conducted 
by Reuters and Ipsos, when buying products, 
nearly 70 percent of Americans find it impor-
tant that the products they buy were made 
in the United States; 
Whereas strengthening American manufac-
turing supports employment in the United 
States, produces innovation and the seeds for 
future industries, and supports the global 
competitiveness of the United States; 
Whereas a strong American manufacturing 
base is an important component in helping 
to revitalize the United States economy as it 
recovers from the global COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas a strong domestic supply chain 
for certain goods and close cooperation with 
trusted allies can support national security 
and public safety; 
Whereas the global COVID–19 pandemic 
presented significant challenges for the glob-
ally interconnected supply chain of medical 
products and has heightened the need for 
supply chain security of a variety of critical 
materials and products; and 
Whereas, regarding the manufacturing of 
critical medical supplies and products essen-
tial to national security, national stockpiles 
and a healthy domestic industrial base would 
help handle any future surge in need for 
these supplies: Now, therefore, be it 
SA 2728. Mr. SCOTT of Florida pro-
posed an amendment to the resolution 
S. Res. 625, affirming the benefits of 
‘‘Buying American’’; as follows: 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A resolu-
tion affirming the benefits of ‘Buying Amer-
ican’.’’. 
SA 2729. Mr. CORNYN (for Mrs. 
FISCHER) proposed an amendment to 
the bill S. 371, to provide regulatory re-
lief to charitable organizations that 
provide housing assistance, and for 
other purposes; as follows:

sert the following:

IN RECOGNITION OF RALEIGH 
BALDERSON’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Mr. 
Raleigh 
Gilbert 
Balderson, in honor of his 90th Birthday on 
December 19, 2020. I would like to take this 
time to recognize the many achievements of 
Mr. Balderson, as well as commemorate this 
special occasion in his life. 
Mr. Raleigh Balderson is a resident of my 
hometown, Montross, Virginia. He is a very 
well-respected citizen and barber in the town 
of Montross, and he is known and loved by 
the entire community. He has served as a 
deacon and trustee at Nomini Baptist Church 
and is currently a deacon emeritus, a testa-
ment to his strong involvement in the commu-
nity and care for those he knows and loves. 
This year marks a second major milestone 
for Mr. Balderson, as he retired from his own 
barber business on March 21, 2020. Mr. 
Balderson 
started 
his 
own 
business 
in 
Montross, Virginia, and recently retired after 
62 years of being in business. Mr. Balderson’s 
barbershop in Montross is well loved by the 
entire community and is known for a place of 
good company and great conversations. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me today to honor and celebrate Mr. 
Raleigh Gilbert Balderson’s 90th Birthday on 
December 19, 2020. I would like to also rec-
ognize and remember the late Bonnie Jean 
Owen Balderson, Mr. Balderson’s beloved wife 
of 59 years. I wish Mr. Balderson a happy 
90th birthday, and I hope this time is filled with 
celebration and God’s continued blessings.

the vote on H.R. 3384, the MORE Act on De-
cember 4, 2020 to leave to care for a sick

IN RECOGNITION OF GARY 
JOHNSON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Gary Johnson, Assist-
ant Manager for the City of Roanoke, Texas, 
as he retires from a career spanning almost 
four decades in public service. 
Prior to his work for the City of Roanoke in 
2003, Chief Johnson served the City of 
Watauga’s Department of Public Safety for 
more than two decades, from 1982 to 2003. 
His tenure at Watauga DPS included several 
positions including Detective, Paramedic, Fire 
Fighter, SWAT Team Leader, Patrol Com-
mander, and Deputy Chief. During this period, 
the agency was a totally integrated public 
safety department with all personnel cross- 
trained in the areas of law enforcement, fire 
suppression, and emergency medical services. 
Chief Johnson joined Roanoke’s Police De-
partment as Chief in 2003. Under his leader-
ship, the Roanoke Police Department became 
one of the best in the state, achieving the 
Texas Police Chief’s Best Practices Recogni-
tion in 2011, a highly respected accomplish-
ment requiring meeting 168 standards. This 
recognition has been repeated every four 
years since and is one of many achievements 
that led to the addition of his role as Assistant 
City Manager in 2016, with responsibility over 
Police and Fire Services and special projects. 
In 2018 Mr. Johnson transitioned to assume 
full responsibility as an Assistant City Man-
ager, providing invaluable administrative input 
on operations, budgets, personnel policies and 
other support critical to the City Manager’s Of-
fice. He also carried responsibility for many 
major City initiatives, including the role of 
Project Manager for the New City Hall facility, 
the implementation of the Roanoke Citizen’s 
Academy and many others. His departmental 
direct reports included the Police Department, 
Fire Department, Informational Technology, 
Special Projects, Solid Waste Services, and 
City Hall facilities. 
A graduate of both Dallas Baptist University 
and having completed a Master of Public Ad-
ministration from the University of North 
Texas, Denton, Chief Johnson is also a grad-
uate of the F.B.I. National Academy; 207th 
Session. Beyond his duties with the City of 
Roanoke, he was also active within his profes-
sion as a member of the F.B.I. National Acad-
emy Associates, the International Association 
of Chiefs of Police, and the Texas Police 
Chiefs Association, which he served as Presi-
dent in 2018. 
Through his decades of service in Public 
Safety and City Management, Gary Johnson’s 
effort and leadership have created a legacy 
represented in the quality of life citizens of Ro-
anoke and the other communities enjoy in the 
communities he has served. I wish him and 
his wife, Sherrill, his daughters and family, all 
the joy and satisfaction deserved in a well- 
earned retirement from a life of public service. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE LEGACY 
OF SHERIFF MICHAEL J. ASHE, JR. 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, it is with great 
satisfaction that I rise today to recognize the 
remarkable career of retired Hampden County 
Sheriff Michael J. Ashe, Jr. Sheriff Ashe, in a 
career spanning over four decades, has cre-
ated the model of rehabilitating inmates across 
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the 
country. A native of my hometown of Spring-
field, Massachusetts, Sheriff Ashe has spent 
his life embodying the fundamental principle 
that all who are willing to work for a second 
chance, ought to receive one. His signature 
philosophy of ‘‘strength reinforced with de-
cency; firmness dignified in fairness’’ led to 
countless lives being changed for the better, 
while resulting in one of the lowest reincarcer-
ation rates in the United States. 
Originally a social worker, Sheriff Ashe 
sought to provide long-term care and housing 
to the youth who were most in need of it. 
Serving as the first Assistant Director of Dow-
ney Side homes for the youth, Mike Ashe dis-
played remarkable leadership by being the 
first to welcome to his home battered or at-risk 
children, a reminder that no member of the 
community shall be forgotten. His commitment 
to those who are often forgotten in society led 
to his candidacy for Sheriff of Hampden Coun-
ty. Since his initial election in 1974, Ashe was 
re-elected every 6 years without contest until 
he announced his retirement in 2016. 
Anyone who has gotten to know Sheriff 
Ashe will affirm that he had never been in the 
business of incarceration, rather his focus was 
on corrections. His doctrine on correctional su-
pervision was guided by the simple principle 
that inmates should be held accountable and 
be positive and productive. The Sheriff long 
understood that if he were to adequately reha-
bilitate his inmates, he would need to put to-
gether a competent coalition of staff and vol-
unteers who could command the situation, 
while 
exemplifying 
the 
upmost 
profes-
sionalism. 
Sheriff Ashe instituted an inmate Basic In-
tensive Regimen in which all inmates are re-
quired to undergo during their first 5 weeks of 
incarceration. During this critical time, inmates 
are required to participate in programs that 
focus on substance abuse, anger manage-
ment, cognitive thinking, victim impact, and 
more. In Hampden County, it is excepted that 
inmates work on assignments or some sort of 
productive activity, for at least 40 hours per 
week. With over 140 programs available, in-
mates are encouraged to famously ‘‘answer 
the bell’’ for a productive day, just like they will 
have to do if they are to be productive citi-
zens. 
Under his leadership, Hampden County was 
home to the nation’s first Day Reporting Cen-
ter, the first program of its kind to offer support

for inmates close to re-entering society. A 
model that has been replicated throughout the 
country. Similarly, Sheriff Ashe was respon-
sible for the nation’s first Incarceration Support 
Systems, offering assistance to those newly 
freed from incarceration. And if that wasn’t 
enough, Sheriff Ashe helped construct the 
Western Massachusetts Correctional Addic-
tions Center, one of the nation’s original cor-
rectional facilities dedicated to substance 
abuse treatment. 
Throughout his career, Sheriff Ashe’s tire-
less work has made our community a safer, 
more just, caring place. During his tenure, 
Sheriff Ashe witnessed over 4,600 inmates 
graduate his educational programs, earning a 
GED or a high school equivalent diploma. 
While Mike Ashe oversaw his inmates con-
tribute over 1 million hours of community serv-
ice to Hampden County communities. While 
heading the Massachusetts Sheriffs Associa-
tion, Ashe was able to present his successful 
philosophy for community corrections to the 
rest of the Commonwealth, further promoting 
an emphasis on rehabilitation rather than pun-
ishment. A recipient of the White House 
‘‘Champions of Change’’ Award, Sheriff Ashe 
has made the Commonwealth proud while il-
lustrating through his work, that the United 
States is indeed a nation of second chances.

DALE SCHMITZ 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Dale Schmitz, WWII 
Veteran who served with the 115th Cavalry. 
Mr. Schmitz not only served his country honor-
ably; he is a grandfather and a man of integ-
rity that has committed to serve his commu-
nity. On December 22nd, Mr. Schmitz will turn 
100 years old. On this day, Adams County will 
proclaim, ‘‘Dale Schmitz Day’’, honoring his six 
years of service to our country and commit-
ment to his family and community. 
After his service with the 115th Calvary in 
World War II, Mr. Schmitz took a job with 
Eaton Metals in Denver, CO, staying with the 
company until the 1980’s. During this time, Mr. 
Schmitz continued his service to the commu-
nity by helping the Guardian Angels Catholic 
School in the Berkley neighborhood with main-
tenance work. Mr. Schmitz was an active vol-
unteer for Habitat for Humanity until the age of 
95 and continues to give back to Veterans 
through organizations like the Wounded War-
rior Project. At the age of 97, Mr. Schmitz flew 
to Washington, D.C. by himself with the, 
‘‘Rocky Mountain Honor Flight Program’’, vis-
iting the memorials and landmarks that were 
dedicated to the service of WWII Veterans. 
Mr. Schmitz has been recognized by his 
community and has helped every neighbor 
through acts of service by shoveling their 
snow, mowing their grass, outdoor repairs, 
and becoming a favorite with the neighbor-
hood dogs by providing them with hot dogs. 
Mr. Schmitz was called to service when his 
country needed him, and then continued his 
service to his fellow neighbors and community. 
I want to extend my deepest appreciation and 
thanks to Mr. Schmitz for his contribution and 
service.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the work of public servant 
Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon as we 
honor his memory. 
Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Benny 
Napoleon began his law enforcement career 
working in Detroit’s police department in the 
1975. He worked his way up the ranks to 
serve as chief of police in 1998 before retiring 
in 2001. Napoleon became assistant Wayne 
County executive in 2004. In 2009, he was ap-
pointed Sheriff of Wayne County, the role he 
continued to serve in until his recent death. 
Benny Napoleon’s tenure as Wayne County 
Sheriff was marked by his work to reduce in-
mate populations, by utilizing alternatives to 
incarceration and employing electronic teth-
ering. Napoleon was well-known for his affable 
personality and big-heartedness. He is a true 
son of Detroit. His absence will be felt by the 
communities of Wayne County. 
Please join me as we recognize Wayne 
County Sheriff Benny Napoleon for his many 
contributions to Wayne County and the 13th 
Congressional District and honor his memory.

HONORING THERESA SCHUTA 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the significant con-
tributions of Theresa ‘‘Terri’’ Schuta, one of 
my closest friends as well as a true leader 
within the Buffalo Public Schools and the 
South Buffalo community she has so diligently 
served, on the occasion of her retirement as 
Principal of South Park High School. 
A proud product of the Buffalo Public 
Schools, Terri returned to the halls of the 
schools we walked together as classmates 
throughout the 1970’s as the Principal of 
Southside Elementary School for seven years 
until her appointment as South Park High 
School Principal in 2009. Rising through the 
administrative ranks, she also gained experi-
ence as the assistant principal at Lorraine Ele-
mentary. 
In the profile of Mrs. Schuta following her 
appointment, The Buffalo News headline got it 
just right when it said ‘‘Community roots an-
chor new principal to South Park,’’ Calling her-
self a neighborhood kid, Terri said, ‘‘Someone 
needs to lead South Park who loves South 
Park. I think that is going to resonate with the 
kids.’’ 
As Principal, Mrs. Schuta has more than 
resonated—she initiated, innovated and when 
necessary, intimidated, to deliver quality edu-
cational opportunities for her students, their 
families, her faculty and staff. She introduced 
new programs into her school, fought for more 
resources, stood up for her students and de-
manded more from them as well as herself to 
better prepare her students to achieve and 
succeed. 
Terri brought the same energy, enthusiasm, 
tenacity and work ethic I saw in her as our 
1978 class president with her every day as 
South Park High School Principal. She led the 
way in building partnerships with local busi-
nesses and non-profits and now as a des-
ignated Community School, South Park stu-
dents and their families benefit from enhanced 
learning opportunities, parent engagement and 
healthy living experiences. She has been a 
source of positive change in the city’s edu-
cation system as a whole and has impacted 
the lives of both her students and colleagues. 
Terri’s enormous contribution to South Park 
High School has not gone unnoticed. In fact, 
she has been recognized for fostering ac-
countability in the high school, which resulted 
in a 10 percent increase in its graduation rate 
over the past several years. She also pio-
neered the Bright Lights of South Park pro-
gram. This project highlights successful South 
Park graduates as a source of inspiration for 
current students. Students can then use that 
inspiration as motivation for their academic 
work and to live up to their full potential. She 
oversaw the well-received and extensive build-
ing renovation project, the successful 100th 
Anniversary Celebration including the 2016 re-
lease of ‘‘Our Fallen Warriors, Remembered,’’ 
a timeline of more than 150 of our bravest 
during their experiences as South Park stu-
dents through their loss of life in service to our 
country. 
Amazingly, Terri has always found time for 
others as she is an active and passionate 
community volunteer. Terri was awarded the 
organization’s Campaign Volunteer of the Year 
award in 2019 in recognition of outstanding 
commitment to the United Way. Her profes-
sional achievements and personal contribu-
tions earned her well-deserved recognition as 
one of 42 extraordinary women featured in the 
book, ‘‘Women in The City of Good Neigh-
bors.’’ 
Her work with United Way, local charities 
and families in need has positively impacted 
and inspired so many individuals as she per-
sonifies the values of faith, friendship and 
service others instilled in her as a member of 
the Drilling Family of Lilac Street. She and her 
husband, Michael Schuta, a retired Buffalo Po-
lice Officer, continue that tradition of service 
with their daughter, Katie, who has followed in 
Terri’s footsteps as the principal of the Buffalo 
Public Schools’ school of culinary arts and 
management. Katie and husband, Jonathon 
Whiteside, have recently had a son, Joseph 
Michael Whiteside, adding proud grandmother 
to Terri’s many titles. Their son, Michael, holds 
an MBA and works as a senior accountant at 
PCB Piezotronics in Cheektowaga, New York. 
Madam Speaker, I am so proud of all Terri 
Schuta has accomplished, the indelible mark 
she has made in uplifting the lives of her

HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude 
to serve as the Chairman of the Republican 
Study Committee’s National Security and For-
eign Affairs Task Force this Congress. In 
June, the Task Force issued its National Se-
curity Strategy report after convening a num-
ber of meetings with top policy experts and 
engaging in complex discussions on the for-
eign policy challenges we face. The RSC’s 
National Security Strategy spans over 120 
pages and includes over 100 detailed policy 
recommendations on tackling the Chinese 
Communist Party, Russia, Iran, and the Salafi- 
jihadi movement, and for standing up for de-
mocracy and human rights. The report boldly 
stood up for a foreign policy of American lead-
ership through the principle of peace through 
strength. It was also noticed and condemned 
by adversaries such as the Chinese Com-
munist Party, the Kremlin, and the Chief of 
Staff of the President of the Iranian regime. In 
only a few months a number of the report’s 
ideas have already been implemented by the 
Trump Administration, or have been intro-
duced as legislation. For example just last 
week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo an-
nounced that the United Front Work Depart-
ment of the Chinese Communist Party would 
be sanctioned, something first proposed by 
the RSC Task Force report. This month also, 
RSC members introduced six bills taking on 
China for it’s IP theft, Rep. JACK BERGMAN in-
troduced a bill to audit U.S. contributions to 
the United Nations, and I was grateful to intro-
duce the Badr Organization Designation Act, 
and the Stop the Killing in Syria Act, both 
based upon the National Security Strategy re-
port. 
I am grateful for the leadership of my col-
leagues on the Task Force including RSC 
Chairman Rep. MIKE
JOHNSON, Rep. ROB 
WHITMAN, Rep. DON BACON, Rep. ANN WAG-
NER, Rep. DAN CRENSHAW, Rep. RALPH NOR-
MAN, Rep. BRYAN STEIL, Rep. ALEX MOONEY, 
Rep. JACK BERGMAN, Rep. NEAL DUNN, Rep. 
CLAY HIGGINS, and Rep. MICHAEL WALTZ. 
I appreciate the hard work of Omar Hossino 
of the RSC staff in managing the Task Force’s 
meetings, developing policy recommendations, 
and writing the report. I am grateful for Omar 
Hossino’s dedication and service to the Task 
Force. Omar Hossino has been a key advisor 
and invaluable asset on foreign policy issues 
not only to members of the Task Force but 
also to the broader RSC. His vast knowledge 
of the intricacies of both complex foreign pol-
icy issues as well as the intricacies of legisla-
tion, especially economic sanctions has been 
invaluable to me and Task Force members. 
Omar Hossino’s passion and tireless work 
ethic has also been a driving force behind 
turning the report into legislative initiatives. Fi-
nally, I would like to recognize my Legislative 
Director Oren Adaki of my staff for his deep 
dedication and important contributions to this 
project as well.

HONORING JUDITH PAXTON 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Judith Junkin Brown 
Paxton of Salem, Virginia, who passed away 
on December 7, 2020 at the age of 90. She 
was a pillar of the Salem community who 
served her fellow citizens as a volunteer and 
good neighbor. 
Judy Brown was born on September 9, 
1930 in Roanoke, Virginia, to Elijah Brazelton 
Brown and Martha Judith Junkin Brown. She 
graduated from Andrew Lewis High School in 
1948. 
Her family, church, and community were the 
objects of her activity and energy. As a mem-
ber of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, she sang 
in the choir for 70 years, directed the chil-
dren’s choir, served on the Vestry, read to the 
children at St. Anne’s Day School, and per-
formed numerous other services for the con-
gregation. She also volunteered at the office 
for the Episcopal Diocese of Southwest Vir-
ginia. Her compassion and faith inspired her 
work as a coordinator for the St. Paul’s volun-
teers who serve lunches for the Roanoke Area 
Ministries. 
As her friends and neighbors, the people of 
Salem enjoyed Judy’s goodwill and hospitality. 
She cooked chili for the crews of the Street 
Department as they cleared snow, organized 
decorating of lampposts for Christmas, and 
put up flags for Independence Day. From pro-
gressive dinners to bridge games, the activi-
ties of Salem were brightened by Judy’s 
friendliness and generosity. 
Judy was married to the late William Joseph 
Paxton Jr., who served as Salem’s City Man-
ager. She is survived by sons W. David 
Paxton and his wife Vicki of Roanoke, Joseph 
Paxton and his wife Annette of Broadway, Vir-
ginia, and James Paxton and his wife Hilda of 
Salem; daughter Martha Paxton Nowlin and 
her husband Melvin of Big Island, Virginia; 
brother William O’Brien and his wife Ellie of 
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina; and sister-in-law 
June Newman Paxton of Roanoke. She is also 
survived by ten grandchildren and their 
spouses Corey (Danielle) Paxton, Traci (Matt) 
Rowe, Jessica (Scott) Mackaro, Katie (Marc) 
Palmieri, Jennifer Paxton, Sara (Greg) Hall, 
William (Brittany) Paxton, Theresa (Michael)

HONORING CHEN LOK LEE 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an influential and dedicated man, Chen 
Lok Lee. Mr. Lee was a devoted educator and 
prominent printmaker and painter based in 
Philadelphia, PA. For over twenty years, he 
was a Professor of Printmaking, Silkscreen 
and Lithography at Moore College of Art and 
Design in Philadelphia, which is the first and 
only visual arts college for women in the 
United States. Additionally, he taught Chinese 
calligraphy and painting classes to the com-
munity through the Community College of 
Philadelphia and other private venues. 
Mr. Lee was a political refugee from China 
who escaped narrowly with his life from com-
munist forces in 1950 and was forced to leave 
his family behind. When his life was in jeop-
ardy, his family helped him escape, and he 
swam towards Hong Kong and was rescued 
by a boat and eventually taken to the shores 
of Hong Kong. He stayed in Hong Kong for 
eight years, studying at the prestigious Hong 
Kong University, and then went on to enter the 
United States as a political refugee in 1959. 
He settled in New York City’s Chinatown and 
worked his way through the Chinese res-
taurant business to support himself as a bur-
geoning artist and to learn enough English to 
establish footing in his new country. He also 
began to study under some very prominent 
and contemporary artists. While at the Arts 
Students’ League in New York, he worked 
with George Grosz, Stephen Greene and Rob-
ert Hale, along with New York painter Hans 
Hoffman. 
From 1967 to 1970 Chen Lok Lee studied 
abroad at the Rome Academy in Italy and 
earned an MFA at the Tyler School of Fine 
Arts as a printmaker, painter and lithography 
under Romas Viesulas and Richard Callner. In 
1973, he was awarded a prestigious fellowship 
from the Ford Foundation to study at Tama-
rind Lithographies in New Mexico. He was rec-
ognized at an international exhibition in Hong 
Kong, as invited by Her Majesty’s Service in 
1982. In his new adopted hometown of Phila-
delphia, he was selected to participate in the 
Mayor’s Commission for Cultural Exchange 
between Philadelphia and sister city Tianjin, 
China, from 1986 to 1987. 
Mr. Lee was a loyal and dedicated husband 
to Linda, whom he met while studying in 
Rome. Linda, also an artist and educator, 
brought Chen home to her family in Bucks 
County, Pennsylvania, and then married him

in 1973. They moved to New Mexico, and 
then Chicago, before settling back in Pennsyl-
vania where Professor Lee was hired at 
Moore College of Art and Design. 
He was the loving and devoted father to 
Romana (Cliff), whom they named after the 
city of Rome where he and Linda first met, 
son Raymond, and doting grandfather of 
Hanalee, a naturally talented artist. He raised 
his children with every devotion and detail, en-
suring they had resources, support, guidance 
and care to grow up well. He sacrificed much 
to give them a good life and the promise of fu-
tures they would be proud of. He was very 
proud of them all. 
Chen Lok Lee passed away on December 
13, 2020. Professor Lee leaves behind a leg-
acy of strength, courage, honor and devotion, 
and touched the lives of all who knew and 
loved him. 
On behalf of the 3rd Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania and the city of Philadelphia I 
extend gratitude to the late Chen Lok Lee for 
his dedicated support and service to the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania.

HONORING LIEUTENANT VEDA 
FLEETON 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Veda 
Fleeton of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) 
for her 25 years of service. The calling to be 
a peace officer is one of the highest vocations 
of public service. An individual who accepts 
this calling is worthy of the highest respect 
and honor from their community, the State, 
and our nation. 
Lieutenant Fleeton’s career with the Cali-
fornia Highway Patrol began on November 6, 
1995, and after successfully completing her 
Academy training, she reported to the East 
Los Angeles Area as a CHP officer. She was 
later assigned to the Southern Division, where 
she excelled in connecting with the public in 
her many roles. As part of the Southern Divi-
sion Recruitment Unit, she was dedicated to 
recruiting the best candidates to protect and 
serve our communities. While at Southern Di-
vision, she also contributed to the Public Infor-
mation Unit through her interactions with the 
news media and to numerous Dignitary Pro-
tection details where she provided security for 
top-level dignitaries from around the world. 
Lieutenant Fleeton also dedicated her time 
and skills to the Southern Division Background 
Investigative Unit, a temporary assignment 
that occurred during her road patrol tenure at 
Baldwin Park that began in 2003. Within this 
unit, Lieutenant Fleeton conducted thorough 
and comprehensive backgrounds for hundreds 
of applicants who were later chosen to begin 
their careers with the State highway patrol. 
Because of her deep engagement with the 
community in these assignments, Lieutenant 
Fleeton received multiple accolades for her 
hard work. 
Lieutenant Fleeton was promoted to Ser-
geant on August 1, 2007 and was assigned to 
the Morongo Basin Area, later transferring to 
Rancho Cucamonga Area. As Sergeant, she 
focused on providing her field officers with in-
valuable direction and guidance. On July 1, 
2013, Lieutenant Fleeton was promoted to 
Lieutenant and was assigned to the Santa Fe 
Springs Area for two years before transferring 
to the San Gorgonio Area. In March 2016, 
Lieutenant Fleeton was appointed Lieutenant 
Commander of the CHP’s Inland Communica-
tions Center in Fontana, where she provided 
unwavering leadership and guidance to over 
75 dispatch and Transportation Management 
Center (TMC) personnel, including the River-
side and San Bernardino County Freeway 
Service Patrol programs. Lieutenant Fleeton’s 
unequivocal passion to mentor and develop 
field officers shined throughout all these roles. 
Lieutenant Fleeton officially retired from her 
service with California Highway Patrol on No-
vember 17, 2020. For her remarkable accom-
plishments and 25 years of commitment to 
public service as a peace officer in the greater 
Inland Empire, it is my honor to recognize 
Lieutenant Veda Fleeton on this day.

HONORING KATHRIN (KATE) SEARS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Kathrin (Kate) Sears for 
her outstanding career in public service as 
Marin County’s District 3 Supervisor. 
Kate has been a resident of Southern Marin 
for most of her life, and it is the place where 
she developed the principled values that have 
guided her private and public careers. 
She earned a bachelor’s degree in Asian 
studies at Carleton College in Minnesota, a 
master’s degree in Chinese studies at the Uni-
versity of Washington, a doctorate in political 
science from the University of Michigan, and a 
law degree from Harvard University. In 2005, 
after working as an attorney in a private prac-
tice for 16 years, Kate joined the Consumer 
Law Section of the California Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office. In 2011 Governor Jerry Brown 
appointed Kate to the Marin County Board of 
Supervisors after the heartbreaking death of 
Charles McGlashan. She was reelected in 
2012 and 2016. 
Throughout her tenure on the Board of Su-
pervisors, Kate represented the residents of 
Marin, its renowned public lands and the envi-
ronment with passion and skill. She worked to 
improve public transportation, strengthen serv-
ices for older adults, and increase affordable 
housing opportunities. Kate has helped to plan 
and implement key Marin initiatives including 
Bay WAVE and Drawdown: Marin. As Chair of 
Marin Clean Energy, Kate worked to develop 
energy efficiency programs and expanded 
electric vehicle charging stations in Marin. 
From Angel Island to Muir Woods, Kate has 
also fought for Marin’s parks and open 
spaces. I am proud to have worked with her 
to find compromise in resolving community 
issues, including through the Muir Woods 
Parking Reservation System. 
Kate is a champion for the people and 
places of Marin County and leaves an appre-
ciable legacy as she retires from the Board of 
Supervisors. Madam Speaker, I respectfully 
ask that you join me in honoring Kate for an 
accomplished tenure, and extend to her best 
wishes in her future endeavors.

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to echo the words of my Texas 
friend and colleague, Mr. WEBER, to support 
the reintroduction of H.R. 768, the ‘‘Keeping 
America’s Energy Resources Moving Act’’. 
This is vital legislation needed to support a 
vital industry, the U.S. lightering industry. In 
turn, this legislation will support our domestic 
refining industry and its workers and help sup-
port U.S. energy security and independence. It 
is a small technical fix to the law that will allow 
seafarers aboard lightering vessels to continue 
to do the vital work they do—import and ex-
port crude oil and natural gas to and from our 
refineries in Texas and the Gulf Coast, Dela-
ware and Southern California. We have bipar-
tisan support for the legislation and the ap-
proval of the agencies who will administer and 
implement this legislation when it becomes 
law. As my colleague Mr. WEBER has said, we 
simply ran out of time to move the bill—but we 
will continue our efforts and press forward in 
the next Congress. I thank my colleagues for 
their support of this legislation and look for-
ward to enacting this important technical fix in 
the next Congress.

HONORING HYNDMAN VOLUNTEER 
FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF RON-
ALD ALLEN SPIKER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Hyndman Volunteer Fire Department Chief 
Ronald Allen Spiker, who passed away on De-
cember 1, 2020. 
Chief Spiker selflessly served the Hyndman 
Volunteer Fire Department for 30 years. He 
also was an EMR for the Hyndman Rescue 
Squad. For this work, he gained a reputation 
as a man who was always willing to offer help 
to anyone who needed it. Chief Spiker also 
generously invested time in teaching and men-
toring younger firefighters. 
In addition to his service as fire chief, Chief 
Spiker was a truck driver for his entire profes-
sional life and worked at Croner Inc., New En-
terprise Stone and Lime, and Rice Tire. He 
was also a member of the Kennells Mill 
Sportsmen’s Club and the National Rifle Asso-
ciation.

HONORING 
THE 
65TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CHARLES HOUS-
TON BAR ASSOCIATION 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Charles Houston Bar 
Association (CHBA) and their 65 years of 
service throughout California’s 13th congres-
sional district and the country. 
CHBA was originally founded in 1955 as the 
Charles Houston Law Club and was named in 
honor of the groundbreaking lawyer and edu-
cator, Charles Hamilton Houston. Bearing his 
name, CHBA continues to uphold his legacy 
by fighting for racial equality and social 
change. 
Located in Oakland, California, The Charles 
Houston Bar Association has been a driving 
force promoting diversity in the legal profes-
sion and advocating against racial injustice. 
In 1975, The California State Bar’s Board of 
Governors recognized the Charles Houston 
Bar Association as an official state bar asso-
ciation. The CHBA is also an affiliate member 
of the National Bar Association (NBA) and the 
California 
Association 
of 
Black 
Lawyers 
(CABL). 
The CHBA has been a continuous source of 
legal advocacy in the African American com-
munity. Their focus on protecting the legal 
rights of the people has kept them on the 
precipice of change. 
During the early 1980’s CHBA partnered 
with the California Association of Black Law-
yers to criminalize the KKK. Through their ef-
forts California passed legislation that can still 
be found in the penal code today. 
The Charles Houston Bar Association has 
always fought to protect civil rights and advo-
cated for equality. These efforts led to the 
CHBA earning recognition from the National 
Bar Association as one of its Most Out-
standing Affiliates in 1977, 1986, 2002, and 
2004. 
The CHBA’s values and mission are re-
flected in accomplishments and legacies of its 
members. From California’s first African Amer-
ican Supreme Court Justice Wiley Manuel to 
the First African American Vice President-elect 
KAMALA HARRIS, The Charles Houston Bar As-
sociation and its members continue to dedi-
cate themselves to creating and being the en-
gineers of social change. 
On behalf of California’s 13th Congressional 
District, I want to extend my sincere congratu-
lations on this important milestone. I thank the 
Charles Houston Bar Association for being a 
tireless advocate for an inclusive community. I 
wish them continued success in training and 
organizing future generations of leaders to ad-
dress the issue of diversity in the legal profes-
sion and the challenges of racial inequality. 
RON WAGONER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ron Wagoner with the City 
of Lakewood for his long tenure with the City 
and his countless contributions to our commu-
nity. 
Ron began work with the City of Lakewood 
on December 28, 1970 and, after 50 years of 
service, plans to retire in January 2021. 
Throughout his time with the City, he has had 
many different responsibilities and roles—from 
Laborer to Maintenance Supervisor—but he is 
best known for his work ethic and delightful 
nature. 
Through 50 winters, he has ensured snow 
removal and ice control for the City of Lake-
wood and its residents. He actively partici-
pated in the Colorado Chapter of the Amer-
ican Public Works Association (APWA), par-
ticularly related to snow, ice and pavement, 
and chaired the APWA Snow and Ice com-
mittee from 1985 to 2013. 
During his service, he also managed pave-
ment quality for 1,345 lane-miles of city 
streets. This meant selecting, coordinating and 
directing suppliers of multiple maintenance 
materials including pavement, sewer, water-
line, sand, and salt as well as evolving equip-
ment purchases to support maintenance of 
streets, sewers, waterlines and storm water fa-
cilities. Ron also helped lead and participate in 
emergency responses to infrastructure fail-
ures, storm damage, police responses and fire 
responses, and helped hire and supervise un-
told numbers of employees with varied back-
grounds. 
Ron’s work ethic and leadership earned him 
Lakewood’s Employee of the Year in 2016. 
Outside of work, Ron is a dedicated father and 
grandfather. I want to extend my deepest ap-
preciation for Ron’s long career in public serv-
ice and countless contributions to our commu-
nity. I wish him the best in retirement and fu-
ture endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOYCE HABER SCHUCK 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mrs. Joyce Haber 
Schuck, cherished wife, mother, grandmother, 
patriot, community activist, and dear friend. 
Joyce was born December 9, 1937, to lov-
ing parents, Frank and Florence Haber, in 
Long Island, New York. She met the love of 
her life, Steve, while at a party hosted by a 
mutual friend. They married in 1958, following 
his college graduation. As newlyweds, Steve 
and Joyce lived and worked in Syracuse and 
New York City until they accomplished their 
dream of starting a family and moving to Colo-
rado Springs. They had three beloved chil-
dren: William David (1959), Thomas Allen 
(1961), and Ann Elizabeth (1968). 
Joyce lived an extraordinary life by all 
measures. Her husband, Steve, describes her 
as ‘‘beautiful at many levels, and bordering on 
being renaissance.’’ Joyce embraced the pop-
ular role of being a homemaker to her family, 
but her efforts and passions didn’t end there. 
Joyce returned to college in her 40s and grad-
uated with a degree in social work. Her pas-
sion was always in the well-being of those 
less fortunate. 
Joyce blazed historic trails in her commu-
nity. She co-founded Community Transitions, 
a non-profit organization that served homeless 
families, established a volunteer program for 
the District Attorney’s office, and built the DA’s 
‘Shape Up’ initiative. She was appointed by 
Governor Bill Ritter to the board of the Charter 
School Institute and served on the boards of 
the League of Charter School and the Youth 
Transformation Center. Additionally, she co- 
founded and chaired the board of Colorado’s 
first military charter school, the Colorado Mili-
tary Academy. 
The Schuck’s had an unwavering commit-
ment to children, particularly to those who are 
disadvantaged. They founded Parents Chal-
lenge, a nationwide nonprofit to empower low- 
income parents with financial and informa-
tional resources so that they may choose the 
schools best suited for their children’s needs. 
Parents Challenge has been carrying out its 
mission of serving parents and children across 
our nation for over 21 years. 
In a move that took her out of her comfort 
zone, Joyce embraced the campaign life when 
Steve sought the Republican nomination for 
Governor of Colorado in 1986. Not so secretly, 
many expressed that they wished she was the 
candidate because she excelled at building re-
lationships and communicating with people 
from all walks of life. Unbeknownst to Steve, 
Joyce kept a diary of her experience on the 
campaign, which she converted into a trail-
blazing book titled, ‘‘Political Wives, Veiled 
Lives.’’ 
Joyce had many passions in her life, but 
none more than her family. Joyce was pre-
ceded in death by her parents Frank and Flor-
ence, and sister Rolene. Joyce is survived by 
her loving husband Steve, children: Bill 
(Dede), Tom, and Ann; her grandchildren: 
Emily, Molly, Hillary, Whitney, Gabriel, Conner, 
Colton, 
and 
Bryce; 
great-grandchildren: 
Madyson, Emyrson, Grayson, Hudson, and 
Liam. 
Joyce leaves behind a legacy of grace, 
kindness, compassion, and generosity. She 
lived her life with enthusiasm and purpose, 
and her commitment to those in need will ben-
efit generations to come.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
FRANK J. MCGUIRE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. 
Frank J. McGuire. Mr. McGuire passed away 
on July 7, 2020 at the age of 92, after a life-
time of business and community leadership, 
philanthropy and service to Buffalo and West-
ern New York. 
His contributions are so many in so many 
arenas, including economic, civic, cultural and 
charitable that even his son found it difficult to 
describe so he let the quote that guided his fa-
ther’s work speak to how Frank McGuire lived 
his life. ‘‘A ship is safe in the harbor, but that 
is not what ships were built for.’’ As reported 
in the Buffalo News, this well respected and 
well-known leader, ‘‘was not afraid of risk or 
challenge, and always described as brilliant, 
tough, honest and fair.’’ 
Frank McGuire was a job creator and a gen-
erator of opportunity; he was an entrepreneur 
for decades before that term became more 
widely embraced and celebrated. Still working 
into his nineties as chairman of the McGuire 
Group, Frank McGuire never acquired titles, 
he built companies—30 of them—giving 1,700 
people employment and careers as an indus-
try leader in the fields of construction, health 
care, commercial and industrial real estate de-
velopment. 
His roots were anchored into the South Buf-
falo community as the oldest of five sons of 
Frank J. McGuire Sr. and the former Mary 
Kelly, and a graduate of Holy Family School 
and South Park High School. Sergeant 
McGuire served his country honorably from 
1946 to 1948 having joined the U.S. Army 
after becoming an electrician. 
His ability to lead was recognized by his fel-
low classmates as he was president of the 
School of Engineering of the University at Buf-
falo Class of 1953. His work as an electrician 
during his college days took him to new 
heights as he personally climbed to install the 
aircraft beacon light at the top of a local radio 
tower. If there was a challenge to be met, 
Frank McGuire was the man to step up to get 
it done. 
His innate skill set was more fully on display 
as an employee of General Electric Company 
where at the age of 26, he became one of the 
youngest managers and contributed to the de-
sign and development of the nuclear reactors 
used in the first atomic submarines. Those ex-
periences formed the foundation on which this 
pioneer took his limited savings and with the 
support of his parents, who mortgaged their 
home, founded his first company, Industrial 
Power & Lighting Corporation. This electrical 
engineering and construction organization be-
came a powerhouse completing more than 
$200 million in projects throughout upstate 
New York, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Colorado 
and Alaska and became the first American 
company of its kind to work in the People’s 
Republic of China in 1981. Real estate devel-
opment in Western New York and Florida 
would follow as well and expansion into health 
care operating nursing and rehabilitation facili-
ties in Western New York, Long Island and 
Michigan. 
While expanding his businesses locally, na-
tionally and internationally, he always gave 
back to his community as he led the Chamber 
of Commerce in the 1970s with a focus on 
bringing back jobs. Even an unsuccessful run 
for political office never steered him from pub-
lic service as he served as a trustee of the 
New York State Urban Development Corpora-
tion and was chairman of the Western New 
York Economic Development Corporation. His 
efforts as a member of the New York 
Sportsplex Committee secured state funding 
for the Buffalo Bisons baseball stadium and as 
a major player on the Business Backs the Bills 
Committee in the late 1990s, he certainly con-
tributed to our beloved football team still call-
ing Buffalo its home. 
I, like many others, sought his counsel and 
can attest to his direct and no-nonsense way 
the exchange of ideas, priorities and strategies 
were debated. You knew where you stood 
with Frank McGuire as he knew the value of 
family, faith, friendship and loyalty. He knew 
the value of a job well done and always kept 
his focus on creating and expanding employ-
ment opportunities for the community that 
gave him his start. 
Though never seeking the spotlight, his gen-
erosity and significant contributions to numer-
ous charities were deservedly recognized. 
These included University at Buffalo School of 
Management 
Niagara 
Frontier 
Executive 
award in 2001, the United Way Tocqueville 
Society Philanthropist of the year in 2007, and 
Business First’s Lifetime Achievement Award 
in 2013. 
Madam Speaker, I honor the trailblazing leg-
acy of Frank J. McGuire. He embodied the 
passion, energy, and commitment to cause 
that makes Buffalo unique. We will forever be 
grateful for his outstanding service and leader-
ship. We extend our deepest sympathy to his 
wife, Donna, his children, grandchildren and 
the friends and family of the McGuire Group.

THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF 
CONGRESS 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. HALL. I rise today to include in the 
RECORD a statement on behalf of my prede-
cessor John Lewis and constituents of Geor-
gia’s Fifth Congressional District. We have 
some unfinished business, and I call on Con-
gress to: 
1. expunge all records for nonviolent offend-
ers impacted by the war on drugs; 
2. permit those individuals who were pre-
viously incarcerated to vote and end the prac-
tice of disenfranchisement on these bases; 
3. make it more difficult for police to escape 
accountability when the rights of law-abiding 
Americans are violated; 
4. pass legislation that once and for all bans 
the box and prevents employment discrimina-
tion against those previously incarcerated indi-
viduals; 
5. establish the John Lewis Institute with an 
allocation of money from Congress to support 
this endeavor; 
6. support the Prince Hall Masons Building; 
7. support the renovation and the restoration 
of Dr. King’s office; and 
8. support funding for the John Lewis TOD 
loop which can be a national Pilot and model 
similar to our esteemed Beltline, without dis-
placing long-time residents. 
I challenge my colleagues in this body to 
pass these pieces of legislation and deliver on 
the unfinished business of Georgia’s Fifth 
Congressional District. 
I would also like to take a moment to thank 
leadership in the House and their staff for wel-
coming me with open arms but more impor-
tantly for their leadership in these very chal-
lenging times. Their commitment to getting re-
sults on behalf of American people is laud-
able, and the work over the last few years to 
keep this giant ship on course and to get it 
back on normal course. 
We also need to adapt to the changing 
times. The post-World War II economy is not 
coming back. The gig economy is here to 
stay. 
The gig economy is upon us and to remain 
competitive we have to invest in and reinvest 
in strategies of empowering people at all sta-
tions in life to be their best selves and own 
their own futures. 
As more Americans choose independent 
and flexible work, this coverage gap will only 
get bigger, which is why our lawmakers need 
to update our safety net as soon as possible. 
That is why I am proud that today’s 
Coronavirus relief bill delivers $900 billion in 
much-needed aid but this is not enough. We 
need to pass another round of stimulus 
checks and we need to ensure that state and 
local governments—which are at the forefront 
and bearing the impact of paying for this pan-
demic—are reimbursed. 
And, I would like to close on a point of per-
sonal privilege. 
I have a picture of a man who was a 
straight-A student at George Washington 
Carver High School in Montgomery, Alabama 
who was pushed out of the educational sys-
tem because he chose to stand up for justice 
and equality for all in the 1960s. 
He was a peaceful and law-abiding student 
who organized hundreds of other students to 
participate in the Selma to Montgomery 
March. It was only a few years ago that I 
found out who he was. I was reflecting with 
my mother on her photo collection from the 
civil rights movement one day, and to my as-
tonishment she stated that the peaceful 
protestor being dragged on the ground by a 
police officer in 1965 was my father. 
His name was Leon Hall and he was the 
youngest staff member of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference, and aide to Dr. 
Martin Luther King, from 1963 to 1968. He 
was a foot soldier in the fight for justice along 
with Hosea Williams, who stood on the Ed-
mund Pettus bridge next my predecessor John 
Lewis. All three of them were beaten, verbally 
abused, and illegally incarcerated countless 
times, just as we see today with Eric Garner, 
Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and others. 
This has been an unfortunate reality in the 
U.S. and around the world for millions of black 
and brown people for far too long—injustice 
and unlawful treatment by those responsible 
for upholding the law has to end and it has to 
end now. 
While I have seen this picture for my entire 
life, before that conversation with my mother I 
never realized that the individual in it was my 
father. 
The picture was taken in 1974 and showed 
my father. Leon Hall, a board member of the

Southern Regional Council, testifying before 
this very body about the issues related to edu-
cation and students being pushed out of edu-
cation systems, much as he was. Our Majority 
Whip Representative CLYBURN and Represent-
ative BENNIE
THOMPSON
were also board 
members of the SRC at that time. 
The body of work they established at that 
time is the scholarship we now refer to as the 
school to prison pipeline. Some of America’s 
greatest talents, our most brilliant minds—ca-
pable of creating inventions, innovations, or 
great companies that can employ thousands 
and provide cures to ailments—are lan-
guishing in prison due to an unjust legal sys-
tem. Many of them were brutalized on a traffic 
stop or walking innocently down the street. 
I rise to bring attention to the need for jus-
tice reform and to explain the import of why I 
support justice ref arm projects, like the last 
prisoner project, the innocence project, ban-
ning the box for reentry to work. I support the 
overall evolution of the way we work, who 
works, and how we contribute and provide 
value to a future society that truly is just for 
all. 
Young people who fill prisons should be em-
powered to create and build our companies as 
knowledgebased workers with or without a col-
lege degree doing jobs that require new tech 
skills that they have, and those in jails for non-
violent offenses should be released and given 
training to do the same. That’s why I support 
the MOREs act and SAFE act. But the critical 
component 
of 
this 
is 
the 
categorical 
expungement of records and wholesale invest-
ment in the creation of companies with, for, 
and by citizens reentering the economy—com-
panies that will pay taxes and keep people off 
the streets. The SAFE Act should have 
minority- and women-led financial institutions 
at the center of the transition that we need to 
move our country forward in a uniformed fash-
ion. 
We need a comprehensive solution to end 
these injustices. I believe in second chances 
and the power of redemption. People returning 
from incarceration should have opportunities 
and pathways to succeed and contribute to 
society in a meaningful way without stigma 
from the wrongs they’ve done in the past. This 
same principle is applicable to Congress too. 
I would end on the following observation. 
The country was built on the backs of African 
descendants of slaves, indigenous people and 
other immigrants including Chinese, Irish, 
Italians, Mexican and Central Americans, 
those from South Asia and people from all 
over the world. We need a country that func-
tions without regard to where your ancestors 
come from. We need opportunity mindful of 
that. We need a justice system mindful of that. 
Only then can we begin to end the divisions 
of our country and begin to unite. 
Tough times bring out the worse or the best 
in people and we need to standup and ensure 
that we not let the COVID crisis continue to 
bring out the worse but rather take the next 
few weeks of this administration and first 100 
days to 6 months to get something right in this 
country and get the country back on course. 
SUPPORT FOR S. 1310 (ORGANIZA-
TION 
OF 
AMERICAN 
STATES 
LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT ACT 
OF 2020) 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 21, 2020 
Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, I want to ex-
press my support for the Organization of 
American States Legislative Engagement Act. 
The Organization of American States (OAS) 
brings together the nations of the Western 
Hemisphere to promote democracy, human 
rights, security, and economic development. 
This bill directs the Department of State to 
develop a strategy to support efforts in the 
OAS to strengthen critical anti-corruption ef-
forts and promote human rights. 
It also requires a report detailing the organi-
zation’s progress toward advancing human 
rights, combating impunity, and supporting the 
participation of democratically elected legisla-
tors in OAS activities. 
Finally, this bill encourages democratically 
elected legislators from member states to dis-
cuss the most important issues facing the re-
gion—including defending human rights, pro-
moting democracy, and supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts. 
As 
co-chair 
of 
the 
US-Mexico 
Inter-
parliamentary Group, I recognize the important 
role that legislators can play in advancing 
shared foreign policy interests. However, the 
United States must take all necessary meas-
ures to ensure that any interparliamentary 
forum created under this legislation provides a 
platform for substantive discourse to address 
serious issues impacting the region, including 
countering threats to democracy and human 
rights, transnational crime, impunity, and sys-
temic corruption in accordance with the Inter- 
American Democratic Charter. 
The United States must also make all efforts 
to ensure that interparliamentary forums are 
not coopted by actors who aim to undermine 
U.S. policy interests in the region by pro-
moting socialism and embracing malign actors 
like the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
This legislation includes critical language 
ensuring that only democratically elected legis-
lators participate in any newly-created forum. 
A ‘‘democratically elected legislator’’ under this 
legislation should be strictly defined as an indi-
vidual who was elected as a result of periodic, 
free and fair elections. Further, any legislator 
who is known to be convicted for or engaged 
in corruption or transnational criminal activi-
ties, including trafficking of people, goods, or 
illicit narcotics, moneylaundering, terrorist fi-
nancing, acts of terrorism, campaign finance 
violations, bribery, extortion, human rights vio-
lations, or undermining democracy, should be 
barred from participation. 
The U.S. must also work with the OAS to 
ensure that any forum or action taken under 
this legislation is feasible and cost effective, 
keeping in mind the ongoing budgetary con-
straints of the OAS and the importance of ad-
vancing the objectives outlined under the Or-
ganization of American States Revitalization 
and Reform Act of 2013, including the imple-
mentation of a results-based budgeting proc-
ess in order to strategically prioritize, and 
where appropriate, reduce current and future 
mandates. 
The State Department should also maintain 
communication with the Committee on Foreign 
Relations in the Senate and the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs in the House of Representa-
tives through regular briefings on the progress 
of any forum that is created under Section 4 
of this legislation and its implementation. 
With the Western Hemisphere facing seri-
ous threats from authoritarian regimes and 
malign actors, it has never been more impor-
tant for the U.S. and our partners to promote 
values of freedom in the region. 
I commend Senator CARDIN and Senator 
WICKER for their leadership on this issue, and 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, Americans 
should wonder why Pennsylvania Senator PAT 
TOOMEY—a Harvard educated, former Wall 
Street foreign currency swap trader—held up 
this relief bill so necessary to help people in 
our pandemic-plagued nation. He was wrong 
to hold up the bill, but he is right on putting a 
spotlight on the Federal Reserve. Bottom line: 
How will our nation pay the $2 trillion bill for 
this necessary relief to the American people, 
and our escalating debt? First, let me begin 
with this basic lesson President Franklin Roo-
sevelt’s generation taught mine: There is a dif-
ference between ‘‘money’’ and ‘‘wealth.’’ Sen-
ator TOOMEY appears to be concerned about 
America’s deteriorating financial position. So 
am I. 
Wealth = tangible assets that produce real 
products (agricultural land, a factory, a donut 
shop, a forest, etc. . . . real products. Money 
is but an ephemeral accounting transaction. 
As Congress debates this $2 trillion-dollar vital 
bill, of one thing we can be certain: it is not 
paid for. The U.S. has gone from the world’s 
largest creditor (+$360 billion) in 1980, to its 
largest debtor (¥$97 trillion) in 2019. The per-
cent of household debt equals 68 percent of 
the GDP, an astounding figure—($14.35 trillion 
of a GDP of $21.16 trillion). The Federal Re-
serve soon will gather its member banks to 
figure out how to finance this debt. The money 
to pay for it will be borrowed as onerous tax-
ation at this time would harm the recovery. But 
the American people will have to pay back 
lenders for years to come, including increasing 
payments to foreign creditors that are financ-
ing 
America—China, 
Japan, 
and 
Brazil, 
among others. Senator TOOMEY is shining a 
laser beam on the Fed as it will be the su-
preme negotiator in these ‘‘money’’ trans-
actions that will impact our nation’s future 
‘‘wealth’’. Our nation has been accumulating 
more and more debt and not been paying 
down principal for a very long time due to 
wars, huge tax cuts to the wealthy, and a 
haughty attitude among some that the U.S. is 
invulnerable to the selling off of productive as-
sets. During the 1990’s, to ease the interest 
payments on our accumulating U.S. debt, the 
U.S. financial system was turned inside out to 
inflate 
and 
leverage 
globally 
Americans’ 
wealth in the housing sector. Wall Street, with

December 21, 2020 
the Fed looking on, ushered in the horrific 
2008 housing crisis with millions of trans-
actions that failed. Individual American families 
are still recovering from that hard body blow to 
their real wealth achieved through home own-
ership, their primary source of savings. Yes, 
Wall Street feverishly booked paper money 
losses while big securities firms ate one an-
other, leaving about 4 giant firms that now 
transact the majority of money trades in our 
country. Incidentally, their CEO’s took away 
more money and bonuses than before the 
crash. They transferred their losses to home-
owners in every hamlet in our nation as well 
as booked losses to many lenders that had 
less money power. 
Senator PAT TOOMEY is a former Wall Street 
refugee as the bank at which he worked was 
gobbled up by Germany’s Deutche Bank. He 
holds a rigid fealty to free markets as a Club 
for Growth endorsed Senator. He and I hold 
vastly differing views about many issues, but 
we come from manufacturing states deeply 
harmed by the current Wall Street-Fed eco-
nomic model, where every real asset is dis-
posable. We both share a deep concern about 
rising U.S. debt levels and the role of the Fed-
eral Reserve as an agent of national decline. 
He has focused on America’s terrible ‘‘money 
vs. wealth’’ predicament whether one chooses 
to listen to him or not. Our nation’s capital 
markets are now dependent on foreign invest-
ment to prop them up. Our nation is not finan-
cially independent. The question is which sec-
tor of our economy will next fall victim to Wall 
Street’s financial roulette with the Federal Re-
serve’s acquiescence—will the wealth of our 
states and municipalities be compromised or 
emptied out as was our housing sector? That 
is a deep concern in view of what Wall Street 
orchestrated as the housing bubble burst. 
For foreign investors buying U.S. debt, U.S. 
taxpayers annually now shell out over $130 
billion annually in interest payments to China, 
Japan, and Brazil to name three. Since the 
1980’s the share of foreign ownership of US 
debt has risen from less than 4 percent to well 
over 40 percent. This is an astounding indict-
ment on our unfortunate inability to live within 
our means. Frankly, to be a strong and inde-
pendent nation, with wealth creation here at 
home, these are bills we should aim to pay 
ourselves. That requires real leadership. 
The Fed’s Chair, an unelected position, is 
now the second most important office in 
Washington, DC. 99 percent of the public 
doesn’t think much about the Fed. But it be-
comes the key lynchpin in the ability of our na-
tion to float economically. Its growing, sub-
terranean financial control over daily life can 
come at a terrible price. The Fed’s money and 
debt penchant for our nation is like consuming 
a tad of arsenic at a time. Rather, to reverse 
the cycle of middle-class downward mobility, 
America needs real wealth creation at home, 
not just money supply manipulation again. For 
example, why shouldn’t seniors be able to 
earn fair interest again on their accumulated 
savings? They loan their precious dollars to 
banks and are paid nothing in return. The as-
piring generation should not have to be 
pawned through heavy education debt loads 
from which the financial sector benefits. If 
Congress fails to pay attention, real assets of 
local municipalities and states could well be 
leveraged by the Fed to pay more American 
interest to foreign bond holders. Heedless bor-
rowing continues to fund America’s inability to 
grow the real economy here at home. The sig-
nificant diminishment of manufacturing as a 
robust sector of our economy that creates 
broad economic uplift of the middle class can-
not be matched by the ‘‘financial services’’ 
sector nor the new ‘‘tech industry’’ which 
produce very lopsided economies, with a few 
very rich but many more poor. 
Record credit card debt and the indebting of 
the aspiring generation—all are signs of a 
creeping financialization of our society that 
takes power and control away from ordinary 
citizens. Is it any wonder Americans are in 
backlash mode? The amount of interest tax-
payers are paying foreign creditors has been 
on an ascending curve since the l980s. It can-
not continue if our nation is to remain free. 
With this ‘‘debt bomb’’ hanging over our 
heads, in the future any bill Congress passes 
must protect the real value of our municipal 
and state assets—water and sewage systems, 
bus systems, parks, hospitals and universities, 
roads, equipment, etc. They should not be le-
veraged through international borrowing that 
requires growing interest payments over time 
that in tum indebts our communities in per-
petuity as has occurred already with student 
debt loans and the housing melt down. 
A truly strong America requires we look our-
selves in the mirror and design a ‘‘Build Back 
Better Recovery’’ that is not financialized but 
is truly ‘‘made in America’’, not borrowed. The 
American people deserve no less for what 
they have been enduring during this Pandemic 
and with the accelerating economic washout 
of the middle class since the 1980’s. There is 
a huge difference between money and wealth.

SENATE AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED 
STATES-MEXICO ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP 
ACT 
Committee on Rules: Full Committee held a hearing on 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 133, the ‘‘United 
States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act’’ [Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2021]. The Committee 
granted, by record vote of 8–4, a rule providing for 
the consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 
133, the ‘‘Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2021’’. The rule makes in order a motion offered by 
the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her 
designee that the House concur in the Senate 
amendment with an amendment consisting of the 
text of Rules Committee Print 116–68. The rule 
waives all points of order against consideration of the 
motion. The rule provides that the Senate amend-
ment and the motion shall be considered as read. 
The rule provides one hour of debate on the motion 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. The rule provides that the question of 
adoption of the motion shall be divided for a sepa-
rate vote on the matter proposed to be inserted as 
divisions B, C, E, and F, and the Chair shall first 
put the question on such portion of the divided 
question. The rule provides that if either portion of 
the divided question fails of adoption, then the mo-
tion shall immediately be considered to have failed 
of adoption. Section two of the rule provides that 
upon adoption of the rule, the House shall be con-
sidered to have concurred in the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 1520 with an amendment consisting of the 
text of Rules Committee Print 116–69. The rule 
provides that the Clerk shall be authorized to make 
necessary technical and conforming changes in the 
engrossment of the House amendments specified in 
the first two sections of the resolution. The rule pro-
vides that if a veto message is laid before the House 
on H.R. 6395, then after the message is read, fur-
ther consideration of the veto message and the bill 
shall be postponed until the legislative day of Mon-
day, December 28, 2020; and on that legislative day, 
the House shall proceed to reconsideration and dis-
pose of such question without intervening motion. 
The rule provides that the chair of the Committee 
on Appropriations and the chair of the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence may insert in the 
Congressional Record not later than December 28, 
2020, such material as they may deem explanatory 
of the Senate amendment and the motion specified 
in the first section of the rule. Testimony was heard 
from Chairman Lowey and Representative Granger.
