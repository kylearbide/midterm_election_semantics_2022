DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
September 30, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by

MADE IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, one of the 
biggest lessons that the COVID–19 pan-
demic has taught us is the importance 
of the phrase ‘‘Made in America.’’ 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
we are a national leader in textile man-
ufacturing, and we have a rich history 
of producing high-quality products. 
That is why North Carolina has been at 
the forefront of helping our first re-
sponders and frontline medical per-
sonnel get the protective equipment 
that they need to effectively battle the 
virus. 
For these reasons, I want to see our 
protective equipment made in the 
United States and not in a country 
controlled by the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
For the last two decades, most ob-
servers have predicted that either the 
United States or China will lead the 
world in the 21st century. In the early 
2000s, we saw China as a friendly com-
petitor that we could work with eco-
nomically. However, in recent years, 
the actions of the Chinese Communist 
Party have revealed the true colors of 
an authoritarian force. They are not 
our friends, and they are not a force for 
good in this world. 
Given the fact that it was China that 
mishandled the virus, and China that 
allowed it to spread, and China that 
lied to the world about it, how accept-
able is it that the American people 
should be reliant on China for the es-
sential personal protective equipment 
that we need to fight the virus? That 
would be like having to beg the arson-
ist to help you put out the fire that 
they started. 
That is why I introduced the Make 
PPP in America Act, along with Con-
gresswoman Jan Schakowsky. This bi-
partisan legislation requires the De-
fense Logistics Agency to issue longer 
term contracts to make personal pro-
tective 
equipment 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
We have to boost our domestic supply 
chains and make sure our most impor-
tant products come from our shores 
and not from our adversaries like Com-
munist China. 
Bottom line, we need to ensure that 
Made in America is more than just a 
slogan. Made in America needs to be a 
guiding principle as we move into the 
2020s and beyond. 
ESTABLISHING A DEPARTMENT OF 
RECONCILIATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker, in the name of liberty and 
justice for all. I rise to call to our at-
tention that we saw last night evidence 
of what happens when one party comes 
to debate and another party comes to 
disrupt. 
We saw a President who did any and 
everything that he could to avoid de-
bating. And we saw a Vice President 
who did any and everything that he 
could to debate. 
But something more important hap-
pened than the disruption. We saw a 
President who refused to denounce 
white supremacy and the supremacists. 
This is not the first time this has hap-
pened. A President who refuses to de-
nounce white supremacy and white su-
premacists should not hold office. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud of the Vice 
President. He indicated that the Presi-
dent of the United States is a racist. 
Some things bear repeating: The Vice 
President, former Vice President, indi-
cated that the current President is a 
racist. 
By the way, he is not the first person 
to say so. Many members of the leader-
ship of the House have said so. Other 
prominent Americans have said so. So 
it should not surprise anyone that the 
RECORD should reflect what has been 
said. 
The Vice President went on to say 
that he wants to do something about 
racism in this country. That, if elected, 
he will convene a meeting of persons, 
prominent persons, law enforcement, 
and others, to do something about rac-
ism, and I am going to add systemic 
racism. 
I believe that the Vice President’s 
heart is in the right place, but I also 
know that convening is not enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5058 
September 30, 2020 
Mr. Vice President, whom I happen 
to like very much, convening is not 
enough. 
It is time for us to turn the talking 
points associated with racism into ac-
tion items, and we have done much of 
that here on the Hill. But there is one 
thing that we need to do that we have 
not done in this country that goes back 
to 1619, and that is, we have not rec-
onciled. We have not reconciled the dif-
ferences that we have, the racial dif-
ferences. It is time for reconciliation. 
To turn this talking point into an ac-
tion item, Mr. Vice President, I beg 
that you would establish a department 
of reconciliation with a secretary of 
reconciliation who wakes up every 
morning with the job of eliminating in-
vidious discrimination in all of its 
forms in this country. 
It is time for us to deal forthrightly, 
to deal in an open and notorious man-
ner, with racism and invidious dis-
crimination in this country in all of its 
various forms. 
It is time, Mr. Vice President. You 
are the man. You are the man in the 
sense that you are the man running for 
President as the nominee of the Demo-
cratic Party. In that sense, you are the 
person to be more appropriate who can 
make this happen. 
We saw a President declare a war on 
poverty, President Johnson. It is time 
to declare a war on racism. It is time 
to end what we are seeing occurring al-
most on a weekly basis in this country 
to African Americans, minorities, and 
women. It is time to have a department 
of reconciliation. 
To this end, I will send the Vice 
President a letter asking him to con-
sider a department of reconciliation. 
To talk about it is not enough. We 
have to have the action item. 
There are many other things that 
can be done. I don’t oppose a task 
force. I don’t oppose opportunities to 
look at other forms of reconciliation. 
But a department of reconciliation is 
the means by which we can formalize 
and actualize reconciliation in this 
country. 
It won’t be easy, and it won’t happen 
right away, which is why we need the 
department of reconciliation. Call it 
anything that you want, as long as it is 
about reconciliation. 
I will contact you, Mr. President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
PUTTING AN END TO POLITICAL 
ROBOCALLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, we are in the height of 
robocall season, and the American peo-
ple are beyond fed up. 
The recent 6–3 ruling by the Supreme 
Court that upholds a Federal ban on 
robocalls warrants a serious conversa-
tion that is long overdue. 
Under the 1991 Telephone Consumer 
Protection 
Act, 
TCPA, 
prerecorded 
voice messages and the use of auto-
matic dialing systems were effectively 
banned. The prevailing argument was 
that the American people would no 
longer face intrusive nuisances that we 
have 
now 
come 
to 
recognize 
as 
robocalls. 
In retrospect, the TCPA was a novel 
endeavor, but the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2015 introduced setbacks that 
compromised the progress that had 
been achieved in the fight against 
robocalls. Debt collectors received a 
special carve-out that allowed them to 
place automatic calls to Americans 
who owed money to the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Though the Supreme Court elimi-
nated this carve-out on the basis that 
it was a violation of the First Amend-
ment, bountiful opportunities to enact 
meaningful reform remain on the hori-
zon. 
Unwanted robocalls have become the 
bane of many, and with phones ringing 
off the hook in households across the 
country, 
Americans 
are 
wondering 
when they will get a reprieve from 
these nuisances. Imagine you are sit-
ting down for dinner with your family, 
and within seconds of the meal start-
ing, your phone begins ringing. It is 
yet another robocall. 
Now, magnify the scene to house-
holds across the country. It is an en-
raging scenario that all of us have been 
affected by, but I have a blueprint that 
can set things right. 
Since 2005, I have introduced the 
Robo Calls Off Phones Act, legislation 
that directs the FTC to revise its regu-
lation for the National Do Not Call 
Registry and allows politically ori-
ented messages to be added to that list. 
In fact, the genesis for this legisla-
tion came from my constituents. Many 
were 
livid 
that 
they 
had 
been 
bombarded with unwanted calls during 
the 2004 election year. They demanded 
that 
Congress 
act 
to 
end 
these 
nuisances, and I took it upon myself to 
carry the mantle. 
Ever since I have reintroduced this 
legislation to address the cyclical 
issue, and I remain adamant that Con-
gress must address this immediately. 
For years, politicians in Washington 
have told their constituents that they 
would fight against robocalls. Now it is 
time to hold ourselves to account and 
be part of the solution. 
H.R. 805, the bipartisan Robo COP 
Act, is the vessel by which we can 
achieve meaningful reform. 
The simple truth is that no American 
is immune to receiving robocalls. It is 
becoming a nagging problem that has 
evolved to the point where we now be-
lieve it is commonplace to receive 
them at any point during the day. 
The answer to this problem is right 
before our very eyes, and Congress 
finds itself in an opportune moment to 
enact meaningful reforms that have 
been overlooked for far too long. 
RECOGNIZING THE DIOL FAMILY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, in the early 
morning hours of August 5, five Sen-
egalese immigrants, including an in-
fant and a toddler, died in an arson fire 
in their Denver home. The victims de-
serve to be recognized. 
Djibril Diol, who was 30 years old, 
immigrated to the United States from 
Senegal 10 years ago to make a better 
life for himself and his family. He grad-
uated from Colorado State University 
with a degree in civil engineering and 
was an outstanding student with a 
bright future ahead of him. 
He was well loved by his family and 
friends. His brother described him as 
‘‘a good person, a good worker, and a 
good Muslim.’’ A coworker said that 
Djibril ‘‘was a way better man than I 
will ever be.’’ 
Djibril’s wife, Adja, and 2-year-old 
daughter, Khadija, also died in the fire, 
as did Coumba Diol Hassan, Djibril’s 
sister, and Hawa Beye, her 10-month- 
old son. 
We don’t know what motivated this 
attack, but it has deeply shaken our 
African immigrant community and left 
them feeling unsafe. While this was a 
tragic incident, and we mourn for the 
family, 
I 
want 
to 
emphasize 
the 
strength and resilience of our African 
immigrant community. 
As a case in point, the African Lead-
ership Group, ALG, a local nonprofit 
that provides a wide variety of vital 
services to our immigrant neighbors, 
has consoled and supported the Diol 
family and kept pressure on law en-
forcement to solve this horrific crime. 
Led by Papa Dia, who is a native of 
Senegal himself, I thank them for their 
service. 
RECOGNIZING STANLEY MARKETPLACE 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Stanley Marketplace, a 
community-focused urban market in 
Aurora, Colorado. 
Located in northwest Aurora on the 
border of Denver’s Central Park neigh-
borhood, Stanley Marketplace is a 
community of businesses and people 
who 
believe 
in 
doing 
things 
dif-
ferently—sustainably, creatively, and 
with more than the bottom line in 
mind. 
The marketplace’s 22-acre site was 
once the site of the Stanley Aviation 
factory. It is now a community gath-
ering place, home to 50 independently 
owned Colorado businesses. 
Today, the same innovative spirit 
that once filled Stanley’s building has 
been harnessed to offer our community 
an urban marketplace featuring goods 
and services from local independent 
businesses. 
The property includes a 30,000-square- 
foot sustainable greenhouse and an 
urban farm. Under construction is an 
inclusive playground where children of 
all abilities can play.

During the pandemic, the Stanley 
Marketplace team has gone above and 
beyond to support its community of 
small business owners, helping them 
weather the continued challenges of 
COVID–19. 
Stanley Marketplace is guided by a 
document they call the Stanifesto, 
which includes these lines: 
We believe the best rules are simple and 
clear: Love your neighbor. Leave each place 
better than you found it. Be good and do 
good. 
I congratulate the Stanley team on 
their ongoing work to support our 
neighbors and locally owned small 
businesses. 
HONORING THE TIRELESS WORKERS IN COLORADO 
DURING THE 2020 CENSUS 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of organizations in my dis-
trict that have worked tirelessly to 
promote and ensure their communities 
are counted in the 2020 Census. 
With over 800,000 citizens and 160 lan-
guages spoken in my district, making 
sure that every single resident is 
counted is difficult work. With the help 
of many hardworking organizations, 
Colorado’s Sixth District has a self-re-
sponse rate of 76.5 percent, surpassing 
its 2010 rate and surpassing the State 
average of 69.5 percent. In fact, it holds 
the highest response rate of any Colo-
rado congressional district. 
I would particularly like to acknowl-
edge the following 11 organizations for 
their help in spreading awareness: To-
gether We Count, the Asian Pacific De-
velopment Center, the Oromo Commu-
nity of Colorado, The ARC of Aurora, 
the Aurora Economic Opportunity Coa-
lition, the Mosaic Church of Aurora, 
the African Chamber of Commerce in 
Colorado, the Village Exchange Center, 
the City of Aurora, Arapahoe County, 
and Mi Pueblo Market. 
These organizations truly make a dif-
ference in my district for their tireless 
work in the 2020 Census. 
HONORING MARY HODGE ON HER RETIREMENT 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Mrs. Mary Hodge, a 
former State legislator and current 
Adams County commissioner, and con-
gratulate her on her upcoming retire-
ment. 
Commissioner Hodge is a Colorado 
native, who has dedicated her career to 
making an impact in her home State. 
Mary, among many things, is a former 
State representative in the Sixth Dis-
trict of Colorado and a county commis-
sioner. Mary has also taught first 
grade in Greeley and preschool in Glen-
wood Springs. 
Mary went on to own and operate a 
motel in Wyoming and worked for sev-
eral businesses. Her public service 
began in 2000, when she was elected as 
a Colorado State representative. 
As a servant leader, Commissioner 
Hodge is a tireless champion for edu-
cation and small businesses. I com-
mend Mary for her support for the Col-
orado Air and Space Port. Her stead-
fast advocacy was integral in bringing 
that project to fruition. 
Commissioner Hodge’s diverse profes-
sional background and leadership expe-
rience has benefited our community for 
many years. 
I congratulate Commissioner Mary 
Hodge on her retirement and thank her 
for her service to our community and 
to Adams County. 
f 
ESSENTIAL MEDICAL INNOVATION 
AND 
MANUFACTURING 
MUST 
COME HOME TO AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, in 2020, America is facing sig-
nificant threats to our health, to our 
values, and to our national security. 
The Chinese Communist Party has at-
tempted to exert control over every 
facet of America’s economy and indus-
try, and even our health and safety. 
The coronavirus has exposed that 
much of America’s medical supply 
chain, as it currently stands, runs di-
rectly through China. This should con-
cern every American. Why would we 
trust a regime that lies about a pan-
demic 
to 
control 
our 
access 
to 
healthcare? 
As a physician, I have long been con-
cerned about the Chinese Communist 
Government’s near monopoly on the 
manufacturing of generic medicines. 
And that threat doesn’t stop there. We 
cannot allow the Chinese Communist 
Party to control our access to prescrip-
tion drugs and the vital materials that 
are used in healthcare equipment, not 
to mention PPE. 
For the sake of American patients 
and our national security, we must cor-
rect course and return the essential 
medical innovation and manufacturing 
home to America and away from this 
hostile regime. 
For months, the China Task Force 
has been working to identify realistic 
and achievable solutions to secure our 
medical supply chain and ensure that 
Americans are never beholden to the 
Chinese Communist Party for our 
medicines 
and 
for 
our 
healthcare 
equipment. We are taking a com-
prehensive approach to end America’s 
reliance on China and bring jobs home 
to America. 
Our supply chain challenges extend 
beyond the healthcare regime. From 
technology 
to 
manufacturing, 
too 
many materials that we rely on every 
day are sourced from China. 
Earlier this year, I introduced legis-
lation that seeks to end America’s de-
pendence on China for rare earth ele-
ments and other critical minerals— 
these are essential, and they are used 
in the manufacturing of medical sup-
plies, defense technology, and high- 
tech products—by establishing a supply 
chain for these materials here in the 
United States. It is important for our 
survival into the upcoming technology 
advancements that our country is so 
dependent on. It also requires the De-
partment of Defense to source these 
materials from America. 
Pennsylvania, my home, is home to a 
dedicated and highly skilled workforce, 
and I am working on a plan to 
incentivize companies to bring their 
research, the development, and the pro-
duction of materials back home. 
As President Trump said earlier this 
month: ‘‘We want to build factories in 
Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to 
make our products in Chicago, not 
Shanghai.’’ And, I might add, we want 
to make medicines in Chambersburg, 
not China. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the fight of our 
lives, and we have a real opportunity 
to make a difference. There is nothing 
partisan 
about 
securing 
America’s 
place as a leader in the 21st century. 
There is nothing partisan about bring-
ing jobs home to America. There is 
nothing partisan about combating a 
hostile regime’s overreach into Amer-
ican lives. 
This is not about Republicans or 
Democrats; this is about Americans. I 
urge my colleagues from across the po-
litical spectrum to get behind our com-
monsense solutions to counter the Chi-
nese Communist Party and protect our 
Nation. 
It is simple. We must secure our sup-
ply chains. We must defeat China in 
the race to the next-generation tech-
nology. We must prepare Americans to 
succeed in the years to come. 
From 
strengthening 
our 
supply 
chains and bringing jobs home to 
America and to our allies, countering 
Chinese interference in our educational 
institutions, we must take action. We 
must continue fighting to defend the 
American people and equip America to 
lead the way in the 21st century. 
As I have said before on this floor, 
this is the fight of our lifetime, and it 
is one that we certainly can win.

HONORING HEALTHCARE HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor to stand here today and recog-
nize a handful of remarkable individ-
uals from my congressional district for 
their exceptional contributions to the 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
communities 
across southeast Texas since the out-
break of the COVID–19 virus. 
I have seen people come together like 
never before to help and support each 
other throughout this unprecedented 
time. People from all walks of life and 
from 
different 
backgrounds 
and 
ideologies have put their own needs 
aside to respond to the crisis at hand 
without hesitation. 
Today I wish to personally honor and 
say 
thank 
you 
to 
our 
frontline 
healthcare workers. You have selflessly 
put yourselves in the path of the virus

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5060 
September 30, 2020 
in order to protect the rest of us, and 
you are true American heroes. 
To the doctors, nurses, technicians, 
EMTs, pharmacists, home health aides, 
and everyone else who supports patient 
care, from the bottom of my heart, 
thank you. You have gone above and 
beyond. Your dedication, courage, and 
strength deserve our most profound ad-
miration and gratitude. Your service to 
your community has impacted and 
saved countless lives. 
It would take days for me to appro-
priately honor each and every person 
who deserves special recognition. Un-
fortunately, I have limited time today, 
so I want to highlight just a few of 
these heroes. 
From my neck of the woods in Tyler 
County, Texas, I want to thank Carrie 
Holland Evans, a registered nurse who 
was infected with COVID–19 in the line 
of duty. Since her recovery, Carrie has 
participated in virology studies and 
has donated convalescent plasma to 
save lives. 
I want to recognize Dr. Qamar 
Arfeen, who delivers home health and 
hospice care across southeast Texas 
and is the head of the COVID–19 unit at 
Baptist Hospital, for all of his work 
with convalescent plasma. 
From Houston Methodist in Bay-
town, I want to mention four brave and 
resilient registered nurses: Jennifer 
Vera, LaDuska James, Dorothy Terry, 
and Jon Ann Watson. Your contribu-
tions to the hospital and dedication to 
patient care were simply awe inspiring. 
Also, from Houston Methodist in 
Baytown, I want to thank Gina Cotter, 
who collaborated across disciplines to 
educate and upskill nurses to provide 
respiratory care, while also serving as 
a frontline respiratory therapist. 
From Houston Methodist in Clear 
Lake, I want to thank Dr. Omar Acres, 
Dr. Nina Zatikyan, and Dr. Arthur 
Lim, who all cared for many infected 
patients. I also want to recognize three 
registered nurses—Stephanie Dockter, 
Diana Freyberger, and Nicole Herrick— 
who all volunteered to care exclusively 
for COVID–19 patients so their other 
staff members would not have to. 
I want to acknowledge the largest 
hospital system in southeast Texas, 
Memorial Hermann Health System, 
which has been on the front lines of the 
region’s response to the pandemic. Me-
morial Hermann’s more than 6,000 phy-
sicians, 8,000 nurses, and hundreds of 
case managers and social workers have 
been caring for patients and their fami-
lies in one of the country’s most sig-
nificant hot spots. They risk their lives 
every day to care for our community 
and have worked tirelessly to slow the 
spread of this disease. 
And, finally, I want to mention a 
handful of heroes from CHI St. Luke’s. 
Thank you to Dr. Lou Hamer, a 
pulmonologist who closed his out-
patient practice and instead fully dedi-
cated his services to supporting the 
needs of COVID patients. 
Thank you Dr. Monte Orahood for 
working day and night since the pan-
demic started and for your clinical 
oversight, which has undoubtedly re-
sulted in successful patient outcomes. 
Dr. George Rodriguez, thank you for 
providing clinical guidance and leader-
ship on patient care and protocol devel-
opment. 
And I thank Dr. Zaher Shebib, who 
has consulted on every single COVID–19 
patient case for St. Luke’s. 
Also from St. Luke’s, allow me to 
highlight lab director, Charlie Combs, 
who is described by his colleagues as an 
unsung 
hero, 
as 
well 
as 
Chelsea 
Pavlowich, Christina Andrews, Sarah 
Hill, Candace Fernandez, Jason Case, 
Nidia Johnson, Cole Morse, Cassie Fire, 
and Lisa Agler, who are all superhero 
nurses and whose commitment to pa-
tients supersedes any fear of this dan-
gerous virus. 
And to the thousands of healthcare 
workers who, due to time constraints 
were not mentioned today, please know 
this: You are the heroes of this unprec-
edented time. 
This country and your Congressman 
will forever be grateful. May God bless 
each and every one of you, and may we 
see an end to this global pandemic very 
soon. 
God bless you.

DAIRY UPDATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, Sep-
tember 27, was National Chocolate 
Milk Day. 
Chocolate milk is adored by millions 
of Americans nationwide and is a fa-
vorite among children. Seventy percent 
of the milk children consume is fla-
vored, with chocolate being the most 
popular flavor. Chocolate milk is low 
in fat, high in nutrients, and packed 
with flavor. 
Milk consumption, Mr. Speaker, has 
been declining, however, and when the 
National School Lunch Program re-
moved the most popular and nutritious 
option from schools to only serve fat- 
free milk, the numbers continued to 
drop. As a result of these detrimental 
policies, we have lost nearly a genera-
tion of milk drinkers, and those milk 
drinkers have lost access to the best 
nutrition. 
This detrimental policy was partially 
reversed when the USDA made a deci-
sion to once again allow 1 percent fla-
vored milk back into school lunches, 
and I am grateful to Secretary Sonny 
Perdue for his leadership on the issue. 
To build on this momentum, I intro-
duced the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids 
Act last year to once again allow whole 
milk, both flavored and unflavored, to 
be offered within the program because 
children can greatly benefit from the 
essential nutrients whole milk pro-
vides. 
Taking that one step further, I joined 
my colleague FRED KELLER to intro-
duce the GIVE MILK Act last month. 
The GIVE MILK Act, Mr. Speaker, 
gives families who use the WIC pro-
gram, or Women, Infants, and Children 
program, more control over the nutri-
tion of their children by making 2 per-
cent and whole milk available through 
the WIC program to any child over the 
age of 2. 
b 0930 
Currently, WIC participants are lim-
ited to low-fat or nonfat milk, meaning 
they are missing all the nutrition that 
comes from that milk fat. 
This legislation will give families 
who depend on WIC more options when 
considering 
nutritional 
options 
for 
their children. It will also help in-
crease milk consumption, which is a 
win for our dairy farmers. 
I 
talked 
about 
this 
legislation, 
among other things, when I had the 
pleasure of joining the folks at the Na-
tional Milk Producers Federation last 
week on their new podcast, ‘‘Dairy De-
fined’’. We covered a lot of ground, in-
cluding the importance that milk plays 
in our diets and how coronavirus has 
impacted the dairy industry. 
Safety net programs like the Dairy 
Margin 
Coverage 
program, 
coupled 
with the coronavirus relief efforts, 
have helped ease the burden somewhat 
on our producers, but times remain 
tough. We must continue to spread the 
word about these critical safety net 
programs so our Nation’s dairy pro-
ducers, those farm families, can take 
full advantage of all the tools at their 
disposal. 
If there has been one positive thing 
that has come out of this pandemic, it 
is that we have seen more families re-
turning to the dining room table, Mr. 
Speaker. Milk consumption has seen an 
uptick in the past few months and 
more and more Americans are bene-
fiting from the essential nutrients that 
whole milk provides. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by 
thanking the hardworking men and 
women who have the 24/7, 365-day-a- 
year job of running our dairy farms. 
Thank you for working tirelessly to en-
sure that we have access to delicious, 
nutritious, and top-quality milk.

The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman

Mr. CLINE led the Pledge of Alle-

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

f 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE MUST BE 
FIXED 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, in the era of COVID–19, people 
are reliant on the United States Postal 
Service more than ever, a beloved 
American institution built on trust, re-
liability, and durability. 
During the Presidential elections of 
1864, 156 years ago, during the end of 
the Civil War, soldiers were mailed bal-
lots, and they voted and returned those 
ballots via the United States Postal 
Service. There was no fraud. 
Sadly and unbelievably, the United 
States Postal Service is being sabo-
taged from within. The Trump Post-
master has removed and destroyed 671 
sorting machines nationally, including 
5 of 20 from Buffalo. I inspected the 
Buffalo facility on September 9 and 
found priority mail delayed for more 
than a month—or longer. 
The dedicated postal workers at the 
Buffalo facility report that the situa-
tion has worsened in the past few days. 
Mail is sitting on the floor. Five of 20 
mail sorters were removed or de-
stroyed. 
Today I am calling on the Nation’s 
Postmaster to fix and to restore all 
mail sorters to the Buffalo facility. 
Our postal workers and letter car-
riers do great work for the American 
people. This administration needs to 
get out of the way and allow them to 
do their job, their good and honest pub-
lic service. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SUICIDE 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to mark National Suicide Aware-
ness Month. 
Unfortunately, Montanans are all too 
familiar with the epidemic of suicide. 
As we have faced this ongoing public 
health and economic crisis, the demand 
for mental health services has grown. 
In Gallatin County, my home, crisis 
response therapists have experienced a 
higher volume of calls. Each month 
they receive more calls than the last 
from people needing help. Centers 
throughout Montana are seeing similar 
increases. 
To confront the greater demand for 
services and to help people in crisis, we 
must ensure access to necessary re-
sources are available. One crucial re-
source is the national suicide hotline. 
I am grateful to my colleagues, Re-
publicans and Democrats, for working 
with me to designate 988 as the hot-
line’s number. I am proud of that bi-
partisan accomplishment. 
Let’s continue to provide these crit-
ical resources for those who need them 
the most and support them through 
their darkest hours. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEM-
ORY OF MADELEINE BRENNAN 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and mem-
ory of Ms. Madeleine Brennan, a legend 
in Dyker Heights and a testament to 
the idea that great schools begin with 
great leaders. 
For 50 years, Madeleine served as the 
principal 
of 
Dyker 
Heights 
Inter-
mediate School, making her the long-
est serving principal in New York City 
history and perhaps the entire country. 
She loved her job so much that even 
when her pension and 401(k) meant 
that she could make more money in re-
tirement, she kept on working. That 
passion inspired many of her students 
to not only become teachers them-
selves, but to return to Dyker Heights 
Intermediate School to work on her 
staff. 
Ms. Brennan passed away this past 
April, but her legacy lives on in the 
thousands of lives she influenced over 
the years. She will be dearly missed. 
f 
CONGRATULATING NICOLE BERG 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, some 
may say that I am biased, but I firmly 
believe that Washington State is home 
to the best farmers in the world. Today 
I rise to congratulate one of those in-
credible farmers, my fellow Washing-
tonian, Nicole Berg, for her appoint-
ment to the Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation board of directors. 
Nicole’s experience as a fourth-gen-
eration farmer in central Washington 
has provided her with a strong, yet per-
sonal, understanding of the needs of 
family-run farms in the United States. 
For many years, I have seen Nicole’s 
passion for putting food on America’s 
table. Her work with the National As-
sociation of Wheat Growers has been of 
immense benefit to the region and to 
the world. And there is no doubt in my 
mind that she will be a great asset to 
the Federal Crop Insurance Corpora-
tion. 
I wish Nicole the very best as she en-
ters this new chapter. Her appointment 
to the FCIC board of directors is well 
deserved, and I congratulate her on 
this fantastic achievement. 
f 
HONORING AMERICANS WHO LOST 
THEIR LIVES TO COVID–19 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor the over 200,000 Americans 
who have lost their lives to COVID–19 
and the over 7 million people who have 
been infected. 
The pandemic has put great stress on 
our communities and wreaked havoc on 
our economy. Millions of Americans 
have lost their jobs and, with it, their 
health insurance. 
During the pandemic, common sense 
would say we should strengthen our na-
tional healthcare system. President 
Trump and the congressional Repub-
licans continue their assault on the Af-
fordable Care Act, urging the courts to 
strike the law down. 
The House has passed 340 bipartisan 
health bills. The Senate refuses to take 
them up. 
The President signs executive orders 
that do nothing. They do not protect 
people with preexisting conditions or 
cover preventative medicine. The ACA 
does. 
The President claims to have a 
healthcare plan to replace the ACA, 
but he only intends to release it after 
the election. 
This is no way to govern. It is time 
to end the political stunts, to work 
across the aisle, and to get serious 
about the health of the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5062 
September 30, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on Tuesday, the insightful 
columnist Star Parker provided an ex-
traordinary analysis, ‘‘Supreme Court 
Fight is about Life and Death,’’ in the 
Aiken Standard. 
‘‘CHUCK
SCHUMER, Senate minority 
leader, says, ‘Our number one goal 
must be to communicate the stakes of 
this Supreme Court fight to the Amer-
ican people’ . . . ‘nothing is off the 
table.’ 
‘‘Nothing? Not even violence?’’ 
‘‘ . . . Senator SCHUMER is right that 
the American people must know what’s 
at stake. 
‘‘Will we have a culture of life and ci-
vility, or a culture of death, violence, 
and chaos. . . . ’’ 
‘‘Fortunately, 
President 
Donald 
Trump understands what is at stake.’’ 
Because of ‘‘the diligence of this 
President and the Republican Senate, 
we will soon see an outstanding con-
servative woman—one who respects 
both the sanctity of life and the sanc-
tity of our Nation’s institutions—fill 
this Court vacancy.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Godspeed, Amy Barrett and Carol 
Davis. 
f 
HONORING TOM WICKHAM 
(Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to recognize a faithful 
servant of the people’s House, Parlia-
mentarian Tom Wickham. 
Tom is only the fifth Parliamen-
tarian in this institution’s history, and 
he is concluding his 25 years of service 
in the Parliamentarian’s Office this 
week. 
One of the distinguishing features of 
Tom’s service has been his work with 
the House Democracy Partnership and 
his willingness to extend himself inter-
nationally, to share his experiences 
and insight with those organizing and 
administering parliaments in emerg-
ing, often struggling democracies. 
Just last fall, Members would have 
been heartened to see the reception 
that Tom, along with Clerk Cheryl 
Johnson and Shuwanza Goff, received 
from their counterparts in Kenya, Li-
beria, Ethiopia, and The Gambia. 
We have all benefited from Tom’s 
dedicated service and the skill, integ-
rity, and fairness he has brought to the 
Parliamentarian’s role. 
We wish him and his family Godspeed 
as they begin the next chapter of their 
lives. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NEW FREEDOM 
FARM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize New Freedom Farm in 
Buchanan, Virginia. 
Founded in 2016 by Lois Fritz, New 
Freedom Farm is a nonprofit commu-
nity that aids veterans suffering from 
post-traumatic stress disorder, sub-
stance abuse, and traumatic brain in-
jury. 
Through animal therapy, farming, 
and peer-to-peer support, this tremen-
dous organization strives to empower 
veterans and help them heal through 
the realization of their own efforts and 
contributions. The farm says its mis-
sion is to heal heroes through horses. 
At the facility, veterans often de-
velop deep friendships through equine 
activity and gentling, fostering, phys-
ical, emotional, and spiritual health, 
which helps with reintegration into ci-
vilian life. 
They offer their services to veterans 
entirely free of charge and say they are 
able to operate through donations and 
faith. 
I applaud the entire team at New 
Freedom Farm for their passion and 
commitment to serving those who 
serve our Nation. I wish them contin-
ued success moving forward and thank 
them for their incredible work.

CONGRATULATIONS, DALLASTOWN 
ELEMENTARY 
AREA 
SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the faculty, 
staff, and students of Dallastown Ele-
mentary School in the Dallastown 
Area School District on being recog-
nized as a 2020 National Blue Ribbon 
School. 
The National Blue Ribbon Schools 
Program was founded nearly 40 years 
ago to recognize outstanding public 
and private schools that are making a 
difference and exemplify excellence. 
Dallastown Elementary was recognized 
as an Exemplary High Performing 
School. 
I thank Dallastown Area Super-
intendent Dr. Joshua Doll, the school 
board, and the leadership and teachers 
at Dallastown Elementary for working 
so hard for this achievement. In their 
application, school principal Charles 
Patterson noted that one of the distin-
guishing characteristics he sees about 
Dallastown Elementary is that they 
have built a school family. The quality 
education these students receive pre-
pares them for success throughout the 
rest of their lives. 
Congratulations, 
again, 
to 
Dallastown 
Elementary 
School 
for 
being named a 2020 National Blue Rib-
bon School.

THE TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING ARE 
TWO-TIME STANLEY CUP CHAM-
PIONS 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bring some thunder to the 
House Chamber and recognize the now 
two-time 
Stanley 
Cup 
Champion 
Tampa Bay Lightning. 
Behind the leadership of Captain Ste-
ven Stamkos and Stanley Cup MVP 
Victor Hedman, the Bolts have en-
shrined themselves as one of the great-
est teams of all time. 
Although COVID prevented fans from 
attending the playoffs, the distant 
thunder of the greatest fans in hockey 
and the determination of the Lightning 
got them to the top of the mountain, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, as we say in Tampa 
Bay, Stanley Needs a Tan. And let me 
just say, it is sunny back in Tampa 
Bay. 
While one Tampa Bay championship 
run comes to an end, another begins. 
Best of luck to the Tampa Bay Rays as 
they begin their quest to secure their 
first World Series title. 
Let’s make Tampa Bay Title Town 
USA.

THANK YOU TO OUR MEN AND 
WOMEN IN UNIFORM 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
mind Mr. BILIRAKIS, everyone knows 
that Detroit is actually hockey town. 
Mr. Speaker, every day, members in 
law enforcement put on their uniform 
not knowing if they are going to come 
home, these mothers, fathers, sisters, 
brothers, sons, and daughters. 
In an era of heightened rhetoric, I 
stand here today to say thank you to 
our women and men in uniform. 
Recently, we have seen a rise in at-
tacks against police officers across the 
country and even in west Michigan. 
This month, officers in Muskegon 
Heights responded to a domestic dis-
turbance where two people were shot, 
one of them murdered. 
A police chase ensued when a deputy 
encountered the suspect driving the 
wrong way. When the deputy tried to 
apprehend the suspect while driving, he 
was fired upon. 
Multiple departments working to-
gether were able to use a police cruiser 
to disable the suspect’s vehicle. 
Unbeknownst to the officers, there 
was also a developmentally disabled 
woman in the backseat who was res-
cued and brought to safety. 
This incredible story follows a week-
end where 11 shootings took place in 
Grand Rapids. 
Despite all this, some of my col-
leagues still think that defunding the 
police is a good idea. I am here to tell 
you it is not. This will only hurt com-
munity policing initiatives for the very 
communities that need it the most. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to 
the incredible men and women who

HONORING ROYCE CARTER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
a great American. 
Mr. 
Royce 
Everett 
Carter 
of 
Blackshear, Georgia, passed away on 
September 12 at the age of 85. 
Royce was born and raised in Geor-
gia, and he lived in Pierce County for 
the past 52 years. 
Committed to improving transpor-
tation and infrastructure in the State 
of Georgia, he had worked for the Geor-
gia Department of Transportation as a 
project engineer for the State Highway 
Department until his retirement. 
Royce worked on several projects 
with T.R. Long Engineering over the 
years, including the Royce E. Carter 
roundabout on New School Road, which 
was dedicated to the work he did 
throughout his life to improve his com-
munity. 
He was a steadfast public servant 
who was always looking for opportuni-
ties to improve the lives around him. 
In his limited free time, he enjoyed 
golf, and took his appreciation for it to 
new heights when he served on the 
board of the Lakeview Golf Club and 
eventually became president. 
Royce loved his friends, his family, 
his community, and his church dearly, 
and he used every opportunity to make 
the most of the time he spent on this 
Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the 
life he lived, and I know his legacy will 
continue for years to come. 
I know that every time I drive the 
Royce E. Carter roundabout, I will re-
member the impact he made on Geor-
gia’s First Congressional District.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 1129, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 6270) to amend the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 to require issuers 
to make certain disclosures relating to 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion, and for other purposes, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1129, an amendment in the nature 
of a substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 116–64 is adopt-
ed and the bill, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 6270 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur Forced 
Labor Disclosure Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Since early 2017, the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China has conducted a pol-
icy of disappearance, mass internment, and im-
prisonment of Turkic Muslims, particularly 
Uyghurs, in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region (XUAR). 
(2) Since 2014, Chinese authorities have de-
tained between 800,000 and possibly up to three 
million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and 
other ethnic minorities in forced education, 
training, and labor camps. 
(3) The bi-partisan, bi-cameral Congressional- 
Executive Commission on China’s 2019 Annual 
Report found numerous reports of forced labor 
associated with government repression of ethnic 
minority groups in the XUAR. Detainees per-
formed forced labor in factories both within and 
outside of internment camps in XUAR. 
(4) Radio Free Asia reported in January 2019 
that authorities had also sent Uyghurs and 
Kazakhs from the XUAR to other provinces in 
China for forced labor. 
(5) Comments in March 2018 from the presi-
dent of the China National Textile and Apparel 
Council suggested that textile manufacturers 
were working with XUAR authorities to exploit 
forced labor. 
(6) Companies that work in the XUAR are at 
great risk of complicity in the human rights 
abuses being committed in the region. 
(7) In a March 2020 report, the Australian 
Strategic Policy Institute identified 27 factories 
in nine Chinese provinces that are using 
Uyghur labor transferred from Xinjiang. These 
factories indirectly supply global brands, in-
cluding many American multinational compa-
nies. 
(8) Forced labor in XUAR is Chinese govern-
ment policy and due diligence efforts to ensure 
clean supply chains is nearly impossible due to 
mass surveillance, pervasive police presence, 
and intimidation of workers. 
SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RE-
LATING TO THE XINJIANG UYGHUR 
AUTONOMOUS REGION. 
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(s) DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RE-
LATING TO THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS 
REGION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than the end of 
the 180-day period beginning on the date of en-
actment of this subsection, the Commission shall 
issue rules to require each issuer required to file 
an annual report under this section or section 
15(d) or a proxy statement under section 14 to 
disclose in each such report or proxy statement 
whether, during the period covered by the report 
or proxy statement— 
‘‘(A) the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer, 
directly or indirectly, engaged with an entity or 
the affiliate of an entity to import— 
‘‘(i) manufactured goods, including elec-
tronics, food products, textiles, shoes, and teas, 
that originated in the XUAR; or 
‘‘(ii) manufactured goods containing materials 
that originated or are sourced in the XUAR; 
‘‘(B) with respect to any goods or materials 
described under subparagraph (A), whether the 
goods or material originated in forced labor 
camps; and 
‘‘(C) with respect to each manufactured good 
or material described under subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(i) the nature and extent of the commercial 
activity related to such good or material; 
‘‘(ii) the gross revenue and net profits, if any, 
attributable to the good or material; and 
‘‘(iii) whether the issuer or the affiliate of the 
issuer intends to continue with such importa-
tion. 
‘‘(2) AVAILABILITY

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 6270 and to insert extra-
neous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Disclosure Act of 2020, important legis-
lation introduced by Representative 
WEXTON, a valued member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services. 
The Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking 
Muslim group and are one of a number 
of Muslim groups in Xinjiang that are 
persecuted, arbitrarily arrested, de-
tained in forced labor concentration 
camps, and even executed. It has been 
reported by human rights advocates 
that over 1 million people are being 
held by the Chinese Government in de-
tention camps across the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
The Government of the People’s Re-
public of China falsely refers to these 
concentration 
camps 
as 
vocational 
camps or reeducation camps. 
Make no mistake: The truth is that 
today, in 2020, 1 million human beings 
are being held in concentration camps 
where they are beaten, starved, and 
forced to work long hours in conditions

that can only be described as inhu-
mane. Their relatives often have no 
idea where they are or whether they 
are alive. They are dying each day due 
to the cruelty of their living conditions 
and the brutality of the Chinese Gov-
ernment, which executes them with 
impunity. 
Within these concentration camps, 
the Uyghurs are used as slave labor to 
make 
goods 
and 
products 
for 
unsuspecting 
American 
consumers. 
Each day, millions of us unknowingly 
buy, use, and transport products made 
by the hands of people who are held in 
these government-run detention cen-
ters while their families wait for some 
proof of life that may never come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote for H.R. 6270. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
6270. 
Republicans are unwavering in our 
support to hold China accountable for 
the human rights violations that are 
occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region, or the XUAR. 
We agree with each other on the facts 
on the ground, from the oppression 
that the Uyghurs are feeling, to the 
forced labor camps. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would remind 
my colleagues that we passed H.R. 6210 
last week, literally last week, on a bi-
partisan basis to address these human 
rights violations. 
Moreover, to date, the Trump admin-
istration has taken significant action 
to punish human rights violators in the 
region, including recent sanctions and 
additions to the Commerce Depart-
ment’s Entity List. 
On the other hand, this window- 
dressing bill, put forth by the Demo-
crats less than a month before the elec-
tion and a week after we actually 
passed legislation, will not hold any 
bad actors accountable. 
Adding additional mandatory disclo-
sures for public companies is not the 
appropriate way to curtail human 
rights atrocities. 
Sanctioning is the most effective way 
to hold these human rights abusers ac-
countable. 
The framework of this bill is deeply 
flawed. First, the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, the SEC, has no 
foreign policy expertise. The SEC’s 
three-part mission is to: one, protect 
investors; two, maintain fair, orderly, 
and efficient markets; and third, facili-
tate capital formation here in the 
United States. 
The Treasury and State Department 
handle the sanctions regime. 
We should instead be working with 
both the State Department and Treas-
ury to hold these bad actors account-
able, not the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that 
we are working with the State Depart-
ment and Treasury. 
To be clear, this bill would require 
the SEC to issue rules regarding Amer-
ican companies, and only American 
companies, to disclose whether they or 
any of their affiliates directly or indi-
rectly engaged with an entity or an af-
filiate of an entity to import not only 
goods from the XUAR, but also goods 
containing materials originating or 
sourced from the XUAR. 
Now, we all have been talking about 
Disney a lot and a lot of other places 
that have had content from, seemingly, 
this area. 
So now let’s look at what this would 
mean for a manufacturer. Let’s look at 
what this would mean in so many var-
ious areas of our economy. 
This means that companies would be 
required to know if its affiliates, its 
suppliers, anyone they may have a re-
lationship with, are ‘‘indirectly en-
gaged with affiliates of certain compa-
nies.’’ 
So you may not be doing something 
directly, but an affiliate or a partner of 
yours may be doing something with an 
affiliate or a partner of somebody else 
that may be dealing and doing some 
business in that area. 
This is a poorly constructed disclo-
sure regime where a public company 
would be required to disclose impos-
sible-to-discern information, and it 
would be liable for securities fraud, a 
very powerful word, if it is impossible 
to discern information that is not dis-
closed correctly. 
So think about that. They may not 
know they are breaking the law, this 
law, but they would be held account-
able for that. 
Further, the bill does not contain a 
sunset clause, and the disclosure re-
quirement would apply indefinitely 
even if behavior in the region has 
changed. 
This bill’s framework has proven dis-
astrous. 
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act 
mandated disclosures relating to the 
use of conflict minerals that originated 
in the DRC, or the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, or an adjoining country. 
There is an entire Great Lakes region, 
they call it, in Africa. 
The implementation of section 1502 
cost billions of dollars—Democrat esti-
mates put it at over $7 billion—and the 
provisions led to devastating job losses, 
not here in America, but in Africa. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill did not go 
through regular order either, I might 
add. 
Committee Republicans have not had 
the opportunity to make substantive 
changes or suggestions, let alone exam-
ine the bill’s likely harmful con-
sequences. 
So, again, just last week, the House 
passed H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act, to hold China 
accountable. That is where the respon-
sibility lies, with China, not U.S. com-
panies or the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
b 1130 
Today, we are only trying to give a 
vulnerable Member and other Demo-
crats who feel the need to ‘‘get tough 
on China all of a sudden’’ a win—sad, in 
my opinion. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 
6270, as it will limit opportunities for 
everyday investors, reduce the number 
of public companies, increase compli-
ance costs on businesses, and may 
harm, actually, the Uyghurs them-
selves who this bill is intending to pro-
tect. 
Let’s go after China. Let’s not go 
after the Uyghurs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
WEXTON), a distinguished member of 
the Financial Services Committee and 
the sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for working with 
me on this important legislation and 
for her unwavering commitment to de-
fending human rights and demanding 
accountability, two things that H.R. 
6270 would do. 
I also wish to thank Representatives 
JIM MCGOVERN and CHRIS SMITH for 
their leadership and commend them on 
their hard work on the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act, which passed 
the House overwhelmingly last week. 
Both of them have worked tirelessly to 
shine a light on the atrocities taking 
place in Xinjiang. 
Speaker PELOSI pointed out that it 
was Congressman SMITH and Congress-
man Frank Wolf who, years ago, vis-
ited a forced labor camp and reported 
back to the U.S. Congress and to the 
world about what was happening there. 
Frank Wolf held my seat in Vir-
ginia’s 10th Congressional District for 
34 years, so I am proud to continue his 
important work defending religious 
freedom and human rights. For that 
reason, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act. 
This legislation is a critical and long- 
overdue human rights disclosure bill 
that will inform investors and the mar-
kets of publicly traded companies’ pas-
sive complicity or active exploitation 
of one of the most pressing and ongoing 
human rights violations of our life-
time. 
For years, the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China has been en-
gaged in the mass internment of reli-
gious 
minorities 
in 
the 
Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region. Because 
of the well-documented and massive 
scale of abuses committed in the re-
gion, Xinjiang has become globally no-
torious for human rights violations, in-
cluding the extensive use of forced 
labor. 
Chinese authorities have used the 
pretext of terrorism to suspend civil 
and political rights, including the in-
ternment of more than 1 million 
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in 
reeducation centers across Xinjiang, 
where they are subjected to harsh 
abuse and forbidden from practicing 
their religious or cultural beliefs.

H5065 
September 30, 2020 
These reeducation centers also func-
tion as forced labor camps where var-
ious goods, especially those made from 
cotton, the region’s top export, are 
manufactured 
with 
forced 
Uyghur 
labor and sent to producers and con-
sumers around the world. 
Chinese manufacturers are provided 
development assistance to build fac-
tories in or near the camps to take ad-
vantage of detainee labor. Through 
government-sponsored endeavors like 
the mutual pairing assistance program, 
former detainees are transferred from 
Xinjiang to other parts of China for 
factory labor, where they are separated 
from their families, live in segregated 
dormitories, and are assigned minders 
who monitor their every move. 
It is important to point out that a lot 
of these workers were accomplished 
people in Uyghur society. We are talk-
ing about professors, doctors, and jour-
nalists, educated, successful people 
who had their livelihoods taken from 
them. Their only crime was being 
Uyghur. 
Shockingly, reports show that many 
of these factories supply manufactured 
materials for some of the largest com-
panies in the world, and some of these 
products are finding their way to U.S. 
consumers. 
The U.S. has banned imports made 
with forced labor since 1930, and U.S. 
companies are required to exercise due 
diligence in order to better understand 
their supply chains and potential links 
to forced labor. But traditional human 
rights due diligence efforts are falling 
short in Xinjiang, where forced labor is 
widespread and systemic in the re-
gional economy. 
Xinjiang is also tightly controlled. 
Travel to the region is restricted, mak-
ing efforts to audit supply chains near-
ly impossible. Auditors have reportedly 
been detained, threatened, and stopped 
at airports. Workers are intimidated 
not to talk. 
Just last week, five supply chain au-
diting 
organizations 
pulled 
out 
of 
Xinjiang, citing restricted access and 
increased difficulty in meeting audit-
ing standards. 
Despite all of this, international 
companies continue to source from 
Xinjiang or allow products from labor 
from the region to come into their sup-
ply chains. 
My legislation, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Disclosure Act, would require 
the SEC to issue rules requiring pub-
licly traded companies to annually dis-
close imports of manufactured goods 
and materials that originate in or are 
sourced from Xinjiang. 
Because of the strong likelihood that 
products from Xinjiang were created 
using forced labor from concentration 
camp prisoners, companies that import 
products and materials from the region 
face greater legal reputational and fi-
nancial risks that may impact their 
short- and long-term value. 
Just as important, shareholders and 
consumers have the right to know 
whether their hard-earned dollars are 
being invested in companies whose sup-
ply chains benefit from forced labor. It 
is critical that publicly traded compa-
nies disclose this so that investors 
have the information that they need to 
make the best investment decisions 
possible and to ensure that no parts of 
our market or economy utilize forced 
labor or are complicit in further viola-
tions of human rights. 
The gentleman from Michigan be-
lieves that sanctions would be a better 
option. Sanctions need to be part of the 
solution, and I, along with others, 
pushed the Trump administration to 
sanction the Chinese Government offi-
cials and entities. When they finally 
did, I finally supported that. I firmly 
agree with what they did. 
But sanctions alone aren’t effective. 
We need a multipronged approach that 
deals with the supply side and the de-
mand side. 
It was mentioned that it is not pos-
sible to exercise the kind of due dili-
gence necessary. What price a human 
life? There are lots of opportunities for 
publicly traded companies to pressure 
their suppliers not to take advantage 
of this forced labor, and it could cause 
reputational and financial risks and 
burdens to the company if they are 
found out that they are profiting from 
this forced labor. 
My 
bill, 
along 
with 
Chairman 
MCGOVERN’s, H.R. 6270, which passed 
overwhelmingly last week, sends a 
strong message that the United States 
economy and the financial system will 
not tolerate human rights abuse. I urge 
my colleagues to support the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Disclosure Act. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6270 be-
fore us here today. 
China is the greatest existential 
threat that our country has faced in 
my lifetime. From their efforts to dis-
place the U.S. as an international lead-
er, to hurting our job creators and 
workers, 
to 
China’s 
human 
rights 
abuses, the U.S. needs to work in a bi-
partisan and strategic way with our al-
lies to fight back against the CCP. 
That is why I was honored to serve 
on the House China Task Force that 
just today released our comprehensive 
report. From this report, we have rec-
ommended hundreds of policy proposals 
and ideas, over 60 percent of which are 
bipartisan, on the most effective ways 
to counter the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
Unfortunately, this piece of legisla-
tion before us today misses the mark, 
though I do appreciate my colleagues’ 
intent. 
Once again, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are attempting 
to use the SEC, which has no foreign 
policy expertise and whose mission is 
to, one, protect investors; two, main-
tain fair, orderly, and efficient mar-
kets; and, three, facilitate capital for-
mation. This bill seeks to make that 
group, the SEC, an enforcer to accom-
plish a policy objective completely un-
related to their mission and expertise. 
This responsibility is better housed 
in the Treasury Department, where we 
do have the expertise and the tools to 
effectively punish those who support 
the grotesque human rights violations 
that the CCP inflicts on the Uyghurs. 
One final point. I would like to re-
mind everyone that this bill never 
went through a markup and received 
zero hearings on the Financial Services 
Committee, primarily because, as we 
all know, these virtual hearings are 
awful, to put it kindly. The virtual 
hearings do not work, and they serve as 
a tremendous disservice to our con-
stituents. 
Since the pandemic struck, we have 
not held a single markup as a com-
mittee. What is the purpose of our 
committee if we can’t even figure out 
how to mark up a bill? 
There is so much work to be done 
here, and we aren’t seriously taking up 
any of it. We can and must find a way 
to safely and effectively hold real hear-
ings and real markups in a socially 
distanced way so that we can do the 
job that the American people sent us 
here to do. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
legislation. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman, Ms. WEXTON, 
for bringing this legislation before the 
House. 
To be very candid with you, upon re-
viewing the materials that have been 
submitted to me, I was absolutely 
amazed that this kind of activity is 
taking place. 
Forced labor. Is that what they are 
calling it now when you force people to 
work, when you separate families, 
when you have persons denounce their 
religion, when you put them in reedu-
cation centers? Is that what this is all 
about, forced labor? 
I have a history that requires me to 
speak up and speak out on these issues. 
Forced labor is how I got to this coun-
try. If you understand my history, you 
have to understand why I am abso-
lutely, totally, and completely opposed 
to what is happening to the Uyghurs. 
This is unconscionable, and it is unac-
ceptable. 
I am proud to be a person who will 
strongly recommend to my colleagues 
that we not allow this to continue. It is 
one thing to have the forced labor, and 
then to compound it by having Amer-
ican companies benefit from the forced 
labor, that is sinful. It is criminal in 
international courts, but it is also just 
sinful that American companies would 
participate in this kind of activity. 
I think this notion that they should 
be audited, their supply chains should 
be audited, is more than reasonable. 
Why would we not want to know 
whether American companies are par-
ticipating in this kind of behavior? We 
need to know.

How do we find out? Audit the supply 
chain. It just makes sense that we 
would do this. 
I don’t understand how we can oppose 
trying to find out if this kind of activ-
ity is being engaged in by American 
companies. 
Finally, this: I don’t understand how 
we consistently find people opposed to 
making inquiries about the suffering of 
other people. At some point, the people 
who are suffering have to be given 
some opportunity to have their suf-
fering addressed. And it doesn’t matter 
where they are in the world. Suffering 
has to be addressed. We cannot allow it 
to happen there because, if we do, it 
can happen here. 
I am absolutely supportive of H.R. 
6270, and I strongly encourage my col-
leagues to help us end the suffering of 
the Uyghur people. 
I just spoke to a constituent who is 
of Chinese ancestry who said to me 
that she believes all of this to be true. 
I just don’t understand how we can 
oppose this piece of legislation, and I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
it. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 23 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 18 minutes remaining. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. WEXTON). 
b 1145 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Parliamentary in-
quiry, Mr. Speaker. 
Is it appropriate— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. The gentlewoman 
from Virginia may yield for a par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The gentlewoman is recognized. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Will the gentle-
woman yield for a parliamentary in-
quiry? 
Ms. WEXTON. The gentlewoman will 
not yield, no. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from 
Michigan raises a couple of points in 
his argument saying that H.R. 6270 is 
redundant because of the McGovern 
bill. None of the disclosures that are 
required by this bill are required under 
H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act. There is no overlap. In 
fact, we worked very hard to make sure 
that the two bills were complementary. 
H.R. 6210 imposes a disclosure obliga-
tion for certain activities the issuer is 
knowingly engaged in, which is appro-
priate in certain circumstances. Im-
port-related 
activities 
are 
covered 
under H.R. 6270. The issuer would have 
an affirmative obligation to know their 
suppliers, so they would have to engage 
in due diligence to determine whether 
they were engaging in supporting these 
forced labor practices. 
Companies that continue to import 
from the region despite the over-
whelming evidence of forced labor 
practices should, at the very least, be 
required to actively audit their supply 
chains, and that is what this legisla-
tion would require. 
Another issue that was brought up by 
the gentleman from Michigan is that 
this is like a supply chain disclosure 
requirement under Dodd-Frank. Rule 
1502 had required publicly traded com-
panies to disclose whether their prod-
ucts contained certain minerals that 
have been known to finance violent 
conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, but 
that comparison misses the point. The 
implication is that businesses will find 
these disclosure requirements so bur-
densome that they will have to divest 
from the region and local jobs will be 
lost. 
The business environment is not the 
same in the DRC as it is in Xinjiang, 
where free enterprise does not exist 
and people are being put into con-
centration camps and work camps 
against their will. We should be push-
ing companies to reassess their supply 
chains in Xinjiang and find alter-
natives, preferably here in America, 
where they are not exploiting forced 
labor. Unlike legitimate mining jobs in 
the DRC, we want these forced labor 
jobs to go away. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, a report published ear-
lier this year by the Australian Stra-
tegic Policy Institute noted that Nike, 
Adidas, and Apple all had supply chains 
that included Uyghur workers laboring 
under forced conditions. It is critical 
that investors in these companies be 
given the information they need to 
consider the legal, reputational, and fi-
nancial risks associated with investing 
in these and other publicly traded U.S. 
companies with forced labor in their 
supply chain. And it is equally critical 
that, when required to disclose this in-
formation, these companies confront 
the reality of their choices and make 
decisions that don’t contribute to suf-
fering, racism, and death. 
Representative WEXTON’s bill, H.R. 
6270, is a necessary step in ending this 
injustice. Her bill would require the 
SEC to issue rules requiring publicly 
traded companies to annually disclose 
imports of manufactured goods and 
materials that originate or are sourced 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region. It would also require the SEC 
and the GAO to provide information to 
Congress regarding these disclosures, 
as well as oversight. 
So I would like to just speak briefly 
to the misleading letter from the 
Chamber of Commerce opposing H.R. 
6270 on the grounds that a similar sup-
ply chain due diligence effort—that is, 
section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 
Congo conflict mineral law—failed and 
caused the situation to worsen. I am 
encouraged by their letter because, 
when your opponents have to use dis-
honest arguments to their make their 
case, Mr. Speaker, it means they have 
no legitimate ones to make. 
So, despite every effort on the other 
side of the aisle to take down the con-
flict mineral law and to weaken and 
eliminate the conflict mineral rule, I 
am proud to say that support for sec-
tion 1502 has been sustained by a sense 
of moral responsibility and by the fact 
that evidence is showing that the rule 
is having positive effects. Indeed, the 
conflict mineral rule continues to spur 
these intense efforts to operationalize 
and expand regional, national, and in-
dustry due diligence systems. 
The U.N. Group of Experts on the 
DRC has reported that section 1502 
‘‘has had a massive and welcome im-
pact so far, requiring chain partici-
pants all over the world to take due 
diligence and conflict financing seri-
ously. This should not and must not be 
thrown away or weakened.’’ 
Likewise, H.R. 6270 is a critical com-
ponent of the effort by the House to 
marshal the might of the United States 
economy and American conscience to 
make clear the reprehensible nature of 
China’s actions on a minority in its 
country. 
This bill complements another bill 
that passed the House last week, H.R. 
6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor Preven-
tion Act. That bill provides mecha-
nisms that will require the United 
States to establish a diplomatic strat-
egy and issue reports that will assist 
all interested parties in implementing 
H.R. 6270 and provides complementary 
disclosures for public companies. So, if 
you supported H.R. 6210, Mr. Speaker, 
then you should also vote for H.R. 6270. 
The bill before us also enjoys the sup-
port of a wide array of civic-minded or-
ganizations, including the AFL–CIO, 
Public Citizen, the Uyghur American 
Association, Human Rights First, and 
the Uyghur Human Rights Association. 
We must all stand up against the un-
just and inhumane treatment of the 
Uyghurs and push China to end this 
brutality once and for all. I believe 
that resolve will not weaken just be-
cause China happens to be the second 
largest economy in the world. Just as 
each Member of this Chamber knows 
that this is wrong, so do our U.S. com-
panies, investors, and the American 
public. 
So I would like to just relate to some 
of what Mr. GREEN has said as he tried 
to make our friends on the opposite 
side of the aisle understand why we are 
so invested in this legislation. 
We are descendants of slaves—let me 
say that one more time; we are de-
scendants of slaves—and when we learn 
about slavery anywhere in the world, 
we are opposed to it. There is no jus-
tification for it. It does not matter 
whether it is the principals or their as-
sociates who are involved with prod-
ucts and services, et cetera, as a result 
of slave labor. We are opposed to it, 
and we would ask our Members on the 
opposite side of the aisle to have a sen-
sitivity to that when they oppose slav-
ery no matter where it is and who is 
causing it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5067 
September 30, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I consume. 
Let me just address the point that 
was just brought up, Mr. Speaker. 
There is a sensitivity to that. There 
has been an injustice in our history, 
there is no doubt, and we need to ad-
dress that now. Obviously, it was ad-
dressed at the time, but it has been on-
going. 
But whether it was the slave traf-
ficking that the chairlady was talking 
about or whether it was family mem-
bers of my wife who were enslaved by 
Nazis in work camps or whether they 
are modern-day slave labor camps like 
this with the Uyghurs, this must be 
stamped out. This must be stamped 
out. We are in robust agreement about 
the problem and about the issue. 
The question here is enforcement and 
responsibility. So, Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to read a quote from the head of 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion. We heard about moral obligation 
and those kinds of things. This is what 
the head of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission said: ‘‘As we all 
know, the SEC has little or no experi-
ence in crafting trade sanctions or ar-
ticulating and enforcing human rights 
policy, two areas which have not tradi-
tionally been within the purview of se-
curities regulation.’’ 
This is from Mary Jo White, Barack 
Obama’s head of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission. 
So this is not a partisan issue. This is 
not a question of whether you support 
Uyghur slavery or not. I am offended if 
our colleagues are trying to portray it 
as that. I don’t think they are, but that 
may be kind of how they are tinting it. 
And I might refer everybody to the fact 
that, last week, we passed a bipartisan 
bill addressing this very issue. 
But this is about enforcement. This 
is about the State Department doing 
its job. This is about the Treasury De-
partment doing its job, and, yes, our 
Financial Services Committee, which 
has done its job with sanctions. We are 
very much a part of that sanction re-
gime with the Department of the 
Treasury. 
So, please, Mr. Speaker, do not mis-
understand, 
and 
please 
don’t 
mis-
construe opposition to this particular 
bill. Again, we have no disagreement 
about the atrocities. We have no dis-
agreement about what is happening on 
the ground to the Uyghurs and, frank-
ly, to others. 
By the way, if this was about others, 
we would include others, but it is nar-
rowed down to the Uyghurs. 
So I am hoping and I am praying that 
this isn’t just a political ploy to look 
tough on China, finally, but I hope this 
is really about helping people, because 
I know that is why I am here. 
So I want to make sure, whether it is 
a young lady in the Philippians who is 
in sex slavery or whether it is a Uyghur 
in a labor camp or whether it was my 
wife’s family that was imprisoned by 
the Japanese in internment camps in 
Indonesia or in the Netherlands under 
the Nazis or whether it was our broth-
ers and sisters who came here involun-
tarily as slaves, we have to recognize 
the evil and the sinfulness behind this, 
as my friend and colleague from Texas 
had talked about its being sinful. I 
wholeheartedly agree. 
The question is: How are we going to 
remediate that and address it? Unfor-
tunately, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission is not the right vehicle for 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to inquire through the Chair if my 
colleague has any remaining speakers 
on his side. I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, we are 
hoping to get one more person here 
who is on their way, so I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
help buy some time until the opposite 
side gets its speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had a good, ro-
bust conversation, and we have agreed 
violently here on the problem and on 
the issue that we need to address. 
Again, we have no disagreement about 
the atrocities against the Uyghurs. We 
have no disagreement about what is 
happening on the ground and the des-
picableness of the CCP, the Chinese 
Government. 
Mr. Speaker, I really hope that it is 
not simply that the Democrats are 
wanting to appear ‘‘tough on China’’ by 
pushing through an empty window 
dressing bill that hurts U.S. investors 
and companies but, unfortunately, sim-
ply pays lip service to the Uyghurs 
with a framework that has already 
been proven disastrous. 
And I just read a short while ago the 
quote from Barack Obama’s head of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Mary Jo White, who said that the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission is 
not equipped for this. Using the SEC as 
social police didn’t work with conflict 
minerals, and it won’t work as we all 
attempt to protect the Uyghurs. 
b 1200 
I would remind my Democrat col-
leagues, again, that a year ago, Repub-
licans put forth strong proposals to 
prohibit 
taxpayer-backed 
financing 
through the Export-Import Bank from 
going to the CCP, the Chinese Com-
munist Party, the Chinese Govern-
ment. Our proposals had real teeth in 
them. 
Sadly, the Democrats on our com-
mittee rejected this proposal with no 
real explanation. So instead, Demo-
crats want to target our securities laws 
and make the SEC responsible for for-
eign policy. In fact, targeting our secu-
rities law is the Democrats’ solution 
for 
virtually 
everything—climate 
change, outsourcing, conflict minerals, 
not enough mustard at the ballpark. It 
is not the job of the SEC to make sure 
that these things are happening. It is 
our job and Treasury’s job and the 
State Department’s job to make sure 
that those sanctions are in place. 
This bill does not target the problem. 
Instead, it simply puts, not just incon-
venient duties on the plates of these 
publicly traded companies, no, it ac-
cuses them of fraud—fraud—over some-
thing that is impossible for them to de-
termine. On top of it, it requires en-
forcement from an agency that simply 
cannot do it. 
Sanctioning bad actors is the appro-
priate and most effective way to punish 
human rights abusers, as sanctions 
hurt the Chinese Communist Party 
without hurting the Uyghurs or the 
American capital markets or other in-
vestors and employees around the 
world. And ironically, sanctions cover 
everyone. If you are a privately held 
company that is using materials from a 
source that is under sanctions, guess 
what? You just broke the law. You 
can’t do that. 
Now under this, if we are only using 
the SEC, guess who the SEC applies to? 
Publicly traded companies only. So 
those private companies could still go 
along their merry way doing business 
with those folks. Yet, these publicly 
traded companies have this massive 
burden put on them, enforced by an 
agency that says it cannot enforce 
them. I would like to see everyone cov-
ered, not just these publicly traded 
companies. 
Mr. Speaker, both the House and the 
administration have taken meaningful 
action to combat human rights viola-
tors in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region. This includes recent 
sanctions imposed by the administra-
tion on a number of China’s 25-member 
ruling Politburo and party secretary of 
the region, as well as additions to the 
Commerce Department’s Entity List. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I request 
my colleagues oppose H.R. 6270, not be-
cause we don’t agree on the goal, not 
that we don’t want to make sure that 
the Uyghurs are protected, but because 
using an agency to enforce the law is 
the wrong direction to go. We are lit-
erally asking the street department to 
go be the police department. And 
whether you are doing the fire depart-
ment or the street maintenance, or 
something else in the city government, 
you may be good at that but that 
doesn’t mean you are a good police de-
partment or a good fire department. So 
let’s not ask the SEC to do that job, 
the job of the State Department. 
Mr. Speaker, this is only going to be 
hurting 
those 
American 
investors, 
those American companies, everyday 
investors, who are trying to make sure 
that they get a reasonable return, yet, 
have a concern to protect the Uyghurs

that, unfortunately, this bill fails to 
do. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 10 minutes remaining 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, disclosure may seem to 
be a small thing. It is a powerful thing. 
It will force publicly traded companies 
to audit their supply chains and ensure 
investors are better informed regarding 
their investments. Moreover, the re-
ports Congress will receive under this 
legislation will help us shape our fu-
ture legislative efforts. 
In its letter, supporting H.R. 6270, the 
Uyghur American Association stated: 
Passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act of 2020, H.R. 6270, is one necessary 
step in leveraging our collective power to 
put a stop to this genocide. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just take a mo-
ment to talk about slavery. And as I 
mentioned earlier, those of us who are 
descendants of slaves are very much al-
ways interested in what we can do to 
stop slavery wherever it is or to stop it 
before it starts. 
Mr. Speaker and Members, let me 
just say, while my friend on the oppo-
site side of the aisle makes an argu-
ment about the inconvenience and the 
loss of money to American firms, slav-
ery is always about money. Slavery in 
this country was about labor. It was 
about using those who they brought 
over on slave ships from Africa to pick 
cotton, and to enrich those owners on 
the plantations that were involved 
with cotton as its major trade, as its 
major source of income and profit. 
So we cannot be sympathetic to any 
argument that talks about it is going 
to inconvenience investors or Amer-
ican companies. Slavery is about ex-
ploitation and the use of other human 
beings in order, basically, to derive a 
profit from their work and from the 
fact that they are slaves. So when my 
friend on the opposite side of the aisle 
talks about, he, too, is sympathetic to 
the arguments that are made against 
slavery—and he points out that his own 
wife was a victim of slavery, as he 
talks about what happened to her and 
her family, as we all know, and we cer-
tainly are opposed to the Holocaust 
and what happened—let us focus on the 
fact that whether you are talking 
about the Holocaust or whether you 
are talking about slavery with the 
Uyghurs, whether you are talking 
about slavery that we experienced as 
African Americans brought over on 
slave ships, slavery is slavery no mat-
ter where it takes place. 
So, no, we are not sympathetic to the 
fact that investors may lose money if, 
in fact, we stop slavery. We are not 
sympathetic to the fact that it is an in-
convenience and that somehow the 
SEC should not be burdened with the 
responsibility to deal with this, they 
don’t know how to deal with this. 
Well, I will tell you something: His-
tory has taught us that for all of those 
who turned their backs and said, they 
didn’t understand, they didn’t see, but 
they didn’t agree, but they didn’t know 
what was going on, that is how these 
injustices continue, when people turn a 
blind eye. 
I don’t care whether it is the SEC or 
any other agency of government who 
can make the argument that they are 
not equipped to do what we are asking 
them to do. Then go and get your act 
together and get equipped because the 
Congress of the United States is charg-
ing you with this responsibility. And 
when you tell me that we should re-
spect the SEC, saying that it has not 
had the kind of experience that is need-
ed in order to deal with this issue, let 
me just share with you that I don’t 
care whether it is an appointee by 
Obama or anybody else. One of the rea-
sons I have created a subcommittee on 
diversity and inclusion is because most 
of the agencies of government, particu-
larly in financial services, you don’t 
have people who look like me who are 
going to stand up and take on these 
issues. 
Unfortunately, a lack of caring, a 
lack of understanding, a lack of experi-
ence—or whatever you want to call it— 
we are about opening up these agencies 
so that we have people who will stand 
up, just like I am standing up here 
today, and teach you about that which 
you don’t know, or you don’t under-
stand. 
So when I take a look at the SEC or 
the OCC or the Treasury or the Federal 
Reserve, none of them, none of them 
have people in management positions 
who will talk about the experiences of 
those in this country—African Ameri-
cans and our ancestors—in a way that 
will create the sensitivity for change. 
So we are always focused and centered 
on justice, and we understand injustice 
when we see it—we feel it very deeply— 
and we are opening up these agencies 
and we are providing the leadership on 
diversity and inclusion so that we can 
get people in these agencies who are 
willing to do the job and to help share 
the information that is needed to cre-
ate change. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, 
which is a most important step to-
wards protecting our investors and 
doing our part as global citizens. It is 
our moral imperative to do everything 
we can to stand up against injustice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1129, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. MCHENRY. In its current form, 
yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McHenry moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 6270 to the Committee on Financial 
Services with instructions to report the 
same back to the House forthwith with the 
following amendment: 
Page 3, after line 2, insert the following: 
(9) The bi-partisan, bi-cameral Congres-
sional Executive Commission on China’s 2019 
Annual Report made recommendations to 
address the human rights atrocities occur-
ring in the XUAR, including recommending 
the Administration ‘‘aggregate policy re-
sponses within the U.S. Government to ad-
dress gross human rights violations in the 
XUAR, including by Using Global Magnitsky 
Human Rights Accountability Act (Public 
Law No. 114–328) sanctions to hold account-
able Chinese business entities and officials 
complicit in the mass internment and sur-
veillance of Uyghurs and other Turkic Mus-
lim minorities and to encourage like-minded 
allies to issue their own sanctions’’. 
(10) In the same report, the Commission 
recommended Holding Chinese Government 
Officials Accountable for Abuses by levying 
financial sanctions against Chinese officials 
complicit in human rights violations against 
the Uyghur people in XUAR. 
(11) The Trump Administration has taken 
meaningful action to combat human rights 
violators in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region (XUAR), including recent sanc-
tions and additions to the Commerce Depart-
ment’s Entity List. 
(12) Targeted sanctions, such as financial 
sanctions led by the Department of Treas-
ury, are the more effective method for ad-
dressing the issue of human rights violations 
against the Uyghurs by authorities of the 
People’s Republic of China and for punishing 
those bad actors. 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
The sense of the Congress is the following: 
(1) Using securities law is misguided and 
will not protect the vulnerable in the XUAR 
nor does it appropriately target or punish 
those that continue to oppress them. 
(2) Attempts to address human rights vio-
lations of the type being committed against 
the Uyghur people in XUAR using the securi-
ties laws will not improve the quality of life 
for the Uyghur people. Freedom for the 
Uyghur people will only come by holding the 
Chinese Communist Party accountable. 
SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
The amendment made by section 3 shall 
take effect on the date that the commis-
sioners of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission unanimously report to Congress that 
the amendment required by section 3 will 
improve the lives of the oppressed in the 
XUAR and ultimately lead to their freedom, 
target bad actors in the Chinese Communist 
Party in a more effective manner than sanc-
tions would, and will cause no negative im-
pact on the population similar to the unin-
tended negative effects caused by the con-
flict minerals provisions under section 13(p) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Mr. MCHENRY (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to dispense with the reading of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5069 
September 30, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
North Carolina is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of his motion. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment will not kill the bill. It 
will make this a serious piece of legis-
lation rather than just a political talk-
ing point, which is what it currently is. 
The legislation will then target real 
human rights abuses. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans in this 
House have been standing against the 
Chinese Communist Party and the ris-
ing threat it presents, not only to the 
American businesses in our commu-
nity, in our economy, but also to na-
tional security. And Republicans have 
also worked to address the atrocities 
committed against the Uyghur people, 
including in the House Committee on 
Financial Services. Republicans stand 
with the Trump administration against 
communism and the global threat the 
Chinese 
Government 
poses, 
while 
Democrats have excused the Chinese 
Communist Party’s actions for years. 
Just last year, we offered House 
Democrats an opportunity in the Com-
mittee on Financial Services, to stand 
up against the Chinese Communist 
Party, and they didn’t. And we offered 
them the opportunity to stand against 
human rights abuses against religious 
minorities in China, and they didn’t 
work with us. 
We had those votes when we consid-
ered the reauthorization of U.S. Ex-
port-Import Bank. Instead of joining 
us, Democrats voted to allow compa-
nies owned by the Chinese Communist 
Party to receive U.S.-taxpayer sub-
sidies, subsidies that support the very 
people committing these human rights 
atrocities in which they are now, all of 
a sudden, a few days before the elec-
tion, against. 
Mr. Speaker, if you look at that vote 
tally, you will see today’s bill’s spon-
sor’s name. She voted against these Re-
publican measures to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable, includ-
ing 
holding 
them 
accountable 
for 
abuses against the Uyghur people. So 
what has changed? 
Mr. Speaker, I would submit that it 
is an election that has made these 
things more of a reality for these 
Democrats that were very weak on 
communist China. Democrats in the 
House failed to stand up for the Amer-
ican people and stand against the 
human rights abuses of the Uyghur 
people. And now 33 days before the 
election, they are scrambling to look 
tough on China. 
b 1215 
Let me be clear: This bill is not 
tough on China. It actually won’t do 
the things that the bill’s sponsor is 
saying and committee Democrats are 
saying. 
If we really want to be tough on 
China, we would target and sanction 
those responsible to the greatest ex-
tent possible. That is what we did in a 
bipartisan way last week with a good 
bill that is very workable. We would 
support 
a 
whole-of-government 
ap-
proach to combat the rising threat and 
ensure the freedom of the Uyghur peo-
ple. 
This bill doesn’t do that. This bill 
uses the same mechanisms that have 
previously failed in their intended pur-
pose. In fact, the last time the Demo-
crats paid lip service to similar human 
rights abuses in the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, they failed to support the 
Congolese miners, while at the same 
time costing American companies an 
estimated $7 billion. That is just one 
example. 
If you need more evidence that the 
Democrats are not serious about com-
bating the Chinese Communist Party, 
just look at their new COVID relief 
bill, which would send more than $170 
billion to the Chinese Government. 
What does that do for small businesses 
and their employees who are still hurt-
ing and need our support because of 
COVID? 
Now, there are many good news 
items here. Because Democrats are 
feeling vulnerable on China leading up 
to this election, we were able to get to-
gether on some pieces of legislation 
that would do some positive things in 
terms of our relationship with China 
and holding them accountable. The bill 
last week is a good example of that. 
The bill before us today is nothing 
more than a press release for an elec-
tion. I think we will see that. I think 
we will probably see Democrats using 
this in campaign ads, maybe. 
My amendment recognizes that sanc-
tioning is the most effective way to 
punish bad actors and to address the 
human rights violations in Xinjiang, in 
the Uyghur Autonomous Region, as 
recommended by the bipartisan, bi-
cameral Congressional-Executive Com-
mittee on China in their 2019 report, 
the very same report, I might add, that 
the author of this bill cites in her bill 
to describe the atrocities against the 
Uyghur people. 
It also ensures the bill accomplishes 
its intended purpose: cracking down on 
the Chinese Communist Party and end-
ing the human rights atrocities in the 
ongoing struggle that the Uyghur peo-
ple are facing. 
A vote for this amendment says that 
you are serious about addressing the 
threats of China and what it poses to 
our national security. A vote for this 
amendment says that we are serious 
about ending the human rights atroc-
ities and serious as legislators. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this motion to recommit, urge 
its adoption, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
time in opposition to this motion to re-
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Virginia is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman is trying to make this about 
me, and nothing could be further from 
the truth. This is about the Uyghur 
people. This is not about me. This is 
not about an election. 
Before I was even elected to Con-
gress, I met with Uyghur Muslims in 
my district. I have one of the largest 
populations of Uyghur diaspora in my 
district, and they told me their hor-
rible stories about relatives who dis-
appeared into the camps, who perished 
in those camps. So don’t try to make 
this about me. 
Before I came to Congress, I served in 
the Virginia State Senate, and there 
we had an expression for when people 
tried to change our bills on the floor or 
on the fly, and that was, ‘‘Get your 
own bill.’’ 
It is disappointing that my Repub-
lican colleagues are politicizing this 
issue and opposing this bill, especially 
when we have been hearing for so long 
how Democrats are weak on China. 
But, when given the chance to hold the 
Chinese Government responsible for 
gross human rights abuses and reveal 
the extent of the system of forced 
labor, it turns out Republicans aren’t 
all that interested. 
Crimes against humanity, and per-
haps even genocide, are being com-
mitted by the Chinese Government. Re-
publicans talk a good game, but only if 
it doesn’t create any kind of burden on 
U.S. corporations or their profit mar-
gins, profit that may be earned off of 
the backs of slave labor. 
During debate on this bill, the other 
side made it clear that they don’t be-
lieve that corporations, publicly traded 
companies, should be held responsible 
for knowing the origins of their prod-
ucts. The other side is saying that 
companies can turn a blind eye to 
genocide and not have to disclose to 
their shareholders about the use of 
slave labor in their supply chains. 
This MTR is more of the same. It 
neuters the bill and adds a sense of 
Congress. Well, Congress has a sense al-
ready: The exploitation and enslave-
ment of the Uyghurs must stop. Ameri-
cans don’t want to purchase goods 
made with slave labor. 
So maybe my colleagues are fol-
lowing the lead of the President, who 
seems to be okay with what is hap-
pening in Xinjiang. When given the op-
portunity to confront Xi over the mass 
internment of Uyghurs, Trump actu-
ally encouraged them to carry on 
building the camps. He said it was ‘‘the 
right thing to do.’’ That is according to 
his former National Security Advisor, 
John Bolton. 
With only the interpreters present, 
Xi had explained to Trump why he was 
basically building concentration camps 
in Xinjiang. According to our inter-
preter, Trump said that Xi should go 
ahead and build the camps, which 
Trump thought was exactly the right 
thing to do. 
Maybe 
you 
don’t 
believe 
John 
Bolton—I certainly question his integ-
rity—but Donald Trump admitted it. 
When he was asked, he said: ‘‘Well, we 
were in the middle of a major trade 
deal.’’

Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. 
MILLER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material about the 
measure before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Information Tech-
nology Modernization Centers of Excel-
lence Program Act is the product of 
great bipartisan work between Rep-
resentative RO KHANNA and the rank-
ing member of our committee, Mr. 
COMER. 
Since 2017, the Centers of Excellence 
have provided state-of-the-art tech-
nical expertise to assist Federal agen-
cies with their IT modernization so 
that they can serve the American peo-
ple more effectively. 
The program aims to leverage pri-
vate-sector innovation and centralized 
expertise to help the Federal Govern-
ment improve its services to the pub-
lic, deploy cutting-edge technology, at-
tract top talent to its workforce, en-
hance its cybersecurity, and optimize 
the data resources available to it. 
Today, six Centers of Excellence sup-
port agencies in the strategic com-
petency areas of artificial intelligence, 
cloud adoption, contact centers, cus-
tomer experience, data and analytics, 
and infrastructure optimization. 
This bill would codify that program 
and to support agencies in efficiently 
improving customer service, imple-
menting cloud computing systems and 
data management, optimizing IT infra-
structure, and sharing best practices 
and expertise. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Government Operations with responsi-
bility for Federal IT modernization, I 
have kept a close eye on this program 
since its inception, and I intend to 
keep a close eye as it continues to put 
its mission and goals into practice. 
I applaud the improvements made to 
the bill to ensure that assistance is

provided to agencies by request on a re-
imbursable and transparent basis. 
I support the commonsense bill be-
fore us to modernize and improve the 
functioning of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5901, the Information Technology Mod-
ernization Centers of Excellence Pro-
gram Act. This bill will help our gov-
ernment catch up with private-sector 
innovations by equipping agencies to 
take advantage of modern information 
technology solutions. 
Federal agencies remain challenged 
by inefficient, costly, and unwieldy 
legacy technology systems that do not 
adequately deliver citizen services and 
allow agencies to achieve their legally 
mandated missions. 
For example, the Government Ac-
countability Office has reported that, 
between 2010 and 2017, the Federal Gov-
ernment spent over $450 billion just 
maintaining outdated legacy IT sys-
tems. That is over 70 percent of the 
government’s entire IT budget. 
There is increasingly less and less 
Federal IT funding available for new 
agency modernization projects. The 
government needs to take advantage of 
the cutting-edge technology solutions 
already being used by the private sec-
tor. 
Recognizing the need for a different 
approach to transition large Federal 
agency technology projects, the Cen-
ters of Excellence were established by 
the Trump administration at the Gen-
eral Services Administration to help 
agencies 
overcome 
persistent 
mod-
ernization challenges. 
These challenges include identifying 
the best new technology solutions, pur-
chasing that technology, and then inte-
grating that technology into an agen-
cy’s unique operations and workflows. 
The GSA Centers of Excellence teams 
serve as change management consult-
ants that bring private-sector best 
practices to Federal agency technology 
challenges. 
By adopting commercially available 
solutions, in conjunction with delib-
erate enterprise-wide transformation 
planning, agencies can effectively tran-
sition into modern operating environ-
ments. By improving the operational 
efficiency of our Federal agency pro-
grams and mission, we can save tax-
payer dollars. 
While modernizing government is 
good for the taxpayer, the Centers of 
Excellence also deliver an additional 
benefit to Americans by bringing a cen-
tral focus to improving agency delivery 
on constituent services. 
H.R. 5901 promises to make the citi-
zens’ engagement with our government 
programs more intuitive and straight-
forward, like an engagement with a 
modern business. 
I am well aware of the challenges 
faced by veterans, senior citizens, and 
businesses when interacting with the 
Federal Government. I am sure that 
my colleagues are as well. 
The current pandemic has shown how 
critical it is for all Americans to be 
able to effectively and reliably interact 
with government agencies. It is time 
the 
Federal 
Government 
leveraged 
modern 
cloud 
computing 
systems, 
data-driven analytic capabilities, arti-
ficial intelligence, and modern cus-
tomer experience tools to offer the 
highest level of service possible. 
H.R. 5901 will give congressional 
backing and ensure regular oversight 
of the existing GSA program in order 
to accomplish these goals. 
By giving legal authority to the pro-
gram, we are also ensuring the pro-
gram’s stability through the next two 
Presidential administrations, which is 
critical to gaining agency buy-in and 
having the time to realize the benefits 
of this new modernization approach. 
The Congressional Budget Office’s re-
view of this bill found that it will have 
no budgetary impact, which shows that 
there are still legislative opportunities 
to modernize the government without 
spending additional taxpayer funds. 
I hope the House Oversight and Re-
form Committee and this Congress can 
continue to work together on similar 
legislative reforms to bring our govern-
ment into the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues for their bipartisan work on 
this bill. I encourage my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5901, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), the author of this 
bill. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman CONNOLLY for his leadership 
on this, on FITARA, and on so many 
efforts to bring technology to our gov-
ernment. I thank the gentlewoman 
from West Virginia and the bipartisan 
committee that has helped bring this 
legislation to the floor, including the 
majority and minority staffs. 
Mr. Speaker, we worked with the 
White House Office of Innovation and 
Matt Lira on this. The idea was very 
simple. We in the Federal Government 
should have cutting-edge technology in 
our Federal agencies. As a representa-
tive of Silicon Valley, it has always 
perplexed me why the world’s greatest 
institution, the strongest institution, 
the United States Government, can’t 
adopt the latest technology. 
What this bill does is says that we 
need to have digital expertise in the 
General Service Administration, about 
50 to 150 individuals who will help all of 
our Federal agencies adopt cloud com-
puting, adopt artificial intelligence, 
adopt the latest technology moderniza-
tion and infrastructure, adopt the best 
digital practices for customer service. 
We want our Federal Government to 
be user friendly. We want our Federal 
Government to use all the tools of 
technology to be competitive, to be the 
leader in the world. That is what this 
bill does. 
I want to applaud the bipartisan spir-
it in which this bill came to the floor. 
It was originally the White House Chief 
of Staff Mark Meadows who was the co-
sponsor of the legislation. I thank him, 
as well as the cosponsor, now the rank-
ing member, Representative RICE. On 
the Senate side, we have bipartisan 
commitment from the leadership of 
Senator PORTMAN and Senator MAGGIE 
HASSAN. So I am hopeful that this will 
actually become law and allow us to 
continue to compete. 
I just want to end by thanking Geo 
Saba, a staff member who was extraor-
dinarily helpful on this; as well as, 
again, the committee staff that has 
been excellent to work with; and, of 
course, Chairwoman CAROLYN
MALO-
NEY, who helped bring this to the floor. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan government reform bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good 
bill. I think as Mr. KHANNA indicated, 
it adds to the corpus of information 
technology legislation where we are 
trying to modernize the Federal Gov-
ernment; we are trying to retire legacy 
systems; we are trying to move to the 
cloud for cyber reasons, for efficiency 
reasons, and to be of better service to 
the American people. 
I think this is another piece in that 
mosaic, and I urge its passage by our 
colleagues here in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5901, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

There was no objection. 
b 1245 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Chai 
Suthammanont 
Remembrance 
Act 
would require each Federal agency to 
publish online a plan to reopen the 
Federal office building at least 30 days 
prior to the return of their workforce. 
The legislation also requires agency in-
spectors general to report on whether 
their agencies have, in fact, complied 
with the provisions in this bill and pro-
vided 
adequate 
personal 
protective 
equipment for their employees return-
ing to office spaces. 
This bill is named after my con-
stituent who tragically lost his life to 
coronavirus on May 26, 2020. Chai’s pic-
ture is behind me. Chai was a real 
human being. He wasn’t a statistic. He 
left behind a family. He is survived by 
four sons, his wife, and four grand-
children. He succumbed on May 26, 
2020. 
Chai 
immigrated 
to 
the 
United 
States from Thailand when he was 17. 
Throughout his life he was known for 
helping others. 
When he first came to our country, 
he landed in the restaurant industry at 
a famous jazz club in Greenwich Vil-
lage in New York City, where he made 
it among the first restaurants to offer 
health insurance to its employees. 
After retiring from that industry, 
Chai moved to the National Capitol Re-
gion and returned to work as a Federal 
employee in the Marine Corps Commu-
nity Services Child Development Cen-
ter in Quantico, Virginia. Chai wanted 
to continue giving back to his adopted 
country. He was a proud American cit-
izen. 
Chai was also a beloved employee 
working in the development center’s 
kitchen, preparing meals for the chil-
dren of our Marine families. He devel-
oped a unique handshake for each kid 
in the daycare, making each child feel 
special and included. 
At the beginning of this terrible pan-
demic, Chai’s workplace was not en-
forcing or taking proper precautions to 
protect its workers. On April 27, Chai 
worked his last full shift at the 
daycare kitchen as one of his cowork-
ers coughed repeatedly and looked very 
ill. There was no protective equipment 
for the other employees, including 
Chai. 
Sadly, soon after that, Chai was in-
formed that the coworker had, indeed, 
tested positive for coronavirus. Almost 
exactly 1 month later, after 13 days on 
a ventilator, Chai died on May 26. 
Let me be clear: This was an avoid-
able death. Had there been protocols in 
place, had there been PPE in place and 
available to employees like Chai, Chai 
would still be alive today, in my view. 
Chai’s widow, Christina, has worked 
with my office to make sure this never 
happens to anybody else again. 
I named the bill after Chai because, 
although the provisions in this bill can 
no longer help him, they can help the 
millions of Federal and contract work-
ers who will reenter the Federal work 
spaces across the United States. 
This legislation is designed to save 
lives and protect those who serve the 
American people. 
We, as Members of Congress, have an 
absolute obligation to protect the Fed-
eral workforce that keeps our country 
running, keeps our country safe. We 
must ensure that Federal employees 
have the most accurate and up-to-date 
information regarding agencies’ re-
opening plans. 
Currently, Federal agencies are fail-
ing to communicate with employees 
across the board and other stake-
holders about their coronavirus prac-
tices and policies. As some agencies 
begin calling employees back to Fed-
eral office buildings, many civil serv-
ants are receiving incomplete or un-
clear instructions, leading to fear and 
uncertainty about health. 
I represent the third largest number 
of Federal employees of any congres-
sional district in America, but there 
are Federal employees in every Federal 
congressional district. This bill mat-
ters and ought to matter to every one 
of us and our constituents. 
I refuse to sit idly by and risk more 
and more of our Federal workforce 
being forced back to office buildings 
under superficial plans with zero ac-
countability. This bill simply includes 
the commonsense provisions taken di-
rectly from the best practices rec-
ommendations of the Government Ac-
countability Office to communicate ef-
fectively with the workforce and to en-
sure they have adequate PPE. The 
Trump 
Office 
of 
Management 
and 
Budget had no concerns with this bill. 
The least we can do for our Federal 
employees is to ensure the Federal 
agencies they work for are being trans-
parent with their plans so that there is 
a level of reassurance and security be-
fore they are called back physically to 
the workplace. 
I wholeheartedly support this bill 
dedicated to my constituent Chai, and 
I encourage every one of my colleagues 
to join me in doing the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Chai 
Suthammanont Remembrance Act is 
well-intentioned legislation. 
First, let me send my deepest condo-
lences to Chai’s family. He sounds like 
such a beloved person. I am sure Chai 
is greatly missed. 
Each and every COVID–19-related 
tragedy is a stark reminder of the pre-
ciousness of life. America has faced as-
tonishing challenges over the last 6 
months with this global struggle. 
As the Nation’s largest employer, the 
Federal Government has offices and 
employees across the Nation in every 
State and territory. There are unprece-
dented challenges facing our Federal 
workforce and the management of our 
government’s many facilities. Every 
single State and territory is working 
overtime to operate under a disruptive 
emergency declaration. 
The work of our Federal agencies’ di-
verse workforce is more critical than 
ever, and they are working around the

clock. It is critical that the Federal 
agencies have stepped up to the plate 
to answer the calls for help. 
President Trump and his team at the 
Office of Management and Budget and 
the Office of Personnel Management 
should be commended for issuing time-
ly directives that gave agencies the 
necessary guidance and flexibility to 
accomplish their missions. 
The requirements of this bill may du-
plicate planned administration and 
agency actions. Therefore, the bill 
could have benefited from further com-
mittee work to avoid potential duplica-
tion. However, H.R. 7340 is well inten-
tioned, and I support governmentwide 
transparency. 
I have heard my colleague, Mr. CON-
NOLLY, speak passionately about Mr. 
Chai, about his character and his pas-
sion for working with children, and my 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues that knew 
him so well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Mrs. MILLER, for her 
kind remarks, and I certainly know 
they will be appreciated by his widow, 
Christina. 
Mr. Speaker, we have no further 
speakers on this side, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further comments on this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my friends in the House, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to join with me in honoring 
Chai and preventing further deaths and 
further infections from COVID–19 with-
in the Federal workforce and the Fed-
eral contract workforce. This is a pru-
dent measure, and, as I said, President 
Trump’s OMB does not oppose this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
BRAD SCHNEIDER and JOHN KATKO for 
their strong bipartisan work on this 
good-government bill. 
Reflecting back on the outbreak of 
the pandemic, I think we can all agree 
that our Nation and the Federal Gov-
ernment were not prepared for what 
lay ahead. Conflicting safety and work- 
from-home guidelines caused confusion 
across 
the 
Federal 
workforce. 
We 
didn’t have a clear understanding of 
how the virus spread or how best to re-
spond to it, so agencies managing of-
fices and priorities across the country 
were left to make their own best deci-
sions as they saw it. Many agencies 
were not telework-ready, and we did 
not grasp the sheer length of time that 
this pandemic would last, let alone 
plan for it. 
Now with the winter months ap-
proaching, the projections are grim. In 
June, the University of Washington 
School of Medicine predicted 200,000 
U.S. deaths by October, a number we 
had already passed by September 22. 
Their model now predicts, sadly, the 
death rate will more than double by 
the end of this year. In all likelihood, 
the worst is still to come. But this 
time we can and must be prepared. 
To make sure the Federal Govern-
ment is ready for the challenges ahead, 
the COVID PREPARE Act would re-
quire each Federal agency submit to 
Congress an initial action plan for ad-
dressing and managing any resurgence 
of coronavirus cases. The plans would 
use the important lessons learned since 
the onset of the coronavirus crisis to 
develop data-driven blueprints for an-
ticipating and addressing any resur-
gence. The bill also would require 
agencies to provide quarterly progress 
reports to Congress. 
Agencies should already be engaging 
in the strategic evidence-based plan-
ning required by this bill, so compli-
ance ought not to be difficult. Adding 
this important step would maximize 
the impact of these plans by ensuring 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
through oversight. 
It is more urgent than ever that Fed-
eral agencies ensure the responsible 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars while 
protecting their workforces and the 
most effective pandemic response pos-
sible by committing to a sound and 
transparent planning and preparedness 
process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
thoughtful bill as a complement to the 
bill we just passed, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 
7496, the COVID PREPARE Act of 2020.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5076 
September 30, 2020 
The bill requires every Federal agen-
cy to report COVID–19 resurgent action 
plans to Congress. These plans will 
cover 
agency 
pandemic 
resurgence 
preparations to assure agency mission 
continuity. 
The bill also requires agencies to out-
line their communication plans to nec-
essary stakeholders, including Con-
gress, States, and localities, and enti-
ties in the agency’s jurisdiction. Fi-
nally, the bill requires quarterly up-
dates on these plans through the end of 
the pandemic. This, of course, pre-
sumes a resurgence of the pandemic, 
which we hope will not happen. 
In discussing this bill, we would be 
remiss if we did not commend the work 
the Federal agencies and their work-
force have already done and continue 
to do combating COVID–19 across our 
Nation. 
We should recognize the progress we 
have made as a nation in fighting this 
global pandemic. Thanks to this ad-
ministration’s leadership, we are see-
ing 
continual 
progress 
in 
the 
coronavirus fight. 
The President’s Cabinet and agency 
leaders have been constantly evalu-
ating the pandemic and making deci-
sions in real time, with the safety of 
the Federal workforce and the Amer-
ican public as their primary goal. 
As 
our 
collective 
knowledge 
of 
COVID–19 evolves, Congress needs to 
ensure that the legislation we advance 
empowers Federal agencies to make 
these critical real-time decisions. Con-
gress needs to be careful about contin-
ually laying on new reporting require-
ments 
to 
already-strained 
Federal 
agencies. 
b 1300 
These agencies are currently respon-
sible to congressional oversight, and 
new, broadly defined reporting require-
ments can have the unintended con-
sequences of redirecting scarce agency 
resources during a national emergency. 
H.R. 7496 requires, within 30 days of 
the legislation’s enactment, that every 
Federal agency communicates plans to 
Congress for how they will handle the 
unthinkable; this pandemic worsening. 
The bill’s language is broad, and we 
didn’t have the opportunity to fully en-
gage in debate on what it means and 
what metrics we are using. 
Legislation like this could have bene-
fited from additional work in our com-
mittee to clarify its intentions. 
Fortunately, the agencies already 
have plans in place, and we hope the re-
surgence action plans envisioned by 
this bill won’t be needed. 
Thanks to the administration’s Oper-
ation Warp Speed, the American people 
are optimistic that the Food and Drug 
Administration will shortly announce 
a safe and effective vaccine. 
In the meantime, we need to work in 
Congress to assure that Federal agen-
cies are able to remain fully focused on 
handling their present work and chal-
lenges so that we can stop this virus. 
Our constituents sent us here to 
work together, put partisanship aside, 
and ensure our Nation’s government 
has the resources that it needs. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on legislation that helps our 
government remain effective at fight-
ing this pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I do think it is impor-
tant when we talk about Operation 
Warp Speed and we talk about the 
promise of vaccines, that we remind 
ourselves that not all vaccines are cu-
rative. In fact, many vaccines exist to 
lessen the severity of the illness that 
could follow. 
We are 100 years after the Spanish 
flu, and we still don’t have a cure for 
the flu. We have an annual vaccine to 
lessen the severity of the illness should 
you get it and to prevent it in some 
cases, but not a cure. 
We have been grappling with AIDS 
for over 40 years. We don’t have a drug 
or a vaccine that completely cures 
AIDS. 
So when we talk to the American 
public, we have to be careful about the 
implied promise or explicit promise 
those of us in public life make. 
That is why I think Mr. SCHNEIDER’s 
bill and Mr. KATKO’s bill is so impor-
tant. In the event we don’t have a vac-
cine that is efficacious, we need to 
have contingency planning. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI-
DER), the author of this bill and my 
friend. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CONNOLLY), my friend, for yielding 
me the time. 
I rise today in support of the COVID 
PREPARE Act, H.R. 7496. 
As I stand here, our Nation stands at 
more than 7 million Americans con-
firmed infected with the SARS-Cov-2 
virus and more than 206,000 American 
lives lost to COVID–19. 
The scale and scope of this pandemic 
is unprecedented in American history, 
causing dual national crises: one of 
public health, the other of economic 
calamity. 
Over the past 6 months, the pandemic 
has affected all of us, putting our loved 
ones 
at 
risk, 
overwhelming 
our 
healthcare systems, keeping our kids 
out of school, devastating our busi-
nesses, and pushing State and local 
governments to the brink. 
Most experts agree that things are 
likely to get worse before they get bet-
ter. According to Reuters, for the week 
ending September 27, total new cases 
are up 10 percent from the prior week. 
Daily new cases are again rising, with 
The New York Times reporting a 23 
percent increase in average daily cases 
over 2 weeks ago. And The Times shows 
that more than half of U.S. States al-
ready have high rates of infection—at 
least 15 cases per 100,000 population—or 
are concerningly facing rising rates of 
infection. 
So many people are suffering and 
looking to their government for relief. 
They needed help as they navigated the 
daunting challenges of spring and sum-
mer, and they want confidence that the 
Federal Government, our entire gov-
ernment, has a plan as we head into 
the fall and winter. 
Every day I hear from constituents 
in my community, Illinois’ 10th Con-
gressional District, about how they are 
struggling to cope. I hear from parents 
juggling full-time jobs while schooling 
their children; from small business 
owners scraping to pay their bills and 
worried they may have to shut their 
doors forever; from healthcare workers 
forced to use and reuse their PPE, the 
personal protective equipment that 
keeps them safe—for up to an entire 
week because of ongoing shortages of 
supplies; from city mayors and village 
presidents forced into cutting essential 
services and laying off critical work-
ers; from individuals of all ages and in 
all stages of life concerned about their 
future and the future of our country. 
With the timeline for rolling out a 
safe and effective vaccine still un-
known, it is imperative that the gov-
ernment develop and implement com-
prehensive strategies for beating back 
this virus and mitigating its effect on 
our healthcare system, on our econ-
omy, and our lives and our livelihoods. 
This is not about politics. Congress 
and the administration must work to-
gether to provide immediate relief to 
those suffering now and get us on a 
path to full recovery as soon as pos-
sible. 
We can’t get there by ignoring our 
challenges or by wishing them away. 
We can only get to the other side of 
these crises with clear-eyed assessment 
and realistic, fact-based, science-driven 
solutions. 
These are the ideas that lie behind 
the COVID PREPARE Act. This is bi-
partisan, 
commonsense 
legislation, 
crafted with my friend JOHN KATKO, to 
assure the American people that their 
Federal Government is fully prepared 
to address this ever-changing public 
health crisis and economic crisis. 
This legislation would require Fed-
eral agencies to submit to Congress 
their plans for addressing surges of 
COVID–19, anticipating a potential in-
crease in infections and even greater 
demands on our healthcare system and 
pressure on our economy. 
Trying to anticipate the unforeseen 
is always a difficult task, but any num-
ber of our ills—from shortages of PPE, 
to nationwide testing strategies, to 
school reopening protocols—could be at 
least partially cured by thoughtful 
planning and careful preparation. 
The COVID PREPARE Act will pro-
vide 
bipartisan 
oversight 
and 
full 
transparency in both the planning and 
execution of our national response. 
The goal of this legislation is not to 
tell our Federal agencies what to do. 
Rather, this bill provides the American 
people transparency and confidence 
that their government is putting their

needs and the needs of our Nation front 
and center; that the government is an-
ticipating 
what 
resources 
and 
re-
sponses will be required in the imme-
diate, middle, and long-term battle 
against COVID; and that we are taking 
the necessary steps at the Federal level 
to maximize our likelihood of national 
success. 
In a time of such great uncertainty, 
any reassurances we can provide our 
country should and will be a welcome 
salve. 
I will say it again: ending the pan-
demic should not, should not be a par-
tisan issue. We need to move forward 
together, Democrats and Republicans. 
My bill seeks to do just that, and to 
take an aggressive approach to tack-
ling this urgent public health crisis. 
We can certainly hope for the best, 
but we must responsibly prepare for 
the worst. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further com-
ments on this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just simply close by reminding 
everybody that bad planning exacer-
bated greatly the severity and duration 
of this pandemic. And if we have 
learned anything, we have learned that 
we need to plan, we need to have a 
plan, and that is certainly true with 
our Federal agencies. 
I believe this bill is a commonsense 
bill that will add to our capability to 
respond quickly in the event of a resur-
gence of the coronavirus, and I urge its 
passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HECK). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CONNOLLY) that the House suspend

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the government’s latest 
reports describe violence by white su-
premacists as a significant terrorist 
threat to the homeland. 
In fact, it was recently reported that 
DHS analysts assessed ‘‘the threat 
from white supremacists as the dead-
liest domestic terror threat facing the 
U.S.’’ 
Further, this past week, a DHS offi-
cial testified before a Senate com-
mittee that attacks by white suprema-
cists are on average the most lethal of 
domestic terrorist actors. 
This statement came on the heels of 
testimony before the Senate Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee by FBI Director Chris-
topher Wray, who stated that racially- 
motivated violent extremists are ‘‘the 
most lethal of all domestic extrem-
ists,’’ and that white supremacists are 
the number one threat within that 
group. 
We have also seen evidence that this 
threat is increasingly linked to indi-
viduals and groups abroad. 
Last year, the perpetrators of terror 
attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Poway, 
California, drew inspiration from the 
deadly white supremacist attack in 
Christchurch, New Zealand. 
There are indications that the links 
go beyond mere inspiration. 
Reports have documented that white 
supremacists 
have 
traveled 
inter-
nationally to train with neo-Nazi mili-
tant groups in war zone environments. 
By some accounts, white supremacist 
groups are drawing on jihadist tactics 
to organize, and the threat they pose is 
no less deadly. 
The Transnational White Suprema-
cist Extremism Review Act would re-
quire the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to disseminate a terrorist threat 
assessment regarding foreign, violent 
white supremacist extremist groups to 
State and local law enforcement part-
ners. 
The bill also authorizes DHS to share 
information regarding symbols used by 
such groups with social media compa-
nies to assist in efforts to identify con-
tent that may violate their terms of 
service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5078 
September 30, 2020 
The bill includes vital civil rights 
and civil liberties safeguards to protect 
First Amendment rights. 
The first step in confronting a threat 
is making sure that the people on the 
front lines have the information they 
need to understand it. 
When it comes to the white suprema-
cist threat, that is exactly what this 
bill would do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
5736, the Transnational White Su-
premacist Extremism Review Act. 
H.R. 5736 requires the Department of 
Homeland Security Undersecretary for 
Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, to co-
ordinate with Federal partners and de-
velop a terrorism threat assessment 
concerning homeland threats related to 
‘‘foreign violent white supremacist ex-
tremist organizations.’’ 
This bill further requires I&A to 
share the information with State and 
local law enforcement partners, as well 
as fusion centers. Ensuring that State 
and local law enforcement and fusion 
centers have access to information on 
current and emerging threats is a fun-
damental responsibility of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, particu-
larly the Office of Intelligence and 
Analysis. 
The Trump administration has taken 
significant action to address domestic 
extremism, including white supremacy. 
The creation of the Office of Targeted 
Violence and Terrorism Prevention in 
April 2019 and the release of the DHS 
Strategic Framework for Countering 
Terrorism and Targeted Violence in 
September 2019 demonstrate a coordi-
nated and comprehensive commitment 
to addressing emerging threats in both 
international and domestic terrorism. 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member 
WALKER led our efforts to negotiate 
changes to the base bill during the 
committee markup. I want to thank 
Subcommittee Chairman ROSE for ac-
cepting our changes to the bill. I urge 
its passage, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ROSE), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois 
for yielding her time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
bill, H.R. 5736, the Transnational White 
Supremacist Review Act. 
Today, our country faces a wide 
range of complex threats to our safety, 
our security, and our way of life. Not 
only are American families having to 
keep their communities safe and their 
economy 
together 
in 
the 
face 
of 
COVID, but in large swaths of the 
country, they are doing so while deal-
ing with more frequent and cata-
strophic natural disasters. 
Sadly, though, amidst all of this, ter-
rorism does not stop. The homeland se-
curity threat posed by white suprema-
cist extremists is pervasive and per-
sistent. Extremists exploit such crises 
as we are in right now. Often, this in-
volves the targeting of the most vul-
nerable in society. 
Earlier this year, the Directors of the 
FBI and the National Counterterrorism 
Center testified before our committee 
regarding the unrelenting nature of 
bad actors during times like these. 
Both testified to the significant home-
land security threat posed by racially 
motivated domestic actors, primarily 
white supremacist extremists. 
In my capacity as chair of the Intel-
ligence 
and 
Counterterrorism 
Sub-
committee, I have joined with my col-
leagues to raise the alarm about this 
threat. In carrying out my work on the 
committee, I have identified a common 
theme. And that is, plain and simple, 
that this white supremacist domestic 
terrorist problem is, in fact, not do-
mestic at all. It is global in nature. 
Look no further than the deadly at-
tacks in El Paso, Texas, and Poway, 
California, last year. The U.S. experi-
enced firsthand the ramifications of an 
international white supremacist move-
ment when two domestic actors inde-
pendently drew inspiration from the 
foreign terrorists who committed the 
Christchurch, New Zealand, attack. 
Troublingly, there are reports that 
white supremacist groups have adapted 
recruitment tactics and begun using 
training camps modeled after jihadist 
groups like al-Qaida and ISIS. 
Just last week, a former Trump ad-
ministration counterterrorism official 
confirmed that training by foreign 
groups is happening when she acknowl-
edged that there have been instances 
when 
our 
foreign 
counterterrorism 
partners have alerted us to the fact 
that U.S. citizens were in their coun-
tries to conduct trainings or partici-
pate in trainings with white suprema-
cist movements. 
These foreign partners told this 
former official that the U.S. is an ex-
porter of this ideology and must ad-
dress this problem. 
This is exactly what this bill today 
seeks to address, a bill designed to send 
a message to our foreign partners that 
Congress hears them and is taking ac-
tion. 
This bill would require DHS to 
produce and circulate a threat assess-
ment on foreign violent white suprema-
cist extremist groups to local law en-
forcement. It would also push social 
media companies to do so much more 
in addressing this threat. Crucially, 
this bill includes civil rights and civil 
liberty safeguards as well. 
Countering white supremacy will re-
quire a whole-of-society approach, edu-
cation, awareness, and so on. 
Through our work on this com-
mittee, we found that Americans stay 
safest when law enforcement at all lev-
els is equipped with the best available 
information. This bill makes sure that 
our frontline responders in the law en-
forcement community have just that. 
It is endorsed by the ADL, an expert 
advocacy group that has tracked the 
white supremacist threat for decades. 
It is also endorsed by the Blue Dog Co-
alition, a group that looks past par-
tisanship and advocates for common-
sense national security solutions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on its passage. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
As the surge in white supremacist ex-
tremist attacks in the United States 
and around world puts all of us at risk, 
I commend my committee colleague 
Mr. ROSE for introducing this legisla-
tion, and I urge passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

fairs of the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5780, the Safe Commu-
nities Act. 
Last month, a teenager from my dis-
trict in Antioch, Illinois, went to Keno-
sha, Wisconsin, where he allegedly 
killed two people with an AR–15-style 
rifle. 
The next day, I heard from another 
constituent, a mother who lives in the 
alleged shooter’s hometown. She wrote: 
‘‘There is a militia cell in Antioch that 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
emboldened to take the law into their 
own hands. I am becoming fearful to 
send my children to the same schools 
at white supremacist militia mem-
bers.’’ 
I share my constituents’ concerns 
with the rise of domestic violent extre-
mism in this country. FBI Director 
Wray recently testified before the 
House Homeland Security Committee 
that white supremacist extremists are 
a leading threat to our Nation. 
I believe we must do more to address 
the root causes of violent behavior, and 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues in Congress to 
make America a place where racism, 
misogyny, and other forms of hate can 
no longer flourish. 
Meanwhile, in the face of extremist 
threats like these, we must take imme-
diate action to secure our critical in-
frastructure and make soft targets less 
vulnerable to attack. 
In addition to domestic extremists, 
our suburban and rural communities 
face too many other threats of mass vi-
olence. Just last year, five of our 
neighbors, four of whom were my con-
stituents, were killed by an act of gun 
violence at the Henry Pratt Company 
in Aurora, Illinois. Our workplaces, 
schools, and places of worship are far 
too vulnerable to mass shootings and 
other forms of targeted violence. This 
bill seeks to fix that. 
Rural and suburban communities 
like mine in northern Illinois are in-
creasingly targets of violence but often 
don’t have access to the Federal re-
sources they need to protect them-
selves. That is why I introduced H.R. 
5780, the Safe Communities Act of 2020, 
bipartisan legislation to help better 
protect soft targets in communities 
like mine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5080 
September 30, 2020 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency’s protective security 
advisers 
help 
improve 
security 
at 
schools, places of worship, and other 
soft targets, but there are too few of 
them to meet the demand of their serv-
ices. 
H.R. 5780 would require CISA to 
maintain an online security resources 
clearinghouse to provide security guid-
ance and best practices, serving as a 
one-stop shop for school districts, reli-
gious organizations, and local officials 
to find the information they need to 
keep their communities safe. 
The bill would also require CISA to 
develop a stakeholder outreach and 
operational engagement strategy and 
implementation plan to ensure that 
the Agency is delivering infrastructure 
security services across sectors and 
throughout regions. 
Finally, H.R. 5780 would authorize a 
PSA force multiplier pilot program, 
which would require CISA PSAs to 
train State, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial officials to perform security vul-
nerability and terrorism risk assess-
ments. These risk assessments are an 
important 
part 
of 
qualifying 
for 
FEMA’s security grants; the force mul-
tiplier program will help expand access 
to them. 
I am proud that the Safe Commu-
nities Act of 2020 has been endorsed by 
the Jewish Federations of North Amer-
ica and the Anti-Defamation League. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Mr. KATKO, for joining me in intro-
ducing this measure. I am grateful for 
his collaboration and leadership as 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Pro-
tection, and Innovation. 
I want to extend my sincere apprecia-
tion to the Homeland Security Com-
mittee staff for their work on this leg-
islation. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this legislation 
today to make sure every community 
in America has the resources it needs 
to keep people safe. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
5780, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5780. This bill 
makes the great work done by the Cy-
bersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency more accessible to stake-
holders. 
CISA 
provides 
advice 
and 
rec-
ommendations upon the request of crit-
ical infrastructure owners and opera-
tors on how to secure and protect their 
facilities in cyberspace and physically. 
This bill will help stakeholders clear-
ly know what CISA can do. Continuing 
to develop the relationship between 
CISA and our private stakeholders re-
mains an integral piece of our critical 
infrastructure security. 
I thank Representatives UNDERWOOD 
and KATKO for their bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Last week, I was appointed as the 
new chair of the Subcommittee on Cy-
bersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, 
and Innovation of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. It is a great honor and 
opportunity for me to amplify the 
homeland security concerns of the peo-
ple of Illinois’ 14th Congressional Dis-
trict here in Washington. 
b 1330 
My constituents are concerned about 
the vulnerability of so-called soft tar-
gets to violence. CISA, which is over-
seen by my subcommittee, has a crit-
ical role to play to empower commu-
nities to be more secure and resilient 
against ever-increasing lists of home-
land security threats. 
I am committed to ensuring the suc-
cess of the PSA program, and I look 
forward to working with CISA to make 
sure that every community can benefit 
from it. Enactment of the Safe Com-
munities Act of 2020 will help CISA 
think more strategically about how it 
deploys PSAs and other services and do 
so in a way that will scale. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5780, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
STATE AND LOCAL CYBERSECU-
RITY IMPROVEMENT ACT 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5823) to establish a program 
to make grants to States to address cy-
bersecurity risks and cybersecurity 
threats to information systems of 
State, local, Tribal, or territorial gov-
ernments, and for other purposes, as 
amended.

duct a study to assess the feasibility of im-
plementing a short-term rotational program 
for the detail of approved State, local, Trib-
al, and territorial government employees in 
cyber workforce positions to the Agency. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t need to tell any-
one here that cyberattacks against 
State and local governments are grow-
ing more frequent and more sophisti-
cated. In 2019, there were over 100 
ransomware attacks on State and local 
governments. 
From major cities like New Orleans 
and Baltimore to small towns across 
Texas, cyberattacks sought to cripple 
the ability of governments across the 
country to carry out basic functions, 
from processing real estate trans-
actions to collecting payments for 
services. 
The cost is more than just a mere in-
convenience. 
A 
ransomware 
attack 
against a State and local government 
can disrupt lifeline services, like 911 
call centers and public hospitals, and 
extort money those governments do 
not have. 
Last summer, the mayor of Atlanta, 
Keisha Lance Bottoms, testified before 
my subcommittee that the ransomware 
attack that hit her city in 2018 cost 
city taxpayers $7.2 million to recover 
from, but experts expect that cost to 
grow to as much as $17 million. 
The COVID–19 pandemic, by dramati-
cally expanding the threat landscape 
and 
making 
government 
networks 
more attractive targets for hackers, 
has made the situation more dire. More 
Americans than ever before are work-
ing from home. That includes State 
and local government workers who 
may be less accustomed to teleworking 
and less prepared to do it securely. 
At the same time, the cyber risk to 
State and local networks has increased 
dramatically due to unprecedented de-
mand for online services, including un-
employment compensation and human 
services applications. 
The transition to online learning 
that COVID–19 has forced many schools 
to undertake has also not been without 
incident. 
According 
to 
Education 
Week, there have been 220 cyberattacks 
against schools so far this year. And 
while the pandemic is bringing the vul-
nerability of our school districts’ net-
works into focus, it is worth noting 
that 
there 
have 
been 
over 
1,000 
cyberattacks against school districts 
since 2016, according to the K–12 Re-
search Center. 
Despite the urgent need to address 
their cyber vulnerabilities, many State 
and local governments are not in a po-
sition to do so without outside assist-
ance, as they are overwhelmed by the 
challenges of maintaining basic serv-
ices in the face of steep COVID–19-re-
lated revenue losses. 
It is time for the Federal Govern-
ment to step up and help. Passing H.R. 
5823, the State and Local Cybersecurity 
Improvement Act, which I am proud to 
cosponsor, is an important first step. 
The bill would establish a $400 mil-
lion targeted grant program to help 
States and local governments develop 
robust cybersecurity capabilities. Im-
portantly, it requires States to pay a 
graduated match to incentivize them 
to budget better for cybersecurity. 
And it requires the Department of 
Homeland Security to create a plan to 
improve the cybersecurity posture of 
State and local governments to ensure 
that Federal resources align with State 
goals and objectives. The smart invest-
ments we make in the cybersecurity of 
our State and local governments now 
will pay for themselves in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5823, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5823. 
Preparing our State, local, Tribal, 
and territorial governments for the in-
creasing number of cyber threats they 
face is a necessary priority. 
Cybersecurity preparedness is inef-
fective if our only focus is on Federal 
preparedness. It is incumbent on us to 
ensure that our State and local part-
ners are taking advantage of the re-
sources that we can offer so they, too, 
can prepare for the threats that they 
might face. H.R. 5823 will do just that. 
It establishes a matching grant pro-
gram for State and local governments 
to access and close vulnerabilities in 
their IT systems. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
Richmond and Katko for their bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER). 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
Before I start, I want to acknowledge 
the gentlewoman’s leadership position. 
I was sitting in my chair—I have been 
dealing with cyber issues for a long 
time—and when I heard Mr. JOYCE 
agree with the gentlewoman, I almost 
fell out of my chair, but I didn’t. I real-
ly applaud both Members for working 
together. 
Cyber issues are some of the most 
important national security issues that 
our country faces, internationally and 
also within our country, and coming 
together like this is how we get things 
done for our constituents. I hope people 
on both sides of the aisle observe what 
these Representatives are doing. That 
is the way we need to go. 
First, as a former Baltimore County 
executive, I am well aware of the prob-
lems that State and local governments 
face on a daily basis. They are where

the rubber meets the road and the 
source of many of the critical services 
our constituents rely on, which in-
cludes schools, law enforcement, parks, 
fire, and libraries. 
Yet, according to the National Asso-
ciation of State Chief Information Offi-
cers, nearly half of all States do not 
have a dedicated cybersecurity line 
item in their budget. In fact, most 
State cybersecurity budgets are be-
tween 0 and 3 percent of their overall 
information technology budget. 
While some support from the Federal 
Government does exist already, less 
than 4 percent of current Homeland Se-
curity Grant Program funding has been 
allocated to cybersecurity needs at the 
State and local level. As we have seen 
from recent cyberattacks on many 
American cities and States, this is sim-
ply not enough. 
Last year, there were at least 24 pub-
lic-sector ransomware attacks, includ-
ing a ransomware attack in Baltimore, 
my hometown, that is expected to cost 
more than $18 million in remediation. 
A separate attack in 2018 temporarily 
disabled Baltimore’s 911 dispatch sys-
tem. 
This is part of a growing nationwide 
trend. The COVID–19 pandemic has 
only exacerbated the threat to local 
governments as hackers exploit over-
whelmed organizations that are in-
creasingly dependent on digital tools. 
We cannot simply stand by and watch 
this happen. We can and must do more. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Maryland an 
additional 2 minutes. 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, the bill before us today establishes 
a program making grants available to 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial 
governments to address cybersecurity 
risks and threats to their information 
systems. 
This is not a silver bullet, but it al-
lows us to leverage Federal expertise in 
cyber, like that of the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or 
CISA, to help State and local govern-
ments get their information security 
programs off the ground. 
This bill will further empower State 
and local governments around the 
country to begin assuming the funding 
burden in their normal budget cycles in 
the future by reducing the Federal 
share over time. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON, Chair-
man RICHMOND, and all those involved 
for this bipartisan coalition. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding and echo 
the gratitude for her leadership and the 
bipartisan 
leadership 
of 
the 
sub-
committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the State and Local Cybersecurity 
Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill 
that I was proud to help introduce, to 
deliver urgently needed investments to 
address the vulnerabilities that persist 
in State, local, Tribal, and territorial 
cyber infrastructures. 
These cyber threats are real, and our 
communities need help. 
I have spoken with a county auditor 
just recently who said she is conscious 
that her systems are constantly tar-
geted. 
I have spoken with public power pro-
viders who understand that, in the ab-
sence of sufficient cybersecurity, we 
could see an attack that would wipe 
out our critical utilities for citizens 
and could undermine our economy. 
I have recently spoken with a Tribal 
leader who said that they have enough 
technology challenges without seeing 
the threat of cyberattack compound 
things. 
I have spoken with a county hospital 
in my district that was hit by a 
ransomware attack. 
This bill is about letting those folks 
know and the people whom they serve 
know that they are not on their own, 
that the Federal Government under-
stands that cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties don’t only exist in marble build-
ings in Washington, D.C., but that they 
exist in communities in every State in 
our Nation, and with this bill the Fed-
eral Government says: We are going to 
have your back. That is why I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this bipartisan plan. There is 
no time to waste. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania closes. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, over 
the past decade and a half, Congress 
has redoubled efforts to secure Federal 
networks. This legislation will con-
tinue that work by supporting State 
and local cybersecurity improvements. 
It was approved on a bipartisan basis in 
committee and has broad and deep sup-
port within stakeholder communities. 
I would like to congratulate Con-
gressman CEDRIC RICHMOND, the former 
chairman of the Cybersecurity, Infra-
structure Protection, and Innovation 
Subcommittee, on this important leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5823, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). Pursuant to the rule, the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD) and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE) each will control 
20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5822, the Homeland Security Acquisi-
tion Professional Career Program Act. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5822 authorizes an 
existing program within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security focused on 
strengthening its acquisition work-
force. DHS established the Acquisition 
Professional Career Program in 2008 to 
create a pipeline for hard-to-fill acqui-
sition workforce positions, such as con-
tract specialists. 
Since its inception, the program has 
had over 300 program graduates join 
the ranks of DHS’ acquisition work-
force, which oversees billions of dollars 
of transactions to procure what DHS 
needs to carry out its diverse missions. 
They are charged with purchasing ev-
erything from cybersecurity software 
for protecting Federal networks, to dis-
aster response supplies, to sophisti-
cated security screening equipment. 
And when it comes to COVID–19, they 
have been responsible for spending over 
$1.7 billion on a wide range of response 
activities. 
Unfortunately, the Government Ac-
countability 
Office 
has 
highlighted 
workforce shortages as a persistent 
challenge for DHS acquisition pro-
grams—one that can negatively affect 
their ability to deliver vital capabili-
ties on time and on budget. 
H.R. 5822 will help address this chal-
lenge by authorizing DHS’ rigorous de-
velopment program, which provides 
participants with acquisition training, 
mentorship, 
department-wide 
rota-
tions, and other career development 
opportunities. 
H.R. 5822, if enacted, will help DHS 
maintain a pipeline for its acquisition 
workforce that directly supports the 
Department’s frontline officers with 
the tools that they need to perform 
their jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentle-
woman from Nevada, Representative 
TITUS, for introducing this measure, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5822. The Department of Homeland Se-
curity has an important mission to 
protect the homeland and secure our 
borders. To accomplish this mission, 
DHS must enter into contracts for 
equipment and services. To protect 
taxpayer dollars and ensure that DHS 
is getting the most bang for its buck, 
the Department must utilize experi-
enced acquisition professionals. 
In the past decade, GAO has consist-
ently identified issues that must be ad-
dressed to improve acquisition oper-
ations at DHS, including shortages in 
the number of trained acquisition pro-
fessionals. This bill addresses this spe-
cific issue by developing trained acqui-
sition professionals within DHS. 
H.R. 5822 provides the on-the-job ac-
quisition training, rotations through-
out the Department, mentoring, and 
other opportunities to enhance acquisi-
tion knowledge, and experience for the 
participants. I applaud my colleague, 
Representative TITUS, for her efforts to 
bring this bill forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 5822 
would help ensure that DHS maintains 
a pipeline for hard-to-fill acquisition 
positions throughout the Department. 
Given the critical nature of DHS’ mis-
sion, it is essential that it have a ro-
bust acquisition workforce in place. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5822, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5822, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

TSA PERSONNEL WORKPLACE

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5811) to require the Transpor-
tation Security Administration to pro-
vide nursing facilities and paid paren-
tal leave for Administration personnel, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel Work-
force Improvement Act of 2020. The 
country recently observed the 19th an-
niversary of the September 11 terrorist 
attacks, a day that shook the Nation 
to its core and changed it forever. The 
federalization of the aviation screening 
workforce was one of the most impor-
tant steps taken as a Nation to restore 
America’s confidence in flying again. 
Today, with the emergence of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we find ourselves 
at another moment when many Ameri-
cans are not comfortable flying. Still, 
we have a dedicated workforce in our 
Nation’s airports that stand ready to 
protect America’s flying public. Yet, 
this cadre of frontline workers, trans-
portation security officers—also known 
as TSOs—continues to be among the 
lowest paid Federal employees. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5811, the TSA Per-
sonnel Workplace Improvement Act of 
2020, seeks to ease some of the burden 
on TSOs who are also juggling the care 
of small children. The legislation di-
rects TSA to provide lactation facili-
ties for nursing mothers and 12 weeks 
of paid parental leave for all TSA per-
sonnel. 
Under H.R. 5811, these lactation fa-
cilities must be assessed for cleanli-
ness, safety, and accessibility to per-
sonnel duty stations, and TSA must co-
ordinate implementation of the bill 
with relevant stakeholders, including 
the union representing frontline TSA 
officers. Given TSA’s complex and 
challenging mission, the agency must 
explore all options to retain talent, 
which includes parents and nursing 
mothers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel 
Workplace Improvement Act of 2020. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
cham-
pioned by Representative JOHN KATKO, 
will make important enhancements to 
the workplace rights of TSA employ-
ees, in particular, women and nursing 
mothers. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
frontline personnel of the Transpor-
tation Security Administration have 
continued to serve the traveling public 
to keep our Nation’s transportation 
system secure. At a time when the 
criticality of the TSA personnel is so 
clearly demonstrated, we, in Congress, 
have an opportunity with this bill to 
express appreciation for their services. 
H.R. 5811 requires the administrator 
to ensure that employees have access 
to safe, clean, and free lactation facili-
ties for an appropriate amount of time. 
It requires TSA to coordinate with Na-
tional Institutes for Health to ensure 
that lactation facilities meet necessary 
standards. Finally, this legislation will 
ensure paid family leave for the entire 
TSA workforce. 
Mr. Speaker, this corrects an over-
sight in last year’s NDAA that pro-
vided paid family leave to the rest of 
the Federal workforce. I thank the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) for 
his leadership on this important legis-
lation. I also thank the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CORREA) for his 
support of this bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 
5811, a bill that seeks to improve condi-
tions for working parents in TSA’s 
frontline workforce. These improve-
ments may increase morale and reten-
tion, which is critical to ensure the ef-
fectiveness of aviation security in the 
face of evolving threats. 
I thank the gentleman from New 
York for introducing this bill, and I 
urge its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5811, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

bill (H.R. 5804) to amend the Homeland

Blue Campaign of the Department of 
Homeland Security, and for other pur-
poses, as amended.

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-

vise and extend their remarks and to

measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign is 
dedicated to raising awareness about 
how to identify and prevent human 
trafficking. 
Last year, over 4,000 self-reported 
victims and survivors from all over the 
country contacted the U.S. national 
hotline for help with a human traf-
ficking situation, an increase of almost 
20 percent over the previous year. 
Traffickers subject their victims to 
forced labor, debt bondage, or sexual 
exploitation using violence, manipula-
tion, and false promises. 
This DHS campaign works to combat 
trafficking by educating law enforce-
ment and the public on how to recog-
nize the signs of human trafficking. To 
effectively identify trafficking victims 
and keep their community safe, local 
and State law enforcement need to 
have timely information about the tac-
tics and techniques these criminals 
use. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5804, the Blue 
Campaign Enhancement Act, seeks to 
do just that by, among other things, 
expanding human trafficking preven-
tion 
training 
opportunities. 
Impor-
tantly, it would also create new, web- 
based training programs for State and 
local partners to ensure these edu-
cation tools can reach the widest pos-
sible audience. H.R. 5804 has bipartisan 
support and was reported out of com-
mittee by unanimous consent. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

that consideration is willing to forgo action 
on H.R. 5804, with the understanding that we 
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their

In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to

worked regarding this matter and others be-

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
Washington, DC, September 16, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 5804, the ‘‘DHS 
Blue Campaign Act.’’ The Committee on 
Homeland Security recognizes that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary has a jurisdictional 
interest in H.R. 5804, and I appreciate your 
effort to allow this bill to be considered on 
the House floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the 
Committee on the Judiciary with respect to 
its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or 
similar legislation in the future, and I would 
support your effort to seek appointment of 
an appropriate number of conferees to any 
House—Senate conference involving this leg-
islation. 
I will include our letters on H.R. 5804 in the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5804. 
According to DHS, there are millions 
of victims of trafficking worldwide 
each year. Men, women, and children 
are trafficked throughout the world— 
many of the victims right here in the 
United States. 
The Blue Campaign is a national 
campaign designed to promote aware-
ness of trafficking and help identify 
the signs of trafficking. The Blue Cam-
paign conducts outreach to law en-
forcement, the public, and certain in-
dustry professionals. The ability to 
recognize the signs of trafficking can 
lead to rescuing individuals from traf-
ficking and bringing the criminals who 
seek to exploit them to justice. 
This bill would build on the excellent 
work of the DHS Blue Campaign and 
expand its awareness to include even 
more individuals that are likely to en-
counter victims of human trafficking. 
I applaud the efforts of my colleague 
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) and urge 
other Members to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW). 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of my bill, H.R. 5804. 
Human trafficking is modern-day 
slavery. It is one of the most heinous 
crimes imaginable. It deprives its vic-
tims of their inalienable rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
While DHS and the Department of 
Justice are the lead Federal agencies 
in the fight against trafficking, State 
and local law enforcement frequently 
encounter 
victims 
and 
their 
traf-
fickers. Individuals and employees of 
certain industries, such as medical pro-
fessionals, educators, and airline em-
ployees, among others, are also more 
likely to encounter victims and need to 
know how to identify and respond to 
them. This is where the Blue Campaign 
has come in to fill an important gap. 
‘‘Blue Campaign is a national public 
awareness campaign, designed to edu-
cate the public, law enforcement, and 
other industry partners to recognize 
the indicators of human trafficking, 
and how to appropriately respond to 
possible cases.’’ 
In the 10 years since it began, the 
Blue Campaign has helped raise aware-
ness of trafficking. Materials developed 
by the Blue Campaign have helped in-
dividuals outside law enforcement rec-
ognize the signs of trafficking and 
helped those at risk of being trafficked. 
It has fostered communication and 
partnerships between industry, law en-
forcement, and nongovernmental orga-
nizations. 
My bill, H.R. 5804, the DHS Blue 
Campaign Enhancement Act, amends 
the Homeland Security Act to expand 
the 
reach 
of 
the 
Blue 
Campaign 
through the use of online educational 
videos and the creation of a Blue Cam-
paign Advisory Committee within DHS 
to provide support and guidance for fu-
ture development, training, and out-
reach. 
It expands on the great work of the 
Blue Campaign and the fight against 
human trafficking. It is another step 
toward ending the cruel and inhumane 
exploitation by traffickers and res-
cuing those caught in its grasp. 
I appreciate my colleagues’ support 
of this bill.

Mr. MCGOVERN, from the Com-
mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 116–556) on the 
resolution (H. Res. 1161) providing for 
consideration of the Senate amend-
ments to the bill (H.R. 925) to extend 
the authorization of appropriations for 
allocation to carry out approved wet-
lands conservation projects under the 
North American Wetlands Conserva-
tion Act through fiscal year 2024, which 
was referred to the House Calendar and 
ordered to be printed.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF 
SENATE 
AMENDMENTS 
TO 
H.R. 925, NORTH AMERICAN WET-
LANDS 
CONSERVATION 
EXTEN-
SION ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1161 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1161 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 925) to extend 
the authorization of appropriations for allo-
cation to carry out approved wetlands con-
servation projects under the North American 
Wetlands Conservation Act through fiscal 
year 2024, with the Senate amendments 
thereto, and to consider in the House, with-
out intervention of any point of order or 
question of consideration, a single motion 
offered by the chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations or her designee that the House: 
(1) concur in the Senate amendment to the 
title; and (2) concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the text with an amendment con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 
116-66. The Senate amendments and the mo-
tion shall be considered as read. The motion 
shall be debatable for two hours equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON
of Indiana). The gentleman 
from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 
hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the 
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee, pending which I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
b 1630 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 1161, providing 
for consideration of the Senate amend-
ments to H.R. 925, America’s Conserva-
tion Enhancement Act. 
The rule makes in order a single mo-
tion offered by the chair of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations or her des-
ignee that the House: One, concur in 
the Senate amendment to the title; 
and, two, concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the text with an amendment 
consisting of the text of Rules Com-
mittee Print 116–66, which is identical 
to H.R. 8406, the Heroes Act. 
Finally, the rule provides for 2 hours 
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today be-
cause the American people are tired of 
waiting. 
It has been more than 4 months since 
this House passed the Heroes Act in re-
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic to 
help our first responders, healthcare 
workers, struggling businesses, and 
local governments. 
This bill passed this House on May 
15, Mr. Speaker. But what did the Sen-
ate do, Mr. Speaker? Nothing. 
They apparently couldn’t be bothered 
to bring this bill up for a vote in over 
4 months, but it took MITCH MCCON-
NELL roughly 80 minutes after Justice 
Ginsburg passed away to announce a 
vote on a Supreme Court nominee. 
Now, you can’t make this stuff up. 
Something is terribly, terribly wrong 
here. 
More than 205,000 Americans have 
lost their lives due to coronavirus and 
more than 7 million more have been af-
fected. 
Millions of people are out of work, 
small businesses are struggling, and 
some have had to shut their doors for-
ever. Our economy hasn’t taken a hit 
like this since the Great Depression. 
Many families are struggling every day 
to make ends meet. Kids are going hun-
gry. 
This pandemic isn’t going to just dis-
appear overnight, as the President has 
suggested. It is going to take a whole- 
of-government response for quite some 
time, and that requires Congress to 
act. 
The Republicans in the Senate may 
be able to sleep at night telling the 
American people to wait and then wait 
some more and then wait some more

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5091 
September 30, 2020 
while they rubber stamp another judge, 
but I cannot ask our people, our com-
munities, our small businesses, our 
workers and their families to wait any 
longer. No one in this majority can. 
Our country is suffering, and our peo-
ple are in pain. That is why we have 
tried over these past 4 months to strike 
a fair and commonsense deal with Sen-
ate Republicans, but they couldn’t 
even come to an agreement on a pack-
age among themselves. Republicans are 
fighting with Republicans over there, 
so they just abandoned doing anything 
at all. 
Doing nothing is unconscionable. 
I am proud that our Speaker, NANCY 
PELOSI, has never given up. She has 
spoken 
with 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Mnuchin again and again and again 
and again trying to come up with an 
agreement. 
Her offer to this administration was 
simple: let’s meet halfway. Let’s take 
the $3.4 trillion in relief contained in 
the initial Heroes Act and reduce it by 
$1.2 trillion. We would still fund our 
first responders, our small businesses, 
and our State and local governments, 
but we would meet Republicans in the 
middle. We would come down $1 trillion 
and they would come up $1 trillion. 
That is called compromise. That is 
what you do, and it is what you have to 
do from time to time in divided govern-
ment. The bill included in this rule, 
H.R. 8406, reflects that give-and-take. 
There is funding here for State and 
local governments to avert layoffs and 
continue 
critical 
services; 
for 
coronavirus testing, tracing, and treat-
ment; for our hospitals and for our 
healthcare providers; for continuing 
unemployment insurance; and for fami-
lies to pay for necessities like food, 
utilities, and rent during this pan-
demic. 
This revamped Heroes Act totals $2.2 
trillion. Many Democrats, including 
myself, favored the original larger bill. 
My friends on the other side wanted 
something much smaller. But disagree-
ment should never result in inaction. 
One in four children in this country 
are at risk of going hungry this year 
because of this pandemic, Mr. Speaker. 
The lines for food banks in some com-
munities already go for miles. 
People are hurting today, right now. 
We all know that. And if you don’t 
know that, you don’t go back to your 
district. 
We all know what it takes to truly do 
something about it. 
We have pleaded with the Senate to 
take this bill up for months, we have 
negotiated over and over again, and 
today we are back with a compromise 
proposal. 
The only question, Mr. Speaker, is 
whether my Republican colleagues are 
finally ready to take ‘‘yes’’ for an an-
swer. 
On behalf of the most vulnerable 
among us, those who are out of work, 
going hungry, and struggling to get by, 
I pray the answer is finally ‘‘yes.’’ 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues, all my colleagues, to sup-
port this rule and the underlying He-
roes Act so we can finally, finally get 
relief to where it is so badly needed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I 
thank my good friend, the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), 
the distinguished chairman of the 
Rules Committee, for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a rule that provides for con-
sideration of a single item, the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 925, the majority’s 
second attempt to pass a partisan wish 
list under the guise of a coronavirus re-
lief bill. 
There are two quotes that sum up 
how I feel about today’s rule, Mr. 
Speaker. 
The 
first, 
widely 
misattributed to Albert Einstein, is 
that: ‘‘The definition of insanity is 
doing the same thing over and over 
again and expecting different results’’; 
the second, accurately attributed to 
Yogi Berra, is that today’s action feels 
like: ‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’ 
Today, the House majority is bring-
ing up again a partisan coronavirus re-
lief package, just as they did in May. 
As in May, today’s bill was written 
with only Democratic input. 
Like in May, today’s bill has a mas-
sive price tag. This sits at $2.4 trillion. 
As in May, today’s bill contains a 
plethora of provisions that are com-
pletely unrelated to coronavirus relief. 
Indeed, just like in May, today’s bill 
is more akin to a Democratic policy 
wish list than to an actual relief bill. 
And just as in May, we all know what 
the end result will be: the Senate will 
not pass this bill and the President will 
not sign it into law. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way, 
Mr. Speaker. 
For whatever reason, the majority is 
refusing to truly negotiate on a bipar-
tisan coronavirus relief bill that would 
provide real relief for millions of Amer-
icans. 
I grant them, discussions have taken 
place. But when the majority continues 
to insist that it is their way or no way 
and refuses to meet Republicans half-
way, one begins to understand how we 
got to this point. 
Mr. Speaker, I would remind both 
this Chamber and the American people 
that it has been the Democrats who 
have blocked a second coronavirus re-
lief bill. Just last week, House Demo-
crats blocked Republicans from bring-
ing up a simple bill to extend the Pay-
check Protection Program. In the Sen-
ate, Democrats blocked the majority 
from bringing up a clean extension of 
PPP, and later, Democrats blocked a 
Republican-led coronavirus relief bill 
from being considered, not because 
they disagreed with anything in the 
bill, but because they just thought 
other things should be in the bill. 
All of these bills are bills that the 
President would have signed into law. 
At a time when so many Americans 
are truly suffering, why the House ma-
jority insists on blocking these meas-
ures and bringing up their own par-
tisan wish list instead does not make 
sense to me. 
But what makes even less sense is 
the egregious process they followed in 
considering this bill. The process, if 
you can even call it that, violated 
House rules and any notion of fairness. 
The bill was introduced on Monday 
night after being drafted in secret in 
Speaker PELOSI’s office without any 
Republican input whatsoever. No com-
mittee held a hearing on it and no com-
mittee marked it up. That is violating 
the McGovern rule, which requires any 
bill coming before the Rules Com-
mittee to have a hearing and a markup 
in the committee of jurisdiction. 
The bill is 2,152 pages long, and I 
highly doubt that most Members have 
had time to read, review, and digest it 
in that short amount of time. 
I will say this, though: it does set a 
record. It spends $1 billion a page. That 
is pretty remarkable spending. 
When your process is that bad, no 
wonder the output is as bad as the bill 
we are considering today. 
The majority claims that today’s bill 
is a scaled-down version of the Heroes 
Act, a bill we considered back in May. 
If the majority’s funding calculations 
on the amount of money we are spend-
ing in this bill are accurate, that may 
be technically correct, but it still has 
the exact same policies and problems 
as the Heroes Act. 
This bill includes massive spending 
even in areas where we appropriated 
funds as part of the CARES Act in 
March and haven’t fully spent them 
yet: funding for Democratic policy pri-
orities at the expense of bipartisan 
ones; inclusion of provisions that are 
completely unrelated to coronavirus 
relief, like a complicated and con-
troversial multiemployer pension bill, 
a provision revealing an existing provi-
sion of law requiring the auction of T- 
Band spectrum, massive student loan 
forgiveness, and the mandating of a na-
tional vote by mail. 
Some of these may deserve consider-
ation, but what they are doing in a bill 
that is supposed to be about providing 
relief to Americans affected by the 
coronavirus pandemic is beyond me. 
Mr. Speaker, in any bill this size, it 
is inevitable that all Members will find 
at least one provision that they like, 
but it is the package as a whole that is 
offensive and objectionable. 
Drafted without Republican input 
and with nothing but Democratic ideas 
and extraneous policy priorities, it is 
doomed to the same result as happened 
the last time the majority tried this 
approach. 
With their actions today, we will not 
move the ball forward, we will not 
draw closer to a final deal that actu-
ally helps Americans. And what they 
will do is to continue to pass on the 
chance to actually work together as a 
bipartisan institution and to provide 
real help to the American people. 
Just as in May, the majority is put-
ting up a partisan bill, when what we

H5092 
September 30, 2020 
need is a bipartisan deal. We did that 
four times before, Mr. Speaker. If we 
chose to, we could do so again. 
They are doing the same thing again 
and expecting a different result. 
Mr. Speaker, it didn’t have to be this 
way. There are many areas where we 
agree: Paycheck Protection Program; 
additional money for schools to reopen; 
a one-time payment of $1,200 per indi-
vidual, $500 per child in households 
making less than $75,000 a year; addi-
tional money to speed the distribution 
of vaccines. 
Those are areas we could bring out 
one at a time or bundled together and 
pass. Instead, my friends have chosen 
to use a formula they know is doomed 
to failure. 
As to the amount, the President has 
actually been flexible. The original 
Senate proposal was $1 trillion, no in-
considerable sum of money, I might 
add. The President moved that up to 
$1.5 trillion. That wasn’t good enough, 
even though many members of my 
friend’s party actually supported that, 
the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus. 
So I don’t want to belabor the point, 
but I know the difference between a se-
rious effort to pass legislation that has 
a chance of passing in the Senate and 
being signed by the President and a 
messaging exercise, and that is all we 
are engaged in today. So it is indeed, 
Mr. Speaker, deja vu all over again. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that 
when my friend says this is a Demo-
cratic wish list of things, I mean, the 
fact of the matter is, we are trying to 
respond to a pandemic. We haven’t had 
to deal with something like this since 
1918. 
b 1645 
It has basically impacted our econ-
omy in ways that have resulted in mil-
lions of people losing their jobs. We 
have schools that have not fully re-
opened because it is not safe. We have 
had shortages of PPE. We don’t have 
adequate testing. I can go on and on 
and on. 
But the wish list that this bill ad-
dresses has things like we support 
small businesses. We improve the Pay-
check Protection Program. That is 
hardly—I would like to think Repub-
licans share that, too. 
Additional assistance for the airline 
industry workers: Is that so controver-
sial? 
More funds to bolster education and 
childcare: Given what we are going 
through, is that controversial? 
We honor our heroes. We provide as-
sistance to State, local, territorial, and 
Tribal governments that desperately 
need funds to pay first responders. Is 
that a point of contention? 
It supports testing, tracing, and 
treatment; provides additional direct 
payments for those who are unem-
ployed; 
protects 
payrolls; 
ensures 
worker safety; preserves health cov-
erage; restores unemployment benefits; 
bolsters housing assistance; strength-
ens food security at a time when a 
record number of Americans are going 
hungry. 
Again, just to put this in context, we 
passed something 4 months ago. Four 
months ago, we sent it over to the Sen-
ate. Now, they should have passed 
something, and then we could have ne-
gotiated the differences. That is the 
way it usually works. 
The Republicans are fighting with 
Republicans over in the Senate. There 
is a big chunk of Republicans who 
don’t want to appropriate one more 
penny for the American people. No, 
they don’t have the time. But they 
have the time to rush through another 
Supreme Court Justice, in record time. 
I guess what is so frustrating is that 
some of my friends act like this is not 
an emergency, like, you know, we can 
just kind of go along and everything 
will be fine. This is an emergency. 
We haven’t faced a crisis like this in 
our lifetime, and if we don’t have an 
all-out comprehensive approach, not a 
scalpel approach—it is not just about 
PPP. It is also about our schools, our 
healthcare workers, our first respond-
ers. It is about a whole bunch of stuff. 
But if we don’t have an all-comprehen-
sive approach, then this economy is 
going to have a very difficult time re-
covering. 
It is just frustrating to me. I was 
home in Massachusetts. I did tours of 
restaurants in my district, and people 
have been visiting some of our res-
taurants, eating outside. But in Massa-
chusetts, we get winters. It is going to 
get cold soon, and pretty soon, people 
are not going to want to eat outside. 
They won’t be able to. 
If people don’t feel safe going inside 
because, as we are seeing now in a 
number of States that aren’t following 
some of the recommendations of the 
CDC, we see case numbers going up. So 
if we had another surge, how are these 
restaurants going to survive? They are 
going to shut their doors forever. 
We have an opportunity to provide a 
lifeline until we get through all of this. 
I mean, there are so many aspects of 
our economy that have been impacted 
by this, so many people who are just 
struggling to get by. 
It is unconscionable to me that this 
hasn’t occupied a greater sense of ur-
gency in the Republican leader’s mind 
over in the Senate. I just don’t get it. 
It really is so disappointing to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, let me yield 
myself such time as I may consume 
just to quickly make a couple of points 
and then move to my friend from Ari-
zona. 
Far be it for me, Mr. Speaker, to de-
fend the upper body. I am a very proud 
Member of this House, as I know all of 
us here are. 
But it is worth noting for the RECORD 
the Senate actually had 52 votes to 
pass a bill. It was my friend’s party 
that kept them from considering it. 
As to the Supreme Court, thank 
goodness they don’t have to deal with 
the House of Representatives. That is 
why they are able to move quickly. 
They could move pretty quickly if they 
had somebody they could deal with 
here as well. 
It is my friends who have chosen to 
craft legislation that they know will be 
unacceptable, that they know the 
President will not sign, and then rail 
at them for not passing it and the 
President for not signing it. That is the 
height of chutzpah, if you will. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mrs. 
LESKO), my distinguished friend and 
fellow member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. COLE for yielding me the time. 
I agree with Chairman MCGOVERN 
that we need to help the American peo-
ple. There are still people hurting out 
there, and they need help from us. 
That is why it is so frustrating to me 
that we have this bill in front of us be-
cause it is just a very similar version 
to the partisan bill that the Democrats 
pushed out of here just a few months 
ago that they know is not going to get 
anywhere. 
I remember seeing in the media how 
Democrats in the House in swing dis-
tricts 
were 
asking, 
pleading 
with 
Speaker PELOSI, to please negotiate 
with the Republicans and the President 
to actually get a bill that will be 
passed and signed into law because, 
after all, you all know that if you real-
ly want to help the American people, 
you have to have a bill that is actually 
able to get signed into law, and this 
bill is not it. 
Unfortunately, this bill, once again, 
highlights a lot of the priorities that 
my Democratic colleagues have that 
have nothing to do with coronavirus, 
quite frankly. 
One of the things that I found very 
interesting in this bill is that, in the 
original Heroes Act that was passed a 
few months ago, they had $600 million 
in there for the COPS hiring program. 
That is to help State and local law en-
forcement. Curiously enough, it is not 
in this version of the bill. 
So I was wondering, is this how they 
are planning to save some money on 
the bill, to take away funding for po-
lice and law enforcement? 
Also in this bill, once again, is ex-
tending the extra $600 a week in unem-
ployment assistance into the beginning 
and through spring of next year. Well, 
many businesses, multiple businesses, 
have told us that they are having trou-
ble hiring workers back because work-
ers are getting paid more to stay at 
home and not work. This is right here 
in that bill, in this bill, right now. 
We cannot pay people more to stay 
home and not work. We need to 
incentivize them to come back to 
work. 
This bill also allows illegal immi-
grants to get $1,200 stimulus checks

and 
their 
children 
$500 
stimulus 
checks. That is right here in this lan-
guage, right here in this bill. American 
citizens, my taxpayers in Arizona, do 
not want to subsidize illegal immi-
grants. 
This bill also removes safeguards in 
the Paycheck Protection Program. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Arizona an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mrs. LESKO. This bill also removes 
any protections from using taxpayer 
dollars to fund abortions. That is right 
here in this bill. 
This bill, as Representative COLE also 
said, federalizes elections. In fact, it 
prohibits States from requiring voter 
ID. Arizona requires voter ID. This bill 
would take that away. 
It also legalizes ballot harvesting. 
Arizona opposed—the legislature said 
no ballot harvesting. This would bring 
it right back, right here in this bill. 
Again, it would also provide tax 
breaks to millionaires and billionaires 
in blue States that require taxpayers 
in low-tax States, like Arizona, to sub-
sidize them. 
That is why we can’t support this 
bill. There are too many poison pills. 
Please come up with something that 
we can agree on to help the American 
people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Texas, I just want to say a couple 
of things for the RECORD. 
I guess the new Republican tactic—if 
anybody watched the debate yester-
day—is to try to twist and turn and 
confuse people. 
The gentlewoman implied that this 
somehow defunds police. I mean, there 
is $436 billion in here to provide assist-
ance directly to State and local gov-
ernments to support the police. 
If my friend was so interested in sup-
porting the police, she should know 
that the bill that Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL brought up 
provided no money for State and local 
governments. I mean nothing. 
In fact, that bill didn’t provide 
money for a lot of the most needy peo-
ple in this country who are suffering as 
a result of this virus: no money for nu-
trition to help our families who are 
going hungry, no money for a lot of the 
priorities that I know are priorities not 
only in my district but all over the 
country. 
The bottom line is, my friends can 
come up with excuse after excuse after 
excuse to not support this. But by not 
supporting it, we are not supporting 
the American people at a time of des-
perate need. 
Again, we have come down $1.3 tril-
lion from what we originally put for-
ward, not because we think it is nec-
essarily the right thing to do, because 
the need is so great. We are doing it to 
try to find ways to accommodate, to 
move this process forward. And obvi-
ously, my friends make up ways to jus-
tify their voting ‘‘no’’ on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
say to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, the American people cannot take 
this anymore. 
And my good friend from Oklahoma, 
I know the compassion that he has. We 
have worked together, as well as my 
friends from Ohio and Arizona. 
But yesterday, I stood with the 
mayor of the city of Houston, and we 
announced a mental health hotline for 
people being impacted by COVID–19. 
Yes, the stress of COVID–19 is taking a 
toll on the American people. They need 
relief. 
A very proud, brave parent got up to 
talk about how difficult it is to vir-
tually teach her children while she 
works and how concerned she was. 
Why? Because the mandate comes from 
on high—the White House—that if you 
are not having your children in school 
in some form, meaning in the build-
ings, because that is the decision she 
was grappling with, then you don’t get 
money. 
They have no money. They have no 
money to have expanded buildings or 
temporary buildings so that they can 
help parents who work have children 
safely in school. They have no money 
for testing. They have no money to be 
able to provide for sick employees from 
COVID–19. 
So I rise today to say: The American 
people cannot take it anymore. The 
stress is enormous. What we have done 
here is a very merciful response to the 
bill we already passed, that our friends, 
conflicted with each other and the 
White House, cannot seem to get a grip 
on. 
I support $225 billion for education 
and childcare, $436 billion in assistance 
to our State and local governments. 
I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for making it 
clear. Those are our municipal work-
ers. Those are police and fire, and we 
need it because who has gotten sick? 
Police officers, firefighters. And we 
need this money. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentle-
woman from Texas an additional 1 
minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
need the testing. We are doing testing 
on the last pennies of the money that 
we were granted through the leader-
ship, our Speaker and others. 
They need testing. I will be in a sta-
dium this coming week, trying to get 
people tested. That is how much we 
need it. 
Then, of course, $28 billion in pro-
curement, distribution, education, ma-
terials for the vaccine. 
But I want to focus on the $600 for 
unemployment, the money for the 
$1,200, as well as the money for rental 
and mortgage to prevent mortgage 
foreclosure. The restaurant money, I 
want it for the independent pizza shops 
who hire people, for the workers who 
are going to be out of work, like air-
port workers or airline workers. The 
food insecurity, people are standing on 
line to get food. 
What don’t my good friends under-
stand? That people are desperate, and 
they are in need? 
I wish we were not discussing ques-
tions 
about 
white 
supremacy 
and 
whether or not someone believed it or 
not. I wish we would stay focused on 
getting this bill passed for the des-
perate people, no matter what back-
grounds they are. 
I want to rise in enthusiastic support 
for this Heroes bill, H.R. 8406. Let’s 
pass it now. 
b 1700 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring 
up H.R. 8265, a bill to extend the Pay-
check Protection Program through the 
end of the year and release $137 billion 
in unspent funds for that program. 
Mr. Speaker, every Member of Con-
gress can agree we need to enact relief 
for the millions suffering from the pan-
demic, but we should only move for-
ward on legislation that can actually 
be signed into law. The measure the 
majority is attempting to pass today 
simply doesn’t fit that bill. Absent a 
comprehensive bipartisan package, we 
should pass smaller pieces where there 
is broad consensus, such as the Pay-
check Protection Program. 
PPP is of great importance to our 
constituents. It is helping keep mil-
lions of Americans employed and re-
ceiving a paycheck. Members on both 
sides of the aisle and in both Chambers 
agree that this crucial program needs 
to be extended, and it could be ex-
tended today if the majority were to 
bring a bipartisan bill extending PPP 
to the floor. 
But you don’t have to take my word 
for it, Mr. Speaker. Many House Demo-
crats agree we need to pass a true relief 
bill now rather than just another polit-
ical messaging bill. 
A bipartisan letter recently sent to 
the Speaker stressed that ‘‘failing to 
reach a deal is unacceptable and is a 
failure of duty to the American peo-
ple.’’ 
A separate letter sent to the Speaker 
by eight Democrats last week de-
manded ‘‘a vote on a clean relief pack-
age that has direct assistance for those 
in need.’’ 
Perhaps the most telling is a third 
letter sent just a few days ago and 
signed by 23 Democrats. These Mem-
bers correctly point out to their lead-
ers that, absent a bipartisan deal, a 
‘‘discharge petition is the only poten-
tial option for COVID–19-related action 
on the House floor.’’ 
As my colleagues know, House Re-
publicans have such a discharge peti-
tion ready to be signed, and we look 
forward to these Members joining us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5094 
September 30, 2020 
However, I would point out, Madam 
Speaker, to my colleagues that we 
don’t have to wait for a discharge peti-
tion to succeed. We can take a clear 
step right now by defeating the pre-
vious question and bringing H.R. 8265 
up for an immediate vote. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Okla-
homa? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), who is 
my good friend and the ranking mem-
ber of the Small Business Committee, 
to explain more about this critical bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding, Madam Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, or PPP as many of us 
refer to it, has been shut down now for 
over 50 days. That is nearly 2 months 
that small businesses have been unable 
to access approximately $137 billion 
that still remains in the program that 
was supposed to go for their relief. 
Small businesses and their workers 
need our help. Small businesses employ 
nearly half of the workers in this Na-
tion, one out of two. Think of that. One 
out of every two people employed in 
this Nation works for one of America’s 
small businesses. Not only do they rep-
resent millions of workers, but they 
also are the Nation’s job creators. They 
create approximately two out of every 
three new jobs in America. 
Of course, these aren’t just statistics. 
One example of an outstanding small 
business owner is Lacie Sims. Re-
cently, I had the opportunity to visit 
Lacie’s business, the Village Family 
Restaurant, in Waynesville, Ohio, back 
in my district. 
Lacie spoke with me about how she 
used the Paycheck Protection Program 
to keep her 25 workers employed so 
that they could continue to serve the 
community and, most importantly, 
continue to support their families. 
Lacie went on to tell me about how she 
quickly adapted her business to accom-
modate pickup, delivery, and safe in-
door dining. 
Like Lacie, many small business 
owners have adapted and persevered 
through the pandemic. Unfortunately, 
COVID–19 continues to challenge their 
very existence. 
Now is the time for us to act, and we 
have an option before us here today. If 
we defeat today’s previous question, we 
can move directly to my legislation to 
reopen the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, the PPP program. H.R. 8265 
would provide targeted assistance to 
small businesses that truly need the 
Federal Government’s help. 
This legislation gives small busi-
nesses the opportunity to receive a sec-
ond PPP if they can demonstrate a sig-
nificant revenue reduction or a first- 
round loan if they didn’t get one the 
first time. Additionally, it adds more 
flexibility in how the PPP dollars can 
be spent and still be eligible for loan 
forgiveness. 
Many 
small 
businesses 
are 
still 
struggling across this country. We need 
to act now to help these small busi-
nesses, the people that they employ, 
and the families that they, in turn, 
support. 
Let’s defeat the previous question 
and restart the Paycheck Protection 
Program. The Nation’s economy is at 
stake. We still have $137 billion sitting 
there that was intended to go to these 
small businesses. We don’t have to allo-
cate any more funding. The funding is 
there. 
Now, my Democratic colleagues have 
said that they are for small business. 
This is the time not just to talk the 
talk but to walk the walk. You get two 
opportunities, Madam Speaker, you 
can vote against this previous question 
or you can sign the discharge petition. 
Either one of them gives us another 
vote. 
Let’s save these small businesses. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The gentleman would be happy to 
know that, in this bill that we are 
bringing before here, we have most of 
what he requested but more. Our PPP 
language is more expansive, because a 
lot of businesses didn’t qualify under 
the old formula. 
But I do have to say that it really 
pains me that my friends don’t under-
stand that it is not just about small 
businesses. It is about our cities and 
towns and our first responders. 
We have communities that are about 
to fire firefighters and police officers. 
Isn’t that important to my friends? 
Or helping to pay for schools to re-
open safely or to be able to help kids 
get an education remotely or in a hy-
brid way, doesn’t that fall on the top 
list of my Republican friends? 
Healthcare coverage, the airline in-
dustry, which is about to lay off thou-
sands of workers, we provide some help 
for them, but yet that doesn’t make 
the cut. 
So, yes, we can have a scalpel ap-
proach to this. We will do a little bit 
here and maybe we will do a little bit 
there, but that fails to recognize the 
severity of the crisis that we are now 
in. 
Open your eyes and look at what is 
happening in this country, in large 
part, due to the mismanagement of 
this President, which is unconscion-
able. 
But here in Congress, we can’t deal 
with him. We can’t fix the way he ap-
proaches his job. But we can provide di-
rect resources to businesses and to 
local governments that can help keep 
our economy afloat until we can get by 
this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak on this. 
I 
commend 
our 
leadership, 
the 
Speaker, for again putting forward leg-
islation to support working families, 
local government, and healthcare as we 
deal with the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This updated Heroes Act provides for 
another round of cash payments, hous-
ing and food assistance, help for unem-
ployed workers, and targeted relief for 
small businesses who need it most, like 
independent restaurants. 
I would like to speak on that for a 
moment because I am very proud that 
this legislation includes $120 billion 
from our RESTAURANTS Act for sav-
ing 500,000 independent restaurants and 
their 11 million employees. This sector 
of the economy totals $1 trillion when 
you deal with all those organizations, 
all their supply chains, and ancillary 
effects. 
Local, independent restaurants are 
the cornerstone of communities large 
and small, your community and mine. 
I think it is hard to imagine what life 
would be like in Oklahoma City or Cin-
cinnati or Portland, Oregon, without 
those vital institutions. That is where 
communities come together. They pro-
vide a disproportionate avenue for eco-
nomic success for minorities, immi-
grants, and women-owned enterprises. 
A restaurant for many of us was the 
first job, and it is an avenue for moving 
forward. 
They 
are, 
unfortunately, 
hurting 
more than any other industry. They 
are the largest contributor to unem-
ployment. One in four job losses is in 
this industry. We have a chance to do 
something about it. They are the larg-
est contributor of unemployment of 
any sector—one in four job losses. In 
fact, they were half the unemployed in 
April. Already one in six restaurants 
have closed their doors permanently, 
but this legislation provides relief for 
those who are hanging on by a thread. 
The evidence is that if we don’t take 
action like this that is targeted for 
independent restaurants, we are going 
to have 85 percent of them close by the 
end of the year permanently. 
The Heroes Act targets $120 billion of 
our RESTAURANTS Act that would 
generate $250 billion in economic im-
pact. It would support millions of res-
taurant workers, truck drivers, farm-
ers, and fishermen—people who support 
this critical industry. It is not just the 
fruits and vegetables and the linens. 
Think about it for a moment, Madam 
Speaker. All of those are involved. 
This legislation would, by giving $120 
billion of direct relief, provide $250 bil-
lion in economic savings by having 
people not filing bankruptcy and not 
adding to the unemployed ranks, but 
keeping them in business paying taxes, 
paying employees, and keeping those 
essential food supply chains going. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Oregon an 
additional 1 minute.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5095 
September 30, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
independent restaurants are the true 
and 
quintessential 
embodiment 
of 
small businesses. What this legislation 
is geared for is the small, independent 
restaurants. That assistance is more 
important now than ever. 
It is sad that we have not had much 
bipartisan support in the House for 
this, although in the Senate there are 
40 cosponsors including a number of 
Republicans led by Senator WICKER 
from Mississippi. I would hope that my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
would see fit to vote for this legisla-
tion, vote to save independent res-
taurants, and be able to move forward 
in a way that will benefit every com-
munity across America. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to re-
spond quickly to my friends and point 
out something that is striking to me in 
listening to the debate. There is almost 
nothing that any of my friends have 
mentioned that we don’t support—al-
most nothing. All these worthy pro-
grams for restaurants, all this relief for 
individuals, and all this help, we all 
agree with that. It is the things my 
friends don’t mention that they have in 
their bill that we don’t agree with. 
We don’t agree with more money for 
Planned Parenthood. That has no place 
in this bill. 
We obviously have very serious objec-
tions to federalizing the election sys-
tem of this country, which is State 
based. That has no place in this bill. 
We obviously don’t want to give a tax 
break to millionaires and billionaires 
in blue States by getting rid of the 
State and local tax limitations that 
were placed in. 
Those are the things, none of which 
have anything to do with coronavirus, 
that we object to. Those are the things 
that my friends are insisting on that 
they cannot pass in the United States 
Senate and that the President will not 
sign. 
If they want to actually pass all 
these other wonderful things, we agree 
with them, and we have been very gen-
erous in terms of the amount of money. 
The President has moved up on that. 
Money is a negotiable item here. Pol-
icy positions—poison pills, as my good 
friend from Arizona said—are not, and 
that is what is keeping us from acting. 
Frankly, that is a tragedy and a trav-
esty, in my view, Madam Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge 
opposition to the rule. Today’s bill is 
nothing more than a Democratic wish 
list masquerading as a coronavirus re-
lief bill, roughly the same as the par-
tisan bill the majority passed back in 
May and it was never taken up by the 
Senate, would never be signed by the 
President. 
As in May, today’s bill is ultimately 
doomed. It will not pass the Senate. 
The President has made it clear he will 
not sign it. 
Madam Speaker, the majority is 
missing a real chance here. The Amer-
ican people are suffering as a result of 
the coronavirus. It is past time for the 
two parties to do what we did very suc-
cessfully four times in a row in a 10- 
week period and work together and ac-
tually provide a package that provides 
real relief for the American people. 
There are plenty of things we agree 
on, such as the extension of the Pay-
check Protection Program, such as en-
suring that more funds are provided for 
testing and tracing, such as one-time 
payments of $1,200 per individual and 
$500 per child to every household mak-
ing less than $75,000 a year. We disagree 
about the exact amount, but we agree 
every American who is unemployed, 
through no fault of their own, should 
get at least $400 more a week. 
Frankly, because the Democrats did 
not take up that offer, those people 
have gotten zero since the end of July. 
We absolutely agree that we need addi-
tional 
money 
for 
the 
opening 
of 
schools. 
Madam Speaker, so why don’t we put 
on the floor—it is a novel suggestion— 
the things we agree on, the things we 
know the Senate will pass and we know 
the President would sign. The only rea-
son we have failed to do that is because 
the Democratic leadership has made 
the decision that we have to agree on 
everything before we do anything. That 
is no way to legislate in a body that 
has a Democratic majority in the 
House, a Republican majority in the 
Senate, and a Republican President. 
The majority is not in the position to 
dictate to either the Senate or the 
President what is going to happen, but 
they are in a powerful position to nego-
tiate, and negotiate in good faith, and 
focus on the areas where we agree. 
Madam Speaker, I think that would 
move us forward productively. I think 
that would be in the best interests of 
the American people. So I call on the 
majority to end this charade and en-
gage with Republicans in the House, 
the Senate, and the administration and 
come to an agreement on a real bipar-
tisan relief package. I know my friends 
can do it because we did it together 
four times in a row. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and ‘‘no’’ 
on the underlying bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I have served in this 
House for many years. I have been here 
through unimaginable tragedies, like 
September 11. Every time this Nation 
has been challenged, we came to-
gether—not as Democrats or Repub-
licans, but as Americans. Never could I 
have imagined that after a shock like 
the coronavirus, that has taken more 
than 205,000 lives, that we would strug-
gle to reach a compromise. 
The House did its job more than 4 
months ago when we passed the origi-
nal Heroes Act; the Senate abdicated 
its responsibility. But we have not 
walked away. We have not stopped try-
ing to help protect the lives and liveli-
hood of people that we represent. We 
are back today with a bill that puts on 
paper the compromises that we are 
willing to make, not to get a win for 
one side or the other, but to help the 
American people in the middle of a 
pandemic. That is what this is all 
about. 
Madam Speaker, to my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, I beg, please 
don’t abandon the American people. 
Don’t throw up your hands and walk 
away because you don’t like every line 
of this bill. Take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. 
Madam Speaker, this bill doesn’t 
Federalize elections. It provides safe-
guards for elections and provides fund-
ing to States to be able to carry out 
elections safely in the middle of a pan-
demic. To object over the fact that this 
bill protects Americans from losing 
their health coverage is startling to 
me, although it shouldn’t be, because 
the President, as we speak, is in court 
trying to get the Affordable Care Act 
repealed outright, where millions of 
people would lose their healthcare, 
people 
with 
preexisting 
conditions 
would lose that protection, and you 
wouldn’t be able to keep your kids on 
your insurance until they are 26. 
Think about it: In the middle of a 
pandemic, that is the priority of this 
White House—to rip healthcare away 
from people. It takes my breath away 
what a disconnect there is about what 
the American people need and what 
some of my friends’ priorities are. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join us in compromising to get 
something done. I get it. This is an 
election year and people are used to 
running to their political corners, but 
this crisis demands more than just 
business as usual. It demands action. 
And it demands more than a scalpel ap-
proach: ‘‘Well, let me do a little bit 
here,’’ or ‘‘let me do a little bit there.’’ 
I am told that the White House 
doesn’t want to fund nutrition pro-
grams to help make sure that no one in 
this country goes hungry. I can’t be-
lieve anybody would take that posi-
tion, but we are told that is one of the 
hot button items that people don’t 
want to fund, that it is one of the 
Democratic priorities that is so con-
troversial. 
Really? Even before this pandemic, 
we had 40 million people in this coun-
try who didn’t know where their next 
meal was going to come from; and 
every year it is a battle to make sure 
they don’t cut nutrition programs. But 
now we are in a pandemic and hunger 
has increased dramatically in this 
country. Every one of us should not 
only be concerned about that, but we 
should be ashamed that that is a re-
ality in the richest country in the his-
tory of the world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to come together. This is an

RECOGNIZING BARB IVES

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank 
and celebrate someone who has been a 
dedicated member of my team for 
many years now. Barb Ives, a field rep-
resentative and office manager, re-
cently surpassed a 20-year milestone 
representing our district.

my 
predecessor 
Congressman 
John 
Peterson. We were truly blessed to wel-
come her to the Thompson Team. 
Barb is an active member in her com-
munity and never stops working hard 
for our constituents, helping individ-
uals get much-needed assistance on 
issues related to the VA, Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and so much more. She 
is the kind of person who is willing to 
step up, take charge, and get the job 
done. 
In the little spare time she has when 
she is not helping others, Barb is an 
avid golfer and a wonderful singer. I 
can’t thank Barb enough for her hard 
work and dedication and sense of 
humor over the years. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE BOTTO FAMILY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize a well-known and be-
loved family in south Jersey, the 
Bottos. 
The 
Botto 
family 
embodies 
the 
American Dream. Under the vision of 
Robert Sr.—the Sausage King, or Big 
Bob—the Bottos followed their meat 
market with the Botto’s Italian Line 
restaurant, a supermarket, catering 
and banquet hall. 
I can attest, the Bottos’ family sau-
sage, meatballs, and meats are abso-
lutely delicious. I had the pleasure of 
touring some of the facilities last 
month with Dominic and Enrico Botto. 
Your family is a testament to the 
fact that hard work and passion will 
get you far in life. And in the minds of 
everyone who has ever had the pleasure 
of enjoying a meal or spending time 
with you, this is the true American 
Dream, a family who worked hard, who 
reached for the brass ring, who did 
more, and never gave up. 
God bless you and your family for 
your commitment to the community, 
and I look forward to plenty of full 
stomachs in the future. 
f 
THE GROWING THREAT IN CHINA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
China Task Force uncovered reprehen-
sible behavior from the Chinese Com-
munist Party, and it is time that we 
hold them accountable. 
This body has taken action to con-
demn the gross state-sponsored oppres-
sion of the Uyghurs and stood strongly 
in support of freedom and democracy in 
Hong Kong. 
However, the COVID–19 pandemic 
spotlighted for the American people 
the growing threat the Chinese Com-
munist Party poses. 
From the beginning, the CCP has 
covered up vital medical information, 
allowing what could have been a local 
outbreak in Wuhan to turn into the 
global pandemic that decimated our 
economy, killed almost a million peo-
ple worldwide, and weakened the Amer-
ican resolve. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the 
China Task Force for their hard work 
making realistic policy recommenda-
tions to help the U.S. stand strong in 
the face of the growing threat in China. 
f 
HEALING THE NATION 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise because in the last day, I feel 
compelled to speak about healing the 
Nation. 
Through my years of service, I have 
been able to serve on a number of com-
mittees and alliances in my Congres-
sional district, in my city, in my State, 
that brought people together. 
I was chairperson of the Interfaith 
Ministries. 
I participated in a campaign of No 
More Hate. 
I have interacted with Muslims and 
Jewish communities alike. 
Where the Nation is now is not where 
her values are. The Nation is not tak-
ing the attention that is being given by 
the world because of the rise of white 
supremacy—Boogaloo 
Boys, 
Proud 
Boys. 
The Nation needs a healer and a uni-
fier. We, as the American people, are 
much better when we disagree and ac-
knowledge our disagreement, but we 
are unified around the values of equal-
ity and justice in this Nation. 
Those of us who want to improve po-
lice community relationships are not 
antipolice and should not be seen as 
that. Black Lives Matter is not a ter-
rorist group. In fact, the terrorist 
groups have been designated as white 
supremacists. 
Let us unify and come together 
around the truth. I am ready to do so 
to heal the Nation. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DARRELL WOOD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Darrell Wood and his patriotic con-
tributions to the city of Benton, Ar-
kansas. 
Earlier 
this 
summer, 
Benton’s 
mayor, Tom Farmer, noticed a street 
adorned with American flags. Over the 
coming weeks, Mayor Farmer noticed 
that more and more flags were appear-
ing around the city until nearly every 
street in Benton was decorated. After 
asking citizens, Mayor Farmer deter-
mined that Mr. Wood was responsible 
for this patriotic display. 
To show their appreciation, Mayor 
Farmer and the City Council formally 
honored Mr. Wood for his contributions 
to the community with a commemora-
tive plaque. The beautiful sight of 
these flags has inspired others in the 
community to add more of their own. 
Mr. Woods’ actions have served as a 
bright light in these trying times, and 
we thank him for his selfless service to 
his city. 
RECOGNIZING JAMES ‘‘SKIP’’ RUTHERFORD 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize 
James ‘‘Skip’’ Rutherford, who an-
nounced plans to retire as dean of the 
University of Arkansas, Clinton School 
of Public Service in Little Rock. 
Mr. Rutherford has served in this 
role since 2006 and planned to retire 
earlier this year but stayed longer than 
expected to help the school, students, 
faculty, and staff weather the storm of 
COVID–19, which shows his dedication 
to the lives of those with whom he 
works. 
Skip had a passion for public service 
at a young age as he watched the elec-
tion returns on the courthouse lawn in 
Batesville, Arkansas. He believed in 
order to make a real difference, you 
need to roll up your sleeves and get in 
the arena. He was instrumental in the 
building of the Clinton Presidential Li-
brary, the development of the River 
Market District, and coordinating the 
40th anniversary commemoration of 
the 1957 integration of Little Rock Cen-
tral High School, which in turn led to 
the school being named a national his-
toric site. 
Martha and I wish Skip a fulfilling 
and active retirement.

RECOGNIZING GRADY SPANN 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Grady Spann, the director of Arkansas 
State Parks, who was recently named 
president of the National Association 
of State Park Directors. 
Mr. Spann is a 27-year employee of 
Arkansas State Parks, having pre-
viously served as superintendent of the 
Ozark Folk Center, Historic Wash-
ington, and the Parkin Archaeological 
State Park. In 2012, he was named su-
pervisor of Region 5, a newly created 
region of State parks. 
Mr. Spann’s passion and dedication 
earned him not only the position of di-
rector of Arkansas State Parks in 2016, 
but now as president of the National 
Association of State Park Directors. 
The association aims to promote and 
advance State park systems through-
out the United States. 
Grady’s commitment to the preserva-
tion of the Natural State and beyond is 
evident in his leadership. I congratu-
late Grady Spann and wish him well in 
this new leadership assignment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5099 
September 30, 2020 
Morrilton, Arkansas, on the occasion 
of their 75th year of service. 
Post 4453, also known as the Martin- 
Bradley Post, has been given their Dia-
mond Jubilee Award for their excep-
tionally long and dedicated service to 
veterans in the Morrilton area. 
Our Veterans of Foreign Wars posts 
in Arkansas do so much to support our 
heroes, once they return home from 
service, by providing access to re-
sources and a sense of community. The 
VFW posts also honor veterans once 
they pass, keeping their memories 
alive in the hearts of central Arkan-
sans. 
Every year for the Fourth of July, 
VFW Post 4453 lines up American flags 
for the Morrilton Walk of Flags. Each 
of these flags is a visual reminder of 
the 
brave 
men 
and 
women 
from 
Conway County who defended our free-
dom at home and abroad. 
Thank you to our central Arkansas 
veterans who have laid their lives on 
the line for country, and congratula-
tions to the Martin-Bradley Post of the 
American Veterans of Foreign Wars for 
their 75 years of service. May they 
serve many more in the years ahead. 
HONORING DALE ENGLISH 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a great Arkansas public servant, Mr. 
Dale English. He was 80 years old. 
Before passing, Dale served the city 
of Searcy for 33 years as city council-
man, and he served the fire department 
for 20 years, retiring as captain. 
Throughout his years of public serv-
ice, Mr. English developed a reputation 
as a thoughtful, intelligent leader who 
earned the respect of his peers. 
As a constant presence on the Searcy 
City Council for the past 33 years, Mr. 
English’s knowledge and experience 
were only matched by his love and 
commitment to youth sports. 
His memory will serve the commu-
nity as a model of an effective, dedi-
cated public servant for years to come. 
I join the citizens of Searcy and all 
Arkansans in honoring the remarkable 
life of Dale English. He will be missed. 
May he rest in peace. 
RECOGNIZING RYAN CHRISTIANSEN 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 
accomplishments and service of Ryan 
Christiansen of Bald Knob, Arkansas. 
Ryan is a member of Troop 157 of the 
Boy Scouts of America. His goal was 
always to become an Eagle Scout, 
which he accomplished on April 25, 
2019, after earning 51 Scouting badges, 
30 more than the number required. 
For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan 
built a mobile drop box for the proper 
retirement of American flags. He is ad-
ditionally working to place Purple 
Heart parking signs at businesses in 
his area. 
The Arkansas Veterans of Foreign 
Wars named Ryan the 2020 Eagle Scout 
of the Year. He was additionally hon-
ored with a challenge coin from the 
White County Sheriff’s Office, and 
County Judge Mike Lincoln named Au-
gust 7 Ryan Christiansen Appreciation 
Day coinciding with Purple Heart Day. 
Now a freshman at Arkansas State 
University, 
Mr. 
Christiansen 
has 
worked tirelessly in the service of oth-
ers, and I am proud to honor his hard 
work and perseverance today. 
RECOGNIZING BARRY MCKUIN 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Barry McKuin. Barry is stepping down 
from his responsibilities after 15 years 
of service to the Winthrop Rockefeller 
Institute as an original board member 
and advocate for this important non-
profit organization. 
Mr. McKuin first served as the CFO 
of Winrock Farms after Governor Win-
throp Rockefeller passed away in 1973, 
and his involvement only grew from 
there. He was heavily involved in the 
Conway County Economic Develop-
ment Corporation and served as its 
president. 
Barry has always put his community, 
the town of Morrilton, on the map by 
involving the town in the Uncommon 
Communities 
Program, 
which 
pro-
motes local community and economic 
development. 
Lisenne Rockefeller, Institute board 
member, said, ‘‘Barry saw the big pic-
ture, focused on the future, and kept 
others on track.’’ 
Mr. McKuin’s service to the nonprofit 
and community are greatly appre-
ciated. Congratulations on his success-
ful tenure at the Winthrop Rockefeller 
Institute, and we wish Barry McKuin 
success in years to come. 
RECOGNIZING MARY NEWSOME 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, today, I recognize the career 
and contributions of Mary Newsome to 
the University of Arkansas Community 
College at Morrilton and to Conway 
County, Arkansas. 
Mary is the longest-serving employee 
of the college, beginning in 1981 as 
extra help and, now, currently serving 
as the assistant to the chancellor. Yet 
after 39 years, her dedication to others 
goes 
far 
beyond 
the 
campus 
in 
Morrilton. 
Her list of community involvement is 
long, including her service as a board 
member of the Morrilton Area Cham-
ber of Commerce, CHI St. Vincent 
Morrilton, 
Conway 
County 
Senior 
Adult Center, and the Conway County 
School Counts. She additionally serves 
as secretary of the Conway County 
branch of the NAACP and as a Sunday 
school teacher at her church. 
Mary always makes you feel so wel-
come. She is a neighbor that everybody 
wants and a citizen that every commu-
nity needs. She has dedicated her life 
to the betterment of others, and I 
thank her for her years of service to 
UA Community College Morrilton and 
central Arkansas. 
RECOGNIZING DIONNE JACKSON 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize 
Dionne Jackson, the executive director 
of AR Kids Read, for striving to im-
prove the literacy of Arkansas chil-
dren. 
Ms. Jackson recognized the impor-
tance of literacy very young, after re-
alizing that a family member could not 
read or write when they signed a docu-
ment with an X rather than sign their 
name. This experience inspires her 
work daily at AR Kids Read. 
Dionne grew up in the Western Hills 
neighborhood of Little Rock and at-
tended Hendrix College in Conway. 
After earning her degree, she became a 
science teacher at her alma mater, 
Horace Mann High School. 
She earned her master’s from the 
University of Central Arkansas and 
went on to earn a Doctorate in Edu-
cation from Baylor University, then 
becoming 
a 
tenured 
professor 
at 
Hendrix. 
As the executive director of AR Kids 
Read, she works every day to further 
their mission to advance the literacy 
education of Arkansas children and 
families with the aim of having stu-
dents read proficiently by the third 
grade. 
Our community is so grateful to her 
dedication for this essential need in 
our area. 
RECOGNIZING DARRELL WALKER 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, as we start a new school year, 
I rise today to recognize the University 
of Arkansas at Little Rock’s men’s bas-
ketball coach, my friend, Darrell Walk-
er, who was named last year’s Sun Belt 
Coach of the Year. 
Coach Walker became the third UA 
Little Rock coach ever to win the 
award, leading the Trojans to one of 
the Nation’s best turnarounds, going 
from a 10–21 record the previous year to 
21–10 this past season. 
That includes a 15–5 record in the 
Sun Belt Conference, on the way to UA 
Little Rock’s first outright league title 
since 2015–2016. 
The spring of pandemic cut short the 
passion of March Madness. The Trojans 
were one of just two teams in Division 
I that finished in 1st place in their con-
ference after being picked 11th or lower 
in the conference preseason. 
Coach Walker’s passion for excel-
lence in leadership and hard work are 
always evident, and he can now add 
Sun Belt Coach of the Year to his long 
list of accolades and career accom-
plishments. 
Good luck to Coach Walker, and good 
luck to the 2020–2021 team. Go Trojans. 
RECOGNIZING DERRICK CLARK 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Der-
rick Clark, who has made Arkansas 
proud with his resilience and his deter-
mination. 
For years, Derrick wrestled with 
drug abuse and homelessness on the 
streets in Little Rock, looking some-
how for a fresh start. He spent time at 
Jericho Way, our Little Rock shelter, 
where he was able to meet people who 
saw his potential. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Clark made 
that slow march to sobriety and self-

sufficiency by working minimum-wage 
jobs until he landed a position with a 
trucking company. Armed with a com-
mercial driver’s license and gainful em-
ployment under his belt, Derrick estab-
lished the Paul Philia Scholarship to 
give others the opportunity to attend 
trucking school. 
Mr. Clark put up the first $1,000 of his 
own money to launch the scholarship, 
and the fund was quickly put with the 
Arkansas Community Foundation. The 
J.C. Thompson Trust has agreed to 
match every dollar donated up to 
$10,000. Mr. Clark is now enrolled in 
college classes and dreams of writing a 
book. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. 
Clark and wish him the best of luck in 
his journey, that journey of the pursuit 
of happiness. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

REMEMBERING CULLAN BROWN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the remarkable 
life led by Mr. Cullan Brown from 
Eddyville, Kentucky. 
Mr. Brown was a student athlete at 
the University of Kentucky where he 
excelled on the golf course. He passed 
away in August at the age of 20 after 
battling a rare form of bone cancer. 
A young man with a love for golf, he 
racked up numerous accomplishments 
over his young career. He won the indi-
vidual Kentucky High School Athletic 
Association State Championship, Lyon 
County’s first State championship in 
any sport. 
Mr. Brown was a highly ranked re-
cruit nationwide in 2018 and could have 
played golf at many different schools, 
but he decided to commit to the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, saying: ‘‘I love 
the State of Kentucky and its people.’’ 
Cullan Brown would go on to have a 
successful freshman year at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, including being 
named to the All-Southeastern Con-
ference freshman team. 
Even more impressive than his suc-
cess on the golf course, friends, coach-
es, and others have widely noted that 
this young man had a love for the peo-
ple around him and impacted many 
lives with his wonderful personality. 
Cancer takes a harsh toll on individ-
uals and families. One life lost to this 
disease is too many. It is critical for 
our Nation to double down on efforts to 
fight cancer, including expanding re-
search efforts aimed at developing ef-
fective treatments and cures. 
Cullan Brown was a force for good 
whose 
courageous 
battle 
inspired 
many. His family and friends continue 
to be in our thoughts and prayers. 
HONORING JEREMY CREASON 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mayfield Fire Depart-
ment Chief Jeremy Creason for re-
cently being named the Kentucky 
League of Cities 2020 City Employee of 
the Year. 
Mr. Creason joined the Mayfield Fire 
Department in Graves County in 2008, 
serving as a firefighter and paramedic. 
He quickly rose through the ranks to 
become chief at the age of 34. 
At a time when essential workers 
have made numerous adjustments to 
serve their communities, Mr. Creason’s 
dedication to Mayfield has been on full 
display. 
When 
personal 
protective 
equipment was scarce, he found some 
for his fellow firefighters to ensure 
they remained safe. This, along with 
other precautions he took, have proven 
to be effective, with no positive cases 
within the Mayfield Fire Department 
personnel. 
In addition to taking good care of his 
staff, Mr. Creason met with local busi-
nesses and churches to advise them on 
capacity seating in their buildings and 
regulations for reopening. His due dili-
gence is a shining example of caring for 
others and taking proper precautions 
to safely reopen. 
I am honored to recognize Jeremy 
Creason for this award and his excel-
lent service and commitment to his 
community.

HONORING NEIGHBORHOOD PET STORES 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the support neighbor-
hood pet stores provide for our local 
communities. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, small 
businesses have been slammed eco-
nomically, 
but 
these 
dire 
cir-
cumstances have provided us with an 
opportunity to raise awareness of the 
tremendous impact local pet stores 
have on our communities. 
As we all know, our animals serve as 
an extension of our families and often 
provide a source of friendship and com-
fort for both adults and children. Dur-
ing the pandemic, that companionship 
has become even more paramount as 
pet owners are spending significantly 
more time with their pets. 
Local pet stores establish personal 
relationships 
with 
the 
community, 
whether those relationships are formed 
through employees providing expert 
advice and helping customers buy the 
correct product for their animals or 
helping to raise money for the local hu-
mane society. 
These small businesses make a huge 
impact on the lives of our animals, and 
they become part of our families’ lives, 
watching the pets grow over the years 
and serving as a go-to resource time 
and time again. 
I join with everyone in honoring the 
extraordinary work neighborhood pet 
stores do to make a difference in our 
pets’ lives. I am honored to represent 
them as they continue to build rela-
tionships throughout the First Con-
gressional District of Kentucky and 
across the United States. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO MARIE GATTON PHILLIPS 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to congratulate Marie Gatton Phillips 
Elementary School in Sacramento, 
Kentucky, for receiving the distinction 
of a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School 
by the U.S. Department of Education. 
The award is based on a school’s over-
all academic performance or progress 
in closing achievement gaps among 
student subgroups. 
I am grateful to the hardworking fac-
ulty and staff at Marie Gatton Phillips 
Elementary School for their commit-
ment to the betterment of their stu-
dents and the local community. Their 
passion for creating a positive and sup-
portive learning environment helps 
each student develop essential aca-
demic and social skills. 
These skills help them succeed both 
inside and outside the classroom, plac-
ing them on a path to become leaders 
in their communities for years to 
come. 
At a time when schools are working 
tirelessly to adjust to present chal-
lenges, I am proud to congratulate you 
all on this terrific achievement. Your 
faculty, staff, and students are very de-
serving of this honor. 
I look forward to continued success 
from Marie Gatton Phillips Elemen-
tary School. All of McLean County, the 
First Congressional District, and the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky should be 
very proud of this recognition. 
HONORING ROGER HOLLOWAY 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Roger Holloway of Hop-
kinsville, Kentucky, a veteran and one 
of the last Buffalo Soldiers alive, who 
is on a mission to keep their legacy 
front and center. 
Mr. Holloway enlisted in the U.S. 
Army in 1950 at the age of 17, serving in 
the Vietnam and Korean wars where he 
rose in the ranks to be named a cor-
poral and squad leader. 
At that time, the all-Black regiment 
was segregated from the general Army 
that would soon be integrated in 1951. 
In 1953, Mr. Holloway took a break 
from service, but soon reenlisted in 
1954 and served in the airborne division 
until his retirement in 1972. 
Mr. Holloway is now on a mission, a 
new mission, spreading the word to 
keep the stories of the Buffalo Soldiers 
alive. 
In 1866, Congress passed the Army Or-
ganization Act, creating the Buffalo 
Soldiers, a unit composed of all Afri-
can-American troops. The Buffalo Sol-
diers mainly helped to protect the 
western frontier after the American 
Civil War and later fought in the Span-
ish-American War and the Korean war. 
The Buffalo Soldiers were a pivotal 
part of our Armed Forces, including 
working to secure the first U.S. victory 
in Korea on July 20, 1950. 
I am honored to share the excep-
tional history of the Buffalo Soldiers 
on the House floor today. Throughout 
decades of service, they provided much- 
needed support, not only for our mili-
tary but for all Americans. I am proud 
of all of their accomplishments.

September 30, 2020 
I am honored to recognize Mr. Hollo-
way and the Buffalo Soldiers for their 
exceptional service to our Nation. I es-
pecially want to thank Mr. Holloway 
for being an exceptional leader in his 
community and the First Congres-
sional District of Kentucky. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO STARFISH ORPHAN 
MINISTRIES 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Starfish Orphan 
Ministries in Paducah, Kentucky, for 
being selected as an Angels in Adoption 
Honoree by the 2020 Congressional Coa-
lition on Adoption Institute. 
The Angels in Adoption program hon-
ors individuals and organizations fo-
cusing on adoptions, permanency, and 
child welfare issues. I was proud to 
nominate this outstanding organiza-
tion for this award, which they have 
gone above and beyond to achieve. 
The Starfish Orphan Ministries sup-
ports children going through the foster 
care and adoption processes, both in 
my district and around the world. 
One 
way 
they 
help 
children 
is 
through Kendra’s Kloset. This program 
serves single-parent households, foster 
parents, and teens aging out of the sys-
tem by providing them with clothing 
and furniture. These and other neces-
sities allow children to become more 
settled in their new home environ-
ments. 
In addition to serving Kentucky chil-
dren, Starfish Ministries has expanded 
the footprint of their ministry through 
international mission trips. They regu-
larly take high school students on mis-
sion trips to Central and South Amer-
ica, giving young people hands-on expo-
sure to community outreach programs, 
which make an extraordinary dif-
ference in countless lives. 
Thanks to their tireless efforts to 
promote the well-being of children, I 
can think of no organization more de-
serving of this recognition. 
Congratulations, again, to Starfish 
Orphan Ministry of Paducah. 
HONORING THE LATE TREVOR GOSSER 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend, the late 
Trevor Gosser from Russell County, 
Kentucky, who tragically passed away 
last month. 
I first met Trevor on Gosser Ridge in 
Russell County when I was out cam-
paigning with farmers. I hired Trevor 
at the Kentucky Department of Agri-
culture when I served as Kentucky’s 
Commissioner of Agriculture. 
He quickly demonstrated a strong 
work ethic and high level of dedication 
to his work. He also became a good 
friend of mine, and I offer heartfelt 
condolences to his family. 
Trevor was a devoted husband, fa-
ther, and employee who was able to get 
along with everyone. 
I join with everyone throughout Rus-
sell County and the First Congres-
sional District of Kentucky in keeping 
his family in our thoughts and prayers. 
HONORING THE LATE TED ROBERTS 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the late Mr. Ted Rob-
erts, a Paducah, Kentucky, whose life 
was dedicated to public service in his 
community. 
Throughout his job at the United 
States Postal Service, Mr. Roberts rose 
through the ranks to become the first 
and only African American to hold the 
position of postmaster for the United 
States Postal Service in this tristate 
region. 
In addition to serving as postmaster, 
he served as a member of the Post-
master General Speaker’s Bureau in 
1991 and a member of the National 
League of Postmasters of the United 
States. 
Mr. Roberts’ community service ex-
tends beyond the Postal Service. He 
was a part of the Paducah mayor’s 
Task Force on Human Rights; commis-
sioner of the Paducah Human Rights 
Commission; vice president of the Pa-
ducah, Kentucky, NAACP chapter; and 
an associate member of the Fraternal 
Order of Police. Throughout these 
roles, Mr. Roberts proved himself to be 
an integral part of his community. 
In addition to serving his commu-
nity, Mr. Roberts served his country in 
the Navy during the Vietnam war. 
I am honored to recognize Mr. Rob-
erts, whose distinguished record of pub-
lic service is remarkable. 
Thank you for being an exceptional 
leader with unparalleled contributions 
to the city of Paducah and all of west 
Kentucky. 
HONORING RICHARD DICKEN 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor Richard Dicken from my 
hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky. 
Richard retired from TVA, where he 
was a well-respected engineer. 
To demonstrate both his work ethic 
and his entrepreneurial spirit, Richard 
began building houses while working 
full time at TVA. 
Upon his retirement from public 
work, Richard returned home to Mon-
roe County and started four credible 
businesses, which employed hundreds 
of people: Dicken Construction, South-
ern 
Kentucky 
Hardwood 
Flooring, 
Country Boy Pellets, and a lumber 
company. 
Richard told people to ‘‘always keep 
busy and work hard for anything and 
everything you want in life.’’ 
Richard Dicken passed away unex-
pectedly last month. He is survived by 
his spouse, Stephanie Dicken, four 
stepchildren, one brother, and two sis-
ters. 
He was a true Monroe County success 
story who will be deeply missed. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the importance of 
ensuring that the Supreme Court, the 
highest court in our land, is armed 
with Justices who will respect our gov-
ernment’s guiding light, the Constitu-
tion. 
There is a reason that my friends on 
the left are so heartbroken by the pos-
sibility of President Trump’s out-
standing nominee to the Supreme 
Court being confirmed. Unfortunately, 
they see judges as lawmakers, not 
merely interpreters of the law, as out-
lined in the Constitution. Any judge 
who rightfully stands in the way of ju-
dicial activism is a barrier to their 
agenda. 
They want policy to be made by 
unelected black robes, not through the 
leaders we elect at the ballot box. 
Democrats’ only hope for forcing fringe 
policies on the American people is for 
judges to sign off on unconstitutional 
executive actions, which we saw Presi-
dent Obama repeatedly pursue as a sub-
stitute for congressional approval. 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an ex-
ceptional nominee who brings a wealth 
of experience from her time in both the 
private sector and on the Federal 
bench. She was confirmed to her cur-
rent position on the Seventh Circuit 
Court of Appeals by a bipartisan vote, 
including with the support of Hillary 
Clinton’s 2016 running mate. Everyone 
who has spent time around her has 
praised her qualifications and devotion 
to the law. 
Additionally, she clerked for the late 
Justice Scalia and has pledged to fol-
low his philosophy of following the 
words of the Constitution, not legis-
lating from the bench. 
Being extremely qualified and de-
voted to the Constitution is apparently 
a red flag for Washington Democrats. 
They are going to desperate lengths to 
stop her confirmation, including at-
tacking her faith and threatening to 
impeach President Trump for following 
his constitutional duty to nominate a 
replacement for the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
The American people put President 
Trump and the Republican Senate in 
charge to nominate and confirm judges 
to the Federal bench. President Trump 
was incredibly transparent about his 
plans, even putting out a list of can-
didates he would choose from. And the 
American people elected him to do just 
that. 
I look forward to seeing the Senate 
fulfill their constitutional duty and 
confirm the President’s very qualified 
and capable nominee. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 17 minutes. 
EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
ABSENTEE VOTING AND MAIL-IN VOTING 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I want 
to conclude by talking about the elec-
tion process that we are about to face. 
Recent news stories from across Amer-
ica highlight the fundamental problem 
with blue States implementing uni-
versal mail-in voting. 
Now, let me explain the difference 
between absentee voting and universal 
mail-in voting. Absentee voting is 
where a registered voter requests a bal-
lot. Universal mail-in voting is where 
everyone on the voter rolls receives 
ballots unsolicited. 
With respect to mail-in voting, we 
have uncertainty, delay, and inaccu-
racy. These are the consequences of the

September 30, 2020 
universal mail-in scheme that threaten 
the integrity of American elections. 
As ranking member of the Oversight 
and Reform Committee, I recently pub-
lished a report, alongside Congressman 
JIM JORDAN, that laid out these threats 
to our elections. Simply put, Democrat 
States are changing the rules in the 
middle of the game. 
There is nothing wrong with absentee 
voting. Absentee voting is a time-hon-
ored tradition where voters request a 
ballot if they are unable to vote in per-
son. Expanded absentee voting is ap-
propriate for those who don’t feel safe 
because of the COVID–19 pandemic. I 
support absentee voting. 
However, blue State Governors have 
taken mail-in voting to a whole new 
level. Their brilliant idea is to mail out 
ballots to everyone on the voter rolls, 
which are notoriously inaccurate. 
b 1945 
They include people who have moved 
and even died, creating a situation ripe 
for fraud as millions of unrequested 
ballots go out to households. Who lives 
in those households? We don’t know. 
Look no further than my home State 
of Kentucky, where former Secretary 
of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was 
sued for the State’s failure to maintain 
accurate voter registration lists. 
And just yesterday, New York City 
announced that they would be re-
sending nearly 100,000 absentee ballots 
out due to a printing error just a 
month before the election. 
This raises numerous questions: How 
many of these ballots were already 
cast? Will votes in New York count 
twice? Do these ballots even have to be 
postmarked? 
The fact that we are even asking 
these 
questions 
raises fundamental 
concerns with the integrity of the up-
coming election. 
Another concern is the flurry of late 
ballots we will see after election day. It 
is a disgrace to our electoral system 
that we are allowing ballots to be 
counted for days after the November 3 
election. Shame on the States that are 
allowing this to happen, including Ken-
tucky. 
Ballots received after election day is 
a disaster waiting to happen. If you 
vote by mail, then do it now, or at 
least by October 15 or October 20 to en-
sure that it has time to arrive by elec-
tion day. 
We know what the consequences of 
ballots accumulating in the days and 
weeks after election day will be. Look 
no further than a recent New York pri-
mary, where Governor Cuomo’s shift to 
mail-in voting led to absolute chaos. 
Election officials disqualified thou-
sands of ballots for not having timely 
postmarks, and the election wasn’t cer-
tified for 6 weeks. 
The surest guarantee of election in-
tegrity is for Americans to vote in per-
son where safe and possible. Even Dr. 
Fauci has declared in-person voting to 
be safe. This method comes with 
knowledgeable workers, identity verifi-
cation, and secure ballot submission 
practices. These safeguards will mini-
mize any delay in election results and 
ensure the integrity of the outcome. 
I wish Congress could come together 
to have universal voting standards for 
what will be a Presidential race that, 
by all accounts, will come down to the 
wire. 
Ballots should be received by elec-
tion day, and if we can’t agree on that, 
then surely we can agree that ballots 
that are received after election day 
have to be postmarked. 
There are States that are coming out 
with new guidance that say ballots re-
ceived after election day don’t even 
have to be postmarked. Are you kid-
ding me? 
We have to come together on this be-
fore we leave. We have to come to-
gether to ensure the integrity of our 
elections. 
Madam Speaker, that concludes my 
remarks, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO THE

RELIANCE 
ON 
CRITICAL 
MIN-

SARIES AND SUPPORTING THE 
DOMESTIC 
MINING 
AND 
PROC-
ESSING 
INDUSTRIES—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116– 
155) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United 
States Code, I hereby report that I 
have issued an Executive Order declar-
ing a national emergency to deal with 
the threat posed by our Nation’s undue 
reliance on critical minerals, in proc-
essed or unprocessed form, from foreign 
adversaries. 
A strong America cannot be depend-
ent on imports from foreign adver-
saries for the critical minerals that are 
increasingly necessary to maintain our 
economic and military strength in the 
21st century. Because of the national 
importance of reliable access to crit-
ical minerals, I signed Executive Order 
13817 of December 20, 2017 (A Federal 
Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reli-
able Supplies of Critical Minerals), 
which required the Secretary of the In-
terior to identify critical minerals and 
made it the policy of the Federal Gov-
ernment ‘‘to reduce the Nation’s vul-
nerability to disruptions in the supply 
of critical minerals.’’ The critical min-
erals identified by the Secretary of the 
Interior are necessary inputs for the 
products our military, national infra-
structure, and economy depend on the 
most. Our country needs critical min-
erals to make airplanes, computers, 
cell phones, electricity generation and 
transmission systems, and advanced 
electronics. 
Though these minerals are indispen-
sable to our country, we presently lack 
the capacity to produce them in proc-
essed form in the quantities we need. 
American producers depend on foreign 
countries to supply and process them. 
Whereas the United States recognizes 
the continued importance of coopera-
tion on supply chain issues with inter-
national partners and allies, in many 
cases, the aggressive economic prac-
tices of certain non-market foreign 
producers of critical minerals have de-
stroyed vital mining and manufac-
turing jobs in the United States. We 
must reduce our vulnerability to ad-
verse foreign government action, nat-
ural disaster, or other supply disrup-
tions. Our national security, foreign 
policy, and economy require a con-
sistent supply of each of these min-
erals. 
Using the authority vested in me by 
IEEPA, the Executive Order requires 
the Secretary of the Interior, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of Commerce, and the heads 
of other executive departments and 
agencies, as appropriate, to investigate 
our Nation’s undue reliance on critical 
minerals, in processed or unprocessed 
form, from foreign adversaries. Fol-
lowing this investigation, the Execu-
tive Order requires the Secretary of the 
Interior to submit a report to the 
President recommending additional ex-
ecutive action. 
The Executive Order also declares 
that it is the policy of the United 
States to protect and expand the do-
mestic supply chain for minerals. Spe-
cific executive department and agency 
heads, including the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Energy, 
are directed to take various actions to 
protect and expand the domestic sup-
ply chain for minerals, consistent with 
applicable law, such as the publication 
of guidance, the revision of regula-
tions, and the acceleration of the 
issuance of permits. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

S5899 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 
No. 169—Part II 
Senate 
(Legislative day of Tuesday, September 29, 2020) 
The Senate met at 12 noon, on the ex-
piration of the recess, and was called to 
order by the President pro tempore 
(Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, we praise You with 
our whole hearts. We refuse to forget 
how You have led our Nation in the 
past and trust You to guard our future. 
Lord, encourage our lawmakers to be 
a part of Your solutions and not a part 
of the problems that confront our land. 
Give them the courage to carry on 
knowing that nothing is too difficult 
for Your sovereign might. 
May the light of Your truth illu-
minate their way as they find in You a 
sure guide. Help them to commit their 
lives to those that will cause justice to 
roll down like waters and righteous-
ness like a mighty stream. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
to speak for 1 minute as in morning 
business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
night, former Vice President Biden said 
that President Trump ‘‘hasn’t lowered 
drug prices for anybody.’’ This is false, 
and I hope that the news media will 
call out Mr. Biden for the lie. 
Among several other actions, Presi-
dent Trump launched an initiative to 
lower the out-of-pocket costs of insulin 
for seniors through the Part D Med-
icaid-Medicare Program. Also, Presi-
dent Trump recently signed an Execu-
tive order that will launch several pro-
grams to lower drug costs and help sen-
iors afford their medicines. 
More disingenuous than this claim 
from Mr. Biden is that it was actually 
the Vice President’s former Demo-
cratic colleagues here in the Senate 
who walked away from the negotiating 
table and killed any hope of passing 
legislation to lower prescription drug 
costs before the election. This was an 
effort by Minority Leader SCHUMER and 
his Democratic colleagues to hurt 
President Trump and Senate Repub-
licans. Mr. Biden seems content to cap-
italize on his own party’s obstructions. 
Now, I have come to expect election- 
year partisan politics such as I have 
just described it, but during a pan-
demic that has left hundreds of thou-
sands dead and millions unemployed, it 
is particularly egregious that Demo-
crats have decided it is more important 
to hurt Republicans than help Ameri-
cans. I am sorry to say this is the truth 
of the matter. 
It will be up to Democrats to make it 
right. I am not holding my breath, but 
I do hope voters hold accountable a 
party that failed in its basic duty to 
put people ahead of politics. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Ma-
jority Leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senators who are sitting 
down with Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
are meeting an incredibly impressive 
jurist and highly qualified nominee. 
They are hearing from the professor 
whom former colleagues call ‘‘mind- 
blowingly intelligent,’’ ‘‘one of the 
most humble people you’re going to 
meet,’’ and ‘‘the complete package.’’ 
They are meeting a law school valedic-
torian and award-winning academic 
whom peers praise for her ‘‘lucid, ele-
gant prose,’’ ‘‘piercing’’ legal analysis, 
and ‘‘absolute dedication to the rule of 
law.’’ 
Senators are meeting the distin-
guished circuit judge whom the liberal 
law professor Noah Feldman says is ‘‘a 
brilliant and conscientious lawyer’’ 
who is ‘‘highly qualified to serve on the 
Supreme Court.’’ 
Some of our Democratic colleagues 
have decided they will refuse to meet 
with Judge Barrett. Several have vol-
unteered their votes will have nothing 
to do with her qualifications, as though 
that were something to be proud of. 
The Democratic leader says: ‘‘It’s not 
her qualifications.’’ The junior Senator 
from Delaware says: ‘‘This isn’t about 
her qualifications.’’ 
Certainly, every Senator may define 
‘‘advice and consent’’ how they wish, 
but I think it is telling to see Senate 
Democrats openly affirming that Judge 
Barrett’s actual judicial qualifications 
do not matter to them. Our friends on 
the left really do mistake the Court as 
an unelected superlegislature. They are 
not interested in Judge Barrett’s legal 
qualifications 
because 
they 
think

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5900 
September 30, 2020 
judges are there to dictate policy out-
comes rather than following the facts 
and text wherever they lead. 
That is why we have had the same 
scare tactics for almost half a century. 
John Paul Stevens was going to end 
women’s rights. David Souter was 
going to send vulnerable people into 
the Dark Ages. John Roberts was going 
to declare war on health insurance. 
And now our Democratic colleagues 
want Americans to believe Judge Bar-
rett is on a one-woman crusade to hurt 
Americans with preexisting conditions. 
One Senator has literally claimed the 
nominee would—listen to this—‘‘create 
a humanitarian catastrophe.’’ 
They are the same old scare tactics, 
totally predictable and totally dis-
honest. 
These 
baseless 
attacks 
over 
healthcare are supposedly founded on a 
technical argument in a 4-year-old 
scholarly article. Then-Professor Bar-
rett analyzed the Supreme Court’s rul-
ing on one piece of ObamaCare—the un-
fair, 
unpopular 
individual 
mandate 
penalty, which we have since zeroed 
out. The constitutional arguments over 
whether that terrible idea was a ‘‘pen-
alty’’ or a ‘‘tax’’ are now moot because, 
whatever you want to call it, Repub-
licans in Congress zeroed it out 3 years 
ago. Working Americans are no longer 
penalized by that Democrat policy. 
Americans with preexisting conditions 
are still protected and that specific 
legal question is moot. 
Our Democratic colleagues are grasp-
ing at straws. Now they want Judge 
Barrett to promise to recuse herself 
from whole categories of cases. Of 
course, that is ridiculous. It is hard to 
think of anyone in the country over 
whom a President has less leverage 
than a judge with a lifetime appoint-
ment. 
Nobody 
suggested 
Justice 
Sotomayor or Justice Kagan needed to 
categorically sit on the sidelines until 
President Obama left office. This is 
just a backdoor attempt to impugn 
Judge Barrett’s integrity. 
If Senators believe this nominee is 
committed to impartial justice in 
every case, if they believe she will 
mean her oath when she takes it, they 
should vote to confirm her. If they 
don’t, they should vote no. 
But only one of these arguments has 
any basis in Judge Barrett’s resume, 
her reputation, and the praise that has 
been showered on her jurisprudence 
even by famous liberal lawyers. 
Judge Barrett has already stated in 
writing to the Senate that she has 
given nobody in the White House any 
hints or any assurances about any kind 
of cases, real or hypothetical. It is only 
Senate Democrats who are trying to 
extract promises and precommitments. 
It is only Democrats who are trying to 
undermine judicial independence. 
Last night on national television, 
former Vice President Biden refused to 
rule out the radical notion of packing 
the Supreme Court. He ducked the 
question. In Washington, when you 
duck the question, you know what the 
answer is. That is exactly what they 
are up to. That is exactly what they in-
tend to do. 
Last year, our colleague Senator 
HARRIS
said explicitly that she was 
open to it. That is another way of say-
ing that is what they intend to do. Nu-
merous of our colleagues have refused 
to rule out this radical institution- 
shattering step. 
Now Senate Democrats are trying to 
make Judge Barrett precommit to han-
dle hypothetical issues the way they 
want—more 
disrespect 
for 
judicial 
independence. 
Judge Barrett understands a judge’s 
only loyalty must be to our laws and 
our Constitution. She understands our 
system would collapse if judges do not 
leave politics aside. If the Democratic 
Party feels differently, if Democrats 
have decided that judicial independ-
ence is simply an inconvenience to 
their radical agenda, it shows how lit-
tle weight we should afford their criti-
cisms of this outstanding nominee. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. If Senate Demo-
crats were half as concerned as they 
say about America’s family healthcare, 
they would not have filibustered a 
multihundred-billion-dollar 
proposal 
for more coronavirus relief just a few 
weeks ago. 
A Senate minority that was focused 
on America’s health would have let us 
fund more tests, treatments, and vac-
cine development, like Republicans 
tried to do just a few weeks ago. A Sen-
ate minority that was prioritizing 
wellness would have let us spend more 
than $100 billion to make schools safe 
for students, like Republicans tried to 
do just a few weeks ago. A Senate mi-
nority that sought to protect citizens 
with preexisting conditions would have 
let us reaffirm legal protections for 
those Americans, like Republicans had 
in our bill just a few weeks ago. A Sen-
ate minority that was serious about 
economic recovery would have let us 
fund a second round of the Paycheck 
Protection Program and continued the 
expanded unemployment checks, like 
Republicans tried to do just a few 
weeks ago. 
The Senate voted on all of this 3 
weeks ago. Three weeks ago, every sin-
gle Senator cast a vote on preexisting 
conditions, money for testing, money 
for vaccines, money for safe schools, 
money for small businesses, and money 
for unemployed workers—just 3 weeks 
ago. Fifty-two Republicans voted to 
pass all of these policies and every sin-
gle Democrat who showed up voted to 
filibuster it dead. 
The 
Democratic 
leader 
and 
the 
Speaker of the House were determined 
that American families should not see 
another dime before the election. This 
week, Speaker PELOSI is finally caving 
to months of pressure from fellow 
Democrats 
who 
argue 
that 
her 
stonewalling is hurting our country. 
House Democrats are trying to save 
face by introducing yet another multi-
trillion-dollar far-left wish list with 
virtually all the same non-COVID-re-
lated 
poison 
pills 
as 
their 
last 
unserious bill. 
Speaker PELOSI’s latest offering still 
does not include a single cent of new 
money toward the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program to help small businesses 
that are going under. It does nothing to 
help 
schools, 
universities, 
doctors, 
nurses, or employers avoid frivolous 
lawsuits. But the House did find room 
to provide special treatment to the 
marijuana industry. Their bill men-
tions the word ‘‘cannabis’’ more times 
than the words ‘‘job’’ or ‘‘jobs.’’ 
They still want to send taxpayer- 
funded stimulus checks to people in 
our country illegally. They still want 
to hand a massively expensive tax cut 
to millionaires and billionaires in 
places like New York City and San 
Francisco, a pet priority of the Speak-
er and the Democratic leader that 
would do nothing to help working fami-
lies through this pandemic. 
All of these far-left poison pills are 
still in their recycled bill. They have 
no intention of making bipartisan law 
for American families, but there are a 
few changes from the last bill. 
So get this. Now that supporting law 
enforcement has become less than fash-
ionable on the far left, the Democrats 
have actually taken out hundreds of 
millions of dollars for hiring and as-
sisting police officers. Let me say that 
again. In this latest version, there were 
at least some changes. Now that sup-
porting law enforcement has become 
less than fashionable on the far left, 
the Democrats have actually taken out 
hundreds of millions of dollars for hir-
ing and assisting police officers. Their 
so-called sequel to the Heroes Act has 
decided that cops are not heroes after 
all. Apparently, cops are not heroes 
after 
all. 
The 
House 
Democrats 
couldn’t miss a chance to defund the 
police. 
This latest bill from the Speaker is 
no more serious than any of their other 
political stunts going back months. If 
they continue to refuse to get serious, 
then American families will continue 
to hurt. Less than a month ago, every 
single Senator voted on providing hun-
dreds of billions of dollars for kids, 
jobs, healthcare, and reaffirming pro-
tections for preexisting conditions. 
There were 52 Republicans who voted 
to advance all of these things, but 
every single Democrat who showed up 
voted to block them. 
The American people are still hurt-
ing. The layoffs are still mounting. 
Families still need more help, and the 
healthcare fight needs more resources. 
One side voted to supply all of that 
help. The other side decided to block it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night, President Trump delivered one 
of the most disgraceful performances 
at a Presidential debate that anyone 
has ever seen, and I do not mean that 
from a political perspective; I mean it 
from a human perspective. 
One can become inured to the Presi-
dent’s tendency to melt down when 
confronted with his facts, his brazen 
lack of self-awareness, his stunning 
lack of regard for others, but it was 
maddening to watch the President last 
night—angry 
and 
small—unable 
to 
show a scintilla of respect, unable to 
follow even the most basic rules of 
human civility or decorum, unwilling 
to constrain a stream of obvious false-
hoods and rightwing bile. 
Shakespeare summed up in ‘‘Mac-
beth’’ 
Trump’s 
performance 
last 
night—‘‘a tale told by an idiot, full of 
sound and fury, signifying nothing.’’ 
Yes, President Trump’s debate per-
formance was, in the words of ‘‘Mac-
beth,’’ a tale told by an idiot, full of 
sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
In an hour and a half that felt like a 
lifetime, the President managed to in-
sult Vice President Biden’s deceased 
son and smear his living one, please a 
fringe White supremacist group, and 
cap the night off by, yet again, casting 
doubt on our own elections—tarnishing 
our own democracy. Those were just 
his worst moments. The rest of the de-
bate saw the President heap lies upon 
lies—lies big and small and every size 
in between. This President and truth 
don’t intersect at all. 
Still, one moment stands out. When 
asked to condemn White supremacist 
groups like the Proud Boys—classified 
as a hate group by the Southern Pov-
erty Law Center and called ‘‘hard-core 
white supremacists’’ by the Anti-Defa-
mation League—President Trump de-
murred and then said: ‘‘Proud Boys, 
stand back and stand by.’’ 
‘‘Stand back and stand by.’’ 
President Obama once wondered rhe-
torically: ‘‘How hard is it to say Nazis 
are bad?’’ 
Apparently, for President Trump, it 
is beyond his capacity. In a national 
debate, he not only refused to condemn 
a far-right group of violent White su-
premacists, but he told them to stand 
by. 
As much of the country was in de-
spair last night at the President’s juve-
nile behavior, one group was cele-
brating—the Proud Boys. They are who 
were celebrating President Trump’s de-
bate performance—White supremacists. 
Within minutes of the President’s com-
ments, the Proud Boys were online, re-
joicing at the tacit endorsement of 
their violent tactics by the President 
himself. They made logos out of the 
President’s remarks: ‘‘Stand back and 
stand by.’’ 
I just want to ask my Republican col-
leagues: How are you not embarrassed 
that President Trump represents your 
party? How can you possibly—pos-
sibly—support anyone who behaves 
this way? Are you watching the same 
person we are? Are you listening? Are 
you not embarrassed that millions of 
Americans watched President Trump 
and thought: ‘‘That is what the Repub-
lican Party stands for now’’? 
He can’t express sympathy for the 
families of 200,000 Americans who have 
died from COVID; can’t go 30 seconds 
without interrupting someone when he 
is not speaking; can’t refrain from at-
tacking someone’s family and pre-
tending not to know a person’s de-
ceased son; can’t honor the military, 
defend democracy, respect elections, or 
tell the truth; can’t even make it 
through a debate without emboldening 
White supremacists. 
How are you, my Senate colleagues, 
not deeply, utterly, personally embar-
rassed that Donald Trump is a Repub-
lican? How are we not all embarrassed 
that someone who behaved the way 
President Trump did last night is our 
President? I know I am. How about 
you? 
Again, this President is just amazing, 
and his speech last night—‘‘a tale told 
by an idiot, full of sound and fury, sig-
nifying nothing.’’ 
f 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
SCOTUS, it is for this President that 
Senate Republicans are now rushing 
through a Supreme Court nominee 
nearly days before a national election. 
A Republican majority that once ar-
gued the American people should be 
given a voice in the selection of their 
next Supreme Court Justice is plan-
ning to confirm a nominee in the mid-
dle of an election that is already under-
way. You could not design a scenario 
that would more fully expose the Re-
publicans’ double standard than this 
one. Of greater concern to the Amer-
ican people is how the rush by Senate 
Republicans to confirm this nominee 
will put their healthcare at risk. 
Now, yesterday, the Republican lead-
er actually mocked the idea that a far- 
right Supreme Court majority might 
strike down the ACA and that Judge 
Barrett’s judicial philosophy might 
play a part in that. ‘‘What a joke,’’ 
Senator MCCONNELL said, that Justice 
Barrett might pose any risk to Ameri-
cans’ healthcare. 
I guess Judge Barrett must have been 
joking when she publicly criticized 
Justice Roberts for upholding the Af-
fordable Care Act. It must have been 
with a sarcastic flick of the pen when 
she wrote that the Supreme Court 
would ‘‘have had to invalidate’’ the law 
if it had read the statute the way she 
does. 
I will tell you what: This is not a 
joke to the American people. This is 
not a joke to the 20 million Americans 
who could lose their health insurance if 
the ACA is struck down—not a joke to 
the parents of a child who has cancer 
and who would have to watch help-
lessly as their child suffers if the pro-
tections for preexisting conditions are 
struck down; not a joke to the millions 
of Americans on Medicare, whose drug 
prices would soar; not a joke to women 
across the country who could, once 
again, be charged more for health in-
surance than men, denied maternity 
care, and free access to birth control. 
The only joke here is the Republican 
leader’s desperate attempt to pretend 
that his President, his party, and their 
Supreme Court nominee pose no threat 
to our Nation’s healthcare law—the 
same Senate leader who did everything 
he could on the floor of this Senate to 
repeal the ACA. 
President Trump said he will pick 
Supreme Court nominees who will 
‘‘terminate the Affordable Care Act.’’ 
His administration is in court right 
now, suing to eliminate it. Senate Re-
publicans tried to repeal the law and 
replace it with nothing. The Repub-
licans’ lawsuit against the Affordable 
Care Act will be heard by the Supreme 
Court during the week after the elec-
tion. There is a reason the Republicans 
are scrambling to fill this seat so 
quickly, and Judge Barrett, when the 
ACA was challenged in major litiga-
tion, 
twice 
before—twice—sided 
against the law. 
So, if the Republican leader believes 
that the Democrats are raising un-
founded fears about healthcare, will he 
urge the plaintiffs to drop their lawsuit 
against the ACA? Will Leader MCCON-
NELL urge the Justice Department not 
to spend taxpayer dollars in trying to 
eliminate the taxpayers’ healthcare? 
Normally these questions would be 
rhetorical, but yesterday I filed a pro-
cedural motion that will set up a vote 
on a bill that would protect the 
healthcare of hundreds of millions of 
Americans and prevent efforts by the 
Department 
of 
Justice—Donald 
Trump’s Department of Justice—to ad-
vocate that courts strike down the Af-
fordable Care Act. Leader MCCONNELL 
and all of my Republican colleagues 
will have to vote on that shortly. Let 
me repeat. Leader MCCONNELL and all 
of my Republican colleagues will have 
to vote very soon on whether the Sen-
ate should consider a bill to protect 
Americans with preexisting conditions. 
With that vote, we will see just how 
much of a joke it is that Senate Repub-
licans and their Supreme Court nomi-
nees want to eliminate Americans’ 
healthcare. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Satur-
day the President announced his nomi-
nee to fill the Supreme Court seat left 
vacant by Justice Ginsburg. As the Na-
tion mourns the death of this trail-
blazing Justice, it is fitting that the 
President chose an outstanding woman 
to replace her. 
I had the pleasure of sitting down 
with Judge Amy Coney Barrett yester-
day, and I can say with confidence that 
she is everything you would want in a 
Supreme Court Justice. 
She is supremely qualified. Like Jus-
tice Ginsburg, Judge Barrett was first 
in her class in law school—in this case, 
at Notre Dame. She was a clerk for DC 
Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman 
and then for Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia. 
She worked at a prestigious law firm 
and served as a visiting professor at 
the George Washington University Law 
School before accepting a position at 
the University of Notre Dame Law 
School, where she went on to teach for 
15 years. 
During her time at Notre Dame, 
Judge Barrett built a distinguished 
record. She was published repeatedly in 
prominent law journals and was chosen 
by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve 
on the Advisory Committee for the 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
She was elected Distinguished Pro-
fessor of the Year by the law school’s 
graduating class three times. 
She also served as a visiting asso-
ciate professor at another prominent 
law school, the University of Virginia 
School of Law. 
In 2017, she moved to the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 
winning Senate confirmation in a bi-
partisan vote. During her confirmation 
to the Seventh Circuit, support for 
Judge Barrett poured forth from her 
students, colleagues, and peers from 
both side of the aisle. 
Every one of the Supreme Court 
clerks who had served with Judge Bar-
rett during her clerkship with Justice 
Scalia wrote a letter to the then-chair-
man and ranking member of the Judi-
ciary Committee expressing their sup-
port for her confirmation. This in-
cluded Justice Ginsburg’s clerks and 
other clerks from the liberal wing of 
the Court. 
Here is what they had to say: 
We are Democrats, Republicans, and inde-
pendents, and we have diverse points of view 
on politics, judicial philosophy, and much 
else. Yet we all write to support the nomina-
tion of Professor Barrett to be a Circuit 
Judge on the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Seventh Circuit. Professor Barrett is 
a woman of remarkable intellect and char-
acter. She is eminently qualified for the job. 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
colleagues 
from 
Notre Dame sent a similar letter. They 
said: 
Amy Coney Barrett will be an exceptional 
federal judge. . . . As a scholarly commu-
nity, we have a wide range of political views, 
as well as commitments to different ap-
proaches to judicial methodology and judi-
cial craft. We are united, however, in our 
judgment about Amy. She is a brilliant 
teacher and scholar, and a warm and gen-
erous colleague. She possess in abundance all 
of the other qualities that shape extraor-
dinary jurists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, 
impeccable temperament, and above all, fun-
damental decency and humanity. 
That letter was signed by every full- 
time member of the Notre Dame Law 
School faculty—every full-time mem-
ber. 
Four hundred seventy Notre Dame 
Law graduates, former students of 
Judge Barrett, sent a letter as well. 
Here is what they said: 
Our backgrounds and life experiences are 
varied and diverse. Our legal practices are as 
varied as the profession itself. . . . Our reli-
gious, cultural, and political views span a 
wide spectrum. Despite the many and gen-
uine differences among us, we are united in 
our conviction that Professor Barrett would 
make an exceptional federal judge. 
They went on: 
We are convinced that Professor Barrett 
would bring to the federal bench the same in-
telligence, fairness, decency, generosity, and 
hard work she has demonstrated at Notre 
Dame Law School. She will treat each liti-
gant with respect and care, conscious of the 
reality that judicial decisions greatly affect 
the lives of those before the court. And she 
will apply the law faithfully and impartially. 
I could go on for a while here. There 
are a lot of tributes to Amy Coney Bar-
rett out there, like the one in support 
of her circuit court nomination that 
was joined by former Obama Solicitor 
General Neal Katyal, which praised her 
‘‘first-rate’’ qualifications and stated 
that she was ‘‘exceptionally well quali-
fied’’ or the recent tribute from Har-
vard law professor Noah Feldman, one 
of the House Democrats’ star impeach-
ment witnesses, who stated: ‘‘Barrett 
is highly qualified to serve on the Su-
preme Court.’’ But I will stop here be-
cause I think it is abundantly obvious 
to everyone—my colleagues across the 
aisle included—that Judge Barrett is 
supremely qualified to be a Supreme 
Court Justice, which is why Democrats 
have resorted to scare tactics to try to 
sink her nomination. 
Democrats realize that it is pretty 
hard to oppose Judge Barrett on the 
merits, and they seem at least some-
what wary of attacking her religion, as 
they did during her confirmation hear-
ing to the Seventh Circuit, when mul-
tiple Democrats suggested that Judge 
Barrett was unqualified because she 
happened to be a practicing Catholic. I 
think Democrats may be realizing that 
their bias against religious people 
doesn’t play well with the millions of 
Americans who take their faith seri-
ously. 
They may also be remembering that 
the Constitution explicitly forbids— 
forbids—religious tests for public of-
fice, although I will note that that 
didn’t stop one of the Democratic Pres-
idential candidate’s advisers from say-
ing just this week that she doesn’t 
think that orthodox Catholics, Mus-
lims, or Jews should sit on the Su-
preme Court. That is right—in this 
Biden adviser’s world, taking your reli-
gious faith seriously should disqualify 
you from sitting on the Supreme 
Court. 
Apparently 
Democrats 
still 
don’t 
think that people of faith are capable 
of upholding the Constitution or dis-
charging the duties of their office. But, 
again, it seems the Democrats realize 
that offending millions of religious 
Americans may not be their best strat-
egy, so they have turned to healthcare 
scare tactics. 
Judge Barrett, Democrats say, will 
take away Americans’ healthcare if she 
is confirmed to the Supreme Court. It 
is actually a very old Democratic 
line—something that they always use 
in their playbook. 
It was deployed, if you can believe 
this, against Justice Kennedy when he 
was a Supreme Court nominee back in 
1986. 
It 
was 
deployed 
against 
Justice 
Souter, a Republican nominee, who be-
came known for siding with the liberal 
wing of the Court. There were lots of 
posters at the time that said things 
like ‘‘Stop Souter or women will die.’’ 
‘‘He will jeopardize the health and lives 
of Americans,’’ it was said by the left 
at the time. 
It was deployed against Justice Rob-
erts—the very same man who cast the 
deciding vote upholding the Affordable 
Care Act—when he was Chief Justice 
on the Supreme Court. They said at the 
time that there would literally be mil-
lions of American consumers and fami-
lies at risk of losing their coverage. 
That statement was made by a Member 
of the current leadership here in the 
U.S. Senate about Chief Justice Rob-
erts. 
Now it is being deployed against 
Judge Barrett in an attempt to derail 
her nomination, while promulgating 
one of the liberals’ favorite myths— 
that Republicans are eagerly waiting 
to rip away Americans’ healthcare. 
Democrats are particularly focused 
on suggesting that Republicans would 
like to take away protections for pre-
existing conditions, despite the fact, I 
might add, that every single Senate 
Republican supports protecting people 
with preexisting conditions—every sin-
gle Senate Republican. In fact, just a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5903 
September 30, 2020 
few weeks ago, Republicans included 
language 
affirming 
protections 
for 
those with preexisting conditions in 
our COVID relief bill—a bill that 
Democrats filibustered. 
It is both ridiculous and offensive to 
suggest that Judge Barrett, the mom 
of seven children—more than one of 
whom has faced medical challenges—is 
out 
to 
eliminate 
Americans’ 
healthcare. 
The truth is, we have no idea how 
Judge Barrett would vote on any par-
ticular healthcare case, just as we have 
no idea how any Supreme Court Jus-
tice 
will 
vote 
on 
any 
particular 
healthcare case. How could we? How 
could we? Each case is unique, with 
unique legal and constitutional issues. 
What we can say with certainty about 
Judge Barrett is that she will carefully 
consider each case. She will consider 
the facts of the case, the law, and the 
Constitution, and she will rule based 
on those things regardless of her per-
sonal feelings or beliefs. 
As Judge Barrett noted in her speech 
accepting the President’s nomination, 
‘‘A judge must apply the law as writ-
ten. Judges are not policymakers, and 
they must be resolute in setting aside 
any policy views that they might 
hold.’’ That is the kind of Justice that 
Judge Barrett would be, and that is the 
kind of Justice that all of us, Democrat 
or Republican, should want—someone 
who will protect the principles of jus-
tice and equality under the law by 
judging according to the law and the 
Constitution and nothing else; someone 
who will leave her personal beliefs at 
the courtroom door; someone who will, 
as Judge Barrett said last week, 
quoting the judicial oath, ‘‘administer 
justice without respect to persons, do 
equal right to the poor and rich, and 
faithfully and impartially discharge 
my duties under the United States.’’ 
One of the reasons I ran for the Sen-
ate was to help put judges like Amy 
Coney Barrett on the bench. I com-
mend the President for his outstanding 
choice, and I look forward to sup-
porting her nomination as the Senate 
moves forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
night former Vice President Biden re-
fused to rule out packing the Court if 
the President and the Senate proceed 
to fulfilling their constitutional duties 
and filling the High Court vacancy. 
I understand there are differences of 
opinion on the direction of the Court, 
but threatening to expand the Court 
and pack it with favorable Justices 
just because the other side won fair 
and square and simply followed the 
Constitution does not meet the com-
monsense test. 
This is dangerous territory and leads 
to an erosion of public faith in the judi-
ciary. Where would such a path lead 
us? Thirteen Justices? Maybe 21 Jus-
tices? At what point does it stop? 
I thought we settled this under FDR, 
way back in 1937–1938. It is telling that 
Democrats are not trying to justify 
their discussion of Court packing by 
saying there is some practical reason 
why it is needed. 
In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing 
fewer cases than ever. Any Democratic 
Court-packing plan would be nothing 
more than a naked power grab, an ef-
fort by Democrats to subvert the will 
of the people when they couldn’t get 
the results they wanted at the ballot 
box that would have let their party 
pick and confirm judges. 
Let’s try to remain focused on the 
political independence of the judiciary 
and leave politicking to this branch of 
government—the legislative branch. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The assistant Democratic leader 
is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Iowa who just spoke is my 
friend. We have worked on things to-
gether. We, occasionally, don’t see eye- 
to-eye on issues. I certainly don’t see 
eye-to-eye with him on what he just 
said on the floor of the Senate. It 
would be credible if, 4 years ago, ex-
actly the opposite result had not been 
produced by the Republican majority. 
Remember, 
4 
years 
ago, 
Antonin 
Scalia’s untimely death on a hunting 
trip, and there was a vacancy on the 
Supreme Court, in February, if I re-
member correctly? There was the ques-
tion as to whether the incumbent 
President, duly elected, of the United 
States of America, Barack Obama, 
would be able to fill the Supreme Court 
vacancy? 
But, no, the Republicans insisted 
that was unacceptable—unacceptable 
for this lame duck President with only 
a year left in his term to fill the va-
cancy on the Supreme Court. No, they 
had a more constitutional idea. Their 
constitutional idea was to delay filling 
the vacancy on the Supreme Court 
until the American people spoke in an 
election in November of the same year. 
So when President Obama sent his 
nominee, Merrick Garland, eminently 
qualified, to be considered by the Sen-
ate, Senator MCCONNELL instructed his 
membership: We are not only going to 
refuse him a hearing; I am going to 
refuse him even a meeting in my office. 
I will not dignify—will not dignify—the 
nomination of Merrick Garland to fill 
the Supreme Court vacancy, because— 
Senator MCCONNELL told us in his gold-
en rule—the American people have to 
speak in the election about the next 
President, who will then fill the va-
cancy. 
That was the hard and fast rule that 
every Republican Senator swore alle-
giance to on the floor of the Senate, be-
fore the microphones and cameras, and 
said: That is the way it is going to be. 
It may be rude. It may be crude to even 
ignore this man who is eminently 
qualified to be the nominee of Presi-
dent Barack Obama, but that is the 
way it is going to be, because we are so 
committed to the Constitution that we 
will not fill the vacancy on the Su-
preme Court until after the election. 
And then came the epiphany—a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court with a Re-
publican President, Donald Trump, oc-
curring in the last year of his Presi-
dency in his first term—maybe his only 
term—and the decision then by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL in the name of the 
Constitution 
to 
completely 
reverse 
himself and to say: We will not fill the 
vacancy in the way we did 4 years ago. 
We will fill it the way we want to fill 
it now, and the way we want to fill it 
now is immediately, on a quicker time-
table than virtually any person who 
has been appointed to the Supreme 
Court for a lifetime appointment, the 
highest Court in the land. 
There was a time, as a member of the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
that 
after hearing the nominee’s name you 
waited for the reports. Many of them 
would come to you, talking about the 
biography of the nominee, the back-
ground of the nominee, the writings, 
the speeches, the articles, and, if they 
were judges, their judicial opinions. We 
would carefully study those and be pre-
pared when it came time for a hearing. 
Not in this situation, no way—Sen-
ator MCCONNELL wants this done and 
done now. He clearly has doubts in his 
own mind as to whether this President 
can be reelected, and he is not going to 
waste his time. He is going to make 
sure the Senate Judiciary Committee 
acts before the election on November 3. 
The hard and fast principle of 4 years 
ago has disappeared with President 
Trump. 
I have watched Republican Senator 
after Republican Senator, with only 
two exceptions, march before the cam-
era and look at their shoes and say: I 
changed my mind. We are going to fill 
this vacancy now. Because of the Con-
stitution? No, because politically it 
helps us. 
Why the hurry? Why before Novem-
ber 3? Why wouldn’t they at least wait 
until the end of November? 
No, the hurry is obvious, because on 
November 10, the U.S. Supreme Court 
will have oral arguments on whether or 
not the Affordable Care Act will be 
eliminated. You see, Republican attor-
neys general, as well as this adminis-
tration, have decided they want to do 
away with it. They want it to go away. 
When they are asked very simple 
questions: How will people be affected? 
They shrug their shoulders. 
Well, I will tell you how. Twenty mil-
lion Americans will lose their health 
insurance if the Supreme Court abol-
ishes the Affordable Care Act, and 
nearly every American will lose the 
protections it gives for people with pre-
existing 
conditions. 
The 
President 
said—and he said again last night, in 
what some characterized as a debate,

September 30, 2020 
and what I characterize as a free-for- 
all—the President said: Well, we have a 
substitute plan. 
Really, Mr. President? Where would 
that be? I haven’t seen it—not on the 
floor of the Senate, not in the news-
papers, not in the press releases. 
There is no substitute plan. That is 
why 3 years ago Senator McCain came 
to the floor and said he would not join 
the Republicans in killing the Afford-
able Care Act, because there was no 
substitute. It would leave too many 
Americans without the protection of 
health insurance. 
Well, that is going to be argued in 
the Supreme Court on November 10, 
and by tradition, a Supreme Court Jus-
tice cannot vote come next spring on 
the fate of this lawsuit if they didn’t 
sit in on the oral argument. So there is 
a mad dash—a mad dash—by the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee to bring up 
the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett 
from 
Notre 
Dame 
University 
Law 
School. They want it done before No-
vember 3 so she can sit in on the deci-
sion—or at least on the oral argument 
and then the decision—in this case, 
California v. Texas. 
That is what it is all about. It is all 
about 600,000 people in the State of Illi-
nois—600,000—who rely on the Afford-
able Care Act to get their health insur-
ance. It is all about a law that elimi-
nated the number of uninsured in my 
State by 50 percent. It is all about a 
protection that we all take for granted 
that says insurance companies cannot 
discriminate against us because of pre-
existing conditions. That is what it is 
all about. 
Over 50 votes on the floor of the 
House of Representatives by the Re-
publican majority to end this Afford-
able Care Act couldn’t get the job done. 
A last minute scramble on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate in 2017 couldn’t get the 
job done. Senator MCCONNELL is going 
to get it done. He is going to get it 
done by pushing through a nominee be-
fore November 10 who can vote to 
eliminate this Affordable Care Act. 
How do I know that this Supreme 
Court nominee is going to eliminate 
the Affordable Care Act? Because she 
wrote it down. She wrote down her 
opinion as to whether or not this was 
constitutional. She has already let us 
know, and she obviously let President 
Trump know, and that is why he named 
her. 
And there is one other reason. You 
see, this President, for the first time in 
the history of the United States of 
America, will not pledge if he will ac-
cept the results of this election on No-
vember 3. It is the first time it has 
ever, ever happened in our history, and 
it is a constitutional outrage. 
I commend the Presiding Officer, the 
only Republican Senator on the floor 
who has spoken out against it, that I 
know of. Others should have joined 
him. The Governor of Massachusetts, a 
Republican, joined him, saying it is the 
wrong thing to say, the wrong thing to 
do, and both parties should condemn it 
when either a Presidential candidate or 
an incoming President says it. 
But this President is pretty obvious. 
He wants to fill that Supreme Court 
vacancy because he says: There may be 
an election contest after November 3; I 
want 9 people on the Court. 
What he didn’t say, which is obvious, 
is that he wants that ninth person to 
be his nominee. So that is what we face 
with this situation and what we have 
ahead of us in the next week and a half. 
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
Mr. President, I watched what was 
supposedly called a debate last night. 
It was painful. It was painful as this 
President showed so little respect when 
it came to the rules of the debate. 
Chris Wallace, the FOX Television 
newsman who moderated was beside 
himself. He didn’t know how to get the 
President to stop interrupting, to fol-
low the rules of the debate. This Presi-
dent doesn’t follow anybody’s rules but 
his own. That was very obvious last 
night. 
There was one moment, though, that 
I want to highlight. It was a moment 
when Chris Wallace basically said: Will 
both of you, the Democrat, Biden, and 
the Republican, President Trump— 
both of you—condemn violence, White 
nationalism, and White supremacists? 
Well, Biden did. Biden said: There is no 
place for violence in the name of polit-
ical protests—none. Unequivocal. 
Then came the turn of the President, 
who, if you remember, had difficulty 
parsing out the good guys and bad guys 
in 
Charlottesville—those 
who 
went 
down to Charlottesville to march for 
civil rights and those who went down 
to march, frankly, chanting what was 
used during the time of the German 
rise of Nazism, their anti-Semitic 
chant. They grabbed their torches and 
marched. When asked later, President 
Trump struggled with it and said that 
there were good folks on both sides, the 
White nationalist side, as well as those 
for civil rights. That was an outrage. 
Last night, Chris Wallace served up an 
opportunity for the President to clear 
it up. 
I came to the floor today to speak 
about the President’s response, to 
speak also about the most significant 
domestic terrorism threat facing our 
Nation today: the threat of violent 
White supremacists. Like most Ameri-
cans, I was stunned by the President’s 
refusal last night to condemn White su-
premacists during the course of last 
night’s Presidential debate. 
Moderator Chris Wallace gave Presi-
dent Trump an uninterrupted oppor-
tunity to condemn the Nation’s biggest 
domestic terrorist group, White su-
premacists. Instead, Trump said, and I 
quote: They should ‘‘stand back and 
stand by.’’ ‘‘Stand back and stand by.’’ 
Trump’s comments were quickly em-
braced by the Proud Boys, an alt-right 
self-described, 
‘‘western 
chauvinist’’ 
group that clearly heard it as a call to 
action. The group immediately turned 
the President’s words in the debate 
into a logo that has been widely cir-
culated on social media. 
From the rightwing social media 
site—which I am not going to name be-
cause I don’t want to give any pub-
licity to it, but I will put it in the 
Record—Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs 
said he took Trump’s words as a direc-
tive to ‘‘[F] . . . them up.’’ 
For years now, in letters, briefings, 
and hearings, I have repeatedly urged 
the Department of Justice and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation and the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
take a strong stand against the ongo-
ing threat of violent White supremacy 
and other far rightwing extremists. Un-
fortunately, instead of following up 
with a comprehensive, coordinated ef-
fort—to no surprise—the Trump admin-
istration has repeatedly chosen to 
downplay this deadly threat—a law- 
and-order President who looks the 
other way, winks, nods, and says 
‘‘stand by’’ to militia groups and White 
supremacists. 
Last year, several of us wrote to At-
torney General Barr and FBI Director 
Wray to inquire about the Trump ad-
ministration’s inexplicable, irrespon-
sible decision to stop tracking White 
supremacist incidents as a separate 
category of domestic terrorism. The 
Trump administration has yet to re-
spond to our many letters asking what 
the Department of Justice and the FBI 
are doing to combat the ongoing threat 
of White supremacist violence tar-
geting religious minorities and com-
munities of color. 
Since then, our concern has obvi-
ously grown. Instead of focusing on the 
significant threat of domestic ter-
rorism motivated by White supremacy 
and far-rightwing extremism, terror-
ists have killed more than 100 Ameri-
cans 
since 
9/11. 
President 
Trump 
claims, as he did last night, that vio-
lence is a ‘‘left-wing problem, not a 
right-wing problem.’’ 
Let me tell you, we should condemn 
violence on both wings and everything 
in between. I join Vice President Biden 
in condemning all violence, including 
the alleged murder of a Federal Protec-
tive Service officer in Oakland, CA, by 
a rightwing ‘‘Boogaloo’’ extremist, and 
the alleged murder of two Black Lives 
Matter protesters in Kenosha, WI, by 
an Illinois teenager who reportedly 
considered himself to be a member of a 
militia—17 years old. 
Unfortunately, as we have learned 
from former Trump administration of-
ficials, the Trump administration has 
downplayed the threat of violent White 
supremacy and other far rightwing do-
mestic terrorists. 
POLITICO recently reported that a 
draft homeland threat assessment re-
port from DHS was edited and changed 
by the Trump administration to weak-
en language discussing the particular 
threat posed by violent White suprema-
cists. The Trump boys don’t want to 
talk about it. 
Shortly thereafter, a DHS whistle-
blower alleged that DHS officials, in-
cluding Ken Cuccinelli, requested the 
modification of the homeland threat

assessment report to make the threat 
of White supremacists ‘‘appear less se-
vere’’ and add information on violent 
‘‘leftwing groups.’’ 
The efforts of officials within the 
Trump administration to obscure this 
threat posed by violent White suprema-
cists and other far-rightwing extrem-
ists are misguided and dangerous. We 
know the significance of this threat. 
An unclassified May 2017 FBI-DHS 
joint intelligence bulletin found that 
‘‘White supremacist extremism poses a 
persistent threat of lethal violence’’ 
and that White supremacists were re-
sponsible for more homicides from 2000 
to 2016 than any other domestic ex-
tremist group. FBI Director Wray ad-
mitted, when questioned before a Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee at a hearing 
last year, that the majority of domes-
tic terrorism threats in America in-
volve White supremacists. 
Thankfully, there is something in the 
Senate we can do to respond to this 
threat. I have introduced the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act, a bill that 
would enhance the Federal Govern-
ment’s efforts to prevent domestic ter-
rorism by requiring Federal law en-
forcement agencies to regularly assess 
domestic terrorism threats, focus their 
limited resources on the most signifi-
cant domestic terrorism threat, and 
provide training and resources to assist 
State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment. 
Good news: Last week, the House of 
Representatives passed the House com-
panion to my bill on a unanimous voice 
vote. The Democrats and Republicans 
all agreed. Senator MCCONNELL has a 
chance take it up. Are we going to 
stand together, as the House did, on a 
bipartisan basis, condemning White su-
premacists who resort to violence and 
terrorism or are we going to say to 
them: Stand back and stand by? 
It is time for us to step up together 
on a bipartisan basis. Condemn violent 
conduct on both political spectrums— 
on the right, on the left, and every-
thing in between. You can use our Con-
stitution responsibly. You don’t have 
to resort to violence. You don’t have to 
resort to vandalism or looting, the use 
of guns and threats, or the killing of 
innocent people. It is never ever ac-
ceptable, right or left. 
The dominant group, when it comes 
to this activity, is White supremacists. 
Our opportunity now to keep track of 
them and their activities is before us. 
All it takes is for Senator MCCONNELL 
to agree to take up this unanimously 
passed bill from the House of Rep-
resentatives and to say to President 
Trump, once and for all, join us in con-
demning all violence across the polit-
ical spectrum. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTHCARE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is 
typical during an election season to 
hear Democrats try to scare people 
into believing that Republicans want 
to destroy programs that Americans 
rely on for their health and security. 
We have recently heard this on Medi-
care and Social Security. Now there is 
a new subject to add: health insurance. 
The programs are different, but the 
scenarios are the same. 
The Democrats concoct a story, at-
tribute it to the President and to Re-
publican Members of Congress, and 
then turn to their allies to amplify this 
false narrative. What really stands out 
this election season is how those all- 
too-familiar scare tactics directly con-
tradict the message coming from the 
Presidential nominee of the Demo-
cratic Party. 
Vice President Biden says he is for 
hope, not fear. His actions and those of 
his party show just the opposite. So 
let’s start with the Democrats’ efforts 
to pin Medicare’s financial struggles on 
Republicans. The facts tell a much dif-
ferent story. 
Republicans have fought for decades, 
often in the face of Democratic resist-
ance, to keep Medicare strong not only 
for current enrollees but for their chil-
dren and grandchildren. For instance, 
in 1995, President Clinton vetoed Re-
publican efforts to keep Medicare on 
sound financial footing. 
Faced with the prospect that the 
Medicare hospital insurance trust fund 
was going broke in just a few years, 
back then, Republicans still pressed on. 
It was the work of a Republican House 
of Representatives and a Republican 
Senate 
that 
ultimately 
convinced 
President Clinton to sign the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997. That act of 1997 ex-
tended the life of the health insurance 
trust fund, but it was not a silver bul-
let to solve the Medicare Program’s 
long-term financial challenges. 
For 
many 
years, 
spanning 
both 
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations, the Medicare trustees have 
cautioned that the program’s financial 
shortfalls require further legislative 
action. The trustees reported repeat-
edly—advised Congress to enact such 
legislation sooner rather than later to 
minimize the impact on beneficiaries, 
healthcare providers, and taxpayers. 
Republicans know how important 
Medicare is to the over 60 million 
Americans who rely on the program for 
their healthcare, but we also realize 
that Medicare is on an unsustainable 
course. I have already said that we 
need to work in a bipartisan way to 
protect Medicare, particularly here in 
the U.S. Senate, where it takes 60 votes 
to get anything done. That work re-
quires an honest assessment and a very 
serious discussion. 
Sadly, it seems that Democrats are 
only willing to take their heads out of 
the sand long enough to point fingers. 
So let’s set the record straight. Earlier 
this year, the trustees of Medicare pro-
jected that that program would be 
bankrupt in 2026. Then, of course, we 
have this unprecedented public health 
emergency to deal with, the pandemic, 
as we always call it, which dealt a crip-
pling blow to our Nation. The sacrifices 
and efforts made to stop the spread of 
the coronavirus effectively shut down 
the U.S. economy and altered life as we 
all know it. 
Congress stepped in to provide Fed-
eral relief. The COVID response bills 
were passed on an overwhelming bipar-
tisan majority, specifically the CARES 
Act—better known as the Coronavirus 
Aid Relief and Economic Security 
Act—passed the House by a vote of 419 
to 6, and the U.S. Senate, 96 to 0. 
CARES gives extra Medicare funding 
to hospitals and other healthcare pro-
viders to keep them in business in the 
face of an unexpected drop in demand 
for medical services. Additionally, be-
cause of Medicare Part A, as financed 
by payroll taxes that are split between 
employers and employees, unemploy-
ment caused by the pandemic has re-
sulted in less money coming into the 
trust fund. So it, then, is not surprising 
that the Congressional Budget Office 
estimated earlier this month that the 
Medicare trust fund could run out of 
money in 2024, 2 years earlier than the 
Medicare trustees had projected, with-
out taking into account the impact of 
COVID because they didn’t know about 
it and couldn’t take that into consider-
ation. 
It is important to note that during 
the Trump Presidency and prior to the 
pandemic, the projected insolvency 
date of the Medicare health insurance 
trust fund remained pretty steady. No 
one could have anticipated this current 
crisis. 
Instead of taking it as a reminder of 
the need to shore up Medicare for the 
long haul, Democrats have opted to 
create a false narrative that the cur-
rent administration is the problem. 
Every recent President, Republican 
and Democratic, has offered Medicare 
reform ideas in budget requests sub-
mitted to the Congress. Many of those 
budgets 
contained 
identical 
policy 
ideas, 
whether 
from 
a 
Republican 
President or a Democratic President. 
Putting aside that Congress, and not 
the President, makes laws, the notion 
that proposals aimed at making Medi-
care more efficient is equivalent to 
sabotaging the program is absurd. Yet, 
whenever a Republican occupies the 
White House, we repeatedly hear from 
Democrats that proposals for program 
integrity represent cuts or efforts to 
weaken or destroy Medicare, even when 
some of those same proposals were put 
forward by Democratic administra-
tions. 
Because Medicare is on a path to 
bankruptcy, the greatest threat, then, 
is what often happens around here—in-
action. Over the past decade, Demo-
crats not only stood firmly in the way 
of meaningful Medicare reform, but 
they actually made the problem worse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5906 
September 30, 2020 
Rather than confront the looming cri-
sis in 2009, President Obama, Vice 
President 
Biden, 
and 
Washington 
Democrats raided more than $700 bil-
lion from the Medicare Program. They 
didn’t do it to save Medicare; they cut 
money from a financially strapped 
Medicare Program and then spent that 
money on a brandnew entitlement pro-
gram called ObamaCare. It was the 
Democrats 
who 
pushed 
ObamaCare 
through Congress without a single Re-
publican vote. 
And what do Democrats want to do if 
they find their way back into power? 
They want to enact something called 
Medicare for All. Moving the 180 mil-
lion Americans with private, employer- 
based insurance to the Medicare rolls 
would cause Federal spending to bal-
loon to unthinkable levels. 
An 
analysis 
conducted 
by 
the 
Mercatus Center in 2018 found that 
Medicare for All would increase Fed-
eral spending by $32 trillion over the 
next 10-year period. This Democratic 
plan would also give the Federal Gov-
ernment more control over healthcare, 
impose massive tax increases on the 
middle class, and disrupt access to 
services. That is why Democrats would 
rather mischaracterize the unavoidable 
impact of COVID and demonize Medi-
care budget proposals that are often bi-
partisan in nature. 
Democrats used the very same dirty 
tricks related to Social Security, as I 
just talked about with Medicare. Some 
across the aisle recently concocted a 
hypothetical proposal that eliminates 
the funding source for Social Security 
and asked the program’s Chief Actuary 
to assess its impact. 
This was an obvious attempt to 
alarm seniors and disabled Americans 
with the ultimate intent of smearing 
Republicans and feeding false talking 
points to a Democratic candidate for 
President. Even when their schemes 
and false talking points earned four 
Pinocchios from even the Washington 
Post, Democrats still proceed full 
speed ahead with their misinformation 
campaign. And even though Ways and 
Means Committee Ranking Member 
BRADY and I got the Social Security 
Actuary to affirm the Democrat’s re-
cent scheme was just a bunch of malar-
key, the Democrats and Candidate 
Biden continue with this misinforma-
tion. 
Again, Democrats use scare tactics in 
the runup to an election. While they 
accuse Republicans of wanting to de-
stroy Social Security, Senate Demo-
crats do little or nothing to work in a 
bipartisan way to help this program. 
Remember, in 2015, when the disability 
insurance trust fund was going to run 
dry, Senate Democrats demanded that 
the only thing that you could possibly 
do was to take from the retirement 
trust fund and then just simply kick 
the can down the road. 
Senate Democrats had no interest in 
working with us to at least try to 
make the disability insurance program 
better for beneficiaries. Instead, Sen-
ate Republicans worked with the House 
and Obama administration to prevent 
disability security trust fund exhaus-
tion and even to improve the program. 
There was no privatization of any-
thing, and the only thing that could be 
construed as a benefit cut came di-
rectly from President Obama. 
You will not hear anything about 
that from these Senate Democrats. In-
stead, they just bring out their stale 
talking points and, of course, scare tac-
tics about Republicans trying to de-
stroy the program. Now they are apply-
ing the same wornout, baseless scare 
tactics to this Supreme Court con-
firmation process. 
Democrats want to make the Presi-
dent’s nomination to fill the vacancy 
all about ObamaCare and the case the 
Court will consider this fall. 
Going to the minority leader’s own 
words when it comes to Judge Barrett’s 
confirmation hearing, he said: ‘‘We 
must focus like a laser on health care.’’ 
The left is misrepresenting an article 
by then-Professor Barrett in hopes of 
finding something—almost anything— 
to gum up this confirmation process. It 
seems to me they are just frustrated 
this nominee had the audacity to sug-
gest judges interpret law as written. 
There is an old saying in the legal 
profession: If the law isn’t on your side, 
pound the facts. If the facts aren’t on 
your side, pound the law. If neither 
fact or law is on your side, just pound 
the table. 
That is what we see yet again from 
our Democratic colleagues. It is ludi-
crous to pick one pending case and pre-
dict how every member of the Court, 
including one just starting the con-
firmation process, would vote on that 
case, especially when entirely different 
legal issues are at stake. Frankly, it is 
a disservice to the American people. 
The Democrats know this, but that 
will not stop them. It will not stop 
them from trying to mislead hard- 
working Americans into believing that 
their healthcare coverage could dis-
appear tomorrow. 
It is also just the latest example of 
how many Democrats in Congress view 
the Supreme Court—just somehow an-
other policy end that they can’t ac-
complish through this branch of gov-
ernment, where we are now. That is not 
the role of the Court. I am sure Judge 
Barrett will reiterate that point before 
the Judiciary Committee. 
The Supreme Court will hear oral ar-
guments in the case mid-November, 
and there are countless scenarios on a 
potential outcome. So is it is useless, 
then, to speculate. But that will not 
stop the Democrats from speculating 
during this process of Judge Barrett’s 
nomination. 
The bottom line is, no matter the de-
cision, no one will lose healthcare cov-
erage on the day the Supreme Court 
issues its ruling. 
In the meantime, Republicans will 
continue to protect individuals with 
preexisting conditions and fight to give 
Americans more affordable healthcare 
options. 
The President reaffirmed that very 
thing in his commitment in an Execu-
tive order that he signed last week. 
That Executive order states that it has 
been, and will continue to be, the pol-
icy of the United States to assure that 
Americans with preexisting conditions 
can obtain insurance of their choice at 
an affordable price. 
The Democrats don’t want to stop at 
ObamaCare. What they really want to 
do is impose their government-run 
Medicare for All Program and take 
away people’s private insurance plans 
that they like—because 160 million 
people have it. 
As I mentioned earlier, this one-size- 
fits-all approach would take away peo-
ple’s private insurance, result in worse 
care, and bankrupt the country. 
Republicans 
want 
to 
strengthen 
Medicare, preserve Social Security, 
and ensure affordable private coverage 
options now as well as in the future. 
Democrats want to mislead now in 
hopes of future political gains. 
Americans deserve better. We can do 
better. 
Vice President Biden and his party 
should stop their shameful election- 
year scare tactics. They should end the 
malarkey. 
It is time to have the courage to en-
gage in an honest, civil conversation 
about bipartisan ideas to improve these 
health and security programs for mil-
lions of people who depend on them.

NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are once again in a conversation about 
freedom of religion and the free exer-
cise of religion and what that means. 
Very simply, I would argue that it 
means the ability to have any faith, to 
have no faith at all, to change your 
faith, and to be able to live it out. 
The ability to have a faith is a part 
of who we are. It is our most precious 
possession within us. If it is not that, if 
it is something less than that, if the 
free exercise of religion has limitations 
on it, then it is simply the freedom to 
worship or to have a named faith 
around you but not to actually live 
your faith. 
That is not what we have in this 
country, thankfully. We have a con-
stitutionally protected right to the

September 30, 2020 
free exercise of religion. We have more 
than the freedom of worship at the 
place of our choosing; we have the abil-
ity to live our faith freely, 7 days a 
week, in all aspects of our lives. 
The question has become, though, are 
there certain positions in public life 
where you cannot have the free exer-
cise of religion; where, literally, if you 
are elected or appointed into certain 
offices, you lose your constitutional 
right. 
The U.S. Constitution makes that 
very, very clear. Article VI of the Con-
stitution says that ‘‘no religious Test 
shall ever be required as a Qualifica-
tion for any Office or public Trust 
under the United States.’’ It should be 
pretty straightforward and clear. 
In our last confirmation hearing, 
then-Professor 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett 
said, when asked a question about her 
faith: 
Senator, I see no conflict between having a 
sincerely held faith and duties as a judge. In 
fact, we have many judges, both State and 
Federal, across the country who have sin-
cerely held religious views and still impar-
tially and honestly discharge their obliga-
tions as a judge. And were I confirmed as a 
judge, I would decide cases according to rule 
of law, beginning to end, and in the rare cir-
cumstances that might ever arise—I can’t 
imagine one sitting here now—where I felt I 
had some conscientious objection to the law, 
I would recuse. 
Three years ago, like today, Judge 
Barrett’s faith—not her judicial philos-
ophy or her temperament—seemed to 
be front and center. Three years ago, 
my colleague from California, Senator 
DIANNE
FEINSTEIN, said this during 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett’s 
confirmation 
hearing: 
Why is it that so many of us on this side 
have this very uncomfortable feeling that, 
you know, dogma and law are two different 
things, and I think whatever religion is, it 
has its own dogma. The law is totally dif-
ferent. And I think in your case, Professor, 
when you read your speeches, the conclusion 
one draws is that the dogma lives loudly 
within you. 
Senator DURBIN
from Illinois just 
asked her a very straightforward ques-
tion: ‘‘Do you consider yourself an or-
thodox Catholic?’’ 
A question like that about the defin-
ing of faith and how much of a Catholic 
are you or how much dogma lives in 
you is really a question of, how much 
faith do you really practice, do you 
have a name on you, or do you practice 
a little too much faith for my comfort 
level? 
See, the free exercise of religion per-
tains to an individual’s sincerely held 
religious beliefs. It is not about the ac-
ceptance of that belief by others. If it 
were, the free exercise of religion 
would be dictated by what others be-
lieve rather than what you believe. But 
in America—at least the America that 
I know—individuals are allowed to 
have a faith, live their faith, have no 
faith, or change their faith. 
For whatever reason, Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett is being criticized be-
cause she is Catholic. 
There is an AP article that came out 
just this week that did an in-depth 
view—it was sent all over the coun-
try—about, she is not just Catholic; she 
is one of those Catholics. It went into 
great detail about how she attends 
Bible studies and is on a board of a 
school and helps educate children and 
seems to believe that there is a per-
sonal relationship with Jesus, as they 
quoted in the article, as if that were 
some sort of criminal thing and needs 
to have some suspicion. 
It is about her faith that she is being 
challenged, this undercurrent. How-
ever, Justice Ginsburg was not shy 
about the fact that she was Jewish— 
nor should she have been. We have 
heard a lot about the fact that she was 
the longest serving Jewish Justice and 
the first Jewish person to lie in state 
in the Capitol. Why is it OK for Justice 
Ginsburg to talk about her faith and 
not Judge Barrett? Why is Justice 
Ginsburg’s faith celebrated and Judge 
Barrett’s faith currently being demon-
ized? It is because those on the left be-
lieve their faith is OK, but for people 
on the right, it is suspicious. 
Even last night, Vice President Biden 
introduced himself as an Irish Catholic. 
That is celebrated on the left. But for 
Judge Barrett to identify herself as a 
Catholic, she is asked questioningly: 
Yeah, but are you one of those ortho-
dox Catholics? 
One of the most remembered things 
about Justice Ginsburg—of many—was 
her storied friendship with Justice 
Scalia. On paper, they would be the 
unlikeliest of friends. She was a Jewish 
liberal. He was a Catholic conservative. 
Their differences didn’t divide them or 
offend each other. 
Of their friendship, Judge Barrett 
said: 
Particularly poignant to me was her long— 
The ‘‘her’’ being Justice Ginsburg— 
and deep friendship with Justice Antonin 
Scalia, my own mentor. Justices Scalia and 
Ginsburg disagreed fiercely in print without 
rancor in person. Their ability to maintain a 
warm and rich friendship despite their dif-
ferences even inspired an opera. These two 
great Americans demonstrated that argu-
ments, even about matters of great con-
sequence, need not destroy affection. 
There is no question that Justice 
Ginsburg did a lot for the advancement 
of women in this country. Doesn’t 
Judge Barrett also exemplify that? She 
is a circuit court judge. She graduated 
summa cum laude from Notre Dame 
Law School, first in her class. She has 
been a professor for 15 years at Notre 
Dame, has clerked for a Supreme Court 
Justice, is the mother of seven chil-
dren, and was three times voted as the 
top law professor at Notre Dame. 
Thirty-four Supreme Court clerks 
who worked alongside Barrett—of all 
parties—wrote this: 
We are Democrats, Republicans, and inde-
pendents, and we have diverse points of view 
on politics, judicial philosophy, and much 
else. Yet we all write to support the nomina-
tion of Professor Barrett to be a Circuit 
Judge on the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Seventh Circuit. Professor Barrett is 
a woman of remarkable intellect and char-
acter. She is eminently qualified for the job. 
All 49 full-time faculty members of 
Notre Dame Law School—all 49 of 
them—signed a letter stating: 
[Barrett] possesses in abundance all of the 
other qualities that shape extraordinary ju-
rists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, impec-
cable temperament, and above all, funda-
mental decency and humanity. 
Seventy-three law professors across 
the country, including former Obama 
administration Solicitor General Neal 
Katyal, stated this: 
Although we have differing perspectives on 
the methods and conclusions in her work, we 
all agree that Professor Barrett’s contribu-
tions to legal scholarship are rigorous, fair- 
minded, respectful, and constructive. 
So she is criticized tenaciously be-
cause of her faith. She is criticized be-
cause she is not woman enough, what-
ever that may mean. She has even been 
criticized this past week and called a 
‘‘White colonizer.’’ Two of her seven 
children were adopted from Haiti. She 
has been accused of using her children 
as props. How low can this go? 
This is what Judge Barrett had to 
say about her family: 
The president has asked me to become the 
ninth justice, and as it happens I am used to 
being in a group of nine—my family. Our 
family includes me; my husband, Jesse; 
Emma; Vivian; Tess; John Peter; Liam; Ju-
liet; and Benjamin. Vivian and John Peter, 
as the president said, were born in Haiti, and 
they came to us five years apart when they 
were very young. And the most revealing 
fact about Benjamin, our youngest, is that 
his brothers and sisters unreservedly iden-
tify him as their favorite sibling. 
Our children obviously make our life very 
full. While I am a judge, I’m better known 
back home as a [room] parent, carpool driv-
er, and birthday party planner. When schools 
went remote last spring, I tried on another 
hat. Jesse— 
That is, her husband— 
and I became co-principals of the Barrett e- 
learning academy. And yes, the list of en-
rolled students was a very long one. Our chil-
dren are my greatest joy, even though they 
deprive me of any reasonable amount of 
sleep. 
Judge Barrett has even been criti-
cized in her faith and been criticized in 
her relationship in her family. 
Judge Barrett said this about her 
husband and her family: 
I could not manage this very full life with-
out the unwavering support of my husband, 
Jesse. At the start of our marriage, I imag-
ined that we would run our household as 
partners. As it has turned out, Jesse does far 
more than his share of the work. To my cha-
grin, I learned at dinner recently that my 
children consider him to be the better cook. 
For 21 years, Jesse has asked me every sin-
gle morning what he can do for me that day. 
And though I almost always say ‘‘Nothing,’’ 
he still finds ways to take things off my 
plate. And that’s not because he has a lot of 
free time. He has a busy law practice. It is 
because he is a superb and generous husband, 
and I am very fortunate. 
Faith, her family—why are we doing 
personal attacks on a qualified can-
didate for the Supreme Court of the 
United States? First in her class, rec-
ognized by the faculty as superior, rec-
ognized by judges and leaders across 
the country as qualified—why are we 
into this conversation?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5908 
September 30, 2020 
On September 29, an article from 
NPR 
was 
entitled 
‘‘Amy 
Coney 
Barrett’s Catholicism Is Controversial 
But May Not Be Confirmation Issue.’’ 
The article said: 
Never before has the Court been so domi-
nated by one religious denomination. . . . 
That is, Catholics. 
‘‘It’s legitimate for senators to be con-
cerned about whether the court is reflecting 
the diversity of faith in the United States.’’ 
Wow. Now it is maybe we have too 
many Catholics. Maybe this is one too 
many, and Senators should consider 
the greater diversity. As odd as it 
sounds, the article didn’t identify the 
fact that Amy Coney Barrett would be 
the only Justice not to have graduated 
from Harvard or Yale. There doesn’t 
seem to be a desire to have a diversity 
of opinion or background in that. It is 
just about this one area—her faith. 
Imposing a religious test on a Su-
preme Court Justice is not only anti-
thetical to the Constitution; it is a 
very slippery slope, and it is one we 
have been down before and I thought 
we had cleared. 
In 1960—1960—then-Candidate John F. 
Kennedy stood in front of a group of 
ministers in Houston, TX, who were 
concerned about having a Catholic 
President because we, as a country, 
had never had a Catholic President, 
and there were all these rumors and 
innuendoes out there that the Presi-
dent would work for the Pope. So in 
1960 JFK stood in Houston, TX, and 
spoke to a group of ministers and made 
this statement. He said: 
I believe in an America . . . where no reli-
gious body seeks to impose its will directly 
or indirectly upon the general populace or 
the public acts of its officials; and where re-
ligious liberty is so indivisible that an act 
against one church is treated as an act 
against all. 
For while this year it may be a Catholic 
against whom the finger of suspicion is 
pointed, in other years it has been, and may 
someday be again, a Jew—or a Quaker or a 
Unitarian or a Baptist. It was Virginia’s har-
assment of Baptist preachers, for example, 
that helped lead to Jefferson’s statute of re-
ligious freedom. 
Today I may be the victim, but tomorrow 
it may be you—until the whole fabric of our 
harmonious society is ripped at a time of 
great national peril. 
JFK said this: 
Finally, I believe in an America where reli-
gious intolerance will someday end; where 
all men and all churches are treated as 
equal; where every man has the same right 
to attend or not attend the church of his 
choice; where there is no Catholic vote, no 
anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any 
kind; and where Catholics, Protestants, and 
Jews, at both the lay and pastoral level, will 
refrain from those attitudes of disdain and 
division which have so often marred their 
works in the past, and promote instead the 
American ideal of brotherhood. 
[This] is the kind of America . . . I believe 
[in]. And it represents the kind of presidency 
in which I believe—a great office that must 
neither be humbled by making it the instru-
ment of any one religious group, nor tar-
nished by arbitrarily withholding its occu-
pancy from the members of any one religious 
group. I believe in a president whose reli-
gious views are his own private affair, nei-
ther imposed by him upon the nation, or im-
posed by the nation upon him as a condition 
of holding that office. 
I would not look with favor upon a presi-
dent— 
Or in this case, I would say a judge— 
working to subvert the First Amendment’s 
guarantees of religious liberty. Nor would 
our system of checks and balances permit 
him to do so. And neither do I look with 
favor upon those who would work to subvert 
Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a 
religious test—even by indirection—for it. If 
they disagree with that safeguard, they 
should be out openly working to repeal it. 
We are a nation that celebrates faith 
and recognizes faith as a unifying fac-
tor, even in diversity of faith. I have 
had the privilege—many of us have—to 
be able to pray with each other. We are 
Senators of different faiths, different 
backgrounds, different places. We work 
to treat each other with respect. 
Faith is not something that Ameri-
cans should demand—nor the Senate 
should demand—that people have to 
take off to be able to serve the Amer-
ican people. We don’t take our faith 
off. It is not a jersey that we wear on 
the outside; it is the core of who we are 
on the inside. That is not something 
that I just take off to put on public 
service. You put on public service, but 
your core faith should not be chal-
lenged to be removed from your soul to 
be a viable person to be able to serve 
the Court. 
Let’s work on our concept of reli-
gious liberty. Whether you are a Chris-
tian, whether you are a Muslim, wheth-
er you are a Buddhist or a Hindu, you 
can be a great American and you can 
serve this great country in any loca-
tion that you choose because we are a 
nation that honors and protects the 
right of free exercise of religion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4117 
Mr. 
CRAMER. 
Mr. 
President, 
6 
months ago, our Nation’s small busi-
nesses faced an existential crisis and 
unprecedented threat. Like the rest of 
us, they didn’t truly know what this 
virus was, how hard it would hit us, 
how long it would last, or what the fu-
ture would hold. But they did know 
that their businesses were preparing to 
close, that employees were being told 
to stay home, and they needed help, 
which is why I and every other col-
league in this Chamber passed the 
CARES Act and created the Paycheck 
Protection Program. 
We gave money to the administra-
tion, which, in turn, gave that money 
to lenders, and those lenders, in turn, 
loaned that money to small businesses 
to use for employee retention. If they 
followed the rules, they were told they 
wouldn’t have to return the money. 
That was the commitment we made to 
them while we strongly encouraged 
them—I emphasize ‘‘strongly encour-
aged them’’—to use the program, and it 
worked. 
We had nearly 5 million PPP loans 
worth $571 billion out the door and into 
the hands of our businesses that put it 
into the hands of their employees, 
which kept tens of millions of people, 
by some counts, on the payrolls instead 
of on the unemployment rolls. 
History will be the judge of the long- 
term success of the program, for sure, 
but it is unquestionable that in the 
short term, this program succeeded. It 
is time for us now to uphold our com-
mitment. 
America’s lenders and borrowers are 
ready to take that next step, proving 
that they have complied with the rules 
so they can receive forgiveness for 
these loans. 
Sadly for them, but not surprising to 
me, the forgiveness process designed by 
the agency is burdensome, complex, 
and already in need of reform. That is 
not just my opinion; that is the opin-
ion of the Government Accountability 
Office. They said: ‘‘Applying for loan 
forgiveness is more time consuming 
than applying for the PPP loan itself 
and requires more lender review.’’ 
You see the trap that we have laid 
for borrowers and lenders. We, the Fed-
eral 
Government, 
spent 
weeks— 
months—telling our hurting, fragile 
small businesses: Take this money. 
Take this money. Just use it correctly, 
and it will be forgiven. 
Well, here we are. Our businesses are 
still struggling, still facing uncer-
tainty, and the agency-prescribed solu-
tion appears to be creating a system 
more intense than any they have expe-
rienced during this pandemic just so 
they can prove to the right people that 
they didn’t use their money incor-
rectly. That is a problem. 
We have known it was going to be a 
problem for a long time. That is why 
we have been working for months on 
bipartisan solutions to the problems in 
this bipartisan program. Over the sum-
mer, Senator MENENDEZ and I brought 
together a bipartisan coalition and in-
troduced 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Small Business Forgiveness Act. Here 
is what it does. Of those 5 million PPP 
recipients, 4.2 million had loans of 
$150,000 or less. Remember, they could 
borrow up to $10 million. They account 
for around $132 billion of the PPP funds 
that we have spent. Think about that: 
4.2 million of the 5 million—so 86 per-
cent of the borrowers—account for $132 
billion of the $571 billion that we have 
spent. That is only 27 percent. So what 
we did was separate the 86 percent of 
the loans, which account for 27 percent 
of the money, and said that if bor-
rowers—small businesses—complete a 
simple, one-page forgiveness document 
to the lender—our banks, our credit 
unions—the loan will be forgiven. It is 
that simple. 
It eliminates the anxiety being felt 
by our businesses. It puts account-
ability on the borrowers and frees up 
enforcement efforts to focus on the 14 
percent of the PPP recipients who took 
73 percent of the funds. If this seems to 
be obvious common sense, it is because 
it is. 
Congress isn’t known for working 
well together; I know that. But, here, a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5909 
September 30, 2020 
Republican from North Dakota has 
teamed up with a Democrat from New 
Jersey to find a plan that works for 
Members from Arizona to Alabama, 
from North Carolina to Nebraska. 
Nearly one-third of the Senate—with 
Members from both parties—has signed 
onto our bill. 
What has happened since? The Pre-
siding Officer knows as well as anybody 
that our friends blocked us from con-
sidering a new relief package just a 
couple of weeks ago. Many of the provi-
sions of our bipartisan bill were in that 
package. Many bipartisan plans from 
all Senators were in it, but politics pre-
vailed, and we came up short. That 
happens around here. 
Just because our total package was 
blocked doesn’t mean our small busi-
nesses and lenders who gave them PPP 
funds don’t still need relief. That is 
what we have heard from our commu-
nities and hundreds of association lead-
ers from all across the country. On 
their behalf—on behalf of the small 
businesses that need help and the lend-
ers we encouraged to help them—I am 
going to ask for unanimous consent to 
pass S. 4117. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Small 
Business be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 4117 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; 
further, 
that 
the 
Johnson 
amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to 
object, I want to thank my friend Sen-
ator CRAMER for bringing attention to 
this issue. I think he knows that the 
PPP program was included in the 
CARES Act. I take great pride in work-
ing with Senator RUBIO—Republican 
and Democrat—and other members of 
our committee. 
We were the architects of the PPP 
program. It was bipartisan. It was in-
cluded in the CARES Act, and it was 
enacted in March. It is very interesting 
that if we would have gone with the 
original bill that came out of the Re-
publicans, it would not have been a bi-
partisan bill, and much of the help for 
small businesses would not have been 
there in the CARES Act. It is only 
through bipartisan legislation that we 
were able to advance the types of tools 
that are necessary to help America’s 
small businesses. 
I must tell you, the No. 1 priority 
today for small businesses is to safely 
be able to resume full operations. They 
need it to be safe for parents and their 
children to be able to get back to 
school. They need us to get this virus 
under control, so businesses that de-
pend on large gatherings—such as food 
service, hospitality, events, travel, and 
tourism—can literally survive. 
The House took its action to help ac-
complish these goals last May when 
they passed the Heroes Act. To this 
date, the Republican leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, has not allowed us to take 
up the comprehensive legislation that 
will help our country, help deal with 
the virus, help our economy, and help 
small businesses. 
Just today, Speaker PELOSI has up-
dated the Heroes Act because it has 
been over 4 months since it was passed 
so that we now have a Heroes Act that 
is within the range between what the 
Republican Senators originally sug-
gested and the Democrats originally 
suggested. That is moving toward a bi-
partisan bill. That is what we need. 
In the Heroes Act, there are so many 
provisions that are desperately needed 
for small business that are not in this 
unanimous consent request. Let me 
point out a few. 
We need a second round of PPP. Busi-
nesses have suffered significant rev-
enue losses. The hardest hit, the small-
er of the small businesses need more 
help. The PPP program is designed for 
an 8-week pandemic. This pandemic 
has gone long beyond 8 weeks. 
The House legislation includes re-
sources for mission lenders, such as 
CDFIs and depository institutions. I 
mention that because we have found 
that when you rely on the 7(a) commer-
cial loans in order to get forgivable 
loans, those who are traditionally un-
derserved are not able to get the same 
type of attention—minority businesses, 
women-owned businesses, businesses in 
rural areas. We need to pay special at-
tention to providing additional re-
sources and allocations to mission 
lenders. That is not included in the 
unanimous consent request. 
We need to expand PPP eligibility. 
We have heard from our nonprofits 
that were left out of the first round. 
They need to be included. Local news-
papers were not included. Previously 
incarcerated individuals were denied 
certain help. The House legislation— 
the Heroes Act—makes those changes 
so that all eligible small businesses 
would be able to qualify for these 
loans. 
The Economic Injury Disaster Loan 
Program, EIDL, is desperately in need 
of congressional attention. We have bi-
partisan support for significantly in-
creasing the resources going into the 
EIDL Program—Senator CORNYN, Sen-
ator ROSEN—so that we could replenish 
the grants and provide the grants that 
are desperately needed for small busi-
nesses. 
We can eliminate that $150,000 arbi-
trary cap that was put on by the Small 
Business Administration, which is con-
trary to law. We need to make it clear 
that the loans could be made up to $2 
million under the EIDL Program. 
We need to help State and local gov-
ernments. That is in the Heroes Act. It 
is not in the unanimous consent that is 
being suggested. We have to help State 
and local governments because their 
services are critically important for 
small businesses to be able to operate 
effectively. The House bill provides a 
separate amount of funds so that the 
local governments can directly help 
small businesses. That is not included 
in the unanimous consent request. 
We can approve the 7(a) Loan Pro-
gram, 
504 
Loan 
Program, 
and 
Microloan Program. They are in the 
House bill, not in the unanimous con-
sent request. 
We have all heard from our live 
venue operators. They need help. They 
are going to close if we don’t do some-
thing to help them. It is our responsi-
bility to do that. It is in the Heroes 
Act. It is not in the unanimous consent 
request. 
We need to expand the employee re-
tention tax credit, which allows work-
ers to be retained by small businesses. 
This was expanded in the Heroes Act, 
but it is not in the unanimous consent 
request. 
I could go on and on about all of the 
provisions that we need to take up now 
that are necessary to help small busi-
nesses. If we wait until after the elec-
tions, more small businesses will be 
shuttered forever. That is the No. 1 pri-
ority of small businesses. 
We also find that we need to help in 
regard to streamlining the process of 
loan forgiveness. I agree with my col-
league. I agree that we need to simplify 
that process. I have had my arguments 
with the Small Business Administra-
tion and so have those who have over-
sight in the executive branch. We know 
what they did to the EIDL Program. 
They didn’t administer it the way we 
said—3 days to process grants. They 
didn’t do that. They didn’t give us the 
data we needed so we could understand 
the program. So why do we have con-
fidence that, under the Senator’s unan-
imous consent request, he will do the 
right form? You give them the author-
ity to issue the form, and I am not ex-
actly sure that will work. 
Here is the good news. We want to do 
something in this area because the 
Senator is right in that we need to 
streamline the process. The SBA is not 
doing it the way we intended it to be 
done. The House took action, but the 
House’s action is a little bit different. 
The House has said: Look, for those 
loans under $50,000, why don’t we do it 
without any paper. Let them retain the 
records, but let’s eliminate any possi-
bility of the SBA’s delaying the loan 
forgiveness. I think that is one we 
should look at, but we can’t do that if 
we are to let this unanimous consent 
go forward. 
Lastly, this consent also deals with 
safe harbor for the PPP lenders. It 
would provide safe harbor from claims 
under the Small Business Act, the 
False Claims Act, the Financial Insti-
tutions Reform, Recovery, and En-
forcement Act, the Federal Deposit In-
surance Act, and the Bank Secrecy 
Act, or any other Federal, State or 
criminal or civil law regulations. I 
think we should look at that before we 
just, all of a sudden, agree that we

should give that type of blanket safe 
harbor. 
Small businesses need help now. My 
colleague is correct. They need help 
now, but they need help far broader— 
far broader—than this unanimous con-
sent takes us. There is also a need for 
negotiations in regard to the provi-
sions that the Senator has brought to 
the floor. I can assure him that I will 
continue to work with Senator RUBIO 
in a bipartisan manner once we get the 
numbers from the powers that be—they 
being the Speaker of the House, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the admin-
istration, and our leaders. 
As we did under the CARES Act, we 
will put together a comprehensive pro-
gram to help all small businesses, not 
just those that are struggling right 
now with this form but those that can’t 
even get the loan because they were 
not eligible but should have been eligi-
ble or those that need additional help 
or those that need the EIDL Program 
to work well or a microloan. We want 
to provide that comprehensive help 
now—this week—for small businesses, 
but this unanimous consent just does 
not get us there. 
The commitment to my colleague is 
that we are going to work with him 
and our other colleagues, as we always 
do, and that we are going to include 
the provision to make it easier for 
small businesses to get loan forgive-
ness because we agree that the SBA 
has not interpreted our law the way we 
wanted it to. 
For all of those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate Senator CARDIN’s commitment to 
work together. We are all committed 
to that as well. 
I do struggle a little bit when the 
reasons to oppose something are all of 
the things that aren’t in it. Sure, there 
is not support for State or local gov-
ernments. There is not a new EIDL 
Program or a reformed PPP program 
or a microloan program or tax credits. 
Of course, tax credits are under a whole 
different jurisdiction. There is not nu-
clear modernization, and there is not 
unemployment insurance. There are 
lots of things that aren’t in it. Yet pol-
itics is the art of the possible, and 
around here, big packages become very 
difficult, and politics gets in the way. 
I was hoping we could find an incre-
ment to help small businesses in a sig-
nificant way that, frankly, wouldn’t 
cost the government anything but, in 
fact, might save it some money in its 
just not hiring another large bureauc-
racy. 
I look forward to working with the 
Senator. I appreciate his work on the 
CARES Act and the PPP and his work 
with Chairman RUBIO and SUSAN COL-
LINS in creating this program. I am 
just disappointed that we couldn’t get 
it across the finish line today, but I 
hope we can soon. 
I yield the floor as I know that a cou-
ple of my colleagues want to speak on 
the same topic. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator CRAMER and my colleague Sen-
ator ROUNDS from North Dakota. 
North 
Carolina’s 
businesses 
are 
struggling. I heard Senator CARDIN and 
am sympathetic to most of what he 
said. Yet, as I have traveled across the 
State—and I have had 65 telephone 
townhalls since COVID started and 
have talked with citizens in North 
Carolina for an hour, spending 55 min-
utes hearing from them and answering 
their questions—I know we have a very 
difficult problem in North Carolina and 
across the country. I just talked with a 
hotel and lodging association and a res-
taurant association a few weeks ago. 
They said we have 18,000 restaurants in 
North Carolina, and 9,000 of them are 
at risk of closing permanently. 
When we passed the CARES Act, we 
knew we had to do something big, bold, 
and fast, and I think everyone at the 
Small Business Administration and in 
the banking industry mobilized to do 
something that was unprecedented. 
They got that money out and into the 
hands of businesses. 
The program is called the Paycheck 
Protection Program for a reason. We 
were doing everything we could to 
make sure that those businesses that 
were willing could make payroll—could 
keep people on their benefits, could 
keep people on their healthcare—and 
could weather the storm while closures 
were going on all across this country. 
They were closing down businesses or, 
certainly, dramatically reducing their 
business. 
Thank goodness for the brave busi-
nesses that stepped up and applied for 
Paycheck Protection Program loans, 
and thank goodness for the banks that 
were willing to underwrite them while 
we were still, really, working the rules 
out—literally building the cars as they 
were rolling down the road. They 
should be commended for what they 
have done. 
This measure is a simple measure. 
We know that more than 85 percent of 
all of the loans that were underwritten 
under the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram were under $150,000, and we know 
that they were small businesses. Yet 
we have a lot of paperwork that these 
businesses are going to have to do, and 
small businesses interacting with the 
Federal Government on four or five oc-
casions before the loan is forgiven is a 
daunting task when you are still trying 
to figure out how you can make payroll 
and how you can keep your business 
going. 
Then you have the banking industry 
that we rely on for moving all of this 
capital out there and making sure that 
payrolls can be met and want to be pre-
pared for the next tranche of CARES 
Act 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
loans. Yet we are going to tie them up 
over paperwork with these small busi-
ness loans that we can forgive? It is 
not like we are turning a blind eye to 
compliance. We will look at that loan 
portfolio with the same sort of sam-
pling that the IRS does to make sure 
there is not any fraud or abuse and to 
make sure people are held accountable. 
If Senator CARDIN really wants to get 
to the work of the next Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, let’s lay the ground-
work and clear the plumbing so we 
may call on the Small Business Admin-
istration, which is in the process of hir-
ing 1,200 people just to deal with loan 
forgiveness. The banks that want to 
provide more loans need to clear their 
backlogs so they will have the capacity 
to do it as fast as possible. 
Senator CARDIN is right in that we 
have a lot more to do. This is a step in 
a long journey. Yet, in doing this for-
giveness program—the measure that 
Senator CARDIN objected to—we would 
have the opportunity to take a straw 
off the camel’s back. We have to do 
something. We continue following up 
on the CARES Act, but I am very dis-
appointed that we have gotten where 
we are in this Chamber when every-
body knows this is good legislation. 
We should do it, but they are turning 
their backs on businesses. Unfortu-
nately, I think it is going to result in 
more people being on unemployment 
and more businesses closing. I will 
work as hard as I can with Senator 
CRAMER and Senator ROUNDS and other 
Members to get this done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, first of 
all, let me thank my colleague from 
North Dakota for making this presen-
tation to begin with and my colleague 
from North Carolina for supporting 
him in this action. We appreciate the 
comments the Senator from Maryland 
has made, but we, most certainly, dis-
agree with the approach he is sug-
gesting. 
Senator CRAMER has suggested that 
we have a very serious problem here 
that has to be addressed. This is some-
thing that does not affect just Repub-
lican businesses. It affects all busi-
nesses. You are talking about 4.2 mil-
lion small businesses across the United 
States that are being impacted by this 
that have borrowed money in good 
faith and that have kept their busi-
nesses open. Now, surprisingly, when it 
comes time for the forgiveness portion 
of this to occur, we have a very chal-
lenging process put in place—a burden-
some process—that could only have 
been done with the common sense 
found in Washington, DC, not in the 
rest of the country. To make the appli-
cation more difficult for one to get for-
giveness than the actual application to 
participate in the program in the first 
place is simply absurd. 
Let me share with you a message 
from one of our bank executives in 
South Dakota. He is a rather promi-
nent CEO in South Dakota. I share 
with you that I have cleaned this up a 
little bit and will paraphrase his quote 
to us after we asked him for informa-
tion concerning how the banks will try 
to handle this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5911 
September 30, 2020 
Remember, the banks didn’t have to 
participate in this, but they did so, in 
a way, to literally get money out in a 
very short period of time to the busi-
nesses that desperately needed the 
money in order to survive. 
First of all, they had open lines of 
communication with the SBA literally 
24/7 for more than a week in their try-
ing to get approval for individual appli-
cations. They helped small businesses 
actually fill out the applications in the 
first place. Second of all, these banks 
will become responsible for these loans, 
and unless they are forgiven, they will 
stay with the banks. 
If we are successful in coming to an 
agreement on additional loans being 
made in the future, how in the world 
can we expect these banks to get back 
in if we can’t even follow up on our 
agreement that we would make this a 
simple process to get the loans forgiven 
in the first tranche that we have com-
pleted? 
Let me share with you what this CEO 
writes. This has to do with his version 
of what is going on. We have literally 
received dozens of these types of com-
ments from bank loan officers in the 
Upper Midwest, particularly in South 
Dakota. I will paraphrase because, as I 
say, we had to clean this up a little bit. 
The forgiveness piece of the PPP is a dis-
aster. I have 750 loans out of 1,381 that are 
under $20,000 and 50 that are under $2,000. 
They have, basically, the same forgiveness 
process as the loans of my largest borrower, 
which is for over $4 million. So we are asking 
them to fill out the same paperwork as we do 
a large loan recipient. 
He goes on to write: 
The simplified version of the PPP loan for-
giveness application program is not that 
simple. The Government Accountability Of-
fice has studied it and has said that it takes 
a borrower 15 hours to complete and the 
lender 75 hours to process. 
Let me say that again. It takes 15 
hours for the loan borrower to actually 
do the paperwork and 75 hours to proc-
ess it. 
Our borrowers are not happy nor are we as 
bankers. This is not what we signed up for in 
order to get disaster payments to our cus-
tomers. We are trying to hold off the small 
businesses that borrowed under $150,000, but 
they are getting anxious. We as lenders bust-
ed our tails to get this money out, and we 
are getting absolutely hosed by this process. 
I might add that this is not the word 
he used. 
Lenders feel as though they have really 
been let down. There is more than a little fa-
tigue with the entire PPP loan forgiveness 
process. 
If we used any kind of common sense 
like they have in the Upper Midwest, 
we would have fixed this thing already. 
Unfortunately, it is in the middle of a 
political process in Washington, DC, 
and 4.2 million small businesses hang 
in the balance. Their ability to take 
care of a loan—that we had committed 
would be forgiven if they were to follow 
through—is now in jeopardy. Time is 
running out. 
I appreciate the opportunity, once 
again, to support the legislation that 
Senator CRAMER from North Dakota 
has proposed. I hope that our col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
come back and start using some of that 
common sense that seems to prevail in 
the rest of the United States even 
though it is not always evident here in 
Washington, DC. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss the 
President’s historic choice for the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The President has 
nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
of the Seventh Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. She would fill the vacancy left 
by the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
This is a powerful and positive ap-
pointment by President Trump. Judge 
Barrett is a brilliant jurist. She has a 
stellar record, and she has a solid char-
acter. She will serve as a role model for 
an entire generation in the legal pro-
fession. 
She has already been vetted by the 
Senate. She was vetted and received bi-
partisan support when she was con-
firmed 3 years ago to her current court 
position. Well, that is the definition of 
‘‘highly qualified.’’ 
She embodies the qualities the Amer-
ican people want in a Justice. Now, the 
American people want fair Justices. 
They want Justices who know that 
their job is to apply the law, not legis-
late from the bench. 
That is what people in my home 
State of Wyoming talked about this 
past weekend, when I was visiting at 
home with the people of Wyoming. 
They want Judge Barrett, and she is 
committed, through her time in the 
legal profession and on the bench, to 
these very values. 
So here in the Senate, in this body, 
we have a job to do, and it is to offer 
advice and consent. 
We will hold fair hearings, and we 
will hold a timely floor vote on Judge 
Barrett’s nomination. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle don’t seem to feel the same 
way about this process. In fact, they 
have already announced their opposi-
tion to the nominee—regardless of how 
qualified this nominee is who is before 
us, regardless of the vacancy that ex-
ists on the Court, regardless of the 
spectacle that the American people saw 
2 years ago with the confirmation of 
Judge Kavanaugh. 
The Senate minority leader has made 
his position clear. He appears to be so 
disturbed by the prospect of a constitu-
tional jurist on the bench that he is 
willing to upend the core institutions 
of our Nation. 
The Democratic Senators are calling 
on their colleagues to pack the Court— 
to add two more liberal, activist Jus-
tices to the Supreme Court. 
One Senator tweeted about it this 
weekend. That is, of course, what they 
plan to do if they win the White House, 
the House, and the Senate in the No-
vember elections. Now, this would de-
liver partisan decisions that make law 
but don’t apply the law. 
Now, for Vice President Biden in the 
Presidential debate last night, he re-
fused to answer a specific, direct ques-
tion about this very topic. He refused 
to reject a position that Democrats are 
holding that is highly unpopular and 
highly divisive. 
And now adding members to the Su-
preme Court—you know who said that 
was a bad idea? Well, it was Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. She said nine members 
is the right number; that it works. 
People shouldn’t try to add to that. It 
would be seen as partisan, political. 
And, of course, that number has been 
in place since 1869. 
Last year, in an interview, she said 
that nine was the right number. So this 
isn’t something she said a long time 
ago. It was just last year in an inter-
view with National Public Radio. 
Democrats aren’t going to listen to 
her. Senior Democrats appear deter-
mined to remake the Senate and de-
stroy the Supreme Court in the proc-
ess. 
The radical left sees Judge Barrett 
simply as collateral damage. She is an 
obstacle to be overcome, no matter the 
cost. That is why she is being attacked 
for her faith—for being an active mem-
ber of her church, for participating 
fully. 
She is being attacked as a mother, 
being attacked for her religious beliefs. 
The far left, in their haste to attack 
the judge, never mention that she has 
seven children. Now, two of those seven 
children were adopted from Haiti. One 
of her children has special needs. Judge 
Barrett is a full-time caregiver, as well 
as a public servant. She understands 
the importance of healthcare. She un-
derstands how precious life is. She is 
an outstanding nominee. 
Two years ago, we considered an-
other nominee for the Supreme Court. 
Democrats dragged him through the 
mud. We witnessed a gangland char-
acter assassination. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if we see the same thing happen 
again, and the far left is already de-
manding it. 
They are demanding that mud con-
tinue to be thrown at this nominee 
until it sticks—something, anything to 
undermine her character and to under-
mine her credibility. 
Now, I might remind my friends what 
the outcome of that seek-and-destroy 
mission was the last time. Justice 
Kavanaugh’s family was put through 
the meat grinder, and Republicans 
stood by him. He was confirmed by the 
Senate and sits on the Supreme Court. 
The Senate and the American people 
will not stand for more political gains.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5912 
September 30, 2020 
We will not accept the dirty tricks that 
the far left is going to continue to try 
to pull. 
Chairman 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM
has 
promised a fair process in the Judici-
ary Committee. The majority leader 
has indicated full and fair consider-
ation on the Senate floor. We will not 
yield an inch to the mob. 
Let me be even clearer. If Democrats 
continue to smear this outstanding 
nominee, this mother of seven, this 
woman of faith, it is going to backfire 
on them again. They continue such 
stunts at their own peril. 
After the Kavanaugh confirmation 
devolved into a circus, Democrats lost 
seats in the Senate, and they lost 
credibility with the public. 
The American people expect fairness. 
They demand it for the highest Court 
in the land, and Senate Republicans 
will ensure it. We will ensure Judge 
Barrett is fairly treated. She deserves 
dignity and respect, and we will ensure 
that she is heard. 
Amy Coney Barrett appears to have 
all the qualities I look for in a Su-
preme Court Justice. She is a model of 
integrity, intelligence, and of judicial 
independence. She is highly qualified 
for the role to which she is nominated, 
and she will receive a fair vote in the 
U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Minnesota. 
HEALTHCARE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
am here today to make clear what is at 
stake if the Supreme Court overturns 
the Affordable Care Act in the middle 
of this global pandemic. 
This is something the Trump admin-
istration has been trying for, for years. 
It came out of a case in Texas, and 
they brought it all the way now to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
It has been over 9 months since the 
United States had its first confirmed 
case of the coronavirus. Now we have 
over 7 million cases and, tragically, 
over 200,000 people have died. 
It has been 9 months but still we do 
not have a national testing strategy in 
place—something that would not only 
save lives but also would be a great 
help in having the ability to open our 
economy again. 
We don’t have sufficient contact 
tracing or clear guidance to schools 
and businesses of how to keep their 
students, employees, and customers 
safe. 
Nearly 30 million people are out of 
work, and today many are still strug-
gling to pay their rent and put food on 
the table for their families. 
Millions of kids are sometimes going 
to school in hybrid models—in for a few 
days, out of a few days. They are learn-
ing to use Zoom. First graders—one of 
my staff members in Minnesota, her 
first grade daughter is learning the 
mute and unmute button. 
But instead of being honest with the 
American people about how serious 
this was, we have had a President who 
hid the truth about how deadly the 
virus is and how it spreads. 
This is personal to me. When the 
President was telling the American 
people that this was all going to go 
away; that it was going to go away by 
Easter, at the same time that he knew, 
we now know, that it was deadly; that 
he knew that it was airborne, when my 
family was just trying to wash off all 
of the counters and wash your hands, 
which is still a good idea, but we 
thought that would be the way to keep 
ourselves safe, this President didn’t 
share that information. 
And my husband, early on, got very, 
very sick from the virus. He ended up 
in the hospital with severe pneumonia 
and on oxygen. So, for me, it is per-
sonal. But guess what. It is personal to 
nearly everyone in America because 
they know someone—a friend, a family 
member who has died or who has got-
ten sick. 
Now, in my husband’s case, thanks to 
the brave frontline workers and the 
nurses and the hospital and the doc-
tors, and thanks to the fluke—it is just 
serendipity if people are able to survive 
this or not, depending on how hard-hit 
they are. Our story isn’t unique, and 
many other people who went to the 
hospital didn’t come home, and we now 
know this has inordinately hit front-
line workers and inordinately hit peo-
ple of color. 
So here we are, so many months later 
and well over 100 days after the House 
first passed the Heroes Act—legislation 
to provide true funding for testing, 
help State and local governments go 
through this time, to make sure our 
elections are safe during this pan-
demic—and still we wait. 
And while I am encouraged that 
Speaker PELOSI is, once again, negoti-
ating after she and Senator SCHUMER 
had met with the White House, met 
with the majority leader of this Sen-
ate, offered to go halfway, that was re-
jected, and still people kept dying. I 
think something like 800 businesses 
closed a day. Hundreds of people are 
dying a day. 
So now they are at it again. Speaker 
PELOSI is coming up with a new plan 
that is significantly less funding but 
one that we hope has a glimmer of 
hope. But this has not been a priority 
in this place. 
Instead, the plan is to spend the next 
few weeks jamming through a nominee 
to the Supreme Court. What is the 
rush? Why not focus on working to-
gether to help the American people get 
through this pandemic? Why not focus 
on getting a bunch of the bills done 
that have been sitting on the majority 
leader’s 
desk, 
like 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act? That is sitting 
there. Why not take some action on 
climate change? That is sitting there 
as the fires are blazing on the west 
coast. Why not do something about 
pharmaceutical prices—something the 
President has claimed to be trying to 
do something about in the last month 
of his administration. 
Well, another challenge to the Af-
fordable Care Act is going to be back 
up before the Supreme Court just 1 
week after the election on November 
10. Do you think that has anything to 
do with this rush to a Justice? Is that 
what it is? Because it is right after the 
election. 
Otherwise, why wouldn’t you wait? 
See who wins the election. That is 
what Abraham Lincoln did—the only 
time in history a Justice died this 
close to an election. He waited to see 
who won. 
But, no, we are told this has to hap-
pen now, despite the fact that only a 
few years ago a completely different 
precedent was set by the majority of 
people who are serving in this Senate 
right now on the Republican side of the 
aisle. 
But what is coming up November 10? 
The case. The Affordable Care Act or, 
as they like to call it, ObamaCare. I al-
ways love that President Obama was 
more than happy to adopt the name for 
the bill, given that the bill has become 
more and more popular, given that it 
has helped hundreds of thousands of 
people to get insurance, given that it 
has helped, more than that, millions of 
people to not be kicked off their insur-
ance. 
You don’t have to be in one of those 
exchanges to be protected by the Af-
fordable Care Act, which basically says 
that if you have a preexisting condi-
tion, whether it is diabetes, Alz-
heimer’s, or cancer, that you cannot be 
kicked off of your health insurance. 
That applies to everyone in America, 
with that bill. 
There are people in the Senate, right 
here, who have been trying to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act—trying to do 
it for years. They had a big debate over 
it. That didn’t work. That didn’t work 
because John McCain walked in. I can 
still picture him right now walking in 
that door and saying no. All he would 
say was that he wasn’t going to deny 
healthcare coverage to people because 
he had it himself. 
So then they tried again—went down 
to Texas and found a court down there 
maybe that they thought would be 
helpful. And guess what. Then it gets 
struck down there—not just a part of 
it. They said no, no, no. They made it 
the whole thing. That is what is com-
ing up to the Supreme Court on No-
vember 10. So if you can’t get your way 
one way, the administration decided 
they were going to try it in court. It is 
their lawyers—their lawyers—who ar-
gued this, Donald Trump’s lawyers. 
They have been trying to get rid of 
the Affordable Care Act and the protec-
tions it provides for people with pre-
existing conditions for years, but have 
we seen an alternative plan from this 
President? No, we have not. 
That last time, when we saw that ef-
fort by my colleagues to repeal the 
healthcare law, it would have kicked 11 
million people off of Medicaid, it would 
have let insurance companies charge

people more if they got sick, and it in-
cluded an age tax, where an older per-
son could have been charged five times 
more than a younger person. 
That was the plan we saw before. 
That plan was opposed by every major 
group you trust when it comes to your 
healthcare, the largest groups of doc-
tors, nurses, seniors, hospitals, people 
with cancer, Alzheimer’s, lung disease, 
heart disease, diabetes. They said it 
was the worst bill for the people of this 
country. 
There was never even a vote on that 
bill because it was so unpopular. That 
was, of course, just months after that 
previous effort I just described where 
John McCain walked into the Chamber 
and gave the repeal of the Affordable 
Care Act, which would have taken 
healthcare away from so many Ameri-
cans, a big no. 
Senator McCain believed that cour-
age is not just standing by yourself, 
giving a speech to an empty Chamber, 
like I happen to be doing right now, so 
thank you, the 10 people who are here. 
It is not just that. It is whether you 
are willing to stand next to someone 
whom you don’t always agree with for 
the betterment of this country. 
But that is not what we are seeing 
here. Indeed, my colleagues have not 
been able to succeed in repealing the 
healthcare law using the legislative 
process. The administration has turned 
to the courts. 
Let’s look at the track record. I like 
looking at evidence, as a former pros-
ecutor. Even before he was elected, the 
President promised that his judicial 
appointment ‘‘will do the right thing’’ 
and overturn the Affordable Care Act. 
He has criticized the sitting Chief Jus-
tice, Justice Roberts, for upholding the 
law when it was last before the Court. 
Just days ago he said on Twitter that 
it would be a ‘‘big win’’ if the Supreme 
Court strikes down the health law. 
Now, with Americans already voting, 
the President is trying to jam through 
a nominee who has already voiced seri-
ous opposition to upholding the Afford-
able Care Act. The same year that this 
nominee became a judge—that would 
be in 2017; she was confirmed in Octo-
ber—she published an article with the 
University of Minnesota Law School 
Journal—a pretty good journal—writ-
ing that she believed Chief Justice 
Roberts—this was her criticism of the 
Chief Justice—‘‘pushed the Affordable 
Care Act beyond its plausible meaning 
to save the statute.’’ 
If President Trump’s nominee is con-
firmed before oral arguments on No-
vember 10, yes, she could easily cast 
the deciding vote to strike down the 
law in its entirety. The American peo-
ple know what that will mean to them. 
To start, protection for people with 
preexisting conditions like diabetes or 
asthma would be gone. More than 100 
million Americans have a preexisting 
condition, and the Affordable Care Act 
makes sure they cannot be denied in-
surance coverage or charged signifi-
cantly higher premiums. 
Before the ACA—and I remember this 
because we debated it in this very 
Chamber—43 States allowed insurers to 
charge higher premiums to people with 
preexisting conditions. We can’t go 
back to that. 
Without the Affordable Care Act, 
health insurance exchanges, and the 
support for States to expand Medicaid, 
it is estimated that 20 million Ameri-
cans would lose their insurance. 
The ability to keep your kid on your 
insurance plan until they are 26 years 
old would be gone. How many parents 
are using this right now in the middle 
of this pandemic? I don’t know the 
number, but I know it is a lot. 
The work we have done to close the 
Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap 
for prescription drugs would be gone. 
The provisions that would help peo-
ple buy insurance on the healthcare ex-
changes would be gone in the middle of 
a global pandemic. 
Over 7 million Americans have been 
infected by the coronavirus, and the 
cases are rising. That is 7 million peo-
ple who, without the Affordable Care 
Act, could be found to have another 
preexisting condition, and that is 7 
million people who may have recovered 
from the virus, but, as Dr. Fauci has 
warned, they continue to struggle with 
a range of long-term effects that re-
quire comprehensive healthcare cov-
erage. 
So why? Why ram this through in 2 
weeks? Is it because that case is com-
ing up—if you read the President’s 
tweets, it makes you think it has a lot 
to do with it—or is it because of the al-
ternative theory he has put out there 
that he wants to make sure the Su-
preme Court is in place in order to de-
cide the election result? Neither of 
those theories is a reason to jam 
through a nominee, and my colleagues 
know it. 
I know that the people of this coun-
try see through this raw use of polit-
ical power. They know their healthcare 
is on the line. They know it is on the 
line. They know our environment is on 
the line. That is why they are voting. 
They are voting in droves. They are 
voting as we speak. They are casting 
ballots with each and every second we 
stand here in this Chamber. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, Wendy 
is a constituent of mine from Stanford, 
CT, and she tells a story that is going 
to sound incredibly familiar to folks 
who have been part of this healthcare 
debate over the last 10 years in this 
Chamber. She said: 
When my daughter was 15, she was diag-
nosed with a type of bone cancer and under-
went a year of treatment. We were hopeful 
that she was cured, but exactly 1 year ago— 
it was 2 months after she graduated from 
college and was about to move across the 
country to begin her career when she under-
went a routine checkup and found out that 
the cancer had returned. The past year has 
included 
more 
chemo, 
surgery, 
and 
immunotherapy. 
My daughter is now 23 years old, and she is 
the definition of a preexisting condition. She 
is still on our health plan, but we are already 
looking at the time in about 2 years when 
that will no longer be possible. Although she 
is at least feeling well enough to begin the 
job search again, there is no security for any 
of us without the existence of the Affordable 
Care Act as an option should she not have 
employer-based healthcare. She is a young 
woman who has already gone through so 
much in these short years. There are enough 
unknowns. Please continue— 
This is her writing to me— 
to protect the Affordable Care Act so she 
knows she has healthcare. 
President Trump last night contested 
the idea that 100 million Americans 
have 
preexisting 
conditions. 
Well, 
maybe he is right because most data 
suggests that the number is 130 million 
Americans who have some form of pre-
existing condition that, if insurance 
companies were allowed to, would ei-
ther result in rate hikes for them be-
cause of their diagnosis, or insurance 
would be made unavailable to them en-
tirely. 
Now, it has almost been 10 years 
since we lived in a world where insur-
ance 
companies 
could 
deny 
you 
healthcare because of a preexisting 
condition or could raise your rate sim-
ply because you are a woman. So for 
many Americans, it is even hard to re-
member those days in which you could 
be discriminated against just because 
of a childhood cancer. But those days 
are about to come back. We are lit-
erally 
months 
away, 
if 
President 
Trump 
is 
successful 
in 
ramming 
through this Supreme Court nominee, 
from insurance companies once again 
being able to deny coverage to anybody 
they want based upon their gender, 
based upon their medical history, based 
upon their prior diagnosis. 
This isn’t hyperbole because I have 
been in the Congress long enough to 
know two things. One, Republicans will 
stop at nothing in order to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act, and we will talk 
this afternoon about what that means 
beyond the 130 million Americans who 
will have their rates increased. But I 
know something else as well, which is 
that there is no replacement. There is 
nothing coming from the Republican 
majority in the Senate or from this ad-
ministration to replace the Affordable 
Care Act. Do you know why I know 
that? Because I have been waiting for 
the replacement for a decade, and it 
has never shown up because it never 
will. 
Republicans tried to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act here the first year of 
the President’s term. A lot of people 
said it was a foregone conclusion—of 
course, after having pledged to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act for 5 years, Re-
publicans now, with control of the Sen-
ate and the House and the White 
House, will of course make good on 
their promise. Of course, we know how 
that turned out. They couldn’t because 
the American people rose up. Phone 
lines lit up, townhall meetings ex-
ploded, and Republicans in the end

S5914 
September 30, 2020 
could not find the votes, even with ma-
jorities in both Houses and control of 
the White House, to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act. 
Well, then, Republicans said, let’s 
find another way. If we can’t use the 
most democratic process—legislation— 
in order to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, then let’s go to the courts. 
So Republican attorneys general filed 
a lawsuit seeking to overturn the en-
tirety of the Affordable Care Act on a 
legal premise that most mainstream 
scholars thought had no shot, but they 
weren’t counting on this President 
being able to pack the Court with 
enough extreme, rightwing jurists to 
accept the flawed argument. So the 
President 
started 
by 
putting 
Neil 
Gorsuch on the Court. He continued 
with Brett Kavanaugh. Now, one vote 
away from being able to overturn the 
Affordable Care Act, he now has a 
chance, with the nomination of Amy 
Coney Barrett, to finally get what he 
couldn’t get done in the elected branch 
of American government—the full re-
peal and elimination of the Affordable 
Care Act with nothing to replace it. 
It is not hyperbole because there is 
literally that case that I described get-
ting ready for argument before the Su-
preme Court a week after election day. 
So guess why it is so important that we 
confirm a Justice before election day— 
because they need the votes to invali-
date the Affordable Care Act shortly 
after the election occurs, and it be-
comes a little bit harder if that Justice 
is not there to hear the arguments in 
mid-November. 
Take Republicans at their word: 
They want the Affordable Care Act 
gone. Take Republicans at their word: 
They don’t have a replacement. 
It will be a humanitarian catastrophe 
in this country, in the middle of a pan-
demic—a pandemic that is killing 1,000 
people a day; 44,000 new infections that 
we know of on a daily basis—if 23 mil-
lion Americans lose access to insur-
ance. 
Remember, this lawsuit doesn’t ask 
for the Affordable Care Act to be elimi-
nated in pieces or over time; the rem-
edy it seeks is the Affordable Care Act 
gone, all of it, overnight. There are 23 
million Americans who rely on that 
and 260,000 in my State—the equivalent 
of 62 different towns in my State alone 
losing their health insurance. 
Don’t think that States are going to 
be able to pick up the pieces here. A lot 
of these folks are on Medicaid. Theo-
retically, States could decide to pick 
up the bill themselves, but they can’t 
because the President has forced States 
to foot the lion’s share of the bill for 
fighting COVID because of the failure 
to stand up a national response. So 
States have no money lying around in 
order to make up for all the people who 
are going to lose Medicaid access. 
There are 23 million people who can 
lose their insurance, potentially by the 
end of the year or early next year, if 
this Justice gets confirmed to the 
Court. 
But then, all those people with pre-
existing 
conditions—and, 
remember, 
we now have a new preexisting condi-
tion. That is COVID. What we are 
learning about COVID–19 is very, very 
worrying. Researchers have observed 
changes to the heart, the vascular sys-
tem, the lungs, the brain, the kidneys 
in those who have gotten sick, and 
even in many people who are asymp-
tomatic. In fact, there is a study out 
there right now that Dr. Fauci noted 
before the HELP Committee recently 
that shows 70 to 80 percent of people 
who have had COVID have some lasting 
damage to their heart. COVID is a pre-
existing condition. 
Now, you may think, I haven’t had 
COVID, so I am not at risk of that pre-
existing condition causing my rates to 
go up if Amy Coney Barrett gets con-
firmed to the Court. Well, you don’t 
know if you have had COVID or not, 
and let me tell you that insurance 
companies are not going to play dumb. 
If they are allowed to discriminate 
against you because you have COVID, 
then they are going to require you to 
prove that you haven’t had it before 
you get a policy. Millions and millions 
of Americans are going to have their 
rates increased or be denied healthcare 
at all because they had COVID, wheth-
er they were asymptomatic or sympto-
matic. That, in and of itself, is a 
healthcare crisis in this country. 
So the stakes of this debate over the 
nomination of this new Supreme Court 
Justice couldn’t be higher. Senator 
KLOBUCHAR talked about the fact that 
this Supreme Court may decide the 
outcome of this election, and that is a 
subject that we should explore at a dif-
ferent time. But 1 week after the elec-
tion, the Court will hear a case asking 
for the invalidation of the entire Af-
fordable Care Act. Republicans in the 
Senate and the White House have no 
plan to replace it, and if that case is 
successful, 23 million people are at risk 
of losing their health insurance: 11 mil-
lion who are on the exchanges; 12 mil-
lion who are covered by Medicaid; 133 
million Americans, roughly half of 
America’s population under the age of 
65, could have their rates increase be-
cause of preexisting conditions; 2 mil-
lion young people under the age of 26 
could be kicked off their parents’ 
health insurance; and 9 million people 
who receive Federal subsidies, tax 
credits, to buy private insurance would 
lose that coverage. 
In the midst of a global pandemic, a 
COVID diagnosis would possibly render 
you ineligible for insurance. That is a 
nightmare—a nightmare on top of the 
pandemic nightmare that we are living 
through currently. 
So we are on the floor today to make 
sure that our Senate Republican col-
leagues don’t distract the American 
public, don’t try to create controver-
sies around this nomination that don’t 
exist, and don’t try to put words in 
Democrats’ mouths. Listen to what we 
are saying. What we are saying is that 
this nomination is about the future of 
the American healthcare system, and 
every single Senator who votes to con-
firm Amy Coney Barrett to the Su-
preme Court, I believe, is voting to 
take insurance away from over 20 mil-
lion 
Americans, 
voting 
to 
render 
COVID a preexisting condition that re-
quires you to pay more for healthcare 
for the rest of your life, and going back 
to the days in which any preexisting 
condition could cause you to lose your 
health insurance and then lose every-
thing that you have saved up over dec-
ades and decades. 
Betty Burger is one of those people, 
and I will finish with her story. Betty 
Burger had good insurance through her 
husband her entire life. He changed 
jobs, and he had about a week’s period 
of time in which he didn’t have a job in 
between those two jobs and did not 
have healthcare. During that week, one 
of their kids was diagnosed with can-
cer, and it became a preexisting condi-
tion, such that the husband’s employ-
er’s healthcare plan wouldn’t cover it, 
and the Burgers lost everything—ev-
erything. They went bankrupt. They 
went through their savings. They went 
through the college fund. They lost 
their house. They lost everything. 
It has been a decade since any Amer-
ican has had to face that kind of finan-
cial ruin because of a diagnosis for 
them or their child. It is hard for us to 
remember those days, but they are 
coming back. They are coming back—I 
tell you this now—if this Supreme 
Court Justice is rammed through over 
the course of the next month. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join 
my colleague in coming to the floor to 
talk about what is at stake as the Sen-
ate considers who will fill the Supreme 
Court vacancy left by the passing of 
Justice Ginsburg. 
Justice Ginsburg was not only an ex-
traordinary legal mind, but she was an 
unwavering 
advocate 
for 
equality 
under the law. I believe she epitomized 
what we should seek in any Supreme 
Court Justice: a respect for the rule of 
law coupled with an understanding 
that our Constitution was designed to 
protect the rights of the many, not just 
the few. 
Unfortunately, President Trump and 
my colleagues across the aisle are 
doing a disservice to Justice Ginsburg’s 
legacy by attempting to rush through a 
nominee when the election is already 
underway. And that is not being dra-
matic. The fact is, we have 31 States, 
including my home State of New 
Hampshire, that have already begun 
distributing their absentee ballots. In 
fact, I was at a UPS distribution center 
in the city of Dover yesterday—actu-
ally it was on Monday—and I talked to 
several people there who showed me 
their absentee ballots because they had 
filled them out, and they were getting 
ready to mail them. 
So voting is already underway, and 
this is no ordinary election. It comes

during a global pandemic, when cities 
and towns are struggling to stay afloat 
and Americans are trying to figure out 
how they are going to continue to pay 
the rent and put food on the table. 
With more than 200,000 Americans, in-
cluding 439 Granite Staters who have 
died from COVID–19, we are still expe-
riencing as many as 40,000 new cases 
each day in this country. 
Our economy is struggling to get 
back on its feet. There are still 11.5 
million fewer workers employed since 
the pandemic began, and many are un-
able to go back to work because the 
majority of our childcare centers re-
main closed out of safety concerns. We 
still have so many schools, at least in 
New Hampshire, where the students are 
working from home. If they are lucky, 
they are going to school part time and 
working from home part time, but 
most of them are not back in school 
full time. 
Treatment and recovery centers are 
reporting that the overdose crisis has 
worsened because of the pandemic. In 
New Hampshire, where we saw in 2019 
for the first time in a number of years 
the overdose death rate began to fall, 
we are now seeing an increase again. 
We are also facing a looming eviction 
crisis and housing shortage that has 
been exacerbated by COVID–19. 
Yet, given this reality, what we are 
seeing in the Senate is not an effort to 
pass a bipartisan COVID–19 relief pack-
age that is actually going to help the 
millions who have been impacted by 
this pandemic. Instead, what we are 
seeing from the Republican leadership 
here is a focus on quickly ramming 
through a nominee to serve on the Su-
preme Court in just a few short weeks. 
While that is going on, we have seen 
Republican leadership in the Senate 
blocking bipartisan negotiations on a 
COVID–19 relief bill. That has been 
going on since May, when we received 
the House bill called the Heroes Act. 
During those last 4 months, businesses 
have been shuttered in New Hampshire 
and across this country; families have 
been evicted; hospitals have laid off 
staff. All of this is going on while the 
pandemic continues—more than 40,000 
new cases a day. 
Yesterday, I was in Nashua, the sec-
ond largest city in New Hampshire, and 
I met with leadership from St. Joseph 
Hospital there. It is one of two hos-
pitals in Nashua, and it is one of the 
four hospitals that has treated the 
most COVID cases of any of the hos-
pitals in New Hampshire. Nashua is one 
of the communities in New Hampshire 
that has been hardest hit by the 
coronavirus. 
What I heard at the hospital was that 
COVID–19 has had a huge impact on 
their facility. Despite the very much 
needed injection of funds from the 
CARES Act and assistance from the 
Medicare advance payments loan pro-
gram, they are still forecasting signifi-
cant losses. They have had to furlough 
employees, many of whom rely on their 
jobs at St. Joseph not just for their 
healthcare but also for their childcare 
benefits. 
They shared that they have concerns 
with the lack of availability of testing 
capability. They have had orders that 
never arrived at their facility, despite 
commitments from the companies who 
are selling the tests. 
But the leadership and the staff at 
St. Joseph remain committed to serv-
ing their community, as do all of the 
hospitals across New Hampshire, so 
many of whom are facing similar finan-
cial difficulties and need additional 
help from the Federal Government. 
I am hearing from people across my 
State who urgently need Federal help. 
I have had letters from people all 
across New Hampshire, representing 
different industries in the State and 
different segments of our communities. 
I want to read an excerpt from a letter 
that I received from Pamela Keilig, 
who works with the New Hampshire 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
She says: 
The pandemic has had grave consequences 
on the health and safety of survivors as they 
encounter ongoing barriers to accessing the 
support they need. . . . Overall, the state-
wide hotlines have seen a 7 percent increase 
in call volume compared to this time last 
year. 
Pamela’s letter goes on to highlight 
what is at stake if Congress refuses to 
act. She says: 
[P]rolonged inaction in providing addi-
tional funding places survivors and their 
families in increased jeopardy. . . . [T]he 
time to intervene is now. 
They need help now. 
I also want to read a letter from 
Chris Coates, who is the county admin-
istrator for Cheshire County in New 
Hampshire over in the western part of 
our 
State 
that 
borders 
Vermont. 
Chris’s letter describes the important 
role local governments are playing in 
mitigating the spread of COVID–19. He 
says: 
We are providing essential support and 
guidance to small businesses, record num-
bers of unemployed individuals, and those 
suffering from mental illness and substance 
abuse disorders. 
State and local leaders like Chris are 
facing 
severe 
budgetary 
shortfalls. 
They desperately need help from Con-
gress. The State of New Hampshire 
alone expects to experience a budget 
shortfall of nearly $540 million if Con-
gress doesn’t provide additional sup-
port. 
In his letter Chris Coates goes on to 
say: 
Cheshire County is not looking for a spe-
cial handout. My request reflects the simple 
reality that county governments, along with 
our state and local partners, are dealing with 
immense challenges at the community level. 
Then I also heard from the Seacoast 
Chamber Alliance, which represents 
chambers of commerce in the commu-
nities 
of 
Hampton, 
Exeter, 
Ports-
mouth, Dover, Somersworth, and Roch-
ester. The Chamber Alliance says: 
The Seacoast Chamber Alliance respect-
fully requests you and your colleagues in the 
Senate work together in a bipartisan effort 
to approve a comprehensive funding relief 
package to support our businesses. 
They go on to say: 
Although we—and our members—are grate-
ful for the support already allocated through 
previous CARES Act funding relief packages, 
we know this economic crisis caused by 
COVID–19 is far from over. And for many, the 
worst is yet to come. 
They finally conclude by saying: 
It is clear that without another round of 
assistance, many businesses will not survive 
into 2021. 
I ask unanimous consent that these 
letters, including the ones I just quoted 
from, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NEW HAMPSHIRE COALITION AGAINST 
DOMESTIC & SEXUAL VIOLENCE, 
September 18, 2020. 
Hon. JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR SHAHEEN: On behalf of the 
New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic 
and Sexual Violence and our 13 member pro-
grams, we are writing with the urgent re-
quest for additional COVID–19 relief funding 
to meet the continued and escalated needs of 
survivors of domestic and sexual violence in 
our state. Such funding is imperative to fur-
ther the life-saving work of our crisis cen-
ters, keep the lights on in our shelters, and 
help prevent violence in our communities. 
Over the last 6 months we have witnessed 
the full impact and extent of the pandemic 
unfold before us, and it is has become in-
creasingly evident that we have transitioned 
into a sustained crisis in New Hampshire, 
where every intersection of our work has 
been interrupted. Annually, our member pro-
grams serve more than 15,000 survivors 
through prevention education, court and 
hospital accompaniment, crisis counseling, 
and housing support. Crisis centers have 
worked tirelessly to adapt service delivery 
and transform their advocacy efforts under 
incredible circumstances. Despite the resil-
ience and innovation of crisis centers, long- 
term support is needed to maintain the work 
and respond effectively to the needs of sur-
vivors and their families. 
The pandemic has had grave consequences 
on the health and safety of survivors as they 
encounter ongoing barriers to accessing the 
support they need, while simultaneously ex-
periencing more severe and lethal cases of 
violence and abuse. Crisis centers remain in-
undated with service demands as abusers 
continue to utilize new ways to leverage 
power and control, noting an increase in 
calls from Child Advocacy Centers, male sur-
vivors of domestic violence, and individuals 
experiencing mental health crises. Overall, 
the statewide hotlines have seen a 7 percent 
increase in call volume compared to last 
year. Moreover, victims of domestic violence 
and sexual assault have a higher vulner-
ability to homelessness, substance abuse, 
and poverty compared to the general popu-
lation, requiring a greater number of inter-
ventions. 
New Hampshire’s housing crisis has made 
it increasingly difficult to place survivors in 
transitional or permanent housing, and this 
has been exacerbated since March. In 2019, 
well before a global pandemic was on our 
radar, crisis centers provided shelter for over 
400 survivors, accounting for more than 
40,000 bed nights, and even then, had to turn 
away more than 3,000 adult and child sur-
vivors due to the lack of available services. 
Advocates have reported an increased need 
for housing support, as survivors experience

job loss and threat of homelessness due to vi-
olence at home. Most shelters across the 
state have remained at capacity since the 
start of the pandemic, utilizing hotels to 
house additional victims, often for extended 
stays lasting several weeks at a time. Crisis 
centers remain deeply concerned about the 
consequences of not having enough housing 
support, especially as we move into winter. 
Despite added efforts to help domestic vio-
lence and stalking victims access the legal 
system, there has been a severe decrease in 
the number of protective orders filed com-
pared to last year. In a state where over 50 
percent of Lethality Assessment screenings 
represent high risk of fatality, and where do-
mestic violence is a factor in nearly half of 
all homicides, there is an essential need to 
ensure that survivors are able to access 
every resource available to them, and re-
ceive the support needed to navigate the 
legal system during a public health crisis. 
The continued challenges that survivors 
face in accessing vital services cannot be 
overstated; prolonged inaction in providing 
additional funding places survivors and their 
families in increased jeopardy. At the onset 
of the pandemic, crisis centers quickly iden-
tified the immediate loss of funding due to 
COVID–19 as annual fundraisers had to be 
cancelled. It is projected that the total loss 
of revenue for all 13 member programs will 
be over one million dollars. This has required 
member programs to tap into unrestricted 
funding in order to meet the increased serv-
ice demands and needs of survivors, leaving 
crisis centers with limited funding to cover 
basic operating costs. Crisis center staff have 
been running an endless marathon over the 
last six months and are in great need for 
Congress to rally behind them. 
As we continue to acknowledge the full im-
pact of COVID–19 on our field, we would be 
exceedingly grateful for further federal fund-
ing to help us weather this storm. Centering 
the needs and experiences of survivors in fu-
ture relief packages would be instrumental 
to the individuals that crisis centers serve 
throughout the country. Survivors will feel 
the impact of this pandemic on their lives 
for months to come; the time to intervene is 
now. 
Thank you for your continued dedication 
to supporting survivors in New Hampshire, 
and throughout the United States. 
Sincerely, 
PAMELA KEILIG, 
Public Policy Specialist. 
SEPTEMBER 22, 2020. 
Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR
SHAHEEN: The Seacoast 
Chamber Alliance respectfully requests that 
you and your colleagues in the Senate work 
together in a bipartisan effort to approve a 
comprehensive funding relief package to sup-
port our businesses. 
Although we—and our members—are grate-
ful for the support already allocated through 
previous CARES Act funding relief packages, 
we know this economic crisis caused by 
COVID–19 is far from over. And for many, the 
worst is yet to come. 
As we head into the winter months, many 
are seeing continued declines in business 
over concerns about a surge in coronavirus 
cases during what is typically the season for 
flu and other illnesses. 
Our restaurants and hospitality industry 
in particular are seeing a lack of consumer 
confidence in dining indoors. Restaurants 
are often ‘destination businesses’ that at-
tract patrons not just to their own business 
but serve as an attraction for other busi-
nesses located nearby. Downtown business 
districts rely heavily on restaurants to bring 
customers to the area and help to support 
numerous other businesses such as retailers 
and service-oriented businesses. The loss of 
restaurants will create a ripple effect that 
will be catastrophic to downtown business 
districts resulting in the closing of many 
other small businesses, loss of jobs and 
empty buildings. 
Although hospitality businesses are facing 
an urgent need due to the change of season, 
many other businesses are still in need of as-
sistance as well. Supply chain delays, slower 
mail and shipping services and lower cus-
tomer spending are resulting in businesses 
seeing lower revenues and higher costs for 
materials across all sectors. A great many of 
our businesses are not able to operate at full 
capacity and are furloughing employees as a 
result. 
Feedback from some of our members is 
below. It is clear that without another round 
of assistance, many businesses will not sur-
vive into 2021. Please urge the Senate to vote 
on a bipartisan bill and send the relief need-
ed to ensure our business community’s sur-
vival. 
Thank you for your consideration.

FEEDBACK FROM MEMBERS 
From a small independent restaurant: 
Most people are getting to a point that even 
if congress needs to piecemeal a deal, we 
need to get some funding. Those parts of the 
package that everyone agrees upon should be 
funded, leaving aside that which is conten-
tious. MUST be funded now. To hold up the 
funding to small business, while the other 
funding is being debated, isn’t helping any-
one at all. Could help many small businesses 
by getting the funding out as quickly as pos-
sible. At the end of the day, stop holding out 
for everything, agree on common ground, get 
it done, and get the funds out to those who 
desperately need it. 
From a downtown Retail & Commercial 
Real Estate: I’m concerned that the level of 
additional funding that Sen. Shaheen is sup-
porting may be more than necessary for 
most circumstances and, more importantly, 
will certainly add even more to the huge 
debt that we are already leaving on the 
shoulders of the younger generations. I sug-
gest that they stop holding out to get every-
thing, but get SOMETHING—those things 
they agree upon now—so our businesses can 
stay in business. They can argue about the 
contentious items later, which may or may 
not happen. 
From a Historic Museum: By our inter-
actions, based here at the historic museum, 
on common interests in our past and our cul-
tural heritage, we have played a significant 
part in creating and maintaining a vibrant 
economy. 
With 
our 
physical 
distance, 
though, our places in the economy have 
evaporated. In the absence of the PPP loan 
program, it seems doubtful that our organi-
zation would have been able to cover our 
payroll costs this summer, and our prospects 
are looking increasingly dim if the federal 
government does not provide additional 
funding to ensure the sustainability of essen-
tial community organizations like ours. Cul-
tural and historic nonprofits are key to the 
local tourism economy, and to the economy 
of the region. We urge New Hampshire’s leg-
islators to support additional federal support 
for our community, and our economy. 
From a Catering Company: Our challenges 
lie in people not being able to gather. Limits 
on indoor get-togethers and events are our 
main difficulty. Our corporate catering ac-
counts have all but dried up due to people 
working remotely and not going into their 
offices. Our wedding business is about half of 
what it was last year and that will all end in 
early November. Previous events that we had 
scheduled, like being an in house caterer for 
a private club in Portsmouth, will not be 
gathering and thus a loss of over $45,000 for 
the winter season. We have come up with 
some creative ways to bring in revenue but 
we will likely fall far short of the $20,000 we 
need monthly for occupancy and to pay our 
full-time staff. When we discuss our outlook 
for the next 6 months, it’s looking for ways 
to survive that next 6 months. It will be very 
challenging and will likely cause us to go 
further into debt to maintain everything. ca-
tering service and function hall. 
From a History Museum/Attraction: The 
museum’s fiscal year ends on March 31st—we 
project a $180,000 operating deficit. Up to this 
point we have been able to keep year-round 
staff [27] fully employed and a reasonable 
amount of programming, mostly focused on 
serving the schools. To reduce costs we hired 
far fewer seasonal employees [last year we 
had about 65 part-time seasonal staff, this 
year a dozen.] Looking to 2021—I anticipate 
that we will continue to run a significant 
deficit. This may result in some furloughing 
of some staff and reduction in programs, es-
pecially special events that draw such large 
crowds to the city. No matter if the pan-
demic is under control with a vaccine or bet-
ter treatments, tourism will be down and 
philanthropy will be depleted for the most 
part because of donor fatigue and signifi-
cantly reduced funds. I think 2021 will be 
much harder for tourist—based businesses 
and cultural organizations. Unless there is a 
significant change, older and middle age peo-
ple [a major part of our audience] will not 
travel in great numbers because of reduced 
funds or their reluctance to spend because of 
the fluctuating economy. 
From a 501(c)(6) Membership Art Associa-
tion: As a non-profit organization, we really 
need all the help we can get to stay in exist-
ence. As an art oriented organization, we are 
finding it extremely challenging to get 
grants and do other fund raising because 
much of the money available in grants, 
(other than the governor’s main street 
funds), and from individuals, seems to be 
prioritized to more social oriented non-prof-
its—such as food banks, homeless shelters, 
etc. We certainly realize these are very im-
portant at this time, but we also have to 
have the ability for other nonprofits to get 
funding assistance. We have had to reinvent 
the way we do business by moving more of it 
online, which has meant increased staff 
costs, and software expenditures so things 
remain a challenge for us. 
From an Amusement Attraction: Thank 
you for spearheadng this. I have to tell you, 
this may be the most important battle we 
have had to wage collectively. This is the 
first time I’ve stopped and put what we are

dealing with and what it could very well 
mean for my family and our business into 
words. The result? I cried for an hour. Please 
fight for us. 
From a Cultural/Tourist destination: We 
were closed for our 2020 season (this weekend 
would have been our closing weekend!). This 
resulted in the loss of over $3 million in in-
come, and while we were able to reduce our 
expenses by $1.7 million, we still face a mas-
sive challenge this year, and uncertainty 
about the status of our 2021 season. We did 
receive both a PPP loan (which we antici-
pate will be fully forgiven) and a NERF 
grant, which made a big difference for us— 
but even this amazing support (totaling over 
$800K!) didn’t cover our losses for this fiscal 
year. However, nobody knows what is going 
to happen next year. We are in the process of 
considering benefit reductions, furloughs, 
and possibly even layoffs for early 2021, de-
pending on what happens. If an effective vac-
cine is widely available and administered by 
May or June (which is seeming less and less 
likely, we will be able to open safely. Having 
said that, we can’t wait till June to make 
tough decisions—so even if we can open, we 
need 
additional 
support 
in 
the 
winter 
months. And if we can’t open, we need even 
more support. I can’t imagine where we 
would be without the PPP loan and NERF 
grant this year. If a vaccine isn’t forth-
coming, we could be in the exact same posi-
tion next year, and would be looking for a 
similar amount of funding. Star is open to 
the public and welcomes nearly 20,000 people 
a year. We consider ourselves stewards of 
this NH treasure, we are grateful with the 
funding we received in 2020, and we know 
that without continued support, our ability 
to continue to welcome guests and protect 
this important NH resource would be in jeop-
ardy. Senator Shaheen has been an effective 
advocate for our nonprofit organization (and 
many others), and I am happy she is con-
tinuing this fight. 
COUNTY OF CHESHIRE, 
September 25, 2020. 
Hon. JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR SHAHEEN: I write to you 
today in my position as County Adminis-
trator for Cheshire County to first and fore-
most thank you for your leadership, guid-
ance and advocacy on this seemingly never- 
ending COVID–19 journey. 
In the early days of COVID–19 your voice of 
calm reassurance allowed us to know that we 
had a friend in Washington and you and your 
staff provided us valuable guidance in the 
early days of this virus. That guidance 
helped us deal with this tsunami of a pan-
demic that came down upon our commu-
nities and up-ended our lives. 
Your leadership in Washington has helped 
Cheshire County receive funding for PPE, 
stipends for our nursing home, sheriff’s depu-
ties and Department of Corrections. We have 
received funding to cover for lost revenues at 
our nursing home and unemployment bene-
fits for those in-need living in Cheshire 
County. This is just a short list of the work 
you have done on behalf of the citizens of 
Cheshire County and I thank-you. 
When Cheshire County needed you, you 
were there, and continue to be today. As the 
impact of the pandemic endures, the resi-
dents of Cheshire County continue to feel the 
devastating impact on our health and eco-
nomic structures. The Delivering Immediate 
Relief to America’s Families, Schools and 
Small Businesses Act which was voted down 
yesterday, fell short in many areas but espe-
cially for counties due to the lack of pro-
viding direct flexible relief to counties, cities 
and towns of all sizes. 
At a time when so many Cheshire County 
citizens are serving on the front lines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and as we move closer 
to 2021 with so many unknown fiscal reali-
ties, I was extremely disappointed that the 
new supplemental aid package being consid-
ered in the U.S. Senate left out new fiscal re-
lief or flexibility for county governments. 
As you look to the next stimulus or 
CARES Act funding, I urge you to work with 
the White House and leaders of both parties 
in the House and Senate to resume negotia-
tions on a bipartisan relief package that pro-
vides this missing direct, flexible aid to 
counties, cities and towns. With national 
numbers showing that last week that 1.7 mil-
lion Americans filed new jobless and unem-
ployment claims, we now stand with 30 mil-
lion Americans out of work. 
If a new stimulus agreement is not reached 
prior to the seating of the new congress the 
fiscal ramification could be devastating. 
Counties could be looking at tax payments 
from towns and cities that may be substan-
tial short of normal revenues and services 
that are dictated by state statute may need 
to be immediately reduced. A stimulus pack-
age that allows municipalities to utilize fed-
eral funding to offset lost revenue could ad-
vert what may be a pending catastrophe for 
not just Cheshire County but the country. 
Cheshire County is not looking for a spe-
cial handout. My request reflects the simple 
reality that county governments, along with 
our state and local partners, are dealing with 
immense challenges at the community level. 
Local governmental bodies are playing a 
significant role in mitigating the spread of 
the COVID–19 virus. We are providing essen-
tial support and guidance to small busi-
nesses, record numbers of unemployed indi-
viduals, and those suffering from mental ill-
nesses and substance use disorders. We re-
main steadfast in our focus to protect our 
most vulnerable residents such as at-risk 
children and seniors. 
We understand the need for appropriate 
public accountability standards, and the 
oversight guardrails that are in place for the 
existing and proposed legislation, and we 
will meet those expectations. 
Our goal is to always ensure that all fed-
eral resources are utilized wisely and respon-
sibly at the local level to address the imme-
diate and far-reaching impacts of the current 
pandemic, and to make our nation more re-
silient and safer at the individual commu-
nity level. 
I therefore request, with the utmost re-
spect and gratitude for your tireless and 
steadfast work during this pandemic, that 
you continue to fight and advocate to your 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
The urgency to agree upon a stimulus bill 
prior to the new year that will address the 
needs of the counties, cities and towns in the 
State of New Hampshire cannot be stressed 
strongly enough. The ability to access flexi-
ble funding that allows municipal bodies to 
address revenue shortfalls will strengthen all 
of our communities, but especially Cheshire 
County. 
Again, thank you for your voice in Wash-
ington, you make a difference. 
CHRISTOPHER C. COATES, 
County Administrator. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. So in the middle of 
this pandemic, the likes of which we 
haven’t seen in more than 100 years, 
what we see here in the Senate is that 
Majority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
has 
prioritized moving a nominee who 
would enable the Court to strip away 
critical health protections that keep 
Americans safe. 
Instead of providing more resources 
for the businesses, the hospitals, the 
healthcare providers, and the people 
who have lost their jobs—instead of 
providing more resources for them, the 
majority is hoping to confirm a nomi-
nee who would strike down healthcare 
coverage for people, including those 
with preexisting conditions. 
My colleague from Connecticut, Sen-
ator MURPHY, was very eloquent in 
talking about what the impact of strik-
ing down the Affordable Care Act will 
be. But the fundamental concern is 
that, instead of working together here 
to help Americans who are struggling 
with this pandemic, what the majority 
has chosen to do, what the Republicans 
in this Chamber have chosen to do, is 
to ram through a nominee who threat-
ens to erode these fundamental rights 
while in the Court. 
Right now, Granite Staters and all 
Americans need the Senate to work for 
them, not for a partisan agenda to 
radicalize the Supreme Court. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to set aside this effort 
and to work together for the American 
people to get people the help they so 
desperately need. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to condemn President Trump’s 
refusal to denounce White supremacy 
during last night’s Presidential debate. 
At a time when this Nation is having 
a profound discussion about race—with 
anti-Semitism rearing its ugly head 
here in the United States and around 
the globe and the Nation being torn 
apart over political differences—our 
leaders, particularly our President, 
must call out hate in all its forms. 
Last night, the President failed to 
rise to the occasion, and he failed the 
American people in doing so. On the 
global stage in the year 2020, the leader 
of the free world gave an unequivocal 
wink and nod to White supremacists, 
racists, and neo-Nazis, all while the 
Nation and the world looked on in ab-
solute horror. 
Not only did the President of our 
United States not condemn the White 
supremacist violence that he has in-
cited during his tenure, he implicitly 
gave them marching orders. 
When asked to condemn the hate 
group, the Proud Boys, the President of 
the United States said that they should 
‘‘stand back and stand by.’’ Let me re-
peat. He gave the order for them to 
‘‘stand back and stand by.’’ 
There is no justification for his words 
or for his refusal to give a clear, direct, 
and swift condemnation of White su-
premacy. 
The President’s emboldening of vio-
lent extremists comes just as the FBI 
and Department of Homeland Security 
named White supremacist extremists 
as the most significant terrorism-re-
lated threat right here in the United 
States. 
As a member of the Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee, I heard the FBI Director testify

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5918 
September 30, 2020 
to this very point just last week. The 
message was clear: White supremacists 
pose a dangerous and violent threat to 
our homeland. 
Against this backdrop, the Presi-
dent’s shocking remarks last night 
were, in fact, a continuation of deeply 
disturbing patterns of racist and anti- 
Semitic behavior that this President 
has allowed to take place on his watch. 
Three years ago in Charlottesville, 
violent chaos and hatred were on full 
display for the world to see. As neo- 
Nazis openly marched in the streets, 
they chanted: ‘‘Jews will not replace 
us’’ and ‘‘blood and soil.’’ 
President Trump not only didn’t de-
nounce this anti-Semitic and racist 
rhetoric, he did something much worse. 
He did something much worse. He 
praised the White nationalists. He 
praised them as ‘‘very fine people.’’ 
These were not very fine people. 
Just last month, a teen vigilante 
asked his mother to drive him across 
State lines to the protests in Kenosha 
with a rifle. He went there to use it, 
and, in fact, he did. He took the life of 
two people and shot a third. He has 
been charged with homicide and right-
ly so. Instead of condemning this act of 
hatred, President Trump has hailed 
this murderer as a ‘‘hero.’’ 
But this is the norm for President 
Trump. The President’s use of dog 
whistles and charged language gives a 
voice to White supremacy and empow-
ers vigilantes. It is inexcusable, and it 
is indefensible. 
This rise in hatred that the President 
fails to condemn is one of the reasons 
why, last year, I cofounded the Senate 
Bipartisan Task Force for Combating 
Anti-Semitism. The goal of this bipar-
tisan, nonpartisan endeavor is to help 
stop hate before it starts, to call out 
bigotry and anti-Semitism wherever we 
see it—left, right, or center. I am proud 
of the work that we have done so far to 
push back on anti-Semitism right here 
in the United States, in Europe, in the 
Middle East, and around the world. 
But the President’s silence and his 
disturbing call to arms to White su-
premacist groups like the Proud Boys 
make our work that much harder. 
Some of the President’s defenders 
often write off his most troubling 
statements, claiming the President 
misspoke or that we just don’t under-
stand what he is trying to say or that 
is his speaking style or that he is just 
joking. 
Let me be clear. He didn’t misspeak 
last night. He didn’t make a joke last 
night. And regardless of what others 
say, words matter. His words matter. 
He is the President of the United 
States. 
Let me say today, as the President 
should have said last night—and I in-
vite all of my colleagues here in this 
Chamber to join me in repeating this 
statement: I condemn White nation-
alism; I condemn racism; I condemn 
anti-Semitism; and I condemn and de-
nounce the groups that promote these 
vile ideologies, the Proud Boys among 
them. 
We must speak out, and we must 
take action. I urge my colleagues, 
again, on both sides of the aisle, not to 
be complicit in their silence. I want 
them all to join me. I want you all to 
join me in denouncing White suprem-
acy, as President Trump failed to do, 
clearly and explicitly, in last night’s 
debate. 
This is not a partisan issue. It never 
will be a partisan issue. 
I hope all my colleagues join me in 
denouncing hatred in all forms. 
I yield back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION 
INFORMATION ACT OF 2019 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to, in 
a minute, ask unanimous consent to 
call up and pass the Intercountry 
Adoption Information Act of 2019, but 
first let me say that this is a strong bi-
partisan bill that was first introduced 
in March of 2019, with Senators CARDIN, 
BLUNT, KLOBUCHAR, TILLIS, BROWN, and 
WICKER as original cosponsors. When 
the House considered its version of the 
bill last year, it passed 397 to 0. Let re-
peat that, 397 to 0. No House Member 
objected to it. 
Our country is divided on many 
issues right now, but one thing that 
unites most of us is the belief that all 
children deserve to grow up in a perma-
nent, loving home. This is a matter of 
justice and recognizing the intrinsic 
dignity in every human being. Many, 
many Americans have done more than 
just hold this belief; they have acted on 
it, adopting children both domestically 
and internationally. 
According to the most recent avail-
able statistics, however, intercountry 
adoption has dramatically declined in 
recent years. Last year, fewer than 
3,000 children were adopted in the 
United States—down from nearly 23,000 
in 2004. There are numerous reasons for 
this decline, many of which warrant 
continued efforts to ensure that orphan 
children are given the chance to grow 
up in a loving home, whether in their 
own country or here in the United 
States. 
We must address any barriers by ex-
amining our own policies and how they 
are implemented and by working inter-
nationally to help more children grow 
up in families. 
Each year, the State Department re-
leases its annual report on inter-
country adoptions—a key document 
that keeps families, adoption agencies, 
and policymakers informed about the 
state of adoption. The report is pub-
licly available, and it includes, among 
other things, the number of inter-
country adoptions involving immigra-
tion to the United States and the coun-
try from which each child emigrates, 
the time required for completion of the 
adoption, and the information on the 
adoption agencies, their fees, and their 
work. 
But to better tackle this issue, we 
need to provide more transparency and 
accountability about some of the crit-
ical 
factors 
affecting 
intercountry 
adoption. The Intercountry Adoption 
Information Act adds additional key 
elements to this report by requiring 
the State Department to provide infor-
mation on, one, countries that have en-
acted policies to prevent adoptions 
from the United States; two, actions 
the State Department has taken which 
have prevented adoptions to the United 
States; and, three, for each of these, 
how the State Department has worked 
to encourage the resumption of inter-
country adoptions. 
There are children around the world 
whose only chance to grow up in a fam-
ily is through the Intercountry Adop-
tion Program. There are families in the 
United States who are eager to open 
their arms, their homes, their hearts to 
these children. 
I ask unanimous consent, at this 
time, to call up and pass H.R. 1952, to 
further 
transparency 
accountability 
and to ensure we are working toward 
the goal of enabling all children to 
have families which love them. I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 1952 and the House proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1952) to amend the Inter-
country Adoption Act of 2000 to require the 
Secretary of State to report on intercountry 
adoptions from countries which have signifi-
cantly reduced adoption rates involving im-
migration to the United States, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

SENATOR KAY HAGAN AIRPORT 
TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I now 
would like to talk about a special 
project in North Carolina which in-
volves my former partner from North 
Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan. 
We are currently in the process of 
building a brand-new FAA tower at the 
Piedmont Triad International Airport 
in Greensboro, NC. The bill before us

September 30, 2020 
would name the currently under-con-
struction air traffic tower after Sen-
ator Kay Hagan. 
The late Senator Hagan worked tire-
lessly to secure the funding for the new 
tower, and it will serve as a fitting 
tribute to her legacy as a Senator and 
her work on behalf of the citizens of 
North Carolina. 
Once completed in 2022, the 180-foot 
tower will not only provide a state-of- 
the-art traffic facility for PTI Airport 
but also serve other general aviation 
airports in a rather large geographic 
region. In one of her last public appear-
ances, in June of 2019, Senator Hagan 
was 
able 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
groundbreaking ceremony of that FAA 
tower. 
This bill has bipartisan support in 
the Senate, including Senators KLO-
BUCHAR, WARNER, and TILLIS. A com-
panion bill has also been introduced in 
the House by Representative BUDD with 
a majority of the delegation sup-
porting, 
including 
Representatives 
PRICE, BUTTERFIELD, and ADAMS. 
This is a testament to Senator Hagan 
and shows how we can continue to 
work together to not only achieve 
great things for our constituents but 
also recognize the achievements of 
public servants like Kay Hagan. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 4762, in-
troduced earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will report the 
bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4762) to designate the airport 
traffic control tower located at Piedmont 
Triad International Airport in North Caro-
lina, as the ‘‘Senator Kay Hagan Airport 
Traffic Control Tower’’. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 4762) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed as follows: 
S. 4762 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION. 
The airport traffic control tower located at 
Piedmont Triad International Airport in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, and any suc-
cessor airport traffic control tower at that 
location, shall be known and designated as 
the ‘‘Senator Kay Hagan Airport Traffic 
Control Tower’’. 
SEC. 2. REFERENCES. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
document, paper, or other record of the 
United States to the airport traffic control 
tower referred to in section 1 shall be deemed 
to be a reference to the ‘‘Senator Kay Hagan 
Airport Traffic Control Tower’’. 
SENATE BIPARTISANSHIP 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, that is 
all the unanimous consent requests I 
have today, but since the floor is va-
cant, let me take this opportunity to 
say that the American people have just 
seen that the Senate can function, the 
Senate can pass legislation, the Senate 
can find legislation that both sides 
agree on. 
Yes, we, quite frankly, have issues on 
which we disagree, but why not spend 
the balance of this week, the balance of 
this year, focused on the things that we 
can find agreement on and come to this 
floor and debate them and pass them. 
There are many more things that we 
agree upon, on both sides of the aisle, 
than we disagree upon. 
There are some hot-button issues 
that we will probably never find una-
nimity on, but there are many, many 
things that affect thousands, if not 
millions, of people’s lives in this coun-
try that we can do by simple unani-
mous consent. It just takes a willing-
ness of 100 members of the U.S. Senate 
to agree to take it up. 
So I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle: Don’t be the one or don’t 
be part of the contingent that objects 
to something. If it is in the best inter-
est of this institution, of this country, 
of the American people, let it come up. 
Let it have a debate, and let it have a 
vote—hopefully, a unanimous consent 
request like we have just seen. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CENSUS BUREAU 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
there is a lot going on in America right 
now. We are in the middle of a pan-
demic where we have lost over 200,000 
people. We have millions who are un-
employed. We are only 34 days away 
from a Presidential election. It is easy 
to see that a lot of Americans could 
have missed the fact that we are also 
in the middle of a decennial census. 
Under article I, section 2 of the Con-
stitution, since 1790, the United States 
has conducted a census every 10 years. 
The U.S. Census Bureau is currently 
executing the 2020 decennial census. As 
we speak, census workers are con-
ducting interviews and filling out sur-
vey forms in every community in our 
country despite the tremendous obsta-
cles that have been posed by COVID–19. 
Their work is of utmost importance. I 
want to take this opportunity to thank 
them for their very challenging efforts. 
The 2020 census will dictate appor-
tionment of the House of Representa-
tives for the next decade. In addition, 
Federal programs rely on census data 
to distribute more than $1.5 trillion in 
funding every year to States, local-
ities, individuals, and businesses. So 
the stakes are high for the census, and 
we have only one chance to get it 
right—one chance every 10 years. 
As the vice chair of the Senate Com-
merce, Justice, Science, and Related 
Agencies 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee, I have worked with Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle to ensure 
that the Census Bureau has the re-
sources it needs to ensure a complete 
and accurate 2020 census. This includes 
securing, for the past several fiscal 
years, the entire amount that was re-
quested by the administration, includ-
ing reserve funding, which has been 
critical to meet the challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
However, in addition to funding, the 
Census needs sufficient time to get the 
job done right. To protect public 
health, on April 13, 2020, Census Direc-
tor Steven Dillingham and Commerce 
Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that 
the Census Bureau would delay field 
operations by 3 months and they asked 
Congress to delay reporting apportion-
ment and redistricting counts by 4 
months in order to ‘‘ensure the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the 2020 Cen-
sus.’’ 
That 
was 
Census 
Director 
Dillingham and Commerce Secretary 
Ross. Under this revised plan, the larg-
est and most important field data col-
lection operation to follow up with 
households that have been nonrespon-
sive would run until October 31. On a 
bipartisan basis, this request from the 
administration was welcomed. We want 
to give the Census both the time and 
the resources that it needs to do the 
job right. 
Over the course of the summer, the 
Trump administration installed new 
political appointees at the Census, and 
a number of reports indicated that the 
Trump administration was looking to 
rush the 2020 decennial census oper-
ations so that Secretary Ross—despite 
what he said to us last spring—could 
transmit the apportionment counts to 
the President by December 31, 2020. 
Then, on August 3—just last month, 
August 3—Census Director Dillingham 
announced that 2020 field data collec-
tion and self-response operations would 
be shortened by a month, ending today, 
September 30. This decision to curtail 
operations was not based on the advice 
of career Census Bureau experts. Cen-
sus data collection operations are in-
credibly complicated even under the 
best of conditions, but their com-
plexity is greatly exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
In 
fact, 
this 
spring, experts made clear that a 4- 
month delay of statutory deadlines was 
necessary. 
In May, Tim Olson, Director for Field 
Operations for the 2020 decennial cen-
sus, stated: 
We have passed the point where we could 
even meet the current legislative require-
ment of December 31. We can’t do that any-
more. 
That was back in May. 
After the truncated data collection 
operations were announced, a career of-
ficial stated: 
It’s going to be impossible to complete the 
count in time. I’m very fearful we’re going to 
have a massive undercount.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5920 
September 30, 2020 
I share this fear. I am deeply con-
cerned that cutting short data collec-
tion and processing operations during a 
global 
pandemic 
will 
necessitate 
changes that will be detrimental to the 
accuracy and completeness of the 2020 
decennial census. In particular, I am 
concerned that the Census Bureau will 
reduce the number of attempts to 
count households and significantly in-
crease the use of less accurate data col-
lection methods. This could lead to a 
substantial undercount in historically 
hard-to-count areas. Those areas in-
clude Native American, rural, and im-
migrant communities. An undercount 
would mean that these communities 
would be left disenfranchised, without 
proper 
political 
representation 
and 
without millions of dollars of Federal 
funding. 
We should be clear about the gravity 
of this outcome. This would be a con-
stitutional crisis that further under-
mines faith in our governing institu-
tions. 
I called for the Department of Com-
merce inspector general to investigate 
why the Trump administration sud-
denly curtailed data collection oper-
ations. I have also requested that the 
Government Accountability Office con-
duct an investigation into how this 
rushed timeline could affect data qual-
ity and the overall completeness of the 
census count. 
Last week, the Commerce inspector 
general released a preliminary report, 
finding what we already knew: that the 
decision to accelerate the 2020 census 
schedule was not made by the experts 
at the Census Bureau and that rushed 
schedule increases the risk to the accu-
racy of the 2020 census. 
In particular, the report raises that 
the curtailed timeline does not provide 
schedule flexibility in the case of nat-
ural disasters. Unfortunately, over the 
last 
month, 
we 
have 
seen 
record 
wildfires out West and several hurri-
canes in the gulf. This has delayed op-
erations in those regions. 
The GAO came to a similar conclu-
sion, publishing a report last month 
that found that cutting the timeframe 
for the 2020 census could increase the 
risk of an inaccurate count. One line 
from the inspector general’s report 
really stuck with me. It said: 
A statutory extension would permit the 
Bureau to adhere, as closely as practicable, 
to the 2020 Census plan it developed over a 
decade instead of the replan it developed 
over a weekend. 
I hope my colleagues will review 
these reports. I know everybody is anx-
ious to go home. I am anxious to go 
home. But I hope people will review 
these reports and join me in providing 
the Census Bureau the time the agency 
needs. 
This last-minute attempt to shorten 
data collection and data processing 
isn’t surprising, sadly. The Trump ad-
ministration has made other attempts 
to manipulate the count for political 
gain. It has been well documented that 
political operatives have pushed the 
administration and Secretary of Com-
merce Wilbur Ross to include a citizen-
ship question as part of the 2020 census 
and in an attempt to reduce participa-
tion in immigrant communities. Ulti-
mately, Secretary Ross’s attempt to 
include a citizenship question was re-
jected by the Supreme Court. 
We can’t let these latest attempts to 
undermine the accuracy of the con-
stitutionally mandated count succeed. 
Last week, a Federal court issued an 
injunction preventing the Census Bu-
reau from ramping down operations 
prematurely because there would be ir-
reparable harm to communities from 
rushing the count. However, this could 
just be temporary. In defying the 
court, earlier this week, the Census Bu-
reau announced a mere 5-day delay so 
that operations will now end on Octo-
ber 5. This is not long enough. The Cen-
sus Bureau has also announced plans to 
appeal the court’s injunction. 
This is not solely a rural or an urban 
issue, a red State or a blue State prob-
lem. I hope my colleagues will listen to 
this because the States with the lowest 
percentage of households counted are 
Alabama, Louisiana, Montana, South 
Carolina, 
Mississippi—Senator 
WICKER—and Georgia. Some of these 
States are on the bubble of gaining or 
losing 
Representatives, 
so 
an 
undercount, which is a real risk if oper-
ations are rushed and shut down pre-
maturely, would have serious repercus-
sions. 
That is why I call on my colleagues 
to pass a 4-month extension of the 
Census’s statutory deadlines so that 
the Trump administration is compelled 
to stick to the timeline it had origi-
nally 
announced. 
Congress 
already 
missed an opportunity to address this 
issue as part of the continuing resolu-
tion. 
Again, there is bipartisan support for 
this extension, with a bipartisan bill 
filed. In addition, last month, a bipar-
tisan group of 48 Senators sent a letter 
to Senate and House leadership that 
called for the inclusion of legislation 
to extend the statutory deadlines as 
part of the next coronavirus relief 
package, as the House has done in the 
updated Heroes Act that was released 
recently. We should also ensure that 
the data collection operations, includ-
ing nonresponse followup and self-re-
sponse, continue through October 31. 
It is imperative for the census to 
count every person in the United 
States and where one lives. This in-
cludes communities that have had his-
torically low participation in decennial 
censuses. The census is too important 
to allow meddling for political gain. 
We must take action immediately to 
ensure that the Census Bureau takes 
the time to get it right. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to use props during my speech. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CLEAN WATER 
Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
water is the most basic element of 
human life. In Montana, we depend on 
a steady supply of water to drink, to ir-
rigate our crops, to water our live-
stock, and to provide energy through 
hydropower. Water is a precious re-
source, but there are still rural com-
munities in Montana that face chal-
lenges to access and that are in dire 
need of Federal assistance. The health 
and economic risks associated with the 
lack of reliable water have increased 
because of the current pandemic. 
I stand here today to highlight three 
bills that would ensure rural Montana 
communities have access to water. 
S. 1882 would allow the 130 family 
farms in the Kinsey Irrigation Com-
pany and Sidney Water Users Irriga-
tion District to continue the use of 
Pick-Sloan power, which they have 
reasonably relied on for more than 74 
years. Thankfully, this bill has been 
passed out of the U.S. Senate and now 
awaits House consideration. I thank 
both Senate and House leadership for 
getting this bill to the finish line, and 
I urge my colleagues in the House to 
pass it. 
Another Montana water priority is 
the bipartisan St. Mary’s Reinvest-
ment Act, which supports the St. Mary 
and Milk River Project by allowing the 
reconstruction and restoration of the 
over 100-year-old infrastructure. I am 
proud to be working with the entire 
Montana delegation on this important 
bill that supplies over 18,000 water 
users and municipalities along the Hi- 
Line, including the Blackfeet Reserva-
tion and Fort Belknap. 
The catastrophic failure of a drop 
structure this past summer is proof 
that Congress must pass this bipar-
tisan legislation. I spent time out there 
in July and saw firsthand the cata-
strophic failure of that drop and why it 
is so important to get this legislation 
passed. This bill is critical for Mon-
tana’s families and Montana’s farmers 
and ranchers along the Hi-Line. 
I would also like to highlight my bi-
partisan bill, the Clean Water for Rural 
Communities Act. It is hard to believe 
that there are approximately 40,000 
Americans across 12 counties in both 
Montana and North Dakota who cur-
rently do not have access to water that 
is safe to drink. In fact, I have brought 
with me today some examples of the 
drinking water that Montanans in the 
central and eastern parts of our State 
have shared with me. 
Here is a sample that literally came 
from the tap of the Arnesons. It is hard 
to believe we are in 2020 and that a 
Montanan can open up a tap and see 
water like this. 
This example came from the Good 
family. Again, it is yellow water, and 
this is black water. This is water that 
has literally come from the taps of

Safe Drinking Water Act’s standard, 
and nearly all residents must rely on 
bottled water. This water is so con-
taminated that it is corrosive to appli-
ances, which requires residents to oper-
ate water softeners to avoid damage. 
My bill would allow two regional, 
rural water systems to be rebuilt in 
order to provide Montanans access to 
reliable, safe water in central and east-
ern Montana. I don’t think that is ask-
ing for too much. All we are asking for 
is reliable and safe water for thousands 
of Montanans. Both of these rural 
drinking water projects have been 
working with the Bureau of Reclama-
tion for over 15 years to gain Federal 
authorization, and they can’t wait any 
longer. 
I rise on behalf of the 40,000 Mon-
tanans who lack access to clean water, 
and I urge the swift passage of the 
Clean Water for Rural Communities 
Act as well as the St. Mary’s Reinvest-
ment Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
GREG KELLY 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
have a serious matter to discuss with 
the Senators about the U.S. relation-
ship with our ally Japan. 
Japan has been a valued American 
partner in the Pacific. It is our fourth 
largest trading partner and a close 
military ally. Our nations are better 
off because of the alliance between 
Japan and the United States, and I 
hope it grows stronger in the days 
ahead. 
I regret that today I must be sharply 
critical of the Japanese Government. I 
rise to express concern over Japan’s 
unjust treatment of an American cit-
izen, Greg Kelly. It is a concern that 
raises questions about whether Ameri-
cans can be comfortable about Japan’s 
adherence to the basic rule of law. Mr. 
Kelly has become the latest victim of 
Japan’s criminal justice system. Some 
have called it a hostage justice system. 
Even some leaders in Japan have called 
it a hostage justice system, because it 
is. It is unfair, harsh, and arbitrary. 
Japanese prosecutors have an alarming 
conviction rate of 99 percent, which is 
clearly designed to produce guilty ver-
dicts. 
Greg Kelly is a Tennessee resident 
who joined Nissan in 1988 and became a 
respected employee. He rose steadily 
within the company and in June of 2012 
became the first American to join Nis-
san’s 
board. 
Yet, 
shortly 
before 
Thanksgiving of 2018, his 30-year career 
at Nissan came to a crashing halt—a 
troubling halt to his career and to fun-
damental fairness. 
A company executive lured him to 
Tokyo for what was supposed to be an 
urgent business meeting. Mr. Kelly was 
2 weeks away from having badly needed 
neck surgery and was hesitant to trav-
el internationally, but the Nissan exec-
utive assured him he would be home 
within a week, so Mr. Kelly boarded a 
Nissan corporate jet to Tokyo. In fact, 
Greg Kelly had been lied to and was 
walking into a trap that had been de-
signed by Nissan executives and Japa-
nese authorities. 
According to emails obtained by 
Bloomberg News, that Nissan executive 
was working in collusion with Japa-
nese prosecutors to disrupt a merger 
between Nissan and the French auto 
company, Renault. Greg Kelly was in-
volved in negotiating that merger. 
Their plan required framing him for 
bogus financial crimes and throwing 
him under the bus. 
While he was en route to Tokyo, Nis-
san executives launched a ‘‘boardroom 
coup’’ to strip Mr. Kelly of his position. 
Government 
prosecutors 
seized 
his 
boss, Carlos Ghosn, chairman of the 
board of Nissan, for allegedly under-
reporting his income—another bogus 
charge. 
Hours later, upon his arrival at the 
airport, Mr. Kelly was arrested on 
these trumped-up charges. Mr. Kelly 
was treated with cruelty by Japanese 
authorities from day one. He was kept 
in solitary confinement for 34 days. 
This American citizen, this resident of 
the State of Tennessee, was kept in sol-
itary confinement, where he slept on 
the floor in the dead of winter and had 
no heat. He was interrogated daily, for 
several hours at a time, without having 
the presence of a defense counsel—a 
basic legal right. 
This is the treatment given to our 
American citizen by Japanese authori-
ties. His requests for medical attention 
were refused. When they did eventually 
allow him to get surgery, it was too 
late to do much good, and, predictably, 
Greg Kelly’s physical condition got 
worse. Thankfully, Mr. Kelly was even-
tually allowed to live in a Tokyo apart-
ment while he awaited trial. His trial 
began only this month—more than 650 
days after his arrest. 
With regard to former CEO Carlos 
Ghosn, in a celebrated escapade, Mr. 
Ghosn was able to escape from Japan 
to his native Lebanon after being re-
leased on bail, but Greg Kelly remains 
in Japan to this day and vehemently 
denies the charges against him. 
It is noteworthy that the CEO of Nis-
san, Hiroto Saikawa, was involved in 
the same negotiations as Mr. Kelly. In 
other words, if Mr. Kelly is guilty of a 
financial crime, so is Mr. Saikawa. Yet, 
instead of being arrested, he was al-
lowed to simply resign. 
Japanese leaders may deny it, but it 
looks an awful lot like there is a dou-
ble standard in Japan’s justice sys-
tem—a lenient standard for native Jap-
anese and a much harder one for Amer-
icans. This double standard is not lost 
on American businesses, and it is not 
lost on this Senator. Japan should 
worry about the consequences of its be-
havior. A perceived legal bias could put 
a seriously chilling effect on our eco-
nomic relationship as more Americans 
think twice about doing business in 
Japan or doing business with Japan. 
Mr. Kelly’s treatment in the Japa-
nese courtroom has been no less appall-
ing. The trial began a few days ago, 
and the court allowed prosecutors to 
give a 6-hour presentation at the open-
ing of the trial, with there being no si-
multaneous English translation. 
They denied the same right to Mr. 
Kelly. He has yet to make his opening 
statement. Instead of letting Mr. Kelly 
speak in his own defense, the court 
then recessed for 2 weeks. 
The proceedings have been incredibly 
slow and will continue to be incredibly 
slow. The trial is expected to last more 
than a year because Japanese rules 
allow the prosecutors to meet at the 
trial for only 6 days per month and also 
because the court refused to allow si-
multaneous English translation at the 
trial. 
This is a stark reminder of how for-
tunate we are in this country, under 
our Constitution, which guarantees the 
right to a speedy trial. 
I have zero confidence that the Japa-
nese criminal justice system will give 
Mr. Kelly a fair trial. The fix was in for 
him from the beginning. His being 
lured to Japan, his wrongful arrest, his 
deplorable treatment in solitary con-
finement and in court are a scandal 
worthy of Vladimir Putin, not our al-
lies in Japan. It should be an embar-
rassment for any modern democracy. 
This is a matter that should have 
been resolved in the board room and by 
shareholders. 
This 
needless 
ordeal 
sends an unmistakable message to the 
American business community: If you 
do business in Japan, you had better 
watch your back. When it suits Japa-
nese interests, they could set a trap for 
you, throw you under the bus, put you 
in prison, deprive you of your rights to 
counsel and your rights to return 
home, and waste years of your life 
needlessly. That is the message it 
sends to the American business com-
munity. 
This is a shameful story for an ally of 
the United States, and it looms as an 
ominous 
shadow 
over 
the 
coming 
Tokyo Olympic Games, the recently 
completed U.S.-Japan agreement, and 
future trade negotiations. 
Our two nations have shared in pros-
perity for decades because of mutual 
respect and mutual cooperation. I hope 
our Japanese friends will show a re-
newed interest in preserving that rela-
tionship, which has been harmed by the 
Greg Kelly fiasco. 
The newly installed Prime Minister 
of Japan, Prime Minister Suga, needs 
to intervene in this matter. Japan 
needs to right this wrong and end this 
highly visible stain on its international 
reputation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
H.R. 8337 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Madam 
President, 
today, we in the Senate will vote on a 
continuing resolution to keep the gov-
ernment funded through December 11, 
2020. It is the last day we can do that. 
I strongly urge all Members to vote 
aye. The last thing our country needs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5922 
September 30, 2020 
is a government shutdown in the mid-
dle of a global pandemic and an unprec-
edented economic crisis. 
Now, the bill we are considering 
passed the House by a wide margin to 
show they were doing their job—some-
times a rarity in Washington. It pro-
vides 
funding 
for 
the 
government 
through December 11 at fiscal year 2020 
funding levels and under the same 
terms and conditions contained in the 
fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. 
It also includes several authorization 
matters to extend programs that other-
wise would expire, including important 
health and transportation and veterans 
programs. 
Now, I am pleased the bill includes 
the emergency USCIS Stopgap Sta-
bilization Act. This will help prevent 
furloughs of Federal employees at the 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serv-
ices, many of whom work in my home 
State of Vermont. 
Now, these are dedicated Federal em-
ployees. They perform critical work, 
helping immigrants apply for citizen-
ship and visas and asylum, and they 
have come to work every single day 
living under the threat of furloughs for 
months now, in the middle of a global 
pandemic, and all the while continuing 
their important work. 
While I believe more fiscal year re-
forms and stronger oversight are need-
ed at USCIS, this legislation will help 
stave off the immediate crisis while we 
work on a longer term solution. 
I am also glad the bill includes near-
ly $8 million for child nutrition pro-
grams, especially the extension of the 
Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer. 
That is the P-EBT Program. That is 
important because it provides millions 
of children with additional monthly 
benefits 
for 
food 
purchases 
while 
schools are closed. And this assistance 
is desperately needed as families across 
the Nation struggle to make ends meet 
and to put food on the table. 
Now, I support the continuing resolu-
tion. It is what I do in my role as vice 
chairman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
But I cannot help but note the reason 
we need this is because of a dysfunc-
tional Congress. It is a symptom of 
that. It is a senseless and entirely 
avoidable, made-in-Washington crisis. 
The 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee should have been allowed to do 
its work. We could have completed all 
12 appropriations bills months ago, and 
the majority of those bills would have 
had overwhelmingly bipartisan support 
of both Republicans and Democrats. 
Apparently, the Republican leader 
did not want to allow that to happen, 
so we are left with a continuing resolu-
tion. It simply kicks the can down the 
road. 
Not only did we not complete our 
work on the fiscal year 2021 appropria-
tions bills, the Senate has not acted on 
a much needed COVID relief bill to ad-
dress the impacts of the pandemic 
found in every town across America— 
every single town, represented by every 
single Senator in this body. 
Look what is happening across our 
country. Schools are struggling to safe-
ly educate our Nation’s children, in 
both the classroom and, where nec-
essary, remotely, without enough fund-
ing to do so. 
More than 9 million children do not 
have access to the internet in their 
homes. In normal times, this would set 
these children far behind their more af-
fluent peers who can access online edu-
cational resources. By doing nothing— 
by doing nothing, at a time when much 
of our Nation’s children are remote 
learning, 
Senate 
Republicans 
and 
President Trump are choosing to leave 
these children behind, and these chil-
dren are all over the Nation, in every 
single State, and they are being left be-
hind. Inaction is a choice, and that 
choice is to actively prop up the cycle 
of poverty for yet another generation. 
Look at the lines at our food banks. 
They are at a historic level during this 
enormous economic downturn. Today, 
in America, the wealthiest country in 
the world, one in four households are 
experiencing food insecurity during 
this pandemic. 
Nobody in this room has looked their 
child in the eyes with the knowledge 
that you do not know where the next 
meal will come from. Think of those 
people who do, day by day, have to 
look at their children, knowing that 
they don’t know where their next meal 
is coming from and how they are going 
to feed these children. 
Inaction here and at the White House 
is a choice to let that child go hungry 
and force their parents to live with 
that terrible pain that comes when you 
cannot put enough food on the table for 
your family. 
Families are struggling to pay rent 
and eviction moratoriums have expired 
across the country in every State. In 
July, it was reported that, in this econ-
omy, more than 43 million Americans— 
one-quarter of the adult population of 
this country—either missed a rent or 
mortgage payment or had little to no 
confidence they could make the next 
payment. That was two rent or mort-
gage payments ago, with no relief. 
More than 31 million Americans were 
unemployed in August; 163,735 busi-
nesses have closed, and 97,066 of those 
have closed permanently. 
States don’t have the money they 
need to safely carry out an election 
that is only 34 days away and in the 
middle of a pandemic. 
Without a legislative change extend-
ing critical deadlines, our ability to 
achieve a fair and accurate count in 
the 2020 census remains a risk—a cen-
sus that is required under the Constitu-
tion of the United States, a Constitu-
tion we all have taken an oath to up-
hold. 
American people are suffering, and 
politics are being played to keep that 
suffering continuing. But it is infuri-
ating that the Republican leadership 
refuses to acknowledge this reality. In-
stead of doing their job and considering 
and passing full-year appropriations 
bills and a desperately need a COVID 
relief bill, Senate Republicans have fo-
cused this year almost entirely on 
packing the courts with rightwing, ex-
treme judges. Faced with an unprece-
dented health and economic crisis, does 
this spur Republicans to action? No. 
But what does? Aha. A Supreme Court 
vacancy in an election year that under 
their own precedent—under Republican 
precedent—should not be filled until 
the American people have their say in 
November. All of a sudden, they are 
ready to go to work. That is shameful. 
At least on that, wait until the elec-
tion. Let the American people speak. 
You know, it is frustrating because 
we could have passed every one of 
those appropriations bills and not be 
faced with this. And I bet they would 
have passed overwhelmingly. 
So if Senate Republicans want to 
keep the Senate in session during Octo-
ber, I say do it. There is plenty of work 
left undone. The Senate could act on 
the fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills, 
a COVID relief bill, or any one of the 
hundreds of bills the House has passed 
that are currently bottled up in Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard. 
But these pressing needs—pressing 
needs of people going hungry, being 
thrown out of their homes, not getting 
the medical care they need, facing the 
danger of COVID, something the Presi-
dent said would go away in the spring— 
their needs are being ignored while Re-
publicans focus on filling a vacancy to 
the Supreme Court that should right-
fully remain vacant until a month 
from now when the people have spoken 
at the polls. 
Congress is failing the American peo-
ple because Republicans, led by Presi-
dent Trump, care more about securing 
a hyperpartisan Supreme Court than 
the health and safety of the American 
people—all people. It doesn’t matter 
their politics in this country. It is that 
simple. 
Now, I remain committed to com-
pleting the fiscal year 2021 appropria-
tions bills. I want to produce bipar-
tisan bills before the CR expires on De-
cember 11. I think Chairman SHELBY 
shares this commitment. I look for-
ward to working with him to complete 
our work. 
When he was not blocked by his own 
party’s leadership, we passed, by over-
whelming margins, all of the appro-
priations bills. Let’s work to complete 
our work. But for now, let’s remove the 
threat of any more chaos in this coun-
try—prevent a government shutdown 
by passing this bill. I urge all Members 
of both parties to vote aye on the con-
tinuing resolution. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 526 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the Communist Party of China is com-
mitting a genocide against the Uighur 
people. Let me say that again. The 
Communist Party of China is commit-
ting a genocide against the Uighur peo-
ple. 
Under General Secretary of the Com-
munist Party Xi, 1 million Uighurs 
have been placed in concentration 
camps simply because of their religion. 
The Xi regime is reportedly performing 
forced abortions and forced steriliza-
tion of Uighur women. 
The Communist Party of China is 
harvesting organs from Uighurs and 
members of the Falun Gong. The Com-
munist Party assigns male Han Chi-
nese to regularly sleep in the same 
beds as the wives of Uighur men de-
tained in the camps. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
disgusting 
human rights abuses, the Communist 
Party of China is stripping away the 
freedom and autonomy that the people 
of Hong Kong were guaranteed. They 
are threatening Taiwan, building up 
their military to compete with us, ar-
resting and detaining foreign journal-
ists, and punishing anyone who dis-
agrees with them. 
General Secretary Xi has established 
a surveillance system in Beijing that 
tracks every movement you make on-
line and in person. The actions of Xi 
and the Chinese Communist Party fly 
in the face of the fundamental values 
that unite freedom-loving countries 
around the world—values that the 
Olympic Games are meant to foster 
and promote. Yet, in just 2 years, Com-
munist China is slated to host the 2022 
Olympic 
Games. 
The 
International 
Olympic Committee’s Charter states: 
‘‘The goal of Olympism is to place 
sport at the service of the harmonious 
development of humankind, with a 
view to promoting a peaceful society 
concerned with the preservation of 
human dignity.’’ 
The host city contract the IOC adopt-
ed in 2017 requires that hosts protect 
and respect human rights. Unfortu-
nately, but not by accident, the con-
tract does not take effect until after 
the 2022 Beijing games. Think about 
that. It was 56 years ago that the Inter-
national Olympic Committee took a 
historic step and stood up to the Gov-
ernment of South Africa and its racist 
apartheid system and banned the coun-
try from participation in the 1964 
Tokyo Olympic Games. South Africa 
was also excluded for the 1968 Mexico 
City games, and in 1970, the IOC indefi-
nitely expelled South Africa from 
Olympic competition. 
Germany and Japan were banned 
from participating in the 1948 Olympic 
Games for their roles in World War II. 
Afghanistan was banned in 2000 because 
of the Taliban’s discrimination against 
women, and South Korea was pressured 
by the IOC to enact democratic reforms 
before it hosted the 1988 games. 
Should 
Communist 
China, 
which 
places no value on human life or free-
dom, be allowed to host the 2022 
games? Absolutely not. Doing so will 
threaten the safety of athletes and 
attendees and financially reward the 
dictatorship responsible for its geno-
cide against its Muslim population. 
My colleague from Massachusetts, 
Senator MARKEY, and I introduced a bi-
partisan resolution calling on the 
International Olympic Committee to 
rebid the 2022 games to a country that 
recognizes and respects human rights. 
This isn’t about a boycott. I am abso-
lutely opposed to a boycott, and it is 
not about politics. This is a fight about 
human rights, which transcends poli-
tics. 
Moving the Olympic Games out of 
Communist China doesn’t hurt ath-
letes. It keeps them safe from Com-
munist China’s oppression. Last year, 
the world watched while Communist 
China pressured the NBA to sensor 
themselves over one tweet supporting 
Hong Kong citizens who were fighting 
for their freedom. We saw the NBA 
cower to Communist China’s wishes. 
They even prohibited athletes who 
were in China at the time from speak-
ing with reporters. 
If Communist China has the ability 
to sensor the NBA, an American orga-
nization, 
from 
speaking 
anything 
about anything that may offend Gen-
eral Secretary Xi, what will they do to 
athletes around the world? Will this re-
gime start censoring or restricting par-
ticipating athletes? What about the 
press? 
Will 
their 
broadcasts 
be 
censored to appease General Secretary 
Xi? 
We have to open our eyes to this 
threat, and we have to stand against 
the genocide of the Uighurs and the po-
litical oppression of Hongkongers. We 
also have to consider the safety of ath-
letes and spectators from all over the 
world. For the hundreds of millions 
who will watch the games, we must 
again lead by example and refuse to 
give Communist China a platform to 
whitewash its crimes. 
I stand with the freedom-loving peo-
ple of Hong Kong, the historically per-
secuted people of Tibet, the peaceful 
community of Chinese Muslims, in-
cluding Uighurs, Falun Gong, and the 
journalists and political dissidents in 
China. I hope that all of my colleagues 
will join me in demanding that the IOC 
rebid the 2022 Olympic Games should 
China fail to abandon its indefensible 
course. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged from further consideration 
and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 
526. I further ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, let me first 
say that I want to be clear that my op-
position that I will announce briefly to 
moving this resolution by UC today is 
not by any means because I disagree 
with the assessment of China’s abhor-
rent human rights record or the impor-
tance of the Olympics living up to the 
highest standards of upholding human

September 30, 2020 
dignity. The Olympic Charter states 
that the goal of Olympism is to pro-
mote ‘‘a peaceful society concerned 
with the preservation of human dig-
nity.’’ Beijing has not, by a long shot, 
earned the honor of hosting the 2022 
games. 
Now, my record is crystal clear when 
it comes to calling out and condemning 
China’s 
horrific 
record 
on 
human 
rights and the threat it poses to the 
United States and the rest of the inter-
national community. As my colleagues 
know, during my years in Congress, I 
have introduced, advocated for, and 
helped pass legislation on behalf of the 
people of Xinjiang, Tibet, Chinese civil 
society dissidents, a democratic and 
autonomous 
Hong 
Kong, 
and 
sup-
porting democracy across the Indo-Pa-
cific region. Just recently, I introduced 
a comprehensive bill to strengthen the 
United States across various sectors to 
best confront and counter China’s ef-
forts. I also recently released a report 
about the necessity of standing up 
against China’s dangerous new digital 
authoritarianism. 
There is no question that under Xi 
Jinping, China has taken a great leap 
backward on human rights, estab-
lishing 
concentration 
camps 
in 
Xinjiang, and instituting a surveillance 
state that not even George Orwell 
could have imagined and crushing any 
thoughts and ideas that deviate from 
the dictates of the party. China’s rise, 
bringing hundreds of millions out of 
poverty during the last century, is 
something the Chinese people can be 
justly proud of. But Xi Jinping’s 
dystopian 
totalitarian 
vision, 
cur-
rently crushing the Chinese people, is 
one of the century’s great tragedies. 
So I am very sympathetic to the 
goals of the resolution and the sponsor 
of the legislation. However, I believe 
these issues merit serious discussion in 
drafting of the appropriate language 
before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. I have been urging Chair-
man RISCH to hold a legislative mark-
up for months to discuss the many 
pressing pieces of legislation that 
Members on both sides of the aisle have 
had pending for many months. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 549 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
would, in response to the Senator’s re-
quest, say that there is a human rights 
crisis much closer to home that we 
have discussed before the committee. 
We have an opportunity to address peo-
ple suffering from a dictatorship who 
are right here in the United States, 
many of whom live in Senator SCOTT’s 
State of Florida. 
For the second time in 2 weeks, I 
would like to call upon this body to 
take up legislation the House has 
passed 
that 
would 
designate 
Ven-
ezuelans for temporary protected sta-
tus. I am asking Republicans to re-
member that there was a time before 
President Trump when our Nation 
stood in solidarity with victims of dic-
tatorship. 
Nicolas Maduro is a dictator, plain 
and simple. His regime is a cruel, 
criminal cabal that has destroyed Ven-
ezuela. Some 200,000 Venezuelans cur-
rently live in the United States with-
out legal status. They are unable to 
safely return to their homeland, and 
they would benefit from temporary 
protected status. I believe we have to 
do the right thing. We have to uphold 
American values and offer them pro-
tection. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 549 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed; and the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I have no problem 
with asking unanimous consent at this 
point to pass the legislation with a few 
amendments. Since this will not be 
going through committee, we ought to, 
like you say, examine the legislation 
and think about what it involves. I 
think 
having 
a 
few 
commonsense 
amendments would make sense. 
It is about 200,000 or 270,000 Ven-
ezuelans. I think we can accommodate 
them. We are a big, great country, and 
America has room for them. We should 
make sure, though, that they don’t 
overburden the welfare system, and 
there should be rules that people, as 
part of this program, do not come to 
the country to receive welfare. That is 
my first amendment. 
My second amendment would say 
that at the end of the 18-month period, 
Congress should vote on whether or not 
to extend the period. In the past, we 
have granted this temporary status, 
and it has been renewed decade after 
decade and become just sort of this lost 
zone for people for whom we can’t fig-
ure out a permanent solution. 
My third amendment would actually 
create an ability to absorb more people 
in our country and would be more of a 
permanent solution. My third amend-
ment is called the BELIEVE Act, and 
it is a bill that I have had out there for 
several years. What it would do is to 
take the merit-based employment in 
our country, employment-based visas, 
and double these visas. So, if you want 
to 
accommodate 
the 
200-some-odd 
thousand Venezuelans, we need more 
green cards, ultimately, for permanent 
status. This would be increased em-
ployment-based visas. 
So, my unanimous consent request 
would be to pass your bill with these 
three amendments: One, to prohibit 
welfare; two, to make it Congress’s pre-
rogative to decide that this term needs 
to be extended and it would have to be 
a vote by this body; and then the third 
thing would be that we expand our em-
ployment-based visas in order to ac-
commodate folks like this in our coun-
try. 
I would ask unanimous consent that 
your bill be passed, and, also, including 
my three amendments to the bill, and 
at this point, I ask unanimous consent 
for that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object to this 
modification, on these three amend-
ments, I respect my colleague who sits 
on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
We don’t always agree, but I always re-
spectfully listen to him. 
This effort that I am trying to bring 
to the floor, in line with Senator 
SCOTT’s question about human rights 
in China, is human rights right here in 
our hemisphere. The amendments that 
the Senator proposes seeks to basically 
gut the existing statute for temporary 
protected status, and it distracts from 
other issues in our immigration system 
as a price for providing Venezuelans 
with temporary protection in our coun-
try. One of these amendments is aimed 
at making it nearly impossible to 
renew TPS for foreign nationals, no 
matter the country or the conditions 
in the country. 
I would also note that this is at a 
time in which we have 131,000 with 
temporary protected status from other 
countries helping to support the Na-
tion as essential workers. So I object 
to the modification, and I object to 
Senator SCOTT’s motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to both requests. 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I voice my 
objection to the original motion of 
Senator MENENDEZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the request. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first, as you would expect, I am dis-
appointed in two ways. 
No. 1, I am disappointed that we 
couldn’t get a resolution done that 
dealt with what is going on in China. 
I would love the process to work per-
fectly so that everybody would do 
things in proper order, but the resolu-
tion is pretty simple. We know all the 
bad things that are happening in 
China, and we need to stand up. We 
have a chance now, not in 6 months, 
not in—I don’t know what time it 
would take to go through the Foreign 
Relations Committee, but we ought to 
be standing up now to say that the IOC 
needs to move the Olympics. So I am 
very disappointed that my colleague is 
not willing to just go along with a sim-
ple resolution to do that. 
No. 2, what my colleague knows is 
that the bill he is proposing would 
never get done. I have colleagues who 
want to reform and fix the TPS pro-
gram. I worked with my colleagues—all 
53 Republican colleagues—and they 
said that as long as we do a common-
sense reform of the TPS program, we 
would go ahead and do TPS for Ven-
ezuelans. So that is a bill we could do 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5927 
September 30, 2020 
We could have done it a couple of 
times, but my colleague on the other 
side of the aisle—another—blocked it. 
It doesn’t make any sense to me why 
we are not getting this done. We can 
both talk about all of the problems and 
issues the Venezuelans are dealing 
with. It is very disappointing to me. 
I don’t know what the reason is. I 
have been trying to work with my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
ask: What is the problem? And nobody 
will say: This is exactly what it is, and 
this is what you need to change to get 
it done. I don’t know how we get things 
done here if people are not willing to 
sit down and talk to each other to fig-
ure out how to get it done. 
I have also proposed other things 
that my colleague has blocked, like 
trying to make sure that Maduro 
couldn’t—there were no revenues that 
could get to the Maduro regime, and 
that was blocked. 
This just doesn’t make any sense to 
me. I don’t know what the issue is. I 
don’t know if it is because it was pro-
posed 
by 
Republicans 
rather 
than 
Democrats, but we have to figure out 
how to stand up together against 
human rights violations around the 
world. 
It should be simple to say that the 
International 
Olympic 
Committee 
should not be hosting the Olympic 
Games in 2022. It is pretty simple. It is 
disgusting what Xi is doing. 
It should be pretty simple to say: If 
we want to get TPS taken care of, 
whether it is for Venezuelans or wheth-
er it is for El Salvadorans or anybody 
else, we need to have a commonsense 
reform of the TPS system. That is why 
I proposed this resolution, and all 53 
Republican Senators agreed with me. 
I hope my colleague will commit to 
work with me to try to help the Ven-
ezuelans and also help others by fixing 
this TPS program. I hope he will work 
hard either to get a resolution that he 
agrees with me on or work through the 
Foreign Relations Committee to do 
something. But we have to do every-
thing we can to stop the genocide of 
the Uighurs in Communist China and 
also do everything we can to help the 
Venezuelans who are here and need 
TPS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the comments of my colleague 
from Florida. 
Let me just say, first, that we don’t 
even need legislation for Venezuelans 
to get TPS. Let’s not lose sight of that. 
President Trump, with a stroke of his 
pen, 
could 
give 
temporary—tem-
porary—protected status to the 200,000 
Venezuelans who have fled the Maduro 
regime—a 
regime 
that 
President 
Trump himself has signaled out in 
every possible way as a regime that un-
dermines the human rights of its peo-
ple and that attacks them. So we don’t 
even need legislation. 
The only reason the House of Rep-
resentatives, with Democratic majori-
ties, passed legislation is to try to in-
stigate the President to go ahead and 
give TPS to Venezuelans. 
Unfortunately, every time Senator 
SCOTT has come to offer what he calls 
a reform of TPS, it is really basically 
the death of TPS. I don’t know why we 
have to deny those who presently have 
TPS and whose country’s status may 
not have changed—slaying their status 
in order to give it to Venezuelans. I am 
not that Solomonic. So that is why 
there has been an objection. 
Again, I remind us that we don’t even 
need 
legislation. 
President 
Trump, 
with a stroke of his pen, could declare 
TPS for Venezuelans. That is the first 
thing. 
The second thing is, I would urge my 
colleagues and all my Republican col-
leagues—by the way, I know that you 
all know this, but just to remind us, 
you are in the majority. Chairman 
RISCH is the chairman because there is 
a 
Republican 
majority. 
Chairman 
RISCH gets to call when the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee goes into a 
business meeting. So as I have said to 
many of my colleagues, if you want to 
see your legislation considered—and I 
certainly would agree to an agenda 
that includes Senator SCOTT’s legisla-
tion—urge Senator RISCH
to hold a 
business meeting and a markup on leg-
islation. That is the way this body is 
supposed to work. Otherwise, then, 
let’s just meet here as 100 and make it 
the committee of the whole, where we 
can all opine and cast amendments on 
Appropriations, Judiciary, Foreign Re-
lations, Energy and Commerce—the 
whole spectrum. But if the committee 
system is supposed to mean anything, 
which is the concentration of those 
who have dedicated their time to be on 
that committee and who have insights 
for which legislation passes through, 
then it has to hold meetings and mark-
ups to consider legislation. So it is not 
that you have to urge us; you have to 
urge your colleague, the chairman, to 
hold markups to consider your legisla-
tion. 
I am sure that with some modifica-
tions, I would be one of those who 
would support your legislation in com-
mittee. But we cannot have everybody 
bypass the committee, come to the 
floor, and think that is the way things 
are going to operate. 
Yes, there are some things we would 
love to see in a timely fashion. From 
the reading of several motions the ma-
jority leader made for nominations, it 
sounds like we are going to be here 
next week. Well, the chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee could 
call a business markup for next week. 
We could get your resolution on; we 
could get it passed; and then we could 
get it to the floor. Why not? Why not? 
Then, the last thing: I don’t know 
what the Senator is referring to in 
terms of stopping moneys going to 
Maduro. My VERDAD Act, which be-
came law—along with Senator RUBIO 
and others—in essence tried to do ex-
actly that. But I am certainly happy to 
join with the Senator in any efforts to 
continue to work on stopping any flow 
of money to the Maduro regime and, 
more 
importantly, 
to 
reclaim 
the 
money that has already—the national 
patrimony of Venezuela that has been 
spent elsewhere. 
But let’s be honest. TPS for Ven-
ezuelans could have happened already. 
It could have happened yesterday. It 
could happen today, could happen to-
morrow if President Trump only wants 
to declare it so. 
I think he should. I don’t think we 
should have to pass legislation, but 
that is where we are. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I appreciate the comments of my col-
league from New Jersey. 
No. 1, I still have not heard what the 
issue is with a resolution that sounds 
like 99 other Senators are OK with, 
with regard to holding General Sec-
retary Xi accountable. I haven’t heard 
my colleague say what the concern is 
with it. 
It seems to me that we have the op-
portunity right now, between the two 
of us, if we need to make a change, 
maybe we can make a change. But I 
would like to get something done 
today. 
No. 2, as we know, the TPS program 
is a temporary program. It is not oper-
ated as a temporary program, and it 
has to be reformed. 
I agree with my colleague from New 
Jersey. I would like the President to 
say that the Venezuelans would get 
TPS right now, but I think the White 
House’s position is that we have to fix 
the program because the program 
doesn’t work. It is not a temporary 
program. 
That is why my fix—because what a 
lot of Senators keep saying—they want 
to say that we have to take back power 
we have given to the President. My res-
olution does that. 
The President can still do TPS, but 
after he does, if he wants to extend it, 
it has to come back to Congress, and 
we need to make a decision. It is pretty 
common sense. If we did that right 
now, we could get TPS for Ven-
ezuelans. 
The Senator from New Jersey has 
blocked my bill. It is a bill with Sen-
ator RUBIO to hold Maduro accountable 
by prohibiting Federal agencies from 
doing business with anyone who sup-
ports the oppressive Maduro regime. I 
don’t understand why he would do that. 
He has blocked a bill that is going to 
prevent money from going there. 
We have to stand up, whether it is 
against the Castro regime or Maduro. 
We have to support democracy and 
freedom in Latin America. 
I hope my colleague will stop block-
ing that bill also. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Has the Senator 
yielded the floor? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I yield the 
floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5928 
September 30, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
won’t stay the whole night debating 
my colleague, although I would enjoy 
that. But let me just say, No. 1, he has 
the power, as a colleague in the major-
ity, to go to the chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee and say: I 
really think this resolution is timely 
and needs to be done. 
We are going to be in session next 
week. The chairman of the Foreign Re-
lations Committee can call a markup 
next week. For his resolution, I will 
give him my word that I will support 
asking the chairman to put his resolu-
tion on the business meeting, and, 
probably, with some modifications, I 
would support it. But he needs to ask 
the chairman to hold a markup, No. 1. 
No. 2, the reality is that the concern 
about TPS not being ‘‘temporary’’— 
well, that concern was vitiated. I don’t 
know if it was the Ninth or Eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals that recently 
held a decision that said the President 
of the United States can give TPS, and 
he can end TPS, in his judgment. I 
don’t necessarily agree with that judi-
cial decision, but, nonetheless, that is, 
right now, the law of the land, so that 
concern is over. 
The suggestion that we have to end 
TPS as we know it in order to make 
sure that it only remains a temporary 
protected status—the courts have de-
termined that. They have said that the 
President can give TPS and can take it 
away. So, as far as I learned in my 
civics lessons, the court is the final law 
of the land in interpreting what it is 
that the law is. 
Lastly, I am going to look at—I 
would like the gentleman to get in con-
tact with—I don’t know what legisla-
tion he keeps referring to that some-
how we blocked, but before the gen-
tleman even arrived here, I have been 
pursuing the Castro regime for 20- 
something years—since I was in the 
House of Representatives, passing the 
LIBERTAD Act and so many others— 
and, certainly, the Maduro regime as 
well. So I am happy to look at that. 
But let’s get the chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee to hold a 
markup, and I think we can solve a lot 
of these problems. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
may I inquire if the Senators are con-
cluded with their discussion? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. They 
have both yielded. It appears they are. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am back again, thee and me once again 
together, to discuss climate change as 
unprecedented 
wildfires 
scorch 
the 
west coast and a deadly hurricane sea-
son turns in the Atlantic and Ameri-
cans cry out for action. 
Powerful players outside this Cham-
ber hear that cry, including, recently, 
over 200 CEOs of major American cor-
porations 
who 
form 
the 
Business 
Roundtable. 
Here are some of the 200 companies 
represented by those CEOs. As I dis-
cussed last week, the Business Round-
table just earlier this month called for 
science-based climate policy to reduce 
carbon pollution, consistent with the 
Paris Agreement, and specifically en-
dorsed carbon pricing—from Verizon, 
to Chevron, to Apple, to Wells Fargo, 
to McKinsey, to American Airlines, to 
Amazon, to Pfizer, to Ford. It is quite 
the who’s-who of corporate America. 
So why, you might ask, did the Busi-
ness Roundtable do this when normally 
business lobbyists are up here telling 
us to get out of their way? The answer 
is economics 101. Pollution is the text-
book example of market failure. A fac-
tory dumps toxic pollution into a river, 
and anyone living downstream bears 
the costs of that pollution. They can’t 
use their well, perhaps. Their property 
values decrease. They may even get 
sick. It is basic economic theory that 
polluters ought to bear those costs, 
called 
negative 
externalities—the 
downstream costs, if you will. Even 
Milton Friedman, the patron saint of 
free market economics, agreed that 
polluters should pay the costs associ-
ated with their pollution. 
For climate change, for the big car-
bon polluters, this is big bucks. The 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
cal-
culates that fossil fuel enjoys a $600 
billion—not million but billion with a 
‘‘b’’—subsidy in the United States 
every year—every year, $600 billion. It 
is mostly because the industry has 
managed to offload the costs of carbon 
pollution onto the general public. Why 
do you think they are so busy here in 
Congress all the time? They are trying 
to protect that subsidy. 
So if it is economics 101 that a prod-
uct’s price should reflect its true cost, 
and if, in the case of fossil fuels, they 
are cheating on that rule, then a price 
on carbon pollution, as the Business 
Roundtable recommends, is a correc-
tion to that market failure. 
The CEOs also read the same warn-
ings as the rest of us. Dozens of central 
banks, economists, and other financial 
experts warn of massive economic risks 
caused by our failure to address cli-
mate change—risks one recent esti-
mate put at triple the 2008 great reces-
sion; risks that are commonly called 
systemic, meaning they take down the 
whole financial system, not just fossil 
fuel. Business executives tend to take 
that kind of warning seriously. 
So this is a good-news story if you 
look at the business voice coming 
through the Business Roundtable. Here 
is the problem: The business voice 
doesn’t just come through the Business 
Roundtable; it also comes through 
other groups—groups that are historic 
enemies of climate action, constantly 
up to climate mischief. 
The very same corporations whose 
CEOs 
sent 
that 
friendly 
message 
through the Business Roundtable send 
the opposite and even louder message 
through these enemy groups, which 
brings me to the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, by far the largest lobbyist in 
town, a prolific litigator, a dark-money 
elections spender, and an inveterate 
opponent of serious climate action. 
In a recent study by InfluenceMap, 
the chamber was denominated one of 
the worst climate obstructers in Amer-
ica. In my view, it is not one of the 
worst; it is the worst because of the 
power that it brings behind its mes-
sage. If you imagine the Business 
Roundtable as emitting a positive po-
litical squeak, the chamber can emit a 
negative political roar—and they have 
for a long time. 
This chart is a partial list of the 
companies that are members of both 
the 
Business 
Roundtable 
and 
the 
Chamber of Commerce. I say it is par-
tial because the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, unlike local chambers of com-
merce, is very secretive. It doesn’t dis-
close its funds. It doesn’t disclose its 
membership. So the companies here ei-
ther voluntarily disclosed their mem-
bership, or the press ferreted it out. So 
let’s look at what some of these compa-
nies say about climate change and 
what they do through the chamber. 
Let’s start here with Johnson & John-
son. 
Johnson 
& 
Johnson 
is 
a 
giant 
healthcare and consumer goods com-
pany. You probably have plenty of 
Johnson & Johnson products around 
your house. 
Through the Business Roundtable, 
Johnson & Johnson says that climate 
change is serious and that Congress 
should enact a carbon price. In its cor-
porate materials, Johnson & Johnson 
says that climate change is impacting 
health and that ‘‘risks resulting from a 
changing climate have the potential to 
negatively impact economies around 
the world.’’ 
Johnson & Johnson recognizes the 
importance of government action, stat-
ing: 
While companies have a responsibility and 
ability to [mitigate climate change], the uni-
lateral capabilities of businesses are limited. 
Addressing these issues requires the collabo-
ration of companies with governments . . . 
to achieve systemic change at scale. 
So it sounds like the company gets 
it. But Johnson & Johnson also put at 
least $750,000 behind the chamber last 
year. 
What did the chamber just do on cli-
mate? It filed a brief supporting the 
Trump administration’s effort to undo 
emissions standards for cars and trucks 
set by California but honored across 
the country. Well, the nonpartisan 
Rhodium Group estimates that revok-
ing those fuel emissions standards 
would result in up to about 600 million 
metric tons of additional CO2 emissions 
through 2035. That is equal to the emis-
sions in a year from 130 million cars or 
from the electricity needed to power 
100 million homes. 
So which voice of Johnson & Johnson 
are we supposed to listen to—the Busi-
ness Roundtable voice or the chamber 
voice?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5929 
September 30, 2020 
How about United Airlines. Here is 
United. United Airlines doesn’t disclose 
its funding of the chamber, but it is on 
the chamber’s board, so it is likely a 
major financial backer involved in 
chamber 
policy 
decisions. 
Same 
thing—through the Business Round-
table, United says that climate change 
is serious and Congress should enact a 
carbon price, and on United’s website, 
you will find good language about cli-
mate change and the importance of re-
ducing emissions. Indeed, United has 
pledged to cut emissions in half by 
2050. 
Meanwhile, what is the chamber, on 
whose board United sits, doing? The 
watchdog 
group 
InfluenceMap 
has 
caught the chamber repeatedly lob-
bying the Trump administration to un-
ravel carbon pollution limits. So you 
have to wonder: From its seat on the 
chamber board, did United know about 
this? Did they do anything to stop 
those activities? They sit on the board, 
after all. 
Look also at Coca-Cola, one of our 
most iconic American brands. Through 
the Business Roundtable, Coca-Cola 
says that climate change is serious and 
that Congress should enact a carbon 
price. Coca-Cola says in its own mate-
rials that ‘‘[c]limate change is already 
having an impact on our business at 
multiple points in our value chain.’’ It 
says that it is committed to reducing 
its emissions. But in 2019, Coca-Cola 
gave the chamber at least $34,000. It 
didn’t disclose the total amount. 
What was the chamber up to on cli-
mate? It was in court litigating in 
favor of the Trump administration 
against efforts to reduce carbon pollu-
tion from powerplants. 
Now, Coca-Cola and the beverage in-
dustry also have a trade association of 
their own, which appears from public 
reporting to have made zero effort on 
this climate problem, notwithstanding 
those multiple impacts on Coca-Cola’s 
value chain. That trade association 
knows how to lobby when it wants to. 
On climate, it just doesn’t want to. 
Let’s have a look at AT&T, another 
one here on the board. I am not seeing 
it right now, so I am going to keep 
looking as I talk. It is another iconic 
American brand like Coca-Cola, and, 
like United, AT&T sits on the cham-
ber’s board. Presumably sitting on the 
chamber’s board, it is influential with-
in the organization. In the first 6 
months of 2019, AT&T reported giving 
the chamber at least $144,000. 
Now, AT&T wants Congress to adopt 
a very specific climate policy. First, of 
course, through the Business Round-
table, AT&T says that climate change 
is serious and that Congress should 
enact a carbon price. Also, AT&T is a 
founding member of the Climate Lead-
ership Council, and AT&T supports the 
CLC’s detailed carbon price proposal. 
Well, that is through their Business 
Roundtable and Climate Leadership 
Council 
voice. 
What 
do 
we 
hear 
through their chamber voice? Well, I 
could tell you something about where 
the chamber is on carbon pricing be-
cause, with Senators Schatz and Gilli-
brand and Heinrich, I have introduced 
carbon pricing litigation that is not all 
that different from the CLC proposal. 
Senators COONS and FEINSTEIN have a 
carbon pricing bill. So does Senator 
VAN HOLLEN. Senator DURBIN, our dep-
uty minority leader, just announced 
one. Over in the House, there are mul-
tiple carbon pricing bills, including one 
with over 80 cosponsors. Has the cham-
ber supported any of these bills? Nope. 
Not a one. Has it even engaged on any 
of them? Not with me. Not on ours. Not 
that I can tell on any of the others. 
When election season rolls around, 
the chamber has spent millions sup-
porting candidates who oppose com-
prehensive climate policies. So the 
Chamber message is pretty clear: Don’t 
support a serious carbon price. 
So which voice of AT&T’s are we to 
listen to—the CLC and Roundtable 
positive squeaks about carbon pricing 
or the chamber’s negative roar against 
carbon pricing, the roar that says to 
members here: Don’t you dare? 
These companies—all of them—which 
just said they support carbon pricing, 
are funding a group that is opposing 
climate action and specifically carbon 
pricing at every turn—in Congress, in 
court, in elections, in regulatory agen-
cies. 
I have called out just a few. There is 
AT&T right here. I called out just a 
few companies today to make the 
point, but every one of these compa-
nies—every one of them—is in the same 
position. The climate policy they sup-
port through the Business Roundtable 
is opposed by the entity they support: 
the chamber. 
They have to straighten that out. 
Whether you are UPS, Home Depot, 
American Express, Marathon, MetLife, 
Northrop Grumman, Sales Force, Mar-
riott, Abbott, Morgan Stanley, Micro-
soft, Exelon, Sempra, Southern Com-
pany, GE, Intel, Citi, PepsiCo—you 
name it—Anthem, Pfizer, Johnson Con-
trols, Lilly, Dow, ExxonMobil. 
You have to straighten this out be-
cause these are big and influential 
companies. In fact, this year, the mar-
ket capitalization of the entire oil and 
gas sector dropped below the market 
capitalization of just Apple. Quartz re-
ported in June that Apple could nearly 
buy ExxonMobil just with cash on 
hand. 
Yet these companies have been most-
ly silent while polluters called the 
shots around here in Congress and for a 
long time. They haven’t asked hard 
questions about the chamber’s fossil 
fuel funding, and they mostly stood by 
while the chamber—their own organi-
zation—became a worst climate ob-
structor. I think this is beginning to 
change. 
Last week, I spoke at a CERES, C-E- 
R-E-S, event on corporate climate lob-
bying during New York Climate Week. 
Over 100 people from scores of different 
companies participated. The interest 
among corporations and investors in 
getting a handle on anti-climate lob-
bying is surging. To all of them I said: 
Change the chamber. Get it to follow 
the Business Roundtable and support 
carbon pricing. Get it to come to Con-
gress in favor of science-based climate 
policy. Get the truth out of the cham-
ber about how much money it has been 
taking from the fossil fuel industry, 
particularly for these companies who 
are board members of the chamber. 
You guys have a due diligence duty to 
know that stuff. Changing that behe-
moth—the 
anti-climate 
chamber— 
would be a sea change indeed. That 
would help finally break the logjam 
that the fossil fuel industry has cre-
ated here in Congress. 
Let me wrap up by pointing out the 
obvious, which is that time is running 
out. If we don’t act soon, we will lock 
in the worst consequences of climate 
change for decades. So to these compa-
nies I ask: Why, if this is as important 
as you say it is, do you not speak with 
a clear voice? Why do you let corporate 
America’s 
most 
powerful 
political 
mouthpiece oppose you? Look at these 
companies. Why do you tolerate that, 
and why do you fund it and sit on its 
board while it opposes you? Climate 
change is not an issue you want to be 
on both sides of, so why are you on 
both sides of it? Whom do you expect 
Congress to listen to? Which voice of 
yours are we to take as the real one? If 
you want us to listen to your Business 
Roundtable voice, you better make 
sure it is not drowned out by the mas-
sive business lobby that you fund that 
has been our worst enemy against cli-
mate action. You all need to wake up. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of President Trump’s 
nomination of Indiana’s Amy Coney 
Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In the coming days, Americans will 
hear a great deal about Judge Bar-
rett—much of it from people who have 
never met her, who have never worked 
with her. As a fellow Hoosier, I have 
had the privilege of actually getting to 
know Judge Barrett and her family and 
to understand the breadth of her intel-
lect and the thoughtful reasoning of 
her work. My own opinions have been 
informed by my personal interactions 
with her and supported by the count-
less students, clerks, and former col-
leagues who, despite their very polit-
ical beliefs, are united in their admira-
tion for Judge Barrett. They will sec-
ond what I tell you here. 
Amy Coney Barrett’s qualifications 
to fill this seat are beyond question. 
The character she will demonstrate, 
once in it, will be exceptional. 
Her career is beyond distinguished. 
She graduated magna cum laude from 
Rhodes College and summa cum laude 
from Notre Dame Law School in South 
Bend, IN. She was highly decorated 
while doing both, including Dean’s Rec-
ognition Award and best exam in nu-
merous courses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5930 
September 30, 2020 
She held prestigious clerkships for 
Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and 
for the late Justice Antonin Scalia on 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
She is a respected educator, teaching 
for nearly two decades at Notre Dame’s 
Law School, where she was named Dis-
tinguished Professor of the Year three 
times. 
In 2017, she was nominated to fill a 
vacancy in the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. I have 
to say, I was incredibly pleased by her 
nomination to the Federal bench, and I 
was proud to vote for her confirmation. 
I wasn’t alone in my esteem for 
Judge Barrett. During her confirma-
tion process, those students and col-
leagues—former and current—came for-
ward with words of support and praise 
by the score. They described her as fair 
and decent, brilliant and generous. 
They were struck by her integrity, her 
impartiality, and her temperament. 
They spoke of her dedication to teach-
ing students not how to think but how 
to think for themselves. They recalled 
the long lines extending outside of her 
office of those students who sought and 
were always given advice and men-
toring. 
Though they came from different 
backgrounds and held differing views, 
they came together as a chorus to say 
this: Amy Coney Barrett possesses ex-
actly the type of mind and the strength 
of character America’s constitutional 
system relies on. I agreed then, and I 
still do. 
Just 3 years ago, I didn’t hear a sin-
gle credible criticism of Judge Barrett 
based on her legal qualifications. I 
don’t anticipate hearing one now. She 
will be guided by the law and prece-
dence. She will be faithful to the Con-
stitution. 
As compelling as the testimonies of 
those who admire her are, it is through 
her own words that we can see the type 
of Supreme Court Justice Amy Barrett 
will be: ‘‘A judge is obligated to apply 
the law as it is and not as she wishes it 
would be.’’ 
Judge Barrett has said: ‘‘She is 
obliged to follow the law even when her 
personal preferences cut the other way 
or when she will experience great pub-
lic criticism for doing so.’’ 
It is important for Americans to un-
derstand her qualifications for the Su-
preme Court and her fidelity to the 
Constitution. But they should also 
know a bit about her life away from 
the bench. 
When I met her, it was quite obvious 
that Amy Coney Barrett was less inter-
ested in cataloging her professional ac-
complishments and more inclined to 
discuss her family and the accomplish-
ments of her children, whom she clear-
ly loves so very much. 
Judge Barrett and her husband Jesse 
have been married for over 20 years 
now. Their family is a large one and a 
loving one. They are parents to seven 
children. Their youngest son has spe-
cial needs. They have twice adopted— 
both times from Haiti. Judge Barrett 
has asked: 
What greater thing can you do than raise 
children? That’s where you have your great-
est impact on the world. 
It is clear not just from those words 
but from simply spending a few mo-
ments with this beautiful family that 
this is her life’s joy and her greatest 
point of pride. 
How absurd then to see her described, 
as some here and in the media have, as 
anti-healthcare. It is the opposite, ac-
tually. As the head of a large house-
hold, Amy Coney Barrett knows full 
well and better than most of her de-
tractors how important medical cov-
erage is to every American’s health 
and to their peace of mind too. This in-
cludes insurance for those with pre-
existing conditions—which Republicans 
have, time and time again, committed 
to protect, while working to make 
healthcare more affordable and more 
accessible. 
This is actually not why Judge Bar-
rett was nominated or why she belongs 
on the Supreme Court. Let us be truth-
ful. It is also not the real reason why 
those who oppose her do so and do so 
with such rage. In the absence of ac-
tual objections to Amy Coney Barrett’s 
resume, they rummaged through and 
purposely 
warped 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
record. They warped her legal writings 
to position her as the mortal enemy of 
ObamaCare. This is a lie. Her scholar-
ship—if properly read, rather than 
quickly mined for propaganda—reveals 
no such thing. 
For 30 years, Democrats have contin-
ually cried wolf, painting every Repub-
lican Supreme Court nominee as the 
end of the Republic, hoping always to 
scare the American people to their 
side. Just as we witnessed 2 years ago, 
when their lies run out of believers, the 
lies grow more reckless. This is a dan-
gerous game to play right now—doubly 
so for the party that is blocking 
healthcare legislation during a pan-
demic. 
Judge Barrett hasn’t been nominated 
to the Supreme Court to make policy. 
Some seem to have forgotten, but that 
is our job. President Trump selected 
her not only because of her sharp mind 
and impressive qualifications but be-
cause she will not legislate from the 
bench. That is the whole point. 
Of course, there are others who may 
take a different, even darker tack. To 
them, none of this matters—not the 
impeccable credentials, not the ringing 
endorsements, not that she is a role 
model of an accomplished professional 
and a loving mother, not that she has 
been described as ‘‘mind-blowingly in-
telligent’’ and ‘‘one of the most humble 
people you will ever meet’’—none of it. 
We will hear from them in coming 
days—likely in this Chamber. We will 
hear a lot from them. 
If past is prologue, they may choose 
to focus instead on Judge Barrett’s re-
ligious beliefs—not out of any deep 
conviction but out of desperation. They 
may argue that it is impossible to live 
a life of faith and uphold the law. They 
may create a caricature of Judge Bar-
rett that has no relation to reality and 
one that reflects their own intolerance, 
not hers. It is regrettable that, in 2020, 
we must still repeat this refrain: We do 
not have a religious test for public 
service in the United States of Amer-
ica, and we never have. 
It is true. Judge Barrett is a faithful 
Catholic. It is true. So, too, are five 
current Supreme Court Justices. So, 
too, are millions of Americans. To 
argue that this prohibits her from sit-
ting on the Supreme Court is nothing 
short of religious bigotry. 
In 1793, George Washington penned a 
letter to the members of the New Jeru-
salem Church of Baltimore, MD. In it, 
Washington outlined one of the prin-
ciples that makes America so unique. 
‘‘A man’s religious tenets,’’ he wrote, 
‘‘will not deprive him of the right of at-
taining and holding the highest offices 
that are known in the United States.’’ 
Happily, 200 years later, we now 
apply Washington’s equation regarding 
the holding of high office to both men 
and women. It is unfortunate, though, 
that, two centuries later, we must still 
be reminded that all Americans can 
worship and pray as they please, and no 
doors of opportunity shall be closed be-
cause of it. 
And there is this: Since our founding, 
114 Americans have sat on the Supreme 
Court. Only four of them have been 
women. 
Are those who oppose this President 
and this pick really willing to use reli-
gious prejudice as an excuse to oppose 
confirming the fifth? Come on. If so, 
the faith my colleagues should be wor-
ried about isn’t Judge Barrett’s but the 
American people’s in this institution. 
In the coming weeks, I hope we don’t 
regress into religious bigotry. I hope 
the Senate can move past the personal 
attacks of some past nominees and, in-
stead, focus on the professional quali-
fications and judicial comportment of 
Judge Barrett. 
We are constitutionally obligated to 
provide our advice and consent to the 
President on his judicial nominees. My 
hope—and, perhaps, it is a naive one— 
is that we will fulfill that responsi-
bility by holding hearings that are in-
formative rather than destructive, not 
unlike those that led to Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s bipartisan confirma-
tion in 1993. 
If the Senate does this and we con-
sider Judge Barrett’s qualifications, 
she will be confirmed and subsequently 
serve with great honor and distinction, 
and she will do the American people 
proud. Both the High Court and our 
country will be better for it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
GARDNER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5931 
September 30, 2020 
SIGNING AUTHORITY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the senior 
Senator from North Dakota and the 
majority leader be authorized to sign 
duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions 
on Wednesday, September 30. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
would like to talk tonight about the 
nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for 
the vacant Supreme Court Associate 
Justice seat. 
I think the President made a great 
pick. From all indications, she is an 
impressive lawyer, judge, and person. 
We have already begun the process of 
looking at Judge Barrett. She has been 
meeting with Members of the Senate, 
and I look forward to my meeting with 
her. 
The precedent for moving forward 
with this nomination at this time is 
crystal clear. During an election year, 
when one party holds the Presidency 
and the Senate, in the entire history of 
our country, the Senate has confirmed 
the nominee in every single case except 
one. That one exception, by the way, 
was somebody who withdrew because of 
ethics concerns that both Republicans 
and Democrats had. So the precedent is 
very clear. When you have the Presi-
dent and the Senate of the same party, 
we confirm. 
In contrast, when power is divided 
and a Supreme Court vacancy arises 
during an election year, Senate prece-
dent is not to confirm the nominee. In 
fact, the last time a confirmation oc-
curred with the President and the Sen-
ate of different parties was in the 1880s. 
That distinction is what separates now 
from 2016. 
Back then, I wrote an op-ed: 
Some argue that the American people have 
already spoken. And I agree they have. Both 
the president and the Senate majority were 
fairly and legitimately elected. The last 
time we spoke as a nation, two years ago, 
the American people elected a Republican 
majority in the U.S. Senate in an election 
that was widely viewed as an expression that 
people wanted a check on the power of the 
president. The president has every right to 
nominate a Supreme Court Justice. . . . But 
the founders also gave the Senate the exclu-
sive right to decide whether to move forward 
on that nominee. 
In other words, in keeping with the 
precedent that I laid out earlier, the 
Republican Senate did what Demo-
cratic Senates had traditionally done 
with a Republican President’s nominee. 
The comments I made in 2016 were all 
in that context of divided government. 
In fact, in that same op-ed, I warned 
that divided government is not ‘‘the 
time to go through what would be a 
highly contentious process with a very 
high likelihood the nominee would not 
be confirmed.’’ I did not believe that 
Judge Garland would have been con-
firmed. I thought it was not a good re-
sult to have that kind of highly con-
tentious process for the institution of 
the Supreme Court or for the Senate. 
Now, of course, we have a very dif-
ferent situation. We have a President 
and a Senate of the same party. In fact, 
we have a Republican Senate that was 
elected in 2016 and reelected in 2018, in 
part, to support well-qualified judges 
nominated by the President. 
No one can disagree that Judge Bar-
rett has an impressive legal back-
ground. As I have looked into her back-
ground both as a law professor at Notre 
Dame, where three times she won the 
Distinguished Teaching Award and, of 
course, in her record as a judge on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit, Judge Barrett has been highly 
regarded for her work in the legal 
world. 
By the way, she has been highly re-
garded from folks across a wide variety 
of legal philosophies. They say she is 
smart. They say she understands the 
law. They say she is well qualified. In 
fact, the American Bar Association 
said that about her when she was nomi-
nated and successfully confirmed here 
in the U.S. Senate to the circuit court, 
which, of course, is the second level, 
right below the Supreme Court. So she 
has already gone through the process 
here. She has been confirmed here. The 
American Bar Association looked at 
her and said she is well qualified, which 
is their highest rating. So my hope is 
that there will not be any argument 
about whether she is well qualified or 
not, because she clearly is. She has an 
impressive legal background. 
To me, though, her personal story is 
as impressive as her legal career. After 
earning a full ride to Notre Dame Law 
and graduating first in her class, she 
earned a prestigious clerkship on the 
Supreme Court for Justice Antonin 
Scalia. She then married Jesse Barrett, 
a classmate of hers at Notre Dame, and 
is raising seven wonderful children— 
two adopted from Haiti—all while ad-
vancing her own extraordinary career 
in the law. Frankly, I think she is a 
great model for working parents every-
where. 
As we heard during her last con-
firmation to the circuit court, when we 
talked about her right here on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate, she was admired as 
a good person. Colleagues at Notre 
Dame, her students at Notre Dame, and 
others from across the political spec-
trum have called her fair. They have 
called her compassionate. They have 
said she is a good person. 
Apart from those legal qualifications 
and the character, I think it is fair for 
the Senate to insist on knowing a 
judge’s judicial philosophy. My view is 
that it is the role of Supreme Court 
Justices to fairly and impartially apply 
the law and protect our rights guaran-
teed by the Constitution but not to ad-
vance their personal preferences or 
even their policy goals. That is not the 
job of judges. They are not supposed to 
be like us, legislators. They are not 
supposed to legislate from the bench. 
They are supposed to follow the Con-
stitution, follow precedent. 
It is no understatement to say that 
Judge Barrett is being interviewed for 
one of the most important jobs in the 
country. That is why it is important 
we do get a fair and accurate picture of 
her judicial philosophy. Do you know 
what? Her judicial philosophy lines up 
with what I think is right for the Court 
but, more importantly, what most 
Americans think is right for the Court. 
As an opinion piece in the Wall 
Street Journal put it recently, Judge 
Barrett’s body of work puts her ‘‘at the 
center of the mainstream consensus on 
the judge’s role as an arbiter, not a 
lawmaker, who abides by the duty to 
enforce the law as written.’’ That is 
her record. That is the philosophy she 
talked about as she was confirmed by 
this body just a couple of years ago. 
While I know that judicial nomina-
tions have become incredibly partisan 
around here, my hope is that Judge 
Barrett will be given a thorough and a 
fair evaluation from both sides of the 
aisle. To that end, I hope my Demo-
cratic colleagues will at least meet 
with Judge Barrett and engage with 
her on any concerns they might have 
rather than dismiss her nomination 
out of hand, and I hope that those who 
end up opposing her will be able to do 
so without resorting to the kind of 
character assassination we saw with 
Judge Kavanaugh. 
I look forward to the 4 days of Judici-
ary Committee hearings that have al-
ready been announced by Chairman 
GRAHAM. This will give all members of 
the committee plenty of time to ask 
questions, to express their views, and 
to have the dialogue that they are 
looking for. I will be joining millions of 
Americans in watching those pro-
ceedings. 
I will also look forward to my one- 
on-one meeting with her. This will give 
me a chance to further assess Judge 
Barrett’s character, temperament, and 
legal philosophy. 
My hope is that my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle will also take 
the opportunity to fairly review her 
character, her judicial temperament, 
and her legal qualifications, which are 
so impressive, and do so in a respectful 
manner. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING REV. LEON 
FINNEY, JR. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on July 
17, America lost two giants of justice: 
Congressman John Lewis and the Rev-
erend C.T. Vivian. Sixty years ago, 
John Lewis was the youngest member 
of Dr. Martin Luther King’s inner cir-
cle, and C.T. Vivian was Dr. King’s 
field marshal, organizing support for 
the civil rights movement throughout 
America. In 1966, when Martin Luther 
King moved to Chicago to help break 
the grip of slumlords on mostly poor 
communities of color, C.T. Vivian 
came with him. 
Earlier this month, we lost another 
civil rights legend, a man who re-
mained in Chicago after Dr. King and 
Rev. Vivian left and who continued the 
fight for the next 60 years for racial, 
social, and economic justice for people 
and communities of color in Chicago. 
The Rev. Leon Finney, Jr., was laid 
to rest this past weekend following his 
home going service at the church he 
pastored for the last 20 years, the Met-
ropolitan 
Apostolic 
Church 
in 
Bronzeville. Among those paying trib-
ute to Rev. Finney at his home going 
were Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and 
Cook County Board President Toni 
Preckwinkle. They are among more 
than two generations of Chicago lead-
ers whose careers in public service Rev. 
Finney helped to nurture. Another pub-
lic servant whose work as a community 
organizer on the South Side of Chicago 
was was inspired in part by Rev. 
Finney couldn’t attend the service but 
paid his respects in a letter read by 
Rev. Finney’s granddaughter. 
‘‘Doc was always there for us,’’ the 
letter read. It was signed: ‘‘Barack 
Obama.’’ In the 1960s, after Dr. King 
and Rev. Vivian had left Chicago, Leon 
Finney stayed. He understood that 
progress is a long march. Systemic rac-
ism and deep, generational poverty 
can’t be eliminated in a year or two. 
Real change, real progress requires sus-
tained commitment and effort. It re-
quires 
strategy, 
not 
just 
slogans. 
Above all, Rev. Finney understood that 
real progress can’t be delivered from 
outside or imposed from above. It has 
to come from the people who live in a 
community. He believed in power of 
grassroots democracy to transform in-
dividual lives and whole communities. 
Leon Finney was a Chicagoan by 
choice, not birth. He was born 82 years 
ago in Louise, MS., the eldest of six 
children. His father, Leon Sr., moved 
the family north to Chicago when his 
children were young, part of the Great 
Migration. In 1940, his dad opened his 
first restaurant, Leon’s Bar-B-Q, in 
Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood. In 
its heyday, Leon’s had four locations 
throughout the South Side. Leon Sr. 
was Chicago’s ‘‘Bar-B-Q King.’’ 
In the early 1960s, Leon Jr. enlisted 
in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served as 
a military police officer and criminal 
investigator. After the Marines, he re-
turned to Chicago and founded Christ 
Apostolic Church in Woodlawn. He 
served as its pastor for two decades, 
until that church merged with Metro-
politan Apostolic Community Church— 
‘‘The Met’’—where he served as senior 
pastor. 
As his longtime friend and fellow ac-
tivist, Father Michael Pfleger said: 
Rev. Finney was ‘‘one of the few pas-
tors who still understood that just the 
DNA of the gospel.’’ It wasn’t enough 
to preach about justice on Sunday 
mornings. Rev. Finney believed that 
you needed to work for justice every 
day. 
In 1964 Rev. Finney joined The 
Woodlawn Organization, or TWO, a 
grassroots group founded by the leg-
endary organizer Saul Alinsky. He 
joined forces with another South Side 
civil rights legend, Bishop Arthur Bra-
zier, who had marched with Dr. King in 
Chicago. In 1967, he became TWO’s ex-
ecutive director. In 1969, TWO created a 
nonprofit 
development 
organization, 
WCDC—the Woodlawn Community De-
velopment 
Corporation—and 
named 
Rev. Finney as its president. 
TWO organized Woodlawn residents 
to stand up to absentee slumlords, who 
owned 
much 
of 
the 
housing 
in 
Woodlawn and other low-income neigh-
borhoods on the South and West sides. 
It pushed back against plans by the 
University of Chicago to expand its 
campus south, into Woodlawn, plans 
that would have driven out longtime 
Woodlawn residents and businesses. 
The group also fought against ‘‘sub-
standard, segregated housing, high un-
employment, poor schools, inadequate 
public services, community health con-
cerns and other persistent social prob-
lems.’’ 
Over the years, WCDC helped attract 
more than $300 million in commercial 
and 
residential 
development 
in 
‘‘uninvestable’’ communities. The or-
ganization 
developed 
nearly 
1,700 
apartments and homes for low- and 
moderate-income families, mostly in 
Woodlawn but throughout the South 
Side. It managed 9,000 rental apart-
ments in Chicago and Gary, IN. It em-
ployed 400 Black men and women, as 
many or more than almost any other 
employer in Chicago except for govern-
ment. Many of its early victories were 
achieved before the creation of real es-
tate 
investment 
trusts, 
affordable 
housing tax credits, enterprise zones, 
and other government incentive pro-
grams to attract capital to low-income 
and minority neighborhoods. TWO and 
WCDC became national models for 
community investment a revitaliza-
tion. 
Rev. Finney forged alliances with 
elected leaders because he wanted to 
have a seat at the table when the inter-
ests of his community were being de-
cided. He was appointed to powerful 
government boards, including the Chi-
cago Housing Authority, the Chicago 
Plan 
Commission, 
the 
Monitoring 
Commission for School Desegregation 
for Chicago Public Schools, and Chi-
cago State University. 
In 1993, he joined the faculty of 
McCormick Theological Seminary on 
the University of Chicago campus. As a 
professor of African American Leader-
ship Studies and executive director of 
the seminary’s African American Lead-
ership Partnership, he helped train 
scores of new ministers in the work of 
the social gospel. 
He was not without fault. As he aged 
and the real estate industry became in-
creasingly complex, WCDC sometimes 
struggled to pace with the changes and 
missteps occurred. But despite the con-
troversy, the imprint that Rev. Finney 
left on the South Side of Chicago and 
the good he achieved is profound. 
In recent years, he suffered a series 
of 
health 
setbacks, 
but 
he 
never 
stopped working for justice. At his fu-
neral, a community developer who Rev. 
Finney helped train recalled a recent 
conversation they had about today’s 
new movement for racial reckoning.

next time?’’ he asked. Like the marine 
he was, he remained focused and dis-
ciplined to the end. 
He was proud and optimistic that a 
part of Jackson Park would be home to 
the new Obama Presidential Library. 
Not only would the library bring new 
investment and opportunities to the 
South Side, it would remind the young 
people, especially the Black and Brown 
children, who live there about what is 
possible for them. 
In a 2015 column, Rev. Finney wrote: 
‘‘The young among us today, many of 
them, will grow up believing anyone 
can become president, regardless of 
race. But some of us can remember 
when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 
Brown vs. Board of Education that sep-
arate was not equal; some are old 
enough to have marched on Wash-
ington. Those events signaled the end 
of legal segregation in this country. 
But we never dreamed we would see a 
man of African heritage elected presi-
dent—not in our lifetimes.’’ The South 
Side, the community that was home to 
Harold Washington, Richard Wright, 
Mahalia Jackson, and many other pio-
neers for racial justice, was the right 
home, 
he 
said, 
for 
the 
President 
Obama’s library. 
Loretta and I offer our condolences 
to Rev. Finney’s many friends, col-
leagues, students, and especially to his 
family: his son Leon III, his daughter 
Kristian Finney-Cooke, his son-in-law 
Dr. Gerald Cooke, and his three grand-
children. 
Several years ago, McCormick Theo-
logical Seminary held a gathering to 
honor Rev. Finney. The occasion was 
the 20th anniversary of the program he 
had founded to train African-American 
ministers. Graduates of the program, 
including many community leaders, 
spoke of the profound influence Rev. 
Finney had had on their lives. When it 
came time for him to speak, Rev. 
Finney implored them to always re-
member to put the mission of the Gos-
pel before their own egos. He recited 
one of his favorite Bible passages; the 
Gospel of Luke, chapter 4, verse 18: 
‘‘The Spirit of the Lord is on me, be-
cause he has anointed me to proclaim 
good news to the poor. He has sent me 
to proclaim freedom for the prisoners 
and recovery of sight for the blind, to 
set the oppressed free.’’ 
Leon Finney remained true to his 
mission. Martin Luther King and C.T. 
Vivian helped sketch a vision for a new 
Chicago, but Leon Finney worked for 
more than 50 years to make that bet-
ter, fairer Chicago a reality. The good 
he achieved will benefit our city, our 
State, and our Nation for years to 
come. 
f 
REMEMBERING GALE SAYERS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when 
Chicago Bears football great Gale Say-
ers was on the field, you knew some-
thing extraordinary would happen. 
The press labeled him the ‘‘Kansas 
Comet.’’ His teammates called him 
‘‘Magic.’’ He did things in the NFL 
that had not been seen before, and few 
have come close to matching decades 
later. 
Gale famously said that all he needed 
was 18 inches of daylight before he 
would change a game’s dynamic. He 
was an unmatched running back, a star 
receiver, 
and 
his 
kick 
returning 
records remain to this day. But with 
everything with Gale, there was never 
enough time. His legendary career was 
cut short by injury. 
He passed away recently, and today, 
we pay our respect to an extraordinary 
life. 
Gale Eugene Sayers was born in 
Wichita, KS, in 1943. His father was a 
mechanic and a car polisher, and his 
mother was a homemaker. His family 
moved to Omaha, NE, in the early fif-
ties, and Gale had his chance to play 
sports for the first time there. At the 
age of 13, he was playing kids who were 
19 and 20 years old. Gale learned early 
on that he didn’t want to be tackled by 
larger people, so he made sure he 
wasn’t. In high school, he was not only 
a star running back, but he was also a 
track star. His record in long jump 
stood for 44 years. 
Dozens of colleges offered Gale schol-
arships, but he chose Kansas Univer-
sity because he liked the coach and 
that it was relatively close to home. 
There, he was dubbed the Kansas 
Comet. He was the first player in 
NCAA Division 1A history to record a 
99-yard 
run 
when 
he 
broke 
loose 
against the University of Nebraska in 
1963. His two-time All-American honors 
led to the Bears picking him as the No. 
4 overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft. 
Gale Sayers’ NFL career began like 
lightning. He returned a punt 77 yards 
in his first preseason game, returned a 
kickoff 93 yards, and threw a touch-
down pass with his nondominant hand. 
For the season, he led the league in all- 
purpose yards and set the league record 
at the time of 22 touchdowns, earning 
the rookie of the year award. 
Wrigley Field is famously the home 
of the Chicago Cubs, but the greatest 
performance on that field was by Gale 
Sayers. The Chicago Bears played there 
from 1921 to 1970. In December 1965, 
Wrigley Field’s playing surface was 
terrible. Players of both the Chicago 
Bears and San Francisco 49ers were 
struggling to keep their footing in the 
rain, but Gale wasn’t one of them. He 
scored six touchdowns that day. He 
might have scored seven or eight, but 
with a lopsided score, Bears Coach 
George Halas sat him down. The 49ers 
went on to form a special defense just 
for Gale Sayers. 
Sayers had many brilliant games, but 
one of the revolutionary moments his 
life was off the field when he was room-
mates with fullback Brian Piccolo. 
Sayers and Piccolo were the NFL’s 
first interracial roommate duo. When 
many lines were drawn between Black 
and White players, Sayers and Piccolo 
set a new path for the league. They be-
came best friends. 
On November 10, 1968, the Bears faced 
the 49ers again, and Sayers took a toss 
run play like he had done so many 
times. The 49ers defensive player put 
his shoulder into Sayers’ knee, and it 
bent sideways. Sayers needed to be 
carted off the field. His knee would 
never be the same. The rehabilitation 
program was difficult, but with Pic-
colo’s encouragement, Sayers was able 
to return the following year. 
Gale returned to playing in 1969, 
earning the NFL Comeback Player of 
the Year, but Piccolo became ill. Pic-
colo was coughing for weeks, and he 
was diagnosed with embryonic cell car-
cinoma. 
He underwent surgery, but the dis-
ease had spread to other organs. In 
May, Gale earned the George S. Halas 
Award, 
an 
award 
recognizing 
the 
league’s most courageous player. In his 
speech for the award, Gale dedicated it 
to Brian Piccolo. Piccolo died on June 
16, 1970, at the age of 26. Gale was a 
pallbearer at the funeral. The chapter 
on their friendship in Gale’s autobiog-
raphy, ‘‘I Am Third,’’ is the basis of the 
1971 movie ‘‘Brian’s Song,’’ the most- 
watched TV movie in history at the 
time. 
In 1971, Gale suffered another knee 
injury, and it was never right again. He 
retired in 1972 at the age of 29. It is a 
testament to the extraordinary talent 
of Gale Sayers, only playing 68 games, 
that in 1977, he was Ge youngest player 
ever to be voted into the NFL Hall of 
Fame at the age of 34. His statistics 
still remain competitive and as records 
decades later. 
After his NFL career, Gale returned 
to the University of Kansas as an as-
sistant athletic director and student. 
He completed his bachelor’s degree in 
physical education in 1975 and received 
a master’s degree in educational ad-
ministration in 1977. He was the ath-
letic director at Southern Illinois Uni-
versity until 1981. Gale also supported 
the Cradle, a Chicago-area adoption 
agency that launched the Ardythe and 
Gale Sayers Center for African Amer-
ican Adoption in 1999. In 2007, Gale tes-
tified in Congress along with several 
other players that the NFL needed to 
improve its disability benefits system 
for retired players. 
Sayers 
is 
survived 
by 
his 
wife 
Ardythe Elaine Bullard, his brothers 
Roger and Ron, his sons Timothy and 
Scott, his daughter Gale Lynne, and 
his stepsons Guy, Gaylon, and Gary.

TRIBUTE TO MARK GUETHLE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Mark 
Guethle probably isn’t the sort of per-
son you picture when you hear the 
word ‘‘feminist.’’ Mark is a big guy: 6- 
foot-1, strong and muscular. It is easy 
to imagine him as the star linebacker 
he was in high school. He spent decades 
as a labor leader in the building trades, 
one of the toughest, most manhood- 
driven segments of the American labor 
movement. But Mark Guethle has 
worked harder to help good women get

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5935 
September 30, 2020 
elected to public office in my State of 
Illinois than almost any man I know. 
At a time when many Americans feel 
understandably dismayed about the 
state of our politics, Mark Guethle has 
helped to introduce new candidates, 
new leaders, new ideas, and a cautious 
new sense of hope in government and 
hope in the future in Kane County, IL, 
one of the ‘‘collar counties’’ sur-
rounding Chicago. That is what Mark 
has achieved in nearly 20 years as 
chairman of the Kane County Demo-
cratic Party. But that is just one part 
of Mark’s story and his busy life. 
In addition, since 2003, Mark has 
served as a member of his town’s coun-
cil, the North Aurora Village Board of 
Trustees. On top of all of that, for 
nearly 
a 
quarter 
century, 
Mark 
Guethle has been a union leader with 
Painters District Council 30, Local 
Union 97, which covers most of north- 
central Illinois outside of Chicago. 
This past month, Mark retired from his 
union job: director of government af-
fairs for of Painters District Council 30. 
He leaves with a proud record of 
achievement. 
Interestingly, he didn’t start out to 
be a labor leader or a painter. At Pro-
viso West High School in Hillside, IL, 
he was a star athlete in three sports: 
baseball, basketball, and football. It 
was his performance as a linebacker 
that drew the most attention. He was 
recruited 
by 
coaching 
legend 
Bo 
Schembechler to play for one of the 
best college football teams in the Na-
tion, the University of Michigan Wol-
verines, but a bad accident during the 
summer after his high school gradua-
tion set his life on a different course. 
During a robbery at a gas station 
where he was working, Mark’s arm was 
badly injured by a piece of shattered 
glass. The University of Michigan said 
it would wait for Mark’s arm to heal 
but Mark’s dad, a union carpenter, sug-
gested that Mark try a different path 
and join his union. Mark agreed, but 
the carpenters weren’t taking new 
members at that time. 
Mark’s uncle, a union painter, sug-
gested he try the painters union. He 
was hired as an apprentice at the age of 
19. As it turned out, Mark had just the 
personal qualities that a good painter 
needs: attention to detail, a tenacious 
work ethic, and an unusual ability to 
listen to people and understand what 
they want. He started as an organizer 
for District Council 30 in 1997. Five 
years later, he was hired as the district 
council’s governmental affairs direc-
tor, the position he held until he re-
tired from the union at the start of 
this month. 
As a labor leader, Mark fought for re-
spect and fair treatment not only for 
members of his union but for all work-
ing people in the State of Illinois. The 
list of State laws that he has helped 
enact is long and impressive. It in-
cludes increasing Illinois’ minimum 
wage, 
protecting 
overtime 
pay, 
strengthening 
collective 
bargaining 
rights and the prevailing wage in our 
State, and encouraging better labor- 
management relations through the use 
of 
project-management 
agreements. 
Mark has also taken courageous stands 
on issues including immigrant rights, 
women’s rights, and marriage equality. 
Mark’s commitment to social and 
economic justice and his nuts-and-bolts 
understanding of how politics works 
are qualities he acquired growing up in 
a politically active union family. He 
learned how to knock on doors and dis-
tribute yard signs for candidates when 
he was just a kid, and at age 60, he still 
spends an incredible amount of time 
and energy on such tasks. When there 
is work to be done, whether its phone 
banking or neighborhood canvassing, 
you can be sure that Mark will be the 
first to arrive and the last to quit. 
When Mark was elected Kane County 
Democratic chair in 2002, there were no 
Democrats in the county serving at the 
State or Federal level—none. Today, 
Democrats hold every congressional 
seat serving the county. One of those 
House members, LAUREN UNDERWOOD, 
is the only nurse now serving in Con-
gress. In the Illinois General Assembly, 
Kane County is represented by two 
Democratic senators and four house 
members, all of them women. 
‘‘We run women because we want to 
win,’’ is how Mark once described his 
recruitment strategy. I suspect there is 
a little more to it. You see, Mark’s 
mother was a brilliant woman who 
graduated from the University of Chi-
cago when she was 16 years old, but 
like so many women of her generation, 
her career choices were limited because 
of her gender. She died when Mark was 
22 years old, but she inspired in Mark 
and her other four children a profound 
belief in what women could achieve if 
given a fair chance. 
Mark Guethle is the embodiment of 
grassroots democracy. The people of 
Kane County and all Illinois’ working 
families owe a lot to Mark and to his 
mom, Loretta. Mark is also respected 
by Republicans as a man of principles. 
One of his close friends, North Aurora 
mayor Dale Berman, was a lifelong Re-
publican who Mark actually persuaded, 
by example, to become a Democrat. 
Stepping down from the union job 
will leave Mark more time for his work 
with his town’s board of trustees and 
the Kane County Democratic Party. It 
will mean more time for Mark and 
Louise, his wife of 31 years, to perform 
in their church choir. Mark will have 
more time to watch his beloved Chi-
cago Cubs—on TV for now, rather than 
in the bleachers, which he prefers. He 
will have more time for playing key-
boards in his cover band and more time 
to practice on his guitar and ukulele, 
and he will have more time to spend 
with his sons, Marcus and Brian, and 
his four grand-daughters, whom he 
adores. 
Lastly, I am certain that Mark will 
spend even more time listening to his 
neighbors in Kane County and finding 
new ways to make government work 
for them, regardless of their political 
party, because that is what he cares 
most about. I am proud to call Mark 
my friend, and Loretta and I wish him 
and Louise all the best as they begin 
this new chapter of their lives.

absent due to an urgent family matter

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AN/ALR–56M is a computer con-
trolled radar warning receiver (RWR). It 
monitors the environment in an effort to de-
tect radar signals. Upon detection and iden-
tification of a valid radar signal, emitter 
identification is conveyed to the AN/ALE–47 
countermeasures 
dispenser 
system. 
The 
ALR–56M has thirteen line replaceable units 
(LRUs): four I/J band DF receivers, an Anal-
ysis Processor, a Superhet Controller, a 
Superhet Receiver, a C/D band Receiver/ 
Power supply, four I/J band antennas, and 
one C/D band antenna. 
2. The AN/ALE–47 Counter-Measures Dis-
pensing System (CMDS) is an integrated, 
threat-adaptive, software-programmable dis-
pensing system capable of dispending chaff, 
flares, 
and 
active 
radio 
frequency 
expendables. 
The 
system 
is 
internally 
mounted and may be operated as a stand- 
alone system or may be integrated with 
other on-board electronic warfare and avi-
onics systems. The AN/ALE–47 uses data re-
ceived over the aircraft interfaces to assess 
the threat situation and to determine a re-
sponse. 
3. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures which might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
5. A determination has been made that the 
recipient country can provide the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. The sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives outline in the Policy Justifica-
tion. 
6. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of India.

nical Services (CETS) and Autonomic Logis-
tics and Global Support (ALGS). 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–35A Conventional Take Off and 
Landing (CTOL) aircraft is a single-seat, sin-
gle engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-genera-
tion, multirole aircraft. It contains sensitive 
technology including the low observable air-
frame/outer mold line, the Pratt and Whit-
ney F135 engine, AN/APG–81 radar, an inte-
grated core processor central computer, a 
mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a 
multiple sensor suite, technical data/docu-
mentation and associated software. Sen-
sitive elements of the F–35A are also in-
cluded in operational flight and maintenance 
trainers. Sensitive and classified elements of 
the F–35A CTOL aircraft include hardware, 
accessories, components, and associated soft-
ware for the following major subsystems: 
a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a 
single 40,000-lb thrust class engine designed 
for the F–35 and assures highly reliable, af-
fordable performance. The engine is designed 
to be utilized in all F–35 variants, providing 
unmatched commonality and supportability 
throughout the worldwide base of F–35 users. 
b. The AN/APG–81 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) is a high processing 
power/high transmission power electronic 
array capable of detecting air and ground 
targets from a greater distance than me-
chanically scanned array radars. It also con-
tains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 
which creates high-resolution ground maps 
and provides weather data to the pilot, and 
provides air and ground tracks to the mis-
sion system, which uses it as a component to 
fuse sensor data. 
c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System 
(EOTS) provides long-range detection and 
tracking as well as an infrared search and 
track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared 
(FUR) capability for precision tracking, 
weapons delivery and bomb damage assess-
ment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple 
separate internal or podded systems typi-
cally found on legacy aircraft. 
d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aper-
ture System (EODAS) provides the pilot with 
full spherical coverage for air-to-air and air- 
to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
enhancements, a fire control capability and 
precision tracking of wingmen/friendly air-
craft. The EODAS provides data directly to 
the pilot’s helmet as well as the mission sys-
tem. 
e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
reprogrammable, integrated system that 
provides radar warning and electronic sup-
port measures (ESM) along with a fully inte-
grated countermeasures (CM) system. The 
EW system is the primary subsystem used to 
enhance situational awareness, targeting 
support and self-defense through the search, 
intercept, location and identification of in- 
band emitters and to automatically counter 
IR and RF threats. 
f. The Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers and Intelligence/Commu-
nications, Navigation, and Identification 
(C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with un-
matched connectivity to flight members, co-
alition forces and the battlefield. It is an in-
tegrated subsystem designed to provide a

broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and 
data communications, precision radio navi-
gation and landing capability, self-identi-
fication, beyond visual range target identi-
fication 
and 
connectivity 
to 
off-board 
sources of information. It also includes an 
inertial navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) for precise location informa-
tion. The functionality is tightly integrated 
within the mission system to enhance effi-
ciency. 
g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes 
two data links: the Multi-Function Advanced 
Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The MADL 
is designed specifically for the F–35 and al-
lows for stealthy communications between 
F–35s. Link 16 data link equipment allows 
the F–35 to communicate with legacy air-
craft using widely-distributed J-series mes-
sage protocols. 
h. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Global 
Sustainment (ALGS) provides a fully inte-
grated logistics management solution. ALGS 
integrates a number of functional areas, in-
cluding supply chain management, repair, 
support 
equipment, 
engine 
support 
and 
training. The ALGS infrastructure employs 
a state-of-the-art information system that 
provides real-time, decision-worthy informa-
tion for sustainment decisions by flight line 
personnel. 
Prognostic 
health 
monitoring 
technology is integrated with the air system 
and is crucial to predictive maintenance of 
vital components. 
i. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Informa-
tion System (ALIS) provides an intelligent 
information infrastructure that binds all the 
key concepts of ALGS into an effective sup-
port system. ALIS establishes the appro-
priate interfaces among the F–35 Air Vehicle, 
the warfighter, the training system, govern-
ment information technology (IT) systems, 
and supporting commercial enterprise sys-
tems. Additionally, ALIS provides a com-
prehensive tool for data collection and anal-
ysis, decision support and action tracking. 
j. The F–35 Training System includes sev-
eral training devices to provide integrated 
training for pilots and maintainers. The 
pilot training devices include a Full Mission 
Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission 
Rehearsal Trainer (DMRT). The maintenance 
training devices include an Aircraft Systems 
Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection Sys-
tem Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer 
Mold Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear 
Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine 
Module Trainer and Weapons Loading Train-
er (WLT). The F–35 Training System can be 
integrated, where both pilots and maintain-
ers learn in the same Integrated Training 
Center (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and 
maintainers can train in separate facilities 
(Pilot Training Center and Maintenance 
Training Center). 
k. Other subsystems, features, and capa-
bilities include the F–35’s low observable air 
frame, Integrated Core Processor (ICP) Cen-
tral Computer, Helmet Mounted Display Sys-
tem (HMDS), Pilot Life Support System 
(PLSS), Off-Board Mission Support (OMS) 
System, 
and 
publications/maintenance 
manuals. The HMDS provides a fully sun-
light readable, biocular display presentation 
of aircraft information projected onto the pi-
lot’s helmet visor. The use of a night vision 
camera integrated into the helmet elimi-
nates the need for separate Night Vision 
Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of 
Pilot Chemical, Biological, and Radiological 
Protection through use of an On-Board Oxy-
gen Generating System (OBOGS); and an es-
cape system that provides additional protec-
tion to the pilot. OBOGS takes the Power 
and Thermal Management System (PTMS) 
air and enriches it by removing gases (main-
ly nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increas-
ing the concentration of oxygen in the prod-
uct gas and supplying breathable air to the 
pilot. The OMS provides a mission planning, 
mission briefing, and a maintenance/intel-
ligence/tactical debriefing platform for the 
F–35. 
2. The Reprogramming Center is located in 
the United States and provides F–35 cus-
tomers with a means to update F–35 EW 
databases. 
3. The AIM–9X Block II and Block II+ 
(Plus) SIDEWINDER Missile represents a 
substantial increase in missile acquisition 
and kinematics performance over the AIM– 
9M and replaces the AIM–9X Block I Missile 
configuration. The missile includes a high 
off-boresight 
seeker, 
enhanced 
counter-
measure rejection capability, low drag/high 
angle of attack airframe and the ability to 
integrate with a helmet mounted cueing sys-
tem. The software algorithms are the most 
sensitive portion of the AIM–9X missile. The 
software continues to be modified via a 
preplanned product improvement (P3I) pro-
gram to improve counter-countermeasure 
capabilities. Purchase will include AIM–9X 
Guidance Sections. 
4. The GBU–54 Laser Joint Direct Attack 
Munition (LJDAM) is a 500 pound JDAM 
which incorporates all the capabilities of the 
JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision 
laser guidance set. The LJDAM gives the 
weapon system an optional semi-active laser 
guidance in addition to the Inertial Naviga-
tion 
System/Global 
Positioning 
System 
(INS/GPS) guidance. This provides the op-
tional capability to strike moving targets. 
The GBU–54 consists of a laser guidance set, 
KMU–572 warhead specific tail kit, and MK– 
82 bomb body. 
5. The GBU–53/B Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement II (SDB II) is a 250–lb class 
precisionguided, semi-autonomous, conven-
tional, air-to-ground munition used to defeat 
moving targets through adverse weather 
from 
standoff 
range. 
The 
SDB 
II 
has 
deployable wings and fins and uses GPS/INS 
guidance, network-enabled datalink (Link–16 
and UHF), and a multi-mode seeker (milli-
meter wave radar, imaging infrared) to au-
tonomously search, acquire, track, and de-
feat targets. The SDB II employs a multi-ef-
fects warhead (Blast, Fragmentation, and 
Shaped-Charge) 
for 
maximum 
lethality 
against armored and soft targets. The SDB II 
weapon system consists of the AUR weapon; 
a 4-place common carriage system; and mis-
sion planning system application. 
a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) is an 
SDB II configuration used for land or sea 
range-based testing of the SDB II weapon 
system. The GTV has common flight charac-
teristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of 
the multi-effects warhead is a Flight Termi-
nation, Tracking, and Telemetry (FTTT) 
subassembly that mirrors the AUR multi-
effects warhead’s size and mass properties, 
but provides safe flight termination, free 
flight tracking and telemetry of encrypted 
data from the GTV to the data receivers. The 
SDB II GTV can have either inert or live 
fuses. All other flight control, guidance, 
data-link, and seeker functions are rep-
resentative of the SDB II AUR. 
b. SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Test 
(CCRT) vehicles are an SDB II configuration 
primarily used for reliability data collection 
during carriage. The CCRT has common 
characteristics of an SDB II AUR but with 
an inert warhead and fuze. The CCRT has an 
inert mass in place of the warhead that mim-
ics the warhead’s mass properties. The CCRT 
is a flight capable representative of the SDB 
II AUR but is not approved for release from 
any aircraft. Since all other flight control, 
guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are 
representative of the SDB II AUR, this con-
figuration could be used for any purpose 
where an inert round without telemetry or 
termination capability would be useful. 
6. This sale will involve the release of sen-
sitive and/or classified technology. The high-
est level of classification of information in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
7. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar advanced capabili-
ties. 
8. A determination has been made that 
Switzerland can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification. 
9. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Switzer-
land.

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a friendly European nation that continues to 
be an important force for political stability 
and economic progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Switzer-
land’s capability to meet current and future 
threats. Switzerland currently operates the 
Boeing F/A–18C/D, but that aircraft is reach-
ing end-of-life and will be replaced by the 
winner of Switzerland’s New Fighter Aircraft 
competition, for which the F/A–18E/F is 
being considered. The primary missions of 
the aircraft and associated weapons will be 
policing the airspace above Switzerland and 
providing 
national 
defense 
capabilities. 
Switzerland will have no difficulty absorbing 
these aircraft into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be The Boe-
ing Company, St. Louis, MO; Northrop 
Grumman, Los Angeles, CA; Raytheon Com-
pany, El Segundo, CA; Raytheon Missile Sys-
tems Company, Tucson, AZ; General Elec-
tric, Lynn, MA; and The Boeing Company, 
St. Charles, MO. This proposal is being of-
fered in the context of a competition. The 
purchaser typically requests offsets. Any off-
set agreement will be defined in negotiations 
between the purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of six (6) additional 
U.S. contractor representatives to Switzer-
land on an intermittent basis for a duration 
of the life of the case to support delivery of 
the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet aircraft and pro-
vide supply support management, inventory 
control, and equipment familiarization. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result, of this proposed 
sale.

from either aircraft carriers or land bases. 
The F/A–18E/F Super Hornet fills a variety of 
roles and provides air superiority, fighter es-
cort, suppression of enemy air defenses, re-
connaissance, forward air control, close and 
deep air support, and day and night strike 
missions. 
a. The AN/APG–79 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) Radar System pro-
vides the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet aircraft 
with all-weather, multi-mission capability 
for performing Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground 
targeting and attack. Air-to-Air modes pro-
vide the capability for all-aspect target de-
tection, long-range search and track, auto-
matic target acquisition, and tracking of 
multiple 
targets. 
Air-to-Surface 
attack 
modes provide high-resolution ground map-
ping navigation, weapon delivery, and sensor 
cueing. 
b. The AN/ALR–67(V)3 Electric Warfare 
Countermeasures Receiving Set provides the 
F/A–18E/F aircrew with radar threat warn-
ings by detecting and evaluating friendly 
and hostile radar frequency threat emitters 
and providing identification and status infor-
mation about the emitters to on-board Elec-
tronic Warfare (EW) equipment and the air-
crew. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) 
and User Data Files (UDF) used in the AN/ 
ALR–67(V)3 contain threat parametric data 
used to identify and establish priority of de-
tected radar emitters. 
c. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasures Dis-
pensing System is a threat-adaptive dis-
pensing system that dispenses chaff, flares, 
and expendable jammers for self-protection 
against airborne and ground-based Radio 
Frequency (RF) and Infrared threats. The 
Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mis-
sion Data Files (MDF) used in the AN/ALE– 
47 contain algorithms used to calculate the 
best defense against specific threats. 
d. The AN/ALQ–214 is an advanced airborne 
Integrated Defensive Electronic Counter-
measures (IDECM) programmable modular 
automated system capable of intercepting, 
identifying, processing received radar signals 
(pulsed and continuous) and applying an op-
timum countermeasures technique in the di-
rection of the radar signal, thereby improv-
ing individual aircraft probability of sur-
vival from a variety of Surface-to-Air and 
Air-to-Air Radio Frequency (RF) threats. 
The system operates in a standalone or Elec-
tronic Warfare (EW) suite mode. In the EW 
suite mode, the AN/ALQ–214 operates in a 
fully coordinated mode with the towed dis-
pensable decoy, Radar Warning Receiver 
(RWR), and the onboard radar in the F/A– 
18E/F Super Hornet in a coordinated, non-in-
terference manner sharing information for 
enhanced information. The AN/ALQ–214 was 
designed to operate in a high-density Elec-
tromagnetic Hostile Environment with the 
ability to identify and counter a wide vari-
ety of multiple threats, including those with 
Doppler characteristics. 
e. The AN/APX–111 Combined Interrogator/ 
Transponder (CIT) with the Conformal An-
tenna System (CAS) is a complete MARK-XII 
identification system compatible with Iden-
tification Friend or Foe (IFF) Modes 1, 2, 3/ 
A, C and 4 (secure). A single slide-in module 
that can be customized to the unique cryp-
tographic functions for a specific country 
provides the systems secure mode capabili-
ties. As a transponder, the CIT is capable or 
replying to interrogation modes 1, 2, 3/A C 
(altitude) and secure mode 4. The require-
ment is to upgrade Switzerland’s Combined 
Interrogator Transponder (CIT) AN/APX–111 
(V) IFF system software to implement Mode 
Select (Mode S) capabilities. Beginning in 
early 2005 EUROCONTROL mandated the 
civil community in Europe to transition to a 
Mode S only system and for all aircraft to be 
compliant by 2009. The Mode S Beacon Sys-
tem is a combined data link and Secondary 
Surveillance Radar (SSR) system that was 
standardized in 1985 by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Mode S 
provides air surveillance using a data link 
with a permanent unique aircraft address. 
Selective Interrogation provides higher data 
integrity, reduced Radio Frequency (RF) in-
terference levels, increased air traffic capac-
ity, and adds air-to-ground data link. 
f. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tem (JHMCS) is a modified HGU–55/P helmet 
that incorporates a visor-projected Heads-Up 
Display (HUD) to cue weapons and aircraft 
sensors to air and ground targets. In close 
combat, a pilot must currently align the air-
craft to shoot at a target. JHMCS allows the 
pilot to simply look at a target to shoot. 
This system projects visual targeting and 
aircraft performance information on the 
back of the helmet’s visor, enabling the pilot 
to monitor this information without inter-
rupting his field of view through the cockpit 
canopy, the system uses a magnetic trans-
mitter unit fixed to the pilot’s seat and a 
magnetic field probe mounted on the helmet 
to define helmet pointing positioning. A Hel-
met Vehicle Interface (HVI) interacts with 
the aircraft system bus to provide signal 
generation for the helmet display. This pro-
vides significant improvement for close com-
bat targeting and engagement. 
g. The Joint Mission Planning System 
(JMPS) will provide mission planning capa-
bility for support of military aviation oper-
ations. It will also provide support for unit- 
level mission planning for all phases of mili-
tary flight operations and have the capa-
bility to provide necessary mission data for 
the 
aircrew. 
JMPS 
will 
support 
the 
downloading of data to electronics data 
transfer devices for transfer to aircraft and 
weapon systems. A JMPS for a specific air-
craft type will consist of basic planning tools 
called the Joint Mission Planning Environ-
ment (JMPE) mated with a Unique Planning 
Component (UPC) provided by the aircraft 
program. In addition, UPCs will be required 
for specific weapons, communication devices, 
and moving map displays. The JMPS will be 
tailored to the specific releasable configura-
tion for the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet. 
h. The AN/AVS–9 Night Vision Goggles 
(NVG) provide imagery sufficient for an avi-
ator to complete night time missions down 
to starlight and extreme low light condi-
tions. The AN/AVS–9 is designed to satisfy 
the F/A–18E/F mission requirements for cov-
ert night combat, engagement, and support. 
The third generation light amplification 
tubes provide a high-performance, image-in-
tensification system for optimized F/A–18E/F 
night flying at terrain-masking altitudes. 
i. The AN/AVS–11 Night Vision Goggles 
(NVG) is capable of high resolution imaging. 
This capability allows reduced visibility 
weapon delivery. While the NVCD hardware 
is unclassified, this item requires Enhanced 
End Use Monitoring (EEUM). 
j. The AN/ALE–55 Towed Decoy improves 
aircraft survivability by providing an en-
hanced, coordinated onboard/off-board coun-
termeasure response to enemy threats. 
k. The Multifunctional Informational Dis-
tribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical 
Radio System (JTRS) a secure data and 
voice communication network using Link–16 
architecture. The system provides enhanced 
situational awareness, positive identifica-
tion of participants within the network, se-
cure fighter-to-fighter connectivity, secure 
voice 
capability, 
and 
ARN–118 
TACAN 
functionality. It provides three major func-
tions: Air Control, Wide Area Surveillance, 
and Fighter-to-Fighter. The MIDS JTRS can 
be used to transfer data in Air-to-Air, Air-to- 
Surface, and Air-to-Ground scenarios. The 
MIDS Enhanced Interference Blanking Unit 
(EIBU) provides validation and verification 
of equipment and concept. EIBU enhances 
input/output signal capacity of the MIDS 
JTRS and addresses parts obsolescence. 
1. LAU–127E/A Guided Missile Launchers 
designed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet 
aircraft to carry and launch missiles. It pro-
vides the electrical and mechanical interface 
between the missile and launch aircraft as 
well as the two-way data transfer between 
missile and cockpit controls and displays to 
support preflight orientation and control cir-
cuits to prepare and launch the missile. 
m. Accurate Navigation (ANAV) Global 
Positioning System (GPS) also includes Key 
Loading Installation and Facility Charges. 
The ANAV is a 24–channel SAASM based 
pulse-per-second GPS receiver built for next

has embedded software with programmable 
cryptography for secure communications. 
o. AN/PYQ–1O(C) is the next generation of 
the currently fielded AN/CYZ–10 Data Trans-
fer Device (DTD). The AN/PYQ–1O(C) pro-
vides automated, secure and user-friendly 
methods for managing and distributing cryp-
tographic key material, Signal Operating In-
structions (SOI), and Electronic Protection 
data. This course introduces some of the 
basic components and activities associated 
with the AN/PYQ–1O(C) in addition to hands- 
on training. Learners will become familiar 
with the security features of the SKL, prac-
tice the initial setup of the SKL, and will re-
ceive and distribute electronic keys using 
the SKL. 
p. KIV–78 Dual Channel Encryptor Mode 4/

ing Infrared (ATFLIR)/or other targeting pod 
is a multi-sensor, electro-optical targeting 
pod incorporating infrared, low-light tele-
vision camera, laser range finder/target des-
ignator, and laser spot tracker. It is used to 
provide navigation and targeting for mili-
tary aircraft in adverse weather and using 
precision-guided weapons such as laser-guid-
ed bombs. It offers much greater target reso-
lution and imagery accuracy than previous 
systems.

designed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet 
aircraft to carry and launch missiles. Two 
launchers, one left hand and one right hand, 
are installed in the underside of the aircraft 
fuselage at stations 4 and 6. The launchers 
are recessed in cavities within the aircraft 
fuselage, allowing the missiles to be semi re-
cessed 
for 
aerodynamic 
purposes. 
Both 
versions of the LAU–116 are ejection launch-
ers. 
z. LAU–118A Guided Missile Launchers de-
signed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet air-
craft to carry and launch missiles. It pro-
vides the electrical and mechanical interface 
between the missile and launch aircraft, as 
well as the two-way data transfer between 
missile and cockpit controls and displays to 
support preflight orientation and control cir-
cuits to prepare and launch the missile. 
aa. Cartridge Actuated Devices (CADs) are 
designed for the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet as 
small explosive devices used to eject stores 
from launched devices, actuate other explo-
sive systems, or provide initiation for air-
crew escape devices. Propellant Actuated De-
vices (PADs) are a tool or specialized mecha-
nized device or gas generator system that is 
activated by a propellant or releases or di-
rects work through a propellant charge. 
Weapons release, aircraft ejection, life sup-
port, and fire-suppression systems are some 
facets that rely heavily on CADs and PADs. 
bb. Books and Other Publications includes 
flight manuals, technical manuals and sup-
port of technical data and updates, release 
and distribution of classified publications for 
the operation and/or maintenance of the F/ 
A–18E/F aircraft or systems. 
cc. Software provides for initial design and 
development of the Electronic Warfare Soft-
ware suite which encompasses AN/ALQ–214, 
AN/ALE–47, ALE–55, ALR–67, as part of the 
System Configuration Set (SCS) builds. 
dd. Technical Data provides for the F/A– 
18E/F post-production of classified test re-
ports and other related documentation. 
ee. Training Aide and Devices provides for 
upgraded classified lessons, hardware and in-
stallation 
for 
the 
Tactical 
Operational 
Flight Trainers (TOFT), Low Cost Trainers 
(LCT), Aircrew courseware and spares for de-
livery and installation of Systems Configu-
ration Sets (SCS). 
ff. The AIM–9X Block II SIDEWINDER 
Missile is a supersonic, short-range Air-to- 
Air (A/A) guided missile which employs a 
passive Infrared (IR) target acquisition sys-
tem, proportional navigational guidance, 
and a closed-loop position servo Fin Actu-
ator Unit (FAU). It represents a substantial 
increase in missile acquisition and kine-
matics performance over the AIM–9M and re-
places the AIM–9X Block I Missile configura-
tion. The missile includes a high off- 
boresight seeker, enhanced countermeasure 
rejection capability, low drag/high angle of 
attack airframe and the ability to integrate 
the Helmet Mounted Cueing System. The 
software algorithms are the most sensitive 
portion of the AIM–9X missile. The software 
continues to be modified via a pre-planned 
product improvement (P3I) program in order 
to improve its counter-countermeasure capa-
bilities. No software source code or algo-
rithms will be released. 
gg. AIM–9X BLK II Captive Air Training 
Missile (CATM) is a flight certified inert 
mass simulator with a functioning Guidance 
Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew 
training device providing all pre-launch 
functions as well as realistic aerodynamic 
performance that equate to carrying a tac-
tical missile. The CATM provides pilot train-
ing in aerial target acquisition and use of 
aircraft controls/displays. 
hh. AIM–9X BLK II Special Air Training 
Missile (NATM) is a live flight test and 
training missile, with functioning GU and 
RM, designed for ignition and separation. 
The NATM is similar to the AIM–9X BLK II 
Tactical missile except the WDU–17/B War-
head is replaced with a Telemetry Section 
(TM) for streaming data to a ground station 
during flight and may be fired with or with-
out a target. The telemetry cable is pre-
viously connected between the GU and Tar-
get Detector (TD). An Active Optical Target 
Detector (AOTD) and Telemetry cable is con-
nected between the TD and TM. The Elec-
tronic Safety and Arming Device (ESAD) is 
replaced with an ESAD simulator. 
ii. AIM–9X BLK II Tactical GU, WGU–57/B, 
provides the missile tracking, guidance, and 
control signals. The GU provides counter- 
countermeasures, improved reliability and 
maintainability 
over 
earlier 
Sidewinder 
models. Improvements include: (1) upgrade/ 
redesign to the Electronics Unit Circuit Card 
Assemblies, (2) a redesigned center section 
harnessing, and (3) a larger capacity missile 
battery. 
jj. AIM–9X BLK II CATM GU, WGU–57/B, is 
identical to the tactical GU except the GU 
and Control Actuation System (CAS) bat-
teries are inert and the software Captive. 
The software switch tells the missile proc-
essor that it is attached to a CATM and to 
ignore missile launch commands. The switch 
also signals software to not enter abort mode 
because there is no FAU connected to the 
GU. 
kk. AIM–9X BLK II Multi-Purpose Train-
ing Missile (MPTM) is a ground training de-
vice used to train ground personnel in air-
craft loading, sectionalization, maintenance, 
transportation, storage procedures, and tech-
niques. The missile replicates external ap-
pearance and features of a tactical AIM–9X– 
2 missile. The MPTM will physically inter-
face with loading equipment, maintenance 
equipment, launchers, and test equipment. 
The missile is explosively and electrically 
inert and is NOT flight certified. 
ll. AIM–9X BLK II Dummy Air Training 
Missile (DATM) is used to train ground per-
sonnel in missile maintenance, loading, 
transportation, and storage procedures. All 
components are completely inert. The mis-
sile contains no programmable electrical 
components and is not approved for flight. 
mm. AIM–9X BLK II Active Optical Target 
Detector (AOTD) is newly designed for Block 
II. The AOTD/Data Link (AOTD/DL) uses the 
latest laser technology allowing significant 
increases in sensitivity, aerosol perform-
ance, low altitude performance, and Pk 
(Probability of Kill). The AOTD/DL design 
includes a DL for 2-way platform commu-
nication. The AOTD/DL communicates with 
the GU over a serial interface which allows 
the GU to receive and transmit data so that 
a target position and status communication 
with a launching platform is possible during 
missile flight. 
nn. The GBU–54 Laser Joint Direct Attack 
Munition (LJDAM) is a 500 pound JDAM 
which incorporates all the capabilities of the 
JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision 
laser guidance set. The LJDAM gives the 
weapon system an optional semi-active laser 
guidance in addition to the Inertial Naviga-
tion 
System/Global 
Positioning 
System 
(INS/GPS) guidance. This provides the op-
tional capability to strike moving targets. 
The GBU–54 consists of a laser guidance set, 
KMU–572 warhead specific tail kit, and MK– 
82 bomb body. 
oo. The GBU–53/B Small Diameter Bomb 
Increment II (SDB II) is a 250-lb class preci-
sion-guided, semi-autonomous, conventional, 
air-to-ground munition used to defeat mov-
ing targets through adverse weather from 
standoff range. The SDB II has deployable 
wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance, 
network-enabled 
datalink 
(Link–16 
and 
UHF), and a multi-mode seeker (millimeter 
wave radar, imaging infrared) to autono-
mously search, acquire, track, and defeat 
targets. The SDB II employs a multi-effects 
warhead (Blast, Fragmentation, and Shaped- 
Charge) for maximum lethality against ar-
mored and soft targets. The SDB II weapon 
system consists of the AUR weapon; a 4– 
place common carriage system; and mission 
planning system application. 
pp. SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) is 
an SDB II configuration used for land or sea 
range-based testing of the SDB II weapon 
system. The GTV has common flight charac-
teristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of 
the multi-effects warhead is a Flight Termi-
nation, Tracking, and Telemetry (FTTT) 
subassembly that mirrors the AUR multi-
effects warhead’s size and mass properties, 
but provides safe flight termination, free 
flight tracking and telemetry of encrypted 
data from the GTV to the data receivers. The 
SDB II GTV can have either inert or live 
fuses. All other flight control, guidance, 
data-link, and seeker functions are rep-
resentative of the SDB II AUR. 
qq. SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Test 
(CCRT) vehicles are an SDB II configuration 
primarily used for reliability data collection 
during carriage. The CCRT has common 
characteristics of an SDB II AUR but with 
an inert warhead and fuze. The CCRT has an 
inert mass in place of the warhead that mim-
ics the warhead’s mass properties. The CCRT 
is a flight capable representative of the SDB 
II AUR but is not approved for release from 
any aircraft. Since all other flight control, 
guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are 
representative of the SDB II AUR, this con-
figuration could be used for any purpose 
where an inert round without telemetry or 
termination capability would be useful. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, and services included in this 
potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware or software elements, the informa-
tion could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Switzerland can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA NOWLIN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Laura Nowlin of Teton County for her 
compassion and dedication to her com-
munity. 
Since 1986, Laura has devoted her 
time to working at the Teton County 
Food Pantry as both a volunteer and a 
member of the executive board. Over 
the course of her 33 years at the food 
pantry, she ensured families in the 
community had healthy and hearty 
groceries with no exceptions. Rain or 
shine, Laura was always there to help 
the people of Teton County get the nu-
trition they needed. 
Recently named the board member 
emeritus of the pantry, Laura will be 
dearly missed by her colleagues. Her 
unwavering selflessness was an incred-
ibly valuable asset to both the pantry 
and her community and will continue 
to be in her new capacity. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Laura for her tireless service to the 
people of Teton County. Her kindness 
and charitable approach to work serves 
as an inspiration to all Montanans who 
serve our communities.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MISTY BRITT 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize Misty Britt, an 
ICU nurse at Kings Daughters Medical 
Center 
in 
my 
hometown 
of 
Brookhaven, MS. During the pandemic, 
Misty has truly stepped up to be a lead-
er in the hospital. She manages the 
nurses on her rotation, picks up extra 
shifts; reads, studies, and learns about 
the virus; and has helped streamline 
the workflow to make the environment 
in the hospital more manageable for 
health care workers and patients. 
Misty cares for her patients with 
compassion and empathy. She holds 
their hand when they are afraid, assists 
with family FaceTime calls when fam-
ily isn’t allowed to visit, and forms 
close relationships with each patient 
by offering love and encouragement. 
No matter the circumstance, Misty is 
by her patient’s side helping them fight 
every day for their lives. It is nurses 
like Misty who do the mundane and the 
heroic work with tender loving care 
and are able to provide patients more 
comfort during difficult times. 
For nurses all over our Nation, it is 
overwhelming to witness what COVID 
is doing to their patients. The physical, 
emotional, and mental stress of their 
work continues to mount. Every day, 
they go to work knowing they may 
lose another patient and endure more 
emotional strain. I am grateful for the 
hard work and personal sacrifice Misty 
and other ICU nurses undertake. They 
have my admiration.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LARUE LAMBERT 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize, Larue Lam-
bert, who has worked for Kings Daugh-
ters Medical Center in Brookhaven, 
MS, for over 20 years. Mr. Lambert 
worked as an ICU nurse before moving 
into the house coordinator position, 
where he monitors admissions and dis-
charges, staffing needs, patient census, 
responds to emergencies, and compiles 
detailed reports for the chief nurse. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, Mr. 
Lambert has picked up additional re-
sponsibilities to ensure the hospital is 
functioning smoothly on a daily basis. 
Personal protective equipment was a 
huge concern for all hospitals at the 
beginning of the pandemic. Mr. Lam-
bert closely monitors the hospital’s 
PPE inventory and would distribute it 
to units that were in need. Addition-
ally, he picked up extra shifts when 
staffing levels were low. As a frontline 
healthcare worker, Mr. Lambert self-
lessly puts his life in danger each day 
to care for his fellow Mississippians. 
Larue risks not only his personal 
health, but the health of his close 
friends and family each day while he 
assists in the fight against this pan-
demic. I commend Larue Lambert for

the 
fight 
against COVID–19 for the past several 
months, and I pray that he may be 
granted safety and good health as he 
continues to serve others. He is a hero 
in our Brookhaven community, and I 
am grateful for what he has meant to 
so many during the pandemic.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TAMMY LIVINGSTON 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
would like to commend a friend and 
frontline healthcare worker, Tammy 
Livingston, who is a nurse at Kings 
Daughters Medical Center in my home-
town of Brookhaven, MS. Rural hos-
pitals like this one, along with their 
brave 
staff, 
are 
the 
backbone 
of 
healthcare in Mississippi. 
Tammy has worked at Kings Daugh-
ters Medical Center for over 20 years. 
While she has served in many positions 
within the hospital, she is currently 
the patient care coordinator. In her 
role, she cares for some of the sickest 
patients in the hospital by assisting 
her colleagues with patients in the 
ICU. Within the dedicated medical unit 
for COVID patients at Kings Daugh-
ters, Tammy monitors patients daily, 
making sure they are comfortable and 
cared for at such a difficult time. 
Tammy is invaluable to the Kings 
Daughters Medical Center. Tammy is 
put in situations every day where she 
endures heavy stress, heart-wrenching 
situations, and puts herself in harm’s 
way to care for patients and their fami-
lies during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
She is a lifesaver and best friend to all 
of her patients. Tammy is a healthcare 
hero. I am thankful for our fighters 
like Tammy and pray that she may be 
kept safe while she serves her friends, 
family, and community through this 
pandemic.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINA MILLER 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
commend 
Christina 
Miller, 
a 
healthcare hero and someone who puts 
her life in danger every day to help 
save lives. Christina is an emergency 
room nurse at Kings Daughters Med-
ical Center in Brookhaven, MS. 
Christina demonstrates a remarkable 
selflessness and level of compassion for 
her patients and coworkers. As more 
Americans 
became 
infected 
with 
COVID–19, hospitals began to fill up 
and staffing became a challenge. Chris-
tina immediately stepped up and vol-
unteered to orient on the ICU floor to 
help with staffing needs to help care 
and treat the sickest patients. 
Not only does Christina give the ut-
most care to her patients, she also re-
alizes 
the 
physical 
and 
emotional 
strain all healthcare workers are feel-
ing during these unprecedented times. 
Christina wanted to help encourage her 
colleagues, so she began an employee 
appreciation program among the emer-
gency room nurses. This gave the 
nurses something to look forward to 
when they arrived at work. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, ev-
eryday Americans bravely emerge in 
times of turmoil to aid their neighbors. 
In the case of Christina, she has fought 
on the frontlines as a nurse by stepping 
into harm’s way to provide care for pa-
tients affected by the virus. 
Mississippi 
first 
responders 
and 
healthcare providers have experienced 
a drastic change not only in their pro-
fessional life but also in their home 
life. The COVID–19 pandemic has been 
demanding of their time, taken them 
away from their loved ones, and caused 
their worlds to totally change. These 
heroes, such as Christina, are walking 
examples of what selfless service looks 
like.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JEFFREY ROSS 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Jeffrey Ross of 
Kings Daughters Medical Center in 
Brookhaven. Dr. Ross has both served 
and cared for his community since he 
first started practicing medicine in 
Brookhaven in 1990 and has risen to the 
challenge of COVID–19 with great dis-
tinction. Doctors like Dr. Jeff Ross are 
working through both physical and 
mental exhaustion during this pan-
demic. They have the burden of having 
the 
‘‘final 
say’’ 
and 
a 
team 
of 
healthcare providers relying on their 
instruction daily. The stress presented 
in these situations is not something 
healthcare providers can simply turn 
off when they go off the clock. Despite 
all of this pressure, these doctors con-
tinue to do their job, selflessly man-
aging the care of their fellow Mississip-
pians. 
Originally from Whitfield, MS, Dr. 
Ross earned his medical degree in 
Jackson before pursuing his residency 
in Kentucky. He returned to Mis-
sissippi, where he has dedicated nearly 
all of his adult life to serving his neigh-
bors. Dr. Ross and his wife, Susan, have 
raised 
three 
children 
in 
the 
Brookhaven community. 
I commend Dr. Jeffrey Ross for his 
personal sacrifice, dedication to his 
community, and his leadership. My 
State is fortunate to have doctors such 
as him who are focused on the health 
and wellness of all Mississippians.∑

ON 
CRITICAL MINERALS, IN PROC-

PM 59 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), 
and section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, I hereby report that I have issued 
an Executive Order declaring a na-
tional emergency to deal with the 
threat posed by our Nation’s undue re-
liance on critical minerals, in proc-
essed or unprocessed form, from foreign 
adversaries. 
A strong America cannot be depend-
ent on imports from foreign adver-
saries for the critical minerals that are 
increasingly necessary to maintain our 
economic and military strength in the 
21st century. Because of the national 
importance of reliable access to crit-
ical minerals, I signed Executive Order 
13817 of December 20, 2017 (A Federal 
Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reli-
able Supplies of Critical Minerals), 
which required the Secretary of the In-
terior to identify critical minerals and 
made it the policy of the Federal Gov-
ernment ‘‘to reduce the Nation’s vul-
nerability to disruptions in the supply 
of critical minerals.’’ The critical min-
erals identified by the Secretary of the 
Interior are necessary inputs for the 
products our military, national infra-
structure, and economy depend on the 
most. Our country needs critical min-
erals to make airplanes, computers, 
cell phones, electricity generation and 
transmission systems, and advanced 
electronics. 
Though these minerals are indispen-
sable to our country, we presently lack 
the capacity to produce them in proc-
essed form in the quantities we need. 
American producers depend on foreign 
countries to supply and process them. 
Whereas the United States recognizes 
the continued importance of coopera-
tion on supply chain issues with inter-
national partners and allies, in many 
cases, the aggressive economic prac-
tices of certain non-market foreign 
producers of critical minerals have de-
stroyed vital mining and manufac-
turing jobs in the United States. We 
must reduce our vulnerability to ad-
verse foreign government action, nat-
ural disaster, or other supply disrup-
tions. Our national security, foreign

policy, and economy require a con-
sistent supply of each of these min-
erals. 
Using the authority vested in me by 
IEEPA, the Executive Order requires 
the Secretary of the Interior, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of Commerce, and the heads 
of other executive departments and 
agencies, as appropriate, to investigate 
our Nation’s undue reliance on critical 
minerals, in processed or unprocessed 
form, from foreign adversaries. Fol-
lowing this investigation, the Execu-
tive Order requires the Secretary of the 
Interior to submit a report to the 
President recommending additional ex-
ecutive action. 
The Executive Order also declares 
that it is the policy of the United 
States to protect and expand the do-
mestic supply chain for minerals. Spe-
cific executive department and agency 
heads, including the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Energy, 
are directed to take various actions to 
protect and expand the domestic sup-
ply chain for minerals, consistent with 
applicable law, such as the publication 
of guidance, the revision of regula-
tions, and the acceleration of the 
issuance of permits. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

Required 
to 
Kickstart the Economy Act’’ or the ‘‘SAFE 
TO WORK Act’’. 
SEC. 2002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The SARS–CoV–2 virus that originated 
in China and causes the disease COVID–19 
has caused untold misery and devastation 
throughout the world, including in the 
United States. 
(2) For months, frontline health care work-
ers and health care facilities have fought the 
virus with courage and resolve. They did so 
at first with very little information about 
how to treat the virus and developed strate-
gies to save lives of the people of the United 
States in real time. They risked their per-
sonal health and wellbeing to protect and 
treat their patients. 
(3) Businesses in the United States kicked 
into action to produce and procure personal 
protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, 
face shields, and hand sanitizer, and other 
necessary medical supplies, such as ventila-
tors, at unprecedented rates. 
(4) To halt the spread of the disease, State 
and local governments took drastic meas-
ures. They shut down small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies. 
They ordered people to remain in their 
homes. 
(5) This standstill was needed to slow the 
spread of the virus. But it devastated the 
economy of the United States. The sum of 
hundreds of local-level and State-level deci-
sions to close nearly every space in which 
people might gather brought interstate com-
merce nearly to a halt. 
(6) This halt led to the loss of millions of 
jobs. These lost jobs were not a natural con-
sequence of the economic environment, but 
rather the result of a drastic, though tem-
porary, response to the unprecedented na-
ture of this global pandemic. 
(7) Congress passed a series of statutes to 
address the health care and economic cri-
ses—the Coronavirus Preparedness and Re-
sponse Supplemental Appropriations Act, 
2020 (Public Law 116–123; 134 Stat. 146), the 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act 
(Public Law 116–127; 134 Stat. 178), the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act or the CARES Act (Public Law 116– 
136), and the Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act (Public 
Law 116–139; 134 Stat. 620). In these laws Con-
gress exercised its power under the Com-
merce and Spending Clauses of the Constitu-
tion of the United States to direct trillions 
of taxpayer dollars toward efforts to aid 
workers, businesses, State and local govern-
ments, health care workers, and patients. 
(8) This legislation provided short-term in-
sulation from the worst of the economic 
storm, but these laws alone cannot protect 
the United States from further devastation. 
Only reopening the economy so that workers 
can get back to work and students can get 
back to school can accomplish that goal. 
(9) The Constitution of the United States 
specifically enumerates the legislative pow-
ers of Congress. One of those powers is the 
regulation of interstate commerce. The Gov-
ernment is not a substitute for the economy, 
but it has the authority and the duty to act 
when interstate commerce is threatened and 
damaged. As applied to the present crisis, 
Congress can deploy its power over inter-
state commerce to promote a prudent re-
opening of businesses and other organiza-
tions that serve as the foundation and back-
bone of the national economy and of com-
merce among the States. These include 
small and large businesses, schools (which 
are substantial employers in their own right 
and provide necessary services to enable par-
ents and other caregivers to return to work), 
colleges and universities (which are substan-
tial employers and supply the interstate 
market for higher-education services), reli-
gious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions (which are substantial employers 
and provide necessary services to their com-
munities), and local government agencies. 
(10) Congress must also ensure that the Na-
tion’s health care workers and health care 
facilities are able to act fully to defeat the 
virus. 
(11) Congress must also safeguard its in-
vestment of taxpayer dollars under the 
CARES Act and other coronavirus legisla-
tion. Congress must ensure that those funds 
are used to help businesses and workers sur-
vive and recover from the economic crisis, 
and to help health care workers and health 
care facilities defeat the virus. CARES Act 
funds cannot be diverted from these impor-
tant purposes to line the pockets of the trial 
bar. 
(12) One of the chief impediments to the 
continued flow of interstate commerce as 
this public-health crisis has unfolded is the 
risk of litigation. Small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies 
confront the risk of a tidal wave of lawsuits 
accusing them of exposing employees, cus-
tomers, 
students, 
and 
worshipers 
to 
coronavirus. Health care workers face the 
threat of lawsuits arising from their efforts 
to fight the virus. 
(13) They confront this litigation risk even 
as they work tirelessly to comply with the 
coronavirus guidance, rules, and regulations

September 30, 2020 
issued by local governments, State govern-
ments, and the Federal Government. They 
confront this risk notwithstanding equip-
ment and staffing shortages. And they con-
front this risk while also grappling with con-
stantly changing information on how best to 
protect employees, customers, students, and 
worshipers from the virus, and how best to 
treat it. 
(14) These lawsuits pose a substantial risk 
to interstate commerce because they threat-
en to keep small and large businesses, 
schools, colleges and universities, religious, 
philanthropic and other nonprofit institu-
tions, and local government agencies from 
reopening for fear of expensive litigation 
that might prove to be meritless. These law-
suits further threaten to undermine the Na-
tion’s fight against the virus by exposing our 
health care workers and health care facili-
ties to liability for difficult medical deci-
sions they have made under trying and un-
certain circumstances. 
(15) These lawsuits also risk diverting tax-
payer money provided under the CARES Act 
and other coronavirus legislation from its in-
tended purposes to the pockets of opportun-
istic trial lawyers. 
(16) This risk is not purely local. It is nec-
essarily national in scale. A patchwork of 
local and State rules governing liability in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits creates tremen-
dous unpredictability for everyone partici-
pating in interstate commerce and acts as a 
significant drag on national recovery. The 
aggregation of each individual potential li-
ability risk poses a substantial and unprece-
dented threat to interstate commerce. 
(17) The accumulated economic risks for 
these potential defendants directly and sub-
stantially affects interstate commerce. Indi-
viduals and entities potentially subject to 
coronavirus-related liability will structure 
their decisionmaking to avoid that liability. 
Small and large businesses, schools, colleges 
and universities, religious, philanthropic and 
other nonprofit institutions, and local gov-
ernment agencies may decline to reopen be-
cause of the risk of litigation. They may 
limit their output or engagement with cus-
tomers and communities to avoid the risk of 
litigation. These individual economic deci-
sions substantially affect interstate com-
merce because, as a whole, they will prevent 
the free and fair exchange of goods and serv-
ices across State lines. Such economic activ-
ity that, individually and in the aggregate, 
substantially affects interstate commerce is 
precisely the sort of conduct that should be 
subject to congressional regulation. 
(18) Lawsuits against health care workers 
and facilities pose a similarly dangerous risk 
to interstate commerce. Interstate com-
merce will not truly rebound from this crisis 
until the virus is defeated, and that will not 
happen unless health care workers and facili-
ties are free to combat vigorously the virus 
and treat patients with coronavirus and 
those otherwise impacted by the response to 
coronavirus. 
(19) Subjecting health care workers and fa-
cilities to onerous litigation even as they 
have done their level best to combat a virus 
about which very little was known when it 
arrived in the United States would divert im-
portant health care resources from hospitals 
and providers to courtrooms. 
(20) Such a diversion would substantially 
affect interstate commerce by degrading the 
national capacity for combating the virus 
and saving patients, thereby substantially 
elongating the period before interstate com-
merce could fully re-engage. 
(21) Congress also has the authority to de-
termine the jurisdiction of the courts of the 
United States, to set the standards for 
causes of action they can hear, and to estab-
lish the rules by which those causes of action 
should proceed. Congress therefore must act 
to 
set 
rules 
governing 
liability 
in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits. 
(22) These rules necessarily must be tem-
porary and carefully tailored to the inter-
state crisis caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic. They must extend no further than 
necessary to meet this uniquely national cri-
sis for which a patchwork of State and local 
tort laws are ill-suited. 
(23) Because of the national scope of the 
economic and health care dangers posed by 
the risks of coronavirus-related lawsuits, es-
tablishing temporary rules governing liabil-
ity 
for 
certain 
coronavirus-related 
tort 
claims is a necessary and proper means of 
carrying into execution Congress’s power to 
regulate 
commerce 
among 
the 
several 
States. 
(24) Because Congress must safeguard the 
investment of taxpayer dollars it made in 
the CARES Act and other coronavirus legis-
lation, and ensure that they are used for 
their intended purposes and not diverted for 
other purposes, establishing temporary rules 
governing liability for certain coronavirus- 
related tort claims is a necessary and proper 
means of carrying into execution Congress’s 
power to provide for the general welfare of 
the United States. 
(b) PURPOSES.—Pursuant to the powers del-
egated to Congress by article I, section 8, 
clauses 1, 3, 9, and 18, and article III, section 
2, clause 1 of the Constitution of the United 
States, the purposes of this title are to— 
(1) establish necessary and consistent 
standards for litigating certain claims spe-
cific to the unique coronavirus pandemic; 
(2) prevent the overburdening of the court 
systems with undue litigation; 
(3) encourage planning, care, and appro-
priate risk management by small and large 
businesses, schools, colleges and univer-
sities, religious, philanthropic and other 
nonprofit 
institutions, 
local 
government 
agencies, and health care providers; 
(4) ensure that the Nation’s recovery from 
the coronavirus economic crisis is not bur-
dened or slowed by the substantial risk of 
litigation; 
(5) prevent litigation brought to extract 
settlements and enrich trial lawyers rather 
than vindicate meritorious claims; 
(6) protect interstate commerce from the 
burdens of potentially meritless litigation; 
(7) ensure the economic recovery proceeds 
without artificial and unnecessary delay; 
(8) protect the interests of the taxpayers 
by ensuring that emergency taxpayer sup-
port continues to aid businesses, workers, 
and health care providers rather than enrich 
trial lawyers; and 
(9) protect the highest and best ideals of 
the national economy, so businesses can 
produce and serve their customers, workers 
can work, teachers can teach, students can 
learn, and believers can worship.

SEC. 2122. LIABILITY; SAFE HARBOR. 
(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR LIABILITY FOR EXPO-
SURE TO CORONAVIRUS.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, and except as other-
wise provided in this section, no individual 
or entity engaged in businesses, services, ac-
tivities, or accommodations shall be liable in 
any coronavirus exposure action unless the 
plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing 
evidence that— 
(1) in engaging in the businesses, services, 
activities, or accommodations, the indi-
vidual or entity was not making reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance in effect at the time 
of the actual, alleged, feared, or potential for 
exposure to coronavirus; 
(2) the individual or entity engaged in 
gross negligence or willful misconduct that 
caused an actual exposure to coronavirus; 
and 
(3) the actual exposure to coronavirus 
caused the personal injury of the plaintiff. 
(b) REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLY.— 
(1) CONFLICTING
APPLICABLE
GOVERNMENT 
STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—If more than 1 govern-
ment to whose jurisdiction an individual or 
entity is subject issues applicable govern-
ment standards and guidance, and the appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by 1 or more of the governments con-
flicts with the applicable government stand-
ards and guidance issued by 1 or more of the 
other governments, the individual or entity 
shall be considered to have made reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) unless the plaintiff establishes 
by clear and convincing evidence that the in-
dividual or entity was not making reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with any of the conflicting appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by any government to whose jurisdic-
tion the individual or entity is subject. 
(B) EXCEPTION.—If mandatory standards 
and regulations constituting applicable gov-
ernment standards and guidance issued by 
any government with jurisdiction over the 
individual or entity conflict with applicable 
government standards and guidance that are 
not mandatory and are issued by any other 
government with jurisdiction over the indi-
vidual or entity or by the same government 
that issued the mandatory standards and 
regulations, the plaintiff may establish that 
the individual or entity did not make reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) by establishing by clear and 
convincing evidence that the individual or 
entity was not making reasonable efforts in 
light of all the circumstances to comply with 
the mandatory standards and regulations to 
which the individual or entity was subject. 
(2) WRITTEN OR PUBLISHED POLICY.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If an individual or entity 
engaged in businesses, services, activities, or 
accommodations maintained a written or 
published policy on the mitigation of trans-
mission of coronavirus at the time of the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus that complied with, or 
was more protective than, the applicable 
government standards and guidance to which 
the individual or entity was subject, the in-
dividual or entity shall be presumed to have 
made reasonable efforts in light of all the 
circumstances to comply with the applicable 
government standards and guidance for pur-
poses of subsection (a)(1). 
(B) REBUTTAL.—The plaintiff may rebut 
the presumption under subparagraph (A) by 
establishing that the individual or entity 
was not complying with the written or pub-
lished policy at the time of the actual, al-
leged, feared, or potential for exposure to 
coronavirus. 
(C) ABSENCE
OF
A
WRITTEN
OR
PUBLISHED 
POLICY.—The absence of a written or pub-
lished policy shall not give rise to a pre-
sumption that the individual or entity did 
not make reasonable efforts in light of all 
the circumstances to comply with the appli-
cable government standards and guidance for 
purposes of subsection (a)(1). 
(3) TIMING.—For purposes of subsection 
(a)(1), a change to a policy or practice by an 
individual or entity before or after the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus, shall not be evidence of 
liability for the actual, alleged, feared, or 
potential for exposure to coronavirus. 
(c) THIRD PARTIES.—No individual or entity 
shall be held liable in a coronavirus exposure 
action for the acts or omissions of a third 
party, unless— 
(1) the individual or entity had an obliga-
tion under general common law principles to 
control the acts or omissions of the third 
party; or 
(2) the third party was an agent of the indi-
vidual or entity. 
(d) MITIGATION.—Changes to the policies, 
practices, or procedures of an individual or 
entity for complying with the applicable 
government standards and guidance after the 
time of the actual, alleged, feared, or poten-
tial for exposure to coronavirus, shall not be 
considered evidence of liability or culpa-
bility.

be applied in addition to the requirements of 
this part and not in lieu thereof.

SEC. 2162. LIMITATIONS ON SUITS. 
(a) JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY LIMITA-
TIONS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—An individual or entity 
against whom a final judgment is entered in 
any coronavirus-related action shall be lia-
ble solely for the portion of the judgment 
that corresponds to the relative and propor-
tionate responsibility of that individual or 
entity. In determining the percentage of re-
sponsibility of any defendant, the trier of 
fact shall determine that percentage as a 
percentage of the total fault of all individ-
uals or entities, including the plaintiff, who 
caused or contributed to the total loss in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(2) PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.— 
(A) DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY.—In 
any coronavirus-related action, the court 
shall instruct the jury to answer special in-
terrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the 
court shall make findings with respect to 
each defendant, including defendants who 
have entered into settlements with the 
plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning the per-
centage of responsibility, if any, of each de-
fendant, measured as a percentage of the 
total fault of all individuals or entities who 
caused or contributed to the loss incurred by 
the plaintiff. 
(B) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In deter-
mining the percentage of responsibility 
under this subsection, the trier of fact shall 
consider— 
(i) the nature of the conduct of each indi-
vidual or entity found to have caused or con-
tributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; 
and 
(ii) the nature and extent of the causal re-
lationship between the conduct of each such 
individual or entity and the damages in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(3) JOINT LIABILITY FOR SPECIFIC INTENT OR 
FRAUD.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in 
any coronavirus-related action the liability 
of a defendant is joint and several if the trier 
of fact specifically determines that the de-
fendant— 
(A) acted with specific intent to injure the 
plaintiff; or 
(B) knowingly committed fraud. 
(4) RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION NOT AFFECTED.— 
Nothing in this subsection affects the right, 
under any other law, of a defendant to con-
tribution with respect to another defendant 
determined under paragraph (3) to have 
acted with specific intent to injure the plain-
tiff or to have knowingly committed fraud. 
(b) 
LIMITATIONS
ON
DAMAGES.—In 
any 
coronavirus-related action— 
(1) the award of compensatory damages 
shall be limited to economic losses incurred 
as the result of the personal injury, harm, 
damage, breach, or tort, except that the 
court may award damages for noneconomic 
losses if the trier of fact determines that the 
personal injury, harm, damage, breach, or 
tort was caused by the willful misconduct of 
the individual or entity; 
(2) punitive damages— 
(A) may be awarded only if the trier of fact 
determines that the personal injury to the 
plaintiff was caused by the willful mis-
conduct of the individual or entity; and 
(B) may not exceed the amount of compen-
satory damages awarded; and 
(3) the amount of monetary damages 
awarded to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the 
amount of compensation received by the 
plaintiff from another source in connection 
with the personal injury, harm, damage, 
breach, or tort, such as insurance or reim-
bursement by a government. 
(c) PREEMPTION AND SUPERSEDURE.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as described in 
paragraphs (2) and (3), this section preempts 
and supersedes any Federal, State, or Tribal 
law, including statutes, regulations, rules, 
orders, proclamations, or standards that are 
enacted, promulgated, or established under 
common law, related to joint and several li-
ability, proportionate or contributory liabil-
ity, contribution, or the award of damages 
for any coronavirus-related action. 
(2) STRICTER LAWS NOT PREEMPTED OR SU-
PERSEDED.—Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of any 
provision of any Federal, State, or Tribal 
law that— 
(A) limits the liability of a defendant in a 
coronavirus-related action to a lesser degree 
of liability than the degree of liability deter-
mined under this section; 
(B) otherwise affords a greater degree of 
protection from joint or several liability 
than is afforded by this section; or 
(C) limits the damages that can be recov-
ered from a defendant in a coronavirus-re-
lated action to a lesser amount of damages 
than the amount determined under this sec-
tion. 
(3) PUBLIC READINESS AND EMERGENCY PRE-
PAREDNESS.—Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of sec-
tion 319F–3 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d–6d) to any act or omission in-
volving a covered countermeasure, as defined 
in subsection (i) of such section in arranging 
for or providing coronavirus-related health 
care services. Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of sec-
tion 319F–4 of the Public Health Service Act

ing such a demand shall have a cause of ac-
tion for the recovery of damages occasioned

ment in accordance with chapter 151 of title 
28, United States Code, if the claim for which

mands for remuneration in exchange for set-
tling, releasing, waiving, or otherwise not 
pursuing a claim that is, or could be, 
brought as part of a coronavirus-related ac-
tion and that is meritless, the Attorney Gen-
eral may commence a civil action in any ap-
propriate district court of the United States. 
(2) RELIEF.—In a civil action under para-
graph (1), the court may, to vindicate the

prevent, 
prepare 
for, 
and 
respond 
to

(A) 90 percent according to the relative

and 
(B) 10 percent according to the relative 
share of full-time equivalent enrollment of

(2) 10 percent for additional awards under 
parts A and B of title III, parts A and B of 
title V, and subpart 4 of part A of title VII 
of the Higher Education Act to address needs 
directly related to coronavirus, that shall be 
in addition to awards made in section 
104(a)(1) of this title, and allocated by the 
Secretary proportionally to such programs 
based on the relative share of funding appro-
priated to such programs in the Further Con-

lent to the total number of students enrolled 
at such institution at the end of the school 
year preceding the beginning of that fiscal 
year and the number of students enrolled at 
all such institutions; and

defray 
expenses

technology costs associated with a transi-
tion to distance education, faculty and staff 
trainings, and payroll); and

(including students exclusively enrolled in 
distance education), which may be used for 
any component of the student’s cost of at-
tendance or for emergency costs that arise 
due to coronavirus.

was required to remit payment to the Inter-
nal Revenue Service for the excise tax based 
on investment income of private colleges and 
universities under section 4968 of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 for tax year 2019

reduced by 50 percent and may only use 
funds for activities described in paragraph 
(c)(2). This paragraph shall not apply to an 
institution of higher education designated by 
the Secretary as an eligible institution 
under section 448 of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965. 
(e)

By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BROWN, 
Mrs. 
MURRAY, 
Mr. 
SANDERS, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr. 
SCHATZ, Mr. CARDIN, and Ms. 
WARREN): 
S. 4777. A bill to restore leave lost by 
Federal employees during certain pub-
lic health emergencies, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today I 
rise to introduce a bill that provides 
fairness to our Federal employees who 
work day in and day out to help the 
government function and serve the 
public. The importance of their role 
has become even more apparent as our 
Nation continues to suffer in the midst 
of a global pandemic. 
In a normal year, the average Fed-
eral employee can accumulate up to 240 
hours, or 30 days, of annual leave. At 
the end of the year, if a Federal em-
ployee has more than 240 hours, they 
either have to use the amount of leave 
over 240 hours or lose it. These excess 
hours are commonly known as ‘‘use or 
lose’’ leave. 
But these are not normal times. We 
are in the middle of a global pandemic 
and we have a President who lies about 
how dangerous this virus is and does 
little to address the severity of it. We 
see the results, nearly seven million 
people in the United States have con-
tracted COVID–19 and more than 200,000 
have died. The United States now has 
the unenviable distinction of being the 
Nation with the most COVID–19 cases 
and the most deaths.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5981 
September 30, 2020 
Through all of this, people continue 
to go to work and try to carry out 
their duties the best they can. In the 
Federal Government, there are Na-
tional Institutes of Health researchers, 
Internal Revenue Service workers, So-
cial Security staff, law enforcement of-
ficers, and others, working each day to 
provide government services to the 
American public. Some are not able to 
take leave because their job is a crit-
ical part of the response to the pan-
demic. Others are simply unable to 
take leave because they are limiting 
their exposure to the virus or are fol-
lowing state and local rules to prevent 
the spread of COVID–19. 
To try and address this issue, on Au-
gust 10, the Office of Personnel Man-
agement published an interim rule that 
recognizes the COVID–19 pandemic as 
an ‘‘exigency of the public business’’ 
and allows some federal employees to 
carry over use or lose leave. However, 
this policy is limited to employees who 
are designated as essential by their 
agency. 
This contrasts with the Department 
of Defense which issued a memo on 
April 16, allowing all active-duty serv-
ice members to accrue leave in excess 
of their 60-day limitation, regardless of 
job responsibilities or duty station. All 
Federal employees contribute to their 
agency’s mission, regardless of the job 
they hold. No one should lose earned 
annual leave due to this pandemic. 
To resolve this inequity, I am intro-
ducing the Federal Worker Leave Fair-
ness Act which will allow all Federal 
employees to carry over annual leave 
above the 240 hour cap, regardless of 
whether they are considered essential. 
My bill also resolves this issue for fu-
ture pandemics declared a national 
public health emergency by allowing 
‘‘use or lose’’ leave to be rolled over 
during the emergency declaration. 
This legislation is being introduced 
in the House by Representatives DEREK 
KILMER and JENNIFER WEXTON and is 
supported by the National Treasury 
Employees Union; American Federa-
tion of Government Employees; Fed-
eral Law Enforcement Officers Associa-
tion; International Federation of Pro-
fessional and Technical Engineers; Na-
tional Federation of Federal Employ-
ees; Federal Managers Association; 
FAA Managers Association; National 
Active and Retired Federal Employees 
Association; and the American Federa-
tion of State, County and Municipal 
Employees. 
This bill is a small act of fairness in 
an 
otherwise 
stressful 
and 
over-
whelming year. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill in recognition of our 
hardworking federal workforce. 
I yield the floor. 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 727—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
2020 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
OVARIAN 
CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. PETERS, 
Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and 
Mrs. CAPITO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 727 
Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading 
cause of cancer deaths in women in the 
United States and accounts for more deaths 
than any other cancer of the female repro-
ductive system; 
Whereas, in the United States, a woman’s 
lifetime risk of being diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer is about 1 in 78; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates 21,750 new cases of ovarian cancer will 
be diagnosed in 2020 and 13,940 people will die 
from the disease nationwide; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for ovar-
ian cancer is 46.5 percent, and survival rates 
vary greatly depending on the stage of diag-
nosis; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for ovar-
ian cancer is over 90 percent for women diag-
nosed in early stages; 
Whereas, while the mammogram can de-
tect breast cancer and the Pap smear can de-
tect cervical cancer, there is no reliable 
early detection test for ovarian cancer; 
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national 
consensus 
statement 
on 
ovarian 
cancer 
symptoms was developed to provide consist-
ency in describing symptoms and make it 
easier for women to learn and remember 
those symptoms; 
Whereas too many people remain unaware 
that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often 
include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, 
difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, uri-
nary symptoms, and several other vague 
symptoms that are often easily confused 
with other diseases; 
Whereas improved awareness of the symp-
toms of ovarian cancer by the public and 
health care providers can lead to a quicker 
diagnosis; 
Whereas the lack of an early detection test 
for ovarian cancer, combined with its vague 
symptoms, mean that approximately 80 per-
cent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected 
at an advanced stage; 
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian 
cancer, but approximately 20 percent of 
women who are diagnosed with ovarian can-
cer have a hereditary predisposition to ovar-
ian cancer, which places them at even higher 
risk; 
Whereas scientists and physicians have un-
covered changes in the BRCA genes that 
some women inherit from their parents, 
which may make those women 30 times more 
likely to develop ovarian cancer; 
Whereas the family history of a woman has 
been found to play an important role in ac-
curately assessing a woman’s risk of devel-
oping ovarian cancer, and medical experts 
believe that family history should be taken 
into consideration during the annual well- 
woman visit of any woman; 
Whereas women who know that they are at 
high risk of ovarian cancer may undertake 
prophylactic measures to help reduce the 
risk of developing this disease; 
Whereas guidelines issued by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and 
the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 
recommend that all individuals diagnosed 
with ovarian cancer receive genetic coun-
seling and genetic testing regardless of their 
family history; 
Whereas studies consistently show that 
compliance with such guidelines is alarm-
ingly low, with recently published National 
Cancer 
Institute-funded 
research 
finding 
that in 2013 and 2014, only 1⁄3 of ovarian can-
cer survivors had undergone such testing; 
Whereas, according to a 2016 consensus re-
port by the National Academy of Medicine, 
‘‘there remain surprising gaps in the funda-
mental knowledge about and understanding 
of ovarian cancer’’ across all aspects of the 
disease; 
Whereas ongoing investments in ovarian 
cancer research and education and awareness 
efforts are critical to closing these gaps and 
improving survivorship for women with ovar-
ian cancer; 
Whereas, each year during the month of 
September, the Ovarian Cancer Research Al-
liance (OCRA) and its community partners 
hold a number of events to increase public 
awareness of ovarian cancer and its symp-
toms; and 
Whereas September 2020 should be des-
ignated as ‘‘National Ovarian Cancer Aware-
ness Month’’ to increase public awareness of 
ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’; and 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.

750,000,000 people are facing severe food inse-
curity, and 10,000,000 more people having fall-
en into hunger between 2018 and 2019, 
144,000,000 children stunted, and 47,000,0000 
children experiencing wasting; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has ex-
posed vulnerabilities in global food systems 
and food supply chains, and has severely ex-
acerbated existing food security shocks, such 
as the Fall Army Worm and desert locust in-
festations in the Horn of Africa region, par-
ticularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, 
as well as parts of Asia and the Middle East, 
which already represented an unprecedented 
threat to global food security and liveli-
hoods; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and its 
second-order impacts are expected to dra-
matically worsen the state of global food se-
curity and nutrition, with preliminary as-
sessments predicting a doubling of severe 
hunger (from 135,000,000 to 265,000,000 people) 
and an increase in child wasting (from 
47,000,000 to 52,000,000) by the end of 2020; 
Whereas the United States has been a glob-
al leader in addressing food insecurity on a 
bipartisan basis and across Administrations, 
particularly in response to the global food 
price crisis in 2007–2008 and subsequent 
launch of the whole-of-government, United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment-led, Feed the Future program in 2010; 
Whereas the late Senator Richard Lugar of 
Indiana 
was 
instrumental 
in 
advancing 
United States efforts to reduce global pov-
erty through smart investments in agri-
culture and food security, including through 
his stewardship of the Global Food Security 
Acts of 2008 and 2009, support for the launch 
of the Feed the Future program in 2010, and 
continued advocacy to formally authorize 
the Feed the Future program through enact-
ment of the Global Food Security Act of 2016 
(Public Law 114–195) and the Global Food Se-
curity Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public 
Law 115–266); 
Whereas the Global Food Security Act of 
2016 (Public Law 114–195), as enacted in 2016 
and reauthorized in 2018, required the devel-
opment and implementation of a comprehen-
sive United States Government Global Food 
Security Strategy and codified the Feed the 
Future framework, strengthening its ac-
countability and transparency mechanisms, 
deepening interagency engagement, and en-
gaging a broad coalition of stakeholders, in-
cluding faith-based and civil society organi-
zations, universities and research institu-
tions, the United States private sector, and 
United States farm and commodity organiza-
tions; 
Whereas Feed the Future investments have 
helped transform countries’ food systems 
and improve their own food security and nu-
trition, with investments currently focused 
in twelve target countries and 35 aligned 
countries and regions in Asia, Central Amer-
ica, and east, southern, and west Africa; 
Whereas according to its most recent 
progress report, Feed the Future has helped 
more than 23,400,000 people lift themselves 
out of poverty, prevented 3,400,000 children 
from 
being 
stunted, 
and 
ensured 
that 
5,200,000 families no longer suffer from hun-
ger in areas where the program operates; 
Whereas Feed the Future is making signifi-
cant progress towards building local capac-
ity and resilience by promoting inclusive 
economic growth, strengthening monitoring 
and evaluation, implementing sustainable 
agricultural practices, risk management, im-
proving forecasting and adaptation, and 
building the agricultural capacity of rural 
communities; 
Whereas Feed the Future also is advancing 
women’s economic empowerment by pro-
viding 
targeted 
technical 
assistance 
to 
women working in agricultural systems and 
equipping women with adequate tools, train-
ing, and technology for small-scale agri-
culture; 
Whereas Feed the Future investments ben-
efit communities in the United States as 
well, including by increasing United States 
trade and agricultural exports to Feed the 
Future countries by more than $1,400,000,000 
since inception; and 
Whereas Feed the Future investments in 
international agricultural research and de-
velopment through partnerships with United 
States universities and land-grant institu-
tions, international research systems, such 
as the Consortium of International Agricul-
tural Research Centers, and other organiza-
tions will help the United States agricul-

contexts; 
(B) include information on all countries 
benefitting from direct Feed the Future in-
vestments, to include both focus and aligned 
countries, in annual reporting in order to 
further enhance the program’s commitment 
to transparency and impact; 
(C) develop a robust multi-sectoral learn-

under the Global Food Security Strategy, 
and align relevant programs with the Feed

Whereas December 14, 2020, marks the 25th 
anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords 
that 
ended 
the 
war 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina and brought peace to Bosnia 
and Herzegovina; 
Whereas ethnic cleansing and concentra-
tion camps were used as a tool of war against 
Bosnian Muslim men, women, and children, 
culminating in the July 1995 genocide at 
Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslim men and 
teenagers were detained and killed; 
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation (NATO) and the United States initi-
ated airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs to stop 
grave human rights abuses, which led to 
ceasefire negotiations and the peace accords; 
Whereas negotiations began on November 
1, 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, at Wright-Patterson 
Air Force Base, led by then-negotiator Rich-
ard Holbrooke and then-Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, with Chairman of the 
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija

bia Slobodan Milosˇevic´, President of the Re-
public of Croatia Franjo Tudjman, European 
Union Special Representative Carl Bildt, 
First Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Igor 
Ivanov, and representatives from the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy; 
Whereas, after days of extensive discus-
sions, a historic peace agreement was signed 
on December 14, 1995, to halt the conflict and 
bring peace to the region; 
Whereas, despite seemingly insurmount-
able differences in opinions, the negotiations 
succeeded due to dedicated foreign service 
professionals, a common yearning for a 
peaceful resolution, and an outpouring of 
support from the global community; 
Whereas the General Framework Agree-
ment for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
also known as the Dayton Peace Accords, 
laid the groundwork for NATO and European 
Union (EU) stabilization missions over the

Whereas, since the signing of the Dayton 
Peace Accords, the Government and people 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been work-
ing in partnership with the international 
community towards building a peaceful and 
democratic society based on the rule of law, 
respect for human rights, and a free-market 
economy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns human rights abuses that 
took place during the conflict in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and reconfirms the joint United 
States and EU commitment to promote and 
protect human rights, democracy, and the 
rule of law worldwide; 
(2) commends the commitment of the Gov-
ernment 
and 
people 
of 
Bosnia

Herzegovina to peace and cooperation 25 
years after the Dayton Peace Accords; 
(3) encourages the Government of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to continue pursuing NATO

(4) encourages the Government of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to continue its progress to-
wards solving its constitutional issues and 
improving its economic policy as it advances 
towards NATO and EU memberships; 
(5) reiterates the importance of the Dayton 
Peace Accords as the basis of constitutional 
reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 
promotion of political, economic, legal, and 
religious equality through the goals and val-
ues laid out by the EU; 
(6) urges the Government of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to pursue constitutional re-
forms, needed to reconcile the past to seek

(7) urges the United States Government to 
work closely with the governments of the

that 
border 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina—especially those who are sig-
natories of the Dayton Peace Accords—to 
support full implementation of the Stabiliza-

the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 733 
Whereas 
the 
Preservation 
Society 
of 
Charleston, founded in 1920, is the oldest cit-
izen-based preservation organization in the 
United States; 
Whereas 
the 
Preservation 
Society 
of 
Charleston played a critical role in posi-
tioning the historic and beautiful city of 
Charleston, South Carolina, as a leader in 
the protection of architectural resources and 
vibrant communities by spearheading the ef-
fort to pass the first historic district zoning 
ordinance in the United States in 1931, which 
is now known worldwide as the ‘‘Charleston 
Ordinance’’; 
Whereas 
the 
Preservation 
Society 
of 
Charleston has a lengthy record of successes 
in saving iconic buildings and neighborhoods 
throughout the city of Charleston, includ-
ing— 
(1) the Dock Street Theater; 
(2) the Lining House; 
(3) the Old Exchange Building; 
(4) Rainbow Row; and 
(5) countless other historic buildings on 
the peninsula of Charleston; 
Whereas

Pringle Frost, whose vision, determination, 
and energy set the preservation movement 
on a new path in the early 20th century; 
Whereas, for 100 years, the Preservation

Mr. SCOTT
of South Carolina, Mr. 
CASEY, Ms. MCSALLY, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. HAWLEY, Ms. WARREN, Mr. BRAUN, 
and Ms. SINEMA) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 734 
Whereas individuals who are 65 years of 
age or older (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘older adults’’) are the fastest growing seg-
ment of the population in the United States, 
and the number of older adults in the United 
States will increase from approximately 
56,100,000 in 2020 to an estimated 73,100,000 by 
2030; 
Whereas approximately 30 percent of older 
adults in the United States fall each year, 
with each 10-year increment in age increas-
ing the risk of falls; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both 
fatal and nonfatal injuries among older 
adults; 
Whereas, in 2018, older adults reported 
35,600,000 falls, with approximately 8,400,000 
of those falls resulting in an injury that lim-
ited regular activities or resulted in a med-
ical visit; 
Whereas, in 2018, approximately 3,000,000 
older adults were treated in hospital emer-
gency departments for fall-related injuries, 
and more than 950,000 of those older adults 
were subsequently hospitalized; 
Whereas, in 2018, more than 32,000 older 
adults died from injuries related to uninten-
tional falls, and the death rate from falls of 
older adults in the United States is expected 
to continue to sharply rise to more than 
100,000 per year by 2030; 
Whereas, in 2015— 
(1) the total direct medical cost of fall-re-
lated injuries for older adults, adjusted for 
inflation, was approximately $50,000,000,000; 
(2) with respect to nonfatal falls, Medicare 
paid approximately $28,900,000,000, Medicaid 
paid approximately $8,700,000,000, and private 
and 
other 
payers 
paid 
approximately 
$12,000,000,000; and 
(3) overall medical spending for fatal falls 
was estimated to be $754,000,000; 
Whereas, if the rate of increase in falls is 
not slowed, the annual cost of fall injuries 
will surpass $101,000,000,000 by 2030; and 
Whereas evidence-based programs reduce 
falls by utilizing cost-effective strategies, 
such as exercise programs to improve bal-
ance and strength, medication management, 
vision improvement, reduction of home haz-
ards, and falls prevention education: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 21 
through September 25, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Falls Prevention Awareness Week’’; 
(2) recognizes that there are proven, cost- 
effective falls prevention programs and poli-
cies; 
(3) commends the 73 member organizations 
of the Falls Free Coalition and the falls pre-
vention coalitions in 43 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia for their efforts to work 
together to increase education and aware-
ness about preventing falls among older 
adults; 
(4) encourages businesses, individuals, Fed-
eral, State, and local governments, the pub-
lic health community, and health care pro-
viders to work together to raise awareness of 
falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of 
falls among older adults in the United 
States; 
(5) recognizes the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention for its work developing 
and evaluating interventions for all mem-
bers of health care teams to make falls pre-
vention a routine part of clinical care; 
(6) recognizes the Administration for Com-
munity Living for its work to promote ac-
cess to evidence-based programs and services 
in communities across the United States; 
(7) encourages State health departments 
and State units on aging, which provide sig-
nificant leadership in reducing injuries and 
related health care costs by collaborating 
with organizations and individuals, to reduce 
falls among older adults; and 
(8) encourages experts in the field of falls 
prevention to share their best practices so

REFUGE DAY’’ 
Mr. GARDNER (for himself, Mr. BEN-
NET, and Mr. UDALL) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 735 
Whereas over 80 percent of people in the 
United States live in or near cities, which 
typically have limited opportunities for resi-
dents to access nature and experience out-
door recreation; 
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem under the United States Fish and Wild-
life Service manages 568 national wildlife 
refuges that constitute a national network 
of land and water managed for the conserva-
tion of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United 
States; 
Whereas national wildlife refuges provide 
opportunities for people to discover and ap-
preciate nature; 
Whereas there is a refuge located within a 
1-hour drive of every metropolitan area in 
the United States; 
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation 
Program under the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service— 
(1) focuses on introducing people living in 
densely populated areas to the more than 100 
national wildlife refuges near urban areas; 
and 
(2) promotes wildlife conservation and the 
enjoyment of hunting, fishing, and other 
wildlife-dependent 
recreational 
activities 
close to where people live; 
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation 
Program focuses on public-private partner-
ships— 
(1) to improve wildlife conservation; and 
(2) to promote access to recreation on and 
off national wildlife refuges, including rec-
reational activities such as hunting and fish-
ing; and 
Whereas by exploring community-centered 
approaches to address local needs, engaging 
the next generation of anglers and hunters, 
and providing infrastructure and safe access, 
the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program 
helps local organizations, cities, and towns 
across the United States engage in conserva-
tion activities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 29, 2020, as ‘‘Na-
tional Urban Wildlife Refuge Day’’;

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 736 
Whereas, in September 2020, ‘‘National 
Kinship Care Month’’ is observed; 
Whereas, nationally, 2,700,000 children are 
living in kinship care with grandparents, 
other relatives, and family friends (‘‘fictive 
kin’’); 
Whereas, nationally, nearly 1⁄3 of all foster 
care placements are in kinship foster care, 
with more than 133,000 children placed in 
kinship foster care; 
Whereas more than 2,600,000 kinship chil-
dren live in informal kinship care outside of 
the foster care system; 
Whereas, while kinship care is the most 
common term for relative caregivers of chil-
dren, they are sometimes also referred to as 
kincaregivers or grandfamilies; 
Whereas the number of children placed in 
foster care continues to increase due in part 
to the opioid crisis, and child welfare agen-
cies are increasingly reliant on grandparents 
and other kinship caregivers; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
kinship caregivers who are often grand-
parents with health vulnerabilities are par-
enting children in their homes, often with 
limited support; 
Whereas kinship caregivers residing in 
urban, rural, and suburban households in 
every State and territory of the United 
States have stepped forward out of love and 
loyalty to care for children during times in 
which parents are unable to do so; 
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, 
promote well-being, and establish stable 
households for vulnerable children; 
Whereas kinship care homes offer a refuge 
for traumatized children; 
Whereas kinship care enables a child— 
(1) to maintain family relationships and 
cultural heritage; and 
(2) to remain in the community of the 
child; 
Whereas the wisdom and compassion of 
kinship caregivers is a source of self-reliance 
and strength for countless children and for 
the entire United States; 
Whereas children in kinship care experi-
ence improved placement stability, higher 
levels of permanency, and decreased behav-
ioral problems; 
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting 
challenges to keep children from entering 
foster care; 
Whereas, because of parental substance use 
disorders and other adverse childhood experi-
ences, children in kinship care frequently 
have trauma-related conditions; 
Whereas many kinship caregivers give up 
their retirement years to assume parenting 
duties for children; 
Whereas the Senate wishes to honor the 
many kinship caregivers, who throughout 
the history of the United States have pro-
vided loving homes for children; 
Whereas the first president of the United 
States, George Washington, and his wife 
Martha were themselves kinship caregivers, 
as were many other great people of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize 
the many kinship care families in which a 
child is raised by grandparents, other rel-
atives, and fictive kin; 
Whereas National Kinship Care Month pro-
vides an opportunity to urge people in every 
State to join in recognizing and celebrating 
kinship caregiving families and the tradition 
of families in the United States to help kin; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress provided for 
kinship navigator programs and services in 
the Family First Prevention Services Act 
enacted under title VII of division E of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 
115–123; 132 Stat. 64) and the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141; 
132 Stat. 348); 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress provided for the 
formation of the Advisory Council to Sup-
port Grandparents Raising Grandchildren to 
examine supports for grandparents and other 
kinship caregivers in the Supporting Grand-
parents Raising Grandchildren Act (Public 
Law 115–196; 132 Stat. 1511); and 
Whereas more remains to be done to sup-
port kinship caregiving and to ensure that 
all children have a safe, loving, nurturing, 
and permanent family, regardless of age or 
special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Kinship Care Month’’; 
(2) encourages Congress, States, local gov-
ernments, and community organizations to 
continue to work to improve the lives of vul-
nerable children and families and to support 
the communities working together to lift 
them up; and

SUICIDE PREVENTION DAY’’ 
Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. WICKER,

the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 737 
Whereas the wounds sustained through 
armed service to the United States are both 
visible and invisible; 
Whereas the wounds sustained through 
armed service to the United States may be 
invisible, but those wounds are treatable if 
the bearers of those wounds are connected to 
the right resources; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs and the Department of Defense have de-
termined that an average of nearly 20 cur-
rent or former members of the Armed Forces 
die by suicide each day; 
Whereas veterans account for a dispropor-
tionate percentage of all adult suicides in 
the United States; 
Whereas the surviving family members of 
veterans who succumb to the invisible 
wounds of armed service to the United 
States must not be forgotten and isolated 
but instead must be directed to available re-
sources and support; 
Whereas, after the loss of a veteran family 
member to the invisible wounds of armed 
service to the United States, the family 
members of that veteran must not lose their 
link to the support and strength of the mili-
tary and veteran communities; 
Whereas the families of veterans who die 
by suicide hold valuable ‘‘lessons learned on 
the lookback’’ that can be used to prevent 
future suicides in veteran populations; 
Whereas the voices of the surviving family 
members of veterans who die by suicide are 
useful and should be leveraged in prevention 
efforts; 
Whereas the need for formal recognition of 
the families of veterans who succumb to the 
invisible wounds of armed service to the 
United States is vital to the strength, 
health, and survival of the veteran commu-
nity; 
Whereas those families should be recog-
nized, supported, and heard on National Vet-
erans Suicide Prevention Day and through-

S5986 
September 30, 2020 
Whereas September 30, 2020, is an appro-
priate day to designate as ‘‘National Vet-
erans Suicide Prevention Day’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the des-
ignation of September 30, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Veterans Suicide Prevention Day’’. 
f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 738—RECOG-
NIZING SUICIDE AS A SERIOUS 
PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND 
EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
DESIGNATION OF SEPTEMBER AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
SUICIDE 
PREVEN-
TION MONTH’’ 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Mr. 
MURPHY) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 738 
Whereas suicide is the 10th leading cause of 
death in the United States and the second 
leading cause of death among individuals be-
tween 10 and 34 years of age; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’), 1 individual in 
the United States dies by suicide every 11 
minutes, resulting in around 48,000 deaths 
each year in the United States; 
Whereas, according to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, 20 members of the Armed 
Forces on active duty, members of the re-
serve components of the Armed Forces who 
are not on active duty, or veterans die by 
suicide each day, resulting in more than 7,000 
deaths each year; 
Whereas, between 1999 and 2018, the suicide 
rate in the United States increased by 35 per-
cent from 10.5 suicides for every 100,000 indi-
viduals to 14.2 suicides for every 100,000 indi-
viduals; 
Whereas it is estimated that there are ap-
proximately 1,400,000 suicide attempts each 
year in the United States; 
Whereas more than half of individuals who 
die by suicide did not have a known mental 
health condition; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, many fac-
tors contribute to suicide among individuals 
with and without known mental health con-
ditions, including challenges related to rela-
tionships, substance use, physical health, 
and stress regarding work, money, legal 
problems, or housing; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, suicide re-
sults in an estimated $70,000,000,000 each year 
in combined medical and work-loss costs in 
the United States; 
Whereas the stigma associated with men-
tal health conditions and suicidality hinders 
suicide prevention by discouraging at-risk 
individuals from seeking life-saving help and 
can further traumatize survivors of suicide 
loss and individuals with lived experience of 
suicide; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
caused many individuals to experience emo-
tional distress and anxiety; 
Whereas, according to the Morbidity and 
Mortality Weekly Report of the CDC, risk 
factors for suicide, such as anxiety and de-
pression, have increased considerably since 
the onset of restrictions to help slow the 
spread of COVID–19; and 
Whereas 
September 
is 
an 
appropriate 
month to designate as ‘‘National Suicide 
Prevention Month’’ because September 10th 
is World Suicide Prevention Day, a day rec-
ognized internationally and supported by the 
World Health Organization: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes suicide as a serious and pre-
ventable public health problem of the United 
States and each State; 
(2) supports the designation of September 
as ‘‘National Suicide Prevention Month’’; 
(3) declares suicide prevention as a pri-
ority; 
(4) acknowledges that no single suicide pre-
vention program or effort will be appropriate 
for all populations or communities; 
(5) promotes awareness that there is no 
single cause of suicide; and 
(6) supports strategies to increase access to 
high-quality mental health and suicide pre-
vention services and substance-use disorder 
treatments.

739—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF 
SEPTEMBER 21 THROUGH SEP-
TEMBER 25, 2020, AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
FAMILY 
SERVICE 
LEARNING 
WEEK’’ 
Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. REED, Mr. RUBIO, and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 739 
Whereas family service learning is a meth-
od under which children and families learn 
and solve problems together in a multi- 
generational approach with active participa-
tion in thoughtfully organized service that— 
(1) is conducted in, and meets the needs of, 
their communities; 
(2) is focused on children and families solv-
ing community issues together; 
(3) requires the application of college and 
career readiness skills by children and rel-
evant workforce training skills by adults; 
and 
(4) is coordinated between the community 
and an elementary school, a secondary 
school, an institution of higher education, or 
a family community service program; 
Whereas family service learning— 
(1) is multi-generational learning that in-
volves parents, children, caregivers, and ex-
tended family members in shared learning 
experiences in physical and digital environ-
ments; 
(2) is integrated into and enhances the aca-
demic achievement of children or the edu-
cational components of a family service pro-
gram in which families may be enrolled; and 
(3) promotes skills (such as investigation, 
planning, and preparation), action, reflec-
tion, the demonstration of results, and sus-
tainability; 
Whereas family service learning has been 
shown to have positive 2-generational effects 
and encourages families to invest in their 
communities to improve economic and soci-
etal well-being; 
Whereas, through family service learning, 
children and families have the opportunity 
to solve community issues and learn to-
gether, thereby enabling the development of 
life and career skills, such as flexibility and 
adaptability, initiative and self-direction, 
social and cross-cultural skills, productivity 
and accountability, and leadership and re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas family service learning activities 
provide opportunities for families to improve 
essential skills, such as organization, re-
search, planning, reading and writing, tech-
nological literacy, teamwork, and sharing; 
Whereas families participating together in 
service are afforded quality time learning 
about their communities; 
Whereas adults engaged in family service 
learning serve as positive role models for 
their children; 
Whereas family service learning projects 
enable families to build substantive connec-
tions with their communities, develop a 
stronger sense of self-worth, experience a re-
duction in social isolation, and improve par-
enting skills; 
Whereas family service learning has added 
benefits for English language learners by 
helping individuals and families to— 
(1) feel more connected with their commu-
nities; and 
(2) practice language skills; 
Whereas family service learning is particu-
larly important for at-risk families because 
family service learning— 
(1) provides opportunities for leadership 
and civic engagement; and 
(2) helps build the capacity to advocate for 
the needs of children and families; 
Whereas family service learning programs 
are equipped to face the unique challenges 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic 
through community engagement via video 
teleconferencing or in a socially distanced 
manner; 
Whereas family service learning will re-
main relevant throughout the pandemic as 
communities face new challenges such as 
navigating remote learning, technological 
literacy, and building and maintaining new 
relationships within communities; and 
Whereas the value that parents place on 
civic engagement and relationships within 
the community has been shown to transfer 
to children who, in turn, replicate important 
values, such as responsibility, empathy, and 
caring for others: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
September 21 through September 25, 2020, as 
‘‘National Family Service Learning Week’’ 
to raise public awareness about the impor-
tance of family service learning, family lit-
eracy, 
community 
service, 
and 
2- 
generational learning experiences; 
(2) encourages people across the United 
States to support family service learning and 
community development programs; 
(3) recognizes the importance that family 
service learning plays in cultivating family 
literacy, civic engagement, and community 
investment; and 
(4) calls upon public, private, and nonprofit 
entities to support family service learning 
opportunities to aid in the advancement of 
families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5987 
September 30, 2020 
Whereas improvements in energy effi-
ciency technologies and practices, along 
with policies of the United States enacted 
since the 1970s, have resulted in energy sav-
ings of more than 60,000,000,000,000,000 British 
thermal units and energy cost avoidance of 
more than $800,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas energy efficiency has enjoyed bi-
partisan support in Congress and in adminis-
trations of both parties for more than 40 
years; 
Whereas 
bipartisan 
legislation 
enacted 
since the 1970s to advance Federal energy ef-
ficiency policies includes— 
(1) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.); 
(2) the National Appliance Energy Con-
servation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–12; 101 
Stat. 103); 
(3) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 
13201 et seq.); 
(4) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 
15801 et seq.); 
(5) the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.); and 
(6) the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act 
of 2015 (Public Law 114–11; 129 Stat. 182); 
Whereas energy efficiency has long been 
supported by a diverse coalition of busi-
nesses (including manufacturers, utilities, 
energy service companies, and technology 
firms), public-interest organizations, envi-
ronmental and conservation groups, and 
State and local governments; 
Whereas, since 1980, the United States has 
more than doubled its energy productivity, 
realizing twice the economic output per unit 
of energy consumed; 
Whereas more than 2,000,000 individuals in 
the United States are currently employed 
across the energy efficiency sector, as the 
United States has doubled its energy produc-
tivity, and business and industry have be-
come more innovative and competitive in 
global markets; 
Whereas the Office of Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy of the Department of 
Energy is the principal Federal agency re-
sponsible for renewable energy technologies 
and energy efficiency efforts; 
Whereas cutting energy waste saves the 
consumers of the United States billions of 
dollars on utility bills annually; and 
Whereas energy efficiency policies, financ-
ing innovations, and public-private partner-
ships have contributed to a reduction in en-
ergy intensity in Federal facilities by nearly 
50 percent since the mid-1970s, which results 
in direct savings to United States taxpayers: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 7, 2020, as ‘‘Energy 
Efficiency Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe Energy Efficiency Day with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties.

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 741 
Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of 
thousands of patriotic men and women, in-
cluding uranium miners, millers, and haul-
ers, have served the United States by build-
ing nuclear weapons for the defense of the 
United States; 
Whereas dedicated workers paid a high 
price for advancing a nuclear weapons pro-
gram at the service and for the benefit of the 
United States, including by developing dis-
abling or fatal illnesses; 
Whereas the Senate recognized the con-
tributions, services, and sacrifices that those 
patriotic men and women made for the de-
fense of the United States in— 
(1) Senate Resolution 151, 111th Congress, 
agreed to May 20, 2009; 
(2) Senate Resolution 653, 111th Congress,

(11) Senate Resolution 377, 116th Congress,

Whereas a time capsule for a national day 
of remembrance has been crossing the United 
States, collecting stories and artifacts of 
workers of the nuclear weapons program 
that relate to the nuclear defense era of the 
United States, and a remembrance quilt has 
been constructed to memorialize the con-
tribution of those workers; 
Whereas the stories and artifacts reflected 
in the time capsule and the remembrance 
quilt reinforce the importance of recognizing 
the workers of the nuclear weapons program 
of the United States; and 
Whereas those patriotic men and women 
deserve to be recognized for the contribu-
tions, services, and sacrifices they made for 
the defense of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 30, 2020, as a na-
tional day of remembrance for the workers 
of the nuclear weapons program of the 
United States, including the uranium min-
ers, millers, and haulers; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to support and participate in appro-
priate ceremonies, programs, and other ac-
tivities to commemorate October 30, 2020, as 
a national day of remembrance for past and 
present workers of the nuclear weapons pro-

PROHIBITING 
DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST 
INDIVIDUAL 
PARTICI-
PANTS AND BENEFICIARIES BASED 
ON HEALTH STATUS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—A group health plan and 
a health insurance issuer offering group or 
individual health insurance coverage may 
not establish rules for eligibility (including 
continued eligibility) of any individual to 
enroll under the terms of the plan or cov-
erage based on any of the following health 
status-related factors in relation to the indi-
vidual or a dependent of the individual: 
‘‘(1) Health status. 
‘‘(2) Medical condition (including both 
physical and mental illnesses). 
‘‘(3) Claims experience. 
‘‘(4) Receipt of health care. 
‘‘(5) Medical history. 
‘‘(6) Genetic information. 
‘‘(7) Evidence of insurability (including 
conditions arising out of acts of domestic vi-
olence). 
‘‘(8) Disability. 
‘‘(9) Any other health status-related factor 
determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
‘‘(b) IN PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A group health plan, and 
a health insurance issuer offering group or 
individual health insurance coverage, may 
not require any individual (as a condition of 
enrollment or continued enrollment under 
the plan) to pay a premium or contribution 
which is greater than such premium or con-
tribution for a similarly situated individual 
enrolled in the plan on the basis of any 
health status-related factor in relation to 
the individual or to an individual enrolled 
under the plan as a dependent of the indi-
vidual. 
‘‘(2) CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in paragraph 
(1) shall be construed— 
‘‘(A) to restrict the amount that an em-
ployer or individual may be charged for cov-
erage under a group health plan except as 
provided in paragraph (3) or individual 
health coverage, as the case may be; or 
‘‘(B) to prevent a group health plan, and a 
health insurance issuer offering group health 
insurance coverage, from establishing pre-
mium discounts or rebates or modifying oth-
erwise applicable copayments or deductibles 
in return for adherence to programs of 
health promotion and disease prevention. 
‘‘(3) NO
GROUP-BASED
DISCRIMINATION
ON 
BASIS OF GENETIC INFORMATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, a group health plan, and health insur-
ance issuer offering group health insurance 
coverage in connection with a group health 
plan, may not adjust premium or contribu-
tion amounts for the group covered under 
such plan on the basis of genetic informa-
tion. 
‘‘(B) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
subparagraph (A) or in paragraphs (1) and (2) 
of subsection (d) shall be construed to limit 
the ability of a health insurance issuer offer-
ing group or individual health insurance cov-
erage to increase the premium for an em-
ployer based on the manifestation of a dis-
ease or disorder of an individual who is en-
rolled in the plan. In such case, the mani-
festation of a disease or disorder in one indi-
vidual cannot also be used as genetic infor-
mation about other group members and to 
further increase the premium for the em-
ployer. 
‘‘(c) GENETIC TESTING.— 
‘‘(1) LIMITATION ON REQUESTING OR REQUIR-
ING GENETIC TESTING.—A group health plan, 
and a health insurance issuer offering health 
insurance coverage in connection with a 
group health plan, shall not request or re-
quire an individual or a family member of 
such individual to undergo a genetic test. 
‘‘(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph (1) 
shall not be construed to limit the authority 
of a health care professional who is providing 
health care services to an individual to re-
quest that such individual undergo a genetic 
test.

MENT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Nothing in paragraph (1) 
shall be construed to preclude a group health 
plan, or a health insurance issuer offering

term is defined for the purposes of applying 
the regulations promulgated by the Sec-
retary under part C of title XI of the Social 
Security Act and section 264 of this Act, as 
may be revised from time to time) consistent

health plan, shall not request, require, or 
purchase genetic information for under-
writing purposes. 
‘‘(2) PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION OF GENETIC

fering health insurance coverage in connec-
tion with a group health plan, obtains ge-
netic information incidental to the request-

technology, include genetic information of 
any embryo legally held by the individual or

‘‘(f) PROGRAMS
OF HEALTH PROMOTION
OR 
DISEASE PREVENTION.— 
‘‘(1) GENERAL PROVISIONS.— 
‘‘(A) GENERAL RULE.—For purposes of sub-
section (b)(2)(B), a program of health pro-
motion or disease prevention (referred to in 
this subsection as a ‘wellness program’) shall 
be a program offered by an employer that is 
designed to promote health or prevent dis-
ease that meets the applicable requirements 
of this subsection. 
‘‘(B) NO CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH STA-
TUS FACTOR.—If none of the conditions for 
obtaining a premium discount or rebate or 
other reward for participation in a wellness 
program is based on an individual satisfying 
a standard that is related to a health status 
factor, such wellness program shall not vio-
late this section if participation in the pro-
gram is made available to all similarly situ-
ated individuals and the requirements of 
paragraph (2) are complied with. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH STATUS 
FACTOR.—If any of the conditions for obtain-
ing a premium discount or rebate or other 
reward for participation in a wellness pro-
gram is based on an individual satisfying a 
standard that is related to a health status 
factor, such wellness program shall not vio-
late this section if the requirements of para-
graph (3) are complied with. 
‘‘(2) WELLNESS PROGRAMS NOT SUBJECT TO 
REQUIREMENTS.—If none of the conditions for 
obtaining a premium discount or rebate or 
other reward under a wellness program as de-
scribed in paragraph (1)(B) are based on an 
individual satisfying a standard that is re-
lated to a health status factor (or if such a 
wellness program does not provide such a re-
ward), the wellness program shall not violate 
this section if participation in the program 
is made available to all similarly situated 
individuals. The following programs shall 
not have to comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (3) if participation in the program 
is made available to all similarly situated 
individuals: 
‘‘(A) A program that reimburses all or part 
of the cost for memberships in a fitness cen-
ter. 
‘‘(B) A diagnostic testing program that 
provides a reward for participation and does 
not base any part of the reward on outcomes. 
‘‘(C) A program that encourages preventive 
care related to a health condition through 
the waiver of the copayment or deductible 
requirement under group health plan for the 
costs of certain items or services related to 
a health condition (such as prenatal care or 
well-baby visits). 
‘‘(D) A program that reimburses individ-
uals for the costs of smoking cessation pro-
grams without regard to whether the indi-
vidual quits smoking. 
‘‘(E) A program that provides a reward to 
individuals for attending a periodic health 
education seminar. 
‘‘(3) WELLNESS PROGRAMS SUBJECT TO RE-
QUIREMENTS.—If any of the conditions for ob-
taining a premium discount, rebate, or re-
ward under a wellness program as described 
in paragraph (1)(C) is based on an individual 
satisfying a standard that is related to a 
health status factor, the wellness program 
shall not violate this section if the following 
requirements are complied with: 
‘‘(A) The reward for the wellness program, 
together with the reward for other wellness 
programs with respect to the plan that re-
quires satisfaction of a standard related to a 
health status factor, shall not exceed 30 per-
cent of the cost of employee-only coverage 
under the plan. If, in addition to employees 
or individuals, any class of dependents (such 
as spouses or spouses and dependent chil-
dren) may participate fully in the wellness 
program, such reward shall not exceed 30 
percent of the cost of the coverage in which 
an employee or individual and any depend-
ents are enrolled. For purposes of this para-
graph, the cost of coverage shall be deter-
mined based on the total amount of em-
ployer and employee contributions for the 
benefit package under which the employee is 
(or the employee and any dependents are) re-
ceiving coverage. A reward may be in the 
form of a discount or rebate of a premium or 
contribution, a waiver of all or part of a 
cost-sharing 
mechanism 
(such 
as 
deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), 
the absence of a surcharge, or the value of a 
benefit that would otherwise not be provided 
under the plan. The Secretaries of Labor, 
Health and Human Services, and the Treas-
ury may increase the reward available under 
this subparagraph to up to 50 percent of the 
cost of coverage if the Secretaries determine 
that such an increase is appropriate. 
‘‘(B) The wellness program shall be reason-
ably designed to promote health or prevent 
disease. A program complies with the pre-
ceding sentence if the program has a reason-
able chance of improving the health of, or 
preventing disease in, participating individ-
uals and it is not overly burdensome, is not 
a subterfuge for discriminating based on a 
health status factor, and is not highly sus-
pect in the method chosen to promote health 
or prevent disease. 
‘‘(C) The plan shall give individuals eligi-
ble for the program the opportunity to qual-
ify for the reward under the program at least 
once each year. 
‘‘(D) The full reward under the wellness 
program shall be made available to all simi-
larly situated individuals. For such purpose, 
among other things: 
‘‘(i) The reward is not available to all simi-
larly situated individuals for a period unless 
the wellness program allows— 
‘‘(I) for a reasonable alternative standard 
(or waiver of the otherwise applicable stand-
ard) for obtaining the reward for any indi-
vidual for whom, for that period, it is unrea-
sonably difficult due to a medical condition 
to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard; 
and 
‘‘(II) for a reasonable alternative standard 
(or waiver of the otherwise applicable stand-
ard) for obtaining the reward for any indi-
vidual for whom, for that period, it is medi-
cally inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the 
otherwise applicable standard. 
‘‘(ii) 
If 
reasonable 
under 
the 
cir-
cumstances, the plan or issuer may seek 
verification, such as a statement from an in-
dividual’s physician, that a health status 
factor makes it unreasonably difficult or 
medically inadvisable for the individual to 
satisfy or attempt to satisfy the otherwise 
applicable standard. 
‘‘(E) The plan or issuer involved shall dis-
close in all plan materials describing the 
terms of the wellness program the avail-
ability of a reasonable alternative standard 
(or the possibility of waiver of the otherwise 
applicable standard) required under subpara-
graph (D). If plan materials disclose that 
such a program is available, without describ-
ing its terms, the disclosure under this sub-
paragraph shall not be required.’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—The table of 
contents under section 1(b) of the Health In-
surance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996 (Public Law 104–191) is amended by in-
serting after the item relating to section 195 
the following: 
‘‘Sec. 196. Prohibition of pre-existing condi-
tion exclusions. 
‘‘Sec. 197. Guaranteed Availability of Cov-
erage. 
‘‘Sec. 198. Prohibiting 
Discrimination 
against individual participants 
and

PROTECTING BUSINESS OPPORTU-
NITIES FOR VETERANS ACT OF 
2019 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 561 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 561) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to improve the oversight of con-
tracts awarded by the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs to small business concerns owned and 
controlled by veterans, and for other pur-
poses. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to 
enter into a colloquy with Senators 
MORAN and TESTER, the chairman and 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, to discuss 
H.R. 561, the Protecting Business Op-
portunities for Veterans Act. 
H.R. 561 is important legislation that 
seeks to prevent large companies from 
using a veteran-owned small business 
as a front to win a small business set- 
aside or sole-source contract that the 
small business contractor is incapable 
of performing. To prevent this, H.R. 561 
places certain subcontracting limita-
tions on the Department of Veterans’ 
Affairs Vet’s First contracting pro-
gram. For the agency’s small business 
set-asides for veteran-owned and serv-
ice-disabled veteran-owned small busi-
nesses, the small business prime would 
need to certify that it will perform 50 
percent more of the work. This limita-
tion on subcontracting can only be cir-
cumvented if the small business prime 
subcontracts to a ‘‘similarly situated’’ 
business. 
However, as ranking member of the 
Senate Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship Committee, I have two con-
cerns with this legislation. 
The first concern is that all the pen-
alties for violating the limitations on 
subcontracting fall on the small busi-
ness prime contractor and does not 
provide the agency with the flexibility 
to impose penalties on the subcon-
tractor that is using the small business 
as a front to win the contract. This is 
inconsistent with similar Small Busi-
ness Administration regulations gov-
erning other small business set-asides 
that provide the necessary flexibility 
to penalize the appropriate party. 
The second concern is that the bill 
requires the Department of Veterans’ 
Affairs to monitor compliance by using 
a reporting system that is not used by 
small business prime contractors be-
cause small businesses are exempt 
from the requirement to provide a 
small business subcontracting plan. 
The current system does not have the 
capability to record compliance on lim-
itations of subcontracting and a sys-
tem has not been established by the 
Small Business Administration. Sim-
ply put, there is no system in place for 
small businesses to report into and 
needs to be created.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6002 
September 30, 2020 
While I recognize the importance and 
need for H.R. 561 and believe it should 
be sent to the President for his signa-
ture, would the chair and ranking 
member of the Senate Veterans Affairs 
Committee provide assurances that we 
can work together on future legislation 
to address my concerns? 
Mr. MORAN. Yes. 
Mr. TESTER. Yes. The bill before us, 
H.R. 561, seeks to crack down on the 
unfair practice of using veteran and 
service-disabled 
owned 
small 
busi-
nesses as pass-throughs for larger con-
tractors to secure Federal contracts. I 
would like to thank Senator CARDIN for 
working diligently on this issue and for 
his leadership as ranking member of 
the Senate Small Business and Entre-
preneurship Committee. I look forward 
to working closely with him to ensure 
this legislation meets congressional in-
tent once it is enacted. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third timed and passed and the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 561) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed.

COMMENDING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL DAVID A. PIFFARERIO 
HON. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commend Brigadier General 
David A. Piffarerio for his admirable dedication 
and selfless service to our Nation. BG 
Piffarerio will retire from his assignment as 
Commander of the 482nd Fighter Wing, Air 
Force Reserve Command, Homestead Air Re-
serve Base (HARB), Florida on August 2, 
2020. BG Piffarerio first took command of the 
482nd Fighter Wing at HARB on September 9, 
2018. BG Piffarerio’s tenure as Commander 
has marked everlasting change in the City of 
Homestead. 
BG Piffarerio was commissioned to the 
United States Air Force in 1994 as an honor 
graduate. BG Piffarerio has served as a com-
mand pilot with over 3,500 flying hours making 
him one of the most proficient pilots in air-
crafts such as the F–15E. His devotion to fly-
ing led him to a major milestone, becoming 
the first pilot in the Air Force to log 1,000 
hours in the F–22 Raptor. BG Piffarerio has 
dedicated over 13 years on active duty in a 
variety of F–15E Strike Eagle and F–22 as-
signments. He was selected as part of the first 
cadre to test the F–22 during follow-on evalua-
tions in 2002. Shortly after, BG Piffarerio was 
named program manager and F–22 test direc-
tor at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. BG 
Piffarerio was also a part of the initial cadre 
who stood up the 477th Fighter Group in 
2007. He served as the Commander of the 
302nd Fighter Squadron, Air Force Reserve 
Command’s 477th Fighter Group, Elmendorf 
Air Force Base, Alaska. Prior to assuming 
command of the 482nd Fighter Wing, BG 
Piffarerio was the Command Center Director 
at Joint Headquarters North American Aero-
space Defense Command and U.S. Northern 
Command. 
This admirable work ethic, experienced 
operational knowledge, and excellent leader-
ship made him a respected and honorable 
Commander of the 482nd Fighter Wing. For 
the community in Florida’s Congressional Dis-
trict 26, and the devoted men and women at 
Homestead Air Reserve Base, BG Piffarerio 
embodies superior professionalism. He led his 
members with courage and consistency. 
Under his respected role, BG Piffarerio com-
manded over 2,500 personnel members, 
stemming from active duty Air Force associa-
tion personnel, traditional reservists, Air Re-
serve technicians, and full-time civilians. BG 
Piffarerio also managed wide-ranging tenant 
units that include the Air National Guard’s 
125th Fighter Wing, Detachment 1 Alert Force, 
Headquarters, Special Operations Command, 
South (SOCSOUTH), U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime 
Safety and Security Team (MSST 91114), the 
Florida Army National Guard’s 50th Regional 
Support Group, and members of the United 
States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). 
BG Piffarerio’s impact reaches far beyond 
the work at HARB, ensuring the Homestead 
community benefits as well. He led efforts in 
enacting positive change within the community 
by partnering with local businesses, Home-
stead Hospital, Veterans Affairs, Military Af-
fairs Committee (MAC), the South Dade 
Chamber of Commerce, and many other com-
munity organizations. It has been an honor to 
have someone of exceptional caliber serve as 
Commander. On behalf of a grateful nation, I 
join my colleagues today and congratulate 
General Piffarerio for a lifetime of service. We 
wish him, his wife, Jennifer and his son, 
Bryce, the best wishes on his new journey as 
Deputy Commander, U.S. Alaskan Command, 
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHIMKUS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor and recognition of my good 
friend and mentor, Congressman JOHN SHIM-
KUS of Illinois’ 15th District. 
For 23 years, JOHN has served here in the 
House of Representatives, leading our delega-
tion and making his mark on the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. Before his 
service in Congress, JOHN served our country 
in the United States Army and the United 
States Army Reserve, retiring with the rank of 
Lieutenant Colonel. 
For his district and his country, JOHN has 
served with great honor, integrity, and convic-
tion. He has changed the game with his work 
on our nation’s energy portfolio and chemical 
safety measures, especially with the Frank R. 
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Cen-
tury Act, which became law in June 2016 and 
formally outlined how we use and dispose of 
chemicals. 
This was a major undertaking and the suc-
cess of this legislative achievement is one of 
many you’ll find throughout JOHN’s career. 
In Congress, he was a champion for finding 
safe nuclear waste repository solutions and re-
ducing greenhouse gases and sulfur emis-
sions. 
He introduced legislation that would stream-
line permits to enable efficient broadband in-
frastructure, recognizing the needs of under-
served communities. 
He also championed the 1999 legislation 
that officially designated 9–1–1 as the uni-
versal emergency telephone number within the 
U.S. 
Yes, that’s right—JOHN SHIMKUS made 9–1– 
1 the official emergency number and we 
should ALL be grateful. His effort to create 
and establish this comprehensive emergency 
communications infrastructure has undoubt-
edly saved countless lives. 
During his time in the House, JOHN’s legisla-
tive accomplishments ran the gamut—from the 
9–1–1 legislation and his impressive (and ex-
pansive) energy policy portfolio, to improving 
child safety measures through Anton’s Law 
and others, securing funding for rare cancer 
research, protecting veterans and our commu-
nities, and leading countless biofuel and tele-
communication provisions. 
The bills he championed have been signed 
into law by three different presidents, show-
casing the prowess JOHN has in legislating 
and working across the aisle to get things 
done for the American people. 
It’s this ability to find common ground and 
work together with his colleagues to get the 
job done that has made JOHN so successful 
as a Congressman and so well-respected as 
a colleague. 
His leadership has been critical over the 
years, and I know without question that this in-
stitution is better because of his service and 
that I am a better Member of Congress be-
cause of his guidance. 
JOHN SHIMKUS is more than a colleague, 
he’s a true friend and a patriot. His impact on 
Members like me has been incredibly pro-
found and I know his legacy of servant leader-
ship will continue to serve as a model for in-
coming Members of Congress for years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, the hometown hero of Col-
linsville, Illinois has served this chamber well 
and is most deserving of this recognition here 
today. We are going to miss our good friend 
JOHN SHIMKUS in the People’s House, but we 
wish him all the best in his retirement.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHIMKUS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor a good friend and esteemed colleague, 
the gentleman from Illinois, JOHN SHIMKUS. 
Congressman SHIMKUS has been a true 
statesman and a devoted public servant for 
the people of his district. 
He’s a testament to hard work, commitment 
to the job, and dedication to serving the 
United States of America. 
JOHN and I have served on the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee together and 
share a passion for energy and environment 
policy. 
We have fought for Yucca Mountain and for 
the promise of a permanent geological reposi-
tory for our nation’s nuclear waste, something 
that impacts both South Carolina and Illinois. 
We have fought for the advancement of nu-
clear energy as part of our all-of-the-above en-
ergy matrix and a carbon-free source of elec-
tricity. 
We fought for these things and more—and 
his efforts in these fights will be truly missed.

HONORING THE CITY OF BETHANY, 
MISSOURI 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize the City of Beth-
any. Bethany is celebrating 175 years of being 
a town this September. Located within Har-
rison County, Bethany may be a small town 
within my district, but this town’s roots run far-
ther than can be imagined. 
Bethany, having been around since 1845, is 
well known for its early days of being a rail-
road town which ultimately shaped the econ-
omy, culture and community of this wonderful 
town for almost 100 years until the last train 
pulled out of Bethany in 1980. The Railroad 
industry wasn’t the only industry that helped 
the City of Bethany become what it is today. 
For many years, Bethany was known as one 
of the best trading places in Northwest Mis-
souri. Now thanks to the Interstate 35, Beth-
any is still is on the map in Northwest Missouri 
for its service industry and retail industry 
which has fueled the wonderful growth of 
Bethany over the past 30 to 40 years. Home 
of Babe Adams, a great baseball player who 
pitched in three world series games, and Ben-
jamin Prentiss, a Civil War General and former 
Postmaster of Bethany, the city of Bethany 
has many reasons to be proud of its past 175 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing the City of Bethany for 175 
years of existence but also to recognize the 
city’s extremely bright future ahead. I am hon-
ored to represent every citizen within and 
around the City of Bethany in the United 
States Congress.

IN HONOR OF DONNA KELLY-WIL-
LIAMS, RN, PRESIDENT, MASSA-
CHUSETTS NURSES ASSOCIATION 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Donna Kelly-Williams in recognition 
of her outstanding contributions to the Amer-
ican Labor Movement, the Massachusetts 
Nurses Association and for nearly fifty years of 
dedicated service to her community. 
The daughter of Louise and John Kelly of 
Somerville, MA, Donna was born on Sep-
tember 19, 1954. Her family lived on Marion 
Street in Somerville until they moved to Arling-
ton, MA. Donna and her husband Bill bought 
a house just a few doors down from her par-
ents where they reside today. 
Donna attended St. Joseph’s High School in 
Somerville. Subsequently, she enrolled at La-
Salle College where she earned her nursing 
degree. She then enrolled at the University of 
Massachusetts, Boston, earning her under-
graduate degree, and then earning a Masters’ 
Degree at Cambridge College. In 2007, she 
attended the Harvard Trade Union Labor Pro-
gram. 
Madam Speaker, Donna took a job at Cam-
bridge Hospital and observed a strike by a 
union at the hospital. She called her father 
and he instructed her to come home imme-
diately and not cross the picket line. This inci-
dent sparked her fire for collective bargaining, 
workers’ rights and fair representation. 
Donna accepted a nursing position at Cam-
bridge Hospital, becoming the President of the 
Cambridge Hospital MNA Bargaining Com-
mittee. Not surprisingly, she rose to the posi-
tion of Vice-President of the MNA, and for the 
past twelve years has been President of the 
MNA. 
During her tenure as MNA President, Donna 
has worked ferociously to represent the 
nurses and health care professionals in this 
state. She has accomplished much: legislation 
banning mandatory overtime was passed as 
well as legislation limiting the number of pa-
tients assigned to ICU nurses across the 
Commonwealth. 
Throughout 
this 
COVID 
19 
pandemic, 
Donna has fought for PPE for healthcare pro-
fessionals, for legislation to limit occupational 
exposure to COVID 19, and to eliminate the 
re-use of n95 masks which endangers the 
safety of those who use them. She has 
worked to secure housing for nurses who are 
fearful of carrying the virus home, and for 
counseling for those who are in need. 
Madam Speaker, Donna is known for her 
kind smile, quick sense of humor, her relent-
less energy when fighting for her nurses and 
her affection for Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee. 
She has had the good fortune to be married 
to Bill for 42 years. They are the proud par-
ents of four children and three grandchildren. 
It is my distinct honor to join with Donna 
Kelly-Williams’ family, friends, and contem-
poraries to thank her for her service to the 
American Labor Movement, and for her dedi-
cation to nurses and patients across the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts.

CELEBRATING BOND BETWEEN 10 
YEAR OLD KHLOE MOUTRA AND 
MISSOURI CITY POLICE OFFICER 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate a special bond that developed be-
tween Missouri City, TX Police Officer Jessica 
Berry and a young girl, Khloe Moutra. Their 
friendship sparked a community initiative to 
collect books for officers to distribute at events 
and on emergency scenes. 
This friendship began thanks to Khloe’s 
grandmother who introduced her to officers at 
the Missouri City Police Department. After the 
meeting, ‘‘A Book and a Smile’’ was started 
with Khloe’s extra savings, a program de-
signed to give books to families who couldn’t 
get them at libraries due to the pandemic. 
Khloe’s goal is to give 1 million books to 1 mil-
lion kids—and she’s well on her way with a re-
cent donation of 1,000 children’s books from 
Disney. 
Khloe’s grandmother wanted her to feel safe 
going to the police for help when she needed 
it. This simple gesture blossomed into a won-
derful friendship and initiated a goodwill effort 
to support literacy and give back to the com-
munity. This special alliance highlights the po-
tential for goodwill during this pandemic and 
beyond. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I thank Khloe Moutra 
and the Missouri City Police Department for 
the inspirational work they’ve done for our 
community.

CONGRATULATING 
SISTER 
BETH 
BROSMER 
A 
CHAMPION 
FOR 
THOSE IN NEED, ON HER RE-
TIREMENT FROM HEART, LOVE 
& SOUL 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Sister Beth 
Brosmer on her retirement as Executive Direc-
tor of Heart, Love & Soul, a nonprofit in the 
city of Niagara Falls, New York ‘‘dedicated to 
feeding those in need; body, mind and soul.’’ 
A native of Columbus, Ohio and a member 
of the Sisters of St. Francis at Stella Niagara 
for more than five decades, Sister Beth’s ca-
reer of care included a stint as development 
director for her order to ensure the care of her 
fellow sisters and at one of her hometown 
hospitals working with volunteers. Her experi-
ence and determination in making a difference 
in the lives of others made her an ideal choice 
eleven years ago to lead this agency that lives 
up to its name. 
Heart, Love & Soul is now one of the largest 
organizations in Niagara County, serving indi-
viduals and families from Niagara Falls to 
Lake Ontario. Founded in 1982 as a food pan-
try by a local prayer group, Heart, Love & Soul 
has expanded over the years and most dra-
matically under the direction of Sister Beth to 
include a dining room, case management, chil-
dren’s, veterans and senior services, cooking

and nutrition classes and community care pro-
grams. Sister Beth also oversaw the develop-
ment of many strong partnerships, especially 
with the students and faculty of Niagara Uni-
versity, and an expansion of private fund-
raising, foundation support and public grant 
awards to meet the growing demand for qual-
ity health and nutritional services. 
Sister Beth once said, ‘‘At Heart and Soul I 
feel as I’ve come home’’ and it is with her wel-
coming smile, boundless energy and unwaver-
ing respect for the humanity of others that she 
greets her clients, fellow staff members and all 
who come to her in need. She makes every-
one feel like they have found a home as well 
with her candor, commitment and complete 
embrace of social justice. Sister Beth’s service 
to others has blazed a trail for us to follow. 
Though truly humble and generous in her 
gratitude to others, it must be acknowledged 
that her legacy will live on in ‘‘Daybreak,’’ the 
new one-stop center opening this year fol-
lowing a multi-million-dollar capital campaign. 
More than 30 partner agencies will be housed 
under one roof allowing for easier access to 
expanded services for the homeless and those 
who find themselves in need of assistance. 
I am honored to have had the opportunity to 
work with Sister Beth for the betterment of Ni-
agara Falls and our Western New community 
as she has become a voice for those tradition-
ally not heard and a champion for those who 
deserve every opportunity to live lives of 
value. Fueled by her deep faith, Sister Beth 
Brosmer embodies the unyielding compassion 
necessary to foster healing in mind, body and 
soul. And while she will be greatly missed, 
Sister Beth Brosmer’s home will always be at 
Heart, Love & Soul.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
NORMAN DUNCAN 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the life of Norman Duncan, a 
World War II veteran who dutifully served our 
country, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and 
his Loudoun County community throughout his 
life. 
Mr. Duncan was born in 1919 to Lithuanian 
immigrants and grew up in Manhattan before 
moving to Washington, D.C. He was drafted 
during World War II, and, following a training 
accident, was reassigned to General Eisen-
hower’s extended staff and special services di-
vision. In this role, he oversaw logistics and 
supply for U.S. bases in Great Britain and 
supported Operation Torch in North Africa and 
Operation Overlord in Normandy. He was 
awarded the Legion of Honor from France in 
2018 for his service. 
Following his military career, he made his 
home in Virginia and worked as a transpor-
tation logistics specialist. He was an advocate 
for minority participation in the transportation 
industry and volunteered his expertise to serve 
on President Carter’s National Defense Execu-
tive Reserve and to consult on logistics for 
President Reagan’s inauguration. 
Mr. Duncan was also very active in his com-
munity and was named one of the 100 most 
influential people in Loudoun County in 2016. 
He served on the Loudoun County Transpor-
tation Economic Development Committee and 
as a board member of the Loudoun Sym-
phony. He was also a passionate advocate for 
caregivers, having cared for Elsie, his beloved 
wife of 72 years, as she struggled with Alz-
heimer’s disease in her final years. Labor of 
Love Day, which he founded, is celebrated 
every Labor Day in Loudoun County to raise 
awareness of family caregivers and their loved 
ones who struggle with Alzheimer’s. 
Mr. Duncan passed away last year at the 
age of 100, two months after he attended the 
75th anniversary and commemoration of the 
D-Day landings in Normandy, France. He is 
deeply missed by his three children, eight 
grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and 
two great-great-grandchildren. 
Today, the House of Representatives will 
honor Mr. Duncan’s life and memory by pass-
ing legislation to name the post office in Lees-
burg, Virginia after him. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing Mr. Duncan’s life and 
his lifelong commitment to service.

RECOGNIZING HYDROCEPHALUS 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Hydrocephalus Awareness 
Month. Every September patients, caregivers 
and their families come together throughout 
the nation in support of the more than 
1,000,000 people of all ages living with hydro-
cephalus in the United States. As co-chair of 
the Congressional Pediatric and Adult Hydro-
cephalus Caucus, I believe Congress has an 
important role to play in both raising aware-
ness of this condition, as well as crafting poli-
cies that result in better treatments and poten-
tially a cure. I urge my colleagues to join the 
caucus to learn more about this devastating 
condition. 
Anyone can develop hydrocephalus, an ab-
normal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in 
the brain, at any time. This can include pre-
mature babies, active duty service members, 
veterans, and seniors. Individuals can also be 
born with hydrocephalus, develop it as part of 
the aging process, or acquire it as a result of 
infections, brain tumors or traumatic brain inju-
ries, among other causes. The only present 
treatment for this condition is brain surgery. 
From children to veterans, the prevalence of 
this condition is reflected in my own district. 
The physicians and staff at the Children’s 
Hospital of San Antonio perform the brain sur-
geries necessary to treat many of the one in 
770 babies across the country who develop 
hydrocephalus per year. Nationwide, these 
cases alone cost the U.S. health care system 
$2 billion per year. Veterans and active mili-
tary personnel, such as those stationed at 
Joint 
Base 
San 
Antonio, 
are 
also 
disproportionally affected. Medical researchers 
believe that two-thirds of our nation’s current 
and former military service members suffering 
from moderate to severe traumatic brain inju-
ries are at risk of developing hydrocephalus. 
In the midst of this pandemic, it is now more 
important than ever to improve the federal 
government’s partnership with the hydro-
cephalus community. Many individuals with 
hydrocephalus live with other serious medical 
comorbidities, putting them at a higher risk for 
severe illness from COVID–19. We must do all 
we can to help patients, health care profes-
sionals and families as they struggle to main-
tain and improve quality of life during these 
challenging times. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and 
the 1 million Americans living with hydro-
cephalus by joining the Congressional Pedi-
atric and Hydrocephalus Caucus.

Through his extreme dedication to public serv-

Frank was born on December 28, 1963. 
After graduating from Traverse City Saint 
Francis High School in 1982, Frank spent a 
year working with Young Americans as a light

twenty-two career in Michigan Republican poli-
tics, where he would go on to greatly shape 
the political makeup of Michigan, especially in 
Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. 
His dedication, kindness, and infectious cha-
risma made him well liked and respected by 
all who had the opportunity to meet him. 
Frank passed away on September 5, 2020. 
He is missed dearly by his family and friends, 
and his legacy will undoubtedly live on for 
generations for come. Frank’s tireless devotion 
to the public good touched the lives of count-
less Michiganders, and the impact of his work 
cannot be overstated.

HONORING WESTON T. HENNING 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Weston T. 
Henning. Weston is a very special young man 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active 
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 43, 
and earning the most prestigious award of 
Eagle Scout. 
Weston has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Weston has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Wes-
ton has contributed to his community through 
his Eagle Scout project. Weston restored a 
sign and added landscaping around the Agen-
cy Community Center in Agency, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Weston T. Henning for his 
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND MEMORY OF MS. ROSEMARY 
LOWE 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and memory of a dear mentor, a great Kansas 
Citian, and an extraordinary American: Ms. 
Rosemary Lowe. Ms. Lowe, who passed away 
on the evening of September 22nd, was an 
unstoppable force for change, force for good, 
and force of nature. A public servant can only 
hope to mean to their community what Ms. 
Lowe means to hers. Since I learned of her 
passing, I have been thinking about her re-
markable story—about everything she was 
able to accomplish—and I still find it hard to 
believe she was able to fit it all into just nine-
ty-four years. 
Ms. Lowe grew up in Dumas, Arkansas in 
the painful shadow of Jim Crow. When she 
was just fifteen, her family moved to Kansas 
City, where she would go on to become a pio-
neer in the fight for desegregation. Ms. Lowe 
spent her early career with another pioneer in 
that struggle: Black physician Dr. Dennis 
Madison Miller, who would go on to be ap-
pointed Superintendent of the Jackson County 
Hospital Colored Division. She worked for him 
for twenty-three years at his office on 18th and 
Vine. In the 1950s, Ms. Lowe was instru-
mental in efforts to desegregate downtown 
Kansas City department stores. Ms. Lowe was 
also instrumental in the founding of Freedom, 
Incorporated of Kansas City, Missouri, a polit-
ical organization conceived in 1961 to elevate 
the votes, voices, and volition of the Black 
community of Kansas City to the halls of gov-
ernment. The next year, she and Freedom, 
Inc. co-founder Leon Jordan ran for seats as 
Democratic committee representatives for our 
City’s 14th Ward. She lost. Jordan won. But 
Ms. Lowe would later go on to win that seat 
and hold it for two decades as Kansas City’s 
first Black committeewoman. In 1964, when 
thousands of activists travelled south to Mis-
sissippi as part of Freedom Summer, Ms. 
Lowe stayed in Kansas City and helped reg-
ister thousands of Black voters before a city-
wide vote on a proposed ordinance that would 
make it illegal to discriminate in taverns, trade 
schools, hospitals, and clinics. Kansas City’s 
public accommodations ordinance passed, 
predating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by sev-
eral months. A retired cosmetologist, she 
spent her later years, if anything, expanding 
her efforts to help her community. She volun-
teered for the American Red Cross at Meno-
rah Medical Center and the Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital of Kansas City, won and main-
tained a place on the Democratic National 
Committee for six years, co-founded the Local 
Investment Commission to improve the lives of 
children and families in the Kansas City re-
gion, and helped convince city leaders to relo-
cate a Patrol Division of the Kansas City Po-
lice Department and rename it after none 
other than Freedom, Inc. co-founder and 
KCPD’s first Black lieutenant, Leon Jordan. 
And whether it was Freedom, Inc., the Kansas 
City Democratic Committee, LINC, or any 
other of the tables of decision at which Ms. 
Lowe sat, she was, more often than not, either 
the only woman, the only Black voice, or both. 
I failed to mention, of course, the linchpin of 
Ms. Lowe’s life of service. In 1952, after the 
Supreme Court ruled that people could not be 
evicted from their homes on the basis of race, 
Ms. Lowe’s became one of the first Black fam-
ilies to move to the beautiful Santa Fe Neigh-
borhood on the East Side of Kansas City. 
Kansas City’s history of ‘redlining’ and Santa 
Fe’s history of racial covenants meant the 
transition for the first wave of Black residents 
was far from easy. White families began to 
move away in fear until, in 1955, just 15 per-
cent of the neighborhood remained White- 
owned. Years later, when new residents would 
move into the Santa Fe Neighborhood, they 
were told to go see the President of the Santa 
Fe Area Council, a Ms. Rosemary Lowe, who 
had held the position for many decades. As 
President of the Santa Fe Neighborhood, Ms. 
Lowe fought for more streetlights, improved 
housing and infrastructure, and stronger, more 
trusting ties between police and the commu-
nities they had sworn to protect. 
Ms. Lowe was also a sage counselor, men-
tor, and role model to countless civic leaders, 
community organizers, and elected officials 
like myself, who sought her wisdom as we 
began our own barrier-breaking careers on a 
path she helped pave. We who owed her so 
much, who loved her so much, who looked up 
to her so much—we called her ‘‘Mother 
Lowe.’’ We sought her out not only for her ex-
perience and wisdom, but also for her kind-
ness, 
her 
warmth, 
and 
her 
unflinching, 
unapologetic honesty. She is the political 
mother of African American power in Kansas 
City. 
Decades working for Dr. Dennis Miller, dec-
ades as the committeewoman for the 14th 
Ward, decades as the President of the Santa 
Fe Area Council—Ms. Lowe was one of the 
most dedicated public servants I have ever 
seen in action. Hers was not a rise to power, 
where one springs from one post to another. 
Ms. Lowe became ‘‘Mother Lowe’’ because 
she stayed in the arena, fighting in the strug-
gles of today, every day, for ninety-four years’ 
worth of days. 
There is a stretch of street in Kansas City, 
on 29th between Prospect and Indiana Ave-
nue. It runs right through the heart of the 
Santa Fe Neighborhood. It is called the Hon-
orary Rosemary S. Lowe Lane. Today, we 
honor a woman who has defined a stretch of 
history in Kansas City. It is a stretch that runs 
right through the heart of our struggle to be-
come more free and more equal. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in honoring the ex-
traordinary life and memory of Ms. Rosemary 
Lowe. Ms. Lowe’s march to a better future for 
our city did not relent for one minute. Let us 
be grateful for the world she handed us and 
resolve to bring the spirit of Mother Lowe to 
each and every effort we undertake to make 
it better.

CONGRATULATING BILL BECKER 
HON. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Bill Becker on 
his 30 years of remarkable service to the Flor-
ida Keys-based U.S. 1 Radio 104.1 FM and to 
our community. 
Bill began his career with U.S. 1 Radio in 
1980 when the news station had just estab-
lished itself. He served as the news director, 
where he broadcasted local news, and hosted 
U.S. 1’s 90-minute ‘‘Morning Magazine’’ every 
morning to highlight local issues and events 
through on-air interviews and commentary. 
His passion and devotion to marine biology 
first led him to the Florida Keys and is what 
jumpstarted his career in radio. After grad-
uating in 1971, Bill began working at the 
Lower Keys’ Newfound Harbor Marine Institute 
at Sea Camp. He taught marine biology to 
kids, through outreach programs and became 
involved in local organizations. Bill co-founded 
one of the Lower Keys’ signature events: the 
annual Underwater Music Festival that spot-
lights coral reef preservation. Every year the 
event draws hundreds of diving and snorkeling 
enthusiasts, as well as national and inter-
national media coverage.

With his unyielding dedication to his com-
munity, Bill’s work has left a tremendous im-
pact in numerous people’s lives. He volun-
teered his time during the 1998 Hurricane 
Georges to offer comfort and critical live up-
dates throughout the storm. Bill partook in 
broadcasts in Cuba as part of humanitarian ef-
forts led by a local group taking essential 
medical supplies and food to the island nation. 
In 1982, Bill broadcasted live from Key West’s 
Mallory Square when the Florida Keys se-
ceded from the Union and formed the inde-
pendent Conch Republic. Aside from his hard 
work in broadcasting, Bill also dedicated his 
time to the community of the Lower Keys by 
serving as the president of the Lower Keys 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Through all these accomplishments, Bill 
made himself a pillar of the Keys community 
and his retirement marks the end of an era. 
Bill embodies the hard working, community- 
minded nature that the Florida Keys is known 
for. On behalf of Florida’s 26th District, I would 
like to thank Bill for his contribution to the 
community and wish him the absolute best in 
this next chapter of his life.

PRESIDENT/CEO 
OF 
THE GREATER HERNANDO COUN-

HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
it is with sincere appreciation that I recognize 
my friend Patricia Crowley, President/CEO of 
the Greater Hernando County Chamber of 
Commerce, for her leadership and service to 
our business community. After 20 years of 
service to the Greater Hernando County 
Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Crowley will retire 
on October 31, 2020. 
Ms. Crowley began her career with the 
Greater Hernando County Chamber of Com-
merce in March of 2000 as a Membership 
Representative. A few years later, Ms. Crow-
ley was named President/CEO of the Greater 
Hernando County Chamber of Commerce. 
Throughout her years of service with the 
Chamber, she formed strong partnerships with 
local leaders and business organizations to 
strengthen the county’s business environment 
to enable business development and pros-
perity throughout Hernando County. 
Ms. Crowley has been a dedicated servant 
to people of Hernando County throughout her 
career. She has served in several organiza-
tions including the United Way of Hernando 
County, Kiwanis Club of Brooksville, and Oak 
Hill Hospital Board. 
I am honored to recognize Patricia Crowley 
and thank her for her hard work and countless 
contributions to the Hernando County commu-
nity. Her commitment to excellence, leadership 
and service is to be admired, and may it in-
spire others to follow in her footsteps. My sin-
cerest wishes and congratulations to Pat on 
her retirement. 
HONORING MICHAEL LAIRMORE 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Michael Lairmore and his 
nearly 10 years of distinguished service as the 
Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at 
the University of California, Davis. As Dr. 
Lairmore retires this year, his dedicated tenure 
ensures he leaves behind a veterinary school 
which, ranks among the best in the world and 
is well-placed to further its success at the fore-
front of veterinary science far into the future. 
Alongside the school’s pioneering research, 
the veterinary hospital is unmatched in reputa-
tion and patient visits. 
Dr. Lairmore became Dean in 2011 and im-
mediately set to work; crafting a long-term and 
multifaceted plan to guide the institution to its 
full potential. His emphasis on the importance 
of the school’s student and patient experience 
at the forefront of his efforts and under his 
leadership, the school implemented multiple 
comprehensive student programs, such as the 
Office of Global Programs and the Counseling 
and Career Service Center. Dr. Lairmore si-
multaneously reigned in student fees and was 
a vanguard for diversity, ultimately making UC 
Davis a leader among veterinary schools with 
both the lowest levels of student debt and 
most diverse student body. Together this al-
lowed UC Davis’ program to tackle inequities 
in the veterinary field and create greater op-
portunities for the most disadvantaged stu-
dents. 
Dr. Lairmore expanded the school’s re-
search capabilities—placing them at the top in 
funding, infrastructure, and cutting-edge tech-
nology. 
With 
his 
guidance, 
the 
school 
partnered with the United States State Depart-
ment’s Office of Food and Agriculture; to cur-
tail the Newcastle and Mad Cow viruses. In 
addition, Dr. Lairmore played a pivotal role in 
the development of USAID’s PREDICT project 
and identifying the Marburg and Ebola viruses 
in bats preventing potential outbreaks. While 
the world continues to combat the coronavirus 
pandemic, UC Davis provides a model for 
stopping future pandemics before they are al-
lowed to spread. 
Dr. Lairmore is continuing his career with 
the School of Veterinary Medicine as a distin-
guished professor in the Department of Pa-
thology, Microbiology, and Immunology. How-
ever, it is clear that his legacy as Dean will 
continue to shape the school and its students 
and faculty for years to come. On behalf of the 
people of California’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my sincere gratitude for his dedi-
cated service and best wishes upon his future 
endeavors and accomplishments.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
GENRE VINCENT PECORA 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Genre Vincent 
Pecora who sadly passed away in his North 
Huntingdon, Pennsylvania home on August 
30, 2020. I knew Vince personally and can at-
test that his devotion to family, community, 
and country was evident to everyone who met 
him. 
Vince was the proud owner of Pecora Floor-
ing Inc., a southwestern Pennsylvania com-
pany specializing in institutional and industrial 
installation for over fifty years. Throughout that 
time, Vince earned the respect and trust of his 
community through his tenacity, workmanship, 
and approachability. 
Outside of work, Vince was committed to 
helping kids with cancer after his grandson 
was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia. After watching one of their own go 
through treatment and ultimately achieve re-
mission, the Pecora family started Genre’s 
Kids with Cancer Fund to support others in 
similar situations. From entertainment systems 
to go-bags packed with essentials, Genre’s 
Kids with Cancer Fund anticipates the needs 
of families confronted with the horror of a 
childhood cancer diagnosis. 
Vince is survived by his wife of 56 years, 
Donna Day Pecora; children, Daunette Baker 
and her husband, John, Vincent Pecora and 
his wife, Brenda, Dante Pecora and his wife, 
Carla, and Todd Hook and his wife, Julie; sis-
ter, Antoinette Capo; grandchildren, Kaitlynn 
(Ricky) Boyer, James Baker, Genre Baker, 
Vincent Pecora, Gianna Baker, Avery Pecora 
and Ava Pecora; and great-grandchildren, Gid-
eon Boyer, Eden Boyer, Lacey Hook and 
Cameron Hook. 
Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness 
that I recognize the loss of Genre Vincent 
Pecora. Vince will be remembered as a friend 
to many and his legacy will live on in south-
western Pennsylvania.

RECOGNIZING THE UKRAINIAN 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CHICAGO 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum 
of Chicago (UNM), a cultural landmark in the 
heart of my district, on the occasion of its an-
nual banquet. The UNM prides itself, for good 
reason, on its museum artifacts, library, and 
archives, which highlight Ukraine’s history, its 
ongoing fight for freedom and democracy, and 
the rich culture and contributions made by 
Ukrainian 
Americans 
and 
Americans 
of 
Ukrainian heritage, both to Chicago’s cultural 
tapestry and to that of the United States. 
Each one of the four waves of immigration 
from Ukraine, as well as the generations of 
American Ukrainians who have followed, have 
brought with it a wealth of literary, music, artis-
tic, 
and 
cultural 
artifacts, 
historical 
testimonials, relics, scientific patents, personal 
keepsakes and reminders, all of which speak 
to the importance of Ukrainian heritage and 
the personal and professional accomplish-
ments of American Ukrainians across our 
country. 
Themselves a part of the third wave of 
Ukrainian immigrants to the United States, 
Olexa Hankewych, Julian Kamenetsky and 
Orest Horodysky, founded the Ukrainian Li-

preserve books and other documents at risk of 
destruction in Ukraine. Shortly after the estab-
lishment of the Library and Archival Center, a 
call went out to the Ukrainian community, 
which 
enthusiastically 
responded. 
Several 
years later the Library and Archival Center 
grew into the Ukrainian National Museum of 
Chicago, fully funded by community donations. 
While some artifacts in the Museum’s bur-
geoning collection were purchased in Ukraine, 
others were donated by Ukrainian American 
collectors and artists, as well as from personal 
libraries and individuals throughout the com-
munity, in Chicago and beyond. Over 100,000 
Ukrainian Americans live in Chicago, and I am 
proud that the Museum has its roots in our 
great city. 
The Ukrainian National Museum of Chicago 
too has much to be proud of, due to the hard 
work of its staff, board of directors, and offi-
cers. Unfortunately, only two of its past presi-
dents remain with us—Dr. George Hrycelak 
and Jaroslaw Hankewych, son of the Muse-
um’s founder, Olexa Hankewych. Today, 
under the leadership of Lydia Tkaczuk, the 
Museum’s first female president, the UNM 
continues its work in one of Chicago’s most 
historic 
neighborhoods, 
Ukrainian 
Village. 
More than just engaging visitors and adding to 
their understanding of Chicago’s rich and di-
verse communities, it also serves as a window 
to Ukraine, its history, and its people. 
The Museum’s diverse collection of folk-art, 
fine art, tapestry, traditional dress and artifacts 
help to illuminate the societal impact American 
Ukrainians have had on Chicago and across 
the United States. Its permanent exhibitions 
educate visitors on the history, heritage, poli-
tics, culture and religions of Ukraine and the 
broader Ukrainian American community, in-
cluding 
exhibits 
on 
the 
Kozak 
period, 
Ukraine’s role in the World Wars and impor-
tantly, the Holodomor, the forced famine-geno-
cide of 10 million Ukrainians by Stalin across 
1932 and 1933. 
Madam Speaker, the Ukrainian National Mu-
seum is a place where visitors feel welcomed 
and engaged. It serves as a pillar of knowl-
edge and culture for the Ukrainian community, 
for individuals of every background who call 
our city home, and for all the universities and 
students, artists, and authors throughout the 
world who have benefited from work in its ar-
chives. The City of Chicago is lucky to house 
such an institution, and it is my privilege today 
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum 
here in Congress.

REMEMBERING FATHER NICHOLAS 
VIERON 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Father Nicholas Vieron, the much 
admired retired pastor of Annunciation Greek 
Orthodox Church in Memphis, who passed 
away Tuesday morning at the age of 94. Fa-
ther Vieron was a revered ecumenical leader 
in Memphis, serving as Chairman of the Mem-
phis Ministerial Association at the time of the 
1968 Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike and 
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
With Rabbi James Wax, the Reverend Frank 
McRae, Dean William Dimmick and other reli-
gious leaders, Father Vieron confronted Mayor 
Henry Loeb the day after the assassination, 
which helped bring the strike to an end and 
helped bind Memphis together during that time 
of crisis for our city. A native of New Orleans 
and the son of Greek immigrants, he grew up 
across the street from America’s first Greek 
Orthodox Church. Father Vieron came to 
Memphis to become pastor of Annunciation 
Church in 1955 after attending seminary in 
Brookline, Massachusetts, and served as a 
priest in Louisville, Kentucky, and Huntington, 
West Virginia. In Huntington, he received a 
master’s degree from Marshall College. In 
Memphis, he received a J.D. from the Univer-
sity of Memphis School of Law in 1970. He re-
tired from Annunciation in 1991 but stayed 
busy. For decades, Father Vieron taught a 15- 
week course in the Greek language to all 
comers, telling students that there would be 
no tests but that they were required to endure 
his corny jokes. My favorite: There are three 
stages in life—young, middle aged, and 
‘‘you’re looking good.’’ For 40 years, he 
served as chaplain to the Memphis Touch-
down Club. He also served as editor of The 
Epistle, a newsletter for retired Orthodox 
priests. In 2015, he received the MLK Legacy 
Award from the National Civil Rights Museum. 
His wife of 69 years, Bess, passed in 2017. I 
want to express my condolences to his sons, 
Leonidas and Paul, his four grandchildren and 
five great-grandchildren, the entire Annun-
ciation Greek Orthodox community, and his 
many friends and admirers. Father Vieron led 
an exceptional life of service and he will not 
be forgotten.

COMMENDING WESLEY YUEN FOR 
HIS HELP FINDING SOLUTIONS 
FOR SPACECRAFT SANITIZATION 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend Wesley Yuen, a junior at 
Clements High School from my hometown of 
Sugar Land, who has helped us combat the 
spread of COVID–19 in space. 
This summer, Wesley was selected to at-
tend NASA’s Student Enhancement in Earth 
and Space Science internship for two months 
at the University of Texas, Austin. He was one 
of around 60 high school students selected 
from a pool of 600 applicants. Wesley and his 
team successfully researched how to stop the 
spread of coronavirus between astronauts 
going between Earth and the ISS using the 
few materials they have. This valuable work 
will help set the rules for safe space explo-
ration for decades to come. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas and America, I thank 
Wesley for his hard work. He has a bright fu-
ture ahead, and I wish him the best of luck in 
his future endeavors. 
HONORING DAVID KENT 
FRUECHTENICHT 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize David Kent 
Fruechtenicht. David is a very special hus-
band, father, and leader who is proudly retiring 
from a career of service to this country. 
David Fruechtenicht has dedicated over 41 
years to protect this nation. After joining the 
Air Force in 1980, David quickly realized that 
he enjoyed serving his country, as he says he 
just kept reenlisting and next thing he knew 20 
years had flown by. After leaving active duty, 
David used his expertise with Electronic Intel-
ligence to move over into DOD defense con-
tract work but still found his way back to the 
Air Force by April of 2007. Whether it be ac-
tive duty, consultant, or Air Force Civilian, 
David has continuously found a way to serve 
his nation. As David says he wouldn’t change 
anything that he has done and ultimately that 
shows the true love and pride that David has 
for this country and I wish him well in retire-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing David Fruechtenicht on his 
retirement and for his years serving our na-
tion. l am honored to represent him in the 
United States Congress.

AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS OF 
A MORE PRODUCTIVE EMERGING 
TECH ECONOMY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the American COMPETE Act. This 
package of bills includes two of my own—the 
SMART IoT Act and the Advancing Unmanned 
Delivery Services Act. 
The SMART IoT Act would encourage the 
development of future Internet of Things poli-
cies that will promote innovation and help 
these technologies grow to further benefit con-
sumers and businesses alike. It is crucial we 
have the right federal policies in place to bol-
ster 
this 
industry 
that 
has 
dramatically 
changed the way we live, manufacture goods, 
farm, and even receive health care through 
internet-connected devices. 
I also introduced the Advancing Unmanned 
Delivery Services Act with my friend from 
Michigan, Mrs. Dingell. This legislation would 
evaluate the many benefits contactless deliv-
ery has for various sectors of our country and 
help identify potential regulatory roadblocks to 
the use of their services. This technology is 
especially important today as Americans de-
pend on home delivery services to remain so-
cially distant to mitigate the spread of the 
coronavirus. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in support of 
the American COMPETE Act to ensure the 
United States remains a global leader in inno-
vation.

100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
ALPHA PHI ALPHA FRATERNITY, 
INCORPORATED-ETA 
LAMBDA 
CHAPTER 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Alpha 
Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated-Eta Lambda 
Chapter, on their 100th Anniversary. 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., the first 
inter-collegiate Greek letter fraternity estab-
lished for Black college students, was founded 
at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 
1906. In a period of one hundred fourteen 
years, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. grew 
from one undergraduate group of seven mem-
bers to an international organization with an 
active membership of more than one hundred 
fifty thousand. The national organization is 
now the central organization to many subordi-
nate chapters. 
The Eta Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi 
Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was founded in Atlanta, 
chartering on May 19, 1920. As the First 
Alumni Chapter, and one of the most accom-
plished in the Southern Region (Georgia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ten-
nessee, Alabama, and Mississippi) I am hon-
ored to highlight the rich history and signifi-
cance of my beloved fraternity in Atlanta. 
For one hundred years, the Eta Lambda 
Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has 
been intertwined in the fabric of the City of At-
lanta; from Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport to Andrew Young International Boule-
vard and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center, 
just to name a few. Notable Alpha Brothers 
have served as leaders in all levels of govern-
ment, business, education, and civic affairs. 
I am a proud member of this prestigious or-
ganization, which was founded on the pre-
cepts of many deeds, scholarship, and love for 
all mankind. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the historic significance of the centen-
nial anniversary of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 
Incorporated-Eta Lambda Chapter.

THE EASTSIDE GIRLS 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer a tribute to 15 remarkable 
women who through their 65 year relation-
ships with each other is a story itself; but, I 
believe, might also offer a way to carry many 
of us through this tumultuous time of eco-
nomic upheaval, tragic illness and death, and 
riots in our streets where we have lived 
peacefully all these years. 
Their belief in each other has allowed them 
to love and share tragedies and disappoint-
ments. Their lifetime of friendships and memo-
ries help them to remember to laugh and 
make time together. 
Melany Burton Davis remembers what she 
recalls as one of the scariest days of her life 
at age 10, when she had to go to a new ele-
mentary school. ‘‘Little did I know that the pre-
cious girls I met that day were going to be life-
long friends. Each of them made me feel not 
just accepted but valued and loved.’’ 
She goes on to say, ‘‘Even when we all 
went our separate ways for decades, when-
ever we got together I had the same feelings 
of being valued and loved. These beautiful 
girls always bring joy to my heart, and I am 
blessed to have them in my life.’’ 
They are often asked, ‘‘How do they do 
that?’’ 
Jackie Nantz Kelly, one of the women, an-
swered, ‘‘Where to start? How do you de-
scribe a 70-year friendship? 
We started in two different elementary 
schools that merged into the same junior high 
school where it all began. We grew closer in 
high school, but went our separate ways in 
college. We married, had children, some di-
vorced and had struggles of single parent 
hood, but we survived and all of us raised 
beautiful children. We are all not the same re-
ligion, but believe in God and we love our 
country’’ 
In 1987, 26 years after we graduated high 
school, we decided it was time for a reunion. 
We remembered our best times were slumber 
parties so that’s what we did, Dana Gant Tate 
sent the invitation and commanded for all of 
us, ‘‘Sleeping bags, pillows and baby doll pa-
jamas or you don’t come!’’ 
We had a great time and decided we had to 
do a better job of keeping in touch, and we 
did. 
We began to travel. 
Tricia Walker Christensen was our historian 
forth is outing and in her words, ‘‘In 2010 we 
had a great opportunity to celebrate and travel 
when we joined 60 passengers to birth the 
USS Fort Worth at Mariette Marine Corpora-
tion. One of our Eastside Girls was KAY 
MULLENDORE GRANGER and she was the spon-
sor of the ship. We watched as she stood with 
her grandsons and smashed a bottle of cham-
pagne against the bow of the ship. We were 
proud and excited. We were also holding our 
breath hoping that the hit would be successful. 
KAY was never athletic, so it wasn’t a sure 
thing she could do this.’’ 
We gathered together for parties and get 
togethers that others hosted and at some 
point someone suggested we needed a name. 
Many of us still lived in the part of Fort Worth 
where we had all that fun, so we named our-
selves ‘‘The Eastside Girls’’ for the area we 
grew up in and that is the name we have used 
for 23 years. 
The slumber parties were a thing of the past 
until 2001 when Key Stevens Richardson in-
vited us to her house in Austin. As Key puts 
it, ‘‘After years apart and attempts to get to-
gether, we began the tradition of reuniting for 
an annual memorable weekend a tour house. 
Hank, my husband and an Eastside guy, 
leaves town and our raucous group takes over 
the house. We all talk at once. There is laugh-
ter (someone suggested we should be called 
the ‘The Eastside Cacklers’) and there are 
tears.’’ 
Key’s little sister Nancy Stevens Klein is the 
only one allowed outside our class and she 
adds. ‘‘I’m honored to be included in this won-
derful group of women who support and in-
spire each other and in doing so make each 
one of us stronger. I wouldn’t miss seeing 
them every year for anything.’’ 
Laughter is the most important part of this 
long friendship. Talana Hadsell Wier says, 
‘‘My very best memories are of the laughter 
we always shared with whatever we did. Slid-
ing down the stairs at Melany’s house, pep 
rallies at Eastern Hills High School, talking 
about our boyfriends. And now making it 
through the good and tough times of mar-
riages and raising families. And then being 
able to once again come back to our fun times 
of memories together.’’ 
Jaynie Lewis Shaffer says, ‘‘We are each 
unique and different yet the same because of 
our shared heritage. It is wonderful to be with 
people who knew me then. I don’t have to ex-
plain anything to them. Like a beautiful grand 
piano with individuals key that emit a beautiful 
tone and perhaps at times may need fine tun-
ing, we make lovely music and come to-
gether.’’ Jaynie spent 30 years at IBM to pre-
pare herself for the most important job—tech-
nical support for the Eastside Girls. 
Priscilla Willis Coleman was the cutest, 
most popular and funniest of the ‘‘Girls.’’ She 
never misses the August Austin slumber party 
and is the most talkative and gets funnier 
every year. She added that it is important 
where we have that Austin soiree. ‘‘It is in the 
hills of Austin so we don’t disturb anyone, and 
believe me, a group of women who haven’t 
been together all year, all talking at the same 
time, accompanied by a few margaritas and 
glasses of wine—this can become quite loud.’’ 
During the year we keep in touch by phone. 
And we text. And Priscilla says she imagines 
we will continue until we can’t drive anymore 
and we will take an Uber or a van. But she 
continues, ‘‘I really love these women. We 
would do anything in our power to help each 
other. We are happy together, sad together, 
and we pray for each other. We share a com-
mon bond that knits out lives together. 
We are all in our 70’s now, but we will al-
ways be the Eastside Girls.’’

War. After his service, he worked as a truck 
driver and did maintenance for housing in 
Sault Sainte Marie. Virgil was a member of the 
Holy Name of Jesus church, the Keweenaw 
Bay Indian Community, former president of 
Ojibwa Seniors, and past commander of KBIC 
Veterans. His joys in life included fishing, 
watching football, enjoying the outdoors, KBIC 
Community Pow Wows, and serving those in 
his community through Veterans organizations 
and Toys for Tots. 
Virgil passed away on September 25, 2020. 
He is missed dearly by his family and friends, 
and his legacy will undoubtedly live on for 
generations for come. Virgil’s tireless devotion 
to the public good touched the lives of count-
less Michiganders, and the impact of his life 
cannot be overstated. Visitation for Virgil will 
be held on October 1, and his funeral service 
will be held thereafter with traditional service 
with drums, committal prayers, and Baraga 
County Area Veterans providing military rites. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Virgil Simon 
Loonsfoot ‘‘Red Cloud’’. His legacy will forever 
live on in his family and through the countless 
lives he bettered through his life and service.

HONORING DYLAN MONTGOMERY 
EVANS 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Dylan Mont-
gomery Evans. Dylan is a very special young 
man who has exemplified the finest qualities 
of citizenship and leadership by taking an ac-
tive part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 
115, and earning the most prestigious award 
of Eagle Scout. 
Dylan has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Dylan has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Dylan 
has Firebuilder in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. 
Dylan has also contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Dylan con-
structed two signs that can be removed and 
replaced as needed for Wesley United Meth-
odist Church in St. Joseph, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Dylan Montgomery Evans 
for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts 
of America and for his efforts put forth in 
achieving the highest distinction of Eagle 
Scout.

SUPREME COURT REPLACEMENT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last week, South Carolina Attorney 
General Alan Wilson who, when first elected in 
2010, was America’s youngest Attorney Gen-
eral, explained to Newsmax with John Gizzi, 
‘‘The Case for Moving the Supreme Court 
Confirmation.’’ 
‘‘Since the passing of United States Su-
preme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, Democrats and members of the 
mainstream media have accused President 
Donald Trump and Senate Republicans of hy-
pocrisy and unfairness. 
‘‘First, let’s look at the constitutional per-
spective. In the case of nominating and con-
firming a United States Supreme Court jus-
tice, the rules are simple. Article II, Section 
2 of the United States Constitution says that 
the president ‘. . . shall nominate, and by 
and with the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme 
Court.’ 
‘‘A president has not just the right but a 
duty to appoint a person to the Supreme 
Court so long as that appointment is accom-
panied with the advice and consent of the 
Senate. 
‘‘Second, as to the historical perspective, 
these actions are neither shocking nor un-
precedented. As Dan McLaughlin of the Na-
tional Review, Sen. Ted Cruz, R–Texas, and 
others have pointed out, there have been 44 
presidents, and 22 of them have had 29 vacan-
cies to fill in their last year in office. 
‘‘Regardless of how you feel politically 
about filling this vacancy, history and the 
Constitution support Trump and the Repub-
lican Senate. The Senate needs to move for-
ward and fill this seat now.’’ 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

HONORING HYDROCEPHALUS 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
each year in September, designated as Hydro-
cephalus Awareness Month, hydrocephalus 
patients, caregivers, and other supporters 
across the country work together to raise 
awareness of the impact and prevalence of 
hydrocephalus and urge public and medical 
officials to garner more resources to improve 
treatment protocols and one day find a cure. 
As we all know, COVID–19 and its inherent 
social distancing requirements have limited 
many public awareness activities, but this past 
month members of the Hydrocephalus Asso-
ciation and the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foun-
dation, and other active supporters, adjusted 
and relied on social media and other venues 
to share statistics, brochures and personal 
stories to enhance awareness of this condi-
tion. 
As the co-chair of the Congressional Pedi-
atric and Adult Hydrocephalus Caucus, I call 
on all my colleagues in the House to take the 
time and learn more about hydrocephalus so 
we can better assist our constituents and their 
family members who live with challenges of 
hydrocephalus every day. 
Hydrocephalus is colloquially known as 
‘‘water on the brain.’’ In truth, the condition is 
caused by an abnormal build-up of cerebro-
spinal fluid and can be treated only by sur-
gically implanting a drainage shunt in the 
brain. Everyone, from babies to the elderly, 
can develop hydrocephalus. While some 
cases are congenital, many cases are caused 
by a traumatic brain injury, an infection, or 
even just develop as part of the aging proc-
ess. 
Hospitals across the country work to serve 
the 
over 
one-million 
adults 
with 
hydro-
cephalus, including the New Neurons Neuro-
surgery Institute (NNNI), located in my district 
in Spring Lake, New Jersey. NNNI’s pediatrics 
division plays a critical role in addressing the 
needs of thousands of children with hydro-
cephalus in New Jersey and across the coun-
try. Nationwide, over 400,000 babies a year 
are born with hydrocephalus. 
Through their compassion, skills, and critical 
expertise 
dedicated 
medical 
professionals 
such as those at NNNI save lives every day. 
United States citizens are not alone in their 
struggles with this condition. Unfortunately, the 
global situation is even worse, which is why 
I’ve introduced the Global Brain Health Act, 
which adds hydrocephalus to the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1961. This approach would en-
sure more robust foreign assistance for treat-
ing those infants and children in developing 
countries with hydrocephalus and other brain 
health-related conditions. It also fosters study 
in treatment protocols that can be shared here 
at home. 
It’s essential for Members of Congress to 
better understand this condition and its pro-
found impact on the people we represent. I 
urge my colleagues to join the bipartisan Con-
gressional Adult and Pediatric Hydrocephalus 
Caucus. As a member you will not only help 
raise awareness but may also play a role in 
creating public policies that lead to better 
treatments and hopefully a cure.
