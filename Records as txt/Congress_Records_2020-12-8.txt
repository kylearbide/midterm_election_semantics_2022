The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:

NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for

SUPPORTING THE NDAA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in a 
few hours, the House of Representa-
tives will be voting on the National De-
fense Authorization Act of 2021. 
This bill is our Nation’s annual de-
fense policy law that the U.S. Congress 
has approved every year for the last 59 
years. It establishes the legal basis for 
thousands of operations of the Depart-
ment of Defense, including military 
pay, the startup of new technologies, 
and investment in planes, ships, logis-
tics, and infrastructure at military in-
stallations at home and abroad. 
This year’s bill, like the 59 bills that 
preceded it, represents 11 months of bi-
partisan work at the House and Senate 
Armed Services Committees, whose 
members and professional staff have 
worked with the entire Congress to 
produce a bill that will strengthen our 
security, support our servicemembers, 
and boost our economy in countless 
ways. 
As House chair of the Seapower and 
Projection Forces Subcommittee, a 
body I have served on for 14 years, I 
want to spend a moment on our section 
of the bill which I believe is remark-
able. 
The Seapower and Projection Forces 
Subcommittee is vested with jurisdic-
tion of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps 
as set forth in Article I, Section 8 of 
the U.S. Constitution. Those services 
today are engaged in the highest oper-
ational tempo in our military. 
In every part of the globe, the Indo- 
Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Middle 
East, our sailors and marines are in 
heel-to-toe operations that are strain-
ing our fleet and manpower. Our chief 
competitors, China and Russia, in 
these regions have been steadily grow-
ing their naval forces in both numbers 
and quality. 
China’s navy grew to 355 ships and 
submarines this year, versus 292 in our 
fleet. Russia’s Navy continues to grow 
under Putin, particularly with the new, 
lethal Severodvinsk-class submarines. 
With this backdrop, it was quite sur-
prising when, last February, the Trump 
administration 
submitted 
a 
budget 
with the lowest number of requested 
Navy ships since 2009. As the Congres-
sional Research Service noted, the 
Trump budget asked for just seven new 
ships and, incredibly, cut one of the 
two planned Virginia-class submarines, 
a program that has successfully sus-
tained a two-per-year build rate that 
began in 2007 under the Obama admin-
istration. 
This baffling cut ignored all the 
warnings from commanders who testi-
fied at Seapower that our declining, 
aging fleet of 1980s-era submarines risk 
losing the one clear tactical advantage 
that we as a nation retain—namely, 
our superiority in the undersea do-
main. 
This chart shows the steep decline in 
the sub fleet in the 2020s, even with a 2- 
per-year build rate, and the red dotted 
line shows that the Trump plan wors-
ens that slide. 
This cut would also disrupt the 
skilled workforce that has been assem-
bled over the last decade to execute 
this highly complex production. At 
committee, administration witnesses, 
such as Secretary Esper, gave com-
pletely unsatisfactory explanations for 
this cut, leaving us in Congress with 
the job to clean up their mess. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report 
that today’s bill, in fact, does reverse 
this cut. Working with Ranking Mem-
ber ROB WITTMAN, Seapower led the 
way in restoring the second submarine 
with offsets and savings as required by 
the spending cap in the 2019 bipartisan 
budget law. 
We worked with our colleagues on 
the 
Defense 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee to ensure that this $2.6 bil-
lion change will be funded in their bill. 
And I want to thank retiring Chair 
PETE VISCLOSKY for his strong support 
of this effort, as well as HASC Chair 
ADAM SMITH and Ranking Member MAC 
THORNBERRY. 
Having the two House defense com-
mittees united on this measure ensured 
that our position would prevail in con-
ference negotiations since the Senate 
did not initially vote for full restora-
tion. 
Ironically, late last month, with Con-
gress deep in the process of negotiating 
this agreement, the Trump administra-
tion suddenly disavowed its own budget

and sent a letter to Congress asking us 
to fully fund the second submarine it 
wanted to cut just last February. 
Thankfully, the House had already 
acted responsibly to do just that ear-
lier this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to salute Admi-
ral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Op-
erations, who foot-stomped the second 
submarine as the Navy’s top unfunded 
priority this year and also wrote a 
powerful support letter to Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
that support letter. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, 
CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, 
Washington, DC, November 13, 2020. 
Hon. JOE COURTNEY, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on Seapower and Pro-
jection Forces, Committee on Armed Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington, 
DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to follow 
up on our phone call of November 12, 2020. As 
I detailed in the Navy’s February 19, 2020 Un-
funded Priorities List, the second Virginia 
Class Submarine in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 re-
mains my top unfunded priority. The FY 2021 
shipbuilding budget reflected a balance be-
tween 
requirements, 
capability, 
afford-
ability, and the need to sustain the indus-
trial base while maintaining a reasonable de-
gree of risk. 
Increased funding to enable the Navy to 
procure a second Virginia Class Submarine 
in FY 2021, the 10th under the current con-
tract of the Block V submarine build is crit-
ical for a number of important reasons: it 
supports stability within the industrial base 
and the workload ramp up for COLUMBIA 
Class construction and helps mitigate the 
SSN trough in the late 2020s. Additionally, 
recent DoD studies highlighted the need to 
increase 
the 
number 
of 
submarines 
to 
counter the threat. 
The Navy supports the President’s FY 2021 
budget request and will consider the poten-
tial for restoring the submarine in future 
budget submissions, ensuring the proper bal-
ance of resources between investing in to-
morrow’s fleet and sustaining today’s fleet. 
However, if Congress has the opportunity to 
add one ship to the FY 2021 budget, my rec-
ommendation would be an attack submarine. 
Thank you for your continued support for 
the United States Navy and its submarine 
force. Please let me know if I can be of fur-
ther assistance. 
Sincerely, 
M.M. GILDAY, 
Admiral, U.S. Navy. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, the 
U.S. Navy League and the AFL–CIO 
metal trades unions, whose members 
do such amazing work at our Nation’s 
shipyards, also provided critical advo-
cacy throughout this fight. 
Seapower’s professional staff Phil 
MacNaughton, Dave Sienicki, Kelly 
Goggin, and Navy fellow Lieutenant 
Commander Cam Massey rose to the 
challenge and did the hard work to 
make this plus-up fit within the overall 
bill. 
In my 14 years on Seapower, this act 
of bipartisan congressional independ-
ence and leadership to pass a ship-
building plan that faithfully addresses 
our Navy’s needs stands out as its fin-
est hour. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the NDAA today. 
EN MASSE VOTING BY MAIL IS 
ILLEGAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is my fifth speech in a series on 
voter fraud, election theft, and the 
Presidential election. 
For emphasis, Congress is the judge, 
jury, and final arbiter of the 2020 Presi-
dential 
election 
contest. 
Further, 
America’s election system is plagued 
by systemic flaws that promote voter 
fraud and election theft. 
Joe Biden exploited one such flaw 
when he brazenly promised more than 
10 million illegal aliens that he will 
give them amnesty and citizenship if 
they help elect Joe Biden President. 
The Constitution’s Election Clause, 
Article I, Section 4, is very clear. Con-
gress has absolute authority over the 
‘‘times, places, and manner of holding 
elections’’ for Federal offices. 
Pursuant to the Election Clause, and 
title 2, United States Code, section 7, 
Congress set November 3 as the 2020 
‘‘day for the election.’’ 
For emphasis, Congress set a ‘‘day 
for the election’’ on which citizens 
vote. Congress did not set an election 
week, an election month, or an election 
season during which citizens can cast 
votes. Also, pursuant to the Election 
Clause, Congress created limited excep-
tions to its ‘‘vote within a 24-hour win-
dow’’ mandate, to wit: 
Alternative voting means for persons 
with disabilities; 
Overseas persons may vote by absen-
tee ballot; 
Persons to be absent from their vot-
ing location or State on election day 
may vote by absentee ballot. 
Any voting schemes that allow vot-
ing outside of congressionally man-
dated times and means are illegal 
under the Constitution and Federal 
statute. 
Congress’ reasons for limiting voting 
to one 24-hour period are described by 
the 2005 bipartisan Commission on Fed-
eral Election Reform, co-chaired by 
Democrat President Jimmy Carter and 
former Republican White House Chief 
of Staff and Secretary of State James 
Baker. 
They 
strongly 
cautioned 
against overly broad absentee ballot 
and vote-by-mail schemes because they 
‘‘increase the risk of fraud.’’ 
The bipartisan commission found 
that absentee voting has been one of 
the major sources of fraud in American 
elections and that vote by mail ‘‘is vul-
nerable to abuse in several ways: Blank 
ballots mailed to the wrong address or 
to large residential buildings might get 
intercepted. Citizens who vote at home, 
at nursing homes, at the workplace, or 
in church are more susceptible to pres-
sure, overt and subtle, or to intimida-
tion. Vote-buying schemes are far more 
difficult to detect when citizens vote 
by mail.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Congress passed laws to 
prevent voter fraud and election theft 
by establishing, with minor exceptions, 
a 24-hour window in which to vote. In 
contrast, socialist Democrats use bu-
reaucratic allies or engaged in rigged 
lawsuits involving conspiratorial par-
ties and inattentive judges to obtain 
sham settlement agreements that bla-
tantly violate the Constitution and 
Federal law to promote voter fraud and 
election theft with the singular goal of 
stealing the United States Presidency. 
In particular, all en masse vote-by- 
mail schemes promote voter fraud and 
election theft and are illegal because 
they violate Congress’ election proce-
dures and 24-hour voting mandate. 
As such, all votes cast pursuant to 
these vote-by-mail schemes are illegal, 
void, and should not be counted. 
Mr. Speaker, the evidence is over-
whelming, compelling, and irrefutable. 
If only lawful votes cast by eligible 
American citizens are counted, Presi-
dent Trump won the electoral college 
and a second term as President. Con-
gress can either support illegal voting, 
voter fraud, and election theft or not. 
Because I believe in the rule of law 
and our Republic, it is my duty as a 
Member of Congress to, on January 6, 
object to and vote to reject the elec-
toral college submissions of all States 
whose election systems are so badly 
flawed as to render their vote submis-
sions unreliable, untrustworthy, and 
unworthy of acceptance. 
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I 
intend to do.

RECOGNIZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
OF BRIAN JOHNSON, FOUNDER 
OF WARRIORNOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Mr. Brian Johnson of Au-
rora, Colorado, founder of the nonprofit 
organization, WarriorNOW. Brian is an 
Army veteran who served in Iraq and 
personally grappled with suicide after 
leaving the service. 
He founded the nonprofit organiza-
tion, WarriorNOW, to help veterans get 
through the same struggles that he 
faced after coming home. His approach 
to combating veteran suicide is to con-
nect at-risk veterans with peer men-
tors. Brian has developed a mentor cer-
tification program to ensure that every 
veteran receives quality mentorship 
and to ensure that the mentors are sup-
ported as well. 
In the wake of COVID–19, Brian saw 
how the pandemic led to worsening 
PTSD anxiety, depression, and sub-
stance abuse throughout the entire 
veteran community. As a result, he 
created Daniel’s Room, a virtual night-
ly check-in that began with Daniel, a 
veteran who Brian was working with 
who was struggling with substance 
abuse. 
Thus far, WarriorNOW has served 
over 800 veterans in Daniel’s Room. 
I would like to thank Brian Johnson 
and his organization, WarriorNOW, for

their tireless support of Colorado’s vet-
erans. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MIKAELA LAKIN 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mikaela Lakin, an Aurora 
Police Department officer who lost her 
life in an off-duty motorcycle accident 
on September 18, 2020. 
Mikaela was a dedicated officer with 
the Aurora Police Department when 
she died at the age of 24. A proud Colo-
radan, Mikaela loved all the outdoor 
activities our State has to offer, in-
cluding 
camping, 
hiking, 
and 
snowboarding. 
She will be deeply missed by her 
mother, Stephanie Renken; her broth-
er, Alexander Lakin; her father, Mi-
chael Lakin; her grandparents, Connie 
and Steve Ostroha; and her beloved 
dog, Quentin. 
She impacted the lives of so many 
with her outgoing and welcoming spirit 
and positive outlook. Officer Lakin 
should be remembered for her commit-
ment to those in need and for the un-
wavering support she provided to her 
friends, family, and community. 
May she rest in peace. 
HONORING NATURAL HELPERS 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the accom-
plishments of the Aurora Natural Help-
ers program and its steadfast commit-
ment to the community. 
Aurora 
is 
an 
increasingly inter-
national and diverse city in Colorado’s 
Sixth District. With the creation of the 
Office of International and Immigrant 
Affairs and the launching of the second 
phase of their Immigrant Integration 
Plan, Aurora is quickly becoming a na-
tional leader in the field of immigrant 
integration. 
Launched by the city of Aurora in 
collaboration with local nonprofits in 
2016, the Aurora Natural Helpers pro-
gram trains leaders from immigrant 
refugee communities so they can help 
integrate their community members. 
Trained Natural Helpers are equipped 
to provide information and resources 
to newly arriving immigrants and refu-
gees on topics including city services 
and private assistance. 
With the support of local partner or-
ganizations, more than 150 people from 
25 countries have been trained, and 
crucial immigrant and refugee leader-
ship has been fostered and empowered. 
I would like to thank all of those in-
volved in the Aurora Natural Helpers 
program for their dedication to our 
community. Their hard work con-
necting communities in Aurora to cru-
cial resources not only ensures that 
immigrants and refugees in the Sixth 
District have the opportunity to thrive 
but that their leadership also comes 
from within.

RECOGNIZING TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the Tri-Coun-
ty Health Department as a recipient of 
the National Association of County and 
City Health Officials 2020 Model Prac-
tice Award. The Tri-County Health De-
partment serves the three counties in 
my district: Adams, Arapahoe, and 
Douglas. 
As we work to address the COVID–19 
crisis, this recognition is a reminder of 
the many ongoing public health initia-
tives led by our city and county health 
departments, achievements they make 
despite challenging and adverse condi-
tions. This award recognizes programs 
demonstrating excellence in response 
to a critical local public health need. 
As part of this year’s public health 
award series, Tri-County Health De-
partment received one Model Practice 
Award and two Promising Practice 
Awards. The Model Practice Award was 
awarded to Tri-County’s project on 
partnering with local businesses on 
workplace health and well-being. 
I would like to thank the profes-
sionals of Tri-County Health Depart-
ment for their many contributions to 
public health. Both before and during 
the pandemic, their programs and serv-
ices have been instrumental in pro-
tecting the public health and well- 
being of our community. 
f 
PENNSYLVANIA’S DRUG CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address a pub-
lic health crisis that is taking a tan-
gible toll on every facet of our society. 
In Pennsylvania, drug abuse and ad-
diction are not abstract concerns. The 
drug crisis is a reality that plays out 
across our community every single 
day. Sadly, Pennsylvanians are not 
alone. Each day, more than 130 Ameri-
cans die from an overdose. 
As a nation, we cannot allow illicit 
drugs to continue tearing apart fami-
lies, destroying our workforce, and 
claiming lives. From law enforcement 
officials to healthcare providers to edu-
cators to community leaders and law-
makers, all of us have an individual 
part to play. We must combat this cri-
sis, keep drugs off our streets, protect 
families, safeguard our economy, and, 
most importantly, save lives. 
Ending this scourge requires a team 
effort. In Congress, it has been my 
privilege to work with leaders at the 
Federal, State, and local levels to iden-
tify and implement commonsense solu-
tions for the drug crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, today I thank my fellow 
members of the freshman Bipartisan 
Working Group on Addiction for their 
collaboration and partnership during 
the 
116th 
Congress. 
Together 
we 
worked toward our shared fight against 
drug abuse and addiction. I am proud of 
the legislative achievements that we 
forged, and I am looking forward to 
continuing this work in the upcoming 
117th Congress. 
In the White House, President Donald 
Trump and his administration are in-
credible leaders in this fight. From day 
one, President Trump prioritized real-
istic and achievable solutions to tackle 
this problem, equip those on the front 
lines, and support Americans in recov-
ery. 
I am grateful to President Trump’s 
drug czar, White House Office of Na-
tional Drug Control Policy Director 
James Carroll, for his steadfast com-
mitment to this issue. This fall, it was 
an honor to host Director Carroll in 
my district to meet directly with re-
markable leaders on the front lines of 
the drug crisis. He is a true partner for 
Pennsylvanians, and I am thankful for 
Director Carroll’s service in this key 
role. 
As a nation, Americans have made 
significant strides in defeating the 
drug crisis, and now, today, our work 
must continue. 
On the China Task Force we recog-
nize that the COVID–19 pandemic is not 
the only public health crisis that was 
created by the Chinese Communist 
Party. All too often illicit drugs origi-
nating in China end up on the streets 
in Pennsylvania, spurring addiction, 
harming families, and killing too many 
of my patients, my friends, and my 
neighbors. These drugs are trafficked 
through 
porous 
borders, 
and 
even 
through the U.S. Postal Service. 
As a direct solution to this problem, 
I have cosponsored legislation to hold 
the Chinese Communist regime—and 
any 
other 
foreign 
government—ac-
countable if the government fails to 
stop deadly drugs from leaving their 
borders, and I will continue to push 
forward with commonsense legislation. 
Tragically, the drug crisis has been 
exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic 
and aggressive mitigation tactics in 
Pennsylvania and around the country. 
As we Americans battle this pandemic, 
we must not ignore rising rates of ad-
diction and overdoses. I continue to 
call on Federal and State leaders to en-
sure that individuals and families fac-
ing addiction and those in recovery 
have the resources and support that 
they need, whether virtual or in per-
son. 
We cannot afford inaction. The rami-
fications of the drug crisis transcend 
all divides. Together—not as Repub-
licans or Democrats, but together as 
Americans—we are in a shared fight to 
save lives, and together we must win.

FAREWELL ADDRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CISNEROS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
stand here humbled and honored to 
have had the opportunity to serve the 
people of California’s 39th District in 
the 116th Congress. 
When I was 18, I wanted to serve my 
country, so I joined the United States 
Navy, and that is what I have done for 
most of my adult life: I have served to 
help both my country and others. 
As a Representative of the 39th Dis-
trict, I am proud of the high level of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

December 8, 2020 
engagement, accessibility, and visi-
bility I have had with my constituents. 
I was able to bring back over $367 mil-
lion to the district for our schools, job 
creation programs, fire departments, 
resources to combat homelessness, and 
COVID–19 relief. 
Our district office recovered over 
$550,000 for constituents through case-
work and helped 419 constituents re-
solve their Federal issues, from Social 
Security to Medicare benefits to immi-
gration casework and Veterans Affairs 
healthcare. We have responded to over 
119,000 constituent letters and partici-
pated in over 250 community events. I 
hosted 30 townhalls over the past 2 
years. 
At the start of this pandemic, my 
team swiftly changed their operations 
to respond to every concern and ques-
tion that came through, working tire-
lessly day and night to help the 39th 
District get through this pandemic. 
Their commitment and dedication to 
public service knows no limit. We 
raised the bar significantly and set the 
standard of what representation should 
look like for the 39th District. We de-
livered, because anything less would 
have been unacceptable. 
From California to Washington, D.C., 
I listened to constituents, worked 
across the aisle, and turned problems 
into legislative action. I voted to pro-
tect the Affordable Care Act, preserve 
protections for preexisting conditions, 
and lower the price of prescription drug 
costs. 
I also helped secure House passage of 
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks bill, to bring us closer to end-
ing this gun violence epidemic and 
keeping our communities safe. For the 
first time in over 25 years, the CDC re-
ceived funding to research gun safety, 
a significant step for our country. 
As a Navy veteran and member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have 
worked across party lines to improve 
access to benefits for our veterans. We 
got the blue water Navy bill passed and 
signed into law to help our veterans, 
like my father, who was exposed to 
Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. 
Just recently, my bipartisan bill to 
prevent veteran suicide and substance 
use problems was signed into law with-
in a larger landmark veterans’ mental 
healthcare bill. 
I am proud of the work I was able to 
do on the Armed Services Committee 
to protect our servicemembers and 
their families. I am proud of the work 
I have done to diversify our officer 
corps, protect military children from 
child abuse, and fight sexual harass-
ment and assault in our military. 
In the House, we have also passed 
legislation to protect our Dreamers, 
lift the SALT cap, support small busi-
nesses, and strengthen voting rights, 
which is what the American people 
want. But the work must continue to 
help those things become law. 
There is so much more that needs to 
be done. It has become abundantly 
clear that partisan gridlock is pre-
venting Congress and the Federal Gov-
ernment from doing its job. 
What I am most proud of is when this 
House came together to get things 
done for the American people. We came 
together to pass great bipartisan legis-
lation like the blue water Navy bill. At 
the beginning of this pandemic, we 
came together as a House, a Congress, 
and as a government to pass legislation 
that was beneficial to the American 
people and businesses. That type of col-
laboration is what the American people 
want to see, and it is what they should 
expect. 
We are still in the middle of this pan-
demic, and families, workers, and busi-
nesses are being left behind, and this 
legislative body must come together 
again to prevent that from happening. 
In the end, we must remember and 
never forget that we are here to serve 
the American people. 
As I conclude, I just want to take 
this opportunity to say thank you. No 
one ever does anything alone, so I want 
to thank my wife, Jacki, and my boys, 
Alexander and Christopher, for their 
love and support. 
I want to thank my staff in D.C. and 
in the district. I can’t tell you how 
many times I was told by so many peo-
ple how responsive and wonderful they 
all were to work with. 
From the bottom of my heart, I want 
to thank the people of the 39th District 
for allowing me to serve as their Rep-
resentative. 
Those who know me know that I am 
a big baseball fan and a big Dodger fan. 
One of my favorite baseball players, 
the legendary Jackie Robinson, once 
said: ‘‘A life is not important except in 
the impact it has on other lives.’’ 
I do not know what the future holds 
for me, but I can assure you this, Mr. 
Speaker: I will continue to work to 
have a positive impact on others’ lives 
for both my community and my coun-
try.

POSTMASTER ROBERT BROWN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in support of S. 4684, the 
House version of which will be coming 
to the floor today to honor former 
Thermopolis, 
Wyoming, 
Postmaster 
Robert Brown. We will be renaming the 
U.S. 
Post 
Office 
located 
at 
440 
Arapahoe Street in Thermopolis as the 
Robert L. Brown Post Office. 
Bob Brown’s career with the Postal 
Service spanned 44 years, including 18 
years as the postmaster. Brown and his 
wife, Jerry, who was Senator MIKE 
ENZI’s first Sunday school teacher, are 
also the parents of Senator JOHN BAR-
RASSO’s wife, Bobbi. 
After graduating from Thermopolis 
High School, Brown was inducted into 
the Army in 1944 and served in both the 
European and Pacific theaters. In 1950, 
when he was in the National Guard, 
Brown deployed to Korea, where he was 
a member of the 300th Armored Field 
Artillery Battalion. Along with a unit 
citation, he received a combat infantry 
badge and the Purple Heart. 
After his service, Bob returned to 
Thermopolis and began working at the 
post office. Decades of service to his 
community, to his State, and to his 
country mean that it is absolutely fit-
ting that the Thermopolis Post Office 
should bear Bob’s name, and I am 
proud to sponsor this legislation.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE BIRTHDAY 
OF J. T. JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge the belated birthday of 
my uncle, civil rights organizer J. T. 
Johnson. He served in civil rights. He 
was one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
lieutenants, hailed from Albany, Geor-
gia, 
and 
integrated 
St. 
Augustine 
swimming pool accommodations. In 
fact, he had acid poured on him in the 
swimming pool. 
So we are thankful for you, Uncle 
J.T. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge 
the birthday today of my brother, 
Colby Hall. 
COVID–19 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the public health pandemic 
that ravages our Nation. 
As COVID–19 cases and deaths con-
tinue to rise, I believe that our country 
is at an inflection point in which our 
actions and ability to provide relief to 
struggling Americans will define our 
commitment to the American people 
for generations to come. 
As the Member of Congress tasked 
with looking after the seat that the 
late Representative John Lewis held 
for over 33 years, I know that he would 
want me to speak up and speak loudly 
about the need for Congress to pass a 
comprehensive stimulus bill in re-
sponse to this unprecedented pandemic. 
Having survived COVID–19 myself 
after dealing with it for over 3 weeks 
this summer, I am committed to doing 
everything I can to ensure that we 
crush this virus and provide for the 
American people. 
Like John Lewis once said: ‘‘Govern-
ments and corporations do not live. 
They have no power, no capacity in and 
of themselves. They are given life and 
derive all their authority from their 
ability to assist, benefit, and transform 
the lives of the people they touch.’’ 
As the struggle mounts for the people 
in Georgia’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict, it is clear to me that the Con-
gress of the United States must act, 
and act swiftly. The latest report 
shows that, by the end of this year, 
without additional relief from the Fed-
eral Government, one in six Americans 
will go hungry, 20 million renters could 
face eviction, and small businesses, 
which are already being disproportion-
ately impacted, will continue to suffer.

I know that the late Representative 
John Lewis would have taken every op-
portunity to use his voice and speak up 
for those who would not have food on 
their table if not for food banks. I 
know that he would have taken every 
opportunity to speak up for those at 
risk of losing the roof over their head, 
and I know that he would have taken 
every opportunity to speak up for the 
small and minority-owned businesses 
which cannot survive without help. 
Just last week, it was reported that 
the Atlanta businesses that have man-
aged to remain open are only making it 
by the slimmest of margins. Many of 
these struggling small and minority- 
owned businesses have never, even be-
fore the pandemic, had the access to 
the capital they need. 
They need a pivot. The loans from 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
would certainly help them, and addi-
tional funds for this program must be 
included in any stimulus plan moving 
forward. 
b 1030 
As the pandemic continues to impact 
communities in my district and across 
the country, I cannot help but urge my 
new colleagues to step up and take 
meaningful action. We cannot, and 
must not, leave the American people to 
deal with this virus alone. It is in the 
spirit of the Honorable John Lewis, our 
North Star and guiding light, that I 
say we must not leave Congress until 
we ensure that help is on the way. 
Mr. Speaker, struggling Americans 
deserve better.

CONGRATULATING MYRNA 
BALLARD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Ms. 
Myrna Ballard on her retirement from 
serving as Valdosta-Lowndes County 
Chamber of Commerce president after 
23 years. 
Myrna has been a pillar to Valdosta 
and Lowndes throughout her time serv-
ing in the chamber because of her work 
in economic development, infrastruc-
ture building, and supporting pro-busi-
ness legislation. Thanks to her diligent 
and consistent efforts, the chamber has 
continuously received the 5-star ac-
creditation by the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. 
The accreditation program defines 
standards of excellence in chamber 
planning and performance, and shows 
chambers how they can reach and 
maintain these standards. It also rec-
ognizes folks like Myrna who have 
helped set high standards for chamber 
members and staff to contribute to the 
good of their communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Myrna the best 
as she begins her retirement. Congratu-
lations again. 
HONORING MEG HEAP 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Chatham 
County District Attorney Meg Heap. 
Since she was elected DA in 2012, Meg 
has fought hard to secure justice, pre-
vent crimes, and improve our commu-
nity. Her lifelong passion for working 
with victims of crime and senior citi-
zens helped pave her way to law school 
at Mercer University. A Savannah na-
tive, Meg’s career and time as DA was 
marked by her love for Chatham Coun-
ty and its people, which is why she 
worked so hard to establish the many 
new programs and innovations to im-
prove the district attorney’s office. 
Some of the many programs she 
started include the Youth Intercept for 
at-risk youth and the Pretrial Diver-
sion for youthful, non-violent first of-
fenders. Meg also helped establish the 
Chatham County Family Justice Cen-
ter to assist special victims find the 
services they need in just one space. 
I am thankful for Meg’s many years 
of hard work, as Chatham is truly a 
better place because of her. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL ZEIGLER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Mr. Daniel Zeigler of Savannah, Geor-
gia, who, sadly, passed away on Decem-
ber 4 at the young age of 33. 
Daniel was a graduate of the South 
University School of Pharmacy and 
worked as a pharmacist at Medicap 
Pharmacy. One of his greatest joys was 
taking care of his pharmacy patients, 
and he did it with unmatched kindness 
and intentionality. 
Daniel loved the Lord and attended 
services 
at 
Compassion 
Christian 
Church’s Henderson Campus. Like his 
father, he also had a passion for cars 
and was an avid member of various or-
ganizations. Daniel was the youngest 
member of the Oglethorpe Driving 
Club, and cofounded the successful Cars 
and Coffee, which was a group for car 
lovers across Savannah. 
He dedicated much of his joy and 
much of his time every December to 
helping out with the Toys for Tots toy 
drive, which benefits kids in need. 
Mr. Speaker, my prayers, Amy’s 
prayers, and all of the friends at 
Carter’s Pharmacy’s prayers go out to 
all the lives that Daniel touched, in-
cluding his patients, his family, his 
parents, Donna and Jay, his brother, 
Jason, and all of his friends who were 
blessed to know him.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE 
COLLIN C. PETERSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor our colleague and my 
good friend, chairman of the Agricul-
tural Committee, COLLIN PETERSON. 
Mr. Speaker, Chairman PETERSON has 
served 30 years as a Member of Con-
gress; so long that there was another 
Congressman PANETTA serving in this 
body when COLLIN was elected back in 
1990. Fortunately, over that long time 
came experience and wisdom that 
Chairman PETERSON
was more than 
happy to use and share to help other 
Members of Congress, to serve his con-
stituents in Minnesota’s 7th Congres-
sional District, and to further our Na-
tion’s agriculture. One thing that I 
have learned and one thing that Chair-
man PETERSON will always tell us is 
that more needs to be done for our ag-
riculture. 
Mr. Speaker, now, I first met Chair-
man PETERSON as a freshman Member 
on the Agriculture Committee. I will 
never forget how he gathered the fresh-
men Democrats, who were all excited 
not just to be a part of Congress, but 
having the opportunity to formulate 
the upcoming farm bill. But in his, 
let’s just say, charming way, COLLIN 
quickly cooled that enthusiasm when 
he warned us about the potential for 
issues on the nutrition title—the larg-
est section of that bill—in which he 
said it could prevent us from getting a 
bill. 
In fact, in his straightforward way, 
he actually said, ‘‘If they screw with 
SNAP, we are not getting a farm bill.’’ 
I have to say, as the 115th went on, 
and with the positive hearings we had 
on SNAP, I was incredulous as to that 
warning that Chairman PETERSON had. 
But that ominous warning turned into 
an 
accurate 
prediction, 
because 
2 
weeks before the farm bill was dropped, 
we were notified of the majority’s de-
sire to add stringent restrictions on 
how one acquires SNAP benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, but what I experienced 
after that was something I will never 
forget. The way Chairman PETERSON 
not only stood firm in his beliefs about 
the importance of the benefits to low- 
income families and that the fraud and 
error rate in those programs is among 
the lowest in government, and using 
the passion of Congressman DAVID 
SCOTT, Chairman PETERSON got us all 
to stand together in opposition. 
He then worked together with chair-
man and ranking member of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee to push to-
gether, push forward, put together and 
pass a bipartisan 2018 farm bill. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising that 
Chairman PETERSON was able to do so, 
because during his time, he worked on 
five farm bills, a bill that has 12 titles 
and is complex and nuanced. So to lead 
the Agriculture Committee, to lead 
Congress, and to unify our members on 
something so diverse, it takes leader-
ship, it takes knowledge of the farm 
policy, but also an understanding and 
appreciation of how the farm bill pro-
tects our food security and the people 
affected by our foreign policy. 
It is also a bill that demonstrates 
what Chairman PETERSON stands for 
and what Chairman PETERSON
made 
the Agriculture Committee stand for— 
a platform to support farmers, ranch-
ers, and families in America. From the 
row crops and dairy producers in his 
rural district to the speciality crop and 
organic farmers and farm workers in 
my district, to the families in every 
district who rely on food assistance 
programs, Chairman PETERSON
made

sure that all of us in Congress have a 
seat at the Agriculture Committee. I 
believe that is a big part of why the 
Agriculture Committee stands out for 
its bipartisanship and its commonsense 
approach in protecting food security 
and promoting people in agriculture. 
Mr. Speaker, see, based on who he is 
and where he comes from, Chairman 
PETERSON understands the incredible 
contributions that rural Americans 
have on our way of life. We do have the 
best farmers and farm workers in the 
world. Rural Americans supply most of 
our food, our water, and our energy. 
They are the reason for our food secu-
rity and our economic diversity. We 
don’t have to pay that much for food. 
Therefore, we can spend on other 
things in our lives and create a diverse 
economy. 
Mr. Speaker, rural Americans under-
stand that every American’s obligation 
is to give back to this country and 
community that has given us so much. 
Maybe that is why 30 percent of rural 
America makes up 30 percent of our 
Armed Forces. But what Chairman 
PETERSON warns is that, even with all 
that good work in rural America, they 
feel underappreciated and they feel 
overwhelmed. 
Chairman PETERSON sees that first-
hand with the widening divide between 
rural America and urban America, a di-
vide that has led to the depletion of 
jobs, of small businesses, of people, and 
even communities, which ultimately 
leads to a growing sense of desperation. 
Don’t get me wrong, people in agri-
culture are used to dealing with the 
challenges. I call them the four Ms. 
They deal with Mother Nature. They 
deal with the markets. They deal with 
the mandates. They deal with the mi-
gration and the lack of labor. But they 
are always pivoting to get over those 
hurdles. It is that risk-taking attitude 
that allows them not just to survive, 
but to succeed. 
Mr. Speaker, nowadays, there are 
other forces in play in rural America, 
with large corporate firms squeezing 
out the family-owned farms, with chain 
stores pricing out mom-and-pop stores, 
with the lack of rural broadband, and 
the lack of healthcare options and the 
shrinking number of rural hospitals. 
It is no wonder why in many parts of 
rural America there is a sense of des-
peration leading to a ridiculously high 
rate of suicides and leaving a vacuum 
that can be filled with a vilification of 
certain races, certain places, and cer-
tain political parties. 
Unfortunately, this has led not just 
to that type of vilification, but also to 
the lack of faith and how our Congress 
and government can help them. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to do what 
Chairman PETERSON has always said we 
should do. It is time for us to do more 
for those who aren’t from rural dis-
tricts to work on focusing and con-
necting with rural districts by showing 
up, by shutting up, by listening up, and 
for us to put up a strategy that is not 
just about doling out billions of dollars 
to farmers, but actually partnering 
with them so they have sustainable 
business and a sustainable way of life. 
Mr. Speaker, if we do that, we will 
uphold what Chairman PETERSON has 
always asked us to do, and that is to 
work for the people and agriculture, 
and we can do that and provide faith to 
people in rural America and all of 
America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PASTOR 
DAVID BAKER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor the life 
of my friend, Pastor David Baker of 
Belton, Missouri. 
On November 29, Pastor Baker went 
to be with the Lord—a loss for us, but 
a gain for Heaven. 
This last August marked his 39th 
year as senior pastor of the First Bap-
tist Church of Belton, Missouri, and 37 
years from his founding of Heartland 
Christian Schools. Through these two 
ministries, more than 6,000 people ac-
cepted Christ and over 2,000 people 
were baptized; truly remarkable. 
Mr. Speaker, Pastor David Baker had 
a tremendous impact on countless lives 
and was a leader in the community. He 
was respected for his knowledge as a 
Bible scholar, his kind heart, his love 
for others, and his willingness to share 
what God’s Word says about the issues 
of the day. He was not afraid to take a 
stand for what is right and good, which 
is refreshing in today’s world. 
Most of all, Pastor David Baker was 
a wonderful husband and ministry 
partner to his wife, Claire, and a loving 
father to his three children—Brian, 
Brett, and Brooke—and to his nine 
grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, Pastor Baker will be 
deeply missed, but I know his legacy 
will live on in the thousands of lives he 
touched and influenced for eternity. I 
am thankful for his friendship through 
the years and I am grateful for the 
positive impact he made on our com-
munity and this Nation. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RON DITZFELD 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. Ron Ditzfeld, a beloved business 
leader, philanthropist, and a true pillar 
in the Sedalia community. 
Ron Ditzfeld was born and raised in 
Sedalia, Missouri. His parents, Jon and 
Bernice, founded Ditzfeld Transfer, In-
corporated, in 1960, with two straight 
trucks. In 1968, Ron Ditzfeld and his 
brother, Donnie, began working for the 
family business. In 1996, Ron took over 
as the President of Ditzfeld Transfer, 
Inc. Today, Ditzfeld Transfer, Inc., has 
more than 80 employees and provides 
trucking services, bus transportation, 
container services across the United 
States, trash pickup services, and pro-
vides warehouse and distribution serv-
ices. 
Ron also served two years in the U.S. 
Army at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, Ron was not only a bea-
con in the business community, he also 
was very active in the community serv-
ing on the board of several organiza-
tions, such as the State Fair Commu-
nity College Foundation, CHS Coopera-
tive Workshop, and Sedalia Airport. 
His civic involvement includes the 
State Fair Foundation, the Economic 
Development 
Sedalia-Pettis 
County, 
Daum Museum of Contemporary Art at 
State Fair Community College, Sacred 
Heart Foundation, Child Safe of Cen-
tral Missouri, Sedalia Bomber baseball, 
JROTC, and local/national disaster re-
lief efforts. 
Ron was dedicated to his community 
and he lent a hand whenever he could. 
Ron was even known to drive the 
Smith-Cotton High School JROTC and 
Team SCREAM robotics team to na-
tional competitions through Ditzfeld 
Transfer, Inc.’s charter services. 
Ron will be dearly missed by his 
friends, family, and community. Please 
join me in honoring Ron Ditzfeld, 
whose legacy will continue to impact 
countless lives for many generations to 
come. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HOPE LECCI 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the life 
of Hope Lecci, a dedicated reporter at 
the Sedalia Democrat, who passed 
away just days from writing the news 
articles about the passing of commu-
nity leader, Ron Ditzfeld. 
Hope began her career, not as a jour-
nalist, but as a teacher of English and 
history at Smithton School District, 
where she influenced countless stu-
dents and future leaders, including our 
current 
State 
representative, 
Brad 
Pollitt. 
Mr. Speaker, Hope was respected and 
revered by all who knew her. She was 
professional, kind, and loving to those 
around her, dedicated to her family and 
her faith. I enjoyed getting to know 
her and interacting with her as a jour-
nalist. She was always fair and dedi-
cated to ensuring every quote was ac-
curate and the topic was thoroughly 
covered. I am sorry she will no longer 
be covering news in the area, but I 
know she is rejoicing and receiving her 
heavenly reward. 
Mr. Speaker, may her example in-
spire all of us to be our best in our pro-
fessions and in our interactions with 
others.

Floridians, exemplified by deep com-
munity 
involvement, 
civility, 
and 
practical 
commonsense 
decision-
making. George is a Republican and is 
my dear friend. 
b 1045 
George got his start working for St. 
Petersburg Congressman Bill Cramer. 
Upon Mr. Cramer’s retirement, he 
began an extraordinary 35-year run 
with 
Representative 
Cramer’s 
suc-
cessor, 
Congressman 
Bill 
Young. 
George served on his Washington, D.C., 
staff and was best known throughout 
the county as Congressman Young’s 
longtime district director. 
In 2007, he made the jump to elected 
office himself, joining the Clearwater 
City Council. George served on the 
council for 5 years before rising to the 
mayor’s office in 2012. At city hall, 
Mayor Cretekos governed Clearwater 
with unfaltering professionalism, shep-
herding major initiatives such as the 
$60-plus million Imagine Clearwater 
downtown 
waterfront 
restoration 
project. In addition to his mayoral 
role, he served as the president of the 
Barrier Islands Government Council 
and the Pinellas County Mayors’ Coun-
cil. 
Throughout his public career, he was 
first to listen, quick to find com-
promise, and, foremost, committed to 
the well-being of his constituents. 
I have known George for many, many 
years. He has always gone out of his 
way to look out for ways in our com-
munity to help out, large and small. He 
served on the OneBlood Tampa Bay 
area board, donating over 60 gallons of 
blood during his lifetime. He continues 
to be a volunteer courier for the Na-
tional Bone Marrow Donor Program 
and remains very involved with the 
Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church 
in Clearwater, Florida. 
He was awarded numerous accolades 
for his contributions, notably from the 
Salvation Army as well as the Greater 
Tampa Bay Area Council of the Boy 
Scouts of America. 
George was an elected official, but he 
was never afraid to roll up his sleeves 
and quietly do the hard work behind 
the scenes. He has volunteered to build 
homes for Habitat for Humanity. He 
helped with the Clearwater Jazz Fes-
tival. He serves dinners for the needy. 
He has worked 12-plus-hour shifts for 
days on end as a Pinellas County poll 
worker. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me, once 
again, in commemorating the career of 
Mayor George Cretekos—my fellow 
Greek, by the way—recognizing his 
outstanding service and dedication to 
our community. 
He has served admirably, with humil-
ity. His leadership and character dis-
tinguish him as a gold standard for 
public service. His good works will be 
remembered for decades to come.

AMERICAN INNOVATION IS IN THE 
EXPRESS LANE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, American innovation is in the 
express lane, and we have President 
Trump and both the private and public 
sectors to thank. 
The progress that has been made to 
date on viable vaccine candidates is as-
tonishing, and it is a promising sign for 
the American people. 
It is truly a testament to the grit and 
resilience that resides within this 
country, and we have come a long way 
since the beginning of this year. 
We are on the cusp of eradicating 
COVID–19 once and for all, and the live-
lihoods of the American people will be 
restored. 
Mr. Speaker, never bet against Amer-
ican innovation. It has the power to 
change the world. 
PERSONAL BATTLE WITH COVID–19 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, recently, my family faced a 
test that was unlike any we had faced 
before: fighting COVID–19. 
My husband contracted the virus and 
spent 4 days in Watauga Medical Cen-
ter, where he received excellent care 
from doctors and nurses. I tested posi-
tive, was totally asymptomatic, but, of 
course, was quarantined and under-
stand the frustration associated with 
that. Thankfully, though, I was able to 
continue my work without interrup-
tion, unlike so many others. 
We have always been grateful for 
those in healthcare, treating others at 
their own risk, but we understand the 
situation they are facing better than 
ever. 
We are even more grateful for the 
men and women fighting on the front 
lines to protect the American people. 
They do so not out of self-interest but 
rather through a solemn commitment 
to protect the sanctity of human life. 
We will be forever grateful for their 
countless sacrifices and will continue 
to pray for their safety and for God’s 
grace to continue. 
To those impeccable men and women 
serving, from the bottom of my heart, 
thank you.

DON’T TREAT BIPARTISANSHIP 
LIKE A FOUR-LETTER WORD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. HURD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our 
Nation is full of opportunity. 
How else could a young Black kid 
from San Antonio, Texas, grow up to 
come to Congress to represent a major-
ity Latino district and get 17 pieces of 
legislation signed into law? 
My mom always taught me: You are 
either part of the problem or you are 
part of the solution. So, I ran for Con-
gress, and over the past 6 years, I have 
done everything I can to work with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
get things done. 
During my tenure, I have had some 
legislative lows, like being two signa-
tures short of a successful discharge 
petition which would have led to a 
DACA fix being put on the President’s 
desk. 
We should never stop fighting for 
these folks who are part of our Amer-
ican family. People like John Lewis 
taught us that this kind of work may 
be long, and it may be hard, but it is 
righteous. 
At the same time, I have had some 
legislative highs: 
Being the lead Republican, with my 
friend JOSE´
SERRANO, to get the Na-
tional Museum of the American Latino 
Act unanimously passed out of this 
House 
of 
Representatives—after 
26 
years, we finally did it. 
Modernizing IT procurement laws so 
that the government provides better 
digital-facing services and establishing 
a national strategy to ensure the U.S. 
stays a leader in artificial intelligence 
are going to pay off for years. 
I came to Congress to make our Na-
tion safer. When I was first elected, 
ISIS was our biggest national security 
threat. As we look at the years ahead, 
the nature of the threat is distinctly 
different. 
The next generation-defining battle, 
which has already begun, is against the 
Chinese Communist Party. China is 
trying to supplant the United States as 
the sole superpower in this world by 
2049. 
Every American should care about 
this struggle because we face a poten-
tial future where Mandarin and the 
yuan, not English and the dollar, domi-
nate the global economy. The winner of 
this generation-defining struggle will 
not just affect our economy but will 
shape the rest of the century for the 
entire world. 
Within this context of great power 
competition, I urge my colleagues to 
confront this national security threat 
with a simple principle that I learned 
from my time in the CIA: Be nice with 
nice guys and tough with tough guys. 
Back home, I have learned another 
simple principle: Show up. I was will-
ing to show up to places others weren’t, 
listen to what folks had to say, and 
work across the aisle to solve prob-
lems. We were able to find solutions to 
some of the most difficult problems 
plaguing our constituents by empow-
ering people, not the government. 
I could not have done any of this 
without my staff. From day one, my 
team and I held the belief that no prob-
lem was too small and that no goal was 
too big. This mentality is how we 
ended up helping a high-schooler who 
had an idea of preventing her friends 
from distracted driving, and it is how 
we spent a year working on a national 
strategy for artificial intelligence. 
Despite these legislative successes, 
the thing I will remember most is help-
ing constituents whose names folks 
don’t know battle the Federal bureauc-
racy. Making a difference in the lives 
of those folks is something I will cher-
ish forever. 
To all of my staff over the years, es-
pecially Nancy Pack, thank you for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6914 
December 8, 2020 
your late hours, thank you for your 
hard work, thank you for putting up 
with me, and thank you for your dedi-
cation, not just to the folks of the 23rd 
Congressional District of Texas, but to 
the entire American family. 
It has been a distinct privilege to 
stand on this floor for the past 6 years 
to debate issues and represent the peo-
ple of the 23rd Congressional District. 
Thank you for putting your faith and 
trust in me. 
Serving as a Member of Congress has 
not only taught me about this incred-
ible institution and how to legislate; it 
has proven a long-held belief that way 
more unites us as a country than di-
vides us. 
My final message for my colleagues, 
as I depart this body: Don’t treat bipar-
tisanship like a four-letter word. The 
only way big things have ever been 
done in this country is by doing them 
together.

HONORING RETIRING SENATOR 
PAT ROBERTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this 
month, after 40 years of service as a 
Member of Congress, our senior Sen-
ator of Kansas will be moving his be-
longings out of his office in the Hart 
Senate Office Building to a private li-
brary. 
To best honor him, I would like to 
share some of his original wit, some of 
the quips for which he is most famous. 
Number one: 
Take your job seriously, but not yourself. 
There are no self-made men or women in 
public service. It is your family, friends, and 
staff who have made you what you are. 
Another couple of favorites: 
You are only as good as your staff. 
It isn’t the best possible bill; it is the best 
bill possible. 
In reference to an opponent who 
sometimes disagrees with you, he sug-
gested: 
Go smother them with the milk of human 
kindness. 
On his commitment to agriculture, 
he said: 
We live in a troubled and hungry world. 
Food security is national security. 
When asked about why we need agri-
culture programs, the Senator once 
said: 
You can’t eat a shoe. 
On life, when asked about making a 
mistake, he suggested that: 
You go hunker down and take it like a 
donkey in a hailstorm. 
He once said: 
Remember, when you roll around with 
pigs, you both get dirty, but only one of you 
enjoys it. 
On sports, at football games, he often 
said: 
Throw the ball to the tight end. He was 
wide open. 
And, of course, as we all know, the 
Senator was the unofficial tight end 
coach for the ever-optimistic and fight-
ing Kansas State Wildcats. 
At a townhall, when a rabid con-
stituent gave a forceful opposing opin-
ion, he once replied: 
I’ll mark you down as undecided. 
I loved when he referred to Kansas 
University as that school over by 
Baker. 
The Senator, once a marine, was al-
ways a marine. He was often quoted 
saying ‘‘take the hill’’ and ‘‘semper fi.’’ 
But my personal favorite: 
There are lots of cactuses in the world, but 
you don’t have to go sit on every one. 
When I first meet successful, influen-
tial people, people who I have read 
about or know of, I have often asked 
myself: Is there any substance to this 
person? Is there character and integ-
rity? What is truly important to them? 
I would like to share, as we have got-
ten to know Senator ROBERTS and his 
wife, Franki, I have found that their 
footprints are larger than their shad-
ows, their hearts are bigger than their 
words, their love of this country, their 
love of Kansas, more than any words I 
can find to describe. 
Personally, I cannot imagine any 
memory of Senator ROBERTS without 
thinking of his bride, his South Caro-
lina magnolia blossom, as he often 
called her, whom he married some 51 
years ago. She is absolutely his rock, 
the person I always see standing beside 
him with adoring eyes. While occasion-
ally she gives him a gentle nudge, ev-
eryone knows she always has his back. 
Laina and I want to personally thank 
Senator ROBERTS and Franki, who have 
embraced us with hospitality and kind-
ness since arriving ourselves in Wash-
ington, D.C., some 4 years ago. They 
have shown us what it is to be an am-
bassador for our State. From Christ-
mas gatherings at the White House to 
farm bill hearings in a barn, they have 
shown what servant leadership looks 
like, representing our State with dig-
nity and grace. 
Senator ROBERTS is the only person 
in American history to have his por-
trait in both the House Agriculture 
Committee and the Senate Agriculture 
Committee hearing rooms. 
Senator ROBERTS has had a hand in 
writing eight farm bills. He has been on 
a Federal congressional agriculture 
committee for 40 years running. Some 
of his greatest accomplishments in-
clude those eight farm bills, and I am 
going to reference two of them. 
The Federal Agriculture Improve-
ment and Reform Act of 1996, which he 
was the primary author and chairman, 
this became known as the Freedom to 
Farm bill. 
Chairman ROBERTS has often told the 
story—I have heard this maybe once or 
twice—of sitting on the tongue of the 
wagon of a farmer in Dodge City, Kan-
sas, with all of his farm experts, and 
his good friend, Leon Torline said: PAT, 
we all need freedom to farm. 
Sure enough, this agriculture policy 
gave producers the freedom to plant 
crops based on market indicators, not 
Federal Government set-aside policies. 
Next, I will reference the first farm 
bill I participated in, the Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018, on which he 
was the primary author as chairman. 
Probably most notably, this farm bill 
received more votes than any farm bill 
in modern history, with 87 in favor. 
I would like to also mention the 2016 
National Bioengineered Food Disclo-
sure Act. This Federal legislation cre-
ated standards for labeling food with 
ingredients 
derived 
from 
bio-
technology. 
Then his 2000 Agriculture Risk Pro-
tection Act reformed national crop in-
surance and led to its widespread use 
today. 
Finally, I will mention Senator ROB-
ERTS was always the leader in bio-agro 
security legislation. As chairman of 
the 
Senate 
Armed 
Services 
Sub-
committee on Emerging Threats and 
Capabilities, Senator ROBERTS chaired 
the first Senate hearing on the threat 
to our Nation’s food supply. 
I will close with this. Though Sen-
ator ROBERTS will always be known for 
his wit, being an entertaining speaker, 
and a great interview, his actions and 
his accomplishments will always speak 
louder than any of his words. 
He and Franki have been tremendous 
ambassadors for agriculture, for Kan-
sas, 
and 
for 
America. 
They 
have 
climbed many mountains, and they 
have planted the flag. 
Senator ROBERTS, semper fi. May God 
richly bless you, Franki, and your fam-
ily.

HONORING GENERAL ROBERT 
HINSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to retired Lieu-
tenant General Robert C. Hinson, U.S. 
Air Force, the founding executive di-
rector of the National Strategic Re-
search Institute at the University of 
Nebraska, who recently announced his 
retirement at the end of this year. 
General Hinson retires after more 
than a half century of highly distin-
guished service supporting the mis-
sions of the Department of Defense, 
commercial industry, and the Univer-
sity of Nebraska. 
General Robert Hinson’s leadership 
and dedication to the principles of free-
dom have been indispensable for Amer-
ica’s national security interest. He 
began his career by enlisting in the 
United States Air Force. After spend-
ing 1 year as an administrative spe-
cialist, he received a commission from 
Officer Training School in 1971. 
General Hinson retired after 33 years 
of 
exemplary 
Active-Duty 
military 
service. Over the course of his career, 
he distinguished himself as an out-
standing military leader commanding

many units, including the 529th Bomb 
Squadron, the 99th Operations and 
Maintenance Group, the 99th Tactics 
and Training Wing, the 28th Bomb 
Wing, the 45th Space Wing, and the 
14th Air Force. 
General Hinson later rose to posi-
tions of great responsibility, serving as 
the vice commander of Air Force Space 
Command at Peterson Air Force Base 
in Colorado, and then later as a deputy 
commander of the United States Stra-
tegic Command at Offutt Air Force 
Base, Nebraska. 
General Hinson is a command pilot 
with more than 3,000 flying hours, pri-
marily flying in bomber aircraft, to in-
clude the B–52, FB–111, and the B–1. 
He received many prestigious awards 
and decorations during a long, selfless 
military career that included 25 moves 
for his family. 
General Hinson continued to support 
the national security of the United 
States upon his retirement from the 
Air Force, serving 9 years as the vice 
president of government programs and 
corporate lead executive at Northrop 
Grumman. 
Continuing to answer the call of his 
country, General Hinson then became 
the founding executive director for the 
National Strategic Research Institute 
at the University of Nebraska. With vi-
sion, tenacity, and leadership, he cre-
ated the great team that established 
this Department of Defense, University 
Affiliated Research Center, known as 
UARC, at the University of Nebraska. 
Sponsored by U.S. Strategic Command, 
the National Strategic Research Insti-
tute became the first UARC supporting 
a combatant command. 
NSRI provides scientific-based solu-
tions across the threat spectrum and 
across multiple domains. With an in-
tense mission focus, General Hinson 
has been the driving force, creating a 
trusted 
research 
institution 
which, 
today, is recognized globally for deep-
ening U.S. strategic and operational 
understanding of 21st century national 
security challenges. 
General Hinson led a team of 75 pro-
fessionals, working from offices and 
laboratories across the University of 
Nebraska’s campuses and near cus-
tomers in the National Capital and 
Space Coast regions. During his tenure, 
NSRI has collaborated with more than 
350 Nebraska University researchers 
and students, serving 44 customers 
across DOD and the Federal Govern-
ment, while executing over $300 million 
in Federal research funding. 
In addition to his prolific and mili-
tary and civilian careers, General 
Hinson continued contributing to his 
community, serving on the board of di-
rectors for several organizations, to in-
clude the STRATCOM Consultation 
Committee, the STRATCOM Strategic 
Advisory Group’s Bomber Task Force 
Panel, the Strategic Air Command, and 
the Air and Space Museum. He also 
served on the Offutt Air Force Base Ad-
visory Council and The Peter Kiewit 
Institute Board of Policy Advisors. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank 
General Hinson for being a mentor of 
mine when I commanded the 55th Wing 
at Offutt Air Force Base back in 2011 
and 2012. 
Mr. Speaker, this Nation owes a debt 
of gratitude to this outstanding war-
rior who firmly believes in service be-
fore self and excellence in all he did. I 
thank General Hinson for his nearly 50 
years of outstanding public service and 
wish him and his family all the best as 
he begins the next chapter of his life.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
CONGRESSMAN WILL HURD AND 
CONGRESSWOMAN 
TULSI 
GABBARD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the incredible 
service of two very special Members of 
this Chamber who are retiring after 
this term, WILL HURD of Texas and 
TULSI GABBARD of Hawaii. 
WILL HURD is a native son of San An-
tonio, Texas, and a graduate of Texas 
A&M University, where he was a stu-
dent body president and graduated 
with a degree in computer science and 
international relations. 
After graduation, WILL spent 9 years 
working and serving our country for 
the CIA. While primarily based here in 
Washington, D.C., WILL was also sta-
tioned overseas in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan and India. And while in Paki-
stan, WILL worked undercover and be-
came fluent in the native language. 
In the CIA, WILL worked to keep our 
national security safe, thwarting ter-
rorism across the globe, and putting 
nuclear weapons proliferators out of 
business. Part of his responsibilities in 
Washington was to brief Members of 
Congress here on the Hill on intel-
ligence and national security issues, 
which undoubtedly sparked his interest 
in politics. 
During his time in Congress, WILL 
has been a leading Member on cyberse-
curity, artificial intelligence, immigra-
tion, and tech issues. He worked in-
credibly hard to ensure that the De-
partment of Homeland Security is able 
to work efficiently and effectively, 
modernize our immigration system, 
and speak on the need to stay ahead of 
our adversaries in cybersecurity and 
technology. 
Also a colleague of ours, TULSI 
GABBARD was born in American Samoa 
and was raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. A 
graduate of Hawai’i Pacific University, 
TULSI was elected to the Hawaii House 
of Representatives at age 21, the 
youngest legislator ever elected in the 
State. 
A year into her service, she enlisted 
in the Hawaii Army National Guard 
and volunteered to deploy with her fel-
low soldiers in 2004. She went on two 
tours of duty in the Middle East, first 
in Iraq and later in Kuwait, and is cur-
rently serving as a major in the Army 
Reserves. 
In between her tours of duty, TULSI 
served as a legislative aide to the late 
Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii. Dur-
ing her time with the Senator, she 
worked on issues related to energy, 
Homeland Security, the environment, 
and veterans. During this time, TULSI 
graduated 
from 
Officer 
Candidate 
School at the Alabama Military Acad-
emy, where she was the first woman to 
finish as a distinguished honor grad-
uate. 
During TULSI’s time in Congress, she 
has been a fierce advocate for veterans, 
servicemembers, and their families. 
She has worked to make their lives 
easier and to ensure that Congress 
never forgets the women and men who 
sacrificed for our freedoms. 
Mr. Speaker, WILL and TULSI have 
been two amazing Members of this in-
stitution. I served with WILL on the 
Homeland Security Committee, and I 
served with TULSI on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. This Chamber and our 
Nation are better off because they 
chose to serve in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, both WILL and TULSI 
caucus with different parties in this 
Chamber, but they share an awful lot 
in common: 
They are both people of class; 
They are both people of honor and 
dignity; 
They both put their life on the line in 
service of our Nation; 
They both are independent thinkers; 
They are both people of incredible 
courage; 
They are both people of intellectual 
honesty; 
They are both leaders whom I respect 
and look up to, both before I was in 
Congress and certainly now. 
They are two people who served this 
institution well, who made our Nation 
proud, and I have no doubt that their 
time serving our Nation is not at an 
end. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank them both for 
their service, for their courage, for 
their sacrifice, for being intellectual 
leaders, thought leaders, being honest, 
staying true to their convictions, and 
putting their country ahead of their 
party every single day of their lives. I 
appreciate their service, Mr. Speaker. 
f 
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of the frustrated and, frank-
ly, exhausted small business job-cre-
ators in my district and across the Na-
tion who are struggling to survive 
while the Speaker continues to play 
politics with people’s livelihoods. 
While many States and localities 
begin to make the same mistake of in-
stituting massive shutdowns, small 
businesses have been left high and dry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6916 
December 8, 2020 
Imagine pouring everything you have 
emotionally and financially into an 
idea; then you watch it grow and 
thrive, but, through no fault of your 
own, it gets ruined because your local 
government shuts you down and the 
Federal Government refuses to help. 
The Speaker can solve this problem 
today by allowing a vote to unleash 
over $130 billion in already-appro-
priated leftover PPP funding. 
In addition, the House should imme-
diately consider the Small Business 
Expense Protection Act, which was in-
troduced by my friend and fellow North 
Carolinian, GEORGE HOLDING. That bill 
would clarify the confusion at the IRS 
and make sure that recipients can de-
duct PPP-financed expenses on their 
taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our Na-
tion’s job creators and for the sake of 
our workers, it is time that we act to 
support our fellow citizens as we enter 
the final stages of our battle against 
this virus. 
f 
RECOGNIZING COMPUTER SCIENCE 
EDUCATION WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Computer Science Education Week. In 
2009, this opportunity for awareness 
was established to highlight the many 
ways computer science education bene-
fits individuals as well as entire indus-
tries. 
Computer Science Education Week is 
a chance for students of all ages to 
learn about the importance and bene-
fits of computer science and the end-
less professional opportunities that 
abound with a skills-based education. 
I am co-chair of the bipartisan Career 
and Technical Education Caucus, and 
it has been a pleasure to work across 
the aisle to support important edu-
cational programs like investments in 
computer science. 
Our Nation is in desperate need of 
skilled workers, and career and tech-
nical education is a win-win. It can 
offer rewarding professional futures for 
learners of all ages, while simulta-
neously closing the Nation’s skills gap. 
An industry that can particularly 
benefit from a skilled workforce, and 
especially those trained in computer 
science, is cybersecurity. 
H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills 
Integration Act, is a bill I am proud to 
cosponsor with my Career and Tech-
nical Education Caucus co-chair, Con-
gressman JIM LANGEVIN from Rhode Is-
land. 
The Cybersecurity Skills Integration 
Act seeks to develop a critical infra-
structure 
workforce 
that 
is 
well- 
trained to handle cyber threats from 
bad actors. H.R. 1592 authorizes $10 mil-
lion to create a competitive grant pro-
gram within the Department of Edu-
cation to incorporate cybersecurity 
education into new and existing career 
and technical education programs. The 
bill also requires the Department of 
Education to coordinate with the De-
partment of Homeland Security to bet-
ter support cybersecurity education 
programs. 
COVID–19 demonstrated how much 
we rely on a skilled and trained work-
force, and sadly, the personal lives and 
careers of many Americans have been 
uprooted as a result of the virus. Far 
too 
many 
people 
lost 
their 
jobs 
through no fault of their own. That is 
why I was eager to be an original co-
sponsor of H.R. 7032, the Skills Re-
newal Act. 
This legislation would help displaced 
workers gain new skills and advance 
their careers upon reentry into the 
workforce. The bill would create a 
$4,000 fully refundable skills training 
credit to cover a wide range of career 
and technical education programs. 
Mr. Speaker, we need a workforce 
that can meet modern technical de-
mands, and students who choose a ca-
reer in technical education are best 
suited for that challenge. Through ca-
reer and technical educational pro-
grams like computer science, we can 
begin to close our Nation’s skills gap 
and help individuals restore the rungs 
on the ladder of opportunity.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

Loving and gracious God, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
We ask today that You bless the 
Members of the people’s House to be 
the best and most faithful servants of 
the people they serve. 
As this second session of the 116th 
Congress draws near its end, and legis-
lative business once again weighs heav-
ily on this Hill, withhold not Your spir-
it of wisdom and truth from this as-
sembly. Give each Member clarity of 
thought and purity of motive, so that 
they may render their service as their 
best selves. 
In this time of waiting, as people of 
faith prepare for holy celebrations, 
bless our Nation with peace and good 
will. May all Americans, of whatever 
faith or background, work together to 
build a commonweal—something which 
can only be accomplished by Your 
grace. 
May all that is done this day in the 
peoples’ House be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROBERT KRESSE 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of Robert Kresse, a western New 
York champion for those who had 
none. 
Bob 
Kresse 
combined 
his 
lawyerly skills for estates and historic 
preservation to become a powerful 
force for good in Buffalo for 70 years. 
Bob Kresse knew well that his vision 
went beyond the bricks and mortar of 
preservation; it was the restorative 
power of preservation on the hearts of 
the people and the community that he 
loved that mattered most. 
Bob Kresse is survived by his beau-
tiful family, including his beloved wife 
of 56 years, Mary Ann. Bob would often 
say that Mary Ann didn’t just love him 
back; she was his chief collaborator 
and best friend always, especially in 
those last, most difficult days. 
The Niagara River Greenway, the 
King Urban Life Center, the Roycroft, 
and the Darwin Martin House, among 
so 
many 
others, 
have 
a 
common 
thread, and that is Bob Kresse’s un-
common vision, love, and perseverance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6917 
December 8, 2020 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H. Res. 1250, to 
create a national artificial intelligence 
strategy. 
For decades, American leadership in 
emerging 
technologies 
has 
created 
prosperity and security across the 
world, but this leadership is no longer 
guaranteed. As the Chinese Communist 
Party continues to use any means pos-
sible to become the next world power 
and world’s leader in AI, it is all the 
more vital that the U.S. have our own 
strategic plan. 
For almost a year, Representative 
ROBIN KELLY and I worked with policy 
experts, stakeholders, and the Bipar-
tisan Policy Center to develop guide-
lines that will prepare America’s work-
force, counter our adversaries, promote 
research and development, and shape 
the ethics of AI based on America’s 
values. 
This 
resolution 
outlines 
specific 
steps and actions the Federal Govern-
ment should take to ensure our global 
leadership 
in 
this 
emerging 
tech-
nology. If we don’t take advantage of 
AI, 
Mandarin 
and 
the 
yuan—not 
English and the dollar—could dominate 
the global economy. 
Vladimir Putin once said that who-
ever masters AI will master the world. 
That is why America—not Russia and 
not China—must be at the helm. 
I came to Congress to make our Na-
tion safer, and I am proud one of my 
last pieces of legislation before this 
body will do just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
good 
friend, 
ROBIN
KELLY, 
for 
partnering with me on this critical ef-
fort and our staffs for making this hap-
pen. I hope all of our colleagues will 
join us in supporting this resolution. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
MONICA RUSSO 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that 
I rise to recognize the remarkable ca-
reer of Monica Russo. 
After decades of service, Ms. Russo is 
retiring as executive vice president of 
1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers 
East, the largest local union in the Na-
tion, representing more than 400,000 
healthcare workers in five States and 
more than 25,000 healthcare workers in 
Florida. 
Under her leadership, 1199SEIU Flor-
ida has grown to represent more than 
30,000 healthcare workers and retirees, 
becoming 
the 
largest 
union 
of 
healthcare workers in Florida and the 
Southern 
United 
States. 
She 
also 
serves as international vice president 
of the SEIU and as president of SEIU 
Florida State Council, where she po-
litically unites more than 55,000 active 
and retired SEIU members, from bus 
drivers and janitors to healthcare 
workers. 
Her emphasis on multicultural lead-
ership development and grassroots, 
member-driven organization building 
has 
given 
a 
voice 
and 
power 
to 
healthcare 
workers, 
women, 
immi-
grants, and the working class. 
Monica Russo’s commitment to our 
Nation’s working families is exem-
plary, and I am proud to call her my 
sister and dear and treasured friend. I 
will miss her guidance and wisdom, but 
our loss is her family’s gain. I wish her 
a hearty congratulations on her retire-
ment and am grateful for her invalu-
able work. 
f 
PROTECT THE GREAT LAKES FOR 
GENERATIONS TO COME 
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the 2020 Water Resources 
Development Act. 
In southeast Wisconsin, the Great 
Lakes are vital to our environment, 
our economy, our health, and our way 
of life. Let me put it this way: If the 
Great Lakes region were a country, it 
would have the third largest economy 
in the world. 
We must pass WRDA to protect the 
Great Lakes, invest in America’s water 
infrastructure, and generate economic 
growth. 
Earlier this year, I urged the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee to include the Great Lakes 
Coastal Resiliency Study and the Bran-
don Road project in WRDA. Both pro-
grams are included in today’s bill. 
These programs detect vulnerabilities 
along the Great Lakes shoreline and 
prevent invasive species in the Great 
Lakes. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask Congress to pass 
WRDA and support the Great Lakes for 
generations to come. 
f 
IN HONOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS DAY, 
FREE RAIF BADAWI 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, De-
cember 10 is recognized around the 
world as Human Rights Day. 
This year marks the 72nd anniver-
sary of the adoption of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. In that 
spirit, I am here today to call on the 
Government of Saudi Arabia to release 
blogger and human rights activist Raif 
Badawi. 
In 2014, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 
1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for 
operating a website that encouraged 
debate on religious and political issues 
in his country. 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 
is claiming to be a reformer intent on 
modernizing 
Saudi 
Arabia. 
Raif 
Badawi’s case plainly disproves that 
claim. 
Raif Badawi will soon celebrate his 
37th birthday in prison, the ninth 
birthday he will have spent away from 
his wife and children. 
Mr. Speaker, the Saudi Government 
must immediately and unconditionally 
release Raif Badawi and all other Saudi 
prisoners of conscience. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MARC LEE 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Marc Lee, who was 
awarded the Silver Star and Purple 
Heart for his heroic actions on August 
2, 2006, in Ramadi, Iraq. Today, the 
House will pass my bill, H.R. 6016, to 
rename a U.S. Post Office in his honor. 
Marc’s mother, Debbie Lee, from Sur-
prise, Arizona, in my district, had the 
following to say on this momentous oc-
casion: 
‘‘Marc Lee, the first Navy SEAL 
killed in Iraq, loved deeply and was 
deeply loved. He selflessly sacrificed 
his life to save his teammates. Naming 
this post office will keep his legacy 
alive and remind us to live lives wor-
thy of their sacrifices.’’ 
It was my honor to introduce this 
legislation to remember the service 
and sacrifice of Marc Lee. 
f 
NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE STRATEGY 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to celebrate passage of H. 
Res. 1250, recognizing the principles 
that should guide the national artifi-
cial intelligence strategy of the United 
States. 
In early 2018, Representative HURD, 
as chair of the Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform Subcommittee on Infor-
mation Technology, and myself, as the 
ranking member, held the first con-
gressional hearing on artificial intel-
ligence. 
This resolution is born out of those 
hearings and the culmination of over a 
year’s work with the Bipartisan Policy 
Center, bringing together experts from 
government, the private sector, and 
civil society to outline priorities to en-
sure the United States remains a lead-
er in AI. 
AI has the potential to fundamen-
tally change our society. The U.S. 
needs a national strategy now to invest 
in our workforce, R&D, national secu-
rity, and oversight agencies to ensure 
AI is a positive tool that will benefit 
all of society. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
legislation was able to pass before my 
friend and close IT partner for the past 
6 years, Representative HURD, retires 
from this body. 
This Chamber has been made better 
by his spirit of bipartisanship and de-
sire to protect our Nation and prepare

him dearly.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MARC LEE 
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘I have felt 
fear at some of the things I have seen 
here. I have seen amazing things and I 
have seen sad things, but being in Iraq 
makes me realize what a great country 
we have.’’ 
These are the words of Navy SEAL 
Marc Lee in his last letter home before 
making the ultimate sacrifice for our 
country in Ramadi, Iraq. 
My son, Leif, served with Marc on 
SEAL Team 3 and was with him during 
his final act of honor. By all accounts, 
faith, courage, and determination were 
Marc’s guiding principles. They carried 
him throughout his valiant career. 
Thanks to Marc and many men like 
him, good continues to triumph over 
evil. In their violent wake, they leave 
behind humility, love, and selflessness, 
reminding me of John 3:13: 
Greater love hath no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MARC LEE 
(Ms. CHENEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, today the 
House will consider H.R. 6016, desig-
nating the United States Postal Serv-
ice facility in Arizona as the Marc Lee 
Memorial Post Office Building. This is 
a fitting honor and tribute to Petty Of-
ficer 2nd Class Marc Alan Lee for his 
heroic actions during Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. 
On August 2, 2006, while on patrol in 
Ramadi, Marc Lee fearlessly exposed 
himself to direct enemy fire in order to 
protect the lives of his teammates. He 
gave his life for his brothers and for 
our freedom. 
He was posthumously awarded the 
Silver Star for his actions that day. In 
the words of Jocko Willink, com-
mander of Task Unit Bruiser, Marc’s 
unit in Iraq, Marc was ‘‘one of those 
rare men, those true heroes, the ones 
who rose above the rest of us to sym-
bolize courage and faith and selfless-
ness and love.’’ 
As we honor Marc Lee today, let us 
all recommit ourselves to cherishing 
the freedom for which he died and to 
living lives worthy of the sacrifice of 
all our men and women who have given 
their lives for our liberty. 
God bless Marc and his family, and 
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.

BIDDING FAREWELL TO SETH 
KLAIMAN 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bid farewell to a vital member 
of my team and my right-hand man in 
Rhode Island for the last 7 years. Seth 
Klaiman joined my staff as district di-
rector and then my Rhode Island chief 
of staff after working for several cycles 
on my reelection campaign. The people 
of Rhode Island’s Second District could 
not have asked for a more dedicated 
public servant. 
Seth worked nonstop, and he em-
bodied the phrase ‘‘underpromise and 
overdeliver.’’ His organizational skills 
are unparalleled, and he was instru-
mental in helping me manage my most 
valuable resource, my time, on behalf 
of the people of Rhode Island. 
Seth is leaving to serve as chief of 
staff to our State Treasurer, Seth Mag-
aziner. It is a terrific opportunity for 
him to continue to serve the Ocean 
State. And while I am sad to see him 
go, I wish him the very best of luck in 
his new role. 
To Seth, his wife, Ann, and their new 
son, Sebastian, I offer my sincerest 
thanks for your years making me look 
good and all the work you have done on 
behalf of the people of Rhode Island. I 
often say that we are only as good as 
the people around us, and I am lucky 
to have had a decade spent with you.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
FREDERICK ‘‘PAL’’ BARGER, JR. 
(Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a giant in northeast Tennessee and 
my friend, Frederick ‘‘Pal’’ Barger, Jr., 
who passed away recently at the age of 
90. 
Pal’s impact on our community was 
tremendous. Pal is best known for 
Pal’s Sudden Service, a drive-through 
restaurant with rapid service, great 
food, and affordable prices. 
In 2001, Pal’s became the first res-
taurant 
to 
receive 
the 
Malcolm 
Baldrige National Quality Award, the 
Nation’s highest Presidential honor for 
performance excellence. Pal is one of 
northeast Tennessee’s best success sto-
ries. 
Pal’s 
commitment 
to 
excellence 
didn’t stop at the drive-through win-
dow. He received recognition through-
out his life for his kindness, gen-
erosity, and unwavering dedication to 
help our region prosper. 
I am especially grateful for Pal’s con-
tributions to his alma mater, East Ten-
nessee State University, which have 
greatly impacted so many of our re-
gion’s current and future leaders. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recog-
nize the life of Pal Barger for his tre-
mendous impact on our community. 
HONORING COACH NICK GIEBER 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Kansas Middle School 
wrestling coach Nick Gieber. To be 
clear, he is not dead. He is way too 
tough for that. 
For decades, Coach Gieber would 
transform boys into men through wres-
tling practices that were so hard we 
thought that death was an option. But 
it wasn’t just developing us mentally 
and physically, he also developed a 
sense of camaraderie, rapport, integ-
rity, and honor. He would say, ‘‘You 
never know, boys. Today could be the 
most beautiful day in the world.’’ 
Coach Gieber, from the floor of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives, thank you. And you never know, 
today could be the most beautiful day 
in the world.

NATIONAL BORINQUENEERS DAY

Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the NDAA. 
This bill includes an amendment I in-
troduced, along with Representative 
MURPHY and Senator RICK SCOTT, to 
honor the 65th Infantry Regiment, also 
known as the Borinqueneers, by desig-
nating 
April 
13 
as 
National 
Borinqueneers Day. 
On April 13, 2016, Congress awarded 
the Congressional Gold Medal to these 
patriots for their numerous contribu-
tions to American history and their 
outstanding 
military 
service 
from 
World War I through the recent con-
flicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
This bill also authorizes $37 million 
in military construction funding for 
the National Guard Readiness Center 
in Puerto Rico. It also includes the 
Coast 
Guard 
Reauthorization 
Act, 
which incorporates my amendment re-
quiring the Coast Guard Academy Mi-
nority Outreach Team program to in-
clude officers from the U.S. territories, 
and requiring the Academy’s diversity 
report to include information on the ef-
fectiveness of outreach and recruit-
ment efforts for the territories as well.

Last week, it was announced there 
will be a House exhibition entitled,

bition shares Rainey’s impact from the

PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, marked the 
79th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor 
naval base attack. 
On December 7, 1941, the surprise at-
tack by the Japanese on a U.S. Naval 
base in Hawaii left nearly 2,500 people 
dead. Innocent lives were taken; mem-
bers of the United States Navy, Army, 
Marines, as well as civilians. It re-
mains one of the deadliest attacks in 
American history, often described as 
‘‘a date which will live in infamy,’’ ac-
cording to a quote by President Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt. 
Every year on December 7, we pause 
to reflect and remember the sacrifice 
made by the men and women who per-
ished in the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
President Roosevelt went on to say, 
‘‘No matter how long it will take us to 
overcome this premeditated invasion, 
the American people in their righteous 
might will win through to absolute vic-
tory.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, thanks to the selfless-
ness and sacrifice of the Greatest Gen-
eration, that is exactly what they did. 
God bless all of our Pearl Harbor vic-
tims, the survivors, and their families. 
f 
A JUST AND PROPER FIGHT 
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I oppose 
the NDAA, not because I am against 
our troops, but because I love them so 
much. 
America’s fighting men and women 
are so precious that they should not 
have to die in some failed state, some 
faraway land that most Americans 
can’t even point to on a map so that 
defense contractors can extend our in-
volvement in these wars, so that lobby-
ists can get rich, and so that Members 
of Congress can get reelected. 
This good bill has been hijacked by 
the forever war lobby and their bought- 
and-paid-for allies in the United States 
Congress. It puts barriers in the way of 
an administration that wants to bring 
our troops home and put America first. 
This 
legislation 
has 
become 
too 
swampy. It does good things to ensure 
that America can vanquish any foe on 
the battlefield, but we should only 
fight when that fight is just and prop-
er. 
Mr. Speaker, we have spent two dec-
ades trading the same villages back 
and forth in Afghanistan. And I believe 
that the administration that leads our 
country should work to bring those 
troops home, and unfortunately, this 
bill does exactly the opposite. From 
Afghanistan, from Germany, and else-
where, I am going to put America first 
and I am voting against this bill.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6395, 
WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to the order of the 
House of December 3, 2020, I call up the 
conference report on the bill (H.R. 6395) 
to authorize appropriations for fiscal 
year 2021 for military activities of the 
Department of Defense, for military 
construction, and for defense activities 
of the Department of Energy, to pre-
scribe military personnel strengths for 
such fiscal year, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Thurs-
day, December 3, 2020, the conference 
report is considered read. 
(For conference report and state-
ment, see proceedings of the House of 
December 3, 2020, at Book II, page 
H6145.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
THORNBERRY) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and insert extraneous 
material on the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 6395. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the conference report before us 
today. This is the defense policy bill, 
and this is an incredibly important 
piece of legislation. There is a lot of 
public debate about different issues 
that sort of rise to the level of people 
arguing about, and they are very im-
portant, passionate issues. But lost in 
that sometimes is the basic substance 
of what we do in the defense policy bill, 
and that is, we exercise our legislative 
authority to do oversight of the Pen-
tagon and national security policy. 
And on that measure, this year’s bill 
is an incredibly important piece of leg-
islation. To begin with, we address the 
issue of diversity within the military. I 
really want to thank the Congressional 
Black Caucus and the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus, specifically ANTHONY 
BROWN, VERONICA ESCOBAR, and RUBEN 
GALLEGO
for putting forward policy 
that will address the diversity prob-
lems that we have. 
Mr. Speaker, our military right now 
in its leadership and in its recruitment 
does not adequately reflect the diver-
sity of this country. This bill puts in 
place a chief diversity officer at the 
Pentagon and takes a number of other 
steps to try to correct that, to make 
sure that we have a military that re-
flects diversity of this country and 
that meets the equity and social jus-
tice requirements. I think that is an 
incredibly important policy statement, 
and a step forward. 
We also implement a number of the 
provisions from a defense policy board 
led by Eric Schmidt and Bob Work fo-
cusing on artificial intelligence. I 
heard some Members speaking earlier 
about the importance of that. We have 
a series of recommendations for how 
the Department of Defense can do a 
better job of getting AI right, devel-
oping the technology and using it, but 
also broader technologies as well. The 
Pentagon is woefully behind right now 
in taking advantage of the tech-
nologies that are crucial to getting us 
the proper defense going forward. I 
think that is incredibly important. 
Mr. Speaker, we also have a provision 
that Ranking Member THORNBERRY 
worked on. It is not the most sexy or 
exciting thing in the world. It is 300 
pages of cleaning up the technical 
problems within the acquisition proc-
ess at the Pentagon, but it is crucially 
important. 
We have so many innovative tech-
nologies, so many small businesses out 
there that are generating great ideas 
that would be terrific for the Pentagon, 
but they can’t get in. They can’t pene-
trate the bureaucracy and figure out 
how to even do business, so most of 
them walk away. It is crucially impor-
tant that we take steps to fix that. 
We also have a provision I have 
worked on a lot dealing with satellites 
and launch. Same thing—encourage 
competition, 
encourage 
innovation. 
Regrettably, the Pentagon has a some-
what understandable bias towards in-
cumbents. They also have a bias to-
wards large companies. But what that 
does is it makes it harder for that in-
novation, for those new technologies 
that are crucial to get through. We 
make changes to address that. 
We also have a provision in this bill 
to deal with Agent Orange, to make

sure that we are taking care of our 
troops, because that is a crucial part of 
our oversight as well, to make sure 
that once the fighting is done, we don’t 
forget the people who fought, that we 
help them. 
For too long, veterans have not been 
able to access the healthcare they de-
serve. This bill addresses that. I know 
that MARK TAKANO and JOSH HARDER 
on our side worked very hard on that 
issue and I thank them for that. It is 
crucially important. 
Mr. Speaker, I also take a moment to 
address the concerns that Representa-
tive GAETZ raised. He is not accurate in 
saying that we stop the President from 
being able to move troops. All we do in 
Afghanistan is we say, Make sure you 
give us a reason. And then, frankly, if 
the President doesn’t give us a reason, 
he can exercise a national security 
waiver and not follow our advice. It is 
simply advice that says, Yes, in our 
opinion, we need to get out of Afghani-
stan, but we need to do it responsibly. 
b 1230 
It is a way crazy overstatement to 
say that we prevent a Chief Executive 
from pulling out of Afghanistan. This 
bill does not do that. It merely says, if 
you are going to do it, make sure that 
you do it right so that we protect our 
troops as we make that decision. 
I think that is not an accurate de-
scription of what this bill does. 
But overall, I want to remind people, 
it is incredibly important that we pass 
this piece of legislation for a couple of 
basic reasons. 
Number one, we are the legislative 
body. The one thing we have in com-
mon—House, Senate, Democrat, Repub-
lican—is that we are all legislators. We 
all represent people. If we don’t do our 
job, if we don’t pass this bill and exer-
cise oversight, we are ceding authority 
to the executive branch, authority that 
is too great already. I think Democrats 
and Republicans agree on this as well. 
Granted, when there is a Democratic 
President, Republicans are more enthu-
siastic about it, and when there is a 
Republican President, Democrats are 
more enthusiastic about it. But we all 
agree there is too much executive 
power and not enough legislative over-
sight. 
Let’s not walk away from our biggest 
opportunity every year to exercise that 
legislative oversight. This is a good 
bill. If we don’t do this, we are not ful-
filling one key aspect of our duties to 
our constituents. 
Also, the legislative process itself, I 
think, is incredibly important. These 
are times when we have a deeply di-
vided Nation and a deeply divided Con-
gress, but that is precisely the moment 
when legislative authority is so impor-
tant. It is how we come together and 
solve problems. 
I will tell you, Senator INHOFE and I 
disagree on a lot. We also do not have 
a lot in common. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. Speaker, we have come together 
on this bill because we recognize the 
importance of that process. You have 
to learn how to work with people you 
disagree with in order for civil society 
to function. That is what we have done. 
Now, sadly, this is the only con-
ference report that we will vote on this 
session. I think it might be the only 
one we have voted on in the last 2 
years. I could be wrong about that. But 
if not, it is one of the precious few. 
That shows you how far we are drifting 
away from exercising our responsibil-
ities. 
If Senator INHOFE and I can come to-
gether and agree on this, then I think 
we can all understand that this is a 
good bipartisan compromise that we all 
should support. 
I want to close by thanking the staff. 
I have not worked with a better group 
of people on anything I have ever done 
in my life; the House staff, the Senate 
staff, all outstanding people doing a 
difficult job. 
I also want to do something I haven’t 
done before, and that is specifically 
thank the legislative counsel and also 
apologize. Every year, we put this bill 
together seemingly at the last minute. 
It is a very big bill. We come up with 
our ideas, we turn them over to the 
legislative counsel at 2 o’clock in the 
morning on Sunday, and say, ‘‘Please 
do this.’’ 
I am sorry. We are going to try to do 
better in the future. But thank you, 
thank you, thank you for the out-
standing work that you do. 
Lastly, I want to thank MAC. This 
bill was named after him—over his ob-
jection, by the way. He has done an 
outstanding job as chairman and as 
ranking member of this committee. He 
will be missed. I really thank him for 
his leadership. Without him, this would 
not be possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. TURNER). 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
continue our chairman’s lauding of the 
career of MAC THORNBERRY, again, over 
his objections. In my 18 years that I 
have served in Congress, I can tell you, 
not only has his leadership been essen-
tial on the Armed Services Committee, 
but his time, both as chairman and 
ranking member, has been incredibly 
important. He has served the Nation 
well. 
I want to thank Chairman SMITH for 
his leadership. We have truly a bipar-
tisan bill in front of us, and it is a re-
sult of MAC
THORNBERRY
and ADAM 
SMITH, their work to try to ensure that 
we do put America first. 
Contrary to the prior speaker—before 
we began to debate this bill, we heard 
accusations that this did not put 
America first. This puts America first. 
What is essential about this is that our 
adversaries are gaining on our capabili-
ties. They are investing in moderniza-
tion. They are investing in capabilities 
that will threaten our ability to ensure 
our safety and our liberty. This bill is 
about America first. 
I would like to highlight a few key 
issues in this bill. 
First, the conference report fully au-
thorizes the administration’s budget 
request for the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration. These funds are 
critical to ensuring our nuclear weap-
ons enterprise remains safe, secure, 
and effective going into the future. We 
have put off needed investment too 
long. There is no longer any margin of 
error or delay. Now, the NNSA must 
transform 
from 
a 
culture 
of 
sustainment and maintenance to a cul-
ture of development and manufac-
turing to meet the nuclear safety envi-
ronment of the future. 
Second, I am pleased that the con-
ference report removes a provision that 
would have prohibited the NNSA from 
conducting necessary testing and ex-
perimentation. 
Next, the conference report funds the 
ground based strategic deterrent, the 
replacement for the Minuteman III, 
which has provided the Nation with a 
nuclear security umbrella for half a 
century. Transition to the ground- 
based strategic deterrent will be one of 
the most complex projects the Federal 
Government has ever undertaken. 
The bill also continues the progress 
of Space Force, and the bill makes seri-
ous investments in missile defense by 
funding the Missile Defense Agency’s 
highest unfunded priorities. It author-
izes funds for nine SM–3 Block IIA mis-
siles and a new THAAD battery. 
The conference report also includes a 
provision directing the DOD to collabo-
rate with research centers so that we 
can bring forward information on our 
adversaries and what they are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to 
vote for this bill. It is important for 
the future and the security of America. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Emerg-
ing Threats and Capabilities, and I 
thank him for his leadership. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the conference re-
port to accompany H.R. 6395, the Wil-
liam M. (Mac) Thornberry National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021. I have served with Ranking Mem-
ber MAC
THORNBERRY
for nearly 20 
years, and I thank him for his service 
to the Nation and for his bipartisan 
leadership. 
Mac, it has been an honor, and you 
will be missed. 
I congratulate my colleagues, par-
ticularly Chairman ADAM SMITH, for 
his leadership in crafting the National 
Defense Authorization Act for the 60th 
consecutive year. 
The portions of the NDAA under my 
purview provide direction and over-
sight for Special Operations Forces and

the defense intelligence enterprise. The 
bill 
supports 
scientists 
and 
funds 
STEM programs that will diversify our 
workforce. It also advances several pol-
icy priorities in artificial intelligence 
and 
cyberspace, 
including 
27 
rec-
ommendations from the Cyberspace 
Solarium Commission on which I serve. 
Among the most important, notably, 
this bill establishes a long-overdue pro-
vision that I authored, the Senate-con-
firmed national cyber director within 
the Executive Office of the President. 
The national cyber director will be the 
singular point of strategy development 
and implementation and will provide 
vital coordination to keep us safe in 
cyberspace. 
This bill also funds two Virginia- 
class submarines and the first Colum-
bia-class submarine. I was proud to 
work with Chairman COURTNEY to fight 
cuts to the President’s budget that 
would have eliminated a Virginia-class 
submarine. I am equally proud to rep-
resent the workers in Rhode Island who 
make such important and unique con-
tributions to building the most sophis-
ticated weapons systems ever built, 
which are vital to our national secu-
rity. 
In all of my efforts on the NDAA, I 
have been privileged to serve with my 
ranking 
member, 
Congresswoman 
ELISE STEFANIK, by my side. I thank 
her for her contributions and her com-
mitment to bipartisanship. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
and the staff on the Intelligence and 
Emerging 
Threats 
and 
Capabilities 
Subcommittee and my personal staff 
for their tireless efforts to get the 
NDAA across the finish line. 
Finally, this bill provides a 3 percent 
pay raise for our men and women in 
uniform, although no price can ever be 
put on their invaluable service. Every 
day, servicemembers put their lives on 
the line to protect our way of life and 
keep us safe at home, and we owe them 
an enormous debt of gratitude that we 
can never repay. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan commitment to 
national security. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to say our country and our mili-
tary are a better place because of 
Ranking Member THORNBERRY’s hard 
work, involvement, and dedication. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the conference report to ac-
company H.R. 6395, the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
This NDAA continues the Armed Serv-
ices Committee’s commendable bipar-
tisan tradition. 
I am particularly happy with the fol-
lowing aspects of the conference report 
that affect readiness. 
It authorizes over $250 billion for op-
erations and maintenance, including 
facilities sustainment and $8 billion in 
new military construction. 
It reforms logistics and sustainment 
to better align the Department’s sup-
port to the National Defense Strategy 
while ensuring that sustainment plan-
ning is emphasized early in major 
weapon system acquisition. 
It extends critical land withdrawals 
for the Navy and the Air Force to per-
form training activities at the Fallon 
Range Training Complex and the Ne-
vada Test and Training Range. These 
are vital to the readiness of our avia-
tion forces. 
It provides the Air Force with much- 
needed flexibility to synchronize mili-
tary construction and weapons system 
fielding for the ground-based strategic 
deterrent system. 
It continues to reform military fam-
ily housing with better remediation of 
severe environmental hazards. 
These are just some of the important 
improvements in readiness that the 
NDAA accomplishes. 
I want to thank Chairman SMITH and 
Ranking Member THORNBERRY for their 
leadership to complete the NDAA, 
along with Readiness Subcommittee 
Chairman JOHN GARAMENDI. 
Passing this bill signals the clear 
support of Congress to our military 
members and their families. If not en-
acted, these critical readiness authori-
ties and vital matters like military pay 
raises will not happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the conference report. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT-
NEY), 
the 
chairman 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Seapower and Projection 
Forces. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the 2021 William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Au-
thorization Act. 
I want to begin by congratulating 
Chairman SMITH and Mr. THORNBERRY 
for their persistent teamwork in bring-
ing this bill to fruition. It is the way 
Congress is supposed to work. 
Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on 
Seapower and Projection Forces made 
a significant mark in this year’s bill. 
Last February, the President’s budget, 
out of nowhere, cut the Navy’s ship-
building budget by 17 percent, includ-
ing the removal of an entire Virginia- 
class attack submarine, with no ration-
ale or 30-year shipbuilding plan, as re-
quired by law. 
Our subcommittee led the way in 
fully restoring that submarine, having 
listened to the combatant commanders 
who have articulated the need for that 
repeatedly, and adding a fast transport 
ship, bringing the total new ships in 
this bill to nine, two more than re-
quested in the Trump budget. 
We also focused attention on our do-
mestic sealift fleet. The final bill au-
thorizes half a billion dollars for the 
Maritime Security Program to miti-
gate the impacts of COVID–19 on our 
domestic sealift fleet and creates a new 
tanker security fleet aimed at address-
ing alarming gaps in at-sea logistics. 
The bill enhances crucial airlift pro-
grams by funding our next-generation 
refueler, the KC–46A, and rejecting 
harmful cuts in our refueling fleet. 
The final agreement also includes a 
provision that sets a firm floor in sup-
port of more than a dozen State Gov-
ernors’ requests to preserve the C–130 
aircraft for the Air National Guard. 
Mr. Speaker, this is truly a bipar-
tisan bill that represents the hard 
work and input of Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Thank you to my friend, Ranking 
Member ROB WITTMAN, for his amazing 
friendship and work, and our col-
leagues on the subcommittee for their 
hard work in crafting this year’s bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote today. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of the conference report 
to accompany the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
For the past 59 years, Congress has 
passed the NDAA on a bipartisan basis 
for one simple reason: Politics must 
never, ever stand between the Amer-
ican people and the security of our 
country. This record of bipartisan 
unity is unrivaled in our history and a 
testament to what we can do when we 
come together to ensure that the needs 
of our Nation are met. 
As a conferee, I can proudly say that 
this bill wisely balances the differences 
between each Chamber and puts Amer-
ica’s security first. 
Let me say at the outset that I am in 
agreement with the President’s con-
cerns about section 230 and the need to 
deny broad immunity to tech compa-
nies that abuse legal protections to 
censor voices that do not share their 
particular political viewpoints. 
However, as important as this issue 
is, it falls outside the jurisdiction of 
this bill and deserves its own debate 
and a separate vote so that every Mem-
ber of Congress is on record where they 
stand. For Members considering to 
vote ‘‘no’’ because of this issue, ask 
yourself: Do you think you will get a 
better bill in 2 months? The answer is 
no. 
I wish to commend the outstanding 
leadership of Chairman SMITH and my 
friend MAC THORNBERRY for navigating 
this bill through conference. Under 
their leadership, this legislation will 
continue the readiness recovery we 
began 4 years ago. 
It will fully fund modernization of 
our strategic nuclear deterrence. It en-
sures America’s military advantage 
well into the future with necessary in-
vestments in air, land, sea, space, and 
cyberspace. It directs the Secretary of 
Defense to establish emergency med-
ical surge partnerships with Federal, 
State, and local entities, universities, 
and private healthcare providers to 
prepare for future pandemics. It keeps 
the faith of our servicemembers and 
military families.

December 8, 2020 
This bill also provides long-overdue 
support and relief to veterans suffering 
from toxic exposure. As an airman who 
deployed four times, I served with 
many who were exposed to burn pits 
and now suffer from tumors in their 
lungs. This bill grants presumptive 
benefits for veterans suffering from 
these illnesses and requires the VA to 
fast-track disability statuses. 
So this conference report provides 
our servicemembers the tools they 
need to defend America. On the 60th 
consecutive NDAA, I am proud to have 
helped craft this bill, and I thank the 
statesmanship of MAC
THORNBERRY, 
whose name it bears. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1245 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him and Mr. THORNBERRY
for their 
leadership in bringing this legislation 
to the floor in a strong bipartisan way. 
I am proud to support the 2021 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act that 
honors our values, strengthens our se-
curity, and advances our leadership in 
the world. 
I, again, salute Chairman SMITH. I 
congratulate Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY for his service in the Congress. I 
know this legislation is named for him. 
That is pretty exciting for all of us. I 
don’t know if it is for him, but it is ex-
citing for the rest of us. 
I thank the members of the com-
mittee for their patriotic, persistent 
leadership on this legislation; it re-
flects the brilliance and the collabora-
tion we can have. Nearly half the mem-
bers contributed to parts of this bill. 
While we would have liked to have 
seen the House version of this legisla-
tion, we can all take pride that the 
NDAA, again, will strengthen our na-
tional security for years to come. 
I am particularly pleased with some 
of the issues in the bill that are sup-
portive of our troops. This NDAA, Mr. 
Speaker, incorporates key Democratic 
priorities, including supporting our 
troops’ financial security, authorizing 
a long-overdue pay raise and hazard 
duty pay, extending paid parental leave 
to civilian employees who had not been 
included, and providing long-overdue 
benefits to Vietnam-era veterans ex-
posed to Agent Orange. 
This issue has been an issue for a 
long time in our country and in this 
Congress, and it needed some expan-
sion. I am glad in this legislation the 
exposure extends to hypothyroidism, 
bladder cancer, and Parkinson’s. If you 
are there and you have this, it is con-
nected. 
Mr. Speaker, I am personally inter-
ested in this because many years ago, 
before I was in Congress, in our com-
munity in California, we had a big—in 
LA, actually, we had a big hunger 
strike by Vietnam vets over Agent Or-
ange. This was, like, 35 years ago, long 
before Congress acted on this. They 
were on a hunger strike, and I went to 
be sympathetic and show support. I 
was chair of the California Democratic 
Party at the time. 
Dick Gregory came. Dick Gregory 
had been on many hunger strikes for 
one thing or another, civil rights, this 
and that. He taught them that, if you 
are on a hunger strike, you must show-
er, you must hydrate, hydrate, hy-
drate; telling them how not to make 
themselves sick because they were on a 
hunger strike, but to control that dam-
age. 
I was particularly pleased to be there 
with Dick Gregory because my brother 
and he served in the Army in Texas to-
gether. In those days—that was in the 
fifties, a long time ago—my brother 
was Dick Gregory’s friend, at a time 
when there wasn’t so much, shall we 
say, integration among the troops. So 
we had that personal connection. 
Then, once again, with our Vietnam- 
era vets, when it came to Agent Or-
ange. So I commend you all personally, 
patriotically, and in every way for tak-
ing care of our vets there. 
Then the families, defending their 
health and well-being and that of their 
families, improving housing and access 
to childcare, improving pandemic re-
sponse, protecting military commu-
nities from dangerous PFAS chemicals, 
and addressing sexual assault in the 
military. 
JACKIE SPEIER has been such a cham-
pion on that issue, and I thank her for 
that. 
Combating our adversaries and in-
vesting in our allies with important 
tools to deter China and Russia, fight 
transnational 
threats, 
and 
further 
strengthening our partnership with 
Israel. 
Bringing our defense further into the 
21st century with reforms to make the 
Pentagon more efficient and innova-
tive, important bipartisan provisions 
on 
artificial 
intelligence, 
cyber-
security, and key investments in mili-
tary construction and base realign-
ment. 
This NDAA is momentous in this re-
spect, as Congress comes together on a 
bipartisan and bicameral basis to begin 
the process of changing the names of 
military 
bases 
and 
infrastructure 
named after individuals who served in 
the Confederacy. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important to know 
that this isn’t names of things that, oh, 
my gosh, later we found out that so- 
and-so did this and that, that was so 
wrong. This was a decision made to 
name these bases after people, White 
supremacists, and those who were part 
of the Confederacy. The men for whom 
these bases were named are not heroes. 
They are named for traitors who took 
up arms against America and killed 
American soldiers in defense of slav-
ery. 
As I have said before, there is no 
room for celebrating the violent big-
otry of the men of the Confederacy in 
any place of honor across our country, 
whether in the hallowed Halls of the 
United States Capitol or on our mili-
tary bases. 
Changing the hateful names of these 
bases is supported by an overwhelming 
majority of the American people, by 
our 
Active 
Duty 
servicemen 
and 
-women, and by top military leaders. 
And now the President has threat-
ened to veto this legislation. I hope 
not. I hope not. This bipartisan policy 
bill has been signed into law for 59 con-
secutive years. Let us urge the Presi-
dent to a show respect for the work of 
the bipartisan, bicameral Congress, and 
for the sacrifice of our military. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote for this legislation, which 
upholds our values, honors our troops, 
and keeps the America people safe. And 
I hope that it will be swiftly signed 
into law. 
I just want to make the further point 
that the strength of our Nation, of 
course, depends on our strength that 
we are talking about here, but it also 
depends on the health and well-being of 
the American people. So as we have our 
budget debate and the rest, let us rec-
ognize that the health and well-being 
of the American people, whether it is 
the education of our children, the secu-
rity of our economy, and the rest, and 
so many other aspects of our budgeting 
here, that this is one element of the 
strength of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I 
congratulate Mr. THORNBERRY for his 
namesake bill, and I acknowledge the 
great leadership of our chair, ADAM 
SMITH. I want to also acknowledge AN-
THONY BROWN, who did such a tremen-
dous 
piece 
of 
work 
on 
the 
base 
renamings. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 6395, the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
I am grateful that this bill bears the 
name of a public servant who has 
fought tirelessly throughout his 26 
years in Congress for our men and 
women in uniform, and whose steadfast 
and wise leadership has made such a 
difference. This legislation is a fitting 
tribute to his enduring legacy. 
As ranking member of the Tactical 
Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, I 
am pleased this conference agreement 
builds on the progress we have made in 
rebuilding 
military 
readiness 
after 
years of deferred modernization. 
Through 
targeted 
oversight, 
this 
agreement will set the right conditions 
to ensure needed capabilities required 
for the national defense strategy and 
credible deterrence are delivered in a 
timely manner to maintain our com-
petitive edge against Russia and China. 
A few examples of these critical ca-

F–35 Joint Strike Fighters for a total 
of 93 F–35 aircraft; funding for 24 F–18 
Super Hornets to include an additional 
$28 million for advance procurement; 
strong support for the Army’s identi-
fied big six modernization priorities, 
such as future vertical lift and long- 
range precision fires; an additional $104 
million for Army Ammunition Plant 
modernization; and an additional $150 
million for National Guard and Reserve 
Component Equipment modernization. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to, 
again, thank Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY for his leadership, thank Chair-
man ADAM SMITH for his steadfast and 
fair handling of the committee and this 
vital bill, and thank our subcommittee 
chairman, DONALD NORCROSS, for his 
spirit of bipartisanship. 
In addition, this conference report 
wouldn’t be possible without the hard 
work and dedication of the entire sub-
committee staff, and I thank them all. 
The NDAA has always been a product 
of bipartisan consensus, whose purpose 
has always been to support our troops 
and to protect American national secu-
rity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6395 for the 
60th year in a row. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Mili-
tary Personnel. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for the time and for his 
outstanding leadership, patience, and 
perseverance. 
I also thank Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY for his many years of distin-
guished service to our Nation, both in 
the military and in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member of the committee, Mr. KELLY; 
also the committee staff, Craig, David, 
Hannah; and my personal staff, Josh, 
Brian, and Luke. 
Before I speak about the conference 
agreement, I feel like I must speak 
about the Fort Hood Independent Re-
view, which was ordered after Spe-
cialist Vanessa Guillen’s murder. This 
is the report. It is being released in a 
matter of 3 minutes by the Secretary 
of the Army. I won’t go into details, 
but I will say that it is a damning ex-
pose of a system at Fort Hood that 
does a shameful disservice to the sac-
rifices of our servicemembers and their 
families. 
The report makes clear what I have 
been saying since before I was on the 
Armed Services Committee, that the 
Army sexual assault and harassment 
response has failed, that servicemem-
bers are afraid to report, believe they 
will not be taken seriously and will be 
retaliated against, and that major sys-
temic changes are needed, including 
greater independence from the chain of 
command for handling sexual assault 
and harassment. 
Any parent reading this report would 
have to ask themselves: Is my son or 
daughter safe in the military? 
This bill is not perfect. Important 
provisions on sexual assault and do-
mestic violence were left out. But this 
conference 
agreement 
would 
make 
progress, including a new confidential 
reporting option for sexual harassment 
and a provision to ensure that service-
members who report sexual assault are 
not disciplined for related minor in-
fractions. 
It also includes a pay raise for serv-
icemembers, long-overdue provisions to 
promote racial and gender equity with-
in the armed services, including goals 
for accessions and promotions of per-
sons of color and women, as well as the 
creation of a new deputy inspector gen-
eral for diversity and inclusion that 
will investigate White supremacists’ 
activities by servicemembers. 
Additionally, the bill expands sup-
port for childcare and provides for ex-
ceptional family member services. 
Therefore, I will be voting for the 
bill, and I hope my colleagues will join 
me in this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to recognize that this is just 
the beginning. We have more to do. 
More lives are lost and must be ac-
counted for. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. STEFANIK). 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this bipartisan 
bill. 
As the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Emerg-
ing Threats and Capabilities, I am I 
proud of our oversight and legislative 
activities this year, which have in-
cluded recharging our science and tech-
nology enterprise, strengthening our 
Nation’s cybersecurity, expanding the 
resources and authorities for irregular 
warfare activities across the globe, and 
bolstering our biological threat and 
pandemic preparedness efforts. 
Two years ago, I introduced legisla-
tion in the NDAA that created the Na-
tional Security Commission on Artifi-
cial Intelligence with the purpose of 
accelerating and advancing the devel-
opment of AI across the Federal Gov-
ernment. I applaud the commission for 
their work on this important issue, and 
I am pleased that this conference re-
port includes 17 of those recommenda-
tions, including elevating the role of 
the Joint AI Center; modernizing how 
the DOD attracts and retains AI talent; 
and ensuring our AI research eco-
system maintains its competitive ad-
vantage over China. 
b 1300 
Second, this bill extends and expands 
the opportunities for our Special Oper-
ations Forces to partner with foreign 
forces, build critical relationships, and 
more effectively counter the malign in-
fluences of Russia and China. This bill 
also ensures that all of our Special Op-
erations Forces—active duty, reserve, 
National Guard and their families are 
provided the care and support that 
they deserve. 
Third, this bill takes concrete steps 
to 
protect 
critical 
defense 
tech-
nologies, strengthen cybersecurity co-
operation with the defense industrial 
base, and rebuild our domestic manu-
facturing 
capabilities 
for 
sensitive 
microelectronics 
and 
semiconductor 
components. This bill brings trans-
parency to Federally funded research 
while at the same time restricting for-
eign influence on our university cam-
puses. 
As the chief advocate for Fort Drum 
and the 10th Mountain Division, I am 
proud to deliver results for the Army’s 
most deployed division since 9/11. This 
year’s NDAA addresses our homeland 
missile defense, as Fort Drum is named 
as the preferred East Coast missile de-
fense site. I am also proud to include 
provisions that require plans for ren-
ovating child development centers and 
review of IT infrastructure enhance-
ments at Army mission training com-
plexes. These provisions are critical to 
enhance readiness and ensure the 10th 
Mountain Division can conduct safe 
and secure operations. 
I recognize my partner, my col-
league, Congressman JIM LANGEVIN of 
Rhode Island. And lastly, I thank 
Ranking Member THORNBERRY for his 
extraordinary leadership and guidance, 
not only this year, but in many years 
of his truly exemplary service. He is a 
giant in the people’s House, and he will 
be sorely missed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill and vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER), 
the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Strategic Forces. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I am pleased to support the fiscal 
year 2021 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. Thankfully, maintaining a 
tradition of bipartisanship to get the 
60th, a record, National Defense Au-
thorization Act through the House and 
then through conference with the Sen-
ate is no small feat, particularly dur-
ing a global pandemic. 
I thank, in particular, our out-
standing Chairman SMITH and Ranking 
Member THORNBERRY for their leader-
ship, as well as Ranking Member MIKE 
TURNER for his partnership in the Stra-
tegic Forces Subcommittee, and all of 
the conferees for getting to this point. 
In particular, I would like to thank 
Ranking Member THORNBERRY for his 
extraordinary leadership on the HASC 
over the last 6 years, and I am happy to 
congratulate my friend and colleague, 
MIKE ROGERS, as the next HASC rank-
ing member. 
The Strategic Forces provisions in 
the bill would not have been in place 
without the outstanding staff work of 
Leonor Tomero, Maria Vastola, and 
Grant Schneider as the lead staffers. 
These provisions support our nuclear 
forces and nuclear nonproliferation. 
They also enhance oversight of the 
warhead acquisition and plutonium pit 
production programs, which continue 
to be major undertakings.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6924 
December 8, 2020 
The conference report supports re-
gional missile defense efforts, restores 
funding to critical radar discrimina-
tion capabilities, and provides needed 
oversight on the next generation of 
interceptors in order to ensure fly-be-
fore-you-buy principles in this $10 bil-
lion program. 
The report acknowledges the in-
creased focus on development and de-
livery 
of 
conventional 
hypersonic 
weapons, while also initiating efforts 
to address broad policy concerns re-
garding the risk of miscalculation as 
these new strategic-level weapons are 
fielded. 
With regard to the rapidly trans-
forming space domain, the conference 
report supports innovative commercial 
capabilities, 
competition, 
and 
the 
emergence of small-launch providers to 
provide national security as well as the 
codification of the Space Development 
Agency’s mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote in 
favor of this conference report. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
KELLY). 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
As ranking member of the Military 
Personnel Subcommittee, I stand be-
fore you today in proud support of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2021. The conference report 
reflects bipartisan compromise that 
has been a hallmark of this committee 
for 59 consecutive years. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act has always been about ensuring 
the national defense of the United 
States, which would be impossible 
without appropriate focus on the men 
and women who tirelessly serve this 
country; and appropriate focus on their 
families who serve this great Nation by 
supporting their loved ones time and 
again; through the deployments, the 
training periods and all the challenges 
of day-to-day living. We owe them a 
great debt of gratitude. The NDAA also 
preserves a number of robust TRICARE 
and retirement benefits for our retir-
ees. 
To this end, we addressed a number 
of significant and overdue policy issues 
that would directly improve the qual-
ity of life of our servicemembers and 
their families. 
The NDAA authorizes a 3 percent in-
crease in basic pay for servicemembers. 
It also standardizes the payment of 
hazardous duty incentive pay and in-
creases hazardous duty pay from $250 
to $275 a month for members of the uni-
formed services. 
The NDAA reinforces the commit-
tee’s longstanding commitment to the 
military family by requiring the De-
partment of Defense to redefine mili-
tary family readiness and military per-
sonnel resiliency, and it provides for 
significant reforms in the Exceptional 
Family Member Program. 
Of course, the NDAA also addresses 
COVID–19. 
This is an outstanding bipartisan 
NDAA dedicated to our servicemem-
bers, military families, and retirees, 
and gives them the care and support 
they need, deserve, and have earned. 
I thank my staff, Sergeant Major 
Jeremy Barton, my Army Fellow; Rod-
ney Hall, my MLA; and our MILPER 
staff, Glen Diehl and Paul Golden. I 
thank Chairwoman SPEIER for working 
together with me to do a great Mili-
tary Personnel mark. Finally, I thank 
MAC
THORNBERRY, a mentor, leader, 
and friend. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS), the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Tactical Air and Land Forces. 
Mr. 
NORCROSS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
certainly for his leadership in bringing 
this conference report to the floor for 
the 60th year. And certainly, I take a 
moment to thank MAC THORNBERRY, 
who this conference report is named 
after, for his leadership, and certainly 
MIKE ROGERS. They are the type of 
Members that we all should look to-
ward in terms of being bipartisan and 
working toward a goal. 
Mr. Speaker, this conference report 
continues the Tactical Air and Land 
Forces Subcommittee’s long tradition 
of bipartisanship to make America’s 
Armed Forces the best in the world. I 
commend the hard work of our Mem-
bers, my colleagues, our staff, cer-
tainly in these unusual and demanding 
circumstances 
brought 
on 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
I 
also 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
HARTZLER for her leadership and com-
mitment to working toward a goal of 
keeping America safe. Our cooperation 
has kept us focused on what is truly 
important. We have delivered a defense 
bill that meets the modernization and 
readiness needs of our Nation’s air and 
land forces. 
This bill carefully manages our mili-
tary resources while increasing the De-
partment of Defense program oversight 
to make sure that we do our job, par-
ticularly in the F–35, our most ad-
vanced weapons system and also the 
most expensive in U.S. history. 
But we are also looking at manned 
and unmanned intelligence, surveil-
lance and reconnaissance aircraft, and 
continued oversight of the Army’s new 
modernization strategy with respect to 
Army aviation, including the CH–47 
Chinook helicopter. 
Also, I take a moment for our na-
tional defense and the priorities of 
keeping America safe and New Jersey 
safe while ensuring the KC–10 refuelers 
are not retired prematurely and mak-
ing sure the KC–46s are being delivered 
on time. 
I am grateful this bill includes that 3 
percent pay raise, taking care of mili-
tary families and also providing afford-
able childcare on bases. Making sure 
that your children are safe is incred-
ibly important. 
I am proud of the hard work this 
committee has done to continue to 
serve America’s national security in-
terests. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our 
support, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITT-
MAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. THORNBERRY for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in a period of 
great power competition. These are not 
just words; this is our new reality. We 
are seeing Russian, Chinese, Iranian, 
and North Korean aggression on a glob-
al scale. This is why I am confounded 
by some pundits who believe cutting 
defense spending at a time of great 
power competition is in our best inter-
est. Anything less than our negotiated 
defense topline is capitulating our 
global standing to an ever-expanding 
China and Russia hegemony. 
Additionally, there are some who be-
lieve that we should not pass this de-
fense bill this Congress. I want to re-
mind my friends that we are already 68 
days late in delivering this defense bill 
to our Nation. Harmed by our delay is 
almost $8 billion in troop military con-
struction. Harmed by our inaction is 
the potential shuttering of our Air 
Force’s and Navy’s premier training 
ranges at Nellis and Fallon. And most 
importantly, harmed by our continuing 
neglect are the countless servicemem-
bers who rely on us for reasonable pay 
and benefits to support our national se-
curity. We must do better. 
As to my Seapower and Projection 
Forces Subcommittee, our conference 
is all about great power competition. 
We authorize an additional Virginia 
class submarine and eight additional 
P–8 submarine hunting aircraft to par-
tially offset these great power ad-
vances. We pay down future readiness 
with our continued support of the next- 
generation bomber and Columbia-class 
ballistic missile submarine programs. 
And finally, we procure the long-ne-
glected logistics that are essential to 
power projection. This is a strong mark 
to pay down our generation’s contribu-
tion to our Nation ‘s future. 
While I want to acknowledge Chair-
men Smith and Courtney’s leadership 
in their efforts as chairman of the full 
committee 
and 
chairman 
of 
the 
Seapower and Projection Forces Sub-
committee, I want to particularly 
thank MAC THORNBERRY for his 26 years 
of Congressional service. MAC, thank 
you so much for your leadership, for 
your continued focus and dedication to 
our Nation and to those brave men and 
women that serve this Nation. 
I also thank Congressman MIKE ROG-
ERS and congratulate him on his new 
role as the future Republican leader of 
the House Armed Services Committee. 
MIKE, congratulations. We look for-
ward to the continuation of the legacy 
of leadership from MAC THORNBERRY to 
you. 
We have all seen the great service 
and great stewardship provided by both 
Chairman THORNBERRY and others, and,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6925 
December 8, 2020 
my friends, at this moment this is our 
time. Anything less than action on this 
bill now is turning our backs and ig-
nores the servicemembers and their 
families who continue to serve the Na-
tion. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS). 
I recognize Mrs. DAVIS
is retiring 
after 22 years of service on the com-
mittee. It has been great working with 
her, and I appreciate her leadership. 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, this will be my 20th and final 
NDAA. As I prepare to seek other chal-
lenges, I want to remind my colleagues 
of the incredible work that can get 
done with this legislation, especially 
when patience is required. 
Since joining the Armed Services 
Committee, I have seen our focus 
change. At the height of the wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, we focused on 
the critical needs of our troops fighting 
every day. Now, our focus has shifted 
more towards innovation and future 
needs of our troops. But we can’t forget 
that this bill is not just about spending 
on things, it is about our servicemem-
bers and their families. We cannot for-
get the importance of the sacrifices 
that they make. It is hard to even con-
vey the magnitude of their service. 
The military can enhance perform-
ance by caring for every member of the 
military community, something that 
we hear every day from military lead-
ers that, quite honestly, we didn’t hear 
20 years ago. But there is more work to 
be done. We must ensure no military 
family goes hungry and no military 
spouse is forced to leave the workforce 
because of a military move or lack of 
childcare. 
The military can enhance perform-
ance by fostering an environment 
where the opportunities for advance-
ment include all who are willing to 
work hard. When I began serving on 
the HASC, the idea of women in com-
bat roles or LGBTQ Americans serving 
openly was only a distant dream. 
Today, we understand the importance 
of diversity in our ranks. That stra-
tegic focus brings the best and the 
brightest Americans forward to serve. 
Where any discrimination persists, it 
must end. 
We have focused so much on the pre-
vention of sexual assault and harass-
ment. 
I recently came across a picture 
taken at a breakfast on this issue with 
General James Amos in 2010, then the 
commandant of the Marine Corps. He 
asked one of his mid-level officers if 
she would report an assault if it oc-
curred. She responded unequivocally, 
no. Much to his surprise. 
b 1315 
We have made sincere policy changes 
to address this horrible problem, but 
the fight continues. 
This bipartisan legislation is the cul-
mination of many of the efforts of 
many Members. There is much good in 
it and much that is needed to support 
our servicemembers and their families. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, very 
quickly, our outstanding Chair SMITH, 
our dedicated Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY, and the amazing professional 
staff who made this all possible. I will 
miss them all, and I know the critical 
work in service to our Nation con-
tinues. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Chairman 
ADAM SMITH and Ranking Member MAC 
THORNBERRY for their dedicated work 
on developing this bipartisan bill ap-
propriately named in honor of Chair-
man MAC THORNBERRY, an American 
patriot. 
As a member of the conference com-
mittee, I appreciated the opportunity 
to work on another historically impor-
tant NDAA. Enactment of this bill will 
be the 60th consecutive fiscal year that 
the NDAA has passed, exhibiting the 
true bipartisan nature of the process. 
I am thankful for the provision of a 3 
percent military pay increase, which 
represents the first time in a decade 
the troops have consecutively received 
a salary boost of at least 3 percent. 
The most recent report contains the 
Guardian and Reserve Hazard Duty Pay 
Equity Act, a bipartisan bill intro-
duced with Representative ANDY KIM. I 
was grateful to lead a letter with Rep-
resentative KIM urging its inclusion. 
I am also especially grateful that my 
bill, the Body Armor for Females Mod-
ernization Act, was included to ensure 
that female servicemembers have the 
right equipment from day one. 
This legislation contains the Small 
Manufacturer Cybersecurity Enhance-
ment Act, a bill I introduced with Rep-
resentative JIMMY PANETTA, which will 
allow the Department to partner with 
manufacturing extension partnership 
centers to provide assistance to small 
manufacturers. 
There is full funding for the Ad-
vanced Manufacturing Collaborative at 
USC Aiken and PILT and pit produc-
tion at the Savannah River site. 
It also incorporates a bipartisan bill 
I introduced with Representative ED 
PERLMUTTER to ensure continued fund-
ing for the Office of the Ombudsman in 
the Energy Employees Occupational 
Illness Program. 
I appreciate the success of staff mem-
ber Drew Kennedy and military fellow 
Major Jeremy Tillman. 
I support this conference report, re-
membering 9/11 and the murderous at-
tacks, by defeating the terrorists over-
seas. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote in favor. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN), 
the vice chair of the committee. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman SMITH for his ex-
emplary 
leadership, 
Representative 
THORNBERRY for his career service to 
our men and women in uniform, and 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
for their hard work on this year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
This bill strengthens our military, 
makes our country safer, and provides 
for our servicemembers and their fami-
lies. 
National security isn’t simply de-
fined by the planes and ships we buy, 
but in the values we promote within 
the military and for our Nation. 
This legislation is a significant step 
forward for diversity, inclusion, and 
justice in our Armed Forces, core 
American values that our military 
must promote. 
Today’s military is the most diverse 
in our history, with people of color 
making up more than 40 percent of Ac-
tive-Duty servicemembers. And as our 
country reckons with systemic racism, 
so, too, does our military. 
By affirming our founding values, 
this NDAA enhances military readiness 
and taps into the diverse talents and 
skills of our country. 
We elevate the chief diversity officer 
to report directly to the Secretary of 
Defense and service secretaries. 
We provide for better accountability, 
transparency, and reporting on our di-
versity efforts. 
We 
ensure 
equity 
in 
promotion 
boards by removing pictures and other 
identifying information that could bias 
these processes. Officers will instead be 
judged solely on what matters: their 
performance. 
We foster new leaders in our military 
to reflect the diversity of our country 
and support their career development, 
from Junior ROTC to service acad-
emies and historically Black colleges 
and universities, to our elite units. 
We correct racial inequities in our 
military justice system by appointing 
a deputy inspector general to inves-
tigate racial disparities. 
And after years of delay, we finally 
rename bases and property honoring 
the Confederacy. 
With support from Congress, barrier- 
breaking leaders in our military, and 
the American people, we will lead with 
our values. 
Mr. Speaker, for a more equitable 
country and military, I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the next Re-
publican leader of the House Armed 
Services Committee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Ranking Member THORN-
BERRY and Chairman SMITH for their 
leadership in this essential process to 
ensure America’s security. 
This bill takes important steps for-
ward to confront China by establishing 
the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative. 
It 
is 
vital 
that 
we 
support 
and 
strengthen our allies and partners in 
the region in order to deter the grow-
ing threat from China. 
This NDAA also funds critical invest-
ments here at home that will enable us

to confront the sophisticated threats 
we face from China and Russia. 
The NDAA also includes provisions 
implementing a number of Cyber So-
larium 
recommendations. 
These 
changes will continue to modernize our 
military and civilian cybersecurity ef-
forts. I think that we have only begun 
our work in this area. 
In addition to these cutting-edge 
needs, this conference report also reau-
thorizes the pay to troop deployed in 
combat zones. 
Most importantly, this bill adheres 
to the budget agreement and fully 
funds the President’s budget request. 
Now more than ever, we must reject 
calls for blanket defense cuts from par-
tisans who are using the current crisis 
as an opportunity to push their agenda. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleague MAC THORNBERRY 
for his years of service and dedication 
to the Armed Services Committee. No 
one cares more about our men and 
women in uniform and has been a bet-
ter leader for our conference. We are 
going to miss his passion and dedica-
tion for these issues, and we wish him 
and Sally nothing but the best as they 
go forward. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), a 
member of the committee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the fiscal year 2021 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
This NDAA will provide the tools and 
resources essential to maintaining our 
national security. 
I am pleased that the conference re-
port includes a 3 percent pay raise for 
our troops and invests robustly in ini-
tiatives to compete with China, Russia, 
and others who threaten our security 
around the world. 
The conference report includes vital 
investments in our fleet, our readiness, 
and continued construction of the Vir-
ginia-class submarine and the mod-
ernization of our nuclear deterrence 
through the Columbia-class submarine. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to sup-
porting the final passage of this bipar-
tisan legislation and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), the dis-
tinguished Chair of the Republican 
Conference. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this NDAA conference re-
port named after a true American pa-
triot, our Armed Services Committee 
Ranking Member MAC
THORNBERRY, 
whom we will very much miss and who 
has dedicated his career to serving this 
Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chair-
man of our committee, Mr. SMITH, for 
his work on this bipartisan product. 
Congress has no greater responsi-
bility, Mr. Speaker, than providing for 
the defense of our Nation. 
At a time when the United States 
faces 
the 
most 
complex 
array 
of 
threats in our history, it is incumbent 
upon us to ensure that our service-
members have the tools they need to 
deter and defeat our adversaries. 
The 2021 defense bill before us today 
makes critical progress towards mod-
ernizing our military, supporting our 
military families, protecting supply 
chains, 
and 
deterring 
Russia 
and 
China. 
At this crucial moment when we 
have troops deployed overseas, includ-
ing those from Wyoming’s 153rd, 187th, 
and 243rd Air National Guard units, it 
is imperative that they have the full 
support of the United States Congress 
behind them as they execute their mis-
sions. 
Failure to pass this act would force 
hundreds of thousands of our men and 
women in uniform and their families to 
endure cuts to their pay right before 
the holidays. Over 250,000 military fam-
ilies would lose their hazardous duty 
pay. 
Given the sacrifices they make for all 
of us, our troops should never have 
their livelihoods threatened by polit-
ical battles in Washington, D.C. 
In addition to all that this NDAA 
does to support our troops, it also 
builds on the Trump administration’s 
successful efforts to counter the Chi-
nese 
Communist 
Party, 
including 
through provisions I authored that re-
quire publication of the names of Chi-
nese Communist military companies 
operating in the United States. 
It also includes my bipartisan provi-
sion seeking to reduce DOD’s depend-
ence on China for critical rare earth 
minerals. States like Wyoming are 
blessed with these resources, and we 
must rebuild our Nation’s capacity to 
mine and process rare earths here at 
home. 
This legislation funds the moderniza-
tion of our nuclear triad and contains 
crucial provisions to strengthen our de-
terrence capability in the Indo-Pacific. 
American security requires that we 
maintain a military that is second to 
none, that we arm our troops with the 
world’s best equipment, and that we 
provide for their families. Our men and 
women in uniform put their lives on 
the line to defend our freedom. We owe 
them the tools to do their job. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this year’s NDAA, and I urge all my 
colleagues to vote for it. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. WATERS), 
the distinguished chair of the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
I really want to thank her for her 
leadership. 
The 
Financial 
Services 
Committee provided a number of key 
pieces of legislation on this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the William ‘‘Mac’’ Thorn-
berry National Defense Authorization 
Act, NDAA, for Fiscal Year 2021, for 
which I served as a conferee. 
For several months, I have worked 
with my House and Senate counter-
parts to include 10 measures authored 
by Democratic members of the Finan-
cial Services Committee within the 
NDAA. These bills would help to pro-
tect the U.S. financial system, provide 
more remedies to investors who were 
deceived by corporate wrongdoers, ex-
pand access to housing assistance for 
our veterans, and direct the incoming 
Biden administration to use its full au-
thority to help relieve the student debt 
crisis. 
For years, the issue of shell compa-
nies has been ignored by this Congress. 
This is why one of the first actions I 
took as chair of the committee was to 
move legislation to prevent bad actors 
from using shell companies to hide 
their activities, a provision I have I 
been fighting for for over a decade, and 
I am very pleased it is included in the 
conference agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY from New York for her 
tireless work on this provision and the 
Members and the many outside stake-
holders for their work on all the meas-
ures included in the legislation. 
I am also pleased to see the con-
ference report reflected my work and 
progress ensuring that technologies 
procured by the Department of Defense 
are ethically and responsibly screened 
for potential bias. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BANKS), a distinguished 
member of the committee. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding time 
to me today and for his many years of 
service. America and the world are 
safer today because of MAC
THORN-
BERRY’s service in the United States 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SMITH, the 
chairman of the committee, as well, for 
ensuring that this year’s NDAA is bi-
partisan once again. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to rise most of 
all in support of the aptly named MAC 
THORNBERRY National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
While the bill doesn’t include every-
thing I want it to and there are cer-
tainly items that I wish would be re-
moved, overall, it ensures that our Na-
tion is protected, and it supports our 
men and women in uniform. 
So many in the Trump administra-
tion have warned us for years that 
China is our Nation’s long-term stra-
tegic competitor, and countering China 
is a key focus of the fiscal year 2021 
NDAA. 
Having just been a part of the Future 
of Defense Task Force and the China 
Task Force, I am more motivated than 
ever before to stop the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s egregious affronts on 
the U.S. Government, its citizens, and 
our military. I appreciate the inclusion 
of many important recommendations 
from both of those task force reports in 
this year’s NDAA. 
This NDAA establishes the Pacific 
Deterrence Initiative to strengthen 
U.S. posture and capability in the Indo- 
Pacific region, and it works better with

behavior.

It also protects against Chinese in-
dustrial espionage by requiring a Presi-
dential assessment on how to deter it 
and large-scale cyber threat of intellec-
tual property and personal informa-
tion. 
The NDAA also includes a number of 
protections for Federal investments in 
science and technology by including 
new mandates on university research 
and limiting funding for universities 
with Confucius Institutes, for example. 
These are just some of the very im-
portant provisions in this year’s bill, to 
not just acknowledge the China threat, 
Mr. Speaker, but to address it head-on. 
That is why I urge all of my colleagues 
to vote in favor of this critical legisla-
tion. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank both Mr. SMITH, the chairman of 
the committee, and Mr. THORNBERRY, 
who I have had the opportunity to 
work with through the years. Both of 
them are leaders who have focused on 
America’s well-being, America’s na-
tional security, and the well-being of 
our troops who serve in uniform and 
support those who are at the point of 
the spear. 
I believe that we have and our coun-
try has been advantaged by the leader-
ship of both and by the fact that they 
have been able to work together colle-
gially to accomplish objectives on be-
half of the country, not on behalf of 
party. 
So, I thank both Mr. SMITH, the 
chairman, and Mr. THORNBERRY, the 
ranking member who was the chair-
man. They have both held the respon-
sible positions of leading this com-
mittee and its work. 
I rise in strong support of this year’s 
authorization bill. Let me say at the 
outset, as the majority leader, I sched-
ule legislation for the floor. Mr. SMITH 
and I have had long conversations, and 
Mr. THORNBERRY and I have had con-
versations in the past. 
This bill should not be on the floor in 
December. This bill has historically 
passed in May through the committee 
and has been to the floor before we 
break for the August break. I have had 
discussions with Mr. SMITH and will 
tell successors on the Defense Com-
mittee that it will be my intention to 
urge the committee to mark up its bill 
and have it ready to report to the floor 
by May. 
Now, there have been exigencies from 
time to time which made that impos-
sible. That was certainly the case when 
the government was shut down, and it 
has been this case through the pan-
demic, which has obviously slowed up 
our work as well. 
But I am hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that 
I will be able to bring this bill, at the 
instance of the chairman and the rank-
ing member, to the floor either in late 
May or very early June, the first week 
in June before, frankly, we get to the 
appropriations process, which is really 
how the process ought to work, as op-
posed to the other way around. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a major piece of 
legislation, one of the most important 
we pass each year and one, frankly, 
that we need to pass each year. 
I just said we need to do it in a time-
ly fashion, but it is never too late to do 
the right thing. What we are doing 
today is the right thing, passing a bill 
which provides for the security of our 
country. 
Again, I want to thank both of those 
leaders who I have referenced. This 
conference report will ensure that our 
men and women in uniform can con-
tinue to protect our Nation and meet 
global challenges. 
Now, I hope that President Trump 
does sign this bill. He ought to sign 
this bill. This is about our national se-
curity. It is not about partisanship. 
Taking issue with one provision or an-
other in such a large and important 
bill is no reason to block the whole of 
it. That is particularly true when this 
bill would take a major step forward to 
right a historic wrong. 
But let me say, with respect to a 
veto, I hope the President does not 
veto this. I hope that we have, as pre-
vious 
speakers 
have 
said, 
over-
whelming bipartisan support on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Of course, there are specifics in a bill 
this large where one can say: ‘‘I don’t 
like that provision.’’ Well, I don’t 
think there is a bill that you can’t 
have a significant number or one of us 
say: ‘‘I wish that provision were dif-
ferent.’’ But we ought not to have our 
focus on the doughnut hole. We ought 
to have our focus on the doughnut, on 
the whole of what makes this bill so 
critically important for our country. 
In our founding document, it states 
that all are ‘‘created equal, that they 
are endowed by their creator with cer-
tain unalienable rights, that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness.’’ 
It said: ‘‘All men are created equal.’’ 
None of us would argue that all men 
should be exclusively perceived as 
being created equal. We believe that all 
human 
beings 
are 
created 
equal, 
whether they are men or they are 
women, or they are Black or they are 
White, or they are yellow or they are 
red. Whatever the differences may be, 
it is our perception and articulation in 
this Declaration that it is God who cre-
ated the soul that is colorless, that is 
genderless, that is of no one nation. 
It is the soul that is imbued in us, as 
we say in our Declaration, by our cre-
ator. While these rights may have been 
self-evident, I tell people, they are not 
self-executing. It fell to future genera-
tions of Americans to secure them in 
practice. 
Less than a century after our Na-
tion’s founding, it was torn apart by a 
Civil War, with Southern States wag-
ing war to protect the evil institution 
of slavery. All of us would agree that 
one 
human 
being 
owning 
another 
human being is untenable. But it is 
what we fought a war over. 
The names of those who fought vio-
lently to perpetuate slavery and who 
rebelled against the United States do 
not deserve the honor of being associ-
ated with the installations housing, 
training, and equipping those who 
serve today under our flag of freedom 
and democracy. 
Now, without getting into that argu-
ment, it would have been perverse to 
drop an amendment adopted by 93 per-
cent of the Senate, not because they 
voted on the individual amendment but 
because it was included in the bill and 
93 percent of the Members of the 
United States Senate voted for it. 
It simply says what is the right thing 
to do: remove a name from a base on 
which an African-American sailor, an 
African-American soldier, an African- 
American marine, an African-Amer-
ican coastguardsman serve. An African 
American of whatever service, at what-
ever time, should not have to serve on 
a base named for somebody who be-
lieved 
that 
person 
ought 
to 
be 
enslaved. 
I congratulate both the chairman and 
the ranking member for making sure 
that that language was kept in. I know 
the President has said he doesn’t like 
that language, but as I said, I am con-
vinced that any one of us could point 
to something in this bill we don’t like. 
But we need to keep our eye on the 
ball, the national security of our coun-
try. 
This National Defense Authorization 
Act requires the military to remove 
the names. I think that is appropriate, 
and I congratulate them for leaving 
that language whole. 
I had made it clear that I felt this 
bill needed to pass. But I felt that if 
that provision were left out, it would 
be inappropriate to put it on the floor. 
Additionally, I also want to mention 
that this conference report will ensure 
that all Federal employees can access 
12 weeks of paid parental leave. That is 
now the practice in most, if not all, 
certainly, but many of the largest cor-
porations in our country. Why? Be-
cause they believe it is good for their 
employees. They believe it is good for 
their children. They believe it is good 
for America. We have now adopted 
that, and I praise the committee for 
doing so. 
Unfortunately, some Federal employ-
ees were left out last year when we en-
acted paid parental leave, and we have 
now included them. Today, we are fix-
ing that and making sure that it ap-
plies to all Federal workers. 
Mr. Speaker, it is also important 
that we are able to include language in 
the conference report that will close 
corporate loopholes, which were re-
ferred to by Ms. WATERS, the chair of 
the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee, 
eliminating loopholes which allowed

dark money to enter the U.S. financial 
system from Russia and other malign 
actors. 
That beneficial ownership provision 
is a major win in the fight against for-
eign kleptocrats and oligarchs seeking 
to undermine America’s security and 
fund those who wish to do us harm. 
Congratulations to Mr. SMITH, con-
gratulations to the ranking member, 
and congratulations to the committee 
for that. 
Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity 
today to do right by our servicemem-
bers and by the principles they uphold. 
Let us do so by passing this conference 
report and doing our part, as President 
Lincoln said, to bind up the Nation’s 
wounds. 
I urge all of my colleagues, not be-
cause they will come to the conclusion 
that this is a perfect bill—there are no 
perfect bills. But it is a bill essential 
for the defense of our values, our peo-
ple, and our land. This bill needs to 
pass overwhelmingly. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for 
it. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), 
the distinguished ranking member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to also thank my good friend from 
Texas for his service to the Nation. 
The United States has a special part-
nership with Israel. In the past 4 years, 
we have strengthened this relationship 
while taking steps toward peace in the 
Middle East under the Abraham Ac-
cords with Bahrain, Sudan, and the 
UAE. This has made Israel and the en-
tire Middle East safer. 
However, Israel still faces threats 
from malign actors like Iran that seek 
to sow chaos and spread terror. In fact, 
earlier 
today, 
Iranian 
President 
Rouhani directly threatened Israel by 
promising to support Syria’s aggres-
sion in the Golan Heights. 
I am pleased the final bill bolsters 
cooperation between our countries and 
fully funds the security assistance to 
Israel. It also improves the laws on the 
books so that we can quickly supply 
Israel with precision-guided missiles to 
defend themselves against malign ac-
tors in the region. 
This bill also enhances cooperation 
between our two nations by estab-
lishing a defense acquisition advisory 
group. 
As an NDAA conferee, I am proud 
this year’s bill includes provisions that 
support Israel and deepen our partner-
ship. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would 
like to take a moment of personal 
privilege to honor my colleague, my 
friend, my fellow Texan, Congressman 
MAC
THORNBERRY. His leadership on 
the House Armed Services Committee 
has made our country stronger. 
I am proud to have served with him 
in the Congress where we have worked 
together on key national security 
issues, including the year’s NDAA 
which bears his name. 
But most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to call him my friend. He has 
brought dignity and bipartisanship to 
this Chamber. 
For that, sir, we are forever grateful. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on 
an important aspect of this bill. 
My Corporate Transparency Act is 
the most important anticorruption, 
anti-money laundering bill in 20 years. 
When a terrorist cell or a criminal or-
ganization wants to move or hide 
money, they usually do it right here in 
the United States with a shell com-
pany. So the same terrorist groups that 
want to attack the United States are 
using our own financial system to fi-
nance those attacks. It is appalling, 
and it has to stop. 
My bill will end the abuse of anony-
mous shell companies in the United 
States by requiring companies to dis-
close their true beneficial owners to 
the Treasury Department at the time 
the company is formed. 
I want to thank my negotiating part-
ners, Chairman CRAPO, Ranking Mem-
ber BROWN, Chairwoman WATERS, and 
Ranking Member MCHENRY, and I con-
gratulate Chairman SMITH and Rank-
ing Member THORNBERRY
for all of 
their hard work on this bill. 
b 1345 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER), who is a 
distinguished member of the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take a moment of per-
sonal privilege to express my thanks to 
Mr. THORNBERRY, who is retiring, for 
his many years of service to our mili-
tary and our country through his ac-
tions in this committee. He will cer-
tainly be missed. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, Congress is 
tasked with one of its most important 
duties: reauthorizing the NDAA to en-
sure that our military has everything 
that they could possibly need to con-
tinue protecting this country. 
This year, I am proud to have served 
as conferee for the financial services 
measures in the NDAA, which includes 
the most significant overhaul of our 
anti-money laundering laws in decades. 
The bipartisan Anti-Money Laun-
dering Act authorizes new resources for 
the Treasury Department to combat il-
licit finance and requires the Treasury 
to apply more rigor to its data collec-
tion. This will allow suspicious activ-
ity reports and currency transaction 
reports to be as useful as possible for 
law enforcement. 
For too long, Congress and the pri-
vate sector have had little to no in-
sight into how the executive branch 
uses these reports, which has decreased 
accountability and prevents us from 
modernizing 
the 
reporting 
regime. 
That ends with this bill. 
The conference report also contains 
the ILLICIT CASH Act, legislation 
that Congresswoman MALONEY and I 
have been working on for years. This 
provision will deliver a significant 
blow to human traffickers and drug 
cartels by eliminating shell corpora-
tions that, for decades, have been a 
critical vehicle for laundering money 
in the United States. 
In the fight against shell companies, 
the Federal Government has continu-
ously deputized financial institutions, 
threatening massive penalties unless 
they play the role of law enforcement, 
effectively forcing private industry to 
do the government’s job. 
This legislation puts an end to that 
practice by forcing Treasury’s Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network to 
collect 
beneficial 
information 
with 
minimal effort or inconvenience to 
businesses. 
I thank Congresswoman MALONEY for 
her tireless efforts and collaboration 
on several provisions that protect 
small businesses and streamline regu-
lations for financial institutions. I also 
thank Ranking Member MCHENRY for 
fighting for additional protections and 
relief for small businesses in con-
ference. 
Mr. Speaker, with these provisions, 
America can better fight illicit and 
terrorism finance, which helps our 
brave men and women in uniform who 
risk their lives every day to protect 
our freedoms and keep us safe. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much for his 
leadership. I also thank my fellow 
Texan, MAC THORNBERRY, for his serv-
ice to the Nation as he continues his 
journey. 
Let me say how important this legis-
lation is as it relates to basic pay, in-
centive pay, and hazard pay for our 
military families, many of whom are in 
my congressional district; the work 
that has been done on the maternity 
uniform pilot program; and also the 
work on reenforcing NATO; the sexual 
assault prevention and response that is 
so important, particularly in our com-
munity in Texas, for the horrible acts 
at Fort Hood against Vanessa Guillen, 
causing her to lose her life along with 
many others. This is a legislation that 
focuses on the personnel and that fo-
cuses on the security of our Nation. 
I am very grateful to Congressman 
BROWN for his leadership on joining 
with other Members to ensure with 
Chairman SMITH that we remove these 
Confederate names from the names of 
military bases that represent all peo-
ple. I am very grateful that my lan-
guage indicates that profound, dig-
nified, qualified, and heroic African- 
American soldiers have the right to 
have their names listed on these par-
ticular bases. 
I ask America to send in the names 
of your relatives. Call my office. Send 
it to the Armed Services Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6929 
December 8, 2020 
Let us have a base where soldiers go 
that reflects everyone. I am thankful 
that my language was put in to name 
bases after African-American soldiers 
and other diverse persons. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask support of this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong sup-
port of all the Jackson Lee Amendments made 
in order for consideration of the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
I thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY and their staffs for working 
with me and my staff in consideration of sev-
eral Jackson Lee Amendments. 
I am particularly thankful to Chairman SMITH 
for taking up the challenge of removing the 
stain of confederate traitors being honored by 
the naming of bases and military installations 
in their name. 
It has been too long that African Americans 
guarded their communities from the hidden 
racism that existed under the guise of the con-
federate flag and knowing through oral history 
the brutality of those who served voluntarily in 
the confederate army and whose names were 
on bases and military installations. 
This bill is ushering in a new era where the 
names of confederates who served voluntarily 
to take up arms against the United States will 
have their names removed from places of 
honor such as military bases or installations 
and these individuals be placed in historical 
context where historians and scholars may 
study ad understand their place in American 
history. 
It is also time that African Americans and 
Native Americans be recognized for their con-
tributions in defense of our nation. 
The history of African Americans and Native 
Americans serving in the military date back to 
the colonial period of our nation to the present 
day. 
In every war waged from the Battle of Lex-
ington to the Battle for Fallujah, African Ameri-
cans and Native Americans have honorably 
answered the call to duty, and served with 
great valor and distinction in America’s armed 
forces. 
At decisive moments in our nation’s history, 
the United States military and its citizens war-
riors, were there and made the difference: 
The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), 
The War of 1812 (1812–1814), 
The Mexican-American War (1836), 
The Civil War (1861–1865), 
The Spanish-American War (1898), 
World War I (1914–1918), 
World War II (1941–1945), 
The Korean War (1950–1953), 
The Vietnam War (1965–1975), 
The Gulf War (1991), and 
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as 
conflicts in other theaters of war. 
The military is there defending our nation 
when attacked by hostile nations or adver-
saries. 
But it is also there when needed to respond 
to attack from natural elements like floods and 
Hurricanes like Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and 
Katrina. 
The military was there doing a job no other 
branch of our nation’s government could do— 
in the face of overwhelming calamity when the 
lives of thousands of American citizens were 
on the line—they came. 
Our thanks to the military for being always 
ready to answer the call of duty—whether that 
call comes in the dead of night or the light of 
day—we know that we can count on you. 
The names and faces of millions of African 
Americans who have served our nation in uni-
form may fade from memory, but this evening 
we have the opportunity to remember and see 
them in the faces of the young people who 
have answered the call to duty by becoming 
members of the armed forces. 
I offered several amendments to H.R. 6395 
to improve the bill. 
I thank my colleagues: Representatives 
BENNIE THOMPSON, WILLIAM LACY CLAY, GREG-
ORY
MEEKS, A. DONALD
MCEACHIN, MARC 
VEASEY, STANFORD BISHOP, ANDRE CARSON, 
and JAHANA HAYES for joining as cosponsors 
of this Amendment. 
The fact that military bases have been 
named after Confederate military leaders or 
soldiers is hard to imagine given that they 
were fighting to end the United States. 
The Confederacy was not something that 
should be held up for honor by the United 
States or our nation’s military. 
There is no shortage of honorable replace-
ment candidates to receive the honor of hav-
ing a military base, installation or facility 
named in their honor. 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
1. Gen. Roscoe Robinson Jr. 
General Robinson was a 1951 graduate of 
West Point who attended the service academy 
before the Army was desegregated. Robinson 
served in Korea and Vietnam, with valor deco-
rations in both conflicts, and as a training offi-
cer as part of the U.S. military support mission 
in Liberia. He went on to become the first 
black commander of the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, deputy chief of staff for operations in 
U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces 
Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO 
Military Committee, and the first black four-star 
general in the Army. 
2. William Harvey Carney 
William Carney was the first African Amer-
ican recipient of the Congressional Medal of 
Honor, which he received for his actions on 
July 18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, SC while a 
member of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment 
in the Civil War—the state’s first all-black regi-
ment. 
The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of 
the film, ‘‘Glory,’’ starring Denzel Washington 
and Morgan Freeman. 
3. Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams 
Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams 
was appointed to lead the African American 
Women’s Army Corps unit designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, 
which became known as the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight.’’ 
This unit was instrumental in establishing 
and maintaining morale because it assured 
that mail from the battlefront and the home- 
front flowed efficiently and timely. 
4. Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey 
In 1964, Margaret E. Bailey, Army Nurse 
Corps, was the first nurse to be promoted to 
lieutenant colonel. 
UNITED STATES NAVY 
5. Dorie Miller Messman First Class and Ad-
miral Michelle Howard. 
Dorie Miller, Messman First Class was serv-
ing in a noncombat role in the Navy, Dorie Mil-
ler responded heroically when the battleship 
West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor. 
He was the first African American to be 
awarded the Navy Cross, the third highest 
honor awarded by the US Navy at the time. 
6. Admiral Michelle Howard 
Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Ad-
miral and one of the highest-ranking African 
American women ever to serve in any branch 
of the military. Admiral Howard is also the first 
African American woman to command a U.S. 
Navy ship, the USS Rushmore. 
She is the Navy’s second highest ranking 
officer and is currently serving as the com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and 
commander of Allied Joint Force Command 
Naples. 
THE AIR FORCE 
7. Lt. Col Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell 
In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Kimbrell be-
came the first female African American fighter 
pilot in the Air Force history. Her flights in 
Northern Watch marked her as the first female 
pilot to fly combat missions for Misawa’s 35th 
Fighter Wing, and the first African American 
woman to employ ordinance in combat. She 
has more than 1,110 hours in the F–16, in-
cluding 176 hours of combat time. 
8. Colonel Ruth A. Lucas 
Colonel Lucas was the first African Amer-
ican woman in the Air Force to be promoted 
to the rank of colonel. At the time of her retire-
ment in 1970, she was the highest-ranking Af-
rican American woman in the Air Force. 
9. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr 
In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis became 
the first African American Major General in the 
United States Air Force. In 1943, he organized 
and commanded the 332nd Fighter Group 
known as the Tuskegee Airmen. General 
Davis received many decorations during his 
career, including two Distinguished Service 
Medals and a Silver Star. On December 9, 
1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth 
general’s star by President Bill Clinton. 
THE COAST GUARD 
10. Alex Haley 
Chief Petty Officer Haley is best known for 
writing letters for his shipmates and his short 
stories and articles, which got him promoted to 
Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959. 
Haley ultimately received a number of military 
honors, including the American Defense Serv-
ice Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an 
honorary degree from the Coast Guard Acad-
emy. And most of you know him also as the 
author of ‘‘Roots.’’ 
11. Bobby C. Wilks 
In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the 
first African American Coast Guard aviator. He 
later became the first African American to 
reach the rank of Captain and the first to com-
mand a Coast Guard air station. He accumu-
lated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different 
types of aircrafts. 
Twenty-five percent of the today’s military is 
comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8% 
are African American. 
In 2017, blacks made up 17% of the DOD 
active-duty military—somewhat higher than 
their share of the U.S. population ages 18 to 
44 (13%). Blacks have consistently been rep-
resented in greater shares among enlisted 
personnel (19% in 2015) than among the com-
missioned officers (9%). 
NATIVE AMERICANS 
The amendment I offered during House con-
sideration of the NDAA was expanded to in-
clude Native Americans. 
It is without doubt that the military has a sto-
ried history of Native American contributions to

the securing our nation since colonial times to 
the present. 
One famous example of their contributions 
occurred during World War II when the U.S. 
military developed a specific policy to recruit 
and train Navajo speakers to become code 
talkers. 
A code talker is the name given to 29 Nav-
ajo Natives who used their tribal language to 
send secret communications on the battlefield. 
The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talk-
ers, who created a code based on the com-
plex, unwritten Navajo language. 
The code primarily used word association 
by assigning a Navajo word to key phrases 
and military tactics. 
This system enabled the Code Talkers to 
translate three lines of English in 20 seconds, 
not 30 minutes as was common with existing 
code-breaking machines. 
The Code Talkers participated in every 
major Marine operation in the Pacific theater, 
giving 
the 
Marines 
a critical advantage 
throughout the war. 
During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo 
Jima, for example, six Navajo Code Talker 
Marines successfully transmitted more than 
800 messages without error. 
Marine leadership noted after the battle that 
the Code Talkers were critical to the victory at 
Iwo Jima. 
At the end of the war, the Navajo Code re-
mained unbroken. 
Our Native American brothers and sisters 
are more than worthy to be so honored by 
having their names considered for military 
bases and installations. 
BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS 
A Jackson Lee Amendment included in the 
House version of the NDAA directed the Sec-
retary of Defense to report to Congress the 
extent, if any, of the threat to national security 
posed by domestic terrorist groups and organi-
zations motivated by a belief system of white 
supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and Proud 
Boys extremists is reflected in the Conference 
bill. 
The NDAA conference identified that the 
FBI is under statutory obligation, established 
by Section 5602 of the NDAA FY 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92), to complete a report that would 
better characterize the domestic terrorist threat 
by requiring the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security in consultation with the 
National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), to 
produce a set of comprehensive reports over 
5 years. 
The report is to include: a strategic intel-
ligence threat internal to the United States; 
metrics on the number and type of incidents, 
coupled with resulting investigations, arrests, 
prosecutions, and analytic products, copies of 
the execution of domestic terrorism investiga-
tions; detailed explanations of how the FBI, 
DHS and NCTC prioritize the domestic ter-
rorism threats and incident; and descriptions 
regarding the type and regularity of training 
provided by the FBI, DHS, or NCTC to other 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement. 
The conferees note that the report has not 
been delivered to the appropriate committees 
and they urge the FBI Director to deliver the 
report without delay. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment to the NDAA 
FY 2021 sought the same information that is 
required under the NDAA FY 2020 because of 
the threat posed by accelerationists and militia 
extremists who comprise a range of violent 
anti-government actors, movements, and orga-
nizations, some of which branch out of dec-
ades-old ideologies and others of which are 
relatively new has led to violent engagement 
of law enforcement. 
My concern is that in the aftermath of a his-
toric national election, the activity of violence 
influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys 
will increase and lead to attacks becoming 
more frequent. 
In 2018, we saw too many instances of vio-
lent extremists searching for opportunities to 
sow violence and disrupt democratic proc-
esses. 
Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting 
constitutionally protected activity for cooption 
or to provide cover for attacks. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a 
recommendation made by the Cyberspace So-
larium Commission to require the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to develop a strategy to 
implement Domain-based Message Authen-
tication, 
Reporting, 
and 
Conformance 
(DMARC) standard across U.S.-based email 
providers to increase the security of email. 
I thank my colleagues Congressmen LAN-
GEVIN, GALLAGHER, KATKO, and JOYCE for join-
ing this bipartisan amendment to the FY 2021 
NDAA. 
The security of email has grown in impor-
tance as it has become in many ways the pri-
mary way that businesses, consumers, gov-
ernment communicate. 
The Senate bill also addressed this impor-
tant issue and the language of the final Con-
ference concurs. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Con-
ference for the NDAA FY 2021. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
understand that the chairman has no 
further speakers. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Correct. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I would begin by ex-
pressing my gratitude and admiration 
for Chairman ADAM SMITH and our abil-
ity to work together over a number of 
years, as well as to the members on 
both sides of the Armed Services Com-
mittee and our colleagues in the Sen-
ate, Chairman INHOFE
and Ranking 
Member REED. 
Like Chairman SMITH, I also want to 
pay particular attention, gratitude, 
and honors to our professional staff. 
They started this conference process in 
July, and they have been working all 
these months to make sure that every 
detail was as right as we could make it. 
I particularly want to thank Dan 
Sennott, who had the responsibility of 
answering my phone calls on nights 
and weekends and so forth. Our staff 
worked with the professionalism and 
patriotism that would make all Ameri-
cans proud if they could see it. 
I also appreciate the generous words 
of my colleagues and having my name 
attached to this bill. This bill is one of 
which I am very proud. It strengthens 
our country’s security in many ways. 
But as grateful as I am, I do not lose 
sight of the fact that this bill is not— 
and this bill has never been in 60 
years—about any of us. It is not about 
us or our political agendas or our polit-
ical grievances. 
This bill is about the men and women 
who risk their lives to protect and de-
fend us and our freedoms and their 
families. This bill is about American 
national security. We have been able to 
come together on those things for 60 
years, whatever other differences we 
may have had. 
Without this bill, both the troops and 
America’s national security will be 
hurt. Now, Members need to under-
stand that and accept responsibility for 
the consequences of their vote. That 
damage that would happen without 
this bill cannot be papered over with 
some executive order or any appropria-
tion bill, and it won’t or it can’t be re-
paired by a new bill in a new Congress 
with a new administration. 
I know we can always find an excuse 
to vote against a bill, especially an ex-
cuse about what is not in it. So I will 
admit right here that this bill does not 
fix healthcare. This bill does not fix 
immigration. It does not raise or lower 
taxes. And it does nothing regarding 
the legal liability of social media com-
panies. All of those things need atten-
tion and some kind of action. 
But our troops should not be pun-
ished because this bill does not fix ev-
erything that needs to be fixed or it 
doesn’t have a provision exactly the 
way we would want it. 
The main reason this bill has been 
signed into law every year for 59 
straight years is because of its sub-
stance. But like the chairman, I just 
want to add a note about process. 
This committee started collecting 
proposals in January in a database 
that would be ultimately included in 
this bill. It went through all the sub-
committees, the full committee, a con-
ference 
process, 
and 
hundreds 
of 
amendments have been considered one 
way or another. 
Every step of the way, Members 
shape it. In fact, we could easily iden-
tify close to 200 Members of the House 
that have a provision that can be 
linked to them in one way or another 
that are in this bill, and I think that is 
unique, frankly, in Congress today. If 
the 6-decade legacy of having this bill 
signed into law ends with us after 59 
years, then I am afraid that process of 
having 
hundreds 
of 
Members 
con-
tribute would end as well. 
A very strong vote will help prevent 
that. 
The 
stronger 
the 
vote, 
the 
smoother the process from here on out. 
A strong vote will show the troops that 
we support them. A strong vote will 
show the adversaries that we can stand 
together to support this Nation, and 
that is what this bill is really all 
about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mostly, I would like to associate my-
self with Mr. THORNBERRY’s remarks. I 
think that was the perfect statement

of why it is so important to vote for 
this bill and why every Member of this 
body should vote for this bill. It con-
tains incredibly important provisions, 
and the excuses for not doing those 
provisions just don’t hold up. 
As Mr. THORNBERRY points out, every 
year near the end of the process, be-
cause we are the only bill that actually 
makes it through the process, people 
who have been working on issues for a 
long time are desperate to get them 
taken care of. We respect that, we 
honor that, and we are the last vehicle 
to find. 
Many times we are able to help, but 
not always. That is not a reason to not 
do the bill because of all the other 
issues, as Mr. THORNBERRY laid out, 
that we have not addressed. 
Then, as people want to find reasons 
to oppose the bill, they start saying 
things that aren’t terribly accurate. I 
think Mr. GAETZ wins the award for 
that one this year in his remark on Af-
ghanistan. 
Our bill says that if the President 
wants to go below 2,000 troops in Af-
ghanistan—he said he is going to go to 
2,300. So this bill doesn’t have anything 
to do with what President Trump said 
he is going to draw down in Afghani-
stan. If he wants to go below 2,000 or a 
future President wants to go below 
2,000, then he has to file a report. It 
doesn’t say that he can’t do it. He has 
to file a report. 
I actually agree with Mr. GAETZ on 
where we need to go in Afghanistan. 
And I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, this 
bill does nothing to prohibit the next 
President, President Biden, from com-
pletely drawing down in Afghanistan. 
That is a policy debate he will have. 
So anyone who comes to the floor 
and says they are voting against this 
bill because of that is really not telling 
the truth. That is not what this bill 
does. 
I also want to mention the top line 
because that is a favorite argument on 
our side to not vote for the bill. I will 
let you in on a little secret: the defense 
policy bill does not control how much 
money we spend at the Pentagon. 
I know that sounds a little odd, but it 
doesn’t. The budget process does that. 
And when we don’t have a budget proc-
ess because of how much things have 
broken down, which has happened fre-
quently, then the Appropriations Com-
mittee decides how much we spend. 
What we do is we decide how that gets 
spent and the oversight of it. 
A few years ago, Mr. COURTNEY 
pushed us to do two submarines a year, 
a great provision that saved a lot of 
money. We can control that. But if you 
think the Pentagon should spend more 
than it is spending, or less, then your 
beef is on the appropriations side. We 
could take the tables out in terms of 
the amount of money that we have in 
this bill, and it wouldn’t change the 
amount of money that is spent at the 
Pentagon. 
So, again, if you have a reason to 
vote against the bill, that is great. But 
the top line, Afghanistan, those are not 
valid reasons. This is an important 
piece of legislation that has been un-
duly complicated by the fact that, of 
all people, the President is one of the 
people this year who, near the end of 
the process, said: I want to fix that. 
He wanted to fix something about 
section 230 having to do with social 
media platforms, and he went looking 
for the only possible vehicle. Let me 
just say to people on that issue, that 
section is not going to be addressed in 
this bill. You can not address section 
230 and pass a defense bill; or you can 
not address section 230 and not pass a 
defense bill. There is no choice here 
where you can do both, Mr. Speaker. 
So please make the right choice. 
Please recognize all of the incredibly 
important bicameral, bipartisan provi-
sions that are contained in this bill. 
This is one thing in a very tumultuous 
time that we ought to be able to agree 
on. There are enough provisions and 
good policy in here for everyone in this 
body. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by 
thanking everyone in this body. We 
have worked together in this process. I 
am now finishing up my 2 years as 
chairman. My caucus, in their infinite 
wisdom, has given me another 2 years 
to do the job, but these first 2 years I 
really enjoyed the process. 
Members keep coming up to me and 
saying: You have a terrible job, it must 
be difficult, you have all these people 
making all these demands. 
I love what I do. I am in a position 
with all the other team here to help 
people. We don’t always succeed and we 
don’t always get it done, but we have a 
chance. Every Member of the House 
and Senate, I think, have worked to-
gether, and we have produced an out-
standing product. Let us reward our-
selves for our work. Let us take care of 
the troops, as we are supposed to do, 
and pass this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support 
William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. It is a 
fitting tribute to the years of dedication and 
work that Congressman THORNBERRY
has 
done in this body and, in particular, on na-
tional security issues. 
In particular, this legislation contains Section 
3510 that addresses and corrects a regulatory 
mismatch of the manner in which a small pas-
senger vessel that operates in Southeast Alas-
ka is measured. Specifically, the M/V Liseron 
(United States official number 971339), a con-
verted minesweeper that conducts overnight 
passenger cruises in the eco-tourism trade in 
Southeast Alaska, should be classified as hav-
ing the same regulatory tonnage for licensing 
its crew as is used for its safety inspection 
category (i.e., 100 gross tons), and the other 
vessels in the same trade. For construction 
and safety, the vessel meets all Coast Guard 
standards. This section in essence aligns and 
makes licensing requirements consistent with 
all the other safety and inspection regulations 
that apply to the M/V Liseron as a small pas-
senger vessel by deeming the M/V Liseron to 
be less than 100 gross tons for the purposes 
of licensing and credentialing subject to some 
conditions. 
Operationally, the M/V Liseron has ten 
staterooms and is limited to about 20 pas-
sengers. More critically, the vessel is currently 
inspected by the Coast Guard as a small pas-
senger vessel in the 100 gross regulatory ton-
nage category. Notwithstanding that, the ves-
sel has a larger tonnage entered on its certifi-
cate of inspection due to the arcane nature of 
the U.S. vessel admeasurement laws, rules 
that govern the volumetric size of vessels. 
Larger competitor vessels can be nearly 100 
feet longer and carry 5 times the number of 
passengers, yet they are considered to be in 
the smaller 100 GT small passenger vessel 
category for both licensing and inspection pur-
poses. 
Needless to say, the M/V Liseron suffers 
from the inequitable situation as the vessel 
must compete with similar or larger vessels in 
the eco-tourism trade that carry five times the 
number of passengers. While the vessel is in-
spected and regulated for all safety purposes 
in a lower tonnage category (i.e., 100 GT), 
due to the higher tonnage rating entered on its 
certificate of inspection, the M/V Liseron must 
source crew from seafarers with deep water 
credentials (i.e., 500 GT) rather than for the 
shallower and protected waters of Southeast 
Alaska. The inequity is underscored by the 
fact that the M/V Liseron physically can fit 
within the volumetric profile of its competitors, 
yet the rules say it should be assigned a 
measurement of being larger. This is a classic 
example of the matryoshka principle. Further, 
the vessel carries far fewer passengers than 
its competitors. 
This legislation prohibits the M/V Liseron 
from undergoing any alteration of its size. It 
also limits the operation while carrying pas-
senger to inland waters of the United States 
so it will not go on deep sea oceangoing 
cruises. Further the section permits 100 GT li-
censed crew members operate the vessel 
while allowing the Coast Guard to add addi-
tional credentials in a justifiable case if the ex-
perience and training of the individual warrant 
it. This does not mean additional credentials 
must be required or are warranted in every in-
stance. My understanding is that the Coast 
Guard already has authority to do this in exist-
ing regulation so no rulemaking is required 
that would delay the implementation of this 
provision. If the master and first mate can hold 
100 GT licenses it should result in less turn-
over and more appropriately experienced per-
sonnel that will ultimately contribute to even 
safer and more consistent operation of the 
vessel. Only two positions are affected by this 
legislation. 
During the cruising season in Southeast 
Alaska this vessel brings significant job oppor-
tunities and needed economic activity in local 
businesses by the company and its cus-
tomers. The vessel enables tourists from 
around the world to come and enjoy the fish-
ing and unparalleled scenic and natural beauty 
that Alaska has to offer. This year the vessel 
suffered the economic impact of the cancella-
tions due to the COVID–19. As a result, the 
M/V Liseron has lost an entire season of rev-
enue due to cancellations. Continuing an artifi-
cial barrier such as having to hire crew in a 
mismatched licensing category will only add to 
the vessel’s difficulties to recover from this 
economic loss when they are able to resume 
operations.

In summary, I urge all of my colleagues to 
join me to enact this legislation. By adjusting 
the tonnage rating for licensing the M/V 
Liseron’s crew to be consistent with its safety 
inspection category, the M/V Liseron would be 
able to hire and retain more appropriate expe-
rienced crew familiar with Southeast Alaskan 
waterways and small passenger vessel oper-
ations. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of the Conference Report associated 
with H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) Thorn-
berry National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA), which supports our 
troops and includes critical provisions to re-
move Confederate symbols from our military. 
The legislation also ensures our country re-
tains its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI), 
cybersecurity, and semiconductor manufac-
turing. I’m proud that the conferenced NDAA 
includes several provisions I authored or co-
sponsored. 
The Global AI Index quantifies the AI arms 
race among nations, and it has found that the 
U.S. is ahead of China today but ‘‘experts pre-
dict China will overtake the U.S. in just five to 
10 years.’’ This is why it’s so critical we con-
tinue to invest in AI, especially as it relates to 
national security. 
The conferenced NDAA includes my bipar-
tisan and bicameral legislation, H.R. 7096, the 
National AI Research Resource Task Force 
Act, which establishes a task force of experts 
from government, academia, and companies 
(large and small) to develop a roadmap for a 
national AI research cloud to make available 
high-powered computing, large data sets, and 
educational resources necessary for AI re-
search. The national AI research cloud ex-
pands access so that American universities 
and companies can participate in AI R&D. My 
bill 
appears 
as 
Section 
5106 
of 
the 
conferenced NDAA. 
My legislation is supported by Chairman 
Eric Schmidt and Vice Chairman Bob Work of 
the National Security Commission on AI; 12 
leading public and private research univer-
sities, including Stanford, UC Berkeley, Prince-
ton, UCLA, and Ohio State; research and tech 
nonprofits Mozilla, Open AI, and the Allen In-
stitute for AI; standards body IEEE-USA; lead-
ing technology companies, including Google, 
Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM; and 
startups, including Calypso AI and Scale AI. I 
thank Representatives ANTHONY
GONZALEZ 
and MIKIE SHERRILL, and Senators PORTMAN 
and HEINRICH, for their partnership in advanc-
ing this highly important legislation. 
I’m proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 6216, 
the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act, 
comprehensive 
and 
bipartisan 
legislation 
which establishes an initiative to accelerate 
and coordinate investments and partnerships 
in AI research, standards, and education. This 
legislation appears as Division E of the 
conferenced NDAA, and it is a major invest-
ment in our country’s future that will pay divi-
dends for decades to come. 
The conferenced NDAA also includes lan-
guage based on two AI-related amendments I 
offered and the House adopted on July 20th. 
House NDAA floor Amendment No. 131 re-
quires the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center 
(JAIC) of the DOD to report on its contribution 
to the development of Al standards in multi-
stakeholder 
bodies. 
House 
NDAA 
floor 
Amendment No. 132 requires the JAIC to re-
port on the assignments servicemembers re-
ceive after they complete their duty with the 
JAIC. Both were adopted as part of H. Amdt. 
841 to H.R. 6395 and appear in Section 231 
of the conferenced NDAA. 
I also cosponsored key technology provi-
sions of the conferenced NDAA. The CHIPS 
for America Act, introduced by Reps. MATSUI 
and MCCAUL, restores American leadership in 
semiconductor manufacturing and appears as 
Title XCIX of the conferenced NDAA. I thank 
conferees for retaining a provision I authored 
to ensure that small businesses are given 
preference for grants authorized by the legisla-
tion (Section 9902(a)(2)(C)(ii)(IV)). A provision 
establishing the role of the National Cyber Di-
rector within the Executive Office of the Presi-
dent, based on the National Cyber Director 
Act, which I cosponsored, appears as Section 
1752 of the conferenced NDAA. This legisla-
tion is critical to help coordinate cybersecurity 
at the highest levels of government. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘YES’ on the 
Conference Report for H.R. 6395. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 6395, the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021. This legislation authorizes the funding 
for a national defense strategy that is built on 
Democratic principles and advances American 
values. 
As Dean of the Texas Congressional Dele-
gation, I would be remiss if I did not briefly 
take a moment to recognize and acknowledge 
Congressman MAC THORNBERRY—a longtime 
colleague of mine and the namesake for this 
bill—for his service to our country. I wish him 
and his family a fruitful retirement. 
This year’s National Defense Authorization 
Act reflects the priorities of the American peo-
ple. As an appointee on the NDAA conference 
committee, I was proud to fight for the inclu-
sion of key bipartisan provisions like a pay 
raise for our servicemembers, expanded paid 
parental leave for civilian DOD employees, 
and new investments to combat climate 
change in the final version of the bill. 
The Congressional Black Caucus played a 
critical role in the shaping of this legislation. 
Among the several bold initiatives ushered 
through the House, Senate, and conference 
deliberations by the CBC is the establishment 
of a commission to rename military installa-
tions that honor Confederate officers. This pro-
posal, paired with the required modification or 
removal of any symbols, monuments, and par-
aphernalia that commemorate the Confed-
eracy, is a necessary step in achieving racial 
equity in the military. 
Mr. Speaker, despite the President’s veto 
threat, I look forward to the passage and en-
actment of this legislation. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the conference report to the National 
Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021. 
Combating illicit finance and targeting bad 
actors is a nonpartisan issue. However, Con-
gress’ actions must be thoughtful and data- 
driven. 
An example of this is H.R. 2514, the 
COUNTER Act, which is included in this con-
ference report. Division G is a compilation of 
bipartisan policies that will modernize and re-
form the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money 
laundering 
regimes. 
These 
policies 
will 
strengthen the Department of Treasury’s finan-
cial intelligence, anti-money laundering, and 
counter terrorism programs. I would like to 
thank Chairman CLEAVER and Ranking Mem-
ber STIVERS for their work on this bill and the 
language included in Division G. 
In addition to Division G, the conference re-
port contains an amendment replacing the text 
of H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act, 
with new legislation. H.R. 2513, which passed 
the House on October 22, 2019, and again as 
an amendment to H.R. 6395 on July 21, 2020, 
attempted to establish a new beneficial owner-
ship information reporting regime to assist law 
enforcement in tracking down terrorists and 
other bad actors who finance terrorism and il-
licit activities. But, it did so to the detriment of 
America’s small businesses. 
Beneficial ownership information is the per-
sonally identifiable information (PII) on a com-
pany’s beneficial owners. This information is 
currently collected and held by financial institu-
tions prior to a company gaining access to our 
financial system. 
However, bad actors and nation states, 
such as China and Russia, are becoming 
more proficient in using our financial system to 
support illicit activity. As bad actors become 
more sophisticated, so to must our tools to 
deter and catch them. One such tool is identi-
fying the beneficial owners of shell companies, 
which are used as fronts to launder money 
and finance terrorism or other illicit activity. 
Beneficial ownership information assists law 
enforcement to better target these bad actors. 
Although well-intentioned, H.R. 2513 had 
numerous deficiencies in its reporting regime. 
First, H.R. 2513 placed numerous reporting 
and costly reporting requirements on small 
businesses. It lacked protections to properly 
protect small businesses’ personal information 
stored with a little-known government office 
within the Department of Treasury—known as 
FinCEN. The bill authorized access to this 
sensitive information without any limitation on 
who could access the information and when it 
could be accessed. Finally, it failed to hold 
FinCEN accountable for its actions. 
The text of H.R. 2513 is replaced with new 
language that I negotiated, along with Senate 
Banking Committee Chairman CRAPO. This 
substitute, which is reflected in Division F of 
the conference report, is a significant improve-
ment over the House-passed bill in three key 
areas. 
First, Division F limits the burdens on small 
businesses. Unlike H.R. 2513, the language 
included in the conference report protects our 
nation’s small businesses. It prevents duplica-
tive, burdensome, and costly reporting require-
ments for beneficial ownership data from 
being imposed in two ways. It rescinds the 
current beneficial ownership reporting regime 
set out in 31 CFR 1010.230 (b)–(j), which is 
costly and burdensome to small businesses. 
Rescinding these provisions ensures that it 
cannot be used in a future rule to impose an-
other duplicative, reporting regime on Amer-
ica’s small businesses. In addition, Division F 
requires the Department of Treasury to mini-
mize the burdens the new reporting regime 
will have on small businesses, including elimi-
nating any duplicative requirements. 
House Republicans ensured the directive to 
minimize burdens on small businesses is ful-
filled. Division F directs the Secretary of the 
Treasury to report to the House Committee on 
Financial Services and the Senate Committee 
on Banking annually for the first three years 
after the new rule is promulgated. The report 
must assess: the effectiveness of the new 
rule; the steps the Department of Treasury

December 8, 2020 
took to minimize the reporting burdens on re-
porting entities, including eliminating duplica-
tive reporting requirements, and the accuracy 
of the new rule in targeting bad actors. The 
Department of Treasury is also required to 
identify the alternate procedures and stand-
ards that were considered and rejected in de-
veloping its new reporting regime. This report 
will help the Committees understand the effec-
tiveness of the new rule in identifying and 
prosecuting bad actors. Moreover, it will give 
the Committees the data needed to under-
stand whether the reporting threshold is suffi-
cient or should be revised. 
Second, Division F includes the strongest 
privacy and disclosure protections for Amer-
ica’s small businesses as it relates to the col-
lection, maintenance, and disclosure of bene-
ficial ownership information. The new protec-
tions set out in Division F ensure that small 
business beneficial ownership information will 
be protected just like an individual’s tax return 
information. The protections in Division F mir-
ror or exceed the protections set out in 26 
U.S.C. 6103, including: 
1. Agency Head Certification. Division F 
requires an agency head or designee to cer-
tify that an investigation or law enforce-
ment, national security or intelligence ac-
tivity is authorized and necessitates access 
to the database. Designees may only be iden-
tified through a process that mirrors the 
process followed by the Department of Treas-
ury for those designations set out in 26 
U.S.C. 6103. 
2. Semi-annual Certification of Protocols. 
Division F requires an Agency head to make 
a semi-annual certification to the Secretary 
of the Treasury that the protocols for access-
ing small business ownership data ensure 
maximum protection of this critically im-
portant information. This requirement is 
non-delegable. 
3. Court authorization of State, Local and 
Tribal law enforcement requests. Division F 
requires state, local and tribal law enforce-
ment officials to obtain a court authoriza-
tion from the court system in the local juris-
diction. Obtaining a court authorization is 
the first of two steps state, local and tribal 
governments must take prior to accessing 
the database. Separately, state, local and 
tribal law enforcement agencies must com-
ply with the protocols and safeguards estab-
lished by the Department of Treasury. 
4. Limited Disclosure of Beneficial Owner-
ship Information. Division F prohibits the 
Secretary of Treasury from disclosing the re-
quested beneficial ownership information to 
anyone other than a law enforcement or na-
tional security official who is directly en-
gaged in the investigation. 
5. System of Records. Division F requires 
any requesting agency to establish and 
maintain a system of records to store bene-
ficial ownership information provided di-
rectly by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
6. Penalties for Unauthorized Disclosure. 
Division F prohibits unauthorized disclo-
sures. Specifically, the agreement reiterates 
that a violation of appropriate protocols, in-
cluding unauthorized disclosure or use, is 
subject to criminal and civil penalties (up to 
five years in prison and $250,000 fine). 
Third, Division F contains the necessary 
transparency, accountability and oversight pro-
visions to ensure that the Department of 
Treasury promulgates and implements the 
new beneficial ownership reporting regime as 
intended by Congress. Specifically, Division F 
requires each requesting agency to establish 
and maintain a permanent, auditable system 
of records describing: each request, how the 
information is used, and how the beneficial 
ownership information is secured. It requires 
requesting agencies to furnish a report to the 
Department of Treasury describing the proce-
dures in place to ensure the confidentiality of 
the beneficial ownership information provided 
directly by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Separately, Division F requires two addi-
tional audits. First, it directs the Secretary of 
Treasury to conduct an annual audit to deter-
mine whether beneficial ownership information 
is being collected, stored and used as in-
tended by Congress. Separately, Division F di-
rects the Government Accountability Office to 
conduct an audit for five years to ensure that 
the Department of Treasury and requesting 
agencies are using the beneficial ownership 
information as set out in Division F. This is the 
same audit that GAO conducts as it relates to 
the Department of Treasury’s collection, main-
tenance and protection of tax return informa-
tion. This information will ensure that Con-
gress has independent data on the efficacy of 
the reporting regime and whether confiden-
tiality is being maintained. 
Division F also requires the Department of 
Treasury to issue an annual report on the total 
number of court authorized requests received 
by the Secretary to access the database. The 
report must detail the total number of court au-
thorized requests approved and rejected and a 
summary justifying the action. This report to 
Congress will ensure the Department of 
Treasury does not misuse its authority to ei-
ther approve or reject court authorized re-
quests. 
Finally, Division F requires the Director of 
FinCEN, who is responsible for implementing 
this reporting regime, to testify annually for 
five years. This testimony is critical. For far too 
long FinCEN has evaded any type of congres-
sional check on its activities. Yet, it has 
amassed a great deal of authority. Now, Con-
gress will shine a light on its operations. It is 
my expectation that FinCEN will provide Con-
gress with hard data on its effectiveness in 
targeting bad actors, including the effective-
ness of this new authority to collect, maintain, 
and use beneficial ownership information. 
One final comment about the importance of 
FinCEN’s annual testimony. In the months 
leading up to the House’s consideration of 
H.R. 2513 last October, I sought data from 
FinCEN and from the Treasury Department, 
along with the Department of Justice, to better 
understand the need for this legislation. No 
such data was forthcoming. Rather, FinCEN 
gave anecdotes of very scary stories to justify 
the need for a new reporting regime. It is my 
expectation that FinCEN will provide Congress 
with the necessary data to justify this new re-
porting regime and the burdens it is placing on 
legitimate companies. 
I will conclude by thanking Chairwoman 
MALONEY for her work over the last twelve 
years on this issue and her willingness to work 
with me to strengthen this bill. I believe we 
have a better product. 
I urge my colleagues to support the con-
ference agreement. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, the conference 
report to accompany H.R. 6395, the National 
Defense Authorization Act, includes my bills 
ensuring my district, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, and other insular areas are included in 
additional federal programs as well as improv-
ing career education for military spouses. 
Businesses in the Marianas will have further 
access to federal Small Business Administra-
tion programs under the terms of my Northern 
Mariana Islands Small Business Development 
Act, included in the final version of the NDAA. 
My bill, H.R. 6021, makes the Marianas eligi-
ble for funding to establish a Small Business 
Development Center Lead Center. With addi-
tional funding, small businesses on Saipan, 
Tinian and Rota will have improved access to 
free or low-cost services such as incubator 
workspaces for entrepreneurs, business plan-
ning, operations, and other areas required for 
small business start-up, growth and success. 
It will, also, provide technical assistance from 
the Federal and State Technology program to 
Marianas small businesses interested in seed 
funding from the Small Business Innovation 
Research and Small Business Technology 
Transfer programs. 
The NDAA also includes the two bills I au-
thored to expand education opportunities in 
our islands. H.R. 6786 includes the Marianas 
in the Defense Department’s STARBASE edu-
cation program, which aims to improve stu-
dents’ skills in the STEM fields (science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math). STARBASE 
partners military installations with schools hav-
ing high proportions of economically and edu-
cationally disadvantaged students. 
Additionally included in the NDAA is my bill, 
H.R. 4614, adding the Marianas and other in-
sular areas to the national AMBER alert sys-
tem for finding missing children. AMBER alerts 
mobilize the community via radio, TV, and text 
messages and have helped locate almost one 
thousand children, since the system was cre-
ated in 1996. My AMBER Alerts Nationwide 
Act will give law enforcement in the Marianas 
the financial and technical resources from the 
U.S. Departments of Justice and Transpor-
tation to implement AMBER alerts in our com-
munity, hopefully saving lives. My bill also 
seeks to close gaps in coverage nationwide by 
specifying airports, seaports, and border 
crossing areas. 
And H.R. 7112, the Military Spouse Career 
Education Act, will help the spouses of service 
members finish their college degrees more 
quickly and get the training needed to re-li-
cense in their professions, when they must 
move to a new location under military orders. 
The spouses will be able to have the costs re-
imbursed for national tests like CLEP pro-
viding college credit and for required con-
tinuing education courses to maintain their ca-
reer credentials. 
I urge the adoption of the conference report, 
so we can be sure that military spouses have 
more support in starting and maintaining ca-
reers, more small businesses in our country 
can fully benefit from the SBDC and FAST 
programs, more students can benefit from 
STEM education, and more lives can be 
saved with the help of AMBER Alerts. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
SMITH, 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ZQUEZ, 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Senator HIRONO, Senator SCHATZ, 
and Representatives GABBARD, HOULAHAN, 
and BANKS for all their support to include into 
the NDAA these important measures. 
I ask my colleagues to support adoption of 
the conference report to accompany H.R. 
6395. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
in support of the fiscal year 2021 National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to 
start by thanking Chairman SMITH, Ranking 
Member THORNBERRY, and the House Armed

December 8, 2020 
tirelessly throughout this past year to get us to 
this point. It’s a good bill and I encourage my 
colleagues to support the conference report. 
As the Chairman of the Readiness Sub-
committee, I worked closely with members on 
and off the committee to ensure the bill ad-
dressed key priority areas affecting our mili-
tary. 
First, the bill includes a number of bipartisan 
provisions 
aimed 
at 
addressing 
climate 
change. The bill does the following: requires 
an update to the Department of Defense Cli-
mate Change Roadmap; requires a report on 
the implementation of provisions from the 
FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act 
related to installation master planning, updates 
to the Unified Facilities Criteria, sea-level rise 
modeling, and climate assessment tools; in-
cludes an alternative fuel vehicle pilot program 
to require the military departments to expand 
their use of alternative fuel non-tactical vehi-
cles to increase the use of hybrid and EV ve-
hicles; requires the Department to submit a re-
port on its greenhouse gas emissions for the 
last 10 years within 180 days of enactment; 
requires the Department to invest in research 
and development of advanced water har-
vesting technologies that would aid in ad-
dressing water security issues in areas im-
pacted by drought due to climate change; ex-
pands the Department’s ability to use installa-
tion resilience authorities to support climate re-
siliency projects at National Guard Facilities 
owned by the State; and requires the military 
services to assess their water use at installa-
tions in regions experiencing water scarcity, 
maximize use of landscaping practices that re-
duce water usage, and improve their water 
conservation. 
The bill also includes provisions that ad-
dress energy resiliency for military bases, in-
cluding the following: requires a report on ef-
forts taken to ensure fuel consumption, dis-
tribution, and logistics are being considered 
across the Department and that steps are 
being taken to reduce consumption of fossil 
fuels by 30 percent in 25 years to reduce the 
number of resupply convoys and oilers re-
quired in a contested environment; requires 
the Department of Defense to institute energy 
metering on critical military facilities to assess 
the energy requirements and plan to ensure 
resilient power sources for these facilities; es-
tablishes a pilot program to develop microgrids 
on military installations that integrate emer-
gency diesel generators to demonstrate how 
microgrid emergency diesel generator backup 
power could create efficiencies and resiliency 
while reducing costs and emissions; promotes 
the use of on-site energy production to pro-
mote military installation energy resiliency and 
energy security; requires an assessment of 
the Department’s installation and operational 
energy usage; re-establishes the Operational 
Energy Capability Improvement Fund, which 
was eliminated in the budget request, and au-
thorizes $65 million to demonstrate and field 
technologies that reduce fuel consumption and 
logistics; establishes an Operational Energy 
budget line to enhance transparency and con-
gressional oversight of the Department’s ef-
forts to reduce fossil fuel usage and make 
conservation gains on operational platforms; 
and requires the Comptroller General to as-
sess the Department’s progress towards meet-
ing net zero goals for installations to include 
an assessment of the cultural and legislative 
barriers to meeting these goals. 
The bill continues efforts to address con-
tamination 
associated 
with 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated compounds around military in-
stallations, including the following provisions: 
requires the Secretary of Defense to notify all 
agricultural operations in an area where cov-
ered PFAS has been detected in groundwater 
that is suspected to originate from use of fire-
fighting foam on a military installation; requires 
the Department of Defense to notify the con-
gressional defense committees when there 
has been an uncontrolled release of PFAS- 
containing firefighting agent; establishes a 
prize that can be awarded by the Secretary of 
Defense for innovative research that results in 
a viable replacement agent for firefighting 
foam that does not contain PFAS; requires the 
Department of Defense to survey and report 
on non-firefighting agent technologies, such as 
hangar flooring and firefighting equipment, that 
will help facilitate the phase-out of PFAS con-
taining firefighting agents; makes technical 
corrections to the FY2020 National Defense 
Authorization Act to ensure that all National 
Guard installations are eligible for funding 
under the Defense Environmental Restoration 
Account for PFAS remediation; establishes an 
interagency coordinating body for PFAS re-
search; prohibits the Department of Defense 
from procuring certain items containing PFAS, 
including cookware, carpets, and upholstery 
with stain-resistant coatings; authorizes the 
Department to work with private entities to 
spur research, development and testing of 
PFAS-free fire-fighting agents; requires the 
National Institute of Standard and Technology 
to study the safety of firefighting equipment 
with respect to protecting fire fighters from 
PFAS, and conduct research on improving the 
safety of this equipment; authorizes $90 mil-
lion for research lines that support develop-
ment of PFAS remediation and disposal tech-
nologies and firefighting agent replacement; 
and authorizes a total of $1.4 billion for envi-
ronmental remediation and BRAC accounts 
which support a range of remediation activi-
ties, to include those related to PFAS, at cur-
rent military installations, formerly utilized de-
fense sites, and installations closed by BRAC. 
The bill also builds on the Committee’s pre-
vious legislative and oversight activities to en-
sure that military personnel and their families 
live in quality housing and that the Department 
and private housing partners are responsive to 
resident concerns. The bill does the following: 
requires a report on the oversight of known 
environmental hazards in government owned 
family housing, including overseas housing; 
requires the Department of Defense to report 
on the feasibility of standardizing privatized 
housing performance metrics to better allow 
the Department to track trends across the 
housing enterprise; for future and renegotiated 
privatized housing agreements, requires that 
funding for housing maintenance and recapi-
talization be prioritized ahead of housing man-
agement and other fees in the payment struc-
ture; updates minimum health and safety 
standards for all military base housing, re-
quires transparency for private housing com-
pany contract performance fees, and requires 
a report on the status of other military housing 
reforms; increases transparency by requiring 
DOD to notify Congress of large expenditures 
coming from the family housing reinvestment 
accounts; repeals the provision in Title 10 that 
allowed the Department of Defense to place 
families in substandard housing units; requires 
the Secretary of Defense to implement Comp-
troller General recommendations for improve-
ment of military family housing; and authorizes 
an additional $60 million for oversight and im-
provement of the Military Housing Privatization 
Initiative (MHPI) program and to continue ad-
dressing 
environmental 
and 
maintenance 
issues in government-owned family housing. 
Other important provisions that I am pleased 
are in the conference report include the fol-
lowing: establishes an independent commis-
sion to make binding recommendations to the 
Secretary of Defense for the modification or 
removal of all names, symbols, displays, 
monuments, and paraphernalia that honor or 
commemorate the Confederate States of 
America or any person who served voluntarily 
with the Confederate States of America from 
all assets of the Department of Defense; 
amends the national emergency military con-
struction authority (10 USC 2808) to set an 
annual limit of $100 million for the domestic 
use of the authority and $500 million for over-
seas projects, with an exception for medical 
projects that may be necessary to support re-
sponse to a health emergency or pandemic; 
does not backfill military construction funds 
stolen for the border wall; makes technical 
corrections to the Paid Parental Leave benefit 
provided through the FY20 National Defense 
Authorization Act to ensure that Federal Avia-
tion Administration, Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and certain other civilian employees in-
advertently omitted from the legislation receive 
the paid parental leave benefit; establishes the 
Office of Local Defense Community Coopera-
tion and codifies in law the Department of De-
fense entity that runs the Joint Land Use 
Study, DOD Schools, Defense Community In-
frastructure Program, and Defense Manufac-
turing Community Support Program to ensure 
stability and effective community engagement; 
authorizes $50 million for the Defense Com-
munity Infrastructure Program (DCIP) and 
clarifies congressional intent with respect to 
the implementation of the program; provides 
long overdue benefits to Vietnam-Era Vet-
erans, adding hypothyroidism, bladder cancer 
and Parkinsonism to the Agent Orange Pre-
sumptive Conditions List; and prohibits retire-
ment of the RQ–4 or U–2 aircraft until specific 
certifications or waivers have been provided to 
Congress. 
I’m also pleased this NDAA includes a 3 
percent pay raise for our troops and includes 
several provisions that establish a National 
Maritime Logistics Fleet to bolster America’s 
maritime sector. This is accomplished by 
strengthening US-flagged vessel requirements 
for the transportation of military cargo and 
fuels, creating a Tanker Security Program to 
address the shortfall in US-flagged, US- 
crewed tankers, and requiring the Navy to ini-
tiate an affordable, domestic built sealift ship. 
Strengthening our maritime logistics will bol-
ster our nation’s commercial shipping industry 
and enhance our military’s capabilities by im-
proving the overarching defense industrial 
base that supports each branch of our armed 
services. 
I am also pleased with the inclusion of the 
remaining provision of my bill, H.R. 2617, the 
Occupational and Environmental Transparency 
Health Act, to require DoD to integrate infor-
mation from the Burn Pit Registry into 
servicemembers’ Electronic Health Records to 
aid in the collection, documentation, and track-
ing of any exposures to Occupational Environ-
mental Health (OEH) hazards. The legislative

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6935 
December 8, 2020 
intent of H.R. 2617 has been fully accom-
plished through the NDAA as last year’s FY20 
NDAA required DoD to input any OEH haz-
ards exposure into servicemembers’ records 
while deployed so it is tracked throughout their 
career and into veteran status. 
Overall, I am proud of the Readiness Sub-
committee’s contribution to this year’s bill and 
would like to thank the Readiness staff, Brian 
Garrett, Jeanine Womble, Melanie Harris, Jay 
Vallario, John Muller, Dave Sienicki, and Sean 
Falvey, and my personal staff, Betsy Thomp-
son, Marcus Jones, and Danusia Hubah, for 
their tireless work. Marcus and Danusia will be 
departing the Hill after next week, and I would 
like to personally thank them for their hard 
work and sharing their expertise with us this 
past year. Both Marcus and Danusia have 
been invaluable members of my staff and we 
will miss them dearly. 
This bill helps advance our military’s near- 
term readiness goals and drives the Depart-
ment to plan for and take action against long- 
term threats. The conference report also au-
thorizes funding that will strengthen DOD and 
the country’s ability to respond to potential 
COVID–19 resurgence and other infectious 
diseases in the future. With that, I urge my 
colleagues to support the FY21 NDAA. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, section 
6308 enhances U.S. law enforcement’s ability 
to access international bank records to help 
better ensure financial crimes are investigated. 
I am supportive of this new and necessary 
provision. This new authority allows the De-
partments of Treasury and Justice to issue 
subpoenas requiring production of records re-
lating to accounts held by banks outside of the 
United States. This new authority would create 
a secondary mechanism for seeking discovery 
from foreign banks separate from the Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaties (‘‘MLATs’’) or other 
multilateral or bilateral agreements the United 
States currently maintains with many foreign 
governments for this purpose. As the Depart-
ments of Justice and Treasury implement Sec-
tion 6308, I encourage them only to use this 
new authority where a foreign bank operates 
in a jurisdiction as to which no MLAT or other 
information-sharing agreement exists or where 
the relevant foreign government has not satis-
fied its obligations under an MLAT or other in-
formation-sharing agreement. 
Many foreign countries restrict banks oper-
ating in their jurisdictions from sharing their 
customers’ financial or personally identifiable 
information (‘‘PII’). As a result, subpoenas 
issued under section 6308 may place foreign 
banks in the difficult position of either violating 
home country law or being in contempt for fail-
ure to comply with a subpoena issued by the 
United States government. As a result, I be-
lieve it is appropriate for the Departments of 
Justice and Treasury to take into consideration 
conflict of laws situations to achieve the pur-
poses of Section 6308 while also maintaining 
a respect for home country requirements. 
Finally, I encourage the Departments of 
Treasury and Justice to issue regulations es-
tablishing appropriate protocols to ensure that 
the authority granted under section 6308 does 
not supersede or supplant existing MLATs or 
other multilateral or bilateral agreements be-
tween the United States and the relevant for-
eign government that are available for obtain-
ing records from a foreign bank. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in oppo-
sition to the Conference Report for H.R. 6395, 
the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
This bill contains many important provisions 
that should become law, but unfortunately 
those laudable policies are outweighed by the 
staggering cost and I cannot support the bill 
as a whole. 
I am grateful for the Conferees’ work to in-
clude language increasing treatment and ben-
efits for veterans by expanding the types of 
diseases that are presumed connected with 
exposure to Agent Orange. I also strongly 
support the pay increase for our troops, the 
removal of names and symbols associated 
with the racist legacy of the Confederacy, and 
the bolstering of paid parental leave policies 
across the federal government. I commend 
Chairman SMITH for his ongoing work to ad-
vance legislation that improves the military’s 
prevention of sexual assault and support for 
survivors, takes encouraging steps to address 
climate change, and prevents the misuse of 
taxpayer money on a wasteful border wall. In 
response to authoritarian tactics by federal 
agents in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere, 
the Chairman and House Conferees also 
achieved bipartisan support for a policy I 
championed requiring that any federal forces 
responding to a protest or civil disturbance by 
clearly identifiable. 
I cannot ignore, however, the unprece-
dented amount of military spending that this 
legislation would authorize. Amid a national 
crisis precipitated by a global pandemic, voting 
to allow billions of dollars to be spent on 
weapons is unjustifiable when our commu-
nities desperately need food and housing se-
curity, access to childcare, affordable health 
care, and small business support. We must 
not accept the notion that annual increases in 
defense spending are somehow inevitable and 
can be rationalized as modest when adding 
just one percent costs billions of dollars that 
should instead be invested domestically in 
schools or infrastructure. 
I do not take this vote lightly and my com-
mitment to providing for our servicemembers 
remains steadfast. It is a complex and chal-
lenging task to responsibly fund our national 
defense, but I am confident that we can main-
tain adequate security while reining in the im-
mense and ever-increasing sums that end-
lessly pour into the military-industrial complex. 
I look forward to continued engagement with 
my colleagues as we address these difficult 
issues.

SEC. 117. FEDERAL INTEREST DETERMINATION. 
Section 905 of the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2282) is amend-
ed by inserting after subsection (a) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(b) FEDERAL INTEREST DETERMINATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(A) ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMU-
NITIES.—In preparing a feasibility report 
under subsection (a) for a study that will 
benefit an economically disadvantaged com-
munity, upon request by the non-Federal in-
terest for the study, the Secretary shall first 
determine the Federal interest in carrying 
out the study and the projects that may be 
proposed in the study. 
‘‘(B) OTHER COMMUNITIES.— 
‘‘(i) AUTHORIZATION.—In preparing a feasi-
bility report under subsection (a) for a study 
that will benefit a covered community, upon 
request by the non-Federal interest for the 
study, the Secretary may, with respect to 
not more than 3 studies in each fiscal year, 
first determine the Federal interest in car-
rying out the study and the projects that 
may be proposed in the study. 
‘‘(ii) COVERED
COMMUNITIES.—In this sub-
paragraph, the term ‘covered community’ 
means a community that— 
‘‘(I) is not an economically disadvantaged 
community; and 
‘‘(II) the Secretary finds has a compelling 
need for the Secretary to make a determina-
tion under clause (i). 
‘‘(2) COST
SHARE.—The costs of a deter-
mination under paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) shall be at Federal expense; and 
‘‘(B) shall not exceed $200,000. 
‘‘(3) DEADLINE.—A determination under 
paragraph (1) shall be completed by not later 
than 120 days after the date on which funds 
are made available to the Secretary to carry 
out the determination. 
‘‘(4) TREATMENT.— 
‘‘(A) TIMING.—The period during which a 
determination is being completed under 
paragraph (1) for a study shall not be in-
cluded for purposes of the deadline to com-
plete a final feasibility report under section 
1001(a)(1) of the Water Resources Reform and 
Development 
Act 
of 
2014 
(33 
U.S.C. 
2282c(a)(1)). 
‘‘(B) COST.—The cost of a determination 
under paragraph (1) shall not be included for 
purposes of the maximum Federal cost under 
section 1001(a)(2) of the Water Resources Re-
form and Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 
2282c(a)(2)). 
‘‘(5) REPORT TO NON-FEDERAL INTEREST.—If, 
based on a determination under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary determines that a study or 
project is not in the Federal interest because 
the project will not result, or is unlikely to 
result, in a recommended plan that will 
produce national economic development ben-
efits greater than cost, but may result in a 
technically sound and environmentally ac-
ceptable plan that is otherwise consistent 
with section 904 of the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2281), the 
Secretary shall issue a report to the non- 
Federal interest with recommendations on 
how the non-Federal interest might modify 
the proposal such that the project could be 
in the Federal interest and feasible.’’.

cane and storm damage risk reduction 
project for an economically disadvantaged 
community; 
(B) upon request of a non-Federal interest 
for such a project, provide technical assist-
ance to such non-Federal interest in the for-
mulation of a proposal for a potential feasi-
bility study to be submitted to the Secretary 
under the pilot program; and 
(C) review such proposals and select 10 fea-
sibility studies for such projects to be car-
ried out by the Secretary, in coordination 
with the non-Federal interest, under this 
pilot program. 
(3) SELECTION CRITERIA.—In selecting a fea-
sibility study under paragraph (2)(C), the 
Secretary shall consider whether— 
(A) the percentage of people living in pov-
erty in the county or counties (or county- 
equivalent entity or entities) in which the 
project is located is greater than the per-
centage of people living in poverty in the 
State, based on census bureau data; 
(B) the percentage of families with income 
above the poverty threshold but below the 
average household income in the county or 
counties (or county-equivalent entity or en-
tities) in which the project is located is 
greater than such percentage for the State, 
based on census bureau data; 
(C) the percentage of the population that 
identifies as belonging to a minority or in-
digenous group in the county or counties (or 
county-equivalent entity or entities) in 
which the project is located is greater than 
the average such percentage in the State, 
based on census bureau data; and 
(D) the project is addressing flooding or 
hurricane or storm damage effects that have 
a disproportionate impact on a rural commu-
nity, a minority community, or an Indian 
Tribe. 
(4) ADMINISTRATION.—Notwithstanding the 
requirements of section 105(a)(1)(A) of the 
Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33

It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the Arctic, as defined in section 112 of 
the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 
(Public Law 98–373), is a region of strategic 
importance to the national security and 
maritime transportation interests of the 
United States; 
(2) there is a compelling national, regional, 
Alaska Native, and private sector need for 
permanent maritime transportation infra-
structure development and for a presence in 
the Arctic by the United States to assert na-
tional security interests and to support and 
facilitate search and rescue, shipping safety, 
economic development, oil spill prevention 
and response, subsistence and commercial 
fishing, the establishment of ports of refuge, 
Arctic research, and maritime law enforce-
ment; 
(3) the Government of the Russian Federa-
tion has prioritized the development of Arc-
tic maritime transportation capabilities and 
has made significant investments in military 
infrastructure in the Arctic, including the 
construction or refurbishment of 16 deep-
water ports in the region; 
(4) is a serious concern that the closest 
United States strategic seaports to the Arc-
tic are the Port of Anchorage and the Port of 
Tacoma, located approximately 1,500 nau-
tical miles and 2,400 nautical miles away 
from the Arctic, respectively, and approxi-
mately 1,900 nautical miles and 2,800 nautical 
miles, respectively, from Utiagvik, Alaska; 
and 
(5) it is in the national interest to enhance 
existing, and develop, maritime transpor-
tation infrastructure in the Arctic, including 
an Arctic deep draft strategic seaport in 
Alaska, that would allow the Coast Guard 
and the Navy each to perform their respec-
tive statutory duties and functions on a per-
manent basis with minimal mission inter-
ruption. 
SEC. 155. SMALL WATER STORAGE PROJECTS.

SEC. 513. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks, including extraneous material 
on S. 1811, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
legislation 
very 
similar to this passed the House of 
Representatives unanimously earlier 
this year. This bill will continue the bi-
partisan tradition restarted by Chair-
man Shuster in 2014 of doing a Water 
Resources Development Act every 2 
years. It is critical. 
I am thankful to Ranking Member 
GRAVES, Chairwoman GRACE
NAPOLI-
TANO, 
and 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member BRUCE WESTERMAN for their 
hard work in developing the House 
version and helping us negotiate with 
the Senate. I also thank our Senate 
colleagues, Committee on Environment 
and Public Works Chairman JOHN BAR-
RASSO, who has pushed very hard for 
this bill, and Ranking Member TOM 
CARPER, for their collaboration. 
Madam Speaker, this builds on the 
success of H.R. 7575, which, as I said, 
passed the House of Representatives 
earlier this year unanimously. It au-
thorizes construction of 46 reports of 
the Chief of the Corps of Engineers. It 
is a record number of Chief’s Reports, 
almost matching the number author-
ized in 2016 and 2018. 
Now, that would only be made pos-
sible by the full utilization of the har-
bor maintenance trust fund. For dec-
ades, since Ronald Reagan was Presi-
dent, we have been assessing a tiny ad 
valorem tax on the value of goods and 
containers flowing through the ports 
coming into the United States of 
America. 
Despite the pressing need to dredge 
our harbors, to authorize steps to re-
pair jetties before they fail totally and 
become much more expensive to re-
place, for many years Congress refused 
to spend that full amount of money. 
There is now around $10 billion col-
lected in taxes from the American peo-
ple for a specific purpose for which it 
has not been spent. 
I started working on this with Bud 
Shuster—not Bill—Bud Shuster, his 
dad, back in 1996 to access the full 
amount of the harbor maintenance 
trust fund. It got out of that com-
mittee twice under Chairman Shuster. 
He was quite amazed it came out 
unanimously, including Freedom Cau-
cus members and others, but Paul 
Ryan saw fit to strip it from the bill 
because he didn’t think that we should 
maintain our harbors and our ports as 
a maritime Nation. I guess being in-
land, he didn’t think that was so im-
portant. 
We now have finally gotten to that 
point where we are going to access the 
funds. There is one tiny remaining 
problem—since the Senate seems to be 
totally incapable of passing any indi-
vidual pieces of legislation and doing 
nothing individually except judges—we 
are seeking to attach this to the Omni-
bus, Continuing Resolution, budget 
deal, whatever the heck you want to 
call it. 
Now, the Committee on Appropria-
tions in the Senate has raised con-
cerns. Even though this does not count 
officially against allocations on an an-
nual basis, they are worried that some-
how someone might look at them and 
say, Well you have got all this other 
money, so we are going to cut back on 
your regular amount of money. That is 
not going to happen. This need is great. 
This is a huge bipartisan success 
with agreement by harbors all around 
the country, large and small, emerging, 
developed, energy ports. It is critical to 
the United States of America as a mar-
itime Nation that we get this done and 
we begin to do the work on a daily 
basis. 
Of our 58 largest harbors, 35 percent 
are at their authorized depths. That 
means ships go around, that means 
ships have to pass too close to one an-
other in order to navigate restricted 
channels. It means jetties that are be-
ginning to fail don’t get fixed, and 
every year that they fail they become 
much, much more expensive to repair 
until the point of total failure, at 
which point it becomes incredibly ex-
pensive. 
Madam Speaker, should we access 
the harbor maintenance trust fund 
over the next 5 years at $2 billion a 
year, plus the expected income, we 
could bring all of our ports up to a 
state of good repair in 5 years. What 
the Senate staff is insisting on would 
stretch that out for 20 years—and actu-
ally, would stretch it out longer, be-
cause if you start doing things 18 years 
from now, they would have deterio-
rated even more and become more ex-
pensive. So they would, essentially, in-
definitely put off bringing our harbors 
to a state of good repair because of un-
founded concern. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that 
common sense will prevail, if there is 
any such thing on the other side of 
Capitol Hill. 
I want to go back to thanking mem-
bers of our committee and the staff 
who did great work on this bill. It is an 
excellent bill. 
It also deals with inland waterways 
on a cost-share basis. It deals with 
building in resilience to deal with cli-
mate change—even if you don’t believe 
in it—and will use natural systems as 
much as possible for these needs. 
Chairwoman GRACE NAPOLITANO, who 
did not travel here today, was dogged 
in her support for the maintenance 
needs and advocacy for her large har-
bors. And ultimately, we came to an 
agreement, as I said, between all sizes 
of harbors around the country. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank my 
ranking member, SAM
GRAVES. He 
couldn’t have been a better partner in 
helping us deal with the other side of 
Capitol Hill, and Mr. WESTERMAN for 
his steadfast support and importance 
to the final bill. Today’s success would 
not have been possible without their 
great work.

There are a number of members of 
the committee who were particularly 
crucial: 
DEBBIE
MUCARSEL-POWELL, 
ABBY
FINKENAUER, 
HARLEY
ROUDA, 
CONOR
LAMB, 
ANGIE
CRAIG, 
CHRIS 
PAPPAS, 
ANTONIO
DELGADO, 
LIZZIE 
FLETCHER, GREG STANTON, and SHARICE 
DAVIDS, all members of the committee 
who contributed significantly to this. 
And also, we did lose the language to 
reauthorize the Clean Water State Re-
volving Fund, which hasn’t been reau-
thorized since 1987. I kind of thought it 
was time but, apparently, that is right 
now not on the radar of some people. 
Madam Speaker, the Water Resources De-
velopment Act (WRDA) is legislation that is 
essential to everyday American life-supporting 
jobs and our economy, protecting American 
lives and property, and restoring and pro-
tecting our vital natural resources. The Water 
Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA 
2020) modernizes and invests in our water re-
sources infrastructure by: (1) authorizing crit-
ical, locally driven U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers (Corps) projects and studies; (2) expe-
diting the delivery of future projects; (3) in-
creasing water storage and supply; (4) pre-
venting, managing, and eradicating invasive 
species that reduce and degrade our water re-
sources infrastructure and the environment; 
(5) building resiliency to increasing storm and 
flooding risks: (6) increasing community and 
Tribal involvement and engagement; and (7) 
addressing communities with affordability con-
cerns. WRDA 2020 strengthens our Nation’s 
security and economic competitiveness by 
deepening our ports and harbors, maintaining 
our inland waterways, and providing protection 
from dangerous flooding, while remaining 
committed 
to 
economically 
and 
environ-
mentally responsible development. 
In WRDA bills, Congress authorizes studies 
and projects encompassing the key missions 
of the Corps, including supporting coastal and 
inland waterways infrastructure, effective and 
targeted flood protection, environmental res-
toration, 
storm 
damage 
prevention, 
and 
proactive water supply initiatives. Each of the 
46 completed feasibility study reports of the 
Chief of Engineers (Chiefs Reports) authorized 
by WRDA 2020 were locally driven and cost- 
shared, rigorously studied, and determined by 
the Corps to be economically justified, tech-
nically sound, and environmentally acceptable. 
Since 2014, Congress has resumed the tra-
dition of biennial consideration of WRDAs, and 
WRDA 2020 continues to deliver new authori-
ties on a predictable authorization cycle to 
meet the water resource needs of local com-
munities and to provide appropriate oversight 
of, and policy direction to, the Administration 
and the Corps. The transformative nature of 
the last three WRDA bills has provided the 
Corps and the non-Federal interests with new 
opportunities to advance projects more quickly 
and with greater effectiveness. WRDA 2020 
builds on these changes by ensuring that fu-
ture water resources development projects are 
developed in a resilient and more sustainable 
manner, by targeting increased Federal assist-
ance to rural and economically-disadvantaged 
communities and Tribes that have seen chal-
lenges in implementing critical water resources 
infrastructure, and by modernizing the process 
for project development to ensure that all 
project benefits, including economical, re-
gional, environmental, and other societal ben-
efits, are considered in the formulation of fu-
ture projects. 
Title 1 of WRDA 2020 ensures that the 
Corps operates and executes projects to meet 
our Nation’s ever evolving 21st century needs. 
This title supports our transportation infrastruc-
ture and ensures the efficient flow of domestic 
and international commerce by reinstating the 
Federal commitment to our ports, harbors, and 
inland waterways. It builds on the CARES Act 
(Pub. L. 116–136) by unlocking funds that 
have already been collected from shippers for 
the purpose of harbor deepening and mainte-
nance, and that have remained unspent, in the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) while 
there are unmet operation and maintenance 
needs at ports and harbors. In addition, this 
title establishes a new authorization framework 
for the allocation of harbor maintenance funds 
to ensure equitable expenditures to meet the 
ongoing needs of the Nation’s largest ports, 
Commercial Strategic Seaports, Great Lakes 
Harbors, and emerging harbors. Title 1 also 
addresses critical needs to modernize our 
Federal inland waterway system by author-
izing additional funds from the General Fund 
of the Treasury towards the construction of 
projects on the Inland Waterway System, 
which handles approximately half of all inland 
waterway freight and one-twelfth of all national 
freight. 
Further, Title 1 of WRDA 2020 ensures that 
future water resources development projects 
are designed and built with greater resiliency 
to address the needs of the next century. For 
example, this title directs the Corps to con-
sider nature-based and natural features while 
developing projects, and advocates for innova-
tion that ensures the resiliency and longevity 
of Corps construction. Similarly, this title rec-
ognizes the needs of communities that are 
currently facing repeat flooding events by pro-
viding critical assistance for the expedited con-
sideration of permanent measures to reduce 
local flooding risks. 
Moreover, Title 1 makes policy reforms to 
promote stronger local-level partnerships, de-
cisionmaking, 
and 
effective, 
transparent 
project development and implementation that 
will overall improve water infrastructure devel-
opment. Other provisions within this title en-
sure the protection of all communities through 
wider consideration of project benefits and 
greater flexibility and support for populations 
with affordability concerns. Title 1 also helps 
communities respond faster to natural disas-
ters, improves the safety of our dams and lev-
ees, addresses necessary updates to aging in-
frastructure, and supports critical work against 
invasive species and harmful algal blooms. 
Lastly, this title recognizes the increasing role 
the Corps plays in addressing the water sup-
ply and water conservation needs of local and 
rural communities. 
Title 2 of WRDA 2020 ensures continuity in 
addressing our water resources development 
needs. It authorizes feasibility studies for the 
development of future projects, while ensuring 
that studies currently underway are completed 
expeditiously. Title 2 also makes necessary 
adjustments to existing studies or projects to 
ensure they are forward-looking and encom-
pass as many potential benefits to the local-
ities as practicable. In addition, this title au-
thorizes the analysis of regional or watershed- 
based systems which facilitates cohesive 
projects and greater end results for the sys-
tems without inadvertently segmenting out 
populations or sub-systems. Further, this title 
directs the Corps to examine and report back 
on various Corps internal processes and as-
sets to identify additional opportunities for 
Corps expertise and improvement in work effi-
cacy. 
Title 3 addresses ongoing Corps operations 
and opportunities to ensure efficient project 
delivery as well as remove outdated or dupli-
cative Corps authorizations. Continuing in the 
tradition of the last three WRDAs, WRDA 
2020 directs the Corps to identify approxi-
mately $10 billion in antiquated construction 
authorizations that can be deauthorized, which 
is roughly equivalent to the cost of the new 
Chiefs Reports authorized by this legislation. 
In addition, the revisions and updates to 
projects in Title 3, on advisement from the 
Corps, will keep those projects on track for de-
livery and maintain the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of these Federal investments. This title 
also makes modifications to existing programs 
within the Corps to include a wider range of 
eligible regions for those programs and pro-
vide them with sufficient authorization levels to 
achieve their central purposes. 
Further, Title 3 deauthorizes or transfers, in 
part or in whole, certain projects which are no 
longer within the mission of the Corps or are 
otherwise better suited as returned to the lo-
calities. These actions maintain Corps de-
pendability and its relationships with non-Fed-
eral sponsors and stakeholders, while alle-
viating superfluous lands or projects that 
should be returned to states and localities and 
removed from Corps responsibilities. 
Title 4 of WRDA 2020 affirms the Federal 
commitment to delivering water resources 
projects and the continued improvement of 
American water infrastructure. Again, this title 
authorizes 46 Corps projects to move to con-
struction and makes changes to projects cur-
rently underway to guarantee their accuracy 
and long-term value. Projects authorized 
under WRDA 2020 will sustain jobs and our 
economic competitiveness by maintaining the 
flow of goods through our navigational chan-
nels and protecting American lives, land, and 
assets from flood or storm waters. The 
projects will restore and enhance our natural 
resources, ecosystems and environment, and 
prepare communities for increasingly wet or 
dry conditions. These essential projects will 
positively impact populations in all regions of 
the country and build smarter, more resilient 
infrastructure for the benefit of generations to 
come. 
Title 5 of this bill makes several changes to 
Corps and other Federal agency authorities 
related to the control of invasive species or for 
other purposes. Invasive species have a dev-
astating impact on our Nation’s water infra-
structure, as well as on our water supply. In-
creasingly, the Corps is required to partner 
with other Federal agencies to control the 
spread of invasive species, both on land and 
in the aquatic environment. The changes 
made by this title include the creation of new 
pilot programs to address invasive species 
such as Asian Carp, elodea, and quagga mus-
sels, as well as noxious weeds. This title also 
retains the traditional roles of the Corps and 
other Federal agencies in controlling the 
spread or managing and reducing existing 
invasive species.

tem. This section authorizes additional funds 
from the General Fund of the Treasury to-
wards the construction of authorized inland 
waterways projects. The Managers have au-
thorized this change to the current 50–50 cost 
share for inland projects to resolve the back-
log in these critical projects, and intend that 
any inland project that received construction 
assistance prior to fiscal year 2030 utilize the 
new 75–25 cost share authorized by this sec-
tion through completion of the project. The 
Managers also expect that this additional sup-
port will be prioritized for those projects identi-
fied by inland users as most essential in the 
20-year capital development plan required 
under section 302(d) of WRDA 1986, including 
the Upper Ohio navigation system, the Navi-
gation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program 
for the Upper Mississippi River, and the Three 
Rivers project in Southeast Arkansas. It is the 
intention 
of 
the 
Managers 
that 
current 
prioritization plans be followed by the Corps in 
its funding of inland waterway projects. 
Section 112 directs the Corps to ensure 
meaningful participation and consultation by 
economically disadvantaged communities and 
Indian Tribes in the development of future 
water resources projects. During formulation of 
WRDA 2020, the Managers heard concerns 
from economically disadvantaged communities 
and Indian Tribes of a lack of transparency 
and meaningful communication with these 
communities. Managers expect that contin-
uous commitment to, and review of, Corps 
policies surrounding community engagement 
and tribal consultation will minimize adverse 
impacts to these populations, including detri-
mental impacts to their health, property, and 
livelihoods. It is the Managers’ intention that 
the Corps complete reviews and make adjust-
ments, if warranted, to procedures expedi-
tiously to ameliorate concerns and avoid con-
flict with existing and future water resources 
projects. 
Section 125 renews the Congressional com-
mitment to beneficial use of dredged material. 
While carrying out the beneficial use of 
dredged material pilot program pursuant to 
section 1122 of WRDA 2016, the Corps is di-
rected to carry out at least one project utilizing 
thin layer placement of dredged fine and 
coarse grain sediment. This demonstration 
program is also authorized to be expanded to 
apply to recovering lost storage capacity in 
reservoirs due to sediment accumulation, if the 
project meets the other criteria within the pro-
gram. The Corps is directed to carry out at 
least one project to recover lost storage ca-
pacity under the program as well. With this 
section, Managers expect the Corps to select 
projects that encompass a wide range of re-
gional areas, economic status, and utilization 
methods. 
Additionally, this section further encourages 
the Corps to coordinate planning for the de-
ployment of Federal and non-Federal dredges. 
In sequencing dredging work to benefit mul-
tiple mission sets and providing consistent 
navigational certainty, especially in areas of 
high maritime traffic in our Nation’s harbors 
and waterways, the Managers believe proper 
implementation of this program will benefit the 
American economy and restoration efforts 
alike. The Managers intend this authority to be 
used in conjunction with the Gulf Coast Re-
gional Dredge Demonstration Program created 
in P.L. 116–94, the Further Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2020. 
Section 161 makes changes to the study 
process pursuant to section 203 of WRDA 
1986. As required by this section, this new 
policy does not apply to any project being au-
thorized by this Act. Further these changes do 
not apply to any feasibility study submitted to 
the Corps during the one-year period prior to 
the date of enactment of this section, such as 
the Raymondville Drain Project, Lower Rio 
Grande Basin, Texas. 
Subsection 201(b) states that the Corps is 
to consider any study carried out by the Corps 
for Port Arthur and Orange County, Texas, 
flood control project, to be a continuation of 
the study authorized under Sabine Pass to 
Galveston Bay, Texas. While subsection (a) 
explicitly authorizes a study for Port Arthur 
and Orange County, Texas, the Managers in-
tend that nothing in subsection 201(b) will 
slow down the construction of the project for 
Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay, Texas. 
Section 213 directs the Corps to conduct a 
comprehensive study of the Lower Mississippi 
River. The Managers note that the Mississippi 
River has been at flood stage at record length 
and frequency in recent years. The Managers 
intend this study to provide reconsideration of 
the operations of existing assets by operating 
structures throughout the Lower Mississippi 
River holistically and, potentially, for multiple 
purposes per asset, as well as identifying new 
projects and utilizing existing Federal and non- 
Federal assets, such as river reintroduction 
projects, new or existing reservoirs, water sup-
ply projects, or other measures. In completing 
the study, the Managers intend for the Corps 
to collaborate with all levels of government, as 
well as with non-governmental entities to im-
prove the management of one of the largest 
watersheds in the world. 
Section 216 includes studies for the Lower 
and Upper Missouri River. With a General In-
vestigations study of the Lower Missouri River 
Basin already underway, the Managers intend 
this section to build off this existing authority 
and to expeditiously review both a comprehen-
sive plan and site-specific solutions to combat 
flooding in communities across the Lower Mis-
souri River Basin. While this Act specifically 
and preemptively waives 3x3x3 requirements, 
the Managers strongly encourage the Corps to 
complete its studies as expeditiously as pos-
sible. 
Section 222 requires the Corps to issue an 
annual report that identifies all authorized 
studies or projects meeting certain criteria, in-
cluding local support and the Corps’ capability 
for executing the work. The Managers expect 
this annual report will provide greater trans-
parency in the Administration’s development of 
both its annual budget and its project selection 
process. 
In completing this report, the Corps must 
describe specific benefits for each authorized 
study and authorized water resources devel-
opment project included in the annual report. 
This section also requires the Secretary to in-
clude an appendix in the annual report that 
lists any submitted proposals that were not in-
cluded in the annual report and a description 
of why the Corps determined that those pro-
posals did not meet the criteria for inclusion. 
The Corps shall also make the annual report 
to Congress publicly available on the internet 
and is directed to submit the report to Con-
gress along with its annual report pursuant to 
section 7001 of Water Resources Reform and 
Development Act of 2014, P.L. 113–121 
(WRRDA 2014). 
The Managers intend for the Corps to expe-
ditiously develop implementation guidance for 
the provisions contained in WRDA 2020, as 
well as provisions from prior WRDAs that have 
yet to be developed. Section 223 of WRDA 
2020 directs the Corps to expeditiously com-
plete these actions, and consistent with sec-
tion 1105 of WRDA 2018, to involve stake-
holders in the development of guidance mate-
rials. In addition, the Managers direct the Sec-
retary to directly engage and consult with, and 
provide briefings for, the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure and the Committee 
on Environment on Public Works on these ac-
tions. 
Section 229 amends section 1104(b) of 
WRDA 2018 to require that the Corps provide 
the Committee on Environment and Public 
Works of the Senate and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the House 
of Representatives an annual written update 
on the Corps’ implementation of non-Federal 
outreach requirements associated with devel-
opment of section 7001 annual reports. This 
section also requires that the Corps issue 
guidance for the uniform implementation of the 
7001 process by Corps districts and ensure 
annual compliance with that guidance. The 
Managers continue to be concerned with the 
agency’s ability to consistently implement 
these policies nationwide. 
Section 310 clarifies that any Federal funds 
used to carry out construction of the McClel-
lan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System 
(MKARNS) are considered as initiating con-
struction of the project such that future funds 
will not require a new start designation. With 
initial construction of the MKARNS completed 
50 years ago, modernization of the entire 
channel was authorized by Congress in 2003 
and funds were subsequently provided in 
2004. Since that time, the 12-foot deepening 
project has stalled, but this section will allow 
construction of the project to resume without 
the requirement to obtain a New Start, a re-
quirement not contemplated when the deep-
ening project was authorized and funded. This 
section will ensure the project is formally con-
sidered as a project resumption for budgetary 
and appropriations purposes. 
Section 348 allows a local government enti-
ty, such as a city, with existing water supply 
storage in a Federal or non-Federal hydro-
power lake within the Arkansas Basin, to ac-
cess that water supply at a cost of not more 
than 110 percent of initial principal cost for the 
acre-feet sought for a new covered contract 
for that lake. This section makes clear that the 
Managers do not expect the Corps to under-
take any formal reallocation process. Rather, 
the Managers expect that the Corps will work 
only with a local government entity that cur-
rently holds the rights to access water supply 
storage. 
Section 351 allows the Corps, at the request 
of a non-Federal interest, to renegotiate the 
terms and conditions of deferred payment 
agreements under Section 103(k) of WRDA 
1986 and to accept, without interest, the pre- 
payment of non-Federal contributions. The 
Managers anticipate that the non-Federal 
sponsors of the West Bank and Vicinity, Lake

Projects are expected to seek relief under this 
section in order to continue large-scale invest-
ments to support resiliency in both their infra-
structure and regional ecosystems. 
Section 401 authorizes 46 Chief’s Reports, 
including a project for navigation improve-
ments for the Port of Nome in Nome, Alaska. 
Nome will be America’s first Arctic deep draft 
port, enhancing our strategic and economic 
competitiveness in the Arctic region. The Man-
agers note the complementary and important 
role that modest improvements at Port Clar-
ence/Point Spencer can play relative to the 
project at Nome, Alaska, and for safe Arctic 
transportation generally, and therefore, the 
Managers encourage the Corps of Engineers 
to expedite its consideration of the use of Sec-
tion 107 Continuing Authorities Program fund-
ing to help install and make operational the 
two 30-ton and one 60-ton industrial grade 
buoy systems at Port Clarence to serve mari-
time safety needs for the Bering Strait as well 
as the greater Arctic region. The Managers 
also encourage the potential use of unobli-
gated prior-year funds to facilitate the imple-
mentation of the mooring buoy project as soon 
as possible and note that the Corps was in-
strumental in completing a similar project for 
the placement and use of commercial-grade 
mooring buoys in the Columbia River. 
Various sections under Title 5 of WRDA 
2020 protect American assets and resources 
by working to prevent the spread and promote 
the eradication of certain invasive species. 
The Managers intend that work conducted as 
a result of this Title remain within the jurisdic-
tion of the involved agencies and encourage a 
collaborative approach to solutions that allows 
each agency to utilize its expertise. Specifi-
cally, under section 508, the Managers intend 
that, for those authorities which address mur-
der hornets as an invasive species, the De-
partment of the Interior shall work in conjunc-
tion with the Department of Agriculture. 
The Managers believe lessees of rec-
reational and other facilities at water resource 
development projects should have more pre-
dictability and stability with regard to their re-
spective lease agreements with the Corps. 
The Managers are, in conjunction with enact-
ment of WRDA 2020, requesting the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to 
analyze Corps of Engineers policies related to 
the length of commercial concessionaire con-
tracts. In the interim, the Managers believe 
that the Corps should consider the use of con-
cessionaire lease agreements for a period of 
not less than 25 years and not more than 50 
years, unless otherwise agreed to by the les-
see. This effective tool will provide greater 
predictability and stability in the use of Corps 
lands by the lessee. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Washington, DC, December 4, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair, Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR DEFAZIO: In recognition of the 
goal of expediting consideration of S. 1811, 
‘‘A bill to make technical corrections to the 
America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, 
and for other purposes’’ the Committee on 
Natural Resources agrees to waive formal 
consideration of the bill as to provisions that 
fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
The Committee on Natural Resources 
takes this action with the mutual under-
standing that, in doing so, we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that 
the Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as the bill or similar leg-
islation moves forward so that we may ad-
dress any remaining issues within our juris-
diction. Our Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of conferees to 
any House-Senate conference involving this 
or similar legislation. 
Thank you for agreeing to include our ex-
change of letters in the Congressional 
Record. I appreciate your cooperation re-
garding this legislation and look forward to 
continuing to work with you as this measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, House Natural Resources Committee. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, 
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Washington, DC, December 4, 2020. 
Hon. RAU´ L GRIJALVA, 
Chair, Committee on Natural Resources, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR GRIJALVA: Thank you for your 
letter regarding S. 1811, A bill to make tech-
nical corrections to the America’s Water In-
frastructure Act of 2018, and for other pur-
poses. I appreciate your decision to waive 
formal consideration of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Natural Re-
sources has valid jurisdictional claims to 
certain provisions in this important legisla-
tion, and I further agree that by forgoing 
formal consideration of the bill, the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources is not waiving 
any jurisdiction over any relevant subject 
matter. Additionally, I will support the ap-
pointment of conferees from the Committee 
on Natural Resources should a House-Senate 
conference be convened on this legislation. 
Finally, this exchange of letters will be in-
cluded in the Congressional Record when the 
bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on Natural Resources on this im-
portant issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, some of what I say 
today is going to be a little redundant, 
but I think it does bear repeating. 
I do stand here in strong support of 
the amended version of S. 1811, which is 
the Water Resources Development Act 
2020 or WRDA. The bill represents a bi-
partisan, bicameral compromise. It re-
news our commitment to regularly 
consider water resources infrastructure 
legislation. 
And I remind my House colleagues 
and reiterate what the chairman said, 
we unanimously passed a bipartisan 
WRDA bill out of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
we unanimously passed it on the floor 
of the House in July. And now, 5 
months later, we hope to do the very 
same thing after successfully negoti-
ating with the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, WRDA 2020 author-
izes—and, again, as has been pointed 
out—60 
critical 
water 
resource 
projects. This is the most authoriza-
tions in recent history. These projects 
are going to strengthen our global 
competitiveness, they are going to 
grow the economy, they are going to 
provide flood protection for our com-
munities, they are going to safeguard 
the environment, and create jobs. 
Additionally, WRDA is fiscally re-
sponsible and deauthorizes old projects 
to fully offset new authorizations. It 
advances inland waterway improve-
ments by adjusting the Inland Water-
ways Trust Fund cost-share; it includes 
important 
considerations 
and 
set- 
asides for rural communities; and it 
provides relief to communities, such as 
those in my home State of Missouri 
that have experienced repetitive losses 
as a result of flood events. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Chair NAPOLITANO, Ranking 
Member WESTERMAN, and committee 
members and staff on both sides for 
their efforts in this very important 
piece of legislation. 
On the Republican staff, I particu-
larly want to thank the Subcommittee 
on Water Resources and Environment 
staff: Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, and 
Victor Sarmiento. These folks have 
worked 
over 
weekends, 
they 
have 
worked over the recent holidays to 
help ensure that our priorities were in-
tact, and we could move this bill prior 
to the end of Congress—at least this 
year’s Congress. 
I thank my general counsel, Corey 
Cooke, Tara Hupman, Tyler Micheletti, 
Justin Harclerode, Abby Camp, Nick 
Christensen, Jack Ruddy, and my full 
committee staff director, Paul Sass, 
for their hard work on this and getting 
it done. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, S. 1811, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a list of the orga-
nizations supporting S. 1811, the Water

Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chair of 
the Energy and Water Development, 
and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair DEFAZIO. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act. 
There is no question that Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Chairwoman NAPOLITANO 
have worked tirelessly over the last 
year—and probably longer—to get this 
bill to the finish line. This bill delivers 
for our Nation’s crumbling water infra-
structure. 
Madam Speaker, S. 1811 enjoys broad 
bipartisan support because it pays at-
tention to the unique and particular 
needs of the different regions of our di-
verse Nation. The package includes 
provisions to protect 90 percent of 
North America’s surface fresh water on 
our Great Lakes. This includes a spe-
cific authorization of the invasive spe-
cies control system at Brandon Road 
Lock and Dam. The project serves a 
unique national role, and once com-
pleted, will serve as a bulwark for pre-
venting Asian carp and other invasive 
species from threatening the fragile 
ecosystem of our Great Lakes and its 
$7 billion fishery. 
Madam Speaker, today’s authoriza-
tion marks an important milestone for 
protecting 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
rec-
reational fishing industry. Our region 
has advocated to include this author-
ization for nearly a decade. And since 
2010, when Congress authorized the 
Great Lakes Interbasin Study, our del-
egation searched for a long-term and 
basin-wide solution to the predatory 
Asian carp. 
I commend the committee for embed-
ding resiliency into the Corps planning 
processes and for investing to rebuild 
and advance the Nation’s water infra-
structure for the 21st century. 
Finally, the bill adds the words 
‘‘Great Lakes’’ to the name of the 
Saint Lawrence Seaway Development 
Corporation, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to shine a 
light on the Seaway’s unique role in 
unleashing the economic potential of 
the region and the Nation. 
President Dwight David Eisenhower 
understood that this seaway is the 
shortest distance to Europe, and we 
must remember that today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bipartisan bill. 
b 1415 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), the ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Water Resources 
and the Environment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished ranking 
member from Missouri for his leader-
ship on continuing the biennial consid-
eration for the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act. 
Today, I rise in strong support of S. 
1811, the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2020. WRDA 2020 will strengthen 
our Nation’s ability to withstand se-
vere weather and flood events, author-
ize the construction of key water infra-
structure projects throughout the Na-
tion, create jobs here at home, and di-
rectly contribute to our economic 
growth and competitiveness. 
All 60 project authorizations con-
tained in WRDA 2020 were proposed by 
non-Federal sponsors and underwent a 
rigorous planning process before con-
gressional review. 
This WRDA bill focuses on building 
more resilient infrastructure, increas-
ing rural flood protection, addressing 
the maintenance backlog at our Na-
tion’s 
ports 
and 
harbors, 
and 
prioritizing our Nation’s inland water-
ways. 
The House passed WRDA by voice 
vote nearly 5 months ago, continuing 
the strong bipartisan tradition that 
WRDA enjoys. 
After negotiations with the Senate, I 
am glad to support this compromise 
bill, which contains nearly all of our 
Chamber’s priorities. 
S. 1811 is fiscally responsible, with 
new project authorizations fully offset 
by deauthorizations of projects that 
are outdated or no longer viable. 
Again, I want to stress that this leg-
islation represents the continuing com-
mitment to regular order for consider-
ation of water resources projects. Reg-
ularly overseeing the improvement of 
our Nation’s infrastructure is one of 
the most important responsibilities of 
Congress. 
This is a good, commonsense, and bi-
partisan bill. I want to recognize the 
great work of our subcommittee staff, 
Ian, John, and Victor. I also want to 
thank Chairman DEFAZIO and Chair-
man NAPOLITANO for their partnership 
in its creation. 
I urge all Members to support S. 1811. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
extend my congratulations to the com-
mittee leaders for successfully reach-
ing an agreement with the Senate on a 
final Water Resources Development 
Act for 2020. This is a wonderful bill. 
We have $10 billion in new water in-
frastructure authorizations in this bill. 
It authorizes all of the pending Chief’s 
reports. That includes two very impor-
tant flood risk management projects in 
my district, which has been severely 
harmed by persistent flooding in recent 
years, as evidenced by the damage from 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to remind the Army Corps that it may 
fund the construction of these projects 
out of remaining funds provided in the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and that 
construction of such projects in the 
Virgin Islands, as well as in Puerto 
Rico, with funds provided under that 
act shall be conducted at full Federal 
expense. 
This bill also contains a long-sought 
reauthorization of projects for naviga-
tion in the harbors of St. Thomas and 
Christiansted, St. Croix. The reauthor-
ization of these projects for navigation 
will provide the harbors access to Fed-
eral resources for maintenance dredg-
ing and improvements to navigational 
systems, which will allow them to ac-
commodate more and larger cruise 
ships over the long term, thereby bet-
ter competing in a competitive Carib-
bean market. This is a very strong bill 
for the ports and harbors of the United 
States. 
Lastly, this bill is probably the most 
progressive bill in a generation in 
terms of directing the Army Corps to-
ward greater resiliency of future water 
resources development projects. It in-
cludes several provisions to modernize 
how the Corps develops future projects 
to make sure that it is better able to 
deal with issues of climate change and 
extreme wet weather events. 
All in all, this is a significant invest-
ment in water resources infrastructure, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. 
BABIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
if 
southeast Texas is going to continue as 
the global leader in creating reliable, 
affordable energy, we must modernize 
and improve our water infrastructure. 
My district has four ports, including 
the main terminal of the Port of Hous-
ton, as well as the Houston Ship Chan-
nel, which is the busiest U.S. deep- 
draft waterway and the top exporting 
port in the Nation. 
The provisions of 2020’s WRDA to 
dredge, widen, and improve two-way 
traffic on the Houston Ship Channel is 
a product of hard work and collabora-
tion over the last several years. This 
major accomplishment is the corner-
stone for a more efficient, safe, and 
productive waterway for everyone. 
However, I recognize that there is 
still more work to be done. It is not an 
exaggeration to say that by spending a 
million dollars today on hurricane and 
flood prevention infrastructure, we are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6982 
December 8, 2020 
down the road from another storm like 
Hurricane Harvey. 
Thankfully, this bill contains numer-
ous provisions for me and my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle that 
address these critical needs. 
I wish to thank Ranking Member 
GRAVES as well as Chairman DEFAZIO, 
Mr. WESTERMAN, and Mrs. NAPOLITANO. 
Passing legislation like this one today 
will bring great benefit to southeast 
Texas and the entire country. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairman DEFAZIO for 
his leadership, his staff for working 
hard on this particular bill, and the 
ranking member and his staff for doing 
this. 
I want to talk about one project that 
got added, and that is the Chacon 
Creek in Laredo, Texas. This is a 
project that we have been working on 
for many years with the city of Laredo. 
Now, this will provide the flood con-
trol, the work that we need to do, that 
starts off from Lake Casa Blanca all 
the way to the Rio Grande, miles of 
area that will provide not only for the 
environment but also for the quality of 
life for Laredo. 
I want to thank Chairman DEFAZIO 
so much for his great work, and we ap-
preciate him in Laredo, Texas. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
ROUZER). 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 2020. 
Our Nation’s inlets, waterways, har-
bors, ports, and beaches are critical 
components of our national infrastruc-
ture, supporting countless local econo-
mies all across the country. 
My 
district, 
which 
includes 
the 
southern portion of the North Carolina 
coast, relies on this biennial, bipar-
tisan bill to maintain and improve our 
resource projects. 
I would like to thank the Army Corps 
of Engineers for their work in support 
of the coastal storm damage reduction 
projects at Wrightsville Beach, as well 
as Carolina and Kure Beaches. Their 
team and mine work together con-
stantly to ensure that the right deci-
sions are made and executed. 
I want to especially thank the chair-
man and the ranking member for their 
work and commitment to keep this leg-
islation a good, bipartisan product of 
the committee. I particularly appre-
ciate their willingness to work with me 
to address the needs of our coastal 
communities and the infrastructure so 
important to North Carolina’s econ-
omy. I also want to thank the staff of 
the majority and minority for the 
many hours they have worked to make 
this day possible. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member GRAVES and Chair-
man DEFAZIO for their work and the 
committee staff for their work on this 
piece of legislation. 
Water is the lifeblood of Florida, and 
there is not a more important piece of 
legislation to our State or to our com-
munity, my community specifically, 
because of the work that this bill does. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act demands that the Army Corps of 
Engineers rewrite protocols that they 
have that allow them to poison my 
community, demands that they accel-
erate construction of the hugely impor-
tant EAA Reservoir, demands that 
they move more water into Florida’s 
Everglades where it is needed because 
they are dying because of lack of 
water. 
This piece of legislation is vital to 
our State. I would absolutely argue 
there is nothing more important to our 
State, and I couldn’t thank enough the 
chairman, the ranking member, and all 
the staff for all of their work on this 
very important piece of legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of WRDA 2020. 
This bill increases the authorized 
cost of the Cano Martin Pena Eco-
system 
Restoration 
Project, 
rep-
resenting the fully funded cost esti-
mate at fiscal year 2020 levels. This 
project was authorized in 2007, prior to 
completing the feasibility phase and 
without updated costs. That is the rea-
son it is so important for me. This 
change reflects the reality of costs and 
supports the project moving forward. 
This bill also authorizes flood risk 
management 
projects 
for 
Rio 
Culebrinas, Rio Guayanilla, and Rio 
Grande de Manati in the municipalities 
of Aguada, Aguadilla, Guayanilla, and 
Ciales. Authorization is a firm step in 
the right direction as we work with 
stakeholders to restore these rivers 
and improve flood protection and the 
health and economic opportunities of 
island residents. 
I would like to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
and their staff for working alongside 
my office to secure those provisions. 
I also want to thank them for includ-
ing the current mapping of all coasts 
that are experiencing rapid change. 
That means that Alaska, Hawaii, and 
many of the territories are going to be 
included in that provision. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of the bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this measure, 
which prioritizes six key projects for 
New York’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, a district almost completely sur-
rounded by water. 
On the east end of Long Island, we 
have a unique responsibility to safe-
guard our local waterways, from bol-
stering our local maritime infrastruc-
ture to managing future storm risks. 
Working with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and the Army Corps 
team at its New York district office, 
this bill prioritizes local projects that 
are vital to my congressional district. 
The Fire Island to Montauk Point 
project includes essential dredging and 
shoreline projects over 83 miles of 
coastline. Coastal storm risk manage-
ment 
for 
Hashamomuck 
Cove 
in 
Southold is included, where, right now, 
local residents, businesses, and first re-
sponders are paralyzed even during a 
severe thunderstorm. 
Additionally, this legislation author-
izes a feasibility study for a project at 
Wading River Creek in Riverhead and 
expedites 
feasibility 
studies 
for 
projects at Reel Point Preserve and 
Shelter Island, Goldsmith Inlet in 
Southold, and Lake Montauk Harbor in 
Montauk. 
Continuing to safeguard and invest in 
our maritime infrastructure will help 
preserve Long Island’s way of life for 
generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I thank the chair and ranking member 
for their leadership in making this a 
reality. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Water Resources De-
velopment Act, which is critical to dis-
tricts with significant shorelines, like 
mine. 
I am especially pleased to see the 
Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study 
included in this bill. High water levels 
on Lake Erie, and especially on Lake 
Ontario, are a major concern to com-
munities in our region. Homeowners 
and business owners along Lake On-
tario have suffered significant flooding 
and devastating property damage over 
the last few years. This study will in-
form those projects and policies that 
will mitigate high water levels and, 
hopefully, prevent future flooding of 
the kind suffered recently. 
I would also like to thank our leaders 
in the House, Ranking Member SAM 
GRAVES and Chairman PETER DEFAZIO, 
for the bipartisan work they have done 
on this legislation. The bipartisan 
work in the committee on WRDA is al-
ways welcome and a strong example of 
the way business can be conducted 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of S. 1811.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend, the ranking member. I didn’t re-
alize I was delaying his closing state-
ment. I am interested in hearing it, 
too. 
And then we are going to compare 
beards together after this; right? I am 
going to lose, I know, because he is the 
ranking member. That is what hap-
pens. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to say a 
heartfelt thank-you and congratula-
tions to Ranking Member GRAVES. This 
is a testament to his leadership for our 
side on this committee that we have 
come here to see such bipartisanship 
when it comes to the Water Resources 
Development Act. 
Madam Speaker, I do also want to 
thank Chairman DEFAZIO for his hard 
work. This is something that we have 
seen over my time in Congress. My 
first term, I was blessed enough to be 
appointed to the conference committee 
that got us on track for getting WRDA 
together on a biennial process. 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO
and 
Ranking 
Member GRAVES, these are the guys 
who helped lead the teams to put this 
successful effort together. 
And the chairman, I am sure, is prob-
ably surprised. I haven’t been one to 
stand up and talk about bipartisanship 
in this Congress as much as I would 
have liked, but today is that day to 
celebrate, and he needs to be com-
mended for his leadership, and I am ex-
cited that we see this success when it 
comes to WRDA. 
This legislation is important to my 
district because I represent the Illinois 
and Mississippi waterways, the naviga-
tion projects that make sure that glob-
al commerce gets from my district out 
into the global marketplace. 
Without proper policies governing 
the Corps of Engineers and projects 
that are so important to my district, 
we wouldn’t be able to be as successful, 
economically. This is the reason why I 
am so excited that we see this bipar-
tisan effort. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a hearty 
‘‘yes’’ vote and passage on this bill, and 
I thank every one of my colleagues who 
helped get us to this point. Madam 
Speaker, I certainly look forward to an 
overwhelming vote in the House today 
or later this week. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, let me 
note that WRDA 2020 will make Amer-
ica more competitive, grow jobs, foster 
a more robust economy, and, very im-
portantly, it is going to protect our 
communities for years to come. 
We passed a very similar bill by voice 
vote earlier this year, and this version 
reflects negotiations with the Senate 
that 
successfully 
maintained 
those 
strong principles and priorities from 
the House bill. 
Madam Speaker, I would just like to 
say, as well, that it has been a pleasure 
working with Chairman DEFAZIO and 
his staff in this process, and this is the 
way that the Committee on Transpor-
tation 
and 
Infrastructure 
usually 
works; and when it does work this way, 
we produce really good products. 
This is a good piece of legislation, 
and, hopefully, we will see much more 
of that in the future. I know I am com-
mitted to it, and I think it makes a big 
difference. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting this bipartisan 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as has been said and 
doesn’t need to be repeated, this is a 
fully bipartisan bill, and it does make 
essential investments in water infra-
structure that will impact virtually 
every State and territory of the United 
States of America. 
As a great maritime nation, we can’t 
afford not to make these investments; 
and hopefully it will be added, without 
change, to the omnibus year-end deal, 
or the Senate could perhaps take it up 
under unanimous consent since I don’t 
think anyone would object to it over 
there. One way or another, hopefully, 
it will get done. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to be 
more specific in thanking staff for this 
legislation. There was quite a lengthy 
negotiation. 
The Senate never individually passed 
the bill. We had to negotiate the whole 
bill with the Senate, and Ryan Seiger 
led the team—he did a great job— 
Camille Touton, Navis Bermudez, and 
Alexa Williams; and on the Republican 
side, Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, and Vic-
tor Sarmiento. 
Then the unseen heroes behind all 
the good work here in the House are 
those who work in the Office of Legis-
lative Counsel, and too often we over-
look how critical they are to writing 
good legislation. 
Sometimes I am amazed at the 
things that are introduced and that are 
gibberish, to put it mildly. Kakuti Lin 
and all her colleagues, thank you very 
much for your tremendous work on 
this, and it will be a great benefit to 
the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of S 1811, the Water 
Resources Development Act. I would like to 
thank Chairman DEFAZIO and my fellow col-
leagues on the House Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee, along with my col-
leagues in the Senate, for their diligent work to 
produce this much needed water resources 
bill. Everyone is the U.S. is impacted by the 
need for clean water and I believe this bill 
takes a giant step forward to ensuring this be-
comes a reality for every American. 
Within my district, The City of Dallas is ap-
preciative to the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers (Corps) for their funding of the Dallas 
Flood way, Dallas Flood way Extension flood 
risk management projects and Lewisville Dam 
repairs and their continued efforts to complete 
these projects quickly. I look forward to con-
tinuing to hear good reports on the progress of 
these projects. I am pleased that the Corp is 
moving forward with these projects. 
Please allow me to note that it is helpful for 
the Corps to accept input from non-federal 
sponsors in the development of WRDA guid-
ance. The Corps, working with local non-fed-
eral sponsors instead of developing guidance 
independently, will result in more resilient 
projects with multiple benefits. The role of re-
siliency in the construction, operation and 
maintenance of projects carried out by the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) must 
continue to be a priority. 
The Dallas area falls within the South-
western Division of the Army Corps of Engi-
neers. Flooding and flood control continue to 
be issues that are ever-present on the minds 
of residents along the Trinity River. I have 
held several meetings on flooding in the Dal-
las area to address this issue and hope to 
continue to work with the Corp to combat 
flooding in Dallas. 
Other parts of North Texas have also bene-
fited from projects included in previous 
versions of WRDA legislation. The projects ad-
dressing pump stations and levy heights in 
Dallas, along with bridge projects in Ft. Worth 
would not be where they are today without the 
Corps and this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, the Dallas-Fort Worth 
Metroplex is growing at a quite rapid pace and 
this updated legislation will help to provide 
adequate water and wastewater infrastructure 
to meet the demands, given the rapid pace of 
growth and development in our area. Further-
more, the bill will help in addressing mainte-
nance needs, replacing aging infrastructure, 
and help in accounting for human behavior in 
all aspects of our water system—from sewer 
overflows, to promoting water conservation 
through drought tolerant outdoor landscaping. 
Lastly, I want to thank the committee for 
working with me to include language in the bill 
regarding the embankment of Lake Waco, on 
which Lake Shore Drive is located, so that we 
may keep the public safe from danger. We 
were able to work with the Senate on lan-
guage that was direct and clear. It is very en-
couraging to know that we can continue to 
work in a bipartisan way to work with the com-
mittee to ensure that Lakeshore Drive is not a 
safety hazard. 
Madam Speaker, the projects I just men-
tioned are a tiny piece of the multitude of 
projects the Army Corps of Engineers works 
on to help address the water needs of the 
United States and its residents. Every Amer-
ican is impacted by this legislation and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of S. 1811, the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2020. Today’s 
vote is on the bipartisan, bicameral WRDA 
agreement by House and Senate Committee 
leaders. I want to particularly thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, Sub-
committee Ranking Member WESTERMAN and 
the Members of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee for their important work 
over the past 2 years on this bill. 
The Water Resources Development Act is 
our legislative commitment to investing in

Corps projects that help to protect our commu-
nities from flooding events, restore our envi-
ronment and ecosystems, and keep our na-
tion’s competitiveness by investing in our ports 
and harbors. 
The projects considered in this legislation 
are truly from Sea to Shining Sea—from the 
Unalaska (Dutch Harbor) Project in Alaska, to 
the Yuba River Ecosystem Restoration in Cali-
fornia, the Matagorda Ship Channel project in 
Texas, to the New York and New Jersey An-
chorages. 
Through biennial enactment of WRDA legis-
lation, the Congress has addressed local, re-
gional, and national needs through authoriza-
tion of new Corps projects, studies, and poli-
cies that benefit every corner of the nation. 
WRDA 2020 is no exception. 
I would particularly like to recognize Chair-
man DEFAZIO
for his continued efforts to 
unlock the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
and his partnership in ensuring that all ports 
receive the tools they need in the future. 
My region is home to the largest ports in the 
nation, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port 
of Long Beach. These ports handle over 40 
percent of the exports and imports into the 
United States. Los Angeles and Long Beach 
have invested billions of dollars of their own 
money to upgrade their infrastructure for the 
benefit of the entire nation. But the success of 
the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are 
only as strong as their partnership with the 
federal government. 
As part of this legislation, donor ports like 
the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will 
benefit from a greater share of the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund. Expanded in-water 
uses that are crucial to the navigation of the 
federal channel are now eligible. Seismic im-
pacts will also be considered as part of the 
benefit-cost ratio for navigation projects. 
I am also proud of the provisions in WRDA 
that look to study water supply as a primary 
purpose of the Corps. We in the West are in 
a continuous fight against drought, and we 
have remarkable Corps reservoirs that were 
built for flood control but can be used more ef-
fectively for local water supply. The Corps is 
adapting to these local needs in the West, and 
this bill will give the Corps more ability and 
focus on addressing long-term water reliability 
of arid communities. 
The bill also includes important assistance 
to socio-economically disadvantaged urban 
and rural areas by requiring the Corps to work 
more directly with local leaders and residents 
on Corps projects and provide positive im-
pacts to these communities. This will build 
long-term resiliency for economic develop-
ment, environmental and health improve-
ments, and clean and safe water resource 
projects. 
Lastly, this bill includes language necessary 
for my district and wildfire prone regions of the 
country to improve efforts by the Corps to re-
move unauthorized, human-made flammable 
equipment and materials from Corps property. 
This year there was an illegal fire on Corps 
property in my district that led to a major wild-
fire evacuating hundreds of residents and 
coming close to damaging property and harm-
ing our community. The language in this bill, 
in addition to efforts to increase Corps fund-
ing, will go a long way to helping the Corps re-
move these fire hazards. 
I would like to thank the many people who 
have helped this bill become a reality: Sub-
committee Vice Chair DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POW-
ELL, for her leadership on WRDA and espe-
cially all things Florida. 
Thank you to the leadership at the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, ASA James, Gen-
eral Spellmon, Retired General Semonite, Al 
Lee and the Senior Executive Service team, 
and Corps Counsel. I would especially like to 
thank 
Corps 
Futures 
Team—David 
Wethington, Laura Powell, and Andrea Busch, 
for their time and partnership in answering our 
questions to the nearly 1,100 submissions we 
received for WRDA 2020. 
I am very fortunate to have some of the 
best water and port leaders in the country in 
my district and Southern California who pro-
vided valuable input for this bill, including Col. 
Julie Balten, Col. Aaron Barta and David Van 
Dorpe of the Los Angeles District, Los Ange-
les County Supervisor Hilda Solis, Los Ange-
les County Public Works Director Mark 
Pestrella, Los Angeles City Mayor Eric 
Garcetti, Los Angeles Port Director Gene 
Seroka, Long Beach Port Director Mario 
Cordero, Metropolitan Water District Board 
Chair Gloria Grey, and San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster Tony Zampiello. 
Madam Speaker, I would particularly like to 
thank the Subcommittee Ranking Member 
BRUCE
WESTERMAN
for his friendship and 
collegiality through the hearings, meetings and 
roundtables which led to this bipartisan ac-
complishment. And most importantly, I would 
like to thank the incredible water sub-
committee staff, including Alexa Williams, 
Camille 
Touton, 
Navis 
Bermudez, 
Ryan 
Seiger, Victor Sarmiento, Jon Pawlow, and Ian 
Bennitt. 
I urge my colleagues to support WRDA 
2020. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the final ‘‘Water Resources 
Development Act of 2020’’ (S. 1811). Working 
with other members of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, I am very 
pleased to reach agreement with the Senate 
on a truly bipartisan bill and the fourth biennial 
Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) to 
be passed by Congress since 2014. 
My Congressional district includes 200 miles 
of the Sacramento River and is adjacent to 
several major ports. WRDA 2020 includes key 
provisions for the California Delta and Central 
Valley to authorize and expedite construction 
of flood protection and aquatic ecosystem res-
toration 
projects, 
address 
harmful 
algal 
blooms, and give local agencies greater flexi-
bility in using federal Army Corps funds to bet-
ter meet local needs. Under Chairman DEFA-
ZIO’s leadership, the bill finally fixes the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund to ensure that re-
gional dredging and navigation projects are 
fully funded. 
I secured Congressional authorization for 
the Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Res-
toration Project, Yuba River Ecosystem Res-
toration Project, and Sacramento Regional 
Groundwater Bank in WRDA 2020. These 
projects provide critical flood protection and 
make local communities across the Central 
Valley more resilient to climate change. 
I also secured deauthorization of the Sac-
ramento Riverbed Gradient Restoration Facil-
ity and Western Pacific Interceptor Canal, re-
turning these former Army Corps projects to 
full local control. 
WRDA 2020 also expedites completion of 
the Army Corps’ feasibility studies needed for 
the San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation 
Improvement Project, Lower Cache Creek 
Flood Risk Management Project, and Sutter 
Bypass and Sacramento River Basin Flood-
plain Management Project. I look forward to 
securing Congressional authorization for these 
projects once the Army Corps completes the 
requisite feasibility studies. 
Working with Rep. DORIS O. MATSUI (CA– 
06), I secured inclusion of our ‘‘Yolo Bypass 
System Improvement Act’’ in WRDA 2020 to 
improve coordinated planning for all restora-
tion projects and federal permitting in the Yolo 
Bypass. 
Lastly, I am very pleased that the new Army 
Corps harmful algal bloom program estab-
lished under WRDA 2020 includes the Cali-
fornia Delta as a focus area. This will better 
protect the Delta’s precious ecosystem from 
toxic algal blooms. 
The House report for WRDA 2020 includes 
my amendment directing the Army Corps to 
report to Congress on implementation of the 
Small Business Act across all the Corps’ mis-
sions. This strengthens Congressional over-
sight over the Corps’ contracting process and 
ensures that the Small Business Act is imple-
mented fully in an equitably distributed man-
ner, as intended by Congress. 
I want to extend a special appreciation to 
my colleague Rep. GRACE
F. NAPOLITANO 
(CA–32), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on 
Water Resources and Environment, for her 
tireless work in this WRDA for the entire Cali-
fornia delegation. WRDA 2020 ensures that 
Army Corps projects in California requiring 
earthquake-resistance and other seismic safe-
ty costs remain equally competitive for federal 
funding compared to projects in other states. 
I urge all Members of Congress to support 
this bipartisan WRDA 2020, which is expected 
to be signed into law this year. This two-year 
authorization bill provides the federal support 
and certainty needed to keep Army Corps 
projects across California on time and on 
budget. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 1811, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to provide for im-
provements to the rivers and harbors of 
the United States, to provide for the 
conservation and development of water 
and related resources, and for other 
purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
ROUTE 66 CENTENNIAL 
COMMISSION ACT 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 1014) to establish the Route 66 
Centennial Commission, and for other

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on S. 1014. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 1014. The bill establishes the Route 
66 Centennial Commission, with the 
charge of developing and planning a 
celebration for 2026 for the 100th anni-
versary of America’s ‘‘Mother Road.’’ 
Route 66 was established November 
11, 1926. It was a 2,448-mile-long high-
way that originally ran from Chicago, 
Illinois, to Los Angeles, California, and 
passed between numerous States in be-
tween. 
This historic route has been tra-
versed by Americans through the years 
for many reasons, from hundreds of 
thousands of migrants escaping the 
Dust Bowl in the 1930s to more recent 
road-trippers following in the footsteps 
of Jack Kerouac. 
A precursor to the interstate system, 
Route 66, was created out of the need 
for greater connectivity after the rise 
in automobile ownership. Disparate 
segments of roads and paths were 
woven into a cohesive highway that of-
fered unparalleled ease of mobility. 
While Route 66 became largely obso-
lete after the completion of the inter-
state system, it holds a unique place in 
our Nation’s surface transportation 
history. The story of Route 66 serves as 
an important reminder of why an inter-
connected transportation system is 
vital and why we must not devolve to a 
piecemeal approach to surface trans-
portation, as some have advocated—the 
first surface transportation advisor to 
President Trump most notably among 
them—saying we should go back to the 
good old days when this was done by 
all the States individually, even if the 
roads didn’t sometimes connect or 
meet national needs. 
For years, I carried around a poster 
of the interstate. It was a turnpike at 
the time between Kansas and Okla-
homa. Kansas built their section. 
It is an aerial photograph from Life 
magazine, and if you look down, you 
would say: Boy, that is really odd look-
ing. There is this big ribbon of con-
crete, four lanes, two on each side, and 
then there are all these kinds of angu-
lar black lines. 
Then you go: What is that? 
Well, that is the Oklahoma State 
line, and that is Amos Schweitzer’s 
farm field. 
Until we had the Eisenhower plan 
and until we had a national highway 
program, until we had a user fee, the 
State of Oklahoma said: We can’t af-
ford to do our section, even though we 
said we would do it. 
It was completed a number of years 
later with a Federal share from the Ei-
senhower plan. 
This kind of connectivity is critical. 
I have had some environmentalists say: 
Why do you want to rebuild the high-
way system with climate change? 
Well, we are going to rebuild it in a 
resilient way. We are going to build it 
with new materials and more climate 
friendly, and we are going to electrify 
it. 
We cannot possibly move the amount 
of freight necessary in this country to 
feed the American people and serve 
myriad other needs with our rail sys-
tem. It just could not meet that task. 
We have to rebuild the 47,000 bridges 
that are in need of replacement or sig-
nificant structural repair. We have to 
repair the sections of 40 percent of the 
national highway systems that are de-
teriorated to the point where you have 
to rebuild it, not just resurface it. And 
we have to invest in the $100 billion 
backlog in our transit systems. 
Hopefully, under President Biden, we 
will have no more fake Infrastructure 
Weeks, and we will move forward with 
an actual, real Infrastructure Week 
with investment and spending. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is a re-
minder of the past and the need for 
interconnection to serve the American 
people, which we are going to need 
again in the future. 
I support S. 1014 and urge my col-
leagues to join me in passing this legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
for allowing this bill to come to the 
floor today. 
I also want to give a heartfelt thanks 
to my colleague from the great State 
of 
California, 
GRACE
NAPOLITANO. 
GRACE and I cosponsored together H.R. 
66, which is the House companion bill 
to this legislation. 
I also want to thank, since we are 
taking up the Senate bill, the Senate 
version of this bill, I really want to 
thank my colleague from my home 
State 
of 
Illinois, 
Senator 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH, for her work in making 
sure that this bicameral, bipartisan 
compromise comes to the floor today. 
I am proud to have Route 66 run 
through the middle of my district, and 
I do believe that it is important to cel-
ebrate its history. 
In 1926, Route 66 became the Nation’s 
first all-paved highway under the U.S. 
Highway System. As Chairman DEFA-
ZIO stated earlier, it connects Chicago, 
Illinois, to Santa Monica, California. 
Early on, the road was used by thou-
sands of Americans seeking escape 
from the Dust Bowl, and it provided 
critical employment opportunities for 
road crews paving the road during the 
Great Depression. 
During World War II, the highway 
transported troops, equipment, and 
supplies to military bases across our 
country and was used after the war by 
thousands of troops who were gladly 
returning home to see their families. 
By the 1950s, Route 66 began to see a 
rise in tourism and really became the 
true symbol of American freedom and 
independence that we all know today. 
In April of 2017, I went on an ex-
tended tour of Illinois’ stretch of the 
highway with my colleague and good 
friend, Congressman DARIN
LAHOOD, 
and also my good friend and former dis-
trict director, who is now a State legis-
lator, Representative Tim Butler, and 
other local leaders. We had the oppor-
tunity to see the impact that the 
‘‘Mother Road’’ brings to our home 
State of Illinois. 
b 1445 
It supports many jobs, key economic 
activity in small towns, and it helps 
generate the important local sales tax 
revenue to our communities that line 
Route 66. 
If you want to come to that stretch 
of Illinois, travelers along Route 66 can 
see a giant pink elephant. That is 
right, Madam Speaker, a giant pink 
elephant right outside the Pink Ele-
phant Antique Mall in Livingston, Illi-
nois, right at the southwestern part of 
the 13th District of Illinois. 
They can go see a movie at the 
Wildey Theater in Edwardsville, Illi-
nois, in my district that originally 
opened in 1909. 
They can stop for an all-day break-
fast at Jungle Jim’s Cafe, a quintessen-
tial roadside diner in Springfield. They 
have great pancakes, too. Don’t eat too 
many of them. The omelets are great. 
It is a wonderful place to stop. 
These are just a few of the thousands 
of local businesses along Route 66 
whose livelihood depends on the his-
toric highway. You don’t even have to 
be in a car to ride along Route 66. The 
Illinois Route 66 Trail is a system of 
off-road paths for bikes, hikers, or any-
one else looking to see the Mother 
Road in a different way. 
The centennial of Route 66 will be an 
international 
celebration, 
and 
the 
State of Illinois will be ready to wel-
come travelers from around the world 
who want to experience the history and 
magic of this scenic byway.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6987 
December 8, 2020 
For this reason, one of the important 
aspects of this bill is its creation of a 
commission to recommend activities to 
honor the 100th anniversary of Route 66 
in the year 2026. 
Additionally, the bill directs the U.S. 
Department of Transportation to work 
with certain governors to develop a 
plan to preserve the first all-paved U.S. 
highway connecting the Midwest to the 
West Coast in California. It is impor-
tant to retain the legacy of this great 
road. 
Throughout its history, Route 66 has 
been more than just a way to get from 
point A to point B. It has evolved in a 
symbol of American independence and 
prosperity. 
I am proud to help continue the leg-
acy of Route 66. H.R. 66 passed the 
House last year by a voice vote, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S. 
1014. 
I don’t believe that I have anybody 
else here to speak on this bill, unless I 
surprise any of my colleagues by yield-
ing them time. So, Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, al-
though I do want to visit the Pink Ele-
phant Antique Mall, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 1014. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
ORRIN G. HATCH UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 4902) to designate the United 
States courthouse located at 351 South 
West Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
as the ‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United States 
Courthouse’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 4902 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. ORRIN G. HATCH UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The United States court-
house located at 351 South West Temple in 
Salt Lake City, Utah, shall be known and 
designated as the ‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United 
States Courthouse’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the United 
States courthouse referred to in subsection 
(a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United States Courthouse’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. KATKO) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 4902. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 4902, a bill introduced by Senator 
LEE
to designate the United States 
Courthouse located at 351 South West 
Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the 
Orrin G. Hatch United States Court-
house. 
Orrin Hatch was born and raised in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He received 
his law degree from the University of 
Pittsburgh and worked as an attorney 
in Pittsburgh until he moved to Utah 
in 1969, where he continued to practice 
law. 
In 1976, he was elected to the United 
States Senate for his first run for pub-
lic office. Senator Hatch is the longest- 
serving Republican U.S. Senator in his-
tory and the longest-serving U.S. Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Senator Hatch is one of the only Sen-
ators to have served as chairman of 
three Senate committees: Health, Edu-
cation, Labor and Pensions from 1981 
to 1987; the Judiciary Committee from 
1995 to 2001 and from 2003 to 2005; and 
the Finance Committee from 2015 to 
2019. In total, Senator Hatch spent 32 of 
his 42 years in the Senate as either 
chairman or ranking member of a 
major committee. 
In 2015, Senator Hatch was sworn in 
as President pro tempore of the Senate, 
a position he held until his retirement 
in 2019. 
Senator Hatch credits his family as 
the key to his success. He and his wife, 
Elaine, have been married for over 60 
years. They are the proud parents of 6 
children and 23 grandchildren. 
I support this legislation honoring 
the accomplishments and service of 
Senator Hatch and I would ask my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
S. 4902 would designate the U.S. 
courthouse in Salt Lake City, Utah, as 
the Orrin G. Hatch United States 
Courthouse. 
Senator Hatch served the citizens of 
Utah and our Nation for many years. 
First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, 
Senator Hatch served in the other body 
for 42 years during seven different 
Presidential administrations. 
Prior to his retirement, Senator 
Hatch served as President pro tempore 
and was third in line for Presidential 
succession from 2015 to 2019. 
Senator Hatch has a longstanding 
record of bipartisanship, having co-
sponsored or sponsored more than 750 
bills that became law. 
His leadership as chairman of three 
major Senate committees helped pave 
the way for critical financial, judicial, 
and health legislation. 
I think it is fitting to honor the dedi-
cation and service of Senator Hatch by 
naming this courthouse after him. I 
say that as a Federal prosecutor of 20 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS). 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of S. 4902, which 
is legislation renaming Utah’s Federal 
courthouse in honor of Senator Orrin 
G. Hatch. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
met 
Senator 
Hatch 
many 
years 
ago 
and 
have 
worked with him since my time in the 
Utah State Senate and subsequently as 
the mayor of Salt Lake County. I have 
always admired the service he provided 
for his constituents and colleagues in 
the Senate alike. 
Senator Hatch’s accomplishments on 
behalf of Utah and our country are a 
remarkable reminder of the bipartisan-
ship we need to return to. 
Senator Hatch worked with his long-
time friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, to 
pass the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program, or CHIP. He also worked 
across the aisle to pass the Radiation 
Exposure Compensation Act, which 
compensated Utahans who suffered ra-
diation exposure because of their prox-
imity to the Nevada Nuclear Test Site. 
Madam Speaker, Senator Hatch has 
been an exemplary public figure. For 
over 40 years, Senator Hatch showed 
what it is like to work with folks from 
all walks of life and all ends of the po-
litical spectrum. He respected a dif-
ference of opinion. He welcomed a 
healthy debate, and he knew that at 
the end of the day we are all trying to 
make our State and our country a bet-
ter place. 
Senator Hatch cared deeply about 
the rule of law and the integrity of the 
courts. Putting his name on the Fed-
eral courthouse in Utah is a well-de-
served and hard-earned honor marking 
his many contributions to the judici-
ary, to his State, and to our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. STEWART). 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of this bill to re-
name the new Federal courthouse in 
Utah after my good friend, Senator 
Orrin G. Hatch. He is my friend. He 
was, in many ways, my mentor. He has 
been a friend of my family. 
At the risk of repeating some infor-
mation that has already been said, I 
think it is worth just highlighting 
some of his really incredible and nota-
ble achievements.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6988 
December 8, 2020 
In the first place, just serving his Na-
tion for 42 years in the U.S. Senate; 
again, the longest-serving Republican 
Senator in all of U.S. history. He rose 
to the position of President pro tem-
pore, serving under seven Presidents 
and nine Senate majority leaders. 
I love this fact; it is remarkable: He 
has passed more legislation than any 
other Senator who is alive today, more 
than 750 bills, which I think reflects on 
not only his long career, but on his 
ability to work with others because he 
could not have done that by himself. 
He could not have done that just with 
his own party. He had to do that in a 
bicameral and a bipartisan fashion, and 
he certainly did, and he is known for 
that. 
Again, the numerous leadership posi-
tions, chairman of three major com-
mittees, which have already been men-
tioned here. 
I think it is fair, as well, and appro-
priate that we mention not only him, 
but his wife, Elaine. As good as Orrin 
is, Elaine is every bit as good and in 
some cases better. And their 6 children 
and 23 grandchildren, the result of 60 
years of marriage. 
Of final note, Senator Hatch was par-
ticularly active and impactful in the 
judiciary. I think that every sitting 
U.S. District Court Judge in Utah, in-
cluding, by the way, my brother, owes, 
to some degree, their position because 
of the support of Senator Hatch. He 
had an unparalleled career. He had an 
unparalleled impact on the judiciary, 
and it is perfectly appropriate that we 
name the new courthouse in Salt Lake 
City 
after 
this 
distinguished 
gen-
tleman, and I absolutely support and 
endorse this effort. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
In closing, Senator Hatch was one of 
the longest-serving members of the 
U.S. Senate, often working on a bipar-
tisan basis to get the work of the 
American people done. 
This bill will honor and recognize his 
dedication and decades of service to 
this great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 4902. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE 
ACCESS ACT OF 2019 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 578) to amend title 
II of the Social Security Act to elimi-
nate the five-month waiting period for 
disability 
insurance 
benefits 
under 
such 
title 
for 
individuals 
with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 578 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF WAITING PERIOD FOR 
SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY IN-
SURANCE BENEFITS FOR DISABLED 
INDIVIDUALS WITH AMYOTROPHIC 
LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS). 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 223(a)(1) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 423(a)(1)) is 
amended in the matter following subpara-
graph (E) by striking ‘‘or (ii)’’ and inserting 
‘‘(ii) in the case of an individual who has 
been 
medically 
determined 
to 
have 
amyotrophic 
lateral 
sclerosis, 
for 
each 
month beginning with the first month during 
all of which the individual is under a dis-
ability and in which the individual becomes 
entitled to such insurance benefits, or (iii)’’. 
(b) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by this section shall apply with respect 
to applications for disability insurance bene-
fits filed after the date of the enactment of 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. REED) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Connecticut. 
b 1500 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume. 
ALS is a devastating and cruel dis-
ease. There is no cure for ALS, and 
ALS always leads to a premature 
death. On average, people live only 2 to 
5 years after getting a diagnosis of 
ALS. 
Earlier this year, I lost my dear 
friend and former Chief of Staff, Elliot 
Ginsberg to ALS, and previously lost a 
near and dear friend, Danny Jones, who 
I went to grammar school with and 
played basketball with, who later led 
Central Connecticut in his collegiate 
years. 
Every 
year, 
approximately 
5,000 
Americans are diagnosed with ALS. 
Over time, people with ALS lose 
their ability to speak, to eat, to move, 
and even to breathe. They are unable 
to work due to their severe disabilities, 
and they lose their jobs and their em-
ployer-based health insurance. I have 
witnessed this happen to both them 
and, as importantly, their family mem-
bers, and to see the agony and the suf-
fering and yet the dedication and love 
that they go through. 
Recognizing the devastating nature 
of ALS, in 2000, Congress passed bipar-
tisan legislation that waived the 24- 
month waiting period for Medicare for 
people with ALS. 
Today, we consider the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act of 2019. 
This bipartisan legislation will end the 
5-month waiting period for Social Se-
curity Disability Insurance benefits for 
people with ALS. 
Madam Speaker, I want to give spe-
cial thanks to Representative SETH 
MOULTON, who has been a champion on 
this issue, along with the 305 Members 
of the House of Representatives who 
have 
cosponsored 
Representative 
MOULTON’s bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act of 2019. 
Our actions today will provide people 
with ALS quicker access to the Social 
Security and Medicare benefits they 
have earned. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
commend my colleague on the House 
Ways and Means Committee, BILL PAS-
CRELL, for his passionate leadership 
and untiring advocacy on behalf of 
those suffering with Huntington’s dis-
ease, a terrible disease which affects 
children as well as adults. 
Today, we are passing this bill for 
many with ALS, but we also know 
there are many devastating diseases, 
such as Huntington’s and metastatic 
breast cancer, which also deserve the 
same benefits and to have bills in Con-
gress that will provide just that. 
We need a solution for everyone. 
People with the kinds of severe dis-
ease and disabilities that qualify them 
for Social Security really need the ben-
efits they have earned as soon as pos-
sible. I hope that in the next Congress 
we can try to help everyone, by doing 
what BERNIE SANDERS and LLOYD DOG-
GETT
and others have proposed, to 
eliminate these waiting periods across 
the board. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 578, the ALS Disability Insurance 
Access Act of 2019. 
As my colleague, Mr. LARSON, has in-
dicated, this legislation will provide 
immediate access to disability insur-
ance benefits for individuals suffering 
from ALS, otherwise known as Lou 
Gehrig’s disease, by eliminating the 5- 
month waiting period for disability in-
surance benefits. 
Madam Speaker, it is only fair that 
we remove this waiting period to en-
sure everyone with this disease will 
have immediate access to the benefits 
they have earned. 
It is only fair, also, that we help 
great Americans like a family in our

district, the Palmesano family, Mike 
and Suzy, who are close, personal 
friends of mine, who I have gotten to 
know over the years when their son 
Mick was recently diagnosed with 
rapid progression ALS. 
The 
Palmesano 
family 
has 
been 
strong advocates for this cause, and I 
couldn’t be prouder of their efforts. 
Their bravery in the face of adversity 
represents hundreds of families in our 
district and thousands of families 
across the country struggling with this 
terrible disease day in and day out. 
The disability insurance waiting pe-
riod was designed to make sure a con-
dition wasn’t temporary before benefits 
were paid, not to prevent great Ameri-
cans, like Mick and his family and oth-
ers, from receiving disability benefits. 
The data, Madam Speaker, is clear. 
On average, ALS patients live 3 to 5 
years. Once ALS starts, it almost al-
ways 
progresses, 
eventually 
taking 
away the ability to walk, dress, write, 
speak, swallow, and breathe. 
Given the severity of ALS and that 
there is no current cure, people diag-
nosed with this disease know this is 
not a temporary condition. That is why 
ALS is one of two conditions that has 
an exemption to the 24-month waiting 
period for Medicare. 
Again, that same logic should apply 
to waiving the waiting period for dis-
ability insurance. 
This legislation is supported by the 
ALS Association, I AM ALS, Les Tur-
ner ALS Foundation, Muscular Dys-
trophy Association, Team Gleason, and 
the bipartisan House Problem Solvers 
Caucus. 
I look forward to voting for this leg-
islation, because we must stand to-
gether and care for those struggling 
with ALS and also their families as 
they battle this debilitating disease. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to join us in supporting 
this great piece of legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON), the distinguished gentleman 
who has championed this bill. 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. LARSON), my friend, for yielding. 
In 2014, Pete Frates told ESPN: ‘‘At 
the end of the day, I want to be the cli-
che game-changer. I want to be the guy 
who shifts everyone’s thinking and 
shifts where the funds are going. Self-
ishly, I want to give myself a chance, 
but also give a lot of other people op-
portunities as well.’’ 
Today, we consider ourselves incred-
ibly lucky because we got to know Pete 
Frates. 
Pete, you accomplished this mission 
long ago, but today’s vote is further 
proof that you will live forever. We are 
here because you were brave enough to 
stand up and show the world your 
strength. We are here because of your 
family, who continued the fight: Julie, 
Lucy, John, Nancy, Jennifer, and An-
drew, and the Frate-train. I am so 
proud of all of you. 
We are here because of the hard work 
of the ALS Association, I AM ALS, and 
because thousands of ALS patients and 
their families and caregivers followed 
your lead. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to pass the ALS Disability Insurance 
Access Act, and let’s keep fighting 
until we have a cure for this dev-
astating disease. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), our great whip, to 
express his thoughts on this important 
bill. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. REED) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
my friend, the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON), for leading on 
this important piece of legislation as 
well. 
I rise in strong support, Madam 
Speaker, of the ALS Disability Insur-
ance Access Act. 
We have worked closely on so many 
issues with the ALS community, and 
this is another great example of that. I 
know as I was talking with the major-
ity leader last week during our col-
loquy, Mr. HOYER, we worked on get-
ting this bill scheduled. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the major-
ity leader for bringing this bill to the 
floor, because at a time when you hear 
about Congress’ disagreements—which, 
unfortunately, there are a number of 
areas where we do disagree—this is one 
area where we have come together; and 
not just today, on this issue regarding 
the timeline that you have to wait for 
ALS patients to be eligible for SSDI, a 
timeline that we will now eliminate, 
properly so, but we have been here be-
fore and Congress has come together on 
other areas. 
The Steve Gleason Act is one of those 
great examples, where speech-gener-
ating devices were being denied to peo-
ple with ALS. It was a ruling that had 
come out of Medicare that we had all 
disagreed with, but it took an act of 
Congress to fix that. 
Congress did come together to do 
that, just as Congress is coming to-
gether today to right this wrong and to 
stand up for those ALS patients who 
just want to live life to the fullest. 
Steve Gleason is one of those exam-
ples. He is a constituent of mine and 
has become a dear friend, and some-
body who really does live life to the 
fullest and doesn’t let a disability de-
fine him. 
He actually has gone out and become 
a pioneer and inspired so many others 
to just go out and live their life and 
let’s get government impediments out 
of the way. 
That is what we are doing here today. 
We are coming together as Republicans 
and Democrats to stand up for those 
people with ALS who just want that 
opportunity to live their life to the 
fullest. 
I want to reiterate that great motto 
that Steve Gleason lives by: No white 
flags. It means you never surrender; 
you just go out there every day and do 
the best you can. 
Today, we are going to help thou-
sands of people across this country do 
exactly that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), a distinguished gentleman who 
has been a lifelong fighter on behalf of 
people with disabilities. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. LARSON) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of S. 578, the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act, which en-
sures that individuals who are diag-
nosed with ALS are not forced to wait 
to receive the Social Security Dis-
ability benefits that they have earned 
and they so desperately need. 
The onset of a disability can be a dif-
ficult, 
challenging, 
and 
often 
dis-
orienting time. However, by elimi-
nating the 5-month waiting period for 
ALS patients to receive disability ben-
efits, we can help families facing this 
difficult diagnosis focus on their health 
and well-being instead of worrying 
about how to keep a roof over their 
head or put food on the table. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud my good 
friend and colleague, Senator SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE, for championing this bi-
partisan effort in the Senate. He has 
been a strong voice for the ALS com-
munity as co-chair of the Senate ALS 
Caucus, and I have been proud to work 
with him on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I also recognize our 
colleague here, Representative SETH 
MOULTON, for his leadership as well. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to rec-
ognize one of my constituents, Christa 
Thompson, who has been a dedicated 
crusader for the ALS community. 
Christa knows the struggle all too well, 
as she has watched her husband, Olin, 
battle this devastating disease. 
Christa, a proud mother of three 
boys, made it her mission to engage 
with me and my delegation colleagues 
early on, and it is in large part due to 
her efforts and the efforts of ALS advo-
cates everywhere, including my good 
friend, J.R. Pagliarini, who has been 
such a champion of ALS back in Rhode 
Island, that we will be able to provide 
some important relief to families. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important 
measure. 
Let’s make a difference for these 
families and those diagnosed with ALS. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS).

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6990 
December 8, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of S. 578, the ALS Disability In-
surance Access Act. 
ALS is a rare, fatal, progressive, 
neurodegenerative disease with an abil-
ity to strike anyone at any time 
throughout the world. 
It has no racial, ethnic, or socio-
economic boundaries. Still, we actually 
have no cause or cure, and it is very 
sad, but we have to work on a cure. We 
will never give up, Madam Speaker. 
While military veterans are 11⁄2 to 2 
times more likely to develop ALS than 
those who have not served, and 5 to 10 
percent of cases are familial and due to 
a gene mutation, 90 percent are consid-
ered sporadic with no clear reason for 
development. 
Rapidly progressing throughout the 
body, time is critical for ALS patients 
as many suffer total paralysis and 
death, typically within 2 to 5 years fol-
lowing diagnosis, although I do know 
some friends who have lived much 
longer than that. They continue to 
contribute to society and to their re-
spective wonderful communities. 
Again, during that time, many lose 
their ability to work and lose access to 
employer-based insurance. Despite con-
tributing to Social Security during 
their working years, ALS patients 
must wait 5 months before they can re-
ceive access to the benefits they have 
earned. These disability benefits help 
pay for costly medical care, food, and 
housing. 
ALS patients cannot afford to wait 
for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn. 
They need our immediate support in 
the face of this cruel disease. As the co- 
chair of the Rare Disease Caucus, I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
critical bill for ALS patients. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY 
CHU), a gracious and distinguished lady 
on the Ways and Means Committee. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, 
which would help those diagnosed with 
ALS get their benefits quickly by mak-
ing them eligible to receive Social Se-
curity 
Disability 
Insurance 
imme-
diately instead of having to wait 5 
months. 
I have heard heart-wrenching stories 
from my constituents whose lives have 
been upended by this cruel and aggres-
sive disease. ALS is a progressive 
neurodegenerative 
disease 
over 
the 
course of which those with ALS lose 
the ability to initiate and control mus-
cle movement. This leads to paralysis 
and, ultimately, death. 
Tragically, ALS has a fatality rate of 
100 percent. Unfortunately, this disease 
is so aggressive and can take so long to 
diagnose that some patients lose their 
battle with ALS before the 5-month 
waiting period for SSDI benefits is 
over. This bill would ensure that those 
who have an ALS diagnosis are not de-
nied their benefits when they need 
them most. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of the 
House version of this legislation, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill 
before us today. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KING), the dean of the New 
York delegation who has had a long 
history of support for causes such as 
this. 
Mr. KING of New York. Madam 
Speaker, let me thank my colleague 
from New York for yielding. Let me 
also commend Mr. LARSON
and Mr. 
MOULTON for their leadership efforts on 
this, and, of course, Mr. BILIRAKIS. 
It is really a great honor to be sup-
porting this legislation. I have known, 
unfortunately, too many people who 
suffer from ALS. 
It is 100 percent fatal. That is the re-
ality of it. 
All of us who meet advocates every 
year coming in to lobby us, or to urge 
us to support more research funding for 
ALS, we realize very quickly they may 
be there 1 year and 2 years, and then 
we never see them again because they 
have 
died. 
It 
is 
a 
brutal 
neurodegenerative neuromuscular dis-
ease, and this 5-month limit that was 
put on them before they can obtain dis-
ability benefits was so unfair. 
During that 5 months, the disease 
can progress so rapidly. The medical 
costs go up. The psychological costs 
are there. By passing this legislation 
today, we are going to provide not just 
financial relief but also psychological 
and emotional care and relief for their 
families and friends. 
In New York, we always refer to this 
as Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famed 
Yankee slugger, and I am saying that 
as a Mets fan. Lou Gehrig is a hero in 
New York. Unfortunately, as great as 
his baseball record is, he is known 
most for the disease that ended both 
his career and his life. 
Let me just say also, this will be my 
final appearance on the House floor 
speaking, the last time I speak on the 
House floor. I want to say what a great 
honor it has been to serve for these 
past 28 years with all of the Members. 
It has been a great privilege for me. 
One of the real privileges is being able 
to support legislation such as this, 
which is so needed and so necessary. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, at this time, it is my privi-
lege to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY
K. 
DAVIS), who I say is the voice of God. 
When you hear him speak, I think you 
will agree with me. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
As a cosponsor of the ALS Disability 
Insurance Access Act, I rise in strong 
support of this bill that removes the 
harmful 5-month waiting period for 
earned Social Security Disability In-
surance benefits. 
For years, representatives from the 
greater Chicago chapter of The ALS 
Association have raised the financial 
hardship caused by this waiting period. 
Disability insurance is an earned ben-
efit. Federal law should ease suffering 
and promote the well-being of persons 
eligible for SSDI. 
This bill will help alleviate the finan-
cial burden of persons and families 
struggling with ALS, making it a little 
easier as they battle the tremendous 
loss associated with this illness. 
Enacting this bill is an important 
step forward to removing barriers to 
disability benefits. I look forward to 
advancing additional bills to eliminate 
obstacles to disability benefits, includ-
ing advocating for the elimination of 
the waiting period for financial and 
Medicare assistance for all SSDI-eligi-
ble individuals. 
Again, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, at this 
time, I have no other speakers seeking 
time, so I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), 
considered the greatest hockey player 
in the Congress. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
sure not everyone on the other side 
would agree with that, or on this side 
either. 
I rise today in strong support of this 
bill, and I want to thank Chairman 
NEAL and Members MOULTON and KING 
for a bill that will surely bring hope 
and dignity to ALS patients and care-
givers. 
The 5-month waiting period is simply 
unacceptable for a disease like ALS, 
and I am glad that Congress is finally 
righting this wrong. 
Over the past 2 years, it has been an 
honor for me to partner with the ALS 
community. For too long, ALS has 
flown under the radar. It has gone un-
derfunded, underresearched, and unno-
ticed. But that is rapidly changing, 
thanks to the efforts of patient advo-
cates fighting for their own lives and 
the lives of those not yet diagnosed. 
I would like to give a special shout- 
out to my friends and Chicagoans, 
Brian Wallach and Sandra Abrevaya, 
the husband and wife cofounders of I 
AM ALS, and to Dan Tate, Jr. They are 
tireless, 
selfless 
patient 
advocates. 
Without them, we simply wouldn’t be 
here today. 
I want to thank you all for bringing 
this bill to the floor. I am proud to be 
an original cosponsor and welcome its 
bipartisan support. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act of 2019, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this important bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6991 
December 8, 2020 
I want to acknowledge the extraor-
dinary 
leadership 
of 
Congressman 
MOULTON, who has led this effort in the 
House, 
and 
my 
Senator, 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, in the Senate, and all the 
cosponsors. 
As we all know, ALS is a terribly de-
bilitating disease. For those of us who 
have friends or family members who 
have been diagnosed with this, we 
know what a family endures when the 
diagnosis is made, and they are over-
wrought with how they are going to 
manage this very serious health chal-
lenge. Imagine, in addition to all of 
that, if people have to worry about 
whether or not they have access to 
care in those critical first months of 
this disease. 
So, I applaud everyone who has co-
sponsored this bill. Patients and fami-
lies will benefit enormously from this 
legislation. They will have one less 
thing to worry about when they are 
confronting this very serious diagnosis. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I thank the gentleman 
again for yielding. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I have great gratitude for my 
distinguished colleague from New York 
(Mr. REED), and I thank SETH MOULTON 
for his outstanding work on this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 
578, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, as we 
close this debate, I applaud my col-
league from Connecticut who is a true, 
good friend, Mr. LARSON, and I mean 
that from the bottom of my heart. 
I am just proud to stand in full sup-
port of this commonsense legislation 
that will make a difference, Madam 
Speaker, in the lives of so many Ameri-
cans suffering from ALS. I know it will 
make a difference for Mick Palmesano. 
I know it will help alleviate and bring 
some comfort to the entire Palmesano 
family in our home district of New 
York. 
But most importantly, I know we 
demonstrated to the folks in America 
that Congress can work, that Demo-
crats and Republicans can come to-
gether on an important issue like this 
and pass important legislation that 
will improve the lives of Americans. 
Last week, the Senate overwhelm-
ingly passed this legislation, Madam 
Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to 
join us in support of this fine legisla-
tion so we can get it to the President’s 
desk for signature without delay. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I join 
today in support of the ALS Disability Insur-
ance Access Act to ensure that individuals di-
agnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) receive the financial support they need 
and for which they have already qualified. I 
congratulate Congressman MOULTON and Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE on their successful leader-
ship for this important effort of which I have 
been a cosponsor. 
For individuals who are determined to have 
a sufficiently severe disability to quality for So-
cial Security Disability Insurance, the security 
that Social Security is intended to provide can 
come with a cost—two years without health in-
surance. This waiting period—which should 
really be called a suffering period—must be 
eliminated. Two unjustified delays prolong the 
suffering. The first, a five-month delay to re-
ceive any disability payment even though the 
recipient has already qualified. The second, is 
a two-year delay to access Medicare coverage 
for which they already qualified. 
This means that the millions of individuals 
with disabilities in this waiting period may not 
be able to access necessary medical treat-
ments and medications. This only makes ex-
isting health complications worse and in-
creases overall health care spending. Many 
die waiting their turn for health coverage. In 
2018 alone, about 16,000 workers with disabil-
ities died during the 5-month waiting period 
and about 56,000 workers with disabilities died 
waiting for Medicare coverage. 
These waiting periods only serve to harm 
the health of individuals with disabilities and 
delay the support they need. In addition to this 
bill for individuals with ALS, other colleagues 
have offered legislation to end the waiting pe-
riods for individuals with metastatic breast 
cancer, Huntington’s Disease, and other life- 
threatening illnesses. I support all of these ef-
forts. We must provide a healthy foundation 
for all individuals with disabilities, who already 
arc experiencing unique health challenges. 
I hope that this ALS bill represents a step 
forward in the eventual approval of the bipar-
tisan Stop the Wait bill, H.R. 4386, that I intro-
duced to eliminate the onerous waiting periods 
for Social Security Disability Insurance and 
Medicare. This bill now has 50 House cospon-
sors. and Senator BOB CASEY has introduced 
companion legislation. Having recognized the 
suffering of these waiting periods for Ameri-
cans with ALS, I urge Congress to consider 
the suffering of all those subject to waiting pe-
riods and pass long-overdue reforms to Stop 
the Wait. We must ensure individuals with dis-
abilities have access to health care when they 
need it. Social Security cannot truly provide 
health care security, until all individuals with 
disabilities have guaranteed access to prompt 
Medicare coverage. Let’s Stop the Wait for all 
of them. 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
in support of the ALS Disability Insurance Ac-
cess Act. This important bill eliminates the 
mandatory five-month waiting period for pa-
tients with ALS seeking to access the Social 
Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits 
they earned. 
The waiting period creates an undue finan-
cial burden when ALS patients are already 
facing enormous financial stress. But while we 
act today to alleviate the hardship created by 
this waiting period for ALS patients, Congress 
must extend similar relief to other beneficiaries 
who are equally deserving. 
What sense does it make to have require 
SSDI beneficiaries to endure a five-month 
waiting period after they have been deter-
mined eligible for their earned SSDI benefits? 
This requirement creates an unnecessary 
delay for some of our nation’s most vulner-
able. 
We must ensure that all individuals who 
qualify for SSDI can access the benefits for 
which they have already qualified without 
undue delay. I urge my colleagues to not only 
support the ALS Disability Insurance Access 
Act, but to end the waiting period for all SSDI 
beneficiaries. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
LARSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 578. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) and the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include any extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1375, the Pro-
vide Accurate Information Directly 
Act of 2019, as amended, or the PAID 
Act, improves financial accountability 
by strengthening reporting regarding 
Medicare Advantage enrollees between 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, CMS, and liability and other 
nongroup health plans. 
Similar measures are already in 
place for traditional Medicare. With 
one in three Medicare beneficiaries en-
rolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, it 
is time that we enact this measure to 
bring parity for the program. At its 
core, this is a good governance pro-
gram, which will improve integrity 
overall, and that is always welcome. 
I would like to especially thank our 
fellow Ways and Means Committee 
member RON
KIND, who has worked 
tirelessly at this to make sure that we 
corrected this anomaly in the legisla-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

that fall within your Committee’s Rule X ju-
risdiction. I will also support the appoint-
ment of Committee on Energy and Com-
merce conferees during any House-Senate 
conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is 
included in the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate 
your cooperation regarding this legislation 
and look forward to continuing to work with 
you as this measure moves through the legis-
lative process. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman. 
b 1530 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this legislation. 
Right now, Medicare Advantage is an 
extremely popular program for seniors 
in the country, with a 99 percent satis-
faction rate. Many in Kansas and 
across the United States rely on this 
program 
for 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare. 
It is critical that we work together 
to find solutions to strengthen and im-
prove Medicare Advantage. The Pro-
vide Accurate Information Directly 
Act, or the PAID Act, does exactly 
that. 
At a time when partisan bickering 
seems to be louder than the needs of 
Americans here in Washington, this bi-
partisan 
solution 
will 
improve 
healthcare processes for thousands of 
seniors. The PAID Act ensures that the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, or CMS, is properly reim-
bursed for Medicare Advantage and 
Medicare part D costs that are covered 
by another settling party. 
To better understand how this bill 
works for Medicare Advantage and its 
beneficiaries, let me offer you this sce-
nario: 
A 75-year-old Medicare beneficiary is 
crossing the street when she is hit by a 
car. She is taken to the hospital to be 
treated for her injuries where her care, 
subsequent physician visits, and pre-
scription drugs are covered by her 
Medicare Advantage plan. 
Following this, she files a claim with 
the auto insurer of the driver who acci-
dentally hit her with his vehicle. Since 
her Medicare Advantage program paid 
for her hospital and follow-up care, the 
plan is entitled to seek reimbursement 
from the driver’s auto insurer for 
healthcare costs resulting from this ac-
cident. 
Due to the current reporting system, 
her Medicare Advantage plan or Medi-
care part D plan may never be reim-
bursed. This legislation would correct 
this issue, allowing Medicare to better 
share this information to determine if 
a claimant is a Medicare beneficiary 
and, if so, how much is owed on that 
beneficiary’s behalf. 
This information sharing is not new. 
Currently, Medicare parts A and B al-
ready share this information. Informa-
tion of the related parties will only be 
shared once a request is filed and will 
protect the beneficiary’s private med-
ical information. 
For too long, Medicare Advantage 
has been unable to receive proper reim-
bursement for the services they ensure 
are provided to our seniors. This bill is 
not only a significant process improve-
ment, but it increases the longevity of 
this vital program. 
Congress has not made any meaning-
ful improvements to the process since 
2007, when this body enacted reforms 
that allowed Medicare parts A and B to 
streamline this process. After 13 years 
of leaving other plans in the dark, this 
plan would provide a win for Medicare 
Advantage beneficiaries, settling par-
ties so that they can close out claims 
on time, CMS so they are allowed to re-
coup 
medical 
expenses, 
and, 
ulti-
mately, the American taxpayer. 
As the Representative for Kansas’ 
Fourth District, strengthening and im-
proving healthcare, especially Medi-
care Advantage, has been some of the 
most valuable representation I can pro-
vide to my constituents. I am sure 
many colleagues can say the same. 
Currently, more than 28,000 of my 
constituents rely on Medicare Advan-
tage because it still allows them to 
benefit from private-sector innovation. 
It is truly the best way to give seniors 
the care they need without sacrificing 
quality and while maintaining fiscal 
responsibility. 
Of all the process improvements that 
Congress can provide for this program 
in 2020, the PAID Act makes signifi-
cant strides to ensure that our seniors 
and future generations can benefit 
from this program. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will join me in supporting this 
bipartisan legislation at a time when 
bipartisan 
solutions 
are 
seemingly 
scarce. Together, we can build on re-
forms like this to continue to improve 
our healthcare, rebuild our economy, 
and deliver meaningful relief to Ameri-
cans looking to Congress for leadership 
through the challenges our country is 
facing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6993 
December 8, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), who is one of the sponsors of 
this bill. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 1375, the 
Provide Accurate Information Directly 
Act, or the PAID Act. 
Medicare secondary payer laws en-
acted in the 1980s have failed to stay 
current with Medicare. Medicare Ad-
vantage and part D have changed the 
way beneficiaries engage with Medi-
care and provide an opportunity for po-
tential secondary payer issues due to a 
lack of coordination. 
The PAID Act allows settling parties 
to repay MSP amounts and allows for 
the coordination of benefits by requir-
ing CMS to share necessary informa-
tion. Specifically, the PAID Act au-
thorizes settling parties to receive the 
same information CMS currently pro-
vides group health plans about Medi-
care Advantage and part D plan enroll-
ment information. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this commonsense bill. 
I thank the leader, the manager, and 
also the chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee for their leadership. 
I appreciate it. This is a really good 
bill. Let’s get it done. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 1375, the Provide Accurate Information 
Directly (or PAID) Act. 
Medicare Secondary Payer laws enacted in 
the ’80s have failed to stay current with Medi-
care. Medicare Advantage (or MA) and Part D 
have changed the way beneficiaries engage 
with Medicare and provide an opportunity for 
potential secondary payer issues due to a lack 
of coordination. 
The PAID Act allows settling parties to 
repay MSP amounts, and allow for the coordi-
nation of benefits, by requiring CMS to share 
necessary information. Specifically, the PAID 
Act authorizes settling parties to receive the 
same information CMS currently provides 
Group Health Plans about MA and Part D plan 
enrollment information. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this common-
sense bill. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I have 
no other speakers, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, at a time when bi-
partisan solutions are becoming rarer, 
the PAID Act is a meaningful, com-
monsense measure that will provide fi-
nancial stability and longevity to 
Medicare Advantage. 
Medicare Advantage is the best way 
to give seniors the care they need with-
out sacrificing quality and maintaining 
fiscal responsibility. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bipartisan measure to allow this pro-
gram to continue serving our seniors. 
America is looking toward Congress 
for leadership through all of the new 
challenges we face. Throughout our 
history, the United States has rarely 
needed bipartisanship more than it 
does now. We must work together to 
improve healthcare, rebuild our econ-
omy, and deliver meaningful relief to 
our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, again, I would like to thank 
our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, with a special thanks to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) for his 
continued work on this. 
RON KIND from Wisconsin has been 
fighting for practical, commonsense 
legislation like this almost every day 
that he has been in Congress since I 
have known him. A true sign of a Har-
vard quarterback is that he continues 
to be persistent. I want to thank him 
again for his hard work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1375, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
LARSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1375, as 
amended.

basis of a standard survey or otherwise that

compliance with the requirements specified 
in section 1861(dd) and determines that the 
deficiencies involved immediately jeopardize 
the health and safety of the individuals to

ices, the Secretary shall take immediate ac-
tion to remove the jeopardy and correct the 
deficiencies through the remedy described in 
paragraph (5)(B)(iii) or terminate the certifi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6998 
December 8, 2020 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2477, the Bene-
ficiary Enrollment Notification and 
Eligibility Simplification Act of 2020, 
as amended, includes four policies that 
improve Medicare enrollment, access, 
and quality of care. 
First, the BENES Act, as I shall con-
tinue to call it, introduced by my col-
league, Representative RAUL RUIZ, fills 
a longstanding gap in education for 
older adults and people with disabil-
ities, eliminating needless multimonth 
coverage gaps in Medicare by man-
dating that part B insurance begin the 
first month following an individual’s 
enrollment 
during 
both 
the 
later 
months of the beneficiary’s initial en-
rollment period and during the general 
enrollment period. 
The BENES Act also provides in-
creased notification to better inform 
older adults and people with disabil-
ities about Medicare eligibility enroll-
ment. 
The BENES Act also allows the Fed-
eral Government to create a part B 
special enrollment period for excep-
tional circumstances, like natural dis-
asters. 
Complex Medicare enrollment rules 
and inadequate notification cause tens 
of thousands of older adults and people 
with disabilities to face lifetime fines, 
coverage gaps, and other harmful con-
sequences. Individuals who miss their 
initial Medicare enrollment window 
may pay lifetime late enrollment pen-
alties, experience lengthy gaps in out-
patient 
health 
coverage, 
or 
face 
unaffordable and unexpected out-of- 
pocket healthcare costs. 
The bill under consideration today 
also includes two provisions based on 
legislation again championed by RON 
KIND from Wisconsin. The first will 
provide access to immunosuppressive 
therapy to individuals after a kidney 
transplant. 
I have heard from the Hartford Hos-
pital kidney transplant group and Na-
tional Kidney Foundation how vitally 
important this legislation is, and I am 
pleased that it is included. 
The second provision will make im-
provements 
to 
reporting 
regarding 
Medicare Advantage enrollees between 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services and liability and non-group 
health plans to improve financial ac-
countability. 
Finally, H.R. 2477 includes language 
from H.R. 5821, the bipartisan Helping 
Our Senior Population in Comfort En-
vironments Act, or the HOSPICE Act, 
introduced by my Ways and Means col-
leagues, Representatives JIMMY
PA-
NETTA and TOM REED. 
This policy addresses vital program 
integrity concerns identified by the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices’ Office of the Inspector General in 
2019 through a series of much-needed 
reforms that provide additional over-
sight and transparency of Medicare 
hospice providers. 
The changes in this bill align the 
HHS Secretary’s oversight tools with 
those of other Medicare providers, in-
cluding skilled nursing facilities and 
home health providers. These reforms 
are vital to improving the quality of 
care delivered to some of the most vul-
nerable patients in the healthcare sys-
tem. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2477, the Beneficiary En-
rollment Notification and Eligibility 
Simplification Act, or the BENES Act. 
This important bipartisan legislation 
will improve education and outreach to 
Americans approaching Medicare age 
while simplifying the part B enroll-
ment process, which hasn’t been up-
dated in over 50 years. 
Currently, Medicare enrollment is 
often too complicated and confusing, 
and in the event of a mistake, very 
costly. The consequences of making a 
simple mistake in the enrollment proc-
ess can be significant, with a lifetime 
late enrollment penalty of 10 percent 
for every year a beneficiary hasn’t en-
rolled in part B. 
According to a Congressional Re-
search Service report, last year, ap-
proximately 764,000 part B enrollees 
paid an average penalty of nearly 30 
percent higher Medicare premiums. 
That is a superheavy financial burden 
these Medicare beneficiaries will carry 
throughout their retirement. That is 
what the BENES Act aims to help sen-
iors avoid. 
This vital bill will help prevent late 
enrollment penalties by sending an ad-
vance notice about the Medicare en-
rollment process to Americans ap-
proaching Medicare eligibility. It will 
also prevent gaps in coverage by re-
quiring that part B coverage begin dur-
ing the first month after an individual 
enrolls through either the initial en-
rollment period or general enrollment 
period. 
These long-overdue reforms will sig-
nificantly improve the health and well- 
being of Medicare beneficiaries and 
protect America’s seniors from unnec-
essary 
penalties 
and 
unexpected 
healthcare bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. PANETTA), 
a distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman LARSON, and I appre-
ciate all of his work and, of course, his 
support and friendship. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 2477, the 
BENES Act, which includes my bill and 
TOM REED’s bill, the bipartisan HOS-
PICE Act. 
Now, I think we can all agree that 
every family wants to ensure that their 
loved one in hospice receives the end- 
of-life care that is compassionate, that 
is cautious, and, of course, that is cir-
cumspect so that they can pass with 
dignity and all of us are at peace. 
Now, we know while most of our Na-
tion’s Medicare hospice care providers 
work tirelessly to ensure their patients 
receive high quality care, there are, 
unfortunately, bad actors. That is why 
we introduced the bipartisan HOSPICE 
Act, so that through education, out-
reach, and even liability we can safe-
guard care for Medicare hospice enroll-
ees, increase transparency and safety, 
and penalize those who fail to provide 
the necessary care for their patients. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation to ensure that hospice care is 
not just about death, but it is about 
death with dignity, integrity, and ac-
countability. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2477, which includes some 
legislation to improve Medicare cov-
erage for kidney transplant recipients. 
The Trump administration has made 
increasing rates of kidney transplan-
tation a priority. It is more cost-effec-
tive than dialysis and results in a dra-
matic increase in the quality of life for 
ESRD patients. However, these pa-
tients must continue taking medica-
tion for the remainder of their life so 
that they don’t reject their organs. 
Currently, Medicare will only cover 
the cost of these drugs for 36 months 
after a kidney transplant. Patients 
who do not have health insurance or 
lose their insurance coverage have to 
choose between paying thousands of 
dollars a month out of pocket or risk 
the chance of rejection of their organs. 
If organ rejection does occur, these 
patients must once again endure the 
painful, time-consuming, and expensive 
dialysis treatments paid for by the 
Medicare program. By simply paying 
for the cost of these drugs and pre-
venting patients from crashing back 
into dialysis, the Federal Government

can save hundreds of millions of dollars 
and improve thousands of lives. 
We should not allow such unneces-
sary waste and suffering to occur. 
These Americans should not have to 
worry about how they will afford the 
cost of the medications that allow 
them to live a completely normal life. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tives KIND and BURGESS for their lead-
ership and for working together on this 
commonsense bipartisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to 
pass H.R. 2477. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. REED). 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the HOSPICE bill, 
which is a part of the overall BENES 
Act we are debating today. And I am 
proud to support the HOSPICE bill 
that I introduced and authored with 
my good friend, JIMMY PANETTA, from 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I can tell you, when 
loved ones, like my mother, became 
sick, it is common to be left feeling 
helpless and for families not having the 
resources to deal with that terrible sit-
uation. But I thank God every day we 
were able to support my mother with a 
wonderful team, not only of our family 
but of our hospice care providers. They 
gave her, and they gave us, the needed 
companionship and resources to have 
some sense of normalcy at the end of 
her illness. That experience reaffirmed 
the critical importance of the quality- 
of-life care that hospice care rep-
resents. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I am a 
hospice volunteer in my personal time 
here in Washington, D.C. I am a strong 
advocate for hospice care across Amer-
ica. 
However, while most hospice employ-
ees and volunteers and compassionate 
caregivers are good, hardworking indi-
viduals, there are some who neglect 
and potentially even abuse patients in 
that situation. We must hold those bad 
actors accountable. We must demand 
additional oversight of hospice pro-
viders. We must educate providers with 
additional training to ensure patients 
receive the best and most proper level 
of care they deserve. 
We are confident this legislation 
would do just that by giving HHS the 
tools it needs to penalize those that 
provide poor quality care. Our legisla-
tion would also improve provider trans-
parency by requiring States to main-
tain a toll-free hotline where abuse and 
neglect can be reported. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand 
in support of this legislation. More im-
portantly, I am proud to be a hospice 
volunteer myself, and I am proud to 
stand with the hospice community that 
is giving so much great quality care to 
those that need it most in their most 
precious time that they have left. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill and the un-
derlying legislation upon which it 
rides. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2477, the 
Beneficiary 
Enrollment 
Notification 
and Eligibility Simplification Act, the 
BENES Act. 
Unfortunately, 
complex 
and 
con-
fusing Medicare enrollment rules com-
bined with a lack of notification cause 
tens of thousands of older adults and 
people with disabilities to incur life-
time fines, coverage gaps, and other 
harmful consequences. This is not fair 
to our seniors. With fewer people auto-
matically enrolled in Medicare and 
10,000 baby boomers aging into Medi-
care each day, more people new to 
Medicare must actively enroll in the 
program. 
To address this issue, the BENES Act 
is here for us. It directs the Federal 
Government to provide advance notice 
to individuals approaching Medicare 
eligibility about basic Medicare and 
Medicare Advantage enrollment rules. 
It directs Part B to begin the first of 
the month following one’s enrollment 
during both the later months of their 
initial enrollment period and during 
the general enrollment period, closing 
coverage gaps. 
It also requires HHS to submit a re-
port to Congress on how best to align 
the annual general enrollment period 
with the annual enrollment period for 
private Medicare Advantage and Medi-
care Part D prescription drug plans to 
reduce confusion. 
And it enables HHS to create a Part 
B special enrollment period for excep-
tional circumstances; a provision cur-
rently used in Medicare Advantage and 
Medicare Part D when people are un-
able to sign up for Medicare due to oc-
currences, like living in an area im-
pacted by a disaster or emergency. 
I thank my colleague, Dr. RUIZ, for 
his leadership and partnership on this 
particular bill. 
Madam Speaker, all of these bills are 
so vital to our seniors, very important 
bills, and I am glad we are passing 
them in a bipartisan fashion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, again, to support this com-
monsense protective measure for sen-
iors, veterans, and those living with 
disabilities. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2477, the Beneficiary Enroll-
ment Notification and Eligibility Sim-
plification Act. 
The notification system created in 
this bill for individuals approaching 
the age of eligibility for Social Secu-
rity will soon provide a notice explain-
ing: First, enrollment; second, eligi-
bility; and coordination of Medicare 
benefits. 
And why is that so important in the 
case of Puerto Rico? 
Puerto Rico has a participation rate 
of 70 percent in Medicare Advantage. 
That will tell you how important it is 
for us. This will be especially beneficial 
where Medicare recipients must make 
the affirmative step of signing up for 
Medicare Part B, rather than be auto-
matically enrolled upon turning 65, un-
like anywhere else in the Nation. This 
is something that we have been fight-
ing for many years. 
The lack of adequate notice of this 
difference has resulted in a substan-
tially higher percentage of Medicare 
Part B enrollees in Puerto Rico paying 
lifetime late enrollment penalties of 10 
percent of the premium for every year 
they failed to enroll. 
Currently, almost 40,000 Medicare 
beneficiaries who live in Puerto Rico 
are paying lifetime penalties of $20.3 
million a year. These penalties are par-
ticularly difficult when you take into 
account that 43.5 percent of my con-
stituents live in poverty and they are 
not eligible for SSI or Medicare sub-
sidies. 
Madam Speaker, I introduced H.R. 
2310 to address this disparity and en-
courage my colleagues to also support 
this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
2477 and support our seniors. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Indiana 
for the recognition. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of a 
bill that includes coverage for im-
munosuppressive drugs after a kidney 
transplant. This is something we have 
worked on for a decade but, more im-
portantly, for kidney patients and 
their families, this has been a priority 
for much, much longer. 
Madam Speaker, today’s bill is mon-
umental in the life of the transplant 
patient. In 1972, Congress voted to 
allow Medicare coverage for end-stage 
renal disease patients under 65 years of 
age. The policy opened the doors for 
patients to have Medicare pay for di-
alysis and kidney transplants, but it 
wasn’t quite enough. 
A new kidney gives the hope of a bet-
ter quality of life to patients, but only 
if they take those immunosuppressive 
drugs. Otherwise, their own immune 
system is going to recognize the renal 
graft as a foreign object and reject it, 
but that is their new kidney. So with-
out these drugs, patients risk rejection 
of a kidney and a return to dialysis. 
Now, Medicare, to be sure, will pay 
for that return to dialysis and another 
renal transplant—if they are lucky

enough to get one—but it will not pay 
for more than 36 months of immuno-
suppressive drug coverage. This is in-
credibly expensive for the Medicare 
system, but think of the toll on the 
lives of kidney patients and their fami-
lies. 
So the bill before us today will ad-
dress 
the 
immunosuppressive 
drug 
issue directly by requiring Medicare to 
cover these drugs past 36 months for 
kidney patients who do not obtain 
other health coverage. 
Look, a kidney transplant is a gift 
from one human to another. From the 
government’s perspective, the trans-
action is an investment that allows the 
government to make that investment 
into a patient’s future, and this policy 
allows us to protect that investment, 
so it is a policy that is good for the pa-
tient, to be sure. As a side benefit, it is 
a benefit to the taxpayer. 
Madam Speaker, both the CMS Office 
of the Actuary and the Office of the As-
sistant Secretary for Planning and 
Evaluation at HHS have published re-
ports on the benefits of extending 
Medicare 
coverage 
of 
immuno-
suppressive drugs, which include finan-
cial savings for the Medicare program. 
So after years, literally a decade, of 
wrestling with the policy, a light fi-
nally shone over the Congressional 
Budget Office and they confirmed what 
others have known all along, that this 
delivers savings to Medicare. The pol-
icy also aligns and builds on what the 
Trump administration has done with 
the kidney health initiatives, including 
the 
Advancing 
American 
Kidney 
Health executive order, which the 
President signed in July of 2019. 
So this immunosuppressive drug pol-
icy has support from everyone—from 
the patients, to transplant surgeons, to 
patients’ families, and it is something 
behind which the kidney coalition has 
coalesced for years. We would not be 
here today if it were not for the tire-
less work of that community and other 
cosponsors. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank all of the many people, including 
the staffers on both of our committees, 
who have worked over the past decade, 
they have tuned and fine-tuned this 
policy to get it where it is today.

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
before 
I 
close, 
throughout the day, I am sure people 
observing have viewed us taking off 
and putting on our masks, et cetera. I 
would like to acknowledge a very spe-
cial person from Mayberry Village in 
East Hartford, Connecticut, who made 
this mask and several like these and 
has distributed them out of the kind-
ness of her heart and concern and care. 
Her name is Margaret Grady Ramsey 
from Mayberry Village in East Hart-
ford, Connecticut. I thank Peg for all 
her hard work. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I know 
that Dr. RUIZ has worked tirelessly on 
the BENES Act for many years. I 
thank him for his efforts. I also thank 
the Medicare beneficiary advocates, in-
cluding the Medicare Rights Center 
and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, 
for their tireless work and support to 
find a solution to this longstanding 
problem. 
The gentlewoman from Indiana has 
also played a key role in this as well, 
and I want to make sure we acknowl-
edge her as well. 
H.R. 2477, the BENES Act, provides 
significant long-term improvements to 
Medicare for millions of beneficiaries. I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as more and more 
Americans reach Medicare age, we need 
to simplify the part B enrollment proc-
ess and improve education and out-
reach to seniors. The commonsense re-
forms in this bipartisan BENES Act 
will protect seniors from unnecessary 
late enrollment penalties, gaps in cov-
erage, and unexpected healthcare bills. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
vital piece of legislation that will sim-
plify complicated Medicare enrollment 
rules. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
LARSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2477, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

THE ONE STOP SHOP COMMUNITY 
REENTRY PROGRAM ACT OF 2020 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8161) to authorize implementa-
tion grants to community-based non-
profits to operate one-stop reentry cen-
ters, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8161 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘The One Stop 
Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. COMMUNITY REENTRY CENTER GRANT 
PROGRAM. 
(a) PROGRAM

to providing reentry services; 
(B) develop a needs assessment tool to survey 
or conduct focus groups with community mem-
bers in order to identify—

and the barriers such individuals face; and 
(ii) the needs of the families and communities 
to which such individuals are returning; and 
(C) use the information gathered pursuant to 
subparagraph (B) to determine the reentry serv-

OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
There is authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) and the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to be the 
author of H.R. 8161, The One Stop Shop 
Community Reentry Program Act of 
2020, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important reentry measure 
and pass this bipartisan bill today. 
I would like to take a moment to 
give a special thanks to Representative 
GUY RESCHENTHALER for his support. 
H.R. 8161 will provide much-needed 
resources to especially communities 
with a disproportionate number of re-
turning citizens. The idea of the bill is 
to provide grants to establish a cen-
tralized process to assist individuals 
returning to their communities after 
incarceration. It acts as a bridge by 
providing guidance to those who are 
leaving prison and jails on how to be-
come productive members of their 
communities. 
The concept of the bill is that fund-
ing would be provided to communities 
and neighborhoods to establish pro-
grams where people who are formerly 
incarcerated can run the program to 
essentially be a hand-holding bridge for 
people who are coming out of facilities 
to help them reintegrate into the com-
munity. 
Many things that we might take for 
granted, such as getting your ID, get-
ting a driver’s license, paying your 
back child support, learning how to use 
transportation or the latest technology 
are things that can lead to recidivism 
for people if they are not able to re-
integrate. 
If you don’t have a driver’s license 
and you come from communities like 
mine in Los Angeles, without a car, it 
is virtually impossible to have a job 
that would allow you to support your-
self. 
Establishing a one-stop center where 
formerly incarcerated people are in-
volved in every aspect of the manage-
ment and running of the center will 
allow people to be reintegrated. 
This Congress, in a series of hearings, 
the Judiciary Committee heard the 
challenges faced by people who are re-
cently released. Sadly, these stories 
have only gotten worse over the years 
because, as we have incarcerated more 
people, we have also passed laws that 
essentially do not allow them to func-
tion in the legal economy, and we 
shouldn’t be surprised when people 
recidivate. 
For example, in some prisons, we 
have training programs. In California, 
we had a training program to teach 
people who were incarcerated how to be 
barbers, but then we passed laws that 
said we wouldn’t allow formerly incar-
cerated people to get a barber’s license. 
So that type of reintegration bridge is 
what this bill addressed. 
As we have passed policies that lead 
formerly incarcerated people outside of 
the legal economy, in these commu-
nities where there is a disproportionate 
number, you actually can see an in-
crease in crime rate, because people 
will do whatever is needed to survive, 
and many times that means going back 
to illegal activity. 
Each year, over 650,000 people are re-
leased from custody. Finding jobs, job 
training, housing, and placement, or 
even finding a hot meal can be chal-
lenging. For many, these barriers seem 
insurmountable. This is especially true 
for individuals who are returning to 
their communities and might have sub-
stance abuse, mental health disorders, 
or educational challenges. 
We already know that many people 
who are incarcerated do not have a 
high school diploma. So a one-stop 
community center can help them get 
the resources and the training that 
they need so that they can become pro-
ductive citizens. 
During our hearings, we heard great 
examples of community leaders who 
are doing this work with minimal re-
sources. Susan Burton, for example, 
the founder of A New Way of Life in 
Los Angeles, transports women as soon 
as they are released and provides them 
a safe place to live. 
Criminal justice advocates Andrea 
James, Conan Harris, and Big John, 
from Los Angeles, have testified before 
the Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security. They 
highlighted the importance of starting 
reentry services on the very first day 
someone enters into custody. 
H.R. 8161 transforms obstacles into 
bridges. That is why having all reentry 
services in one place is so critical. 
Trained staff and peer mentors can 
guide returning individuals through 
the process of finding a safe place to 
sleep, apply for benefits, addressing 
family reunification, and starting the 
process of gaining employment. 
Importantly, one-stop centers will be 
led by and employ formerly incarcer-
ated individuals who can act as men-
tors. They can provide direct services 
to recently released individuals. This 
will give them the wherewithal they 
need to meet the challenges before 
them. 
b 1615 
H.R. 8161 provides support for smaller 
or rural communities that are not 
large enough to support a large one- 
stop operation. So it authorizes the De-
partment of Justice to establish a 24/7 
reentry service assistance hotline to 
direct recently released individuals to 
appropriate reentry services in their 
localities. 
It is important to remember that the 
vast majority of the 2.3 million people

who are currently in custody will be re-
leased. Without the right types of sup-
port, 
they 
are 
highly 
likely 
to 
recidivate. No reentering person, re-
gardless of where they live, should be 
left wondering how to establish their 
life and find gainful employment. 
Our bipartisan bill provides commu-
nities with desperately needed re-
sources to assist returning citizens in 
their efforts to successfully rejoin their 
communities. Between the one-stop 
center and the 24/7 hotline, Congress is 
again providing leadership on reentry 
issues and, in turn, promoting public 
safety. 
This is a bipartisan effort, and again, 
I want to thank my colleagues for their 
cosponsorship and for working with me 
on this issue. 
For the foregoing reasons, I urge my 
colleagues to join in supporting this 
important bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, successful prisoner 
reentry into society is critical to re-
ducing recidivism, improving public 
safety, and saving taxpayer dollars. 
We have seen successful criminal jus-
tice reform programs, including re-
entry 
programs, 
work 
in 
both 
Republican- 
and 
Democratic-led 
States, including North Dakota. Suc-
cessful reentry programs often utilize 
community-based groups like F5 in my 
home State. 
Likewise, President Trump has been 
a leader in criminal justice reform. He 
and his administration have signed bi-
partisan legislation, such as the First 
Step Act, to make our Federal criminal 
justice system fair. 
The First Step Act reauthorized pro-
grams that support State, local, and 
Tribal governments and nonprofit or-
ganizations in their work to reduce re-
cidivism and to help people returning 
to society from incarceration. 
H.R. 8161, the One Stop Shop Commu-
nity Reentry Program Act of 2020, will 
build on the administration’s strong 
criminal 
justice 
reform 
initiatives. 
This bill will provide grants for the 
purpose of creating a unified location 
for reentry services in the communities 
that serve former prisoners. These fa-
cilities will include job training, coun-
seling, substance abuse treatment, edu-
cation, and medical services, among 
others. 
All of the data suggests that the 
most vulnerable time for someone 
being released from incarceration is 
within the first 30 days after release. I 
have seen this frustration firsthand as 
clients and offenders encounter unnec-
essary bureaucratic obstacles when 
trying to rebuild their lives. They must 
obtain housing, find a job, adhere to 
probation requirements, among many 
other tasks. That struggle is especially 
difficult when the individual suffers 
from substance abuse or, as Congress-
woman BASS suggested, lacks even a 
high school education. 
These one-stop centers will help 
break the cycle of addiction and recidi-
vism. This bill complements the recidi-
vism reduction programs funded by the 
Second Chance Act and reauthorized by 
President Trump. 
I am pleased our colleagues recognize 
the administration’s criminal justice 
successes and the bipartisan effort on 
these bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, for 
the roughly 10 million people who, each 
year, reenter communities from jail or 
prison, the consequences of a criminal 
sentence can last a lifetime, creating 
barriers to accessing safe housing, em-
ployment, and even something as basic 
as a government ID. 
As the mayor of Providence, I assem-
bled a reentry council to bring to-
gether community leaders, including 
religious leaders, employers, and hous-
ing professionals, to help people re-
turning to their communities with the 
goal of giving people a chance to fully 
reenter society after they have com-
pleted their sentence. 
During my time as mayor, I saw how 
providing 
community-based 
reentry 
services helps to ensure that justice-in-
volved individuals have the support 
they need for smooth transition back 
into society. 
When formerly incarcerated people 
have access to their basic needs being 
met, like food assistance and employ-
ment opportunities, it can signifi-
cantly reduce the likelihood they will 
commit a new offense and, as a result, 
make our communities safer. It gives 
returning citizens the ability to pro-
vide for themselves, for their families, 
and to be productive members of their 
communities. 
That is why I am proud to support 
H.R. 8161, the One Stop Shop Commu-
nity Reentry Program Act, which pro-
vides 5-year grants to community- 
based organizations and other eligible 
entities to create community reentry 
centers. 
The One Stop Shop Community Re-
entry Program Act incentivizes com-
munity-based solutions to overcoming 
barriers to housing, education, employ-
ment, and healthcare. It seeks to end 
the revolving door of recidivism. It 
promotes healing by encouraging treat-
ment and family counseling. It helps 
people navigate life after prison and 
successfully 
reenter 
their 
commu-
nities. It makes our communities safer 
and gives people a fair shot at a second 
chance, a chance at redemption, and a 
chance at success. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairwoman BASS
for her extraor-
dinary leadership on H.R. 8161, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this excellent legislation. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to take 
this opportunity to say this is a great 
bill and there are great people in gov-
ernment at the State, Federal, and 
local level who really do care and help 
to try and do these things, and we have 
come a long way in the last 5 to 10 
years on a lot of these issues. 
But I think it is really important to 
recognize that, oftentimes, the best 
people in organizations to help people 
reenter into society are often former 
felons 
themselves 
who 
have 
gone 
through these processes and have start-
ed community-based organizations and 
have continued to work with new peo-
ple coming out of prison. 
While we have to treat criminal jus-
tice and we have to treat serious of-
fenses in the manner that is deserving 
of what they are, we also believe in re-
habilitation; and what we do with that, 
particularly more than anything else, 
is a return on investment because, as 
we can get these people through this 
process and keep them out of the re-
volving door that can sometimes occur 
in the criminal justice system, we save 
people’s lives, we save families, and we 
actually save taxpayer money. 
This is a great bill, and I appreciate 
everybody’s work on it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, the over-
whelming majority of incarcerated in-
dividuals are released from jail or pris-
on and returned to their communities. 
This bill would take meaningful steps 
to make the reentry process more effi-
cient and, ultimately, more successful. 
Along with the 24/7 reentry hotline, 
community-funded reentry programs, 
like the services included in this bill, 
will reduce recidivism and improve 
overall community safety. These indi-
viduals will be able to successfully re-
join and contribute to their families 
and communities. That is why this bill 
is so important. 
In our Nation, we used to believe 
that, if you committed a crime and you 
served your time in prison, you were 
able to reenter society. This bill is a 
return to that time period. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this bill. I 
thank my colleague, Representative 
ARMSTRONG, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 8161, the ‘‘One 
Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act 
of 2020,’’ which creates a new grant program 
that will provide money to States, Tribes, local 
governments, and community-based non-prof-
its to create one-stop reentry centers to assist 
people who were recently released from jail or 
prison. 
The bill would also create a grant program 
for a toll-free hotline for returning individuals to 
access reentry services. 
As one who has worked on community re-
entry and recidivism reduction for most of ten-
ure on this Committee, I am proud to join 
Crime Subcommittee Chair Karen Bass (D– 
CA) as a cosponsor of this legislation. 
There are currently over 2.1 million people 
incarcerated in local, state, and federal correc-
tional facilities, a number that represents a

more than 500 percent increase in the incar-
cerated population over the last 40 years. 
Over 95 percent of people currently incar-
cerated will eventually be released back to 
their communities. 
In fact, approximately 600,000 people are 
released from custody every year and at the 
end of 2016, an estimated 4.5 million adults 
were under community supervision, which in-
cludes probation or parole. 
Reentry services are essential for this popu-
lation, to ensure that these individuals transi-
tion smoothly out of jail and prison and to 
keep recidivism to a minimum. 
The recidivism rates for individuals leaving 
prisons remain high, and a large number of 
those released from prison will ultimately find 
themselves back in the criminal legal system. 
A 2018 study found that 83 percent of peo-
ple released from prisons in 2005 were ar-
rested at least once during the nine years fol-
lowing their release, and of those released 
from state prisons, 44 percent were arrested 
at least once in the year immediately following 
their release. 
Lack of access to resources upon release 
leads to a cycle of rearrest and reincarceration 
that some scholars call the ‘‘revolving door’’ to 
prison. 
This cycle of recidivism has tremendous fi-
nancial 
consequences—the 
United 
States 
spends over $80 billion dollars a year on in-
carceration—not to mention the human toll it 
takes on families and communities. 
The cycle of release, rearrest, and reincar-
ceration, also costs state and local commu-
nities over $100 million in policing and judicial 
administration costs. 
While some returning individuals have a re-
lease plan, many people are released from 
custody with only their personal property, little 
money, and no place to go. 
The result of not having a reentry plan can 
be ruinous. 
In the last decade, policymakers have 
begun to measure the effects of reentry on re-
turning individuals, their families, and their 
communities. 
Studies show that most people enter the 
prison system with low levels of education, 
limited work experience, substance abuse 
issues, and mental health infirmities, and that 
these same issues are still present when a 
person is released from prison. 
Without appropriate reentry services to as-
sist them, many returning citizens find them-
selves back in the criminal justice system. 
H.R. 8161 provides grants to community- 
based organizations for the creation of one- 
stop reentry centers, which would combine the 
provision of various reentry services in one lo-
cation, thus making it easier for returning citi-
zens to access them. 
The one-stop shop model that this legisla-
tion promotes would aim to provide complete 
reentry services to address the critical ele-
ments of the reentry process that promote 
long-term reentry success. 
The one-stop centers would include support 
personnel, who themselves are formerly incar-
cerated individuals, to provide direct support 
for recently released individuals. 
In addition, where reentry services may not 
logistically be able to be placed in a single ge-
ographic location, this legislation authorizes 
the Attorney General to fund States and local 
jurisdictions to establish 24/7 reentry service 
assistance hotlines that direct recently re-
leased individuals to appropriate reentry re-
sources. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 8161, the ‘‘One Stop Shop Community 
Reentry Program Act of 2020.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8161, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise in 
strong support of the Criminal Anti-
trust Anti-Retaliation Act, legislation 
that I introduced with Chairman NAD-
LER, Chairman CICILLINE, and Ranking 
Member SENSENBRENNER that would ex-
tend whistleblower protections to pri-
vate-sector 
employees 
who 
report 
criminal antitrust violations to the 
Federal Government. 
Just by way of background, the 
Criminal 
Antitrust 
Anti-Retaliation 
Act is based on recommendations from 
a 2011 Government Accountability Of-
fice report. The legislation will protect 
private-sector employees for simply 
doing the right thing and ensure that 
those who retaliate against whistle-
blowers are held accountable. 
Under the legislation, an employee 
who believes that he or she is a victim 
of retaliation can file a complaint with 
the Secretary of Labor, and it allows 
for that employee to be reinstated to 
their former position if the Secretary 
finds in his or her favor. 
Mr. Speaker, antitrust violations 
often result in higher prices, less inno-
vation, and fundamentally less choice. 
Private-sector employees are integral 
in maintaining the integrity of our 
antitrust laws, without whom viola-
tions such as price and wage fixing 
would go unreported. 
Since our Nation’s founding, our 
country has had a rich tradition of 
working 
to 
protect 
whistleblowers. 
Today, more than ever, honoring that 
history is tremendously important. No 
employee should fear for their job or 
face retaliation for exposing illegal, 
anticompetitive behavior, such as price 
fixing. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
Chairman 
CICILLINE, and the majority leader for 
bringing this bill to the House floor. 
I also want to thank Senator GRASS-
LEY
and Senator LEAHY
for spear-
heading this effort in the Senate and 
for working so persistently to get it 
passed in that Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 2258, the Criminal 
Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, like its 
House companion, H.R. 8226, protects 
whistleblowers who help the Federal 
Government investigate and prosecute 
criminal violations of antitrust laws. 
When workers give information to 
law enforcement, cooperate with crimi-
nal investigations, or testify about an 
employer’s crimes, their employer may 
retaliate. Retaliation can take many 
forms, such as firing, demotion, sus-
pension, or other types of retaliatory 
discrimination. Whatever its form, re-
taliation is wrong. 
Workers should not be punished when 
they 
help 
the 
authorities 
address 
criminal antitrust violations, viola-
tions that ultimately harm American 
consumers. If this retaliation goes 
unaddressed, it can have damaging 
long-term 
effects. 
For 
one 
thing, 
unaddressed retaliation can suppress 
future whistleblowers who might oth-
erwise step forward to shine a light on 
any wrongdoing. 
When whistleblowers are scared to 
speak out, law enforcement may never 
learn of the criminal antitrust viola-
tions in the first place. Likewise, with-
out the help from whistleblowers dur-
ing investigations, law enforcement 
agencies may be unable to successfully 
prosecute wrongdoers. 
S. 2258 addresses these policy con-
cerns by prohibiting retaliatory dis-
crimination 
against 
whistleblowers 
who speak out against criminal anti-
trust violations. 
This bill also gives whistleblowers re-
course if their employers do choose to 
retaliate. Under the bill, a whistle-
blower can file a complaint through a 
process the Department of Labor over-
sees and, in limited circumstances, 
seek relief by suing in Federal court. 
While establishing whistleblower pro-
tections, S. 2258 also puts important 
guardrails in place to ensure that bad 
actors do not abuse this law. The bill 
denies whistleblower protections to 
people who instigate the violation of 
criminal antitrust laws or obstruct an 
investigation. Instead, the bill will pro-
tect workers who are acting in good 
faith. 
Finally, I should note that our col-
league, 
Congressman 
JIM
SENSEN-
BRENNER, a cosponsor of the House 
companion bill, has worked throughout 
his career to protect whistleblowers 
from retaliation. He has described the 
general policy animating this bill and 
highlighted the importance of whistle-
blowers when he said that whistle-
blowers help maintain the integrity of 
our laws. Mr. SENSENBRENNER is cor-
rect. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, how 
much do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The gentleman from Colo-
rado has 18 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), the chairman of the Anti-
trust, Commercial, and Administrative 
Law Subcommittee. 
b 1630 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of S. 2258, the Crimi-
nal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, 
which was introduced in the House by 
Congressman NEGUSE, that is H.R. 8226, 
a piece of legislation that he relent-
lessly championed and it finally is be-
fore us for final passage. 
This important legislation protects 
whistleblowers who report criminal 
misconduct under the antitrust laws. 
As my good friend just mentioned, I 
would also like to acknowledge the 
leadership of JIM SENSENBRENNER, who 
will be retiring from Congress, but who 
has made protection of whistleblowers 
an important part of his work here, 
and we will miss him on the Antitrust, 
Commercial and Administrative Law 
Subcommittee. 
This important bill provides employ-
ees with a mechanism for reporting re-
taliation to the Department of Labor. 
Whistleblowers who report on criminal 
antitrust conduct and are retaliated 
against, such as through wrongful dis-
charge, demotion, or harassment will 
have a path for reinstatement, be able 
to be compensated for harms that they 
suffer and reimbursed for litigation ex-
penses for meritorious claims. 
By extending these protections to 
employees who report criminal viola-
tions of antitrust laws to the Federal 
Government, this important measure 
will encourage whistleblowers to come 
forward to report extreme criminal 
violations of the antitrust laws, such 
as price and wage fixing, which are the 
supreme evil of antitrust. 
Moreover, this legislation brings the 
criminal antitrust laws in line with 
other important laws, such as the Sar-
banes-Oxley Act, which protects whis-
tleblowers who report corporate wrong-
doing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7009 
December 8, 2020 
No worker in America should fear for 
their job or economic livelihood for ex-
posing corporations that engage in 
criminal activity, and exposing this 
misconduct is critical for antitrust en-
forcement purposes. 
I want to end where I began by ap-
plauding Congressman NEGUSE, the 
vice chair of the House Judiciary Anti-
trust, Commercial and Administrative 
Law Subcommittee, a really valued 
and deeply respected member of the 
subcommittee, for his extraordinary 
leadership on this vital legislation, 
which has already been passed unani-
mously by the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
legislation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the chairman of the Anti-
trust, Commercial and Administrative 
Law Subcommittee, Mr. CICILLINE, for 
his leadership, his thoughtfulness, and 
for making consumer protection the 
central focus of his work and the Anti-
trust, Commercial and Administrative 
Law Subcommittee’s work over this 
past Congress. 
I also thank Mr. ARMSTRONG, my col-
league on the other side of the aisle. 
I would lend my voice, as well, to 
those who have rightfully praised the 
work of Mr. SENSENBRENNER who, for 
many years in the United States Con-
gress, has served with distinction rep-
resenting the people of Wisconsin. And 
I know that this bill was certainly im-
portant to him, and we appreciate his 
efforts on that front. 
Finally, I would close with this: It 
can be lost on the American public as 
we talk about things like price fixing 
and the antitrust laws that are cur-
rently on the books how that connects 
to the everyday life of Americans. Fun-
damentally, this bill is about consumer 
protection. It is about protecting the 
public. 
Before I came to Congress, I served 
several years in the cabinet of then- 
Governor John Hickenlooper, leading 
our State’s Consumer Protection Agen-
cy, the Department of Regulatory 
Agencies’ 600-person department with a 
$100 million budget, civil servants from 
across our State working hard each 
and every day to protect the con-
suming public and the people of the 
State of Colorado, the same work that 
folks do at the FTC and the Depart-
ment of Justice in the Antitrust Divi-
sion each and every day. 
This is another tool that can be used 
in the toolbox of regulators here in 
Washington as we work to make con-
sumer protection a priority and ulti-
mately partner with those in the pri-
vate sector who wish to report abusive 
and 
anticompetitive 
conduct 
that 
might be happening in the broader 
marketplace. 
Again, I am thankful to the sponsors 
of this bill in the Senate, to the leader-
ship in the House for bringing this bill 
forward to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the legislation before the 
House, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2258. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

menced under section 304 of PROMESA (48 
U.S.C. 2164) pending the filing of a verified 
statement under paragraph (1). 
(e) LIMITATION ON COMPENSATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—In a voluntary case com-
menced under section 304 of PROMESA (48 
U.S.C. 2164), in connection with the review 
and approval of professional compensation 
under section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48 
U.S.C. 2176, 2177), the court may deny allow-
ance of compensation for services and reim-
bursement of expenses, accruing after the 
date of the enactment of this Act of a profes-
sional person if the professional person— 
(A) has failed to file statements of connec-
tions required by subsection (a) or has filed 
inadequate statements of connections; 
(B) except as provided in paragraph (3), is 
on or after the date of enactment of this Act 
not a disinterested person, as defined in sec-
tion 101 of title 11, United States Code; or 
(C) except as provided in paragraph (3), rep-
resents, or holds an interest adverse to, the 
interest of the estate with respect to the 
matter on which such professional person is 
employed. 
(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making a deter-
mination under paragraph (1), the court may 
take into consideration whether the services 
and expenses are in the best interests of 
creditors and the estate. 
(3) COMMITTEE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.— 
An attorney or accountant described in sec-
tion 1103(b) of title 11, United States Code, 
shall be deemed to have violated paragraph 
(1) if the attorney or accountant violates 
section 1103(b) of title 11, United States 
Code. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 683, the Puerto 
Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures 
Act, or PRRADA, is bipartisan legisla-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7010 
December 8, 2020 
the ongoing financial reorganization of 
Puerto Rico. 
In response to dire fiscal issues fac-
ing Puerto Rico at the time, Congress 
passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, and Economic Stability Act, 
or PROMESA, in 2016. 
That legislation established the Fi-
nancial Oversight and Management 
Board with control over Puerto Rico’s 
budget, laws, financial plans, and regu-
lations and the authority to retain pro-
fessionals to assist the board in exe-
cuting its responsibilities. 
Although largely patterned on Chap-
ter 
11 
of 
the 
Bankruptcy 
Code, 
PROMESA did not incorporate all fac-
ets of Chapter 11 and other relevant 
provisions of the code. 
Importantly, this includes the code’s 
mandatory disclosure requirements re-
garding actual or potential conflicts of 
interest that professional persons seek-
ing to be retained in a bankruptcy case 
must make to the court prior to their 
retention. 
This bill would close that loophole by 
conditioning the compensation of pro-
fessional 
persons 
retained 
under 
PROMESA upon certain disclosures 
similar to those required under the 
Bankruptcy Code. 
Additionally, the bill would require 
the United States trustee to review 
these disclosures and submit comments 
in response to the Court, and also au-
thorizes the United States trustee to 
object to compensation requested by 
professionals. 
And finally, H.R. 683 would allow 
courts to deny the compensation for 
services and reimbursement of ex-
penses if the professional person did 
not comply with the disclosure require-
ment, was not a disinterested person, 
or represented or held an interest ad-
verse to the bankruptcy estate. 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for 
her leadership in championing this bill 
and for her relentless dedication to en-
suring that the people of Puerto Rico 
receive the fair, efficient, and trans-
parent restructuring process they de-
serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, which was favorably 
reported out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee by unanimous vote, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2016, Puerto Rico 
faced serious and increasing financial 
pressure brought on by significant debt 
and related obligations. 
In response to that financial crisis, 
Congress passed the Puerto Rico Over-
sight, Management, and Economic Sta-
bility Act of 2016. 
This 2016 law set up a bankruptcy 
mechanism for Puerto Rico to address 
its obligations. 
Like other existing bankruptcy laws, 
the 2016 law enables bankruptcy profes-
sionals, such as lawyers and consult-
ants, to apply for payment for their 
services subject to court approval. 
But the 2016 law lacked certain dis-
closure requirements for professionals, 
even though these requirements apply 
to professionals in any other bank-
ruptcy case. 
That gap in the law created the po-
tential for unaddressed conflicts of in-
terest for professionals involved in 
Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy process. 
To address this concern, H.R. 683 es-
tablishes disclosure requirements for 
accountants, lawyers, and other bank-
ruptcy professionals working on mat-
ters related to Puerto Rico’s bank-
ruptcy. 
The additional disclosure require-
ments in H.R. 683 increase the likeli-
hood that any conflicts of interest will 
be caught and timely addressed before 
compensation decisions are made. 
Taken as a whole, this added level of 
transparency will benefit important in-
terests, such as those of the creditors 
and taxpayers and ultimately of Puerto 
Rico itself. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N.) 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 683, the Puerto Rico Recovery Ac-
curacy in Disclosures Act. 
Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ and my-
self have proposed this initiative since 
the last Congress, and I am thankful 
that on this occasion we have been able 
to count on the original cosponsorship 
of Chairman GRIJALVA
and Ranking 
Member BISHOP, as well as many other 
cosponsors, 
both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. 
This bill is an important component 
in ensuring that the restructuring 
process under PROMESA looks out for 
Puerto Rico’s best interests. 
This legislation requires any counsel 
and professional personnel that the Fi-
nancial Oversight and Management 
Board may hire to work on a title III 
case for the restructuring of Puerto 
Rico’s debt, to submit verified disclo-
sures of their connections with the 
debtor, creditors, or persons employed 
by the board prior to being com-
pensated. 
This provision will impose on the de-
cisions about the hiring of personnel 
for the restructuring the same require-
ments as are imposed on such per-
sonnel under the existing bankruptcy 
rules. 
Our intention is not to exclude any-
one’s expertise and knowledge of Puer-
to Rico’s fiscal transactions from being 
resources in the restructuring process. 
But I think it is essential that any 
such connection be clear and known, so 
that such persons’ qualifications and 
the role they are going to play can be 
better evaluated. And that has hap-
pened in the past. So I think the result 
of this legislation will clarify that and 
will not allow that to happen again. 
Conflicts of interest or the appearance 
of conflicts of interest can be best 
avoided if there is accountability and 
transparency. 
This bill would require that such per-
sonnel must disclose in detail their 
participation and involvement with 
any entity involved in the issuance of 
Puerto Rico debt and in any claims in-
volving Puerto Rico’s debt, informing 
the identity of each. 
Anyone who is serving on the board 
or working to inform its decisions—and 
I may say the President today an-
nounced three more new members to 
the Oversight Board, so I think the 
time of approving this bill is just accu-
rate—or representing it before the title 
III court, must have the trust of all 
parties that they are committed to de-
fending the interests of the people of 
Puerto Rico to the best of their ability 
in accordance with the law and justice. 
A lack of transparency in these per-
sonnel decisions creates a lack of con-
fidence and distrust. Learning that 
someone used to be involved in the 
businesses of one of the parties in the 
case only after they are named and 
working on that case does not create 
an assurance of their commitment to 
the best interests of Puerto Rico or the 
managing of their debt. 
That is the reason everyone’s ulti-
mate goal must be to reach out and 
reach the day that we no longer need 
the provisions of PROMESA or the Fis-
cal Oversight Board in Puerto Rico, 
and we can dedicate ourselves to re-
build and grow our economy. 
Until that happens, we must demand 
that 
the 
instruments 
created 
by 
PROMESA be accountable and trans-
parent in their processes. Nothing less 
should be acceptable, and that is the 
reason I call upon my colleagues to 
pass H.R. 683. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
couldn’t have said it any better, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 683 closes a loop-
hole under current law by establishing 
disclosure requirements regarding ac-
tual or potential conflicts of interest in 
the Bankruptcy Code process under 
PROMESA. In doing so this legislation 
promotes transparency and account-
ability in the Puerto Rico restruc-
turing process. 
I, again, thank my colleague, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ), the author of this bill, for 
her leadership on this issue, and I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense measure. 
Before closing, since this will likely 
be the final bill within this subcommit-
tee’s jurisdiction considered on the 
floor of this Congress, I want to take a 
moment to recognize the outstanding 
career of the ranking member of the 
subcommittee and my friend, Congress-
man JIM SENSENBRENNER. 
As part of his distinguished career, 
he has left an indelible mark on the Ju-
diciary Committee, on Congress, and 
on our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7011 
December 8, 2020 
We recently celebrated those con-
tributions in a ceremony held by the 
committee. 
Congressman 
SENSENBRENNER
has 
never hesitated to work across party 
lines in service of hardworking Ameri-
cans. As the incoming chairman of the 
subcommittee, I looked to him for 
leadership in the beginning of the Con-
gress. Since then, he has been a tre-
mendous source of advice and wisdom 
over the past 2 years. 
It has been a real pleasure working 
with him this Congress, and I thank 
him for his incredible service and wish 
him well in his retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1645 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 683, The Puer-
to Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclo-
sures Act of 2619. I am thankful for my 
friends, Chairman JERROLD
NADLER, 
the Members serving on the Judiciary 
committee, and the staff who helped 
bring this bipartisan bill to the floor. 
Congress passed the Puerto Rico 
Oversight, Management, and Economic 
Stability Act—or PROMESA—in 2016 
to set up an orderly bankruptcy proc-
ess to restructure its debt, stimulate 
economic development, and put the Is-
land on a path to financial recovery. 
The bill before the House’s consider-
ation today, will close a loophole in the 
Island’s debt restructuring process, im-
prove transparency, and restore con-
fidence in the island’s future. 
While we can have differing opinions 
on how effectively the Oversight Board 
is carrying out its mission, one thing 
should be clear—the island’s residents 
should be entitled to the same rights 
and protections as any debtor on the 
mainland. 
The trust the American people have 
placed in our bankruptcy resolution 
system is based on a fair, efficient, and 
transparent process. Transparency, as 
required by section 327 of Title 11 of 
the United States Code and Rule 2014 of 
Federal Bankruptcy procedure, applies 
to every corporate bankruptcy and en-
sures any conflicts of interest—or even 
the perception of such conflict—be-
tween those working on the bank-
ruptcy and the debtor are disclosed. 
However, PROMESA does not have a 
similar requirement. 
The bill we are bringing to the floor 
today addresses this oversight and ap-
plies a robust disclosure requirement 
to all PROMESA Title III proceedings, 
eliminating the double standard that 
the People of Puerto Rico. Puerto 
Ricans should be confident that the 
Board’s bankruptcy advisors do not 
have their ‘‘thumb on the scale’’ to 
favor certain debts where they have a 
selfinterest. This bipartisan bill en-
sures integrity of the PROMESA proc-
ess. 
The need for PRRADA was articu-
lated in February 2019, when a board- 
appointed law firm investigated poten-
tial conflicts in Puerto Rico’s bank-
ruptcy in response to reports by the 
press about conflicts of interests by 
one of the Board’s consultants. One of 
the main recommendations in the 
‘‘Luskin Report’’ was that vendors 
should disclose affiliate relationships. 
The report found that trading in Puer-
to Rico public debt is particularly 
problematic, as it gives rise to the ap-
pearance of conflict. This is exactly 
what PRRADA would require vendors 
to do—and why we need to pass this 
comprehensive piece of legislation. 
In closing, PRRADA will guarantee 
to the people of Puerto Rico the same 
transparency and disclosure practices 
required by law in U.S. mainland bank-
ruptcies. Tn the interest of fairness for 
Puerto Rico’s people and for impar-
tiality in restructuring—and thereby 
securing—Puerto 
Rico’s 
future, 
we 
must pass H.R. 683 and close this loop-
hole. 
Once more, I would like to thank 
Chairman NADLER, the staff and the bi-
partisan cosponsors of this bill. I 
strongly encourage all members to 
vote ‘‘Yes’’ on this critical piece of leg-
islation. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 683, the ‘‘Puerto 
Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 
2019’’ or ‘‘PRRADA Act,’’ which conditions 
compensation of professional persons retained 
under the congressionally passed ‘‘Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic 
Stability Act’’ (‘‘PROMESA’’) upon the appli-
cant providing certain disclosures similar to 
those required under Bankruptcy Code section 
327. 
In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puer-
to Rico at the time, Congress passed Pub. L. 
114–187, the ‘‘Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, and Economic Stability Act’’ or 
‘‘PROMESA’’ in 2016, legislation I strongly 
supported and cosponsored. 
The Act established the Financial Oversight 
and Management Board (Board), a fiscal con-
trol board comprised of seven members that 
would have control over Puerto Rico’s budget, 
laws, financial plans, and regulations. 
It empowered the board to propose a budg-
et for Puerto Rico and restructure its obliga-
tions owed to bondholders, estimated to be 
$6.5 billion, and other creditors. 
Although largely patterned on chapter 11 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, PROMESA did not in-
corporate all facets of chapter 11 and other 
relevant provisions of the Code. For example, 
although the Board is authorized to retain and 
compensate professional persons in connec-
tion with its efforts to reorganize Puerto Rico, 
PROMESA does not include certain restric-
tions that the Bankruptcy Code requires for 
such purposes. 
For example, Section 327 of the Bankruptcy 
Code, unlike PROMESA, authorizes profes-
sional persons, such as attorneys, financial 
advisors, appraisers, and others, to be re-
tained in connection with the administration of 
a bankruptcy case provided they meet the fol-
lowing conditions: first, such a person must 
not hold or represent an interest adverse to 
the bankruptcy estate; and second, the profes-
sional must be a ‘‘disinterested person.’’ 
As I indicated at the outset, H.R. 683, the 
‘‘Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclo-
sures Act of 2019’’ or ‘‘PRRADA,’’ conditions 
compensation of professional persons retained 
under PROMESA upon the applicant providing 
certain disclosures similar to those required 
under Bankruptcy Code section 327. 
In addition, it would require the United 
States Trustee to review such I disclosures 
and submit comments in response to the court 
as well as authorize the United States trustee 
to object to compensation requested by pro-
fessionals. Further, the measure would apply 
retroactively to professionals who have pre-
viously been awarded compensation. 
Finally, H.R. 683 would authorize the court 
to deny allowance of compensation for serv-
ices and reimbursement of expenses accruing 
after the bill’s enactment date if the profes-
sional person did not comply with the disclo-
sure requirement, was not a disinterested per-
son, or represented or held an interest ad-
verse to the bankruptcy estate. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 683, the ‘‘Puerto Rico Recovery Accu-
racy in Disclosures Act of 2019.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 683, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
COMBAT ONLINE PREDATORS ACT 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill

al, State, and local efforts to enforce laws re-
lating to stalking; and 
(2) identify and describe those elements of 
such efforts that constitute the best prac-
tices for the enforcement of such laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the safety of our chil-
dren is paramount, and the preserva-
tion of their future is critical. 
Across this country and around the 
world, we have awakened to a new nor-
mal where our lives are tethered to the 
internet like never before. The COVID– 
19 pandemic has forced all of us to exe-
cute our daily routines online. 
Children and adolescents across this 
country are engaged in virtual learning 
every day. Therefore, they are spending 
countless hours on the internet. 
While this approach to learning is 
vital in keeping our children safe from 
the spread of the virus, the widespread 
use of the internet and social media 
can make stalking easier to carry out, 
allowing predators to exploit the easy 
access to our children. 
The borderless nature of the internet 
has allowed these types of internet 
crimes 
to 
transcend 
jurisdictional 
boundaries. Current Federal law pro-
hibits narrowly defined instances of 
stalking where they are accomplished 
via interstate travel or through elec-
tronic means. 
This is why we must make sensible 
modifications to the stalking statute, 
especially given that children and ado-
lescents are, in many respects, among 
the most vulnerable of our population. 
Stalking affects millions of men and 
women in the United States. Stalking 
is common. About 1 in 6 women and 1 
in 17 men have experienced stalking in 
their lifetimes. 
Stalking starts early. Nearly 54 per-
cent of female victims and 41 percent 
of male victims experience stalking be-
fore the age of 25 and 16.3 percent of fe-
male victims and 20.5 percent of male 
victims before the age of 18. 
Stalking impacts the physical and 
mental health of victims. Research 
shows that stalking can lead to depres-
sion and post-traumatic stress dis-
order. About 68 percent of female vic-
tims and 78 percent of male victims ex-
perience threats of physical harm dur-
ing their lifetimes. 
I support S. 134, the Combat Online 
Predators Act, because this bill amends 
18 U.S.C. 2261A, which criminalizes 
stalking when a person travels in inter-
state or foreign commerce with the in-
tent to kill, injure, harass, intimidate, 
or place under surveillance with the in-
tent to otherwise kill, injure, harass, 
or intimidate another person. 
This can be even more critical when 
young people are victimized in this 
way, which may occur in person or on-
line, via cellphones, computers, email, 
text messages, and on social media 
platforms, which is sometimes referred 
to as cyberstalking. 
Consequently, this bill is timely be-
cause it increases the maximum prison 
term for a stalking offense by adding 5 
years if the victim is under the age of 
18. The increased maximum penalty for 
this crime when committed against our 
children is reasonable. 
This bill also understands that some 
behavior among young people should 
not be subject to enhancement that 
would apply to individuals who are 
older and more mature. Therefore, this 
bill makes an exception where the en-
hanced penalty shall not apply for the 
person who violates the stalking stat-
ute if the person is under the age of 18 
at the time of the offense, or the vic-
tim of the offense is not less than 15 
nor more than 17 years of age and not 
more than 3 years younger than the 
person who committed the offense at 
the time the offense occurred. 
The bill further requires that the At-
torney General submit to Congress a 
report which shall include an evalua-
tion of Federal, State, Tribal, and 
other local efforts to enforce laws re-
lated to stalking and to identify and 
describe those elements of such efforts 
that constitute the best practices for 
the enforcement of such laws. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a sensible bipar-
tisan bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
134, the Combat Online Predators Act. 
This bill will give law enforcement 
officers additional tools to keep chil-
dren safe from adults who stalk or tar-
get them both in person and online. 
This bill raises the maximum criminal 
penalty for stalking by an additional 5 
years if the victim is a minor. 
In addition, the bill directs the At-
torney General and the Department of 
Justice to produce a report evaluating 
Federal, State, and local laws that re-
late to stalking and to describe best 
practices for enforcing those laws. 
We must do everything in our power 
to protect the most vulnerable among 
us from digital predators. We must en-
sure that courts have the ability to 
sentence convicted stalkers to an ap-
propriate prison term. 
This bipartisan bill will help to pro-
tect our Nation’s children from online 
predators, give their families peace of 
mind, and make our communities 
safer. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK), my 
friend. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Da-
kota (Mr. ARMSTRONG) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as my friend, DAVID 
CICILLINE, just alluded to, we have no 
higher responsibility than to protect 
our children. 
Cyberstalking is a serious crime that 
needs to be met with stricter penalties 
and more cooperation amongst law en-
forcement 
agencies, 
including 
my 
friends and colleagues in my former 
agency, the FBI. 
The Office of Women’s Health defines 
stalking 
as 
repeated 
contact 
that 
makes one feel afraid or harassed. Each 
year, this crime affects an estimated 
7.5 million people, including many chil-
dren. 
Stalking disproportionately impacts 
women. Stalking victims are 50 percent 
more likely to be female, and accord-
ing to the CDC, one in six women has 
experienced some form of stalking in 
their lifetime. 
Mr. Speaker, my Combat Online 
Predators Act ensures that not only 
are we increasing penalties for these 
crimes, but we are also requiring Fed-
eral law enforcement officials to evalu-
ate and update practices to combat 
this online harassment. 
This bill provides enhanced criminal 
penalties for stalkers under title 18, 
section 2261, by up to 5 years if the vic-
tim is a minor. 
Moreover, the legislation calls for 
the Attorney General and the Depart-
ment of Justice to produce an evalua-
tion of Federal, State, and local efforts 
to enforce laws relating to stalking and 
to identify and describe elements of 
these enforcement efforts that con-
stitute best practices across the United 
States. 
Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this legisla-
tion was inspired by the story of a fam-
ily in my district in Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania, the Zezzo family, whose 
teenage daughter, at the age of just 13 
years old, was cyberstalked by a 
friend’s father through social media.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7013 
December 8, 2020 
Despite the stalking being sexual in 
nature, the then 51-year-old stalker 
pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor 
stalking charge and was sentenced to 
probation and counseling. 
Three years later, in 2016, this very 
same stalker began making contact 
again. Hiding behind social media, the 
predator created a perverted library of 
over 15,000 posts detailing his warped 
vision to marry her and his insistence 
that no one could ever stop him from 
being with her. 
Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, following a 
sting operation by our hero law en-
forcement officers, local police ar-
rested him and sentenced him to be-
tween 18 months and 7 years in State 
prison. 
Sitting with the Zezzo family, I saw 
the pain in their eyes. After hearing 
the disturbing story of cyberstalking 
endured by this young girl and her 
family for years, the pain that they 
have endured for years and still endure 
to this day, I knew that something had 
to be done. 
My Combat Online Predators Act is 
the first step in making the internet a 
safer environment for all users, espe-
cially young Americans, and this step 
cannot come soon enough. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CICILLINE 
and members of the committee. I 
thank the Zezzo family, particularly 
Madison and Erin Zezzo, for their advo-
cacy in this incredibly important issue. 
They have turned their unspeakable 
pain into action and provided a voice 
for all cyberstalking victims across 
this country, especially our young vic-
tims and our children. 
We will continue to fight for justice 
for all victims. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Represent-
ative STEPHANIE MURPHY, my partner 
in this legislation, and Senator PAT 
TOOMEY and Senator Bob Casey from 
my home State of Pennsylvania, all of 
whom had a part to play in this. 
Mr. Speaker, we must do everything 
we can to forcefully respond to egre-
gious 
instances 
of 
stalking 
and 
cyberstalking, especially when com-
mitted against the most vulnerable 
among us. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Combat 
Online Predators Act. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), a distin-
guished and respected member of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the manager of the bill for his 
leadership continuously on issues of 
technology as well as his very fine 
work on the issues of antitrust. 
Mr. Speaker, let me thank the man-
ager of this legislation. As well, I 
thank the Senate and the Senate spon-
sor for some very important legisla-
tion. 
It is interesting that we would be 
able to bring this legislation up in a 
time when our children, in particular, 
are wedded to virtual technology or 
virtual learning all over America, leav-
ing them vulnerable in terms of what 
has the opportunity to become a pred-
ator. 
So, I couldn’t think of a more impor-
tant moment to bring up S. 134, the 
Combat Online Predators Act, making 
it very clear the lack of tolerance for 
practices that would create harassment 
of children. 
Clearly, now, with virtual learning 
being at the cornerstone of the survival 
of education for our children with 
COVID–19 raging, it seems an appro-
priate initiative. 
The legislation calls for the Attorney 
General and the Department of Justice 
to produce an evaluation of Federal, 
State, and local efforts to enforce laws 
relating to stalking and to identify and 
describe elements of these efforts that 
constitute best practices. 
Our intent here is to save lives and, 
as well, to protect our children, protect 
their minds, protect their thoughts, 
protect the information that might 
draw them to leave home. We know 
that that certainly has been a basis for 
many of our children running away, be-
cause someone caught them on the 
internet. 
At the same time, Mr. Speaker, I 
want to express my appreciation to the 
United States Senate because this was 
a difficult amendment to be able to 
craft and to understand, and that is 
that we recognize that children can be 
children. 
In essence, this legislation also has, 
for parents to understand, a provision 
that if children are within a certain 
age and the stalker is not much older 
than a child over 15 and under 17 and 
they engage in the kind of play that 
teenagers might engage in—we call it 
Romeo and Juliet—that those individ-
uals would be exempt from the crimi-
nal aspects of this legislation. 
I think it is a very important excep-
tion inasmuch as we want parents to be 
engaged as much as we can in teaching 
teenagers and young people and over-
seeing their activity, making sure they 
don’t do things that would create a 
criminal liability or criminal acts. 
So, I support this legislation because 
of its fairness; because of the recogni-
tion by the Senate of the importance of 
that exemption; and, most of all, to be 
able to make a national statement 
while we are in the midst of COVID–19, 
and our children are facing virtually 
everything, that we want to combat 
online predators. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this act, S. 134, to protect our 
children. 
b 1700 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I think everything 
has been said. Everything now is on-
line, and that is the reason this bill is 
so important as well. That is the rea-
son why I rise in support of S. 134, the 
Combat Online Predators Act. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the House 
companion bill, H.R. 4203, which was 
introduced by my good friends, Rep-
resentatives BRIAN
FITZPATRICK
and 
STEPHANIE MURPHY. 
I think this legislation is straight-
forward. It increased the maximum 
prison term for a stalking offense by 5 
additional years if the victim is under 
age 18. Additionally, the Attorney Gen-
eral must issue a report on the best 
practices for the enforcement of Fed-
eral, State, local, and Tribal stalking 
laws as well. 
According to the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics, during a 12-month period, 
an estimated 14 in every 1,000 persons 
age 18 or older are victims of stalking. 
Overall, 7.5 million people across the 
Nation 
reported 
being 
affected 
by 
these, according to the National Center 
for Victims of Crime and sponsored by 
the Office of Violence Against Women. 
The same study shows 46 percent of 
the stalking victims experienced at 
least one unwanted contact per week, 
and 11 percent of the victims say they 
have been stalked for 5 years or more. 
Approximately one in four stalking 
victims 
reported 
some 
form 
of 
cyberstalking. According to the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics, 83 percent of vic-
tims 
reported 
that 
they 
received 
emails from their stalkers, while 35 
percent reported receiving instant mes-
saging. 
In addition to stalking, every juris-
diction in the U.S. has laws addressing 
electronic harassment, and Federal law 
also criminalizes the use of technology 
in stalking. 
Puerto Rico has recently taken steps 
to enact a special leave policy for those 
who are victims of crimes, such as gen-
der-based crimes, abuse, harassment, 
and felony stalking. The special leave 
law provides up to 15 days annually 
where an employee is able to address 
crimes through legal means to ensure 
that victims are able to seek the prop-
er resources necessary to achieve jus-
tice. 
While Puerto Rico may lead in terms 
of supporting those afflicted by these 
crimes, justice must be severe for those 
who prey on the most vulnerable 
among us. 
Again, 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
Fitzpatrick and Murphy for leading the 
House version of this legislation, and, 
of course, the Senate for passing this 
bill. That is the reason I urge my col-
leagues to support S. 134. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
ARMSTRONG. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
technology has improved our lives in a 
myriad of ways, but it has also given 
bad actors more tools and, in many in-
stances, stalkers can victimize their 
targets without ever leaving their 
home and a victim can often feel like 
they have nowhere to escape. 
I 
applaud 
the 
work 
of 
Senator 
TOOMEY and Congressman FITZPATRICK,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7014 
December 8, 2020 
who sponsored the House companion to 
this bill on this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan measure because stalking is a 
crime in which victims are made to 
live in constant fear. The effects of 
stalking can manifest both physically 
and mentally and have short-term and 
long-term consequences. 
In this digital and technological 
world that we have now all immersed 
ourselves in, it is imperative that we 
remain more vigilant of the nefarious 
activities of those lurking in the shad-
ows to exploit our children’s vulnera-
bilities. 
Hence, I support the Combat Online 
Predators Act and I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 134. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
SERVICEMEMBERS AND VETERANS 
INITIATIVE ACT OF 2020 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8354) to establish the Service-
members and Veterans Initiative with-
in the Civil Rights Division of the De-
partment of Justice, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8354 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This 
Act 
may 
be 
cited 
as 
the 
‘‘Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative 
Act of 2020.’’ 
SEC. 2. SERVICEMEMBERS AND VETERANS INI-
TIATIVE. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established 
the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative 
within the Civil Rights Division of the De-
partment of Justice. 
(b) DUTIES.—The Servicemembers and Vet-
erans Initiative shall— 
(1) serve as legal and policy advisor to the 
Attorney General on the Department of Jus-
tice’s efforts to enforce criminal and civil 
laws that impact servicemembers, veterans, 
and their families; 
(2) develop policy recommendations for the 
Attorney General on how the Department of 
Justice may improve enforcement of Federal 
law to support servicemembers, veterans, 
and their families; 
(3) serve as the liaison and point of contact 
between the Department of Justice and the 
military departments; 
(4) provide counsel to the Assistant Attor-
ney General for the Office of Justice Pro-
grams to ensure funding decisions take into 
account servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families; 
(5) consult with components of the Depart-
ment of Justice to promote the provision of 
civil legal aid to servicemembers, veterans, 
and their families; 
(6) serve as a liaison and point of contact 
with the Consumer Protection Branch of the 
Civil Division of the Department of Justice, 
with respect to the prosecution of Federal 
crimes 
involving 
fraud 
that 
target 
servicemembers; and 
(7) serve as a liaison and point of contact 
with other components of the Department of 
Justice as needed to support the enforcement 
of 
other 
Federal 
laws 
that 
protect 
servicemembers and veterans, as the Attor-
ney General determines appropriate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) and the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of my bill, H.R. 8354, the Serv-
icemembers and Veterans Initiative 
Act of 2020. 
I thank Chairman NADLER
for his 
leadership and support of this impor-
tant legislation, along with my col-
league from Texas, Congressman TAY-
LOR, for leading this bill with me. 
This measure is the result of a truly 
bipartisan effort. My staff also worked 
closely with the committee and incor-
porated feedback from the Department 
of Justice in drafting the text. I am so 
grateful to everyone who made this bill 
better. 
The Servicemembers and Veterans 
Initiative Act establishes in statute 
the Servicemembers and Veterans Ini-
tiative within the Department of Jus-
tice’s Civil Rights Division. The bill 
details the initiative’s responsibilities 
to promote the legal interests of serv-
icemembers, veterans, and their fami-
lies, such as advising the Attorney 
General on efforts to support this popu-
lation; developing policy recommenda-
tions; and serving as the liaison and 
point of contact with other compo-
nents of DOJ to support the enforce-
ment of Federal laws that protect serv-
icemembers and veterans, like coordi-
nating the prosecution of fraud. 
As 
the 
proud 
Representative 
of 
Texas’ 
16th 
Congressional 
District, 
home to Fort Bliss and nearly 50,000 
veterans, I know firsthand the impor-
tance of protecting this population 
with unique needs that necessitate spe-
cialized knowledge of the armed serv-
ices and veterans’ affairs. 
I have learned more about the mili-
tary community through my seat on 
the House Armed Services Committee, 
where I have heard various examples of 
the challenges they face, from finan-
cial scams that unfairly target this 
population to unsafe housing condi-
tions. 
Currently, the Servicemembers and 
Veterans Initiative draws on personnel 
from the Civil Rights Division and the 
Office of Justice Programs to enforce 
civil laws, such as the Uniformed Serv-
ices Employment and Reemployment 
Rights Act, the Uniformed and Over-
seas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 
1986, and the Servicemembers Civil Re-
lief Act, among others, to protect our 
servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families. 
Creating an independent and perma-
nent home for these employees will 
allow them to better protect service-
members and preserve institutional 
knowledge. The bill would also ensure 
that DOJ is coordinating closely with 
the military departments so that serv-
icemembers, veterans, and their fami-
lies are aware of their legal rights and 
available benefits. 
Several veterans service organiza-
tions have endorsed this measure—Par-
alyzed Veterans of America, Student 
Veterans of America, and Veterans 
Education 
Success—recognizing 
the 
significance of having a dedicated focus 
on those who have served our Nation. 
Finally, I am grateful to Senator 
HIRONO for introducing this measure in 
the Senate, and I look forward to work-
ing with her to advance the bill fur-
ther. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8354, codifies the 
DOJ’s Servicemembers and Veterans 
Initiative, the important work that our 
Department does to honor and support 
our Nation’s veterans. 
The initiative coordinates with the 
Civil Rights Division and other Justice 
Department components to enforce 
Federal laws protecting servicemem-
bers, veterans, and their families. 
These laws include the Uniformed 
Service Employment and Reemploy-
ment Rights Act, the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act, and the Uniformed and 
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. 
The DOJ’s enforcement of these laws 
has helped our men and women in uni-
form. For example, the Department re-
ports that enforcement of the Service-
members Civil Relief Act has provided 
more than $474 million in relief for over 
120,000 servicemembers whose rights 
were violated. 
Just last year, Assistant Attorney 
General Eric Dreiband announced the 
largest-ever settlement against a land-
lord or property management company 
for violations of the SCRA. This is im-
portant work that needs to continue. 
During the Trump administration, 
the Justice Department has expanded 
the Servicemembers and Veterans Ini-
tiative by launching the Veterans’ Ac-
cess Initiative. The Veterans’ Access

Initiative 
focuses 
on 
accessibility 
issues for veterans and servicemembers 
under the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. The ADA is an important tool for 
ensuring that those veterans who re-
turn from service with a disability can 
effectively reintegrate into civilian 
life. 
The Servicemembers and Veterans 
Initiative provides resources to the 
public and legal practitioners about 
Federal laws protecting servicemem-
bers, veterans, and their families. The 
initiative also provides support and 
conducts outreach to servicemembers, 
veterans, and their families through 
the military departments. 
This is a good bill to codify an exist-
ing Justice Department program, and I 
encourage all Members to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TAYLOR), my good friend. 
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the legislation that I 
introduced with my colleague and fel-
low Texan from the 16th District, 
VERONICA ESCOBAR, H.R. 8354, the Serv-
icemembers and Veterans Initiative 
Act. 
As a veteran who proudly served our 
country in the U.S. Marine Corps, I 
know how important it is to ensure 
that those who have served in our 
armed services are protected from 
fraud and appropriately represented by 
the Department of Justice. 
We owe a great deal to the coura-
geous men and women who risked their 
lives to keep us free. Just as they have 
fought to keep us safe, we must also 
work here in Congress to protect those 
servicemembers from those who wish 
to do them harm, and that is exactly 
what this bill aims to do. 
H.R. 8354 would formally establish 
the Servicemembers and Veterans Ini-
tiative within the Civil Rights Division 
at the Department of Justice and cod-
ify its role and responsibilities. This of-
fice would be tasked with protecting 
the legal interests of the military and 
veterans community and advise the At-
torney General on how to protect serv-
icemembers and veterans from the 
fraud and predatory schemes that are 
out there. 
Last year, the Federal Trade Com-
mission noticed that U.S. servicemem-
bers are increasingly becoming targets 
of fraud. In fact, our servicemembers 
and our veterans lose more on a dollar 
basis than the civilians who are tar-
geted by similar schemes. This is unac-
ceptable, and we owe it to those who 
serve to prevent this targeted crime. 
The Servicemembers and Veterans 
Initiative at the Department of Justice 
would also play an important role in 
coordinating the prosecution of those 
who commit fraud specifically tar-
geting our Nation’s servicemembers 
and their families. 
This bill is an important step toward 
protecting our Nation’s heroes from 
fraud, and I am proud to stand with my 
colleague, Congresswoman ESCOBAR, in 
support of this bipartisan legislation, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
in support of this important bill. 
b 1715 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I would like to thank my col-
leagues, specifically Mr. TAYLOR for his 
partnership on this very important bill 
and, again, Chairman NADLER and all 
of those, including staff and members 
of the Department of Justice, who 
made this a better bill. 
Our servicemembers and veterans 
have worked tirelessly to protect us at 
home and abroad. It is only right that 
we work as hard as possible to protect 
their rights and shield them from 
abuses such as fraud, predatory lend-
ing, and other victimization. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bipartisan effort to ensure 
the best for our servicemembers, vet-
erans, and their families, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise 
in 
strong 
support 
of 
H.R. 
8354, 
the 
‘‘Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act 
of 2020,’’ which would permanently establish 
the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative 
(SVI) within the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) 
Civil Rights Division. 
I thank my colleague from Texas, Congress-
woman ESCOBAR (TX–16), for introducing this 
important legislation, which I am proud to be 
a cosponsor. 
The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative 
Act details SVI’s responsibilities to promote 
the legal interests of servicemembers, vet-
erans, and their families within the Department 
of Justice. 
Among the responsibilities of the SVI would 
be to make policy on behalf of the Attorney 
General 
on 
legal 
issues 
that 
impact 
servicemembers, veterans, and their families 
and appoint a liaison to the Assistant Attorney 
General for the Criminal Division to coordinate 
Federal prosecutions involving cases of fraud 
against servicemembers. 
SVI currently has no formal statutory author-
ization so assigning a liaison in SVI to coordi-
nate criminal fraud prosecutions is critical to 
protecting servicemembers. 
Civil actions initiated by DOJ have not, thus 
far, stemmed the rising number of fraud 
schemes, in housing in particular, that target 
servicemembers. 
Criminal prosecutions, available under the 
current fraud statutes, would provide a strong 
deterrent to widespread efforts to defraud 
servicemembers. 
By giving SVI a permanent home in DOJ’s 
Civil Rights Division, this bill would ensure that 
DOJ will continue to provide outreach to 
servicemembers, will provide the Attorney 
General with policy recommendations on serv-
icemember-related matters, and will enforce 
the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-
employment Rights Act, the Uniformed and 
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 
1986, and the Servicemembers Civil Relief 
Act, among other laws. 
Mr. Speaker, fraud schemes that target 
servicemembers and their families are espe-
cially pernicious. 
Within just the preceding five years, the 
FTC received over 163,000 reports of fraud 
targeting military retirees and veterans, and 
nearly 13,000 fraud reports from active duty 
service members. 
More shamefully, the FTC ascertained that 
the median loss in these cases was signifi-
cantly higher for servicemembers and vet-
erans than for their civilian counterparts. 
Establishing this direct link to the Criminal 
Division will enable the Justice Department to 
be more effective in addressing civil and crimi-
nal frauds against servicemembers and their 
families. 
A significant number of military veterans live 
in Houston, Texas. 
They are business owners, laborers and 
community servants who continue to con-
tribute to the local economy. 
It is estimated that 18.5 million veterans live 
in the United States, of which 282,511 call 
Houston home. 
In fact, the Houston metropolitan area is 
home to nearly one-fifth of Texas’ veterans. 
Houston-area servicemen and women have 
served in the Gulf wars, the Korean War and 
World War II. 
But the largest percentage of the Houston 
veteran population served in the Vietnam War. 
Most of them are between 35 and 54 years 
old. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in voting 
in favor of H.R. 8354 to provide much needed 
support for our nation’s veterans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
ESCOBAR) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8354, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON) and the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8235, as amended, the Open Courts Act, 
which would require the Federal judici-
ary to allow free public access to court 
records over the internet and mod-
ernize the court records system so that 
it will cost less to maintain and be 
more secure. 
This act is the product of over 5 
years of bipartisan effort, and I am so 
proud that we have gotten the bill to 
this moment. 
I first want to thank the majority 
leader, STENY HOYER, for his involve-
ment and commitment to bringing this 
important legislation to the floor, and 
I would like to thank Director Duff and 
his staff for their recent attention to 
this bill. 
I also want to thank Mr. JORDAN for 
his support for this bill at the commit-
tee’s markup. 
I would be remiss if I did not recog-
nize our partners in the Senate, Sen-
ators PORTMAN and WYDEN, for their 
leadership and commitment to this ef-
fort. 
Finally, I extend sincere appreciation 
to my colleague from Georgia, DOUG 
COLLINS, the colead on this bill. I want 
to thank him for his partnership in 
working to make the Federal court 
records system freely accessible to all 
Americans. 
I would also like to thank Perry 
Apelbaum with the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Jamie Simpson and Matt Rob-
inson of my subcommittee, Jon Ferro 
with Congressman COLLINS’ office, and 
I would also like to give a special 
thanks to Keith Abouchar with Leader 
HOYER’s office for all of his efforts to 
help us be on the floor today with this 
bill. Without everyone’s persistence, 
dedication, and countless hours of hard 
work behind the scenes, we would not 
be here today. 
Mr. Speaker, wealth should not act 
as a barrier to access our courts. 
Whether it is a journalist reporting on 
the courts’ activities or a citizen peti-
tioning the court for redress, access to 
the courts should be free to all, not 
just to those who can afford it. 
Forcing the public to pay for access 
to court records imposes an unneces-
sary and unconscionable burden on 
people who are simply engaging in a 
constitutionally 
protected 
activity. 
Transparency and accessibility should 
be our goal, not profits and limited ac-
cess. 
Court records should be as easy to ac-
cess as legislation is on Congress.gov. 
All you have to do is put in that 
website, go to it, and look at all of the 
legislation that we produce, Mr. Speak-
er, and you should be able to do the 
same thing at the Federal courthouse. 
Our courts are a vital part of Amer-
ica’s government, and we in Congress 
have a responsibility to ensure that 
public records in public courthouses 
are accessible for free to the public. 
This bill provides such protection of 
our most sacred democratic ideals. 
Technology has become essential to 
preserving our First Amendment rights 
by helping to ensure meaningful access 
to justice and to court records. It is 
past time that we bring our Federal 
court records system into the 21st cen-
tury. 
Convenient access to public records 
in public courthouses shouldn’t be a 
privilege for the few who can afford it. 
It is our duty to change the system, 
and that is what this bill does. It fi-
nally makes it fairer for everyone else. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to join us voting on this bi-
partisan piece of legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8235, the Open 
Courts Act of 2020, will modernize the 
judicial branch and bring it sometimes 
kicking and screaming into the 21st 
century. 
First, 
the 
bill 
will 
update 
and 
streamline the Federal judiciary’s case 
management 
system, 
ushering 
in 
much-needed 
improvements 
to 
the 
technological capabilities of the sys-
tem. 
The bill will consolidate the judi-
ciary’s electronic court records system, 
establish certain data standards, and 
require the records system to follow 
those standards. These improvements 
to the case management system will 
increase the efficiency and improve the 
availability of court records to the 
American public. 
Second, the Open Courts Act will re-
quire that Federal court records are 
free and accessible. By ensuring that 
public records are freely accessible, 
this bill will bring increased trans-
parency to our judicial process. 
The reforms contained in the Open 
Courts Act are not new ideas. Advo-
cates of judicial transparency have 
long supported efforts to make court 
records free to the public. The Open 
Courts Act makes long overdue, com-
monsense reforms. This bipartisan leg-
islation will expand the public’s ability 
to not only find court records, but to 
access them as well. 
However, before I conclude my state-
ment, I do want to note one thing. 
While this bill is bipartisan, the text 
was updated late last night. The bill 
now contains an additional eight pages 
and includes various changes to the 
text, specifically regarding redaction 
language of sensitive info. 
I understand why courts don’t nec-
essarily want this burden, and typi-
cally, under current process, filers are 
the ones who do the redactions, but 
now the text seems to be silent on the 
redaction of sensitive information alto-
gether. 
I honestly don’t know where that 
places the current policy, and the rea-
son I don’t know is because we were 
made aware of these changes less than 
24 hours ago. This is not how a bipar-
tisan bill is supposed to proceed, and it 
is a really good way to get a broad bi-
partisan bill to not become law. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD a letter from the Judicial 
Conference of the United States. 
JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF 
THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, December 7, 2020. 
Hon. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. LEADER: I write on behalf of the 
Judicial Conference of the United States, the 
policy-making body of the federal Judiciary, 
to express our continued strong opposition 
to H.R. 8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020 
(‘‘OCA’’), which is scheduled for floor action 
on Tuesday, December 8, 2020. This legisla-
tion—which will take years to implement— 
rushes forward without appropriate and nec-
essary assurances and provisions regarding 
the budget for such an enormous under-
taking. The bill as drafted will have dev-
astating budgetary and operational impact 
on the Judiciary and our ability to serve the 
public. 
We very much appreciate that you, along 
with House Judiciary Courts Subcommittee 
Chairman Hank Johnson, intervened last 
week after my helpful conversation with 
Chairman Johnson to prompt more dialogue 
between the branches. The many hours of 
staff conversations, through the weekend, 
that followed your encouragement led to 
some significant textual changes to the bill. 
We are grateful for those efforts which ad-
dressed some of our concerns with the pre-
vious version of the bill. Very serious con-
cerns remain, however, and further dialogue 
is much needed. 
The fact is that our preliminary estimates 
for the cost of this bill is orders of mag-
nitude higher than the bill’s proponents have 
presumed—currently 
we 
are 
$2 
billion 
apart—and CBO’s hurried and preliminary 
estimates of the cost of developing and im-
plementing a new electronic filing and public

access system, in our view, vastly underesti-
mates the cost of the bill. Critically, some of 
the bill’s revenue streams are also untested, 
difficult to administer and/or impossible to 
estimate reliably in advance. 
In our cost estimates are correct—or even 
marginally closer to correct than the bill’s 
proponents’—there is no scenario in which 
the revenue generated by the bill could be 
sufficient to cover those costs. This will 
force the Judiciary to slash funding for staff 
and other critical operations. Moreover, the 
Judiciary’s backbone case management sys-
tem, and therefore the Judiciary itself, could 
grind to a halt. In anticipation of a funding 
shortfall, the bill now provides for an emer-
gency pause in the transition to the new sys-
tem required by the bill. This might be pref-
erable to the forced accommodation of sig-
nificant unbudgeted costs, but such a pause 
in the middle of a massive transition of sys-
tems would result in its own substantial dis-
ruptions. 
Better information on the costs of this bill 
and the revenues it would generate is needed 
to ensure that the Judiciary and public users 
of 
this 
system 
avoid 
devastating 
con-
sequences. We believe we will have a much 
clearer picture of cost projections in early 
Spring 2021, at the conclusion of the first 
phase of a study for a replacement case man-
agement system to be performed by GSA. 
The Judiciary has other major concerns 
with the bill, including issues of techno-
logical feasibility, security, and governance, 
but the threat of devastating budget con-
sequences for the Third Branch simply can-
not be overemphasized. 
The Judiciary is committed to working 
collaboratively with the next Congress to 
improve our systems for filing, storing, man-
aging, and making available to the public all 
relevant court records. We recognize and 
share Congress’ bipartisan interest in a mod-
ern, effective, fair and successfully funded 
system. The current version of the Open 
Courts Act, however, is not the way to ac-
complish those goals. We look forward to 
working through these shared goals with you 
in the future. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES C. DUFF, 
Secretary. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, let me first 
just acknowledge the well-intentioned 
goals of this legislation and my col-
leagues from Georgia in a bipartisan 
way working together. I applaud their 
efforts to attempt to modernize the ju-
dicial branch and make judicial records 
more accessible to the American peo-
ple. Nevertheless, I regrettably rise 
with reservations, as a former practi-
tioner in Federal court, regarding H.R. 
8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020. 
According to the Judicial Conference 
of the United States, the bill, as draft-
ed, would have devastating budgetary 
and operational impacts on the judi-
ciary’s ability to serve the public. Cur-
rent estimates for the cost of the bill 
from the Judicial Conference are cur-
rently $2 billion apart from the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s preliminary 
estimates of the cost to develop and 
implement a new electronic filing and 
public access system. 
Should these cost estimates be cor-
rect, there is no scenario in which the 
revenue generated by the bill would 
cover costs, forcing the judiciary to 
slash funding for staff and other crit-
ical operations. This bill has a $2 bil-
lion price tag, and the entire budget of 
the Federal judiciary is only $8 billion, 
annually. 
Additionally, despite the bill’s cap on 
increases to filing fees, it authorizes 
the judiciary to raise filing fees if the 
other revenue sources in the bill prove 
insufficient to cover costs. 
I know my colleagues do not want to 
deny access to the Federal courts. Ulti-
mately, this bill does not resolve some 
of the judiciary’s most fundamental 
concerns, and, as a result, I regrettably 
urge my colleagues to consider these 
issues and the bill’s impact on the judi-
ciary. 
I know the Judicial Conference is 
willing to work with Congress to re-
solve some of these outstanding issues 
and to get at the sponsors’ goals— 
which are very laudable, indeed—and 
that is to modernize the judicial 
branch and to make judicial records 
more accessible to the American peo-
ple. 
I will say that, under current law, 
low-income 
Americans 
can 
access 
many of these records without cost, 
and the vast majority of those organi-
zations and individuals that are paying 
for these records and underwriting the 
costs are institutions that have the 
means to do so. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to consider these issues and the 
bill’s potential impact on the judici-
ary, and I encourage my colleagues on 
the other side of the Capitol to work 
with the Judicial Conference to resolve 
these outstanding concerns. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the com-
ments of my friend. 
This has been a 5-year, bipartisan ef-
fort that only recently yielded the abil-
ity of the Judicial Conference, through 
the Administrative Office, to actually 
come to the table and talk to Congress 
to try to work out their concerns. 
After about a week of lots of con-
versation, hours upon hours of con-
versation, dialogue, and negotiations, 
we came up with an amended bill. Then 
at the very last minute, today, the Ju-
dicial Conference issues a letter citing 
a preposterous figure—$2 billion—for 
this system, which is not attached to 
any realistic cost estimate whatsoever. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the CBO’s, Congressional Budget Of-
fice’s, estimate of the cost of the Open 
Courts Act to put in a new system that 
is more secure and more user friendly 
than the one that is in place right now. 
CBO ESTIMATE
OF
THE STATUTORY PAY-AS- 
YOU-GO EFFECTS
OF H.R. 8235, THE OPEN 
COURTS ACT
OF 2020, AS POSTED
ON
THE 
WEBSITE OF THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE ON 
DECEMBER 8, 2020 
Estimates relative to CBO’s March 2020 
baseline. Components may not sum to totals 
because of rounding. 
H.R. 8235 would require the Administrative 
Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC), 
working in coordination with the General 
Services Administration, to develop and im-
plement a modernized software system to 
manage the electronic records of the court. 
The legislation would require that public 
court records be accessible to the public, and 
would authorize the AOUSC to impose new 
fees—particularly on high-volume, for-profit 
users—to cover the costs of developing and 
maintaining the new system. 
If enacted, CBO expects those fees would 
generate $47 million in additional revenue 
over the 2021–2030 period, mostly from high- 
volume users of the system. CBO believes 
that the new fees should be recorded in the 
budget as revenues, because they are new 
and an exercise of the government’s sov-
ereign power over the federal judiciary. 
Those revenues would be offset by a decline 
in other revenues of approximately 22 per-
cent to account for indirect tax effects. As a 
result, CBO estimates that the legislation 
would increase net revenues by $37 million 
over that period. 
Under the bill, the additional revenue 
would be deposited in the Judiciary Informa-
tion Technology Fund, and the AOUSC 
would be authorized to spend those fees with-
out further appropriation. As a result, CBO 
estimates H.R. 8235 would increase direct 
spending by $46 million over the 2021–2030 pe-
riod. CBO expects that most of those costs 
would be incurred during the 2021–2025 period 
as major work on software development is 
completed and the system is deployed across 
the federal judiciary. 
On net, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 
8235 would increase the deficit by $9 million 
over the 2021–2030 period. 
If enacted, H.R. 8235 also would affect 
spending subject to appropriation by the 
AOUSC; CBO has not completed an estimate 
of that effect. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. It is a 
state-of-the-art, 21st century system as 
opposed to a 1985 system, one that will 
cost, in the CBO’s assessment, about 
$46 million over 10 years. 
That is a drastic difference than a $2 
billion cost estimate submitted at the 
last minute to confuse and try to derail 
passage of this very commonsense, nec-
essary legislation that brings judicial 
records into the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1730 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, with 
all of the concerns that exist, I think 
the goal of transparency and cost effec-
tiveness are still worthy of this, and I 
urge support of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8235 is a bill that 
will make a meaningful difference in 
the accessibility and transparency of 
an entire branch of the Federal Gov-
ernment. It vindicates our critical 
First Amendment rights and it will es-
tablish a level playing field for access 
to critical government documents. For 
those reasons, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to com-
mend Chairmen JERRY
NADLER
and HANK

bers JIM JORDAN and MARTHA ROBEY, Director

to develop and improve this important legisla-
tion. A number of improvements have been 
made over the last several days to the Open 
Courts Act as reported out of the Judiciary 
Committee by voice vote in September. This 
bill would mandate the development of a mod-
ern public records access system that would 
also relieve the general public, small law firms, 
and other modest users of having to pay fees 
to access public documents filed in federal 
courts. Among other priorities, the bill would 
provide for the adoption of a progressive fee 
schedule applying to aggregators and large 
law firms, which are the biggest consumers of 
public court records and use these materials 
for profit-seeking ends. 
I recognize the press of other business may 
prevent this bill from being enacted before the 
end of this Congress. Whatever course awaits 
the Open Courts Act after today’s passage, I 
look forward to continuing working with all the 
parties to react to any new information that we 
may receive and continue refining the bill in 
mutual discussions. 
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the Judicial 
Conference of the United States voicing their 
opposition and concerns to H.R. 8235, the 
Open Courts Act of 2020. 
JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF 
THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, December 7, 2020. 
Hon. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC.

Sincerely, 
JAMES C. DUFF, 
Secretary. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 8235, the ‘‘Open 
Courts Act of 2020,’’ which would centralize 
and modernize the federal judiciary’s court 
records systems (called CM/ECF) and would 
eliminate the paywall (called PACER) that cur-
rently forces the public to pay to access these 
records. 
The new system will provide a centralized, 
easily searchable site to file and read court 
records and monitor docket activity, and 
equally important, make all public court 
records on the site available free of charge. 
Every year, the public pays the federal judi-
ciary more than $100 million in fees so they 
can read the motions, briefs, orders, exhibits, 
calendar entries, and other court filings that 
make up the overwhelming majority of federal 
litigation and bankruptcy practice. 
These fees are used to maintain and oper-
ate the judiciary’s electronic court records sys-
tems (called ‘‘case management and elec-
tronic court filing systems’’ or ‘‘CM/ECF’’) that 
judges, court employees, and the parties be-
fore the court use to file documents, issue de-
cisions, and generally manage proceedings. 
Although many parties before the court pay 
a fee to initiate a proceeding or otherwise file 
a document (generally called ‘‘filing fees’’), 
these fees do not support the electronic courts 
records systems they rely on. 
Instead, those systems are subsidized by 
the public. 
The fees the public pays to view federal 
court records are officially called ‘‘electronic 
public access’’ or ‘‘EPA’’ fees. 
More commonly, they are called ‘‘PACER’’ 
fees, after the paywall system the public must 
use to pay for and access those records. 
The Public Access to Court Electronic 
Records (PACER) system charges users 10 
cents per page to view, download, or search 
for public court records. 
The per-document fee is capped at $3.00; 
audio files of court hearings, if they exist, cost 
$2,40. 
Judicial opinions are free, as are the first 
$30 of charges per quarter. 
As several retired judges have argued, 
‘‘openness serves a structural role in our re-
publican system of self-government’’ and that 
‘‘opening up judicial records by removing the 
PACER paywall would be consistent with the 
best traditions of judicial transparency.’’ 
PACER functions as a paywall that the pub-
lic must pass through to access the judiciary’s 
electronic court records systems. 
These systems are highly decentralized— 
every one of the 94 district courts, 13 courts 
of appeals, and 90 bankruptcy courts have 
their own CM/ECF system. 
Until recently, for example, a user was re-
quired to have a separate username and 
password for every CM/ECF system—today, 
some, but not all, courts allow a user to have 
the same password and username. 
Seamus Hughes, the Deputy Director of 
George Washington University’s Program on 
Extremism, has spent years researching ter-
rorism cases in the United States, Europe, 
and in the Middle East. As he researches indi-
viduals and entities charged with providing 
material support to foreign and domestic ter-
rorist organizations. 
As part of those investigations, he devel-
oped expertise in searching the federal court 
records system and in testimony last year, de-
scribed the consequences of this set up: 
Quite simply, it is not easy to access public 
court records on PACER. PACER provides ac-
cess to federal criminal records and is orga-
nized by federal districts in each state . . . To 
use the system you need to apply for a 
PACER account, get a password, and know 
what district in each state you want to search. 
Each search requires the user to know what 
they are looking for and where. Even then the 
cost is not always tied to a result. 
For example, if you are a terrorism re-
searcher and want to review every case that 
charges material support to a terrorist organi-
zation, you would have to go to 94 different in-
dividual court websites and conduct a new 
and separate search on each website. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition, some public court 
records, including trial exhibits and unsealed 
documents, are routinely unavailable because 
they are not posted on a court’s CM/ECF sys-
tem, and documents are difficult to find be-
cause there are no uniform tags or naming 
conventions. 
Mr. Speaker, the Open Courts Act of 2020 
addresses these problems and helps ensure 
that the public and free access to the Amer-
ican judicial system remains available. 
Section 2(a) of the bill requires the Director 
of the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts to, in coordination with the Ad-
ministrator of General Services, consolidate all 
federal court records into one system within 
2–3 years. 
Section 3(a) requires the Director of the Ad-
ministrative Office of the United States Courts 
to, in coordination with the Administrator of 
General Services, make all court records on 
the system established by section 2 freely 
available to the public. 
Section 3(b) grants authority to the Judicial 
Conference to designate, after notice and

comment, certain categories of records that 
will be subject to up to a 5-day delay before 
they are made publicly accessible. 
Any such designation must be no broader 
than necessary and be based on a determina-
tion of a specific and substantial interest in re-
stricting the public right of access to court 
records. Any designation expires after 3 years 
unless renewed via notice and comment. 
Section 3(c) requires the Director of the Ad-
ministrative Office of the United States Courts, 
in coordination with the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services, to ensure that the public can 
search for and access court records, similar to 
the requirements under Section 2 of this act. 
Finally, section 3(d) establishes the dates 
when all PACER fees must be eliminated and 
court records are made freely available to the 
public within two years from enactment unless 
the Director of General Services certifies that 
an additional year is needed. 
This is needed legislation and I support it. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 8235, the ‘‘Open Courts Act of 2020.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHN-
SON) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8235, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two-

IDENTIFYING OUTPUTS OF GEN-
ERATIVE 
ADVERSARIAL 
NET-
WORKS ACT 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent to take from the Speak-
er’s table the bill (S. 2904) to direct the 
Director of the National Science Foun-
dation to support research on the out-
puts that may be generated by genera-
tive adversarial networks, otherwise 
known as deepfakes, and other com-
parable techniques that may be devel-
oped in the future, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PAPPAS). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from New 
York? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2904 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Identifying 
Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks 
Act’’ or the ‘‘IOGAN Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Gaps currently exist on the underlying 
research needed to develop tools that detect 
videos, audio files, or photos that have ma-
nipulated or synthesized content, including 
those generated by generative adversarial 
networks. Research on digital forensics is 
also needed to identify, preserve, recover, 
and analyze the provenance of digital arti-
facts. 
(2) The National Science Foundation’s 
focus to support research in artificial intel-
ligence through computer and information 
science and engineering, cognitive science 
and psychology, economics and game theory, 
control theory, linguistics, mathematics, 
and philosophy, is building a better under-
standing of how new technologies are shap-
ing the society and economy of the United 
States. 
(3) The National Science Foundation has 
identified the ‘‘10 Big Ideas for NSF Future 
Investment’’ including ‘‘Harnessing the Data 
Revolution’’ and the ‘‘Future of Work at the 
Human-Technology Frontier’’, with artifi-
cial intelligence is a critical component. 
(4) The outputs generated by generative 
adversarial networks should be included 
under the umbrella of research described in

paragraph (3) given the grave national secu-
rity and societal impact potential of such 
networks. 
(5) Generative adversarial networks are 
not likely to be utilized as the sole technique 
of artificial intelligence or machine learning 
capable of creating credible deepfakes. Other 
techniques may be developed in the future to 
produce similar outputs. 
SEC. 3. NSF SUPPORT OF RESEARCH ON MANIPU-
LATED OR SYNTHESIZED CONTENT 
AND INFORMATION SECURITY. 
The Director of the National Science Foun-
dation, in consultation with other relevant 
Federal agencies, shall support merit-re-
viewed and competitively awarded research 
on manipulated or synthesized content and 
information authenticity, which may in-
clude— 
(1) fundamental research on digital foren-
sic tools or other technologies for verifying 
the authenticity of information and detec-
tion of manipulated or synthesized content, 
including content generated by generative 
adversarial networks; 
(2) fundamental research on technical tools 
for identifying manipulated or synthesized 
content, such as watermarking systems for 
generated media; 
(3) social and behavioral research related 
to manipulated or synthesized content, in-
cluding human engagement with the con-
tent; 
(4) research on public understanding and 
awareness of manipulated and synthesized 
content, including research on best practices 
for educating the public to discern authen-

DEFINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘generative adver-
sarial network’’ means, with respect to arti-
ficial intelligence, the machine learning 
process of attempting to cause a generator 
artificial neural network (referred to in this 
paragraph as the ‘‘generator’’ and a discrimi-
nator artificial neural network (referred to 
in this paragraph as a ‘‘discriminator’’) to 
compete against each other to become more 
accurate in their function and outputs, 
through which the generator and discrimi-
nator create a feedback loop, causing the 
generator to produce increasingly higher- 
quality artificial outputs and the discrimi-
nator to increasingly improve in detecting 
such artificial outputs. 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, was read the third time, 
and passed, and a motion to reconsider 
was laid on the table.

tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1250 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE NA-
TIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The House of Representa-
tives finds the following: 
(1) In general, artificial intelligence is the 
ability of a computer system to solve prob-
lems and to perform tasks that would other-
wise require human intelligence. 
(2) Artificial intelligence will transform 
the nature of work and nearly all aspects of 
the United States economy. 
(3) Artificial intelligence will have im-
mense implications for the security of the 
United States and its allies and partners. 
(4) Investments made by the United States 
Government will be instrumental in the re-
search and development of artificial intel-
ligence and artificial intelligence-enabling 
technologies, as it has been for many of the 
world’s revolutionary technologies. 
(5) Developing and using artificial intel-
ligence in ways that are ethical, reduce bias, 
promote fairness, and protect privacy is es-
sential for fostering a positive effect on soci-
ety consistent with core United States val-
ues. 
(6) The Obama Administration released the 
Big Data Research and Development Initia-
tive in 2012, Executive Order 13702 (relating 
to creating a national strategic computing 
initiative) in 2015, and the National Artifi-
cial Intelligence Research and Development 
Strategic Plan in 2016. 
(7) The Trump Administration released Ex-
ecutive Order 13859 (relating to maintaining 
American 
leadership 
in 
artificial 
intel-
ligence), updated the National Artificial In-
telligence Research and Development Stra-
tegic Plan in 2019, and released Office of 
Management and Budget guidance for regu-
lation of artificial intelligence applications 
in 2020. 
(8) In May 2019, the Organisation for Eco-
nomic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development 
(OECD) adopted the OECD Principles on Ar-
tificial Intelligence, which included the prin-
ciples of inclusive growth, sustainable devel-
opment and well-being, human-centered val-
ues 
and 
fairness, 
transparency 
and 
explainability, robustness, security and safe-
ty, and accountability. 
(9) In February 2020, the European Com-
mission began a consultation process with 
the release of their white paper ‘‘On Artifi-
cial Intelligence - A European approach to 
excellence and trust’’, which set out policy 
options for a coordinated European approach 
to artificial intelligence regulation. 
(10) In June 2020, the G7 and several part-
ners launched the Global Partnership on Ar-
tificial Intelligence to increase cooperation 
focused around the areas of responsible arti-
ficial intelligence, data governance, the fu-
ture of work, and innovation and commer-
cialization. 
(11) Several United States allies, including 
Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, 
Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea, 
have published national artificial intel-
ligence strategies with detailed funding com-
mitments. 
(12) In 2017, China published a national ar-
tificial intelligence strategy that detailed 
the Chinese Communist Party’s goal to be-
come the world’s primary artificial intel-
ligence innovation center by 2030. 
(13) In 2019, Russia published a national ar-
tificial intelligence strategy and, in 2017, 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that 
‘‘whoever becomes the leader in this sphere 
will become the ruler of the world’’. 
(14) In 2018, the Subcommittee on Informa-
tion Technology of the Committee on Over-
sight and Government Reform of the House 
of Representatives, under the leadership of 
Chairman Will Hurd and Ranking Member 
Robin Kelly, published ‘‘Rise of the Ma-
chines: Artificial Intelligence and its Grow-
ing Impact on U.S. Policy’’ following a series 
of hearings on artificial intelligence with ex-
perts from academia, industry, and govern-
ment, concluding that ‘‘the United States 
cannot maintain its global leadership in ar-
tificial intelligence absent political leader-
ship 
from 
Congress 
and 
the 
Executive 
Branch’’. 
(15) Congress serves a critical role in estab-
lishing national priorities, funding scientific 
research 
and 
development, 
supporting

tives that the United States should take a 
global leadership role in artificial intel-
ligence. 
SEC. 3. WORKFORCE PREPARATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The House of Representa-
tives finds the following: 
(1) Artificial intelligence and automation 
will present significant challenges to work-
ers in affected industries due to the auto-
mating of some routine and repetitive tasks, 
but will also create additional employment 
opportunities. 
(2) Closing the artificial intelligence talent 
gap in the short and medium-term will re-
quire a targeted approach to identifying and 
filling roles that require the skills to build 
and work with artificial intelligence sys-
tems. 
(3) The United States should take a leader-
ship role in the artificial intelligence-driven 
economy by filling the artificial intelligence 
talent gap and preparing United States 
workers for the jobs of the future, including 
by prioritizing inclusivity and equal oppor-
tunity. 
(4) Departments and agencies of the Fed-
eral Government are increasingly using data 
to administer benefits, assess outcomes, and 
fulfill other mission-critical activities. 
(5) Effectively creating, managing, and im-
plementing artificial intelligence related re-
search and development grants will require 
technical expertise. 
(6) Departments and agencies of the Fed-
eral Government will need to be able to re-
cruit employees with technical expertise. 
(7) Lifelong learning and skill acquisition 
can increase flexibility with respect to ca-
reer opportunities.

respect to under-represented communities 
and marginalized groups in the Federal 
workforce should be reviewed for the purpose 
of determining if such policies require modi-
fication for technology workers. 
(3) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the Federal 
Government should assess the effectiveness 
of current public workforce development 
programs with respect to the additional sup-
port such programs will need to effectively 
address job disruptions and job creations 
that result from the increased use of artifi-
cial intelligence. 
(B) WORK-BASED LEARNING AND ON-THE-JOB 
TRAINING PROGRAMS.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the Federal 
Government should support the adoption of 
work-based learning and on-the-job training 
programs to prepare the United States work-
force for an artificial intelligence-influenced 
economy, including by— 
(i) undertaking studies to determine best 
practices to implement such programs; and 
(ii) ensuring that there is sufficient Fed-
eral funding to support high-quality pro-
grams that coordinate with Federal work-
force development programs. 
(4) FEDERAL
HIRING
PRACTICES.—It is the 
sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Federal Government should— 
(A) allow technical experts to use their 
skills to assist multiple departments and 
agencies of the Federal Government, such as 
the United States Digital Service; 
(B) focus on the retention of non-partisan 
experts within the Federal Government who 
are working to modernize Federal informa-
tion technology; 
(C) include in the criteria for recruiting for 
artificial intelligence jobs the consideration 
of a multi-disciplinary set of skills, includ-
ing an understanding of ethical practices 
with respect to the design and use of artifi-
cial intelligence systems, privacy, informa-
tion security, law, and civil liberties; 
(D) review hiring practices for employment 
in the Federal Government for the purpose of 
ensuring that such practices do not dis-
qualify individuals with a less traditional 
background, including due to a lack of un-
dergraduate or graduate degree attainment, 
who have skills that will benefit work in ar-
tificial intelligence systems management 
and research and development; and 
(E) conduct studies with respect to best 
practices for skills-based hiring.

ity of the military to ethically use artificial 
intelligence and that human operators in 
human-machine teams trust the artificial in-
telligence will be critical factors with re-
spect to the successful implementation of ar-
tificial intelligence systems. 
(4) The continued proliferation of national 
artificial 
intelligence 
strategies, 
plans, 
statements, and investments demonstrates 
the increase in global competition in this 
area. 
(5) New paradigms will be required to effec-
tively test artificial intelligence and to en-
sure that it is reliable and stable. 
(6) Export and investment controls will be 
important policy tools to prevent the acqui-
sition of sensitive artificial intelligence and 
artificial intelligence-enabling technologies, 
including hardware such as semiconductors 
and semiconductor manufacturing equip-
ment, by China, Russia, and other adver-
saries. 
(b) MATTERS TO CONSIDER.— 
(1) COLLABORATION WITH FOREIGN NATIONS.— 
It is the sense of the House of Representa-
tives that the United States should— 
(A) leverage its alliances to promote demo-
cratic principles, foster research collabora-
tion, and develop common standards with re-
spect to artificial intelligence; 
(B) promote the interoperability of artifi-
cial intelligence for the purpose of strength-
ening alliances;

develop best practices for testing, evalua-
tion, validation, and verification of artificial 
intelligence systems; 
(B) devote agency resources, including in-
vesting in research, for the purpose of pro-
moting trustworthiness with respect to 
human-machine teams; 
(C) engage with experts to develop guide-
lines for the ethical development and use of 
artificial intelligence systems; and 
(D) prioritize the development of artificial 
intelligence systems to cover non-critical 
tasks until such systems can achieve suit-
able 
standards 
of 
reliability, 
interoper-
ability, and security. 
(4) EXPORT AND INVESTMENT CONTROLS.—It 
is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that the United States should collaborate 
with its allies to prevent the misuse of artifi-
cial intelligence systems by China, Russia, 
and other adversaries.

cause United States economic competitive-
ness and national security will depend on 
strong capabilities across a range of tech-
nologies. 
(5) 
Computing 
power 
is 
essential 
to 
progress in artificial intelligence develop-
ment, and the amount of computing power 
required for artificial intelligence training 
runs is increasing exponentially. 
(6) A new wave of technological advances 
could be fostered by combining and increas-
ing access to government-owned and govern-
ment-funded computing and data resources. 
(7) Expanding access to digital infrastruc-
ture, such as broadband, will be essential to 
creating new job opportunities and stimu-
lating the growth of new technology and in-
novation clusters to support United States 
leadership in artificial intelligence. 
(8) Incentivizing research and development 
across the private sector, particularly from 
smaller companies, will further strengthen 
the United States innovation ecosystem. 
(9) The United States is an attractive re-
search and development partner because it is 
home to world-class universities, research 
institutes, and corporations. 
(10) Decades of experience show that joint 
work with foreign researchers can be done 
with great benefit and little detriment to 
United States economic and national secu-
rity with the implementation of proper safe-
guards. 
(11) Artificial intelligence standards and 
measurement are essential to fostering arti-
ficial intelligence technologies that are safe, 
secure, reliable, and comport with the norms 
and values of the United States. 
(12) Metrics are how the artificial intel-
ligence research community guides itself and 
prioritizes research. 
(13) Benchmark tests are necessary to un-
derstand the performance of an artificial in-
telligence system. 
(14) Current tests for measuring artificial 
intelligence range from vague and concep-
tual to well-defined and mature. 
(15) Artificial intelligence measurement 
methodologies are not static and will require 
periodic reexaminations and updates of test-
ing methodologies to ensure that artificial 
intelligence systems are functioning accord-
ing to best-known practices. 
(16) United States leadership in global arti-
ficial intelligence standards-setting will help 
ensure that artificial intelligence implemen-
tations are in accordance with United States 
strengths and comport with the interests and 
values of the United States. 
(17) Public engagement is necessary for de-
veloping 
voluntary 
consensus 
standards, 
guidelines, and frameworks to ensure diverse 
perspectives are considered. 
(b) MATTERS TO CONSIDER.— 
(1) FEDERAL FUNDING.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the Federal 
Government should increase investments in 
artificial intelligence research and develop-
ment and related fields. 
(2) COLLABORATION WITH OTHER ENTITIES.— 
It is the sense of the House of Representa-
tives that departments and agencies of the 
Federal Government should collaborate— 
(A) with the private sector, civil society, 
and academia— 
(i) to ensure that the United States inno-
vation ecosystem leads the world in artifi-
cial intelligence research and development; 
and 
(ii) to develop voluntary consensus stand-
ards, guidelines, and frameworks that will 
help create shared conceptual foundations, 
terminology, and best practices for artificial 
intelligence fairness and bias mitigation; 
and 
(B) with science funding organizations in 
like-minded countries to establish multilat-
eral teams of artificial intelligence research-
ers from the public and private sectors to 
promote additional talent development and 
foster partnerships on artificial intelligence 
research and development.

DIGITAL
ACCESS.—It is the 
sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Federal Government should— 
(A) expand access to broadband in rural 
and underserved areas; 
(B) expand the availability of affordable 
graphics processing units and high-perform-
ance computers in rural and underserved 
areas; 
(C) improve digital infrastructure in the 
United States; and 
(D) make data created by federally-funded 
scientific and technical research publicly 
available with appropriate privacy protec-
tions to provide artificial intelligence re-
searchers with new data sets to train their 
systems. 
(4) NATIONAL
COMPUTING
AND
DATA
RE-
SOURCE.—It is the sense of the House of Rep-
resentatives that Congress should consider 
establishing a national computing and data 
resource. 
(5) ACCESS TO NATIONAL LABORATORIES.—It 
is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that the existing supercomputing labs at the 
national laboratories and technology centers 
of the Department of Energy should expand 
opportunities for academics and researchers 
to access such labs for artificial intelligence 
research and research related to artificial in-
telligence. 
(6) TAX INCENTIVES.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that Congress 
should examine whether targeted incentives 
and reforms to the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 would increase private sector research 
and development, particularly with respect 
to small cap corporations. 
SEC. 6. ETHICS, REDUCED BIAS, FAIRNESS, AND 
PRIVACY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The House of Representa-
tives finds the following: 
(1) The rise of artificial intelligence has 
great potential to improve quality of life for 
individuals in the United States, provided it 
is developed and used in a manner that is 
ethical, reduces bias, promotes fairness, and 
protects privacy. 
(2) A diverse artificial intelligence work-
force is important for mitigating bias. 
(3) The United States is uniquely posi-
tioned to leverage its diverse workforce to 
lead in artificial intelligence. 
(4) The starting point for Federal oversight 
of artificial intelligence should be to review 
existing regulatory frameworks. 
(5) Regulatory sandboxes, in general, refer 
to regulatory structures where a participant 
obtains limited or temporary access to a 
market in exchange for reduced regulatory 
uncertainty, and can be used to test a prod-
uct designed to mitigate unintended bias or 
promote fairness in a small-scale environ-
ment and under the supervision of regu-
lators. 
(6) Federal programs should have necessary 
safeguards and oversight processes. 
(7) Artificial intelligence regulatory ap-
proaches should consider the level of risk as-
sociated with different artificial intelligence 
applications. 
(b) MATTERS TO CONSIDER.— 
(1) BIAS MITIGATION.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that departments 
and agencies of the Federal Government 
should— 
(A) support technical and non-technical re-
search and development to address potential 
bias, fairness, and privacy issues in artificial 
intelligence; 
(B) improve access to a broad range of non- 
sensitive government data assets to help 
train artificial intelligence systems; 
(C) implement title II of the Foundations 
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–435; 132 Stat. 5529); 
(D) develop policies to identify the data 
used to train artificial intelligence algo-
rithms as well as data analyzed by artificial 
intelligence algorithms and systems in use 
by departments and agencies; and 
(E) further develop and release to the pub-
lic available benchmark data assets with the 
proper safeguards to protect privacy, miti-
gate bias, and promote inclusivity. 
(2) REGULATION AND LEGISLATION REVIEW.— 
It is the sense of the House of Representa-
tives 
that 
congressional 
committees 
should— 
(A) review the range of existing Federal 
regulations and laws that potentially apply 
to artificial intelligence; 
(B) determine which laws apply to artifi-
cial intelligence; 
(C) determine if any gaps in appropriate 
legislation and regulation exist and how 
such gaps could be addressed; 
(D) advance Federal privacy reforms that 
build trust, prevent harm, and maintain 
United States global leadership in artificial 
intelligence; and 
(E) conduct regular oversight of artificial 
intelligence policies in the executive branch 
within their jurisdiction. 
(3) FEDERAL FUNDING.—It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that Congress 
should support funding for departments and 
agencies of the Federal Government inter-
ested in adopting programs, including regu-
latory sandboxes, for the purposes of testing 
artificial intelligence tools in limited mar-
kets. 
The resolution was agreed to.

AT&T, he joined then-Congressman MARSHA 
BLACKBURN’s office. When I was elected to 
Congress, he agreed to postpone retirement 
to continue serving our district for two more 
years. 
Johnny has been the invaluable link be-
tween the work we do in congress and the 
local communities in the district by being a re-
source for constituents and community leaders 
and listening to the concerns and challenges 
facing rural Tennesseans. 
Johnny understands the challenges of our 
community leaders because he himself has 
been one throughout his life. For 24 years, he 
served on the McNairy County Board of Edu-
cation, including 17 years as chairman. During 
this time, the Board of Education oversaw two 
multi-million-dollar building projects in the 
county. In 1992, he was selected to serve on 
the All Tennessee School Board. Johnny also 
served as Vice Mayor of his beloved home-
town, Ramer. 
Johnny and Linda, his ceaselessly charming 
wife of 56 years, have three children—Ross, 
Lora, and Jeremy—and seven grandchildren. 
Johnny has always sought to put his family 
first and he is proud of everything that his chil-
dren and grandchildren have accomplished. 
He and his family are longtime members of 
Ramer Baptist Church, where he has served 
many years as an Ordained Deacon, Music 
Director, and Sunday School Teacher. 
Johnny has done an outstanding job serving 
the people of Tennessee and this nation 
through his volunteer work and his profes-
sional career of public service, and it has been 
an honor and a privilege to have him as a 
member of my staff. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives, I’m proud to congratulate 
Johnny Blakely on his retirement and to ex-
press our gratitude for his lifelong commitment 
to his community and his 18 years of faithful 
and diligent service to the people of Ten-
nessee’s Seventh Congressional District.

CRITICAL WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
passage of the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act of 2020, as amended by the 
Senate, marks a new chapter for a crit-
ical infrastructure project that is very 
important to the residents of Penn-
sylvania’s 12th Congressional District. 
The Williamsport levee, located in 
Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, in 
the heart of PA–12, is in dire need of re-
pair to protect the livelihoods of local 
residents and businesses. 
The flood zone behind the 20-mile 
levee system is responsible for nearly 
87 percent of Lycoming County’s eco-
nomic activity. This area employs 
more than half of the region’s work-
force and is home to 24 of the county’s 
50 largest employers. 
This bill authorizes the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers to carry out a feasi-
bility study of the imminent threat the 
levee poses to Lycoming County’s resi-
dents and economy. This study is a pre-
cursor to construction and funding for 
the levee and represents an important 
step toward addressing this critical in-
frastructure need. 
I will continue to do everything in 
my power to work with the Army Corps 
of Engineers to prioritize this project. 
Today, we take an important step for-
ward in our community’s collective ef-
fort to get this infrastructure project 
across the finish line, and for that, I 
am grateful.

RECOGNIZING THE LOSS OF BRIG-
ADIER GENERAL CHUCK YEAGER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great sadness that I rise to recog-
nize the loss of a very great American, 
Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, who 
passed last evening. He and his wife, 
Victoria, are constituents of ours in 
Nevada County in our district in north-
ern California. 
Truly, he was an American icon. He 
inspired the world to push farther and 
faster and to push the envelope, as 
they say, a man I was honored to call 
a friend. 
He grew up in West Virginia, a coun-
try boy hunting and fishing the hills 
where he lived. He entered World War 
II and became one of the greatest pilots 
that we would know. He had an amaz-
ing 20/10 vision that helped him to see 
enemy aircraft sooner than the rest of 
his colleagues or the enemy could see 
ours. 
His exploits in the sky continued 
after World War II, when he was the 
first man to break the sound barrier in 
his Bell X–1 aircraft. 
Indeed, he was an amazing gen-
tleman. He was a determined man with 
a lot of grit, provided a lot of help ad-
vancing the aviation situation in this 
country, even just a few years ago, ex-
ceeding the sound barrier once again. 
He had a straight and dry sense of 
humor. He didn’t have a whole lot of 
use for politicians. I was lucky to be 
able to count him as a friend, not as a 
politician but as more of a neighbor. 
We will grieve this man and we will 
grieve his loss, because they don’t 
make very many like Chuck Yeager. 
Indeed, he will be irreplaceable. 
God bless him and his family.

FAREWELL TO CONGRESSWOMAN 
ROBY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we will, in 
short time, remember our friend Paul 
Sarbanes, but another friend of mine, 
whom I have not known as long but I 
have known well, is the gentlewoman 
from 
Montgomery, 
Alabama, 
with 
whom I went on the pilgrimage spon-
sored by Faith and Politics and led by 
our beloved John Lewis. She welcomed 
us so graciously to Montgomery. 
She is a graduate of NYU, a graduate 
of Stanford Law School, and is extraor-
dinarily proud of her father, the chief 
judge of the court of appeals of their 
circuit. Her husband, Riley, and their 
two children I have known, and they 
have joined us. 
Regrettably, she will be leaving the 
Congress at the end of this year. I say 
regrettably because she was a Member 
of Congress who worked across the 
aisle and who worked positively and 
constructively on behalf of her district, 
on behalf of her State, and on behalf of 
her country. We will miss her. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Alabama. 
b 1915 
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
my friend, for yielding. 
Thank you so much, Leader HOYER, I 
just appreciate your friendship all 
these years. I really do appreciate the 
time you have given me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise before you and my 
colleagues here today to speak for my 
final time on the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, my hus-
band, Riley, and I prayerfully decided I 
would put my name on the ballot for 
the first time. Never could we have 
imagined that that original decision to 
run for the Montgomery City Council 
would lead us to serve five terms in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. 
We are so grateful that God allowed 
us to serve our country in this way, 
and we give all honor and glory to Him. 
I count it a great privilege to have 
served the people of Alabama’s Second 
Congressional District over the past 
decade, and I cannot adequately ex-
press how deeply thankful I am for the 
confidence 
my 
constituents 
have 
placed in me over the years. 
Each of you sitting here before me 
knows the responsibility that comes 
along with being a Member of Con-
gress. Yes, we are required to vote and 
to be the conscience of those we rep-
resent, but serving our constituents 
back home truly changes lives in our 
communities for the better. 
As I look back on the wonderful 
things Team Roby was able to accom-
plish, along with the help of my col-
leagues in the Alabama delegation, I 
realized that our most significant duty 
is to help those who need us. Whether 
it is requesting assistance with the VA 
or another Federal agency, assisting 
with cleanup following a large-scale 
weather event, voicing an opinion, or 
booking tours of the U.S. Capitol, my 
doors have always remained open to 
each person I represent. 
I am thankful for the unique oppor-
tunities given to me by those who 
came before me, especially the chance 
to serve on several impactful commit-
tees, including Committee on Appro-
priations, Committee on the Judiciary, 
Committee on Agriculture, Committee 
on Armed Services, Committee on Edu-
cation and the Workforce, and the Se-
lect Committee on Benghazi. Much

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7027 
December 8, 2020 
work has been done in each of these re-
vered committees to impact the lives 
of my constituents, and for that, I am 
forever grateful. 
I have been asked many times over 
the past few months what will I miss 
the most upon my departure, and my 
answer has remained the same—the re-
lationships. 
The genuine friendships formed with 
my colleagues, my constituents, and so 
many others over the years, and inter-
acting with these individuals on a daily 
basis is what I will truly miss the 
most. For many, this past year was and 
continues to be very challenging. We 
have all experienced plenty of unfa-
miliar hardships. Not only has the 
global health pandemic taken center 
stage, but America is marked by in-
tense division and polarization. Every 
time you turn on the television, you 
see a depiction of disunity amongst the 
American people. I imagine many 
Americans struggle to believe that 
friendship can actually exist within the 
Halls of Congress. 
It is incumbent upon us, Members of 
Congress, to join forces and work to-
gether to get things done for the good 
of the American people. When we reach 
across the aisle and work with the 
other side to arrive at a compromise 
for the benefit of those we serve, we are 
truly at our best. I believe the Amer-
ican people are starving to see biparti-
sanship in action, especially during 
this time of much suffering and uncer-
tainty. People want to know their lead-
ers are working together for the com-
mon good and not just shouting each 
other down. 
My greatest hope and prayer moving 
forward is that all Members of Con-
gress—new and old—regardless of party 
identification, beliefs, or opinions, will 
come together and work toward a com-
mon goal to deliver real results for the 
American people. I have faith in this 
institution, and I have faith in each of 
you. 
Now, I want to especially thank the 
people of the Second District. It is your 
faith and trust in me as your rep-
resentative that helped me every step 
of the way. I am honored to have been 
given this incredibly unique oppor-
tunity, and I thank you for letting me 
be your voice in Congress. 
Together, we have been able to de-
liver some incredible results for our 
military, veterans, agricultural com-
munity, and the unborn. While we 
made much progress together, the fight 
is not finished. 
I want to thank my Congressional 
colleagues 
for 
your 
kindness 
and 
friendship throughout the years. Not 
too far into my time in Congress, I 
woke up realizing that the people I 
served with had become some of my 
very best friends. I am confident these 
relationships will continue, and I will 
certainly miss our time spent together 
having conversations about our fami-
lies and encouraging one another. 
I want to thank my incredible staff, 
all former and present Members of 
Team Roby, for your hard work on be-
half of the people of Alabama and our 
country. I know all Members say this, 
but I truly believe I have the greatest 
staff in the world. I would never be able 
to execute this job without the dedica-
tion and support of my staff. They have 
worked tirelessly to serve the people of 
the Second District. We have a special 
saying on our team: ‘‘Once Team Roby, 
always Team Roby.’’ 
And lastly, I thank my husband, 
Riley, and our two children, Margaret 
and George, my parents, the Robys, 
and our entire village for supporting 
our decision to serve our country. Your 
steadfast love and constant support 
have carried us through the easy and 
the hard times, and I love each of you 
dearly. 
On behalf of Riley, Margaret, George, 
and myself, we sincerely thank all of 
you who made our service to our coun-
try in the great State of Alabama pos-
sible and those who offered their serv-
ices along the way. 
Thank you, and for the very last 
time, I yield back. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I know 
that I speak for every Member of the 
House, particularly those of us who 
have had the privilege of knowing MAR-
THA ROBY well and spending time with 
her, she is a decent and good represent-
ative. She is a wonderful representa-
tive of her State, and she has made this 
House a little better, and this country 
a little better, and we thank her for 
her service. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR PAUL 
SARBANES 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we were 
saddened to learn the other night when 
JOHN called me and told me that his fa-
ther had passed away. JOHN SARBANES, 
of course, is our colleague. He told me 
of the passing of a wonderful human 
being, with a great intellect, a wonder-
ful wit, a sense of decency, great integ-
rity and a sense of country, Paul Sar-
banes. 
He was a gifted legislator, a wise ad-
viser to all who sought his council. He 
brought great courage to his efforts for 
the people and great compassion for all 
who struggled to survive and succeed 
in their pursuit of happiness. I know 
that all of us serving in this House ex-
presses our heartfelt condolences to his 
entire family, including his son, our 
colleague, JOHN
SARBANES, a son of 
whom his father was extraordinarily 
proud. 
I went with JOHN to see his dad not 
so long ago, and I was so glad I took 
the opportunity when I was in Balti-
more to see him. A number of us had a 
wonderful opportunity to serve with 
Senator Sarbanes in the Congress. I 
had the privilege of serving with him 
for 4 years in the Maryland General As-
sembly and for 30 years in the Congress 
of the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, my friendship with Paul 
went back to the time when we were 
elected to the Maryland General As-
sembly in the same freshman class of 
1966, before you were born, or close. 
Paul was elected to the House, and I 
was elected to the State Senate. Over 
the years, we came to look differently 
at which body was more important. He 
originally served in the House in Mary-
land, and I served in the Senate. We 
changed our perspective on which was 
the most important body. 
Serving together in the Maryland 
Congressional Delegation, we contin-
ued our partnership working for the 
people of our State and standing up for 
the principles we shared. And Paul was, 
at his core, a man of principle. Raised 
with the ethics of his immigrant par-
ents, the foundation of his Greek Or-
thodox faith, and the values of his Bal-
timore neighborhood. 
Paul believed his first responsibility 
as a legislator was to ensure that gov-
ernment was always accountable to the 
people it served. He never wavered in 
that mission. When he saw evidence of 
the destruction of justice by President 
Nixon, he was the first to file Articles 
of Impeachment. 
In the Senate, he was an architect of 
what is now known as the Sarbanes- 
Oxley Act, which sought to protect in-
vestors from fraud in our financial 
markets, and to protect consumers as 
well. 
Transparency, 
accountability, 
and ethics were the watchwords of Paul 
Sarbanes. 
He was also a champion for a cleaner 
and healthier Chesapeake Bay. He un-
derstood that the bay is one of Mary-
land’s and America’s greatest treasures 
and most extraordinary asset. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to partner 
with him on efforts to protect the bay, 
as well as on so many other issues im-
portant to our State, including robust 
investment in education, protecting 
and enhancing civil rights, and making 
quality healthcare more affordable and 
accessible. 
Paul Sarbanes will be remembered as 
a man of substance and principle, of de-
cency and warmth, of insight and vi-
sion. He left an indelible mark on this 
institution in which he served, and on 
the millions of people in Maryland and 
across our country, whose lives he en-
riched. 
As dean of the Maryland Delegation, 
it is my honor to open this hour of trib-
ute and to yield to my friend and col-
league, his son, of whom, as I said, he 
was so very proud, and we share his fa-
ther’s pride in his service in this insti-
tution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES). 
Mr. 
SARBANES. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the majority leader for yielding. 
I thank you for your friendship with 
my father, Paul Sarbanes, for so many 
years. You go back with him a long 
way, and he cherished that friendship, 
as he did the relationship with all the 
members of the Maryland Delegation 
during the time that he served. 
I thank my colleagues here tonight 
who have come to help remember him 
and pay tribute. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my brother, 
Michael, and my sister, Janet, I thank

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7028 
December 8, 2020 
all the people who, over the last 48 
hours, have been sending in these re-
membrances and tributes to my father 
from his time in the Senate, and before 
that, here in the House where he was 
for 6 years, and for time periods before 
that, even. 
I want to thank right up front, and in 
particular, his staff, who over the 
course of his 40 years in public service 
he understood were the ones that made 
him or broke him. He was a tough 
taskmaster, but he chose people that 
had that same set of principles and val-
ues and commitment to hard work. A 
lot of the tributes that have been com-
ing in have talked about him being a 
workhorse, not a show horse. The idea 
that you put your head down, you get 
the job done, you try to build con-
sensus where you can, but you always 
remember that you are here for a rea-
son, that is to make good, strong pol-
icy that can help people. 
He lived a full life, he made a dif-
ference in the lives of others, which is 
all he ever wanted to do. He knew he 
wanted to be in politics from a very 
early age, but his motivation was in 
looking at the opportunities that he 
had, the son of Greek immigrants who 
came to this country with very little, 
and he had the opportunity for edu-
cation and advancement. His motiva-
tion was to make those available to 
others. 
He loved being with people. He had a 
dry sense of humor. He enjoyed ban-
tering with all who crossed his path, 
was intensely interested in the journey 
that others had taken to whatever sta-
tion they held in life. And he was al-
ways asking: ‘‘Where are you from?’’ 
‘‘What do you do?’’ ‘‘What is next for 
you?’’ 
He had an inherent integrity that 
was strengthened by always striving to 
meet the expectations of those who put 
their confidence in him. 
In politics, he was motivated, as I 
said, by the burning conviction that 
every individual has dignity and the 
potential to succeed if given a fair 
shot, and he was determined others 
would have those same opportunities 
that he had enjoyed. 
b 1930 
He understood that if you share the 
credit, if you don’t seek credit, you get 
a lot more done. That was how he oper-
ated. 
A few years ago, I prevailed upon him 
to sit for about 20 hours of videotaped 
oral history because I wanted to make 
sure we captured the essence of his life 
and his career. So, we have this treas-
ure, which we will make available to 
people as we move forward. I wanted, 
in his own words, to grab a few ex-
cerpts from that, that I think convey 
who he is and what he cared about. 
I remember I came home one time, 
and he was sitting in the living room 
on the couch, and he was revved up 
about something. I don’t know what 
the issue was that day that had gotten 
him sort of motivated. But he banged 
on the side of the couch, and he said: ‘‘I 
am for the little guy. I am for the little 
guy.’’ He might as well, in that mo-
ment, have been stating his purpose in 
public life. That is what motivated him 
from the moment he got up in the 
morning until the moment he went to 
bed at night. 
I am going to read a couple of these 
things from his oral history. He talked 
about getting public housing, senior 
citizen affordable housing, in the Inner 
Harbor in Baltimore. He was very 
proud of the fact that you had this sen-
ior citizen housing there. 
He said: ‘‘Next door to it is an expen-
sive hotel, and behind the hotel is a big 
condominium building with very ex-
pensive condominiums in it. Every 
time I go by that building, I get a sense 
of satisfaction out of it, particularly in 
the nice weather. I look up, and all of 
these seniors are sitting out on their 
terraces, looking out over the water. 
‘‘I know the developers would give 
their eyeteeth to get ahold of that 
piece of property, but they don’t have 
it. It is part of this affordable housing 
initiative, so a lot of seniors who 
worked hard all their lives and are now 
retired but don’t have a lot of money 
have the benefit of this housing.’’ 
He said: ‘‘I always get a measure of 
satisfaction out of that.’’ 
We are in the midst, as we know, in 
our country of some really challenging 
moments addressing issues of justice. 
Here is a story about how my father, in 
a small way, made a statement around 
justice. 
He said: ‘‘We had a situation in one 
of the rural towns on the Eastern 
Shore, and when they delivered the 
mail, the postman, he would come 
down the street here, and there would 
be these big houses, and he would go up 
to the house and put the mail in the 
mailbox. And then as he moved on 
down the street, the composition of the 
neighborhood would change, and the 
houses would get smaller, much small-
er. 
‘‘The complexion of the people living 
in the houses changed, too, as you went 
down the street, so they went from 
White to Black. And down the street, 
instead of the postman going through 
the gate or whatever and up to the 
house, they were going to require those 
people to put a postbox at the street. 
So, some people came to us about that, 
a couple of pastors or ministers, and 
they pointed out this situation. 
‘‘So, I got the postal people in for a 
meeting in my office,’’ my father said. 
‘‘’Now, what is happening here? As I 
understand it, up here with the big 
houses and the White residents, you 
are going to continue to go up to the 
house and put the mail through the 
door slot. But when you get down this 
way to the little houses and the Afri-
can-American residents, you are going 
to require them to put a mail recep-
tacle out at the pavement or at the 
curb, and you are not going to go up to 
the house anymore. What is the ration-
ale for this policy?’ 
‘‘Well, of course, if you lay it out like 
that, there isn’t a rationale, at least 
not an acceptable one that can with-
stand the light of day. So, they dropped 
the project and went on delivering the 
mail.’’ 
Here is what my father said: ‘‘That is 
the way it ought to work. And I felt it 
is not a big issue, but we got some jus-
tice done for those people.’’ 
Small things that stand for big prin-
ciples, that is what he was about. 
I am going to close with just a couple 
of final thoughts here. First of all, I 
want to thank the Greek-American 
community, which was fiercely proud 
of my father’s achievements. He was 
deeply proud of where he came from. It 
was an inspiration to him in public 
service. I want to thank so many who 
helped him along the way from that 
community. 
My mother, Christine, who died 10 
years ago, she came into his life like a 
bolt of lightning. He didn’t know what 
hit him. He met her at Oxford, this 
brilliant, beautiful woman who could 
match him step for step in her intel-
lect, and she knocked his socks off. 
I think the great regret of his life 
was that he had hoped in his retire-
ment—you know, public life is hard. 
We know that. I think all along the 
way, he was looking forward to that 
time when the two of them could spend 
more time together. Unfortunately, she 
passed away within a couple of years of 
his retirement, and they didn’t get 
that opportunity together. I don’t 
think he ever fully recovered from 
that. 
I think about his legacy, and I under-
stand, certainly, that there is no way 
his children—myself; my brother, Mi-
chael; and my sister, Janet—are ever 
going to match that legacy because it 
is a pretty unmatchable one when you 
look at the record. But I think we are 
all doing what we can to continue it, to 
nurture it, to sustain it going forward. 
Again, I thank you for the time to 
speak here, and I thank my colleagues 
for all of your support and kind words 
over the last couple of days. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the son of a great man, who that great 
man would say is a great son. He loved 
JOHN, but he respected JOHN. He be-
lieved that JOHN was enhancing the 
Sarbanes legacy, and he was right. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time, with the expectation that 
Mr. TRONE from our State will con-
tinue to recognize other Members from 
our delegation who want to speak.

December 8, 2020 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Senator Paul Sarbanes, a titan of 
Maryland politics and a man I consid-
ered a mentor during my time as Balti-
more County Executive. 
JOHN, those were very warm com-
ments that you gave about your father, 
to be here as a Member of Congress and 
to make those comments. I know your 
father is looking down and is very 
proud of you and his whole family. It is 
a moment that we will never forget. 
Anyone who values government ac-
countability and integrity, anyone who 
loves or lives off of the Chesapeake 
Bay, is benefiting from the service of 
Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
Though his legislative style was 
often described as quiet and unassum-
ing, the accomplishments of Senator 
SARBANES
were 
bold 
and 
groundbreaking. He will go down as 
one of the Chesapeake Bay’s fiercest 
stewards in history. 
In the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, he 
pioneered legislation that continues to 
protect consumers today. From Water-
gate to Iran-Contra to Whitewater, he 
fought government corruption. He was 
a man of integrity and decency. 
He didn’t have a soapbox. He had 
sense. He led with respect, not rhet-
oric. 
Over the course of his three decades 
of public service, Senator SARBANES 
showed us what we can achieve when 
taking credit just isn’t a priority. 
Today, we celebrate the legacy Sen-
ator SARBANES has left for our future 
generations. 
I know Senator Sarbanes was very 
proud of his son JOHN’s work here in 
the United States Congress and also his 
son Michael’s work on behalf of the 
Baltimore City Schools and his daugh-
ter, Janet Sarbanes, who is an accom-
plished writer. 
We will always remember Senator 
SARBANES. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, let me just start by saying, John, I 
always believed that you can tell a lot 
about a person by the children they 
raise. If I knew nothing else about your 
father than what I see in you, I know 
your father is a great man because you 
yourself are a great man. While you 
may think that you will never match 
your father’s accomplishments, he be-
lieved and already knew that you have. 
I was in many public events in the 
presence of you and your father, and I 
would watch him as he was watching 
you. It was so clear and obvious the 
pride that he took in you, as I know he 
did in his other children, knowing that 
you were stepping in his footsteps, con-
tinuing his legacy and his work for the 
people of Maryland. 
So, 
JOHN, 
you 
have 
more 
than 
matched the matchless efforts of your 
father. 
I want to recognize Leader HOYER for 
hosting this Special Order hour this 
evening. I want to, again, thank my 
friend and colleague, Representative 
JOHN SARBANES, and his entire family, 
who have experienced a great loss. 
Over his extraordinary life, Paul Sar-
banes held many titles: husband and fa-
ther, Maryland delegate, Congressman, 
Senator, chairman. 
Throughout his decades on Capitol 
Hill, Paul Sarbanes never lost sight 
that he was a family man first. Second 
only to that, he was a true and dedi-
cated public servant. 
Senator Sarbanes worked for Mary-
land. He was a tireless advocate for our 
State and the many families who call 
Maryland home. They knew Paul Sar-
banes had their backs. Upon news of 
his death, so many of his constituents 
fondly remembered how he was there 
for him and provided a helping hand. 
Paul Sarbanes didn’t approach serv-
ice with bravado and bombast. He 
didn’t crave the spotlight because he 
understood the people he served were 
in his spotlight because they were his 
priority. 
He was a master legislator and deft 
committee questioner. Senator SAR-
BANES actively shaped legislation that 
still affects Marylanders and Ameri-
cans today. 
He championed the restoration of our 
beloved Chesapeake Bay. He put con-
sumer protections front and center in 
his work, cracking down on corporate 
fraud. He held Presidents accountable 
during the Watergate hearings and 
throughout his career. His work and re-
lationships on the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee helped create a 
safer world. 
The example he set continues to in-
spire so many leaders and public serv-
ants in Maryland to put the work and 
the people first. 
I first met Paul Sarbanes when I 
moved to Maryland in 1992. I attended 
one of his townhalls he had at Prince 
George’s Community College. I knew 
nothing of the Senator at the time, and 
I listened to him address the concerns 
and the issues of my neighbors, his 
constituents. 
While Paul Sarbanes was not nec-
essarily 
known 
for 
or 
recognized 
among his many accomplishments for 
leading in the areas of national secu-
rity and military issues—although he 
was on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee and very effective—what I 
saw in him was a profound appreciation 
for the men and women who served in 
uniform. He had great respect for those 
men and women who took that uniform 
off and continued as veterans to make 
a contribution to our community. 
That was my first impression and the 
most lasting impression that I had of 
Paul Sarbanes. He loved the men and 
women who served this country, and he 
deeply respected their service, even 
when they took off the uniform. 
Senator Sarbanes was understated, 
and that was by design. But his work, 
life, and legacy speak for themselves. 
To JOHN, Michael, Janet, and the en-
tire Sarbanes family, I send my deepest 
condolences for your loss. My prayers 
are with you, as we remember your fa-
ther, this remarkable man and public 
servant, Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
b 1945 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. TRONE for yielding, and I want to 
thank our distinguished majority lead-
er for sponsoring this special hour de-
voted to honoring the great Senator 
Sarbanes. 
Along with Senator MIKULSKI, Sen-
ator SARBANES was the first Senator I 
ever had. And because he served for 30 
years in office, he was actually my 
Senator for most of my life already. He 
will always be, in my mind, the image 
of what a Senator is: someone of im-
mense 
erudition, 
character, 
intel-
ligence, and commitment. 
But I got to know him primarily as 
the father of my friend and now my 
colleague, JOHN
SARBANES, whom I 
have known since law school, and, 
therefore, I have known him for most 
of my life as well. 
I can feel the tremors and the shock 
of this enormous loss for the people of 
Maryland. I feel deeply for my friend 
JOHN and for Dina, and for everyone in 
the Sarbanes family. 
I see a lot of his father in JOHN SAR-
BANES, just to echo what Congressman 
BROWN just said. Paul Sarbanes was a 
family man who loved, deeply, his chil-
dren, JOHN, Michael, and Janet, and his 
big brood of grandchildren. Nothing 
brought that famous twinkle to his eye 
more than being in the presence of his 
beloved kids and grandkids. And, of 
course, the love story between him and 
Christine is legendary in our State. 
Paul Sarbanes was a man of exquisite 
character who loved public things. He 
loved public schools, public univer-
sities, public parks. He loved public 
museums. He loved the res publica, the 
public thing, and he thought that there 
was no greater honor than in being a 
public servant. 
I remember he once came out and 
spoke at an event that I had in Mont-
gomery County, and he said—it really 
stuck with me. He said, there are many 
public goods that we try to protect— 
clean air, clean water, a beautiful bay, 
good schools, smooth roads—but we 
should never forget perhaps the great-
est public good: the good of being well- 
governed. This is what allows us to 
sleep at night. 
And he showed us every day in his ca-
reer in public life the difference be-
tween being a public servant who in-
stills justice in our institutions and 
being one who goes out to exploit pub-
lic office for private gain. Those are 
simply in two different galaxies of 
human experience. 
He showed us that those of us who as-
pire and attain the public office are 
nothing but the servants of the people 
in a democracy. We are here only to 
serve the people and the common good

the very best that we can. And the mo-
ment that we begin to act like the 
masters of the people rather than the 
servants of the people, that is the mo-
ment to evict and eject and reject and 
impeach and remove. 
Indeed, of the many extraordinary 
moments in Senator Sarbanes’ career, 
we should never forget that he was the 
first one to introduce Articles of Im-
peachment against Richard Nixon dur-
ing the Watergate affair. 
Even in the age of celebrity and the 
lifestyles of the rich and famous that 
he came to inhabit, an age of vast eco-
nomic inequality and adoration of 
wealth, Senator Sarbanes knew what 
true wealth is, and he knew what it 
meant to truly be happy. 
He loved the Greek philosophers, of 
course, and as a Greek-American phi-
losopher himself, he showed us the 
meaning of what a lot of the Greeks 
tried to demonstrate in their writings. 
He was always the poorest Member of 
the U.S. Senate in financial terms—no-
body even came close, if I remember 
correctly. Not only did he not trade in 
the stock market on a daily basis, I 
don’t even think he ever invested in 
the stock market. He had a savings ac-
count. 
Now, I am recalling this from mem-
ory. Perhaps he did end up with a mu-
tual fund or something. 
I know that he was recorded, in term 
after term, the poorest Member of the 
Senate, financially. But Senator Sar-
banes knew what true wealth is: a Sun-
day night family dinner, the love of 
your children, friendships that last 
over decades across the centuries, the 
merriment of little children, the thrill 
of being able to deliver a Social Secu-
rity check or a VA check to someone 
who couldn’t get it, showing respect for 
elders, teaching young people the value 
of education and hard work, having a 
wife who is your life partner and your 
soulmate and your equal in all things. 
A man of extraordinary character 
and integrity who was interested in not 
what was popular, but what was right, 
Paul Sarbanes, to me, embodied a cer-
tain kind of politician. 
When I first got into politics, I quick-
ly recognized two different kinds of 
politicians. There were justice politi-
cians and there were power politicians, 
and Paul Sarbanes, to me, epitomized 
what it meant to be a justice politi-
cian. 
We, in Maryland, have suffered a 
great loss with the passing of Senator 
Sarbanes, but he has instilled in his 
family and in his staff and in everyone 
who learned from him a love for public 
things, and we can continue the pas-
sionate mission that he had in his life. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. TRONE, and I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to be able to join this Special 
Order on behalf of the late Senator 
Paul Sarbanes. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank 
JOHN SARBANES, our distinguished col-
league from Maryland, for being here, 
for accepting our joint and individual 
condolences over the last several days, 
and for being so very, very much like 
his father. 
I also want to extend that same 
thanks to Michael Sarbanes and to 
their sister, Janet, and to the larger 
Sarbanes family of in-laws, many of 
whom we have not met, all of whom 
share in this hour of this overwhelming 
sense of loss. It is loss both for the 
family and, obviously, I hope we would 
agree, for the entire Nation, regardless 
of what side of that aisle that we sit or 
stand on. 
I first came to know, if I may use 
that term, Paul Sarbanes in May of 
1974, when, as a student of political 
science, I devoured every opportunity I 
could to watch political proceedings. 
And I remember the assignment that 
we got that May: to make sure that we 
watched, understood, and learned from 
what was then the impending impeach-
ment 
proceedings 
against 
Richard 
Milhous Nixon. 
So on a small, fuzzy TV, I got intro-
duced to Paul Sarbanes. And along 
with him, I got introduced that month 
to Peter Rodino of New Jersey, the 
chair of the Judiciary Committee, and 
to Larry Hogan, Senior, the only Re-
publican to vote for all Articles of Im-
peachment. 
I was just struck by the fact that no 
matter how much I had heard or be-
lieved or given into the fact that poli-
tics was just posturing and that politi-
cians would say anything and do any-
thing in order to secure a vote, I saw 
three men that day, led by Paul Sar-
banes, who exemplified, to me at least, 
the highest ideals of moral character 
that I had seen coming out of Wash-
ington—or any other chamber—because 
of the way they conducted themselves, 
but more importantly, because of the 
principles that they held onto, that in 
many instances could, in fact, and 
might, indeed, cost them votes. 
But they believed, nonetheless, that 
the sacred oath of office that we all 
took when we came to this Chamber, or 
when others have gone to the Senate, 
must be something that we abide by. 
And so I got a special sense of pride 
when I realized that not only was this 
Paul Sarbanes, this dashing young man 
who was absolutely brilliant on details, 
not only was he saying and doing and 
representing all of us, I thought, in the 
best way possible, he was also from the 
State of Maryland, which gave me 
extra pride and extra pause. 
I said to myself, if I were to ever be 
elected to the office, that is the stand-
ard that I should subscribe to, that is 
the standard that I should emulate, 
and that is the standard that I think 
all of us benefit from, a standard be-
queathed by Paul Sarbanes and others 
that is just as important today as it 
was that hot day in May of 1974. 
And so while the House has a sense of 
loss because of Paul’s time here and his 
work with so many of us, because the 
Senate has that same sense of loss, I 
would dare suggest that in Annapolis, 
Maryland, that the State legislature 
feels that same way for the many days 
that he walked those halls and the 
many 
bills 
that 
he 
helped 
usher 
through them. 
We all think about Sarbanes-Oxley, 
but Paul Sarbanes, lest it ever be mis-
understood, fought like crazy to ex-
pand affordable housing and to sta-
bilize Social Security and Medicaid 
trust funds and Medicare trust funds. 
He fought, as John mentioned earlier, 
for the little things that may escape 
many of us, that we might feel that we 
are too big or too proud to do, just the 
notion of making sure that people got 
the same mail delivery on a block who 
happened to be Black and who hap-
pened to be citizens. 
So there are a lot of things that can 
and will be said, I think and I know, 
about Paul and his life and what he 
stood for and what he believed in. Let 
me say a couple of others. 
Paul Sarbanes had a good heart. He 
loved Christine. Whenever I saw him, I 
saw her. And I said to him once: Paul, 
isn’t Christine tired of you dragging 
her out to this dinner and to this event 
and to this speaking engagement? 
He said: No, she is actually dragging 
me out, because there are some times 
when I don’t want to go out. 
But he had a very, very good heart, 
and they represented just the best of 
matrimony. 
I sent a text to John an hour after I 
learned of the passing of his dad, and I 
said, among other things: John, you 
and your sisters won the parents 
sweepstakes. You just had great par-
ents, great role models, who were great 
Americans. 
So Shakespeare said of that kind of 
good heart long, long ago, something 
that he took to pen with, he said that 
a good heart is like the Sun and the 
Moon, for it shines bright; it never 
changes because it keeps its course. 
Paul Sarbanes kept his course. He 
was unawed by opinion, unseduced by 
flattery, and undismayed by disaster. 
He instinctively knew that America 
was not like a blanket: one size, one 
shape, one texture, or one color; but, 
rather, and instead, he realized that 
the America that we all love is so 
much more like a quilt: different 
shapes, different sizes, different tex-
tures, and different colors, all woven 
and held together by a single precious 
thread of democracy. 
Paul has taught us so much, and as 
students who followed him, worked 
with him, believed with him, loved 
him, and now miss him, we could never 
be more thankful. 
b 2000 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank the majority leader for orga-
nizing this Special Order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7031 
December 8, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak for Sen-
ator Sarbanes’ employees, and espe-
cially for my sister-in-law Nellie Free-
man, who worked for Paul Sarbanes for 
17 years, from December of 1989 to Jan-
uary of 2007. 
I am not going to talk about all the 
amazing things about Senator Sar-
banes that his Maryland colleagues 
have eloquently mentioned. JOHN, I am 
definitely not going to talk about fa-
thers and sons because then I will start 
crying, but my dad, Sandy Levin, who 
served in this House for 36 years, and 
my Uncle Carl Levin, who served for 36 
years in the Senate, many of them 
with Senator Sarbanes, both loved him 
very much. 
But let me talk about Nellie and, by 
extension, his broader staff. Nellie 
loved serving in the Senate on the 
staff, and she loved the Senator. That 
is what she called him, ‘‘the Senator.’’ 
And JOHN SARBANES saw Nellie Free-
man for who she was. He saw her talent 
and he unleashed her to interact with 
the people of Maryland, of which she 
was a native, to organize events, to or-
ganize his participation in festivals and 
convenings of all kinds. And she just 
loved this work. He saw the value in it 
and understood that the connection 
with human beings is the essence of 
politics. 
He once said that Nellie knew more 
constituents and more local organiza-
tions than anyone else in Maryland. 
And, you know, I think she is just in-
credibly proud of that to this day. I 
know that she shared a camaraderie 
and an esprit de corps and a joy of 
working for Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
How you treat your staff and how 
you see your staff says a lot about you 
as a public servant. Senators have a lot 
more staff than we do over here in the 
House, and he really knew his staff and 
treated them great. 
After Senator Sarbanes retired, Nel-
lie went on to work for another Sen-
ator, and then she retired. And when 
she retired, her current employer, the 
Senator, couldn’t attend her retire-
ment party, but Paul Sarbanes did. He 
showed up and he spoke about Nellie. 
That is the kind of person he was. 
So it is a great loss for Maryland and 
for our country. And I just want to say 
to all of his former staff that you all 
don’t get enough appreciation. Our 
staff doesn’t. Senator Sarbanes treated 
his staff right, and I hope we all can 
live up to his example. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. LEVIN, I, too, rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Maryland Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
The magnitude of his loss can be felt 
throughout Maryland and the country. 
Senator Sarbanes spent his entire ca-
reer fighting for the issues that Mary-
landers care the most about. He was a 
champion for justice, authoring the 
first article of impeachment against a 
corrupt President. He was a champion 
for fairness, tackling corporate regu-
latory reform and ensuring trans-
parency for investors. He was a cham-
pion for the environment, spearheading 
efforts to protect Maryland’s beloved 
Chesapeake Bay for generations to 
come. 
It is not just his long list of accom-
plishments that Senator Sarbanes will 
be remembered for, it is also his dedi-
cation to the people. Senator Sarbanes 
defined what it means to be a public 
servant. He showed up in the commu-
nities that felt left behind. He listened 
to the concerns of his constituents, and 
he worked hard to get things done for 
our State and the country. 
That type of leadership is hard to 
find here in Washington. We can all 
learn a lot from him. I know I have. My 
wife, June, and I extend our condo-
lences to the friends and family of Sen-
ator Sarbanes, especially to his son, 
our friend, Congressman JOHN
SAR-
BANES. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

A FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. BROOKS) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE), my colleague and 
wonderful, dear friend. 
FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. My 
grandparents were from Indiana, and 
the gentlewoman from Indiana rep-
resents her State well, and I have ap-
preciated our relationship. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my 
farewell speech to this House, and I am 
going to surprise some people by say-
ing that I rise today with hope and op-
timism. I know that is unusual because 
there are people on both sides of the 
House that want to say this country is 
in a bad place and heading in the wrong 
direction. 
I believe that view ignores two very 
important things. One is our history, 
and the other is what I hear the people 
of America telling us. 
Several years ago, a number of us 
from the Senate and the House, both 
parties, had the privilege of spending 
an evening at the Library of Congress 
with the noted American history writ-
er David McCullough. At the end of the 
evening, the moderator turned to him 
and said: What parting words do you 
have for these Members of Congress? 
And he said: I think if the people of 
America knew their history better, 
they would be more hopeful, they 
would be more optimistic. 
I have been listening to the people of 
my district for the last 7 years. When I 
was listening to them, I had no pre-
conceived notions about what they 
thought, and, buddy, they told me. And 
the American people, through elec-
tions, have told us, too. And the great 
thing about our elections is there are 
no filters. 
If you go back and look at the his-
tory of this country, you will see some 
notable things. One is that this coun-
try was founded by people who believed 
in principles, in morals, and values 
that defined who we are. They took a 
tremendous risk in fighting the most 
powerful military nation in the world, 
Great Britain, and they did it after de-
claring something very important, not 
just that they were declaring independ-
ence, but the reasons for why they were 
doing it. 
That Congress was the Second Conti-
nental Congress. The First Continental 
Congress, which met in 1774, is the 
forerunner to this House, a group of 
people elected to represent the people 
of this country. It is a notion as old as 
the creation of Parliament and the 
House of Commons of England, some-
thing that was their heritage. 
Now, they took a great risk because 
they felt they faced a great risk. They 
had been told when those colonies were 
founded that they would have the same 
rights as all English people, and they 
found after the French and Indian war 
that that wasn’t true, that those rights 
were going to be taken from them, and 
they were willing to fight for those 
rights. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, let me say this 
very clearly. They didn’t come into 
this with clean hands. When the Euro-
peans came to this continent, this was 
not a new world. This was an old world. 
There was a civilization already here 
that had been here for thousands of 
years. And between our germs, which 
they had no defense against, and other 
things worse than that, we essentially 
took this land from them. 
In 
1619, 
European 
slave 
traders 
brought the first slave to this country. 
So when they went into that fight with 
the British, they didn’t have clean 
hands. 
But 
societies 
are 
complex 
things, and because they didn’t have 
clean hands didn’t mean they didn’t 
have clean hearts. And they did. 
They waged an incredible war for 5 
years against this great military power 
and won. And they won because of what 
they stood on. Go back and look at the 
Declaration of Independence. One sen-
tence in there really says it all: ‘‘We 
hold these truths. . . . ‘’ 
Truths, absolutes, not something you 
get to change your mind about. 
‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal. 
. . . ‘’ 
Yes, I know they used the word 
‘‘men,’’ but the principle of equality 
was in there. It was in what they were 
standing on. And they said we were 
created equal, which means we had a 
Creator. And they go on in the very 
next phrase and they say: ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator. . . . ‘’ 
They were gifted. Endowed means 
gifted. They were gifted by their Cre-
ator, by God himself with certain 
unalienable rights, rights that can’t be 
taken away from them. And that

among these rights are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. And that 
governments are instituted among men 
to secure those very liberties, ‘‘ . . . de-
riving their just powers from the con-
sent of the governed.’’ 
We need to reread that sentence over 
and over again. Government doesn’t 
exist for the politicians. Government 
exists to secure rights, and the power 
we have is the power the people give 
us. 
Now, I know very well that we had to 
follow up that desperate war and that 
declaration by creating a Constitution, 
the Constitution we are under today. 
Sadly, it is a Constitution I fear too 
many people, including too many peo-
ple in power, don’t know much about. 
Because the purpose of the Constitu-
tion was not only to create a govern-
ment that had enough power to do 
what needed to be done for the things 
that are listed in the preamble of the 
Constitution, it also put limits on that 
government. And some of us act as if 
there are no limits on this government. 
And our Founders knew because they 
had to fight against a tyrannical cen-
tral government that there needed to 
be limits on government. Those same 
English rights that they had inherited 
had been secured because people, for 
hundreds of years, had to fight back 
against British kings that wanted to 
take power and use it against the peo-
ple. 
b 2015 
People lost their lives. There was 
great suffering, as there was in our 
Revolution, because tyrannical central 
governments don’t give their power 
back easily, they don’t give them back 
without a fight. That fight continued 
in the Constitution. 
The Bill of Rights, which was adopt-
ed by this House in the very first Con-
gress under the leadership of James 
Madison, as he said in his speech to the 
House when he introduced the Bill of 
Rights, he said, this is all about mak-
ing sure that we take away from this 
powerful government we have created 
any notion that they can trample on 
certain specific rights, and they laid 
them out. And in a couple years, all 
the States necessary ratified those 
amendments, and they are part of the 
fundamental law of this country, al-
though sometimes we act like they are 
not. 
I have listened, by the way, to some 
of the debates about what rights we 
have under the Free Exercise Clause. 
The Free Exercise Clause is in the 
First Amendment to the Constitution, 
and it says, Congress can’t make any 
law that establishes a religion or in-
fringes upon the free exercise of that 
religion; exercise, action. We have a 
right to freely exercise our religion, 
and we need to remember that funda-
mental right along with the others. 
Now, that was our founding: the Dec-
laration of Independence, the War for 
Independence, the Constitution, the 
Bill of Rights. That was our founding, 
not 1619. And we need to remember the 
principles of our founding, because 
they are central to who we are as peo-
ple. 
Now, over the course of the 19th cen-
tury, we were invaded by Great Brit-
ain, the Capitol Building here was 
burned, the White House was burned. 
We could have given up, but we didn’t, 
because that is not who we are. 
We not only survived, we fought on 
and built this great country so that by 
1860, we not only bordered on the At-
lantic Ocean, we bordered on the Pa-
cific Ocean and we bordered on the Rio 
Grande. We grew by leaps and bounds. 
Then in 1861, we entered another 
tragedy, because the people that put 
that Constitution together failed in at 
least one critical regard: they failed to 
address the issue of slavery, and we 
fought a terrible Civil War that cost 
the lives of 600,000 Americans to solve a 
problem that should have been solved 
in 1787. 
Despite that war, we came back, we 
ended slavery, we adopted the Four-
teenth Amendment and the Fifteenth 
Amendment, and we grew as a Nation 
throughout the rest of the 19th cen-
tury. 
Finally, in the early 20th century, we 
did the right thing and gave women the 
right to vote. Neither of my grand-
mothers, as young adult women with 
families, could vote. It is amazing that 
that was true just that long ago, but it 
was. But we corrected it, as we always 
do. 
In World War II, this country fought 
an incredibly difficult world war on 
three different continents and beat the 
most powerful nations in the world, 
and at the end of that war, stood as the 
only real power left on the Earth. 
And we had a choice. We could have 
walked away, come right back to our 
shores and said, we are going back to 
being the insular country we have 
been. We could have also said, we have 
got more power than everybody else; 
we are going to use it against every-
body else to make ourselves wealthy. 
We did neither. 
We stood up and led the world, and 
created a rules-based order that has 
benefited people all over the world, 
that has lifted billions of people out of 
poverty, that has increased the lifespan 
of billions of people, that spread de-
mocracy and freedom around the globe, 
because that is who we are. 
While we were doing that, we were 
also facing our problems here at home. 
Yes, we have problems here at home. 
We didn’t finish the work of the Civil 
War. We had to go through a difficult 
civil rights movement, and in this 
House, we adopted the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act, and in this House, we adopted the 
1965 Voting Rights Act. We did that. 
We provided things for the education 
of the children of this country they 
didn’t have. We provided things for 
healthcare in this country that people 
didn’t have. We provided for clean air 
and clean water. 
We addressed our own problems while 
we were leading the world, because 
that is who we are. We do those things. 
Now, I understand that there are peo-
ple that want to give us a different 
version of that history. They want to 
tell us that we are all evil from birth, 
that somehow this country is inher-
ently evil. 
That just doesn’t square with his-
toric facts. 
They want to rewrite history. 
The first thing any authoritarian 
government does is rewrite history or 
attempt to do it. The authoritarian 
wannabes in this country are trying to 
rewrite our history, and they want to 
do that to pursue a radical agenda that 
doesn’t match up with what the Amer-
ican people want. 
They try to call themselves Progres-
sives. That is not progressive. Wanting 
a powerful central government is re-
gressive. That is regressing back to 
what we rebelled against in 1776. 
They are not progressive. They are 
Socialists. They are at least honest in 
saying that. But they are not progres-
sive. It is regressive. 
Let me tell you what I hear the 
American people say in my district and 
around this country. They are saying 
this: We Americans aren’t evil. We are 
and have been a force for good here and 
around the world. 
We aren’t Socialists. We don’t want a 
powerful, overreaching central govern-
ment. 
We don’t want Medicare for all, 
where the government makes decisions 
for us and our doctors, and rations 
when and how we get our healthcare. 
We believe our healthcare system is 
the best in the world, and we want to 
keep it that way, but we also want to 
assure that everyone in this country 
has real access to it. 
We don’t want a Green New Deal, 
which jacks up our utility bills, saps 
our economic competitiveness, and de-
stroys jobs. 
We don’t want to defund the police. 
In fact, we think spending on public 
safety is a good thing. We value our 
law enforcement officers and we grieve 
when one is killed, as dozens are every 
year. 
We want our government to defend 
our shores and interests and protect us 
here at home. We rely upon the men 
and women wearing our uniform to do 
that, and we want our government to 
take care of them. 
I have gotten the chance to travel all 
over the world to see our men and 
women in uniform, many of them in 
harm’s way, and I am so proud of them. 
And like most Americans, I want to 
make sure we are doing the right thing 
by them. 
We want to make sure that there is 
opportunity in this country for every-
one. Everyone. Don’t leave anybody 
out. We want everybody to be able to 
take advantage of all that this Nation 
has to offer. And to achieve that goal, 
we need quality education for every-
body in this country, and not just for 
the privileged. 
It shouldn’t be the case that you get 
one caliber of education because of

where you live, one type of education, 
one quality of education, and a worse 
one if you live in some other place. We 
should give everybody the freedom to 
have quality education so that they 
can take advantage of those opportuni-
ties. 
We want justice for everyone. Every-
one. Because injustice to anyone is in-
justice to us all. 
We want our air and water to be 
clean. 
We want to continue to be the eco-
nomic leader of the world. 
Let me stop and say a word about 
China. 
The greatest external threat to this 
country is China; not the Chinese peo-
ple, but the Communist Party that 
runs China. They seek to become the 
only power in the world; not a power, 
the only power. And they will do any-
thing—anything. They will stop at 
nothing to get it. 
It is past time for us to wake up and 
understand the threat that they are, 
not just to us, but to the entire world 
and that rules-based order we created 
after World War II. 
And, Mr. Speaker, we the American 
people are tired of being divided, di-
vided by our region. Since when is it 
okay for the coasts to look down on 
the other parts of the country? 
We don’t want to be divided by race. 
People aren’t defined by the color of 
their skin, they are not defined by 
their ethnicity, they are not defined by 
their national origin. That is anti- 
American to think that way. We should 
come together over that. 
We don’t want to be divided by our 
gender. 
We don’t want to be divided by reli-
gion. Whether you have got a religion 
or not, we don’t want to be divided by 
it. 
We don’t want to be divided by gen-
eration, the young versus the old. It 
has always been that the old handed 
something valuable to the next genera-
tion. That is what we should be about. 
That division in our country is the 
greatest internal threat we have got. 
And I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is 
the greatest threat of all, because 
there is nothing that this great Nation 
can’t accomplish when we are united, 
when we are e pluribus unum, out of 
many, one. 
That is who America is, that is who 
the American people want us to be, and 
that is the great challenge before this 
House. 
I have had a great experience here in 
Congress. I have met some wonderful 
people. I have had the privilege of serv-
ing on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, and the Rules Committee. I 
have seen a lot of important things be 
done here and be done right. 
The best legislation passed in this 
House is bipartisan legislation. The 
worst legislation is almost always par-
tisan legislation. Usually it doesn’t 
make it across the finish line, by the 
way. 
Our ability to work together should 
be what we should all be striving for in 
this House, and I hope the House to fol-
low will do that. 
Mr. Speaker, before I take my leave, 
I want to say a few things. 
I want to thank the many Members 
of this House who have befriended me 
and helped me on both sides of the 
aisle. I particularly want to thank my 
fellow colleagues in the Alabama dele-
gation. They have been a great family 
to be a part of. 
I want to thank the staff. The staff of 
this House is amazing, so very helpful, 
so 
very 
competent, 
and 
we 
just 
couldn’t get our jobs down without 
you. 
I want to thank the good people of 
southwest Alabama. They gave me the 
great privilege of being here to rep-
resent them as their only representa-
tive. What an honor that has been. I 
hope and pray that I have fulfilled the 
trust that they put in me, because they 
are my bosses. 
I want to thank my many supporters 
who time and time again helped me, 
and sometimes it wasn’t so easy to do 
what they had to do. 
I want to thank my office staff here 
in Washington and the district. They 
made me look good every day, and I 
could not have done what I have done 
without them. So to all of my staff, 
present and former, thank you for what 
you have done for me. 
And I want to thank my long-suf-
fering family. You know, they have 
loved me and they supported me, even 
when I wasn’t so lovable and even when 
it wasn’t so easy to support me. I could 
not have done it without them. 
So to my son Patrick, his wife, Caro-
lyn, my grandchildren MacGuire and 
Ann Roberts; my daughter Kathleen 
and her husband, Steve, and son, Coo-
per; my daughter Laura, her husband, 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
Stephen 
Prugh, now presently at the Pentagon; 
my son Colin; and most of all, I want 
to thank my wife, Rebecca. 
You know, these are hard positions 
and it is really hard to be the spouse of 
somebody in these positions, and Re-
becca has done a tremendous job in 
supporting me in every way you could 
ask. She is truly the love of my life for 
40 years now, and I want to thank her 
for all that she has done for me in all 
those 40 years, but particularly these 
last 7 years. 
And now, Mr. Speaker, I say farewell 
to this House. God bless you all, and 
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, that was outstanding. 
And to my dear friend and colleague, 
best to you in retirement and in your 
next chapter of life. You have an amaz-
ing family; you have a passion for our 
country. Thank you for reminding us 
all of the great history of this country. 
And what an amazing country we are 
both proud to be born in and lucky to 
be born in. So I wish you well. 
Mr. Speaker, fellow Members of Con-
gress, my dedicated staff past and 
present, my family and friends, and 
most importantly to the Hoosiers of 
the Fifth District of Indiana: I stand 
before you today at the end of an in-
credibly challenging year, at the close 
of a tumultuous decade, and in the 
final days of my tenure as a Member of 
this esteemed body. 
When I decided to run for Congress in 
2011, it was because I wanted to make a 
difference in my community and my 
country. I believed that despite the 
dysfunction that did and does dominate 
the headlines, I could get things done 
for my home State of Indiana and my 
fellow Hoosiers. 
Above all, I wanted to restore con-
fidence in Congress, to reassure people 
that our government can and does do 
enormous good, that their elected rep-
resentatives are dedicated public serv-
ants who, while still human, wake up 
each day committed to ensuring a 
brighter future for every American, 
where the opportunity to thrive is not 
limited to some, but afforded to all. 
b 2030 
How do you go about rebuilding trust 
and faith with some 328 million people? 
We still have a long way to go. Con-
gressional approval ratings continue to 
hover in the teens and twenties. 
But over the course of my 8 years 
here, I have identified four steps I be-
lieve can and will go a long way to re-
storing public trust and faith in Con-
gress. 
The first sounds relatively simple. 
We just need to do the work. As every 
Member of this esteemed body knows, 
in practice, making an idea into an ef-
fective law takes careful planning, 
hours of learning, listening to the ex-
perts, deep discussions, debates with 
constituents, and colleagues across the 
political spectrum, not to mention ac-
tually writing the legislation and earn-
ing the votes to get it signed into law 
by the President. 
These days, it seems like ideas we 
can all get behind are few and far be-
tween. Wherever you look, it is hard 
not to see the deep divisions in our 
country, along party lines to be sure, 
but also along racial, socioeconomic, 
gender, geographic, and religious lines 
as well. 
Following a very contentious elec-
tion, those divisions are on full display, 
for better or for worse. It is easy to 
point out the problems we face, but it 
is the difficult, humbling work to set 
aside our differences, to roll up our 
sleeves, and to focus on finding solu-
tions. My time in Congress has taught 
me that it is work worth doing. 
Some of the most important work 
that I have been involved in here has 
been in response to the number of 
Americans lost to opioid overdoses 
each day that is still alarmingly high 
and being pushed higher by the pan-
demic. 
I am especially proud to have been a 
part of getting a comprehensive piece 
of legislation passed to work against 
every facet of the heroin opioid crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7034 
December 8, 2020 
From prevention and education, to 
treatment and recovery, to getting 
overdose reversal drugs into the hands 
of first responders, and supporting law 
enforcement in their fight against il-
licit drugs, I am even prouder that the 
legislation that was ultimately signed 
into law incorporated hundreds of 
smart solutions and proposals from in-
dividual Members of Congress from 
across the country and the political 
spectrum. 
The Comprehensive Addiction and 
Recovery Act epitomizes the way our 
government can and should work for 
us. I have worked hard to ensure that I 
approach each day ready to collabo-
rate, debate, and work alongside my 
colleagues, regardless of party, and to 
really address the challenges facing our 
country. 
I believe government’s first priority 
is security, keeping its citizens safe, 
the people directly responsible for en-
suring our security, our brave service-
men and -women. It is impossible to 
overstate my admiration and gratitude 
for the difficult work they do, the sac-
rifices they and their families make for 
our safety, and their willingness to pay 
the ultimate price for our freedom. 
I was lucky enough to be a part of a 
delegation led by retiring Members 
Representatives 
MARTHA
ROBY
and 
SUSAN DAVIS to Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
Jordan to thank moms for serving 
away from their families on Mother’s 
Day. These were among the most 
meaningful moments of my congres-
sional career. They reinforced my be-
lief that Congress’ top job is to support 
our troops and our diplomats, to give 
them the tools they need to perform 
their duty and to never forget the sac-
rifice they have made and will con-
tinue to make for our country. 
While contentious and difficult, my 
work on the Select Committee on 
Benghazi was, at its core, to make sure 
we do a better job of protecting our 
diplomats and Americans serving over-
seas. They deserve to know that we are 
doing everything in our power to keep 
them safe while they protect our inter-
ests and defend our Nation abroad. 
At home, it is our first responders 
who are on the front lines of ensuring 
our safety and upholding the rule of 
law. Because I worked closely with our 
partners in law enforcement, first as a 
deputy mayor in Indianapolis and later 
as U.S. attorney for the Southern Dis-
trict of Indiana, I wanted to be a voice 
for law enforcement in Congress. I saw 
their dedication and the sacrifices they 
and their families make. 
There were and are areas where we 
can make both our citizens and our 
first responders safer. 
Following 
the 
Boston 
Marathon 
bombing, I worked to help first re-
sponders use social media as an effec-
tive tool for disaster response. Later, 
my fellow Hoosiers, Senators YOUNG 
and DONNELLY, and a bipartisan group 
of my colleagues in the House led ef-
forts to give first responders critical 
access to mental health support to 
manage the trauma inherent in their 
day-to-day work. 
Today, law enforcement needs our 
support more than ever, even as we 
look for ways to ensure our laws are 
enforced justly and fairly. 
Time and time again during my con-
gressional career, we found areas of 
agreement, 
no 
matter 
how 
small, 
where positive change can be made for 
our fellow citizens. And sometimes we 
go big. We came together to pass the 
21st Century Cures Act led by Rep-
resentative 
FRED
UPTON
and 
Rep-
resentative DIANA DEGETTE from Colo-
rado, which speeds up the research, de-
velopment, and deploying of lifesaving 
medicines, treatments, and, yes, vac-
cines. 
I joined breast cancer survivor Rep-
resentative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ to en-
sure young women can access life-
saving mammograms and detect breast 
cancer early. 
Beyond the big headlines about grid-
lock and dysfunction, there is good, 
meaningful work being done on Capitol 
Hill, but none of it is done alone. 
To my beloved friends and family, 
‘‘thank you’’ doesn’t begin to cover it. 
You have kept me grounded in purpose, 
honest and strong. Your unwavering 
support and love and laughter have 
made the hard days easier and the 
happy days more joyful. 
My husband, David, and my children, 
Jessica and Connor, having you by my 
side every step of the way has made all 
the difference. I love you very much 
and couldn’t be prouder of all that you 
have accomplished in the last 8 years. 
To the rest of my family and friends 
at home and across the country, thank 
you for being my champions, my cheer-
leaders, and, above all, for walking 
alongside me even during the difficult 
parts of this journey. You were the 
first volunteers for my campaign and 
you always have my back. I look for-
ward to more time spent with all of 
you in the months and years to come. 
To my dedicated team, past and 
present, some of whom have been with 
me since the beginning of this wild 
ride, I share every accomplishment and 
every accolade with you. It is hard to 
find people with whom you can share a 
passion and a purpose, let alone a few 
laughs and tears along the way. 
From the day I announced my can-
didacy to the day we turn off the 
lights, there are countless individuals 
who have contributed to my work with 
integrity and grit and who served the 
Fifth District honorably. We have be-
come a family. 
While working side by side, we have 
celebrated life’s great joys—weddings, 
babies, 
first 
grandchildren—and 
cheered one another on during periods 
of transition—new jobs, pursuing grad-
uate degrees, first homes, and cross- 
country moves. And we have grieved 
together during life’s inevitable sor-
rows, mourning friends and family 
members taken too soon, including 
Judy Christofolis, who died this past 
spring after a long battle with breast 
cancer. 
Through it all, I have been lucky to 
have been surrounded by smart people 
who are willing to work late nights and 
early mornings to crisscross the Fifth 
District to hear directly from our con-
stituents, to learn and grow alongside, 
and craft effective legislation that 
really fixes problems for people. 
I am proud of all the work we have 
done together, and I am looking for-
ward to cheering each of you on during 
all the exciting twists and turns that 
are yet to come in your life’s journey. 
To my colleagues, most of whom I 
now call friends, particularly the Indi-
ana delegation, my brothers and sister 
Hoosiers, thank you for your collabora-
tion, your intelligence, your patriot-
ism, and your service. It is a privilege 
to work with each of you, and I am 
grateful for all the opportunities we 
had to tackle big problems together. 
I want to especially recognize my es-
teemed congressional mentors, Rep-
resentative CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
who believed in me and supported me 
in my very first primary; former 
Speaker John Boehner, who gave me 
many opportunities to lead and make a 
difference; Representative FRED UPTON 
and Representative GREG WALDEN, who 
were amazing leaders on the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee; and to 
our Republican leadership team, who I 
have become very close to, Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, Whip STEVE SCALISE, 
and Conference Chair LIZ CHENEY. 
They approached their difficult jobs 
with enthusiasm, integrity, and vision. 
Thank you for your encouragement, 
counsel, and wisdom, and for all of our 
staffs. 
Finally, to the people of the Fifth 
District, it has been the great honor of 
my life to serve as your voice in Con-
gress, your advocate, for the last 8 
years. 
I would like to especially recognize 
the young people who participated in 
my youth advisory groups, the thou-
sands of constituents who visited with 
me at Connect With Your Congress-
woman events, the educators and busi-
ness leaders who made our Connecting 
Careers and Classroom events such a 
success. You make me proud to be a 
Hoosier. 
That brings me to my second step in 
rebuilding confidence in Congress. We 
must remain closely connected, more 
closely than ever before, to our home 
States, our communities, and the peo-
ple we represent. The laws we pass in 
Congress are focused on the national 
level, but my first priority is and al-
ways has been serving the people of the 
Fifth. 
In 8 years, we worked with more than 
4,500 constituents to help them navi-
gate government, resolve issues with 
Federal agencies like the Veterans Ad-
ministration, Medicare, assist with 
stalled international adoptions, and 
even bring terrorists to justice for the 
murder of a young Hoosier. 
We worked with communities to sup-
port critical grants and initiatives that 
are making the Fifth District of Indi-
ana an even greater place to live, work,

and grow. In Anderson, after years of 
effort, we secured support for the 8th 
Street Bridge, a critical transportation 
link downtown. 
We commemorated the 50th anniver-
sary of Robert Kennedy’s speech fol-
lowing the assassination of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. I worked with my fel-
low 
Hoosier 
Representative 
ANDRE´ 
CARSON and Senators YOUNG and DON-
NELLY to establish the Landmark for 
Peace Memorial in Indianapolis as part 
of the African American Civil Rights 
Network. 
It was the honor of a lifetime to be 
with the late civil rights icon and my 
friend, Representative JOHN LEWIS, in 
Indiana to celebrate that 50 years of 
struggle and progress. 
And, yes, we grieved with the city of 
Noblesville following a tragic school 
shooting, but we honored the heroes, 
the teachers, the nurses, and the school 
police officers who saved lives that 
day. 
Yes, the job is difficult. But some-
times, this job is just fun. Whether it is 
calling a brilliant young Hoosier to tell 
them they received an appointment to 
attend a military academy, or whether 
we have traveled the district and 
learned how puzzles are made at a fac-
tory in Tipton, or we joined Indiana 
Wesleyan University students in Mar-
ion to celebrate three national sports 
titles and their 100th anniversary. 
At Launch Fishers and zWorks in 
Zionsville, we saw the latest and cut-
ting-edge technology and met entre-
preneurs on the cusp of the next great 
idea. 
It wouldn’t be a trip home without 
mentioning the food, whether it was 
enjoying the waffles after ringing the 
bell to open the farmers market in my 
hometown of Carmel or grabbing a bite 
at the Indiana State Fair Midway. 
I can’t thank all the farmers enough 
across the Fifth District for opening 
their farms to me and helping me un-
derstand all the work that goes into 
providing the food on our tables, both 
at home and around the world. 
I even got to try my hand at a few 
jobs, like spending a day as a UPS driv-
er in suburban Indianapolis. 
But it is the conversations with the 
young Hoosiers that gave me so much 
hope. I will never forget visiting the 
JROTC program at Blackford High 
School and celebrating Veterans Day 
with them. The adventures across the 
district and the warm welcomes I re-
ceived will stay with me for the rest of 
my life. 
Beyond the job and remaining rooted 
in our districts, the third way we can 
restore confidence in Congress is to 
take a hard look at ourselves in the 
mirror to ensure that Congress truly 
embodies the diversity that makes our 
Nation strong and to commit to a cul-
ture of continuous improvement. 
When my close friend, Representative 
JACKIE WALORSKI, who is one of my 
best friends here—we were elected in 
2012—we were the first Republican 
women to represent the State of Indi-
ana in Washington, D.C., in 50 years. 
Representative Cecil Harden had come 
before us. 
We joined a small, but mighty, group 
of women in the House who, despite our 
political differences, agreed that Con-
gress needed more women. And last 
year, I took the baton from my dear 
friends, Representative ELISE STEFANIK 
and ANN WAGNER before her, and we led 
Republican efforts to recruit more 
women and more people of color to run 
for Congress. 
This fall, more Republican women 
ran and won than ever before. Our work 
must continue on both sides of the 
aisle if Congress is to truly reflect the 
diversity of our country. It is one of 
the reasons I agreed to co-chair the Bi-
partisan Women’s Caucus with Rep-
resentative LOIS FRANKEL. 
Together, we led efforts to improve 
access to school around the globe for 
girls. We worked to recognize the fe-
male leaders who came before us, from 
the 100th anniversary of the first 
woman to serve in Congress, Jeannette 
Rankin, to the annual Memorial Day 
service where we honor our female vet-
erans. 
Importantly, we acted on the find-
ings of the Indianapolis Star investiga-
tion into sexual abuse of young Olym-
pic hopefuls, to protect young athletes 
from harm and to ensure that victims 
have access to justice, and we did so 
across party lines. 
Nowhere was bipartisanship more at 
work, though, than during my service, 
first as a Member and then as chair-
woman of the House Ethics Committee. 
Holding that gavel not only made me 
the first Hoosier woman to chair a con-
gressional committee, but it was an 
unprecedented opportunity to ensure 
transparency, accountability, access, 
and justice in Congress. Little did I 
know that I would preside over the 
committee at the same time that the 
#MeToo movement shone a light on the 
pervasive problem of sexual harass-
ment in our society and in our govern-
ment. 
Like many of you, my good friend 
and the ranking member TED DEUTCH 
and I were shocked to learn that mil-
lions of dollars in settlements had been 
paid by Congress to victims of sexual 
assault. Over the next year, a bipar-
tisan group of Members worked to re-
form the Congressional Accountability 
Act to make it easier for victims to re-
port sexual harassment and to make 
sure that financial settlements aren’t 
paid by Members of Congress and that 
they must be disclosed to the public. 
There is still so much work to be 
done, but I have to tell you, at the end 
of my service here in Congress, the Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization 
of Congress gives me much hope. I have 
been a proud member of that com-
mittee. We recently published 97 bipar-
tisan 
recommendations 
focused 
on 
making Congress work more efficiently 
and transparently and to be more re-
sponsive and accessible to the Amer-
ican people. 
A quarter of our recommendations 
have already been enacted, and I hope 
the rest will soon follow, because if we 
are to debate 21st century issues, we 
must bring our policies, technology, 
staff, and communications into the 
modern age. 
So, I strongly encourage and urge my 
colleagues and the new Members of 
Congress to first read our report and 
then take up the select committee’s 
recommendations and continue the 
hard work. I want to thank Represent-
atives KILMER and GRAVES for their 
leadership. 
That brings me to my fourth and 
final step of rebuilding trust and faith 
in Congress: ensuring we are looking 
ahead, beyond the most pressing chal-
lenges of today, to those on the hori-
zon. 
Following the recession in 2009, many 
Americans were out of work. Still more 
were underemployed. Our economy was 
and is moving quickly to Industry 5.0 
where careers in tech, connected de-
vices, and AI become the norm. 
b 2045 
If we aren’t careful, this future will 
leave many of our fellow citizens be-
hind. 
To that end, we have passed legisla-
tion to improve training and workforce 
programs to retrain and deploy Ameri-
cans who are out of work, to expand 5G 
networks and rural broadband so more 
people can participate in this indus-
trial 
revolution 
and 
provide 
clear 
guardrails for the technology industry 
to continue its rapid growth, while of-
fering better protection for our per-
sonal information, preventing cyber 
threats and attacks. 
Our world is changing fast, and Con-
gress must keep up. When former Rep-
resentative MIKE ROGERS approached 
me about continuing his work to 
strengthen our national biodefense, I 
knew it was important work. 
Alongside my incredible partner who 
became a very dear friend, Representa-
tive ANNA ESHOO and I began engaging 
again in the biodefense efforts that 
have been going on since the early 
2000s, the reauthorization of the Pan-
demic and All-Hazards Preparedness 
Act. It was signed into law in 2019. 
This legislation represents years of 
bipartisan collaboration and thought-
ful input from medical and public 
health preparedness and response lead-
ers. It helped bolster our response to 
natural disasters and chemical, bio-
logical, 
radiological, 
and 
nuclear 
threats. 
When it was passed, I thought the 
greatest threats we faced were from 
terrorist organizations like ISIS using 
chemical or biological weapons in their 
attack, which are still a significant 
concern today. But little did I realize 
that our Nation—our world—was on 
the verge of a pandemic that would 
grind business, travel, and life as we 
knew it to a halt. 
I am glad we passed PAHPA when we 
did, and I know we must do better in

the future. When the next novel virus 
or biological unforeseen event occurs, 
Americans will expect more from this 
institution. We can learn from our suc-
cesses and failures over the last 9 
months and in the months to come as 
we look toward a COVID–19 vaccine 
and, ultimately, a return to our normal 
pace of life. We know some things will 
never be the same. 
Change must happen in our country 
to make good on our founding promise 
that all people are created equal and 
that our rights to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness are protected. How 
we do that is a matter great debate 
playing out in our streets in protests, 
on social media, around dinner tables, 
and in headlines. 
It seems like there is no good solu-
tion and no way forward. It is up to 
us—to every American—to forge a path 
together and to mend the fissures that 
are breaking apart our Nation and our 
democracy. 
I have spent the last 8 years engaged 
in this work day in and day out. It is 
work I will continue for the rest of my 
life because the truth is we have far 
more in common than we don’t. 
We are up to this task. I believe in 
the American spirit, in the power of 
our ingenuity, and in the strength of 
our resolve. 
We will get through these difficult 
days. This pandemic will end. We will 
get Americans and businesses back to 
work and school. 
We will overcome the scourge of rac-
ism and prejudice. 
We will restore trust and confidence 
in our government and in Congress. 
We will once again see this Chamber 
full of big ideas aimed at ensuring the 
American Dream is within reach for ev-
eryone. 
I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the 
very last time, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
f 
AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE 
DEMOCRACY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, when I 
was a professor teaching American 
Government before I was elected to 
Congress, the first thing I would do 
when beginning to teach a class about 
Congress and the legislative process 
would be to show this video. It is the 3- 
minute ‘‘Schoolhouse Rock’’ cartoon 
video from the 1970s called ‘‘I’m Just a 
Bill.’’ 
The cartoon begins with a group of 
constituents calling their Congressman 
with an idea for a new law. The Con-
gressman introduces a bill, which goes 
through House committee debate and 
amendment before a vote to report the 
bill favorably to the House floor. 
On the floor, the bill goes through de-
bate and amendment before a majority 
vote that sends the bill over to the 
Senate, where the process continues. 
This is a process that we call regular 
order. Regular order in the House is a 
standard way of legislating that facili-
tates extensive participation of Mem-
bers in the deliberative, consensus- 
based decisionmaking process. 
More importantly, this is how the 
Framers of the Constitution not only 
intended the House to work, but be-
lieved that the House needed to work if 
the United States, then in its infancy, 
was to succeed. 
Congress was created in Article I of 
the Constitution because the legisla-
tive branch, being closest to the peo-
ple, was necessarily the linchpin of 
American representative democracy. 
While the Framers didn’t include in 
the Constitution the rules by which the 
House and Senate would operate, they 
understood that the way in which the 
lawmaking process was conducted was 
critical to the creation of laws that 
were good for the Nation as a whole 
and to the legitimacy of Congress and 
those laws. 
James Madison, oftentimes called 
the Father of Congress, believed it was 
essential that the legislative branch 
make policy in the manner that well 
represented the vast and varied Repub-
lic and best served the Nation as a 
whole. 
Remember, our Nation began as a 
unique experiment in self-governance. 
There was great doubt about whether 
the views of people so diverse could 
successfully be forged into good policy 
that served such a large nation. 
Madison believed that the way to do 
this was for Members of Congress to 
represent the multiple and diverse in-
terests and ideas of their constituents 
in an open marketplace of ideas in Con-
gress. Through the legislative process, 
the people’s Representatives would de-
bate, deliberate, and put together a 
consensus on legislation that served 
the common good of the Nation. 
What the Constitution created was 
not a parliamentary system, because 
the Framers did not intend to empower 
temporary majorities. Instead, they 
wanted to compel compromise in a di-
verse society. 
The exercise of power was shared so 
that all American voters had an oppor-
tunity to be heard in the lawmaking 
process and to ensure that only the 
will of broad, durable majorities could 
be acted upon. Especially because 
America was a large and diverse coun-
try whose unity needed to be nurtured, 
it was critical that the legislative 
process worked this way so that the 
American people saw Congress as an in-
stitution that truly represented them 
and saw American law as legitimate. 
But today, the House doesn’t often 
work this way, especially when we deal 
with issues that are of the greatest im-
portance to our Nation. Those bills, 
when they get considered, don’t get 
shaped through an open process in 
committee and on the House floor. 
Each Member doesn’t have the oppor-
tunity to represent their constituents 
by bringing their ideas and interests in 
the legislative process where debate, 
deliberation, and compromise produce 
the best policy for our Nation. Instead, 
the process runs through the Speaker’s 
Office, where the content of legislation 
is shaped to get enough votes just out 
of the majority to pass something that 
pleases various partisans. 
Now, before I go any further, I want 
to make clear that this is not a criti-
cism of the current Speaker or any 
former Speaker. This is a problem of 
our institution. 
So how did we get here? 
Well, there has been a big change in 
the way Washington reacts every 2 
years after a congressional election. It 
used to be the case that, when election 
results came in, everyone looked to see 
which party has the majority in the 
House, who has the majority in the 
Senate and whether it had 60 votes to 
overcome a filibuster, and which party 
held the White House. 
Understanding that balance of power 
and the issues facing our Nation over 
the next 2 years, Members of Congress 
would get to work figuring out what 
issues they may be able to come to an 
agreement on and get passed into law 
over the next 20 months or so before 
the next campaign cycle began. 
Now, today, what happens is, after 
understanding the balance of power in 
Washington after an election, each 
party retreats to its corner and begins 
plotting what their party is going to do 
over the next 2 years. 
If there is unified government—that 
is, one party has majorities in both 
Chambers of Congress and the Presi-
dency—here in the House, the Speaker 
will consider the priorities of the party 
and decide what issues to make their 
legislative priorities over the next 2 
years to create party-preferred laws 
and keep that majority. 
If there is divided government, which 
is the norm, having occurred 30 out of 
the last 40 years, and if you include the 
filibuster, 391⁄2 out of the last 40 years, 
if that is the case, the Speaker plans 
what the party can do over the next 2 
years to help the party gain unified 
control of the government with the 
hope of them passing all of the party’s 
preferred policies. On the other side of 
the aisle, they figure out what they 
can do over those 2 years so they can 
get control. 
In order to help the party carry out 
this biennial plan, Members of Con-
gress have given up much of their 
power to represent their constituents 
in the legislative process to party lead-
ers. 
So what has this led to? 
Gridlock. There are so many issues 
we need to address in this Nation and 
we fail to act: healthcare costs, the 
Federal debt, immigration, climate 
change, the economic and military 
threat of China, Social Security and 
Medicare finances, transportation in-
frastructure, the continuing decline of 
good working-class jobs, and reforming 
the War Powers Act. 
These are just some of the major 
issues which Congress has been failing

to address. I am sure there are other 
major ones that I just missed. 
The one obligation that Congress has 
each year—passing appropriations bills 
to fund the government—is almost 
never accomplished on time. 
Presidents have stepped in to fill the 
policymaking void. They now wield 
power even to address issues that were 
specifically put in the hands of Con-
gress in the Constitution. 
Increased Presidential exercise of 
power on policy has resulted in policy 
whipsawing back and forth depending 
on the Presidential administration. 
Lawmaking by executive order has be-
come the norm, so much so that ‘‘Sat-
urday Night Live’’ even did a parody of 
‘‘I’m Just a Bill,’’ replacing ‘‘bill’’ with 
an executive order. And this President 
has taken it to a new level. 
But no matter who the President has 
been, few of us stand up for our institu-
tion. We only criticize Presidential 
overreach when it is a policy that we 
don’t like. 
And it is not only the President who 
has gained power because Congress is 
failing to act. The courts have also 
stepped in as activists and have turned 
to the judicial system to settle policy 
issues in the absence of Congress. 
So what we have now is an imperial 
Presidency and powerful courts with a 
Congress that largely sits gridlocked. 
What happens when we have unified 
government in those rare times? 
The last two times this occurred, 
major policy changes were passed on 
completely party-line votes. The mi-
nority party then attacked the legit-
imacy of these laws. 
Now, I am not saying that these laws 
were illegitimate—they were not—but 
the Framers knew that this kind of at-
tack would happen if we did not come 
together to forge compromises. 
Now, in both these cases when uni-
fied government occurred, the last two 
times it happened, in the next election 
the House majority was changed by the 
American people. 
Today, Congress is failing in ways 
that the Founders feared. In Senator 
Lamar Alexander’s farewell address to 
the Senate, he defended the filibuster, 
saying that what is needed to make the 
Senate work better is not a change of 
rules but a change of behavior. Unfor-
tunately, I believe that we need some 
of both. 
b 2100 
Over the past 4 years, I have been a 
Member of the House Problem Solvers 
Caucus. The Caucus is a bipartisan 
group of about 50 members, evenly di-
vided between Democrats and Repub-
licans. We meet every week to talk pol-
icy and build relationships. Our goal is 
to work together to get to ‘‘yes’’ on 
policies that are good for our country. 
I greatly enjoyed the Caucus because 
not only have I been able to build 
friendships, but was able to participate 
in a microcosm of what Madison envi-
sioned for the House. 
The Problem Solvers Caucus doesn’t 
always succeed in forging compromise 
because sometimes it has been out of 
our reach, but we have taken on some 
big issues. I was part of a Problem 
Solvers Caucus working group that was 
put together after President Trump 
said he was going to eliminate DACA, 
and then told Speaker PELOSI and Sen-
ate Democrat Leader SCHUMER
he 
would help work out a legislative solu-
tion to protect these immigrants who 
were brought to the United States as 
children—the Dreamers. 
The President never followed through 
on that, but the Caucus believed that 
there was a bipartisan agreement that 
we could work out that granted the op-
portunity for citizenship to millions, 
who we argued were deserving of this, 
while putting into place policies to pre-
vent future illegal immigration. 
Our working group’s meetings usu-
ally started at 9 p.m. because that was 
the time of day that everyone was free 
from every other obligation that we 
have around here. We would get to-
gether—Democrats and Republicans— 
learn from each other and from experts 
of our current law, discuss our views 
and our constituents’ views on what 
law should be, what should be done. 
Honestly, work through every minute 
detail of a compromise. 
We worked late into the night. A few 
times, I had to run out to catch the 
last metro train at Union Station at 
11:30 so I can get back to my apart-
ment. It was hard work, but enjoyable. 
And we came up with a compromise 
that was endorsed by a bipartisan 
group of 50 members, just as we had 
come up with a compromise legislation 
in the same manner which would have 
helped strengthen the Affordable Care 
Act and made it more affordable. But 
in the end, despite our agreement, we 
could not get legislation on either of 
these issues to the floor. 
We had good policy for our Nation, 
which probably could have gotten the 
majority of the House to pass it, and 
possibly been able to get it through 
Senate with bipartisan support. We got 
there by bringing our constituents’ 
ideas and interests to the table, debat-
ing, 
deliberating, 
forging 
a 
com-
promise, but the rules did not give us 
an avenue to bring this agreement to 
the House. 
In the summer of 2018, when the 
Problem 
Solvers 
Caucus 
proposed 
changes to the House rules, I said this: 
‘‘Our 
Constitution 
empowered 
the 
American people by empowering Con-
gress and their representatives. But 
Congressional rules are now rigged in a 
way that greatly diminishes our ability 
to represent our constituents. This has 
resulted in a Congress that doesn’t 
work and is frozen in partisan gridlock, 
allowing the President and the courts 
to grab the power that is supposed to 
be held by the American people. By in-
stituting these proposed reforms, we 
will begin to restore this power, break 
partisan gridlock, and facilitate con-
gressional problem-solving that will 
help us build a better America for fu-
ture generations.’’ 
We made a little bit of progress in 
changing rules, but much more is need-
ed. Much more is needed to make this 
great institution work as it was in-
tended by the Framers of the Constitu-
tion to work for the American people, 
and I am hopeful that those changes 
will occur and the Problem Solvers 
Caucus will be successful in the next 
couple of weeks and in the next Con-
gress because American people need it. 
Now, despite the ways in which the 
House falls short these days, good work 
still happens here because everyone 
who gets elected to the House does so 
because they want to make a dif-
ference. And there are still ways that 
we can succeed for our constituents. 
During my time representing the 
people of the Third District of Illinois, 
I have always said that my goal every 
day was to make life a little better for 
my constituents and our country. And 
I knew that I had a whole team of 
staffers there to help me. 
Recently, as I was driving out to 
Washington, I was listening to former 
Senator Al Franken’s book, ‘‘Giant of 
the Senate.’’ As an early ‘‘Saturday 
Night Live’’ watcher, I enjoyed the 
book very much, and Senator Franken 
was very candid on a lot of things. One 
of the most important truths that 
Franken mentioned, which is rarely 
spoken around here, is that Members of 
Congress are never supposed to admit 
that their staff was responsible for an 
idea or for being indispensable in get-
ting something done. He says that he 
once publicly gave credit to a staffer 
for an idea, and he was told by a col-
league not to do that. 
It is always the Senator who has the 
idea and does the work, he was told. 
Franken thought that was wrong, and I 
agree. Maybe because I was a staffer 
before I was elected. 
So as I look back on everything that 
I have done over 16 years, I thank all 
the staff that worked for me over the 
years. These are some of the things 
that we were able to accomplish. We 
were able to author 16 laws, and I was 
the chief Democratic cosponsor on 11 
other laws. 
Promoting American manufacturing 
jobs was a priority for me, having 
grown up in and now representing the 
southwest side of Chicago. We were 
able to get signed into law the Customs 
Training Enhancement Act to stop ille-
gal goods coming into the country; the 
Small Aircraft Revitalization Act to 
help American aviation manufacturers; 
the Steel and Aluminum Energy Con-
servation and Technology Competitive-
ness Act Reauthorization to help these 
manufacturers thrive; and numerous 
Buy America provisions that we were 
able to get into transportation and 
other laws. 
Mr. Speaker, but the one I am most 
proud of is the American Manufac-
turing and Competitiveness Act, which 
took 5 years to get done but resulted in 
the 
first 
comprehensive 
American 
manufacturing strategy plan to be pro-
duced by the Federal Government since

Alexander Hamilton. It is a good plan, 
and I am hopeful that the Biden admin-
istration considers its recommenda-
tions. 
To protect the environment against 
climate change, we got the H-Prize Act 
and the BRIGHT Energy Savings Act 
into law. To protect victims of sexual 
assault in the military, we got the 
SANE Deployment Act into an NDAA. 
For veterans, we got the Purple Heart 
and Disabled Veterans Equal Access 
Act and the Tarawa MIA Recovery Act. 
As an engineer, I love the Committee 
on Science, Space, and Technology. We 
did much on that committee to in-
crease funding for scientific research 
and to boost technological innovation 
activities of the Federal Government. I 
was proud to author the National 
Science Foundation Reauthorization 
Act of 2010. NSF continues to be the 
gold standard of all international sci-
entific research and innovation agen-
cies. 
The most successful program that we 
were involved with has been the Inno-
vation Corps, or I-Corps, program. I 
was the nonstop promoter of this pro-
gram, which teaches university faculty 
and graduate students about entrepre-
neurship and has helped launched doz-
ens of startups. We were able to grow 
that program at NSF and expand it to 
many other Federal departments and 
agencies. We were also able to get an 
offshoot hacking for defense set up at 
the DOD. 
Representing the heart of the trans-
portation hub of our Nation, we were 
able to accomplish much for north-
eastern Illinois and the Nation in 
transportation. Locally, we brought 
home hundreds of millions of dollars in 
Federal money to improve local trans-
portation, including funding for roads, 
bridges, public transportation, side-
walks and bike lanes, and airports. 
We helped get a billion dollars for the 
CREATE rail modernization program 
to improve the rail network in the re-
gion and alleviate some blocked cross-
ings. We added commuter train service 
on 
Metra’s 
Heritage 
Corridor 
and 
SouthWest Service lines. We got fund-
ing for a new tower at Lewis Univer-
sity Airport and for rail underpasses in 
Bedford Park in Bridgeview. Midway 
Airport has been made safer and more 
successful as an economic engine for 
the southwest side. 
I want to thank individually the staff 
here in D.C. that made all this possible:

Sarah Pittenger, Noah Woodiwiss.

Mr. Speaker, I thank all of them for 
the great work that they have done for 
me and for the people of the Third Dis-
trict of Illinois. I was going to start 
naming Members that had helped me 
get all this work done, but I know the 
danger in this business of leaving any-
one out, so I will just thank all of my 
colleagues for the work that we have 
done together over these last 16 years. 
Back in the district, we had what I 
would argue hands down was the best 
constituent service in the Nation, 
whether it was helping constituents 
with issues related to Social Security, 
Medicare, veterans’ benefits and mili-
tary service, immigration issues, pass-
port issues, mail delivery issues, and 
many, many more issues. 
The staff included Anthony Con-
stantine, Yareli Cortez, Dawn Court-
ney, 
Salvatore 
DiFranco, 
Jessica 
Jaroch, Chris Jutton, Joseph Kirkoff, 
Jean Krupa, Josh Luke, John McGlynn, 
Frank Salerno, the late Zac Plantz, the 
late Marianne Viverito. 
Over the last few years, we have lost 
a number of staffers. It has been very 
difficult, but we have grieved together 
as a staff and we are thankful to all 
those departed staffers and their fami-
lies. 
Over the years, Jerry Hurckes was 
the chief of staff in the Chicago office 
for most of my time in Congress and he 
ran that office and ran the district for 
me. 
Lenore Goodfriend was there for 
most of my time, and she is well-loved 
by veterans across the district. 
Joe Bonomo, who is now my district 
director, has been with me for all 16 
years. Joe has done a great job. 
Paula Belmonte, who has been there 
16 years also, has helped so many im-
migrants, and we had a few that we 
saved from being deported. 
And 
last, 
but 
not 
least, 
Jerry 
Mulvihill, who was probably, I would 
argue, the best case worker in the his-
tory of the Congress. Jerry has been 
called a saint more times than I could 
ever count for all the work he did for 
so many people for so many years not 
just on Federal issues, but any issue 
that anyone ever brought to Jerry. He 
is the only staffer I know who was ever 
written up multiple times in the Chi-
cago newspaper for what he did for peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, all these people made it 
work and did so much for all the resi-
dents of the Third District, and I thank 
them so much. 
Finally, I thank my mother, who 
gave me the love of learning; and my 
father, who helped give me the love of 
politics; but above all, they both gave 
me a love of helping others, as my 
mother was a teacher and my father 
served in the Chicago City Council be-
fore he served here. 
I also thank my wife, Judy, who 
thought she was marrying a lifelong 
professor but then provided me with 
more support than I could have ever 
hoped for in this job. It is only those 
spouses of Members who know every-
thing that it takes and everything they 
go through. So I thank Judy so much 
for her support. 
Lastly, I thank the people of Illinois’ 
Third District, who gave me the honor 
and privilege of serving as their rep-
resentative. 
b 2115 
Mr. Speaker, the greatness of our Na-
tion springs from the founding prin-
ciples which sound common to us today 
but were radical for their time: ‘‘We 
hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their creator with 
certain unalienable rights, that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness.’’ 
I still believe that this is the greatest 
Nation in the history of the world. It is 
not perfect because humans aren’t per-
fect, and we cannot be perfected. But 
we must pray and work every day that 
each of us and our Nation better up-
hold the principle of equality, and we 
had better protect the life and liberty 
every day for every person, from the 
very first moment of life until natural 
death. With God’s grace, we will do 
that, and we will be that shining city 
upon the hill for all the world to see 
and follow. 
God bless this institution, and God 
bless the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ECONOMIC MIRACLE IN 2018 AND

Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Mr. 
LIPINSKI, 
being someone from the other side, you 
really are one of the good guys. I have 
had a handful of great conversations 
with you over the years. Even though I 
am a conservative from the desert, you 
have always been very kind to me, and 
your concern and love for your commu-
nity have always shone through, so it 
is appreciated. 
Mr. Speaker, this is one of those op-
portunities where you have the feeling 
you are going to be doing this a lot 
over this next year. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make an argu-
ment that growth is moral, and I want 
to go a bit further than that. One of 
the things that spurred me to come 
here is I listened to Janet Yellen just a

December 8, 2020 
speech. In that speech, there were won-
derful words about caring about work-
ing men and women, helping the work-
ing poor, but there was a complete fail-
ure in that discussion to talk about 
where we have had success. 
Look, so many people in this body 
run around saying, well, you are con-
servative, you are liberal, but we care 
about the hardworking taxpayers of 
America. We want to see our brothers 
and sisters in the country, particularly 
those who—and I hate this term, and it 
is one of the hazards as a Republican. 
We often sound like accountants on 
steroids. You know, we will go and say, 
well, our brothers and sisters who are 
in the lower income quartiles—and no 
one knows what a quartile is. 
But the point, we claim we care. We 
claim we want to do things. I want to 
claim we have the proof that, in 2018 
and 2019, there was a miracle hap-
pening in this country. 
For the first time in modern eco-
nomic history of the United States, the 
thing particularly the left used to 
scream at Republicans, because they 
cared so much about income inequal-
ity, I am going to make the argument 
we delivered policy, that, for the first 
time, 
income 
inequality 
began 
to 
shrink, 2 years where it worked. 
As the demagoguery, which is the 
modern political scene, as we hear peo-
ple like the Janet Yellens of the world, 
who I have had a great working rela-
tionship with over the years, read their 
script and don’t take a moment to say 
what worked in just the last couple of 
years, what worked to help so many of 
our American citizens have oppor-
tunity, to see a light at the end of the 
tunnel, to stop seeing the purchasing 
power of their lives, their ability to 
plan for retirement, the ability to take 
care of their families and their kids. 
Even outside the political rage that 
drives this body so often, could we take 
a moment and understand America was 
doing something it had not been able 
to do for decades and decades and dec-
ades, where the income inequality, the 
movement of wages, the value of some-
one’s labor, had been being crushed 
decade after decade? In 2018 and 2019, 
the data is absolutely solid and clear: 
There was an economic miracle hap-
pening in this country. 
If you care about the working poor, 
take a look at what happened, and let’s 
do more of it. Those things that 
weren’t working in the previous years, 
let’s do less of it. The problem is, in 
this environment, that becomes par-
tisan. 
Let’s walk through some of the facts. 
This is my moment to get a little 
snarky at my colleagues from the 
other side and some of their comments 
they have made. Those of us on our 
side are looking for our apology be-
cause they didn’t tell the truth. They 
projected the future. 
This is when Speaker PELOSI then 
was the minority leader. She, basi-
cally, when we did the tax reform, after 
calling it a scam and then, in her 
quote, saying making the rich richer, 
except that is not what happened. The 
math is the math is the math. I know 
it doesn’t fit the political rhetoric of 
this place, but the math is the math. 
If you take a look at the highest in-
come quartiles, their percentage of the 
income, the wealth actually went down 
in 2018 and 2019, something that had 
not happened in modern economic his-
tory. 
You would have thought the Demo-
crats would say, hey, we got it wrong, 
but we really care a lot about this, be-
cause they claim they care a lot about 
it. So why don’t we look at some of the 
other reality. 
My colleagues on the Ways and 
Means Committee on the other side, 
the 
House 
Democrats, 
kept 
doing 
speeches. I just snipped one of the 
quotes: You know, the one-time bo-
nuses are nice, but what American 
workers really deserve are permanent 
wage increases. The true beneficiaries 
of the Republican tax bills are share-
holders and top corporate executives, 
not the middle class. 
It turns out they were absolutely 
wrong. And the math is the math is the 
math. The facts are the facts. If you look at 
the population—and we even broke this 
down—you could see wage increases for Afri-
can Americans were the fastest movement 
growth in modern times. When I say modern 
times, I mean like the last 50 years. His-
panics outpaced Anglo workers rather dra-
matically. 
Do you think those of us on the Re-
publican side are ever going to get an 
apology for them making up things? 
Why don’t we go on and just make it 
for gender? It turns out that 2018 and 
2019, movement in wage growth was 
miraculous. There should have been joy 
in this body if you care about the 
working poor. It turns out that wage 
growth for females, particularly fe-
males who didn’t have a high school 
education, was remarkable. 
I believe in the ending part of 2018, 
when they did the calculation here, it 
was over 7 percent wage growth be-
cause their labor had value. We lived in 
a society that actually had more jobs 
than people. 
I will argue that has to be all of our 
goal. People’s work, their labor, be-
came valuable. I desperately hope we 
start to focus on how we get back to 
that. 
I know some of these charts are hard 
to read. We will put them up on our 
website. And I want to compliment the 
team over at the Joint Economic Com-
mittee for helping me do this. But this 
one and the next one are important be-
cause it is a simple fact that the rhet-
oric after tax reform from the left, 
they made things up. By doing that, 
they hurt so many Americans. 
If we had been honest about the 
facts—it would be intellectually honest 
if my colleagues on the other side 
would step up and say, okay, yeah, it is 
really, really helping the working poor. 
It is really helping the working Ameri-
cans. But we think we can do it better. 
That would be honest. God bless 
them, that would be honest. But to say 
it was hurting them was a lie. 
Here is a simple example. 2017, before 
tax reform, if we—we always compare 
and talk about the top quartile, the top 
1 percent of income earners. They were 
controlling, I think, slightly over 20 
percent, 21 percent, of all the income in 
the country, and they were paying 
about 38.5 percent of all the Federal in-
come taxes. 
What happened after tax reform? 
How many times did we hear from the 
left, from the leftwing echo chamber, 
from the media, that, well, this was tax 
cuts for the rich? Well, a year later, 
when there was tax reform, 2018, the 
top 1 percent were no longer paying 
38.5 percent of the Federal income 
taxes. Now, they are paying over 40 
percent of the Federal income taxes, 
but yet their control of the wage, of 
the wealth, income wealth, actually 
went down. 
But what was more important—and 
this is my failing—we don’t talk 
enough about it. We will call it the bot-
tom 50 percent of our brothers and sis-
ters that we claim we represent, that 
we claim, when we get behind these 
microphones, we care about. There, the 
bottom 50 percent, their tax burden ac-
tually decreased, but the percentage of 
the wages went up. 
This is only 2018. The 2019 numbers 
haven’t been vetted because they are 
still not all in yet. Our understanding 
is, preliminarily, the curve even steep-
ens. The fact of the matter is, there 
was an economic miracle happening in 
2018 and 2019. If you care about people, 
we need to figure out what we were 
doing right and go back and do more of 
it. 
Another way to basically say the 
same thing, this is—and forgive me if I 
mispronounce the name. Is it Ms. 
Tanden who may become the OMB Di-
rector? She is the potential OMB nomi-
nee. She said some incredibly partisan 
things that were wrong. The lift-out 
quote here is: Because they practice 
class warfare against us. 
Well, actually, no. It is just the oppo-
site. If you look at the math, the top 10 
percent under the old tax system were 
paying less of the Federal tax burden 
than they did after tax reform. Our 
brothers and sisters, the other 90 per-
cent of the income-earners in this 
country, were paying less of the Fed-
eral tax burden after tax reform. The 
math is the math. But the rhetoric is 
toxic and didn’t tell the truth. Once 
again, then-Minority Leader NANCY 
PELOSI: Widening the income inequal-
ity gap. 
Except the fact is, the Republican 
tax reform along with some of the 
other policies that came about in 2018 
and 2019 were the first time in modern 
economic history where income in-
equality actually shrank. 
I always thought that was the holy 
grail here, that the rich keep getting 
richer and the poor keep getting poor-
er—except after tax reform, except 
after some of the regulatory reform.

If you care about working men and 
women in this country, if you care 
about the working poor, you have a 
template that is only a year in the past 
where it was working. 
Let’s figure out what we were doing 
right, and, Mr. Speaker, let’s go back 
and do more of it. The one thing I will 
beg of this body, as the Democrats look 
like they will continue to be in the ma-

POOR TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT 
OF TEXAS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) 
until 10 p.m. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, and tonight I would like 
to initiate this event with some words 
of thanks for the many people who 
work late into the night with us. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of 
them for what they do and for staying 
here for the duration. And there are 
other persons who are without this fa-
cility who are also here until we leave, 
so I thank them for what they do. 
I also, tonight, would like to make 
note of the Houston Chronicle. That is 
the largest newspaper in Houston, 
Texas. And I would like to thank the 
Houston Chronicle for exercising some 
of its courage and some of its wisdom 
in terms of what it has produced with 
some of the news stories as of late. 
The Houston Chronicle has printed 
two stories that I would like to focus 
on tonight. They are about policing in 
the State of Texas. 
I have two documents that I include 
in the RECORD. They both deal with po-
licing in Texas. The first one is styled: 
‘‘Blistering Government Report Blasts 
Poor Training, Oversight of Texas Law 
Enforcement.’’ The second one is an 
editorial, 
titled: 
‘‘Editorial: 
Hairstylists Get More Training Than 
Texas Cops? That’s Unacceptable.’’ 
[From Houston Chronicle Local, Nov. 30, 
2020] 
BLISTERING
GOVERNMENT
REPORT
BLASTS 
POOR TRAINING, OVERSIGHT OF TEXAS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
(By St. John Barned-Smith and Eric 
Dexheimer.) 
Last year, more than 600 Texas law en-
forcement officers received a dishonorable 
discharge from their agencies for mis-
conduct. Yet more than a quarter of them 
were rehired to work as sworn officers. 
To qualify for a peace officer license, Texas 
cops need fewer hours of basic training than 
licensed cosmetologists and less than half 
the education required of air-conditioning 
and refrigeration contractors. While the 
basic training requires officers to spend 48 
hours on the firing range, it demands only 
two hours of ‘‘civilian interaction’’ instruc-
tion. 
The difficulty of purging bad officers from 
the ranks of Texas police and outdated and 
inadequate officer training highlight how 
state lawmakers have rendered the Texas 
Commission on Law Enforcement unable to 
meaningfully oversee the profession, accord-
ing to a blistering new report by the Sunset 
Advisory Commission. The commission re-
views the performance of state agencies 
every 10 years or so. 
The Sunset Advisory Commission’s critical 
findings come amid a contentious nation-
wide re-evaluation of the fundamental role 
of police. The deaths of Sandra Bland, Eric 
Garner, Tamir Rice and George Floyd, 
among others, have prompted calls for 
stronger oversight from police departments 
and civilian review boards, as well as stricter 
limits on police use of force. 
But in Texas, the regulation of law en-
forcement is ‘‘by and large, toothless,’’ the 
Sunset report concluded. 
Although it is charged with licensing po-
lice and correctional officers and 911 dis-
patchers, the law enforcement commission 
differs from state agencies that regulate 
other professions in that it has almost no au-
thority to act against an officer’s license. In-
stead, most oversight of police conduct is 
left up to each of the state’s 2,700 law en-
forcement agencies, which set their own 
policies and standards. 
Without a shared definition of professional 
conduct, many have widely differing rules. 
For example, ‘‘In the Dallas-Fort Worth 
metroplex, chokeholds are an acceptable 
technique west of the 3200 block of Sandy 
Lane, but are not allowed on the east side of 
the same street because it crosses two dif-
ferent . . . jurisdictions,’’ the Sunset report 
found. 
Texas’ patchwork of uneven oversight has 
resulted in ‘‘a fragmented, outdated system 
with poor accountability, lack of statewide 
standards, and inadequate training,’’ the 
Sunset report stated. 
While advocacy groups and demonstrators 
have demanded better police oversight, they 
also have called on cities to reallocate mil-
lions of dollars from law enforcement budg-
ets into community services. That, in turn, 
has sparked swift blowback from conserv-
ative politicians and supporters of law en-
forcement. In Austin, a lawmaker recently 
filed legislation prohibiting local govern-
ments from cutting police budgets. 
Washington-based criminologist Matthew 
Hickman said the protests and impassioned 
conversations about police reform have re-
vealed holes in how municipalities, states 
and the federal government oversee law en-
forcement officers. 
Accountability starts at the department 
level, he said, with internal affairs investiga-
tion. At the other end, in the most egregious 
circumstances, the Department of Justice 
can pursue civil rights investigations against 
problem departments. 
Charley Wilkison, executive director of the 
Combined Law Enforcement Associations of 
Texas, said the Sunset report was just the 
beginning of the process of state lawmakers’ 
evaluation of the law enforcement commis-
sion. Legislators will hold hearings next year 
and almost certainly change some of the 
Sunset staff’s recommendations. 
‘‘What you’re seeing there is not going to 
be state law,’’ he said. While his organization 
agreed some changes were needed, he said, it 
opposed 
granting 
the 
state 
commission 
sweeping new enforcement powers to inves-
tigate and discipline officers. 
Still, policing watchdogs said the report’s 
findings rang true. ‘‘Right now, it definitely 
feels like at the state level, there’s little to 
no regulation of law enforcement that’s hap-
pening,’’ said Chris Harris of the nonprofit 
public 
interest 
justice 
center 
Texas 
Appleseed, ‘‘and to the extent there is, it’s 
not effective.’’ 
And one key Houston-area legislator said 
he was inclined to make some changes. Re-
forms to the agency are ‘‘long overdue,’’ said 
state Sen. John Whitmire, D–Houston, who 
said the Texas law enforcement commission 
should operate more like other regulatory 
boards such as the State Bar of Texas or the 
State Board of Pharmacy. 
The report was notable for its sweepingly 
critical evaluation of nearly every facet of 
the agency, calling its regulation of the pro-
fession ‘‘fundamentally broken.’’ It said the 
changes it recommended were stopgap and 
called for legislators to form a blue ribbon 
committee ‘‘to comprehensively look at how 
the state regulates law enforcement and rec-
ommend needed changes to improve law en-
forcement regulation in Texas.’’ 
It took particular note of the state’s in-
ability to discipline officers for misconduct. 
It pointed to a recent incident in which the 
San Antonio Police Department fired an offi-
cer for giving a homeless man a sandwich 
filled with dog feces. Yet the officer, Mat-
thew Luckhurst, was able to return to the 
force. He was later fired—for good—after an-
other feces-related incident. 
The example highlighted the Texas Com-
mission on Law Enforcement’s limited au-
thority to take any action against an offi-
cer’s state license. The agency may act only 
when officers fail to complete mandatory 
continued education, if they are convicted of 
or received deferred adjudication for felonies 
or certain misdemeanors, or if they receive a 
second dishonorable discharge. The agency 
has even less authority to sanction indi-
vidual law enforcement agencies. 
Roger Goldman, retired law professor from 
the Saint Louis University School of Law, 
said that about two-thirds of states have 
stronger oversight abilities at the state level 
than Texas, and that in many states, officers 
can have their licenses revoked for mis-
conduct even if they haven’t been convicted 
of a crime. 
Many states across the country are taking 
other tacks to try to prevent bad officers 
from getting hired at other departments 
after allegations of gross misconduct. 
Some states are now requiring depart-
ments to screen candidates more rigorously. 
In Vermont, for example, lawmakers passed 
a bill requiring departments to provide infor-
mation about why they fired officers to 
other departments when those officers try to 
get new jobs. In Connecticut, lawmakers im-
plemented rules requiring regulators to cre-
ate a list of officers fired for serious mis-
conduct but whose licenses were not decerti-
fied. The list prevented officers from being 
rehired by other departments, Goldman said. 
Matt Simpson, with the ACLU of Texas, 
said that while the Sunset review rec-
ommended a panel to study needed changes,

lawmakers in the meantime should ‘‘ensure 
public safety is not threatened’’ by unquali-
fied cops and pass reforms to give the law en-
forcement commission more authority to 
discipline officers dishonorably discharged, 
as well as empower the agency to sanction 
law enforcement agencies that ‘‘fail to hold 
up their end of the bargain in hiring and 
training qualified law enforcement officers.’’ 
Simpson also urged the Legislature to pass 
reforms that set statewide use of force stand-
ards and require a focus on de-escalation and 
proportional response; require officers to in-
tervene if they witness other officers using 
excessive force; and pass citation require-
ments for low-level offenses. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Dec. 7, 2020] 
EDITORIAL: HAIRSTYLISTS GET MORE TRAIN-
ING THAN TEXAS COPS? THAT’S UNACCEPT-
ABLE 
(The Editorial Board) 
People who call the police for help in a life 
and death situation have every right to ex-
pect the responding officer to be at least as 
well-trained and professional as the person 
who cuts their hair or fixes their air condi-
tioner. 
We should have similar assurances that the 
deputy pulling us over for speeding or the 
jailer locking the cell door holding a murder 
suspect are being held accountable to local 
and state legal standards that preserve life, 
safety and civil liberties. 
That may not be the case in Texas, accord-
ing to a harshly critical report from the Sun-
set Advisory Commission, the oversight body 
the Legislature created to ensure state gov-
ernment agencies remain effective or be shut 
down. 
The study showed that the Texas Commis-
sion on Law Enforcement, the organization 
responsible for licensing peace officers and 
regulating state and local police agencies, 
hasn’t been able to effectively hold police or 
their departments to sufficient standards. It 
found that ‘‘Texas’’ approach has resulted in 
a fragmented, outdated system with poor ac-
countability, lack of statewide standards, 
and inadequate training.’’ 
In the wake of the 2015 jail death of Sandra 
Bland in Waller County, the carnage of the 
2019 botched Harding Street raid in Houston 
and the death in Austin later that year of 
Javier Ambler after a police stop, scrutiny of 
police practices and policies is long overdue. 
The Sunset report only increases the ur-
gency for Houston to move forward on recent 
recommendations for reform at HPD and for 
Texas to make fundamental changes at the 
state level. 
The Sunset process, which begins with the 
staff recommendations, will eventually re-
quire lawmakers to pass new enabling legis-
lation for the agencies under review or allow 
them to close. That’s powerful leverage for 
lawmakers who believe, as we do, that the 
Legislature should overhaul the way the 
state certifies and regulates the 155,000 peace 
officers, jailers, emergency telecommuni-
cations operators and school marshals oper-
ating within 2,700 local law enforcement 
agencies across Texas. 
The report makes clear that the current 
system too often allows officers fired from 
one department to get hired by another, fails 
to provide the basic levels of instruction 
needed to support the demands of a fast- 
changing profession and does not adequately 
inform the public about a government serv-
ice that is crucial to daily life and safety. 
A new state system needs to focus on 
transparency, training and true account-
ability. That isn’t the case now. 
The Sunset report found that Texas re-
quires more time in basic training for cos-
metologists (1,000 hours) than for cops (696 
hours). Air conditioning and refrigeration 
contractors, meanwhile, have to put in 2,000 
hours of training to get licensed. The Hous-
ton Police Department requires at least 48 
semester hours of college credit for prospec-
tive officers but a high school diploma or 
GED is enough in other parts of the state. 
The type of training officers receive is also 
out of whack with real world demands. Re-
quiring 48 hours for firearms training and 40 
hours for instruction in arrest, search and 
seizure is appropriate, but the regimen also 
includes four hours of work on interacting 
with canines while requiring only two hours 
on interacting with civilians. 
The standard Basic Peace Officer Course 
includes only four hours for education on 
‘‘Family Violence, Child Victims, and Re-
lated Assaultive Offenses’’ and no special 
training for dealing with rape victims. 
The fact that larger departments in places 
such as Houston, Dallas and Harris County 
mandate, at local expense, more and special-
ized training for officers only points out how 
much it is needed as a basic state standard. 
This isn’t about creating a one-size-fits-all 
program. It’s about certifying officers have 
the knowledge and skills to do vital, dan-
gerous and demanding jobs. The officers 
themselves will be the first beneficiaries of 
these stepped-up training requirements. The 
patchwork approach leaves standards for po-
licing to vary across the state’s 254 counties, 
1,200 cities and other jurisdictions, depending 
on widely disparate resources, department 
culture and current leadership attitudes 
about training. That’s not how the law is 
supposed to work. 
The Sunset report also raises questions 
about TCOLE’s ability to protect the public 
from bad cops, including the way background 
checks are done and how information about 
firings is handled. 
More than 600 Texas law enforcement offi-
cers received a dishonorable discharge for 
misconduct last year with more than a quar-
ter of them being rehired to work as sworn 
officers with their original departments or 
elsewhere in the state. TCOLE is barred from 
revoking a license except in cases of a crimi-
nal conviction or after a second dishonorable 
discharge. 
That unwisely precludes an independent 
review by an agency that is supposed to be 
upholding statewide standards. 
None of this is good for the public, which 
deserves consistent and competent policing, 
nor for the officers who deserve professional 
training and the respect that comes with it. 
The Sunset Commission concludes that the 
current system isn’t working and rec-
ommends a blue ribbon panel to rethink how 
Texas handles law enforcement regulation. 
Fine. But more study is not enough. Law-
makers should hear from experts about what 
it can do this session, beginning in January, 
to strengthen TCOLE so that Texans can 
count on a police force that is properly 
trained, a process that is publicly trans-
parent and a system that guards the public 
trust through robust oversight. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start with this one on the 
‘‘Blistering Government Report Blasts 
Poor Training Oversight of Texas Law 
Enforcement.’’ This is from the Hous-
ton Chronicle. 
The Houston Chronicle indicates: 
‘‘Last year, more than 600 Texas law 
enforcement officers received a dishon-
orable discharge from their agencies 
for misconduct. Yet more than a quar-
ter of them were rehired to work as 
sworn officers. 
‘‘To qualify for a peace officer li-
cense, Texas cops need fewer hours of 
basic training than licensed cosmetolo-
gists and less than half the education 
required of air-conditioning and refrig-
eration contractors. While the basic 
training requires officers to spend 48 
hours on the firing range, it demands 
only 2 hours of ‘civilian interaction’ in-
struction.’’ 
Some things bear repeating: 48 hours 
on the firing range and 2 hours of civil-
ian interaction instruction. 
Something has got to change, and I 
am pleased to see that the Chronicle is 
a part of the movement to bring about 
the change, the reform that is nec-
essary. 
This story goes on to read, and it is 
dated, by the way, November 30, 2020, 
at 10:16 a.m., when it was last updated. 
It goes on to indicate: ‘‘ . . . in 
Texas, the regulation of law enforce-
ment is ‘by and large, toothless.’’’ 
This is from a sunset committee re-
port. 
I want to focus for just a moment 
now on why this is so important to me. 
I have a constituent, a constituent 
who has made his transition, and it is 
because of an encounter with a peace 
officer in the State of Texas. I want to 
talk about Joshua Johnson and how 
the death of Joshua Johnson has had 
an impact on my life and, I believe, on 
the lives of many others who are famil-
iar with this story. 
I believe his case is one for us to ex-
amine another way of taking these 
cases of questionable shootings by po-
lice before the authorities. 
In the case of Joshua Johnson, he 
was a 35-year-old Black man, and at 6 
a.m. on April 22, Joshua Johnson was 
housesitting for a neighbor. He went 
out of his home, or that home, and he 
went out into the street. He had an en-
counter with a peace officer who was 
there. 
Much has been said about the en-
counter, but what I will tell you now is 
based on facts, because we have an ac-
tual recording of what an officer has 
said that, in my opinion, has corrupted 
this investigation. 
Joshua had this encounter, and as a 
result, he was shot twice. He, later on, 
died. 
But let’s not continue from this 
point. Let’s step back for just a mo-
ment. 
His parents lived within yards of 
where he died. His father took his 
mother to work that morning, and 
when he returned, his son had lost his 
life. He acquired the opportunity to go 
and bring his wife to the area near the 
scene, and there was an investigating 
officer there. 
This officer took it upon himself to 
explain to the Bearys—these are the 
parents of Joshua, Ms. Wilhelmena 
Beary and Mr. Richard Beary. He took 
it upon himself to tell them what the 
facts were. 
He told them that their son ap-
proached this officer who was in a car, 
a vehicle, and that this officer told 
their son to lower a pistol. It was a BB 
pistol, according to the report. The son

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7042 
December 8, 2020 
had his phone flashlight on. He did not 
lower the pistol, and as a result, he was 
shot twice and he was killed. 
Now, the officer that called this to 
the attention of the Bearys did not 
talk to the officer who did the shoot-
ing. He did not have the benefit of a 
video recording. He did not have the 
benefit of an autopsy report because 
one had not been performed. This was 
just 2 hours after Joshua’s death. 
He did not have the benefit of a bal-
listics report. He did not talk to the 
medical examiner before making these 
statements. There was no way for him 
to know what he would say, but he said 
it, and it has become the narrative for 
Joshua’s death. 
This officer who shot Joshua twice— 
and this is the part that will tear at 
your heart—he shot Joshua twice and 
drove away, shot him twice and left the 
scene and drove away and went around 
the corner. 
If he shot him because he was in fear 
of his life, and this is typically what is 
said, should he not have concern for 
the lives of people in that neighbor-
hood that he was sworn to protect? 
Joshua didn’t die immediately, but 
he did die within some short time after 
he was shot. 
So the Bearys find themselves being 
told how their son died by someone 
who didn’t see it, didn’t have a video 
recording of it, didn’t have an autopsy 
report, didn’t have a ballistics report, 
didn’t talk to the medical examiner. 
They had someone who literally gave 
them a story that some conclude was 
made up. 
Can you imagine? Your son is on the 
ground. Your son is there. You can’t go 
over and see your son. And you are told 
that your son has died because he 
pulled a BB pistol on a peace officer. 
This is important in terms of what 
the officer said because of this train-
ing: 2 hours of civilian interaction in-
struction, not nearly enough. 
That officer who was investigating 
should have been better trained such 
that he would not have told this story 
without having more of the actual 
facts, such that what he would tell 
them they could believe. 
No ballistics report. No autopsy re-
port. No conversation with the medical 
examiner. Didn’t talk to the officer 
who shot Joshua. Yet he told them 
that these were the facts in terms of 
how their son had lost his life. 
This officer needed better training. 
Unfortunately, in Texas, they are not 
getting this training at this time, and 
I am proud of the Chronicle for point-
ing it out. 
But he also needs training in terms 
of how you present yourself and how 
you protect the people in the neighbor-
hood that he was in. 
Let’s talk about the shooter. 
How can a police officer shoot a per-
son twice, not be fired upon, and sim-
ply drive away? It makes no sense. 
Drive away. 
If you believe that this person was a 
threat, wouldn’t you want to protect 
the people that you are sworn to pro-
tect and defend by staying there, or 
wouldn’t you call for additional help? 
You shoot him twice and you leave. 
Joshua died. 
There is more to the story, but my 
point tonight is this. The Houston 
Chronicle has apparently decided that 
enough is enough and that there should 
be better policing in the State of 
Texas. 
I have decided that there is another 
way to deal with these cases. The 
grand jury is one means by which we 
can take cases to court, but there is 
another way. 
In Texas, we have something called 
the court of inquiry. I believe that it is 
time for us to use this tool, the court 
of inquiry, to get the facts and have 
transparency such that the public can 
understand what is happening, that 
they cannot acquire intelligence on 
when these cases go before a grand jury 
because it is all sworn to secrecy. No 
one can tell you what happened before 
the grand jury. Maybe the district at-
torney can give you some semblance of 
what happened. 
But the court of inquiry allows any 
person who believes that a crime has 
been committed to go before a district 
judge and explain what the facts are. 
And if that judge believes that there is 
probable cause to believe that a crime 
has been committed, then that judge 
goes to another judge, an administra-
tive judge, and makes an appeal to the 
administrative judge to convene the 
court of inquiry, then a third judge will 
actually conduct the court of inquiry. 
I think that in the State of Texas, 
because of the training—or the absence 
thereof—as it relates to our peace offi-
cers, this court of inquiry is going to 
be of great benefit as we move forward. 
It is time to change the paradigm. 
Simply allowing these cases to go be-
fore a grand jury and never know what 
actually happened is not enough. 
I believe that the Houston Chronicle 
has set a proper course for us to move 
in a direction that will change policing 
in the State of Texas, and I would in-
vite persons to please read these two 
articles that I have called to your at-
tention. 
Mr. Speaker, I leave you and all who 
are listening with these words: 
Joshua Johnson shouldn’t have lost 
his life that morning. 
Joshua Johnson shouldn’t be another 
statistic. 
Joshua should be with his parents. 
My prayer is that these parents will 
receive the justice they deserve be-
cause they have been waiting approxi-
mately 230 days for some decision from 
law enforcement, and they have not 
had that decision. 
There is some hope. The district at-
torney’s office is moving forward with 
an investigation. My prayer is that 
this family will receive the justice that 
they 
deserve 
because 
their 
son 
shouldn’t have lost his life on the 22nd 
of April this year at approximately 6 
a.m. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2020 
No. 207 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Heavenly Father, keep us from dis-
appointing You. Inspire us in all we say 
and do to glorify You. Empower our 
Senators to strive to please You in 
their every thought and action. 
Lord, we acknowledge that You are 
our rock of safety and our fortress dur-
ing every season of distress. Give our 
lawmakers the wisdom to honor Your 
Name in their work, entrusting You to 
take care of all their tomorrows. Set 
them in a safe place because of Your 
unfailing love and faithfulness. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM HARKIN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
long before he was sworn into the U.S. 
Senate, my former colleague, Tom Har-
kin from Iowa, served in the U.S. Navy 
in Vietnam. He and I represented 
Iowans for 30 years together here in the 
U.S. Senate. 
Six years ago, I came to the floor to 
wish my friend well in retirement, and 
I used these words: [So that he could] 
enjoy the blessings of hearth and home. 
Now, I am not so sure that he took 
my advice to heart. I recently learned 
that Tom has been moonlighting in re-
tirement as an intrepid crew member 
sailing the icy waters of the North At-
lantic. In fact, he joined the crew of 59 
North Sailing for five voyages. His 
most recent adventure found Tom 
aboard Ice Bear navigating gale force 
winds in and around the rugged coast-
line of Newfoundland. 
They say you can’t take the farm out 
of an Iowa farm kid. The same must be 
true for a lifelong sailor and the sea. 
Tom recently celebrated his 81st 
birthday in November. Barbara and I 
wish him many more trips around the 
Sun and as many adventures at sea 
that his heart desires. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, some Senators indicate they 
may attempt to move a privileged reso-
lution to disapprove of the administra-
tion’s proposed sale of advanced arma-
ments to the United Arab Emirates, a 
critical partner in our fight against 
terrorists. It is a little baffling to sug-
gest that now, of all times, a protest 
gesture with no chance of obtaining a 
veto-proof majority is of valuable use 
of the Senate’s time. But above and be-
yond that, the strategic realities dic-
tate that Congress should not stand in 
the way of this sale. 
In August, the UAE reached the first 
of the Abraham Accords, the landmark 
peace deal with Israel, brokered by the 
Trump administration, which Bahrain 
soon went on to reprise. That step, the 
first normalization of relations be-
tween the Arab nation and the State of 
Israel in nearly 30 years, cemented an 
important new chapter in the UAE’s 
international relations and its close re-
lationship with the United States. 
Of course, it is a key American objec-
tive to preserve and protect Israel’s 
quantitative 
military 
edge. 
Fortu-
nately, Israel’s Ambassador, Defense 
Minister, and Prime Minister have all 
made sure they are comfortable with 
this deal. 
Senators considering this sale need 
to consider a reality we cannot escape. 
A significant competition for influence 
in the Middle East is underway, and 
China and Russia will be more than 
happy to meet the demand for ad-
vanced capabilities if the United States 
simply takes our ball and goes home. 
If our colleagues make the Senate 
vote on this measure, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote against it. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ENZI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on an entirely different matter, 
my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate 
are, to put it mildly, an impressive 
bunch. It always makes it a challenge 
to pay adequate tribute when one 
leaves our ranks. 
But even by the high standards of 
this place, the course charted by the 
Senator, whom I have to send off this 
morning, stands out. The senior Sen-
ator from Wyoming, Senator MIKE 
ENZI, has accomplished enough in one 
career to fill two. He seemingly glided 
from business success to military serv-
ice, to local government, to State poli-
tics, to the U.S. Senate, where he has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7248 
December 8, 2020 
built a remarkably productive legisla-
tive record. 
MIKE’s prolific career began in a 
small town. In fact, Gillette, WY, was 
so small when MIKE and his wife Diana 
arrived and stood up the family busi-
ness, the town still carried the less- 
than-flattering nickname of ‘‘Dirt.’’ 
But new discoveries in the American 
energy business were in the course of 
changing everything. A major oil and 
gas boom meant more people. More 
people meant more sales at MIKE’s NZ 
Shoes store—that is the letter ‘‘N’’ and 
the letter ‘‘Z.’’ 
MIKE could have just sat back and 
cruised, but MIKE saw Gillette strug-
gling to keep up with the growth, and 
basic services were lagging. Nearly ev-
eryone who encountered him in town 
or in the junior chamber of commerce 
meetings concluded this up-and-comer 
had real leadership talent. I understand 
the final prod into public service came 
from no less a Wyoming statesman, our 
own former colleague, Al Simpson. 
They had crossed paths. Alan had 
heard MIKE speak. He took the prom-
ising young man aside to tell him rath-
er pointedly that his town sure did 
need a good mayor. To be precise, MIKE 
tells us the phrasing was typically 
blunt Al Simpson: ‘‘Put your money 
where your mouth is.’’ 
Our future colleague took it under 
advisement. But MIKE
almost didn’t 
survive long enough to announce his 
campaign. The way he told it on the 
floor last week, when he worked up the 
courage to relay that suggestion to 
Diana on their long drive home, she al-
most swerved right off the road. Fortu-
nately, they were unharmed, and the 
more they talked, the more they liked 
the idea of making a difference. 
So, at the ripe old age of 30, this up- 
and-coming 
businessman 
ran 
for 
mayor, and he won. On his watch, what 
could have been a municipal disaster 
became an economic golden age for Gil-
lette. It didn’t take long for the town’s 
fortunes to become the talk of political 
minds around Wyoming. 
After a few years off, the former 
Mayor ENZI was representing his neigh-
bors as State representative and then 
as State senator. And just like water 
seeks its own level, talent tends to 
seek its best outlet. So, after squeak-
ing out a close primary victory over 
his now-fellow Senator from Wyoming, 
JOHN BARRASSO, MIKE packed his bags 
for Washington in late 1996, and this 
body gained, at that time, its only 
trained accountant. 
Now, MIKE knew that if he was going 
to properly serve his beloved State, he 
would need fellow Wyomingites work-
ing alongside him—people who shared 
his no-nonsense affection for careful 
planning and thrift in government. 
One of his best decisions was per-
suading his longtime collaborator, the 
onetime town manager of Gillette, Flip 
McConnaughey, to move to Washington 
and be his chief of staff. MIKE says he 
initially had 500 applications for that 
job, but none of them was the one he 
wanted. The experienced salesman had 
to pitch his longtime friend on the 
opening, and it worked. 
From Gillette to the Senate, Flip was 
MIKE’s secret weapon—not just a staff-
er, but as MIKE tells it, a true partner 
in service for many years. When Flip 
passed away much too soon in 2016, this 
entire institution felt the loss. 
MIKE’s staff likes to say he has a 
whole collection of useful hats he can 
wear to approach Senate business: the 
perspective of a mayor or of a small 
business owner or a State legislator or 
an accountant or a Wyomingite. Well, 
that hasn’t just been a winning com-
bination for the people of Wyoming. It 
has benefited our entire country. 
MIKE’s trade secret has been what he 
calls the 80–20 rule. Across all the 
issues he tackled, he insists about four- 
fifths of the subject matter is potential 
common ground ripe for progress. He 
said: You just can’t let the controver-
sial 20 percent blow everything up. 
Well, that approach made our col-
league from Wyoming downright pro-
lific. MIKE has been directly respon-
sible for the passage of more than 100 
bills. He has become a go-to leader on 
everything from budget, tax reform, 
and the deficit to AIDS relief and 
workplace safety. His sober, prudent 
approach—not to mention his practical 
experience keeping the books and mak-
ing payroll—made MIKE
exactly the 
sort of person taxpayers hope are man-
aging their dollars. 
He used budget resolutions to steer 
the Federal Government toward more 
sustainable fiscal help. He helped shep-
herd the first major overhaul of the 
Federal Tax Code in a generation. He 
has keep a watchful eye on the unin-
tended 
consequences 
of 
legislation, 
such as the recent work to help relieve 
Main Street lenders from the one-size- 
fits-all burden of Dodd-Frank. 
Back when Chairman ENZI was steer-
ing the HELP Committee, his Demo-
cratic counterpart was Ted Kennedy—a 
fastidious small-government guy from 
Wyoming and the ‘‘liberal lion’’ from 
Massachusetts. Call it the 80–20 rule’s 
final exam, and they passed that exam. 
They worked together to create bipar-
tisan outcomes on things like worker 
safety, pension reform, and mental 
health parity. 
So, to be clear, there has been no 
lack of conservative conviction in 
MIKE’s career. Just ask our Democratic 
colleagues about the times their de-
bates with MIKE landed in the 20 per-
cent, and that is when the gloves came 
off. This is the Senator one broadcaster 
in 2013 called ‘‘the Paul Revere of 
ObamaCare.’’ 
But MIKE never lost sight of the mis-
sion. He kept up the hunt for common 
ground, autism research, vocational 
training, and carried the torch for 
PEPFAR, the historic fight against 
AIDS in Africa. 
MIKE’s insatiable appetite for making 
a difference brought some interesting 
characters into his life. It turned out 
that quite a few high-profile celebrities 
were happy to meet with one of this 
body’s chief champions on the AIDS 
issue. 
But let the record reflect that east 
coast, 
Washington, 
DC, 
life 
never 
spoiled MIKE. I heard from a reliable 
source that after wrapping up one 
meeting with Bono, the world-famous 
front man of U2 and a leader in the 
fight against AIDS, MIKE cheerfully of-
fered the following parting remark to 
the well-established superstar: ‘‘Well 
. . . good luck with the band!’’ 
If you have seen MIKE
in action 
around the Senate—devouring details, 
mastering issue after issue—it is hard 
to imagine him making time for much 
of anything outside his work. But you 
would be badly mistaken, because one 
of the worst kept secrets around the 
Capitol is that MIKE is one of the very 
warmest Members of the Senate fam-
ily. 
As we prepare to bid him farewell, 
MIKE’s colleagues may miss his wise 
leadership on legislation, but I suspect 
the loss will be greater for future class-
es of Senate pages, who will be denied 
the pizza and ice creams parties MIKE 
threw to celebrate their successes. The 
staff at a favorite nearby Mexican res-
taurant will miss a couple who, along 
with the Barrassos and the Grassleys, 
spent years ranked among their most 
devoted weekly visitors. 
More than anything, I know the dedi-
cated staff of the Senate, who don’t get 
thanked enough—from the Parliamen-
tarian’s office to food services, to the 
Capitol Police—will miss the massive 
holiday cookie parties orchestrated by 
Field Marshal Diana Enzi. 
Diana has organized the production 
of hundreds of dozens of baked treats 
every year. MIKE is more like her as-
sistant 
in 
that 
endeavor. 
Their 
unstoppable tradition of giving back to 
our colleagues, even this year, encap-
sulates just what kind of hearts this 
couple shares. 
As we know, these labors of love 
come on top of Diana’s own important 
work, like her longtime focus on clear-
ing land mines in Eastern Europe. 
I don’t mean any of this to guilt 
MIKE into staying, because MIKE al-
ways has his head on straight, his plans 
laid, and his priorities lined up. So he 
knows that even on our best days, the 
Senate can’t hold a candle to the joys 
of the next chapter he and Diana have 
planned. 
It turns out that the man whose Sen-
ate 
website 
includes 
a 
page 
of 
‘‘Grandfatherly advice’’ is looking for-
ward to more free time for delivering 
that advice to his own grandkids in 
person. 
And I understand there are still sev-
eral States in which MIKE has yet to 
cast a line. One of the Senate’s most 
intrepid anglers will no longer have to 
plan around this body’s schedule as he 
seeks to correct this oversight. 
So, MIKE, while all of us here are 
sorry to see you go, I know our col-
leagues join me in wishing you ‘‘tight 
lines.’’ We are so glad you brought

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7249 
December 8, 2020 
your mind and your heart here to this 
body. Thank you for sharing your gifts 
with the country you love. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank 
the leader for his kind remarks and in-
credible research. I particularly appre-
ciate 
the 
comments 
about 
Flip 
McConnaughey, whom I worked with 
for 40 years before he passed away from 
cancer. If there was ever anybody in 
the United States who had a municipal 
problem, he would work with me as we 
grew Gillette, and he was able to solve 
a lot of those municipal problems. So 
he was the go-to person on the Hill for 
all of that. 
I say to the Senator, I really appre-
ciate those comments, as well as all of 
the other things you mentioned, par-
ticularly the ones about Diana. With-
out her, I would not have had the shoe 
store, I would not have been in politics, 
I would not have been here, nor would 
I have been able to do anything. I 
wouldn’t have traveled around Wyo-
ming. She does most of the driving so 
that I can work on speeches and legis-
lation, and it is a chance for us to visit 
a little bit too. We don’t get to do a lot 
of that here in Washington because of 
the schedules, again. 
But I particularly want to thank you 
for your leadership during this time. It 
has been phenomenal, like the research 
that you did on that speech. The strat-
egy that you put into legislation is in-
credible. You get a lot done, in spite of 
the differences we might have with the 
House or with the other side of the 
aisle or occasionally with the Presi-
dent, but you keep us moving forward. 
It is a talent that is hard to do under 
the circumstances that we work, and I 
really appreciate it. So thank you for 
your comments. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Nathan A. 
Simington, of Virginia, to be a Member 
of the Federal Communications Com-
mission for a term of five years from 
July 1, 2019.

jority whip. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise 
today to recognize and pay tribute to 
two Senators whom I had hoped to 
serve with longer: CORY GARDNER and 
MARTHA MCSALLY. 
One of the first things that became 
clear about CORY GARDNER when he 
came to the Senate is that he is an in-
credibly hard worker. He is tireless. 
CORY has not only a great sense of 
humor; I remember back during im-
peachment when we were working 
some really late nights, he left 5-hour 
ENERGY drinks for all of us in our 
mailboxes. 
I have to say, you kind of need a 5- 
hour ENERGY drink to keep up with 
CORY. Seriously, though, CORY has a 
tremendous amount of energy and 
focus and drive, and he has left it all on 
the field during his time in the Senate. 
I think he knew when he was elected 
that he might not be here forever, and 
he has made every moment over the 
past 6 years count. He is a results-ori-
ented person. He is interested in get-
ting things done, and he has built an 
impressive record. 
Serving the people of Colorado has 
been the first thing on his mind every 
day. He spent a lot of time working on 
Colorado priorities, from protecting 
our public lands to improving wildfire 
preparedness, to expanding healthcare 
access for veterans by ensuring the 
completion of the VA hospital in Au-
rora, CO. 
He has also been a leader on foreign 
policy issues, specifically on the issue 
of holding North Korea and China ac-
countable for their lack of freedom and 
their human rights violations, such as 
China’s mass incarceration of Uighurs 
and its targeting of Chinese citizens 
who dissent from the Communist Party 
line. 
CORY has also been a great friend to 
Taiwan. Among other things, he au-
thored the TAIPEI Act, which the 
President signed into law earlier this 
year, legislation that makes it U.S. 
policy to support Taiwan’s efforts to 
strengthen its relationships with coun-
tries in the Indo-Pacific and around the 
world. A free, prosperous, and safe Tai-
wan is in the interest of the United 
States, and CORY understands this well. 
In addition to being one of the hard-
est working people you will ever meet, 
CORY is also one of the most pleasant. 
He has an upbeat personality and a 
contagious cheer, and committee hear-
ings and meetings are always more en-
joyable when he is around. 
He has been called a happy warrior. I 
think it is a fitting title. He is an eter-
nal optimist. I don’t mean that in a 
naive, wide-eyed sort of way. CORY is 
well aware of the challenges we face in 
our Nation and around the world, but 
he genuinely believes in our country 
and in our ability as citizens and as 
Members of Congress to make life bet-
ter for our fellow Americans. 
And over his 6 years here in the Sen-
ate, he has helped make life better for 
his constituents in all four corners of 
his State and for the American people. 
Nobody could have worked harder for 
Colorado over the past 6 years—no-
body—and he has done more for his 
State in a single term than many have 
managed to do in twice as long a time 
period. 
We were fortunate to have CORY here 
in the U.S. Senate. I will miss serving 
with him, but I look forward to seeing 
what he does next. Whatever it is, I am 
confident of one thing: It will be great. 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Madam President, I didn’t get as 
much time as I would have liked to 
work with MARTHA
MCSALLY. She 
spent just 2 years with us here in the 
Senate, but she made the most of 
them. 
MARTHA’s record is well known: 26 
years in the Air Force, multiple de-
ployments to the Middle East and Af-
ghanistan, the first woman in U.S. his-
tory to fly a fighter jet in combat, the 
first woman in U.S. history to com-
mand a fighter squadron in combat, the 
Bronze Star, six Air Medals, Member of 
the U.S. House of Representatives. And 
the list goes on. 
I am a longtime runner, basketball 
player, sports fan, so I am pretty com-
mitted to exercise, and one of the 
places I got to know MARTHA after she 
came to the Senate was in the Senate 
gym. MARTHA was a regular there. 
I have always believed that you can 
tell a lot about somebody by the work 
ethic that they bring when they are ap-
proaching physical exercise, something 
I saw growing up with my dad. He was 
a World War II fighter pilot who em-
bodied the humility and quiet service 
that characterized the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration,’’ and those traits carried over 
in his approach to sports. He was a bas-
ketball and track coach when I was 
growing up and, prior to that, the most 
valuable player for the University of 
Minnesota basketball team back in 
1941. 
He approached everything with hu-
mility and service. Those were the val-
ues that he emphasized the most. Your 
job as a member of the team was to 
make the team better, not to make 
yourself look good. And if the team 
needed you to make the basket, then 
great, but if the team needed you to 
make that extra pass so that someone 
else could make the shot, then that is 
what you did. 
That is the way that my dad taught 
us, the way that he coached us, and I 
have always said and believed that you 
can tell a lot about someone by how 
they approach physical exercise and 
sporting events and that sort of thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7250 
December 8, 2020 
I can tell you that MARTHA attacked it 
just like she does everything else. She 
approaches that with the same deter-
mination and intensity that she does in 
every other aspect of her life. 
She pushes herself to her limits, and 
those are the qualities that she has dis-
played throughout her career, whether 
she was breaking glass ceilings in the 
military or fighting here in Congress to 
protect the A–10 Warthog. 
She has made the most of her 2 years 
in the Senate, tying for the most bills 
signed into law during her first year. 
And Arizona has benefited from her te-
nacity and commitment. 
MARTHA is tough and determined, but 
she is also kind and generous, all traits 
that were displayed in her farewell 
speech last week. There was a lot to 
admire in that speech. I was particu-
larly struck by the gratitude that she 
displayed. A lesser person might have 
betrayed some bitterness at the brevity 
of her time here. MARTHA
was just 
grateful—grateful for the opportunity 
to serve, grateful for the team who 
worked with her, grateful for what she 
was able to accomplish for Arizona. 
I am grateful not only to have served 
with her but to have had her as a part 
of the whip team here in this Congress. 
Unsurprisingly, she was a dedicated 
and effective deputy whip, and I will 
miss having her on the team. 
At the end of her farewell address, 
MARTHA said: 
Today represents a change in seasons for 
me. I don’t yet have clarity on what my next 
mission will be, but I do know who is the au-
thor and finisher of my faith and that He 
created each of us with a purpose. 
I am confident that the author of our 
faith has more great missions in mind 
for MARTHA MCSALLY, and I look for-
ward to seeing her take them on. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
everywhere you look, there are signs 
the country needs emergency Federal 
relief before the end of the year. Cases, 
hospitalizations, and deaths are rising. 
COVID restrictions are snapping back 
into place in cities and States around 
the country. Economists are warning 
of a double-dip recession if Congress 
fails to pass another round of fiscal 
stimulus. 
The situation is really quite simple. 
There are flaring needs in the country, 
and we need to work across party lines 
to pass legislation to meet those needs. 
Let me say it again. We need both par-
ties to sit down and compromise on 
legislation to help the American peo-
ple. That is the only way to get legisla-
tion passed. But observers of this proc-
ess seem to have lost track of this sim-
ple truth. The Republican leader seems 
to have forgotten about it entirely. 
Amazingly, it has been over 8 months 
since Congress came together to pass 
the CARES Act, and the leader’s posi-
tion has not budged. The majority 
leader continues to insist that the Sen-
ate accept one of his partisan Repub-
lican proposals, each one of which has 
been sorely inadequate and each of 
which has contained poison pills de-
signed to ensure the bill’s failure. 
The most conspicuous of these poison 
pills is the so-called ‘‘red line’’ the ma-
jority leader has tried to draw on the 
issue of corporate immunity. Contrary 
to the majority leader’s dire pre-
dictions, there has been no flood of 
COVID lawsuits—in fact, quite the op-
posite. Almost a year into this pan-
demic, with nearly 15 million Ameri-
cans infected and 280,000 lives lost to 
COVID–19, there have only been 111 
COVID-related lawsuits filed regarding 
conditions of employment, 23 suits for 
personal injury for exposure to the 
coronavirus in a public place, and 11 
COVID-related 
medical 
malpractice 
suits. 
Far from a pandemic of lawsuits, 
there has barely been a trickle. Yet the 
Republican leader continues to prevent 
Americans from getting the aid they so 
desperately need and deserve until he 
gets this piece of partisan, ideological 
legislation. Again, yesterday, while the 
leader was busy accusing Democrats of 
blocking ‘‘bipartisan’’ legislation that 
‘‘everyone 
agrees 
on’’—his 
words— 
other Members of the Republican lead-
ership were making it clear that Lead-
er MCCONNELL continues to insist on 
this particular poison pill. The Repub-
lican whip said that any relief must 
have corporate immunity provisions 
that ‘‘satisfy Senator MCCONNELL.’’ 
Imagine holding emergency aid hos-
tage—help for the unemployed, help for 
small businesses, help to pay the sala-
ries of police and firefighters, help for 
individual Americans, funding to de-
liver a vaccine—in order to give cor-
porations legal immunity. But that has 
been the Republican position for the 
past 8 months, and it is the leader’s po-
sition today. 
For the sake of bipartisan negotia-
tions, Republican leadership should 
forsake these hard-line positions. You 
can’t claim to want bipartisanship 
while actively demanding the Senate 
accept partisan legislation. ‘‘Bipar-
tisan’’ does not mean Democrats must 
agree to whatever the Republican lead-
er wants on whatever issue he picks. 
‘‘Bipartisan’’ means both sides—both 
sides—sitting down and finding agree-
ment to meet the needs of the country 
and make a law. That process is hap-
pening with the Gang of 8. It should 
continue until we get a solution. 
NOMINATION OF NATHAN SIMINGTON 
Madam President, the Senate will 
also vote on the nomination of Nathan 
Simington, a Republican nominee to 
the FCC. 
Normally, these nominations to inde-
pendent Boards and Commissions are 
paired—one 
Democrat, 
one 
Repub-
lican—to keep balance on the board, 
but here in the waning days of a lame-
duck Presidency, the Republican ma-
jority is rushing to approve a single 
Republican nominee. 
The nominee himself is far from 
uncontroversial. Mr. Simington’s key 
qualifications seem to be that he sup-
ports 
President 
Trump’s 
desired 
changes to section 230, a law that regu-
lates internet speech. In fact, it ap-
pears that he severely misled Senators 
on the Commerce Committee when he 
told them that while working for a 
Federal agency, he played only an ad-
ministrative role in his Department’s 
petition for the repeal of section 230. It 
turns out that Mr. Simington was not 
only pushing the petition himself, he 
was actively lobbying FOX News to 
support it for political reasons. 
I strongly urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to reject Mr. 
Simington’s nomination to the FCC. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Madam President, finally, as we ap-
proach the end of the Senate session, I 
have the unhappy task of bidding fare-
well to Senators who will be con-
cluding their time in this Chamber. 
Within an hour, our dear friend and 
dear colleague, Senator TOM UDALL of 
New Mexico, will give his final speech 
here on the Senate floor. 
For the past 12 years, Senators have 
been lucky to work with a legislator of 
Senator UDALL’s caliber, someone who 
possesses a mastery of public policy, 
who is practical as well as principled. 
You always know where Senator UDALL 
stands on an issue, but you also know 
he is always willing to sit with you and 
work with you until you find common 
ground. Because of these qualities, TOM 
will leave this Chamber as a supremely 
accomplished legislator, a fierce de-
fender of the environment, and a true 
champion of the American West. 
A lot of politicians get described as 
wunderkinds for getting elected at a 
young age. You would be hard-pressed 
to find someone who got their start in 
politics earlier than TOM. He made his 
debut at the plucky age of 5, hoisting 
campaign signs on the back of his dad’s 
convertible during his dad’s first bid 
for Congress. 
Public service runs deep in the veins 
of a Udall. It might be called the sap of 
the Udall family tree. Alongside his fa-
ther, TOM looked up to his uncle Mo, 
who succeeded his father in Congress 
and ran for President as one of his gen-
eration’s great environmental advo-
cates. Not too long ago, the Senate 
rollcall featured two Udalls, TOM and 
his cousin Mark. Even now, our col-
league from Utah, Senator LEE, is a 
second cousin to the Udall clan. 
Ultimately, it was TOM’s dad who 
taught him a lifelong love of the polit-
ical process. During the years Stewart 
Udall served as Interior Secretary, TOM

December 8, 2020 
would watch from the living room as 
his dad sat at the dinner table sur-
rounded by Democrats and Republicans 
alike—both sides at dinner working to-
gether. Those memories left a mark. 
TOM would spend his time in Congress 
trying to do much the same. TOM’s 
work with Senator Vitter led to one of 
his greatest accomplishments in office: 
the first major revision of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act in 40 years. At 
the time, it was the most significant 
environmental law to pass Congress in 
over 20 years. 
TOM also had become one of the Sen-
ate’s leading authorities on Tribal pol-
icy, cosponsoring over a quarter of the 
bills that passed through the Indian Af-
fairs Committee on their way to being 
signed into law. Legislation to improve 
Tribal access to affordable healthcare 
and funding to support Native Amer-
ican language preservation programs 
and boost support for Native American 
entrepreneurs all bear the Udall stamp. 
When it comes to protecting our en-
vironment and public lands, no one 
commands greater respect than the 
senior Senator from New Mexico. TOM 
helped increase funding for the Depart-
ment of Interior by 25 percent, includ-
ing billions to protect our national 
parks and expand our wildlife pre-
serves. Through the Great American 
Outdoors Act, TOM helped secure per-
manent funding for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund—a fund his 
dad helped establish over 40 years ago. 
One of TOM’s favorite authors, Wal-
lace Stegner, once wrote: 
Something will have gone out of us as a 
people if we ever let the remaining wilder-
ness be destroyed. . . . We simply need that 
wild country available to us, even if we never 
do more than drive to its edge and look in. 
Well, TOM did a whole lot more than 
‘‘look in.’’ He preserved, he conserved, 
and he expanded the great American 
wilderness for generations hence. 
These highlights, impressive as they 
are, are only the tip of the iceberg. 
Over his 12 years in office, TOM’s legis-
lative accomplishments ran the gamut 
of consumer protection, conservation 
policy, climate change, the protection 
of Tribal nations, and, most recently, a 
principled stand against the current 
administration’s attempts to roll back 
critical 
environmental 
protections. 
Through 
it 
all, 
TOM
has 
been 
unendingly civil, decent, and kind. He 
has deep friendships, real friendships, 
long-lasting friendships in our caucus 
and across the aisle. He prefers to solve 
problems, no matter who gets the cred-
it, sometimes resisting the urge to 
make a splash in public. 
Kidding aside, TOM is as down-to- 
earth as they come. There is just no ar-
tifice about him. He is a decent Sen-
ator and a man. You couldn’t find any 
better. Other Senators will attest to 
these qualities, I am sure, and so will 
his staff—a tribute that is perhaps even 
greater. The respect and loyalty that 
Senator UDALL commands from those 
who work for him day in and day out is 
something extraordinary. 
We don’t know when a Udall will 
next grace the halls with their pres-
ence, but I do know this: Our country 
needs more leaders like TOM. 
Senator UDALL once said his father 
and his uncle were lifelong role models 
because they had the right mix of in-
spiration and perspiration. He said: 
‘‘They were both visionaries, but they 
were also doers.’’ I can think of no bet-
ter description of TOM UDALL himself— 
a visionary but also a doer. 
TOM, as you move on to the next 
chapter in your life, I wish you and Jill 
the very best of luck on the road 
ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I 
thank Senator SCHUMER for those kind 
remarks earlier. 
As you know, I announced last year 
that I wasn’t running for reelection, 
and if I had known everyone was going 
to be so nice to me, I might have an-
nounced it earlier. 
I am not the only Senator who is giv-
ing a farewell speech. Many of us got to 
hear LAMAR
ALEXANDER
last week. 
LAMAR is the perfect example of what a 
U.S. Senator should be. Before I was 
wet behind the ears in the Senate, in 
my first week here, LAMAR invited me 
and Jill, my wife, to dinner. There it 
began. Jill and Honey, LAMAR’s wife, 
became fast friends, and LAMAR and I 
grew closer, building the kind of 
friendship that is essential here in the 
Senate. We worked together to get 
things done for our States in bolstering 
our National Laboratories and con-
serving our great outdoors. Something 
else we shared was Mario, our barber in 
the Senate barbershop. To be honest, 
that is the best place to learn the wis-
dom of the Senate—by sitting in 
Mario’s chair. 
Friendships like I have with LAMAR 
and Mario are what I will miss most 
about the Senate. It is the friendships 
because, as any good Senator will tell 
you, friendships are what get you over 
the finish line. I will cherish the friend-
ships I have forged over the last 12 
years. 
I will miss serving the people of New 
Mexico in Congress. The greatest honor 
of my life has been doing that, and I 
am confident that New Mexico will be 
in good hands with my friend Senator 
HEINRICH, my great partner over the 
last 8 years. With his dedicated advo-
cacy for our communities and his love 
of the land—all of that—MARTIN has 
been an inspiration, and Senator-Elect 
BEN RAY LUJA´ N, whom I have the privi-
lege of calling a friend, I know will 
fight for New Mexico families every 
single day in the Senate. 
I will miss the righteous struggle we 
take up in these Halls to build a more 
perfect Union, and I will miss all of 
you—my staff, colleagues, and every-
one who works around the clock—and 
the unsung heroes who keep the Senate 
running, people like John, Leigh, Mary 
Anne, and all of the folks who are here 
in front of you. There are too many to 
thank. 
First and foremost, I thank my staff. 
Every Senator here knows we are only 
as good as the people on our teams, and 
as my friend PATRICK LEAHY says, we 
Senators are often just a constitu-
tional impediment to the staff. Over 
the years, I have been blessed with 
staffers who are full of talent, skill, 
drive, and heart. 
I don’t want to leave anyone out, so 
I ask unanimous consent to have print-
ed in the RECORD a list of all of my 
staff who have been part of Team 
UDALL. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. UDALL. I want to say thank you 
from the bottom of my heart to each of 
you for your hard work, your public 
service, and your commitment. 
I want to thank my family—my par-
ents Stewart and Lee Udall, who in-
stilled in me the will to do good and to 
be good. 
To my brothers, sisters—my sister 
Lori, who is here—and cousins who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7252 
December 8, 2020 
have supported me throughout my 
three decades in elected office, thank 
you. 
To Amanda, our daughter, who is my 
forever campaign manager, and to 
Judge Jim, our son-in-law and just re-
cently a judge in New Mexico, I thank 
them for their constant love and sup-
port. 
Most importantly, thank you to my 
brilliant and beautiful partner of 42 
years, Jill Cooper Udall. Jill has been 
my rock. She has been my chief coun-
sel. She has been my everything, and I 
couldn’t have asked for a better part-
ner with whom to have this public ad-
venture. 
It has truly been an adventure for 
this son of the West, for after 20-plus 
years, it is time for me to go back 
home. As the great western writer Wal-
lace Stegner wrote, ‘‘It is not an un-
usual life curve for Westerners to live 
in and be shaped by the bigness, sparse-
ness, space, clarity, and hopefulness of 
the West—to go away for study and en-
largement and the perspective that dis-
tance and dissatisfaction can give—and 
then to return to what pleases the 
sight and enlists the loyalty and de-
mands the commitment.’’ 
Stegner said that we fall into two 
categories. We are either boomers or 
stickers. Boomers ‘‘pillage and run.’’ 
Stickers are ‘‘motivated by affection, 
by such a love for place and its life 
that they want to preserve it and re-
main in it.’’ 
I am telling you here today that I am 
a sticker. I am also an optimist. I want 
to be more accurate: I am a troubled 
optimist. I have tried to open my eyes 
to the challenges we face, while never 
losing conviction in our ability to meet 
those challenges. 
As the scientist Rachel Carson said, 
one way to open your eyes is to ask 
yourself, ‘‘What if I had never seen this 
before? What if I knew I would never 
see it again?’’ 
I believe this Nation has arrived at a 
moment when we are opening our eyes 
to the enormous challenges before us 
and also to their solutions. Our planet 
is in crisis—facing mass extinction and 
climate change. Our people are in 
coronavirus—ravaged by a pandemic 
that has laid bare the inequities of our 
society. Also, our democracy is in cri-
sis as the people’s faith in their govern-
ment is shaken. 
We cannot solve one of these crises 
without solving the others, and that is 
why I am troubled, but all I have to do 
to be optimistic is to look around me. 
I look at the young people across this 
country who are calling for change, for 
climate action, for voting rights, for 
immigrant rights, and for economic, 
environmental, and racial justice. They 
have held sit-ins in my office—prob-
ably in yours too. They are demanding 
that we do better, and their determina-
tion gives me hope. I am optimistic as 
I look back on the small acts of kind-
ness and the big acts of progress that 
define my time in the Congress. I be-
lieve that there are lessons in these ac-
complishments. 
Now, you may know me as someone 
who wants to reform the filibuster, but 
to be clear, I have always supported 
the talking filibuster. So, if you will 
indulge me—and by the rules of the 
Senate, you have to; you can leave, but 
I get to keep talking— 
(Laughter.) 
—I would like to talk about a few of 
the highlights of my career and what I 
have learned from them. 
As you know, protecting America’s 
outdoor treasures is a cause close to 
my heart. It is something of a family 
project. My family homesteaded in the 
West almost 180 years ago, and like 
generations of Udalls before me, I grew 
up with a special connection to the 
land—to the gorgeous, untamed beauty 
of the West, to the 60-mile vistas, to 
the snow-covered, rugged mountains, 
alpine lakes, and abundant wildlife. 
MITT
ROMNEY
knows this, for our 
great-grandfathers settled the same 
small western community. Stegner 
called the West the ‘‘geography of 
hope.’’ It sure is for me. It is what has 
inspired much of my public service, and 
that is why I am so proud of what we 
have accomplished together to con-
serve our natural heritage. 
On the Appropriations Committee, 
we have worked together for resources 
for our public lands and environmental 
protection, on a bipartisan basis, in the 
face of massive proposed cuts, and we 
have held off anti-environmental riders 
that have had no place in these bills. 
Thank you to my friend LISA MUR-
KOWSKI, who has been the best partner 
I could ask for in this work. In New 
Mexico, where public lands are central 
to our way of life, we have had enor-
mous success unlocking tens of thou-
sands of acres of enchanted land for all 
of us to enjoy—and for MARTIN to hunt 
on every now and then. Each of these 
efforts was collaborative and commu-
nity-driven, 
and 
that 
collaborative 
work has culminated in one of the big-
gest conservation victories in Amer-
ican history—the passage of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. Thanks to the 
determination of a grassroots coalition 
and many champions here in Congress, 
we got this bill over the finish line. 
For the first time, we have realized 
the promise of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund—the promise my 
father envisioned almost 55 years ago, 
when he helped to create our Nation’s 
most successful conservation program. 
After more than 20 years of fighting for 
this in Congress, I am thrilled we have 
gotten it done, and we have gotten it 
done together. 
The law is a model for how conserva-
tion and economic recovery can go 
hand in hand. It will help us to achieve 
the urgent goal of protecting 30 percent 
of our lands and waters by 2030. Enact-
ing the Great American Outdoors Act, 
at a time of immense division, is a tre-
mendous feat, and it tells us a lot 
about what we are capable of. It tells 
us that conservation is popular—a po-
litical winner. Environmental protec-
tion can be an area of cooperative ac-
tion, and it must be if humanity is to 
survive and prosper. 
As I talk about my love of the land, 
I cannot neglect to acknowledge how 
much I have learned from the original 
stewards of this land—Native Ameri-
cans, indigenous people. I got my start 
in politics by working with my father 
in fighting alongside the Navajo ura-
nium miners who had been hurt and 
many who had died. They had been 
hurt by this Nation, by our nuclear 
weapons program. My work as vice 
chair of the Indian Affairs Committee 
has been the honor of a lifetime and 
another area in which this committee 
has achieved bipartisan progress. 
I 
thank 
my 
chairmen, 
Senator 
HOEVEN and Senator BARRASSO before 
him, for their partnership and friend-
ship. We have worked together as a 
committee for better healthcare, edu-
cation, housing, and urgently needed 
resources for Native communities, es-
pecially as they battle this pandemic. 
The Federal Government’s obligation 
to uphold its trust and treaty obliga-
tions is sacred. Some of my proudest 
achievements have been the result of 
working with Tribal leaders to advance 
the Indian Country’s priorities and to 
support New Mexico’s 23 Tribes. 
Recently, 
a 
bipartisan 
coalition 
passed legislation to strengthen the 
principle 
of 
Tribal 
self-governance, 
provide Native entrepreneurs critical 
resources, and secure investments in 
Native language revitalization. 
The achievements I remember most 
fondly are ones like these—those we 
did together. Indeed, those are the only 
kinds of achievements that are possible 
in this body. 
Take the Frank R. Lautenberg Chem-
ical Safety for the 21st Century Act— 
our landmark reform of the Toxic Sub-
stances Control Act. It was the biggest 
environmental reform in a generation. 
I was proud to lead that effort to pro-
tect our families from toxic chemicals. 
It was hard work, and it took years. 
But if you can get a project where JIM 
INHOFE and ED MARKEY are working for 
the same goal, you can get a lot done 
around here. 
It is another example of how friend-
ships get you over the finish line. My 
friendship with David Vitter, my part-
ner on TSCA reform, was sort of like 
Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch’s friend-
ship, a political odd couple—me, the 
son of Mormon pioneers; David, a son 
of New Orleans—two very different po-
litical backgrounds and different views 
on the big problems before us. 
But I will never forget the dinner we 
had after Frank Lautenberg passed 
away, when we decided to take on 
TSCA reform. We looked at each other 
after that dinner and shook hands and 
said: We are going to get this done. 
And we did. It passed the Senate 
unanimously. We agreed that there was 
a problem, and we found common 
ground on a solution. That is still pos-
sible in the Senate. 
But I didn’t come here to just list ac-
complishments. You can check my

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7253 
December 8, 2020 
Twitter feed if you want to see more of 
that. I do want to share some final 
thoughts about challenges our Nation 
faces before I leave the Senate. 
I believe that, for all of us here, pub-
lic service is a calling. It certainly is 
for me. In my life I have had the privi-
lege of learning from many dedicated 
servants. One of them was Senator 
John McCain. 
Senator McCain was a friend to me 
and a friend to my family. When John 
first came to the House, my Uncle 
Mo—big Uncle Mo, 6 feet 5 inches— 
took him under his wing. John did the 
same for me, and we worked together 
on issues like campaign finance re-
form, Native American issues, and oth-
ers. 
John often said to me: ‘‘We disagree 
in politics—but not in life.’’ Let’s re-
member that. ‘‘We disagree in poli-
tics—but not in life.’’ 
My great-grandfather helped settle 
St. John’s, a small farming and cattle 
community on the Arizona-New Mexico 
border, in the 1880s. He had an embroi-
dery that hung on his frontier home 
that read: ‘‘If the good folks don’t get 
into politics, the scoundrels will take 
over.’’ 
I believe there are a lot of good folks 
here in the Senate, but the system we 
are caught in makes it too hard to 
work together. We need to remember 
that we disagree in politics but not in 
life. 
I am not the first to say in a farewell 
address, and I won’t be the last: But 
the Senate is broken. The Senate is 
broken, and it is not working for the 
American people. 
We are becoming better and better 
political warriors. We are good at land-
ing a punch, at exposing the hypocrisy, 
and at riling each other up, but we 
aren’t fostering our better angels. Our 
peacemaking 
skills 
are 
atrophied. 
Every hurt takes time to heal, and 
each time we hurt each other, it sets us 
back. 
But, unfortunately, the structures we 
have built reward us for hurting one 
another. We need to reform those 
structures or we will never make that 
progress we need to make. 
I have proposed Senate rules changes 
when I was in the minority and when I 
was in the majority to make sure this 
institution does not remain a grave-
yard for progress. 
The Founders did not envision a Sen-
ate requiring 60 votes to act. The fili-
buster came to be through historical 
accident, and it is now woven into the 
institutional framework. The promise 
of the filibuster is that the majority 
will find common ground with the mi-
nority, but the reality of the filibuster 
is paralysis—a deep paralysis. 
On top of this, we have a campaign fi-
nance system that is out of control. 
John McCain told you that over and 
over again, and he called money the 
cancer growing on our democracy. And 
John McCain knew a lot about cancer. 
Secret money floods campaigns to 
buy influence instead of letting the 
voters speak. Voting rights are under 
attack. We can do our best to be good 
people in a system like that, but it is 
no surprise that America’s faith in gov-
ernment is declining. 
These structures are antidemocratic. 
They reward extremism. They punish 
compromise. 
Our government is supposed to re-
spond to the will of the majority while 
protecting the rights of the minority. 
Instead, we have ‘‘the tyranny of the 
minority.’’ 
That 
tyranny 
is 
super 
wealthy, politically powerful, and dan-
gerously out of touch with the Amer-
ican people. 
The majority of Americans support 
pandemic relief, healthcare for every 
American, action on global warming, 
racial justice and police reform, and so 
many other priorities that don’t see 
much progress in the Senate. 
People are losing their faith in the 
system—rightfully so. We have to do 
something to fix this. 
If we are to take bold action nec-
essary to tackle the urgent problems 
before us, we must reform our democ-
racy. We must make it easier to vote. 
We must end the dominance of Big 
Money, and we must root out corrup-
tion. 
And we do not have any time to 
waste. We have no choice but to be bold 
because the crises before us demand 
bravery. Hundreds of thousands of 
Americans are dead from a pandemic— 
a pandemic that this administration 
has callously ignored, a consequence of 
its continued rejection of science. In 
New Mexico, we have surpassed 108,000 
cases, over 1,700 are dead, and tens of 
thousands have lost their jobs. 
Meanwhile, our Nation is facing dual 
climate and nature crises of epic pro-
portions. Earlier this year, much of the 
American West was engulfed in wild-
fire. As an arid State, New Mexico is in 
the crosshairs of climate change. We 
lose a football field’s worth of nature 
every 30 seconds. 
A million species are at risk of ex-
tinction because of human activity. 
Our planet’s life support system is 
under threat. As the climate crisis 
worsens, ecosystems are destroyed, and 
as ecosystems are destroyed, we emit 
more harmful greenhouse gases. We 
cannot solve one crisis without solving 
the other. 
Protecting nature is about protecting 
humanity. It is just that simple. And 
marginalized 
communities, 
commu-
nities of color, low-income commu-
nities, and indigenous people are bear-
ing the worst consequences of the envi-
ronmental destruction and pollution 
caused by the rich and the powerful. 
We have the power to solve these cri-
ses—the power and the obligation. All 
it takes is clear eyes and political will 
and remembering that we may disagree 
in politics but not in the future that 
we want for our children. 
When I was a young man, I spent the 
summer of 1969 in the mountains of 
Colorado, teaching students wilderness 
skills. Each night, we would look up 
and open our eyes to the Moon. It 
seemed impossibly far away. 
I am reminded of Rachel Carson’s 
words: ‘‘One way to open your eyes is 
to ask, what if I had never seen this be-
fore?’’ 
When we emerged from the wilder-
ness, we learned what Apollo 11 had 
achieved. We had landed on the Moon— 
the Moon that seemed so impossibly 
far away. 
We should never forget that we can 
do—we, all of us, can do—the impos-
sible when we open our eyes to the 
challenge and work together to meet 
it. 
So as I return home to the West, I am 
clear-eyed about—even troubled by— 
how far away our destination is. But I 
am optimistic that we will get there, 
like we always have. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, it 
is my honor today to commend the sen-
ior Senator from New Mexico, my long-
time partner in this Chamber, my good 
friend TOM UDALL, for his years of serv-
ice to our great State of New Mexico 
and to our Nation. 
Before I speak about Tom, I would 
like to quickly take a moment, too, to 
recognize the service of Congress-
woman XOCHITL
TORRES
SMALL
over 
these last 2 years. 
Congresswoman TORRES SMALL actu-
ally served for a time in Senator 
UDALL’s office in Las Cruces, and for 
these last 2 years in the House of Rep-
resentatives, she has dedicated herself 
to delivering resources for the people 
of southern New Mexico. And I am so 
very grateful to have served alongside 
XOCHITL in our congressional delega-
tion, and I am greatly looking forward 
to seeing how she will contribute her 
heart and her talents to New Mexico 
next. She certainly learned a great deal 
from our senior Senator. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Now, let me tell you a little bit about 
our senior Senator, TOM UDALL. 
One of the first times I ever spent 
any serious time with TOM UDALL was 
actually on horseback. Tom was serv-
ing at the time as the Congressman for 
northern New Mexico’s Third Congres-
sional District, and I was leading a 
group called the Coalition for New 
Mexico Wilderness. Together, we rode 
into rugged mesas and canyons east of 
Las Vegas, NM—that is the original 
Las Vegas—that I hoped would soon be 
designated as the Sabinoso Wilderness. 
It was clear right away that Tom 
shared my sense of wonder in the out-
doors and wild places and a strong 
commitment to protect those precious 
landscapes for future generations, and 
despite his day job walking the Halls of 
Congress, he was pretty comfortable on 
that horse of his—much more so than 
myself. 
More than a decade later, Tom and I 
would repeat that horseback ride in 
Sabinoso, alongside President Trump’s 
then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. 
We were both serving in the Senate 
by this point. We had successfully

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7254 
December 8, 2020 
worked together to establish not just 
the Sabinoso Wilderness but also the 
Ojito 
Wilderness, 
the 
Columbine- 
Hondo, the Valles Caldera National 
Preserve, the Organ Mountains-Desert 
Peaks National Monument, and the Rio 
Grande del Norte National Monument. 
Now we were working to convince 
Secretary Zinke—someone I might de-
scribe as a bit of a wilderness skeptic— 
to sign off on the Bureau of Land Man-
agement’s acceptance of a generous 
land donation by the Wilderness Land 
Trust. This land donation would finally 
open up public access to the spectac-
ular opportunities in the Sabinoso, 
which was then actually completely 
landlocked by private lands, and it 
would substantially grow the Sabinoso 
Wilderness area. 
A couple of hours of both of us riding 
into Canyon Largo alongside Secretary 
Zinke, alongside local sportsmen and 
public lands advocates and community- 
elected 
leaders, 
accomplished 
what 
months of testy congressional hearings 
and office meetings and phone calls 
here in Washington, DC, could not. 
Just days after his visit, Secretary 
Zinke announced that his reservations 
over accepting new wilderness were as-
suaged and that he would approve the 
donation at the Department of Inte-
rior. 
Thanks to those efforts and that 
horseback ride, for years to come, all 
New Mexicans and all Americans will 
be able to visit this stunning wilder-
ness that we all own together. 
This story is but one example from 
Senator UDALL’s long career that dem-
onstrates 
how 
bringing 
people 
to-
gether, even those who may have major 
disagreements—especially about poli-
tics—can still help to find common 
ground and forge a path forward. That 
is one of the main lessons that I will 
always take with me about the exam-
ple that Senator UDALL has set as such 
a principled leader. 
TOM has devoted his entire career to 
serving the people of my State. As our 
State’s attorney general, TOM took on 
major challenges, from curbing perva-
sive drunk driving to domestic vio-
lence, to prosecuting unethical and 
corrupt elected officials and protecting 
consumers and seniors from all manner 
of predatory scams. 
Then, during his 10 years of service in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, TOM 
fought to deliver for northern New 
Mexico’s communities. He stood firmly 
against the Bush administration’s tax 
cuts for the wealthy. He opposed the 
misguided invasion of Iraq. He called 
on Congress to rein in the civil lib-
erties abuses in the PATRIOT Act. 
TOM was first elected to serve our 
State in the U.S. Senate in the exact 
same year that I was first elected to 
Congress. It has been a privilege to sit 
in a front-row seat during this time 
while he led our State’s congressional 
delegation. 
I believe that all of us in this body 
can agree that there are few greater ex-
amples than TOM Udall in embodying 
the best of what it means to be a Sen-
ator. 
Over his two terms in this Chamber, 
TOM has showed us all how to act—to 
act with decency, to act with integrity; 
how to stay true to your principles but 
also how to find the deliberative com-
promises that have become all too rare 
in today’s Senate. TOM knows that to 
get anything done, especially in this 
era of extremely polarized party poli-
tics, you need to be able to bring peo-
ple together, to break bread, to have 
the patience to work through disagree-
ments, and to focus on results, not pol-
itics. 
That was perhaps best demonstrated 
in his ability to pass a landmark, bi-
partisan overhaul of the Toxic Sub-
stances Control Act—likely one of the 
greatest environmental law achieve-
ments in the last decade. TSCA is just 
about the most complicated piece of 
law that you can possibly imagine; 
however, the powers that it grants to 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
are some of the only things protecting 
us, standing between us and many 
harmful chemicals. 
In the last decade, it became increas-
ingly clear that the original law, which 
had passed back in the 1970s, was sim-
ply no longer effective and required 
significant reforms, but getting a new 
law passed had proved to be practically 
impossible for many Senators who had 
tried for years to get this done. 
Because of all the major industry in-
terests, disagreements from various 
groups, TSCA reform had become one 
of the many things that conventional 
wisdom simply said would never get 
done, especially in today’s gridlocked 
Congress. But TOM did not take no for 
an answer. He took on the years-long, 
daunting challenge of convening an in-
credibly wide range of stakeholders to 
get the details right and successfully 
steered a new law all the way to final 
passage. I believe TOM Udall was suc-
cessful in this precisely because of the 
way that he stands up for his principles 
with moral clarity. 
At a time when our democracy has 
felt fragile, TOM has led the way in 
fighting the corrosive effects of dark 
money in our politics. He championed 
voting rights, and he called for rules 
reforms to make this body, to make 
this Senate work for ‘‘we the people’’ 
once again. 
Through his role on the Foreign Re-
lations Committee, TOM has held ad-
ministrations from both parties ac-
countable for responsibly exercising 
American power overseas. 
He has been a steadfast champion 
and ally for Indian Country, fighting 
for water access, education, healthcare, 
and law enforcement resources for 
Tribal nations. 
For years, TOM has called on us to fi-
nally confront the climate crisis that 
threatens New Mexico’s land and water 
and, frankly, the future of our country 
and our planet. I have been so proud to 
partner with TOM over these last years 
to pass landmark protections for the 
natural resources and public lands that 
we in New Mexico all treasure. Our 
children and future generations will 
see the legacy of TOM’s conservation 
work for years to come. 
Finally, it goes almost without say-
ing, but I am confident that TOM’s 
leaving the Senate will not mean leav-
ing behind his lifetime commitment to 
service—in fact, far from it. Whatever 
his next chapter brings, I am certain 
that TOM will never stop looking for 
ways to help the people of New Mexico, 
although I do hope he will find the 
time to get outside, to spend time in a 
remote mountain pass from time to 
time or on a fast flowing river. 
It has truly been the honor of a life-
time to serve alongside Senator UDALL 
for these last 12 years and to fight to-
gether to deliver resources and results 
for New Mexicans. 
Thank you, TOM, for everything that 
you have taught me and for everything 
that you and Jill have done for New 
Mexicans and for Americans. Julie and 
I certainly wish you the best in this 
next chapter in your life, and it has 
truly been my honor. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I stand 
today to give tribute to my friend and 
colleague, the senior Senator from New 
Mexico, TOM Udall, who was assigned 
to be my mentor when I first arrived in 
the Senate nearly 10 years ago. 
Over a series of meetings we had over 
breakfast, lunch, and in our offices, 
TOM mentored me and tutored me on 
the rules of the Senate. He took the 
time to explain the nuances of the fili-
buster and how the Senate has deviated 
from the rule as it was originally de-
signed. The concept is not a familiar 
one, nor is it intuitive, and yet TOM 
was able to explain it to me in a way 
that was simple and easy to understand 
and helped me grasp the passion that 
he has for addressing that issue and for 
reforming the Senate for the better 
ever since then. 
He had a way of doing it that didn’t 
make anyone feel demeaned but made 
them, rather, more enthusiastic about 
making the Senate a better place in 
which to work, operate, and legislate. 
I have no idea whether the person 
who assigned TOM as my mentor knew 
that TOM and I were related, that we 
are second cousins, that his grand-
mother 
and 
my 
grandfather 
were 
brother and sister, or that my grand-
mother on the other side of the family 
was his U.S. history teacher at James 
Fenimore 
Cooper 
Intermediate 
and 
Junior High, but our paths seemed des-
tined to cross. 
I didn’t know TOM well growing up, 
although I knew his father Stewart, 
and I knew his Uncle Morris. TOM was 
already off to fame and stardom by the 
time I came along, but I knew his fam-
ily long before I got to know him. In 
many ways, they saved the best for 
last. 
Even though I got to know your dad 
and your Uncle Morris before I got to

December 8, 2020 
know you, I tremendously enjoyed get-
ting to work with you. You and I come 
from similar parts of the country, from 
some of the same ancestral pioneer 
stock, and we have very different ideas. 
Yet TOM Udall has always been some-
one with whom I have been able to 
communicate freely and frankly and 
from whom I have always heard posi-
tive, uplifting communication, even 
when we disagree, which happens from 
time to time. 
Thank you so much for your service. 
It has been a pleasure getting to work 
with you as a colleague. I wish you and 
Jill the very best success and happiness 
in your future endeavors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
Senator UDALL and I came here in the 
same class 12 years ago. It is hard to 
believe that 12 years have passed. How 
can that happen so quickly? We have 
seen the Senate in various chapters as 
it sought to address the big challenges 
facing America. 
Colleagues have already noted TOM’s 
intense advocacy for the wildlands of 
the West and the poetry that he 
brought to it in his speech today with 
Mr. Stegner’s reflections on the maj-
esty and importance of the wildlands of 
the West and all of his efforts to pro-
tect those lands. 
Colleagues 
have 
mentioned 
how, 
when folks thought it couldn’t be done, 
he dived into this partnership with 
Senator Vitter to drive the Lautenberg 
Toxic Substances Act and got it ac-
complished 
through 
months 
and 
months of intense negotiations. 
He cares about the function of this 
body and has shared with us idea after 
idea on how we might make it work 
better—ideas that we should still work 
to consider in the months and years 
ahead. 
As he thought about protection of 
lands, he thought about protection of 
the oceans and the role of plastics in 
the oceans. He spearheaded efforts for 
us to reconsider how we produce so 
much plastic waste and where it ends 
up and the damage that it does—a vi-
sion that others will have to carry the 
baton on after his departure. 
He has stood up fiercely for the con-
stitutional vision of a nation and a 
government of, by, and for the people, 
that money is not speech, and that cor-
porations are not people. 
TOM, thank you. Thank you for fight-
ing for the vision of our Constitution, 
for a government that can and will 
take on the issues facing us. We will 
miss you. I personally hope that you 
will have a major role in continuing to 
advance 
the 
protection 
of 
those 
wildlands in the West in the near fu-
ture. All my best, and take care in 
your next chapter. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Wyo-
ming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
just a little reflection on TOM Udall 
and working together on the Indian Af-
fairs Committee that I chaired, and he 
was the ranking member. I will tell 
you that I will miss my friend TOM 
Udall. 
Bobbi and I will miss your life part-
ner Jill as well. We are so grateful for 
your friendship and your leadership in 
this body. 
When Senator UDALL started today 
on the floor, he mentioned that he was 
a son of the West and mentioned that 
it is something that runs in the family. 
Madam President, TOM’s father, Stew-
art Udall, was Secretary of the Interior 
of the United States. If you go to the 
Interior Department office, you will 
see it is the Udall name on the building 
because of this ongoing commitment 
and love that the Senator has spoken 
about today. 
What many don’t know is the rela-
tionship between Wyoming and the 
Udall family. It was Stewart Udall, 
Secretary of the Interior, who came to 
Wyoming with a young President a 
number of years ago. That President 
was John F. Kennedy. It was Sep-
tember of 1963. 
I went back to the archives at the 
University of Wyoming and found 
photos of TOM’s dad and the President 
at the time, John Kennedy, and a num-
ber of Wyoming leaders at the time. I 
gave copies to TOM and to Jill to share 
the bond of our States. 
It would surprise many, I think, in 
this body to know that I have a pic-
ture, actually, of John Kennedy hang-
ing in my office up in the Dirksen Of-
fice Building—John Kennedy address-
ing the crowd at the University of Wy-
oming Arena-Auditorium in September 
of 1963. 
As TOM this morning talked about 
conservation, John Kennedy talked of 
conservation that very day that he 
gave that speech with your father on 
the stage, together so many years ago. 
At the time, John Kennedy talked of 
the living balance between man’s ac-
tions and nature’s reaction to it and 
the living balance that must exist. 
So, today, I come and thank my 
friend for his stewardship, for his lead-
ership, and for his friendship, and I say 
this with a great deal of appreciation 
and admiration and respect. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor someone whom I 
have had the good fortune of working 
with both in the U.S. House and the 
U.S. Senate. Senator UDALL and I spent 
a long time together, and I am very, 
very grateful. 
I want to take a step back just for a 
moment and say that in American po-
litical history there are certain names 
that carry a legacy. There are the Roo-
sevelts, a family of great means who, 
nonetheless, understood the deeply per-
sonal pain of the Great Depression and 
helped bring a nation through it. There 
are the Kennedys, a family that for 
generations has been near the center of 
American power and popular culture. 
And there are the Udalls. 
Now, the Udalls have never been 
flashy. They might not be the equiva-
lent of political royalty. You might 
find the Udalls more likely to be in 
cowboy boots and jeans than expensive 
suits, but they are a family that is 
deeply rooted in public service, pro-
tecting the people and the places of the 
West, and just being some of the 
kindest, hardest working, most decent 
folks you could ever meet, period. 
Senator TOM
Udall has certainly 
lived up to his family’s legacy during 
his long career in public service. New 
Mexico is so fortunate to have been 
represented by him, and I feel so fortu-
nate to have him as my friend. 
TOM, it has been such a pleasure to 
work with you on so many different 
issues. You talk about the land, and I 
talk a lot about water. And even 
though you are not surrounded by the 
Great Lakes, as we are, you have been 
as passionate in working with us to 
protect our beautiful water, as you 
have with other natural resources. So 
thank you for protecting the funding 
for the Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive. 
Also, I thank him for ensuring that 
our community health centers receive 
full funding, for strengthening rural 
communities, and for improving serv-
ices for our veterans. 
I appreciate so much your leadership 
in the bipartisan efforts, and I was 
proud to support you and help on tax 
reform. I have been so impressed by 
your work on clean energy and on pro-
tecting the wild places that make our 
States so special, and, of course, your 
work on reforming the Senate and 
shining the light of day on money and 
politics. 
I am so grateful for your strong lead-
ership on the Indian Affairs Committee 
and your hard work and advocacy—so 
effective in advocating for our Nation’s 
Tribes. 
You have also set yourself apart 
through your work on Foreign Rela-
tions and on keeping our Nation safe. I 
will never forget our trip to Vietnam 
and South Korea last year. We were, 
over the Easter weekend, flying in 
Southeast Asia, and it was such a won-
derful moment when Jill organized a 
Passover Seder for everyone on the 
plane—what a special moment on this 
bipartisan trip. It brought everybody 
together to focus on our common hu-
manity and what we are each called to 
do, which is to serve others. 
Whatever the future holds for you, I 
have no doubt that you will continue 
serving the people of New Mexico and 
this Nation, and I believe we have more 
than benefitted from your leadership. 
Public service, that is what Udalls do. 
Senator UDALL, congratulations on 
your retirement. Thank you for a job 
well done, and so many best wishes to 
you and your life partner Jill and your 
entire family. You have been a real 
blessing not only to New Mexico but to 
our country. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7256 
December 8, 2020 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
just really want to thank Senator 
UDALL for his commitment to public 
service. When I think of a person of his 
talent, his expertise, and his effective-
ness, he has devoted his entire life to 
public service to make New Mexico 
better, to make America better, and 
for global justice. I just really want to 
thank him for his many years of public 
service. I know that he has not finished 
his commitment to try to help our 
community, but we are going to miss 
him on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I had a chance to work with Senator 
UDALL when he and I were in the House 
of Representatives, and we worked on 
so many issues—from the environment 
to justice issues, to integrity in the 
process to make sure our system of jus-
tice, our system of law, and our system 
of legislating meet the high expecta-
tions of our democracy. We know that 
we can do better to form a more perfect 
union. We are on that path, and we can 
do better. And thanks to Senator 
UDALL, we have done better, but we 
still have a road ahead of us. 
So, you are an inspiration to all of 
us. We want you to know that. We love 
you. We greatly admire your service to 
this body and to our community. As 
has been said by others, we are not 
only going to miss your relationship on 
working with issues here; we are going 
to miss the friendship and seeing you 
on a more regular basis. 
We know that your life partner Jill 
has been a steady supporter of what 
you have done. So on behalf of your 
colleagues in the U.S. Senate, we say 
thank you for a job well done. We are 
proud to have called you our friend and 
associate, and we will continue to work 
with you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
had the privilege of knowing TOM 
UDALL’s uncle when I served in the 
House of Representatives. He was not 
only a great leader, but he was a funny 
man. I have repeated some of his lines 
and jokes so often. I don’t even give 
him credit anymore. I hope his family 
and his memory will forgive me. 
I have often repeated his prognosis 
for politicians. Morris Udall said: Once 
you get politics in your bloodstream, 
only embalming fluid will replace it. I 
have often thought of what drives us, 
the men and women of the Senate and 
the House, to continue to engage in 
this life’s work of politics, with all the 
cost that it incurs in our lives. Clearly, 
we are driven by something more than 
just comfort. 
To my friend, TOM UDALL, let me say 
I am glad you proved your uncle wrong. 
As much as I wish you were staying 
with us for a while longer, I know that 
you are not leaving public service. You 
never will. You are just leaving this 
chapter. 
In the Udall family, public service is 
a noble tradition. Your uncle always 
served with honor in the House for 
three 
decades. 
Your 
cousins—Mark 
Udall, MIKE LEE, and Gordon Smith— 
have all served in the Senate. Your fa-
ther, Stewart Udall, answered Presi-
dent Kennedy’s call for the best and 
brightest and served as President Ken-
nedy’s Secretary of the Interior. 
I want to mention one footnote that 
should never be forgotten, particularly 
at this moment in history. When we 
watch the NFL and their dedication to 
the notion of Black Lives Matter, they 
should remember that over 50 years 
ago, it was your father, as Secretary of 
the Interior, who said to the NFL foot-
ball team that was using RFK Stadium 
that they had to integrate and bring in 
their first Black player or he wasn’t 
going to renew their Federal lease on 
that premises. He changed, overnight, 
the fate of that Washington football 
franchise when it came to the issue of 
race. That shows the kind of leadership 
which 50 years later looked so vision-
ary. 
But when it comes to preserving 
America’s national treasures in the 
20th century, the Udall name ranks 
right up there with Teddy Roosevelt. 
Roosevelt was a giant of conservation. 
He believed that we have a moral obli-
gation to preserve our planet and the 
treasures of it for future generations. 
I have no doubt that your father and 
your mother would be proud of your 
service in the Senate. You have carried 
on this legacy with such perfection by 
preserving America’s irreplaceable na-
tional treasures. I have vivid memories 
of two majestic national monuments 
that are in Utah—Bears Ears and 
Grand Staircase-Escalante. President 
Obama showed real leadership in cre-
ating those monuments, and you have 
led the fight to preserve them through 
the current administration. 
The passion with which you spoke 
about the history and importance of 
these treasures is something I will 
never forget. I was proud to cosponsor 
your proposal, the ANTIQUITIES Act, 
to make clear that only Congress can 
alter the list of protected national 
monuments. Thank goodness we have 
public servants like TOM UDALL, who is 
willing to fight to preserve a piece of 
this world so that future generations 
can see it as God created it. Your ‘‘30 
by 30 Resolution,’’ which you cospon-
sored with Senator BENNET of Colo-
rado, is another example of creative, 
innovative Udall ‘‘conservationism.’’ 
Your efforts to preserve America’s 
most sacred treasures do not end with 
open spaces and a healthy environ-
ment. You have also been a brave and 
tireless champion of the need to pre-
serve the fundamentals of our democ-
racy. Along with your efforts to pro-
tect national monuments, you also led 
to preserve the delicate balance of pow-
ers envisioned by our Founders. You 
were the lead sponsor in this Chamber 
in the For the People Act to protect 
voting rights, strengthening govern-
ment ethics, and changing the way 
congressional campaigns are funded—a 
bill that I have built on myself to try 
to protect our body politic. 
Our goals were always the same: to 
break the grip of special interests on 
our politics and government while 
making it more affordable for men and 
women with good ideas but without 
massive wealth to run for Congress. 
These last years have shown us how 
fragile our democracy can be and how 
much work we have to do to restore 
people’s faith in government. 
I want to point out one particular 
bill—TSCA. Tom, I will never forget 
what you did with that. I don’t know 
how 
many 
months—maybe 
even 
years—that you weathered on despite 
opposition, not only from the other 
side of the aisle but sometimes from 
our side of the aisle, to get this issue 
into perspective. There were chemicals 
that were being put into things as 
basic as furniture that American fami-
lies had no idea would be dangerous. 
I have never forgotten this image. 
You told this story on the floor. To 
think that that cushion on your couch 
is treated with some chemical that 
could be harmful to individuals and 
that every time you, as a father, sat 
down on that couch and pulled that 
baby close to you, you could have been 
spraying chemicals in that baby’s face. 
I thought about that ever since you 
gave that speech and how much work 
you did to make sure that we remedy 
that wrong and that we gave notifica-
tion and clearance before these chemi-
cals were being used in products that 
American families didn’t even know 
about. I gave you my word that I would 
push hard with you on that. I was just 
one of the soldiers in the back of the 
ranks, but I was proud of every mo-
ment of it. 
I wish you and your wife Jill a spe-
cial happiness in the next chapter. Jill, 
of course, is originally a native of St. 
Louis, and I grew up across the river. 
We had many fun times talking about 
her youth and reminiscing about mu-
tual friends. She is just an exceptional 
person herself, and you know it and I 
do too. To your daughter Amanda, I 
wish an equally happy and healthy fu-
ture. As our friend John Lewis might 
say, may you continue to find ways to 
get into good trouble. 
In this Senate, you have been the 
voice for so many people who had no 
voice. You have chosen to be an advo-
cate for Native Americans. And if there 
is ever a cause which every single 
Member of the Senate and the House 
should take as their own, it is to bring 
justice to this group of people who 
were here before us and were not treat-
ed well by this government. 
I will close now with a thought from 
one of their great leaders, Sitting Bull. 
In negotiations with the Federal Gov-
ernment, Sitting Bull advised: Let us 
put our minds together and see what 
future we can make for our children. 
This is the spirit which TOM UDALL 
has brought to the U.S. Senate in every 
aspect of public service. It has been an 
honor to work with you, Tom. I wish 
you all the best because you are the 
best.

S7257 
December 8, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
know we are about to vote, and I will 
speak further at another time about 
Senator UDALL, but I just want to tell 
him what I told you—all of you—what 
I said to him when he finished speak-
ing: In my 46 years here, it is one of the 
finest and most moving, heartfelt, hon-
est speeches I have heard. I have also 
sent a note, I say to Senator UDALL, to 
Jill Udall to tell her how great you are, 
but I think she probably knew it. But I 
will speak further at another time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
brief remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
want to say a few words about leader-
ship. When I think of the word ‘‘leader-
ship,’’ I think of TOM UDALL. 
Leaders are humble, not haughty. 
Leaders have the heart of a servant. 
They realize that our job is to serve, 
not to be served. Leaders have the 
courage to stay in step when everyone 
else is marching to the wrong tune. 
Leaders unite, not divide. They build 
bridges, not laws. 
Leaders surround themselves with 
the very best people they can find. 
When the team does well, the leader 
gives the credit to the team. When the 
team falls short, the leader takes the 
blame. 
The best leaders among us realize 
they don’t build themselves up by tear-
ing other people down. Leaders are as-
pirational. They appeal to our better 
angels. 
Camus—a Frenchman—used to say 
that leaders are purveyors of hope. 
Leaders seek to do what is right, not 
what is easy or expedient but what is 
right. 
Leaders embrace the Golden Rule: 
Treat other people the way they want 
to be treated. The Golden Rule is in 
every major religion on the planet. He 
embodies it. 
Leaders believe that we should pur-
sue excellence in everything we do. If it 
isn’t perfect, let’s make it better. And 
when a leader knows that he or she is 
right, they just won’t give up. They 
don’t give up. 
Those are the qualities that we all 
admire in leaders. To be totally honest, 
I fall short on a number of them. And 
I guess if we are all truthful, we would 
all say the same thing. 
He doesn’t fall short on any of them. 
TOM UDALL is the personification of 
what a leader should be and a friend as 
well. 
I just want to say thanks to his par-
ents for raising him, bringing him into 
the world, and putting him on the right 
path, giving us a chance to serve with 
him. 
I also thank Jill, his wife, for being 
just a terrific partner with him. When 
we were stuck on TSCA—the Toxic 
Substance Control Act—she came to 
the hearings in the committee. He was 
no longer on the committee, but she 
came there, and everybody could see on 
her face that we better get this right or 
we were in trouble. 
The reason we had to pass the Toxic 
Substance Control Act is that the Fed-
eral law that we passed a quarter cen-
tury ago before didn’t work, and every 
other State stepped in and decided to 
have their own State version. It was a 
patchwork quilt. It just didn’t work. 
He pointed it out and made it happen, 
made a change, and I just will always 
be grateful for that. 
The other thing I want to say is that 
he is a friend. I think if you talk to 
anybody here, they would say that he 
is a friend. I don’t care if you are a Re-
publican or a Democrat; he is a friend. 
My wife and I and our sons, Chris-
topher and Ben, had the opportunity at 
the end of an Aspen Institute seminar 
in Tanzania, which was just an incred-
ible experience, to stay for 4 or 5 days 
afterward and just travel throughout, 
go on a safari, and have a chance to see 
amazing things—amazing things. When 
it was all over, we went back to the 
airport in Tanzania, the Kilimanjaro 
airport, to catch a flight back to the 
States. I will never forget. Our son 
Ben, who is our younger son, said to his 
mom and dad and his older brother: 
That was the best vacation we have 
ever had. 
We talk about things we share with 
one another, but that is one that is es-
pecially close to my heart. 
Godspeed. God bless you.

Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
thank you to the people of Colorado for 
this incredible honor that you have 
lent to me these last 6 years to serve 
you in the U.S. Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7258 
December 8, 2020 
Thank you to my family—Jaime, 
Alyson, Caitlyn, Thatcher, to Mom and 
Dad and Lisa—who supported me in 
this last decade of service with your 
love and sacrifice, through missed ball 
games and lost teeth, school concerts 
and junior high dances, sore throats 
and first moments. 
Thank you to my incredible staff, 
many in the Chamber today, who are in 
Colorado and Washington, who made so 
many great things happen and whose 
difference will be felt for generations 
to come. You leave a mark on the 
country far beyond the etching of a sig-
nature on a desk on the floor. 
Thank you to my colleagues and to 
Senator BENNET for the honor of serv-
ing along your side and for your com-
mitment to our Nation—and to the 
Capitol Police, the staff, to the support 
staff in the Senate who make it all pos-
sible. 
But above all, and most importantly, 
thank you to this great and extraor-
dinary Nation for all that it means and 
represents—the 
hope 
and 
optimism 
that for over two centuries has led peo-
ple around the globe to give up every-
thing they have just to be here; to be a 
part of this Nation, to then turn 
around and fight for it through polit-
ical strife and pandemics; to go to war 
to save the Union; to know how lucky 
and blessed that we are that out of all 
of the billions of people through the 
thousands of years of human history, 
we have had the privilege of being here 
in this place at this point to be a part 
of it. 
There has been a lot of coverage in 
the news lately about how the pollsters 
got it wrong. But one thing they seem 
to get right—and it won’t come as a 
shock to my colleagues on the floor: 
Congress is about as popular as a 
Rocky Mountain oyster in a bullpen. 
We have been, together, able to do 
many good things, and I hope that we 
can use those successes to drive even 
more successes and show the American 
people that faith in this institution is 
actually well deserved. 
Over the last 6 years I have worked 
hard to pass the first-ever mandatory 
sanctions on Kim Jong Un and North 
Korea to denuclearize that regime. It 
was an honor to work with Senator 
MENENDEZ throughout this process. 
Senator MARKEY and I led the pas-
sage of the first-ever comprehensive 
strategy for a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific, the Asia Reassurance Initiative. 
GARY
PETERS, along with LAMAR 
ALEXANDER and me, led the reauthor-
ization of the America Competes legis-
lation to keep the United States com-
petitive in science and engineering, to 
get more women and minorities into 
the STEM fields, and to advance our 
scientific research and discoveries. 
The 988 suicide prevention bill that 
TAMMY BALDWIN and I were able to pass 
into law represents the first bill in 
American history to pass the Senate 
and House unanimously with LGBTQ- 
specific language. This bill will save 
lives. 
I was honored to help move the Bu-
reau 
of 
Land 
Management 
head-
quarters to Colorado and to finally get 
funding for the construction of the Ar-
kansas Valley Conduit, and I helped 
lead the passage of legislation to com-
plete our VA hospital in Colorado, to 
advance our cybersecurity, and to fos-
ter our relationships with Taiwan, 
South Korea, and beyond. 
And it was an honor of my time in 
the Senate to work with LAMAR and 
Senators MANCHIN, CANTWELL, HEIN-
RICH, WARNER, KING, PORTMAN, DAINES, 
and BURR on the Great American Out-
doors Act, the holy grail of conserva-
tion legislation. 
In my first remarks on the Senate 
floor, I spoke about how no matter 
where across Colorado’s four corners 
that you live—or across this great Na-
tion—we all hope for the same thing 
for our children: to live in a loving 
home that values every citizen; that 
they learn the value of hard work and 
perseverance; where hard work is met 
with merited reward; that they find a 
nation of liberty and freedom that they 
help make a little bit more free and a 
little bit more perfect. All of us here in 
the Senate, the American people—all 
of us—are responsible for the starting 
point that we hand off to the next gen-
eration, and we have a moral obliga-
tion to make it the best starting point 
possible. 
The accomplishments that we have 
had together truly have helped create 
more opportunity for the next genera-
tion, and the work that we continue to 
do to get through this pandemic to-
gether will ensure that the next gen-
eration can indeed take advantage of 
those accomplishments and that the 
starting point for them is better than 
the generation past despite the strug-
gles of today. You know, in Sunday 
school we learned an important lesson 
about this—that struggles and tribu-
lation produce perseverance; persever-
ance, character; and character, hope. 
And since that very first speech that 
I gave on the Senate floor, I have come 
to recognize something that all of us— 
that everyone here—has undoubtedly 
experienced—that our service to coun-
try is filled with moment after moment 
that gives us that lump in the throat, 
that brings a tear to our eyes, that fills 
our hearts with wonder for this Nation. 
Perhaps it happened to you when see-
ing the majesty of the United States 
Capitol brightly shining in all its glory 
on a crisp State of the Union Address 
night or maybe when we hear the pas-
sion in the voices of our colleagues as 
they tell the story of life and struggle 
and hope for the future. For me, these 
moments happen every day, and I am 
sure they do for you as well—just part 
of the wonder of this Nation and its 
Capitol. 
It was late at night for me nearly 10 
years ago when I was leaving the Cap-
itol building. I had walked through the 
Hall of Columns, and I heard some 
voices ahead near the door that I was 
heading toward. When I turned into the 
corridor, I saw a Capitol tour guide 
pointing at a phrase that was painted 
on the wall. I looked at it and read it 
too. It was William Jennings Bryan, 
and painted on the wall were these 
words: ‘‘Our government, conceived in 
freedom and purchased with blood, can 
be preserved only by constant vigi-
lance.’’ 
I looked at the group reading it, and 
there in the center of them all was a 
young veteran in a wheelchair with 
bandages around his knees where his 
legs used to be. The gravity of this 
place, that moment, and the duty that 
we owe to this Nation struck hard. 
As I walked home, I kept thinking 
about it—about those words, about 
that moment, about that veteran, 
about this Nation and our responsi-
bility. I thought about how that wall 
was painted with that phrase, but there 
are others that are blank and empty, 
spaces that have been left empty so 
that future generations can fill them in 
with their history—with new portraits 
and new phrases and new moments. But 
no matter the moment in time or the 
point in history, it is the same patri-
otic responsibility that we owe to this 
Chamber—to defend and serve our Na-
tion, her Constitution, and the Amer-
ican people. 
George Washington in his Farewell 
Address said that the name ‘‘Amer-
ican’’ must always exalt the just pride 
of patriotism. He spoke of our Con-
stitution and how it must be sacredly 
maintained and that virtue and wisdom 
must stamp every act. And despite the 
differences over policy and politics, it 
is our Union that ought to be consid-
ered as a main prop of our liberty, and 
that love of the one ought to endear us 
to the preservation of the other. 
I believe that is what LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER very eloquently spoke about on 
this very floor in his farewell just days 
ago. It is our country and the unity of 
nation that, despite our differences, 
will help preserve and will preserve our 
liberty. 
Washington offered his advice in his 
farewell as an old and affectionate 
friend—a friend who recognized our ob-
ligation to create a better starting 
point for every new generation. 
But how do we heed this advice in a 
world of viral social media, click bait, 
and sound bites? 
Colorado 
Senator 
Bill 
Armstrong 
once said that while he was firm in his 
principles, he was flexible on the de-
tails. We all come to this place because 
of our core values and beliefs about 
this Nation. Those principles make us 
who we are. They drive our actions. 
They drive our debates. But, today, it 
seems as though we live in a world 
where tactics are elevated to the same 
status and importance as principles, 
and staying true to principle means 
that the tactics used to achieve that 
principle are elevated to the same im-
portance as the principle itself. It is al-
ways my way or the highway. Senator 
Armstrong’s flexible details would now 
be derided as violations of principle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7259 
December 8, 2020 
We cannot govern when every tactic 
and detail is elevated to the level of 
principle. There is no compromise with 
this approach. We cannot find ways to 
bring people together for that unity of 
nation of which Washington spoke 
when the test for principles becomes so 
impossible to pass that only the very 
factions that he warned against can 
prevail. 
To my staff I often talk about this 
challenge as being one of the pillar and 
the paint. The pillars in a building are 
more than just ornamental. They are 
structurally necessary to the building 
itself. The pillars are our principles. 
They make us who we are. But the 
paint color—the details—we can figure 
that out together. 
We can respect the pillar and find 
agreement on the paint. We can hold 
people’s principles in place, respecting 
those core beliefs that make you who 
you are, while finding ways to work to-
gether to find solutions to common 
challenges. That is how we pass the 
test of unity that brings people to-
gether, 
respecting 
principles 
while 
achieving solutions, because not every 
detail is a principle, and not every 
principle is a detail, and we need a leg-
islative body that can recognize this. 
By doing so, we will follow through on 
the advice of Washington and preserve 
our liberty with unity of nation. 
Too many people have given up on 
the institutions of their government, 
and it is my hope that the American 
people will find this pillar-and-paint 
approach to be one that can make a 
difference because if they believe it— 
they believe that it will—then the 
American people will make sure their 
values are reflected in the representa-
tives they elect. 
Several years ago, I had the honor of 
meeting a man named Donald Strat-
ton. He came to my office accompanied 
by his family and the family of a sailor 
named Loren Bruner and the family of 
another sailor, Joe George. 
They were looking forward to yet an-
other commemoration of the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941—79 
years ago yesterday. Both Donald 
Stratton and Loren Bruno were on the 
USS Arizona when it was attacked. 
Donald Stratton was on one of the 
ship’s towers. He was surrounded by 
flame and surely believed that he 
would perish, when out of the chaos of 
that morning came a rope thrown by a 
yet-unknown-to-him 
sailor 
by 
the 
name of Joe George, who was aboard 
the USS Vestal, which was moored next 
to the USS Arizona. This rope saved 
Donald Stratton’s life and several 
other shipmates. 
No one knew their lifeline was 
thrown to them by Joe George until 
years later. Once they learned who it 
was, they spent the rest of their lives 
fighting to get Joe George honored and 
recognized by the Navy. 
I was honored to be a part of that ef-
fort, and, finally, on December 7, 2017, 
led by Donald Stratton and the Ari-
zona’s remaining few, Joe George re-
ceived the Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ device 
for valor aboard the USS Arizona Me-
morial, with Donald Stratton attend-
ing one last time. He was fighting for 
this country and his countrymen to the 
very end. 
When I asked him how he did it, how 
he survived the attack and those 
flames and got back into the fight for 
this Nation, he chuckled, he laughed, 
and he gave me an answer that I truly 
didn’t see coming at all. He said: ‘‘Well, 
Cory, everybody has to be somewhere.’’ 
Everybody has to be somewhere. He 
is right. We are here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. Most of you will still be here next 
Congress. Don’t waste this opportunity 
to be who this Nation needs you to be 
at this moment of great challenge, to 
recognize the difference between the 
paint and the pillar, to know the dif-
ference between a principle and a tac-
tic, where to take a stand and where to 
stand together, to bring a nation to-
gether in unity for the preservation of 
liberty, to recognize that to be Amer-
ican carries with it the greatness of a 
nation forged by fight and fire, tem-
pered by wisdom, and made great by 
men, like Donald Stratton, who recog-
nized that their duty and their time 
didn’t just end with the last calling of 
the roll. Everybody has to be some-
where. Make it count for this Nation 
that you are here. 
If you go into any of my offices, you 
will see on the wall my mission state-
ment, and it ends with this: 
We represent a State where the words to 
‘‘America the Beautiful’’ were written—we 
will always look up to the Rocky Mountain 
horizon in the work that we do and remind 
ourselves that only through our actions will 
God continue to shed his grace on our great 
nation. 
Ours is a Nation founded on the opti-
mism that no generation waits for the 
next to be told where to go. It is the 
great American horizon that compels 
us to continue to reach ahead, to rise, 
to achieve, and to believe in America. 
Ten years ago I sat on the floor of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives as we prepared—some of my col-
leagues here with me—to be sworn into 
the 112th Congress. I watched with our 
daughter Alyson patiently sitting by 
my side as the peaceful transition of 
power took place—the hallmark of our 
Republic. As the most powerful con-
stitutionally prescribed Member of the 
Congress, the Speaker of the House 
gave the gavel to a newly elected 
Speaker 
without 
gunshot 
or 
war, 
peacefully transitioning to a new ma-
jority. 
Today, I speak on the Senate floor 
with a heart of gratitude. As I leave, 
with a new Congress set to begin, I go 
home not because of or due to the 
threat of violence or revolution but be-
cause of the same constitutional gov-
ernance that has given this country 
over two centuries of strength and cer-
tainty—a jewel among nations, excep-
tionally blessed by God. 
It has been a privilege to serve with 
you for this country. We owe every 
man, woman, and child that lives here 
our commitment to them to not pass 
on to the next generation a nation that 
is in decline or retreat but a nation 
that rises, a nation that reminds itself 
that ours is a country worth fighting 
for, a nation that believes in itself, be-
cause when you believe in America, 
when you believe in this country, the 
world has not seen anything yet. 
Thank you to my colleagues. Thank 
you for the honor of serving with you. 
And, Madam President, this kid from 
Yuma yields the floor. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
want to take just a few minutes to 
speak about my colleague from Colo-
rado, Senator CORY
Gardner—a kid 
from Yuma, as he described himself a 
minute ago—and to recognize the work 
that we have done for our State to-
gether in a bipartisan way. 
Over the past 6 years, one of the most 
common 
and 
sometimes 
surprising 
questions I have gotten from reporters 
and constituents was: How is your rela-
tionship with Senator GARDNER? Can 
you work together with Senator GARD-
NER? 
It is really an innocent question, but 
I have come to think about it as a re-
flection of the sad state of our politics 
and the Senate for the moment, in par-
ticular. Behind the question is the as-
sumption that because CORY is a Re-
publican and I am a Democrat we, 
somehow, can’t work together for the 
benefit of our State. That hasn’t been 
the case, far from it. 
Sometimes he would say and some-
times I would say that we felt like 
there were times when we were work-
ing together better than States that 
were represented by two people from 
the same political party. 
In this Congress, Colorado is 1 of just 
10 States that isn’t represented by Sen-
ators from the same party. Think 
about that—just 1 of 10 States with a 
split caucus in this body, just 10 out of 
50. You would think it would be a lot 
higher, given how evenly divided we 
are as a country. 
A lot has been written about the di-
vide in our country today, and one of 
the divides is the rural-urban divide in 
America, which reporters like to talk 
about. In our delegation, CORY and I 
have tried to bridge that and, I have to 
say, it has helped a lot that CORY was 
born and raised in Yuma, CO, a town on 
the Eastern Plains with a population of 
3,500 people, roughly. It is the place 
where CORY grew up, working in his 
parents’ implement dealership—the red 
tractors, not the green tractors—where 
community tradition and ties to the 
land, like a lot of places in our State, 
run very, very deep; a place where rush 
hour means getting behind a tractor. 
It is a beautiful place, and CORY was 
kind enough to invite me to Yuma 
after he was elected. During that visit 
we made a commitment to work to-
gether despite our political differences,

which we certainly have, and that is 
exactly what we have tried to do over 
the past 6 years. We worked together 
on legislation to ban Members of Con-
gress from becoming lobbyists. I tell 
my colleagues today that I think there 
would be no bill we could pass that 
would do more to lift the reputation of 
this body than that one. Over half the 
people who leave here don’t retire but 
become lobbyists. It was hard to find 
somebody to cosponsor that legisla-
tion. CORY saw the benefit of it, and we 
have been fighting for it ever since. 
We wrote bipartisan legislation to 
prevent 
government 
shutdowns; 
to 
make our energy grid more resilient; to 
secure funding, as CORY mentioned, for 
the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a critical 
water project that Washington has 
been promising Colorado since John F. 
Kennedy came to Pueblo, when he was 
President. 
We fought to hold the VA account-
able to care for our veterans across the 
Rocky Mountain region. With CORY’s 
leadership, we fought to keep the U.S. 
Space 
Command 
in 
Colorado. 
We 
partnered to fund critical improve-
ments to our infrastructure, from I–25 
along the Front Range to the South-
west Chief. 
And just last week, Senator COLLINS, 
127 years after Colorado became the 
first State to grant women the vote by 
popular referendum and 100 years after 
ratification of the 19th Amendment, 
the Senate passed our bill to install 
America’s 
first 
outdoor 
monument 
honoring the women’s suffrage move-
ment here in Washington, DC. 
That was typical of the legislation 
that we carried together, because the 
idea actually came from Fort Collins, 
CO. It didn’t come from Washington, 
DC. So many of the best ideas that we 
worked on together came from Colo-
rado. CORY is a student of Colorado his-
tory and the country’s history, and he 
understands the significance of a bill 
like that. 
Over the years we have worked to-
gether late into the night to help com-
munities across our State get back on 
their feet after devastating floods, 
wildfires, the Gold King Mine spill of 
2015, and now the COVID–19 pandemic, 
where CORY’s leadership was absolutely 
essential. 
I could go on all afternoon. 
The point is, even though CORY and I 
have had plenty of differences over the 
years, there is a real record of bipar-
tisan accomplishment for our State, 
and one of the reasons for that is be-
cause, whatever our differences on pol-
icy, I have never for a moment doubted 
CORY’s commitment to serving the in-
terests of Colorado and his genuine ap-
preciation for what makes us the best 
State in America. 
In a lot of ways, CORY has embodied 
many of our State’s best qualities. We 
are a young and restless State, and 
CORY has represented it always with 
energy and with drive. Agree with him 
or not, you can’t say he hasn’t worked 
hard every single second that he has 
been here. 
You have probably also heard that 
Colorado has 300 days of sunshine a 
year. As it turns out, so does CORY 
Gardner. It is probably why my staff 
always told me to smile more at our 
events together. He has been a con-
sistent source of warmth and optimism 
in a body desperate for both. He has 
brought a lot more of that to the 
Chamber than I have, and I have been 
trying to make up for it now that he 
won’t be here this year. 
All of that is to say that I have been 
extremely grateful for the opportunity 
to work with Senator GARDNER over 
the past 6 years to do a lot of work to-
gether for our State. 
On a personal level, I would like to 
say to his family that I also want to 
say how much I appreciated the con-
sistent kindness CORY and Jaime have 
shown to me and my family, even at 
moments that have been difficult ones 
for them. 
My staff are also deeply grateful for 
the close collaboration with CORY’s 
team over the years, and I want to 
thank them for their extraordinary 
work. 
I know there are a lot of folks today 
who have things to say about my col-
league from Colorado. So let me just 
end with this. Serving in this body, as 
he said, is an enormous privilege, but 
as everyone here knows, it does not 
come without a cost, especially for a 
parent with young children. I have 
watched CORY, as his kids have begun 
to grow up, put his family first at all 
times and our State a close second be-
hind them. To watch him get on a 
plane, as I did this week, with his fam-
ily and the care and attention he paid 
them is a reminder to me—and has 
been over the last 10 years—of what is 
really most important. 
I will miss our work together, but I 
suspect Senator GARDNER is not done 
with his contribution to the country, 
to the State of Colorado, and to his 
community, and I look forward to con-
tinuing our work together in whatever 
capacity he ends up choosing to serve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Madam 
President, 
CORY Gardner and I first met in 2011, 
when he became the first alumnus of 
the United States Senate Youth Pro-
gram to be sworn into the House of 
Representatives. As the first Senate 
Youth Program delegate elected to the 
U.S. Senate, I felt an immediate con-
nection to this new Member of Con-
gress from Colorado. One year, both of 
us had the privilege of addressing the 
student delegates to this wonderful 
program that had made such a dif-
ference in the lives of both of us. 
Since he joined the Senate 6 years 
ago, CORY has demonstrated his leader-
ship on many issues which we have 
heard described today. His upbeat per-
sonality and his commitment to com-
promise, to solutions, and to biparti-
sanship have had a positive influence 
on this Chamber. As the renowned col-
umnist George Will once called CORY, 
he is ‘‘a human beam of sunshine.’’ I 
am sure that is the phrase that was 
going through the mind of his col-
league from Colorado. 
His approach to legislating has in-
deed been enlightening, but it has been 
his positive approach to every problem 
that we encounter, his upbeat person-
ality, his wonderful smiles, and his 
problem-solving devotion to America 
and to his State that have distin-
guished him. 
CORY’s landmark achievement, which 
he discussed today, is the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. I was proud to co-
sponsor his legislation. This historic 
bill, at long last, fully and perma-
nently funds the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and provides funding to 
address significant parts of the multi-
billion-dollar national parks mainte-
nance backlog. The Great American 
Outdoors Act will help to ensure that 
both current and future generations 
can enjoy the pristine beauty of our 
natural treasures in Colorado, in the 
great State of Maine, and throughout 
our country. CORY’s hard work to 
bridge the partisan divide and secure 
support from both sides of the aisle 
leave a lasting legacy that the Amer-
ican people will cherish. I would note 
that he never gave up in his pursuit of 
seeing this landmark legislation signed 
into law. 
That is typical of the approach that 
CORY takes. He doesn’t give up. He per-
sists. But he does so in such a delight-
ful way—always in search of a solu-
tion—that it is very difficult for his 
colleagues to ever say no to him. 
CORY’s 
commitment 
to 
environ-
mental stewardship extends from the 
great outdoors to the frontier of tech-
nology to advance the development and 
deployment of energy from renewable, 
sustainable, and clean energy sources. 
CORY, as was mentioned by Senator 
BENNET, has also been a champion for 
those who have served our Nation in 
uniform. In 2017, a troubling GAO re-
port revealed an unacceptable trend of 
VA 
facilities 
failing 
to 
report 
healthcare providers who made major 
medical errors to the boards respon-
sible for tracking dangerous practi-
tioners, or, in some cases, revoking or 
suspending their licenses. As a result, 
these practitioners can go into private 
practice from their work at the VA or 
simply move across State lines without 
disclosing prior performance problems 
to either patients or State regulators. 
To solve this serious problem, CORY 
introduced the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Provider Accountability Act. 
His bill, which passed the Senate 
unanimously, helps to protect patients 
by requiring the VA to disclose major 
errors committed by its medical pro-
viders. 
Time and again, I have seen CORY put 
into practice the values that the Sen-
ate Youth Program imparts to high 
school students—a deep respect for our 
enduring system of government, a dedi-
cation to public service, and a willing-
ness to work in a bipartisan spirit to 
get the job done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7261 
December 8, 2020 
It has been such an honor and a great 
joy to serve with CORY in the U.S. Sen-
ate. I am certain he will continue to 
serve his State and his country, and I 
wish him and his family all the best. 
Thank you, CORY, for all you have 
done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, well, 
some farewell speeches are different 
than others. I think this farewell 
speech should very much be just a mo-
mentary pause for us to think about 
what comes next. 
CORY Gardner is incredibly accom-
plished. He has been good for the Sen-
ate. He has been great with his col-
leagues, and he has been, beyond that, 
even more constantly focused on Colo-
rado. 
He has become, for me, a valued per-
sonal friend. Our families, for whatever 
reason, from almost the first time we 
spent any time together, sort of gravi-
tated toward each other and continued 
to do things together. And why not? 
Jaime is great. CORY is that beam of 
sunshine that Senator BENNET and Sen-
ator COLLINS both have talked about, 
365 days a year. He is optimistic. He is 
determined. He is realistic. Those are 
all three pretty doggone good charac-
teristics for a successful legislator. He 
also continues to figure out, OK, that 
didn’t work and what can we do that 
makes that work in some other way, to 
be determined to get the job done, to 
be realistic about how an obstacle can 
be in the way and understand how to 
come together and make all those 
things work. 
Now, Senator COLLINS, particularly, 
mentioned that long list of truly great 
legislative fights that CORY has suc-
cessfully led in. One of them we worked 
together on has been the effort to be 
sure that people who weren’t able to 
get broadband—people in rural areas 
and people in urban areas who maybe 
had broadband but couldn’t afford it. 
By the way, I think that is the next big 
fight about broadband. It is not just ac-
cessibility but also, even though it 
may be running right by where you 
live, how do we work in ways that as-
sure you are part of it. 
In little towns like I grew up in or 
CORY grew up in, it is the difference in 
whether you can compete or not. We 
have seen that so dramatically in the 
last few months, where kids going to 
school without the ability to have that 
access were dramatically hampered by 
that. 
People 
who 
couldn’t 
use 
broadband for mental health or tele-
health and people who just couldn’t 
live where they prefer to live because 
they didn’t have the connectedness 
they need to have are hampered by 
that. That is a fight that CORY has 
been in the middle of, and he under-
stood it only maybe as you would un-
derstand it if half of your State is 
vertical and the other half is hori-
zontal. You have got to figure out how 
to get the connectedness you would 
like to have. 
The second century of the National 
Park System, one of the truly great 
American miracles, will be dramati-
cally different than it would have been 
otherwise because of the legislation 
that CORY led on. In thinking about the 
future of that system and thinking 
about the future of the country, I re-
member one of the first stories I heard 
CORY tell, after he got here, in a small 
group of people. I think his son Thatch-
er was headed out the door that he 
wasn’t supposed to be going out, and 
CORY said: That reminds me of one of 
my speeches late in the campaign. I 
was done. I thought we were all done. I 
look around, and Thatcher’s shoes are 
still on the platform, even though 
Thatcher shouldn’t have ever been on 
the platform. 
And as CORY goes back to pick up 
Thatcher’s shoes, he holds them up and 
says: This is why I am running. This is 
why I am running—for this little pair 
of shoes and all the other pairs of shoes 
that represent the future. 
I think CORY has done an incredible 
job here focusing on not just the 
present but the future. Frankly, as 
Senator BENNET said, I am personally 
interested in seeing what comes next in 
the future of a person and a family who 
have so much to offer and are willing 
to offer it in service to others. 
This is a day that I am ready to look 
and see what the next chapter of the 
Gardner story looks like and I think it 
is going to be optimistic and I think 
CORY
will be smiling all the way 
through it. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NOMINATION OF NATHAN A. SIMINGTON 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to urge my col-
leagues to vote against the nomination 
of Nathan Simington to be a member of 
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion. 
We definitely want the FCC to focus 
on commonsense consumer protections, 
universal broadband, and the survival 
of our news and local journalism indus-
try as it faces unbelievable and unfair 
competition and practices by the tech 
sector, and we also want to make sure 
that the next President of the United 
States also gets to choose their mem-
ber and representation to the FCC. 
The Senate has a tradition of con-
firming Commission nominees in pairs 
to ensure equality on both sides of the 
aisle. I think moving this nominee 
without that democratic paring is con-
trary to what we have usually operated 
under in good governance. 
Every Member of this body should be 
concerned about setting a precedent 
and what it will mean in the future if 
we don’t have essential consumer pro-
tections and oversight in this impor-
tant institution. 
We 
need 
high-quality, 
affordable 
broadband for the underserved and the 
unserved. That includes Tribal coun-
try. 
We need to make sure that we are 
working hard as a result of the pan-
demic and for people to understand 
that broadband is now essential to our 
healthcare, to being able to work, and 
certainly to the education of our chil-
dren. According to the AP, 16 percent 
of families with children have no ac-
cess to broadband, and we need to 
make sure that all students have the 
tools for distance learning. 
We need to make sure that Washing-
tonians have access to broadband for 
healthcare centers and clinics and to 
make sure that their initial contacts 
can be done online, just to help us in 
fighting the pandemic. 
Especially, we need to preserve a free 
and open internet that is not divided 
into haves and have-nots. 
The innovation economy is so impor-
tant to my State, but it is important 
to the entire United States, and we 
need to have nominees who will fight 
for these policies, to get them imple-
mented. That is why it is important 
that we look at FCC Commissioners. 
Mr. Simington was before our Com-
merce Committee. We had another 
nominee 
whom 
the 
White 
House 
abruptly, unexpectedly pulled from its 
renomination—Commissioner 
O’Rielly—just days after the com-
mittee reported that nomination to the 
Senate, allegedly because he spoke his 
mind and because he did not agree with 
the President of the United States. Mr. 
Simington was nominated instead just 
a few weeks later, coming from NTIA, 
which asks the FCC to issue rules. 
It raises questions in my mind about 
the 
White 
House’s 
choice 
in 
Mr. 
Simington, particularly given these 
issues as it relates to the FCC and key 
responsibilities. I have questions about 
his neutrality and independence on 
issues 
before 
the 
Commission 
and 
about whether he aggressively and ac-
tively sought the media attention to 
personally and explicitly direct pres-
sure onto the FCC. This involvement 
might sound insignificant or just par-
tisan to some, but it is so important 
for the FCC to continue to play an im-
portant and independent role from the 
President of the United States. 
So I hope we will not pass the 
Simington nomination. But I am em-
phasizing to my colleagues that the 
President will deserve his nominee as 
well, and I hope our colleagues will 
move quickly to confirm them once 
they are nominated. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Madam President, I also wanted to 
take a couple of minutes to discuss ac-
tion that all of us have been working 
on on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, 
and that is the action that has now re-
sulted in the National Defense Author-
ization Act which we will be taking up

December 8, 2020 
but which is certainly being considered 
in the House of Representatives today. 
The reason this is so important to 
emphasize today is that in this legisla-
tion will be the Coast Guard bill and 
recognition of the fact that we truly 
are an Arctic nation. 
Well, some of you may have said: 
Well, I think we already got geography; 
we knew we were an Arctic nation. But 
this is the first time that we will be au-
thorizing a fleet of six icebreakers for 
the United States of America. 
Some people think: Well, why is that 
important? What is so important about 
icebreakers? Well, certainly to the 
Northwest Passage and the ability to 
move cargo and to move people and to 
new transportation routes, it is very 
important. 
When you look at where we are in the 
United States of America with an 
icebreaking fleet, we don’t compete 
with other nations that have been able 
to access and transverse those water-
ways because they have somebody who 
can clean the waterway and make it 
safe and secure. That is why we need, 
in the United States, to have an 
icebreaking fleet beyond the capacity 
we have today, which is two vessels but 
basically not the full capacity of those 
two vessels. 
This is why it is so important for us 
to put the money and investment into 
a program to get us icebreakers so that 
we, too, can look at this northern wa-
terway and passage and say to the 
United States of America and to the 
world community: Yes, we will be in 
the Arctic as well. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle realize that this is a very bipar-
tisan issue, that it is a national secu-
rity issue, and that it is an environ-
mental issue. It is about us and making 
sure that we communicate. 
I have also supported additional lan-
guage about an Arctic shipping Federal 
advisory 
committee. 
A 
committee 
made up of representatives from Fed-
eral agencies, including the Coast 
Guard and the Department of Defense, 
the Secretary of Transportation, and 
others would be part of a process to en-
sure that our Arctic efforts are better 
coordinated and impactful. 
So I hope that my colleagues will 
look favorably on this legislation. 
We all know how important the 
Coast Guard is to our Nation and an ex-
ample of that icebreaking capacity, 
but there are other aspects of this 
Coast Guard bill that we are also proud 
of—making sure that it works more 
robustly with fishermen on fishing 
safety; doing more to examine the im-
pacts of tar sands; making sure that 
our orca population is saved from noise 
impact and further reducing that im-
pact on our orca population; and insti-
tuting new reforms within the Coast 
Guard to really help empower women, 
to make significant investment in the 
40 percent of the workforce of the 
Coast Guard that are women and to 
make sure they have what they need— 
vital childcare opportunities for Coast 
Guard families—and to make sure 
there is zero tolerance in the approach 
for any kind of sexual assault or sexual 
harassment. 
So with these improvements over all, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Chairman 
WICKER, Senator SULLIVAN, and Sen-
ator MARKEY
for working on all of 
these issues. I want to thank Senator 
MURKOWSKI, as I said, for the Arctic 
Shipping Federal Advisory Committee 
and many people who are helping us 
get to this point, to say not only do we 
recognize geographically we are an 
Arctic nation, but we are going to do 
something about it by making sure we 
have the capacity on this waterway to 
be heard and seen and to help the com-
merce that is going to emerge from the 
new developments in the Arctic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
four different times in the last 4 
months, we have had votes on this 
floor to talk about COVID relief. There 
is a real need to be able to give relief 
to a lot of people in my State, and, 
quite frankly, in States around the 
country. 
There are individual items that need 
to be done that are unfinished. I think 
we need to actually finish them. We 
have this week and next week to finish 
the task at hand. We have 12 appropria-
tions bills. We have a national defense 
authorization. But in my State, people 
want to know most what is going to 
happen with COVID relief. Where is 
that going to go? 
Well, apparently, now we can actu-
ally have the debate. After the election 
was over, Speaker PELOSI announced 
that she was ready to actually nego-
tiate the bill now that the election was 
finished. Well, great. Folks in my State 
have actually been waiting because 
four times in the last 4 months we 
brought up bills that were serious bills 
to be able to actually debate this out 
and to get the aid that is needed to be 
done, starting with additional money 
for distribution for vaccines. 
The first vaccine will come on mar-
ket by this Friday. It will be in arms 
by this weekend or at the latest, Mon-
day, in my State, in Oklahoma. 
As I visit with the people in my State 
who are in charge of the distribution, 
they have a terrific plan that they are 
engaged in to work with healthcare 
providers across the State to give them 
first access. For these folks who have 
been living in PPE for months and 
months and months, to now have the 
opportunity to get a vaccine will be a 
tremendous gift to them. It is incred-
ibly important that this happen. 
I do want to congratulate the folks in 
the science community, the folks who 
are at Operation Warp Speed in the 
White House, and so many other indi-
viduals who worked so incredibly hard 
to take a vaccine from first identifica-
tion of the virus to a vaccine in 11 
months. That is remarkable speed to 
get something done, though I have read 
recently that the New York Times is 
now putting out this quiet little accu-
sation that the Trump administration 
didn’t buy enough of the Pfizer vac-
cine, and the rest of the world is going 
to get it. The Times just conveniently 
leaves out that the administration ac-
tually purchased 700 million doses of 
the vaccine from multiple different 
manufacturers very early on, taking 
the appropriate risk to say that we 
don’t know which one is going to be 
successful, so let’s try to purchase 
from all of them, not knowing if six of 
them will be successful or if one of 
them will be successful. It was the 
right strategy then. It remains the 
right strategy. 
In addition to the fact that the Pfizer 
vaccine is coming out first—which we 
are all very grateful for—it is 95 per-
cent accurate as far as setting aside 
the virus. It is 100 percent effective 
against severe outbreaks of the virus. 
It is a remarkable vaccine, but it has 
to be stored at negative 70 degrees. 
There are very few places in my State 
and in many other States that have an 
ultracold freezer that maintains that. 
It is a great vaccine, but it is limited 
in the way that you can actually dis-
tribute it quickly. 
There is a Moderna vaccine that is 
coming a week later that we will actu-
ally have twice as much of, but it 
doesn’t require the same ultracold 
storage. 
So this first round of vaccines will be 
coming to my State by this weekend, 
another round of vaccines from another 
manufacturer by next weekend, and by 
the end of this year—in just the next 
few weeks—we will have 20 million peo-
ple who will get vaccinated. 
That is a great start, but, clearly, 
there are another 300 million people to 
go. By the time that we get to the end 
of February, we will have 100 million 
people who will have been vaccinated, 
and that doesn’t even count the addi-
tional vaccines that are coming online. 
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a 
single-dose vaccine. It should be online 
in February. That is very significant to 
us because that will also provide us 
tens of millions of additional individ-
uals who can be vaccinated. We could 
very well be completely vaccinated as 
a country by the time we get to this 
summer. We could be completely vac-
cinated with the most vulnerable in 
our 
population—everyone 
in 
our 
healthcare, every single nursing home, 
every single skilled nursing, every sin-
gle assisted living, and all those with 
high-risk conditions like Parkinson’s 
and Alzheimer’s and individuals with 
diabetes and heart disease—those indi-
viduals could be completely vaccinated

December 8, 2020 
by the time we get to February. That 
is just 2 months away. We are finally 
getting close. 
But we do need some additional dol-
lars set aside for the distribution to ac-
tually get to that point. We need addi-
tional dollars for testing. We have done 
200 million tests on COVID–19. I have 
had several of those. Most everyone in 
this Chamber has had several. Most ev-
eryone across my State has had several 
to evaluate them. I always tested nega-
tive. I am grateful for that. There are 
many people who still continue to get 
that testing. We need to continue that. 
We have individuals across my State 
and across all of our States who need 
access to the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. This was a risk that we took in 
March to try an assistance for individ-
uals in a completely different way, 
knowing that the unemployment as-
sistance in all of our States is anti-
quated and would be overrun by indi-
viduals. There had to be another way 
to sustain individuals who would be un-
employed and to sustain small busi-
nesses to not go out of business as we 
go through this. 
What we created was something 
called the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. I was honored to be a part of 
that small group who helped write this 
and dream it out. It was for small busi-
nesses and not-for-profits, and for the 
first time ever, included faith-based 
not-for-profits, knowing many of them 
are key safety nets in our communities 
across the country. We could not lose 
that safety net during the time of the 
pandemic. 
I have had individuals who have 
asked me over and over again for two 
key things in the Paycheck Protection 
Program: No. 1, please make it clear 
how to get final forgiveness to close 
this out. There are literally millions of 
small businesses that have a paycheck 
protection loan. They want to get for-
given, but the process of going through 
forgiveness is so complicated they are 
struggling with closing that out. They 
want to get it done. 
There is an easy way to do it that 
KEVIN
CRAMER
has actually coordi-
nated and led in this body. Senator 
CRAMER’s work has been remarkable 
and tenacious to help guide us to a 
simple solution to get to individuals 
and businesses that took out loans of 
$150,000 or less, to get forgiveness for 
that in a simple process, in a single- 
page attestation to be able to do that. 
That needs to be included in whatever 
we are doing. 
We need to have a second round for 
those businesses that are the hardest 
hit. 
Let me tell you an example of that. I 
had a business leader of a small busi-
ness in my State just yesterday, and 
this is part of his email. He said: It 
sounds like there is a chance for an-
other relief bill. I hope that is true. We 
are expecting—our sales have fallen 
through the floor again. With the 
change in weather and rising case 
counts, we have lost over 50 percent 
year over year, and I hear the same 
from many of my counterparts. It is 
highly likely we will have to go 
through another round of furloughs in 
January. Honestly, it would probably 
make sense now, but we are not going 
to do that to anyone through the holi-
days. We are hoping for some assist-
ance to keep people on payroll and ben-
efits. At worst case, if there is no relief 
for us, I hope there is additional unem-
ployment coming so people aren’t des-
titute. It may be April before we are 
able to support our business based on 
our own revenue. 
These comments are not uncommon 
from many others I have received. 
They can make this and have a viable 
business but just not in this kind of en-
vironment right now. 
What are we going to do about that? 
Well, I have recommended not only the 
attestation for forgiveness for small 
businesses but also a second round to 
allow those who have been through the 
small business Paycheck Protection 
Program to go through it again and get 
a second bite of that apple short term 
for the hardest hit businesses and also 
to allow some of those businesses that 
are legitimate small businesses to ac-
tually get a first shot. 
Many people don’t know that not-for- 
profits, including faith-based not-for- 
profits and small businesses, all got ac-
cess to the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram if you were supported by donors 
or by a bank or credit union. But if 
your business was organized by private 
equity, and that was your original cap-
ital, you couldn’t get access to the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
So 
thousands and thousands of small busi-
nesses were out simply based on where 
they got their original capital from to 
open their business. That is not right. 
When we have the second round of 
paycheck protection, we should at 
least allow some of those other small 
businesses to get a first round through 
this process. We need to continue what 
we are doing for not-for-profits. 
Our safety nets are very clear in 
America. Our families are our first 
safety net; our second safety net is our 
not-for-profits; and our third safety net 
is government—State, local, and Fed-
eral. That second safety net that is out 
there that is so important in our com-
munities, we need to do what we can to 
support them. 
In the CARES Act, I helped put in a 
provision there that would give every 
American a $300 deduction on their 
taxes above the line, even if they don’t 
itemize their taxes. They can get a $300 
straight deduction from their taxes if 
they will give to a nonprofit. They can 
pick any nonprofit they want to give 
to—the arts community, the homeless 
community, those that are helping 
with mental health, those that are 
helping with food programs, churches, 
synagogues, mosques. They can choose 
any nonprofit they want to. If they 
give to a nonprofit, every single Amer-
ican gets a deduction up to $300. That 
counts for this year. I would encourage 
Americans to take advantage of that. 
Nonprofits around the country des-
perately need assistance right now. 
What we have written into a proposal 
is to double that for next year for indi-
viduals, $600, or for a couple filing 
jointly, $1,200. You could write off your 
taxes completely, even if you don’t 
itemize, if you would donate that 
amount to a not-for-profit. 
What would cause that? Philosophi-
cally, for me, it is a couple of things. I 
believe in the power and strength and 
efficiencies of not-for-profits. In small 
towns around my State and around the 
country, there are local not-for-profits 
and churches and faith-based institu-
tions, and they are doing the work to 
help the hurting and hungry and home-
less. We should support them. They are 
in real need right now of our support. 
There are groups all around our Na-
tion that need people to step up and 
walk alongside them as they walk 
alongside the neediest in our commu-
nities. The best way we can do that is 
to incentivize that with taxes. We can 
either say we could have a larger tax 
piece here or encourage people to actu-
ally give locally. I think that is an effi-
cient way to help people. 
We need to step up, as my friend who 
had emailed me yesterday reminded 
me. If we can’t get the paycheck pro-
tection extension done—and I hope we 
can—we need to make sure the unem-
ployment extension is done because we 
are going to have more people on un-
employment. We should really do both. 
We can extend paycheck protections 
to protect those individuals in those 
businesses and secure them, but we 
also need to secure our unemployment 
assistance program. We have many 
folks 
with 
diabetes 
and 
other 
healthcare needs who can’t return to 
work right now. They are not in a posi-
tion where they can telework, and they 
need the opportunity to be sustained. 
Literally, their benefits are running 
out in days. 
This is a moment we should extend 
that out for multiple more months to 
allow them the gap they need to get 
through the pandemic to be able to get 
a vaccine—which is coming soon—and 
then to get back to work as they have 
been dying to do. 
We need to get liability protections. 
A lot of people have a lot of uncer-
tainty, and they are worried about law-
suits coming down on them. They don’t 
know how to manage around them. 
I have letters from small businesses, 
large businesses, and university presi-
dents in my State who are all saying 
the same thing: Help us just know what 
the rules of the game are going to be 
because there is litigation coming at 
us, and we don’t know how to evaluate 
this because this has never been done 
before. Help us just know the rules of 
the road on liability. 
That is not an unreasonable request 
for every university, large and small 
businesses across our Nation. Schools 
are going to need some additional help. 
That is based on just that child, no

matter where they attend—public, pri-
vate, faith-based, charter, whatever it 
may be—it is a child whose parent is a 
taxpayer. Education is important, and 
they should all be treated the same. 
Childcare issues are at the top of the 
list as well. Childcare facilities are out 
there in desperate need right now and 
are open and functioning. They can’t 
have the worker or job ratio they used 
to have, but the costs are still the 
same. We need to get additional flexi-
bility to our States. In my State— 
many entities within my State still 
have additional dollars left over from 
the CARES Act. So $1.5 billion came to 
the State of Oklahoma through the 
CARES Act. That is an enormous 
amount of money. They are still work-
ing through to be able to handle it effi-
ciently, how they are going to manage 
that. Thankfully, most towns in my 
State have had sales tax revenue that 
has gone up this year. That is not true 
for all of it, but for many of them, it 
has been. Their expenses have also 
gone up. 
So the challenge at this point would 
be, how can we get the States max-
imum flexibility with the dollars they 
have to make sure they don’t have to 
squander those funds quickly just to be 
able to get it done because the deadline 
to use them is December 31? More flexi-
bility would be a good gift both to do 
wise spending and to be able to give 
them greater flexibility in the days 
ahead. That would be for States, coun-
ties, cities, and Tribes. 
We should allow for the reprogram-
ming of funds. Interestingly enough, 
the Paycheck Protection Program had 
about $130 billion left over in it when it 
expired. We all gave it a lot of money 
not knowing how much would be need-
ed for small businesses, but the vast 
majority of small businesses that could 
take it were able to take it. There are 
many, as I mentioned before, that are 
wanting to do a second round with it. 
The best way to do that is to repro-
gram the unused funds that are there. 
That would be more efficient. The Fed-
eral Reserve has unused funds in the 
hundreds of billions of dollars. We 
should cancel out those programs and 
reuse those funds. That is a wise use of 
funds to make sure we are not squan-
dering American tax dollars. 
Every single dollar that is spent on 
COVID–19 right now is debt money. So 
we should pay attention to all of those 
issues of debt money, knowing that we 
need to be careful with other people’s 
money. 
There are things that we need to do 
in the next 10 days here as well as to 
have conversations in private and in 
public, like this, to say: Let’s get it 
done. Let’s finish the tasks that we 
need to get done. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Madam President, I would like to 
take one moment of personal privilege. 
About an hour ago, while sitting in 
this chair behind me, I had the oppor-
tunity to listen to a friend speak on 
the Senate floor for the last time, my 
friend CORY GARDNER. 
CORY GARDNER and I came to the 
House of Representatives together in 
2011. We became fast friends for his 
winning smile and his tenacious work 
ethic. He is a solid guy for whom I have 
great respect. We came to the Senate 
together at the same time as well. We 
served 4 years in the House together 
and now have served 6 years in the Sen-
ate together. He just lost his election 
in November, and he will be heading 
back to Colorado. I will miss my friend. 
CORY and I had a lot of great con-
versations about a lot of legislation. 
We had a lot of conversations about 
our families. During the times that we 
would occasionally sit side by side in 
Bible studies here, we had lots of time 
to talk. I will not forget one key mo-
ment, though. It was our first day in 
the U.S. Senate, in this Chamber, when 
one of the staff approached us and said: 
The two of you have the same number 
of years in the House of Representa-
tives, and you are both coming in from 
the same class to the Senate, which 
means you are tied for seniority in the 
Senate, and your seniority has to be re-
solved by a coin toss. 
So CORY and I stood there, side by 
side, while we flipped a coin. I won, and 
I rubbed it in to him for 6 years that I 
had seniority over him in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
As I sat and listened to him speak for 
the last time today and talk about pa-
triotism and his incredible love for his 
State and his country, all I could think 
of was, this is the guy I have seniority 
over, my friend, whom I will miss here. 
CORY, thank you for being a great 
servant of the people of Colorado and a 
fantastic workaholic, happy warrior 
Senator. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
NOMINATION OF NATHAN A. SIMINGTON 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, in just a few moments, we will 
vote on the nomination of Nathan 
Simington to be a member of the Fed-
eral Communications Commission. We 
will do so in the middle of a pandemic 
when this agency is of more impor-
tance than ever to students, busi-
nesses, and families who are vitally de-
pendent on broadband, on the con-
sumer protection that this agency pro-
vides, and to net neutrality, which is a 
vital issue for them and for our coun-
try. 
‘‘Nathan Simington’’ is not exactly a 
household word, but his name and his 
presence on the FCC will have impor-
tant meaning to households around the 
Nation; nor is the ‘‘FCC’’ a household 
word, but it, too, affects literally hun-
dreds of millions of households. The 
FCC will have an increasingly impor-
tant role in this Nation as we conquer 
the pandemic and deal with the eco-
nomic crisis that faces this Nation. 
There are 15 to 16 million students 
who are locked out of the internet be-
cause 
of 
the 
unavailability 
of 
broadband connectivity or devices that 
make the internet real in their lives. 
The FCC is the key to their partici-
pating in schools, and it is the key to 
businesses being able to communicate 
with customers. The FCC is at the 
crossroads of making rights real. Na-
than Simington is dangerous to those 
rights and to the FCC at this moment 
in history. 
Why is he the nominee? The answer 
is that the current FCC Commissioner, 
Michael O’Rielly, was originally nomi-
nated for another term, and the Com-
merce Committee even held a vote for 
him in July. Yet, after Twitter and 
Facebook had the temerity to label 
Donald Trump’s misinformation about 
voting and COVID–19, the President 
issued an Executive order that had the 
simple purpose of retaliating against 
these social media platforms. The 
President, in effect, demanded that the 
FCC revise section 230 of the Commu-
nications Decency Act in order to pun-
ish those companies for the mild incon-
venience of a fact check. They didn’t 
take down his posts; they said they 
needed to fact check them. 
Commissioner 
O’Rielly 
recognized 
the dangers and the potential illegality 
of the President’s Executive order. 
Again, he had the temerity to speak up 
and tell the American public on C– 
SPAN that he had ‘‘deep reservations’’ 
if they, meaning Congress, ‘‘provided 
any additional authority for the FCC 
in this matter.’’ In a later speech, he 
appeared to challenge the order on 
First Amendment grounds, which it 
well-deserved, in fact, because it poten-
tially violated the First Amendment. 
Despite years of a pristine record of 
Republican positions, this objection 
now was disqualifying to Commissioner 
O’Rielly in the view of the White 
House. The President pulled his nomi-
nation and substituted Mr. Simington, 
who was well qualified, for he had 
auditioned for the role of doing the 
President’s 
bidding. 
We 
know 
Mr. 
Simington tried to pressure the FCC to 
cave in to the White House and to 
rightwing media outlets on this very 
issue, section 230. It is an unprece-
dented assault on the integrity and 
independence of the FCC, and he was 
clearly the White House’s wingman on 
this issue. 
Very simply, Nathan Simington is 
the wrong person and is clearly the 
wrong person at the wrong time for the 
FCC. He is unprepared and unqualified. 
Last month, before the Senate Com-
merce Committee, he was asked about 
his plan for the FCC. He couldn’t pro-
vide one single measure for which he 
would advocate. He couldn’t answer 
even basic questions from Democrats 
and Republicans. His answers were in-
adequate, incomplete, and evasive. I 
asked him again, in the questions for 
the record, to say three steps that he 
would take to provide and prepare for 
those millions of students who are out 
of the classroom and lack connectivity 
to the internet, which now is like lack-
ing connection to the classroom. A stu-
dent without that connectivity is, in 
effect, barred from the classroom. He

couldn’t provide one meaningful re-
sponse or step, even in writing, and 
that is plainly alarming. It should be 
disqualifying. 
This nomination, though, is dan-
gerous on more than any single issue 
because it threatens the independence 
and political integrity of the FCC. The 
political independence and integrity of 
the FCC depend on its balance. Nor-
mally, nominations are paired politi-
cally to reflect the bipartisan balance 
of the agency. What we will have at the 
FCC now is potential gridlock. 
One month ago, voters overwhelm-
ingly elected a new President, and he 
has promised to close the homework 
gap, the digital divide, to reinstate net 
neutrality, and to renew our commit-
ment to consumer protection. This 
nomination threatens all of those goals 
for a new administration. In fact, the 
Senate has traditionally moved these 
nominations in bipartisan pairs, which 
is lacking here. In fact, it is contra-
dicted by this nomination. 
I think the purpose of confirming 
this nominee, very simply, is to dead-
lock the Commission and undermine 
the President-elect’s ability to achieve 
the mandate the American people have 
given him and his administration in 
going forward. That may be what the 
giant 
telecommunications 
industry 
wants. It may be what the media com-
panies hope to achieve—an FCC that is 
absent or neutralized, an FCC that is 
gridlocked and dysfunctional. I hope it 
is not the result of this nomination if 
he is confirmed, but my fear is that it 
will be, and if it is, this body bears a 
responsibility. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this nominee for the sake of those 16 
million students who are now lacking 
in having a connection to the internet. 
That connectivity is essential to their 
lives and their educational progress. I 
urge this body to vote against him be-
cause he is dangerous to an agency 
that is supposed to be independent and 
above politics. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

December 8, 2020 
UAE ARMS SALES 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have 
a vote coming up—it could be the end 
of this week—that has to do with the 
arms sales to the United Arab Emir-
ates. I strongly support this; however, 
some of my colleagues do not support 
it, and there is now a joint resolution 
of disapproval. I would hope that we 
would really stop and think about that 
because this is a very significant thing 
that we are talking about. 
The agreement between Israel and 
UAE is one of the Abraham Accords. It 
is a very significant one. It is one that 
President Trump was able to get to-
gether with the two countries, Israel 
and UAE, and it is really a great thing. 
It is a major breakthrough in the Mid-
dle East. 
He has done a lot of great things, the 
President has. I know he is controver-
sial, but in terms of his energy policy, 
the military, and the economy he has 
been right on target. 
So anyway, Arab-Israeli peace is not 
unprecedented, but the agreement be-
tween Israel and the UAE has moved 
further and faster than any other 
agreements that preceded it in the 
past. 
It seems that the UAE and Israel are 
finding new areas of cooperation al-
most every day. They are now working 
together on security, pandemic re-
sponse, education, and even media. 
This partnership is deep and reflects 
the growing acceptance of our friend 
Israel in the region. 
Most importantly, it did not require 
Israel to do anything. They didn’t have 
to give up anything. So this is a major, 
major achievement. Now is the time to 
take advantage of the gains that we 
have. 
President Trump has treated Israel 
like a friend, and other countries have 
rushed in to that friendship. We have 
several other countries in Africa and in 
the Middle East who are joined in with 
Israel that have never been there be-
fore. 
The sale ensures that Israel’s quali-
tative military edge is not affected. We 
know this because the Israelis them-
selves have said this. Moreover, this 
sale deepens the UAE’s partnership 
with the United States and prevents it 
from turning toward China and Russia. 
Now, this is the problem that we 
have. If we don’t do this, if we don’t co-
operate with these countries in the 
Middle East, then you are going to 
have China and Russia out there tak-
ing advantage of it. 
The UAE is worthy of this sale be-
cause it is strongly aligned with the 
United States in the Middle East. It is 
a vital counterterrorism partner. The 
UAE has fought alongside our troops in 
Afghanistan and against ISIS. They 
have been our friend for a long time. 
It is also vital to the U.S. efforts 
against Iran—both Iran’s ambition of 
regional dominance and its support for 
terrorist proxies. 
Voting down this sale would signal to 
our partners that even when they do 
everything that we ask—fight along-
side our soldiers, pursue shared inter-
ests in the region, and make meaning-
ful 
peace 
with 
Israel—the 
United 
States won’t have their backs. This is 
not the reputation that we want to 
gain. 
The truth is, they are reliable, and 
we appreciate that. We are reliable, 
and the United States has long stood 
with its partner Israel against its ad-
versary, the Iranian regime. 
This sale to the UAE is consistent 
with that approach. Nobody here would 
support it if Israel were not on board, 
but they are on board. What is more, 
they will bolster our longstanding ef-
forts to counter Iran’s nefarious re-
gional activities. 
The UAE is a strong partner that al-
ready 
has 
cutting-edge 
technology 
from our F–16 activity. They have been 
using that fighter aircraft for a long 
period of time, and this sale of the F– 
35 fighter jet is a continuation of that 
partnership. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support the sale and to op-
pose 
the 
joint 
resolution 
of 
dis-
approval. A vote against the resolution 
is a vote for peace in the Middle East. 
A vote for this resolution is a vote to 
give Iran, China, and Russia more 
power and influence in that region, and 
it would make our world less safe. It 
would send a message, also, around the 
world 
that 
we 
don’t 
support 
our 
friends. It is a very significant vote to 
take place for the successes we have 
had in the Middle East, and I encour-
age people to oppose the resolution of 
disapproval. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to echo what the chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee said with 
regard to this upcoming vote. It is, ac-
tually, a very important vote, and I 
think that when you look at the lead-
ership of the UAE and what they have 
done, we are seeing major peace agree-
ments between our traditional Gulf 
Arab allies and Israel. This is really 
significant. This is a whole different 
approach to addressing some of the 
long-term challenges with regard to 
the Middle East, and it is starting to 
work. 
I think it is imperative that this 
body, particularly at this time, send a 
message of support to countries and 
leaders—the UAE, in particular, given 
this upcoming vote—that have taken 
risks. Leadership sometimes requires 
you to take risks, and we know that 
the history in the Middle East is some-
times—when you have countries and 
leaders who take risks with regard to 
peace with Israel, those leaders can ac-
tually have dire consequences. Look 
what happened in Egypt, after that 
peace agreement, with their leaders. 
I think it is very important that we, 
as a body, in a bipartisan, strong way 
come down in support not just of the 
progress that has been made in the re-
gion but also the broader strategic re-
alignment that is happening. 
Why is that happening? Because we 
all 
recognize—the 
United 
States, 
Israel, our traditional Gulf Arab allies, 
our traditional Arab allies in the re-
gion—that the biggest challenge, the 
biggest threat in the region is the ter-
rorist regime in Iran, which is the big-
gest challenge and biggest threat to 
peace and security in the region. 
There has been enormous progress. 
The President and his team deserve a 
lot of the credit. Rebuilding our mili-
tary deserves a lot of credit, which we 
have all done here. But we need to send 
a signal that policies that have been 
tried before, particularly policies that 
appease the largest state-sponsor of 
terrorism in the world, don’t work. The 
policies of strength, the policies of 
standing 
together—Israel, 
United 
States, our traditional Arab allies— 
that is what is working, and that is 
what is bringing peace. 
This vote that is going to happen 
soon is a lot more than just a vote on 
weapon sales. It is a vote on this body 
helping to cement the reorientation in 
the region toward peace and toward 
recognizing what the challenge is. 
The challenge that we all face is the 
biggest terrorist regime in the world, 
which threatens the United States, 
threatens Israel, threatens the UAE, 
and threatens Saudi Arabia. That is 
why we need a strong vote in the way 
the chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee just talked about. I am 
fully supportive of where he is, and I 
am hopeful that this body will vote for 
continued peace and strength, particu-
larly as it relates to the terrorist re-
gime in Iran, and not send the wrong 
signal to our friends and allies, par-
ticularly when historic progress—yes, 
it has been historic progress—is being 
made in the region. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING CASSIE JOHNSON 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
one of West Virginia’s finest. 
Patrolwoman Cassie Johnson of the 
Charleston 
Police 
Department 
rep-
resented the very best of who we are as 
a statewide community. She was taken 
from us far too soon, on December 3, 
2020, at the age of 28. 
Cassie was the daughter of an iron-
worker. She shared her mother’s steely 
resolve and iron constitution. 
Being a police officer in the city she 
loved and grew up in was a dream come 
true for Cassie. She was sworn in by 
Mayor Amy Goodwin in January 2019 
and had previously worked as a city 
humane officer. 
Cassie was born and raised in our 
State’s capital. She could have gone 
anywhere, and she chose to stay and 
protect and serve the community that 
made her who she was. 
She was truly a beautiful person in 
every way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7267 
December 8, 2020 
Growing up, Cassie was an athlete 
and particularly loved softball. She 
would one day find that the Little 
League field she played on as a child 
was on her beat. So she watched over it 
with great care so the current genera-
tion of children could play in safety. 
One of the first things she did when 
she was assigned to the field was to 
clean up the drug paraphernalia to 
make the field a safe place for kids. Be-
cause of her efforts, children and their 
families have been able to enjoy the 
field as a clean, safe, fun place to play. 
Cassie was an animal lover and dedi-
cated her life to rescuing pets who had 
been cast aside, even taking an animal 
behavior class in Tennessee so she 
could better understand the language 
of dogs. 
Cassie’s beloved dog Emma was a 
chocolate lab who passed away a few 
months ago. Cassie grieved deeply for 
Emma because she had a special con-
nection with her. 
Years ago, when Cassie was in high 
school, Emma had nine chocolate lab 
pups in Cassie’s bedroom. Her mom 
tells the story of taking the runt of the 
litter with her to pick up Cassie at 
school. When they got home, there 
were chocolate lab pups running every-
where. This was just one of the many 
adventures Cassie had with Emma. No 
doubt, they are reunited again. 
Cassie was a music lover, most likely 
because her mother sang her to sleep as 
a child. She was surrounded by instru-
ments and music throughout her life. 
She loved to make the world beautiful, 
and that is also why she enjoyed deco-
rating for the holidays. 
The weekend before she passed, she 
decorated 
her 
mother’s 
house 
for 
Christmas, alongside her dear sister 
Chelsea. One of the last actions she 
took the day of her passing was to wipe 
the snow from those holiday decora-
tions because she always looked out for 
her mother any way that she could. 
Most importantly, Cassie was a genu-
inely good person, and she lived her 
whole life with West Virginia values. 
She worked hard and bought her own 
home at the age of 25. She was beloved 
in the community and in her profes-
sion, as evidenced in the tremendous 
outpouring of grief. The support and 
fellowship that followed her tragic 
passing has been unbelievable. 
Her mother describes her as respect-
ful and well-mannered throughout her 
whole life. 
Cassie will be deeply be missed, not 
only because of who she was but be-
cause we are all so keenly aware of and 
sorrowful for what might have been. 
No one can take away what Cassie 
represented to the Charleston commu-
nity and the entire Mountain State. 
Every one of our female leaders in West 
Virginia is an epitome of strength and 
advancement in their fields and serve 
as inspiring role models for the next 
generation. That is due in great part to 
the women who broke ground in gen-
erations past. Because of their accom-
plishments, young women like Cassie 
have and will blaze their own trails and 
continue to make our State and entire 
Nation proud. 
I have such tremendous respect for 
our police officers and all of our first 
responders. Cassie’s compassion, cour-
age, and selflessness will live on 
through the memories of those who 
knew and loved her, as well as through 
the countless lives she touched and in-
spired every day. 
She leaves us having made a pro-
found impact in the community that 
she loved, as well as in the lives of 
those around her. 
I had the tremendous and humbling 
honor of visiting with Cassie’s family 
at her bedside in her final hours. It is 
clear to me that Cassie came from 
strong roots and that her life was filled 
with joy and love. She was a beloved 
daughter and sister and a loyal friend, 
who adored her three dogs and all ani-
mals. 
Cassie was an organ donor. Her final 
act of selflessness has given someone 
else a chance. 
The Charleston Police Department 
has retired Cassie’s unit number, 146. 
I know I join the entire Mountain 
State in mourning our shared loss of 
this bright, generous, and vibrant spir-
it. 
Gayle and I extend our deepest con-
dolences to Cassie’s mother Sheryl, sis-
ter Chelsea, brother Terry, and all of 
her family and friends, her colleagues 
with the Charleston Police Depart-
ment, as well as the city of Charleston, 
and will forever keep them in our pray-
ers. 
May God watch over Cassie. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
when you are new to the U.S. Senate, it 
is not unusual for friends and people 
back home, after you have been there a 
while, to say: So who are the good guys 
and who are the bad guys in the Sen-
ate? Who are the ones you really like 
and what can you tell us about the rest 
of them? 
It is a common question that is 
asked, and I do remember, as a new 
Senator here, reflecting on that ques-
tion and saying: You know, if I had an 
important decision to make in the Sen-
ate, whatever the issue might be, there 
are two Senators whom I always want 
to sit down and get their advice. One 
was Carl Levin of Michigan—one of the 
most thoughtful, smart guys I had a 
chance to serve with, and the other was 
Paul Sarbanes. He just always struck 
me as a man of substance, who took 
questions seriously. He was respected 
in the U.S. Senate for his service, of 
course, to Maryland, and he was just a 
good person. He brought real integrity 
to the U.S. Senate. 
So when I learned that he passed 
away just a few days ago, I wanted to 
put a few things in the RECORD. 
He was a man of towering intellect 
and integrity, but he was modest. He 
didn’t care about headlines. He did so 
much good work behind the scenes. He 
was given some of the toughest assign-
ments. 
Think about the responsibility of 
dealing with the great recession and 
then working with Republican Con-
gressman Oxley to put together a real-
ly significant reform of Wall Street 
and the financial community. We knew 
we could trust Paul Sarbanes to do it, 
and he did it in a bipartisan fashion. 
He was a proud son of immigrants. 
He never forgot it. His parents emi-
grated from the same town in Greece 
but only met in America. 
The Sarbanes owned a famous res-
taurant in Salisbury, MD, and gave it 
the quintessentially American name— 
the 
Mayflower 
Restaurant. 
Paul 
worked in the restaurant as a boy, and 
he and his family lived above the res-
taurant. 
He 
graduated 
from 
public 
high 
school, won a scholarship to Princeton 
University, studied as a Rhodes scholar 
at Oxford University, and in 1960 
earned a law degree from Harvard. Not 
bad for an immigrant’s son. 
From Harvard, Paul went to the 
White House, where he was one of the 
best and brightest who answered Presi-
dent John Kennedy’s call to public 
service. There, he worked as an admin-
istrative assistant to Walter Heller, 
who was Chairman of President Ken-
nedy’s Council of Economic Advisers. 
Paul Sarbanes’ parents taught him 
that serving one’s nation in public 
service was a noble calling. 
One of the many Greek words Paul 
Sarbanes learned from his parents was 
the word ‘‘idiotes.’’ It is the Greek root 
word for the English word ‘‘idiot,’’ but 
it has a different meaning in Greek. It 
means someone who takes no part in 
the affairs of his community. In the 
Sarbanes family, that was almost a 
curse. 
Paul and his parents believed that 
service to others and to their adopted 
homeland was a noble calling. So Paul 
first ran for elective office. In 1966, he 
was elected to the Maryland House of 
Delegates. 
In 1970, the people of Maryland elect-
ed him to the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. He was a young Congressman 
when he wrote one of the successful Ar-
ticles of Impeachment against then- 
President Nixon for lying about his 
Watergate burglary. 
In 1976, he won his first election to 
the U.S. Senate. He would go on to 
serve 30 years in the Chamber. He was 
a voice of reason on both the Senate 
Iran-Contra and Whitewater commit-
tees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7268 
December 8, 2020 
When corporate swindling at Enron 
and other large corporations cheated 
millions of Americans out of their life 
savings, it was Paul Sarbanes’ leader-
ship that enabled the Senate to pass 
the most far-reaching corporate ac-
countability reform since the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission was cre-
ated 70 years before. 
That 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
reform 
law 
passed in 2002. It was designed to pre-
vent the kind of corporate abuses that 
had so damaged America’s economy 
and shaken the faith of the American 
people in the economic markets. 
In 2002, things came full circle for 
me. There was created an award in the 
name of Senator Paul Douglas of Illi-
nois—a man whom I first met as a col-
lege intern who inspired me to get 
started in this business. Paul Sarbanes 
won in 2002 and became the first recipi-
ent of the Senator Paul Douglas Ethics 
in Government Award that is presented 
by the University of Illinois to honor 
men and women in public service who 
exhibit the finest qualities of leader-
ship. It was a perfect match, and, for 
me, it came full circle. 
What a coincidence it is that the peo-
ple who have been my heroes in public 
life so far, so many are named Paul: 
Paul Douglas, who had started me as 
an intern, who introduced me to Paul 
Simon, who preceded me in the U.S. 
Senate, where I served with Paul Sar-
banes. 
They basically say in my office that 
I have been raised according to the 
Gospel of ‘‘Saints’’ Paul. 
I want to quote briefly from Senator 
Sarbanes’ final speech in the Senate 
before he retired in 2006. It speaks pow-
erfully to the kind of leaders America 
is looking for today. 
Here is what Paul Sarbanes said: 
Throughout my years in public service, I 
have worked to the limits of my ability to 
provide the people of Maryland and the Na-
tion dedicated, informed, and independent 
representation based upon the fundamental 
principles of integrity and intelligence. I 
have been guided in this effort by a vision of 
a decent and just America, based on a strong 
sense of community and offering fairness and 
opportunity to all its people. 
I know I join all my colleagues in 
thanking Paul for doing his part so 
nobly and so well to help us move to-
ward a more perfect Union. 
And let me say a word about his wife 
Christine. She was his real partner in 
life. I can recall when he retired, and I 
said: Paul, I am sorry to see you go. 
And he said: Let me ask you a ques-
tion. When are you supposed to leave 
around here? It is a question many of 
us have asked ourselves over and over. 
As far as he was concerned, I said: 
What do you want to do the most? He 
said: Travel with Christine. 
They were able to do that for a lim-
ited period of time because Christine 
died of cancer in 2009. She was a won-
derful person—intelligent, just like 
Paul—and the two of them were pure 
happiness together. 
Loretta and I wish to express our 
condolences to the Sarbanes family, es-
pecially to their children—Michael, 
Janet, and a man I have come to know 
and respect, his son, Congressman JOHN 
SARBANES, as well as their grand-
children, his friends and former staff 
members, and the countless people 
whose lives are better because of Paul 
Sarbanes. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ARMS SALE RESOLUTION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last 4 years, we have seen a series 
of encouraging developments in the 
Middle East—a place where there isn’t 
a long trend line of positive develop-
ments. 
We have destroyed the ISIS caliph-
ate. We have brought down dangerous 
terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and, 
of course, the head of the IRGC, 
Soleimani, who was personally respon-
sible for American blood on his hands, 
particularly providing explosives that 
penetrated our armor in Iraq. 
Through congressional action and 
the work of the Trump administration, 
we strengthened bilateral ties with our 
closest friends and allies, including 
Israel and Jordan. This summer, the 
administration helped forge historic 
peace deals between Israel and Arab 
nations in the region. The United Arab 
Emirates became the third Arab coun-
try and first Gulf State to recognize 
and normalize relations with Israel by 
the signing of the Abraham Accords 
Peace Agreement. It was only a matter 
of days until Bahrain followed suit and 
announced its agreement with Israel to 
open formal diplomatic negotiations. 
These historic breakthroughs rep-
resent serious progress in our efforts to 
fight terrorism and establish lasting 
peace and stability in the Middle East. 
While more work obviously remains, it 
is great to see the mounting pressure 
against Iran—the region’s greatest an-
tagonist and largest state sponsor of 
terrorism. 
Last month, the Trump administra-
tion announced that it intended to sell 
arms to our friends in the United Arab 
Emirates—a move that I support. This 
will help the UAE work with the 
United States and our friends to deter 
and defend these threats from Iran and 
other hostilities in the region. What it 
seems 
to 
me 
is 
that 
it 
focused 
everybody’s attention on the recogni-
tion that Iran represents the single 
biggest destabilizing and dangerous in-
fluence in the Middle East today, and 
it is the recognition that they are the 
common adversary of not only the 
Arab nations in the region but also the 
United States and our ally Israel that 
has, I think, brought them to the nego-
tiating table. 
As Iran grows increasingly bellig-
erent toward the United States and our 
allies, these military assets that we 
will sell to our friends in the UAE will 
serve as a stabilizing force, a force 
multiplier, and a source of protection 
for the United States and our security 
interests. We have learned a hard les-
son that American boots on the ground 
is something we want to do as a last re-
sort. But if we can work by, with, and 
through our friends and allies to pro-
vide that security and stability against 
a common enemy, we should do it. 
The arms sale will allow greater 
military 
cooperation 
between 
the 
United States, the UAE, and Israel and 
strengthen 
a 
growing 
coalition 
of 
aligned forces in the region. It will also 
make sure the United States remains 
the partner of choice. 
It is not as if the United States is the 
only one that has a say. Obviously, if 
we don’t provide them the military 
equipment they need, they will go 
looking for other sellers, and that 
would certainly be less desirable for us 
and for them because we are their part-
ner of choice in the region. Russia and 
particularly China have sought to in-
crease their malign influence in the 
Middle East, and they would be more 
than happy to fill the void left by any 
refusal on the part of the United States 
to make this sale. So blocking this sale 
would only strengthen the position of 
China and Russia, while significantly 
weakening our own. 
As we continue to make progress in 
the decades-long quest for peace and 
stability in the Middle East, I support 
the administration’s strategic decision 
to sell arms to the UAE. This would 
provide the UAE with critical national 
security assets, such as access to the 
F–35 
fifth-generation 
fighter, 
un-
manned aerial vehicles, and other ad-
vanced munitions to act as a deterrent, 
and if worse comes to worse, it actu-
ally gives them a comparative advan-
tage with other countries in the region. 
The Israeli Ambassador to the United 
States, Ron Dermer, perhaps summed 
it up best when he said: 
What keeps me up at night is actually not 
the proposed F–35 sale to the Emirates. What 
keeps me up at night is the idea that some-
body would return to the nuclear deal with 
Iran. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, on 
another matter, this week, I hope we 
are able to make more progress on the 
coronavirus relief negotiations so we 
can pass another bill before recessing 
for the holidays. There are a lot of peo-
ple in this country, all throughout the 
country, who are hurting, who are anx-
ious, and who are worried about their 
ability to pay the rent and to meet 
their other obligations in the face of 
this pandemic, and I think it would be 
a dereliction of duty on our part to 
leave here without addressing those 
real needs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7269 
December 8, 2020 
Earlier this year, we worked in a 
quick, bipartisan fashion to pass relief 
bills totaling more than $3 trillion. 
Thinking back on it, it was pretty re-
markable to do as much as we did as 
fast as we did, but we knew we were up 
against a common enemy in this virus, 
and we knew we had to respond quick-
ly, and we did. The funding we provided 
has gone a long way to support our 
healthcare and economic response, but 
as our war against COVID–19 continues 
to rage on, additional support is need-
ed, and it is needed now. 
The good news is, as earlier, there 
are a number of areas that we agree on 
what the support should look like, in-
cluding funding for schools, assistance 
for the hardest hit workers and small 
businesses, and another investment in 
the distribution of the vaccine that 
can’t come soon enough, but we remain 
hung up on a couple of important 
points, including liability protection 
for businesses, schools, nonprofits, and 
others who in good faith did their best 
to follow guidance from the CDC and 
other public health authorities but now 
face the prospect of litigation. 
It is pretty hard to follow the guid-
ance as knowledge of this virus has 
evolved. I remember before April, the 
head of the CDC, including Dr. Fauci 
and others, said that masks were use-
less. Then they changed their guidance 
in April. That is fine. I respect that 
based on what we have learned about 
the virus. But we simply can’t expose 
people who have tried their best to 
muddle along in the face of this pan-
demic, following the guidance from 
public health officials, and say: You 
didn’t know then what we know now, 
so you must have been negligent, and 
you need to pay compensation in the 
form of litigation. 
Well, I don’t think that is fair to 
those entities, those individuals, those 
businesses, 
those 
schools, 
those 
churches, mosques, and synagogues. 
But this is something that is on the 
minds 
of 
a 
lot 
of 
people, 
from 
healthcare workers, to teachers, to 
nonprofits, to small business owners. 
Those who continue to provide essen-
tial services and goods didn’t have any 
choice but to show up and go to work. 
Now they are worried that by opening 
their doors to people who really needed 
their help at the time, they have also 
now opened themselves up to an end-
less parade of lawsuits by the trial bar. 
We all know that lawyers can be very 
creative and opportunistic. That is 
part of what lawyering involves. But 
the litigation we expect against doc-
tors, nurses, colleges, churches, small 
businesses—anyone and everyone could 
be blamed for another person’s harm. If 
those lawsuits are feasible, they will 
follow. And the statute of limitations 
is a couple years, so even though we 
are not necessarily seeing it now, we do 
know that class action litigation could 
be filed in any favorable jurisdiction 
anywhere in the country and basically 
bankrupt many businesses and cer-
tainly discourage businesses from safe-
ly reopening and following those guide-
lines. 
I think there is another reason to re-
ward people who have tried their best 
to follow those guidelines—because it 
ensures more compliance. To now play 
a game of ‘‘gotcha’’ with them and say: 
It wasn’t good enough, so now you are 
going to have to pay or maybe even 
just defend a lawsuit that you ulti-
mately will win—we all know that will 
cost a lot of money and will take a lot 
of time, and I would prefer to see them 
rebuild their businesses and restore the 
jobs that were lost as a result of the 
pandemic. 
So because of my concern about the 
need for some liability shield, we intro-
duced a bill called the SAFE TO WORK 
Act that provides commonsense protec-
tions for those who acted in good faith 
to keep their customers and their em-
ployees safe, while still preserving the 
right to sue for those who were victims 
of gross negligence or intentional mis-
conduct. 
This is not a blanket liability shield 
that won’t permit the really truly bad 
actors from facing due consequences. It 
won’t ban coronavirus lawsuits, and it 
won’t give anyone a get-out-of-jail-free 
card. So we need to get that straight 
up front. In cases of gross negligence or 
willful misconduct, where the applica-
ble public health guidelines were not 
followed, the person affected has every 
right to sue and be made whole in a 
court of law. No one is asking to 
change that. What we do need, though, 
is to put safeguards in place to ensure 
that those who operated in good faith 
and were following all the relevant 
guidelines, even as they evolved over 
time, cannot be sued out of existence. 
First and foremost are protections 
for our incredible healthcare heroes 
who made tremendous physical and 
mental sacrifices over the last several 
months. This legislation sets a willful 
misconduct or gross negligence stand-
ard for coronavirus-related medical li-
ability suits to ensure that only legiti-
mate cases are brought against our 
healthcare workers who, again, didn’t 
have any choice but to show up for 
work. 
In 
addition 
to 
protecting 
our 
healthcare heroes, we need to ensure 
that a fear of lawsuits doesn’t prevent 
schools, nonprofits, churches, small 
businesses, and a range of other organi-
zations and institutions that are vital 
to our communities and our economy 
from opening their doors. This spells 
out in black and white that these enti-
ties will be protected from COVID–19 
exposure claims as long as they comply 
with mandatory public health guide-
lines. 
It is true that a number of States 
have already provided similar protec-
tions, including the minority leader’s 
home State of New York, and it is time 
that we extend these liability limita-
tions to the rest of the country, par-
ticularly States like mine where the 
legislature does not meet on a con-
tinual basis. They haven’t even been in 
session during 2020. They will go into 
session in January, and I presume they 
will try to fill in any holes they feel 
like we left when it comes to liability 
protection. But without a uniform Fed-
eral standard, we are going to end up in 
a dangerous venue shopping situation, 
and it is only to be expected that the 
lawyers will find the place most favor-
able for their lawsuits. They will seek 
to pursue those claims using class ac-
tion procedures, and we will be right 
back at the worst nightmare that I 
think many folks would have con-
templated unless we provide for this 
Federal liability shield. 
The goal is not to protect bad actors. 
What we do need to clearly spell out is 
for the schools, colleges, nonprofits, 
churches, and businesses that are ask-
ing us to provide them some guidance 
and some security. 
Our Democratic colleagues have not 
expressed a lot of enthusiasm for this 
legislation, and my Republican col-
leagues and I have tried to work with 
them to reach a result that both sides 
can support. But the nature of com-
promise, as we all know, is give-and- 
take, but so far it has been pretty 
much 
one-sided. 
We 
have 
offered 
changes to appease our Democratic col-
leagues’ concerns while still preserving 
the basic goal of the legislation, but 
the truth is, they really haven’t moved 
much in any meaningful way. 
I think the truth is that our coun-
try’s 
long-term 
economic 
recovery 
from this virus depends on these liabil-
ity protections in large part. Busi-
nesses doing the best they can during a 
worldwide emergency should not face 
bankruptcy because of concerns about 
the trial bar. I mean, who are we here 
working for—the American people or 
for lawyers who—and this isn’t nec-
essarily designed to be a criticism— 
who are looking out for their own eco-
nomic interests first and foremost? Our 
view must be much broader than that, 
and the greatest good for the greatest 
number I think should be our guiding 
principle. 
Our essential workers and institu-
tions need to know that if they have 
been operating in good faith and obey-
ing the guidelines that have been pro-
mulgated by the public health authori-
ties, they won’t be subjected to litiga-
tion, and only Congress can provide 
that certainty. 
Now, this is not a permanent Federal 
takeover of State tort law by any 
means. It really is comparable to what 
we did after Y2K—or in the run up to 
Y2K—and also with other national

emergencies like 9/11. We have even 
given some protection to pharma-
ceutical companies, which we have 
asked to take risks to come up with 
world-class vaccines and therapies, to 
encourage them and to incentivize 
them to do that because we know it is 
in the public interest. 
But across the country, we are al-
ready seeing these lawsuits rolling in, 
and without action from Congress, we 
are going to emerge from this pan-
demic only to find ourselves in not an-
other wave of the virus but in a second 
wave of litigation that will be dev-
astating for many. 
In order for our country and our 
economy to recover, these workers and 
these institutions need to know that 
they can follow the guidelines and then 
safely reopen their doors and do their 
jobs with confidence. They need to 
know that if they follow these guide-
lines and act in good faith, they won’t 
be subjected to perhaps business-ending 
litigation that could tie them up in 
court and drain their remaining re-
sources dry. 
As I have said, the way we reach 
agreements around here is through bi-
partisan negotiations. It took a little 
compromise, and neither side achieved 
100 percent of what they wanted, but 
we eventually have gotten there. We 
have done that four times in the 
coronavirus response, and I hope we 
can do it again here. 
I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will approach these negotiations with 
the gravity they deserve. We can’t 
leave people waiting and wondering 
what their future looks like any longer 
if there is something we can do to pro-
vide them some safety and security and 
some confidence about what the future 
may look like. 
I hope we will all work together to 
deliver these critical liability protec-
tions for folks across the country in all 
50 States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF 
FORMER 
UNITED STATES SENATOR PAUL 
SPYROS SARBANES 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time, along with my col-
league from Maryland, Senator CHRIS 
VAN HOLLEN—and I am also pleased 
that we are joined by Senator STABE-
NOW and Senator REED. We take this 
time, on a very sad note, to announce 
the death of Paul Spyros Sarbanes, our 
former colleague in the U.S. Senate, 
who passed away on December 6, 2020, 
at the age of 87. 
I first got to know Senator Sarbanes 
when he first ran for public office in 
1966. We both were elected to the Mary-
land General Assembly that year, and 
we became good friends. Delegate Sar-
banes at that point made a name for 
himself on the House Judiciary Com-
mittee in the Maryland General Assem-
bly and was a rising star from his first 
day in the Maryland General Assembly. 
He shortly thereafter ran for the 
House of Representatives. He served 
three terms in the House of Represent-
atives with a very distinguished career. 
During that time, it was the time of 
the Watergate issues, and Congressman 
SARBANES was on the Judiciary Com-
mittee and was given the responsibility 
of the first Article of Impeachment 
against President Nixon. That article 
dealt with obstruction of justice. It 
was the key engagement against Presi-
dent Nixon on impeachment, and it is 
very telling that that responsibility 
was given to a young Member of the 
House of Representatives, Congressman 
Paul Sarbanes. It was because of his 
work ethic, his commitment to schol-
arship, and his understanding of issues 
that he was entrusted with that re-
sponsibility. 
He then served five terms in the U.S. 
Senate, the longest term for any Sen-
ator in Maryland. Paul Sarbanes was 
known as a Senator’s Senator for his 
integrity, for his public commitment 
to public service, and his strong com-
mitment 
to 
principles. 
He 
was 
a 
Rhodes scholar who chose to serve the 
public rather than using his skills in 
the private sector for his own personal 
gain. His entire life was devoted to 
public service. What a legacy he has 
left us by his incredible public service. 
In 2002, the Enron scandal hit Amer-
ica, and Chairman Sarbanes, the chair-
man of the Banking Committee here, 
teamed up with Chairman Oxley in the 
House to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley legis-
lation. 
George 
W. 
Bush—President 
Bush—said it was ‘‘the most far-reach-
ing reforms of American business prac-
tices since the time of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt.’’ The leadership of Senator 
Sarbanes was deeply needed at that 
time, and he delivered on behalf of the 
American people. 
Senator VAN
HOLLEN
and I know 
firsthand what Senator Sarbanes did in 
helping to create the Federal partner-
ship in the Chesapeake Bay Program. 
It was during the time that he was the 
junior Senator from Maryland, along 
with Senator Mathias, that the two of 
them partnered in order to develop the 
Federal program for the Chesapeake 
Bay, and then Senator Sarbanes car-
ried the burden of that partnership. 
For many years, it was through his ef-
forts in the U.S. Senate that we were 
able to continue and expand the Fed-
eral partnership for the bay. 
Now, those of us who live in the bay 
region—and I know that Senator STA-
BENOW has heard me talk about this 
many times when we talk about the 
great water bodies. We know that the 
Chesapeake is the largest estuary in 
our hemisphere. It is the most diverse 
estuary, and it is a challenge because 
of the way that the water flows and it 
cleanses itself. So we started this Fed-
eral 
partnership—Senator 
Sarbanes 
did—and it has provided incredible 
dividends for the people of Maryland 
and the people of our Nation—indeed, 
the global community. 
He was an expert on foreign policy. 
He served on the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. He was involved in 
the leadership of passing ratification of 
the Panama Canal Treaty, and there 
are so many other areas in which Sen-
ator Sarbanes excelled. 
We all receive honors; I know that. I 
am just going to mention three because 
they were really reflective of what Sen-
ator Sarbanes accomplished during his 
career. He got the Paul H. Douglas 
Ethics in Government Award for his in-
credible standard of integrity and eth-
ics; the Roth Award for extraordinary 
impact on policy, on economic busi-
ness, and finance—his lasting legacy on 
the 
financial 
institutions 
here 
in 
America; and the Cox, Richardson, 
Coleman Award for distinguished pub-
lic service. He was a Senator’s Senator. 
He devoted his life to public service. 
In a way, Paul Sarbanes represents 
the American success story. He was a 
son of Greek immigrants, grew up on 
the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 
Salisbury, and rose to serve in the U.S. 
Senate. 
His lifetime partner was Christine. 
All of us remember Paul and Christine 
together. What a couple they made. 
What a love story it was. 
There are three children. JOHN, whom 
we all know very well because he 
serves in the House of Representatives, 
holds the seat in the Third Congres-
sional District. It is the same seat that 
Barbara Mikulski held, the same seat 
that I held; the same seat that Paul 
Sarbanes held is now being held by 
Paul’s son JOHN, and what a great job 
he is doing. It is interesting that he 
was the leading sponsor of H.R. 1 in 
this Congress, which was basically the 
good 
governance 
legislation 
that 
passed overwhelmingly in the House, 
and so many other things that follow 
in his father’s tradition. 
Paul’s other son Michael has had a 
distinguished career, and Janet, his 
daughter, has also had a distinguished 
career. 
Paul had seven grandchildren. Chris-
tine predeceased Paul. 
I want to just talk a moment about 
the partnership between Senator Sar-
banes and Senator Mikulski. They had 
different styles. I think most people 
would acknowledge that from the be-
ginning, Paul was very much stately 
and 
represented 
the 
traditional, 
I 
guess, demeanor that you would expect 
of a U.S. Senator. And I love Barbara 
Mikulski, but no one would ever accuse 
her of having that type of demeanor. 
But the two of them had an incredible 
relationship together. They were called 
the ‘‘Diner Democrats’’ because Paul’s 
father’s family ran a diner, and Bar-
bara Mikulski’s family ran Mikulski’s 
Bakery, as we all know. They worked 
together in true partnership over so 
many years. It was a friendship that 
was really one of total trust and re-
spect. 
I had a chance to communicate with 
Senator Mikulski, and she, because of 
COVID, could not join us tonight. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that her statement be printed 
in the RECORD of these proceedings.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7271 
December 8, 2020 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MIKULSKI STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF 
SENATOR PAUL S. SARBANES 
BALTIMORE.—Retired U.S. Senator Barbara 
A. Mikulski (D–MD) today issues the fol-
lowing statement remembering Senator Paul 
Sarbanes: 
‘‘We join Maryland and all of America in 
mourning the loss of Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
We extend our condolences and sympathies 
to his family and loved ones during this 
time. 
America has lost a great statesman, the 
state of Maryland has lost a champion, and 
I, along with so many others, have lost a 
friend. 
The Maryland Delegation calls itself Team 
Maryland, and we became a team because of 
Senator Sarbanes’s work in reaching hands 
across the aisle to Senator Mac Mathias. 
Senator Sarbanes knew that each of us could 
make a difference but working together was 
how we would make change. His legacy of 
bringing Marylanders together to make 
change lives on in the Delegation today. 
Senator Sarbanes never forgot his family’s 
strong immigrant roots or their belief in the 
American 
Dream. 
He 
knew 
the 
trans-
formational power of education and cham-
pioned an opportunity ladder and increased 
access to higher education. An unabashed be-
liever in America’s promise, he became a 
voice for civil rights and voting rights. And 
in his advocacy on housing, he worked to 
eliminate barriers of discrimination. He 
championed the stabilization of the Social 
Security and Medicare trust funds and 
worked tirelessly to protect and preserve the 
Chesapeake Bay for tomorrow while advo-
cating for jobs on the Port of Baltimore 
today. 
Senator Sarbanes believed that discussion 
and debate should always be based on civil-
ity, intellectual rigor, and respect for others. 
He was a workhorse, not a show horse, who 
cared more about the getting job done and 
getting it done right, than in taking credit. 
We served together in Congress for 30 
years, 20 of them together in the Senate. And 
just as he was Maryland’s champion, he was 
my champion, too. As well as my ally and 
friend. We joked that we were ‘‘diner demo-
crats,’’ not ‘‘dynasty democrats.’’ He was the 
son of a diner owner, and I was the daughter 
of a grocer. We were both raised to ask how 
we could help those around us every day. 
Senator Sarbanes took that lesson to heart; 
it was his commitment to helping not only 
the people of Maryland, but every American 
that drove him. And each of us is better off 
for having been helped by him. 
He was always there when you needed him. 
He will be missed.’’ 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let 
me conclude by just quoting from Sen-
ator Sarbanes himself on the final 
speech that he gave when he left the 
Senate. He said: 
Throughout my years in public service, I 
have worked to the limits of my ability to 
provide the people of Maryland and the Na-
tion dedicated, informed, and independent 
representation based on the fundamental 
principles of integrity and intelligence. I 
have been guided in this effort by the vision 
of a decent and just America, based on a 
strong sense of community and offering fair-
ness and opportunity to all its people. 
Service in this body has reinforced, many 
times over, my understanding and commit-
ment to the institutions upon which our sys-
tem of Democratic governance critically de-
pends. 
So long as [that] vision of America’s prom-
ise continues to shine brightly in this body, 
I have every confidence that our Nation will 
prevail in the face of great challenges and 
that its future will be assured. 
It is our responsibility to heed those 
words of Senator Sarbanes and strive 
to carry out his legacy. 
Before I yield to Senator VAN HOL-
LEN, the two of us, on behalf of all of 
the Members of the U.S. Senate, have 
filed a resolution to honor Paul Sar-
banes. This has been cleared. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 797, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 797) honoring the life 
and achievements of former United States 
Senator Paul Spyros Sarbanes and express-
ing condolences to the family of Paul Spyros 
Sarbanes on his passing. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be agreed to; 
that the preamble be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 797) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions’’.) 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
now yield the floor in anticipation that 
my colleague from Maryland—the two 
of us have joined together to pay trib-
ute to Senator Sarbanes—be recog-
nized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to start by thanking my 
friend and colleague, the senior Sen-
ator 
from 
Maryland, 
Senator 
BEN 
CARDIN, for his remembrance of Paul 
Sarbanes. I am honored to join him and 
others in offering a resolution in mem-
ory of Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
I should say that Senator Sarbanes 
was very pleased that BEN CARDIN suc-
ceeded him in his seat here in the U.S. 
Senate. So I am honored to join with 
him, Senator STABENOW, Senator REED, 
Senator DURBIN, and others in remem-
bering somebody who was a friend, who 
was a mentor, and who was the excel-
lent role model for every elected offi-
cial—Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
He was a thoughtful and brilliant 
Senator, a kind man, and a dedicated 
public servant. As we have heard, he 
was born on Maryland’s Eastern Shore 
to parents who emigrated from Greece. 
He graduated from the local public 
high school, Wicomico High School, 
and was recruited to attend Princeton 
on a full scholarship. He excelled in his 
studies as he would in his career, be-
coming a Rhodes scholar and grad-
uating from Oxford before attending 
Harvard Law School. 
He went on to a very distinguished 
career in public service that ended here 
in the U.S. Senate, but he never ever 
forgot his humble roots in Salisbury, 
where his parents owned a small res-
taurant they called the Mayflower. 
In his farewell speech in the Senate, 
Senator Paul Sarbanes said: 
My parents came to this country as immi-
grants from Greece, both my mother and 
[my] father, and it was from them that I 
first learned about the meaning of a demo-
cratic society and the potential it offers to 
move up the ladder of opportunity on the 
basis of ability, hard work, and conviction. 
Their memory is still a very powerful influ-
ence in my life. 
As we heard from Senator CARDIN, 
Senator Barbara Mikulski, who served 
here so well, was his friend and part-
ner, and for years she always joked 
that they were the ‘‘Diner Democrats,’’ 
a nod to the Mayflower restaurant, 
owned by Paul Sarbanes’s father, her 
roots in the Polish-American commu-
nity in Baltimore, and their mutual 
commitment to fighting for working 
people, for the dignity of work, for the 
reality of the struggles so many Ameri-
cans face, and the need to give every 
American a fair shot. 
Paul Sarbanes carried the values he 
learned from his parents on Maryland’s 
Eastern Shore, first to the Maryland 
House of Delegates, then to the House 
of Representatives, and later here to 
the U.S. Senate. 
From the very start, he developed a 
reputation 
for 
thoughtfulness 
and 
honor. He could make simple and con-
fident arguments, based on evidence, to 
win others to his cause—Members from 
both parties. 
He was in his first term in the House 
of Representatives during the Water-
gate hearings, and he approached the 
proceedings on the Judiciary Com-
mittee with his signature seriousness 
of purpose. He considered the evidence, 
he listened to President Nixon’s coun-
sel’s statements, and methodically ad-
dressed and responded to their argu-
ments. Because of his own unimpeach-
able conduct, the chairman of the 
House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
called 
upon him, a new member, and asked 
him to introduce the first article of im-
peachment against President Nixon— 
the charge of obstruction of justice. 
Paul Sarbanes had the legal acumen to 
take on that responsibility, but he also 
had the integrity to be a moral voice in 
the Congress at that moment for the 
country. 
Writing about his dignified work dur-
ing the Watergate proceedings, jour-
nalist 
Elizabeth 
Drew 
commented: 
‘‘Paul Sarbanes would not have looked 
at all bad at the Constitutional Con-
vention; he might have [even] been one 
of the great ones.’’ 
After three terms in the House, Paul 
Sarbanes ran for the Senate. I first met 
Senator Sarbanes in the 1980s, when I 
was serving as a staff member on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
I know everybody who served with 
Paul Sarbanes will understand what a 
master class it was to watch him dur-
ing a hearing. On cross-examination,

he asked thoughtful, probing questions, 
and before a reluctant witness realized 
what was happening, he had them cor-
nered with no way out but to concede 
to the point that he wanted to make or 
look deliberately evasive. Woe be it to 
any witness who came before Senator 
Sarbanes unprepared. 
He was a Senate workhorse in the 
truest and best sense. Former Majority 
Leader George Mitchell once said: 
‘‘Paul was effective because he didn’t 
seek credit, which endeared him to his 
colleagues.’’ 
He wasn’t afraid to take his time to 
get to the bottom of an issue, build his 
case, and convince his colleagues. In 
the wake of the Enron scandal, he held 
10 hearings to ensure that the congres-
sional response would be thorough and 
effective and rallied the entire Senate 
to support the ensuing Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, the law that is credited with re-
storing greater investor confidence in 
the market and providing transparency 
and oversight for corporate govern-
ance. 
He loved the State of Maryland, and 
especially the Chesapeake Bay. As Sen-
ator CARDIN indicated, he took on the 
mantle of forging and strengthening 
the Federal partnership to clean up his 
beloved Chesapeake Bay. 
He wanted everybody to have a fair 
deal and worked to improve access to 
affordable housing and to protect con-
sumers from his seat on the Banking 
Committee. He believed in the United 
States as a force for good in the world 
and supported foreign assistance, the 
treaties to return control of the Pan-
ama Canal to Panama, and strongly 
supported legislation to impose sanc-
tions under the then-apartheid regime 
of South Africa. He opposed senseless 
and unnecessary wars. 
I came to the House of Representa-
tives in 2003, along with my friend and 
colleague from Baltimore, Congress-
man Dutch Ruppersberger. Senator 
Sarbanes was then the leader of our 
delegation. He welcomed us kindly, but 
as captain of Team Maryland, he char-
acteristically was eager to allow all 
Members, however new they were to 
the delegation, to play an important 
role. 
Not surprisingly, Senator Sarbanes 
was a favored son of the Greek-Amer-
ican community. He was a member of 
the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the 
Annunciation in Baltimore and held 
the highest lay office in the church. We 
shared strong bonds in the Greek- 
American community because, like 
Paul’s parents, my wife Katherine’s 
mother’s 
family 
immigrated 
from 
Greece. 
As a strong believer in promoting 
democratic values at home and abroad, 
Senator Sarbanes was proud of those 
Greek roots and spoke often of democ-
racy’s roots with the ancient Greeks. 
He used to speak to students about the 
importance of public service, telling 
them that in ancient Athens, people 
who lived only a private life, without 
view of the public good, were failing to 
live fully. 
Indeed, the power of democracy and 
its promise of opportunity was the 
driving force behind his governing phi-
losophy—to open the door to others, to 
keep your promises, and to achieve 
based on your merit, not on your con-
nections, money, or power. 
As extraordinary a public servant as 
he was, Paul Sarbanes was, above all, a 
family man. He was devoted to his wife 
Christine, whom he met at Oxford. Re-
calling their first encounter, Paul said: 
She came to a meeting of the American As-
sociation I headed. I forgot what was on the 
agenda. All I remember of that meeting was 
that was where I met Christine. 
She was brilliant and kind, an educa-
tor in Latin, Greek, French, and the 
classics, who matched Senator Sar-
banes’s intelligence and shared his love 
of service. They used to knock on doors 
together during his political cam-
paigns, and she was a sounding board 
throughout his career. They raised 
three children, including our friend, 
JOHN SARBANES, who now serves Mary-
land so well in the House of Represent-
atives. He was enormously proud of 
them and his seven grandchildren. 
I also extend my condolences today 
to Senator Sarbanes’s former staff. His 
legacy goes well beyond the laws he 
wrote to the way he worked. He shared 
with them: Do your homework, under-
stand the details, act with integrity, 
and hold firm to your values. It is an 
example for all of us to follow. 
Senator Sarbanes was not a flashy 
presence. In fact, political opponents 
once tried to belittle him with the 
name ‘‘the stealth Senator.’’ But as he 
joked, stealth ‘‘is one of the most im-
portant weapons in our military arse-
nal. . . . if you let somebody else take 
the credit, you can get the result.’’ 
That was Paul Sarbanes—enormous 
accomplishments, never taking the 
credit. His quiet confidence left an im-
pression on all who served with him. 
We have lost a great Senator. Amer-
ica has lost a great Senator, and many 
of us have lost a very good friend. But 
we should be comforted in the knowl-
edge that he achieved what we would 
all wish for ourselves: He served well, 
he made the world better for others, he 
treated all he knew with respect and 
earned their respect in return, and he 
leaves us with fond memories. 
May God grant those who loved him 
the strength to bear his loss, and may 
his memory be eternal. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise this evening with my colleagues 
from Maryland and with Senator REED 
from Rhode Island to pay tribute to 
someone whom I was lucky enough to 
have as a mentor when I first entered 
the Senate. And I want to associate 
myself with all of the wonderful words 
of my friends from Maryland. 
With any new job, there is a learning 
curve. There are certainly things that 
you don’t know and that you don’t 
even know enough to know you don’t 
know. That certainly is true in the 
Senate. 
In 2001, I was a former Member of the 
House who had just been elected to the 
Senate. It was an exciting time—a lot 
of new people to meet, rules to learn, 
and procedures to follow. One of my 
new assignments was the Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, 
where Senator Sarbanes served as the 
chairman. 
By that time, Senator Sarbanes was 
already an institution. As my col-
leagues have mentioned, he introduced 
the 
first 
article 
of 
impeachment 
against President Richard Nixon, as a 
junior Congressman. And as a freshman 
Senator in 1978, he was a forceful advo-
cate for treaties that gave control, 
among other things, of the Panama 
Canal to Panama. So it felt a little 
surreal to find myself at the table with 
a brilliant leader like Senator Paul 
Sarbanes. 
But he could not have been more gra-
cious and more generous with his time 
for me as a freshman Member. He was 
always willing to answer my questions. 
He was a wonderful mentor. We, of 
course, worked on banking issues to-
gether, including the crafting of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, where I was able, 
up close, to watch his legislative mas-
tery. 
We also worked on public transit pro-
visions in our transportation 
bill, 
which was very important for us in 
Michigan. 
We shared a passion for protecting 
our water. My colleagues have talked 
about the Chesapeake Bay. For me, it 
was the Great Lakes, and we often 
talked about the beauty of the lakes, 
as well as the bay. 
Senator 
Sarbanes 
gave 
his 
final 
speech on the Senate floor on this very 
day, 14 years ago. He was a humble 
man, and his remarks were quite brief. 
He closed, in part, with this: ‘‘I want 
my colleagues to know how deeply I 
appreciate their friendship and [their] 
counsel and how highly I value the 
privilege of having been their col-
league.’’ 
Today, I can say exactly the same 
words about Senator Paul Sarbanes. He 
was a statesman, and I was lucky 
enough to call him my friend. I value 
the privilege of having been his col-
league. 
I want to offer his family, including 
Congressman JOHN
SARBANES, all of 
Paul’s friends, and the entire State of 
Maryland my deepest condolences. We 
have lost an incredible leader and pub-
lic servant. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to join my colleagues from 
Maryland, Senator CARDIN and Senator 
VAN HOLLEN, and my colleague from 
Michigan, Senator STABENOW, to take a 
moment to recognize and remember 
my esteemed former colleague and dear 
friend, Senator Paul Sarbanes, who 
passed away last Sunday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7273 
December 8, 2020 
Paul Sarbanes spent 30 years in this 
Chamber doing what he knew was 
right. In that time, he built a legacy 
most could not achieve in two life-
times. 
Paul’s work on banking, the econ-
omy, housing, transportation, and so 
many other issues had a profound and 
significant impact on our country. But, 
more importantly, his work had a di-
rect impact on so many families whose 
lives were made better because of his 
unsung efforts over three decades. 
I had the distinct honor of serving 
with Senator Sarbanes and working di-
rectly with him on the Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee and 
the Joint Economic Committee. 
Senator Sarbanes was a constant and 
steady champion of commonsense fis-
cal policies to help create jobs, expand 
our economy, and increase consumer 
and investor protections. Indeed, he 
used his power and influence to help 
those with the least power and influ-
ence in our society, which is a hall-
mark of our finest public servants. And 
Paul still remains one of our finest 
public servants—indeed, one of the fin-
est of the finest. 
Many would agree that the Sarbanes- 
Oxley Act of 2002 stands among his best 
work. Responding to a number of major 
corporate accounting scandals, Senator 
Sarbanes’ legislation began the process 
of trying to restore investor confidence 
in corporate America and our securi-
ties markets. Eighteen years later, this 
law continues to be a critical pillar of 
our financial system. 
During his tenure as chair of the 
Joint Economic Committee in the late 
eighties 
and 
early 
nineties, 
Paul 
framed many of the important eco-
nomic issues and debates that the 
country was experiencing at the time. 
He held timely hearings on income in-
equality, trade deficit, and unemploy-
ment during a time at which the coun-
try was only beginning to come to 
grips with the notion that there needed 
to be a different direction in our econ-
omy. 
Unfortunately, our Nation is now 
battling a pandemic that is furthering 
economic inequalities, and both the 
Senate and the country could use and 
greatly 
misses 
Senator 
Sarbanes’ 
thoughtfulness, incisiveness, and com-
passion during these difficult times. 
Senator Sarbanes was also one of our 
Nation’s greatest champions for afford-
able housing. He fought his entire ca-
reer for our Nation’s working families, 
trying to make it possible for more 
families in our country to have decent, 
safe, and affordable housing. 
Most notably, Paul was one of the 
original authors of the Home Invest-
ment Partnerships Program, known as 
the HOME Program. This program has 
provided critical funding to our Na-
tion’s States and localities, helping 
them maintain or expand their supply 
of affordable housing for many Ameri-
cans. 
Paul also fought aggressively for 
funding of the section 8 voucher pro-
gram and was one of the chief sup-
porters of improvements to our Na-
tion’s public housing programs during 
his Senate tenure. 
Senator Sarbanes also recognized the 
essential role that public transpor-
tation plays in bringing communities 
together, fostering economic develop-
ment, and promoting a cleaner envi-
ronment. As ranking member of the 
Banking Committee, he led the effort 
to reauthorize the Nation’s transit pro-
grams and the fight to ensure that 
transit received its fair share of fund-
ing. 
Time after time, Paul Sarbanes did 
the right things for the right reasons. 
He could not care less whether he got 
the credit, the press, or the fanfare. His 
primary motivation was simply know-
ing that he made a meaningful dif-
ference in the lives of his constituents 
and the American people, and, in this 
regard, there are few who are as accom-
plished as Paul Sarbanes. 
His keen intellect, his extensive 
knowledge of the issues, and his con-
cern for Americans across this great 
country all contributed to his impres-
sive body of legislative accomplish-
ments. 
Now, I had the occasion to speak 
with 
JOHN
SARBANES, 
Congressman 
from Maryland, who is carrying on the 
proud tradition of the Sarbanes family, 
and he said his dad was best described 
as a workhorse, not a show horse, and 
that is right. Paul Sarbanes did the 
work of the people. He did not try to 
garner the praise and the acclaim; he 
just wanted to make sure the work was 
done and done well. And he did 
throughout his entire career. 
My best wishes go to Paul’s family, 
including his sons Michael Sarbanes 
and Representative JOHN SARBANES; his 
daughter 
Janet 
Sarbanes; 
and 
his 
grandchildren. They have lost a father 
and a grandfather. The country has 
lost one of its greatest champions. And 
I have lost a dear and precious friend. 
May he rest in peace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on be-
half of Senator VAN HOLLEN and my-
self, I want to thank our colleagues for 
their tribute to Senator Paul Sar-
banes—Senator STABENOW and Senator 
REED. I know that Senator SCHUMER 
and Senator DURBIN have spoken on 
the floor. Many of us have and many 
have 
expressed 
their 
condolences 
through our office to the family. We 
just want to express our appreciation. 
As Senator VAN HOLLEN said, I had 
the honor—or the challenge—to follow 
Senator Sarbanes in this body. I have 
his seat in the Senate. When I was 
sworn in almost 14 years ago, Senator 
Sarbanes escorted me to take the oath 
of office. As I mentioned earlier, he is 
an inspiration to all of us. 
I want to thank our colleagues for 
the tribute they have paid to an out-
standing Marylander, an outstanding 
American, and he will be missed by all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk again 
about the need for Congress to act to 
pass a COVID–19 bill that helps the 
people we represent. I am told this is 
the 20th time I have come to the floor 
to make this plea, meaning that I 
haven’t been all that convincing, I 
guess. 
But the reality is there is hope in the 
air. There is a bipartisan group that is 
working on a package. I am part of 
that group, as is the Presiding Officer. 
It is bipartisan: about five Democrats, 
about five Republicans. 
Maybe more significantly, today the 
White House apparently made an offer 
to Speaker PELOSI to reengage in con-
versation to try to get to a package 
that meets the needs of everyone. The 
package that was presented was actu-
ally very similar to the package that 
this bipartisan group has been working 
on over the past few weeks. So there is 
hope in the air, and that is good be-
cause we need the help, and we need it 
now. 
Let’s talk for a minute about why we 
need this help. I would guess that pret-
ty much everybody in this Chamber 
has seen firsthand the health crisis 
that we are facing. The number of 
cases is up. The number of people in in-
tensive care is up. Hospitalizations are 
up. And, sadly, fatalities have in-
creased. 
Some of my colleagues in this Cham-
ber have had to fight cases of COVID– 
19 themselves. Thank God they are all 
OK. But that is not true with everyone 
we represent. I would bet that everyone 
in this Chamber knows somebody and 
probably multiple people who have had 
a very tough time or who have even 
succumbed to this terrible disease. 
Last week, another friend of mine 
died because of COVID–19. His name 
was Mike Crabtree. Mike was a county 
commissioner in Scioto County, OH—a 
friend, a standup guy who helped me on 
a lot of tough issues in Southeast Ohio. 
He was always there for his community 
and for me. Today, of course, we offer 
our prayers to his wife Diane, his fam-
ily, and to all of his friends in Scioto 
County. 
It is personal. In the face of these 
personal tragedies and the sad reality 
that in many States we are now experi-
encing this higher number of cases—in 
many States it is the highest we have 
had since the beginning of this pan-
demic—we do have some promising 
news on one front, and that is on the 
vaccine front.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7274 
December 8, 2020 
It now seems clear that later this 
month, and then over the next 3 to 4 
months, help is on the way in the form 
of very effective new vaccines being de-
veloped by Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & 
Johnson, AstraZeneca, and other U.S. 
manufacturers. 
The unprecedented support that Con-
gress has provided for vaccine develop-
ment, the Trump administration’s in-
novative approach to cut bureaucratic 
redtape through what is called Oper-
ation Warp Speed, and the commit-
ment and ingenuity of our researchers 
who have been working around the 
clock, our scientists, and our manufac-
turers have combined to put us on a 
path to having multiple vaccines, at 
unprecedented 
speed, 
with 
efficacy 
rates above 90 percent. 
This is incredible. This is good news. 
Safe, effective vaccines are expected to 
be available to frontline healthcare 
workers, first responders, long-term 
care facilities, and others just in the 
next few weeks. This is good news. 
Within the next few months, we 
would expect that these vaccines would 
be more broadly available, and hope-
fully by March, maybe April, pretty 
much everybody would be able to find a 
way to get that vaccine, free, for them 
and for their family. That has to be our 
goal here, as quickly as possible, to get 
safe, effective vaccines. 
I am concerned—as some of my col-
leagues know, because I talk about it a 
lot—that the number of people who say 
they are willing to get the vaccine is 
too low. That is one reason I entered 
one of the trials myself. I am in the 
Janssen J&J trial. I either got the vac-
cine or I got a placebo—I don’t know— 
but I did it to be able to go out and 
talk about it and tell people that these 
scientists, these experts, the people 
with the white coats, not the politi-
cians, are the ones calling the shots 
here on these vaccines and they are 
being safe and they are being careful. 
It is going through a process at the 
FDA, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion, that is actually more stringent 
than it was pre-COVID. To get this 
emergency 
use 
authorization, 
they 
have to go through more testing, and 
they have to show efficacy rates above 
50 
percent, 
which 
they 
normally 
wouldn’t. That is good. We want it to 
be safe. 
Even with all that hard work that is 
being done, all those scientists and re-
searchers working around the clock, 
there are some Americans who are un-
willing and concerned. Part of this is 
because some politicians, I think, have 
played politics with this, and I hate 
that—as if, somehow, in the Trump ad-
ministration, this wouldn’t be trusted. 
Of course, this is not a political game. 
This is about saving lives. 
I am encouraged by the process that 
we have seen. I hope people will sign 
up. When I got into the trial, the Gal-
lup poll that is being done periodically 
to determine whether people are saying 
whether they are willing to take it or 
not was at 50 percent—only 50 percent 
of Americans saying they were com-
fortable getting the vaccine. That 
number in last couple of weeks has 
gone up to 58 percent. It is heading in 
the right direction. 
We need people to understand that 
this is based on science. These vaccines 
are like the vaccine for smallpox or 
polio or measles—virtually, wiping out 
these diseases in this country. My dad 
had polio as a kid. Now people don’t 
even talk about it. That is because of 
the vaccine. They work. We have to 
view it that way. 
It is not like the flu vaccine, frankly. 
The flu vaccine is only effective about 
one-third of the time. These, what they 
call efficacy rates, meaning how effec-
tive it is, have come in at 90, 95 percent 
and higher. So we will see what the 
FDA says here in the next couple of 
weeks. 
I am encouraged that we are likely to 
get some approvals and likely to begin 
being able to provide these vaccines for 
those on the frontlines, for those in 
long-care facilities, for our first re-
sponders, and then out from there to 
the entire population. 
Because these vaccines won’t be 
widely available for 3 or 4 months, we 
need to act here and act now to provide 
a bridge to more normal times. That is 
really how I see it. This is a short-term 
emergency response to a desperate 
need we have right now as cases are 
rising and the economic consequences 
are being felt in every family in Amer-
ica—more and more pain. 
My hope is that Congress will make 
good on the promise we have seen over 
the last couple of weeks, where Repub-
licans and Democrats, alike, have come 
together to say we do have a lot of 
common ground here; we actually 
agree on most of this stuff. Who 
wouldn’t be for more money for vac-
cines and distribution? We need that. 
Who wouldn’t be for more money for 
small businesses? Who wouldn’t be for 
more money for people who are losing 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own? They are struggling to pay the 
rent and pay their car payment. That 
is what this legislation can do. I am ex-
cited about that possibility. 
Meanwhile, in the first week of De-
cember, we have lost 13,726 Americans 
to COVID–19 compared to half that 
many in the first week of November. In 
1 month, we have had a doubling of the 
number of fatalities. At no point in 
time during this pandemic have we 
seen daily mortality rates like this, ex-
cept in the early days in March and 
April when New York and New Jersey 
hospitals were being overrun. We have 
a real crisis. 
Of course, this healthcare crisis is 
having a direct impact on the economy 
too. Even with these vaccines on the 
horizon, it is clear we have to do more 
to help the economy get through this 
period of time before we are back to 
more a normal time. 
We have to help, in the short term, to 
address the impact this healthcare cri-
sis is having on families, on employ-
ment, on businesses, on schools, on 
nonprofits, and, yes, on State and local 
governments. As I see it, our job is to 
provide that bridge so that the eco-
nomic rebound that we have begun to 
see can continue. 
I am concerned that the recovery we 
have seen, which has been called a K- 
shaped recovery—you know, you like 
to see a recovery come in a V-shape, 
where you have a recession, you lose 
jobs and economic growth, and then it 
comes back up the way it went down. 
It is called a V-shape. This has been 
more like a ‘‘K.’’ 
For some people, it has been OK. If 
you are a big-box hardware store or 
grocery store in America, you are prob-
ably doing pretty well right now. If you 
are a small business, say, a small retail 
store or sitdown restaurant next to 
those big boxes, you are not doing OK. 
You may already be closed down. Your 
employees may already be unemployed. 
If not, you are hanging by a thread and 
hoping and praying that Congress 
passes legislation to help you. 
It has been different for different 
people. If you have a blue-collar job, 
you can’t telework. If you are in the fi-
nancial services industry, you are prob-
ably doing OK, but if you work in a 
kitchen making 15 bucks an hour, you 
are probably not. So it is different for 
different people in different sectors of 
our economy. I get that. For some, 
again, they are doing OK; for others, 
they are really struggling. 
Poverty, overall, is up because of 
what is happening, and this is sad to 
me. And we can see it in our commu-
nities. Go to your local food bank, see 
how many cars are lined up, how many 
people are waiting for 3, 4, 5, in Ohio, 
sometimes 6 hours just to get food for 
their families. 
Before the pandemic hit, we had very 
strong economic growth. I think the 
pro-growth policies that were put in 
place here in Congress really helped. 
The tax reform, the tax cuts, the regu-
latory relief, using our energy—it all 
was working. We were having a period 
of growth that was strong, but also it 
was a very ‘‘opportunity’’ economy. 
People who had been on the sidelines 
for years were coming back into our 
economy. A lot of the benefits were 
being felt by lower and middle-income 
workers. 
Let me give you an example. In Feb-
ruary of this year, just before the pan-
demic started, we had 19 straight 
months of wage growth of over 3 per-
cent. That is fantastic. We have been 
wanting that for a decade and a half in 
Ohio. We had flat wages, even not keep-
ing up with inflation. Finally, we were 
seeing wage growth. That 3 percent was 
compounding and was really helping 
people feel like if they worked hard 
and played by the rules, they could get 
ahead. Sadly, when the coronavirus 
hit, that ended. 
Before the coronavirus, the national 
poverty rate was the lowest in the his-
tory of America. In February, it was 
10.5 percent, the lowest rate since we

S7275 
December 8, 2020 
started tracking this statistic more 
than 60 years ago. That is the poverty 
rate. That is incredible. That is what 
we all want. 
After the initial wave of layoffs in 
the spring, Congress passed the bipar-
tisan CARES Act. That was 9 months 
ago—9 months ago. It included pro-
grams like the stimulus checks and ex-
panded unemployment insurance. It ac-
tually helped drive the poverty rate 
down for a while. 
Since then, this continual economic 
pain felt particularly by low- and mid-
dle-income Americans, combined with 
the lack of action on our part here in 
Congress to help them, has meant the 
poverty rate has actually gone back up 
since May by a significant amount. It 
now sits at 11.4 percent. That means 
that 7 million more Americans have 
fallen into poverty since the spring—7 
million. 
When you fall into poverty, it is hard 
to get back out. As long as this econ-
omy remains partly shut down—in 
some of our States, it is largely shut 
down if you are in the hospitality busi-
ness or travel business. As long as this 
happens and we can see more shut-
downs 
in 
the 
coming 
weeks 
and 
months, of course, as this crisis con-
tinues to worsen, we will see poverty 
levels rise unless we provide some re-
lief. 
Along with the rising poverty rate, 
what is concerning to me is the fact 
that more and more people are just giv-
ing up hope. There is a stat called the 
labor force participation rate. It is the 
share of Americans who are over 16 
years old, either working or looking for 
a job. In February, we hit a 5-year high 
for labor force participation. That is a 
good thing. In other words, we had 
more people participating in the work-
force than we had in 5 years. 
Unfortunately, it has gone back 
down. It was up to 63.4 percent. Now it 
is down to 61.7 percent. The October 
number works out to a labor force that 
has nearly 4 million fewer participants 
than it did in February. Just people 
participating in the economy has gone 
down. 
Why do we need this package? We 
have a real problem on our hands. It is 
a healthcare crisis, but it is also an 
economic crisis for so many people. 
Unfortunately, a record number of 
women and older Americans are also 
having to leave the workplace due to 
either a lack of opportunity or the 
need to stay home with their kids. For 
a lot of women, not having childcare is 
a real problem because the schools are 
closed. This is driving people out of the 
workforce as well. This is bad news for 
businesses trying to reopen, but it is 
also bad news for our long-term eco-
nomic health. 
People who can’t find a way off the 
sidelines right now won’t be able to 
help power the eventual economic re-
covery we all hope for, and they will 
miss out on the economic recovery 
that does happen. It is a bad position 
to be in. 
We saw with last week’s jobs report 
that hiring is slowing down, meaning 
that more people may slip out of the 
labor force. In all, we are still down 10 
million jobs in America since Feb-
ruary. 
Some of my colleagues said to me: 
My town is doing great or my State is 
doing great or this industry is doing 
great. I get that. It is a K-shaped re-
covery. For some people, it is going 
well. The fact is that 10 million peo-
ple—10 million people—that is how 
many jobs we are down since February. 
A further slowdown in the economy 
is going to be tough for these long- 
term unemployed. My concern is some 
may never reenter the workforce with-
out action here to help businesses start 
hiring again. Some of the hardest hit 
industries in our States, like the trav-
el, leisure, hospitality industries, are 
facing real losses. 
Our airline industry is expected to 
cut the equivalent of about 90,000 jobs 
by the end of this year—90,000 jobs 
alone in the airline industry. I spoke to 
the president of American Airlines 
today. They are big in Ohio. He called. 
Guess what. He is really eager for us to 
pass this coronavirus legislation we are 
talking about. He is really eager be-
cause he needs it desperately to hold 
on to his employees. He doesn’t want 
to furlough any more people, but he 
doesn’t have the business to keep them 
working. 
According to a November survey 
from the American Hotel and Lodging 
Association, more than 70 percent of 
hotels have said that they won’t be 
able to stay in business another 6 
months without more assistance—70 
percent. Almost 80 percent said they 
had to lay off more people. 
Our restaurant industry lost jobs in 
November for the first time since 
April. It is a worrying sign that while 
restaurants were starting to pick up, 
things were getting better, in Novem-
ber, because of the news of the high 
level of cases and the concern people 
had about going out in public and also, 
in some States, because of a govern-
ment edict saying you can’t go—in 
some places, they even said you can’t 
have outdoor dining anymore, not just 
indoor dining. Think of what this does 
to those restaurants, most of which are 
small businesses, family-owned, and 
were already stressed. Some of those 
restaurants have closed their doors. I 
know some of them are never going to 
reopen again. It is not just restaurants. 
It is bowling alleys; it is movie thea-
ters; it is the place you get your hair 
cut. A lot of them are suffering. 
A lot of these challenges are going to 
get worse soon because the number of 
the programs we put in place in this 
pandemic to help provide relief for peo-
ple struggling are going to expire. That 
is another reason we have to act. 
At the end of this year—actually, the 
day before Christmas—we are going to 
see some of these programs begin to ex-
pire. The pandemic unemployment as-
sistance program that helps the self- 
employed, that helps gig economy 
workers, people who would not nor-
mally be eligible for unemployment to 
be able to step forward and get unem-
ployment insurance, is going to end at 
the end of this month. That is some-
thing a lot of my constituents in Ohio 
have been depending on if they have 
lost their jobs through no fault of their 
own. 
The pandemic emergency employ-
ment compensation program that au-
thorizes another 13 weeks of State ben-
efits, helped by the Federal tax dollar, 
ends at the end of this month. 
Of course, there is a moratorium on 
evictions that ends at the end of this 
month. 
The bottom line is that the people, 
State and local governments, the in-
dustries, the sectors of our economy 
that have been hardest hit to date by 
the economic crisis caused by COVID– 
19 are going to be the ones who are 
likely to be hurt most by a continued 
economic slowdown. 
As I said, these are problems that, 
right now, can only be fixed by all of us 
stepping forward. Congress needs to 
take action and take action now. We 
have about a week. We have about a 
week. 
Fortunately, again, I am pleased to 
say that the proposal that is in the 
works on a bipartisan basis here in the 
Senate is going to help. It has a total 
price tag of $908 billion, and you have 
all heard that, probably, if you have 
been following what has been going on 
with this continuing negotiation. 
It helps everybody. It helps individ-
uals; it helps families; it helps small 
businesses; it helps industries; it helps 
those who have been the hardest hit— 
with targeted resources. It is focused. 
It is targeted. It is not the $3.5 trillion 
legislation that has been talked about 
over the last several months. It is tar-
geted. It is focused. Actually, although 
it is $908 billion, it is really more like 
$350 billion because it takes back 
money that was spent in the CARES 
Act, which was appropriated by this 
Congress but not used, and repurposes 
it for these purposes. So I think it is a 
focused, targeted effort that will really 
help. 
Again, what is exciting about it is 
that, today, there was a proposal made 
that says we have this bipartisan 
framework, which is very similar, ap-
parently, and my hope is that the 
Speaker of the House, the majority 
leader here in the Senate, the Demo-
cratic leader here in the Senate, the 
Republican leader in the House, and 
the President of the United States can 
all figure out how to get together and 
make this work. This bipartisan pro-
posal that we have been working on 
here, I think, does provide a good tem-
plate. By the way, all of those actors I 
talked about—all of those players— 
have said good things about the pro-
posal. 
It has funding in there to extend the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
for 
small businesses. It targets those small

businesses that need the help the most. 
It is really more targeted this time. It 
is targeted relief for some of our hard-
est hit industries, including our air-
lines and our mass transit industry. 
It includes funds to help those Amer-
icans who have lost their jobs through 
no fault of their own—the unemploy-
ment insurance extension that I talked 
about earlier. As a bridge to normalcy, 
we need this funding. It provides funds 
for State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments based on their revenue shortfalls 
or their expenses due to COVID—in 
other words, needs-based. 
We are also working on commonsense 
liability reforms to give businesses, 
nonprofits, schools, healthcare pro-
viders, 
religious 
organizations, 
and 
others the legal protection they need 
to reopen with the confidence that 
they are not going to be subjected to 
frivolous lawsuits that could put them 
out of business. That is really impor-
tant because getting these businesses 
back up and running is a critical part 
of getting our economy through these 
next few months. In my view, these 
protections are essential. 
I am hopeful that both sides can now 
come 
together 
and 
find 
common 
ground on liability protections that we 
can all support. Several of my col-
leagues are working on a proposal here, 
right now, in the U.S. Senate. All of 
this gives us hope that we will have 
better days around the corner. 
By the way, this proposal is not what 
any of us would write. It is not the pro-
posal I would write. It is not the pro-
posal our Presiding Officer, who is here 
in the Chamber, would write. Person-
ally, I would put more emphasis on tax 
incentives for hiring. We have some 
good proposals for that. I would put tax 
incentives in place to get businesses to 
reopen safely—one called the healthy 
workplaces tax credit so they could get 
compensated for putting up the parti-
tions or for having the PPE and pro-
viding safer work environments. I 
would expand the work opportunity tax 
credit to help those, again, who are on 
the sidelines in order to bring them 
back to work through a credit. I would 
help with regard to the employee re-
tention 
credit, 
which 
was 
in 
the 
CARES Act, that could pick up some of 
these companies that aren’t picked up 
by the PPP program, companies that 
have slightly more employees, let’s 
say, so that they don’t otherwise qual-
ify. 
So there is more I would like to do, 
but do you know what? This proposal is 
needed. It is needed so badly that, of 
course, all of us, regardless of our par-
ticular interests or our particular 
ideas, know it is right, and all of us 
should get behind it. Let’s not make 
the perfect the enemy of the good—I 
would even say the enemy of the nec-
essary. Targeted relief now, I think, is 
the right approach. 
Most importantly, all of these sig-
nificant economic problems I laid out 
and the healthcare crisis I laid out 
need to be addressed now. As I said ear-
lier, there is a light at the end of the 
tunnel for the health side of this crisis, 
and our proposal that I have been talk-
ing about also helps us get there be-
cause it has more funding for vaccine 
development and vaccine distribution. 
I talked today to some experts in that 
area who know a lot more about it 
than I do, and they said it is necessary. 
We actually have to provide more fund-
ing to keep the vaccine train moving so 
that, by March and April, we will have 
it widely available. Again, my hope is 
that Americans will step up and be vac-
cinated. 
By the way, there is also bipartisan 
legislation that four of us introduced 
last 
week—two 
Republicans, 
two 
Democrats—to provide for a public 
service campaign, not with politicians 
talking about the importance, as I am 
doing tonight, but with the experts 
talking about why the science says 
that it is a good idea to get vac-
cinated—again, just like we do for 
smallpox or polio or the measles. 
Will another COVID–19 bill solve 
every problem we face right now? No, 
but we could do a lot with this proposal 
to help the most vulnerable individuals 
just get by for the next several months 
rather than slip into poverty, rather 
than miss out on mortgage payments 
or miss out on their rent, miss out on 
their car payments, and other bad out-
comes. We can help the most vulner-
able businesses keep their lights on and 
their employees on payroll. Frankly, 
this is work we should have been doing 
months ago, but we are here now. Let’s 
get it done. 
My hope is that we can end this year 
by recapturing that spirit of biparti-
sanship that was on display in March 
of this year when we passed the CARES 
package here in the U.S. Senate by a 
vote of 96 to nothing. That doesn’t hap-
pen very often. The CARES Act was 
not a perfect bill either, but we all rec-
ognized it was a bill needed for the mo-
ment. I hope we can also recognize that 
another bill is needed now even if it is 
not perfect. Let’s build on the bipar-
tisan proposal we have put forward, 
and let’s ensure that the people we rep-
resent get the targeted economic relief 
they desperately need in the coming 
months. 
Folks, let’s not leave for the holidays 
until we have done that. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when 
Senator TOM
UDALL
announced last 
year that he would not seek reelection, 
he said, ‘‘The worst thing anyone in 
public office can do is believe the office 
belongs to them, rather than to the 
people they represent.’’ Throughout his 
more than three decades of service to 
his State and to our Nation, TOM has 
demonstrated time and again his ad-
herence to that principle. As New 
Mexico’s attorney general, Congress-
man, and Senator, he has always treat-
ed public office as a public trust. 
Everyone who serves in this Chamber 
takes an oath to support and defend 
our 
Constitution. 
That 
remarkable 
document begins with three words TOM 
lives by, ‘‘We the People.’’ 
That commitment to our Constitu-
tion was put to the test in early 2019 
when the President issued an emer-
gency declaration that diverted $ 3.6 
billion from 127 military construction 
projects that Congress duly approved 
and funded and the President had 
signed into law. TOM
stood strong 
against this clear violation of the sepa-
ration of powers doctrine that is so 
vital to our enduring Republic, and I 
was proud to stand with him. 
In a powerful floor statement on the 
resolution we introduced to overturn 
the emergency declaration, TOM
got 
right to the point. He said: 
This is no longer about the president’s 
wall. This is not about party. This is about 
protecting the very heart of our American 
system of governance. Congress—and only 
Congress—holds the power of the purse. 
TOM also made clear that this en-
croachment upon Congress’s authority 
was not an isolated incident but part of 
a dangerous pattern Congress has per-
mitted over many decades and under 
many Presidents. And make no mis-
take—the hyperpartisanship that af-
flicts Congress far too often aids and 
abets this lamentable historical trend. 
By pursuing a bipartisan response to 
this Executive overreach, TOM helped 
to make real progress in defending the 
separation of powers. 
It has been a pleasure to work with 
Tom on many other issues over the 
years. From land conservation and en-
vironmental protection to rural health 
care and pandemic relief, he has been 
an informed and effective legislative 
partner. 
TOM leaves the Senate with an im-
pressive record of accomplishments. 
Even more important, he leaves a leg-
acy of reverence for our Constitution 
and courage in defending it. I thank 
him for his service to the people of our 
Nation and wish him well in the years 
to come.

REMEMBERING ERNIE BAPTISTA 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
we recently lost a great Rhode Is-
lander, Ernie Baptista. 
Ernie was immensely successful in 
his professional life; his wise counsel 
was sought not just around the country 
but around the globe. Ernie was also a 
civic-minded 
community 
leader 
at 
home, with a passion for politics. He 
immersed himself in Rhode Island’s po-
litical whirl, where he was well liked 
and well regarded by people of many 
different political perspectives. Ernie’s 
keen insight and advice was relied 
upon by many candidates, including 
myself and Senator REED. We both 
treasured Ernie’s quick wit, sharp in-
tellect, and great sense of humor. He 
was bright, insightful, and loyal and al-
ways provided wise counsel. 
Ernie enjoyed the good things in life: 
good friends, good meals, and good

TRIBUTE TO DAVID E. BENOR 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
am honored to thank and congratulate 
one of my constituents and one of the 
Federal Government’s unsung heroes, 
David E. ‘‘Dave’’ Benor, who is retiring 
on January 3, 2021, after more than 48 
years of service as a public health at-
torney at the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services’ Office of 
the General Counsel, HHS–OGC. 
After graduating from Harvard Law 
School in 1972, Mr. Benor began his ca-
reer at HHS–OGC and never left, rising 
to positions of increasing responsi-
bility throughout the years. Since 2004, 
he has served as the Associate General 
Counsel for Public Health. In this lead-
ership role, he has led HHS–OGC’s Pub-
lic Health Division, a 100-person office 
within HHS–OGC that provides legal 
services to the Assistant Secretary for 
Health, the Surgeon General, and mul-
tiple agencies that comprise the Public 
Health Service, including the National 
Institutes of Health, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, the In-
dian Health Service, the Health Serv-
ices and Resources Administration, the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, and the Agen-
cy for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity. Mr. Benor has worked extensively 
on product liability, grant law, organ 
transplant, and vaccine issues, and has 
particular expertise with the Public 
Health Service safety net programs, in 
public 
health 
emergency 
response 
issues, and in implementing regulatory 
and compensation programs. 
Mr. Benor has dedicated his entire 
career to implementing HHS’s mission 
to advance the health of all people. He 
has done this by providing authori-
tative legal advice on major health ini-
tiatives, including those related to bio-
terrorism preparedness, biomedical re-
search, organ transplantation, vaccine 
development and liability, and the pro-
vision of healthcare to medically un-
derserved populations through such 
programs as the community health 
center program, the Ryan White HIV/ 
AIDS Program, and maternal and child 
health grants. He has been a key legal 
adviser on the Department’s inter-
national health initiatives, including 
Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction, global 
AIDS programs, and quarantine activi-
ties for diseases such as SARS, pan-
demic influenza, and monkey pox, and 
has been part of multidisciplinary 
teams working on the public health re-
sponse to the War on Terrorism, in-
cluding the response to anthrax at-
tacks, smallpox vaccine development, 
COVID–19, and pharmaceutical stock-
pile development. 
Mr. Benor has received numerous 
awards throughout his career. In 2012, 
President Barack Obama awarded Mr. 
Benor the Presidential Rank Award of 
Meritorious Executive, one of the high-
est awards that a career Senior Execu-
tive Service member may receive. 
Dave Benor’s impact on public health 
will be felt for years to come both 
through his work on a wide variety of 
public health programs and by the in-
spiring example he has provided for the 
many attorneys with whom he worked 
and mentored. I was pleased to have a 
flag flown over the U.S. Capitol over 
the Thanksgiving holiday weekend as a 
symbol of our Nation’s thanks to this 
outstanding public servant. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
paying tribute to Dave Benor for his 
distinguished service to our country 
and to wish him all the best in the 
coming years as he enjoys his well- 
earned retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SCOTT FRYE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to honor the career of New Hamp-
shire State Trooper Scott Frye, who 
recently retired from the force. 
A native of Milford, NH, Scott served 
with the New Hampshire State Police 
for more than 22 years as a road troop-
er, a member of the narcotics unit, and 
most recently as head of the executive 
protection detail. During his time in 
executive 
protection, 
Scott 
served 
under three Governors, including for 4 
years during my time as Governor. 
Through our work together, I saw 
firsthand Scott’s commitment to the 
Granite State. He always sees the big 
picture; he can step into a room and 
immediately assess it and the people in 
it, both as a security risk, but also for 
need. Scott can find a way to connect 
with and put almost anyone at ease. As 
a result, he is greeted as a welcome 
friend wherever he goes in New Hamp-
shire. 
While Scott served for nearly a dozen 
years on the security detail of Gov-
ernors, he never lost sight of his com-
mitment and obligation to protect the 
safety of every person in New Hamp-
shire. 
Scott’s experience and deep under-
standing of the Granite State were an 
important benefit to those he worked 
with. When we would travel to sites of 
natural disasters during my time as 
Governor, Scott always had a sense 
about who needed to be checked in 
with and what a community or a public 
safety official needed in challenging 
times. Even when his day ended and he 
was officially off-duty, if he were on his 
way home and an extra State trooper 
was needed, he would be there to help 
in any way that he could. 
Perhaps nothing exemplifies Scott’s 
dedication, bravery, and heroism more 
than when he was driving Governor 
John Lynch in 2012 and they witnessed 
an accident. A car had gone through a 
guardrail, fallen into an embankment, 
and caught fire. Scott pulled over, and 
along with an off-duty firefighter, freed 
a man who was trapped in the vehicle— 
just seconds before it was engulfed in 
flames. For his lifesaving action, Scott 
was honored with a number of awards, 
including a Carnegie Medal, a national 
honor that recognizes those who risk 
their lives to an extraordinary degree 
while saving or attempting to save the 
lives of others. 
Throughout his service, Scott ap-
proached everything with humor, kind-
ness, and patience. He never com-
plained, and he always served with an 
incredible amount of professionalism. 
Above all, Scott’s main commitment 
was to his family. His service would 
not have been possible without the sup-
port and love of his wife Susan, his 
sons Zachary and Matthew, and his ex-
tended family. 
I am grateful for Scott’s friendship 
and his years of dedication to the peo-
ple of New Hampshire. His retirement 
is well-deserved, and I know that he 
will continue to look for ways to im-
prove his community and the entire 
Granite State. 
I hope that you will join me in recog-
nizing the years of service of State 
Trooper Scott Frye.∑

REMEMBERING DEE BENSON 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor Judge Dee Benson, who passed 
away this week after a heroic battle 
with cancer. Dee had a remarkable and 
far-reaching legal career, making an 
impact throughout Utah and the coun-
try. But even more than that, he has 
made an indelible mark as a beloved 
teacher, 
mentor, 
role 
model, 
and 
friend. 
Dee grew up on small farm in Jordan, 
UT, across from the old Jordan High 
School. He served a 2-year mission in 
Sweden for the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints and afterwards at-
tended BYU, graduating in 1973 with a 
degree in physical education. After a 
brief stint as a student teacher and 
soccer coach at Hillcrest High, he de-
cided to change career paths and on a 
whim applied to law school. 
Dee stumbled onto what would be-
come a brilliant vocation in law. He 
was one of the very first law students 
at Brigham Young University, when 
my late father, Rex Lee, was founding 
BYU’s J. Reuben Clark Law School. 
Dee quickly took to law, grasping legal 
concepts with speed and ease, and soon 
became a star of his class, even with-
out spending all his time in the libary. 
He was an equally affable student, 
loved by all of his classmates. A gifted 
athlete, he still managed to participate 
in school activities and sports while in 
law school, even playing for the soccer 
team during his final year and fin-
ishing near the top of his class. 
After graduating in 1976, Dee spent a 
few months playing professional soccer

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7278 
December 8, 2020 
with the Utah Golden Spikers of the 
American Soccer League, and then 
turned to his law career. He started out 
in private practice, first at Marineau 
and Mack and then at Christensen and 
Martineau. He would later be appointed 
to positions at the highest levels of law 
by Presidents, Chief Justices, and Sen-
ators. 
He came to Washington first to work 
as counsel for the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
Dee 
was 
then-Senator 
Orrin Hatch’s chief of staff for 2 years 
and while there served as counsel on 
the Iran-Contra Congressional Inves-
tigating Committee. He worked as U.S. 
attorney from 1989 until 1991, when he 
was appointed by President George 
H.W. Bush to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Utah, where 
he served for nearly three decades. 
As Federal judge, he was appointed 
as one of the seven judges to the For-
eign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Act 
Court 
by 
Chief 
Justice 
William 
Rehnquist, frequently flying to Wash-
ington to review requests for warrants 
and wiretaps against suspected spies 
and terrorists. He was also appointed 
by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve 
on the Judicial Conference of the 
United States, a policy-making body 
within the Federal judicial system. 
Dee had a deep love of the law and 
true impartiality as a jurist. In all of 
his duties, he never sought to impose 
his own agenda but simply to get the 
law right—not according to his own 
personal beliefs or feelings but as he 
understood it. And as much as Dee 
loved the law, he was loved by those 
around him. He brought kindness, 
humor, and fun to every environment. 
He was known to keep a bicycle in his 
chambers and a dart board for his 
clerks. 
I myself was lucky enough to have 
him as my first boss when I clerked for 
him the year after I graduated from 
law school. I learned more about the 
practice of law during that clerkship 
than I did during all 3 years of law 
school combined. I will never forget 
our countless conversations about the 
law—deep dives on everything from 
compelled-speech doctrine , the cocon-
spirator hearsay rule, and the require-
ments for authenticating so-called ‘‘an-
cient documents’’ under the Federal 
Rules of Evidence—in the courtroom 
and in his chambers and sometimes 
even while mountain biking or during a 
game of ping pong or darts. 
Everyone at the courthouse—from 
the prosecutors to the defense counsel, 
from civil litigants to criminal defend-
ants, from probation officers to support 
staff—loved and learned daily from 
Judge Benson. Despite his keen intel-
lect and prominence, he was one of the 
most humble, genuine people I have 
ever known. He cared deeply about the 
happiness of those around them and 
left everyone more happy and encour-
aged than when he found them. He 
treated each person who came into his 
courtoom with dignity and respect, no 
matter who you were. 
Throughout the years, Dee retained 
his passion for sports and zest for life. 
He ran marathons, was an avid moun-
tain biker, and mastered every sport 
that caught his interest. He was a de-
voted father who, despite the many de-
mands on his time, seemed to maintain 
constant contact with each of his four 
children, taking delight in every word 
they uttered and every activity they 
pursued. 
Even his cancer diagnosis would not 
dampen his spirit or slow him down. 
After being partially paralyzed and 
bedridden this past May, by the end of 
the month he had returned to his 
chambers in Salt Lake City and had 
come into work as recently as last 
week—steadfast and strong until the 
end. 
Judge Dee Benson was a true public 
servant, a gift to Utah and to everyone 
who had the good fortune to meet him. 
For those of us who knew and loved 
Dee, the world will now seem incom-
plete; but it has been an honor and a 
blessing to call him a mentor and a 
friend.∑

HONORING MAYOR ELIZABETH 
PATTERSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Elizabeth 
Patterson, and to celebrate her retirement 
from the City of Benicia after 17 years of pub-
lic service. 
Born in Los Angeles, Mayor Patterson has 
lived in Benicia since 1983. Prior to her time 
in local government, she worked for Califor-
nia’s Department of Water Resources as an 
environmental scientist for three decades and 
served as the Executive Director of the Part-
nership for Regional Livability on the White 
House Task Force on Livable Communities 
under President Clinton. In 2003, Mayor Pat-
terson was elected to the Benicia City Council, 
where she served for four years before being 
elected as Mayor in 2007. 
Throughout her years of leadership in 
Benicia, Mayor Patterson has championed en-
vironmental preservation initiatives. She was 
instrumental in the creation of Benicia’s Com-
munity Sustainability Commission, which will 
promote environmentally friendly economic de-
velopment for years to come. Mayor Patterson 
has also played a vital role in enacting 
Benicia’s Water Smart Program, both con-
serving water and lowering costs for the com-
munity. Beyond her commitment to sustain-
ability, Mayor Patterson has been a leader in 
promoting cultural advancement and preserva-
tion in Benicia by creating Benicia’s Arts and 
Cultural Commission and increasing the num-
ber of designated historical properties. 
Madam Speaker, Mayor Patterson is an out-
standing public servant with a deep dedication 
to her community. Even in retirement, she 
plans to continue fighting for environmental 
protections. Mayor Patterson exemplifies true 
leadership and integrity, and she will have a 
lasting impact on the City of Benicia. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MICHAEL J. PETYO, SR. 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the life of Michael J. Petyo, 
who passed in July at the age of 91. 
Michael was a Minnesotan, and a resident 
of Belle Plaine and Coon Rapids. He proudly 
served as a Sergeant in the United States Air 
Force and was a veteran of the Korean War. 
Michael and his wife of 67 years, Dorothy, 
raised a beautiful family with six children, six-
teen grandchildren, and ten great-grand-
children. 
On July 11, Michael was interred at Fort 
Snelling National Cemetery, in a monument to 
his service to our state and nation. 
My thoughts are with the Petyo family, who 
have suffered a great loss: that of a loving fa-
ther, grandfather and great-grandfather. Mi-
chael’s dedication to service for the public 
good is enshrined in his legacy and his family. 
f 
IN HONOR OF TERRI COOK 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Terri Cook, an outstanding public 
servant, as she retires from her position as 
City Clerk for the City of Belmont. Terri was 
elected as clerk in 2002 and served as an 
elected official until this year when the position 
transitioned to an appointed one. 
City clerks are an integral part of the oper-
ation of a city. Clerks must keep accurate 
records of city council meetings and votes as 
well as minutes and votes from numerous 
commissions and advisory boards. The out-
come of lawsuits over city actions sometimes 
hinges on accurate records, as does the eligi-
bility of the city for federal and state funding. 
Elections to the city council or to other elected 
positions are operated by the clerk’s office, 
and Terri enjoys serving as an authority for 
new candidates. 
Terri has many other responsibilities as a 
clerk. She was the liaison to the group that 
created the Veteran’s Memorial in Twin Pines 
Park, and she helped her friend, the late 
councilmember Eric Reed, fulfill this dream of 
a memorial before his own untimely passing. 
She took over the annual veteran’s recognition 
and has been its lead ever since. She also 
worked with the city to adopt the 101st Air-
borne Division, I–327th Infantry C Company 
based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Among 
other activities, she helped ship nonperishable 
goods to these troops during overseas deploy-
ments. 
Terri’s family has lived in Belmont since 
1931 and her priorities both as a candidate 
and volunteer reflect her love of the city. Her 
career in public service spans a remarkable 
37 years as she served as an administrative 
assistant in the San Carlos schools, as a 
member of the Belmont Planning Commission 
from 1993 to 1997, and then as a Belmont 
City Council member from 1997 to 2002. She 
was mayor in 1999. 
As a civic activist she opposed construction 
of a massive, double-deck overpass at the 
intersection of the El Camino and Ralston Av-
enue, and supported preservation of Twin 
Pines Park. In her volunteer work she served 
as an open space task force member, a mem-
ber of the board of the Belmont Park Boost-
ers, an historical society member, as an advi-
sor to the schools on facility renovation, and 
as a member of her homeowner’s association. 
When she ran for the city council, this life-
long resident focused on quality of life issues. 
One priority was clearly stated in her can-
didate’s statement: traffic, traffic, traffic. 
To relieve congestion, she supported a 
grade separation at the Caltrain tracks and 
Ralston Avenue, a project that subsequently 
came to pass, and the need to protect parks 
and open spaces. She also supported rebuild-
ing a fire station, developing a town hall for-
mat for council meetings so that the public 
could interact with the council in a more pro-
ductive manner, and a revision of the city’s 
sign ordinance to reduce visual clutter. As a 
planning commissioner and city council mem-
ber, she supported the renovation or creation 
of many tax-generating businesses such as a 
local auto dealership, a new grocery store, ap-
proval of several hotels, and the maintenance 
of Belmont’s small-town atmosphere. While I 
was a member of the state legislature, Terri 
would sometimes call. I always took the call 
and often heeded her insightful advice. 
Madam Speaker, Terri Cook looks upon the 
community as her family and her dedication to 
the city and its future is legendary. We wish 
her well in the years ahead. All who love a 
community eventually get to pass along the 
reins of leadership to the next generation. As 
Terri Cook does so, she will leave her commu-
nity in good order and with much of her im-
print upon its features. She will long be re-
membered and admired by all of us. This fond 
remembrance is a lasting testament to a re-
markable local leader.

IN TRIBUTE TO EMILIO E. LOPEZ 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Emilio E. Lopez, an icon in the His-
panic community and the City of Milwaukee. 
He passed away on October 31, 2020. He 
was 70 years old. I offer my sincere condo-
lences to Emilio’s family and have them in my 
thoughts and prayers. 
Mr. Lopez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, 
and arrived in the U.S. at the age of 3. He 
grew up on Milwaukee’s east side with his 
parents and siblings. He graduated from Lin-
coln High School in 1968 and was the Prom 
King. Emilio went on to graduate from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison and was presi-
dent of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity before 
attending law school. Soon after, he dutifully 
served as the Assistant District Attorney of 
Milwaukee and even ran for circuit court judge 
and alderman; paving the way for future Latino 
candidates. 
Realizing he wanted to work outside the 
confines of the courtroom, Emilio went on to 
empower thousands of youth in the commu-
nity. Some of his notable achievements in-
clude his work as the Athletic Director of the 
United Community Center (UCC). He encour-
aged youths to stay off the streets by hosting 
late night basketball games and mentoring. 
His hard work was instrumental in the imple-
mentation of youth and drug rehabilitation pro-
grams for the Latino Community. 
Emilio was also an educator and worked as 
the Principal of Aurora Weier Educational 
Center, a high school serving high risk stu-
dents. He raised significant funds to renovate 
the former city natatorium into new class-
rooms, a new gymnasium, and science lab. 
He was President and Founder of the Felix 
Mantilla Little League, where he coached 
youths. He also served as the Associate Exec-
utive Director at the Milwaukee Christian Cen-
ter (MCC) for a number of years. In his spare 
time, he dedicated his time to the Milwaukee 
Chapter of the National Latino Peace Officer 
Association. He was a true Milwaukee treas-
ure and above all he was a devout husband, 
loving father, grandfather, great-grandfather, 
relative and friend to many in Milwaukee. 
Emilio lived a purposeful life, one of service 
dedicated to his community as an advocate 
and leader to countless Hispanic and Latino 
families on Milwaukee’s Southside. Emilio’s 
positive impact and generosity knew no 
bounds; he was well known and respected 
throughout our city and was recognized as 
Hispanic Man of the Year in 1992 for his con-
tributions to the community. 
I am pleased to say I had the pleasure to 
work closely with Emilio when he served as 
Associate Director at the MCC and led the 
federally funded Youthbuild Program. He was 
a true Milwaukee treasure and we are all ben-
efactors. 
Madam Speaker, Emilio E. Lopez was a val-
ued member of the Milwaukee community, the 
4th Congressional District, and the entire State 
of Wisconsin. I applaud and value his con-
tributions as a public servant and am pleased 
to honor the late Emilio E. Lopez.

HONORING MAYOR BOB SAMPAYAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor Bob 
Sampayan in honor of the impact he had on 
the community of Vallejo, California during his 
tenure as mayor and his achievements as a 
public servant. 
Raised 
in 
Salinas, 
California, 
Mayor 
Sampayan graduated from San Jose State 
University with a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal 
Justice. He worked as a police officer in Sali-
nas and Palo Alto before joining the Vallejo 
Police Department in 1985. After 27 years as 
a Vallejo police officer, Mayor Sampayan re-
tired as a Sergeant to join a local non-profit, 
overseeing several neighborhood revitalization 
projects. In 2011, he returned to public service 
after being elected to the Vallejo City Council, 
where he served for four years before being 
elected in 2016 as the first Filipino American 
to serve as Mayor in the City of Vallejo. 
Mayor Sampayan has had a significant im-
pact during his years of public service. His 
work on the council has been vital to the de-
velopment and improvement of Mare Island. 
While on the City Council, he also played a 
key role in Vallejo’s financial recovery from 
bankruptcy and worked to create economic 
stability for the City. As Mayor, he has over-
seen an annual budget reserve of nearly $1 
million, ensuring Vallejo’s fiscal wellbeing in 
the years to come. He has also fought for so-
lutions to the housing crisis and to improve 
homelessness in Vallejo, successfully securing 
over $7 million in funding to create a resource 
center for the unsheltered. Mayor Sampayan 
has been a fierce advocate of sustainable 
growth and development for the City, and his 
leadership and dedication have undoubtedly 
been an inspiration to those who have known 
him. 
Madam Speaker, Mayor Sampayan is a 
committed public servant and outstanding 
leader who has dedicated his life to serving 
his community. It is therefore fitting and proper 
that we honor him here today. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT 
COMMANDER JAMES LYONS 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant 
Commander James Lyons for his faithful serv-
ice to our country as an esteemed member of 
the Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. In this capac-
ity, Lieutenant Commander Lyons facilitated 
interaction between the Department of the 
Navy and Members of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. These engagements included, 
but were not limited to, formal responses to 
congressional inquiries, counsel to Members 
and staff, and execution of congressional and 
staff delegations. These interactions were piv-
otal in providing Members and staff a greater 
understanding of the issues facing our Navy 
and its sailors. 
I am particularly proud to note that Lieuten-
ant Commander Lyons planned and executed 
CODEL Scalise to the U.S. Southern Com-
mand area of responsibility to visit key U.S. al-
lies in Central and South America in order to 
update Members on the role of China in the 
region, bilateral trade and regional trading re-
lationships, and the role of U.S. military, secu-
rity, and humanitarian aid in improving re-
gional stability and preserving our relation-
ships in the AOR. I am forever grateful for his 
leadership, 
persistence, 
and 
support 
of 
CODEL Scalise. 
Lieutenant 
Lyons’ 
distinguished 
career 
began after commissioning in the U.S. Navy 
from the George Washington University. After 
completing flight training in Pensacola, FL and 
Meridian, MS, Lieutenant Commander Lyons 
received his Wings of Gold and was assigned 
to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Thirty to 
fly the venerable C–2 Greyhound. During his 
time as a ‘‘Provider’’, James deployed to 4th 
Fleet area of operations, logged 1000 flight 
hours, completed 89 carrier arrested landings 
and was named 2017 Pacific Fleet Greyhound 
Pilot of the Year. 
Madam Speaker, I commend and thank 
Lieutenant Commander James Lyons on his 
service to the United States of America, the 
House of Representatives, and my office. I 
wish him all the best in his future endeavors. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in recog-
nizing him today.

HONORING YING TANG 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Ying C. Tang, who 
passed away on Wednesday, April 15, 2020, 
at the age of 92. Ying was a legend among 
us, part of the greatest generation who an-
swered the call of duty and valiantly served 
his country to protect American values at 
home and abroad. In recognition of his brav-
ery, patriotism, and commitment to preserving 
our liberty, Ying was awarded the Congres-
sional Gold Medal—the highest civilian rec-
ognition granted by Congress. Ying’s life em-
bodied the greatest ideals of our nation, and

for his selfless service and sacrifice, we are 
forever indebted. 
A true native son of Arizona, Ying was born 
in the back room of Sunrise Grocery Store, 
the family business, located at the southwest 
corner of Central Avenue and Indian School 
Road in the heart of central Phoenix. The 
fourth of 12 children, Ying attended Glendale 
High School before enlisting in the U.S. Navy 
at the young age of 18. He willingly served 
during World War II from 1945 to 1946 before 
returning to Arizona to build a life in the state 
he called home. 
Upon his return to Phoenix, Ying devoted 
himself to the family grocery store. What start-
ed from his father’s humble beginnings 
sparked his passion to expand the family busi-
ness into a chain that served many in our 
community. His fidelity to family and the busi-
ness they created cultivated his entrepre-
neurial legacy. Whether in real estate, com-
mercial investments, retail projects, or any of 
his business pursuits, Ying treated his col-
leagues and community partners with dignity 
and respect as if they were his own family. He 
was a man of deep admiration whose spirit 
brought light to every room he entered, and 
his business success shaped future genera-
tions. 
Ying was a relentlessly active member of 
our community who found joy from his involve-
ment in several organizations including the 
Thomas Tang American Legion Post 50, the 
Chinese American Citizens Alliance, and the 
Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Compas-
sionate and kind-hearted, Ying found pleasure 
in life’s simplest gifts. From a dominoes game 
to a dim sum luncheon, he wove his infectious 
smile and kind nature into everything he did, 
bringing joy to all he met. 
Arizona owes a debt of gratitude to Ying for 
his invaluable contributions to our great nation. 
In this spirit of remembrance, we join Ying’s 
wife of 66 years, Catherine, and his family and 
loved ones to honor his legacy that will be felt 
for generations to come. 
I thank Ying for his service, and Godspeed.

RECOGNIZING PRESIDENT DR. 
MARY HINTON 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank President Dr. Mary Hinton for her 
service to the College of St. Benedict in St. 
Joseph. Dr. Hinton served as President of the 
college since 2014 and will shortly assume a 
new role as the 13th President of Hollins Uni-
versity in Virginia. 
Prior to her work at the College of St. Bene-
dict, President Hinton was a visiting faculty 
member for the University of Pennsylvania 
and Vice President for Planning and Assess-
ment at Mount St. Mary College. 
President Hinton has built her career around 
leading and inspiring young women. During 
her time at St. Ben’s, which enrolls 1,700 un-
dergraduate women, she helped raise $100 
million in funding and implemented $43 million 
in campus updates, providing our community 
with premier facilities for teaching, learning, 
and promoting women’s leadership. 
My staff and I have greatly enjoyed working 
with President Hinton over the past six years, 
and we are grateful for her work on behalf of 
her students and our community. 
We were especially grateful to have her as 
a panelist on my first ever Young Women’s 
Leadership Program in 2015. She shared her 
time and insights with young women from Min-
nesota’s Sixth District and inspired us all. 
Congratulations to President Hinton on this 
exciting new role. I thank her for all she has 
done for our community. Minnesota will miss 
her.

HONORING RETIRED LIEUTENANT 
COMMANDER WILLIAM DC JONES 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to honor retired Lieutenant 
Commander William DC Jones of Temple, 
Texas as he celebrates his 100th birthday on 
December 11. In his century of living, LTC 
Jones has exemplified not only the best in 
service to his country, but to his community as 
well. 
His fearless support of our country’s inter-
ests abroad serves as a clear testament to his 
dedication to our great nation and to his com-
mitment to serving others. During WWII, the 
Korean War, and the Vietnam War, LTC 
Jones bravely served as a pilot, aerial ob-
server, and member of the Department of the 
Army Inspector General’s Office. His work did 
not go unnoticed as he earned many awards 
and decorations for his patriotism including the 
Legion of Merit, two Bronze Stars, and a Meri-
torious Service Medal. 
After retiring in Temple, the very place he 
grew up, LTC Jones continued to service his 
country and community through the Temple 
Golden K Kiwanis Club, the Temple Commu-
nity Concert Association, and civic organiza-
tions. His work speaks to the devoted and 
generous spirit of a man who puts the needs 
of others before those of himself. 
I join LTC Jones’ friends and family in ap-
plauding the work he has done and service he 
continues to provide. I wish him the happiest 
of birthdays and nothing but health and pros-
perity in the years ahead.

IN HONOR OF WAYNE LEE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Wayne Lee as he leaves the city 
council of Millbrae after serving nine years. He 
also served as Mayor for two terms in 2013– 
2014 and 2018–2019. Wayne began public 
service in Millbrae by serving on the planning 
commission for six years. 
Millbrae is a town of 23,000 located across 
the freeway from San Francisco International 
Airport. Its steep hillsides hold lush trees and 
capture the morning fog as it spills in from the 
Pacific Ocean. The city boasts outstanding 
schools that attract families from throughout 
the region. People also move to Millbrae to 
partake in youth sports and numerous annual 
festivals. These new residents mix easily with 
longtime residents and both create a vibrant 
civic life. 
Wayne Lee began public service in Millbrae 
as an adult, but he was no stranger to helping 
the public. At the age of 13, he joined the civil 
air patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air 
Force, and ultimately rose to the rank of Lt. 
Colonel. While living in the nearby community 
of Pacifica, he was appointed to the youth 
commission and worked hard to create the 
Pacifica Youth Center. 
After outstanding work as a student at City 
College in San Francisco, Wayne graduated 
with a bachelor’s in chemical engineering from 
the University of California at Berkeley. He 
then began his career as an environmental 
engineer in both the public and private sec-
tors. His goal was to assist companies in the 
avoidance of environmental pollution. He was 
very successful and retired after 28 years in 
the field. 
As a father to Nicholas, Wayne was very 
active in Millbrae schools. He is the founding 
President of the Millbrae Education Founda-
tion and was President of the PTA and active 
on the school site council. He organized the 
Millbrae Dog Park committee that eventually 
led to the creation of a special place where 
dogs can bring their humans so that these hu-
mans can be relieved of pandemic-induced 
boredom. Numerous sightings of smiles peek-
ing out from under masks confirm that humans 
have benefitted immensely from Wayne’s 
work. He is also an active member of the 
Millbrae Lion’s Club and helped to supervise 
the Leos, a youth affiliate. 
As a city councilmember, Wayne’s priorities 
include the promotion of the city’s business cli-
mate and youth-oriented programs. He is also 
deeply involved in promoting the city’s public 
works projects, and housing is a significant 
priority for Wayne. He sincerely believes the 
city should do more to create housing for all 
income groups. 
Wayne’s work influences our region via his 
positions on the Executive Boards of the As-
sociation of Bay Area Governments, Peninsula 
Clean Energy, and the Asian Pacific Islanders 
Caucus. He is also a mentor to future civic 
leaders. 
Millbrae will lose one of its biggest boosters 
when Wayne Lee leaves public life. He is 
deeply committed to ensuring that his city is 
diverse and a welcoming community for young 
and old alike. When the time comes to select 
a mascot for Millbrae, I’d nominate Wayne’s 
smile. It signifies everything that is good about 
the city and announces that friendship is just 
a moment away for anyone who wishes to 
make this community on the Peninsula a bet-
ter place for all. We all wish Wayne Lee a 
wonderful future in this remarkable city next to 
San Francisco Bay. It has been an honor to 
serve with him.

Rohnert Park in celebration of his twelve years 
serving on the Rohnert Park City Council. 
Joseph Callinan was born in Rohnert Park, 
Sonoma County, California and is a lifelong 
resident of the city. In 2008, he was elected to 
city council and has served three terms. 
Callinan first became mayor in 2013, and 
served as vice mayor in 2019, before his cur-
rent appointment. Apart from serving his com-
munity as a member of the city council and as 
mayor, Mr. Callinan also owns a successful 
construction company that operates through-
out Sonoma, Napa and Marin counties. 
As mayor, Callinan supported investments 
to update city infrastructure. This included re-
paving the roads and a testament to Callinan’s 
commitment to public safety, the construction 
of a new fire station. He helped foster a great-
er sense of community by voting to approve a 
new downtown for Rohnert Park, to create a 
vibrant public gathering place, and two new 
parks, Maurice Fredericks Park and Five 
Creek Park. 
Most notably, Mayor Callinan addressed the 
increased demand for more affordable housing 
during his years in public service. Multiple 
housing projects have begun construction dur-
ing his time in office, with many of them aimed 
at low-income families and seniors. The most 
recent of these are the WillowGlen Neighbor-
hood and The Redwoods at University District. 
In addition, Callinan advocated for the continu-
ation of homebuilding in Rohnert Park during 
the COVID–19 pandemic to help alleviate the 
ongoing housing crisis as many projects were 
halted mid-build. 
Madam Speaker, Joseph T. Callinan has 
lived in Rohnert Park for 60 years. His love 
and dedication for his community is evident by 
his tenure on the city council and as mayor. It 
is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today.

HONORING THE LIVES OF ADORA 
PREVOST 
RAGSDALE 
AND 
GEORGE ROBINSON RAGSDALE 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the lives of Adora 
Prevost Ragsdale and George Robinson 
Ragsdale. 
Dody, as her family lovingly called her, was 
born in Waynesville, North Carolina on May 
31, 1939. The eldest of John Aaron and Adora 
Holtzclaw Prevost, she attended Waynesville 
High School and Sweet Briar College. She 
was elected President of her college class, 
and was an alumna of the Chi Omega Sorority 
where she also served as President. She 
graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts in 
History. 
Dody adored the Appalachian Mountains in 
her youth and loved them throughout her life. 
Her husband, George Ragsdale, graduated 
with honors in 1954 from Georgetown Pre-
paratory School and then entered the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he 
graduated in 1958. An active student leader, 
he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon Fra-
ternity, the Order of the Golden Fleece, The 
Order of the Grail and was Chairman of the 
Men’s Honor Council. He was elected Presi-
dent of the Senior Class and Permanent 
President of the Class of 1958. 
Madam Speaker, George then went on to 
graduate from UNC Law School in 1961. He 
spent a year in Washington, D.C., as Assistant 
Chief Counsel of the United States Sub-
committee on Constitutional Rights for the 
Chairman at the time, Senator Sam J. Ervin, 
Jr. It was in Washington where he met his 
wife ‘‘Dody’’ Prevost. 
And on October 20, 1962 Dody and George 
married on what was described as a ‘‘brilliant 
October morning.’’ 
The couple moved back to North Carolina 
where George entered private practice in Ra-
leigh. And upon the election of Governor Dan 
Moore, George was named Legal Counsel to 
the Governor. And then, in 1968, Governor 
Moore appointed him to the Bench as a Spe-
cial Judge of the Superior Court of North 
Carolina, then one of the youngest such 
Judges in the State’s history. 
Dody championed and pushed countless 
causes including a fine understanding of the 
Arts, serving as the Board President for the 
North Carolina Symphony, and being a found-
ing member of the American Dance Festival. 
And in her tireless spirit, Dody held multiple 
positions in her community, including with the 
Rex Hospital Guild and serving as President 
of the Capital City Garden Club. 
George went on to found his own firm, 
Ragsdale Liggett, with his good friend Frank 
Liggett in 1972. During his long legal career, 
George served on the Boards of Directors of 
a number of publicly traded companies. 
Madam Speaker, George then went on to 
be elected to the Board of Trustees of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1979 
and then served as Chairman between 1984 
and 1985. 
Inspired by their deep Christian faith and 
devotion to God, Dody and George Ragsdale 
were founding members of Holy Trinity Angli-
can Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
Sadly, Dody Ragsdale passed away on 
June 19th earlier this year. And her loving 
husband George passed on August 12th. 
They will be missed by their friends, their fam-
ily, and their community. 
My deepest and warmest sympathies and 
condolences are with the entire Ragsdale 
Family in this difficult time.

HONORING COUNCILMEMBER 
CYNTHIA MATHEWS 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Cynthia Mathews, the retiring City 
Councilmember and former Mayor of the City 
of Santa Cruz, California, for her commitment 
to serving the people of the central coast of 
California. 
It is my honor to recognize her as she fin-
ishes her final term serving the City of Santa 
Cruz as the longest serving member of the 
City Council. Her service of 24 years has ben-
efited countless residents of the City of Santa 
Cruz and is an achievement that few elected 
officials experience. 
Councilmember Mathew’s mark can be seen 
in the City of Santa Cruz’s protection of its his-
toric buildings and architectural importance, 
the recovery of the Downtown after the Loma 
Prieta earthquake, and the protection of the 
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. She 
has been a leader on the Santa Cruz County 
Democratic Central Committee and led efforts 
to pass revenue measures supporting Santa 
Cruz City Schools, the Santa Cruz Public Li-
brary system and City of Santa Cruz Parks 
and Recreation programs. 
The community of Santa Cruz has been well 
served by her dedication to neighborhoods, 
economic development, housing, social equity 
and social services, and public safety. Public 
service is a demanding commitment, and she 
has served with grace, intelligence and deter-
mination. Her service will certainly inspire fu-
ture leaders on the Central Coast. 
As she begins her retirement, I have no 
doubt that Cynthia will continue to serve her 
community. We, on the Central Coast, are 
grateful for her contributions to our community 
and celebrate her successful career.

HONORING THE U.S.-JAPAN ALLI-
ANCE 
AND 
CELEBRATING 
OUR 
JAPANESE 
AMERICAN 
COMMU-
NITY 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the alliance between the United States 
and Japan and celebrate the extraordinary 
contributions of Japanese Americans across 
our country, especially in my home state of 
Hawaii. 
Seventy-five years ago, the Second World 
War finally ended when Japanese and Allied 
representatives signed the Instrument of Sur-
render on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri, the 
storied battleship that now rests in Pearl Har-
bor in my district. Three generations hence, 
Japan has become a crucial ally, economic 
power and trading partner to the United States 
and built a dynamic democratic society and vi-
brant popular culture. Our two countries and 
peoples stand united as anchors of peace, 
prosperity and the liberal international order in 
the Indo-Pacific region. 
On November 18, 2020, the House unani-
mously passed H. Res. 349, reaffirming the 
vital role of the United States-Japan alliance in 
promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the 
Indo-Pacific region and beyond, a resolution 
that I also proudly cosponsored. Amidst this 
COVID–19 pandemic, renewed great power 
competition and a world in flux, the alliance 
and friendship between the United States and 
Japan remains a pillar of stability. Whatever 
challenges lie ahead, I am confident that our 
two countries will stand together and over-
come them. 
The memory of World War II also evokes 
one of the most shameful periods of our his-
tory as a country: the mass internment of Jap-
anese Americans. Through Executive Order 
9066 and other orders, the federal government 
forcibly relocated and incarcerated about 
120,000 Japanese Americans, the majority of 
whom were U.S. citizens, in concentration 
camps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1111 
December 8, 2020 
The year 2020 marks 40 years since the ap-
pointment of the Commission on Wartime Re-
location and Internment of Civilians by Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter in 1980. That Commis-
sion’s report, entitled Personal Justice Denied, 
affirmed what we already knew: that the mass 
internment of Japanese Americans was the 
product of racism and not driven by any actual 
national security risk. In 1988, Congress 
passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed 
into law, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which 
formally apologized and established restitution 
for the internment of Japanese Americans. 
Yet from this dark period in our history 
emerged great acts of courage and patriotism 
that helped make our country a more perfect 
union. Just months after President Roosevelt 
issued Executive Order 9066, thousands of 
Japanese Americans volunteered to join the 
war effort to join their comrades who had 
served earlier in the Hawaii National Guard, 
leading to formation of the 100th Infantry Bat-
talion and the 442nd Regimental Combat 
Team, later combined. Nicknamed the ‘‘Purple 
Heart Battalion,’’ the 100th/442nd became the 
single-most decorated unit of its size in U.S. 
military history. Thousands more Japanese 
Americans served in the all-Japanese Amer-
ican 552nd Field Artillery Battalion and Japa-
nese American Unit of the Military Intelligence 
Service. 
Last year, I had the honor of traveling to the 
town of Bruye`res, France, liberated by the 
100th/442nd in the fall of 1944 at terrible cost, 
to represent our Congress at the 75th anniver-
sary of liberation. There, I was moved by the 
powerful memory of these Japanese American 
soldiers, which included my wife’s uncle, PFC 
Sadao Hikida, their courage and ferocity in 
freeing this town from Nazi oppression and 
rescuing the ‘‘Lost Battalion’’ and the enduring 
friendships they built with the people of 
Bruye`res. 
In Bruye`res, I also recounted the personal 
impact that two veterans of the 100th/442nd 
had on my own life and career. It was Journey 
to Washington, the memoir of Medal of Honor 
recipient and U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, 
that first inspired me to consider a career in 
elected office. After graduating from college, I 
worked three years for Congressman (and 
later Senator) Spark Matsunaga, another vet-
eran of the 100th/442nd, who has served as 
a lifetime role model for me and so many oth-
ers. 
The courage and patriotism of Japanese 
Americans also extended to the home front. 
Japanese American citizens fought against the 
injustice of Executive Order 9066 and chal-
lenged it in court, leading to the infamous 
Korematsu v. United States decision. That de-
cision was only recently reversed by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
In the decades since, Japanese Americans 
have accomplished so much and contributed 
so greatly to our country through their service 
and achievements in government, the military, 
science and technology, arts and culture, busi-
ness and more. I especially recognize the Jap-
anese Americans of Hawaii who help make 
our home state the wonderfully rich and di-
verse place it is. 
I am proud to join my colleagues in this 
House in recognizing the U.S.-Japan alliance 
and commit myself to continued support for 
the historic friendship and amity between our 
peoples. And I am equally proud to represent 
and support the descendants of all those who 
came to this country from Japan in search of 
a better life, retaining the best of the rich cul-
tural heritage of their ancestral country in gen-
erations of contribution and achievement 
since.

HONORING COUNCILMEMBER GINA 
BELFORTE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Rohnert Park 
City Councilmember Gina Belforte for more 
than a decade of service to our community. As 
we mark her retirement, it is important to rec-
ognize her contributions to the City of Rohnert 
Park and the greater North Bay. 
Councilmember Belforte was first elected in 
2008 and has served three terms with honor 
and integrity, including terms as mayor and 
vice mayor. Throughout her years in office, 
she has worked hard to stabilize the city budg-
et while maintaining essential services, and 
has always strived to give a voice to the 
underrepresented. She has also been a re-
gional leader as the Sonoma County ap-
pointee to the Golden Gate Bridge Highway 
and Transportation District and as a member 
of the Sonoma Clean Power Board of Direc-
tors. Through her passion and commitment, 
Councilmember Belforte has ensured a strong-
er, brighter future for Rohnert Park and our 
greater community. 
Aside from her noteworthy record as a pub-
lic servant, Councilmember Belforte is a well- 
regarded business leader. In recognition of her 
success in the face of barriers that exist for 
woman-owned enterprises, she was awarded 
the Women’s Initiative for Self-Employment 
Woman Entrepreneur of the of the Year award 
in 2010. Using her business acumen for chari-
table causes, she has also served with distinc-
tion as the President of both Sonoma County 
Adult and Youth Development and the Rotary 
Club of Rohnert Park—Cotati. Although she is 
retiring from public service, her impact on our 
community will continue. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Councilmember 
Gina 
Belforte is an exceptional public servant, a

IN RECOGNITION OF RANKING 
MEMBER GREG WALDEN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my friend and colleague, 
Ranking Member GREG WALDEN, as he begins 
a new chapter in his life. 
For two decades, GREG served a community 
that he loved with his whole heart. He saw his 
constituents as more than the people who en-
trusted him with this job, but as family and 
friends who needed their voices heard in 
Washington. 
It wasn’t always easy. Long weeks away 
from family never are. But GREG kept taking 
those six hour flights from coast to coast be-
cause he loved the work and he was com-
mitted to the causes that brought him here in 
the first place. 
And as he rose through the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, he grew close to both 
me and my husband, John. 
There have certainly been a fair share of 
spirited debates over policies that we are both 
passionate about. But the moments spent 
agreeing on legislation that was signed into 
law and impacts our constituents today are the 
memories I’ll always cherish. 
Though we will miss GREG in 2123 Rayburn, 
we are all excited for what his future holds. 
Hope to see my friend again soon.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUSTUS 
MURRAY AMMONS 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of Justus 
Murray Ammons. 
Jud Ammons grew up on a farm in Western 
North Carolina, where sharecropping and 
plowing gardens shaped what he called his 
‘‘country boy’’ work ethic. At N.C. State, he 
dabbled in his first entrepreneurial pursuits, in-
cluding selling books, starting a laundry pickup 
business and working as an engineer for the 
State of North Carolina, all on top of college 
classes. He also met his wife, JoEllen and 
they were married in 1957 in Monroe, North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, Jud and JoEllen spent 
their early married years traveling the world 
while Jud served in the U.S. Air Force and 
then worked as department head with CP&L. 
In the mid-1960s, the Ammons settled in Ra-
leigh, North Carolina where Jud founded 
Ammons Construction Company. As a real es-
tate developer, Jud built, owned and operated 
major subdivisions, day care facilities, golf 
course communities, industrial parks, retire-
ment communities and shopping centers from 
the mountains to the coast. He sincerely cared 
about what he was doing and about the peo-
ple he was building for, no matter the project. 
Jud was a savvy businessman, although he 
claimed it was ‘‘common sense.’’ Encouraged 
by seniors in his church Jud developed 
Springmoor Retirement Community in North 
Raleigh. The community is the cornerstone of 
Greystone and pioneered the concept of a 
planned 
urban 
development 
incorporating 
amenities that allow residents to live, work, 
play, worship and go to school in a cohesive 
community. In 2000, he wrote a book named 
for his life motto, ‘‘Don’t Wish You Had, Be 
Glad You Did.’’ 
Decades ago, Jud coached basketball, soc-
cer and football; more recently, he kept a list 
of grandchildren’s sports and activities sched-
ules in his back pocket, filling nights and 
weekends to the brim to make it to as many 
games, recitals and performances as possible. 
Always driven by the desire to meet the 
needs of the people of Raleigh, Jud served in 
leadership on the Wake County Planning 
Commission, Raleigh Greenway Commission, 
Raleigh City Task Force and Raleigh Bicen-
tennial Commission. He was president and 
board member of the Raleigh-Wake County 
Home Builders Association and director of the 
National Association of Home Builders. In 
2011, he was inducted into the Raleigh Hall of 
Fame. 
He 
and 
JoEllen 
helped 
found 
Greystone Baptist Church, where he served 
as deacon, Sunday School teacher and trust-
ee. He served on several legislative study 
commissions, as a member of the Raleigh vol-
unteer fire department and as a trustee of 
Mars Hill College in his hometown. Jud also 
loved raising champion beagles and was in-
ducted into the Brace Beagling Hall of Fame. 
Jud was quick to tell a joke and a story, 
usually using his own dictionary of ‘‘Jud-isms.’’ 
A respected developer and businessman, he 
believed in dreaming big, working hard, and 
taking risks. But most of all, he loved God and 
his family, including his late wife, JoEllen, their 
four children and their 13 grandchildren. 
Sadly, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Jud 
Ammons 
passed away this year on October 18, 2020. 
He was 85 years old. He will be missed by his 
friends, neighbors, family, and the entire com-
munity.

IN HONOR OF LARRY MOODY 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Larry Moody as he concludes his 
service on the city council of East Palo Alto, 
and after 14 years of service to the community 
as both a trustee of the school district and 
councilmember. 
Larry grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, and 
was the youngest of eight children. He was 
an.enterprising young man rising early to de-
liver the Hartford Courant newspaper and later 
becoming student body president at his high 
school in both his junior and senior years. He 
lettered in three sports and captained the New 
England Championship Basketball Team. He 
matriculated to Trinity College, with a major in 
political science, and later joined the U.S. Air 
Force. 
In 1993, he came to East Palo Alto and im-
mersed himself in ministry and youth sports. 
By 2006, as an established leader, he ran for 
the school board and was elected. He and 
other trustees immediately concluded that 
progress evaluations would include everyone, 
not just the students. That year, the district 
had the highest gain in achievement scores in 
its history. Larry also brought Menlo Park 
Presbyterian Church into the Ravenswood 
Education 
Foundation 
and 
contributions 
soared. 
In 2012, he ran for the city council. The city 
is a diverse community in the heart of Silicon 
Valley fill with an extremely hard-working pop-
ulation. Median household income is about 50 
percent of San Mateo County’s. The city’s tax 
base supports a police department, community 
development, public works and other activities 
but there is no formal parks and recreation de-
partment. Violence within the community 
needed to be curbed. Larry wanted his city to 
offer the kinds of safety and services routinely 
provided to residents of surrounding commu-
nities. Developing the tax base was critical. 
To overcome a development moratorium, 
Councilman Moody spearheaded a critical ef-
fort to obtain water from two neighboring com-
munities. To curb violence, he supported, 
among many efforts, community-based organi-
zations to reach out to areas in town that were 
hotspots, a domestic violence program at the 
police department, and increasing the number 
and pay of the city’s hard-pressed police 
force. Crime trended sharply downward. As 
the city became safer, major employers no-
ticed. For example, Amazon established a 
large facility in the community, annually con-
tributing nearly $500,000 in property taxes to 
the city’s general fund. Steady increases in all 
tax revenues meant that a dream of Larry’s, 
summer youth programs, commenced. Youth 
development 
programs, 
including 
those 
through former President Obama’s My Broth-
er’s Keeper program, are a high priority for 
Larry. 
Housing remains a major challenge. As a 
councilmember, Larry supported the establish-
ment of the local homeless shelter, Project 
WeHope, the creation of a recreational vehicle 
parking program, the development of hun-
dreds of new units on city-owned lands and at 
the site of existing affordable housing. Some 
of these projects happened in part because he 
and his council colleagues insisted that 
Facebook contribute $20 million to meet the 
community’s needs. 
When he learned that countywide money 
was available for senior housing, Larry led the 
city in securing those funds as a down pay-
ment on a project along University Avenue 
which was decades in the making. When 
$80,000 was identified for housing renovation 
purposes, Larry and a local non-profit leader 
developed a program of weatherization of 
apartments for low-income residents. 
As he often says, capital improvements are 
not sexy, but they are needed. While on the 
council, he strongly supported the creation of 
a pedestrian/bike bridge over Highway 101, 
linking west side residents to the city’s grocery 
and shopping areas on the east side. New 
storm water pipes down Bay Road and new 
wells for drinking water began during his coun-
cil service. 
Larry Moody led other council members re-
gionally as the President of the Peninsula 
Chapter of the League of California Cities, and 
served on the statewide organization’s com-
mittee on parks and recreation. At my request,

he graciously agreed to serve on a regional 
body that made important recommendations to 
the FAA regarding intrusive noise impacts on 
East Palo Alto and surrounding communities. 
Madam Speaker, we know Larry Moody as 
a coach, community leader, elected leader, 
and booster of all things East Palo Alto but, ul-
timately, we know him as a man with 
unbounded faith in the potential of human 
beings. Give this man a single ray of hope for 
the future and he produces a blinding day of 
possibilities. 
As he steps down from the city council, his 
wife Lisa, their four sons Larry Jr., Tyler, Isiah 
and Cameron, will once again have Larry 
home each night. We thank them for their pa-
tience as he served, but their gain is our loss. 
Let us salute Larry Moody for his service to us 
all. He will long be remembered as the man 
who led with a smile and an enormous heart.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF URIEL 
PADGETT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Uriel Burton 
Padgett. As a fellow service member, I am 
grateful for Mr. Padgett’s dedication to family, 
state, and country. 
Uriel Padgett was born October 7, 1934 in 
Magee, MS to Luke and Novice Kennedy. He 
was married to Mattie Lee Midleton Padgett 
for 65 years and together the two had two 
children, five grandchildren, and ten great 
grandchildren. 
In March of 1952, Uriel joined the Mis-
sissippi National Guard. He served in many 
positions throughout his career and served as 
a founding member of the Special Forces Unit 
in the Mississippi Guard. His first NCOS class 
was in Mississippi and he went on to instruct 
the course. Uriel deeply enjoyed his time at 
Camp Shelby before retiring in 1989 as the 
Assistant United States Property and Fiscal 
Officer and was later promoted to Brigadier 
General. 
Uriel spent his retirement travelling with his 
wife, learning woodworking, and attending arts 
and crafts shows. He was an active member 
of the Exchange Club of West Jackson, 
Rankin County Civitan Club, Oak Hill Lodge, 
and the American Legion. He was a dedicated 
charter member of Brandon Baptist Church. 
Uriel loved music and spending time outdoors. 
He played many instruments and could be 
found in his garden or riding his tractor. 
Mr. Padgett is survived by his wife, Mattie 
Lee Middleton Padgett; children, Steve and 
Deborah; grandchildren, Greg, Alisha, Jana, 
and Ashley; and ten great-grandchildren. 
Uriel Padgett was a dedicated husband and 
father, a servant to his state, and a man of 
faith. He will be deeply missed by all who had 
the opportunity to know and love him. 
INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
TRANS-
ATLANTIC 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS SECURITY ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
introduct the bipartisan Transatlantic Tele-
communications Security Act. I am grateful to 
my colleague ADAM KINZINGER of Illinois for his 
partnership in co-leading this critically needed 
piece of legislation. 
The United States and our allies face down 
increased threats from global actors like a ris-
ing China and belligerent Russia that seek to 
export their malign influence and undermine 
democratic institutions. 
China seeks to compromise allied critical 
telecommunications infrastructure by using 
statelinked companies like Huawei and ZTE to 
unfairly induce our allies to procure insecure 
fifth generation telecommunications equipment 
and services. 
Bipartisan current and former U.S. officials 
and civil society members have recognized 
the threat of malign influence over critical tele-
communications networks. 50 networks will 
serve as the backbone of artificial intelligence 
platforms with immense national security and 
domestic economic implications. Secure tele-
communications are also critical for military 
interoperability with our European allies at a 
time when NATO coordination is needed now 
more than ever. 
Given these critical national security needs, 
the United States must provide our allies alter-
natives to Chinese financing and provide in-
creased diplomatic support to our allies to en-
sure secure telecommunications lines. 
This legislation would authorize the U.S. De-
velopment Finance Corporation to provide fi-
nancing for cross-border 5G telecommuni-
cations infrastructure development to our al-
lies. This financing is key to remove risky and 
threatening equipment and replace it with se-
cure equipment. The legislation seeks to in-
crease resilience in countries in the region 
whose infrastructure deficit from the Soviet-era 
makes them especially vulnerable to malign 
Chinese influence, including among nations in 
the Three Seas Initiative. 
Additionally, this bill directs the Secretary of 
State and other relevant agency heads to 
prioritize diplomacy and project support with 
European allies and partners to develop 5G 
markets that are inclusive, transparent, eco-
nomically viable, socially sustainable, and 
compliant with international law. Finally, this 
legislation ensures the United States is lead-
ing with our European allies to develop inter-
national 5G standards that favor democratic 
institutions, not further authoritarianism spread 
by China and Russia. 
Following unanimous House passage of H. 
Res. 672 supporting the Three Seas Initiative 
and the enactment of the bipartisan European 
Energy Security and Diversification Act, this 
bill is the next critically needed step for Con-
gress to secure our transatlantic allies and 
partners from malign influence. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this crit-
ical legislation. 
HONORING MAYOR ROY 
SWEARINGEN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Roy 
Swearingen, and to celebrate his over 16 
years of public service to the City of Pinole. 
Mayor Swearingen has been a resident of 
Pinole for over 40 years. He began his career 
in construction and eventually owned his own 
small business. He is a dedicated public serv-
ant, having spent 16 years on the Pinole City 
Council, leading the Council as Mayor for five 
of those years. He has also served on the 
Pinole Chamber of Commerce for six years, 
including two years as president. 
Drawing upon his many years in business, 
Mayor Swearingen has helped guide the City 
of Pinole through many challenges and hard-
ships. His leadership during the 2008 reces-
sion, including steering the effort to create a 
balanced budget, was vital to the City of 
Pinole’s 
economic 
recovery. 
Mayor 
Swearingen’s business acumen was indispen-
sable in guiding the recent upgrade to the 
Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant, 
which will help keep our oceans clean and will 
benefit the community for generations to 
come. 
Mayor Swearingen’s dedication to his com-
munity extends beyond the roles that he has 
served in office. He is a highly involved mem-
ber of the Pinole Rotary Club and the West 
Contra Costa Police Activities League, having 
served as president of both organizations. 
Though he is retiring from the City Council, 
Mayor Swearingen will continue to serve his 
community as the Treasurer of the City of 
Pinole. His leadership and expertise will surely 
be an asset in the coming years. 
Madam Speaker, Mayor Roy Swearingen’s 
integrity and continued dedication to public 
service is an inspiration to us all. It is therefore 
fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

RECOGNIZING 155TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 13TH AMENDMENT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my fel-
low Congressional Black Caucus members for 
coming together this evening to recognize and 
acknowledge the 155th anniversary of the rati-
fication of the 13th Amendment to the United 
States Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, 1865 was certainly a turning 
point in the history of our nation, with the end 
of the Civil War and the assassination of one 
of our greatest presidents, Abraham Lincoln. 
But the ideal over which the Civil War was 
fought and President Lincoln died was not ful-
filled until late in that year—155 years ago 
yesterday, in fact. 
When Georgia became the 27th state to rat-
ify the 13th Amendment, on December 6, 
1865, our country formally put an end to the 
practice of chattel slavery in this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1114 
December 8, 2020 
In the following years, Congress and the 
states added to the Reconstruction Era Civil 
Rights Amendments, with the 14th Amend-
ment in 1868, providing for equal protection 
and due process, and the 15th Amendment in 
1870, guaranteeing the right to vote regard-
less of race. 
These constitutional amendments were ab-
solutely critical in our pursuit of a more perfect 
union where all men, and women, are created 
equal. 
In the first four-score-and-9 years of our Re-
public, slavery was allowed and, indeed, en-
shrined in our Constitution. 
While that changed with the 13th Amend-
ment, over the last 155 years, we have still 
had to struggle for true equality. 
The 13th Amendment may have ended slav-
ery, but it did not stop the Black Codes or Jim 
Crow. 
The 14th Amendment promised equal pro-
tection, but it didn’t prevent 100 years of seg-
regation. 
The 15th Amendment says that the right to 
vote shall not be denied or abridged, but it 
hasn’t kept tens, if not hundreds, of thousands 
of people of color from being disenfranchised 
at the hands of voter suppression tactics. 
That is why I think it is so important that we 
do things like this—come together to talk 
about our history and the steps we need to 
take to complete the work. 
Despite the progress over the years, we 
have not yet solved the problem of systemic 
racism. 
We have work yet to do to make sure that 
a child’s future isn’t determined by her zip 
code; to overcome disparities in our health 
care system that have been exacerbated by a 
global pandemic; to prevent innocent Black 
men from being killed in the street. 
As we approach another milestone—the 
50th Anniversary of the creation of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus—I am proud to join 
with my colleagues in the CBC to do that hard 
work, and to finally ratify the 13th Amendment, 
not just in law, but in truth.

RECOGNIZING 2020 TRUMAN 
SCHOLAR VALERIE DOZE 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Valerie Doze, a student at the 
College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph on re-
ceiving the Truman Scholarship. 
The Truman Foundation was established by 
Congress in 1975 to honor President Harry S. 
Truman’s legacy of extraordinary public serv-
ice. The Truman Scholarship serves as a liv-
ing monument to that legacy. 
Each year, a diverse group of scholars re-
ceive $30,000 to pursue graduate studies and 
are granted priority placement at our nation’s 
top universities, as well as internships within 
the federal government. 
Valerie is one of 62 in the 2020 class of 
Truman Scholars, having distinguished herself 
in a pool of nearly 800 candidates nominated 
by 316 colleges and universities across the 
country. Valerie will serve as the North Dakota 
Truman Scholar. 
Congratulations to Valerie on this incredible 
honor, and we look forward to seeing all that 
she accomplishes.

to recognize high school junior Jamie O’Keefe 
as the winner of the 2020 Congressional App 
Challenge in New Hampshire’s First Congres-
sional District. 
Using JavaScript and C Sharp, Jamie cre-
ated ‘‘Augrnentia,’’ a physics-based aug-
mented reality app where users can test the 
structural and design viability of a variety of 
objects: anything from a piece of furniture to a 
3–D model of a skull. ‘‘Augmentia’’ was se-
lected for its practicality, creativity, and 
versatility across all its functions. 
Jamie is a student at Exeter High School in 
Exeter, New Hampshire and has been coding 
since he was in the fifth grade. Upon grad-
uating high school, he intends to pursue a 
bachelor’s degree in computer science and 
has expressed particular interest in artificial in-
telligence and machine learning. My office is 
proud to support continued investments in 
STEM education so that all Granite Staters 
can have the opportunity to explore STEM and

late Jamie on his terrific achievement. I am 
proud to showcase his work as a phenomenal 
product of STEM education in our district and 
wish him all my best in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
RUSSELL CAPPS 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of James 
Russell Capps. 
Russell Capps was born in Raleigh, North 
Carolina on February 26, 1931. He attended 
Murphy Elementary School and Hugh Morson 
High School in the Oakwood neighborhood of 
Raleigh. He graduated from the Radio/Tele-
vision Institute of Chicago and then from 
Wake Forest University in 1956 with a degree 
in Sociology. 
During the 1970s, Russell worked a position 
in radio and later television with WRAL News 
in Raleigh. Capps then went on to the South-
eastern Baptist Theological Seminary for three 
years and served as a volunteer pastor at a 
Baptist church. 
Madam Speaker, in the 1960s he attended 
the Institute of Government in Chapel Hill, 
North Carolina for a number of studies in local 
government administration and fire service. In 
1968, he served as the first Wake County 
Planning Director and later as the first director 
of Wake County Emergency Management and 
founded the Wake County Emergency Medical 
Services. 
Russell was then elected to the North Caro-
lina State House of Representatives in 1994 
and he served 6 terms in that body. 
For 22 years, Russell also served as Presi-
dent of the Tax Payers Association. He was a 
member of the Christian Action League of 
North Carolina for 40 years and he spent 
eighteen years as a department head in Wake 
County Government. Russell was also Fire 
Marshall of Wake County for seventeen years. 
He was a planner in the NC Department of 
Crime Control and Public Safety. He served 
as Wake County’s first Planning Director who 
helped develop and prepare the original Wake 
County Comprehensive Development Plan. 
Sadly, Madam Speaker, Russell Capps 
passed away this year on October 6, 2020. He 
was 89 years old. He will be missed by his 
friends, neighbors, family, and the entire com-
munity.

Town Democratic Committee. Over the years, 
I have been fortunate to know Mary both as a 
friend and an ally and remember the gracious 
welcome she gave me when I opened my 
flagship Congressional office in the Village of 
Huntington. As a staff person to former mem-
bers of Congress Gary Ackerman and Steve 
Israel, Mary spent many years advocating for 
the constituents of New York’s Third Congres-
sional District. She is admired by many and I 
join with them in wishing her the best as she 
moves on to the next chapter in her life. 
I include in the RECORD the following tribute 
to Mary that was prepared by the Huntington 
Town Democratic Committee: 
On the Occasion of the Retirement of Mary 
Collins as the Chairwoman of the Hun-
tington Town Democratic Committee, cele-
brating her 22nd anniversary as our beloved 
chair, we honor Mary for her excellence and 
service to the Huntington Community. We 
hereby recognize and acknowledge her ten-
ure in office by sharing some of her biog-
raphy and contributions. 
Mary has been a resident of the Town of 
Huntington since 1950. She moved here from 
East Hampton as a child at the age of 8 when 
her Father became the caretaker of the Mar-
shall Field Estate (now Caumsett State 
Park) where he was in charge of the stable of 
horses. 
Her family ties to East Hampton connected 
her to Eleanor’s Legacy by her relationship 
with Judith Hope who was the East Hampton 
Town Supervisor. Judith Started Eleanor’s 
Legacy. Mary brought Eleanor’s legacy to 
Huntington by appointing Sherry Pavone as 
head of the Woman’s Initiative. HTDC has 
supported Eleanor’s Legacy’s goal of sup-
porting women candidates throughout NY. 
Mary was a teacher by profession. She 
spent her career wholly within Syosset High 
School District. Mary’s area of expertise in 
teaching was Global studies. However, she 
became very interested in local politics on 
Long Island after observing her mother’s 
long service as a Board of Elections volun-
teer, registering voters and working through 
election times as far back as the 1950’s. 
Huntington at that time was a quasi-rural 
area with much farmland. 
Many Huntingtonians wanted to keep the 
character and nature of Huntington as it had

been before WWII. Huntington experienced 
rapid suburbanization with the development 
of Dix Hills/Melville, community groups such 
as House Beautiful and the development of 
the 110 Corridor. However, these changes 
came and our leaders had to wrestle with the 
issues surrounding this development. 
Early on, Mary was particularly interested 
in the corruption felt throughout Long Is-
land in the late 1950’s. She fondly remembers 
when Robert Flynn, attorney and longtime 
Huntington Democratic leader, joined with 
likeminded Republicans to form The Fusion 
Economy Party designed to combat such cor-
ruption with the goal to defeat institutional 
corruption. There were Democrats and Re-
publicans that ran on that line. 
Mary recalled a time when Committee peo-
ple were recruited, friend to friend, neighbor 
to neighbor. Her own mentor into the posi-
tion as Chair was Eunice Titcomb. Eunice 
taught Mary the day-to-day workings of the 
committee. 
Mary became more active in Huntington 
Democrats with her husband, the late Dick 
Tretler. They met Annie and Matt Berger 
around 1979 during Frank Grimes’ tenure as 
HTDC Chair and they all campaigned ac-
tively for Jane Devine’s successful run for 
County Legislature. In fact, she recalled that 
the reason she became a Notary Public was 
when Jane Devine was first running for of-
fice in order to carry Jane’s petitions. In 
those days you could not carry a petition 
outside your district unless you were a No-
tary Public. 
Annie Berger shares what she believes to 
be key to Mary’s success: her listening 
skills. She listened, she heard people, even if 
she would not commit to their position. This 
was echoed by every elected Democratic offi-
cial and leader past and present. 
We Recognize that under Mary Collin’s 
leadership, Huntington Democrats maintain 
a strong presence in Huntington. She made 
it a time to be proud to be a Democrat in 
Huntington and support our neighbors and 
friends in our community. Under Mary’s 
leadership, Huntington held the majority in 
the town for 18 years. 
Her integrity was always high and she put 
the Committee first. 
Frank Grimes, HTDC long time Chair 
asked Mary to be Vice Chair and she readily 
accepted helping to bring HTDC into the 21st 
century. Mary was the Vice Chair of Hun-
tington Town Democratic Committee for 6 
years. In 1998 she became the Chair holding 
that position until 2020 when she became 
Vice Chair for Western Suffolk of the Suffolk 
County Democratic Committee. She has al-
ways enjoyed reaching out to people, being 
available to provide the best advice and as-
sistance to every candidate, every Com-
mittee person, every constituent inquiry. 
Frank Petrone, our long time Town Super-
visor and now Committee Chair always found 
Mary welcoming, even though he was a Re-
publican at the beginning of his tenure as 
Town Supervisor. When Frank changed his 
own party affiliation, Mary continued to pro-
vide him with an orientation to our Com-
mittee and paved the way for his acceptance 
to the Committee. ‘‘She was, as ever, always 
gracious.’’ 
Mary worked for a long time as a Legisla-
tive Assistant to Congressman Gary Acker-
man whose district stretched from Queens to 
Smithtown, dealing with constituent issues, 
becoming well versed in local issues affect-
ing Huntington. 
Former Congressman Steve Israel recalls 
that he met Mary when he moved to Hun-
tington in the 1990’s. He recalls learning 
about her from his friend, Congressman Bob 
Mrazek. Her knowledge of Huntington poli-
tics, as Congressman Israel remembers, was 
a reason that he asked Mary to join him 
when he was first elected to Congress. Israel 
remembers that he was always amazed by 
her dedication to her neighbors, her insist-
ence that we were in politics not for power 
but to help those without it and her passion 
for improving communities. Congressman 
Israel is reminded, upon returning from 
Washington, walking into his local office 
feeling uplifted seeing Mary at the front 
desk helping constituents with their every-
day problems. 
As Chair, Mary not only kept up the day- 
to-day operations, she nurtured us all with 
her amazing Home baked goodies. If you 
haven’t tried her famous Irish Soda Bread, 
you are really missing out. Anyone coming 
to the office for GOTV work has enjoyed the 
extra benefit of sharing in a good cup of cof-
fee or tea and a delicious homebaked treat 
made with love. 
Ever the quintessential politico, Mary has 
always been able to straddle being essen-
tially apolitical in a very political position. 
The interaction with people, trying to im-
prove things for all Huntingtonians has al-
ways been her goal. And in her own words: 
‘‘Politics is the most fun people can have 
legally.’’

HONORING VICE MAYOR JAKE 
MACKENZIE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Vice Mayor 
Jake Mackenzie, and to celebrate his retire-
ment from the Rohnert Park City Council after 
24 years of storied service. 
Vice Mayor Mackenzie is an outstanding 
public servant, a committed environmentalist, 
and a tireless advocate for the Rohnert Park 
community. After earning his PhD in pesticide 
research in 1970, he spent three decades 
working as a pesticide regulator for both the 
State of California and the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency. He was first elected to the 
Rohnert Park City Council in 1996, running on 
a platform of natural land preservation in the 
city. He has served 24 years on the council, 
including 5 terms as Mayor. 
Throughout his time on the City Council, 
Vice Mayor Mackenzie has been a regional 
leader on environmental preservation and 
transportation issues. His environmental ex-
pertise has been instrumental in creating long- 
term sustainable growth in Sonoma County. 
While leading the North Coast Resource Part-
nership, Vice Mayor Mackenzie secured over 
$65 million in funding to protect Northern Cali-
fornia open spaces for future generations. He 
has been a fierce advocate of affordable hous-
ing and public transportation, serving on the 
board of the Metropolitan Transportation Au-
thority for 12 years, and the Sonoma County 
Transportation Authority for 20 years. He 
played a vital role in the development of the 
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit passenger 
train, an extremely important service that will 
benefit the entire region for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, Vice Mayor Jake Mac-
kenzie is an exceptional public servant with a 
deep dedication to his community. He exem-
plifies the integrity we should expect from our 
leaders, and he has undoubtedly had a signifi-
cant and lasting impact on the City of Rohnert 
Park. I am proud to call him a friend. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

HON. KEN CALVERT

Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I was un-

favor of H. Res. 512 and S. 461.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MR. 
TOM CARROLL 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate and offer gratitude to Mr. 
Tom Carroll. The Architect of the Capitol 
(AOC) is losing a valuable member of the 
Capitol Hill community with his forthcoming 
resignation on December 11, 2020. Tom has 
accepted an amazing opportunity to lead facil-
ity operations at Columbia University in New 
York City, and we wish him the best in his 
new endeavor. 
An engineer by trade and a respected U.S. 
Air Force veteran, Tom has been an indispen-
sable member of the Architect of the Capitol’s 
team since joining in 2009. He came on board 
first as Deputy Superintendent for House Of-
fice Buildings and quickly moved up to be-
come the Chief Financial Officer responsible 
for ensuring sound financial stewardship and 
providing value-added analysis to give insight 
into the financial implications of program deci-
sions. Tom was again promoted to Assistant 
to the Architect for Operations and Services in 
2018, and he had the honor of serving as the 
Acting Architect of the Capitol from August 
2019 to January 2020. Tom’s due diligence 
and leadership ensured hundreds of projects 
across the Capitol campus were delivered on- 
time, on-budget and with high quality. 
Tom’s hard work and contributions to Cap-
itol Hill will be greatly missed. Congress’ loss 
is Columbia’s gain.

HONORING CATHY HUGHES 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing Cathy Hughes on her 40 
years as the leader of Urban One, now Amer-
ica’s largest Black broadcast network. 
Cathy Hughes, the founder and chairperson 
of Urban One, has dedicated her career to 
amplifying the voices of Black people and their 
perspectives through the airwaves. Born in 
Omaha, Nebraska, and known to have hosted 
‘‘radio shows’’ in her bathroom as a child, 
Hughes had her sights on success from day

one. Throughout her career, her piercing opti-
mism and resilience cut through obstacles of 
discrimination and discouragement, clearing a 
path to where she now stands as one of our 
country’s wealthiest self-made African-Amer-
ican women. 
Hughes, who became a mother at the age 
of 16, has recalled taking her son to classes 
and, later on in her career, having him sleep 
in a sleeping bag in her office when she had 
to work late. Growing up among a family of 
entrepreneurs, as Hughes did, she was no 
stranger to hard work, business jargon and 
long hours. Her father was the first African- 
American to earn an accounting degree from 
Creighton University. Her mother played trom-
bone. 
In 1971, Hughes came to the District of Co-
lumbia to work at Howard University’s School 
of Communications, and she went on to be-
come a General Sales Manager for the Uni-
versity’s radio station, WHUR–FM. On her ar-
rival in the District, Hughes wrote to her moth-
er, ‘‘My eyes were tired at the end of the day, 
staring at the greatness of Black people doing 
so many things.’’ 
In the late 1970s, Hughes started her own 
radio station, once known as Radio One, now 
Urban One. During her career she endured 
racism and sexism, but these were no match 
for her electric optimism. After seven years, 
the radio station became profitable and contin-
ued to grow. In 1999, at the recommendation 
of her son, who had received his MBA at the 
Wharton School of the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Cathy Hughes became the first African- 
American woman to chair a publicly held cor-
poration, following the sale of more than 
seven million shares of common stock to the 
public. 
She has received numerous awards, includ-
ing being selected for the National Association 
of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2019, the 
Woman of the Year Award by 100 Black Men 
of America in 2018, the Ida B. Wells Living 
Legacy Award in 2011 and the Essence 
Women Shaping the World Award in 2008. 
She was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame 
in 2010, and the Cathy Hughes School of 
Communications at Howard University was 
named for her in 2016. 
I relish this opportunity to recognize and 
honor the work of Cathy Hughes. Her resil-
ience, optimism and determination are true 
guiding lights through these difficult times. She 
has mentored countless women and her entre-
preneurial energy has touched many, both in 
D.C. and across the nation. 
I ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments of 
Cathy Hughes on the occasion of the 40th an-
niversary of Urban One.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 
2981, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Commissioned Officer Corps 
Amendments Act of 2020. I was also proud to 
cosponsor the House companion to this bill— 
H.R. 2406—introduced by my colleagues, 
Representatives ED
CASE
of Hawaii, DON 
YOUNG of Alaska, and JARED HUFFMAN of Cali-
fornia. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration 
Commissioned 
Officer 
Corps 
(NOAA Corps) operates the agency’s highly 
specialized international fleet of research and 
survey ships and aircraft. They conduct 
oceanographic and atmospheric research and 
include the Hurricane Hunter aviators, who 
provide the National Weather Service with the 
necessary data for their storm forecasts and 
warnings. 
In Puerto Rico, we know how important this 
work is. For instance, before Hurricane Maria 
even departed our waters in September 2017, 
the NOAA Corps-led NOAA Ship Thomas Jef-
ferson became the first federal vessel on 
scene in relief efforts. Over the next 20 days, 
that ship and crew worked uninterrupted, 
around-the-clock shifts throughout Puerto Rico 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands, eventually clearing 
eighteen individual port facilities in thirteen 
areas. Seven of them were in Puerto Rico 
alone. 
That is why I support passage of S. 2981, 
which would give NOAA Corps the authorities 
it needs to continue as an effective service for 
our nation. The bill would provide its officers 
employment rights in line with other uniformed 
services, authorizes education loan repayment 
programs for NOAA Corps officers and tuition 
support for prospective officers, and gives 
NOAA updated authorities to manage the size 
and composition of the Corps, among other 
provisions. 
I look forward to continuing supporting the 
men and women of the NOAA Corps.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RONNIE S. 
WILLIAMS 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of Ronnie 
S. Williams. 
Madam Speaker, Ronnie Williams was es-
pecially proud of his service to his country. He 
graduated from Garner High School in 1966, 
attended Wake Community College then 
served in U.S. Army. He was deployed to Viet-
nam from 1969 to 1970. Williams was a mem-
ber of American Legion Post 232 and Garner 
VFW Post 10225. 
In addition to his military service, Williams 
was a former first responder. He was a volun-
teer both in the Garner Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment and in Garner EMS, serving as chief of 
the latter from 1980 to 1983. 
Madam Speaker, Ronnie Williams served on 
the Board of Aldermen for Garner, North Caro-
lina for 20 years before being elected Mayor 
of Garner, and serving in that role between 
2005 until December of last year. 
Under Ronnie’s nearly three decades of 
public service, Garner, North Carolina pros-
pered now includes over 30,000 residents out-
side of Raleigh. He also assumed roles of re-
gional and statewide leadership during his ten-
ure as mayor. He served as chair of the Wake 
County Mayors Association from 2007 to 2009 
and was selected to be an at-large member of 
the N.C. League of Municipalities’ Board of Di-
rectors 
Sadly, former Garner Mayor Ronnie S. Wil-
liams passed away on Saturday, September 
12, 2020 at the age of 72. 
His legacy as a devoted and dedicated pub-
lic servant will be missed by all of those who 
knew him.

IN HONOR OF LAURA DAVIS 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Laura Davis upon her retirement 
from the San Bruno City Council after three 
years of service. Serving on the council of a 
small city is never easy, but doing so during 
a global pandemic not seen in a century is al-
most unimaginable. Yet, Laura and her col-
leagues used and created tools and mecha-
nisms that made San Bruno residents as safe 
and supported as possible. Laura’s hard work 
and dedication are a testament to her commit-
ment to her community. 
While on the council, Laura served on the 
Utilities Committee, the Traffic Safety & Park-
ing Commission, the Bicycle Pedestrian Advi-
sory Committee, the Airport Land Use Com-
mittee, the Bay Area Water Supply & Con-
servation Agency and the Peninsula Traffic 
Congestion Relief Alliance. These complex 
issues require a lot of knowledge, research 
and consideration and Laura always took the 
time to do her homework. In her day job, 
Laura is the Customer Relations Manager at 
California Water Service company where she 
has worked for 20 years. She brought exten-
sive expertise on water issues to the council. 
Laura also served on the Recreation and 
Aquatics Center Advisory Committee which is 
tasked with supporting the construction of a 
new Recreation and Aquatics Center in San 
Bruno City Park. This project will be a tangible 
symbol of the community spirit of San Bruno 
residents. After the fatal and devastating ex-
plosion of a Pacific Gas & Electric Company 
gas pipeline in 2010, the community voted on 
how to best spend a restitution settlement with 
PG&E of $70 million. It was agreed that all 
residents of San Bruno should benefit from the 
settlement and a new pool was voted the 
highest priority. It is that spirit of resilience and 
solidarity that defines San Bruno’s character. 
Laura also isn’t a newcomer to public serv-
ice. Prior to the council, she served on the 
San Bruno Crime Prevention Committee and 
on the Parks & Recreation Commission. She 
served on the committee that planned the 
spectacular Centennial celebration of San 
Bruno in 2014, three years before being elect-
ed to the council. An avid outdoors and sports 
enthusiast, she has coached numerous soft-
ball, basketball and soccer teams in San 
Bruno. She founded ‘‘Friends Helping Friends’’ 
through 
St. 
Robert’s 
Parish 
and 
raised 
$100,000 to help those in need of medical 
treatment with their expenses. After Laura sur-
vived her own battle with cancer, she served 
as a committee member of a Relay for Life 
fundraiser and she organized a community

Superhero Day for two boys fighting cancer. It 
is obvious from these activities that Laura 
Davis deeply cares about others and has a 
profound desire to improve their lives. St. Rob-
ert’s Church named her Woman of the Year. 
Laura was born in San Francisco but raised 
in San Bruno. She worked in the family busi-
ness, Roma Delicatessen, which she credits 
with teaching her the importance of hard work, 
community and giving back. Laura graduated 
from Capuchino High School and then at-
tended the College of San Mateo and San 
Francisco State University. Before working for 
Cal Water, she was the General Manager for 
Palace Press International for 10 years. Laura 
has been married to her husband Jim Davis 
for 29 years. They have two children, Ryan 
and Sarah. 
Madam Speaker please join me in honoring 
Laura Davis for her service to San Bruno resi-
dents. We are very fortunate to have such a 
talented and caring woman as a community 
leader who will undoubtedly stay active and 
engaged.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
RADIO 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the very 
first commercial radio broadcast. From deliv-
ering lifesaving information during emer-
gencies to playing the music, sports, and 
news that keep us connected, our commu-
nities rely on broadcast radio. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Broad-
casters Caucus and a former radio show host, 
I know firsthand the power of local radio to 
connect, inform, and inspire all of us. 
The same wireless technology that brought 
us the results of the Harding-Cox presidential 
election in 1920 continues to keep us informed 
with critical information about the current out-
break, weather emergencies, and local news 
today. 
This outbreak has impacted all Americans in 
one way or another, and local radio stations 
continue to provide listeners with a valuable 
connection. Broadcasters are also leading the 
charge to collect donations for relief funds 
which support Americans in their time of need. 
I want to thank the thousands of local radio 
stations across the nation providing this in-
valuable service. I thank them for their dedica-
tion to radio, which will keep this critical infor-
mation service available to all Americans for 
the next 100 years.

HONORING COUNCILMAN PETER 
MURRAY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Councilman 
Peter Murray, and to celebrate his 31 years of 
public service to the City of Pinole. 
Councilman Murray’s dedication to his com-
munity is lifelong and enduring. His service to 
the City of Pinole began in 1989 when he 
joined the Pinole Planning Commission. In 
1992, he was elected to the Pinole City Coun-
cil, and went on to serve for seven terms, in-
cluding as Mayor of Pinole for seven separate 
years 
During his 28 years on the City Council, 
Councilman Murray has earned the respect 
and appreciation of the public, and has con-
sistently focused on bettering his community. 
His economic leadership was instrumental in 
bringing new businesses to the area, such as 
by revitalizing the Pinole Valley Shopping 
Center. Councilman Murray has also worked 
hard to improve public safety through growing 
Pinole’s Neighborhood Watch program and 
pursuing community-oriented policing prac-
tices. He played an important role in upgrad-
ing the Pinole-Hercules Water Pollution Con-
trol Plant, which will continue to protect our 
natural resources for decades to come. 
Councilman Murray’s leadership in his com-
munity goes beyond his duties as a City 
Councilman. Since 1997, he has coached 
local Little League and Youth Soccer teams 
and inspired countless young people with his 
integrity and dedication. He has also coordi-
nated the Annual Pinole Coastal Cleanup for 
many years, protecting our coastlines from 
pollution. 
Madam Speaker, Councilman Peter Murray 
is an outstanding public servant who has dedi-
cated his life to serving his community. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

CORONAVIRUS AID 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
call 
for 
the 
immediate 
passage 
of 
coronavirus relief for the American people. 
Members of Congress must not return home 
to their districts before a coronavirus package 
has been agreed upon and passed. 
The House passed the Heroes Act in the 
Spring, over six months ago, extending addi-
tional relief to American families struggling to 
put food on the table, pay their rent, keep their 
businesses afloat, and pay their student loans. 
The do nothing Republicans in the Senate 
have not only refused to vote on the Heroes 
Act, but they have refused to even put up a 
viable alternative that their members can ac-
cept. It’s shameful the Republican Majority in 
the Senate would rather confirm President 
Trump’s lame-duck political appointees and 
judges than offer even a modest measure of 
coronavirus support to American workers and 
struggling 
families. 
Meanwhile, 
President 
Trump has provided zero leadership. 
Madam Speaker, the coronavirus is infecting 
more people now than at any other time in the 
last year. We stand on the face of a precipice 
that will leave tens of thousands more Ameri-
cans dead. We must pass coronavirus aid be-
fore the end of this week.
