f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
this afternoon we pick up where we left 
off last night. The Senate has voted to 
advance the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill and bring debate on the substitute 
amendment to an end. 
I would repeat that Democrats are 
ready and willing to vote on additional 
amendments to the bill before moving 
to final passage. Once again, that will 
require the cooperation of our Repub-
lican colleagues. I hope they will co-
operate so we can move more quickly. 
Otherwise, we will proceed by the book 
and finish the bill. 
I said yesterday that we could do this 
the easy way or the hard way. Yester-
day, it appeared that some Republicans 
would like the Senate to do this the 
hard way. In any case, we will keep 
proceeding until we get this bill done. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on another related matter, as the Sen-
ate approaches final passage of the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill, I want to 
shine a spotlight on a part of the legis-
lative process that doesn’t see the light 
often enough: the Office of the Senate 
Legislative Counsel. 
There is an old political yarn that 
the legislative process is like watching 
sausage get made; you would rather 
not know. 
Well, the Office of Legislative Coun-
sel occupies a particularly difficult 
part of the sausage-making: turning 
Senators’ broad outlines for legislation 
into specific and precise legislative 
language. It is a very hard job. For 
over a century, this group of hidden ex-
perts have had a hand in crafting every 
major piece of legislation introduced in 
this Chamber.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6032 
August 8, 2021 
A century ago, many scoffed at the 
notion of having a team of profes-
sionals help the Senate write legisla-
tion. It was actually a New Yorker, I 
am proud to say, Elihu Root, who 
originally 
suggested 
in 
1912 
that, 
maybe, this body could use a little help 
in constructing well-written laws. It 
took a few years after he made his 
plea, but the complexity of tax legisla-
tion to raise revenue during World War 
I led to the creation of the original 
drafting service. 
During its first 4 years, the Legisla-
tive Drafting Service handled 518 re-
quests. By the 114th Congress, however, 
they were receiving more than 65,000. It 
is an amazing workload, unglamorous 
but vital and essential. 
Over the past few weeks, as we have 
worked on the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, the members of the legisla-
tive counsel have sacrificed weekends, 
family gatherings, and many, many 
hours of sleep to allow the Senate to do 
its work. I have seen it. We have called 
them up at 11 p.m. and said: You are 
needed to get this ready by the morn-
ing. And they don’t flinch. They just 
roll up their sleeves and work in their 
professional way. 
So we have always asked a lot of the 
legislative counsel, but they stepped up 
and did their job with excellence. 
There are a lot of members of the team 
who deserve recognition, beginning 
with the team’s laudable and impres-
sive 
leader 
on 
this 
bill, 
Deanna 
Edwards. 
I also want to thank Diane Nesmeyer 
and her team of assistants, who have 
all contributed very long hours, and let 
me mention them. They each deserve 
their own acknowledgement: Heather 
Burnham, Mark Mazzone, Christina 
Kennelly, 
Chris 
Patterson, 
Patrick 
Ryan, Karson Katz, Heather Lowell, 
Matt McGhie, John Goetcheus, Ruth 
Ernst, Mark McGunagle, Allison Otto, 
Vince Gaiani, Phil Lynch, John Hen-
derson, 
James 
Ollen-Smith, 
Kim 
Albrecht-Taylor, 
Christine 
Miranda, 
Rob Silver, Evan Frank, and Molly 
Dunlop. 
To every single person I mentioned, 
thank you, thank you, thank you for 
your 
incredible 
and 
indispensable 
work. Your skill and dedication makes 
it possible for this Chamber to serve 
the American public. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ran-
dom violence on the streets of Chicago 
results in Monday morning reports 
that break your heart: 100 people shot 
on the Fourth of July weekend; the fol-
lowing weekend, 50; the weekend after 
that, 70. 
It never stops. These mass shootings 
have become part of life in many cities 
across America, and it is a heart-
breaking reality. 
There are many ways to look at it. I 
have tried my best to understand it 
and to respond from a legislative point 
of view, but as we kind of play the pos-
sibilities and debate the opportunities 
we have to change things, the killing 
just goes on and on. 
The city of Chicago, like many cities 
in the United States, is awash in 
guns—awash in guns. Police—I believe 
the statistic is—have confiscated 16,000 
so far this year and still counting; 
thousands and thousands and thou-
sands of guns. 
In the roughest parts of Chicago, you 
wave a couple of $20 bills and you have 
a handgun in a matter of minutes. And 
there really is no age check involved; 
and young kids, as much as older folks, 
buy these guns right and left, claiming 
they are for self-defense and many 
times just putting them into the ma-
chinery of crime and death that has be-
come such a predictable part of life in 
that great city. 
Chicagoans across every possible de-
mographic this morning are shocked 
and grieving to learn that another Chi-
cago police officer was killed in the 
early morning hours. 
The slain officer was just 29 years 
old—29. She was assigned to the Com-
munity Safety Team, a special unit of 
officers from various districts who are 
pooled and sent to the meanest, most 
dangerous ‘‘hot spots’’ in the city. Her 
name has not been released. 
She and another Chicago police offi-
cer were shot last night when they 
pulled over a car in the Englewood 
neighborhood on Chicago South Side. 
The second officer is hospitalized as 
well and fighting for his life. 
Two suspects have been arrested, and 
a third is being sought. 
Gun violence and gun deaths are 
daily threats in many neighborhoods, 
neighborhoods where it is easier to find 
a gun than to find a job. Sadly, it is in-
creasingly a mortal threat to the Chi-
cago police officers who work in these 
neighborhoods. 
Several months ago, I had an im-
promptu, unreported meeting with the 
Chicago police force and invited any-
one in who wanted to sit with a Sen-
ator and try to explain what is going 
on. Eight of them showed up and were 
pretty well representative of the Chi-
cago police department—Black, White, 
Brown; male, female; Hispanic, African 
American; young and old—and they 
talked about the world they lived in 
and how the odds were against them on 
the streets of Chicago. 
The bad guys just have too damn 
many guns, and that is a reality. They 
don’t buy those guns in the city of Chi-
cago, incidentally. They buy them out-
side of Chicago—northwest Indiana, at 
gun shows, with no background checks. 
The gangbangers just take a 15-, 20- 
minute trip over the Indiana-Illinois 
border to a gun show and load up their 
truck with more guns, bring them back 
in, and sell them on the streets of Chi-
cago. That is a reality. 
Guns come from unlikely places. Too 
many guns come from States like Lou-
isiana and Mississippi, where they have 
gun standards that are weaker than 
some other places. But they also come 
from downstate Illinois. I am not going 
to try to sugarcoat that. Those are the 
reports. 
It troubles me, too, because when I 
talk to the police, they say: We need 
Federal help. 
What they would like to be able to do 
is try to track these guns, try to deter-
mine their sources and cut them off. 
The Agency that does it is the Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms Agency. 
We are trying now—desperately try-
ing now to get the approval in the Sen-
ate for a person to head that Agency, 
and, no surprise, the ranks are closed 
against this person on the other side of 
the aisle. 
Those who are listening closely to 
the gun lobby are trying their best to 
make sure ATF, this Federal Agency, 
doesn’t have strong leadership, doesn’t 
exercise all its authority under the law 
to make us safer. That doesn’t make it 
any easier for the Chicago police, and 
they end up paying the price. 
The latest fallen hero is the first Chi-
cago police officer killed by gunfire in 
more than 21⁄2 years. But nearly 40 Chi-
cago police officers have been shot, or 
shot at, in the line of duty this year. 
That is part of the duty, the responsi-
bility they face as they prowl the 
streets and alleys of the great city. 
Chicagoans mourn for the police offi-
cer who lost her life. We are going to 
pray desperately for recovery of the 
wounded officer. Thoughts and prayers 
are not enough to end gun violence in 
Chicago and nearly every community 
in America. We all know that. We need 
better laws to keep guns out of the 
hands of criminals and also out of the 
hands of people with serious mental ill-
ness and others who shouldn’t have 
them either. 
America’s families and police officers 
deserve our best effort to make the 
streets safer in Chicago and many 
other American cities. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
been listening to criticism from the 
other side of the aisle about our plan to 
improve American families’ economic 
security and the long-term strength in 
our economy. 
And I have to wonder, why do Repub-
licans never worry about deficits when 
they are passing trillion-dollar tax cuts 
that shower nearly all of the benefits 
on millionaires and wealthy corpora-
tions? 
Why do Republicans only rediscover 
a concern about the debt when they are 
asked to support policies to help mid-
dle-class, working families, low-income

August 8, 2021 
individuals—people struggling to get 
into the middle class? 
Or when someone proposes a long- 
term solution to make America’s econ-
omy resilient and more prosperous for 
everyone, they are opposed to that. 
That is ‘‘big spending.’’ 
Republican welfare for the rich has 
always been a bad investment. Forty 
years of trickle-down economics has 
given America the greatest income in-
equality since the Gilded Age in our 
history and the largest national debt in 
our history. Republicans’ devotion to 
trickle-down tax cuts has given us a 
shrinking middle class, a hollowed-out 
industrial base, and crumbling infra-
structure. It has made a small sliver of 
America lavishly wealthy and left the 
rest behind. 
The Republican economic agenda has 
left the majority of Americans asking: 
How are we supposed to pay for 
childcare, our kids’ college education, 
medical bills, or for the skilled nurses 
that mom and dad are going to need? 
Will we ever be able to retire? 
Trickle-down economics doesn’t have 
answers for those real-life questions, 
but our Republican colleagues keep 
doubling down on them. 
I predict, without fear of contradic-
tion, now that we have a Democratic 
President, someone on the Republican 
side of the aisle will come around again 
with a balanced budget constitutional 
amendment. It happens without fail. 
Republicans always turn to that when-
ever there is a Democratic President, 
even though the debt that President in-
herited was historic. 
But when their trickle-down tax cuts 
add trillions to the national debt, are 
they really worried? 
They never say a word about deficit 
and debt until they are in the minor-
ity. 
Donald Trump proposed more than a 
trillion dollars in tax cuts, with most 
of the benefits going to wealthy cor-
porations and individuals. 
Did the Republicans complain about 
the national debt then? No. 
Did they insist that such an expen-
sive gift must have bipartisan support? 
No. 
They passed their trickle-down tax 
cut through reconciliation without a 
single Democratic vote. 
Donald Trump promised that his tax 
cut would be ‘‘rocket fuel for the econ-
omy.’’ 
That may be a rare Trump boast that 
turned out to be true, although not ex-
actly the way he meant it. We now 
have a handful of billionaires who have 
decided to launch their own personal 
space programs. They are so wealthy 
they are racing each other into space 
while regular working people worry 
about rent, childcare, and getting on 
here on Earth. 
The Trump tax cut gave the wealthi-
est Americans a fat windfall. According 
to Americans for Tax Fairness, the Na-
tion’s 651 billionaires saw their net 
worth spike by more than $1 trillion 
during the first 9 months of the pan-
demic while the rest of America wor-
ried about how to pay the bills with a 
smaller paycheck or no paycheck at 
all. 
After Donald Trump signed his tax 
bill, surrounded by quite a few of my 
Republican colleagues in the Senate, 
he headed to a Christmas Eve dinner at 
Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and like Santa 
Claus, he announced to the wealthy 
members at his own private club at 
Mar-a-Lago: ‘‘You all just got richer.’’ 
That was the real effect of the Trump 
tax cuts—the real intent. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mated in 2018 that Trump tax cuts will 
add $1.9 trillion to the national debt 
over 11 years. Where is the Republican 
outcry over that? The notion of $3 tril-
lion to help working families pay less 
for the essentials of life, to cut their 
taxes, and give them an opportunity to 
be in an economy creating jobs really 
pales in comparison to the $1.9 trillion 
of tax cuts to the wealthy. 
Economists at the London School of 
Economics analyzed the effects of 
trickle-down tax cuts over 50 years, 
1965 to 2015. They found that trickle- 
down tax cuts consistently benefit the 
wealthy but had no meaningful effect 
on employment or economic growth, 
and they led inevitably to wider eco-
nomic inequality. 
The authors of the study were asked 
why some politicians still continue to 
push for these tax cuts for wealthy peo-
ple. They pointed to one reason: the 
power of wealthy individuals and cor-
porations 
to 
set 
policy 
agendas 
through their lobbying and campaign 
contributions. 
You know what is going on, the fabu-
lously wealthy people, who are contrib-
uting to politicians and causes that 
support their lifestyle, but they don’t 
want us to know. 
Is that why no Republican Senator 
supports President Biden’s Build Back 
Better plan to help American families 
and our economy, because billionaires 
have more lobbyists and deeper pockets 
than struggling kids and families? 
Two 
renowned 
economists 
from 
Princeton 
University—Alan 
Blinder, 
former Vice Chair of the Federal Re-
serve, and Mark Watson—looked at the 
major economic indicators of Amer-
ica’s economy for every President back 
to Franklin Roosevelt. 
They found by almost any major in-
dicator—gross domestic product, em-
ployment, incomes, productivity, even 
stock prices—America’s economy has 
grown significantly faster under Demo-
cratic Presidents than Republican. On 
jobs, since 1933, the six Presidents who 
presided over the fastest job growth 
have all been Democrats—the four 
Presidents with the slowest job growth, 
Republicans. 
Donald Trump campaigned, prom-
ising to be the ‘‘greatest jobs President 
God ever created.’’ There were 3 mil-
lion fewer jobs when he left office than 
at the beginning of his term. He is the 
first President since Herbert Hoover to 
lose jobs on his watch. 
The Democrats are once again clean-
ing up the Republican mess. With the 
help of the American Rescue Plan, 
which not a single Republican Senator 
or Congressman supported, America’s 
economy has added 4 million jobs dur-
ing the first 6 months of Joe Biden’s 
Presidency. That is the fastest growth 
for the start of any President ever in 
American history. 
Here is another fact from the Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research. 
Between 1953 and 2020, America’s econ-
omy was in a recession for 23 percent of 
the time that the Republicans held the 
White House, compared to just 4 per-
cent of the time that a Democrat sat in 
the Oval Office. 
For the past 40 years, Republican 
Presidents have run up larger deficits 
than Democrats. Let me say that 
again. In the past 40 years, Republican 
Presidents have run up larger deficits 
than Democratic Presidents. 
Donald Trump promised to get rid of 
the national debt in 8 years through 
trade policy. Instead, his trade policies 
were a costly disaster, and the national 
debt skyrocketed by more than $7 tril-
lion during his tenure. 
A ProPublica-Washington Post anal-
ysis found that growth in annual def-
icit under Donald Trump is the third- 
biggest increase relative to the size of 
the economy of any U.S. President, 
with his tax cuts being the major cul-
prit. 
I could go on citing facts and figures. 
Democrats look at human priorities 
like quality childcare, medical re-
search, renewable energy, and climate 
resilience, investments that grow the 
economy and raise wages and living 
standards for everyone. 
We should have no apologies as 
Democrats for the programs that we 
support, particularly when it comes to 
climate change. That is a fact of life, 
sadly, in America, and we see the re-
sults reported every night on the news. 
Whether it is fires or extraordinary 
weather events, they are happening 
with increased frequency. It seems that 
Republicans ignore that reality. We 
cannot afford as a nation to do that 
any longer. 
History shows that our approaches 
work in responding to many of these 
challenges. 
Our 
solutions 
produce 
stronger, more sustainable economic 
growth that benefits everyone. Strong-
er economic growth allows us to pay 
down our debt rather than continuing 
to add to it with more tax cuts for the 
top 1 percent. 
Republicans can refuse to support 
our plan to Build Back Better; that is 
their choice. But please spare us lec-
tures about fiscal responsibility. There 
is nothing responsible about repeating 
the same trillion-dollar mistake over 
and over and making small businesses 
and working families pay for it. 
I always thought the Laffer curve, 
which is the inspiration to the Repub-
licans for trickle-down economics, was 
the most appropriately named eco-
nomic device in history—it is a ‘‘laugh-
er’’—and we see over and over again

why that is. Giving tax breaks to the 
wealthy might make for a happy 
Christmas at Mar-a-Lago but not for 
the rest of the country. 
The real test is not whether we put 
votes on the board—and that is the bot-
tom line in the Senate—but whether 
the center will hold, whether or not we 
have a strong enough center in the 
Senate dedicated to responsible invest-
ment and infrastructure and can over-
come the forces outside. 
Former President Trump has been 
making all these speeches about how 
bad it is to have an infrastructure pro-
gram. Well, I would just like to remind 
the former President: He had no infra-
structure program. Talked big. Deliv-
ered nothing. Now, we have a chance 
under President Biden to have one that 
is bipartisan in nature and truly will 
help this economy and this country 
over the long run. 
In addition, I believe that we have to 
move further—and we certainly will 
with the budget resolution—in invest-
ing in America. The notion of having 
childcare—quality childcare—available 
and affordable to families is something 
that, unless you are a grandparent or a 
parent and know the reality, you may 
overlook and shouldn’t. It is a critical 
factor in family welfare and good out-
comes for children. 
In addition, 2 extra years of edu-
cation beyond the 12th grade, provided 
by our quality community colleges 
across America, is the ticket for better 
jobs and better training and better 
workers in the 21st century. 
As we stand here, our major chal-
lenge, I suppose—our nemesis, foe—is 
China. Some of us can remember some-
thing 
called 
ping-pong 
diplomacy, 
which occurred roughly when I came 
out of college. That was opening up 
what we called ‘‘Red China’’ then to 
the world and giving them an oppor-
tunity to compete and to be part of the 
world conversation, and it happened 
dramatically. 
I remember visiting China several 
times and the first time, watching 
them in their Mao jackets on their bi-
cycles, taking their kids to school. 
What I found in later visits was a real-
ly developed economy. The Chinese 
have a plan. They are mercantilists 
first, and they are marketing around 
the world successfully—successfully— 
because they have a plan. We don’t 
have a plan, not until this President 
arrived. 
President Joe Biden has started this 
plan by saying: First, we invest in our 
people and make certain that their 
lives are easier and successful. I sup-
port him completely in that effort. I 
hope many will. It should be bipar-
tisan. If we have sympathy for the 
wealthiest in our country, I beg my Re-
publican friends: Have some sympathy 
for the middle-income families, who 
are struggling every day to get by. 
I yield the floor.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will resume consideration of 
H.R. 3684, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety pro-
grams, and transit programs, and for other 
purposes. 
Pending: 
Schumer (for Sinema) Amendment No. 
2137, in the nature of a substitute. 
Carper/Capito Amendment No. 2131 (to 
Amendment No. 2137), to strike a definition. 
Carper Amendment No. 2633, to change the 
enactment date. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Delaware. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we just 
heard from the senior Senator from Il-
linois. I remember when he was a jun-
ior Congressman from Illinois, elected 
in 1982, along with about 80 other 
Democrats and Republicans from all 
over the country. One of them was me. 
One of them was me. And he has been 
a colleague off and on. I left the House 
to become the Governor of Delaware, 
and he came over to the U.S. Senate, 
and now, we get to work together 
again. 
He is a smart guy, a very bright guy, 
and a very caring person and very good 
at not just working with Democrats 
but working across the aisle. I admired 
that about him in the House, and I ad-
mire that about him in the Senate. 
He is passionate about a lot of 
things, but one of those is an impor-
tant one, immigration reform. And im-
migration reform may seem like it is 
far afield from what we are talking 
about here today, but for the 8 years I 
was privileged to be the Governor of 
Delaware, it was a good economy—Bill 
Clinton was the President—and it was 
a good economy for the country. More 
jobs were created in Delaware in those 
8 years than in any 8 years in Dela-
ware’s history. As Governor, I didn’t 
create one of them, but we did see a lot 
of job creation and economic growth, 
and I was the beneficiary of that, as 
were other people in my State and 
around the country. 
One of the reasons why I believe that 
comprehensive immigration reform is 
something we should have done and 
ought to do is not just because we are 
reminded on Sunday afternoon of Mat-
thew 25—when I was a stranger in your 
land, you welcomed me—but also, it 
makes good business sense. One of the 
keys to economic growth, whether it is 
my State or the State of New Mexico, 
where the Presiding Officer is from, 
one of the keys is the workforce, hav-
ing people who are either already 
trained or trainable and able and will-
ing to do the work that needs to be 
done. 
We have a little bit of a mismatch 
right now in our economy with respect 
to the skills that a lot of folks who are 
without jobs would like to be having; 
they would like to have a job or maybe 
a better job. There is a mismatch in 
what employers are looking for and 
what a lot of workers bring to the 
workplace. A big part of what we have 
done in these legislative packages—I 
call them cares packages—in the last 
year or 2 is to provide money for work-
force development and redevelopment 
to better equip people with the tools 
that they need. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, the reason why I men-
tion these things—comprehensive im-
migration reform, workforce training, 
retraining—is those are important in-
gredients to get our economy and to 
keep our economy moving. Our econ-
omy is moving in the right direction 
now, but we have to keep it going. 
When I was privileged to be Governor 
of the First State, we built a highway. 
I took the handoff from Republican 
Governor Mike Castle, and we built a 
highway all the way from I–95, in the 
northern part of our State, down past 
Dover, past the Dover Air Force Base, 
all the way to our beaches. Dover has, 
I think, more five-star beaches than 
any State in America, I am told, and it 
is a significant part of our economy, 
our tourist economy. And, just as tour-
ism is an important component, I 
think, in the economies of most of 
ours, we found that, for folks to be able 
to get to our beaches, they needed to 
have roads, highways, and bridges. 
We built State Route 1—a limited 
highway—from one end of the State al-
most to the other. We took I–495, which 
basically 
circles 
the 
city 
of 
Wil-
mington, and essentially shut it down 
and resurfaced it. We resurfaced I–95 
from Wilmington all the way up to the 
Pennsylvania line. 
We did a lot of things that were de-
signed not just to help the people of 
Delaware get where they needed to go, 
wanted to go, and move products, but 
also to help interstate commerce, and 
that is a key ingredient for those seri-
ous about growing the economy of our 
country. We have got to invest in our 
roads, highways, bridges, and in our 
rail. 
As it turns out, I came down here 
today on a train, as I do many days. 
God willing, I will go home tonight on 
a train. It is an Amtrak train. 
Interestingly enough, if you were to 
take a ton of freight and move it from, 
we will say, Washington, DC, to Bos-
ton, you can do it on about a gallon of 
diesel fuel. Think about that—a ton of 
freight from Washington, DC, to Bos-
ton, MA, on about a gallon of diesel 
fuel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6035 
August 8, 2021 
You can move a lot of people on Am-
trak. In the Northeast corridor, they 
travel on electricity. Out of the cor-
ridor, they use different fuels to move 
their locomotives. 
But one of the beauties about the leg-
islation that we have been debating 
here for the last week or two is that 
actually, in terms of getting our econ-
omy moving, keeping our economy 
moving, we provide significant invest-
ments in passenger rail service. We 
also provide significant investments in 
roads, highways, and bridges. We pro-
vide significant investments in rail to 
be used by freight, and we make sig-
nificant investments in our ports. 
A lot of people are going to be in-
volved, as the Presiding Officer knows, 
in doing all the work involving the dif-
ferent kinds of investments I just men-
tioned. Those are good jobs. Many of 
them are union jobs. They all pay the 
prevailing wage and provide a lot of in-
come for communities and for the folks 
who do that work. 
The other thing, at the end of the 
day, when work is more or less com-
pleted—we have made a lot of progress 
on roads, highways, and bridges, on 
broadband deployment, on our ports 
and our rail and our airports—at the 
end of the day, we will have created a 
ton of jobs, and we are going to leave 
in place an economy that is more effi-
cient and more productive at the same 
time and will enable us to grow our 
economy. 
One of the things that I most enjoyed 
in the last campaign was hearing Joe 
Biden talk about climate change or 
global warming. He said that when he 
heard the words ‘‘climate change’’ or 
‘‘global warming,’’ the word that came 
to mind for him was ‘‘jobs.’’ ‘‘Jobs.’’ 
I like to say it is possible to do good 
and do well at the same time. It is pos-
sible to build a more efficient, more 
productive economy and a cleaner 
economy, but it puts people to work as 
we do that, and then they will continue 
to work in the years to follow. 
At the end of all those investments 
and all that work, we will end up with 
far fewer emissions from our cars, 
trucks, and vans. God willing, we will 
end up with a lot fewer emissions from 
our stationary emitters of greenhouse 
gasses. 
The second major source of emissions 
in our country is powerplants, and the 
third greatest source of emissions in 
our country is from manufacturing op-
erations—cement plants for example. 
Those are the three top ones. The legis-
lation that is before us enables us to— 
we will make greater progress with re-
spect to those three sources of carbon 
pollution than just about anything I 
can think of. 
The President hosted a press con-
ference the other day at the White 
House. He invited several of our col-
leagues to join him and participate. He 
also invited the auto industry, auto big 
three, to come and the other auto com-
panies as well. There were folks there 
from the environmental community. It 
was a great celebration. 
What the President did is he signed 
an Executive order that said basically, 
why don’t we—just like this legislation 
before us builds on a foundation of leg-
islation that was reported out of the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee on drinking water, wastewater 
sanitation investments, and also legis-
lation reported out of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee that Sen-
ator CAPITO and I have the privilege of 
leading that focuses on roads, high-
ways, bridges, and the climate. But the 
press conference was designed to really 
complement what we are doing here 
today. The Presiding Officer was there, 
along with others, as I recall. 
But the President, in concert with 
the auto industry, has basically come 
to an agreement that, just like our leg-
islation on the floor today and for the 
last week, was built on the work of sev-
eral committees, including the Com-
merce Committee, rail safety; includ-
ing the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, energy—nuclear energy. It 
is built on the work of the Banking 
Committee with respect to investments 
in transit and built on the work of our 
committee too. 
The President’s Executive order was 
based on an agreement between really 
five auto companies from about a year 
ago in the State of California, the Cali-
fornia Resources Board, to gradually 
step up over a period of years, from 
2022 to 2026, the requirements for re-
quired reductions by mobile sources, 
reductions in greenhouse gases, with 
the idea that after 2026, we will expe-
dite and increase the amount of reduc-
tion that will be expected in green-
house gases from our mobile source. 
In any event, it is going to be hard 
for the auto industry, which was rep-
resented at that press conference. It is 
going to be hard for them to meet the 
kind of goals that are laid out in the 
President’s Executive order unless we 
make investments not just in roads, 
highways, and bridges but also in 
charging stations and fueling stations. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, there 
are investments in our committee’s 
bill and in this bill that is before us 
today that make significant invest-
ments in charging stations and fueling 
stations. When we say ‘‘fueling sta-
tions,’’ I am not talking about nec-
essarily gasoline and diesel; I actually 
am thinking of hydrogen. 
In the Finance Committee piece—it 
will probably be in the reconciliation 
package that we take up—there is leg-
islation that provides tax incentives to 
really build a much more efficient and 
clean economy in a variety of ways. 
Our Presiding Officer has worked a 
lot on methane, to reduce methane 
emissions, and to provide maybe an 
economic structure where leakage of 
methane, which is a potent greenhouse 
gas—we want to reduce that—but to 
develop an economic model that re-
wards companies, refineries, and others 
to reduce their methane emissions and 
figure out how to reinvest that money 
and ways to create clean energy. 
But one of the most encouraging in-
vestments in clean energy is with re-
spect to hydrogen. I remember going to 
the Detroit auto—Delaware used to 
build more cars, trucks, and vans per 
capita than any other State. We are 
not a big State. We have about a mil-
lion people. But we had, as recently as, 
gosh, 10 years ago about 3,000 or 4,000 
men and women working at a Chrysler 
plant near Newark, where the Univer-
sity of Delaware is located, and a GM 
plant near Wilmington, and it also had 
about 3,000 employees. When we went 
into the great recession a decade or so 
ago, both companies went into bank-
ruptcy. We lost both of those plants. 
The question is, What do we do about 
it? How do we recapture those jobs— 
really good jobs, union jobs, high-wage 
jobs, high-skill jobs? How do we recap-
ture those jobs? One of the ways that 
we can do it is providing an infrastruc-
ture that supports energy-efficient ve-
hicles, electric vehicles, and hydrogen- 
powered vehicles. 
I remember being at the Detroit auto 
show 10 years ago. It was the first time 
I met Mary Barra, who was a rising 
star at General Motors, later to be-
come the first woman CEO, and DEBBIE 
STABENOW, 
Senator 
STABENOW, 
was 
nice enough to introduce me to Mary 
Barra that day. 
I also remember that that day, I 
think it was the Chevrolet Volt was 
named the Car of the Year, and the 
Chevrolet Volt had its—you know, it 
runs on battery, and at the time, it got 
about 38 miles on a charge, and then 
when the electricity went away, it was 
all used up, the battery could run on 
gasoline. It was a classic hybrid. But 
that was 38 miles to a charge. Ten 
years later, my family and I just 
bought an electric-powered vehicle, 
and it gets 326 miles on a charge—326 
miles on a charge. You think about 38 
miles on a charge a decade ago to 326 
miles on a charge today, that is one 
heck of an improvement, an increase. If 
we want to lead the—and that is where 
people are going to go. 
I drove to the train station this 
morning. It is just a fun car to drive. It 
has great torque, and it is just a fun 
car, a great looking car. When you 
drive it, you have the joy of knowing 
that you are not polluting our planet. 
If we can provide the electricity in sus-
tainable ways, renewable ways—off-
shore wind, for example, solar—that is 
even better. It is even better. 
So we are at a point right now where 
I think about 3 percent of the vehicles 
on the road in this country are powered 
by electricity or hydrogen or some 
other sustainable source—3 percent. 
That is up from about 1 percent just a 
couple years ago. That may seem 
small, but when you look at the mar-
ket capitalization of Tesla and com-
pare it to, I think, any of the big three, 
the market capitalization of Tesla is 
enormous compared to the other com-
panies from which I bought our fam-
ily’s cars for decades, and they are get-
ting into the race.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6036 
August 8, 2021 
You know, renewable energy, electric 
vehicles, 
hydrogen-powered 
vehicles 
have a little bit of catching up to do, 
but the market signal here that we are 
getting from Tesla’s market capitaliza-
tion is the market says EVs—hydro-
gen-powered fuel cells—that is where 
the market is going. It sends a very 
strong signal for investment purposes, 
and that is where we are going. We in 
this country can choose to follow the 
parade, or we are going to lead the pa-
rade, and we can follow the parade led 
by the Chinese and Japanese and oth-
ers toward this new future or not. 
I want to go back to the Detroit auto 
show. I was there a couple of years 
after the Chevrolet Volt was named the 
Car of the Year, and I was walking 
around the place, a huge place, and I 
was walking around, and I came across 
a—they call it a stand, and at the auto 
show—it is not really a stand, but they 
have these platforms for vehicles, you 
know, maybe 2 or 3 feet up. They have 
platforms that they have for different 
models. Sometimes they are models 
that are just being launched; some-
times they are models of the future, 
you know. 
One day I was at the Detroit auto 
show, about 5 years ago. I think it 
might have been Toyota—I went by 
their stand, and they had this—really 
different—they had built around the 
vehicle on the stand, and they had 
framing. It was like 2 by 4’s of what I 
was told was a garage. There was a car 
in the—you have to use your imagina-
tion, but there was a car in the garage, 
and there was a house, part of a house, 
attached to the garage. 
I asked the person from I believe 
Toyota—I said: What is this? 
They said: This is the future. 
They had actually named their fu-
ture of—division of the company—I 
think it is called Mirai, something like 
that, which means ‘‘future.’’ 
The idea there is to use fuel cells and 
hydrogen. They told that day—they 
said that combination can help propel 
that vehicle that is in that make-be-
lieve garage. It can heat the house that 
is there alongside of it using—image, 
heat that house in the winter and cool 
that house in the summer. 
I said: Really? 
They said: Yes. That is the future. 
They were going to call it, I think, 
Mirai. And that is becoming real. That 
is becoming real. 
One of the pieces of legislation that a 
bunch of us have worked on is how do 
we provide hydrogen in a clean way so 
we don’t contribute to more green-
house gases. There is a process—I stud-
ied economics, but I know relatively 
little about chemistry, but there is a 
process called electrolysis where you 
can use electricity and water and cre-
ate oxygen and hydrogen and do it in a 
clean, sustainable way. 
So those are some of the things that 
are going on. The reason why I men-
tion them is because, in order for us to 
lead the parade on cars, trucks, and 
vans, low-emission vehicles around the 
world; in order for us to create the 
kinds of good-paying jobs that will flow 
from that economic activity; in order 
to get reduction in not just carbon di-
oxide and greenhouse gases but in 
other pollutants, the way to do that is 
to invest, and it is not all on the Fed-
eral Government. 
We 
provide 
R&D 
for 
technology 
through a variety of ways, but the idea 
is for us to make those investments in 
ways that can be monetized, if you 
will, by businesses, by industry to cre-
ate good-paying jobs and do good and 
do well at the same time, create eco-
nomic value, create good-paying jobs, 
and help us meet our targets to reduce 
greenhouse gases in this country by a 
great deal by the year 2050. That is the 
goal of the current administration. It 
is the goal of a lot of us here in this 
body and across the country. 
I hadn’t really thought about giving 
a talk, but it was just playing off of 
what Senator DURBIN
was talking 
about, and I wanted to share that with 
everybody today. 
I love to quote Albert Einstein. A lot 
of people remember Albert Einstein 
used to say: The definition of ‘‘insan-
ity’’ is to do the same thing over and 
over again and expect a different re-
sult. That is a pretty good quote, but 
my favorite is, in adversity lies oppor-
tunity. In adversity lies opportunity. I 
believe that with every fiber of my 
being. 
We face plenty of adversity politi-
cally here in this country today, with 
direct threats against our country 
from terrorism and threats against our 
planet from too much carbon in the air 
and greenhouse gases. But it turns out, 
on almost every one of those fronts, 
there is opportunity to make a better 
world and to make a better world by 
providing a lot of jobs and a lot of eco-
nomic opportunity. 
With that being said, I don’t see any-
one waiting to speak, so I am going to 
give my prepared remarks. I should be 
finished by about sundown, or it may 
seem that way, but it won’t be. But 
these are too good not to enumerate. 
It is good to see the Presiding Officer 
this morning—this afternoon. I rise to 
talk about the downpayment that the 
bill before us makes in terms of cli-
mate by making investments in clean 
vehicles and clean vehicle infrastruc-
ture. 
Long before I began representing 
Delaware in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and later as Governor and 
as Senator, I was a naval flight officer 
in the Vietnam var. I am the last Viet-
nam veteran serving in the U.S. Senate 
today. 
In the Navy, we had a lot of sayings, 
but the Navy has one saying that I 
think is most fitting for our fight 
against climate change, and it is this: 
‘‘All hands on deck.’’ ‘‘All hands on 
deck.’’ This is an all-hands-on-deck 
moment, and it requires us to move 
past divisive rhetoric and to work to-
gether to find solutions. 
Today, we are showing that we can 
work together and make real progress 
here in our Nation’s Capital, and that 
is what the people who sent us here 
want us to do. Fortunately, we now 
have a President and even a majority 
of Members of Congress who under-
stand that we can no longer wait for 
climate action. We need to take that 
action, take those steps. 
On President Biden’s first day in of-
fice, he put the United States back in 
the Paris climate agreement. Soon 
after, President Biden told the world 
we would put this country on a path to 
reduce over half of our climate emis-
sions by the end of the current decade. 
The President then laid out a road-
map through the American Jobs Plan 
on how he would reduce emissions, re-
place our crumbling infrastructure, 
and grow our economy all at the same 
time. 
The bill before us today does not 
fully realize that transformative vi-
sion, as some of us had hoped. In many 
areas, it falls short of the investments 
we need to reach our climate goals. But 
this bill does make significant and in 
some cases historic investments in sus-
tainable infrastructure and a cleaner 
economy. 
As many of our colleagues know, 
some of the most important climate in-
vestments we can make in the Federal 
Government are investments in clean 
transportation. The transportation sec-
tor is the largest source, as I said ear-
lier, of greenhouse gas emissions in our 
economy. Roughly 28 percent comes 
from cars, trucks, and vans that we 
drive. So reducing emissions from our 
mobile sources—our cars, trucks, and 
vans—is a critical part of reaching our 
Nation’s climate goals. 
In 
the 
Environment 
and 
Public 
Works Committee, I am privileged to 
lead with Senator CAPITO of West Vir-
ginia and our colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle. We worked together ear-
lier this year to pass the surface trans-
portation 
reauthorization 
that 
ad-
vances many of the climate goals in 
President Biden’s American Jobs Plan. 
I might add that we have 20 members 
of our committee—10 Democrats, 10 Re-
publicans—and we voted unanimously 
to report the bill out of committee and 
to send it to the Senate floor, where it 
became part of this legislation that is 
before us today. 
Our bill includes a historic climate 
title with over $18 billion in invest-
ments to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions and make our roads more resil-
ient to a changing climate. 
Within the surface transportation 
climate title is significant funding in 
support of a national network of clean 
vehicle recharging and refueling infra-
structure 
throughout 
our 
Nation’s 
highways and our State roads. This in-
vestment is about giving Americans a 
real choice when it comes to figuring 
out what they want to drive and ensur-
ing that every driver in America in 
every region of our country can con-
veniently access fueling and charging 
stations for electric or hydrogen-pow-
ered vehicles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6037 
August 8, 2021 
Investments in clean vehicle infra-
structure is more important today 
than ever. Every CEO of our Nation’s 
car manufacturers tells us the same 
thing: The future of the auto industry 
is zero-emission vehicles. Let me say 
that again. The future of the auto in-
dustry in this country and around the 
world is zero-emission vehicles. The 
global market is rushing to zero-emis-
sion vehicles, and our car companies 
need to invest in electric vehicles or be 
left behind. 
I mentioned Mary Barra earlier. I 
met her at the Detroit auto show a 
number of years ago. I called her last 
year and urged her and General Motors 
to join five car companies that had 
found common cause with the Cali-
fornia Air Resources Board and several 
dozen other States in stepping down 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
from vehicles in manufacture. I urged 
her to bring GM into the fold and join 
with the other five or so companies 
that had found common cause with 
California and lots of States, including 
my State of Delaware. 
She said to me: We are not prepared 
to do that just yet. She went on to say 
that the future is electric. She said the 
future of her industry is electric. I am 
all in on electric. She said: We need 
three things in order to be able to be 
successful in doing that, in making 
that transition. The first thing we need 
is a 300-mile range on recharging. 
I just bought a vehicle a month or 
two ago that gets 326 miles on a 
charge—326. That is up from 38 miles 
on a charge on a Car of the Year 10 
years ago, a Chevrolet product, and it 
was a huge improvement. 
Anyway, Mary Barra said: We need a 
300-mile range. And they have it in 
their cars now, several models. Ford 
has it. Chrysler is moving in that di-
rection and a bunch of foreign compa-
nies as well. 
Anyway, she said: In addition to a 
300-mile range, we need fueling sta-
tions, charging stations. We need them, 
she said, not just in a couple of places, 
but we need them all over the country. 
The third thing she said: We need 
technology where people can charge 
and recharge their batteries and not in 
hours around the country but in min-
utes. 
My wife and our son and I drove over 
the Fourth of July weekend. We drove 
from Wilmington, DE, to Wilmington, 
NC, in our new electric vehicle. We had 
to recharge it a couple of times, but it 
has a 326-mile range. 
The other thing: Along I–95, we have 
a lot of charging stations. We have a 
vehicle that actually tells us where the 
charging stations are, so you don’t 
have to worry about having range anx-
iety. 
But we don’t have enough charging 
stations, and the legislation that is be-
fore us today will not create enough in 
and of itself. But the investment tax 
credit that will be part of our Finance 
Committee package later on will help 
encourage a whole lot of investment 
from the private sector. So we are 
using a little bit of Federal money—ac-
tually quite a bit of Federal money to 
incent investment by the private sec-
tor. 
I was talking to some folks from a 
company; I think it is a Tennessee- 
based company. I don’t want to mess 
up their name. But they have truck-
stops throughout the country where 
larger trucks can fill up on diesel fuel. 
They sell gasoline, and they have food 
and that kind of thing. They are inter-
ested in investing in charging stations 
and fueling stations, hydrogen fueling 
stations, and what they need is an in-
centive to do that. The legislation that 
is before the Finance Committee pro-
vides that kind of incentive, and I 
think it will make a difference. 
So the need for charging stations and 
fueling stations is not going to be just 
on the Federal Government’s dime. It 
is not going to be just the State and 
local governments. It is not going to 
just be the Wawas of the world or the 
convenience stores of the world. It is 
not going to just be the auto industry. 
It is really all of us, with a major role 
that the Federal Government could 
play to encourage those investments. 
Speaking of General Motors, General 
Motors has announced its intention to 
produce only electric vehicles by 2035— 
only electric vehicles by 2035. Ford has 
announced that all the vehicles it sells 
in Europe will be electric by 2030. Jag-
uar will go electric in 2025. Volvo has 
announced that it will sell only elec-
tric cars by 2030. Volkswagen has an-
nounced its plan to increase its sales of 
electric vehicles by 2030 such that 70 
percent of the vehicles it sells in Eu-
rope and 50 percent of the vehicles it 
sells in the United States and China 
will be electric. Mini, like Mini Cooper, 
has also announced its transition to 
electric vehicles. Mercedes just an-
nounced its new cars would all be elec-
tric by 2030 in markets that are ready 
for electrification. And the list goes on. 
The leading trade association for the 
auto sector states that it is committed 
to ‘‘net zero carbon transportation’’ 
and believes that the nation that leads 
development and adoption of elec-
trification and other innovative tech-
nologies will ‘‘shape supply chains, de-
fine global standards, and potentially 
reshape 
the 
international 
market-
place.’’ 
A recent letter from the Alliance for 
Automotive Innovation, United Auto 
Workers, and the Motor and Equipment 
Manufacturers Association states that 
both business and labor are ‘‘com-
mitted to working toward a netzero 
carbon transportation future that in-
cludes a shift to electric-drive vehi-
cles.’’ To accomplish this, they believe 
that the United States must have a 
‘‘comprehensive national vision and 
strategy’’—a ‘‘comprehensive national 
vision and strategy.’’ 
Expanding and improving access to 
clean vehicle infrastructure will facili-
tate increased consumer demand for 
more clean vehicles, spurring cleaner 
air and a healthier climate and grow-
ing economy. 
You know, the thing that we love 
most of all about our electric vehicle is 
it is just fun to drive. It is, as we say 
in Delaware, a hoot, and great torque, 
great acceleration, and a lot of fun to 
be out on the road. That more than 
anything else will help sell it and pro-
vide the infrastructure that they need. 
With all the good work we did in our 
EPW Committee on the surface trans-
portation bill, it should be no surprise 
that the EPW bill is part of the founda-
tion of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan deal 
that is before us today. The bipartisan 
compromise before us expands invest-
ments for charging and refueling infra-
structure to a total of I think about 
$7.5 billion. The bill also includes fund-
ing for electric schoolbuses and elec-
tric transit buses. 
Specifically, our bill authorizes a 
grant program for alternative fuel cor-
ridors that will provide much needed 
funding to strategically deploy pub-
licly accessible electric vehicle charg-
ing infrastructure along designated al-
ternative fuel corridors that will be ac-
cessible to all drivers. 
We also create a community grant 
program to provide funding to expand 
access to electric vehicle charging in-
frastructure, especially in rural and 
disadvantaged communities. 
This bill will also provide an addi-
tional $5 billion distributed by formula 
to the States to build out EV charging 
so that drivers and car buyers can be 
confident of having access to a nation-
wide network of charging infrastruc-
ture. 
As I said before, this is just a down-
payment on what we can and must do 
in terms of climate action. However, as 
everyone who has bought a house 
knows, sometimes downpayments are 
hard to do and the most important step 
toward success. 
Let me close with this. My colleagues 
know that I try to focus on the areas 
where we can find consensus. 
We just had a funeral out in Wyo-
ming a couple of days ago to say good-
bye to our beloved colleague, Senator 
Mike Enzi, who is sort of—I call him— 
the author of the 80–20 rule that says: 
We agree—this is in his words. He used 
to work with Ted Kennedy on the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. It is an amazingly 
productive committee and an impor-
tant committee. Ted Kennedy was the 
senior Democrat, and Mike Enzi was 
the senior Republican. 
And I always asked Mike Enzi on this 
floor—I said: How can the two leaders 
in this committee, one a Democrat and 
one a real conservative Republican— 
how can you get so much done? 
And he said: We believe in the 80–20 
rule. We focus on the 80 percent that 
we agree on most of the time; and the 
other 20 percent, we set it aside to 
work on it some other time. 
If Mike Enzi is looking down today, I 
know that he will be saying ‘‘amen.’’ 
And we should follow his lead there, 
and this is one good place to do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6038 
August 8, 2021 
I always want to get things done by 
working with my colleagues across the 
aisle because I think bipartisan solu-
tions are lasting solutions. I like to 
find those where we can. I am com-
mitted to working with my Republican 
friends in the Senate on getting all 
these actions across the finish line. 
We will continue to work toward 
these urgent needs in the budget rec-
onciliation process. Again, it is an all- 
hands-on-deck 
moment, 
requiring 
meaningful investments in climate ac-
tions in a lot of different ways. The 
last thing we cannot afford is inaction. 
The last thing we cannot afford to do is 
to wait until later. 
We got to put in place commonsense 
policies, some of which we talked about 
today, and a lot of which is included in 
the legislation before us. These are 
policies that can spur economic invest-
ments in our Nation’s aging infrastruc-
ture, reduce our transportation pollu-
tion, and support the millions of Amer-
icans who are considering buying a 
clean car today or sometime soon. 
My hope is that we can work to-
gether to support our Nation’s clean 
energy infrastructure and move our 
economy to a brighter future. 
And before I yield the floor, I will 
just say to the Presiding Officer my ap-
preciation to her and the work that she 
and the committee that she serves on 
and helps to lead, the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee. 
I mentioned that a major source—a 
large source of carbon emissions comes 
from our mobile sources, but No. 2 is 
power plants, and the Presiding Officer 
is doing good work that helps to ad-
dress emissions there. The rest of us 
look forward to being able to partner 
with her on that in the days ahead, so 
I thank the Presiding Officer for her 
good leadership. 
Before the gentleman from Ohio 
speaks, I just want to acknowledge my 
friend and the friend of the Democrats. 
I shouldn’t say complimentary things 
like that to our Republican colleagues, 
I suppose, but I just want to applaud 
him for the leadership that he and Sen-
ator SINEMA and 20 other colleagues 
have fought for us in trying to get us 
to a good place and bringing the legis-
lation here before us. We are grateful 
for his leadership. He has about an-
other year, year and a half to serve in 
the Senate, and I and the rest of us 
want to make sure that that is a very 
productive period of time. We are hope-
ful we can get this done, and we will 
not just celebrate together, but we will 
do good work. We will have done really 
good work together. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate my colleague from Dela-
ware. He is the chair of the committee 
that produced a lot of the work that 
went into this package. Roads, bridges, 
the highway bill, and the surface trans-
portation bill comes through his com-
mittee. He and Senator CAPITO from 
West Virginia worked together, on a bi-
partisan basis. And my recollection is 
the underlying bill that we pick up in 
this broader bill that has to do with 
roads and bridges and so on passed with 
a vote of 22 to nothing out of this com-
mittee, and that is because they did 
good work in finding out where there 
was common ground. And, frankly, you 
know, the American people deserve to 
have good roads and bridges and infra-
structure to drive on and travel on. So 
it is a big part of this bill, and I thank 
him for his work on that. 
We have now voted twice to proceed 
to this very important legislation, to 
finally, after a lot of years of talking 
about it, making major improvements 
to our Nation’s roads and bridges and 
railroads and ports and waterways and 
water infrastructure, electrical grids, 
our broadband networks, and more. It 
is overdue. 
And I am delighted to say that twice 
now we have voted to proceed to final 
passage. One was a vote of 66 to 28, and 
the other was a vote of 67 to 27. And, 
frankly, there were a couple of people 
on our side of the aisle who were not 
able to come vote, one of whom has 
COVID and the other, in both cases, 
somebody had travel difficulties. So we 
would have had two more votes on our 
side that were positive votes as well. 
So this is a supermajority, and it is 
because the legislation makes sense for 
the States represented here in this 
Chamber and for the American people. 
It will improve the lives of all Ameri-
cans. It will make life better. So the 
mom who is stuck commuting, who 
would rather be spending time with her 
family every day, you know, is going to 
have the ability, through better trans-
portation infrastructure, to have fewer 
minutes and hours every day in grid-
lock. 
The truck driver who leaves the 
home, you know, and says goodbye to 
his family and goes on a long haul and 
thinks, ‘‘You know, am I going to be 
safe?’’ it will be safer, thanks to this 
legislation. 
We had two trucks collide on a bridge 
in Ohio recently. It is not safe. There is 
no shoulder on the bridge anymore be-
cause the traffic is bearing twice the 
number of vehicles that it was designed 
for. 
The mom who has been taking her 
daughter to the public library parking 
lot 30, 40 miles from their home to get 
internet access in order for her daugh-
ter to do her homework will now be 
able to have internet and be able to 
have broadband in her community 
right up to her home because of this 
historic investment in ensuring that 
the digital infrastructure is put in 
place. So you don’t have this divide. 
We have got counties in Ohio that 
just don’t have internet, period, and 
others have very slow internet. We 
have got about 30 counties that are a 
part of Appalachia. We have got about 
18 of those counties that are unserved 
and another large group that are un-
derserved. 
And that digital divide makes a huge 
difference because, again, those kids 
are going to fall behind, certainly dur-
ing the pandemic, when they had to be 
accessing the internet to just stay up 
with school. But even postpandemic, 
you know, we want to be sure that that 
learning opportunity is there. 
And then in terms of telehealth, you 
know, there are veterans in southeast 
Ohio who aren’t able to make the drive 
to the VA clinic in Columbus or else-
where, but they can take advantage of 
telehealth; and they have, to the ex-
tent they have access to it during the 
pandemic, and it has been actually 
quite helpful. But if they don’t have ac-
cess to the internet and high enough 
speed internet, they can’t get the 
healthcare at home that they need for 
appointments. 
It is also important for business. If 
you are a small business owner in these 
parts of the country that don’t have 
internet access, it is really tough to 
get off the ground. And these are the 
very areas of the country where we 
want to have more economic develop-
ment, so that is in this legislation as 
well. 
And in terms of water infrastructure, 
Ohio has got a lot of aging water infra-
structure. I saw someone wrote a story 
recently, saying that only about a 
quarter of this bill goes into hard as-
sets. That is just not accurate. In fact, 
a quarter of it goes to roads and 
bridges and even more, I guess. But 
water infrastructure is a hard asset. 
Ask the communities in Ohio that 
have been told by the EPA, in Repub-
lican and Democrat administrations: 
You got to fix your sewer system; you 
got to fix your drinking water system; 
you can’t have combined sewer over-
flow. 
And they just can’t afford it, particu-
larly in these mid-size cities. They are 
really excited about water infrastruc-
ture. 
Our ports, that is hard infrastructure 
too. So ships are lined up at some ports 
right now, including out West. And so 
if you are a consumer, you are trying 
to buy something and you are won-
dering why you can’t get it, including, 
you know, maybe an electronic device 
you want, or maybe it is a part to an 
automobile that you want, a lot of it is 
it is stuck. Stuff is stuck right now be-
cause 
our 
ports 
are 
not 
efficient 
enough and capable enough to handle 
what they should be able to do. 
Our land ports, if you are concerned 
about the southern border and the abil-
ity to screen trucks and cars coming in 
to try to keep some of this deadly 
fentanyl and other drugs from coming 
over our southern border, you should 
want this legislation because it is 
going to provide more infrastructure 
for our ports. 
So there is a lot in here that will 
make people’s lives better, and that is 
obviously one reason that this is so 
popular, because people do expect it 
here in America. This great economy 
we have, we should be able to also lead

the road in infrastructure, and we 
don’t. There is a study out saying, in 
fact, we are not even in the top 10 in 
terms of infrastructure around the 
world. 
It also will make our infrastructure 
more resilient to natural disasters and 
other crises. It will make our Nation 
safer and more secure. It will grow our 
economy in a million small but mean-
ingful ways. What the economists say 
when they look at this legislation—and 
by the way, again, every President in 
modern times has proposed this big in-
frastructure package for this reason. 
They say it will make your economy 
more efficient. 
So we have fallen behind on infra-
structure, and if we can catch up, the 
economy is more efficient; therefore, 
we are more productive; therefore, the 
economy grows; therefore, more tax 
revenue comes in from infrastructure. 
So it is a good long-term investment. 
It is not money that is going to be 
spent next year. Think of the projects 
in your community that might be 
helped. That project may last for 10, 15 
years, even before it is finally com-
pleted. 
So this money goes out over time for 
hard infrastructure. That is one reason 
it doesn’t affect inflation in a negative 
way. In fact, it is counterinflationary 
because it invests in hard assets and in 
jobs over time. If you are in business, 
think about your capital expenditures. 
Your capex budget is going to be dif-
ferent than your day-to-day spending 
than you probably thought of from 
your capex. 
It is going to also take some impor-
tant steps to repair, replace, and build 
assets that will last for decades. Again, 
that makes life better for people. It 
makes the economy more efficient. It 
also is something that, as economists 
look at it, they believe will be counter-
inflationary. 
It has been made clear in poll after 
poll this is something that brings this 
country together. So, unbelievably, 
there is a poll by CNBC showing 87 per-
cent of the American people think it is 
important that we, here in Congress, 
invest in improving our roads and our 
bridges. 
Within a couple of months, another 
poll by CBS found exactly the same 
number, that 87 percent of the Amer-
ican 
people 
support 
more 
Federal 
spending 
on 
repairing 
roads 
and 
bridges. 
An Associated Press poll found that 8 
in 10 Americans favor plans to increase 
funding for roads, bridges, and ports, 
and for pipes that supply drinking 
water. That is what the bill does. 
And we need the investment. Let’s be 
honest. The American Society of Civil 
Engineers gives our infrastructure in 
America a grade of C-minus. That is 
not very high. And they project our 
economy stands to lose more than $10 
trillion in GDP—$10 trillion in our 
economy—by 2039, if we fail to invest 
in these repairs. We have fallen to 13th 
in the world in infrastructure while 
key foreign competitors, like China, 
spend now four times more on infra-
structure than we do. 
China is spending four times more as 
a percent of their economy on infra-
structure than we do. Why? Because 
they want their economy to be more ef-
ficient. They want to compete with us 
and win. We want to compete with 
them and have American workers win. 
Thirteenth in the world is based on a 
study that is done periodically. To en-
sure that we are comparing apples to 
apples, they look at all kinds of things. 
America has a very strong, competitive 
economy, generally, but infrastructure 
is a weakness for us. 
So this is the World Economic 
Forum. They put this study out peri-
odically. I follow it. I look at it be-
cause it has a lot of different things in 
it—not just infrastructure—as to how 
our economy is working. 
How are we doing on permitting? 
Not so good. Guess what. We have 
permitting reform in this package, and 
the permitting reform will allow the 
Federal dollar to go further. 
So think about it: If it takes 6, 8, 10 
years to permit a project, the enor-
mous cost involved in that. But if you 
can do it in 2 years, which is the goal 
of our permitting reform, that makes a 
huge difference. And a lot of it is be-
cause you have a lot of different Fed-
eral Agencies that are requiring per-
mits. If you have an energy project, 
whether it is a fossil fuel project or 
whether it is a renewable energy 
project, you can have as many as 30—I 
am told, in 1 case, 35 different permits. 
By the time you finish the first 30, you 
have to go back to the first one again 
to get fit in. It is crazy. 
We had a project in Ohio actually 
shut down because they just couldn’t 
handle the permitting. It was actually 
a hydropower along the Ohio River. 
So that is in this legislation, too— 
historic permitting reform—and that 
should make sense to every taxpayer. 
Yet we want to go through the environ-
mental studies. That is fine, but let’s 
do it quickly and efficiently and re-
quire one Agency to be in charge and 
accountable. That is what this does. It 
requires that there be a dashboard that 
anybody can look up and find out 
where that project is. That keeps it 
moving, very transparent. That is in 
this proposal. 
So there are some good things in here 
that ensure that the money that is 
spent is spent more wisely than it has 
been in the past. 
Let’s be sure people can’t come back 
and sue after the fact. We take the 
amount of time that someone can come 
back after the fact and sue on a project 
from 6 years to 2 years. That is very 
important to developers. That is very 
important to our workforce. That is 
very important to the building trades 
in this country. 
You look at the list of supporters of 
this project, and, I mean, it is unbeliev-
able. The American Farm Bureau and 
over 30 farm groups have now come out 
for this proposal. So for those in Big 
Ag States, I would say, listen to your 
Farm Bureau—you usually do—and 
they will tell you this is very good for 
the farmer who wants to get his crops 
to the market. 
In Ohio, we have a lot of soybeans. 
We want to get them to the elevator in 
order to be efficient, but we also send 
them all over the world. So we want 
our ports to be efficient. 
But it is not just the Farm Bureau. 
You have the National Association of 
Manufacturers 
supporting 
this, 
the 
American Chamber of Commerce, the 
Business Roundtable, and the AFL–CIO 
Building Trades Council. The men and 
women who do the work strongly sup-
port this legislation. So it is going to 
help in terms of jobs, competitiveness. 
And, again, it is no wonder that so 
many people over the years have said: 
We need to fix our infrastructure. 
Every President in modern times, by 
the way, has had a proposal to do so. 
The joke here in Washington is, ‘‘Oh, it 
is infrastructure week again’’ because, 
frankly, 
administrations 
over 
time 
have had infrastructure week—‘‘We are 
going to get infrastructure done this 
week’’—and 
nothing 
has 
happened. 
Congress has been stuck. 
We have been in gridlock on this, 
kind of like the gridlock during rush 
hour in so many of our cities today 
that we want to fix with this bill. Well, 
that gridlock here has kept us from 
doing what we are trying to do in this 
legislation. 
Five hundred and fifty billion dollars 
in additional funding over the next 5 
years is what this is. Others have said 
it is a trillion. I don’t—it is $550 bil-
lion. It is actually a little less: $548 bil-
lion is what the final number was over 
5 years, as a shot in the arm to help get 
these projects going, not just in the 
next year or 5 years but over the next 
20 or 30 years. This money will be 
spread out over time. 
But this is part of how we get Amer-
ica on a track where we have good-pay-
ing jobs and more efficiency in our 
economy long term. 
Every President, as I said, has tried 
to get the infrastructure bill done. One 
of those Presidents is our most recent 
President, President Donald Trump, 
who pushed to pass a $1.5 trillion infra-
structure bill during his time in office 
in his budget. As a developer, he gets 
it. He understands the importance of 
infrastructure, and I applaud him for 
that. 
And, honestly, I think he changed 
the discussion a little bit on my side of 
the aisle. I think he got more Repub-
licans thinking. One of my colleagues 
told me recently the two things gov-
ernment ought to do and do well is na-
tional defense and infrastructure. I 
think there are other things that gov-
ernment does as well, but that is not a 
bad list for what the priorities ought to 
be for the Federal Government. Look 
at the Interstate Highway System as 
an example of what needs help now. 
So I appreciate the fact that Presi-
dent Trump got the discussion going

S6040 
August 8, 2021 
among Republicans who might not pre-
viously have focused on that. 
Here are just a few highlights of what 
we secured in this legislation. 
We are going to provide billions in 
funding for some of our most pressing 
hard infrastructure needs: $110 billion 
in new spending over the next 5 years 
to construct, rebuild, and maintain our 
Interstate Highway System, our roads, 
and our bridges. 
That is going to make a big dif-
ference for us in Ohio. We have 123,000 
miles of roads. And where traffic con-
gestion occurs in Ohio, we have an esti-
mated $4.7 billion lost each year—lost 
time, wasted fuel, according to the 
American Society of Civil Engineers— 
$4.7 billion because of traffic conges-
tion in Ohio alone. 
They also say there are currently 
more than 46,000 bridges in our country 
that are considered structurally defi-
cient and in poor condition. Think 
about that: 46,000 bridges considered 
structurally deficient and in poor con-
dition—46,000. And yet, 178 million 
trips are taken across these deficient 
bridges every single day. One hundred 
and 
seventy-eight 
million 
cars 
or 
trucks go over these same structurally 
deficient bridges. 
Ohio, by the way, is No. 2 in the Na-
tion for bridges. We like bridges in 
Ohio. We have lots of creeks and rivers 
and railroad tracks to go over. We have 
over 40,000 bridges, but nearly half of 
those are not in good condition. That is 
the reason I am pleased this bill pro-
vides $12.5 billion to fund the bipar-
tisan Bridge Investment Act that will 
award competitive grants to improve 
our Nation’s bridges based on whether 
they are major bridges of commercial 
activity, based on their condition, 
based on their safety. 
We have $60 billion total to help 
State and local government fund major 
construction projects, like the long- 
awaited Brent Spence Bridge Corridor 
in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. We 
have been talking about replacing the 
Brent Spence Bridge as long as I have 
been in elected office, and that has 
been a while. It has been probably 25 
years of talking about this. Let’s get it 
done. 
We are going to make immediate re-
forms to the permitting process, as I 
said, because that will help with regard 
to that bridge and others to do it more 
quickly, more efficiently, with less 
cost to the taxpayer dollars. 
Again, I want to commend the Trump 
administration 
because 
they 
prioritized that issue. But the legisla-
tion that we had passed here to help 
with speeding up permitting sunsets. 
So this legislation that we are voting 
on here actually ends that sunset and, 
therefore, ensures we can continue that 
permitting going forward. 
If we don’t do it in this bill and don’t 
do it soon, we are not going to have 
projects signing up for this interagency 
council on permitting because they 
will have the sunset. They know that 
they are not going to be able to take 
advantage of it. So that is really im-
portant. 
We also strengthen the provision, 
make it cover more projects, and en-
sure that, again, we are going to get 
these permitting reforms to make this 
dollar—this Federal dollar—go further. 
And we are going to make a nec-
essary investment in the future of our 
economy by providing $65 billion to in-
crease access to broadband services to 
connect more Americans to the inter-
net. 
In Ohio, it is estimated that about 
300,000 households lack access to the 
high-speed broadband that many of us 
just take for granted. We assume ev-
erybody has it. People don’t. It is hold-
ing folks back from being able to get 
the schooling they need, the healthcare 
they need, or to have the economic op-
portunities that come with being con-
nected to the internet. 
These are just a few highlights, and I 
can go on. But the bottom line is that 
we are dedicating almost $550 billion to 
new infrastructure spending over the 
next 5 years to go toward a wide range 
of priorities that will collectively have 
a positive impact on the people I rep-
resent and all Americans. 
Importantly, we have funded our bill 
through a number of responsible pay- 
fors without any new taxes on working 
families, on small businesses, on large 
businesses, on anybody. This is being 
done without tax hikes. 
That is significant because, remem-
ber, when we first started talking 
about infrastructure, it was in the con-
text of a proposal from the Biden ad-
ministration for a huge increase in 
taxes. It was a $2.65 trillion package 
and included incredibly steep tax in-
creases. In fact, taxes increased to 
much more than taxes were cut back in 
2017 in that proposal, about four times 
more. Some say five times more. 
But we decided: No, let’s not do that. 
Let’s pull infrastructure from this 
package—really 
core 
infrastructure, 
because infrastructure is being defined 
in ways that it had never been defined 
before, including so-called soft infra-
structure: social spending for nursing 
homes or for healthcare or for electric 
car companies outside of infrastruc-
ture. 
We said: No, let’s just pull the core 
infrastructure out of it, and let’s take 
the taxes off. And that is how we got 
down to, again, $548 billion and without 
taxes. 
So from the start, we have said some 
of our pay-fors will not be fully re-
flected in the formal CBO score that 
came out on Thursday. But, instead, it 
will be reflected in CBO estimates. 
What is CBO? CBO is the Congres-
sional Budget Office. It is the group up 
here that we have to rely on in terms 
of our legislation to say how much 
something costs. 
Republicans and Democrats alike 
love to complain about CBO. In fact, 
often, it is my Republicans com-
plaining about them on my side of the 
aisle because they don’t give enough 
credit to the feedback effect from tax 
cuts. 
Democrats are kind of just the oppo-
site. They think there should be more 
feedback effect—in other words, a dy-
namic score as relates to spending. 
And we disagree on their calculation 
of scoring. But that is who we have to 
rely on. 
So the CBO estimate that just came 
out, including what they said about 
their official score, was disappointing 
to me because they didn’t follow what 
we wrote in the law. We have had this 
discussion, and, you know, they are the 
arbiter. So my same Republican col-
leagues who have complained about 
CBO over the years in other contexts 
are now saying: Well, look, the CBO 
score isn’t high enough. You know, you 
said about half of it would be paid for 
by official CBO scores. Well, it is, but 
they didn’t give us credit for it. 
One example is CBO’s limitation that 
they can’t account for States returning 
to the Federal Treasury the money 
that we dictated they had to return in 
our bill. They just won’t do it. 
Fifty-three billion dollars was in our 
legislation for unused funds from the 
enhanced COVID UI supplemental put 
in place during COVID–19. Recouping 
this outdated supplement is a win for 
the American taxpayers, and everyone 
should support sending it back toward 
projects like infrastructure that help 
move our economy forward rather than 
for other purposes. And yet CBO gives 
us no credit for that. 
CBO is not fully able to reflect the 
funding streams that will help pay for 
our legislation in other ways as well. I 
will give you, perhaps, the two most 
striking examples of this. 
One is that working with the White 
House, working with the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, working with the 
individual Agencies, we were able to 
determine that some of the COVID–19 
funds that this Congress had sent back 
to the States through Agencies was not 
being spent, and so we wanted to repur-
pose that money through this purpose. 
Remember, we spent a lot of money, in-
cluding $1.9 trillion recently. But even 
before that, four different pieces of leg-
islation were sending money out to the 
States for COVID–19 purposes. 
And so we said: Well, if it is unused 
COVID funds, let’s return it to the 
Treasury and apply it to this. And it 
makes sense. Infrastructure is some-
thing States and localities are eager to 
have—better infrastructure—and it is 
appropriate to use some of that fund-
ing. 
So we said in our proposal that $41.8 
billion would be rescinded based on 
what we got from OMB, from the indi-
vidual Agencies on their unobligated 
funds. The White House signed off on 
it. We all signed off on it, Republican 
and Democrat. Unfortunately, CBO 
chose to give us credit for just $13.4 bil-
lion rather than $41.8 billion. It is frus-
trating. It is a difference of $28.4 billion 
in savings. 
Now, what they say is that we are 
not convinced that even though these

are unobligated balances—which we 
have been able to prove, by the way, 
and we have documents from the White 
House, now, after the fact, showing this 
again. But they have said: Well, we 
don’t believe that these Agencies that 
have extra money are going to spend 
the money. That is one of the reasons 
they gave. We think they will just keep 
the money. 
When has an Agency not spent the 
money that Congress provides them, I 
would ask my colleagues? 
I will give you a real-world example 
of this. As we started to look for these 
unused COVID funds, it turns out that 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
USDA, had some extra funds that they 
had not sent out to anybody and 
weren’t planning to. When they heard 
that we were nosing around with the 
Office of Management and Budget and 
with the White House to pull back 
some of those funds for this purpose, 
for a good purpose, for infrastructure— 
guess what—they came up with an-
other program. They had the discretion 
to send the money out under another 
program. So they came up with one 
and said: Oh, now we have got this 
money covered. You are not allowed to 
touch it. 
So I am just telling you that is one of 
the challenges with these CBO scores. 
They took $28.4 billion in savings and 
just decided, because they knew best, 
that this was not going to be available 
because the Agencies were going to 
spend it, even though they haven’t 
spent it, they had no reasons to spend 
it, they had no plans to spend it. And, 
again, the Office of Management and 
Budget at the White House had con-
firmed that. 
Another example: We went from a 
savings of $65 billion from the next 
auction for spectrum down to $20 bil-
lion in response to concerns by col-
leagues on our side of the aisle that 
this might affect our national security. 
So $65 billion in savings, CBO-scored 
savings, in this legislation, went to $20 
billion—working with the Department 
of Defense, carefully; working with the 
Office of Management and Budget; 
working with the Armed Services Com-
mittee here, ensuring that we weren’t 
going to touch any spectrum in that 
future sale that had a national security 
implication. 
So that reduced our CBO score. We 
understood that, but we wanted to be 
sure that we weren’t taking any risks 
by having any issue with regard to 
DOD spectrum that they didn’t want to 
provide. 
CBO then, in their report on Thurs-
day, decided that they weren’t going to 
give us credit for that $20 billion. They 
took it down to about $10 billion. We 
lost $9.8 billion on a CBO score there. 
And, again, when we pushed on that, 
they said: Well, we just need to know 
that the White House is going to move 
ahead with a spectrum auction. 
Well, they are, and they have sent us 
a letter saying they are. 
So, again, this is a little arbitrary, 
don’t you think? How can CBO decide? 
So just as they took $30 billion away 
from the CBO score with regard to 
repurposing COVID money, which is 
based on the unobligated balances that 
the White House agreed to, that OMB 
agreed to—but CBO is saying somehow 
the Agencies aren’t going to spend that 
money. I mean, all the records, if you 
look at what happens, is that they will 
spend the money. 
So we are saving the money. We are 
pulling it back and applying it to a 
good purpose: infrastructure. 
So I would just caution my col-
leagues who, again, traditionally are 
skeptical of CBO and somehow, in this 
case, think CBO is perfect, to look a 
little closer at these scores and look at 
the fact that they are not necessarily 
accurate. 
What this legislation does not do— 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act—is it does not include the grab bag 
of massive new social spending that 
Democrats included in their first pack-
age and certainly that they are now in-
cluding in their $3.5 trillion spending 
proposal they unveiled earlier this 
month. 
And this is an important point that 
my colleagues shouldn’t miss. The 
President has said that the package— 
the $3.5 trillion—will not include more 
core infrastructure spending. Now, re-
member, that was pulled out of his 
original package, the $2.65 trillion. We 
took about half of the core infrastruc-
ture out of there and took out all the 
taxes, so we are at $548 billion. 
And he made a commitment, both 
privately and publicly, as have Demo-
crats up here, that that is the negotia-
tion on the core infrastructure. So the 
roads and bridges we have talked about 
earlier, the water infrastructure, the 
rail, the ports—that can’t be double 
dipped in terms of also including that 
in the $3.5 trillion. 
Now, they will have a lot of other 
spending in there that is social spend-
ing, that is not this capital expenditure 
spending we talked about. Many of my 
colleagues know what capex means, 
that you typically borrow for your 
capex, and it is long-term spending for 
hard assets. But that is not what the 
$3.5 trillion is about, and that is why I 
strongly oppose it, as do my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle. 
The President having said that the 
package will not double dip, that we 
won’t have that in there, is very impor-
tant to remember because we have 
saved taxpayers not only huge tax in-
creases by finding a bipartisan solution 
here, but we saved taxpayers from a lot 
of additional spending that otherwise 
would have occurred. 
This investment in repairing and up-
grading our Nation’s infrastructure 
will have real, lasting benefit for our 
country through building out hard as-
sets that improve productivity and im-
prove efficiency without adding to in-
flation. It will create hundreds of thou-
sands of good-paying jobs in industries 
ranging from construction and plumb-
ing to electrical engineering and soft-
ware development, with one recent 
study from the Association of Equip-
ment Manufacturers finding that the 
legislation could create around half a 
million jobs by 2024. 
This is why every business group in 
America is supporting this legislation, 
as well as all the ag groups—over 30 ag 
groups—including the American Farm 
Bureau. It is why the AFL–CIO Build-
ing & Construction Trades Council is 
supporting it, because they are going 
to provide a lot of the workers for this. 
Even more importantly, given the re-
cent economic news we have seen, is 
this proposal will not cause inflation to 
increase. As Democratic economist 
Larry Summers on the other side of 
the aisle and many of us here on the 
Republican side of the aisle had been 
warning about for months, including 
me, inflation is here, with prices for 
consumers up 5.4 percent over this time 
last year. 
And this rate of inflation, in my 
view, could well go up even further. 
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO Di-
rector, now head of the American Ac-
tion Forum, a conservative economist; 
Michael Strain, director of economic 
policy studies at the American Enter-
prise Institute, AEI, also a conserv-
ative scholar, has said that our bipar-
tisan infrastructure package will slow 
down inflation. 
They said: ‘‘Improving roads, bridges, 
and ports would make it less costly for 
businesses to operate, allowing them to 
increase their output per hour, and 
putting downward pressure on con-
sumer prices.’’ 
So I know some of my colleagues 
want to conflate these two, the $3.5 
trillion extravaganza with huge tax in-
creases and immediate social spending 
and this long-term spending we have 
talked about here, where very little 
money is going to go out the door even 
in the next year or two. But they are 
not the same, and I think it is irre-
sponsible to say they are the same. 
The bottom line is that the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act will 
provide a historic investment in hard 
infrastructure, with input from a bi-
partisan 
group 
of 
Senators, 
while 
avoiding the tax hikes that would hurt 
our economy, destroy jobs, and under-
mine our competitiveness around the 
world. 
And importantly, for the sake of fu-
ture bipartisanship here in Congress, it 
is an infrastructure plan that allows us 
to avoid the repeat of the COVID–19 
spending bill, the $1.9 trillion that 
passed under this partisan process of 
reconciliation. 
It is also the alternative way that we 
ought to operate around here instead of 
the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package 
that is coming next. It demonstrates to 
the American people that we can, in 
fact, work together to get big things 
done in a responsible way. 
President Biden promised to govern 
in a bipartisan manner, in his inau-
gural address and in his campaign. Un-
fortunately, he hasn’t done that with

regard to the COVID package, the $1.9 
trillion under reconciliation, the $3.5 
trillion that they are now going to at-
tempt to pass here in this Chamber. 
But this bipartisan package is an op-
portunity for all of us to fulfill that 
pledge, to figure out how to work to-
gether to get big things done. 
It is a genuine compromise. It is not 
the bill I would write. It is not the bill 
my colleague KYRSTEN SINEMA would 
write on the Democratic side of the 
aisle. But it is good for the country. It 
builds 
our 
core 
infrastructure. 
It 
doesn’t raise taxes on the American 
people. It will grow the economy. It 
will lead to more tax revenue coming 
in to the Treasury, and yet it includes 
responsible pay-fors. 
Soon, I hope we will all be able to 
vote on final passage of this legisla-
tion. As I indicated, we have already 
had two votes to proceed to final pas-
sage. One was 66 to 28; the other was 67 
to 27. I think it is time for us to come 
together and to enact this bipartisan 
achievement for our Nation, for our 
economy, and for the people we rep-
resent. 
CRYPTOCURRENCY 
Madam President, I want to address a 
specific part of the legislation that is 
before us. It relates to cryptocurrency. 
As we know, cryptocurrency is a dig-
ital asset that more and more people 
are investing in, and we should want 
that to continue and continue in a 
healthy and sustainable way. 
There is consensus here in Wash-
ington and around the country that 
there should be better and more con-
sistent reporting on cryptocurrency 
transactions. By the way, this would be 
a good thing for honest, taxpaying 
holders of cryptocurrency, which is the 
vast majority of them who, today, have 
to figure out their basis and sometimes 
their gross proceeds when filing taxes 
because they don’t get a 1099. 
The form 1099 that a financial insti-
tution would give you if you invested 
in stocks or bonds or other financial 
instruments often is not available for 
holders of cryptocurrency, which cre-
ates problems. 
Standardizing this basic information 
reporting by crypto brokers for tax 
purposes is going to help provide more 
certainty for everyday Americans look-
ing to invest in these digital assets. 
The experts at the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Joint Committee on Tax-
ation and the Department of the Treas-
ury say that this would lead to better 
tax compliance as well. So the infor-
mation reporting would lead to better 
compliance with the Tax Code. 
The question is who should issue that 
1099 
in 
a 
cryptocurrency 
context. 
Again, the consensus is that it should 
be the brokers of cryptocurrency, just 
as it is for stocks and bonds and other 
financial instruments. 
In the underlying bill, a broker is de-
fined as any person responsible for reg-
ularly providing any service effec-
tuating transfers of digital assets by 
cryptocurrency—which, for tax pur-
poses, means a sale—on behalf of some-
one else. 
Some crypto brokers already comply 
with these standard information-re-
porting obligations, but for those who 
have not yet adopted these practices, 
this rule change is going to make it 
easier for their customers to pay their 
taxes due. 
The concern has been expressed that 
some in the cryptocurrency industry 
who are not brokers could be inadvert-
ently caught up in this definition. The 
Department of the Treasury, the non-
partisan 
Congressional 
Joint 
Com-
mittee on Taxation, and others believe 
that the current language is clear and 
that the reporting requirements only 
covers brokers. 
But my view is that we should work 
to clarify this, given the potential for 
confusion on an extremely important 
issue. In particular, we want to be sure 
miners and stakers and others, now or 
in the future, who play a key role by 
validating transactions, or sellers of 
hardware or software for digital wal-
lets, or node operators, or others who 
are not brokers are clearly exempted. 
While it is not the intent of the un-
derlying bill to include them, I believe 
we can do more to make this clear, 
which is why I will continue to work 
with colleagues to clarify the intent of 
the information-reporting language. 
There have been a number of amend-
ments that have been filed to try and 
make this provision more clear, and I 
have been working with my colleagues 
Senator WARNER, Senator WYDEN, Sen-
ator TOOMEY, Senator LUMMIS, Senator 
OSSOFF, and Senator SINEMA on a po-
tential solution that I believe will help 
reassure stakeholders that these indi-
viduals will not be considered brokers, 
while maintaining the information re-
porting in this bipartisan legislation. 
Today, we will continue these impor-
tant discussions, and I am hopeful we 
can come to a solution that will pro-
vide certainty for taxpayers and avoid 
any potential loopholes for bad actors. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator PORTMAN for his 
outstanding work, all the great work 
that he is doing on this bill with Sen-
ator SINEMA and others, and I am hope-
ful that we can get some of these 
amendments—bipartisan 
amend-
ments—on the infrastructure bill onto 
the floor. 
I 
know 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
HAGERTY is going to work on that here 
in a minute. I support what he is trying 
to do. 
I have an amendment, for example, 
that is very bipartisan and would help 
all the Tribes in America—Alaska Na-
tive Tribes, lower 48 Tribes—to simply 
get the authority to extend the spend-
ing of their original CARES Act money 
that they got in March of 2020. 
They just got authority to actually 
start spending it. All we want to do is 
extend the deadline. No additional 
money for anybody. I think every Sen-
ator here supports it. 
These are some of the bipartisan 
amendments that we are debating, and, 
hopefully, we are going to get votes on 
these because whether you are going to 
be for the bill or against the bill, I 
think most of us would agree they are 
going to improve the bill. My amend-
ment would. But I know a bunch of 
amendments—Senator CORNYN has one 
that I am supportive of and cospon-
soring. So there are a number of 
amendments that we hope we can get 
and debate here on the floor. 
But, as you know, the Senate has a 
lot of other work besides just this, and 
I just want to talk a little bit about 
that work that is going on. Right now, 
we are going to turn to the Senate ma-
jority leader, Senator SCHUMER. After 
this debate, he is going to want to turn 
to a completely different bill, and that 
is the $3.5-trillion partisan tax-and- 
spend spree that is just completely in-
appropriate right now for our country, 
especially after the Democrats finished 
up a partisan bill in February of $2 tril-
lion. 
This is a reckless amount of spending 
that they are looking at doing, and I 
am pretty sure some of my colleagues 
know that. But part of what is going on 
here is a hijacking of the Democratic 
Party by the far left. You have seen 
that in a whole host of areas. 
NOMINATIONS 
Let me give one other area that is 
really important, from the Senate’s 
perspective, where that is starting to 
happen, and that is on nominees. I have 
been coming down to the floor to talk 
about nominees, where we have an ad-
vice and consent role as U.S. Senators. 
One in particular is being put up for a 
position for the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, which has enormous power 
over my State and my constituents— 
enormous. And yet, somehow, the 
President of the United States has de-
cided to put forward someone who is 
not just an extremist but a violent ex-
tremist, a former ecoterrorist, named 
Tracy Stone-Manning, to be the head 
of the Bureau of Land Management. 
I have been coming down to the floor 
and speaking out against this. This 
nominee clearly undertook activities 
as part of a group called Earth First!— 
tree spiking, they call it, that is actu-
ally meant to harm Americans who are 
legally harvesting logs and timber. 
This is unbelievable that we are actu-
ally even debating this nominee. 
Now, some of my colleagues said: 
Well, that was a while ago; she is sorry 
about that. 
But then she came before the Senate 
and didn’t tell the truth to Senators. 
That should be No. 2—strike two, you 
are out. 
But here is strike three, and this just 
happened. Her husband, in a Harper’s 
Magazine—I guess he is some sort of 
far-left radical, too—said that fire-
fighters who are trying to put out fires 
in national forests should just let the

homes built there burn to the ground— 
burn to the ground. Ten months ago, 
she applauded her husband’s views on 
that. The person who looks like they 
are going to be BLM manager is saying 
that if there is a fire in, say, a national 
forest in Alaska and you have a cabin 
there: ‘‘Let the fire burn the cabin 
down.’’ I mean, this is outrageous. It 
was just 10 months ago. It is dis-
turbing. And, again, I ask that the 
President pull that nominee. 
I would also request that another 
nominee—here we go again—who has 
been put forward by the Biden adminis-
tration should also be withdrawn. And 
I think some of even my Democratic 
colleagues have concerns about Mr. 
David Chipman to head up the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex-
plosives, ATF. He is another extreme 
activist, this time against the Second 
Amendment and Second Amendment 
rights. He will be in charge of an Agen-
cy, if confirmed, that is actually in 
charge of law enforcement with regard 
to firearms. 
As the senior Senator from Iowa so 
aptly put it, many see putting a com-
mitted gun control proponent like 
David Chipman in charge of the ATF 
like putting a tobacco executive in 
charge of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, or Antifa in 
charge of the Portland police depart-
ment. 
Well said, Senator GRASSLEY. I agree 
100 percent with you. Count me in and 
the vast majority of my constituents 
in Alaska for feeling the same way. 
I want to talk briefly about why I 
feel so strongly about this nominee and 
am coming down to speak out against 
this nominee as well. 
The Second Amendment is not some 
lower class constitutional right. It is 
the Second Amendment to the Con-
stitution. In my office, I actually have 
the Bill of Rights emblazoned on the 
wall of my office—every word of it—to 
remind me, and others who come there, 
just how important this is for our 
country. If my colleagues believed that 
the Second Amendment was as impor-
tant as other amendments—freedom of 
speech, the right to a jury trial, protec-
tions against search and seizures—they 
wouldn’t be supporting Mr. Chipman as 
head of ATF, the law enforcement 
Agency tasked with enforcing our Na-
tion’s 
firearm 
laws. 
They 
just 
wouldn’t. 
Let me talk a little bit about his 
background. I respect Mr. Chipman’s 25 
years as an ATF agent, but when he 
left government, he has spent his time 
working as a gun control advocate and 
is well-known for his views—extreme 
views—on 
restricting 
the 
Second 
Amendment. 
For instance, on an online site in 
2019, he said the following, which is re-
markable: 
While at ATF I conducted studies involv-
ing people who failed background checks to 
determine how many later committed crimes 
with a gun—many did. 
I am still quoting him. 
This is a perfect opportunity to arrest peo-
ple before committing crimes rather than re-
sponding after the fact. 
Let that one sink in. 
Has anyone here seen the movie ‘‘Mi-
nority Report,’’ with Tom Cruise? That 
is actually what that movie was about: 
Let’s arrest people before they commit 
a crime. 
He has actually advocated arresting 
people who failed background checks. 
This is extreme, to say the least. 
And it is, apparently, not only the 
Second Amendment that he wants to 
do away with. In his recent confirma-
tion hearing, he appeared to want to 
ban all rifles larger than a .22-caliber 
rifle. He couldn’t define what con-
stitutes a so-called assault rifle. But 
good luck protecting yourself in the 
Alaska wilderness with a .22. 
He also called for more burdensome 
regulations on popular sporting rifles 
under the National Firearms Control 
Act. And in his work restricting the 
Second Amendment, he has lobbied 
Congress 
for 
universal 
background 
checks and instituting age-based gun 
bans, which would definitely not work 
in my State, and wanting to establish 
a national firearms transfer delay pe-
riod. 
Not only is he hostile to Second 
Amendment rights, but, remarkably, 
the person they want to put in charge 
of firearms is condescending to the 
people in America who actually own 
them, as so many on the far left are, 
especially first-time gun owners. 
In an interview in April 2020, during 
the height of the pandemic, when it 
started, he mocked first-time gun own-
ers who were purchasing firearms. Re-
member, this was a rather uncertain 
troubling time during the country. And 
he talked about these people putting 
themselves and their families in danger 
because they are going to go buy a fire-
arm. 
He 
said: 
First-time 
gun 
owners 
should put their guns away in their 
cabinets behind their ‘‘beef jerky and 
cans of tuna’’ that they had presum-
ably been saving for the apocalypse and 
only take out the weapons when ‘‘the 
zombies start to appear.’’ 
This is the guy the President has put 
forward to be in charge of firearm laws. 
I guess he thought he was being clever 
in the same way that former President 
Obama thought he was being wise when 
he spoke on high about people in rural 
States clinging to their guns and their 
religion. But most of us don’t find this 
funny, especially my constituents. 
In Alaska, we take our gun rights 
very seriously. We need firearms to put 
food on the table, to defend ourselves 
in the wild—rural, urban, Native, non- 
Native, all races, all income levels. Re-
sponsible gun ownership is part of the 
fabric of my State; so is valuing our 
constitutional right, especially our 
Second Amendment. 
We understand these rights form the 
foundation of our democracy, and when 
these rights begin to erode, when peo-
ple in power pick and choose at will 
which rights of our Bill of Rights they 
want to protect and enforce, our de-
mocracy erodes with it. 
My constituents in Alaska do not 
think Mr. Chipman is remotely quali-
fied. And, by the way, I am starting to 
hear that it is not just Republicans 
who have this view, but some of my 
Democratic colleagues have this view. 
And I hope that is true. 
Further, several former ATF career 
officers 
with 
whom 
Mr. 
Chipman 
served, sent a letter recently to the 
Senate saying: His strong personal be-
lief on firearm issues will create seri-
ous long-lasting problems for the Bu-
reau in the effective execution of its 
law enforcement mission. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
withdraw his nomination, just like it 
should 
withdraw 
Tracy 
Stone- 
Manning’s. Our country doesn’t need 
radical officials in charge of very im-
portant Agencies, particularly impor-
tant for my State, who do not view the 
law and the Constitution in the way 
they should. I hope my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle work to defeat 
these nominees if and when they come 
for a vote in the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Tennessee. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENTS 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing amendments be called up to the 
substitute and be reported by number

amendments in order: First, Ernst, No. 
2639; Cornyn-Padilla, No. 2602; Wicker- 
Stabenow, No. 2206; Cruz, No. 2389; Lee, 
No. 2517; Grassley-Klobuchar, No. 2500;

Sinema-Portman, No. 2620; further, 
that the Senate vote in relation to all 
pending amendments, with no amend-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Ms. SINEMA. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Reserving the right to 
object. As my esteemed colleague from 
Tennessee is aware, and as we are all 
aware, the Senate operates under unan-
imous consent, reserving the right and 
the prerogative of any one Senator to 
object to moving forward when consent 
is not present.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6044 
August 8, 2021 
Now, as the Senator from Tennessee 
made clear yesterday in his remarks on 
the floor, he has declined to provide 
unanimous consent for a time agree-
ment 
moving 
forward 
in 
this 
postcloture time period. I am sure it 
will then come as no surprise to him 
that there are Senators on both sides 
of the aisle who object to unanimous 
consent on one or more of the amend-
ments listed in his proposed list today. 
I am sure that he offers the same level 
of respect to those Senators, in deny-
ing their unanimous consent, as has 
been offered to him as well. 
Now, I am proud to report that, 
throughout this bipartisan process, we 
have produced, over the course of a 
number of months, a piece of legisla-
tion drafted entirely by the inde-
pendent and bipartisan Members who 
have worked together over this number 
of months. We have introduced the leg-
islation, and we have had robust debate 
and, I am proud to say, the consider-
ation of 22 amendments on this bipar-
tisan bill. It has been an open and wel-
coming process. 
As 
we 
are 
currently 
in 
the 
postcloture debate time, again, as I 
have mentioned, it requires unanimous 
consent to both move forward with all 
of the amendments or any of the 
amendments as well as a time agree-
ment. And, as we have seen today, we 
do not have unanimous consent on ei-
ther a time agreement or on moving 
forward on amendments, and, there-
fore, I propose that we continue mov-
ing forward under regular order. 
And, with that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, 
the Senator’s objection exposes the 
Democrats’ 
true 
intention. I have 
never objected to considering amend-
ments on this bill—not once. Demo-
crats say they want amendments, but 
they can’t take yes for an answer. The 
Democrats’ true intention is to rush 
this bill through so that they can 
hurry up and light the fuse on their $3.5 
trillion spending spree—a socialist debt 
bomb—and then leave town for vaca-
tion. 
If they want to vote on amendments, 
why would the Senator object to my 
reasonable request? The only way the 
Democrats will agree to the amend-
ments is if they can rush this bill 
through. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. BRAUN. I was listening with in-
terest earlier to Senator DURBIN and 
Senator CARPER talking about not only 
the bill in front of us—but I think 
there is a lot of merit, by the way, to 
address difficult subjects like infra-
structure. And I believe defense is the 
most important thing we need to do, 
and I generally have questions about 
that: Why we don’t do audits, why we 
don’t adhere especially to budgeting 
here, why we don’t do budgets across 
the entirety of the Federal Govern-
ment. I think, give or take, it has been 
20 years since we have done one and 
have adhered to it. 
So in looking at our infrastructure 
plan and the merits within it, everyone 
is going to find something that they 
like. And I am talking about the $1.2 
trillion infrastructure plan. I think 
probably for roads and bridges and a 
lot of that physical hard infrastruc-
ture, the need is even more than that. 
But Senator CARPER, who used to run 
a State—I used to be on a school board 
in my hometown for 10 years and 
served as a State legislator, with the 
intention of going there to do some-
thing on infrastructure in Indiana, the 
crossroads of America, living in the 
southern part of the State that has 
never had its fair share. 
I think you need to be entrepre-
neurial through government in certain 
cases, especially at the local and State 
level where you are accountable, to 
where your entrepreneurism through 
government—and I almost don’t like to 
use that word because I have been a 
Main Street entrepreneur my entire 
life and it is hard to use that as an 
analogous term to what we do here. 
Anyway, Senator DURBIN was talking 
about, I think, more than just the con-
tent of the bill. I—generally when I am 
coming down to vote for something— 
look at the principles that I know have 
worked in the real world in building a 
business or running a school board, 
local or State government. He referred 
to something that really caught my in-
tention; and that is, inevitably, in 
times like these we will then, on our 
side, revert to wanting to do a balanced 
budget amendment. Of course, I have 
been a proponent of that and term lim-
its as well—not at the local and State 
level, but here. 
I don’t think that the Founders ever 
intended us to grow a government like 
this, that for all the good intentions of 
policy that we want to put in place, to 
where we do it on the back of bor-
rowing money and not doing it in a 
way that is painful, takes political 
will. 
I will never forget, back in Indiana, 
2017, 70 percent of Hoosiers wanted bet-
ter infrastructure. We polled, and 70 
percent didn’t want their taxes to go 
up. Fiscal conservatives like me even 
got in trouble talking about paying for 
it, not borrowing the money, not push-
ing it down the road. At least there you 
can make the argument, you need a 
dedicated stream of payment for some-
thing that we most agree is essential. 
When you drive that point home and 
when you took it through regular 
order—listen to this—nearly 2 to 21⁄2 
months in a 3-month session, we ran it 
through Ways and Means Committee 
and Roads and Transportation, and by 
the time we were done, we had roughly 
45 out of 47 witnesses—stakeholders 
from the manufacturing association to 
the Farm Bureau, to the Indiana 
Truckers Association for it. 
We got people to buy in. And how did 
we do it? We did it with diesel and gas 
taxes. 
Some complained that we were rais-
ing taxes. It was in the context, 
though, in Indiana of a balanced budg-
et, rainy-day funds. We got one of the 
best business climates in the country. 
So it was within a system that was 
working. 
I think what disturbed me, listening 
a little bit ago, is—I agree with Sen-
ator DURBIN, this is a shared blame in 
terms of how we have gotten here. My 
observation, building a business, frus-
trated each night coming home and lis-
tening to the news is that starting 
nearly two decades ago or so, when we 
went from Democrat and Republican 
administrations that did believe in 
maybe having some political will—in 
other words, paying for the things we 
do here in a way that is not borrowing 
the money. Borrowing money is some-
times OK if it is a tangible asset. That 
is an investment. That kind of makes 
sense, and this has a little bit of that 
component as well. 
But, in general, when you become a 
nation of consumption and spending, 
and you are putting it on display in a 
way like we have over several decades 
here from the Gulf wars to what we did 
in 2008 and 2009, looks like small 
change compared to what we are doing 
right now. 
I don’t begrudge trying to get things 
done in an effective way. But I want 
the American public to understand 
clearly that when you borrow money to 
spend it or consume it, that has never 
ended up well in the long run. 
I read a book given to me by our 
friend Mike Enzi called ‘‘The Empire of 
Debt.’’ Actually, in that reading, it 
took a dismal subject, looked at it his-
torically, put a little humor alongside 
it—because you need that to get 
through it, to see how this ends up. It 
has never worked well. 
If you are, by nature, spending and 
consuming and borrowing the money to 
do it, I did not need to be a finance guy 
from business school and have an eco-
nomics degree from undergrad to know 
that doesn’t work. 
Even the folks who lean toward 
Keynesian economics and the Milton 
Friedman proponents that like to look 
at the money supply, no one in even 
current liberal economists are buying 
into this idea of the modern monetary 
theory. 
That, to me, just does not make 
sense. When I look at where we are at 
today talking about infrastructure— 
which polls well because the American 
public knows we need it. But then 
when we dispense it in a way that is ir-
responsible in terms of how we pay for 
it, I couldn’t have been for that from 
the get-go.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6045 
August 8, 2021 
It was also inextricably linked to the 
$3.5 trillion of using a word like ‘‘infra-
structure,’’ which we all know refers to 
tangible, and now trying to do it on 
stuff that isn’t tangible. That is con-
sumption. 
I think there are merits of discussing 
childcare, the high cost of post-sec-
ondary education, but we ought to do it 
like we did back in Indiana, when we 
were talking about infrastructure. Run 
it through regular order, bring in ex-
perts and stakeholders across the coun-
try to buy into it. 
Here, I see—and I used it just re-
cently—if you try to be entrepreneurial 
through government, which is what I 
think is on display here, part of that 
equation is, yes, you got to take a lit-
tle risk, you got to get it out there. 
But no one would put this much at 
stake and try to be entrepreneurial by 
borrowing the money. You would be al-
most certain to fail because in the real 
world—school board, local, State gov-
ernment, and especially in enterprise— 
you have got other rigors that won’t 
let you do that. 
And you cannot count on a Fed, like, 
since last year, has been accommo-
dating and basically printing money in 
the basement by buying a lot of this 
debt and is committed to do it even on 
this, as well as the major piece that is 
going to drop here in a few days. 
So my concern is that maybe we, as 
Republicans, are a little slow-footed 
when it comes to engaging in real 
issues. I agree with Senator DURBIN 
that we have been on this journey for a 
long time. That doesn’t mean you dou-
ble down and triple down. Listen to 
this. I got here 21⁄2 years ago, roughly 
$21.9 trillion in debt. We are now 
roughly $28.6 trillion in debt, not in-
cluding what we are going to do here 
on this hard infrastructure bill and the 
$3.5 trillion. All of it has merit for dis-
cussion, but if you spend money and 
consume it and borrow it without hav-
ing the political will of doing what you 
have to do in any other entity—pay for 
it sustainably, it is not the foundation 
for this place or any entity. 
I want to give you a little description 
about what we do here currently. We 
spend $4.5 trillion a year. We take in 
revenues of $3.5 trillion. That is a 
chronic trillion-dollar deficit. That is 
borrowing 23 cents roughly out of every 
dollar that you spend. And, again, it is 
not for a tangible investment; it is for 
consumption. 
Now, with what we are baselining 
into the future, that is going to go up 
to close to $1.5 trillion. And we ought 
to be looking at what is driving the 
current dysfunction and try to get this 
place back into a solid footing, rather 
than putting it in peril, where history 
has shown it does not work out, every 
country that has tried it has not had it 
work out. 
The Europeans, who have fashioned a 
system maybe a little bit erring on 
that side, have never had an economy 
that grows much more than 2 percent. 
And probably 4 or 5 years ago, when the 
Euro and European Union looked like 
it was working, you had countries 
within it—Italy, Greece, Spain, Por-
tugal—that showed that you couldn’t 
do it, and then it threatened the integ-
rity of the EU itself. The Euro at that 
time was starting to become a reserve 
currency. It impacted them as well. 
They had to go through the hard medi-
cine of getting back in line. 
So when we get through with this ex-
ercise, again, we are talking about 
something we need. But if we don’t 
couch it in the discipline of having po-
litical will, in doing it to where it is 
going to be sustainable and not to 
where it is going to put us even more 
in peril in terms of our Federal balance 
sheet, it doesn’t end up well for our 
kids and grandkids. That is what wor-
ries me. 
And on two notes, we have got geo-
political competition. Senator DURBIN 
mentioned that as well. Even they have 
shed communism. They have become 
almost expert state capitalists. They 
have an authoritarian system. That 
will probably be their limitation in the 
long run. 
If they ever liberalize their capital 
markets or, God forbid, their political 
system, you can’t imagine the impact 
that would have on us and our cur-
rency. So they are playing the long 
game. They are savers and investors. 
And we have got to be careful, be-
cause they have at least realized that 
you can’t replace the productive econ-
omy with a centralized system, and 
they are actually moving in that direc-
tion, sadly, with an authoritarian po-
litical system underlying it. 
One other place I will use as an ex-
ample: We should be looking at what is 
driving our trillion-dollar deficit. He 
mentioned the Laffer curve. We were, 
pre-COVID, at a point where I think 
was a sweet spot of where we needed to 
be. 
Wages were rising in the most dif-
ficult places. I, more than probably any 
other Senator, since I am the freshest 
off the street of a Main Street enter-
prise—it was a little company that 
grew into a national one over 37 
years—basing it on having a conserv-
ative balance sheet, not to ruin your 
business by borrowing too much money 
even when you have access to it. 
And, here, I see that same thing hap-
pening here. We will be outrun by our 
competitors who are long-term think-
ers, who are investors, not spenders 
and consumers. And if we wanted to 
really right the ship, we ought to be 
tackling the high cost of healthcare. 
We all agree, I think, that that is a 
broken system. One side of the aisle 
wants to dump more government into 
it by making it a one-payer system. 
What we ought to do first is reform the 
industry, like I did in my own company 
with health insurance, with a few sim-
ple principles. Make it consumer-driv-
en to where every individual should be 
a healthcare consumer—not relying on 
your insurance that pays for every-
thing from your employer or the gov-
ernment doing it. That is giving us a 
healthcare system that Warren Buffet 
cites as a tapeworm on our economy. 
We need something better. 
But we should have a common inter-
est there. Make it transparent so we 
can shop for it like you do anything 
else, including a big-screen TV and gro-
ceries. If you have transparency and 
you can compete in terms of how you 
shop, that would work. 
If we did that with health insurance, 
with healthcare costs, we could start 
the process here, because Medicare, 
that our elderly depend on, goes broke 
in roughly 5 years; automatic benefit 
cuts across the board. That is waiting 
to solve something once you are in a 
crisis. 
We ought to roll up our sleeves on it, 
on Social Security. And we need to 
quit turning discretionary spending, 
which requires budgeting, into manda-
tory spending simply because we don’t 
want to go through the rigor that any 
school board, State government, local 
government, 
or 
especially 
business 
would do to be successful in the long 
run. 
So I think we have got a bit of time 
that we could do this, and maybe do it 
preemptively, or we can run this thing 
into the ditch. And for the people who 
love the Federal Government and want 
to grow it as a growth business, who 
are political entrepreneurs, I would 
think that side of the aisle would be es-
pecially concerned about its long-term 
health. 
And for those of us who always talk 
about it and then seem to be part of 
the same old thing that occurs each 
year, that is being a hypocrite, because 
we have gotten here not with one party 
driving us; both have been in the vehi-
cle that is ready to run us into the 
ditch. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, it is 
said that politics is the art of the pos-
sible, and I am afraid that, over time, 
someone might argue that politics has 
become the art of confusion. 
There is so much confusion that goes 
on around issues of significance that in 
some cases, the media or the public has 
a hard time quite getting to the bot-
tom of what is a fact and not a fact. 
Perhaps, in some cases, the confusion 
is purposely spread by politicians like 
me and by others. So I hope today to be 
able to reduce some of the confusion 
for those who are paying attention to 
this debate. I will begin by focusing on 
some things that I think we can pretty 
much all agree on. 
The first is that we as a nation need 
to invest in our infrastructure. Our

August 8, 2021 
highways are often in disrepair. In 
many places, people spend way too long 
getting to and from work. People in 
business that are shipping goods from 
one place to another find that they get 
stuck in traffic for long periods of 
time. That hurts our economy. It 
makes it difficult for us to be competi-
tive globally. I think we mostly can 
agree with that. 
Bridges, as well—we have got our 
structural engineers who say that lit-
erally thousands of bridges across this 
country are in disrepair. Some are in 
such bad repair that trucks have to go 
to long-distance routes to avoid those 
bridges that are so damaged. 
We need also to make an investment 
in our rail. For some time, I lived in 
the Northeast. People travel from Bos-
ton to New York and New York to 
Washington and so forth on Amtrak, 
and in many cases, it takes almost as 
long to get to those places on Amtrak 
as it would to drive because the rail is 
in such disrepair and because pas-
sengers compete on that rail with 
freight. So we need to upgrade our rail 
system. 
Our transit is, in many cases, also in 
disrepair. We use old technology for a 
lot of our railcars. Modern technology 
has the cars themselves that are pow-
ered as opposed to being pulled by a 
huge locomotive or engine. We can im-
prove the technologies we are using. 
We are just out of date there. 
I believe in buses. I think that we can 
do a better job connecting commu-
nities through transit systems like 
buses that can change their routes as 
commuting routes also change. 
I think we can agree that broadband 
ought to be available to all Americans, 
whether in rural areas or in low-in-
come areas. Kids need to be able to 
connect to their school and get their 
assignments and follow what is going 
on in the world through the media, 
through the internet. People need to be 
able to use telehealth to get consults 
with doctors. If we are going to have 
economic growth in depressed areas of 
our urban areas or in our rural parts of 
our country, we need to have busi-
nesses know that they have access to 
high-speed internet, or they simply 
won’t go there. 
Our water systems are in need of re-
pair. We have some water systems that 
date back a hundred years, pipelines 
back a hundred years. We are going to 
have to upgrade some of these. We have 
lead pipes such as in Flint, MI. That 
disaster there can’t be repeated any-
where else, and we have to do a better 
job making sure that we don’t have an 
adjustment to the pH in the water such 
that we have lead pipes beginning to 
leach. In some cases, we are going to 
need to remove and replace lead pipes. 
Wildfires are becoming a bigger and 
bigger issue in the American West, and 
we need to have a better program to 
mitigate and prevent wildfires. 
Our power grid, in many cases, needs 
to be upgraded. It is vulnerable to 
cyber attack. It is also vulnerable to 
various 
weather 
events 
that 
have 
caused blackouts in various parts of 
our country. Fortunately with regards 
to power, in this legislation, we also 
add some efforts to look at new tech-
nologies—nuclear, hydrogen, battery 
power, and so forth—as a way to reduce 
our dependence on oil and gas. 
Permitting reform—I think we also 
recognize that sometimes it takes way 
too long for projects to get underway, 
and that adds to cost and is frustrating 
to consumers as well. 
All these elements and more are ad-
dressed in this bipartisan infrastruc-
ture agreement that is before the Sen-
ate right now. That is what this bill is 
all about: addressing those infrastruc-
ture needs. 
I would note that this is not a par-
tisan issue. It has not been. Every mod-
ern President—well, I should say every 
President in the modern era has pro-
posed an infrastructure package, the 
need to improve our infrastructure. 
President Trump, the last administra-
tion, proposed a $1.5-trillion plan. 
Now, the bipartisan proposal is $550 
billion, about one-third of President 
Trump’s proposal. Now, again, confu-
sion sometimes reigns here because we 
hear all sorts of numbers, but this is 
$550 billion above what we normally 
spend. So if you add in what we nor-
mally spend, that gets you to the high-
er number of about a trillion. People 
talk about that, but that is a different 
matter. That is the normal run rate 
over the 5 years. If you add that to the 
$550 billion, you get almost a trillion. 
There is confusion also about how 
many pages there are. The reality is, 
yes, there are 2,700 pages in this bill, 
and I think the public says: How in the 
world could anyone possibly read some-
thing like that and keep up with it? 
Well, as the Presiding Officer knows, 
about 2,000 pages of this were already 
passed by the various committees of ju-
risdiction. And some of the people who 
are most vocal in criticizing these 2,700 
pages to read, they have had access to 
those 2,000 pages, or portions of them, 
already because they are on the com-
mittees that passed them. And, of 
course, in addition to the 2,000 pages, 
there are other pages that have been 
written and are before committees to 
consider. 
Something else I would note, and 
that is, in addition to not having raised 
taxes to pay for this $550 billion infra-
structure program, this bill is paid for. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
scored about one-half of it as being 
paid for under their rules. The other 
half is also paid for by real dollars—not 
the way CBO scores it under their rules 
but just as real. Sometimes, for in-
stance, a pile of funding, a pile of cash, 
has been previously allocated and not 
used, and so it goes back to the Treas-
ury. The CBO says: Well, we can’t score 
that because it has already been appro-
priated once. I understand that, but it 
is real dollars. 
You might say: Well, why don’t we 
just let it go back to the Treasury and 
reduce the deficit? Let me tell you 
something. That will never happen be-
cause our Democratic friends are plan-
ning on putting in place a $3.5 trillion 
bill of their own which would surely 
grab all of that money and everything 
else that comes along. 
So it is not going to go back into the 
accounts of the Federal Government to 
reduce the deficit and the debt; it is, 
instead, going to be used on the spend-
ing spree that my colleagues across the 
aisle are planning on carrying out 
soon. I affectionately call that $3.5 tril-
lion spending spree the blue whale. It is 
very, very large—the largest. It is soft, 
and it is blue. But ours is going to be 
used for real, hard infrastructure. Of 
course, it is about one-seventh the size 
of the blue whale, and I might call it 
the roadrunner by comparison. 
Now, I recognize that there has been 
some criticism of this bill, and it is not 
without faults. It was, after all, the 
product of work by Republicans and 
Democrats. Ten of us were tasked by 
our group of 22 to see if we could come 
up with something, and to get Repub-
licans and Democrats to agree to some-
thing together means that there are 
some things we like better and some 
things my colleagues across the aisle 
like better. 
There are some things, if it were just 
up to Republicans, we wouldn’t have in 
there, and my guess is there are some 
things, if it were just up to Democrats, 
they wouldn’t have in there. But it 
was, after all, a meeting of people from 
both parties to find something that 
could actually get a bill done because, 
as the Presiding Officer knows, we have 
had several Presidents try to get a bill 
done, and it has never gotten across 
the finish line. So this was an effort to 
say: Let’s break the logjam and get 
something actually accomplished so we 
can deal with the infrastructure chal-
lenges that we virtually all agree 
America faces. 
Now, criticism is expected, and I 
would note that criticism is also pretty 
easy. Anytime you have a bill that is 
worked up by compromise between two 
sides, why, the side that looks at the 
other side’s work is going to criticize 
it. I can point out all the things I don’t 
like about the bill. I won’t waste any-
one’s time doing that. 
I do ask my colleagues: OK. If you 
don’t like this bill, what bill do you 
like instead? What would you do in-
stead? President Trump’s $1.5 trillion 
bill? How would you pay for that one? 
What would you spend that money on? 
Because ours is one-third the size of 
that proposal. 
So one can stop and say: What would 
you do instead? 
I know some people would say: Well, 
nothing at all. We don’t want to spend 
any money at all. No bill. Let’s not 
spend a dollar on infrastructure. 
That is, I am afraid, not an option in 
reality because we have two options. 
One is to accept the bipartisan work of 
our respective colleagues, and the 
other is just to say: Hey, because the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6047 
August 8, 2021 
Democrats have the House and the 
Senate and the White House, just let 
them do it all by themselves without 
any Republican input at all. 
I am pleased that the President de-
cided not to take that course and that 
Democratic leadership here in the Sen-
ate has concluded as well that is not 
the right course to take; that a bipar-
tisan approach was better. But let me 
note that if the option were taken to 
have a Democratic-only bill, my esti-
mate is that it would cost about $500 
billion more than our $550 billion bill; 
that it would expand union rights 
through Davis-Bacon, with prevailing 
wages on areas where they are not cur-
rently existent; that there would be 
more money going into things like 
transit and Amtrak, more money for 
lead pipes, more money for administra-
tive costs. 
We hold administrative costs down to 
3 percent of this bill. There were many 
efforts to try to raise that as high as 10 
percent. That would mean tens of thou-
sands of new Federal Government em-
ployees. We held it down to 3 percent. 
That, in my opinion, would change if it 
were simply a partisan, one-party bill. 
We made some of these funding ef-
forts into loan programs where States 
or people who would take advantage of 
the funding would ultimately pay them 
back. My guess is, if it were a bill that 
did not have our input, some of those 
would be transferred into grants. 
Now, there is another criticism that 
gets raised, and that is that this bipar-
tisan agreement and the bill before us 
are just a gateway to the blue whale; 
that this is going to open the door to 
the $3.5 trillion plan that the President 
has proposed. 
I don’t really follow that one terribly 
well, that argument, because obviously 
if there is no agreement on this legisla-
tion, if it doesn’t pass or if the House 
blows it up in some way, why, then this 
effort, the hard infrastructure effort, 
will just be added to the blue whale, to 
the $3.5 trillion. That is going to get 
done anyway, and this would become 
part of that. 
So there is going to be an effort to 
pass a blue whale one way or the other. 
I hope that doesn’t pass, by the way. 
But this is not a gateway to anything 
but a gateway to better roads, better 
bridges, better water, better broadband 
into rural communities, and a better 
economic vitality for our country. 
Now, I do admit that I do understand 
and appreciate the argument that is 
being made—one criticism that is 
being made against this bill by some in 
my party, which is, by being in favor of 
this legislation for $550 billion, we are 
going to confuse the voters, and they 
are going to think that we are also all 
just part of this big blue whale thing; 
that we are spending 550 and my col-
leagues across the aisle want to spend 
$3.5 trillion, and it is all just one big, 
massive spending mess, and it is going 
to be hard for the voters to understand 
the difference, and we are going to get 
blamed for the whole mess. 
I subscribe to what LINDSEY GRAHAM 
said. He said: I think we can make it 
pretty clear to our voters that we love 
one and we hate the other. That is 
what my Republican colleagues would 
hopefully say. That is the way I feel. I 
love one; I hate the other. 
But I happen to feel that this is not 
so much a matter of confusion as a 
matter of recognition of what is right 
for America because, by being for this 
bill even though there is a risk of some 
confusion, we do save about $500 billion 
for the American people and reduce the 
deficit over time by about $500 billion. 
We do restrict Davis-Bacon from being 
expanded into areas where it is not 
now. We do hold down some of the 
transit 
spending 
and 
the 
Amtrak 
spending. We hold down administrative 
costs and the number of Federal em-
ployees who are going to be hired for 
these programs. 
So, in my opinion, we have to put 
aside sometimes the politics for what 
is absolutely right for America. I am 
sure some people are a little disturbed 
when they see headlines that say: Oh, 
this bipartisan effort would look like a 
win for Biden. Well, it is a win for Re-
publicans, and it is a win for Biden. It 
is a win for Democrats. It is a win for 
the Senate to say that we can work to-
gether, that we have been able to over-
come partisan differences to do some-
thing that is right for America. 
Mr. President, I am convinced that 
this is a win for America. I support this 
legislation. I am proud to have been 
part of the effort to help draft it and 
negotiate it. I admire and respect my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who have worked on this legislation. 
We calculated just the other day that 
we had had over 50 meetings amongst 
that group of individuals—just the ones 
that I attended—over the last several 
months in preparation for this bill. It 
is not a slapped-together effort. It was 
carefully considered. It was drawn 
upon and built upon legislation already 
passed 
by 
committees, 
overwhelm-
ingly, time and time again, wherever 
we could. 
I certainly hope that the Senators 
from both sides of the aisle will join to-
gether in passing this legislation, send-
ing it to the House; that the House will 
address it in a way that is consistent 
with what we have agreed to and we 
can send it to the President and help 
America finally get its infrastructure 
in order. 
Thank you. 
America’s infrastructure is in des-
perate need of upgrades and expan-
sions. Twice now we have had bipar-
tisan votes to proceed to the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. 
This is an historic piece of legislation 
that will address decades of neglecting 
our nation’s hard, physical infrastruc-
ture. 
Because it is a comprehensive piece 
of legislation—a total of 2,700 pages— 
some claim that this was dropped out 
of nowhere. That couldn’t be farther 
from the truth. This bill is a culmina-
tion of bipartisan collaboration and 
regular order. Nearly 2,000 of the 2,700 
pages already passed out of committees 
with bipartisan support and are await-
ing floor action. This includes the 1,200 
page surface transportation reauthor-
ization from EPW and the Commerce 
Committee in advance of its September 
30 expiration. 
In total, a combined 61 senators on 4 
committees put together the bills, 
many of which have been sitting out 
there publicly for months, that form 
the core of this bill today. 
Across the nation we have roads and 
bridges in various states of decline and 
disrepair, a rail system that is out of 
date, transit that is slow and in need of 
an upgrade, a lack of high-speed trans-
portation opportunities from one part 
of a city to another, and entire commu-
nities that are unable to access high- 
speed broadband. If you look at other 
nations, you can see that we have fall-
en behind when it comes to our infra-
structure and it is impacting our pro-
ductivity as a nation. China, for exam-
ple, invests; four times more than we 
do because they recognize the impor-
tance and strategic value of strong in-
frastructure, and they aren’t slowing 
down. 
Several months ago, a bipartisan 
group of Senators came together to 
work on an infrastructure because we 
recognize that in order to compete 
with nations like China, we need to in-
vest in ourselves and address our na-
tions hard infrastructure needs. Many 
people in my party believe by working 
on this bipartisan product we have 
handed a win to the Democrats, but 
this bill is a win for America as a 
whole. 
Yes, there are aspects of this bill 
that I would not have included if I had 
written it on my own, and I am sure 
my Democratic colleagues would say 
the same thing, but that is the nature 
of compromise. And when the alter-
native is the Democrat’s writing and 
passing their own infrastructure bill 
that would go far beyond the bound-
aries of traditional infrastructure, I be-
lieve working together and making 
compromises is more important than 
playing political games and holding up 
a product that is good for all Ameri-
cans. 
There is a lot of misinformation 
about what is included in this infra-
structure bill. Let me echo my col-
leagues who have spoken today and re-
iterate that this legislation includes 
only hard, physical infrastructure. It 
addresses roads, highways, and bridges, 
broadband deployment, water infra-
structure and clean water funds, ports 
and waterways, airport improvements, 
and resiliency. 
This is really going to help my home 
State of Utah where we have 2,064 
miles of roads in poor condition. Com-
mute times are up 7.2% in the State 
since 2011 and bad roads cost drivers an 
average of $709 per year in repair. This 
bipartisan 
legislation 
authorizes 
roughly $2.7 billion in highway funding

August 8, 2021 
for Utah over five years to construct, 
rebuild, and maintain its roads and 
highways. 
Beyond the transportation needs of 
Utah, this bill includes additional fund-
ing for wildfire mitigation and recov-
ery and $300 million to fund the out-
standing Emergency Watershed Pro-
gram, $50 million for the Central Utah 
Project Completion Act, $100 million 
for drought contingency plan funding, 
$1 billion for the FEMA Building Resil-
ient Infrastructure Communities pro-
gram, $214 million to fully fund the 
Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement, 
and $1.7 billion for the construction 
and improvement of Indian Health 
Services sanitation facilities. It also 
includes my Wildland Fire Mitigation 
and 
Management 
Commission 
Act 
which establishes a commission to 
study and recommend fire prevention, 
mitigation, management, and rehabili-
tation policies for forests and grass-
lands. 
Investing in our nation’s hard infra-
structure is expensive. There are a lot 
of different numbers flying around 
right now but the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act is $550 billion in 
new spending, not $1.2 trillion as some 
have said. Together our group has de-
veloped a plan that is comprised of fis-
cally responsible pay fors. We have al-
ways said the CBO wouldn’t give us 
credit for about of our pay fors includ-
ing $173 billion in unused saving’s from 
COVID–19 funds, $53 billion from cer-
tain States’ unused enhanced unem-
ployment insurance claims, $53 billion 
in economic growth resulting from a 
return on investment these infrastruc-
ture projects will provide, among oth-
ers. 
In the past couple of days, you may 
have also heard about a provision that 
would supposedly allow the govern-
ment track your driving through a ve-
hicle 
mileage 
tax. 
This 
is 
fearmongering 
and 
misinformation. 
There is no vehicle mileage tax in the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill. What 
you are hearing about is a study to de-
termine how we can tax electric cars 
the same way the rest of us pay a gas 
tax. It is not a tax but simply a re-
search tool. 
Finally, the last thing I want to ad-
dress is the mischaracterization that 
our efforts are somehow linked to pav-
ing the way for the Democrats $3.5 tril-
lion dollar wish list. That bill was 
going to happen with or without this 
bill. The difference is, with our bill 
passed, they will be jamming through a 
reckless tax and spending spree that 
includes a whole host of unpopular tax 
hikes and deficit spending. 
At the end of the day, this is a good 
bill on balance. It will be good for 
Utah, and it is good for every commu-
nity across the nation. It may not be 
ideal, but we should not be letting the 
perfect be the enemy of the good, and 
it is better than what would have re-
sulted had the Democrats had written 
this bill alone. In addition to providing 
a much needed upgrade for the coun-
try, it shows that the Senate works, 
preserves the filibuster, and gives hope 
to future compromises on important 
pieces of legislation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BROWN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want-
ed to get down here and spend a few 
minutes continuing the conversation 
about this infrastructure package that 
is before us and that we will be voting 
on soon or at least the next step of 
that. 
I think, to start things off, I, first of 
all, want to express my great dis-
appointment that we have squandered 
not minutes, not hours, but now sev-
eral days. For several days, we have 
been negotiating, evidently, on an 
‘‘amendments package.’’ I am in my 
third year here and I still don’t under-
stand the way the Senate cannot do 
things as opposed to do them. And I get 
that every Senator has these incredible 
powers and authorities and can ob-
struct whatever they want, and I honor 
that. When the time is right, maybe I 
will do the same; I don’t know. 
But I do think it is unfortunate that 
we have what is really a pretty good 
bill to start with, but now that we have 
opened it up for the last week or so to 
the opportunity for the rest of our 
Members—who weren’t on the commit-
tees of jurisdiction, who heard a lot of 
this and who are seeing a lot of this for 
the first time several days ago—to now 
improve upon it—and I say improve be-
cause I am familiar with a number of 
the amendments, and they are really 
good amendments, and they should be 
passed. Some aren’t as good. I would 
vote against them. Maybe we would 
kill most of them. 
The point isn’t whether we pass them 
or kill them. The point is that we 
should be voting on them—we should 
be voting—and I know there are hun-
dreds of them, and that could take a 
long time, and absent an agreement, 
we don’t have the time. Either way, we 
ought to be voting on them. We ought 
to be taking the time to vote on 
amendments, and so I am disappointed 
we aren’t. I am still hopeful that, in 
these waning hours, maybe we could 
get a couple of them. I just find it frus-
trating that we are sitting here, speak-
ing, instead of voting. 
That said, I want to, again, express 
appreciation to the leadership of the 
bipartisan group. Senator PORTMAN and 
Senator SINEMA have done incredible 
work, proving that the Senate can 
work, building on the framework that 
was passed by the Environment and 
Public Works Committee and the Com-
merce Committee; and some of the 
work that is being done by other com-
mittees, building on that framework, 
adding some more infrastructure to the 
already robust infrastructure package, 
with high priorities for Republicans, 
high priorities for Democrats, and, in 
many cases, high priorities for both. I 
think that is the way a 50–50 Senate 
should expect to work and, I think, 
does work. 
I think one of the things that is most 
heartening to me that I have seen so 
far is not even so much the work that 
has been done, but the work that has 
been acknowledged. I mean, when I 
look at the list of organizations that 
support this—it is a list—I don’t 
know—that is 140, 150 organizations 
long, and what I like about it is the di-
versity of the list. 
I see, for example, that the Business 
Roundtable supports it. 
Well, 
you 
know, those are the biggest companies 
in America. The U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, they represent a wide range of 
businesses, but so does my local con-
venience store and the paving com-
pany; so does the AFL–CIO; so does the 
Small Business Roundtable. I love the 
fact that the Farmers Union and the 
Farm Bureau support this infrastruc-
ture package. That tells you a little 
something about how compromise and 
common ground is found not just by 
Senators; we are a reflection of the 
people who we work for. 
I love looking at the list of agri-
culture entities besides the Farmers 
Union and the Farm Bureau—but the 
commodity groups. Just about every 
one that is represented in North Da-
kota, even the Beekeepers—North Da-
kota is No. 1 in honey production. The 
Beekeepers support this, as do, like I 
said, pretty much every other com-
modity group. 
I think one of the other things that 
encourages me, as somebody who be-
lieves strongly in federalism, as some-
body who believes strongly in self-gov-
ernance as a reflection in Washington 
of the people back home, is the fact 
that the Conference of State Legisla-
tures supports this. That is where the 
rubber meets the road in many cases. 
And if that is not close enough to 
home, how about the Association of 
Counties supports this legislation? 
Now, those are the guys who really 
know about roads and bridges. They 
are the ones who are hearing from 
their constituents on a regular basis. 
And when they aren’t hearing about it 
from them, they are driving them 
themselves, and they know where the 
potholes are; they know where the 
crumbling bridges are; they know 
where the roads need repair or where a 
good road might be built. 
And if that is not close enough to 
home, how about the League of Cities? 
Our mayors in our big cities and our 
small towns support this legislation. 
That tells you they are the ones who 
have their ear to the ground. And, of 
course, our Governors—the National 
Governors Association supports this. 
My point being that this isn’t some-
thing that came from on high. This is

not some sort of an ivory tower, you 
know, contrived under the dome of the 
U.S. Capitol. These are Senators, lead-
ers, who are a reflection of the people 
back 
home—the 
folks 
back 
home: 
small business, large business, me-
dium-sized business, local government, 
county government, State government. 
Even the Association of State De-
partments of Agriculture supports it. 
Our agriculture commissioners support 
it. 
Why would an agriculture commis-
sioner care about infrastructure? Why 
would a commodity group care about 
infrastructure? 
I think it is pretty obvious. Infra-
structure is what moves our products 
to market. Oh, and by the way, in case 
you wonder if broadband is infrastruc-
ture—I know there are some people 
saying: That is not infrastructure; that 
is not hard infrastructure—you can’t 
do 
a 
transaction 
today 
without 
broadband. 
You know, even if you order a load of 
soybeans or you sell a load of soybeans, 
it is going to take a broadband internet 
connection to do the transaction at 
some point. You know, you might 
make a deal over the phone, and some-
body will send you a check—I don’t 
know—but your local elevator needs 
high-speed internet, and on and on it 
goes. 
I always like to use the illustration 
of food because I think food, which we 
grow a lot of in North Dakota—and, by 
the way, if we had to eat it all, it 
would be impossible. If we had to just 
use it all in the United States of Amer-
ica, it would be impossible. We grow 
food for the world—for the world. Hun-
gry people all over the world need what 
is grown in places like North Dakota 
and Ohio and other parts of our great 
country. 
You know, we talk a lot about soy-
beans. Remember, in the last couple of 
years, we have heard a lot about the 
importance of soybeans and getting 
soybeans to market, getting them to 
the Pacific Northwest. 
Well, guess how that happens? 
The way it happens is the farmer 
combines the soybeans after they have, 
of course, been planted and nourished 
and then harvested—the soybeans—and 
they get them to an elevator, a grain 
elevator, and it takes a truck to do 
that. 
By the way, the trucks that go out in 
the field now—these aren’t little pick-
up trucks. These aren’t even big grain 
trucks. These are big, big semi-trailer 
trucks, and they need good roads and 
bridges. And they get those beans to 
the elevator, and the elevator markets 
them, or in some cases they put them 
in their own bins and wait for the price 
to go up and protect them. 
But at some point they get on a train 
and they go to a place, like Seattle or 
someplace in the Pacific Northwest, 
and then they get on a ship from there. 
Well, you can’t get on a ship unless you 
have a railroad track that gets you to 
the port—oh, and then you need the 
port; you need an adequate waterway; 
and then those soybeans go someplace 
else in the world to feed hungry people. 
My favorite illustration, of course, is 
the pasta. And the reason I like to brag 
about pasta is not because there are a 
lot of Italian foods and Italian res-
taurants in North Dakota, but we are 
the No. 1 producer of durum wheat. 
And durum wheat is produced in these 
massive fields in the Midwest—mostly 
in North Dakota, a little bit in Mon-
tana, and some in Canada. With that 
durum wheat, again, the farmer takes 
it off the field and takes it by truck to 
the grain elevator. But from there, it 
has to go to a mill where it is milled 
into semolina flour, and the semolina 
flour is sent somewhere where it is 
then made into pasta of all types. 
But the 750,000 people in North Da-
kota can’t eat all the pasta that is 
made in the United States of America, 
so that pasta has got to get to other 
places. In some cases it is Manhattan, 
Los Angeles, or it might be some coun-
try overseas. Once again, pasta is light-
weight. It can even go by hangar. Oh, 
that brings in the airports, which, by 
the way, bring a lot of the tourism 
traffic to and from our great Nation. 
The point is that the reason there are 
some 150, 200 organizations—large and 
small and medium-sized—and the rea-
son that the overwhelming people in 
the United States of America support 
this infrastructure package is because 
they know of the importance of it. 
The other thing that I love about in-
frastructure is that it pushes against 
inflation. We are experiencing real in-
flation in this country, and some call it 
‘‘transitory,’’ which, I guess, is a cooler 
word for temporary. I think inflation is 
always temporary. Hopefully, it is al-
ways temporary. The question isn’t 
whether it is transitory, temporary, or 
permanent. The question is, When is it 
over? When is it going to be over? 
Well, one of the challenges—and, by 
the way, rightfully, so—I mean, we 
spent a lot of money last year—lots of 
money to keep our economy afloat, and 
not just so much to keep the economy 
afloat as much as to keep people afloat. 
We didn’t know what this crisis was 
going to bring, this pandemic of ours. 
We didn’t know how long businesses 
would be shut down. We didn’t know 
how long the global businesses would 
be shut down and global markets would 
be inaccessible. 
And so to keep people whole, we bor-
rowed a lot of money. We printed lot of 
money. 
Our 
Federal 
Reserve, 
you 
know, provided a lot of liquidity into 
the marketplace. That is all contrib-
uting to the demand side of our econ-
omy, the demand side. 
Well, when you have a lot of liquid-
ity, a lot of cash again—call it stim-
ulus, call it safety net, whether it is 
the Paycheck Protection Program for 
small businesses or direct payments to 
families or, you know, forgiveness of 
loans or moratorium on evictions for 
landlords and renters—whatever you 
want to call it, it is a lot of money, and 
it is money on the demand side of our 
economy. 
The problem with that, of course, is 
there is not a supply to support that 
demand. When you can’t shop, that is a 
problem. When the supply chain of 
manufactured goods is broken or you 
can’t get lumber from a neighboring 
State or from Canada, that is a supply 
problem. 
But infrastructure, see, spends the 
money on the supply side of the econ-
omy. It pushes back against inflation 
by doing that. 
How does it do that? Well, it does it 
by all the ways I have talked about, ob-
viously, opening up the supply chain. 
Guess what. Infrastructure is—that is 
the means of the supply in the chain. 
That is how you get inputs. It is how 
you get finished products back out to 
the market. It is on this infrastruc-
ture. So it helps the supply chain side 
for sure. 
But it also puts people to work in a 
big way. Obviously, if you are moving 
commerce to market, that is people. 
That is people working. Whether it is 
working on the train or on the rail-
road, whether it is working on the 
building of bridges and roads or build-
ing out the infrastructure, stringing 
the fiber optics and burying them 
under the ground and hooking them up 
to homes and businesses and institu-
tions, or whether it is driving the 
trucks or working at the factory, you 
are helping the supply side. And at the 
end of it, you have an asset. The great 
thing about a 5-year spending package 
like this—a 5-year authorization pack-
age—is you are building an asset that 
is going to last well beyond the 5 years. 
Now, when you just give cash as a 
stimulus, it may last a day, it may last 
6 months, and maybe it gets saved for 
a couple years. But we are talking 
about a transportation infrastructure 
that lasts decades—decades. 
That is why the Penn Wharton study 
shows that it actually pays for itself, 
even if you didn’t have any pay-fors, 
and we can talk about that in a little 
bit. 
Over the course of time, the economy 
actually pays back the government for 
infrastructure. That is what pushes 
against inflation. That is what helps 
keep inflation down. That is what bal-
ances the demand with the supply. 
And so there are lots of good reasons 
for us to do this. 
I want to talk a little bit about the 
pay-fors because it has been so talked 
about and, I think, in many cases 
grossly misrepresented. 
The pay-fors for the $550 billion new 
spending are real. I know that every-
body waited with bated breath for the 
CBO to prove us wrong, and yet the 
CBO proved exactly what we thought it 
would prove. It proved that where they 
can score—and, by the way, can I just 
say these are word salads. Words like 
‘‘score,’’ ‘‘pay-fors,’’ you know, ‘‘fili-
buster,’’ these are word salads that if 
you stopped 100 people at the mall in 
Fargo or Bismarck, 99 wouldn’t even

know what you were talking about. 
But this is what we are trapped with 
here—these archaic processes. 
So, anyway, we will talk about new 
spending pay-fors and what the Con-
gressional Budget Office can score. 
They are confined to what they can 
score, and some of it makes sense. 
They are accounting terms. They are 
government 
accounting 
terms, 
and 
they make sense. They identify a whole 
bunch of legitimate pay-fors, or at 
least what they call, you know, scores. 
But they also recognize that there 
are a lot of things they can’t score that 
actually do pay for this infrastruc-
ture—for example, the $53 billion from 
certain States that would come back as 
unused unemployment insurance bene-
fits. That is real money. They can’t 
‘‘score’’ it because, of course, it has al-
ready been appropriated, and there is, 
in theory—nowhere in reality; there is, 
in theory—that somehow that $53 bil-
lion might not be spent by the govern-
ment. I have never seen that happen, 
but, you know, I suppose theoretically 
it could. But believe me, it is a pay-for. 
It is real money. So they don’t call it 
a score. They call it an estimate. 
There is another estimate: $67 billion 
from proceeds from the C-band spec-
trum auction. Now, the reason they 
can’t call it a pay-for, can’t score it, is 
because that $67 billion has already 
come in. The auction was in February 
of this year. So it is already in. 
Theoretically, it could maybe not be 
spent. Therefore, it can’t be ‘‘scored.’’ 
But it is going to be real money. It is 
real money that exists that doesn’t re-
quire taking it from anybody else—no 
tax increases, no new taxes, $67 bil-
lion—and that is called ‘‘an estimate,’’ 
not a ‘‘score.’’ 
There is an analysis—I think a pretty 
conservative one, by the way—of $53 
billion in economic growth. Remember 
I talked about the Penn Wharton study 
that showed over the decades that the 
economy would literally pay for the en-
tire investment. But that is not how we 
do government, and I understand that, 
and we shouldn’t. But even the CBO, in 
their analysis, concludes that $53 bil-
lion would come back. Now, they can’t 
score that. It is just an analysis, but it 
is real money. And, by the way, it is 
very conservative. 
Now, I know there is a lot of political 
rhetoric that flies back and forth in 
these word salads that, you know, Re-
publicans like to use and word salads 
that Democrats like to use to talk 
about the same things, and we tend to 
talk to our people, if you will, to ra-
tionalize or convince or persuade, and 
that is all good. That is all fine. But I 
know this much for sure: I don’t think 
there is a single American that thinks 
we ought to fall behind our adversaries 
any further. 
We are under real economic chal-
lenges, global economic challenges, by 
our adversaries, not the least of which, 
of course, is China. China is fast be-
coming the No. 1 economy in the world. 
They are by far the largest population, 
other than probably the only thing 
close would be India, and yet China has 
made it a strategic decision to over-
come the United States as an economic 
powerhouse, along with, by the way, a 
very, very advanced and efficient mili-
tary. 
They don’t pay people to join the 
military, they just make them join the 
military. Their money goes a long 
ways. And whatever technology they 
can’t discover or create, they steal. 
This is not a small threat. 
And one of the advantages they have 
is that they have been investing at a 
very fast and very aggressive rate in 
their infrastructure—all forms of infra-
structure: highways, bridges, roads, 
internet, water, ports. And, by the way, 
they invest in a lot of other countries’ 
infrastructure to both win them over 
and then to use it as leverage against 
other countries. 
So there are lots of good reasons to 
support this bill as it becomes time to, 
first of all, finalize, of course, the sub-
stitute, the amendment that makes up 
the bill, and then get on to final pas-
sage. 
I want to wrap up where I started, 
however, and that is to just stress how 
disappointed I am that we haven’t been 
voting on amendments. There are some 
really good ones out there. 
In fact, the best ones I know of were 
introduced by Republicans and Demo-
crats together, equally. And we would 
be wise, all of us, to just agree. Maybe 
it is not the top 10. Maybe it is not the 
top 20 amendments, but even if it is the 
top 4 or 5, you know, let’s recognize 
that the bill can still be improved in 
these final hours and get some folks 
down here. 
Let’s get the 100 of us together and 
make some decisions together while 
the hours are still in front of us, and 
improve this bill so we can get about 
the business of debating it, getting us 
to final passage, and sending it over to 
the House of Representatives, where I 
would implore, plead with the Speaker 
of the House, to take it up—take it up 
apart from this $3.5 to $5.5 trillion tax- 
and-spend wish list of the Democratic 
socialists. Take it up and do something 
good for the country. Then we will get 
about the business of debating the next 
big package. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today in support of the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act 
that will make historic investments in 
Nevada, pending legislation we are 
working on right now. 
With this legislation, Senators from 
both sides of the aisle were able to 
come together to negotiate policy that 
will prepare us for a sustainable future. 
It will create good-paying jobs, and it 
will strengthen the economy. This is 
an example of how Congress can work 
to the benefit of all Americans. 
In the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, I worked to make sure that 
Nevada and the Western States have 
the tools they need to address the 
drought and wildfires caused by the ex-
treme weather we are experiencing 
now. This package includes necessary 
legislation to fund large-scale water- 
recycling projects that can clean mil-
lions of gallons of wastewater a day to 
keep water in Lake Mead for the Las 
Vegas Valley. This act also includes 
measures I wrote to help prevent 
wildfires and to fund state-of-the-art 
fire-detection equipment. New tech-
nologies can keep us one step ahead of 
disastrous fires, and we need this kind 
of forward thinking to protect our 
communities. 
I also ensured this bill would support 
Nevada’s mining industry and create 
new 
union 
jobs. 
It 
does 
this 
by 
strengthening the critical mineral and 
battery supply chain that provides key 
components of cell phones and laptops, 
electric vehicles, solar panels, and 
more. We should be processing the min-
erals we mine in Nevada right here in 
the United States, and this bill will 
help us do that in a responsible way 
while protecting the environment and 
our public lands. 
I am so pleased that this bill will also 
make historic investments in our stu-
dents. My bipartisan Renew America’s 
Schools Act will invest $100 million a 
year 
in 
environmentally 
friendly 
school improvement projects, and I 
worked to include additional support 
for our students, from funding for elec-
tric school buses to programs that keep 
kids safe when they walk, bike, or ride 
the bus to school. 
This legislation also includes $65 bil-
lion in funding to expand broadband ac-
cess to Americans across the country, 
and I helped draft additional bipartisan 
provisions to promote digital equity 
and ensure the government is being 
transparent about how it is spending 
this funding. 
The infrastructure bill will also se-
cure improvements for our public tran-
sit systems and airports and allow us 
to produce and charge more electric ve-
hicles. It will make our lives more sus-
tainable. It will bolster our economy 
and uplift working families. 
You know, I like to call Nevada the 
Innovation State. I know we have the 
technology and creativity to deal with 
the challenges of the 21st century. My 
State is full of innovators and inven-
tors, small business owners, and stu-
dents, all of whom are eager to play a 
part in a sustainable and prosperous fu-
ture. This package will bring us closer 
to that goal. 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
the 
positive 
changes this legislation will bring my 
State, and that is why I am supporting 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll.

August 8, 2021 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—AMENDMENTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to ask unanimous 
consent on two pieces of legislation. 
The first one is a bipartisan amend-
ment that I have with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR. It has been cleared on both 
sides of the aisle. It does not cost any-
thing. It is noncontroversial, and I am 
not aware of any opposition or con-
troversy about it. 
I filed this amendment as soon as we 
were on the bill and have been asking 
for a vote ever since. I am happy to ac-
cept a voice vote. I do not understand 
why that is not possible. 
This amendment is entitled ‘‘Assist-
ing Broadband Connectivity Act’’ that 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I introduced 
last month. This amendment will make 
changes to the rural broadband pro-
gram at USDA so that areas aren’t 
automatically ineligible for Federal 
funding because a project previously 
received State funding. In other words, 
if a project got State money, now they 
can’t qualify for Federal money. This 
change will ease the administrative 
burden for those applying to provide 
broadband in rural America. However, 
this won’t change the requirements for 
Rural Utilities Service when they ad-
minister these programs, such as over-
build and coordination with other 
broadband entities. 
This bill also provides more flexi-
bility with funding and resources by al-
lowing States to use funds received 
from the Federal Government, such as 
COVID State funding, to be used for 
the matching fund provision that is re-
quired for most applications. This up-
date will help rural America move for-
ward by providing more coordination 
and funding availability for broadband 
projects. This is not unusual for the 
Rural Utilities Service. They currently 
allow CDBG and State revolving loan 
funds for water and wastewater to be 
used for matching purposes. 
This amendment will help our States 
and providers connect all the pieces 
from both the State and Federal level 
to help get some of these expensive and 
urgent rural broadband projects com-
pleted. 
This amendment has been cleared by 
the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
There is no reason it should not get a 
vote. I am not aware of any opposition. 
The second amendment is also—the 
second bill is also a bipartisan bill by 
Grassley and Leahy. My amendment 
provides anti-fraud provisions to the 
infrastructure package. 
This amendment combines two of my 
bills, the False Claims Amendments 
Act and the Administrative False 
Claims Act, both of which are bipar-
tisan and have garnered support from 
both the good-government and inspec-
tors general communities. 
By the way, this amendment is 
scored by CBO to bring in more than 
$100 million, and it seems to me that is 
a pretty significant amount of money, 
particularly when the infrastructure 
bill was scored by CBO to add $256 bil-
lion to the debt. 
This amendment provides long need-
ed improvements to combat fraud per-
petrated against the Federal Govern-
ment. I would like to thank my bipar-
tisan group of friends who have sup-
ported this bill and this amendment 
with their cosponsorship. 
Now, just to make clear, the only 
business interests that have anything 
to worry about—and I am emphasizing 
this because since this amendment was 
offered, you would be surprised, all the 
business interests that have come out 
in opposition to this provision. So the 
only thing these business interests 
have to have anything to worry about 
with this anti-fraud amendment are 
the same ones that are already found 
in a court of law to have defrauded the 
taxpayers. 
Since I got the False Claims Act 
passed in 1986, it has brought in more 
than $65 billion of fraudulently taken 
tax dollars. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the letters of support. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 22, 2021. 
Re Administrative False Claims Act of 2021. 
DEAR SENATOR GRASSLEY: The undersigned 
members of the Make It Safe Coalition 
(MISC) write to applaud introduction of the 
Administrative False Claims Act of 2021 
(AFCA). The False Claims Act is America’s 
most effective anti-corruption law, but as a 
practical matter it only has been relevant 
for the most outlandish cases of fraud in gov-
ernment contracts. The AFCA bill would ex-
pand the scope of accountability to the full 
scope of corruption. 
The False Claims Act is a highly effective 
and indispensable tool for combatting high 
dollar fraud against the government. In 1986, 
Congress passed a ‘‘mini-False Claims Act’’ 
called the Program Fraud Civil Remedies 
Act (PFCRA) to provide civil remedies for 
false claims of $150,000 or less. However, it 
has been underutilized and ineffective. The 
AFCA allows the Attorney General to dele-
gate review authority, which will help with 
the backlog of PFCRA cases and enable the 
Department of Justice to take swifter ac-
tion. Furthermore, the bill allows agencies 
and inspectors general to recoup the costs of 
investigating and prosecuting false claims 
and statements by utilizing the funds recov-
ered from AFCA actions. Finally, increasing 
the payments ceiling of the PFCRA in the 
Administrative False Claims Act to $1 mil-
lion will allow more false claims to be ac-
tionable. 
The 
AFCA 
consists 
entirely 
of 
non-
controversial provisions reflecting best prac-
tices that will be applied where they are 
needed to fix the blockades that have 
sedated the PFCRA. The undersigned organi-
zations urge all Members of Congress to sup-
port this amendment. 
Sincerely,

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DURBIN
AND
SENATOR 
GRASSLEY: Taxpayers Against Fraud, Na-
tional Whistleblower Center, Project On 
Government Oversight and Government Ac-
countability Project write you in support of 
your legislation to strengthen the False 
Claims Act, the government’s primary fraud- 
fighting law. Our organizations have been 
advocating for whistleblowers and fraud- 
fighting for decades and view this legislation 
as critical to the continued success of False 
Claims Act enforcement and the public-pri-
vate partnership. 
The Department of Justice has stated that 
since the Act was revitalized in 1986 over $64 
billion have been recovered, with nearly 80% 
of the recoveries coming from whistle blower 
initiated actions. Our experience shows that 
the indirect benefit of the FCA could be 
worth an additional trillion dollars in deter-
rence. As Congress and the Biden Adminis-
tration are considering ways to move our 
country forward post-pandemic, we need to 
stand guard against those who seek to pilfer 
government programs. 
By any measurement, the FCA has been a 
remarkable success, we believe that legisla-
tive changes you have put forward will 
strengthen the Act against modern fraud 
schemes. We are confident that the legisla-
tion you have introduced will encourage 
more whistleblowers to come forward to as-
sist the government and result in the recov-
ery of billions of additional stolen govern-
ment dollars. 
We particularly encourage you to focus on 
the following provisions which would most 
significantly benefit whistleblowers and the 
continued enforcement of the FCA: 
(1.) Clarify the materiality standard. The 
current FCA ‘‘materiality’’ standard is easy 
to understand-liability only results from 
‘‘material’’ violations. The FCA explicitly 
defines ‘‘material’’ to mean ‘‘a natural tend-
ency to influence, or be capable of influ-
encing, the payment or receipt of money or 
property’’ by the United States. Congress 
added this statutory definition in 2009 to 
clarify that liability attaches when the gov-
ernment could have rejected the fraudsters’ 
claims for payment. 
Nonetheless, this clear-cut standard was 
arguably undermined in a 2016 Supreme 
Court decision, Universal Health Services, 
Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 136 S. 
Ct. 1989 (2016). In this case, the Supreme 
Court provided numerous factors that a 
court could consider for when determining 
whether fraud was ‘‘material’’ to the govern-
ment’s decision to pay a claim. On one such 
factor, the Court wrote: ‘‘[I]f the Govern-
ment pays a particular claim in full despite 
its actual knowledge that certain require-
ments were violated, that is very strong evi-
dence that those requirements are not mate-
rial.’’ 
Although the government’s prior knowl-
edge was described as merely being ‘‘strong 
evidence’’ that a false claim was not mate-
rial, some courts and many companies have 
made the government knowledge factor dis-
positive, stating that there must be proof 
that the government actually refused to pay 
the claim. This logic leaves no room for the 
government to pay a claim in an emergency 
situation and later bring an FCA case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6052 
August 8, 2021 
For instance, the government might make 
the decision to continue paying Medicare 
payments to a dishonest hospital that is the 
only available healthcare facility for a rural 
population. Under the wayward reading of 
the Supreme Court’s Escobar decision, such 
corrupt entities could use the government’s 
payment decision to shield itself from FCA 
enforcement and drain government funds 
with impunity. 
The proposed FCA amendments restore the 
Act by granting a heightened presumption of 
materiality to all instances when the gov-
ernment could have demanded repayment or 
payment from the defendant. The defendant 
can then only overcome this highly deferen-
tial presumption by meeting a strict ‘‘clear 
and convincing evidence’’ standard. 
If a company accused of defrauding the 
government actually admits to submitting 
false claims, but then argues that the false 
information is not material, it is only fair 
for that company to be required to prove 
that false information has no tendency to 
impact the government’s payment decision. 
This high burden correctly rests with the de-
fendant. 
(2.) Clarify when the government may dis-
miss whistleblower cases. The FCA permits 
the government to dismiss whistleblower, or 
so-called ‘‘qui tam,’’ actions if the whistle-
blower ‘‘has been notified by the Govern-
ment of the filing of the motion and the 
court has provided the person with an oppor-
tunity for a hearing on the motion.’’ 31 USC 
3730(c)(2)(A). 
Recognizing that whistleblower-initiated 
actions have recovered the bulk of FCA re-
coveries over the last I 00 years, the govern-
ment has been reluctant to dismiss these ac-
tions. In fact, prior to 2018, the government 
had dismissed less than 50 cases in the 155– 
year history of the Act. 
Then, in January 2018, the Justice Depart-
ment 
released 
the 
so-called 
‘‘Granston 
Memo,’’ which outlined the Department’s 
focus on dismissing whistleblower-initiated 
FCA actions. Since then, over 50 whistle-
blower actions have been silenced through 
arbitrary dismissals, in less than four years. 
When challenged, the Justice Department 
has argued that it has ‘‘unfettered discre-
tion’’ 
to 
dismiss 
these 
cases, 
notwith-
standing the statutory requirement that the 
court provide the whistleblower with a 
‘‘hearing.’’ 
By dismissing whistleblowers and their 
fraud concerns without any oversight, the 
Justice Department is discouraging individ-
uals 
from 
even 
stepping 
forward. 
The 
Amendments provide a level of assurances 
for would-be whistleblowers, clarifying when 
a whistleblower-initiated action may be dis-
missed by the court. 
With our country spending trillions of dol-
lars in pandemic spending and infrastructure 
improvements, now is not the time to silence 
whistleblowers with backroom dismissals. 
We applaud these leading anti-fraud Sen-
ators for providing a level of certainty and 
protection to America’s courageous whistle-
blowers. 
(3.) Clarify that the FCA provides anti-re-
taliation protection to former employees. 
The current FCA is arguably silent on 
whether individuals receive protection from 
employers who blackball or otherwise retali-
ate post-employment. The proposed amend-
ment removes any uncertainty by explicitly 
extending the protections found in 31 USC 
3730(h). 
For too long, whistleblowers have faced re-
taliation 
from 
former 
employers. 
The 
amendments put the world on notice that 
blackballing whistleblowers will no longer be 
tolerated. We applaud your long-standing 
commitment to protecting whistleblowers. 
On behalf of whistleblowers, we thank you 
both for your leadership on anti-fraud initia-
tives and championing these much-needed 
improvements to the FCA. These amend-
ments would not only encourage more whis-
tleblowers to step forward, but they will 
deter future fraudsters from targeting vul-
nerable government programs. 
Please feel free to contact us with any 
questions or comments. We would be eager 
to meet and further discuss how your efforts 
will improve anti-fraud efforts. Please con-
tact Jeb White to schedule a meeting.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing amendments be called up to the 
substitute and reported by number: 
Grassley 2435, that is Grassley-Leahy; 
and Grassley 2500, Grassley-Klobuchar. 
So I want to emphasize, both of these 
are bipartisan pieces of legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would ask 
unanimous consent now that the Sen-
ator modify his request to include my 
amendment No. 2535, and I will speak 
to that briefly. 
The underlying bill includes billions 
of dollars for all manner of infrastruc-
ture investments in the United States. 
However, it fails to address critical in-
frastructure needs to support our na-
tional defense. This amendment that I 
am bringing forth would rectify that. 
I believe that we cannot, in America, 
continue to spend hand-over-fist on do-
mestic priorities—a lot of them are im-
portant—without investing dime one in 
our national defense infrastructure. 
This would rectify that, and I would 
ask that it include my amendment in 
this. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the modification? 
The Senator from Iowa is recognized. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would ask 
unanimous consent that the request be 
further modified to include my amend-
ment No. 2639, and my amendment is 
very simple. It requires a public price 
tag to be put on projects funded with 
taxpayer dollars by the Department of 
Energy and the Department of Trans-
portation. It allows taxpayers to see 
exactly how their dollars are being 
spent, whether it is on an airport, a 
bridge, or any other project. 
Congress has renewed the provision— 
referred to as the Stevens Amend-
ment—annually for more than 30 years 
for some Federal Agencies, including 
the Departments of Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Labor. It was 
most recently approved by Congress 
and signed into law as part of both the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2021 and the National Defense Author-
ization Act of 2021. 
The infrastructure bill we are now 
considering will finance many projects 
across the country. My amendment 
would 
provide 
some 
much 
needed 
transparency for taxpayers by showing 
what projects are being funded with 
their tax dollars and the actual costs 
associated with them. 
In practice, my amendment requires 
nothing more than a single sentence 
disclosing the dollar amount paid by 
taxpayers and what that amount rep-
resents of the overall percentage of the 
project’s budget. The only reason to 
oppose this commonsense transparency 
is if there is something to hide. 
I urge the consideration of my 
amendment and ask that my col-
leagues vote yes. 
Again, I ask unanimous consent that 
the request be further modified to in-
clude my amendment, Ernst No. 2639. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I will accept that 
modification, but I want to add, in 
fact, I think every Senator ought to 
get a vote. We have wasted all day 
Thursday, Saturday, and now through 
Sunday. That is enough time to vote 
on a multitude of amendments, and we 
just sat around those 3 days accom-
plishing nothing. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the request, as modi-
fied? 
The Senator from Arizona is recog-
nized. 
Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I first 
would like to associate myself with the 
comments just uttered by the senior 
Senator from Iowa. I think many of us 
are frustrated that we have been sit-
ting around together for quite some 
time without moving forward. But, as I 
remarked earlier today, the U.S. Sen-
ate is a body that requires the unani-
mous consent of every single Senator, 
and each Senator has the right to with-
hold his objection or consent to any 
process moving forward. 
Over the last day and a half, we have 
seen a lack of willingness to collabo-
rate, to come together to find unani-
mous consent to move forward on both 
the consideration of a number of 
amendments, including those offered 
today, and a time agreement. It is not 
because there weren’t many people who 
were willing to do so. In fact, most of 
the Members of this body were inter-
ested in finding such an agreement. 
But it is the right of each and every 
Senator and the privilege of each and 
every Senator to withhold that consent 
if he so chooses, and that is the situa-
tion we find ourselves in today. 
So, Madam President and others, I 
would recommend that just in 1 hour, 
we will see this postcloture time ex-
pire, and we will move forward under 
regular order to finish consideration of 
this broad bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. And I do want to take a moment 
to commend my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, the 22 Democrats and 
Republicans who worked together over 
the last several months with their col-
leagues on both sides of aisle to con-
sider a historic 22 amendments to this

legislation to ensure that a broad and 
bipartisan discussion was held, and I 
look forward to a swift and positive 
resolution by passing this legislation. 
With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise this afternoon to announce my 
support for this bipartisan infrastruc-
ture legislation. Coming to this deci-
sion has not been easy or straight-
forward. 
As the minority leader said recently, 
I am quite confident that out of 100 
U.S. Senators, there are 100 of us who 
believe this bill is imperfect. I want to 
associate myself with that statement. 
The bill we are now debating is far 
from perfect. If I were the only one 
with a pen, I would have made many 
changes. But at the end of the day, I 
believe this package will do a great 
service for the United States of Amer-
ica and a great service for my home 
State of Mississippi. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that roads, bridges, broadband, ports, 
and rail are the building blocks of a 
healthy economy. This bill makes his-
toric downpayments on those core pri-
orities. 
I am pleased that this bill incor-
porates all of the Surface Transpor-
tation Investment Act of 2021, which 
Senator CANTWELL and I cosponsored, 
and which passed out of the Commerce 
Committee by a vote of 25 to 3, with 
the support of 14 Democrats and 11 Re-
publicans. The provisions of that bill 
ensure that Mississippi will get a fair 
shake in the competitive grant pro-
grams included in this bill, which total 
more than $20 billion. 
This bill has a number of other vi-
tally important provisions that will 
benefit Mississippi. It provides my 
State a lump sum of $3.3 billion for 
roads and highways, as well as $225 mil-
lion to replace and repair bridges. We 
will also be able to compete for funding 
from another $12.5 billion in bridge 
grants. 
Mississippi has nearly 6,000 miles of 
highway in poor condition, and over a 
thousand bridges are also in poor con-
dition in our State. Commute times in 
Mississippi are up 5.6 percent over the 
last decade. According to the American 
Society of Civil Engineers, Mississippi 
drivers, on average, are paying an 
extra $820 per year in extra vehicle re-
pairs and operating costs. 
No one disputes that my State and 
other States are in desperate need of 
significant new funding for roads and 
bridges, and this legislation does that. 
The historic investments in this bill 
mean that Mississippians can have an 
easier time dropping off their children 
at school and shorter commutes to 
work. First responders will also be able 
to reach those in need much more 
quickly, potentially saving lives. 
Separately, Mississippi will receive 
$223 million for public transit, $283 mil-
lion for water projects, and an esti-
mated $100 million for airport upgrades 
and repairs. 
Our ports and rail systems also stand 
to benefit. This bill authorizes $2.25 bil-
lion for U.S. ports; $5 billion for rail 
through the Consolidated Rail Infra-
structure and Safety Improvements— 
or CRISI—Program; and $3 billion to 
provide safety features for grade cross-
ings, something that is desperately 
needed across this country. 
This bill will also clear away obsta-
cles for major construction projects by 
streamlining the Federal permitting 
process. The Army Corps of Engineers 
will get $9.5 billion, meaning Mis-
sissippi will have new funding opportu-
nities for flood control projects, which 
are badly needed. 
And high-need communities will be 
first in line for those projects, thanks 
to an amendment I sponsored with the 
senior Senators from Delaware and 
Oklahoma. This should benefit urban 
areas, like the Pearl River Basin, as 
well as rural areas throughout Mis-
sissippi and throughout our Nation, 
which have faced the constant threat 
of flooding for far too long. 
In another positive provision of this 
bill, the Senate adopted my amend-
ment authorizing the Minority Busi-
ness Development Agency—MBDA—for 
the first time ever. It had never been 
authorized. This will send new business 
resources to rural areas and a boost of 
support to historically Black colleges 
and universities, which are economic 
anchors in their communities. 
And I would add the good news we 
got just last month: Mississippi will 
soon be home to a new MBDA center. 
I 
also 
want 
to 
mention 
rural 
broadband, which will see a tremen-
dous boost because of this legislation. 
This bill lines up $65 billion to be spent 
on broadband deployment, taking us 
one giant step toward closing the dig-
ital divide. 
Based on the Federal formula, Mis-
sissippi will receive a minimum of $100 
million from these funds. That is on 
top of the $495 million Mississippi was 
recently awarded through the Rural 
Digital Opportunity Fund—or RDOF— 
auctions, and the $275 million of COVID 
relief funds that we are spending on 
broadband 
infrastructure 
in 
Mis-
sissippi. 
No Senator has been a stronger advo-
cate than I have on broadband build-
out. Reliable, high-speed broadband is 
critical to ensuring rural States are 
competitive for the next generation, 
and this bill will help us get there. 
It is no secret that I have registered 
my concerns about the way this bill 
waives some of the normal processes 
that make for good Federal rule-
making. As written, this bill makes it 
so that the NTIA can choose not to re-
ceive public comment on its broadband 
buildout plans; and it short-circuits 
the judicial review section of the Ad-
ministrative 
Procedure 
Act, 
giving 
stakeholders a much smaller voice in 
the overall buildout process. 
I hope the NTIA will take care to 
avoid the wasteful and costly mistakes 
of the past and make sure these 
broadband dollars are spent efficiently, 
effectively, and with the benefit of 
stakeholder comment. 
I was pleased that my colleagues in-
cluded language to prohibit the Federal 
Government from setting broadband 
rates. This would have been an unwel-
come intrusion into the private mar-
ket, and the inclusion of this clarifying 
language was absolutely critical. 
The internet in this country has been 
able to meet the demands of the 
COVID–19 pandemic in large part be-
cause of our light-touch regulatory 
framework, which has encouraged more 
broadband buildout. This stands in 
stark contrast to our European friends, 
who suffered severe slowdowns because 
of their burdensome internet rules. 
One pivotal moment of this debate on 
this subject involved a colloquy that I 
shared last week with the senior Sen-
ator from New Hampshire, Senator 
SHAHEEN, the chief negotiator for this 
title. Senator SHAHEEN confirmed on 
the Senate floor that preventing regu-
lation of internet rates was the express 
intent 
of 
the 
language 
in 
the 
broadband title. Without this specific 
language in the legislation and the as-
surance made during that colloquy, I 
would not have been able to support 
this bill on final passage. 
Now, some have expressed concern 
about the cost of this bill. Offsets have 
been provided, and the negotiators pro-
vided pay-fors for every expenditure; 
but, 
admittedly, 
the 
Congressional 
Budget Office did not agree with all the 
pay-fors. 
Republicans, for decades, have advo-
cated more use of dynamic scoring, and 
I wish the CBO had used dynamic scor-
ing in this instance. It is unfortunate 
that the CBO refuses to acknowledge 
that economic growth will result in 
higher revenues. 
It should be clear to us all that the 
investments in this legislation will 
generate a stronger economy and larg-
er sums of revenue. Experts have pre-
dicted these investments will make it 
less costly for businesses to operate 
and will lead to greater productivity. 
For example, the widely used Penn 
Wharton Budget Model has projected 
this bill will increase hourly wages by 
.1 percent and reduce government debt 
by .9 percent. You heard that right. 
The Penn Wharton Model says this bill 
will reduce government debt, a pre-
diction not to be taken lightly. 
Michael Strain of the American En-
terprise Institute, a respected conserv-
ative think tank, has said these invest-
ments in hard infrastructure will ease 
the pressure on inflation rather than 
contributing to inflation. 
In other words, this investment in in-
frastructure will result in tremendous 
economic growth—growth that some of 
our budgetary bean counters are not 
willing to account for. 
Now, it is important to make this 
point emphatically: This legislation in-
volving hard infrastructure, which I 
support, stands in sharp contrast to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6054 
August 8, 2021 
Democrats’ forthcoming bill, which 
will certainly not gain even one Repub-
lican vote, and which the 50 Democrats 
in the Senate and a slim majority in 
the House hope to pass with only Dem-
ocrat votes. 
They say their bill will be infrastruc-
ture part two, but a momentary glance 
of what they are proposing should dis-
pel any notion that their bill counts as 
real infrastructure. 
I will say it clearly and for the 
record: My Democratic colleagues are 
teeing up for next week a reckless tax- 
and-spending spree that our country 
does not need and cannot afford. The 
Democrats’ reckless budget bill will 
amount to a staggering $3.5 trillion. It 
threatens the successful Trump tax 
cuts. It includes crushing tax hikes on 
job creators; hundreds of billions in 
wasteful giveaways to green corpora-
tions; and a slew of spending that 
would heat up inflation, jeopardize our 
recovery, and drive our Nation deeper 
into debt. 
Democrats are even considering an 
amnesty measure—in the midst of the 
worst border crisis in recent memory— 
without giving a thought to improving 
border security, which would count as 
real infrastructure. But that is next 
week’s bill, not this one. 
This bill, the bipartisan bill that I 
am supporting tonight, is the real in-
frastructure deal that America needs. 
As the Senate moves forward with 
this important debate, and as I con-
sider the infrastructure needs of my 
own State of Mississippi, it is instruc-
tive for me to recall the history of in-
frastructure programs I have person-
ally seen at the State level. 
In 1968, my father was a first-term 
State senator from Pontotoc, Union, 
and Benton Counties in north Mis-
sissippi. One of his major goals that 
year was the passage of a comprehen-
sive four-lane highway program. That 
was 1968. The legislature met from Jan-
uary until September of that year, 
with vote after vote on the highway 
bill, before finally adjourning in frus-
tration with the hope of trying again 
next year. Sadly, the next year came 
and went, as did others, with no mean-
ingful highway legislation. 
It was not until 1987—a full 19 years 
later, when I myself was a candidate 
for the State senate—that a major 
four-lane highway bill was finally en-
acted, and only then by the tiniest of 
margins in a vote to override a guber-
natorial veto. 
If you ask almost anyone involved in 
economic development efforts during 
the decades that followed, and even 
today, they will tell you that the 1987 
four-lane highway bill was one of Mis-
sissippi’s most significant pieces of leg-
islation for job creation. 
For this smalltown boy from Mis-
sissippi, this is just as pivotal a mo-
ment. For my State’s economy, today 
is such a moment. 
When will it come again? 
Maybe next year, maybe the next ad-
ministration, maybe 19 years. 
Can we afford to pass on this oppor-
tunity? 
We cannot afford to pass this oppor-
tunity up. 
I will be voting yes on this legisla-
tion. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Illinois. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, since 
the beginning of our history, U.S. Mar-
shals have protected our Federal judi-
cial process and defended the integrity 
of our Constitution. Today, the Mar-
shals Service oversees thousands of 
deputy 
marshals 
and 
investigators 
across America, who guard Federal of-
ficials and witnesses, track down fugi-
tives, and transport Federal prisoners. 
They are an invaluable part of our law 
enforcement system. 
This afternoon, the Senate has an op-
portunity to confirm a proven, trusted 
law enforcement professional to lead 
the U.S. Marshals Service, Ronald 
Davis. 
In June, the Judiciary Committee ap-
proved Mr. Davis’s nomination on a bi-
partisan basis. Three Republican mem-
bers of the committee, including Rank-
ing Member CHUCK GRASSLEY OF IOWA, 
JOINED
EVERY DEMOCRAT
TO
SUPPORT 
HIS
NOMINATION
AS DIRECTOR
OF
THE 
MARSHALS SERVICE. 
With Mr. Davis’s experience in the 
military, the Justice Department, and 
as a police officer on the beat, he is an 
outstanding nominee. But despite his 
bipartisan committee vote, decades of 
law enforcement experience, and the 
support he enjoys from virtually every 
major law enforcement organization in 
America, some of my Republican col-
leagues are blocking him from being 
confirmed by unanimous consent. 
Unanimous consent is the expedited 
process that the Senate has used to 
confirm every other Director of the 
Marshals Service for as long as this po-
sition has been subject to Senate con-
firmation. We have always confirmed 
the Marshals Service Director by unan-
imous consent because the position is 
so important and, up until now, has 
been considered to be above partisan 
politics. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
reconsider their position. At a time 
when our Federal judges and court offi-
cials face a growing number of threats, 
the Marshals Service needs Mr. Davis’s 
experience and leadership now, and the 
American public deserves his steady 
hand at the helm. 
Let me briefly speak to Mr. Davis’s 
qualifications and the support he en-
joys from law enforcement. 
After serving in the U.S. Air Force, 
Mr. Davis joined the Oakland, CA, Po-
lice Department, serving for 20 years in 
uniform, ultimately attaining the rank 
of captain. He then went on to serve as 
chief of the East Palo Alto Police De-
partment, implementing crucial initia-
tives that curbed gang violence. 
In no small part because of his work 
in East Palo Alto, Mr. Davis was 
tapped by President Obama to serve as 
Executive 
Director 
of 
President 
Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century 
Policing. President Obama also se-
lected Mr. Davis to head the Justice 
Department’s Office of Community Ori-
ented Policing Services, known as the 
COPS Office. 
As the COPS Office Director, he dis-
bursed hundreds of millions of dollars 
in grant money, enabling State and 
local police departments to retain and 
hire thousands of police officers. In 
other words, he was in charge of fund-
ing police across the United States. 
As a police officer with nearly three 
decades of experience, and as the hus-
band of a 31-year veteran of the police 
force who was the first Black woman to 
serve as a permanent police chief in 
California, Mr. Davis has a deep and 
abiding respect for the men and women 
of law enforcement. 
Understanding the risks that officers 
face every day, he said: ‘‘There is no 
greater or more noble profession than 
policing.’’ 
And he has been emphatic that police 
officers deserve our highest praise for 
keeping neighborhoods safe, families 
secure, and dangerous criminals behind 
bars. 
Mr. Davis also has the backs of mem-
bers of law enforcement. He earned 
their respect and trust. Numerous law 
enforcement organizations are asking 
the Senate to move—and move quick-
ly—to confirm his nomination as Di-
rector of the U.S. Marshals Service. 
Listen to this group of law enforce-
ment professionals that has supported 
him: the Hispanic American Police 
Command Officers Association; the 
Federal Law Enforcement Officers As-
sociation; the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police; the National 
Black Police Association; the National 
Organization of Black Law Enforce-
ment Executives; the Police Executive 
Research Forum; the Major Cities 
Chiefs Association; the Major County 
Sheriffs of America; the National Asso-
ciation of Women Law Enforcement 
Executives; the National Sheriffs’ As-
sociation; and, yes, the Fraternal Order 
of Police. 
Notably, these organizations didn’t 
just support him; they support his im-
mediate confirmation and urge us to 
move quickly. 
Consider this letter from the Fra-
ternal Order of Police sent on August 3. 
It says: ‘‘At this time in our history, 
the U.S. Marshals Service needs the 
leadership we’re confident that Mr. 
Davis can provide. No doubt he under-
stands first-hand the issues facing 
women and men in law enforcement, 
and we believe President Biden has 
made an excellent decision to have him 
lead the Marshals Service.’’ 
I couldn’t agree more. There is sim-
ply no basis for delaying this bipar-
tisan choice out of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee any moment further. If 
my Republican colleagues really want

S6055 
August 8, 2021 
to stand up for law and order and fund-
ing the police, they can start by con-
firming a nominee who has devoted his 
entire career to doing just that. That 
nominee is Ronald Davis. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider the Davis nom-
ination, Calendar No. 174; that the 
nomination be confirmed, the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate, that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action, and the Senate then resume 
legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I voted for Mr. 
Davis’s nomination in the Judiciary 
Committee and I support it. But I 
think the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, my friend from Illinois, 
could help me try to resolve a problem 
that I have primarily with the chief 
law enforcement officer of the United 
States; that is, the Attorney General. 
The Attorney General simply will not 
answer his mail. 
Let me explain. Back in March, I 
wrote a letter to the Attorney General 
urging him to conduct an investigation 
of a chemical company named Avantor 
and their role in the opioid epidemic 
that is sweeping America and the plan-
et. 
In 2020, 93,000 Americans died of drug 
overdoses, with 69,000-plus of those 
from opioids, including heroin. Avantor 
is a leading producer of a chemical pre-
cursor known as acetic anhydride, a 
key chemical used to convert opium to 
heroin. Avantor’s product has been 
used extensively by drug cartels and 
transnational criminal organizations 
with 
the 
apparent 
knowledge 
of 
Avantor officials, who have taken inad-
equate measures to prevent the diver-
sion of this chemical, particularly in 
Mexico. 
Alarmingly, Associate Attorney Gen-
eral Vanita Gupta holds millions of 
dollars in Avantor stock, and her fa-
ther sits on the board of that company, 
raising serious ethical issues. 
As I said, I simply want the Attorney 
General to answer my letter. I sent a 
letter to him asking about the inves-
tigative status of Avantor and its in-
volvement in the facilitation of heroin 
production, but have yet to receive a 
response more than 4 months later. 
In light of the serious issues that I 
have raised in this letter and the lack 
of a response from the Justice Depart-
ment, I placed a hold on this nominee 
and will not lift my hold until I receive 
a sufficient response. 
So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am dis-
appointed. At this point, this is an 
issue involving Vanita Gupta, who was 
approved by the Senate and now is 
serving in the Department of Justice 
and has been for months. What this has 
to do with the person to lead the U.S. 
Marshals Service, I cannot imagine. 
But I don’t have to imagine the im-
portance of filling this position quick-
ly. It was over 10 years ago when a 
judge—a woman that I helped to win 
appointment in the Federal district 
court in the Northern District of Illi-
nois—learned tragically that a disgrun-
tled client at somebody’s firm went to 
her home, killing her mother and her 
husband, in Chicago. It was a tragedy, 
an unspeakable tragedy. 
Because of that terrible event, we 
turned to the U.S. Marshals Service 
and said: You have a special obligation 
to protect the men and women who 
serve in our judiciary. We are counting 
on you to make certain that they are 
safe at work and they are safe at home. 
And it is a 24/7, 365-days-a-year re-
sponsibility that the Marshals Service 
has. 
Sadly, that wasn’t the last of the 
tragedies involving judges. It was just 
a few years ago when a judge in New 
Jersey lost her son. Another person, a 
demented person, went to her home 
and killed him. 
So when we are talking about filling 
this position, it is more than whether 
the Attorney General has sent a timely 
response to a letter; it is a matter of 
life and death—and now, more than 
ever, because we are in transition and 
many of the marshals are in a lame-
duck status or moved on to other posi-
tions, and you need someone to head up 
the U.S. Marshals Service during this 
period when we do our work here in 
Congress to approve the new U.S. Mar-
shals across the United States. 
It is hard for me to imagine that we 
would risk the lives of judges, court 
personnel, and their families, along 
with many others, by leaving this crit-
ical law enforcement agency unfilled. 
No one questions this man’s quali-
fications. He is a humble man who has 
an amazing story, an incredible story. 
He is asking to serve this Nation again 
in a capacity, when it comes to secu-
rity and safety, that is really one of 
the most important in our government. 
I am sorry that the Senator feels this 
way. I wish he would reconsider and 
just reflect for a moment on the impor-
tance of this position. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the dis-
tinguished Senator from Illinois, the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
could resolve this issue in the next 
hour; and I would lift my hold if he 
would simply ask the Attorney General 
of the United States to answer my let-
ter, which I sent 4 months ago, which 
we have received no response to. 
Drug overdoses have taken the lives 
of 93,000-plus Americans in the last 
year alone. Most of those drugs come 
across the southern border from Mex-
ico, including heroin, which is an 
opioid, which together with prescrip-
tion drugs—which we know have been 
widely abused—is a serious threat to 
the health, safety, and welfare of the 
American people. 
I simply want to make sure that 
American companies are not complicit 
in selling precursor chemicals that 
produce this poison, that is then im-
ported into the United States and has 
taken so many American lives. 
This is, as I said, no reflection on the 
nominee himself. But as the distin-
guished Senator from Illinois knows, 
Senators have very few tools, very lit-
tle leverage to actually get the execu-
tive branch to do what they are obli-
gated to do, which is simply to respond 
to our inquiries and our letters. That is 
a simple matter. 
This does not implicate the safety 
and security of the Federal judiciary, 
as the Senator knows. This is an ad-
ministrative position, and we all sup-
port the safety and security of all of 
our judicial officials. 
So this could be satisfied very quick-
ly and, literally, within the next hour 
if the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee would simply pick up the phone, 
call the Attorney General, and ask him 
to answer his mail. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let 
me say that this issue about this cor-
poration—I believe the Senator said it 
was known as Avantor—it was a cor-
poration which was once under the con-
trol of Vanita Gupta’s father. She had 
no—no—active role whatsoever in the 
administration of this corporation. She 
was a shareholder as the daughter of 
the chairman of the board, her only 
connection. It was a stock portfolio. 
That was it. That is the reason why 
these suspicions and charges went no-
where. There is just no connection be-
tween Vanita Gupta and this company. 
It was my understanding at the time 
that this company had discontinued its 
business in Mexico and had already 
done that long before her hearing. That 
was a matter of public record. 
Secondly, when members of the Judi-
ciary Committee on both sides of the 
aisle said they wanted quicker re-
sponses to the letters sent to the De-
partment of Justice than they received 
under the Trump administration, I said 
that was a perfectly legitimate re-
quest, and I invited the members of the 
committee to join me in a conference 
call with the Attorney General to dis-
cuss it. Several did. I am not sure 
whether the Senator from Texas was 
part of it or not. But the message to 
the Department of Justice was, provide 
a timely response to all inquiries. The 
Attorney General gave us his personal 
assurance that he would do that. 
I know this letter is very important 
to the Senator from Texas, but I think 
that the safety of our judges is even 
more important. 
So let’s press on if you wish for a 
reply to this letter as soon as possible. 
But today, let’s do the right thing and 
put the person in charge who keeps 
safe the judges and their families all

August 8, 2021 
across the United States from terrible 
things that have happened to them in 
the past. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
to respond. 
For the Senator from Illinois to say 
that Vanita Gupta has no relationship 
with Avantor, the company that has 
been selling this precursor drug into 
Mexico that is used to manufacture 
heroin—it is true, she is not part of the 
board of directors or the administra-
tion or the leadership of that corpora-
tion, but she literally owns or did own 
tens of millions of dollars of stock in 
Avantor. We do not yet know whether 
she has kept her promise to sell that 
Avantor stock. She said she would dur-
ing her confirmation hearing, and we 
are investigating to see whether she 
actually followed through and kept 
that promise. 
But for one of the chief law enforce-
ment officers of the United States to 
own tens of millions of dollars’ worth 
of stock in a company that arguably 
violated U.S. law by selling chemical 
precursors into Mexico that are used to 
make heroin that has killed so many 
Americans through drug overdoses is a 
serious matter. I would not raise this 
issue if I did not feel that it was so se-
rious. Again, I think the solution is 
very simple. But the suggestion that 
Ms. Gupta has no relationship with 
Avantor is simply not true unless she 
has, unbeknownst to us at this point, 
disgorged the tens of millions of dol-
lars of stock that she owns in that 
company. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe 
I made it clear that her father was the 
chairman of the board of the company 
and she was a stockholder, not in the 
management of the company. So what-
ever choices they made to sell what-
ever chemicals anywhere in the world 
was not her personal decision. 
I just find it very difficult for a per-
son who has already been appointed to 
the job, Vanita Gupta—and that hap-
pened months ago—for us to be holding 
up this critically important position 
over a letter that wasn’t answered. I 
hope we can satisfy the Senator from 
Texas and anyone else who is object-
ing. It is important to put Mr. Davis on 
the job. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that myself, Sen-
ator SINEMA, and Senator CARPER be 
allowed to finish our remarks before 
the vote begins. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2633 WITHDRAWN 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw Carper 
amendment No. 2633. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2633) was with-
drawn. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise to 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing materials in support of section 
40209 of the bipartisan infrastructure 
framework, the Advanced Energy Man-
ufacturing and Recycling Grant Pro-
gram, be entered into the RECORD. 
These sources, which include con-
gressional testimony, disparity studies, 
and other evidence, shed further light 
on the longstanding barriers and dis-
parities faced by minority-owned small 
business entities in the manufacturing 
sector 
that 
have 
lingering 
effects 
today. According to one study, while 
minority-owned businesses play a sig-
nificant role in U.S. industry, they are 
underrepresented in the U.S. manufac-
turing industry and represent only 12.8 
percent of all manufacturing firms. 
And in testimony from a July 9, 2020, 
hearing before the House Financial 
Services Subcommittee on Diversity 
and 
Inclusion, 
multiple 
witnesses 
spoke to the ongoing barriers that mi-
nority-owned businesses face in access-
ing capital during the pandemic. These 
sources further highlight the impor-
tance of and need for the Advanced En-
ergy 
Manufacturing 
and 
Recycling 
Grant Program.

rial was ordered to be printed in the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

AMENDMENT NO. 2137 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
want to set some context of where we 
are financially at this point. 
Everyone knows last year the dif-
ficulties of COVID–19 and what hap-
pened and the extraordinary measures 
that were taken to be able to offset the 
economic damage that was significant. 
CBO, as of July 21 of this year, esti-
mates the Federal deficit for 2021 will 
be $3 trillion, much of that based on 
what was done last year during an 
emergency time period. It is 13.5 per-
cent GDP. That deficit, in 2021, will be 
the second largest since World War II, 
since 1945. 
Now, this year, in the year that we 
are finally working our way out of 
COVID–19, though still taking it seri-
ously—this year, there is $2 trillion in 
additional spending in March of this 
year. There is a $1 trillion infrastruc-
ture plan that is in front of us now and 
a $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend bill that, 
apparently, we start in 2 days. 
Listen, I have been told over and over 
again throughout the course of this de-
bate that the infrastructure package 
would be paid for, and then, later, I was 
told, well, mostly paid for, and then 
CBO came out a couple of days ago and 
said a quarter trillion dollars of it is 
not paid for—a quarter trillion dollars 
according to CBO’s estimates. 
To make matters worse, part of the 
rest of it that CBO does estimate is 
still areas where I would look at and 
go: That is pretty shaky estimation— 
for instance, the unused unemployment 
benefits from earlier this year. That is 
an area that I look at and I think, OK, 
if you are taking unemployment bene-
fits that were borrowed with debt 
money, then not spending them, and 
then, later, going back and grabbing 
them and saying now we are spending 
them, and they are ‘‘paid for,’’ that 
would be the equivalent of me taking 
out a $20,000 car loan but, yet, buying 
only a $15,000 car—so using the extra 
$5,000 to buy cat food and donuts after 
that and say it was paid for. It is not 
paid for. The extra $5,000 would go to 
debt reduction. In this case, it is $53 
billion, not $5,000. That area is total 
debt spending as well. Though CBO 
may score it, it is really not there. 
One of my favorite areas of scoring in 
this I find fascinating in the course of 
this conversation. This bill mandates 
the sale of over 87 million barrels of oil 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Almost the identical amount is as-
sumed to be collected from the sale of 
87 million barrels of oil to be able to 
pay for the electric car charging sta-
tions. So, literally, this bill sells oil to 
then pay for the electric car charging 
stations. This bill also delays to get a 
score for this—it delays a Medicare 
Part D regulation that had already 
been delayed already. 
My concern is this: We are not pay-
ing attention to the most basic ele-
ment. This is a quarter trillion dollars 
unpaid for, according to CBO, and 
many other areas are pretty shaky 
pay-fors in this. 
My simple suggestion is this: Let’s do 
infrastructure, but let’s do the infra-
structure we can afford. If we can’t af-
ford an extra quarter trillion of this

trillion-dollar bill, then let’s back it up 
to $750 billion. That should be pretty 
straightforward. If we can’t pay for 
that extra amount, we shouldn’t do 
that extra amount. 
POINT OF ORDER 
So, saying that, Mr. President, in the 
pending measure, Senate amendment 
No. 2137 to H.R. 3684 contains a matter 
within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on the Budget that was not re-
ported or discharged from the Com-
mittee on the Budget. Therefore, I 
raise a point of order against division 
J, title IX, section 905 of the amend-
ment, pursuant to section 306 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO WAIVE 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all 
applicable sections of that act and any 
other applicable budget points of order 
for purposes of the pending amend-
ment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

August 8, 2021 
cloture motion on the final bill has 
passed by a very handsome, over-
whelming vote. 
And now we will continue to move 
forward on the infrastructure bill. The 
substitute amendment, which is the 
text of the bipartisan bill, has been 
agreed to, and cloture has been invoked 
on the underlying bill. 
We will move forward. Amendments 
are no longer in order, and we will 
move forward to wrap this up as expe-
ditiously as possible and then move on 
to the budget resolution with reconcili-
ation instructions. 
The two-track process is moving 
along. It has been a process that has 
been a very good process. It has taken 
a while, but it is going to be worth it, 
as, hopefully, we will have both bills 
very, very soon—the bipartisan infra-
structure bill and the budget resolu-
tion with reconciliation instructions.
