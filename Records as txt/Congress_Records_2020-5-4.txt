Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MAY 4, 2020 
No. 83 
House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 5, 2020, at 10:30 a.m. 
Senate 
MONDAY, MAY 4, 2020 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God of our salvation, deliver us 
from fear. Your might and majesty 
continue to bring us peace in spite of 
the challenges we face. Lord, we can 
meet these challenges with Your power 
that transcends human understanding. 
When You whisper, dangers flee into 
the darkness. The sound of Your foot-
steps causes tribulations to hide. 
Almighty God, permit our lawmakers 
to be aware of Your providential guid-
ance. May they depend on You to lead 
them according to Your will. Give 
them the wisdom to trust You when 
they can’t see the road before them, be-
lieving that You will be their light in 
the darkness. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
permission to address the Senate for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
Americans 
from 
coast 
to 
coast 
hunkered down to stop the spread of 
the virus. Office workers, including my 
staff in Washington, adapted to work 
from home. But not all Americans can 
do their jobs from home. Many must 
work away from home to provide essen-
tial services for our communities. I am 
talking about workers who harvest, 
process, and deliver our food; the crews 
who provide sanitation services and 
keep our communications, transpor-
tation, 
and 
energy 
grids 
running 
around the clock; America’s postal 
workers and truckdrivers who deliver 
mail and transport goods across the 
country; the grocery store clerks and 
factory workers who make toilet paper, 
diapers, and consumer products we 
can’t live without. 
On behalf of Iowans and the rest of 
America, I thank the frontline workers 
who are on the job, working away from 
home, in the line of duty. Thank you 
all for your service and sacrifice. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate is back in session. In this un-
usual period for our Nation, it has been 
more than 5 weeks since the full Sen-
ate last convened. As I explained on 
March 25, right before we passed the 
CARES Act 96 to 0, the Senate has kept 
right on working this whole time. 
We have monitored the implementa-
tion of that bill—the largest rescue 
package 
in 
American 
history—and 
strengthened it where necessary. We 
passed further legislation to provide 
even more economic assistance, even 
more support of testing, and more re-
lief for hospitals and healthcare work-
ers. 
This deadly coronavirus does not 
take days off, and so the U.S. Senate 
has not either. For more than a month, 
we were among the many Americans 
who have found creative ways to 
telework and continue doing our jobs 
remotely. But now the time has come 
for us to continue conducting our Na-
tion’s business in ways that are only 
possible with Senators here in the Cap-
itol. 
For this work period, the Senate will 
shift out of the ranks of those Ameri-
cans who are working remotely and 
into the ranks of the Americans work-
ing in essential sectors who are listen-
ing to expert guidance and modifying 
their routines and ultimately con-
tinuing to man their posts to keep the 
country running. 
If 
it 
is 
essential 
that 
brave 
healthcare 
workers, 
grocery 
store 
workers, truckdrivers, and many other 
Americans continue to carefully show 
up for work, then it is essential that 
their U.S. Senators carefully show up 
ourselves and support them. 
I want to thank the dedicated men 
and women who worked hard to de-
velop solutions so the Senate can take

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2196 
May 4, 2020 
these careful steps back toward in-per-
son operations: Dr. Brian Monahan and 
the entire Office of the Attending Phy-
sician, well done; everyone in the Of-
fices of the Architect of the Capitol, 
the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of 
the Senate, and our colleagues on the 
Rules Committee and their staff. Of 
course, the teams who support our net-
works and telecommunications were 
working hard day and night during 
these weeks of remote work. 
Even more broadly, I want to recog-
nize and thank all—all—the essential 
Senate staff who are here with us 
today in person so the Senate can func-
tion. Whether they be staff members in 
our own offices and committee offices, 
all the nonpartisan professionals who 
serve the institution itself, and, par-
ticularly, 
our 
facilities 
employees, 
custodians, food service staff, and, of 
course, the men and women of the Cap-
itol Police, we are grateful for your 
service, and, more importantly, your 
country is grateful for your service. 
You are literally helping our govern-
ment function in the midst of this cri-
sis. 
The Senate is back in session because 
we have important work to do for the 
Nation. Critical posts throughout the 
Federal 
Government—from 
public 
health to national security and be-
yond—remain vacant. Qualified nomi-
nees who have been held up for too long 
already have become even more nec-
essary in these uncertain times. 
On the floor and in committee, the 
Senate will be acting on key nomina-
tions that relate directly to the safety 
of the American people, oversight of 
our coronavirus legislation, and more. 
We need to continue to maintain and 
safeguard our domestic nuclear re-
sources. That is our first nominee, Mr. 
Feitel. 
We need to keep protecting our Na-
tion against foreign intelligence serv-
ices. That is another nominee we will 
be moving soon, Mr. Evanina. Those 
around the world who wish harm on 
Americans are not going to give us a 
free pass until the pandemic is over, so 
the Senate needs to overcome obstruc-
tion and continue to act. 
I don’t think anybody could seriously 
argue that filling critical national se-
curity posts is not essential Senate 
business. But to any of my colleagues 
who may wish that we did not have to 
devote floor time and rollcall votes to 
these kinds of nominations, I would 
simply say: I agree with you. I agree 
with you. 
Unfortunately, for more than 3 years 
now, my colleagues in Democratic 
leadership have used across-the-board 
obstruction to force floor time and 
even cloture votes for the kinds of sub- 
Cabinet level nominations that used to 
travel easily by voice vote. If any of 
my colleagues on either side wish that 
we could recover the Senate’s tradition 
and spend less floor time on these sorts 
of nominations, I would invite them to 
share their view with the distinguished 
Democratic leadership and invite them 
to change their tactics. But as long as 
floor time and rollcall votes remain 
the only way for the Senate to fill im-
portant posts, that is what we will do. 
We cannot let nuclear watchdogs or 
counterintelligence leaders stay on the 
sidelines. 
The Senate is going to be as smart 
and safe as we possibly can, and we are 
going to show up for work like the es-
sential workers we are. Our bosses are 
the American people, and they are 
counting on us to keep on serving. 
It is good to see the Chair and all of 
our colleagues again. I am grateful 
that all 100 of us have come through 
the last several weeks safely and in 
good 
health. 
Let’s 
work 
together, 
across the aisle, and get some more 
work done for the American people.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to consider 
the following nomination, which the 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Robert J. Feitel, of Mary-
land, to be Inspector General, Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate convenes a session this evening 
during a trying time for our Nation. As 
we speak, millions of our citizens are 
respecting stay-at-home orders and 
doing their part to stop the spread of 
this pernicious disease. Millions upon 
millions are now newly unemployed, 
dependent on the actions we take in 
Congress to stave off financial disaster. 
More than 1 million Americans have 
tested positive for COVID–19. More 
than 67,000 lives have been lost. 
My home State of New York has been 
hit the hardest. The loss of so many 
precious lives, the suffering of so many 
families unable to comfort or even say 
goodbye to a loved one have been ex-
tremely painful, enough to break your 
heart. 
At the same time, while we are griev-
ing, we are also inspired by the bravery 
of our doctors and nurses, healthcare 
workers, first responders, and other 
daily heroes—many of them immi-
grants—on the frontlines of this crisis. 
To them we owe an extraordinary debt 
of gratitude, an enormous thank-you 
that I hear out the windows of my 
apartment and many in New York at 7 
p.m. when we applaud them as they 
change shifts every night—an act that 
brings isolated New Yorkers together. 
More than that, this Congress, this 
Senate, must deliver the people of our 
country relief. We have come together 
on several occasions to pass historic 
legislation in this time of crisis. They 
passed 96 to 0, which shows that this 
body can come together in a time of 
crisis, which should give Americans 
some hope and some solace. Let me be 
very clear. Our work is far from over. 
The Republican leader has called the 
Senate back into session despite the 
fact that the District of Columbia ap-
pears to be reaching the peak phase of 
this public health emergency, despite 
the risks we face by gathering here in 
the Capitol, despite the risks faced by 
security 
guards, 
cafeteria 
workers, 
janitors, and the staff who operate the 
floor of the Senate. I want to take a 
moment to thank each and every one 
of them—and all of those Capitol Hill 
workers—for being here today, for 
doing their jobs so that we may do 
ours. 
If we are going to be here, if we are 
going to make these fine people come 
into work in these conditions, let the 
Senate at least conduct the Nation’s 
business and focus like a laser on 
COVID–19. At the moment, the Repub-
lican leader has scheduled no signifi-
cant COVID-related business for the 
floor of the Senate. Tonight, we will 
vote on a nomination to the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. Later this 
week, the Republican majority on the 
Judiciary Committee will hold a hear-
ing for a manifestly unqualified, to-
tally divisive, rightwing judicial nomi-
nee. 
When the topic of COVID-related leg-
islation has come up, Leader MCCON-
NELL has simply drawn partisan lines 
in the sand. First, he has suggested 
that States and localities should go 
bankrupt—let them go bankrupt. He 
has since realized his mistake and 
walked that back. But then, only a few 
days later, the leader vowed to block 
any bill that does not include legal im-
munity for big corporations that oper-
ate unsafely and put workers in harm’s 
way. 
The Republican leader said that his 
redline in a future relief package is not 
a national testing program; it is not 
more help for small businesses or hous-
ing assistance for families; it is not 
rescuing our healthcare system. Leader 
MCCONNELL will not support new legis-
lation to fight this evil disease unless

it gives big corporations legal immu-
nity. 
Judicial nominees, legal immunity 
for big corporations—in all due respect, 
Republican leader, these are not the 
Nation’s most urgent priorities right 
now. There are much more pressing 
issues that deserve not only the Sen-
ate’s focus and attention but should be 
the subject of bipartisan negotiations 
for the next emergency relief package, 
known as COVID 4. 
Here are just a few. Our health sys-
tem is under enormous strain. We need 
more money to flow to hospitals, com-
munity health centers, and nursing 
homes. Essential workers—many on 
low wages—work longer shifts at great 
personal risk. They deserve hazard pay. 
Each first of the month brings new 
rent payments to families suffering fi-
nancial hardship. Relief for renters and 
homeowners must be on the agenda. 
State 
and 
local 
governments 
are 
stretched to the breaking point, imper-
iling the jobs of teachers, firefighters, 
police officers, food inspectors, and 
other public employees. State, local, 
and Tribal governments deserve Fed-
eral support. 
As we begin to contemplate a return 
to normal economic activity down the 
road, one thing is certain: We are not 
testing nearly enough Americans—not 
nearly enough—to know when the mo-
ment to safely reopen our country has 
arrived. Despite the length of this cri-
sis—now measured in months—the ad-
ministration has yet to develop an ade-
quate national strategy on testing. 
These are urgent issues we should 
focus on. These are problems the Amer-
ican people want us to come together— 
Democrat and Republican—to solve. 
These are the topics—not redlines in 
the sand on ideological wish lists—that 
we should be debating and negotiating 
for a future bill. The Republican leader 
himself acknowledged that there isn’t 
enough testing on the frontlines, but 
he has reconvened the Senate to do 
nothing to address the problem. 
As we return to work under the cloud 
of crisis, Senate Republicans should 
concentrate on helping us recover from 
COVID–19, not confirming rightwing 
judges or protecting big businesses 
that threaten to put workers at serious 
risk. 
The administration has done a very 
poor job of implementing parts of the 
CARES Act and the most recent sup-
plemental emergency legislation. So 
Democrats have urged our Republican 
colleagues to, at a minimum, hold 
hearings on the implementation of 
COVID-related legislation passed by 
Congress. It is a positive step that Sen-
ate Republicans are now beginning to 
follow our request and considering 
scheduling some oversight hearings in 
the coming weeks with key White 
House Coronavirus Task Force offi-
cials. 
These hearings are very important. 
Congress can make laws but only the 
executive can implement them. But a 
time-honored responsibility of Con-
gress, given to us by the Founding Fa-
thers, is oversight, to make sure that 
the executive is executing the laws. So 
we need to hear from Dr. Fauci, Dr. 
Birx, Secretary Mnuchin, Chairman 
Powell. We need to know why so many 
small businesses are having trouble 
getting loans, while larger and more 
well-connected businesses are not. We 
need to know why unemployment in-
surance checks are failing to get to 
workers. 
Maybe, above all, we need to know 
why we still don’t have enough tests. 
Months ago, in early March, here is 
what President Trump said: ‘‘Anybody 
who needs a test gets a test.’’ 
It was a lie then; it remains a lie 
now. Administration officials promised 
27 million test kits would be available 
by the end of March. It is now May, and 
it still hasn’t happened. 
The President continues to pressure 
States and businesses to reopen, but he 
refuses to take responsibility for the 
one thing that would allow them to do 
it safely—testing. Do you know how 
the White House knows it is safe to 
hold a press conference? They test all 
the reporters before allowing them into 
the briefing room. What does the White 
House do before the President holds a 
meeting with business leaders? They 
take everyone’s temperature and then 
administer a coronavirus test. 
Why on Earth is there not a plan for 
the rest of the country, the whole 
country, not just the President and the 
White House? Many experts—most ex-
perts—say that we need far more tests 
than we have. 
If we had been on the same track as 
countries that use nationwide testing 
to stop their outbreaks, like South 
Korea and Canada, we would be testing 
2 million people a day right now, and 
already tens of millions would have 
been tested. Some experts say we 
should increase capacity to 30 million 
tests per week later this year. Others 
are calling on it to be even higher. 
Right now, we are testing only 230,000 
people a day—a drop in the ocean com-
pared to what is needed. 
We need testing capacity now, but we 
will also need it later. Some believe 
that COVID–19 will resurge later in the 
year—perhaps with a vengeance. There 
were reports today that the CDC has 
projected a growing number of deaths 
from coronavirus into the summer, and 
yet we still don’t have adequate testing 
or even an indication that the adminis-
tration is focused on the problem. If, 
God forbid, this virus comes back in 
the summer or the fall, the best way to 
deal with it is testing, short of a vac-
cine, which we will not have by then. 
Testing, we don’t have it. 
The lack of a national testing strat-
egy, the painfully slow buildup of test-
ing capacity, the gross exaggerations 
of success by the administration has 
gone on for too long. This administra-
tion needs to take on responsibility for 
a national testing regime and deliver 
on it immediately. It is, in the eyes of 
most experts, the best way to deal with 
the current crisis and certainly the 
best way to prevent a future crisis 
from growing out of control. 
So there can be no doubt that this 
will be one of the strangest sessions of 
the U.S. Senate in modern history. Our 
offices will be emptied, our staffs work-
ing from home. Senate Democrats will 
not hold regular caucus meetings in 
person. We will do them by teleconfer-
ence. Anyone who comes to the well of 
the Senate to speak will wipe down 
their microphone and desks with a dis-
infectant and refrain from the usual 
practice of handing our speeches over 
to the Senate reporters. We will wear 
masks in the hallways of this Capitol 
and on our way home. We will vote in 
small groups, and we will not do what 
comes so naturally to every public offi-
cial—shake hands. 
The American people are watching us 
right now. They expect us to do our 
jobs. They expect us to come together 
to address the issues that really mat-
ter. We cannot—cannot—and must not 
merely go back to business as usual in 
the Senate. It is not business as usual 
out in our country. Leader MCCONNELL 
must hear this. 
Right now, Leader MCCONNELL and 
the Republican majority should shelve 
the divisive judicial fights and the par-
tisan, divisive redlines. Let’s focus on 
working together to heal the sick, em-
ploy the unemployed, stabilize the 
economy, and making sure the admin-
istration properly executes the laws we 
pass so that we can prepare our coun-
try for the day when we will finally, 
God willing, return to normal. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
learning the etiquette of the mask as 
we try to make certain we set a good 
example for our country that is very 
attentive to the public healthcare cri-
sis we face. 
I listened carefully to the remarks of 
the Republican majority leader. He 
spoke about the reconvening of the 
Senate this day, and he talked about 
the work that we achieved a few weeks 
ago in passing the CARES Act—$2.2 
trillion in rescue funds for America— 
by 96 to nothing. Then, by a voice vote, 
we passed $484 billion more—almost 
$2.7 trillion. That is an amount that is 
far in excess of the annual Federal 
budget of the United States of America 
for domestic discretionary spending, 
and we did it in a matter of days and 
weeks. We knew that we were facing, 
as the President characterized it, a na-
tional emergency, and we still do. 
The Senate is here today because, 
against medical advice, the majority 
leader has brought us back to Wash-
ington. We know what the standard is

in the District of Columbia for the peo-
ple who live here—to stay home; not to 
meet in groups; to work away from 
your normal working place to protect 
yourself, your family, and everyone 
else. Yet we are back in town. The ma-
jority leader tells us we don’t take 
days off. He says we are here to do the 
Nation’s business, which can only be 
done—that it is only possible—when we 
are here. He talks about taking careful 
steps back. I have been waiting for the 
majority leader to announce what the 
business of this week will be. Boy, 
there are a lot of things we should be 
doing. 
I know, back home, from the endless 
telephone conference calls that I am 
involved in and from the comments by 
my friends and neighbors in Illinois, 
that there are many unanswered ques-
tions which they would like this Con-
gress to address. We have been waiting 
carefully, expectantly, for the majority 
leader to announce what we are doing 
this week that merits this return. It is 
not just because Members of the Sen-
ate are being asked to come back. Lis-
ten, that is what we ran to do. We 
promised the people of our States that 
we would be there to do the business of 
the Senate and the Nation when called 
upon. Certainly, I want to keep that 
promise. All of us do. Yet it is appro-
priate to ask exactly what it is this 
week that we will be doing. 
There is a noncontroversial nomina-
tion that will be before us in a matter 
of 2 hours, which is likely to pass by an 
overwhelming vote. That can’t be the 
reason. There must be more, but what 
is it? There are lots of things which the 
majority leader could bring us back to 
do. It appears one of the things he is 
most intent on is to make certain that 
we consider the nomination of a young 
district court judge from the Common-
wealth of Kentucky. This individual 
was nominated last year to serve on 
the district court in the Common-
wealth of Kentucky. His name is Justin 
Walker. 
Justin Walker has a distinction. He 
is one of nine Presidential nominees 
who has been sent to the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee by the White House 
who has been judged ‘‘not qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. It was 
the American Bar Association that 
said his absence of any significant trial 
experience disqualified him to serve at 
the lowest Federal court—a lifetime 
appointment, make no mistake. Yet it 
seems Justin Walker is well connected 
with the majority leader by his having 
served on his staff, at least as an in-
tern, but it may be more—I am not 
sure—and other connections that I am 
not aware of. It is enough that his 
nomination has become a priority for 
the U.S. Senate, which is interesting. 
Despite any ‘‘career’’ on the Federal 
district court of less than 6 or 8 months 
and despite the fact that he has had no 
trial experience by which to take that 
job, 
the 
majority 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, wants this man to be ele-
vated to the second highest court in 
the land—the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
I don’t understand it. It is certainly 
hard to argue that this is part of a re-
sponse to a national health emergency 
in America. It has nothing to do with 
it. It is a political decision, clearly, to 
elevate this man—of all of the mem-
bers of the Federal district court bench 
across the Nation—to be next in line to 
be considered for the Supreme Court. I 
hope he has seen a Federal trial in the 
time he has served on the district court 
in Kentucky. I guess we will find out in 
the hearing that has been called for on 
Wednesday of this week. 
So, when the majority leader comes 
to us and says we have important 
nominations that deal with national 
security, I am sorry, but Judge Walker 
is not one of them. What we have in his 
confirmation hearing is a political de-
cision for political advancement at the 
risk of this Senate and the hundreds of 
people who are working here today be-
cause we have been called back. 
What else could the Senate Judiciary 
Committee do other than to entertain 
Senator MCCONNELL’s former intern to 
be raised to the second highest court in 
the land? There are a number of things 
we might consider. 
I think one is contact tracing. Con-
tact tracing is going to be the key to 
opening our economy in America. Con-
tact tracing says, if you have been ex-
posed to a person who has tested posi-
tive for COVID–19, that we have ways— 
technological ways and other ways—to 
trace you and notify you. That also 
raises questions about information and 
privacy, which is one of the issues the 
Senate Judiciary Committee considers. 
There is the Bureau of Prisons. Cur-
rently, at the Bureau of Prisons, there 
is a raging conflict because there is 
raging infection. This is not the only 
correctional 
institution 
that 
faces 
that, but it does. Guards, correction of-
ficers, as well as the inmates them-
selves, are at risk because COVID–19 is 
in the ranks of those serving time in 
our prisons. Many States—even the 
Federal Government to some extent— 
are considering the appropriate policy 
to keep America safe but also to treat 
these individuals with fairness, espe-
cially those who are working for the 
Federal Government and are doing 
what we ask them to do. That is under 
the jurisdiction of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. 
Instead of this Kentucky nominee of 
Senator MCCONNELL’s, whom he wants 
to move up quickly to the second high-
est court of the land, shouldn’t we be 
asking basic questions about the poli-
cies of the Bureau of Prisons? 
There are immigration issues too. It 
is interesting when you take a look at 
the spokespersons when it comes to 
medicine. So many of them—not all of 
them by any means—are new immi-
grants to America. I salute all of our 
healthcare heroes. We have signs in our 
yard at home, and others around the 
neighborhood do as well. We can’t 
thank these men and women enough 
for going to work every day and risk-
ing their lives every day to keep us 
safe—doctors, nurses, lab technicians, 
those working in nursing homes—and 
to treat those who are infected and 
save the lives of the people we love. 
As you listen on television to their 
comments about the risks they are 
taking and the costs they are paying 
with their families and others, I note 
how many of them are new immigrants 
to this country. It is no surprise. Many 
of these people—well-trained and edu-
cated—come to the United States for 
opportunities they can’t get in their 
home countries, and in terms of our 
healthcare, we prosper because of that 
decision. Yet, when it comes to deci-
sions by the U.S. Senate in dealing 
with immigration and healthcare, you 
would think that we would have no use 
for these people. 
Take the DACA protectees—those 
who, under President Obama’s Execu-
tive order, have the protection of 
DACA so they will not be deported 
from the United States and can legally 
work in the United States. These are 
important people. I tried, with Senator 
GRAHAM, in a bipartisan amendment 
back 6 weeks ago, to say that their 
legal status in America would be re-
spected at least until the end of this 
calendar year so they could continue to 
be here without the fear of deportation, 
and it was stopped. 
According to Senator GRAHAM, the 
comment from one of his colleagues 
was: There go DURBIN
and GRAHAM 
again, working on the Dream Act. 
Yes, I am. I am still working on the 
Dream Act. Do you know why I am 
doing this? It is that, out of the 780,000 
DACA protectees, at least 41,000 of 
them are in the healthcare field today. 
When it come to those here in the 
United States who have temporary pro-
tected status—at least 11,000 of them— 
are we ready to say publicly what some 
Members of the Senate say privately: 
‘‘Let them leave. We don’t need them’’? 
I am not going to say that. I know bet-
ter, and so do families across America. 
Thank goodness for these healthcare 
heroes—those 
born 
in 
the 
United 
States and those not born in the United 
States—who have come here to help us 
through this public healthcare crisis. 
Immigration is an issue for the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. Will there be a 
hearing this week? None have been 
posted that relate to this COVID–19 
challenge. We haven’t even addressed 
it. 
What about profiteering? Wouldn’t 
that be an interesting issue for us to 
have a hearing on in the Senate Judici-
ary Committee—violations of current 
law? As I mentioned, I spent my time 
in telephone conference with a lot of 
people 
who 
are 
buying 
protective 
equipment—administrators 
of 
hos-
pitals, clinics, and medical profes-
sionals themselves. They report what 
is happening. It came from Fairfield, 
IL, which is a smaller community in 
downstate Illinois, where the hospital 
administrator said: Senator, we used to

pay 22 cents for a surgical gown at this 
hospital. The price is now between $11 
and $20 apiece. Somebody is ripping 
them off. They know it, I know it, and 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
should know it too. 
This is another issue we could take 
up and that I hope we would consider. 
Instead, we have MCCONNELL’s nominee 
for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which he considers to be vital national 
business. I don’t see it that way. What 
I see is a lot of people here who are 
gathered in the Capitol, doing their 
jobs as they were hired to do and as 
they are dedicated to perform—at risk. 
I am prepared to be here because that 
is what I ran for office to do, but I 
would hope it would be for something 
substantive in order to deal with real 
issues of national security and, cer-
tainly, issues related to this national 
health emergency. 
The District of Columbia and the 
States on either side of the District— 
Maryland and Virginia—all continue to 
record new cases of COVID infection 
and death. They have not seen a 2-week 
decline in new COVID cases, which the 
White House announced as a guideline 
a few weeks ago, that is necessary to 
begin the first phase of reopening. The 
opposite is true. In this Washington 
Metropolitan Area, where we have been 
called in to work today, we find a 
COVID hotspot. In the week ending 
last Thursday, the District, Maryland, 
and 
Virginia 
recorded 
20,000 
new 
COVID cases—a staggering amount of 
sickness and suffering. All three juris-
dictions remain under stay-at-home or-
ders to try to curb the spread of this 
deadly virus in order to save lives and 
ease the burden on our exhausted med-
ical workers. 
My State of Illinois also remains 
under a stay-at-home order as do more 
than half of the States. Not one State 
in America has yet to meet the first re-
quirement of safety to reopen our 
schools and businesses and commu-
nities in this pandemic. That first re-
quirement is a 2-week decline in new 
infections. Like millions of Americans, 
Members of the Senate and our staffs 
have been working from home for the 
last 6 weeks to try to save lives and 
keep our health system from col-
lapsing. 
I do have to take exception to the 
statement made by Senator MCCON-
NELL when he said: Across America, 
you don’t get to take days off. I have 
been on the phone every single day— 
my colleagues, the same—talking to 
people in their own home States, deal-
ing with challenges and issues that 
face businesses and labor unions and 
charities and hospitals. The list is so 
long that I don’t know where to start 
or where to end. Yet he would suggest 
I was home, taking a day off. 
Out of my home, Senator MCCON-
NELL, my kitchen became my surrogate 
office, and I am sure many Senators 
will say the same. I worked as hard 
there as I do in this building—maybe 
harder on some days. So we didn’t take 
days off. We have negotiated a nearly 
half-trillion-dollar COVID emergency 
aid package for our home States—a life 
support package to provide much need-
ed resources for testing and for our he-
roic healthcare workers. 
When you take a look at the issue of 
lost revenue, I spoke to the mayor of 
the District of Columbia a few minutes 
ago. She talked about revenue that is, 
obviously, lost to her—hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars that she has to face in 
the next budget—all related to the 
COVID and all related to the downturn 
in our economy. The same thing is true 
in my State and virtually every other 
State. 
This COVID crisis has taken its toll 
on business activity, on the attendance 
at events, on purchases. It means less 
revenue going into the coffers of States 
and local governments. We provided 
$150 billion for this purpose in the 
original CARES bill. Many of us be-
lieve we need to stand up for them 
again. You can’t give speeches on the 
floor about your respect for the police 
and first responders and firefighters 
and then say it is a darned shame that 
the people who employ them will not 
be able to pay them in the months 
ahead. 
As for this notion of declaring bank-
ruptcy, what an economic disaster that 
would be if States and local govern-
ments were declaring bankruptcy right 
and left, not to mention the real hard-
ship it would cause among first re-
sponders and those healthcare workers, 
including nurses, whom we value so 
much. So many of them who are em-
ployed by State and local governments 
would suffer if the suggestion of bank-
ruptcy went forward. 
We can legislate without violating 
public health guidelines and risking 
making this pandemic worse. So the 
urgent business of the Senate should be 
the COVID challenge that we face ev-
erywhere. In our coming back to Wash-
ington, why isn’t that a priority that 
has been announced? At this moment, 
we don’t know what will happen with 
the Senate’s agenda tomorrow or in the 
2 or 3 days after. If it relates to COVID– 
19, count me in. If it relates to true na-
tional security, count me in. Yet, if we 
are just coming here because of a 
promise made to a 38-year-old Federal 
judge in Kentucky, it doesn’t meet the 
test. As I mentioned before, this nomi-
nee was judged ‘‘not qualified,’’ and he 
has made statements that are openly 
hostile to the Affordable Care Act, 
which I would like to address for a mo-
ment. 
When we passed the Affordable Care 
Act about 10 years ago, the goal was to 
reduce the number of Americans who 
had no health insurance. It was suc-
cessful. In the State of Illinois, it cut 
in half the number of uninsured—peo-
ple without health insurance. Its crit-
ics didn’t vote for it; have not come up 
with an alternative to it; and like this 
Justin Walker, the Federal judge in 
Kentucky, have been openly contemp-
tuous of the notion of moving our Na-
tion toward full healthcare coverage. I 
don’t think that argument is as com-
pelling today, under the current cir-
cumstances, if it ever were. All of us 
appreciate the need for a real safety 
net. All of us understand, without real 
health insurance protection at this mo-
ment in history, the people we love— 
our children, our spouses, our parents— 
would be at risk because they wouldn’t 
have 
access 
to 
good, 
quality 
healthcare. 
This is a situation in which this judi-
cial nominee—Mr. WALKER, who was 
found ‘‘not qualified’’ for the Federal 
district court position—is now openly 
contemptuous of the Affordable Care 
Act and argues that it should be elimi-
nated at this moment in history—the 
assurance of healthcare and health in-
surance protection. Is he the person we 
want on the second highest court in 
the land? In the midst of the most 
deadly health crisis and the most dev-
astating economic catastrophe of our 
times, the majority leader’s agenda re-
mains unchanged—to fill the Federal 
bench at any cost. 
The Trump administration’s response 
to the COVID–19 crisis has shocked 
many people. America has 5 percent of 
the world’s population. Yet we have 
one-third of the world’s COVID infec-
tions and more than 25 percent of the 
COVID deaths. Let me say that again. 
America has 5 percent of the world’s 
population and more than 25 percent of 
the COVID deaths. As of this morning, 
67,682 Americans have died of this fero-
cious virus. They include my friends, 
people I know, and members of my 
family. In my State of Illinois, we have 
lost 2,618 men, women, and children to 
this pandemic. When the Senate left 
Washington, DC, 6 weeks ago to work 
from home, there were 5,000 COVID in-
fections in my State. There are more 
than 50,000 today. We are No. 2 in test-
ing, so our numbers, I think, are more 
accurate than in many other States. 
Americans feel great anxiety and 
sadness, but these healthcare profes-
sionals keep our heads up and our focus 
very clear. These essential heroes are 
doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, 
pharmacists, and the men and women 
who make sure there is food in these 
hospitals and that the floors are clean. 
They include postal workers, grocery 
store clerks, truckdrivers, law enforce-
ment officers, teachers who continue to 
teach our kids and help to keep them 
safe. They are all part of this national 
effort. I would say that the notion of 
homeschooling, or e-schooling, which is 
now very common across America, has 
renewed the appreciation of many par-
ents for what the teachers are doing 
every single day to help their kids. 
In my State and every State, people 
of color have suffered more than their 
share of COVID sickness and death, 
partly because of longstanding health 
inequities that leave people of color 
with more preexisting health condi-
tions, partly because of barriers to 
healthcare, and partly because Black 
and Brown people fill so many jobs

May 4, 2020 
that are deemed essential. One major 
hospital in Chicago told me that half 
the people who died from COVID–19 in 
their hospital were uninsured, many of 
them Hispanic. They are people who 
may or may not have health insurance. 
They are desperate to work and earn a 
living. Some of them are afraid that 
they or some member of their family 
may be deported if they show up to a 
hospital to report themselves sick, so 
they wait until it is literally too late, 
and they die. 
We have seen our economy shut down 
and a lot of hardship as a result. Many 
owners of businesses, restaurants, and 
others have talked to me and others in 
the Senate about how soon we can re-
open. But most of them, not all of 
them, most of them understand that 
going through this kind of shutdown of 
our economy and our personal lives is 
bad—bad if we do it one time; it is hor-
rible to think about doing it a second 
time if we reopen too soon in the wrong 
way. 
In my State, 830,000 people filed for 
unemployment 
insurance 
between 
March 1 and April 25. They are among 
the 30 million Americans who filed for 
unemployment since COVID came to 
America—40 million. That is the fast-
est, deepest loss of jobs we have ever 
seen. To reopen our States and Nation 
before we have done the hard and care-
ful work required to open safely only 
risks more infection, more death, more 
lost jobs, and more economic hardship. 
Reopening before we can reopen safely 
risks overwhelming our hospitals and 
ICUs. We need to listen to public 
health experts, the doctors and the 
nurses, many of whom have worked 
past exhaustion. We need to be respon-
sible and not give in to chance on the 
street. 
What is the essential work that the 
Senate should be doing? Investigating 
why we do not have enough testing in 
this country that is essential to re-
opening the economy and working with 
State, local, and Tribal governments to 
help them hire and train the estimated 
300,000 contact tracers needed to reopen 
America safely. Rather than forcing 
States to bid against each other, we 
have to plead with the President to use 
his authority under the Defense Pro-
duction Act to produce here in America 
the respirators and other PPE that is 
essential for workers and their fami-
lies. We have to provide oversight for 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
make sure those loans are going to 
small business as we originally in-
tended and not to wealthy hedge fund 
operators. We ought to be working to 
shore up the U.S. Postal Service, an es-
sential public service created under the 
Constitution. What a reminder it has 
been to all of us staying at home, 
watching that letter carrier come by 
every single day. It is a bright spot, 
with his big smile, greeted by every-
body on my street with gratitude for 
his continuing work day in and day 
out. That is what our Postal Service is. 
For them to be degraded and insulted 
by the critics is totally unfair—totally 
unfair. 
We ought to be making plans to en-
sure that every American voter can 
vote by mail in the November election, 
given the likelihood that this lethal 
virus will still be threatening us. If 
this Senate is going to gather as a body 
in this pandemic against the medical 
advice of some and the sound judgment 
of others, let’s make sure our work is 
essential. We are still waiting for a re-
port from our Republican majority 
leader about the agenda that brought 
us to Washington and that brings us 
here this week, ready to work, ready to 
address the COVID–19 crisis that faces 
our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT J. FEITEL 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
clean and constant nuclear energy is 
one of the key pillars of America’s en-
ergy 
security. 
Nuclear 
powerplants 
supply 20 percent of our Nation’s elec-
tricity and more than 50 percent of our 
clean energy. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
is the independent Federal agency that 
regulates these powerplants to protect 
public health and safety. It is a very 
important job. These independent regu-
latory structures and this specific one 
has successfully benefited the Amer-
ican people for decades by ensuring the 
safe operation of our nuclear reactors. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion’s inspector general is responsible 
for detecting and preventing waste, 
fraud, and abuse, as well as mis-
management at the Commission. 
President Trump has nominated Mr. 
Robert Feitel to serve as inspector gen-
eral of the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission. He did that last October. Mr. 
Feitel has been reported out of the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee by unanimous vote in Decem-
ber. Today the Senate will vote to con-
firm him. 
Mr. Feitel is well qualified. He brings 
a wealth of experience and expertise to 
this important position. Mr. Feitel has 
spent more than 25 years as an attor-
ney at the Department of Justice and 
at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
During his long career Mr. Feitel re-
ceived numerous achievement awards 
for his excellent service. 
Mr. Feitel will be the first new in-
spector general at the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission in over 25 years. His 
nomination comes at a pivotal time for 
both the nuclear industry and the Com-
mission. Some utilities are seeking to 
operate their nuclear plants for 20 
more years, while others are shutting 
down, and they are shutting their reac-
tors before their licenses even expire. 
The Commission is also preparing to li-
cense new nuclear technologies that 
will be essential to our clean energy fu-
ture. 
This time of unprecedented activity 
requires a fully staffed and a fully 
functional agency. The Commission 
needs an inspector general to promote 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
Commission. Mr. Feitel is that indi-
vidual. Mr. Feitel is a man of character 
whose commitment to upholding jus-
tice makes him an ideal candidate for 
the position. 
I encourage the entire Senate to vote 
today to confirm Mr. Robert Feitel to 
serve as the inspector general of the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
Senate was gaveled out about 6 weeks 
ago now. We passed the $2.2 trillion 
CARES Act on March 25, and here it is 
May 4. Since that time, the global bat-
tle to defeat the coronavirus has only 
intensified. 
There have been some who ques-
tioned the wisdom of the Senate com-
ing back to Washington and convening, 
but I think we need to be here, and we 
need to do our jobs. We know how to do 
this safely. We know how to social dis-
tance. We know how to wash our hands 
and not touch our face. Those are the 
responsibilities each of us bear to one 
another not to spread this virus. 
But if there is such a thing as essen-
tial and nonessential workers—and I 
don’t think that distinction is one we 
should 
discuss 
because 
26 
million 
Americans are not nonessential work-
ers; they are absolutely essential to 
our economy and to our way of life. 
But, make no mistake, self-govern-
ment is essential under any construc-
tion, under any definition of that word. 
Our system was not made to run on 
autopilot, so it is appropriate that we 
show up and that we do our job and we 
protect the American people and do ev-
erything we can to defeat this virus 
from a public health standpoint but 
also to do what is necessary to main-
tain a lifeline to the economy and the 
workers who are an essential compo-
nent of it so that, when we defeat this 
virus, we will be prepared for people to 
go back to work in full and keep our 
economy and jobs growing again. 
We know that about 3.5 million cases 
have been confirmed worldwide, and 
roughly a third of these cases are here 
in the United States. Tragically, we 
have lost 65,000 Americans to this cruel 
virus, but, heroically, our healthcare 
workers have been on the job each and

every day—like law enforcement and 
grocery clerks—doing their part to 
help provide us the healthcare, the law 
enforcement, and the food that is feed-
ing our families. 
We know, for weeks on end, our doc-
tors and nurses and first responders 
have put themselves in harm’s way to 
save the lives of those who have been 
affected by COVID–19. They are offer-
ing more than lifesaving care. These 
men and women are a hand to hold, a 
friendly voice, and a source of comfort 
to patients isolated from friends and 
family because of this cruel disease. 
Our heroic healthcare workers are 
physically 
and 
mentally 
exhausted 
from this fight. Yet they continue to 
serve, day in and day out. 
I want to express my gratitude, and I 
know I speak for others when I say 
thank you for the heart that you have 
put into your job and for the sacrifices 
you have made, spending time away 
from your families so that you can help 
ours. 
At the same time, we are seeing tre-
mendous progress in a race to develop 
both treatments and a vaccine. While 
there are plenty of reasons to be opti-
mistic about how this story ends, I 
know a lot of work remains to be done. 
In addition to the physical toll this 
virus has taken on the American peo-
ple, it has wreaked economic havoc. 
In order to slow the spread of the 
coronavirus, stores and restaurants 
have closed their doors, travel plans 
have been abandoned, events have been 
canceled, and millions of Americans 
were suddenly without a way to earn a 
living. In the past 6 weeks, 30 million 
Americans have filed for unemploy-
ment—an absolutely staggering figure. 
So far, Congress has passed four sepa-
rate bills to address this crisis from a 
public health standpoint as well as to 
ease its economic impact. We have pro-
vided billions of dollars in funding to 
support our hospitals, increase testing 
capacity, and ramp up the production 
and acquisition of the personal protec-
tive equipment our medical workers 
rely upon as well as the ventilators 
that many of the COVID–19 patients 
will need. 
We have provided unprecedented as-
sistance for America’s small busi-
nesses, which employ about half of 
America’s workers. The Paycheck Pro-
tection Program has enabled small 
businesses to keep their employees on 
the payroll and cover expenses until 
the smoke clears. 
We have also sent vital funding to 
our State and local governments— 
about $150 billion. We provided relief to 
student loan borrowers and sent finan-
cial assistance to the American people 
in the form of direct payments from 
the IRS. 
Members of Congress came together 
to act quickly and decisively to address 
this pandemic, and I am very proud of 
the work that we have done together so 
far. 
Over the past several weeks, like 
every Senator, I have had the privilege 
of speaking with my constituents all 
across the State of Texas about the im-
pact of this virus as well as Congress’s 
response. I have spoken to doctors, 
nurses, and hospital administrators 
about the strain on the personnel and 
the need for personal protective equip-
ment. 
I have talked to small business own-
ers across the State about their grow-
ing list of expenses and the lifeline 
that the PPE provided. 
I have listened to our mayors and 
county judges, from our biggest cities 
and smallest towns, who have talked 
about the mounting financial burdens 
they are facing. I have talked with our 
farmers and ranchers about the impact 
on everything from cattle to cotton 
and the need to protect our food supply 
chain. 
I am grateful for the men and women 
I have spoken with who have shared 
their perspective and feedback about 
Congress’s response to the coronavirus. 
Anytime a piece of legislation moves 
this quickly, as these bills did, and are 
this big, there are bound to be gaps 
that need to be filled, mistakes that 
need to be corrected, tweaks that need 
to be applied. The Texans to whom I 
have spoken over these past several 
weeks have pointed out some of those 
gaps and provided ideas for the discus-
sions we are now having about what 
comes next. 
A few weeks ago, I spoke with rep-
resentatives from the Texas Council on 
Family Violence, the Texas Associa-
tion Against Sexual Assault, and more 
than a dozen organizations across the 
State that support survivors of domes-
tic violence. 
When you think about the impact of 
the pandemic or any other major crisis, 
for that matter, domestic violence isn’t 
typically one of the first issues that 
comes to mind, but the circumstances 
we are facing today make these cases 
all too common. People are spending 
more time isolated at home. They are 
dealing with a new range of stresses 
brought on by this virus—more time 
with their partner, financial struggles, 
teaching their children at home—and it 
is taking a devastating toll. 
When Texas’s stay-at-home order was 
first announced, many organizations 
saw a spike in their hotline calls. What 
is more frightening, once these orders 
were in place, the number of calls took 
a sharp decline. In Tarrant County, 
which is where Fort Worth is located, 
call numbers dropped by almost half. 
With so much time isolated at home 
with an abuser, it may be more dif-
ficult to reach out to friends or family 
or contact the National Domestic Vio-
lence Hotline for assistance. When de-
ciding whether to leave, to go to a shel-
ter, there is also the risk of the virus 
itself, and many are faced with a lose- 
lose scenario: Do you continue living 
under the same roof as your abuser or 
do you go to a shelter where you or 
your children may come in contact 
with the virus? 
These are not the only silent victims 
of this crisis. The fear and anxiety 
brought on by this pandemic has taken 
a toll on America’s mental health. 
Most of us have never gone through 
something like this. Maybe none of us 
has gone through something quite like 
this. Our daily routines have been 
turned on their head. Isolated from 
friends and family and between social 
media and a 24-hour news cycle, it can 
be difficult to find a way to escape the 
constant barrage of bad news and anx-
iety. 
Compounding the problem even fur-
ther is the financial strain on many of 
the providers who support these indi-
viduals. A recent survey of providers 
by the National Council for Behavioral 
Health showed that more than 60 per-
cent of mental health providers have 
already been forced to close one or 
more programs—60 percent—and 62 per-
cent of providers cannot survive more 
than 3 months without emergency fi-
nancial assistance. 
As we continue working to help the 
American people through this difficult 
time, we cannot forget those who are 
suffering in silence. We have a big job 
ahead of us. That is why it is so impor-
tant that we are here doing our job on 
behalf of the 330 million people in this 
country. 
I returned back to the Senate with a 
long list of ideas and feedback from the 
Texans who have been generous enough 
to spend time talking with me over the 
past few weeks. I know all 100 Members 
of the Senate are in a similar position, 
and I hope we can retain the same 
sense of bipartisanship that has guided 
us through the legislation we have 
passed so far. 
If we are going to win this fight—and 
we will—it will not be because of a Re-
publican idea or a Democratic one; it 
will be because every single person in 
this Chamber checked their political 
priorities at the door and responded to-
gether—united—to confront and defeat 
this virus and to help restore our econ-
omy and the jobs that go along with it. 
We have done it before. Let’s do it 
again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT J. FEITEL 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of the nomi-
nation of Robert Feitel to serve as in-
spector general of the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission, which oversees the 
safety and security of almost 100 nu-
clear 
powerplants 
throughout 
this 
country—an important job. 
This is a nomination I urged the ma-
jority to take up and pass, not this 
week, not this month but before we 
went into recess on April 8. We are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2202 
May 4, 2020 
here, and this is a good nomination. I 
hope my colleagues will support it. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, having said that, let 
me remind my colleagues that we are 
still in the middle of a global pan-
demic—if we need to be reminded. I 
don’t think we do. But once we have 
voted on the nomination before us 
today, I would urge the Senate to pivot 
and begin focusing next on examining 
issues related to the pandemic and to 
ensuring that the assistance we pro-
vided in the legislation we have passed 
so far—four pieces, some bigger than 
others—is getting to the families and 
the communities that badly need it. If 
we were unable or unwilling to do so, I 
am not sure that the Senate should be 
returning to Washington to act on non-
urgent business in contravention of the 
recommendation of the Office of the 
Attending Physician and while this en-
tire region is still under stay-at-home 
orders. 
I also want to make it clear that the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee, on which I serve and lead with 
Senator JOHN BARRASSO of Wyoming, 
was willing to approve this particular 
nomination unanimously by voice vote, 
but it is what is it is, and we are here 
today. 
In the midst of a global pandemic, 
the majority leader says he is con-
cerned with nominations. Well, then, 
let’s address positions that are actu-
ally more relevant to the crisis that we 
face today. 
Currently, one-third of the inspector 
general positions that are confirmed by 
the Senate remain either vacant or 
without permanent leadership. The 
President has nominated individuals to 
fill some, but not all, of these posi-
tions. The Senate should work quickly 
to vet those nominees we have re-
ceived, especially those who would be 
involved 
with 
oversight 
for 
the 
coronavirus response. 
My colleagues will recall that this 
past March Congress passed an unprec-
edented $2 trillion relief package, the 
CARES Act, to bring help to millions 
of Americans who find themselves in 
dire straits through no fault of their 
own. Thankfully, the CARES Act cre-
ated three new separate oversight bod-
ies to monitor this emergency funding. 
I was also proud to work with Demo-
crats and Republican colleagues alike 
to help secure an additional $20 million 
to ensure that the Government Ac-
countability Office, which is known as 
GAO, can conduct important oversight 
of this funding. In fact, I learned last 
week that GAO has already notified 
Congress that it has already either un-
dertaken or begun investigations or 
has planned investigations of over 150 
audits that are related to this funding. 
Now, I appreciate GAO’s diligence on 
this important matter; not only do I 
appreciate it, but we appreciate it, and 
the American taxpayers appreciate it 
as well. 
More than ever, it is critical that we 
have robust oversight to make sure 
that this money gets into the pockets 
of those who need it most and not into 
the pockets of those who would lit-
erally steal money from the needy and 
steal money from the taxpayers of this 
country. 
If our majority leader wants to bring 
the Senate back, then I would like to 
suggest that our time would be well 
spent making sure that those oversight 
bodies created in the CARES Act are 
fully functional, including the CARES 
Act Congressional Oversight Commis-
sion, which I am told still lacks a 
chairperson. 
This 
is 
a 
five-person 
panel. It is one created by each of our 
leaders in the House and the Senate. 
That would give us four, and then an-
other one would be jointly agreed to by 
the majority leader here and the 
Speaker of the House. I am told that as 
of today, as of this moment, we still 
lack a chairperson of that important 
panel. I hope that our leader here, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
and 
Speaker 
PELOSI
will work with haste even 
today—even today—to jointly name a 
chair to the Congressional Oversight 
Commission as required by law. 
The CARES Act also created the 
Pandemic 
Response 
Accountability 
Committee. That is a committee com-
posed of inspectors general from rel-
evant agencies to oversee all spending 
appropriated through the CARES Act. 
That is a huge undertaking. Unfortu-
nately, those IG positions at key agen-
cies, including the Treasury Depart-
ment and including the Department of 
Education, still remain vacant. 
We have seen over the last month 
just how crucial it is that our IGs re-
main independent. Since the Senate 
was last in session, the President has 
unceremoniously removed, reassigned, 
or undermined highly regarded inspec-
tors general who apparently weren’t 
loyal enough to him or who dared to 
criticize what they viewed as a failed 
or flawed response to the coronavirus. 
For example, at the beginning of April, 
President Trump removed Glenn Fine, 
a highly regarded acting inspector gen-
eral for the Pentagon, who had only a 
week earlier been selected by his 
peers—selected by his peers—to chair 
the Pandemic Response Accountability 
Committee, the third oversight body 
created by the CARES Act. 
We have also seen the President look 
to replace the Health and Human Serv-
ices IG who, in a detailed report, point-
ed out the severe shortages that a 
number of our hospitals have been fac-
ing during the coronavirus outbreak. 
I believe it is clear that Congress 
needs to speak up when appropriate 
and do a better job supporting our in-
spectors general when this President— 
or frankly any President—takes retal-
iatory action against the independent 
watchdogs responsible for identifying 
failures, waste, fraud, and abuse across 
our Federal Government, especially 
when this much money is at risk. 
If the Senate is going to be back in 
session, it would seem to me these crit-
ical 
oversight 
positions 
should 
be 
among our top priorities. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT J. FEITEL 
Mr. President, having said that, let 
me turn again to the nomination be-
fore the Senate today. Like all agen-
cies, the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion needs a strong and independent in-
spector general, and I believe in Mr. 
Feitel we have one. I believe he is up to 
the task. 
We cannot be complacent when it 
comes to nuclear safety. Just remem-
ber, 50 percent of the carbon-free en-
ergy produced in this country is pro-
duced by our nuclear powerplants. 
Think about that. In a day and age 
when the climate crisis is a huge 
threat literally to our planet and those 
of us who live on it, right now, half of 
the carbon-free electricity comes in 
this country from nuclear powerplants. 
It is the job of the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission to oversee those 
plants and make sure they are being 
run well, run safely, and in ways that 
enable us to continue to depend on 
them as we go forward for carbon-free 
electricity. 
Anyway, Mr. Feitel is well qualified 
and prepared, I think; certainly the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee believes he is prepared to take 
on this responsibility. I hope my col-
leagues will join Senator BARRASSO, 
our chairman, and myself and the 
members of our committee to vote yes 
on this nomination. 
With that, I don’t see anybody wait-
ing to speak after me, so I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JIM CUMMINGS 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise to 
honor and recognize the life and con-
tributions of Mr. Jim Cummings to the 
countless 
Hoosiers 
whose 
lives 
he 
touched over nine decades. 
Jim was a giant in Indiana. His long 
and rich life left many indelible marks 
on our State. We look to people like 
Jim Cummings as an example of a life 
well lived in service to others. His role 
in founding the Indiana Black Expo in 
1970 made him a leader to all Hoosiers 
during a time of great change in our 
State and our Nation. As a lifelong 
servant to those in his State and com-
munity, his dedication to conservative 
principles guided his thoughts and ac-
tions for many years. 
His life of service extended beyond 
his work with the Indiana Black Expo. 
It included serving his community in 
public office on a number of boards in 
Indianapolis and working as the Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary for the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment under President Ronald Reagan. 
Indiana has lost one of its most dis-
tinguished Hoosiers of this generation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2203 
May 4, 2020 
The Cummings family has lost a fa-
ther, a grandfather, and a great-grand-
father. I join them in mourning the 
loss of Jim Cummings. 
In closing, I personally thank the 
Cummings family for the vast con-
tributions he made to Indianapolis and 
the Hoosier State. Both are better be-
cause of him. On behalf of me and 
Maureen, my wife, we extend our sin-
cere condolences to all of his family 
and friends at this time. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT J. FEITEL 
Mr. President, in my remaining time, 
I recommend the confirmation of Rob-
ert Feitel to be the inspector general of 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
We reviewed his nomination in my 
subcommittee in December of last 
year. I believe he is fully qualified for 
this position. During subcommittee 
consideration, we received a letter of 
support from the Chief of the Depart-
ment of Justice’s Capital Case Section, 
who noted that Mr. Feitel has exhib-
ited the ability to provide a fair-mind-
ed, independent assessment of each 
case, to scrupulously adhere to his eth-
ical obligations, and to follow the facts 
and evidence wherever they lead. These 
characteristics are necessary for any 
inspector general but particularly at 
the NRC. 
I close by noting that Mr. Feitel’s 
confirmation today is an example of 
why the Senate should be getting back 
to work. Essential American workers 
are getting up every morning to stock 
our grocery stores, to deliver the mail, 
and to transport critical supplies to 
our healthcare workers. It is our re-
sponsibility to ensure they have the re-
sources to do their jobs and have the 
assurances that our Nation’s govern-
ment is working in their best interests. 
It seems to me that the inspector 
general of the NRC is a position that 
you could label as essential. Even 
though America’s nuclear plants are 
operating at historically high levels of 
safety and performance, we can never 
be too careful. We cannot let our guard 
down. It is irresponsible to let this 
agency go so long without a confirmed, 
independent regulator. 
Had the Senate not returned today, 
this office would have gone another 
day with the lights not on. I am proud 
that the Senate is returning to ensure 
that Mr. Feitel can assume his post 
quickly and that this Senate can con-
tinue to serve the best interests of the 
American people. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM R. EVANINA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 
June of 2018, I have objected to the 
nomination of William R. Evanina to 
be Director of the National Counter-
intelligence 
and 
Security 
Center. 
Today, due to the recent actions by the 
Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence ODNI, and the Attorney Gen-
eral to finally respond to my very long-
standing oversight requests, I with-
draw my objection to Mr. Evanina’s 
nomination. 
When I noticed my intention to ob-
ject to this nominee in June of 2018, I 
made it very clear to the public and to 
the administration my reasons for 
doing so. I did not question Mr. 
Evanina’s credentials in any way, and I 
put my statement of those reasons in 
the RECORD. I have done that consist-
ently, not only since the rules of the 
Senate first required every Member to 
do that, but even before that rule was 
put in place. 
At the time, I experienced difficulties 
obtaining 
relevant 
documents 
and 
briefings from the Justice Department 
and ODNI related to the 2016 election 
controversies. On several occasions, 
then-Deputy Attorney General—DAG— 
Rod Rosenstein personally assured me 
that the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
of which I was chairman, would receive 
equal access to information provided to 
the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence—HPSCI—with 
regard to any concessions in its nego-
tiations regarding pending subpoenas 
from that committee. However, I, and 
the Judiciary Committee, never re-
ceived equal access from DAG Rosen-
stein. 
For example, on August 7, 2018, I 
wrote to the Justice Department and 
pointed out that the House Intelligence 
Committee had received documents re-
lated to Bruce Ohr that the Judiciary 
Committee had not received. The De-
partment initially denied those records 
had been provided to the House Intel-
ligence Committee. After my staff con-
fronted the Department, we eventually 
received some Bruce Ohr documents. In 
that same 2018 letter, I also asked for 
other documents based on my equal ac-
cess agreement with DAG Rosenstein. 
I then learned that the Justice De-
partment took the position that then- 
ODNI Director Dan Coats prohibited 
the Department from sharing the re-
quested records with the committee. 
Needless to say, it was your typical bu-
reaucratic blame-game. 
Then, some personnel changes took 
place. I voiced my concerns to Acting 
Director Grenell and Attorney General 
Barr. Recently, thanks to their com-
mitment to transparency, I have re-
ceived access to the types of documents 
that I asked for almost 2 years ago in 
June 2018. Moreover, both Acting Di-
rector Grenell and Attorney General 
Barr have gone multiple steps further 
by declassifying much of the informa-
tion that I had sought access to. Credit 
should be given when it is due and Act-
ing Director Grenell and Attorney Gen-
eral Barr deserve that credit here 
today. 
If their predecessors had simply re-
spected legitimate congressional over-
sight and their agreements with me 
and the Judiciary Committee from the 
beginning, Mr. Evanina would have 
been confirmed long ago. 
Now, I also want to remind everyone, 
especially future administrations, that 
the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ju-
risdiction extends to the intelligence 
community. In the authorizing resolu-
tion that created the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence, the Senate 
explicitly reserved for other standing 
committees, such as the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, independent authority 
to ‘‘study and review any intelligence 
activity’’ and ‘‘to obtain full and 
prompt access to the product of the in-
telligence activities of any department 
or agency’’ when such activity ‘‘di-
rectly affects a matter otherwise with-
in 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
such 
com-
mittee’’—S. Res. 400. The Senate Judi-
ciary Committee has jurisdiction over 
all federal courts, including the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 
FISC. As I understand it, the records at 
issue here fall into that category. 
Let this also be a reminder that when 
it comes to congressional oversight, I 
will use all the tools at my disposal to 
get to the truth of the matter and get 
access to the records that I believe are 
necessary to advance my investiga-
tions. The executive branch must rec-
ognize that it has an ongoing obliga-
tion to respond to congressional inquir-
ies in a timely and reasonable manner. 
As I have said many times before, 
transparency brings accountability and 
congressional oversight helps to bring 
about the sunlight necessary for that 
to happen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Feitel nomination? 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER), the

Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Utah (Mr. LEE) would

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, 
establishes statutory limits on discre-
tionary spending and allows for various 
adjustments to those limits. In addi-
tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the 
chairman of the Budget Committee to 
establish and make revisions to alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels consistent 
with those adjustments. 
The Senate recently considered three 
measures that were signed into law to 
combat the coronavirus. These meas-
ures, the Family First Coronavirus Re-
sponse 
Act, 
P.L. 
116–127; 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security Act, P.L. 116–136; and the Pay-
check Protection Program and Health 
Care Enhancement Act, P.L. 116–139, 
provided supplemental emergency ap-
propriations to support activities re-
lated to public health and response to 
the coronavirus that qualify for cap ad-
justments under section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) 
of BBEDCA. 
The Family First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act included emergency appro-
priations totaling $82 million in revised 
security budget authority and $2,389 
million in revised nonsecurity budget 
authority. The Congressional Budget 
Office, CBO, estimates that these ap-
propriations will result in $843 million 
in outlays in fiscal year 2020. 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Eco-
nomic Security Act included emer-
gency appropriations totaling $10,525 
million in revised security budget au-
thority and $319,158 million in revised 
nonsecurity budget authority. CBO es-
timates that these appropriations will 
result in $98,789 million in outlays in 
fiscal year 2020. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act in-
cluded emergency appropriations total-
ing $162,100 million in revised nonsecu-
rity budget authority. CBO estimates 
that these appropriations will result in 
$113,132 million in outlays in fiscal year 
2020. 
As a result of the emergency designa-
tions, I am revising the budget author-
ity and outlay allocations to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations by increasing 
revised security budget authority by 
$10,607 
million, 
revised 
nonsecurity 
budget authority by $483,647 million 
and outlays by $212,764 million in fiscal 
year 2020. Further, I am increasing the 
budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2020 
by $494,072 million in budget authority 
and $212,655 million in outlays. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2205 
May 4, 2020 
BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 20l9, P.L. 116–37, in-
cluded an instruction to the chairman 
of the Senate Committee on the Budget 
to file allocations, aggregates, and 
budgetary levels in the Senate between 
April 15, 2020, and May 15, 2020. Today, 
I rise to submit the required filing to 
fulfill that instruction. 
Specifically, section 205 of the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the 
chairman to file: (1) allocations for fis-
cal year 2021 for the Committee on Ap-
propriations; (2) allocations for fiscal 
years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021 
through 2030 for committees other than 
the Committee on Appropriations; (3) 
aggregate spending levels for fiscal 
year 2021; (4) aggregate revenue levels 
for fiscal year 2021, 2021 through 2025, 
and 2021 through 2030; and (5) aggregate 
levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal 
years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021 
through 2030 for Social Security. 
The figures included in this filing are 
consistent 
with 
the 
discretionary 
spending limits set forth in the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019 and the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s March 2020 
baseline, as adjusted to reflect legisla-
tion enacted since the publication of 
the baseline. Enforceable figures in 
this filing exclude the direct budgetary 
effects of provisions in legislation en-
acted after the release of the baseline 
that were designated as an emergency 
pursuant to section 4112 of the fiscal 
year 2018 congressional budget resolu-
tion, H.Con.Res. 71, 115th Congress, 
which excludes those effects from cal-
culations related to sections 302 and 311 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974. In instances where enforceable 
discretionary levels are required to be 
adjusted for spending designated as an 
emergency pursuant to the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act, those adjustments are included. 
In addition to the update for enforce-
able limits above, section 205 of the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2019 allows for 
the deficit-neutral reserve funds in-
cluded in title III of the fiscal year 2018 
congressional budget resolution to be 
updated by 3 fiscal years. Pursuant to 
this authority, all deficit-neutral re-
serve funds in the aforementioned title 
of the fiscal year 2018 congressional 
budget resolution are updated and 
available for use. 
For purposes of enforcing the Sen-
ate’s, pay-as-you-go rule, which is 
found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 
2018 congressional budget resolution, I 
am resetting the Senate’s scorecard to 
zero for all fiscal years. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables detailing enforce-
ment in the Senate be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ALLOCATION OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
(Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and Section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019)

anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA). The outlay figures included in this table reflect enactment of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act (P.L. 116-136), the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139), which generated $178,246 million in outlays from appropriations that were designated as emergencies pursuant to section 251 
(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Korea—F–35 Follow-On Support 
The Republic of Korea has requested fol-
low-on support and services for its F–35 air-
craft, engines, and weapons; publications and 
technical 
documentation; 
support 
equip-
ment; spare and repair parts; repair and re-
turn; test equipment; software delivery and 
support; pilot flight equipment; personnel 
training equipment; U.S. Government and 
contractor technical and logistics support 
services; and other related elements of pro-
gram support. The estimated total program 
cost is $675 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by meeting legitimate se-
curity and defense needs of one of its closest 
allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The Re-
public of Korea is one of the major political 
and economic powers in East Asia and the 
Western Pacific and a key partner of the 
United States in ensuring peace and stability 
in the region. 
The proposed sale will sustain the Republic 
of Korea’s flight and maintenance activity. 
It wil1 improve sustainability and continue 
support for the F–35 fleet. The Republic of 
Korea will have no difficulty absorbing this 
support and services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this support and serv-
ices will not alter the basic military balance 
in the region. 
The principal contractor will be the Lock-
heed Martin Corporation, Bethesda, MD and 
Pratt and Whitney, East Hartford, CT. There 
are no known offset agreements proposed in 
connection with this potential sale. Any off-
set agreement will be defined in negotiations 
between the Purchaser and the prime con-
tractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of 14–26 additional 
U.S. contractor representatives to the Re-
public of Korea. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
The Netherlands—Excalibur Projectiles 
The Government of the Netherlands has re-
quested to buy one hundred ninety-nine (199) 
Excalibur Increment IB M982A1 tactical pro-
jectiles. Also included with this request is 
U.S. Government technical assistance, train-
ing, associated support equipment, and other 
related elements of logistics and program 
support. The total estimated program cost is 
$40.55 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve security of a 
NATO ally which is an important force for 
political stability and economic progress in 
Northern Europe. 
The Netherlands will integrate these muni-
tions 
with 
conventional 
artillery 
units 
equipped with the PzH2000NL self-propelled 
howitzer (SPH) to provide precision fires ca-
pability in order to reduce collateral damage 
and increase effectiveness in various areas of 
operation. The Netherlands will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this equipment into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this weapon system 
will not alter the basic military balance in 
the region. 
The prime contractor will be the Raytheon 
Company, Tucson, AZ. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Netherlands. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
3. A determination has been made that the 
Netherlands can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the technology 
being released as the U.S. Government. This 
potential sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives as outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional 
torpedo that can be launched from surface 
ships, rotary and fixed wing aircrafts. The 
MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo. 
The upgrade to the MK 54 entails replace-
ment of the torpedo’s sonar and guidance 
and control systems with modem tech-
nology. The new guidance and control sys-
tem uses a mixture of commercial-off-the- 
shelf and custom-built electronics. The war-
head, fuel tank and propulsion system from 
the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 
configuration 
with 
minor 
modifications. 
There is no sensitive technology in the MK 
54 or its support and test equipment. The as-
sembled MK 54 torpedo and several of its in-
dividual components are classified CON-
FIDENTIAL. The MK 54 operational software 
is classified as SECRET. The Government of 
India has not requested nor will it be pro-
vided with the source code for the MK 54 
operational software. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced

3. A determination has been made that 
India can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AH–64E Apache Attack Helicopter is 
a fielded armed attack rotary wing aircraft 
in the Army inventory. The AH–64E is 
equipped with communication and target 
identification 
equipment, 
navigational 
equipment, aircraft survivability equipment, 
displays and sensors. Components considered 
to contain sensitive technology in the pro-
posed case are as follows: 
a. The AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAQ–11 
Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/PNVS) 
provides day, night, and limited adverse 
weather target information, as well as night 
navigation capabilities. The PNVS provides 
thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the- 
earth flight to, from, and within the battle 
area, while TADS provides the co-pilot gun-
ner with search, detection, recognition, and 
designation by means of Direct View Optics 
(DVO), EI2 television, and Forward Looking 
Infrared (FLIR) sighting systems that may 
be used singularly or in combinations. 
MTADS/PNVS contain sensitive technology 
and are classified CONFIDENTIAL. 
b. The AN/APG–78 Fire Control Radar 
(FCR) is an active, low-probability of inter-
cept, millimeter-wave radar, combined with 
a passive AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar 
Frequency Interferometer (M–RFI) mounted 
on top of the helicopter mast. The AN/APG– 
78 and the AN/APR–78B M–RFI hardware 
components contain sensitive critical tech-
nologies. The FCR Ground Targeting Mode 
detects, locates, classifies and prioritizes 
stationary or moving armored vehicles, 
tanks and mobile air defense systems as well 
as hovering helicopters, helicopters, and 
fixed wing aircraft. 
c. The AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (M–RFI) is an updated 
version of the passive radar detection and di-
rection finding system. The AN/APR–78B M– 
RFI hardware components contain sensitive 
technology and are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL. It utilizes a detachable UDM on the 
M–RFI processor, which contains the Radar 
Frequency (RF) threat library. 
d. The AGM–114R Hellfire is an air-to- 
ground missiles used against heavy and light 
armored targets, thin skinned vehicles, 
urban structures, bunkers, caves and per-
sonnel. The missile is Inertial Measurement 
Unit (IMU) based, with a variable delay fuse, 
improved safety and reliability. The highest 
level of classified information that could be 
disclosed by a proposed sale or by testing of 
the end item is up to and including SECRET.

associated with AGM–114R could lead to de-
velopment of countermeasures or exploi-
tation of system vulnerabilities by those ob-
taining the information. 
e. The Hellfire M36E9 Captive Air Training 
Missiles (CATM) is a flight-training missile 
that consists of a functional guidance sec-
tion coupled to an inert missile bus. The 
M36E9 CATM does not have a functional 
rocket motor or warhead, and cannot be 
launched. It functions like a tactical missile 
(without launch capability) during captive 
carry on the aircraft, making it suitable for 
training the aircrew in simulated Hellfire 
missile target acquisition and lock. The 
highest level of classified information that 
could be disclosed by a proposed sale or by 
testing of the end item is SECRET. 
f. The aircraft has an Embedded Global Po-
sitioning System/Inertial Navigation System 
(EGI) plus MultiMode Receiver (MMR), and 
two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, 
rate gyro measurements, and external sensor 
measurements to estimate the aircraft state, 
provides aircraft flight and position data to 
aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity- 
aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based iner-
tial unit. The EGI unit houses a GPS re-
ceiver. Integrated within the EGI is an Iner-
tial Measurement Unit (IMU) for processing 
functions. Each EGI also houses an MMR to 
provide 
for 
reception 
of 
ground 
based 
NAVAID signals for instrument aided flight. 
g. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning 
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by 
threat missiles in-flight, evaluates potential 
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate countermeasures. The CMWS consists 
of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Electro- 
Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Se-
quencer and Improved Countermeasures Dis-
penser (ICMD). The ECU hardware is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical 
manuals for operation and maintenance are 
classified SECRET. 
h. The AN/APR–39 Radar Signal Detecting 
Set is a system that provides warnings of 
radar-directed air defense threats and allows 
appropriate countermeasures. This is the 
1553 databus compatible configuration. The 
hardware is classified CONFIDENTIAL when 
programmed with threat data; releasable 
technical manuals for operation and mainte-
nance are classified CONFIDENTIAL; releas-
able technical data (technical performance) 
is classified SECRET. The system can be pro-
grammed with threat data provided by the 
purchasing country. 
i. The M36E9 Captive Air Training Missile 
(CATM) 
is 
a 
Hellfire 
training 
missile 
(NonNATO) that consists of a functional 
guidance section coupled to an inert missile 
bus. The missile has an operational semi-ac-
tive laser seeker that can search for and 
lock-on to laser designated targets for pilot 
training, but it does not have a warhead or 
propulsion section and cannot be launched. 
j. The Stinger RMP Block I Missile, hard-
ware, embedded software object code and op-
erating 
documentation 
contain 
sensitive 
technology and are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL. The highest classification of the 
Stinger 92H Reprogrammable Micro-Proc-
essor (RMP) Block I missile hardware is 
CONFIDENTIAL, and the highest classifica-
tion of data and information is SECRET. The 
guidance section of the missile and tracking 
head trainer contain highly sensitive tech-

REMEMBERING DAVID MARTIN 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, it 
is with a heavy heart that I honor the 
life of Mississippi native, William 
David Martin. A paramedic with Amer-
ican Medical Response, David served 
his community during the coronavirus 
pandemic until he passed away due to 
complications of COVID–19 on April 22, 
2020. His dedication to his patients and 
community represents the best of Mis-
sissippi, and I send my deepest sym-
pathies to his family and friends. 
Mr. Martin was born in 1967 in 
McComb, MS, to Joyce F. Martin and 
the late Billy B. Martin. Mr. Martin 
was a national registered paramedic 
with American Medical Response of 
Southwest Mississippi and worked as a 
paramedic in Natchez and Gulfport. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Martin 
served on the frontlines of Mississippi 
healthcare, helping care for patients 
during emergencies and times of great 
need. When COVID–19 began to spread 
in the United States, Mr. Martin an-
swered the call and continued to serve 
and protect his community from this 
dangerous new virus. Mr. Martin will 
be known as a hero not only in Mis-
sissippi but throughout our Nation. As 
a symbol of his dedication to his team 
of paramedics, his coworkers from 
AMR Southwest Mississippi served as 
the pallbearers at his funeral. 
Mississippi and our Nation have been 
well-served by the diligence, sacrifice 
and love provided on a daily basis by 
paramedics like David Martin. His big 
heart and dedication to his community 
will be greatly missed. I offer my con-
dolences and prayers for Mr. Martin’s 
children, his fiance; and members of 
his family. I also pray that God will 
protect his coworkers at AMR and all 
paramedics in Mississippi, who are still 
working tirelessly to protect our loved 
ones throughout this pandemic. They, 
like so many of our healthcare workers 
on the frontlines, deserve our support 
and appreciation during this time.∑

UNTEERS, AND FIRST RESPOND-
ERS 
WHO SERVED SURVIVORS 
ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS DUR-
ING 
NATIONAL 
SEXUAL 
AS-
SAULT AWARENESS AND PRE-
VENTION MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
PETERS, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. JONES, and Mr. 
TILLIS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 555 
Whereas the 19th anniversary of National 
Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention 
Month, which took place in April 2020, pro-
vides the people of the United States with an 
opportunity to reflect on the substantial 
contributions made by the individuals who 
respond to, and advocate on behalf of, sur-
vivors of sexual violence; 
Whereas the first rape crisis center, estab-
lished in San Francisco, California, in 1971, 
was the natural outgrowth of years of peer- 
to-peer support by advocates for women and 
civil rights advocates in communities across 
the United States; 
Whereas, nearly 5 decades later, rape crisis 
centers across the United States continue to 
be on the front lines in responding to the 
needs of sexual assault survivors, going 
above and beyond to empower and improve 
the lives of these crime victims during the 
national emergency declared by the Presi-
dent under the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with respect to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19); 
Whereas thousands of volunteers and per-
sonnel at State coalitions against sexual as-
sault have partnered with rape crisis centers 
and national nonprofit organizations across 
the country to extend crisis hotline and 
other services to survivors of sexual assault 
during such national emergency; 
Whereas the National Sexual Assault Hot-
line (800–656–HOPE) has fielded more than 
1,000,000 calls since its inception, providing 
free and confidential help to sexual assault 
survivors, with the active involvement of 
many such nonprofit organizations; 
Whereas sexual violence affects some indi-
viduals who serve in the Armed Forces, ac-
cording to the Department of Defense, which 
recently launched the Safe Helpline (877–995– 
5247), through which thousands of members 
of the Armed Forces who annually report 
some form of sexual assault may receive free 
and confidential help; 
Whereas, during such national emergency, 
additional resources are available to victims 
of violent crime through the National Center 
for Victims of Crime, which operates the Na-
tional Hotline for Crime Victims (855–4–VIC-
TIM); 
Whereas, during such national emergency, 
first 
responders, 
including 
police, 
fire-
fighters, and emergency medical technicians, 
have worked tirelessly to provide emergency 
services and respond to crime survivors; 
Whereas, during such national emergency, 
sexual assault forensic nurses have played an 
essential role in meeting the needs of crime 
victims by responding with empathy to vic-
tims in the immediate aftermath of their as-
sault and ensuring the successful collection 
of crime scene evidence; 
Whereas, each year, crimes of sexual vio-
lence harm hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals in the United States, sometimes with 
life altering effects, and many perpetrators 
will never be brought to justice; 
Whereas sexual assault can happen to any-
one, regardless of demographic or socio-
economic background, but research suggests 
that American Indians and Alaska Natives 
experience rates of sexual violence that sig-
nificantly surpass such rates of other popu-
lations in the United States, according to 
the National Alliance to End Sexual Vio-
lence; 
Whereas victims of sexual violence usually 
know their abuser, according to the Office 
for Victims of Crime at the Department of 
Justice, which recently lost a tireless advo-
cate for crime survivors with the death of its 
longtime director, Joye Frost; and 
Whereas many sexual violence survivors 
suffer emotional complications, such as post- 
traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, 
major depression, homelessness, eating dis-
orders, and even suicide, long after their 
physical scars have healed, according to the 
National Sexual Violence Resource Center: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) this resolution represents the great ap-
preciation of, and an expression of support 
by, the Senate for the work of individuals in 
the United States who have provided and 
continue to provide an essential service to 
advance the safety and emotional wellness of 
survivors of sexual violence during the na-
tional emergency declared by the President 
under the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with respect to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19); 
(2) the Senate remains committed to pro-
moting the awareness, prevention, and deter-
rence of sexual violence affecting individuals 
in the United States, including during such 
national emergency; 
(3) it is the sense of the Senate that it is 
appropriate to properly acknowledge sur-
vivors of sexual assault and commend the 
volunteers and professionals who assist such 
survivors in their efforts to heal; 
(4) the Senate extends its appreciation to 
the staff and volunteers of national and com-
munity organizations for their tireless ef-
forts in supporting survivors of sexual as-
sault throughout the year, but especially 
during such national emergency; and 
(5) public safety, law enforcement, and 
health professionals should be recognized 
and applauded for their continued efforts to 
ensure that perpetrators of sexual assault 
are held accountable, both during such na-
tional emergency and throughout the year.

‘‘Foreign Service’’) was established through 
the enactment of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act 
For the reorganization and improvement of 
the Foreign Service of the United States, 
and for other purposes.’’, approved May 24, 
1924 (43 Stat. 140, chapter 182) (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Rogers Act of 1924’’), and is 
now celebrating its 96th anniversary; 
Whereas the Rogers Act of 1924 established 
a career organization based on competitive 
examination and merit promotion; 
Whereas, in 2020, more than 16,000 men and 
women of the Foreign Service are serving at 
home and abroad; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel are 
supported by more than 75,000 locally en-
gaged staff in nearly 300 embassies and con-
sulates, who provide unique expertise and 
crucial links to host countries; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel com-
prise employees from the Department of 
State, the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, the Department of 
Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, and the United States Agency for 
Global Media; 
Whereas the diplomatic, consular, commu-
nications, trade, development, security, pub-
lic diplomacy, and numerous other functions 
that Foreign Service personnel perform con-
stitute the first and most cost-effective in-
strument of the United States to protect and 
promote United States interests abroad; 
Whereas the men and women of the For-
eign Service and their families are increas-
ingly exposed to risks and danger, even in 
times of peace, and many have died in the 
service of the United States; 
Whereas employees of the Foreign Service 
work daily— 
(1) to ensure the national security of the 
United States; 
(2) to provide assistance to United States 
citizens overseas; 
(3) to preserve peace, freedom, and eco-
nomic prosperity around the world; 
(4) to promote the ideals and values of the 
United States, internationally recognized 
human rights, freedom, equal opportunities 
for women and girls, rule of law, and democ-
racy; 
(5) to promote transparency, provide accu-
rate 
information, 
and 
combat 
disinformation; 
(6) to cultivate new markets for United 
States products and services and develop new 
investment opportunities that create jobs in 
the United States and promote prosperity; 
(7) to promote economic development, re-
duce poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, 
fight disease, combat international crime 
and illegal drugs, and address environmental 
degradation; and 
(8) to provide emergency and humanitarian 
assistance to respond to crises around the 
world; 
Whereas, in response to the unprecedented 
global COVID–19 pandemic, all of the foreign 
affairs agencies of the United States have 
worked tirelessly to support the people of 
the United States, often placing their own 
safety and well-being at risk; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel and lo-
cally engaged staff have assisted individuals 
in crisis by providing emergency consular 
services, repatriating United States citizens 
abroad, surging the agriculture quarantine 
and inspection program, providing technical 
assistance and emergency and humanitarian 
relief to other countries and populations, 
and pursuing other efforts that have saved 
lives; 
Whereas the foreign affairs agencies and 
the American Foreign Service Association 
have observed Foreign Service Day in May 
for many years; and 
Whereas it is both appropriate and just for 
the United States as a whole to recognize the 
dedication of the men and women of the For-
eign Service and to honor the members of 
the Foreign Service who have given their 
lives in the loyal pursuit of their duties and 
responsibilities representing the interests of 
the United States and of its citizens: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the men and women who have 
served, or are presently serving, in the For-
eign Service of the United States for their 
dedicated and important service to the 
United States; 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to reflect on the service and sacrifice of past, 
present, and future employees of the Foreign 
Service of the United States, wherever they 
serve, with appropriate ceremonies and ac-
tivities; and 
(3) designates May 1, 2020, as ‘‘United 
States Foreign Service Day’’ to commemo-
rate the 96th anniversary of the Foreign 
Service of the United States.
