PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, who remains the same though 
all else fades, we praise You for Your 
graciousness and compassion, rejoicing 
that You are slow to anger and rich in 
love. 
Lord, thank You for Your presence in 
the lives of our lawmakers, providing 
them with clear vision from Your light 
that leads to truth. 
Remind our Senators that everything 
is possible for those who believe. In-
cline their hearts to Your wisdom and 
love, as You keep their feet on the path 
of integrity. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

REMEMBERING ABE SCHUMER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I hope 
all Senators had a productive and rest-
ful Thanksgiving holiday. 
This year, I am sad to say, was a 
painful Thanksgiving season for the 
Schumer family. Last Wednesday, we 
all said goodbye to my father Abe 
Schumer, who passed away after 98 
amazing years. 
I want to thank all of my colleagues 
in this Chamber who have reached out 
with prayers, condolences, and words of 
kindness in recent days. Their words 
give us strength. Their prayers give us 
healing. Their kindness gives us im-
mense comfort. I say the same to so 
many New Yorkers who reached out as 
well. 
Here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
I want to take a moment to offer a lov-
ing son’s tribute to the man we lost 
last week. 
My father was the kind of parent 
every kid deserves, every spouse hopes 
for, and the sort of American that 
makes our country great, and as I 
shared last week: 
In so many ways, he personified the great-
est generation. He took whatever was thrown 
at him, no matter how difficult; he did his 
job and never complained. He was an amaz-
ing husband, parent, grandparent, and great- 
grandparent. 
Dad, we love you. We already miss 
you beyond comprehension. Thank you 
for the incredible life you led on this 
Earth. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, on another subject, Omicron. Over 
the course of 2021, our country has 
made monumental and hard-fought 
progress in our fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
After the passing of the American 
Rescue Plan, after getting vaccines 
into as many arms as possible, and be-
cause of the unceasing work of the 
Biden administration and healthcare 
workers across the country, we begin 
the winter of 2021 in a much better 
place than the winter of 2020. 
But as we learn more about the Omi-
cron variant that is spreading abroad, 
my message to the American people is 
simple: If you don’t want to get sick, 
get vaccinated. If you are eligible, get 
your booster shot. 
While there is so much we have yet 
to understand about the Omicron vari-
ant, we do know that you are far less 
likely to be hospitalized or die from 
the coronavirus if you are fully vac-
cinated. And for those who are already 
vaccinated, research shows that boost-
ers are likewise highly effective. Take 
the words of Dr. Francis Collins, the 
head of the National Institutes of 
Health: 
Boosters do, in fact, allow your immune 
system to have a wide range of capabilities 
against spike proteins it hasn’t seen before.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8768 
November 29, 2021 
If you needed one more reason, if you’re eli-
gible to get that booster right away, this 
would be it. 
Those are the words of Dr. Collins. 
By now we know, the longer that eli-
gible people resist safe vaccines, the 
greater the risk of new variants like 
Delta and Omicron arising in our 
midst. These strains—these strains—of 
variants have largely spread among 
unvaccinated populations, threatening 
our families, small businesses, and pro-
longing the day we put this wretched 
disease fully in the rearview mirror. 
So if you aren’t getting vaccinated 
for yourself because you don’t think 
you need it, then do it for your family, 
your friends, and your neighbors be-
cause the unvaccinated population is 
where the variants multiply, spread, 
and grow, and hurt everybody. 
So as we enter the holiday season, as 
we begin attending holiday gatherings 
and traveling long distances to see 
families, I urge New Yorkers and 
Americans everywhere to stay safe, get 
vaccinated, and get boosted. It is the 
best thing we can do to protect our 
families, our communities, and our 
country. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on NDAA, the Defense Act, we 
begin an important week for what will 
be an important final month of 2021. 
Later today, the Senate will vote on 
cloture on the substitute amendment 
to the NDAA. NDAA has been passed 
by this Chamber for over 60 years, and 
there is no good reason why this year 
should be any different. 
Before 
Thanksgiving, 
the 
Senate 
worked in as bipartisan way as it could 
to lay the groundwork for advancing 
the Defense bill. Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee Chairman REED
and 
Ranking Member INHOFE reached an 
agreement, a bipartisan agreement, on 
a package of 18 amendments—let me 
repeat that; 18 amendments, folks—for 
the Senate to hold rollcall votes on. 
Nearly half of those amendments were 
led by a Republican. That would be 
more amendments to the NDAA receiv-
ing rollcall votes than in the last 4 
years combined. 
We also agreed to the substitute 
amendment, which included at least 50 
amendments, 27 of which were led by a 
Republican. Senator INHOFE, the rank-
ing member of the Armed Services 
Committee, agreed to this. 
In any other time, this would be con-
sidered a very fair and generous com-
promise. Even though every Member 
didn’t get every amendment they want-
ed, the leadership on both sides would 
have made sure that cloture was grant-
ed. 
Unfortunately, Republicans could not 
accept this agreement before Thanks-
giving, but we hope that Republican 
dysfunction will not be a roadblock to 
passing this bill and taking care of our 
troops and their families. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on government funding, as we all 
know, by the end of this week, both 
parties must come to an agreement for 
funding the government and avoiding a 
needless shutdown. 
At the end of September, Democrats 
and Republicans worked together to 
keep the government open through De-
cember 3, avoiding many of the fights 
that tainted so many funding debates 
under 
the 
previous 
administration. 
After the House takes action this 
week, the Democratic-led Senate will 
move forward to make sure the govern-
ment remains funded after the dead-
line. 
With so many critical issues, the last 
thing the American people need right 
now is a government shutdown, and 
Democrats are going to work this week 
to make sure we don’t have one this 
time around. It is important to get it 
done, and we are working to get it 
done. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. 
SCHUMER. 
Finally, 
Madam 
President, on Build Back Better, before 
the end of the year, the Senate will 
also work on President Biden’s Build 
Back Better legislation, which momen-
tously passed the House at the very 
end of the last work period. 
This week, Democrats will continue 
to meet with the Senate Parliamen-
tarian in order to complete the tech-
nical and procedural work required be-
fore the bill comes to the floor. Meet-
ings were held over the Thanksgiving 
week, and we will continue this week 
and next week as needed. 
As I have said repeatedly, once this 
necessary work is completed with the 
Parliamentarian, I will bring the Presi-
dent’s Build Back Better legislation to 
the floor so we can pass it as soon as 
possible and send it to the President’s 
desk. Our goal continues to be to get 
this done before Christmas. 
Build Back Better represents the 
largest investment in the American 
people in generations. Under our bill, 
childcare will be more affordable, pre-K 
will be more affordable, and raising 
kids overall will be more affordable for 
tens of millions of parents. 
The bill will take unprecedented 
steps in the fight against the climate 
crisis, paving the way for even greater 
action in the future. 
And as scores of economists from 
across the ideological spectrum attest 
to, Build Back Better will not worsen 
inflation—will not worsen inflation— 
and in the long run help bring costs 
under control. 
So cutting costs, saving parents 
money, fighting climate change, and 
creating the jobs of tomorrow—these 
are the things the American people 
want; these are the things the Amer-
ican people need; and these are the 
things that Build Back Better will de-
liver on once we pass it through this 
Chamber. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
today’s Democratic Party does not 
make the policy decisions of a party 
that is serious about protecting our 
country. 
In May, President Biden released a 
budget proposal that proposed a de 
facto cut in defense spending, and that 
was before the President’s own super-
charged inflation further cut the pur-
chasing power of every defense dollar. 
In August, his botched Afghanistan 
retreat shattered our allies’ trust and 
delighted the terrorists. In 10 months 
in office, despite naive happy talk from 
the administration, the threats we face 
are markedly worse. The vacuum they 
left in Afghanistan has emboldened ter-
rorists, from Iran’s militias in Iraq, 
Syria, and Yemen to the highest ranks 
of the Taliban’s government. 
Their desperation to return to a 
failed nuclear deal has given Iran the 
upper hand in negotiations. 
For 4 years, my colleague the Demo-
cratic leader seemed constantly fo-
cused on Putin and Russia. But now, 
with Putin flaunting his power and 
Russia engaged in ongoing cyber at-
tacks, weapons tests, and troop build-
ups? Crickets. 
And for all their talk about China’s 
threat, we have seen no evidence that 
Democrats intend for the United States 
to keep pace with the PLA’s invest-
ments in nuclear and hypersonic weap-
ons. 
The 
bipartisan 
National 
Defense 
Strategy Commission has made clear 
that we cannot shortchange our mili-
tary modernization and have a prayer 
of competing with the People’s Repub-
lic of China or even the declining but 
dangerous Russian Republic. 
Our colleagues across the aisle have 
missed one opportunity after another 
to right the ship. They have used the 
reconciliation process to pass trillions 
in new partisan spending without a 
cent for defending the Nation. 
And despite the strong bipartisan 
work of our colleagues on the Armed 
Services Committee, the Democratic 
leader kept this year’s Defense author-
ization bill in limbo literally for 
months and now wants to block the 
Senate from a real debate and a real 
amendment process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8769 
November 29, 2021 
Debating the right way to confront 
Russian threats to America and our al-
lies and equip our friends in Ukraine is 
certainly worth the Senate’s time. 
Putin is massing tens of thousands of 
troops on Ukraine’s border, but the 
Democratic leader is trying to block a 
debate about responding to Russian ag-
gression? It makes no sense. 
Considering sanctions on the pipeline 
that fuels Putin’s encroachment over 
Europe—including provisions from Sen-
ator RISCH
that closely mirror lan-
guage that the House added unani-
mously—is certainly worth the Sen-
ate’s time. Setting the record straight 
on our resolve to maintain a strong 
and credible nuclear deterrent that can 
check the worst impulses of our adver-
saries is also worth the Senate’s time. 
Yet, once again, the Democratic lead-
er seems to want to put national secu-
rity last. My colleague is trying to 
overcorrect for poor planning by cram-
ming a 2-week bill into 2 or 3 days’ 
time. I imagine there might be finger- 
pointing at the Republicans if that 
proves impossible. 
So nothing less than the safety of the 
American people is at stake. This is 
more important than political time-
tables or partisan wish lists. So if the 
Democratic leader insists on forcing a 
cloture vote later today, I will oppose 
cutting off these important debates 
prematurely when they have really 
just begun. 
f 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on a related matter, why do our 
Democratic colleagues want to short-
change our national defense? Well, to 
free up their time and attention for an-
other massive, reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree, a radical wish list that 
would hurt American families and help 
China. 
Working families are already getting 
slammed by runaway costs because the 
Democrats’ last massive spending spree 
drove up inflation. Gas prices are up 
about 50 percent, used car prices are up 
more than 25 percent, and grocery 
prices across practically every cat-
egory are up significantly over this 
time last year. 
But, in response, Washington Demo-
crats want to print, borrow, and spend 
trillions more. Even if you accept all 
their budget gimmicks at face value, 
this bill alone would unleash $800 bil-
lion in not-paid-for spending in the 
next 5 years. Years 5 through 10 are 
when their crushing tax hikes and 
phony accounting would actually begin 
to kick in. But even then the bill is not 
paid for. 
President Biden promised Americans 
over and over that this legislation 
would cost zero dollars. Obviously, that 
is false. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice says that after 10 years, after their 
tax hikes and fake offsets are factored 
in, their spree would still add up to $367 
billion and add that all to the deficit. 
President Biden said the deficit im-
pact would be zero. In reality, it is 
hundreds and hundreds of billions of 
dollars. 
President Biden promised Americans 
something else too. He said he would 
never raise taxes on the middle class. 
People earning less than $400,000 per 
year were not to pay a penny more. He 
has completely broken this promise as 
well. 
Among the $1.5 trillion in job-killing 
tax increases are new burdens for small 
businesses, family farms, and direct 
hikes on middle-class families earning 
less than six figures. Meanwhile, amaz-
ingly, Democrats did find room in their 
plan to include $300 billion in tax cuts 
for the wealthiest blue-State ZIP codes 
in New York and California. Our col-
leagues want to pretend they are 
launching another New Deal. Yet one 
of the biggest components is a direct 
cash giveaway to their richest con-
stituents. 
So the cost of this spending spree 
would be astronomical, and the mas-
sive tax hikes that would only partly 
pay for it would literally crush an al-
ready fragile economy. 
Well, what about the content of the 
liberal wish list? If Democrats get to 
steal the American people’s credit card 
for this historic spending spree, what 
would our citizens even get to unwrap? 
Well, there would be massive govern-
ment giveaways to supposedly green 
initiatives, giving rise to a whole new 
generation of waste and abuse like 
Solyndra. 
There would be a gigantic slush fund 
so that HHS Secretary Becerra, the 
culture warrior who sued Catholic 
nuns, could take over daycare and pre-
kindergarten across America. He would 
be in charge of subsidizing certain 
kinds of private family choices but not 
others and tilting the playing field 
against faith-based childcare. 
There would be a continuation of in-
flationary 
welfare 
payments 
that 
Washington is sending out with zero 
work requirements whatsoever, and il-
legal immigrants would get the money 
as well. Oh, and, as we speak, Senate 
Democrats are still trying desperately 
behind the scenes to get sweeping am-
nesty included in the bill as well. 
So it goes on and on like this, a 
hodgepodge catalog that is built to sat-
isfy the demands of activists, not the 
needs of families. If you ask any work-
ing-class 
or 
middle-class 
American 
family for their top concerns, you 
aren’t going to hear many people pin-
ing for massive tax hikes, electric car 
charging stations, and woke bureau-
crats getting control of their kids’ 
early childhoods. 
My colleagues across the aisle seem 
determined to spend the weeks ahead 
on ways to waste Americans’ money 
while making Americans’ problems 
even worse. So let’s hope enough of our 
Democratic colleagues step back, take 
stock, do the responsible thing, and 
kill this bill.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

HUNTER BIDEN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today I am going to highlight a new 
Hunter Biden record that I have re-
cently made public. 
Before I get to that point, I am going 
to take a trip down memory lane—yes, 
down memory lane. 
On September 23, 2020, Senator JOHN-
SON and I released our ‘‘Biden Report,’’ 
as it has been called. That report fo-
cused on questionable financial trans-
actions between the Biden family and 
foreign, 
government-linked 
individ-
uals. 
On November 18, 2020, we released a 
supplemental to that report. I am 
going to read several statements from 
the media and my Democratic col-
leagues about our report. 
So, to start with, on September 23, 
2020, a New York Times article by 
Nicholas Fandos described it in two 
ways: ‘‘lack of meaningful new infor-
mation’’ and ‘‘overlap with a Russian 
disinformation campaign.’’ 
And the then-Democratic minority 
leader was quoted in the same article

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8770 
November 29, 2021 
and said the report read ‘‘as if Putin 
wrote it, not United States senators.’’ 
A September 23, 2020, Salon article by 
Igor Derysh quoted a Democratic Sen-
ator saying that the report was the cul-
mination of a ‘‘sham investigation.’’ In 
that article, the same Democratic Sen-
ator described our investigation as 
being ‘‘rooted in disinformation’’ from 
Russian operatives. 
Separately, a Democratic Senator 
also said about our report: ‘‘Bottom 
line: The Johnson-Grassley investiga-
tion is baseless. It’s laundering Russian 
propaganda for circulation in the U.S.’’ 
In a September 23, 2020, CBS article 
by Melissa Quinn, another Democratic 
Senator said about our report, meaning 
the 
Johnson-Grassley 
report: 
‘‘The 
chairmen have amplified a known Rus-
sian attack on our election,’’ and ‘‘It is 
unconscionable that the chairmen are 
continuing to advance false informa-
tion intended to undermine our demo-
cratic process at the expense of bipar-
tisan work that we should be doing to 
protect our national security.’’ 
That same CBS article said that our 
report ‘‘reveals little new informa-
tion.’’ 
And one Washington Post columnist, 
Josh Rogin, said: ‘‘Even after accepting 
disinformation from Russian agents, 
Johnson and Grassley couldn’t come up 
with anything new or interesting on 
Hunter Biden.’’ 
So understand this: Week after week, 
month after month, year after year, 
the media and my Democratic col-
leagues falsely attacked our investiga-
tion with reckless disregard for the 
truth. I have spoken at length on the 
Senate floor rebutting all these false 
charges with example after example. I 
did so on May 11, 2021; March 18, 2021; 
December 14, 2020; December 10, 2020; 
October 19, 2020; and September 29, 2020. 
Well, on November 15, this year, Sen-
ator JOHNSON and I publicly released a 
record that I placed in part on this 
poster next to me, and I will get to this 
in a minute. The full document illus-
trates an assignment and assumption 
of business interests. 
The part next to me is a signature 
block in unaltered form, including one 
typographical 
error. 
The 
signature 
block includes Hunter Biden, two of his 
companies, and individuals connected 
to the communist Chinese regime. 
These are the main companies that 
Hunter Biden and his associates used 
to funnel money all over the world: 
Hudson West III, Hudson V, and then 
the other ones are ColdHarbour Capital 
and Owasco. Owasco is Hunter Biden’s 
firm that was the recipient of millions 
of dollars from questionable financial 
transactions. 
Gongwen Dong was the right-hand 
man for the owner of a company called 
CEFC China Energy Company. Mervyn 
Yan was his associate. CEFC was an 
arm of the Chinese Government. Hun-
ter Biden was a close business partner 
of these men and their companies. 
Therefore, this signature block shows a 
direct financial and legal relationship 
between Hunter Biden and individuals 
connected to the communist regime. 
Now, these are the same folks and 
companies that we discussed at length 
in our September 2020 report. This new 
document is yet another record that 
substantiates our report that we issued 
September 2020—that same report that 
the media and my Democratic col-
leagues said was based on Russian 
disinformation. 
So I now say to the media and I now 
say to my Democratic colleagues who 
said 
our 
report 
was 
Russian 
disinformation, this question: Is this 
signature 
block 
Russian 
disinformation? Are the names of these 
companies Russian disinformation? Is 
this document disinformation? 
No. This is a legitimate record that 
my staff uncovered, and it didn’t come 
from the Hunter Biden laptop. This is 
the same type of record that Senator 
JOHNSON and I based our report several 
months ago on. 
To my Democratic colleagues who 
falsely smeared our report: You are in 
the majority. You are now committee 
chairs, and you have jurisdiction over 
these matters. So I want to challenge 
you to use the same effort and energy 
that you exerted in the Trump-Russia 
investigation to expose the extensive 
ties between the Chinese regime and 
members of the Biden family. 
I think I speak with some credibility 
on this point because you know there 
was a President Trump, and at the 
time there was a President Trump, I 
investigated Donald Trump, Jr., on 
things that were appropriate at that 
time to ask legitimate questions about 
in the constitutional role of congres-
sional oversight. 
EDUCATION 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter—and this will be my last statement 
for the day—I have always been a critic 
of one-size-fits-all government, and 
there are few places where this is more 
inappropriate than education. Each 
child is different, and if we offer a 
cookie-cutter, assembly-line education, 
it will hurt all students. 
Whether we are talking about stu-
dents with gifts and talents or those 
with 
learning 
disabilities, 
students 
with unique learning needs must have 
teachers trained to address their way 
of learning. It may seem like common 
sense to say that, that students benefit 
when their education is tailored to 
their individual needs. Any parent can 
tell you that. You can’t expect all stu-
dents to learn at the same speed and 
depth in every subject. 
Unfortunately, those like outgoing 
New York Mayor de Blasio want to 
scrap programs for gifted students. Cit-
ing the fact that White and Asian stu-
dents were overperforming compared 
to students from other ethnic cat-
egories, de Blasio tried to end the 
city’s program. 
His focus on maintaining equality of 
outcomes by preventing any students 
from excelling is a misguided policy. It 
would have the perverse effect of re-
ducing opportunity for the very stu-
dents who need it most, including his-
torically 
disadvantaged 
minority 
groups. 
Now, we all know that wealthy fami-
lies can afford to put their kids in pri-
vate schools or pay for services outside 
of the schools. It is those students who 
aren’t as well off who need access to 
services to address their unique learn-
ing needs. Families from less advan-
taged backgrounds are not helped by 
limiting opportunities for all students 
in public schools. They are the ones 
who have the most to lose when public 
schools cancel needed services. 
Thankfully, the incoming New York 
mayor recognizes the importance of 
gifted and talented programming and 
has pledged to keep it. 
I introduced the TALENT Act to ad-
dress these unique needs of gifted and 
talented students and ensure that they 
don’t slip through the cracks. Thank-
fully, much of this bill was included in 
Every Child Achieves in the year 2015. 
But I am also a strong supporter of 
Javits Gifted and Talented Education. 
This is the only dedicated Federal pro-
gram to develop and help teachers im-
plement teaching methods that meet 
the needs of gifted students, and it is 
targeted specifically to disadvantaged 
gifted students. 
Thankfully, my State of Iowa is a 
leader in this area. Iowa law requires 
gifted education services for kids who 
need to be challenged. This applies to 
all students, whether or not they can 
afford private schools. Iowa has recog-
nized that we should aim to challenge 
kids with gifts and talents and give 
them the resources they need to excel. 
We should help all students achieve 
their potential, not try in vain to find 
one identical education for every kid. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, here 
we are, following the Thanksgiving 
holiday, where I hope that people got 
to get together with friends and family 
and enjoy a little respite from the hec-
tic schedule here in Congress. But here 
we are now, with just a few short days 
intervening between now and Christ-
mas, and the end-of-the-year legisla-
tive mad dash is officially upon us. 
This 
year, 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues, who control the Senate agen-
da, have ignored some of the Senate’s 
most important and basic responsibil-
ities, leaving us with a whole lot to do 
and not a whole lot of time in which to 
do it. 
In 
September, 
when 
the 
Senate 
should have passed a group of bills to

November 29, 2021 
fund the government for the next fiscal 
year, our colleagues instead kicked the 
can down the road. You would have 
thought they would have used the past 
couple of months to pass the annual 
appropriations bills, which is one of 
most basic and fundamental respon-
sibilities of Congress; but, no, they 
chose not to do that. 
Instead, our Democratic colleagues 
found time for partisan, dead-on-ar-
rival messaging bills while they failed 
to bring a single appropriations bill to 
the floor with a December 3 deadline. 
As things stand today, it looks like 
these funding bills are nowhere near 
ready. This risks leaving millions of 
Americans without a paycheck right 
before 
the 
Christmas 
holidays 
or 
punting on our funding responsibilities 
once again. 
And that is not the only potential 
fiscal disaster we are careening toward. 
At some point in the coming days, 
weeks, or months—we don’t know ex-
actly when; only Secretary Yellen 
knows—the U.S. will run up against 
the debt limit. That is, we have maxed 
out our credit card and, unless our 
Democratic colleagues decide to raise 
that credit limit, we will exhaust the 
credit of the United States Govern-
ment. 
It kind of feels a little like ‘‘Ground-
hog Day’’ because we saw this movie 
just about 2 months ago. 
Democrats had a clear roadmap and 
ample time to increase the debt ceiling 
on their own and avoid a financial cri-
sis, but they stubbornly refused. They 
said they didn’t have enough time. 
Well, they don’t have that excuse now. 
And, even then, they have known 
since July that Republicans would not 
help them with another partisan spend-
ing spree. So we find ourselves staring 
down the barrel of a potential eco-
nomic crisis, but our colleagues can’t 
blame the calendar for not having 
enough time again. 
If our Democratic colleagues want to 
exclude 
Republicans 
and 
continue 
spending on a purely partisan basis, 
they will have to raise the debt ceiling 
in a partisan fashion. They have proven 
they are OK with spending trillions of 
dollars of borrowed money without a 
single Republican vote. It is not too 
much to say that they should be held 
accountable for that reckless course of 
conduct. 
Of course, before the Senate address-
es either one of those crises, there is 
another item on the agenda: The Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
Congress has passed the National De-
fense Authorization Act each year for 
the last 60 years, and for good reason. 
It is the case, I believe, that our na-
tional security is the single most im-
portant duty that we have here in the 
Senate. But this bill has been waiting 
in the wings for months, ready for floor 
action, and both the chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee and the 
ranking member have had to push the 
majority leader to actually bring this 
to the Senate floor, even at this late 
date. 
So 2 weeks ago, before the Thanks-
giving holidays, the Senate finally 
began consideration of the Defense Au-
thorization Act, and we hope we can 
actually do what the Senate is sup-
posed to do, which is to vote on amend-
ments to that bill and then pass it in 
the coming days. But the fact is, it is 
nearly December, and the fact that it 
has not been done yet is simply inex-
plicable. 
Now, with such a big to-do list and so 
little time to do it, you would think 
our colleagues would be laser focused 
on this hefty end-of-the-year agenda: 
funding the government, avoiding a 
debt crisis, strengthening our military, 
and supporting our volunteer military 
forces and their families. 
None of the Senate’s most basic re-
sponsibilities have been attended to; 
and, as it stands today, the Senate is 
only scheduled to be in session for a 
handful of days before the Christmas 
holidays. 
Well, unfortunately, our Democratic 
colleagues think they have an even 
more important job to do. Forget the 
millions of government employees who 
could be left without a paycheck before 
the holidays, or the economic crisis 
that will cripple our country if we de-
faulted on our debt. Our Democratic 
colleagues are laser focused on their 
multitrillion-dollar 
tax-and-spending 
spree. 
After months of party infighting and 
countless iterations of this bill, the 
Democratic leaders in the House—most 
notably Speaker PELOSI—finally man-
aged to pass a partisan version of this 
bill. They couldn’t even convince every 
Democrat to vote for the bill, which is 
an indication of how problematic it is. 
What we are talking about is an ab-
solutely massive bill that would in-
crease the role and power of the Fed-
eral Government and Americans’ lives 
in an unprecedented fashion. It would 
reshape how we take care of our chil-
dren, our healthcare system, our en-
ergy, our educational systems. Vir-
tually every aspect of American citi-
zens’ daily lives would be affected by 
this monstrosity. 
And, of course, these programs don’t 
come cheap, but Democrats have pulled 
every gimmick in the book to hide the 
true cost. They have filled this bill 
with arbitrary sunsets and cliffs and 
expirations that make these programs 
appear to cost less than we know they 
actually will. 
One example is the expanded child 
tax credit. As originally drafted, this 
policy was a temporary measure in 
their bill that became law in March, 
just 8 months ago. Earlier drafts of the 
so-called Build Back Better legislation 
would 
have 
extended 
that 
policy 
through 2025, even though it seemed all 
but certain that Democrats would later 
try to make it permanent. 
When Democrats needed to cut the 
overall pricetag of the bill to convince 
their own Members to vote for it, the 
expanded child tax credit was scaled 
back to a 1-year extension. But nothing 
has really changed. I have no expecta-
tion that this or a number of other so- 
called temporary programs in this bill 
will actually expire. 
As President Ronald Reagan once fa-
mously said, the closest thing to eter-
nal life on Earth is a temporary gov-
ernment program. 
If all the temporary provisions in 
this bill are made permanent, it will 
cost a whole lot more than is adver-
tised. And the budget experts at the 
University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton 
School of Business have given us an es-
timate of how much more it will cost. 
Of course, there is President Biden, 
who said it will cost zero. Nobody be-
lieves that. Others have said, well, it is 
a $1.75 trillion bill. And I would argue 
that, based on all the budget gim-
mickry, you can’t really believe that 
either. 
The University of Pennsylvania’s 
Wharton School of Business pegs the 
price at close to $4.6 trillion over 10 
years—that is the budget window— 
more than 21⁄2 times the amount Demo-
crats have previously stated. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget agrees with that esti-
mate. They estimate that the true cost 
of this bill would be approximately $5 
trillion over the next 10 years. That is 
$5 trillion in largely borrowed money 
that would have to be paid back by 
somebody. That is a whole lot more 
than the $1.75 trillion pricetag that the 
press has reported based on the incred-
ible estimates that our Democratic col-
leagues have provided. 
Of course, that flies in the face of 
President Biden’s estimate that it 
would cost nothing. Well, again, we un-
derstand that is not true, and the 1.75 
trillion pricetag is not true either. 
Last week, I sent a letter to the lead-
ers of the Congressional Budget Office 
and the Joint Committee on Taxation 
requesting a true cost estimate for this 
bill. The American people deserve a 
full and complete picture of the real- 
world price of this legislation. And be-
fore voting on the bill, every Member 
of the Senate, both Republicans and 
Democrats, should want to know how 
much this legislation is going to end up 
costing the American people. 
The pricetag of this bill is deeply 
concerning, but that is only part of 
what makes this legislation so dan-
gerous. As I said earlier, it dramati-
cally increases the role of the Federal 
Government in every aspect of our 
lives. It drives up taxes on working 
families; it harms our energy security; 
and it hurts our competitiveness on the 
global stage, which hands a big win to 
China. 
That, apparently, is the priority for 
our Democratic colleagues right now, 
not the looming debt crisis or potential 
government shutdown. They are fo-
cused on legislation that actually does 
more harm than good. 
Our Democratic colleagues control 
the Senate agenda. They control the 
House, and they control the White 
House. They control every lever in the

legislative process here in Washington, 
DC, and this is how they have chosen 
to use that power. 
Our Democratic colleagues continue 
to prove that they are not doing what 
is best for the American people. If it 
was, then there would be an effort to 
build a bipartisan consensus for this 
legislation. 
Instead, they are using raw partisan 
political power to jam through an 
agenda that they know will end up 
costing somewhere around $5 trillion 
and that will permanently alter the re-
lationship of the American people to 
the Federal Government. 
For our country’s sake, I hope some-
thing changes between now and the 
time we actually take up this partisan 
tax-and-spending spree bill that has 
been passed by the House of Represent-
atives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I imagine many of us in this 
Chamber had a wonderful week talking 
with Tennesseans—with our constitu-
ents. 
In Tennessee, I will tell you this: We 
had a fabulous week. And everywhere I 
went, whether it was the grocery store 
or somewhere with the grandchildren, I 
was hearing from people about the 
issues that are in front of us, and they 
are really curious to see what is going 
to end up happening as we take up 
issues here in DC. 
And I talked with a lot of our county 
mayors, who are quite concerned about 
what is happening with the American 
Recovery Act funding and how they are 
going to be able to use that funding. 
They are very concerned about the 
infrastructure bill, and, you know, 
they were really a little bit surprised 
to find out that so little of the bill ac-
tually goes to infrastructure. I think 
they were really disappointed in that 
because what they are interested in is 
money for roads and bridges and high-
ways and ports and broadband, and 
were really disappointed in the empha-
sis in the bill on mass transit. 
So what we have realized is that they 
have a lot of questions. They look 
around and they say: Well, in Wash-
ington, you have got a lot of spinning 
wheels going on and not a lot of for-
ward motion. 
And I have to agree because, in Wash-
ington, it does appear that the Presi-
dent and many of my Democrat col-
leagues are spinning their wheels in 
the same rut that they were stuck in 
before the holiday, proving once again 
that, while they understand very little 
about the economy, they understand 
even less about where the American 
people are. 
Since day 1 of this administration, 
the White House has made it clear that 
governing is not a priority. Gov-
erning—working with the House, work-
ing with the Senate to find solutions. 
But, instead, this administration is 
doing all it can to force the country 
onto a path that the people have said 
time and again they don’t want to 
travel this path. It is not where they 
want to go. 
By all accounts, businesses are, at 
least, a year out from a return to nor-
mal, which we continue to hear a lot 
about that. Everybody would like to be 
back to prepandemic normal. 
Our supply chains are a mess. Ships 
that are loaded with goods cannot get 
to ports. Inflation is, unfortunately, 
here to stay. It definitely wasn’t tran-
sitory. Families are having an increas-
ingly difficult time putting food on the 
table and gas in the car because a dol-
lar doesn’t go as far as it once went, 
and this is something every family is 
wrestling with. Even with all of this 
right in front of their faces, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are more concerned 
with how they will leverage these prob-
lems rather than how they are going to 
solve these problems. What solutions 
that they have proposed are completely 
divorced from reality and come loaded 
with more internal political strife than 
they are worth. This, of course, is the 
logical conclusion of a year where con-
sensus took a backseat to the whims of 
the loudest and most radical leftist 
wing of the Democratic Party. 
Over the past week, the media has 
dripped out story after story covering 
the cost of inflation, the consequences 
of failing to fund the government, and 
the upcoming debate over the debt 
limit. And if you thought the message 
coming from the White House and from 
my Democratic colleagues in response 
to all this was jumbled before, prepare 
yourself for something even more cha-
otic in the days to come. 
My colleagues across the aisle, unfor-
tunately, still seem to be under the im-
pression that Senate Republicans are 
going to band together to save them 
from the hole they have dug for them-
selves. They think we are going to en-
dorse fiscal policy so destructive that 
many experts who are normally friend-
ly to the White House have refused to 
support these ideas—and with good rea-
son. They are a socialist, government- 
controlled agenda. 
We have been down this road before. 
So my Democratic colleagues know 
that going through the motions of bi-
partisanship isn’t going to be enough 
because we went through this months 
ago with the debt ceiling and on the 
matter of funding the government. We 
would have settled all of these issues 
months ago if the majority had their 
priorities in line and if they could ar-
ticulate clearly to the American people 
what the priorities are, what the prob-
lems are, what the challenges are, and 
bring forward solutions for the Amer-
ican people to look at and say: Yeah, 
that makes sense. But that is not what 
they have done and what they continue 
to do. 
Here is the problem with where they 
are: The priorities of the Democratic 
Party are not the priorities of the 
American people. Out in the real world, 
inflation is a problem. Spending and 
debt—all of that means something. 
How you spend your money means 
something. People understand that. 
They get it. 
But according to the majority here in 
the 
Democratic-controlled 
Senate, 
none of these things actually matter in 
practice. In fact, the past few months 
have shown us that among Democrats, 
there is no real consensus about what, 
if anything, these major debates mean 
to them or what is the end game. It is 
amazing. They can’t tell you. If you 
are here to solve problems or create 
problems, people are going to figure 
that out—the American people are. 
And they know that the question 
should be: Are you here to solve prob-
lems or create problems for your polit-
ical enemies in a way that ensures you 
are punishing people? 
Now, that is the question that people 
are asking. Is the debt limit a legal fic-
tion or a meaningful check on reckless 
spending? That is a question that we 
have heard. Is it just something that 
gets tossed around? Is funding the gov-
ernment part of your duty or is the ap-
propriations debate just fuel for talk-
ing points? I think we know the major-
ity’s answers to all of these questions, 
and I think their answer is probably 
coming down on the wrong side of 
where the American people are. 
Those looking for good faith from the 
White House are seeming to not find it, 
nor are they finding any evidence that 
Democrats in Congress are aware of 
their moral obligation to be discerning 
and truthful about how they plan to 
spend trillions in taxpayer money. 
There is a reason that the Democrats 
lied about the costs associated with 
their massive social spending bill, 
which reflects the priorities of liberal, 
leftist activists rather than the prior-
ities of the American people. They 
claimed it was paid for, but in reality 
it will add $367 billion to the deficit 
and cost taxpayers more than another 
$400 billion. That is why they have not 
been truthful with the American people 
that needed more buy-in in order for 
the Democrats to make this happen— 
even when they knew the CBO report 
was going to come and show how much 
debt was going to be added if this bill 
got passed. 
They know the people don’t want 
this big spending bill. They know that 
the American people know that we can-
not afford this. Our children and our 
grandchildren cannot afford this bill. 
As my colleague from Texas was say-
ing, it is not $1.5 trillion or $1.75 tril-
lion. It is trillions—trillions—of dollars 
in spending. And we know how some 
across the aisle are kind of, with a 
wink-wink and a nod-nod, saying: Yes, 
let’s get these on the books, and then 
things will take care of themselves. 
This week, we are facing the prospect 
of yet another government shutdown, 
which means another eleventh-hour op-
portunity 
for 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues to complain about Republican 
obstruction. But what the Democrats

November 29, 2021 
need to realize is that Republicans are 
not the problem here. The Democrats 
are in charge of this Chamber, the 
House, and the White House. 
And not even the Democrats in power 
can agree on how much they want to 
spend and how they want to spend it. If 
they had consensus and if that con-
sensus came from listening to the peo-
ple that elected them to serve, we 
wouldn’t be staring at the prospect of 
another government shutdown. No, you 
would see Democrats marching to the 
Chamber in lockstep to vote for a con-
tinuing resolution that reflects goals 
that don’t change with the news cycle. 
But there is no consensus. The people 
driving the ship have lost all sense of 
direction, and in doing so, they are los-
ing the faith the American people have 
put in them. 
In Tennessee, we would say that our 
friends across the aisle are in the mid-
dle of a good old-fashioned come-apart, 
and there is one way and only one way 
to reverse the damage, and that is to 
stop worrying about politics and push-
ing a leftist agenda and start worrying 
about meeting the needs of the Amer-
ican people—not only today but the 
needs of our children and grand-
children. What are we going to do to 
their hopes and their dreams for living 
their version of the American dream? 
So we should agree, no more blame, 
no more budget gimmicks—open our 
eyes to the reality of the situation that 
we are dealing with. We have a job to 
do here, and the sooner my Democratic 
colleagues remember that fact, the 
sooner they will be able to earn back 
the faith and the trust of the American 
people. That is priority No. 1, and it is 
time for my colleagues to prove that 
they understand it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I want 
to talk about the national defense bill, 
but first I do want to respond just in 
one particular to the comments of the 
gentlelady from Tennessee because I 
have heard this before, the idea that 
the infrastructure bill isn’t infrastruc-
ture. 
I don’t get how anybody is making 
that claim. Here is the list: roads and 
bridges, highway safety, public transit, 
rail, broadband, ports, airports, the 
electric grid, water, and Superfund 
cleanup. Yes, there are some items for 
EVs and for the facilitating of the elec-
trification of our transportation sys-
tem, but the vast bulk of it is what 
anybody would call infrastructure. 
Infrastructure is something you can 
kick. Infrastructure is something you 
can feel. And that is what we are talk-
ing about here—roads and bridges, 
ports, airports, rail, broadband. That is 
the infrastructure of the 21st century. 
This is an infrastructure bill, and it 
ought to be recognized as such. 
There are plenty of things we can 
argue and differ with around here, but 
this shouldn’t be one of them. And peo-
ple are confused about it because they 
are being given confusing information. 
They are being told it is not an infra-
structure bill; there is no infrastruc-
ture. I have heard that. It is simply not 
true. So let’s argue about the things 
that, you know, we have genuine policy 
differences, but let’s not talk about 
things that just aren’t the case. Ports, 
bridges, railroad, public transit—and, 
yes, public transit is infrastructure. It 
may not be in Tennessee. It may not be 
so much in Maine, although I suspect 
there is some in Tennessee and there is 
some in Maine, but public transpor-
tation is critical to our citizens. 
Broadband, airports, electric grid, 
water—that is infrastructure. 
H.R. 4350 
Now, in a few moments, we will have 
what I hope is not a historic vote. It 
shouldn’t be a historic vote. It ought to 
be a boring vote. The vote is to proceed 
to the National Defense Authorization 
Act for 2022, just as we have done for 60 
years’ running. But I understand that 
there is a movement afoot to derail it 
because there haven’t been enough 
amendments. ‘‘I didn’t get my amend-
ment in; therefore, I am going to block 
this bill.’’ 
Well, let’s talk a little bit about the 
history of the bill. I serve on the 
Armed Services Committee, as does the 
Presiding Officer, and both of us can 
attest that the Armed Services Com-
mittee is one of the most nonpartisan 
committees in the U.S. Senate. In fact, 
in the Armed—let’s talk about amend-
ments for a minute. In the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, during our markup, we 
adopted 
145 
amendments—most 
by 
agreement, by bipartisan agreement, 
by unanimous consent. There were a 
few rollcall votes but not very many. 
And in my experience in 9 years on 
that committee, there have only been a 
handful of party-line rollcall votes in 
the Armed Services Committee. 
It produces some very odd bedfellows, 
and some combinations that don’t 
make much sense politically, but it is 
because the members of the committee 
put the interests of the United States 
of America first and make their deci-
sion on that, not on politics. 
So there were 145 amendments in the 
committee. Then there is a managers’ 
package that we are going to be voting 
on today that has 57 amendments in 
it—27 supported by Republicans and 27 
by Democrats and 3 that are entirely 
bipartisan. So we are up to 202 amend-
ments. That is a lot of amendments to 
a piece of legislation, not to mention 
the fact that the managers’ package 
within the committee was developed 
largely by consensus between the two 
party leaders, Chairman REED
and 
Ranking Member INHOFE. So this proc-
ess is replete with amendments and 
compromise, and that is how it has 
been done for the past 60 years. 
Now, last week, before we left, we 
had another 18 amendments that were 
agreed upon by both parties to bring up 
as a package—not as a package; I am 
sorry—to be considered one at a time 
and be voted on. 
That process was killed by a group of 
Senators who said: No. I want my 
amendment. I am not on the list, and, 
therefore, I am going to object to the 
unanimous consent request, so nobody 
gets their amendments. 
So, today, we are going to be voting 
on the motion to proceed to the sub-
stitute amendment that is chock-full 
of bipartisan amendments. It doesn’t 
have all of the amendments everybody 
wants. It doesn’t have a couple of 
amendments that I feel are very impor-
tant. 
But do you know what? To quote my 
favorite philosopher, Mick Jagger: You 
don’t always get what you want, but, if 
you try sometimes, you just might find 
you get what you need. 
And that is what we have got right 
here, is what we need. 
This is the defense of the United 
States of America. Why can’t we do 
just one bill without politics and with-
out stamping our feet, saying, ‘‘I didn’t 
get my amendment, so I am going to 
vote against it’’? 
By the way, this is a vote on a mo-
tion to proceed, which, in my view, 
ought to be just the most routine pos-
sible vote. It is not a vote on the bill 
itself. Let’s proceed to this bill. Let’s 
proceed to the bipartisan managers’ 
package that has been worked out, 
painstakingly, over the last several 
months. 
Let’s think about what this bill is all 
about. This isn’t ordinary policy. This 
is the national security of this coun-
try. This is a pay raise for our troops. 
This is national security that our peo-
ple depend upon. That is our most fun-
damental responsibility. In the pre-
amble of the Constitution, one of the 
key responsibilities is to provide for 
the common defense. That is why you 
have governments in the first place. 
We have done it for 60 years in a row. 
I urge my colleagues—this isn’t a mo-
ment for partisanship or for com-
plaining about, you know, ‘‘I didn’t get 
my amendment, so I am not going to 
vote for it.’’ You know, suck it up. 
I am going to vote for it. As I say, 
there are a couple of amendments that 
I felt very passionately about involving 
cyber and the protection of the coun-
try. They aren’t in, but I am still going 
to vote for it, because that is our re-
sponsibility. 
This is the most fundamental respon-
sibility we have around here. We have 
a bipartisan process, and it came out of 
committee 23 to 3. Two Republicans 
and one Democrat voted against it. 
That is as close to unanimity as you 
can get on an important piece of policy 
legislation. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote yes 
on the motion to proceed, and then to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8774 
November 29, 2021 
move the bill later this week—to meet 
our responsibility to the American peo-
ple, to meet the responsibility that 
every Congress has met for the last 60 
years. 
If we don’t do that because we are 
angry that we didn’t get something in 
or there weren’t enough amendments— 
there are 202 amendments built on top 
of, already, a bipartisan package that 
was produced in the chairman’s mark-
up in committee. That, to me, is pretty 
full consideration. 
I hope my colleagues will vote yes to 
proceed to this bill. It is our responsi-
bility and, more than that, it is what is 
necessary to protect this country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let 
me, first of all, say that I would have a 
hard time finding a better friend than 
the Member who just spoke. We have 
been good friends for a long period of 
time, and we have not been apart on 
very many votes; yet we are not of the 
same party. Nonetheless, we are going 
to have to do something that is the 
same thing we had to do 5 years ago, 
and really for kind of the same reason. 
Every year, when the Senate turns to 
the NDAA, we call it our must-pass 
bill. It is a must-pass bill, and it is a 
bill that will pass. It is a must-pass be-
cause it gives our troops the pay that 
they have earned and the tools and the 
training that they need to fight and to 
win against our enemies. 
That is why we have passed the 
NDAA every year for 60 straight years. 
This year will be 61. This is pretty 
much the only authorization bill that 
gets done the way it should year after 
year. In fact, it is pretty much the only 
bill—period—that Congress does every 
single year without fail. 
However, no matter how important it 
is, that doesn’t mean that we will ac-
cept the fact that Senator SCHUMER 
wants to jam it through the Senate 
without adequate consideration. 
Let me be clear. Senator SCHUMER 
has put us in this position today. He 
waited more than 2 months after we 
filed the NDAA to bring it to the floor. 
For 2 months, we could have been dis-
cussing this and having it and treating 
it like we should. 
He tried to tack it onto his unrelated 
legislation just as many of us, includ-
ing my Democrat colleague in the 
House, ADAM SMITH, guessed that he 
would, and now he wants a floor vote 
on this bill—the most important bill 
that we do all year—to be enough, de-
spite the fact that he isn’t giving us 
ample time to debate the bill, and he 
certainly hasn’t been willing to enter-
tain an open amendment process. 
We have been trying to get this for a 
long period of time, and we haven’t 
gotten it—the most important bill of 
the year. 
I think Americans back home are 
smart enough to understand that our 
servicemembers deserve more. They de-
serve to be our priority in the Senate, 
and we need to show them, by pro-
viding a robust and open debate on the 
annual Defense bill, that that is how 
we will do it. 
We are in this place right now be-
cause 
Senator 
SCHUMER
won’t 
prioritize national defense and fund our 
troops because the majority leader 
mismanaged the Senate’s schedule. He 
won’t allow votes on bipartisan amend-
ments that make our country more se-
cure. We heard that argument the last 
time we were in session. 
These include an amendment that 
would inflict sanctions against Russia 
to stop its power grab over European 
energy supplies, which simply builds on 
our previous bipartisan NDAAs and 
aligns with the House’s version of the 
NDAA. 
Another amendment on which Sen-
ator SCHUMER would not give a vote 
would tighten import restrictions on 
China to ensure goods sold in the 
United States aren’t made by Uighur 
forced labor. This already passed the 
Senate by voice vote. 
Good 
amendments 
like 
these 
shouldn’t fall victim to the majority 
leader’s failed leadership. 
We all understand how important 
this bill is. It shouldn’t be a partisan 
thing. This is the most important bill 
we do every year. In fact, we have said 
this every year. In fact, I have said this 
more times than any other Member has 
stated it. It is even more important 
now because we are in the most threat-
ened position of our lifetimes. I can’t 
tell you how many times I have dem-
onstrated that fact on the floor of the 
Senate. 
I echo the minority leader’s frustra-
tion. I understand the frustration from 
my colleagues who wanted, in realtime, 
to debate this bill. I think they pled 
their 
case 
very 
effectively. 
We 
wouldn’t be in this position if the ma-
jority leader had brought this bill up 
earlier, which we kept insisting that he 
do, over and over again, on a bipartisan 
plea. 
While I want to be clear that we are 
in this position because Senator SCHU-
MER is forcing this unfortunate action, 
I also want to be equally clear that I 
am still very supportive of this bill, 
and I hope we will pass it soon, but I 
stand with my colleagues who are vot-
ing against the majority leader’s irre-
sponsible management of the bills. We 
have got to get it done, but we can’t 
rush it, and that is why I will be voting 
no on cloture. That is not an easy 
thing for me to do, but I believe we can 
get this bill in better shape. My vote 
against the process is not against the 
bill; it is against the process. 
We are not delaying national secu-
rity, no. This is just the opposite. We 
are demanding that we show, through 
open and robust debate, that our men 
and women in uniform are our priority. 
I have heard this from many of our 
people that I have talked to over the 
weekend and over this past week who 
are really wondering why we didn’t 
have this on the table earlier so we 
could get the debate. I hope that a lot 
of the American people heard the six 
different Republicans who were de-
manding to have their votes and 
amendment process. This is the first 
time, in my memory, that we have not 
had this kind of a process take place, 
and for that reason I will be voting no. 
I do want to hear, of course—and let 
me say something because this might 
be an area of disagreement between my 
partner and myself. 
Senator REED, we have worked on 
these bills together for a long period of 
time. We have been successful, and we 
are going to be successful this time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, it 
would be a very disappointing moment 
if we would fail to invoke cloture. 
This bill, from the very beginning, 
has been completely bipartisan and 
open to amendments. In the course, as 
Senator KING eloquently remarked, of 
the committee hearing, we included 
over 100 amendments on a bipartisan 
basis. We came to the floor with a bill 
that passed our committee 23 to 3— 
overwhelmingly bipartisan. 
We also brought to the floor a sub-
stitute amendment, including, approxi-
mately, 60 amendments that were also 
bipartisan. And then we had another 
series of nearly 20 amendments that 
was bipartisan, that would have been 
voted on, but they were objected to be-
cause several Members did not get 
their amendments. 
Now, just to point out, the majority 
of those amendments aren’t even with-
in the jurisdiction of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. They don’t relate di-
rectly to the men and women of the 
armed services. They might have for-
eign policy implications, but they are 
not something that is essential to the 
passage of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. 
I can recall many times on this floor 
when the NDAA was brought up; both 
sides could not agree on amendments; 
we went through the process; we in-
voked cloture; we voted on the sub-
stitute bill; and we went off to con-
ference. So this would not be the first 
occasion on which, ironically, a few 
people did not get their amendments. 
In fact, on previous occasions, there 
were many, many people who did not 
get their amendments. 
And so, again, I go back to the point 
that we have produced a bipartisan 
piece of legislation. I commend the 
ranking member. We worked with 
closely the subcommittee chairs and 
the subcommittee ranking members. 
The staff has done a superb job. And we 
are here, just one procedural vote away 
from moving forward, and I think we 
should move forward for the benefit of 
the men and women of the armed serv-
ices, as Senator KING, again, so elo-
quently described. 
I think the other factor, too, is that 
eventually we have to reconcile what-
ever we do or attempt to do with the

November 29, 2021 
House of Representatives. Certainly, I 
think it gives us much more credi-
bility, much more clout, and much 
more leverage when we have a strong 
bill that has passed on the floor of the 
Senate. 
We are not talking about 100 amend-
ments that we have to consider. We are 
talking about a handful of Senators 
who didn’t get their way, even though 
many others were frustrated. I think, 
again, our duty is to move forward to 
pass this cloture vote this evening, 
then to move forward to final passage, 
and then to reconcile our differences 
with the House and come back with 
legislation. 
At this point—and I think the rank-
ing member would agree with me—as it 
stands right now, I would be proud to 
pass this legislation because it is bipar-
tisan, it responds to the needs of the 
men and women of the Armed Forces, 
and it establishes robust resources for 
the Department of Defense much more 
than were advocated by the President 
in his budget. 
So we are taking a strong step for-
ward, and I just would hate to see this 
as a sidestep away from final passage. 
I would urge all of my colleagues to 
vote for cloture. 
Mr. KING. Would the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield. 
Mr. KING. Madam President, my 
recollection is—and we have passed 
this bill, as we both have recognized, 
every year for the past 60 years, includ-
ing over the last 4 or 5 years—in the 
last several years, there weren’t that 
many amendments. 
There were a few, and it was always 
agreed in advance. There was a pack-
age, just as we had the other night, but 
everybody didn’t get—there wasn’t an 
unlimited number of amendments or 
votes on amendments. There was gen-
erally 
an 
agreed-upon 
number 
of 
amendments, and it wasn’t very many. 
Is that correct? 
Mr. REED. That is absolutely cor-
rect. 
There have been occasions where we 
have had—once we got the substitute 
adopted—in some cases, no amend-
ments and we went to final passage, ul-
timately, and in other cases, just a 
handful of amendments. Last year, I 
don’t believe we had the kind of 
amendments we are offering this year, 
some of them have nothing whatsoever 
to do with the national defense. The 
nearly 20 amendments we were pro-
posing were nearly equally divided to 
be bipartisan. 
And, frankly, to your point, I think 
this would represent more amendments 
than in the many years I witnessed the 
passage of the NDAA. 
Mr. KING. Thank you. 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on Reed- 
Inhofe substitute amendment No. 3867, as 
modified, to Calendar No. 144, H.R. 4350, a 
bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal 
year 2022 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense, for military construc-
tion, and for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military per-
sonnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes.

MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the failed 
cloture vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is entered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the cloture 
vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 4350, 
ripen upon disposition of substitute 
amendment No. 3867, as modified. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
express my great disappointment that 
some of my colleagues have indicated 
by their vote that they are preventing 
the adoption of the National Defense 
Authorization Act, and they claim that 
more amendments and more debate are 
needed. 
This bill has been bipartisan from the 
beginning. It incorporated over 100 
amendments at the committee level. 
There were approximately 60 additional 
amendments in the substitute, which 
were agreed to on a bipartisan basis. 
Last week before we adjourned, we 
offered nearly 20 more amendments on 
a bipartisan basis, and they were re-
jected by my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side, just as this evening, this 
motion for cloture was rejected by the 
Republicans. They had their oppor-
tunity to consider more amendments. 
We had 19 amendments ready last week 
that were brought forward on an equal 
basis to be debated and voted upon. But 
that was blocked by several of my Re-
publican colleagues. 
One of the ironies this evening is 
that many of my colleagues, who had 
their amendments denied by fellow Re-
publican objections, came down and 
voted against the bill. That doesn’t 
seem to be particularly logical, in my 
mind. 
Now, in the course of NDAAs—and I 
have done a few—there have been peri-
ods in which there has been extensive 
considerations of the bill with very 
few, if any, amendments. There have 
been times in which only a handful of 
amendments were presented before we 
voted on cloture, passed cloture, and 
passed the bill. So this is an unusual 
departure from procedure, particularly 
with a bill that has so much bipartisan 
support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8776 
November 29, 2021 
The bill passed out of committee 23 
to 3 because it represented all of the 
principled points that my colleagues 
wanted. In the course of the committee 
deliberations, there were 300 amend-
ments presented, and we adopted 143. 
Mr. President, let me yield to the 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend 
from Rhode Island. I want to make a 
brief statement about the vote, and 
then I will turn it over to him. 
My colleagues, there should be no 
misunderstanding about the absurdity 
that just played out on the floor. For a 
while now, Republicans have claimed 
they want to pass the Defense author-
ization legislation immediately. They 
said we couldn’t afford to wait any 
longer. They called it a core duty, a 
bare minimum, and they called on me 
to bring it to the floor for a full vote. 
But a few moments ago, Republicans 
just blocked legislation to support our 
troops, support our families, and keep 
Americans safe. Republican dysfunc-
tion has, again, derailed bipartisan 
progress. The Republican choice to 
block our bill and, by an extension, leg-
islation to support our troops and pro-
tect the homeland can be summed up 
in two words: inexplicable and out-
rageous. 
I hope the American people are 
watching. Don’t tell me we aren’t offer-
ing a fair process. We have had ample 
debate. We had amendments from both 
sides. We had a huge number of man-
agers’ 
amendments, 
equal 
numbers 
Democrat and Republican. We offered 
to debate—I believe it is 18 amend-
ments—more than has been on most 
other bills of this type. 
In any other time in history, what we 
offered Republicans would be consid-
ered a very fair and generous com-
promise, but just because a few Repub-
licans didn’t get every single conces-
sion they insisted on, they are now 
halting the process. 
Despite this vote, Democrats will 
continue to work to make sure our 
troops get paid and our vital defense 
programs can continue. 
I thank my colleague for his courtesy 
and yield the floor back to him. 
Mr. REED. I thank the majority 
leader for his comments and just to 
elaborate, this represents what the ma-
jority leader just pointed out—a few 
Members on the other side frustrated 
the entire process and, ironically, frus-
trated many of their own colleagues in 
their caucus who had amendments, ei-
ther in the substitute agreement or 
were ready to be voted on. 
So this is really a question of doing 
our utmost, as we have in the past, not 
for individual points but for the sup-
port of the men and women in the mili-
tary. That was the spirit that guided 
our efforts in the committee. 
Working closely with Senator INHOFE 
and all the Members on both sides, we 
recognized that what we do ultimately 
affects the safety and the welfare of 
our men and women in uniform and 
their families. And this legislation 
would accomplish a great deal. This is, 
in my sense, one of the most bipartisan 
bills we have ever considered. It is un-
fortunate that we can’t move forward 
on a bipartisan basis, consider this bill, 
and then go to the House and come 
back with a final legislation for consid-
eration by this Senate. 
We will have to do an NDAA. It will 
be done. I think Senator INHOFE
is 
committed to that, as I am, and we will 
have to use procedures that are appro-
priate to get it done. But we just 
missed an opportunity to send a clear 
message that we support this legisla-
tion, we support our troops. We are 
going to get to final passage, and then 
we are going to go to the House, and 
then we will send the bill to the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
I should note that one of the other 
reasons that many amendments were 
not brought up for debate is because 
they are not in the purview of the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee. 
There 
were foreign policy issues; there were 
sanctions issues, et cetera. The NDAA 
often serves as a vehicle to move those 
issues along, but it is not central to 
the purpose of the bill. 
Our nation faces an enormous range 
of security challenges, and it is more 
important than ever that we provide 
our military men and women with the 
support they need to keep Americans 
safe. To that end, this bill makes great 
progress. It addresses a broad range of 
pressing issues, from strategic com-
petition with China and Russia, to in-
vesting in game-changing technologies, 
to modernizing our ships, aircraft, and 
vehicles. It provides our servicemem-
bers with the resources and support 
they need to defend our Nation, while 
at the same taking care of their fami-
lies. 
That is why we are here on the floor 
with the national defense authoriza-
tion act. It is not only an opportunity, 
but a responsibility. Tonight, we dem-
onstrated irresponsibility to those who 
serve and their families. I regret it im-
mensely. 
Now, I look forward, again, to work-
ing with my colleague Senator INHOFE 
and all Members of the committee, to 
continue forward to develop legislation 
that will be acceptable to this body and 
pass, as we have for 60-some-odd years, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
I recognize and thank my colleague 
from Ohio for yielding to me. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I always 
laud and so appreciate the principled 
leadership of the senior Senator from 
Rhode Island, who never would have 
done what just happened on the floor 
when we were in the minority. JACK 
REED is always there for the troops and 
always there for our national security, 
and I join my colleagues in showing 
our appreciation. I know the Presiding 
Officer from New Mexico thinks the 
same thing. 
SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY 
Mr. President, this weekend, we cele-
brated Small Business Saturday for 
Ohioans. And people around the coun-
try showed their support for local busi-
nesses in their communities by shop-
ping local for holiday gifts. 
Small businesses and their workers 
drive this economy. There is always 
talk on this floor about small business, 
but the focus is rarely, in this body, ac-
tually on small business and their 
workers. They create jobs and eco-
nomic growth in our communities and 
the heartland, in small towns and over-
looked 
neighborhoods, 
places 
that 
often don’t get a lot of outside invest-
ment. 
The stakeholders in these businesses 
aren’t nameless, faceless shareholders. 
They are our neighbors, our family 
members, the people you see at church 
and at the grocery store, and they are 
vital to our economic recovery. It is 
why we passed the bipartisan Paycheck 
Protection Program last year. It is 
why Democrats and President Biden 
expanded the American Rescue Plan. 
Last week, I asked Ohioans on social 
media to tell us about their favorite 
local businesses to support this holiday 
shopping season—businesses that go 
above and beyond to help their commu-
nity. 
This was a little bit, Mr. President— 
and I have gone to the floor on this be-
fore, and you and I have talked about 
this—when I post on my website, 
‘‘What did the child tax credit mean to 
your family,’’ and the effusive out-
pouring and excitement from so many 
people saying this should be the role of 
government. This is what really mat-
ters. That is what we found when we 
posted asking people to share your sto-
ries about favorite local businesses. I 
want to share a few of them. 
Beth talked about Mootown Cream-
ery in Berea. She said they are ‘‘so in-
volved in the community, never say no 
when help is needed.’’ 
Robin gave a shout-out. 
And that is in northeast Ohio near 
Cleveland. 
Robin gave a shout-out to Snazzies’s 
in Oxford for local arts. That is in 
southwest Ohio, north of Cincinnati, 
the home of Miami University. 
I would add that Berea is the home of 
Baldwin Wallace College too. 
Sarah mentioned ‘‘Sunset Bistro in 
Bowling Green. They not only support 
their local community, they are de-
voted to honoring our veterans’’—an-
other community with a big State uni-
versity in northwest Ohio. 
Heather wrote about Let’s Eat Cake 
in Urbana. She said: ‘‘Owner Tina is al-
ways doing something for the down-
town business association and the 
greater community.’’ 
Donna said: ‘‘I can’t say enough 
about Scott, the owner of Salad KraZe. 
Scott goes above and beyond to make 
the city of Avon Lake’’—a city on Lake 
Erie, just east of Lorain—‘‘a great 
place to live and raise our children.’’ 
Loria said: ‘‘Pouka Art & Photog-
raphy 
in 
Grove 
City’’—in

Ohio—‘‘does amazing digital printings

tographs into digital paintings.’’ 
Tia said: ‘‘Gemini Gems & Creations 
in Lancaster’’—a small city southeast 
of Columbus—‘‘wonderful people who 
started selling out of their home and 
during town events’’—out of their 
home and during town events—‘‘and 
now finally have their own shop.’’ 
Teresa mentioned ‘‘Chris Fultz’s sign 
company, Fultz Signs and his pizza 
place, Bluelick General, in Lima.’’ 
Lima just swore in this week a new 
mayor, Sharetta Smith, and the mayor 
of Dayton, my friend Nan Whaley, at-
tended the swearing in. 
Adam mentioned the Copper Penny 
Salon in Pettisville. 
Vickie 
mentioned 
the 
Charmed 
Farmhouse in Wellington. She said: 
‘‘They take food drives and donate to 
those in town who directly help our 
community. They survived shutdown 
and thrive still.’’ 
Think about that: They survived and 
they thrive. This pandemic hit small 
businesses hard. For so many of them, 
they are still paying their workers and 
serving their communities because of 
PPP, because of our work through the 
American Rescue Plan to get people 
vaccinated. 
PPP has helped Ohio businesses sur-
vive. Vaccines are bringing back cus-
tomers, allowing these small busi-
nesses to thrive again. 
The bipartisan infrastructure plan 
the President signed just last month is 
going to mean investment—earlier this 
month. Excuse me. It is going to mean 
investment in these businesses’ local 
communities. 
People in Ohio and across the coun-
try remember how after the last eco-
nomic crisis in 2008 and 2009, the big-
gest corporations recovered—they al-
ways do—while large swaths of the 
country were left behind. 
Many of these same communities 
have watched for decades as factories 
closed, as investment dried up, as 
storefronts were boarded over. We can’t 
make that mistake again, and we are 
not making that mistake. 
We are investing in rebuilding roads 
and bridges and bus and rail systems to 
revitalize downtowns. We know busi-
nesses can’t survive on their own. They 
need safe streets and sidewalks. They 
need other businesses around. They 
need bus stops nearby. They need cus-
tomers with money in their pockets. 
As part of the American Rescue Plan, 
as I said earlier, we passed the largest 
tax cut for working families ever. 
Ninety-two percent of families in Ohio 
who have children under 18—92 percent 
of those families—will get at least a 
$3,000-a-year tax cut. 
It is essential that this Congress, 
that this Senate extend that tax cut 
for at least another year. It is giving 
millions of Ohio families that tax cut 
every single month—$250 or $300 per 
child every single month. We need to 
make sure they continue. 
We need this holiday season to com-
mit to shopping local, and in the Sen-
ate let’s commit to protecting small 
business—putting small businesses and 
workers at the center of our economy. 
The workers who shared these—the 
Ohioans who shared these stories— 
know the vibrancy and the dynamism 
and the diversity of working-class 
towns in neighborhoods that Senator 
PORTMAN, who is in the Chamber this 
evening—that we represent. We need to 
get to work to invest in them. We need 
to get to work to ensure that these 
places—Ohio’s Main Streets, America’s 
Main Streets—are at the center of a 
better economy.

MORNING BUSINESS 
HOSSAM BAHGAT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in 
June of this year, Egyptian prosecutors 
opened a criminal investigation con-
cerning human rights defender Hossam 
Bahgat, in relation to a December 2020 
tweet criticizing Egypt’s flawed par-
liamentary elections. The acts he has 
been accused of would not be consid-
ered crimes in the United States, nor 
in any other country that respects 
freedom of expression. 
Hossam Bahgat is the executive di-
rector and founder of one of the most 
respected Egyptian human rights orga-
nizations, the Egyptian Initiative for 
Personal Rights, EIPR. His work has 
been recognized around the world, and 
in April 2021, Mr. Bahgat met with Sec-
retary of State Blinken as part of a 
group of leading human rights activ-
ists. Other EIPR employees have also 
been targeted, along with many others 
as part of the government’s crackdown 
on independent civil society organiza-
tions. In February of 2020, EIPR re-
searcher Patrick George Zaki was forc-
ibly disappeared and reportedly tor-
tured. A year ago, three of EIPR’s sen-
ior employees, Gasser Abdel-Razek, 
Karim 
Ennarah, 
and 
Mohamed 
Basheer, were also arbitrarily detained, 
effectively silencing them. 
Mr. Bahgat faces up to 3 years in 
prison and almost $20,000 in fines for 
reportedly doing nothing more than ex-
pressing views the Egyptian authori-
ties consider to be ‘‘insulting’’ or 
‘‘false news’’. This is not the first time 
Mr. Bahgat has been targeted for his 
courageous and important reporting. In 
2015, he was detained for 3 days after 
reporting on officers convicted of plan-
ning a coup and was only released when 
the case received international atten-
tion from human rights groups and the 
United Nations. 
I have consistently spoken out about 
human rights in Egypt and in other 
countries, 
especially 
when 
govern-
ments crack down on human rights ac-
tivists. The State Department publicly 
expressed concern in July of this year. 
Today, I am adding my voice to others 
who have raised concerns about Mr. 
Bahgat’s wrongful detention. A verdict 
in his case may be imminent. I hope 
the Egyptian Government will abandon 
its persecution of Hossam Bahgat and 
his fellow human rights defenders. Like 
the Department of State, I have been 
urging the Egyptian authorities to 
make progress on human rights so our 
two countries can expand cooperation 
in other important areas. Further at-
tempts to silence Mr. Bahgat and the 
other EIPR employees will needlessly 
impede those efforts.

SWITZERLAND 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the unique partnership between the 
United States and Switzerland. I had 
the opportunity earlier this month to 
meet with President of Switzerland 
Guy Parmelin to discuss the U.S.-Swit-
zerland partnership on apprenticeship 
and workforce training. Our meeting 
came on the heels of a Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee hearing consid-
ering the nomination of Scott Miller to 
be the Ambassador to Switzerland. My 
questioning of Mr. Miller covered many 
topics, to include the recent decision 
by the government of Switzerland and 
Swiss voters to purchase Lockheed 
Martin F–35s as their next-generation 
fighter jet. 
In the following weeks, I have re-
ceived more information on the bene-
fits of the F–35 and the incredible op-
portunity this security cooperation 
provides for both Switzerland and the 
United States. In fact, prior to making 
a selection, the Swiss Federal Council 
completed a comprehensive analysis 
and determined that the F–35 offered 
the highest benefit, at the lowest cost: 
$2 billion less than the next lowest bid-
der. 
In making their choice, the Govern-
ment of Switzerland and Swiss voters 
clearly recognized the value of the F– 
35, as well as the superior capabilities 
the F–35 offers. The deal has my enthu-
siastic support, and I appreciate our 
continued partnership with the Swiss 
Government and the Swiss people.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARIE BEAVER 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a good friend of 
mine for the work she has done for 
women in recovery. Marie Beaver is re-
tiring after 18 years as the executive 
director of Rea of Hope, a very success-
ful recovery program and facility in 
my 
hometown 
of 
Charleston, 
WV, 
which she built from the ground up. 
Although Marie is not a native of 
West Virginia, she found her way to 
our State as a result of her marriage to 
her husband, Carl Beaver. Shortly after 
her arrival, Marie was hired and start-
ed working to create Rea of Hope just 
before the full scope of the addiction 
epidemic was recognized. 
Working with little money and a lot 
of help from volunteers, including the 
organization’s board of directors, and 
donated labor from a work release pro-
gram, Marie transformed a deterio-
rating home on the East End of 
Charleston into our State’s first recov-
ery home for women. 
Marie’s personal experience as a re-
covering addict shaped the foundation 
of Rea of Hope as an abstinence only, 
no tolerance recovery home. Residents 
are expected to find and hold a job, pay 
rent, attend 12-step meetings, and take 
responsibility for the mistakes of their 
past and pay their debts. Personal re-
sponsibility is a tenet of the program 
and Rea of Hope has a long list of suc-
cessful graduates who have completed 
their high school and college degrees, 
are employed in both the public sector 
and privately owned businesses, are be-
coming first-time homebuyers, and, 
most importantly, are being reunited 
with their children, providing safe, lov-
ing homes. 
The home’s success is how I met 
Marie. The White House Drug Czar 
under President George W. Bush, John 
P. Walters, visited Rea of Hope with 
me early in my congressional career. 
Marie was a gracious hostess, and the 
Drug Czar was very impressed with 
what he saw and experienced. A rose 
bush was brought from the White 
House on that visit, which was planted, 
and I believe is still in Rea of Hope’s 
front yard. 
As a next step, Marie realized that 
there were no affordable, safe apart-
ments to rent for graduates of the pro-
gram in the Charleston area. She began 
arranging financing and buying apart-
ment properties and renting them to 
the graduates. As a result, graduates 
are able to learn about renting and the 
associated costs, but do not have to 
worry about unruly neighbors or drugs 
or alcohol being on the premises. The 
apartments have created a sober com-
munity where women take care of one 
another and their children, as built-in 
baby sitters when mothers have to 
work or attend a 12-step meeting. This 
successful model of recovery has helped 
250 women from 44 West Virginia coun-
ties learn to live sober, responsible 
lives. The annual fundraiser named, 
‘‘Miracle on Lee Street’’ reflecting Rea 
of Hope’s address is a very fitting 
name. If success is measured by the dif-
ference you make, Rea of Hope’s suc-
cess is immeasurable. 
Marie and her husband Carl have de-
cided to retire and return to her home 
State of South Carolina to be near fam-
ily, the ocean, and her beloved Clemson 
Tigers. Marie made West Virginia her 
home over the nearly 20 years she lived 
here, cultivating friendships, whether 
professionally or personally through-
out the State. She put such a positive 
face on recovery and exemplified that 
long-term recovery is possible and so 
rewarding. 
Thank you, Marie, for the terrific 
work you have done and the example 
you and Rea of Hope have set as a 
model for recovery. Marie has estab-
lished a high standard, and I am sure 
Rea of Hope will maintain the quality 
of service that she performed. 
I wish Marie the best, and like all 
who know her, I will miss her. I am 
proud to call Marie friend and fellow 
West Virginian.∑

REMEMBERING JACE WARD 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
today I wish to recognize a fellow Kan-
san, Jace Ward, for his incredible fight 
against 
cancer, 
inspiring 
advocacy 
work, and unyielding display of hope in 
the face of a terminal illness. At the 
age of 22, Jace passed away surrounded 
by family and friends, and today, I 
commemorate the remarkable accom-
plishments during his short life. 
Jace was born on February 18, 1999, in 
Wichita, KS. He enjoyed a fantastic 
childhood in Inman and then moved to 
Wamego at age 12, where he excelled in 
school and extracurricular activities. 
After graduating from Wamego High 
School in 2017, Jace attended the Uni-
versity of Kansas, studying law and 
business with scholarships under the 
Law 
Education 
Accelerated 
Degree 
Program and the Business Scholars 
Program. 
Following a rollover car accident in 
February 2019, Jace started to experi-
ence eye problems. After an MRI, it 
was revealed that Jace had an aggres-
sive and particularly deadly form of 
brain cancer called diffuse intrinsic 
pontine plioma, DIPG. It generally af-
fects children between the ages of 5 to 
9 and has no chance of survival as no 
effective treatment exists. In fact, only 
10 percent of patients survive 2 years 
after their diagnosis, and less than 1 
percent survive past 5 years. Despite 
these unforgiving odds, Jace decided to 
make the most of the time he had left. 
After being diagnosed with DIPG, 
Jace transferred to Kansas State Uni-
versity—KSU—on scholarship and ma-
jored in business entrepreneurship. He 
was awarded a bachelor of business ad-
ministration 
degree 
posthumously 
from KSU, but while he was studying, 
he 
also 
championed 
advocacy 
and 
awareness for pediatric cancer. 
While attending KSU, Jace worked 
vigorously for California-based Emer-
son Collective as a member of the 
Health Team, which focuses on advo-
cating and investing funds to combat 
rare cancers like his. As a member of 
this organization, he visited with Fed-
eral officials in Congress and various 
agencies at the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services to raise 
awareness. Notably, Jace delivered a 
keynote address at a congressional 
briefing on DIPG, spoke to the NIH on 
patient ownership of genomic data, and 
met with over 67 congressional offices, 
including mine. As a Member of the 
House of Representatives and his Con-
gressman, I cosponsored a House reso-
lution expressing support for honoring 
a day towards DIPG to raise awareness 
and encourage research into cures for 
DIPG and other pediatric cancers. 
As a business major keenly aware of 
private sector dynamics and pharma-
ceutical 
manufacturing, 
Jace 
also 
helped establish partnerships with bio-
pharmaceutical innovators and founda-
tions. He regularly brought together 
foundations to partner with him on as-
pirations he had to fill gaps in research 
and patient navigation. Jace concep-
tualized a DIPG Patient Navigation 
System to direct patients to molecular 
diagnostics and clinical trials, at-
tracted the support of 20 top doctors 
and several foundations to open this 
novel system in November. Because of 
Jace, over 300 tumors previously held 
in 
storage 
awaiting 
funding 
for 
genomic sequencing are now being 
sequenced added to quadruple those 
available for researchers. Jace inspired 
an astonishing $5 million in funding for 
pediatric brain cancer research and 
treatment, and it is because of him 
that over 200 patients received ex-
panded access to an investigational 
drug. 
When asked about what he wanted to 
do with the remaining time he had left 
and whether he would devote it to-
wards travel or other personal experi-
ences, Jace responded, ‘‘I can’t die, I’m 
busy.’’ Jace ignored the ticking clock 
tethered to him to become a thun-
dering voice for future patients, always 
putting the need to advance science 
and protect younger kids and their leg-
acies before his own. 
As a physician for nearly 30 years, I 
am no stranger to cancer or the mir-
acle of hope when faced with the heart-
breaking news of a diagnosis. Even dur-
ing the toughest of times, I have wit-
nessed God in my patient’s grace and 
acceptance; Jace is no exception. I am 
profoundly honored to have had the op-
portunity to get to know him and his 
remarkable family. Jace is survived by 
his loving parents, Roger and Lisa, and 
his sister, Brooke. 
I ask my colleagues and all Kansans 
to join me in remembering Jace’s cou-
rageous fight, his ability to rise to the 
challenge, and to make a lasting im-
pact in the fight against pediatric can-
cer.∑

TRIBUTE TO LACY BOWER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
today I wish to recognize Lacy Bower 
of Hutchinson, KS, for her incredible 
achievement in attaining not only Girl 
Scouts’s highest honor in the Gold 
Award, but Boy Scouts’s Eagle Scout 
rank as well. Both are remarkable 
achievements on their own, but attain-
ing both is truly a remarkable feat. 
For her Gold Award, Lacy decided to 
focus her efforts to helping the Hutch-
inson domestic violence center with 
her project, ‘‘A Walk of Love.’’ To help 
the shelter, Lacy worked with the com-
munity to collect over $5,000 worth of 
toiletry items, which she then turned 
into 200 toiletry bags to donate to the 
shelter. In addition, she helped estab-
lish a continual collection process for 
these items so the shelter can more 
adequately provide resources for those 
that use it in the future. 
Of course, that is only half the story. 
To accomplish the double feat, Lacy 
needed to create yet another commu-
nity project for her Eagle Scout rank. 
Lacy set her sights on repainting the 
gymnasium of a church in Hutchinson. 
After plenty of preparation and re-
cruiting, what she initially thought 
would take 2 weeks only took her 2 
days after successfully recruiting help 
throughout the Hutchinson area during 
her preparation process. 
After achieving these two feats, Lacy 
has said that she hopes to be an inspi-
ration for young girls to show that 
they are capable of making a difference 
and achieving what they want, so long 
as they put their mind to it. She has 
certainly set a tremendous example for 
young women everywhere, and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing 
Lacy 
for 
her 
outstanding 
achievements.∑

RECOGNIZING IMOGENE’S 
ALTERATIONS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Imogene’s Alter-
ations of Bowling Green, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Located 
on 
Nutwood 
Street, 
Imogene’s Alterations has served Bowl-
ing Green, KY, for over 20 years. Imo-
gene Garmon, a longtime Bowling 
Green resident, embarked on her first 
career in the grocery sector. After 33 
years working at the Kroger meat 
counter, she was ready for a new chal-
lenge. A self-taught seamstress, Imo-
gene began selling fabric and doing 
minor alterations after leaving Kroger. 
Seeing a business opportunity, Imo-
gene went on to establish a fabric shop. 
She thrived as a small business owner, 
serving the greater Bowling Green 
community. Word spread quickly of 
Imogene’s talent as a seamstress. Re-
quest for alterations poured in, includ-
ing everything from everyday clothing 
to suits and ball gowns. To meet the 
demand, Imogene decided to focus sole-
ly 
on 
alterations. 
She 
established 
Imogene’s Alterations, providing full- 
time alterations for men and women’s 
clothing. 
Today, Imogene’s Alterations con-
tinues providing alterations for all 
types of events and special occasions. 
This woman-owned business has grown 
along with the area, moving into its 
current location at Nutwood Street 
about 20 years ago. Customers are wel-
comed by name and treated like fam-
ily. At 88 years old, Imogene continues 
to be involved in every aspect of her 
business. From operating the store to 
sewing alterations, her care and atten-
tion to detail are evident in her work. 
Her strong sense of family has built a 
tight-knit, supportive team. 
Like many entrepreneurs, Imogene 
established a successful business while 
building community. As a mother, 
grandmother, and aunt, Imogene raised 
and continues to mentor generations of 
her 
family. 
Remarkably, 
Imogene 
founded Imogene’s Alterations in her 
60s. It took innovation and courage to 
pursue her goal, switching from the 
grocery industry which she knew well, 
to the tailoring sector. 
Imogene’s Alterations is a remark-
able example of the resilience and 
adaptability of locally owned small 
businesses. 
Small 
businesses 
like 
Imogene’s Alterations form the heart 
of cities and towns across Kentucky. 
Congratulations to Imogene and the 
entire team at Imogene’s Alterations. I 
wish them the best of luck, and I look 
forward to watching their continued 
growth and success in Kentucky.∑

By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 3273. A bill to take certain land in 
the State of California into trust for 
the benefit of the Agua Caliente Band 
of Cahuilla Indians, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Agua Caliente Land 
Exchange Fee to Trust Confirmation 
Act. 
This legislation would place certain 
lands into trust for the Tribe in order 
to finally allow the Agua Caliente 
Band of Mission Indians to manage 
these lands that are of special, cultural 
value to their people . 
Land that has traditionally been held 
by Agua Caliente has been divided into 
a checkerboard between the Tribe, Fed-
eral Government, and private land-
owners. 
In 1999, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment and Agua Caliente entered into 
an agreement to acquire and exchange 
lands within what would become the 
Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains 
National Monument. In 2000, legisla-
tion was enacted to establish the 
monument and authorize the land ex-
change. 
For 17 years, Agua Caliente worked 
with the Bureau of Land Management 
to finalize an agreement to exchange 
the lands that are addressed by this 
legislation, and in March 2019, the land 
exchange was finalized. However, since 
the original legislation didn’t expressly 
address the status of land transferred 
to the Tribe, the lands covered in this 
bill were not placed in trust. My legis-
lation would correct that and provide 
the fix to finally place the exchanged 
land into trust and made part of Agua 
Caliente’s reservation. 
This bill represents the final step to 
complete the original 1999 agreement 
between Agua Caliente and the Bureau 
of Land Management. 
Importantly, enactment of this legis-
lation would allow for improved land 
management and allow Agua Caliente 
to manage these lands that have a 
longstanding cultural and natural re-
source value to the Cahuilla people. 
The land is in a remote wilderness 
area within the Santa Rosa and San 
Jacinto Mountains National Monu-
ment, and the Tribe will manage the 
land as conservation lands similar to 
how it is managed by the Bureau of 
Land Management. 
I thank Congressman RUIZ for his 
partnership on this effort and for his 
commitment to honoring the Federal 
Government’s trust responsibility. I 
also thank the bipartisan Members of 
the House who have supported this leg-
islation and Senator FEINSTEIN for co-
leading this effort with me in the Sen-
ate. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the Agua Caliente 
Land Exchange Fee to Trust Confirma-
tion Act as quickly as possible.

military activities of the Department

At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Iran Sanctions 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Masih 
Alinejad Harassment and Unlawful Tar-
geting Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘Masih Alinejad 
HUNT Act’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran surveils, harasses, 
terrorizes, tortures, abducts, and murders in-
dividuals 
who 
peacefully 
defend 
human 
rights and freedoms in Iran, and innocent en-
tities and individuals considered by the Gov-
ernment of Iran to be enemies of that re-
gime, including United States citizens on 
United States soil, and takes foreign nation-
als hostage, including in the following in-
stances: 
(1) In 2021, Iranian intelligence agents were 
indicted for plotting to kidnap United States 
citizen, women’s rights activist, and jour-
nalist Masih Alinejad, from her home in New 
York City, in retaliation for exercising her 
rights under the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. Iranian 
agents allegedly spent at least approxi-
mately half a million dollars to capture the 
outspoken critic of the authoritarianism of 
the Government of Iran, and studied evacu-
ating her by military-style speedboats to 
Venezuela before rendition to Iran. 
(2) Prior to the New York kidnapping plot, 
Ms. Alinejad’s family in Iran was instructed 
by authorities to lure Ms. Alinejad to Tur-
key. In an attempt to intimidate her into si-
lence, the Government of Iran arrested 3 of 
Ms. Alinejad’s family members in 2019, and 
sentenced her brother to 8 years in prison for 
refusing to denounce her. 
(3) According to Federal prosecutors, the 
same Iranian intelligence network that al-
legedly plotted to kidnap Ms. Alinejad is 
also targeting critics of the Government of 
Iran who live in Canada, the United King-
dom, and the United Arab Emirates. 
(4) In 2021, an Iranian diplomat was con-
victed in Belgium of attempting to carry out 
a 2018 bombing of a dissident rally in France. 
(5) In 2021, a Danish high court found a 
Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent guilty 
of illegal espionage and complicity in a 
failed plot to kill an Iranian Arab dissident 
figure in Denmark. 
(6) In 2021, the British Broadcasting Cor-
poration (BBC) appealed to the United Na-
tions to protect BBC Persian employees in 
London who suffer regular harassment and 
threats of kidnapping by Iranian government 
agents. 
(7) In 2021, 15 militants allegedly working 
on behalf of the Government of Iran were ar-
rested in Ethiopia for plotting to attack citi-
zens of Israel, the United States, and the 
United Arab Emirates, according to United 
States officials. 
(8) In 2020, Iranian agents allegedly kid-
napped United States resident and Iranian- 
German journalist Jamshid Sharmahd, while 
he was traveling to India through Dubai. Ira-
nian authorities announced they had seized 
Mr. Sharmahd in ‘‘a complex operation’’, and 
paraded him blindfolded on state television. 
Mr. Sharmahd is arbitrarily detained in Iran, 
allegedly facing the death penalty. In 2009, 
Mr. Sharmahd was the target of an alleged 
Iran-directed assassination plot in Glendora, 
California. 
(9) In 2020, the Government of Turkey re-
leased counterterrorism files exposing how 
Iranian authorities allegedly collaborated 
with drug gangs to kidnap Habib Chabi, an 
Iranian-Swedish activist for Iran’s Arab mi-
nority. In 2020, the Government of Iran alleg-
edly lured Mr. Chabi to Istanbul through a 
female agent posing as a potential lover. Mr. 
Chabi was then allegedly kidnapped from

(10) In 2020, a United States-Iranian citizen 
and an Iranian resident of California pleaded 
guilty to charges of acting as illegal agents 
of the Government of Iran by surveilling 
Jewish 
student 
facilities, 
including 
the 
Hillel Center and Rohr Chabad Center at the 
University 
of 
Chicago, 
in 
addition 
to 
surveilling and collecting identifying infor-
mation about United States citizens and na-
tionals who are critical of the Iranian re-
gime. 
(11) In 2019, 2 Iranian intelligence officers 
at the Iranian consulate in Turkey allegedly 
orchestrated the assassination of Iranian dis-
sident journalist Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, 
who was shot while walking with a friend in 
Istanbul. Unbeknownst to Mr. Molavi, his 
‘‘friend’’ was in fact an undercover Iranian 
agent and the leader of the killing squad, ac-
cording to a Turkish police report. 
(12) In 2019, around 1,500 people were alleg-
edly killed amid a less than 2 week crack-
down by security forces on anti-government 
protests across Iran, including at least an al-
leged 23 children and 400 women. 
(13) In 2019, Iranian operatives allegedly 
lured 
Paris-based 
Iranian 
journalist 
Ruhollah Zam to Iraq, where he was ab-
ducted, and hanged in Iran for sedition. 
(14) In 2019, a Kurdistan regional court con-
victed an Iranian female for trying to lure 
Voice of America reporter Ali Javanmardi to 
a hotel room in Irbil, as part of a foiled Ira-
nian intelligence plot to kidnap and extra-
dite Mr. Javanmardi, a critic of the Govern-
ment of Iran. 
(15) In 2019, Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion agents visited the rural Connecticut 
home of Iran-born United States author and 
poet Roya Hakakian to warn her that she 
was the target of an assassination plot or-
chestrated by the Government of Iran. 
(16) In 2019, the Government of Denmark 
accused the Government of Iran of directing 
the assassination of Iranian Arab activist 
Ahmad Mola Nissi, in The Hague, and the as-
sassination of another opposition figure, 
Reza Kolahi Samadi, who was murdered near 
Amsterdam in 2015. 
(17) 
In 
2018, 
German 
security 
forces 
searched for 10 alleged spies who were work-
ing for Iran’s al-Quds Force to collect infor-
mation on targets related to the local Jewish 
community, including kindergartens. 
(18) In 2017, Germany convicted a Pakistani 
man for working as an Iranian agent to spy 
on targets including a former German law-
maker and a French-Israeli economics pro-
fessor. 
(19) In 2012, an Iranian American pleaded 
guilty to conspiring with members of the 
Iranian military to bomb a popular Wash-
ington, D.C., restaurant with the aim of as-
sassinating the ambassador of Saudi Arabia 
to the United States. 
(20) In 1996, agents of the Government of 
Iran allegedly assassinated 5 Iranian dis-
sident exiles across Turkey, Pakistan, and 
Baghdad, over a 5-month period that year. 
(21) In 1992, the Foreign and Common-
wealth Office of the United Kingdom ex-
pelled 2 Iranians employed at the Iranian 
Embassy in London and a third Iranian on a 
student visa amid allegations they were plot-
ting to kill Indian-born British American 
novelist Salman Rushdie, pursuant to the 
fatwa issued by then supreme leader of Iran, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
(22) In 1992, 4 Iranian Kurdish dissidents 
were assassinated at a restaurant in Berlin, 
Germany, allegedly by Iranian agents. 
(23) In 1992, singer, actor, poet, and gay Ira-
nian dissident Fereydoun Farrokhzad was 
found dead with multiple stab wounds in his 
apartment in Germany. His death is alleg-
edly the work of Iran-directed agents. 
(24) In 1980, Ali Akbar Tabatabaei, a lead-
ing critic of Iran and then president of the 
Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered in 
front of his Bethesda, Maryland, home by an 
assassin disguised as a postal courier. The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation had identi-
fied the ‘‘mailman’’ as Dawud Salahuddin, 
born 
David 
Theodore 
Belfield. 
Mr. 
Salahuddin was working as a security guard 
at an Iranian interest office in Washington, 
D.C., when he claims he accepted the assign-
ment and payment of $5,000 from the Govern-
ment of Iran to kill Mr. Tabatabaei. 
(25) Other exiled Iranian dissidents alleged 
to have been victims of the Government of 
Iran’s murderous extraterritorial campaign 
include Shahriar Shafiq, Shapour Bakhtiar, 
and Gholam Ali Oveissi. 
(26) Iranian Americans face an ongoing 
campaign of intimidation both in the virtual 
and physical world by agents and affiliates of 
the Government of Iran, which aims to stifle 
freedom of expression and eliminate the 
threat Iranian authorities believe democ-
racy, justice, and gender equality pose to 
their rule.

f 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Ohio, and I 
am on the floor today to talk about a 
major public health crisis facing our 
country, one that is resulting in thou-
sands of people losing their lives, caus-
ing the death of over 100,000 Americans 
a year, and has negatively impacted so 
many millions more in my home State 
of Ohio and all around the country. 
And, no, I am not talking about 
COVID–19. I am talking about an epi-
demic within the pandemic. I am talk-
ing about the surging epidemic of drug 
use and addiction that has fueled a 
record number of overdose deaths and 
threatens to get even worse. 
In the past 19 months or so, our at-
tention has, understandably, been di-
rected toward the COVID–19 crisis. 
And, once again, we see with Omicron 
the possibility of another variant com-
ing, and those public health challenges 
are real. 
But I have to tell you that it has led 
us to ignore another crisis. The Centers 
for Disease Control, the CDC, recently 
issued a report which was shocking and 
should serve as a wake-up call to all of 
us. 
It said that between April of 2020 and 
April of 2021, the most recent year for 
which we have data, we had over 100,000 
individuals lose their lives to drug 
overdose deaths in this country. That 
is the highest ever. It is a record. 
By the way, 100,000 deaths per year is 
more than the deaths from gunshot 
wounds and the deaths from car acci-
dents combined. It is truly the epi-
demic within the pandemic. 
Away from the headlines, we have 
this other tragic healthcare crisis that 
has left no part of the country unaf-
fected. Forty-six States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia have seen their over-
dose rates go up in the last year, with 
a 26-percent increase in my home State 
of Ohio. In some States, there are now 
as many drug overdose deaths as there 
are COVID deaths. 
Like many of you, I have seen first-
hand the damage drugs like crystal 
meth or cocaine or heroin or now the 
synthetic opioids are causing to the 
families we represent, to people who 
have gotten caught in that spiral of 
drug abuse and addiction. 
I have also seen the heroic efforts of 
first responders who have saved peo-
ple’s lives by administering naloxone, 
which some call Narcan, its brand 
name. It is a miracle drug that lit-
erally saves lives by being able to re-
verse the effects of an overdose. 
And I have ridden with law enforce-
ment and treatment providers on rapid 
response teams in various places in 
Ohio that follow up with those who 
have overdosed. Literally, somebody 
overdoses, and then this rapid response 
team—usually made up of law enforce-
ment but also treatment providers, so-
cial workers—goes to people’s homes, 
and it is amazing what you will find 
out. 
I was, frankly, a little surprised dur-
ing my first visit—then, I got more 
used to it—which is that people re-
spond very favorably. Most people who 
are approached by these rapid response 
teams agree to get into treatment. And 
isn’t that the key? Using Narcan again 
and again and again to save someone’s 
life is not the answer. The answer is to 
get that person into treatment so that 
that person can get back to his or her 
family, his or her work, and to a nor-
mal life and to be more productive in 
life. 
I have also met with families and 
loved ones affected, hearing their sto-
ries about how losing a family member 
to addiction has had such a negative 
impact, often tearing those families 
apart. 
And, of course, I have talked to a lot 
of people in recovery who have told me 
about the grip of addiction on their 
lives and how they got help and what 
worked and what didn’t work. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people get 
help, get into treatment, and it doesn’t 
work for them. They have to do it 
again and again. But, ultimately, for 
those who can stay in recovery and are 
able to stay sober and clean, they have 
the most amazing stories. And so many 
of them are coming back and contrib-
uting in big ways to our communities— 
many helping others. Their recovery, 
basically, is reaching out to others and 
helping them along the way. Some are 
called recovery coaches, which is a 
more formal title, but so many of them 
are, in effect, recovery coaches helping 
others who are struggling. 
There are so many lives that have 
been touched by this crisis—100,000- 
plus deaths, but so many others af-
fected. And I have made it a goal of 
mine to make sure Congress is playing 
its role in addressing this effort that 
must be at the community level, at the 
State level, but also at the national 
level to respond to what is a true na-
tional crisis. 
What makes it especially heart-
breaking to me is that, only a few 
years ago, we had finally begun to 
make progress on this. We were begin-
ning to turn the corner. We were seeing 
lower addiction rates. We were seeing 
lower overdose deaths for the first time 
in decades. 
How did we do it? Well, we redoubled 
our efforts on prevention, on getting 
people into treatment, on getting peo-
ple into longer term recovery, making 
more naloxone available. 
Thanks to the bipartisan leadership 
here in Congress, the Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, 
which I coauthored with my colleague 
SHELDON
WHITEHOUSE, and the 21st 
Century CURES Act were both signed 
into law in 2016, helping to pave the 
way for several billion dollars in new 
Federal funding to strengthen State, 
local, and nonprofit efforts to combat 
addiction. 
Our CARA legislation and the follow- 
up CARA.2 legislation that we passed a 
few years ago took a comprehensive ap-
proach based on best practices. We ac-
tually had seminars here in Wash-
ington. We brought people from all 
over the country here. We had four dif-
ferent conferences where we got infor-
mation as to what was working and not 
working 
in 
our 
communities, 
and 
things that were working we funded. 
We directed resources toward more 
treatment and recovery services for in-
dividuals and more focus on preven-
tion. 
I can’t overstate how critical these 
kinds of proven services are for people 
on the path to recovery. Congress had 
never, before this legislation, ever 
funded recovery services. 
I have visited a number of inpatient 
and outpatient centers for addiction in 
Ohio to talk with those working to 
overcome their addiction. They have 
told me time and again how these re-
covery services gave them the struc-
ture, the support, and, most impor-
tantly, the hope they needed to be able 
to overcome this disease. 
And we actually started to see that 
hope translate into real success on the 
ground, real numbers and real people’s 
lives. 
In 2017, Ohio’s overdose death rate 
had 
increased 
for 
30-plus 
straight 
years, and Ohio’s death per capita that 
year, 2017, was almost three times that 
of the national average. 
But that next year, in 2018, as these 
two signature laws, CARA and CURES, 
were fully implemented, Ohio began to 
turn the tide with a 22-percent reduc-
tion in overdose deaths in 1 year. 
Again, after more than 30 years of in-
creases in overdose deaths every single 
year, a 22-percent decrease. Nationally, 
overdose deaths declined that year 
about 4 percent, again, after a year 
after year of increases. In 2019, we had 
a slight decrease also. These were 
promising developments. 
But since then, there has been a le-
thal convergence on both the supply 
side of this issue and the demand side 
of this issue. Sam Quinones, the author 
of ‘‘Dreamland,’’ which I think is the 
seminal book on the rise of opioids in 
this country, recently put it well. He 
said in an interview that before COVID 
hit, Mexican cartels had achieved their 
goal, finally, of covering our country 
with ‘‘the most . . . mind-mangling 
drugs we’ve ever seen. . . . It just so 
happened that we went into isolation 
at the very moment when these drugs 
hit their apex.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8800 
November 29, 2021 
A terrible coincidence that as the 
supply increased because of the greed 
of traffickers, the demand increased 
because of COVID. These two things 
came together, and that has caused 
this huge increase in overdoses, addic-
tion, and overdose deaths. 
Let’s look at the supply side of this 
crisis first. The record number of dead-
ly narcotics and other drugs that are 
taking the lives of moms, dads, chil-
dren, and loved ones all across the 
country are coming into our country in 
record numbers. As many are aware, 
for much of the past few decades, the 
most common cause of overdose deaths 
were 
prescription 
opioids 
like 
OxyContin or Percocet. Often people 
who suffered a serious injury or acci-
dent needed pain relief, and often, un-
fortunately, doctors and dentists over-
prescribed opioids. People developed an 
addiction 
that 
led 
to 
accidental 
overdoses, often from cheaper and more 
available heroin when the prescription 
drugs ran out. 
Now we are dealing with a class of 
drugs that are tens if not hundreds of 
times deadlier than those prescription 
drugs, the so-called synthetic opioids. 
The most well known of these is 
fentanyl, which, as you can see by this 
chart of drug overdoses, has become 
the drug most responsible for overdose 
deaths. 
The red here is overdose deaths over-
all, and the blue is overdose deaths 
that are attributed to fentanyl. You 
can see what has happened. Fentanyl 
was about half of overdose deaths in 
2018. Half of all overdose deaths was 
one drug, fentanyl. In 2019, it was more 
than half and, in 2020, way more than 
half of all the overdose deaths caused 
by one drug, a synthetic opioid called 
fentanyl. It is the deadliest one. 
Incredibly, 
80 
percent 
of 
drug 
overdoses in Ohio and overdose deaths 
in Ohio can now be attributed to this 
deadly substance, based on what the 
experts tell me—80 percent. It is not 
surprising that the amount of fentanyl 
seized on the streets of Ohio cities like 
Dayton, OH, recently has nearly dou-
bled compared to last year. And it is 
not only the amount of fentanyl that is 
flooding our country. 
Evil traffickers have increasingly 
disguised it by mixing it with other 
drugs or pressing it into fake pills to 
look like common pharmaceuticals. 
This concerted effort to expand the 
reach of fentanyl addiction started be-
fore the pandemic, but it is only accel-
erating. 
It is a profitable business for drug 
dealers. Compared to heroin, fentanyl 
is less expensive to manufacture and, 
pound-for-pound, far more potent. A 
few flakes can kill you. Traffickers 
make a bigger profit, and people are 
trapped into addiction more easily. 
Traffickers 
increasingly 
lace 
fentanyl with other drugs—cocaine, 
crystal meth, heroin, and even mari-
juana in some cases. They do it as a 
way to boost its effects and cut down 
on its costs. In Mexico, they use cheap 
pill presses to mold fentanyl doses into 
the shape of prescription drugs—every-
day pills that people take for a variety 
of reasons. What that means is that 
many of the individuals who now lose 
their lives to a fentanyl overdose don’t 
even know they are taking fentanyl 
until it is too late. 
Recently, I participated in a round-
table discussion on the border crisis 
and how it has impacted the addiction 
crisis. We heard from an Ohio mother, 
Virginia Krieger, who lost her daughter 
Tiffany 
to 
an 
accidental 
fentanyl 
death. Virginia told us about how Tif-
fany had been unable to get the care 
she wanted from her physician. That 
led her to buying pills on the street— 
pills she was told were Percocet, and it 
looked like Percocet. That is what was 
stamped on it. But in reality, it was 
laced with lethal doses of heroin and 
fentanyl. When Tiffany took these pills 
for her pain, she was poisoned by the 
fentanyl, and the life of a young 26- 
year-old woman was snuffed out far too 
soon. 
We are hearing this across the State. 
Recently, in Cleveland, OH, Xanax 
pills, an antianxiety medication—fake 
pills pressed by Mexican traffickers 
contained 
fentanyl 
and 
caused 
overdoses and overdose deaths. 
My heart goes out to these families. 
My heart goes out to Virginia, who, by 
the way, has channeled her grief into 
something positive, and that is going 
to schools and explaining to young peo-
ple how dangerous this is. Her view is 
that no one should ever take a pill un-
less they know it comes from a phar-
macy. 
She is right. People across the coun-
try need to know that pills of all 
shapes and sizes can contain fentanyl 
even though they might say something 
else. No street drug is safe right now 
from the threat of fentanyl poisoning, 
and too many kids and adults who 
weren’t addicted to opioids are un-
knowingly ingesting these substances 
and putting themselves at risk. We 
need to be on high alert. Parents and 
kids need to know that right now no 
drug you get on the street can be safe. 
Our communities are saturated with 
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids 
right now. Among other things, of 
course, this drives the price of the 
drugs down. So, yes, the most impor-
tant thing is to reduce the demand for 
drugs, but with its overwhelming sup-
ply, the price of the drug goes down 
and there is higher use and higher de-
mand. 
A conversation about how we can cut 
down on the supply side of course has 
to start with our strategy on our 
southern border. For years, fentanyl 
and other synthetic opioids were over-
whelmingly illegally manufactured in 
China. As then-chairman of the Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations, 
I led a bipartisan investigation back in 
2017 which showed that fentanyl was 
coming into our country from China 
primarily through our own lax Postal 
Service. Our own Postal Service was 
the conduit. That is why I worked in a 
bipartisan manner to write and pass 
what is called the STOP Act, which re-
quired the Postal Service, for the first 
time, to crack down on fentanyl 
through the mail. 
We required the Postal Service to get 
advanced 
tracking 
data 
on 
inter-
national shipments coming to the 
United States, showing the package’s 
origin, contents, and destination. This 
allowed law enforcement to spot poten-
tially dangerous packages ahead of 
time and make it much more difficult 
to move fentanyl into the United 
States in this manner. Other carriers 
were already doing it—FedEx, private 
carriers, DHL, but the post office was 
not. 
The good news is that the STOP Act 
has been effective, and also, after per-
sistent engagement and pressure from 
the United States, China scheduled 
fentanyl, meaning made it illegal, and 
its analogues as a class of illegal drugs. 
We believe these changes have helped 
to dramatically reduce the flow of 
fentanyl directly from China into the 
United States. 
But, obviously, it hasn’t solved the 
problem 
because 
Mexican 
transnational criminal organizations 
know a great business opportunity 
when they see one, and they moved in 
to take over the fentanyl market in 
the 
United 
States. 
Now 
Mexican 
transnational criminal organizations 
work with criminal gangs in China to 
import into Mexico the ingredients 
used to make fentanyl, where the final 
product is made in so-called superlabs. 
We have a record amount of the sub-
stance pouring in, both at our ports of 
entry and through other gaps in our 
southern border security by car, by 
truck, by courier. This is a problem 
that continues to get worse as this 
shocking chart shows us. 
Look at the dramatic increases in 
fentanyl that was seized along the U.S. 
border. This past fiscal year, Customs 
and Border Protection seized 11,201 
pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill 
every man, woman, and child in Amer-
ica—more than double the amount 
from the previous year and four times 
the amount from fiscal year 2019. Just 
a few weeks ago in Southern Cali-
fornia, border officials discovered 81⁄2 
tons of meth in a single truck along 
with 400 pounds of fentanyl. Remem-
ber, it only takes a few flakes of 
fentanyl to kill you. This 400 pounds 
could kill millions. 
Their smuggling operations are com-
plex and sophisticated, and Customs 
and Border Protection have their hands 
full. According to the most recent sta-
tistics, last month, seizures of fentanyl 
increased 42 percent. That is 42 percent 
in 1 month. This is only how much we 
know was discovered, was apprehended. 
We don’t know how much more made it 
over the border undetected. 
When I have asked Customs and Bor-
der Protection and DHS, our homeland 
security officials, in public hearings, as 
I did the week before last, they don’t

answer the question because they don’t 
know. But in private conversations 
with Border Patrol agents, they tell me 
that they believe the vast majority of 
drugs are coming in undetected. So 
this is just the seizures, not the 
amount of drugs that are streaming 
across the border. 
I take no pleasure in saying this, but 
the failure of the Biden administration 
to control the southern border has re-
sulted 
in 
record 
levels 
of 
deadly 
fentanyl coming in to our country and 
contributes to the growing strength of 
the Mexican transnational criminal or-
ganizations. Part of the problem is 
that the Biden administration’s own 
policies have encouraged an unprece-
dented surge of unlawful migrants at 
the border, diverting our Customs and 
Border Protection officers and Border 
Patrol agents away from interdicting 
drugs. I have seen that on the southern 
border as has anyone else who has vis-
ited. 
These law enforcement officers who 
should be on the line stopping the 
criminals carrying drugs are instead 
processing a record number of mi-
grants. This massive influx of unlawful 
migrants began when President Biden 
was inaugurated and made specific pol-
icy changes, and it has only continued 
to worsen ever since. We had all hoped 
that during the summer months, when 
normally unlawful migration slows 
down because of the heat, that we 
would have a lessening of this issue, 
but it didn’t happen. In fact, last 
month was a record month for October 
for Border Patrol apprehensions. 
As the border crisis created by the 
Biden administration policy changes 
continues, 
the 
administration 
has 
failed to give Customs and Border Pro-
tection the resources they need: addi-
tional personnel, better technology, in-
frastructure, and more, to enable them 
to better protect our Nation along the 
nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. 
On an average day in 2020, Customs and 
Border Protection processed 650,000- 
plus passengers and pedestrians, 187,000 
incoming privately owned vehicles, and 
77,900 truck, rail, and sea containers. 
The amount of traffic at the border is 
going up now that there is less concern 
about the pandemic. 
However, only 2 percent of those pri-
vately owned vehicles are physically 
searched at the border, and less than 20 
percent of all those commercial vehi-
cles are scanned for drugs before they 
cross into the United States. 
Let me repeat that: 2 percent. So if 
you are a smuggler driving a sedan 
with multiple pounds of fentanyl con-
cealed in hidden compartments, right 
now you have a very good chance of 
getting across the border without a 
search. That is not a gap in our secu-
rity, that is a gaping hole. 
We have known this is a problem. 
Congress, last January, almost a year 
ago, 
passed 
and 
President 
Trump 
signed into law a requirement that the 
Department of Homeland Security give 
Congress a plan and a strategy on using 
technology and making policy and re-
sources changes to be able to scan all 
vehicles. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion is late delivering this report. It 
was due over 4 months ago, and we still 
don’t have it. In conversations with ad-
ministration officials the week before 
last, I got assurances that it is coming 
soon. I hope so. We need it. It would be 
extremely helpful to have this informa-
tion as we finalize the spending bills 
over the next month or so. 
I am proud that the recently enacted 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act invested billions of dollars in up-
grading and modernizing our ports of 
entry, including ports of entry on the 
southern border. Our ports are aging, 
some of them badly. This funding 
would allow Customs and Border Pro-
tection officers to have adequate space 
to do more screening of vehicles. 
However, we cannot and should not 
build a brandnew port of entry and 
then just install the old legacy tech-
nology for scanning and detection of 
deadly narcotics. We have a once-in-a- 
generation opportunity to dramati-
cally upgrade seaports of entry with 
modern, 
state-of-the-art 
detection 
technology that can help our officers 
catch more of these drugs before they 
enter our communities. 
In May, I introduced bipartisan legis-
lation with Senator MARK KELLY of Ar-
izona to establish a $1 billion irregular 
migration border response fund so that 
the Department of Homeland Security 
is not forced to transfer resources away 
from drug interdiction priorities to 
fund processing of individuals, food, 
clothing, blankets, and transportation 
when there is an influx of migrants, as 
has happened periodically. These con-
tingency resources would be available 
immediately when there is a surge to 
quickly respond to increased migration 
at the border. 
Considering the crisis at our border 
and the record amounts of fentanyl 
coming in, it was not surprising to me 
in September when the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency, DEA, issued its first pub-
lic safety alert in more than 6 years 
after it seized more than 9.5 million 
fake pills this year, more than the last 
2 years combined. As I said, we all need 
to be on high alert. 
We hear a lot these days about prob-
lems with the supply chain, with de-
layed shipments and cancelled orders. I 
will tell you the Mexican transnational 
criminal organizations don’t have that 
problem. 
They 
are 
moving 
more 
fentanyl than ever into our commu-
nities, and once that fentanyl is here, 
what a waste. Sadly, more people are 
caught in the grip of addiction. 
This brings us to the demand side of 
the equation. Again, most important to 
me is reducing the demand for these 
drugs, but both the demand and the 
supply side are related. 
As we discussed, the supply of deadly 
fentanyl was already increasing when 
COVID–19 hit us almost 2 years ago. 
Clearly, this pandemic has led to more 
isolation, anxiety for some, depression 
for others. Millions of Americans lost 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own. Millions have lost loved ones to 
COVID–19. Some in recovery have not 
been able to be with their treatment 
providers or with their recovery coach-
es, as we talked about earlier. Millions 
have had their lives turned upside 
down, and some have turned to drugs 
as a coping mechanism. Others, who 
were on the path to recovery, have suf-
fered setbacks—relapsing into drug use 
again. 
Last month, I visited with Erin 
Helms, who runs recovery homes for 
women in northeast Ohio that I have 
had the chance to visit. Erin told me 
about the challenges during COVID to 
connect people with treatment and re-
covery support services when they 
overdose or when they are being re-
leased out of the criminal justice sys-
tem. When we were in the most restric-
tive time of the pandemic, those people 
fell through the cracks, and we are see-
ing the results of that today. These 
overdose deaths are happening away 
from the national headlines, but they 
are taking a toll all the same. 
As I said, this is truly a nationwide 
crisis. It will take all of us here in Con-
gress coming together to work on a bi-
partisan basis to find solutions to turn 
the tide again, reduce overdose deaths, 
and put more affected individuals on 
the path to recovery. 
So what can we do here in Congress 
in moving forward? What are the an-
swers? 
First, we have got to be able to ad-
dress both the supply side and the de-
mand side. This chart lays out some of 
the ways we can help with both, all of 
which I have talked about tonight. 
This means we need to complete the in-
stallation of enhanced border security 
technology, which has already been ap-
propriated by Congress, so that the 
Border Patrol has the tools it needs to 
complete its national security mis-
sion—so enhanced border security. 
In March, I visited El Paso and saw 
fully funded construction materials 
laying on the ground, at the border, at 
the place where there was a gap in the 
wall. I heard directly from Border Pa-
trol officers about the importance of 
enhancing border security to give them 
the opportunity to complete their na-
tional security mission and help them 
to stop the drugs. 
That is why, at his nomination hear-
ing in October, I pressed Tucson Police 
Chief Chris Magnus, the nominee to be 
Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, on the need to in-
stall the enhanced border technology 
and complete the funded sections of the 
wall. 
Not only are there physical gaps in 
the wall right now that we have al-
ready paid for, but there is technology, 
which, to me, is the most important 
part of the wall. So you need the bar-
rier, but, also, you need the technology 
to be able to monitor it, and it is only 
about 10 percent completed in that El 
Paso sector. That is outrageous.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8802 
November 29, 2021 
Everybody—Republicans and Demo-
crats alike—likes to say they are for 
technology. We should complete the 
technology along the border and help 
the Border Patrol be able to do their 
important job, including keeping these 
deadly narcotics out of our commu-
nities. 
We also must pass the bipartisan 
Border Response Resilience Act, which 
I talked about, that I introduced with 
Senator KELLY. It would provide an ad-
ditional billion dollars to the Border 
Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection folks during a surge in un-
lawful migration, like the one we are 
in right now. 
Due to limited resources, Border Pa-
trol agents are pulled off the border to 
care for migrants, and drug cartels are 
taking advantage of these open gaps in 
our Nation’s security. Even some of the 
checkpoints had to be closed down 
when there was a recent surge on the 
border near Del Rio, TX. Drug interdic-
tion checkpoints here in the United 
States are left unmanned so offices can 
process more migrant families. 
But the supply chain doesn’t start 
and end on the U.S. border. Criminals 
understand the opportunities of the 
globalized world, and they pose a dy-
namic threat to the United States. 
They are smart and adaptable and can 
take advantage of the complexity and 
volume of international trade and trav-
el patterns, and they do that. They also 
understand how to exploit openings in 
law enforcement and regulatory ap-
proaches. 
Many of the ingredients used to 
make fentanyl continue to come from 
China, and Chinese money laundering 
networks have emerged as key enablers 
in the business model of Mexican 
transnational criminal organizations. 
This must stop. While we have a com-
plex and difficult agenda with China, 
this issue needs to remain at the top of 
our list. I urge the Biden administra-
tion to push the Chinese Government 
to be our partner in cracking down on 
these international crime rings rather 
than a tacit enabler. It is in both of our 
countries’ interests. 
Likewise, the issue should be front 
and center in our relationship with 
Mexico. Both of our countries lose 
when the traffickers are successful. 
Our country is inundated with lethal 
substances, and the cartels gain money 
and sometimes American-made fire-
arms that allow them to better wage 
war on the government in Mexico City. 
For both of our countries’ sakes, we 
need to partner more effectively with 
Mexico—international cooperation. 
We should also recognize that these 
adaptable drug traffickers will have 
other options as we go after this cur-
rent supply chain. We saw this after 
the STOP Act started to be imple-
mented and traffickers from China 
shifted to Mexico. There is a risk that 
it becomes a game of whack-a-mole— 
when you stop it in one place and it 
crops up somewhere else. As an exam-
ple, as we work to stop the flow of 
fentanyl ingredients from China, other 
countries, like India, could prove to be 
good alternative sources. We need to be 
prepared to partner with India and 
other potential new sources in this le-
thal supply chain to ensure we con-
tinue to improve our security. 
We also need to continue to enforce 
the provisions in the STOP Act to en-
sure that our postal service does not, 
once again, become the viable option 
for traffickers moving fentanyl into 
the United States. After missing the 
initial October 2019 deadline for full 
implementation of the STOP Act regu-
lations, in March, Customs and Border 
Patrol finally began demanding 100 per-
cent of advanced tracking data on ship-
ments entering the country. That is 
good. I am glad we got there. That 
means that, for every package coming 
into the United States that originates 
from a country like India or China, we 
have a sense of what the package con-
tains, where it is from, and where it is 
going, or else it doesn’t come in. 
However, a number of waivers remain 
in place for these regulations for low- 
risk, low-volume, and less-developed 
countries. These waivers allow some 
countries to continue to skirt these re-
porting requirements, including, if you 
can believe it, Russia. It should not be 
in that category. This means criminals 
in Russia can continue to send poten-
tially illegal packages into the United 
States without our knowing in advance 
what they may contain, posing a sig-
nificant security risk, and undercut-
ting the goals of the STOP Act. 
Frankly, I think it is an unaccept-
able oversight in enforcement, and I 
believe there is bipartisan agreement 
that that is the case. That is why I am 
urging DHS Secretary Mayorkas and 
the Biden administration to narrow 
down the STOP Act waivers and ensure 
that high-risk countries, like Russia, 
have to comply with these critical ad-
vanced tracking data requirements. 
In addition to this added security at 
the border, closer cooperation with the 
international community, and better 
STOP Act enforcement, we need to 
take the unexpected but important 
step to make sure that these deadly 
synthetic opioids actually remain ille-
gal so that our law enforcement can 
take the proper steps to crack down on 
them. In order to avoid prosecution, 
prior to 2018, evil scientists in China 
and drug traffickers started making 
slight modifications to fentanyl, some-
times adjusting a single molecule and 
creating what are essentially fentanyl 
copycats to get around the law. 
While these fentanyl-related sub-
stances have the same narcotic prop-
erties as fentanyl, their tiny variations 
allow them to evade prosecution. Of-
tentimes, actually, these simpler sub-
stances than fentanyl were even more 
deadly. Carfentanil is actually more 
deadly than fentanyl, and that was one 
of the substances that was being made. 
Just this past week, we have learned 
that 
a 
fentanyl-related 
substance 
called para-fluorofentanyl has been dis-
covered laced into drugs in my home 
State of Ohio, as an example. 
To address all of this, the Drug En-
forcement Administration, in 2018, used 
its authority to temporarily classify 
all fentanyl-related drugs as schedule I 
substances, which allows law enforce-
ment to aggressively intercept and de-
stroy them. Unfortunately, this des-
ignation was only temporary. We have 
successfully extended the designation a 
few times, but it will expire in about 2 
months, at the end of January. 
Until we make these fentanyl-related 
drugs—these 
are 
fentanyl 
copycat 
drugs, 
some 
more 
dangerous 
than 
fentanyl—law enforcement will not 
have the certainty they need to go 
after criminals moving these deadly 
substances, and lives will be lost. 
Fortunately, we have legislation, al-
ready, to address this. Our bipartisan 
FIGHT Fentanyl Act, which I intro-
duced with Senator JOE
MANCHIN, 
would fix this problem by permanently 
classifying fentanyl-related drugs as 
schedule I. It is about time. That would 
give our law enforcement the certainty 
to go after synthetic opioids in all of 
its forms and show we are committed 
to addressing the threat posed by this 
dangerous class of drugs. The FIGHT 
Fentanyl Act would increase the costs 
of fentanyl on the street and would be 
an important step toward rededicating 
our efforts to stopping these drugs 
from stealing thousands of lives and 
causing so much pain. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come together and support 
this legislation to help us reduce the 
supply of dangerous synthetic opioids 
on our streets. 
So, again, on the supply side, let’s 
pass legislation to be sure we are mak-
ing fentanyl permanently illegal. 
Let’s look at what we can do on the 
demand side to reduce this demand—in-
satiable sometimes in our country—for 
these illegal drugs: more effective pre-
vention and education and ensuring in-
dividuals struggling with addiction get 
the support they need to overcome the 
disease and no longer feel the need to 
turn to these dangerous substances. 
That is all part of it. 
The first step, to me, is to continue 
to build on what we know has worked. 
Remember, back in 2018, we actually 
had the first year-over-year decrease in 
overdose deaths in the country in 
about three decades—a 22-percent de-
crease in my home State of Ohio in 1 
year. Building on that success starts 
with building on our CARA legislation 
we talked about earlier. 
Before CARA, the Federal Govern-
ment provided no funding of any kind 
for recovery support services, which 
are so essential to so many in over-
coming their addictions. There was 
also no Federal funding for naloxone, 
also known as Narcan, which is so ef-
fective because it is a miracle drug 
that allows first responders to reverse 
the effects of an overdose and save 
lives and get people into treatment. 
CARA also lifted the cap on the num-
ber of patients a doctor could treat

with a medication assisted treatment 
called Suboxone, while also allowing 
nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants to prescribe this medication. 
All of these provisions expanded access 
to treatment, and that was incredibly 
important. 
I remember a father who came to me 
from Ohio and talked about his daugh-
ter. His daughter had an accident, an 
injury. She took pain medication. She 
became addicted to opioids. She then 
shifted to heroin because it was more 
available and less expensive. She was 
in and out of treatment and never took 
it seriously. One day, she went to her 
father and said, ‘‘I am ready. I am 
ready to go into treatment. I am ready 
to turn my life around.’’ He was con-
vinced it was true until he went out to 
find a treatment provider for her, and 
as continues to be the case in some 
communities—and at that time, before 
2018, it was the case in many commu-
nities—there were no beds available. 
There was no treatment option. She 
had to go on a waiting list. While she 
was on the waiting list, she overdosed 
on heroin and died in her own bedroom, 
and her father found her there. 
So all of these provisions we put in 
place expanded access to treatment to 
be able to ensure that those stories are 
not repeated. 
In the 5 years since our CARA legis-
lation has become law, I have visited 
with hundreds of recovering addicts at 
treatment centers; I have visited with 
experts on local addiction and mental 
health boards; and I have been to re-
covery homes and other nonprofits 
across Ohio. We have talked about 
what we can do now to build on the 
successes we were having back in the 
2018–2019 period, as well as what we did 
with regard to CARA 2.0, which is the 
bill that passed in 2018. 
The result of those discussions is 
CARA 3.0—the third CARA legislation. 
I introduced that with Senator WHITE-
HOUSE earlier this year, and it builds 
on the existing CARA framework and 
expands its scope to ensure all Ameri-
cans who are fighting addiction have 
the chance to overcome this disease. It 
does so by addressing three important 
areas: one, research, education, preven-
tion; two, treatment and recovery; and, 
three, criminal justice reform. 
CARA 3.0 will bolster our work to 
prevent drug abuse—before it even hap-
pens—through better research and bet-
ter education and prevention. 
I believe effective prevention is done 
when it is at the community level, 
which is where it is most effective, and 
engages 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
stake-
holders—youth, parents, faith leaders, 
educators—all with a focus on showing 
the risks of drug abuse and addiction. 
There are now about 2,000 community 
coalitions around the country that do 
this, and God bless them for the work 
they do. They benefit from our legisla-
tion called the Drug-Free Communities 
Act, which is also something that is 
important with regard to CARA 3.0. 
Over 25 years ago, I found in my own 
community an antidrug coalition. It is 
now called PreventionFIRST! It is still 
in existence, doing a great job. In fact, 
I had a Zoom call with the leaders of 
PreventionFIRST! last week to learn 
about some of the new innovations 
they are coming up with to reach more 
people. They do a drug survey every 2 
years—they are in the middle of field-
ing that right now—where they get the 
best information. It is almost like a 
census, 
not 
a 
survey, 
from 
high 
schoolers all over the greater Cin-
cinnati area to find out what drugs are 
being used, what people’s attitudes are 
about drugs. They take that and use 
that to try to promote the prevention 
message in a way that is effective. 
I appreciate what they do, again, and 
that is part of what we need to do in 
this new legislation, is to redouble our 
efforts on prevention, to keep people 
out of the funnel of addiction in the 
first place. It is obviously the most ef-
fective way to address this issue. 
In our legislation we call for a mas-
sive new national drug awareness cam-
paign as part of this. I believe that 
ought to be done with help from the 
private sector, by the way. There are 
plenty of people in the private sector 
who have concerns about this issue and 
should. It affects their workforce. 
Certainly, with regard to companies 
that are in the pharmaceutical busi-
ness, they should have a strong inter-
est in this. We could leverage funding— 
taxpayer funding—in ways that could 
create, for the first time in a couple of 
decades, 
a 
very 
effective 
national 
media campaign to get the word out 
there. 
We know that a number of Federal 
Agencies have smaller efforts on this 
front, but we need more coordination 
and a united message coming from the 
Federal Government and from the pri-
vate sector. 
Our bill also includes more for re-
search and development of alternative 
pain treatment methods that don’t 
lead to addiction. To me, it is unbeliev-
able that we are still relying on these 
opioid pain medications that were de-
veloped a couple of decades ago. And 
although some have worked on this 
issue—and I appreciate those research-
ers—we need to put more money and 
focus on this to find ways to treat pain 
without the addictive properties of the 
opioids. 
And CARA 3.0 will also take the im-
portant step of addressing the dis-
proportionate effect the addiction cri-
sis has had on certain vulnerable com-
munities. 
Second, our bill will build on what 
has worked with regard to treatment 
and recovery. So the first step is more 
research, education and prevention. 
The second one is with regard to treat-
ment and recovery. It will double down 
on proven evidence-based addiction 
treatment methods while expanding 
treatment options for groups particu-
larly vulnerable to addiction, including 
young people, new and expecting moth-
ers, rural communities, and commu-
nities of color. 
Third, our bill will build on what 
works and how we treat addiction. It 
will double down on these treatment 
methods. It will, importantly, make 
permanent the current expanded tele-
health options for addiction treatment 
that were temporarily created in re-
sponse to the social distancing required 
by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This is important. Telehealth was 
something that was a necessity during 
COVID. People couldn’t come to the 
doctor for visits. They couldn’t be at 
their treatment providers in person. 
And we wondered whether telehealth 
would be effective. I believe that for 
mental health treatment and for addic-
tion services, behavioral health, that it 
has been incredibly important. And al-
though addictions have gone up during 
this period, obviously, and the overdose 
rates are at record highs, my belief— 
and from talking to experts I have 
come to this belief—it would be even 
worse if we had not had the telehealth 
options. 
So in the dark cloud of the pandemic, 
the silver lining may be that we 
learned how to use telehealth better. 
And our legislation allows that to con-
tinue to be used with reimbursement; 
as an example, Medicaid reimburse-
ment or Medicare reimbursement. 
CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recov-
ery options for individuals working to 
put addiction behind them through 
funding to support the recovery sup-
port services and networks. It elimi-
nates the waiver required of physicians 
who want to provide medication-as-
sisted treatments to their patients and 
changes the law to allow those drugs to 
be prescribed via telehealth for greater 
ease of access. 
The 
bill 
will 
also 
help 
to 
destigmatize addiction recovery in the 
workplace by ensuring that one of 
these medications to treat addiction 
does not count as a drug-free work-
place violation. 
Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our crimi-
nal justice system to ensure that those 
struggling with addiction, including 
our veterans, are treated with fairness 
and common sense, putting them on a 
path to recovery rather than a down-
ward spiral of abuse. 
Importantly, CARA 3.0 funds a De-
partment of Justice grant program to 
help incarcerated individuals strug-
gling with addiction to receive medica-
tion-assisted treatment while they are 
still in the criminal justice system. 
This means that when they are re-
leased, they have a much higher chance 
of success. 
If someone is addicted, and you don’t 
treat it, and you let them out of the 
system, they are very likely to go back 
to a life of addiction. But if we allow 
medication-assisted treatment in the 
criminal justice system, we will reduce 
recidivism or repeated offenses. I think 
that makes sense for the person ad-
dicted, for the community, and cer-
tainly for the taxpayer. 
CARA and CARA 2.0 have given 
States and local communities new re-
sources and authorities to make a real

difference. 
CARA 
3.0 
renews 
and 
strengthens these programs. And given 
the recent spike in addiction, it pro-
vides a boost in funding as well. When 
added with the existing CARA pro-
grams that are authorized through 
2023, we would be investing over $1 bil-
lion per year to address this long-
standing epidemic, putting us on the 
path toward a brighter future free from 
addiction. 
The addiction epidemic has proven to 
be resilient. It is a disease that knows 
no ZIP Code, and one that is always 
ready to come roaring back should we 
not stay vigilant. 
Columnist Peggy Noonan was exactly 
right when she wrote a couple of weeks 
ago in the Wall Street Journal that: 
We have a deep and profound addiction cri-
sis in our country and we’ve had it so long 
we forget to see it . . . and nobody’s talking 
about it because nobody has a plan. 
She is exactly right. We need a plan 
right now to tackle this crisis that 
continues to devastate our country. I 
have laid out one tonight that can give 
us some understanding of the mag-
nitude of the problem, the nature of 
the challenge, but also have the Fed-
eral Government take concrete steps to 
turn the tide once again. Again, we 
have done it before. Let’s do it again. 
Washington can and should be a part-
ner to the State and local groups on 
the ground every day working to com-
bat this crisis. We should be a better 
partner. We have got to all work to-
gether to find constructive solutions to 
the addiction epidemic and ensure 
more Americans don’t suffer in silence, 
that we don’t lose more lives to these 
deadly drugs but instead ensure that 
more Americans can achieve their God- 
given potential in life. 
I yield back my time.
