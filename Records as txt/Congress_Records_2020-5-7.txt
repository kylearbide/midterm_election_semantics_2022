The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for 90 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
my Iowa offices are located in Cedar 
Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des 
Moines, Sioux City, and Waterloo. My 
State staff serves as my eyes and ears 
in communities from one side of the 
State to the other. From the Mis-
sissippi to the Missouri Rivers, my 
staff has their fingers on the pulse of 
Iowans, and this pandemic is no excep-
tion. They are working tirelessly to 
troubleshoot problems Iowans are fac-
ing related to the public health emer-
gency and the economic fallout. No 
matter the concern, the problem, or 
circumstance that is affecting a farm, 
a business, school, or local hospital, 
my staff is on the ground ready to help. 
In the early weeks of the pandemic, 
they helped troubleshoot issues for 
Iowans who were overseas to get them 
back home to the United States. One 
example: In Peru, several young people 
were stranded and wanted to come 
home. They didn’t get them home very 
fast, but they are home now. 
Since Congress passed the CARES 
Act, my staff has answered countless 
questions from Iowans about the Pay-
check Protection Program, economic 
injury disaster loans, and economic im-
pact payments. Whatever the question 
or redtape may be, my staff goes the 
extra mile to serve Iowans. They do 
whatever it takes to track down an an-
swer and help make government work 
for the people as the government 
should work for the people. 
As always, they are in the trenches 
during this pandemic, working to help 
Iowans 
get 
through 
this 
and 
get 
through it together. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2300 
May 7, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the United States is battling the worst 
pandemic in 100 years. Our Nation has 
poured unprecedented resources into 
defending 
Americans’ 
health 
and 
blunting the damage to our economy. 
The Senate will continue to work on 
this front. We will find more ways to 
keep strengthening our healthcare re-
sponse and pivot the Nation toward re-
covery. That will include strong legal 
protections to defend healthcare work-
ers, small businesses, and other insti-
tutions against the trial lawyer feeding 
frenzy as they work hard to keep serv-
ing their neighbors. 
FISA 
But, Madam President, amid the pan-
demic, we cannot lose sight of the 
other threats we still face as well. The 
challenges that we faced before COVID– 
19 began to spread from Wuhan, China, 
are still with us today, alongside this 
awful virus. There are terror cells, hos-
tile foreign intelligence services, and 
adversaries all over the world who 
would love nothing more than for the 
United 
States 
to 
apply 
social 
distancing to our presence on the world 
stage as well. 
Iran has not let popular unrest, a 
mismanaged economy, or COVID–19 
slow their meddling, from Yemen to 
the Mediterranean. Tehran and its 
proxies 
are 
undermining 
the 
sov-
ereignty of Iraq and Lebanon, aiding 
and abetting Assad’s mass murder in 
Syria, sowing regional unrest, threat-
ening Israel, and targeting American 
troops and our interests. 
A regime that chooses to spend its 
scant resources on exporting violence 
or a so-called space program does not 
need relief from sanctions. We must 
maintain the measure of deterrence we 
restored with the decisive strike on 
Soleimani. That starts today with up-
holding the President’s rightful veto of 
a misguided War Powers Resolution. 
Meanwhile, in apparent repudiation 
of the Trump administration’s efforts 
to help end the civil war in Afghani-
stan, Taliban attacks against the coun-
try’s government and its people have 
actually spiked. ISIS, al-Qaida, and 
Haqqani terrorists continue to operate 
from Afghan territory. 
Over in Moscow, Putin’s regime con-
tinues to threaten American interests 
along with international security— 
from bullying incursions in the free 
states it used to rule, to influence-ped-
dling and mercenary adventurism in 
the power vacuums of Syria and Libya, 
to spreading disinformation and under-
mining democracies all across the 
globe. 
Russian intelligence is not alone in 
targeting America. China’s efforts to 
steal government industry secrets are 
unmatched. 
Countering these kinds of hostile ac-
tivities is a key job of our intelligence 
community, and so is stopping ter-
rorist attacks against our homeland. 
So next week, the Senate will turn 
back to reauthorizing the critical au-
thorities in the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act. The House-passed 
legislation we will take up is not a 
blanket reauthorization of FISA; it is a 
careful update designed to provide 
greater accountability for the way 
these authorities are exercised. It will 
increase transparency in the FISA 
process and respond to the shameful 
abuses of 2016 while preserving the 
toolbox that professionals use to de-
fend us. I hope the Senate will pass it 
next week, free of amendments that 
would jeopardize important tools to 
keep America safe. 
CHINA 
Madam President, there is the mat-
ter of the People’s Republic of China. 
This coronavirus pandemic originated 
in China. Whether the virus escaped 
from a lab or was transmitted at a so- 
called wet market, we do not yet know 
for sure, but China’s Communist Party 
leaders probably do know, and they 
owe it to all the nations suffering from 
this virus to be truthful and to be 
transparent. The world deserves the 
facts—all of the facts. 
Here is one fact we do know: The 
virus spread was exacerbated by Chi-
na’s unconscionable efforts to cover it 
up. The Communist Party reprimanded 
and threatened to jail Dr. Li Wenliang, 
the heroic whistleblower who tried to 
warn the world about COVID–19 and 
later died from it. Within hours of his 
death, by the way, a wave of outrage 
over CCP’s treatment of Dr. Li spread 
on Chinese social media until the gov-
ernment censored that as well. 
At the peak of the outbreak, the Chi-
nese Communist Party was reportedly 
welding its own people inside their own 
houses. And today, you better believe 
the party commissars are training 
their sights on the Chinese survivors, 
activists, and lawyers who dare to seek 
the truth. 
Outside the borders, China’s leaders 
seem to think they could either charm, 
cajole, or threaten the world into sub-
mission. They supposedly donated med-
ical supplies to foreign countries that 
quickly proved faulty and unusable. 
They threatened to boycott Australian 
beef. They even threatened to cut off 
pharmaceutical exports to the United 
States so that we would be ‘‘plunged 
into the mighty sea of coronavirus.’’ 
It is galling but not surprising. This 
is the same authoritarian regime that 
brutalized the Uighur people in mod-
ern-day gulags and that has spent 
years cheating its way through inter-
national commerce and stealing indus-
trial secrets. 
Now it is exploiting the global pan-
demic it helped exacerbate to further 
its crackdown on Hong Kong. A few 
weeks ago, the government arrested 
peaceful democracy activists, including 
my old friend of almost three decades, 
Martin Lee. I suppose they thought the 
rest of the world might be too dis-
tracted to notice. They were mistaken. 
Alongside our friends and partners 
around the world, the United States is 
going to be asking tough questions 
about our relationship with the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
I expect the Senate will soon look to 
pass Senator RUBIO’s Uyghur Human 
Rights Policy Act, a bipartisan bill 
that will bring more attention to the 
plight of this mistreated minority and 
urge the President to use targeted 
sanctions against those responsible for 
the repression. 
While we and our allies already saw 
the risks from letting critical supply 
chains become too dependent on China, 
the Chinese Communist Party’s recent 
behavior has certainly hammered this 
home. I am confident that we here in 
Washington will be examining these 
strategic vulnerabilities as well. 
We will be looking for the best ways 
to strengthen our dynamic and innova-
tive private sector, keep America on 
the cutting edge, and work closely with 
friends who share our values and inter-
ests to build a fairer, more resilient 
international market. 
Notice that China is not retrenching 
or drawing back within its borders— 
quite the opposite. 
So if we want to preserve a world 
built on our democratic values and 
principles, if we want to protect Amer-
ican workers, American interests, and 
American national security, all of 
these things will take more global 
leadership and more coordination with 
our allies, not less. 
Tomorrow, May 8, is the 75th anni-
versary of VE Day. If we ever needed a 
reminder that American strength is a 
force for good in the world, there it is. 
Thanks to the tireless work of our col-
league, Senator PAT ROBERTS, tomor-
row was meant to be the dedication of 
the new Eisenhower Memorial. It has 
been postponed due to the virus. It al-
most seems fitting that 75 years after 
World War II, the celebration of Presi-
dent Eisenhower would be delayed by a 
global crisis that will take American 
strength and American leadership to 
resolve. He certainly knew something 
about that kind of situation. 
Now, as then, the American people do 
not want to retreat from the world, and 
they do not want to see us slide into 
second place. They want us to be smart 
and strong and safe, and they want the 
United States of America to lead. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,

S2301 
May 7, 2020 
will be over 30 million newly unem-
ployed Americans over the past 7 
weeks. That is a tenth—1 out of 10 peo-
ple—losing their job. A tenth of our 
population. 
We are looking at what seems to be 
the worst economic crisis since the 
Great Depression. Small businesses 
have shuttered. Some larger businesses 
have filed for bankruptcy. Millions of 
workers, through no fault of their own, 
are being laid off or furloughed or are 
losing their paychecks. They are wor-
ried about keeping their homes, feed-
ing their kids, accessing healthcare. 
Once this crisis is over, we can’t snap 
our fingers and have everything return 
to normal. Twenty to 30 million newly 
unemployed Americans will not imme-
diately return to their old jobs. Hope-
fully, many can, but many jobs just 
will not be there. 
The disease has washed over our Na-
tion like a flood. Once the waters have 
receded, there will be a great deal of 
damage left in its wake. We need a big, 
bold answer to this. We need to mar-
shal a broader spirit of action. The 
American people need an active, en-
gaged, and forceful government to lift 
them up and carry them through these 
dark times. 
Speaker PELOSI and I are working on 
a big, bold plan that will deal with the 
magnitude of the problem. 
So I am appalled today that Repub-
lican congressional leaders and Presi-
dent Trump are saying that we should 
delay more assistance to the American 
people. 
A week ago, the Republican leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, said that we need 
‘‘to push the pause button.’’ 
Tell that to someone who is losing 
his job. Tell that to someone who has 
worked so hard to create a small busi-
ness over decades and sees it falling 
apart. Tell that to the family who has 
a member that is sick with COVID or 
something else and can’t get adequate 
healthcare. 
To say that we should wait and see 
what is happening, as Leader MCCON-
NELL has said, that maybe we don’t 
need to do anything more is ignoring 
what is going on around us. 
Over 30 million are unemployed, and 
certain Republican leaders are saying: 
Let’s hit the pause button on future 
government support. 
The Republican leader of this Cham-
ber called us back into session, despite 
the obvious health risks, not to con-
sider new relief or respond to the 
COVID pandemic but to process nomi-
nations. He has been coming to the 
floor, drawing redlines in the sand, 
pledging not to support another emer-
gency relief bill unless it extends legal 
immunity to big corporations. 
Today, he gave a very long speech on 
national security. Now, that is very 
important, but the No. 1 immediate 
crisis facing us is COVID, and this 
speech was sort of a metaphor for what 
Senate Republicans are doing this 
week on COVID—virtually nothing. 
Senator CARDIN and I and Senator 
SHAHEEN went to the floor and simply 
asked for a simple bill to pass that 
would require accountability in PPP, 
and it was blocked by the majority. So 
this is just amazing. 
There has been large support in Con-
gress to stabilize the big financial mar-
kets, support larger industries, and 
keep capital markets from crashing. 
There will be $4 trillion available when 
the Fed and Treasury are through with 
it. We must do the same, if not more, 
for average people—workers, families. 
The contrast is glaring. The contrast is 
glaring. 
Larger companies know they have a 
floor. The big markets know they have 
a floor. An unemployed worker has no 
floor until we do things for them like 
we did for pandemic unemployment in-
surance. 
There are many more people, average 
Americans, who need the same kind of 
help or a greater degree of help, or a 
different kind of help, and many of 
these average folks are in worse shape. 
Democrats have strived to make as 
much of our congressional relief effort 
flow to workers and average American 
families—as much as possible. It is still 
not enough. State and local govern-
ments—that 
means 
teachers, 
fire-
fighters, police officers, and busdrivers 
who might be laid off—still need help. 
Our essential workers deserve hazard 
pay. Minority-owned and women-owned 
businesses still need more access to 
lending. Renters and homeowners need 
relief. And millions of working people 
need enhanced nutrition benefits, as 
thousands and thousands of people are 
overwhelming our local food banks. 
But now that assistance to big indus-
tries has gone out the door, Republican 
leaders are saying: Let’s wait and see. 
The unemployed worker doesn’t want 
to wait and see. The small business 
that might go under doesn’t want to 
wait and see. The mom or dad who 
needs to feed their hungry children 
does not want to wait and see, like our 
Republican leaders seem to. Now is not 
the time to wait and see. Now is the 
time to move forward. 
Our history is replete with examples 
of what happens when the Federal Gov-
ernment doesn’t rise to the occasion in 
a time of national emergency. In the 
early days of the Great Depression, 
President Herbert Hoover was reluc-
tant to use national resources to com-
bat a national crisis. His failure to act 
contributed to the length and severity 
of the depression. 
If our Republican colleagues, if Presi-
dent Trump, respond with the same ti-
midity as President Hoover did, I fear 
the Nation could suffer the same con-
sequences as it did in the past, and 
many economists agree. If we do noth-
ing more, like some of our Republican 
colleagues seem to feel we should, a 
good number of economists believe we 
will have our second Great Depres-
sion—Herbert Hoover redux on the Re-
publican side when President Trump, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
and 
Leader 
MCCARTHY say: Let’s wait and see. 
Republicans weren’t worried about 
the deficit when we spent billions to 
keep big businesses from folding, but 
all of a sudden they are worried about 
it when we are talking about families 
keeping the roofs over their heads and 
putting food on the table. We need a 
fourth congressional relief bill that 
mirrors the size and ambition of our 
previous relief efforts. Working people 
and truly small businesses are taking 
the blunt effects of this crisis on the 
chin, 
and 
we 
cannot—cannot—and 
must not leave them behind. 
Now, there are plenty of things the 
Federal Government can do in the in-
terim, even before another round of 
legislation in Congress. I want to men-
tion one idea this morning. There are 
many more. 
Several big, publicly traded compa-
nies that have received small business 
loans have started sheepishly returning 
the money to the Treasury Depart-
ment—rightly so. Many have much 
greater access to other capital than 
true 
small 
businesses, 
and 
they 
shouldn’t crowd out the lending of 
those small businesses that truly need 
it. Secretary Mnuchin has told me that 
roughly $10 billion in loans have been 
paid off or returned by these large com-
panies. Ten billion dollars happens to 
be the same amount we have asked the 
Treasury Department to set aside ex-
clusively for lending by community de-
velopment financial institutions and 
minority deposit institutions. 
So this morning I would like to urge 
the Treasury Department to imme-
diately set aside the money being re-
turned by big, publicly traded compa-
nies in the PPP for loans to businesses 
that are truly small—the very small 
businesses with under 10 employees and 
other underserved, rural, minority- 
owned and women-owned businesses. 
Too many big companies rushed in to 
secure small business lending in the 
early days of the PPP program, while 
smaller businesses were shut out. The 
administration should have been far 
more careful about who got the lending 
and put out much stronger guidance to 
the banks in the early days, something 
I believe they are trying to correct 
now. 
We can begin to right those dispari-
ties if Treasury would simply redi-
rect—redirect—the returned loans to 
truly small and underserved businesses 
using community-based lenders. I hope 
Secretary Mnuchin will agree to this. 
Another issue that cannot wait for 
another bill, of course, is testing. Test-
ing is the key to finally defeating this 
disease, and it is the key to safely re-
opening the country. 
President Trump promised on March 
6—his words: ‘‘Anybody that wants a 
test can get a test.’’ That was Presi-
dent Trump 2 months ago. It is still 
not even close to being true. President 
Trump seems to think that by saying 
something, it happens. By saying it is 
a hoax, he thinks it was a hoax. By 
saying it is going to go away, he thinks 
it would go away. This COVID virus 
does not listen to President Trump’s 
cheery and false words, unfortunately.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2302 
May 7, 2020 
President Trump, when it comes to 
testing, what is the plan? Where are 
the tests? 
Countries like South Korea and Ger-
many, New Zealand and Australia were 
able to flatten the curve much more 
quickly than we have by rigorously 
testing their populations, contact trac-
ing, and isolating confirmed cases. 
But as the coronavirus spread ini-
tially, 
unfortunately, 
the 
United 
States lagged far behind these other 
countries. Some experts believe we 
need to have at least 2 million tests a 
day. Today we are testing less than 
300,000. 
For the administration to pressure 
States and businesses to reopen with-
out a plan for a dramatic increase in 
testing is like sending them out of the 
door with a blindfold on. It is dan-
gerous. 
Congress has required the adminis-
tration to produce a national strategy 
on testing by May 24. Instead of wast-
ing energy praising his own perform-
ance and lashing out at supposed en-
emies, the President should roll up his 
sleeves and get to work on testing. The 
patience of the American people is 
wearing very, very thin. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
live in a dangerous world, and this 
morning we were reminded as the Re-
publican leader came to the floor and 
spoke about foreign policy. Later on 
today, we will address the issue of a 
veto override on the War Powers Act, a 
measure which I cosponsored. 
It may surprise some people that we 
are in the area of foreign policy on our 
Senate agenda this week, because in 
this dangerous world that we live in, 
we all know that the first thing we 
look for is the danger at the doorstep. 
Our danger, of course, is a national 
emergency, as President Trump has 
characterized it, a public health cri-
sis—the COVID–19 coronavirus threat 
to the United States and all of our fam-
ilies. 
Many of us who came back to Wash-
ington this week were wary because we 
had been warned to stay in our homes 
as long as possible, to stay out of cir-
culation, and not to gather in work-
places unless absolutely necessary. All 
of us thought if we were going to re-
turn, we hoped the priority would be 
this looming crisis in America, this 
public health crisis. But, sadly, as we 
bring this week’s legislative activity to 
a close, little, if anything, has been 
said or done on the Senate floor or in 
committee to address the issue at the 
moment. 
What are we going to do to protect 
Americans and their families? 
Senator MCCONNELL brought us back 
for a hearing for one of his favorite 
judges—a Federal judge in Kentucky, a 
young man who was an intern in his of-
fice and whom he is now trying to pro-
mote to the second highest court in the 
land. 
In the ordinary course of Senate 
business, this would not be unusual. It 
might have drawn some attention be-
cause of the qualifications of this indi-
vidual, but attention has been given to 
it as people compare it to the real 
issues that we should be facing. 
When you think about the issues be-
fore us, one of them is very imminent. 
Across the street from the U.S. Senate 
is the Supreme Court building. Pending 
before the Supreme Court at this mo-
ment is a lawsuit brought by President 
Trump and Republican attorneys gen-
eral from across the United States to 
abolish the Affordable Care Act—to 
abolish an Affordable Care Act that 
provides health insurance for 20 million 
Americans and also provides protec-
tions in the health insurance policies 
for another 135 million Americans—a 
law which basically says if you have a 
preexisting condition, you can’t be de-
nied insurance coverage. 
At this moment in our history, at 
this moment as we face this health cri-
sis, it is unimaginable that the Repub-
lican position is to eliminate health in-
surance protection for 20 million Amer-
icans and to lessen the protections in 
health insurance policies for 135 mil-
lion more. So far, 1.2 million Ameri-
cans have been diagnosed as infected 
with the COVID–19 virus. Sadly, some 
70,000 Americans have died. What is 
going to happen in the days and 
months and years ahead if the Repub-
licans have their way and if preexisting 
conditions return to health insurance? 
Will there be a day when you or your 
spouse or your parent or your children 
will be asked if you were ever diag-
nosed positive for COVID–19? Will this 
be a disqualification in the future if we 
don’t have the protection when it 
comes to preexisting conditions? That 
is not out of the realm of possibility. 
How can the Republicans be thinking 
that this is the right moment in his-
tory to abolish the Affordable Care Act 
and the health insurance that 20 mil-
lion Americans count on and 135 mil-
lion Americans who have their own 
health insurance plans take advantage 
of? It is exactly the wrong moment. 
There was an effort to abolish this 
Affordable Care Act—they like to call 
it ObamaCare—on the floor of the Sen-
ate in the last 2 years. I still remember 
the 
moment 
when 
Senator 
John 
McCain, the late Senator from Arizona, 
came to the floor in the early morning 
hours and gave the motion for a ‘‘no’’ 
vote, and that was the end of the story. 
The Republican abolition effort ended 
with that vote. You would think they 
learned their lesson. 
Senator McCain and other Repub-
licans said: We cannot eliminate this 
unless we have something better to re-
place it with. 
They didn’t then. They don’t now. 
Attorney General Barr warned the 
Trump White House not to go forward 
with this lawsuit pending in the Su-
preme Court. He understood that it was 
unwise not only from a policy view-
point, but it was unwise politically. 
Imagine, if you will, in the weeks and 
months ahead, should this Court, this 
Roberts Court, decide to abolish the 
Affordable Care Act in the midst of 
this public health crisis—I can’t think 
of anything more catastrophic when it 
comes to these 20 million families and 
their health insurance protection and 
the 100 million-plus who count on this 
protection against discrimination for 
preexisting conditions. 
That is the reality we face, but it is 
not the only reality. A decision was 
made this week that is almost impos-
sible to understand. There was a tele-
phone conference call involving leaders 
from all around the world. These lead-
ers came together to discuss something 
that we are all praying for—the dis-
covery of a vaccine that will protect us 
from this coronavirus. They wanted 
money pledged, some $8 billion. Nor-
way pledged $1 billion. The European 
Union pledged $1 billion. When they 
went around the table, there was a 
chair that was empty. The United 
States of America wasn’t at the con-
ference. The President made a con-
scious decision that we would not en-
gage in this conversation about the dis-
covery of a lifesaving vaccine. Why? 
What was he possibly thinking? 
This notion of America first, which 
we hear over and over again, has some 
value, of course, but when it comes to 
a global pandemic, when it comes to a 
global challenge, when it comes to the 
fact that over 90 countries around the 
world are searching for that vaccine, 
when it comes to the fact that most of 
us don’t really care where it is found as 
long as it is found and the sooner the 
better and that we have access to it for 
Americans as well as everyone else— 
that is the bottom line. It isn’t about 
America being first and only when it 
comes to the vaccine. Even the Senate 
Republican leader said this morning 
that we can’t retreat from the world. 
It is so appropriate to have this glob-
al vaccine conference. Two Americans 
were involved in this conference—in 
this virtual conference call—Bill and 
Melinda Gates. We know his back-
ground, his great success at Microsoft, 
and his commitment, with his wife, 
ever since to global health issues. They 
were at the table speaking for the 
United States, and I want to personally 
thank them for being there, but we 
should have been there as well. The 
President of the United States should 
have been on that conference call. He 
should have said: The United States is 
going to help find this vaccine wher-
ever it is found in the world. We are 
going to be at the table when we talk 
about producing it in quantities that 
will make a difference for people living

everywhere in the world, including the 
United States, and we are going to be 
here as well when we apportion those 
vaccine doses so we make certain that 
Americans have their fair share and 
that we can protect our own country. 
Do you want to reopen the economy, 
Mr. President? Do you want to liberate 
America from the CDC suggestion that 
we shelter in place? Do you want to lib-
erate us truly? Then join in this con-
ference and this conversation among 
leaders across the world to find this 
vaccine. 
I hope we can find it in the United 
States. We have a lot of talented people 
searching, but if another country finds 
it, let’s applaud that. If it is an effec-
tive and safe vaccine that protects us, 
let’s applaud whatever country finds 
it—including the United States, of 
course, but if it is found in another 
country, we are not going to be part of 
the conversation as long as this Presi-
dent folds his arms, juts out his chin, 
and says: I am sorry, the WHO—the 
World Health Organization—is at the 
table, and we want no part of them, so 
we are staying away. 
Pride cometh before the fall, Mr. 
President. You can’t expect the Amer-
ican people to fall with you because of 
your own source of pride. We should 
deal with the reality of what we face in 
this world. 
Let me say a word about the State 
and local governments because as we 
consider the next round of legislation 
to help this economy, we certainly 
want to make certain that unemploy-
ment insurance will be available for 
the millions of Americans—over 30 mil-
lion Americans who are unemployed. 
The current round of unemployment 
insurance is set to expire around July 
31. We want to make certain that small 
businesses that are receiving forgivable 
loans so they can be poised and ready 
to reopen and go into business, put peo-
ple back to work—that is supposed to 
end around the end of June. I pray that 
this whole controversy and this crisis 
will be behind us by then, but we know 
better. We know it will take some time 
to get the economy back in gear. Let’s 
make sure that we renew our commit-
ment to the people in this country, the 
families in this country, the unem-
ployed in this country, and the small 
business owners as well. 
But don’t forget the others who are 
counting on us. Don’t forget our first 
responders. How often have we stood up 
and responded and praised police, fire-
fighters, paramedics, medical profes-
sionals, and nurses who stepped up in 
the midst of this crisis and showed ex-
traordinary courage, some giving their 
lives in the process? Well, part of their 
future depends on us in the next bill. 
Are we going to stand up to make sure 
that State and local governments, 
which have been hard hit by this crisis 
as well when it comes to their own rev-
enue, will get a helping hand? God for-
bid we reach a point where, because of 
the shortcomings in the State and 
local revenue, we have to lay off police, 
firefighters, healthcare workers, and 
teachers. Is that what we want to do in 
this moment? 
A few weeks ago, when he was asked, 
Senator MCCONNELL
said we should 
consider bankruptcy—bankruptcy for 
State and local governments that can’t 
pay their bills. What a disaster that 
would be. You want to see America 
cartwheeled into a recession leading to 
a depression? Bankruptcies from one 
end of America to the other by State 
and local governments would do just 
that, and the damage it would do to 
first responders who would be laid off 
as a result of it, the police and the fire-
fighters and the teachers, is incalcu-
lable. We can’t let that happen to 
America. 
A bankrupt America is an America 
headed for a depression, and when Sen-
ator MCCONNELL
suggested that, I 
thought to myself, he hasn’t thought 
this through. He cannot be saying that 
to the teachers of Kentucky and the 
police and the firefighters and the med-
ical professionals who count so much 
on our support. 
At this point, there are things we can 
do and must do. My checklist would in-
clude hazard pay for those I mentioned, 
including the healthcare workers, and 
most importantly, a dramatic increase 
in testing. We have about one-third of 
the test kits we need to put America 
back to work. 
We look at situations like the ones 
facing us in meat-processing facilities. 
It has created a real hardship on con-
sumers across America. But don’t for-
get the producers of livestock in South 
Dakota and Illinois and Tennessee. 
They are producing pork and beef to be 
headed to the processing plants, and 
the plants are closed down. It is a 
downturn in demand for sure but also 
working conditions, which need to be 
addressed directly so there is safety in 
the workplace for all American work-
ers. 
When the Senate Republican leader 
comes to the floor and talks about how 
we don’t want anybody held respon-
sible or liable for their conduct or mis-
conduct during the course of this, I 
think he is not thinking through clear-
ly what he is talking about. In this sit-
uation, you certainly wouldn’t want to 
deny to nurses, who were seeking pro-
tection with protective equipment— 
masks, 
gloves, 
and 
gowns—you 
wouldn’t want to deny them a day in 
court, if necessary. You wouldn’t want 
to say to workers who were in dan-
gerous situations in the workplace that 
they can’t collect workers’ compensa-
tion even if they are injured or sick. 
But when I hear the Republican leader 
talk about COVID–19 lawsuits—both 
the lawsuits I just described relate to 
COVID–19, and both call for simple fair-
ness when it comes to protecting work-
ers and families over large corpora-
tions. 
The Senate leader has come to the 
floor so many times and said that the 
real enemy here are the lawyers of 
America. Really? At this moment in 
history, that is the fight we want to 
pick? It is time for us to come to-
gether, not to make something like 
that a redline against continued bipar-
tisan cooperation. 
I stand here today in the hopes that 
we will come back to session—if we do 
next 
week—to 
truly 
address 
the 
COVID–19 crisis. We have wasted a 
week here when it comes to that crisis. 
We could be doing so much more. 
I hope the Senate Republican leader, 
who sets the agenda for the Senate, 
will go home to Kentucky, and as he 
goes home to Kentucky and talks to 
the families there—and I will in Illi-
nois—we will both come back with the 
realization that the No. 1 priority in 
this dangerous world is the danger at 
our doorstep. Let’s get this under con-
trol and protect the families and indi-
viduals across America so that we can 
resume the path to greatness this 
country has been on since the begin-
ning. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, a 
number of our Democratic colleagues 
have come to the floor and spoken here 
and elsewhere about the importance of 
providing assistance to State and local 
governments and that if that doesn’t 
happen, there are going to be police of-
ficers and first responders and people 
who have essential jobs that we rely on 
every single day and for whom we are 
so grateful who wouldn’t be able to get 
paid. 
I would just point out that already, 
as part of the coronavirus relief meas-
ures that Congress has passed, there 
was $150 billion sent to State and local 
governments, much of which has yet to 
be spent and, frankly, much of which 
we don’t know what the actual need is 
out there until we have a better sense 
of what the revenue loss is to a lot of 
our State and local governments. 
Clearly, they are sounding the alarm, 
and they are justifiably worried about 
what happens if the downturn in the 
economy continues and what that 
might mean to their revenues. They 
are looking to Washington, DC, for as-
sistance. 
I think that, as I said earlier, in the 
CARES package, there was $150 billion 
that went out to State and local gov-
ernments. There have been concerns 
about how those funds can be used. It 
was stipulated that they had to be used 
for COVID-related expenses, and many 
State and local leaders were concerned 
that that did not give them the flexi-
bility that they needed to meet other 
types of needs. 
Well, the Treasury Department has 
in the past few days come out with an 
interpretation that would allow those 
dollars—the $150 billion already appro-
priated—to be used to pay firefighters, 
to pay police, to pay first responders, 
to help with unemployment insurance 
accounts at the State level, to help 
with healthcare costs—the people who 
lose healthcare at the State level—and

May 7, 2020 
a range of other things. It dramatically 
broadened the eligibility of uses for the 
dollars that have already been allo-
cated to State and local governments. 
So I think it is important for us to 
make sure—as we look at any addi-
tional assistance that we might pro-
vide, to determine how well the dollars 
that are already out there have been 
used and to, in fact, see what the ac-
tual needs are before we add to that. 
We had a number of pronouncements 
around here. The Speaker of the House, 
Speaker PELOSI, has come out and said: 
We need $1 trillion in additional assist-
ance for State and local governments. 
It is hard for me to see how you can 
make a statement like that not know-
ing what the original $150 billion has 
been used for or whether it has been 
used at all in some cases. 
The fact that we have $150 billion in 
the pipeline, the eligibility and uses of 
which have been dramatically broad-
ened by the Treasury Department to 
enable States to use it for the very 
things that many of the Democrats are 
coming down here saying: You know, if 
we don’t help State and local govern-
ments, we won’t pay essential work-
ers—that just flat out isn’t true. Those 
dollars can be used for that purpose. 
It makes sense for us, as policy-
makers and custodians and stewards of 
the people’s tax dollars, to ensure that 
the tax dollars we have already put out 
there are having the desired effect and 
to figure out what is working and what 
is not working and to figure out, frank-
ly, what the actual need is before we 
send more money out—and, by the way, 
more money that is all borrowed. 
Every dollar of the $2.8 trillion that we 
have already distributed—and all for 
good reasons. Everybody here was sup-
portive and agreed we needed to do it. 
We needed a dramatic, bold response to 
an extraordinary circumstance, so that 
was done. But every one of those dol-
lars was borrowed. Any dollar we put 
out going forward will be borrowed, 
which means that at some point some-
body has to pay for it, and it is going 
to be our children and our grand-
children. 
There is an argument being made 
that, well, interest rates are low; this 
is a good time to borrow. Well, you 
want to borrow when interest rates are 
low if you have to borrow, but if we 
continue to borrow, there is a point at 
which interest rates, just by virtue of 
the laws of supply and demand, will 
start to go up, and when they do, you 
will see a dramatic increase in the 
amount of dollars we have to use here 
just to pay the interest on the debt, 
which, if interest rates ever normalize, 
will be north of about $1 trillion a year 
and represent literally about 28 percent 
of all Federal spending. 
So, point 1, every dollar we spend is 
a borrowed dollar. Point 2, I think it is 
important for us to see what the needs 
are to be able to put money out there. 
Point 3, there is already $150 billion in 
the pipeline to State and local govern-
ments to help with many of the things 
the Democrats have been complaining 
about. And Point 4, it seems to me, at 
least, that we ought to have a discus-
sion about whether what we have done 
already is working before we decide to 
add to it and see if we are getting a 
good return on the tax dollars that 
have already been put out there. 
I don’t think there is any resistance 
here to giving States more flexibility 
with those dollars. I don’t think there 
is any resistance to doing anything and 
everything we have to to make sure we 
get through this crisis. I think our 
Members certainly agree with that and 
are prepared to make the necessary 
votes and to do what is necessary to 
get us through it. 
Remember also that there is no 
amount of money in Washington, DC, 
that can substitute for a dynamic, vi-
brant, active economy where jobs are 
being created and investments are 
being made. That is how you ulti-
mately start to get things back on 
track in this country. 
So, as we get ahead of the health 
emergency—and, of course, obviously 
this week we celebrate nurses week. I 
am so grateful for the many contribu-
tions they are making not only during 
the pandemic but year-round and the 
people who are on the frontlines of this 
emergency. To ensure that we are 
doing everything we can to support 
them, to beat this health emergency— 
when we do, as the economy starts to 
open up, that is when we will see the 
jobs come back, that is when we will 
see the growth come back, and that is 
when we will see the standard of living 
and the quality of life in this country 
that people have lost in the last few 
months start to return. That is the 
best way to get things back on track 
here. 
I want to just make some comments 
this morning about another area of our 
economy and note that it has been an 
incredibly tough couple of months for 
American businesses and American 
workers. 
Virtually every sector of our econ-
omy is suffering as a result of the 
coronavirus, and the ag industry is no 
exception. Farmers and ranchers have 
taken a huge hit. The coronavirus has 
caused significant market volatility, 
sending 
many 
commodity 
futures 
prices 
plummeting. 
Meanwhile, 
re-
duced capacity at U.S. meatpacking 
plants as a result of the virus has di-
minished the demand for livestock, de-
pressing prices. This has aggravated an 
already difficult situation for farmers 
and ranchers. 
Unlike the majority of the economy, 
which was thriving before the pan-
demic, the agricultural economy has 
been struggling now for a while. Low 
prices, extended trade disputes, and 
natural disasters have made a tough 
few years for farmers and ranchers 
even before the coronavirus hit. Now 
they are suffering even more. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
State of South Dakota. So when Con-
gress was considering coronavirus re-
lief legislation, support for farmers and 
ranchers was one of my top priorities. 
I fought to get agricultural relief 
money included in the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act, or the CARES Act, which was 
signed into law in late March. The final 
bill included $14 billion to replenish the 
Commodity 
Credit 
Corporation 
to 
allow the Department of Agriculture to 
provide income and price support for 
farmers and ranchers, plus an addi-
tional $9.5 billion in emergency support 
for agricultural producers affected by 
the pandemic. 
Days after the bill passed, I led a bi-
partisan group of Senators and rep-
resentatives in a letter to Agriculture 
Secretary Sonny Perdue, urging him to 
use a portion of the funds to provide 
support for hard-hit cattle producers. I 
am pleased that in mid-April the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture announced 
that it would issue $16 billion worth of 
payments to ag producers affected by 
the virus. Those payments are expected 
to reach farmers and ranchers in late 
May or early June. I have been moni-
toring the progress of this relief, and I 
will continue urging the USDA to issue 
these payments as soon as possible. 
Agriculture producers can also take 
advantage of the Paycheck Protection 
Program included in the CARES Act. 
This program provides forgivable loans 
to small businesses, including self-em-
ployed producers, to help them cover 
payroll costs during this difficult time. 
Seventy-five percent of the loans must 
be used for workers’ salaries and bene-
fits, including the salaries of self-em-
ployed workers, while the remaining 
amount can be used for other quali-
fying expenses, like mortgage interest, 
rent, and utilities. The loan can be for-
given completely, as long as borrowers 
follow the requirement that at least 75 
percent of the loan be used to cover 
workers’ salaries and benefits and the 
remainder be spent on other qualifying 
expenses. 
As of this week, farmers and ranchers 
can now take advantage of the Small 
Business Administration’s Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan Program, thanks 
to legislation Congress passed 2 weeks 
ago. 
I am continuing to monitor the cat-
tle market. Livestock producers have 
taken a dramatic hit on the prices they 
are getting for their cattle. At the 
same time, however, the price of pack-
aged meat has risen, and meat packers 
are seeing record profit margins. This 
raises real concerns about potential in-
stances of price manipulation and 
other unfair practices within the beef 
industry, especially considering that 
four meat packing companies control 
more than 80 percent of the beef sup-
plied in the United States. 
In March, I called Secretary Perdue 
to urge the Department of Agriculture 
to take action to ensure the integrity 
of 
the 
cattle 
market 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. I followed up 
with a letter requesting that the Agri-
culture 
Department’s 
packers

stockyard division look into the vola-
tility in the cattle market, and Sec-
retary Perdue has agreed to inves-
tigate. 
I also sent a letter to Attorney Gen-
eral William Barr requesting an inves-
tigation into potential price manipula-
tion or other anti-competitive activi-
ties in the beef market. 
Our pork industry is also struggling 
due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 
temporary closure of the Smithfield 
plant in Sioux Falls created significant 
challenges for the 550 independent pork 
producers from South Dakota and sur-
rounding States and for our Nation’s 
food supply system. 
In the wake of the Smithfield plant 
closure announcement, I wrote a letter 
to Secretary Perdue requesting finan-
cial assistance for pork producers, and 
I have been closely monitoring the sit-
uation. 
I am pleased that the Smithfield 
plant is in compliance with Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration guidance and will gradu-
ally resume operation starting today. 
No discussion of the challenges fac-
ing farmers right now would be com-
plete without discussing biofuels. Eth-
anol and biodiesel producers buy up a 
significant amount of American corn 
and soy, which adds value to each 
bushel. As demand for fuel has de-
creased as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic, ethanol and biodiesel oper-
ations have come offline and are no 
longer buying up their normal amounts 
of corn and soybean oil. This has sig-
nificantly diminished a crucial market 
for our farmers. 
There has rightfully been a lot of 
focus on the oil and gas companies that 
are facing record loss and demand be-
cause of the coronavirus and because of 
an equally difficult oversupply problem 
driven by the Saudi-Russian price war. 
Hard-working Americans at these com-
panies who have helped usher in our 
modern energy renaissance are now in 
limbo, and Congress needs to make 
sure we preserve our energy dominance 
and security. But it is important to 
recognize that the ethanol industry, 
which provides over 10 percent of the 
Nation’s gasoline content—the cleanest 
10 percent, I might add—is a part of 
that. 
Biofuels, too, have been a key part of 
America’s energy renaissance and have 
also been hit hard by the sudden drop 
in demand, which has been a dev-
astating blow for workers in the indus-
try and for the farmers who supply 
them. Half—half—of the Nation’s ca-
pacity has been idle. More than 70 
plants have closed, and just as many 
have idled, directly harming their local 
economies and, again, drying up that 
essential market for our farmers. 
This has brought a new problem. 
Many Americans may not know it, but 
a substantial quantity of food-grade 
carbon dioxide, the CO2 used in carbon-
ated beverages or to quickly chill meat 
products, is an ethanol by-product. 
This means that not only is ethanol 
part of our energy security and a foun-
dation of our ag economy, but it also 
plays an important role in our food 
supply. 
The coronavirus is already straining 
our 
meat 
processing 
industry. 
We 
should not allow a CO2 shortage to 
deepen the problem. 
As Congress addresses the numerous 
challenges facing farmers and energy 
producers, we must make sure that 
ethanol relief is a part of that discus-
sion. Whether it is through direct sup-
port or by advancing long-stalled corn 
fiber 
applications 
at 
the 
Environ-
mental Protection Agency, we need to 
make sure that this American energy 
success 
story 
survives 
these 
chal-
lenging times. 
As we move forward, I will continue 
talking to farmers and ranchers about 
their needs and what we can do to help 
them get through these difficult times. 
Supporting our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers will always be—always be— 
one of my top priorities here in Con-
gress. 
The coronavirus crisis has reminded 
us all just how much we depend on our 
agricultural producers, and I am grate-
ful every day for the work they do to 
feed our Nation. 
I will continue to do everything I can 
to strengthen our agricultural econ-
omy and to help our Nation’s farmers 
and ranchers thrive. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Oregon. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to address the debate we are having 
today over whether to override the 
President’s veto of the Kaine resolu-
tion that reminds the President of the 
United States about the fundamentals 
of the Constitution, about article I, 
section 8 of the Constitution, which 
gives the enumerated powers of Con-
gress and says that Congress, and Con-
gress alone, has the power to declare 
war. 
No decision is tougher or more im-
portant than the decision to go to war. 
That is why the Founding Fathers 
never intended for a single person to be 
able to make that decision. They ex-
plicitly, after intense debate and con-
sideration, gave that power solely to 
Congress, the people’s branch of our 
government. They didn’t want any-
one—any one individual, even the 
President of the United States—to be 
able to drag our Nation to war for per-
sonal 
or 
political 
reasons 
or 
for 
misjudgments, 
inadequately 
vetted 
with the wisdom of the leaders of the 
country. 
Since President Trump came into of-
fice, we have come within a hair’s 
breadth of war with Iran on more than 
one occasion because of his words and 
his actions. It is why back in February 
and March, the Senate and the House 
debated this resolution, reinstructing 
the President on the fundamentals of 
the Constitution, reminding him that 
he does not have the power to take us 
to war in Iran. It instructed him that 
any hostilities with Iran need to come 
in accordance with the Constitution. 
But the President of the United 
States has responded to our clear dec-
laration of the essence of the Constitu-
tion by tossing it aside, by vetoing 
that resolution. And so here we are de-
bating whether to override that veto. 
The Founding Fathers were adamant 
about not having anything resembling 
a King in the new country they were 
building. The President was given the 
power to lead the Nation’s Armed 
Forces as Commander in Chief, but ar-
ticle I, section 8 of the Constitution 
stated: 
‘‘The 
Congress 
shall 
have 
Power. . . . To declare war.’’ 
If there is any real doubt about the 
Founders’ intent, well, let’s return to 
the comments that they made at the 
time. 
James Madison, father of the Con-
stitution, said this: 
The constitution supposes, what the His-
tory of all Governments demonstrates, that 
the Executive is the branch of power most 
interested in war, and most prone to it. It 
has accordingly with studied care vested the 
question of war to the legislature. 
He continued: ‘‘The power to declare 
war, including the power of judging the 
causes of war, is fully and exclusively 
vested in the legislature . . . the execu-
tive has no right, in any case, to decide 
the question, whether there is or not 
cause for declaring war.’’ 
How about George Washington, com-
mander of our forces in the Revolution, 
first President of the United States, fa-
ther of our Nation? He said this: ‘‘The 
constitution vests the power of declar-
ing war in Congress; therefore no offen-
sive expedition of importance can be 
undertaken until after they shall have 
deliberated upon the subject and au-
thorized such a measure,’’ referring to 
Congress. 
How about George Mason of Virginia? 
George Mason remarked that he was 
‘‘against giving the power of war to the 
executive’’ because the President ‘‘is 
not safely to be trusted with it.’’ 
There is more. How about Thomas 
Jefferson, one of the most brilliant 
minds our country has ever produced? 
He said this: ‘‘We have already given in 
example one effectual check to the dog 
of war by transferring the power of let-
ting him’’—the dog of war—‘‘loose from 
the Executive to the Legislative body.’’ 
And Jefferson didn’t just believe that 
these were important words in the Con-
stitution. When he was President and 
when he was being pressured over a dis-
pute with Spain over the boundaries of 
Louisiana and Florida, he wrote to 
Congress stating: ‘‘Considering that 
Congress alone is constitutionally in-
vested with the power of changing our 
condition from peace to war, I have 
thought it my duty to await their au-
thority for using force in any degree.’’ 
How 
about 
Alexander 
Hamilton, 
whom many Americans have been hear-
ing so much about with the play ‘‘Ham-
ilton’’ having been such a hit over the

last few years? What did Hamilton say 
about this? He said: 
‘‘The Congress shall have the power to de-
clare war’’; the plain meaning of which is, 
that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of 
Congress . . . to change that state into a 
state of war.’’ 
Abraham Lincoln was not a Founding 
Father, but he understood absolutely 
what the Founders were talking about, 
and he said this: 
The provision of the Constitution giving 
the war-making power to Congress was dic-
tated . . . by the following reasons. Kings 
had always been involving and impoverishing 
their people in wars, pretending generally, if 
not always, that the good of the people was 
the object. This, our Convention understood 
to be the most oppressive of all Kingly op-
pressions, and they resolved to frame the 
Constitution [so] that no one man should 
hold the power of bringing this oppression 
upon us. 
But we are in a day and age where we 
have the President who does not re-
spect the words of the Constitution, 
does not respect the vision of our 
Founders, does not understand the wis-
dom that the issue of war and the asso-
ciated huge toll in blood and huge toll 
in treasure is absolutely too important 
a decision to be vested in a single per-
son, that it must be a product—a deci-
sion to go to war must be the product— 
of a considered debate of the U.S. Sen-
ate and the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. That is why we proceeded to pass 
the resolution here in February and in 
March down the hall, because the 
President has been beating the drums 
of war since he came to office. He 
started up by tearing up the Iran nu-
clear 
agreement, 
after 
the 
United 
States had led the world in creating an 
effective strategy to end the nuclear 
programs of Iran. He followed it with 
an economic war against Iran that has 
inflicted great suffering on the people 
of that Nation, and, then, so many 
other escalatory provocations and re-
sponses, that without the considered 
response of Congress to remind him 
that he does not have the power to go 
to war, could take us into another Mid-
dle East war. 
We here in the Senate must not allow 
that to happen. We saw the con-
sequences of the last Middle East war 
and the toll of the blood of our sons 
and daughters and of our national 
treasure. We saw that toll, and we 
must not allow a war to occur because 
of a President who disregards the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
The resolution that the Senate and 
House passed, the Kaine resolution, 
says: 
Congress hereby directs the President to 
terminate the use of United States Armed 
Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Re-
public of Iran or any part of its government 
or military, unless explicitly authorized by a 
declaration of war or specific authorization 
for the use of military force against Iran. 
That, by the way, is exactly con-
sistent with the War Powers Resolu-
tion, which is the law of the United 
States of America that notes that the 
power of the President as Commander 
in Chief to involve the United States 
‘‘in hostilities is clearly indicated by 
the circumstances, are exercised only 
pursuant to a (1) declaration of war, (2) 
specific statutory authorization, or (3) 
a national emergency created by at-
tack upon the United States, its terri-
tories or possessions, or its Armed 
Forces.’’ 
That is the law of the United States 
of America backing up the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America, 
founded on the wisdom of the Found-
ers, as you heard one after another, all 
conveying that same message. 
But what was the President’s re-
sponse? 
The President’s response in his veto 
message said that the resolution is in-
sulting. Is it insulting to fight for our 
Constitution to be followed? 
No, Mr. President, it is the responsi-
bility of every Member here to fight for 
the Constitution to be followed, and 
the most important issue we ever con-
sider on the floor of the Senate is the 
issue of whether or not we are going to 
war. 
It is not insulting. It is essential—es-
sential—to remind this President that 
the wisdom of the Constitution stands 
today as it has for more than 200 years. 
The President also cited authorities 
he has under the 2002 authorization for 
the use of military force. Well, let’s see 
what that authorization actually said. 
It said this: 
The President is authorized to use the 
Armed Forces of the United States as he de-
termines to be necessary and appropriate in 
order to— 
(1) defend the national security of the 
United States against the continuing threat 
posed by Iraq; and 
(2) enforce all relevant United Nations Se-
curity Council resolutions regarding Iraq. 
Now, I know people get confused 
about Iraq and Iran, but, Mr. Presi-
dent—and I am speaking to the Presi-
dent of the United States—please, get 
out a map and understand that Iraq is 
not Iran, that this does not give you 
authority to go to war against Iran. 
The President also cites article II of 
the Constitution, and he goes on at 
some length in his veto message saying 
what limited powers this gives him. 
Well, Mr. President—and, again, I am 
speaking to the President of the United 
States—that is not what is written in 
the Constitution. That is not what is 
embodied in the War Powers Resolu-
tion. That is not what our law and 
international law provide as a basis for 
going to war—that the President has 
sole power—and it is absolutely con-
trary to the complete history and 
founding of the United States of Amer-
ica, giving the power of war to this 
body and the House that is down the 
hall. 
In fact, international law and U.S. 
law refer to issues like force being used 
as necessary and proportionate, and for 
the President to be able to act when 
there is an imminent threat. And the 
President takes a shot at this in his 
Trump veto message, referring to the 
fact that he has powers that go far be-
yond to respond to an imminent at-
tack, under article II of the Constitu-
tion. In other words, the President of 
the United States is saying that his 
powers are unlimited, as he asserted in 
so many other arenas—that his powers 
are unlimited to go to war. 
No, Mr. President, they are not, and 
a bipartisan majority of this Senate 
has said that. A bipartisan majority of 
the House has said that. And even if 
your veto stands and we cannot over-
ride it today, it is the Constitution of 
the United States that says that. And 
that should be the final point that 
today, when we vote, let’s vote with 
the Constitution of the United States. 
Let’s vote with the Founders, who so 
explicitly gave that power to this 
Chamber and the Chamber down the 
hall. Let’s vote to say that the wisdom 
that has stood for more than 200 years 
should be the wisdom that prevails 
today when we vote to override the 
veto of the President of the United 
States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
coronavirus has challenged our coun-
try—indeed, the entire planet—like few 
crises before, certainly in my lifetime. 
I was part of the post World War II gen-
eration. No doubt, world war presented 
the preeminent crisis within memory. 
It was, I think, 1917 and 1918 when the 
Great Influenza hit the planet and tens 
of millions of people died in that. 
When this virus began spreading, it 
became clear it would place a severe 
strain on our hospitals and healthcare 
providers. As businesses closed their 
doors and employees lost their jobs, it 
was obvious it would take a toll on the 
incredible economy we had in this 
country. It is like it fell off a cliff. 
The combination of new stresses 
brought on by this virus have led to a 
range of lesser-known but no less se-
vere consequences. Earlier this week, I 
spoke 
about 
the 
impact 
the 
coronavirus is having on our country’s 
mental health. As our lives have been 
flipped upside down, many Americans 
are facing financial struggles, isola-
tion, and anxiety. 
For those who have children at home, 
the challenges are compounded even 
further. A recent poll by the Kaiser 
Family 
Foundation 
disclosed 
that 
nearly half of Americans polled re-
ported that the coronavirus was having 
a negative impact on their mental 
health. That is up from one-third in 
March, and it is not surprising. 
When we talk about the resources 
that we need to overcome this crisis, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
coronavirus 
and 
America’s 
mental 
health cannot be ignored. Beyond the 
silent impact these stresses are having 
on individuals, they can quickly lead 
to violence in relationships. We have 
learned that, in a time of crisis, the 
frequency and severity of domestic vio-
lence incidents are likely to increase.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2307 
May 7, 2020 
Texas experienced the heartbreaking 
reality of that trend in post Hurricane 
Harvey, and we are seeing it again now. 
Last month, I participated in a vir-
tual roundtable with representatives 
from the Texas Council on Family Vio-
lence, the Texas Association Against 
Sexual Assault, and more than a dozen 
other organizations across my State 
that support survivors of domestic vio-
lence. We discussed these stresses and 
how they are impacting victims and 
the barriers that are being created that 
make it harder for these organizations 
and people of good will to provide sup-
port. 
One of these representatives was the 
CEO of the Houston Area Women’s Cen-
ter, Emily Whitehurst. Houston is the 
hardest hit area in our State, with 
about 7,000 cases in Harris County 
alone. Emily said that, in the early 
stages of the virus spreading, they 
weren’t sure whether they would see an 
increase in calls, given that stay-at- 
home orders meant people would be 
isolated with their abusers, but they 
soon found out the answer. 
In early April, the Houston Area 
Women’s Center saw a 40-percent in-
crease in the daily calls to their hot-
line. Compared to the same time last 
year, there was nearly a 50-percent in-
crease in requests for shelter. Many of 
these organizations are already oper-
ating on a tight budget and working to 
make sure every dollar goes as far as 
possible. 
As the need goes up, the advocates 
and organizations who support sur-
vivors are trying to do more and more 
with less and less. I was able to discuss 
the provisions of the CARES Act that 
we passed on March 25, I believe it was, 
and that was signed into law shortly 
thereafter with the provisions we made 
to try to offer some assistance. For ex-
ample, it provided $45 million for pro-
grams funded by the Family Violence 
Prevention and Services Act. These 
support a range of services, such as 
emergency housing for domestic vio-
lence survivors and their children. At a 
time when victims are isolated with 
their abuser and cut off from support 
that they may otherwise have, these 
services are essential. 
Our legislation also sent more fund-
ing to the National Domestic Hotline, 
which is based in Austin, TX, so it can 
continue to provide support and re-
sources to victims as the need expands. 
As good as this funding was, it was 
nothing but a start, and our efforts 
cannot end there. 
One of the big needs that I discussed 
on my virtual meeting with various or-
ganizations was the need for flexibility 
for funding. Organizations are required 
to match Federal funds they receive 
with State or privately raised dollars, 
but during this time of increased need, 
that administrative barrier turned into 
a major roadblock. 
In order to provide immediate relief 
so these groups can continue their life-
saving work, last month, Governor 
Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, 
waived this match requirement. This 
gives organizations the ability to use 
the funding that they have for other 
purposes to fulfill their greatest needs. 
Right now, one of the most urgent 
needs is access to safe housing. If you 
think about it, if you are stuck in an 
apartment with somebody who has 
abused you in the past, perhaps the 
danger is greater because there is no 
money coming in the front door and 
maybe increased alcohol abuse. It is 
easy to see how the biggest need would 
be a safe place to go. Victims can’t 
move on from their abusers without a 
safe alternative to turn to, so it is im-
portant that we make access to shel-
ters and housing as easy as possible. 
Even before the coronavirus out-
break, I introduced a bipartisan bill 
called the HEALS Act to help improve 
victims’ access to housing and the 
services they need. It prioritizes fund-
ing for transitional housing and in-
creases the ability to stay in that 
housing for victims to get back on 
their feet. It also directs the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment to further plan on how best to 
support victims of domestic violence. 
As the Senate considers additional 
legislation 
in 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus, we cannot lose sight of 
these lesser-known consequences of the 
pandemic. We need to continue to sup-
port and prioritize resources for sur-
vivors, and one of the most critical 
ways we can do that is by taking ac-
tion on another piece of legislation 
called the Violence Against Women 
Act. 
For more than 25 years, VAWA, as it 
is known, has been at the forefront of 
our ability to support victims of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault, and 
until recently, it remained high above 
the political fray. The first three times 
the program came up for reauthoriza-
tion, there were certainly some dis-
agreements. That is normal, but we 
were able to finally pull together and 
reach a compromise. 
Unfortunately, that did not prove to 
be the case this time. When the time 
came to once again reauthorize the Vi-
olence Against Women Act last year, 
our friends across the aisle attempted 
to use this must-pass piece of legisla-
tion to score some political points. 
Amid the gamesmanship, VAWA ex-
pired. 
As someone who has been long inter-
ested in victims’ rights, I am an ardent 
supporter of our efforts to reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act, and I 
have constantly fought not only to 
continue but to strengthen this pro-
gram. That is why I am proud to have 
cosponsored the reauthorization bill in-
troduced by our friend and colleague, 
Senator ERNST from Iowa, which would 
provide greater funding and stability 
for this program at a time when both 
are desperately needed. 
The Violence Against Women Act has 
guided our Nation’s effort to confront 
domestic violence and sexual assault 
for more than a quarter of a century. 
The current crisis has highlighted the 
serious need for additional support. I 
am proud of the fact that, despite some 
of the normal dust-ups and squabbles 
and disagreements here, we have large-
ly been able to act as one with passing 
legislation unanimously here in the 
Senate—the CARES Act—and to pass 
other legislation to provide aid to 
small businesses by unanimous con-
sent. 
I would hope the spirit that moved us 
to act in unison before in response to 
this coronavirus would cause us to do 
the same when it comes to reauthor-
izing the Violence Against Women Act. 
There is a time for politics. There is a 
time for policy debates and differences, 
but when it comes to reauthorizing the 
Violence Against Women Act, this is 
not that time. 
I can only hope that all of our col-
leagues will respond to the better an-
gels of our nature, particularly this 
time of crisis when there are so many 
people in danger of domestic violence 
that 
we 
could 
pass 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act reauthorization as 
soon as possible. I think there is more 
we can do and should be doing to sup-
port victims of domestic violence. I 
know our colleagues across the aisle 
feel the same way. This should be a 
nonpartisan endeavor. 
In our efforts to strengthen our Na-
tion’s response to the coronavirus and 
support those harmed in its wake, as 
we are doing that, we cannot allow vic-
tims of domestic violence and sexual 
assault to be left behind. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

VE DAY 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, 75 
years ago, the scene across America 
and Europe was quite different than 
what we see today—thousands of peo-
ple waving flags, dancing, hugging, 
kissing in the streets, all covered in 
confetti. 
In the early morning hours of May 7, 
1945, in the small town of Reims, 
France, 
the 
Supreme 
Allied 
Com-
mander, Dwight David Eisenhower, 
signed Nazi Germany’s surrender and 
sent a cable to Washington and to Lon-
don stating that the mission of the Al-
lied forces was fulfilled, thus ending 
the Nazi pandemic of tyranny and 
genocide. The surrender took effect on 
May 8, and for the first time since 1941, 
the U.S. Capitol was bathed again in 
light. 
Most military historians now agree 
that it was Eisenhower’s unique skill 
and persuasion that enabled the Allied 
effort to be successful. As Winston 
Churchill said, ‘‘There is only one 
thing worse than fighting with allies 
and that is fighting without them.’’

S2308 
May 7, 2020 
Simply put, Ike led the effort to pre-
serve Western democracy and freedom, 
and later, as President in 1953, America 
experienced 8 years of peace and pros-
perity. 
Tomorrow, on the 75th anniversary of 
the victory of Europe—what we call 
Victory in Europe Day, VE Day—the 
Eisenhower Memorial Commission was 
set to dedicate the long-awaited Presi-
dential memorial to Dwight David Ei-
senhower right on the Mall in our Na-
tion’s Capital, just two blocks away. 
Eisenhower once said: ‘‘Plans may 
end up as worthless, but planning is ev-
erything.’’ How right he was. The Com-
mission has set aside our plans for the 
dedication and is now planning a wor-
thy ceremony in the fall. There is 
precedent for this delay. Just as Amer-
ica is pulling together to fight to de-
feat the COVID–19 virus, the Eisen-
hower 
administration 
was 
working 
with the public and the private sector 
until a vaccine was developed by Dr. 
Jonas 
Salk 
and 
disseminated 
all 
throughout our country. Shortly there-
after, an oral and more effective vac-
cine was developed by Dr. Albert Sabin. 
Today, polio is virtually eradicated. 
Today we face the same challenge. 
The Eisenhower Memorial, which 
pays tribute to Ike’s leadership as both 
the Supreme Allied Commander and 
the 
34th 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, is located on the National Mall 
and will not only honor an extraor-
dinary man but will also be a symbol 
for all generations of the promise of 
America and what our values make 
possible within our Nation and all over 
the world. 
I can personally attest to the impact 
Eisenhower had on my life. My dad, 
Wes Roberts, was the Citizens for Ike 
chairman during the 1952 campaign and 
instrumental in the first ballot victory 
over Senator Robert A. Taft from Ohio. 
He later—my dad—became national 
chairman of the Republican Party. So 
at 16 years old, I was a wide-eyed ser-
geant at arms during the Chicago Con-
vention and later attended Ike’s inau-
gural ceremonies in Washington, com-
plete with white tie and tails. I met 
him both times. 
When Ike came into a room, even if 
you had your back to him, you knew he 
was there. He had a ruddy complexion 
and a great and wonderful smile. Ev-
eryone he met liked Ike. As my lapel 
button indicates, we still like Ike. 
I have now come full circle, serving 
as the chairman of the Eisenhower Me-
morial Commission. I know there will 
be dancing in the streets again, and we 
will be able to live our lives freely and 
safely, as Ike and the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion’’ fought to secure. We will dedi-
cate the memorial to Kansas’s favorite 
son and one of our greatest Presidents. 
After all, Ike never gave up, and nei-
ther will we. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise to override the President’s veto of 
S.J. Res. 68, which requires the re-
moval of U.S. troops from hostilities 
against Iran that Congress may not 
have authorized. 
It seems like ages ago that we were 
truly on the brink of a potentially dev-
astating, costly, and unnecessary war 
against Iran, but it was actually just a 
few months ago. 
Make no mistake—even as Iranians 
have suffered the worst outbreak of 
COVID–19 in the Middle East, we have 
witnessed Iran continue its support for 
terrorism, harassment of American 
naval vessels, and general malfeasance 
throughout the region. Indeed, it now 
seems that Iran may be principally re-
sponsible for driving the spread of 
COVID–19 throughout the region. I 
don’t think there is any question about 
Iran’s malign activity. 
More to the point of the legislation 
at hand, I shed no tears for Qassem 
Soleimani, who left a legacy of ter-
rorism, 
bloodshed, 
and 
American 
deaths. However, this body has a con-
stitutional responsibility and preroga-
tive to declare war, to make the deci-
sion about whether to send our sons 
and daughters into battlefields. We 
have the responsibility to ensure that 
the Executive is effectively deploying 
every diplomatic tool it can before 
rushing recklessly into battle, particu-
larly one without clearly defined out-
comes or clarity of purpose. We must 
exercise our check over the Executive, 
particularly when it comes to the life 
and death of Americans. 
Yet this administration continues to 
test the strength of our system of 
checks and balances. We saw it with 
this strike against Soleimani. Then it 
played out several times last year re-
garding congressional prerogatives on 
arms sales. 
This is not the first time the Presi-
dent has faced a vote to override his 
veto. Last year, the House and the Sen-
ate made overwhelmingly clear that we 
had concerns about sales of certain 
weapons to Saudi Arabia following its 
disastrous campaign in Yemen and the 
murder of Jamal Khashoggi. 
As the administration seeks to sell 
more weapons overseas, the Congress 
will continue to assert our prerogative 
when it comes to foreign policy and 
war-making. So, as I did earlier this 
year, I stand in strong support of S.J. 
Res 68. This body must assert its con-
stitutional and congressional preroga-
tive. 
Of course, the President has the right 
to take action to defend against immi-
nent threats to the homeland and to 
Americans abroad. No one disputes 
that—no one. While the President has 
the right to take action to protect 
Americans 
from 
truly 
imminent 
threats and dangers, and we must stand 
in support of our allies and partners, it 
is our responsibility to ensure that he 
is taking the right actions to protect 
Americans and our interests. 
The President does not have the au-
thority to undertake any kind of mili-
tary action he likes, nor does he have 
the prerogative to sell weapons to any 
country he likes absent congressional 
consultation and approval. Unfortu-
nately, as has become a pattern with 
this administration, the legal rational 
it 
has 
offered 
for 
these 
attacks 
stretches the bounds of credulity. 
Following a number of briefings from 
the administration, I found no compel-
ling evidence as to what was the immi-
nent threat or the clear and present 
danger to Americans. In fact, following 
the death of Soleimani, we saw even 
more attacks on American assets and 
interests. 
Just a few weeks ago, Iran was 
harassing our ships in the Arabian 
Gulf, and Iran also claims to have 
launched 
a 
military 
satellite 
into 
orbit. It does not sound like the admin-
istration’s actions have meaningfully 
‘‘restored deterrence’’ of any kind 
against Iranian malign activity. 
Additionally, let me reiterate that 
the idea that somehow the administra-
tion has the authority under the 2002 
AUMF to attack Soleimani simply be-
cause he was in Iraq is completely ludi-
crous. As someone who voted against 
the war in Iraq when I was in the House 
of Representatives during the debate 
over whether to authorize military ac-
tion, I can assure you that it was not 
its intention of that 2002 authorization 
for the use of military force, and it 
does not comport with the history, the 
use, or the plain reading of the text. 
Colleagues, I urge you to stand up for 
our congressional prerogatives, our 
congressional responsibilities, and our 
constitutional responsibilities, and to 
make clear to the President that we 
are a coequal branch of government 
that will hold the Executive account-
able. 
I want to thank Senator KAINE for 
his dedication to this issue and to de-
fending our constitutional rights. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I want to report on an important hear-
ing the Senate HELP Committee just 
completed. Senator MURRAY and I or-
ganized it. We heard from Francis Col-
lins, the distinguished scientist who is 
head of the National Institutes of 
Health, about his new program, funded 
by Congress, to spend $1.5 billion, or 
$2.5 billion if you include the money we 
gave to BARDA, to develop a new tech-
nology that will produce tens of mil-
lions of rapid diagnostic tests for 
COVID–19. 
Mr. President, my opening statement 
at that hearing can be found online at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2309 
May 7, 2020 
Statements&id=1AF0B54F-A9EC–4007– 
9146–E8D386531C4F. 
I would like to refer to a speech made 
by the former majority leader of the 
Senate, Bill Frist, in 2005, which re-
minds us that we have been working on 
these programs for a long time and 
which can be found online at https:// 
asecondopinionpodcast.com/frist-pre-
dicts-global-pandemic/. On April 13, 
‘‘The American Mind’’ published Sen-
ator Frist’s essay, ‘‘A Storm for Which 
We Were Unprepared,’’ which can be 
found 
online 
at 
https:// 
americanmind.org/essays/a-storm-for- 
which-we-were-unprepared/. 
Senator Frist’s speech, which was 
made at a time when we were dealing 
with 9/11 and before Ebola but SARS 
and other viruses, he predicted exactly 
what is happening—we are going to 
have a virus this year, and we will have 
another one, and then we will have an-
other one. 
Since that time, over the last 20 
years, we have had three Presidents—a 
Bush, an Obama, and a Trump—several 
Congresses who passed seven big laws. 
We have created a stockpile, we have 
created an Assistant Secretary for Pre-
paredness, and we have spent the last 5 
years with record investments in the 
National Institutes of Health. 
We were in a situation where, on 
March 1, the New York Times reported 
that ‘‘most experts agree,’’ the Times 
reported on its front page, that the 
United States is better prepared than 
almost any country to deal with this 
epidemic. Yet we were not as well pre-
pared as we would like to have been. 
So we had a hearing today, one, to 
focus on this shark tank, as Senator 
BLUNT and I like to call it, where Dr. 
Collins is inviting the best ideas from 
around the country for new tech-
nologies. 
That is not to say we haven’t been 
testing. The United States, according 
to 
Johns 
Hopkins 
and 
President 
Trump, has tested 7 million Ameri-
cans—more than any country; more per 
capita, for example, than South Korea, 
which we often admire for the way it 
has dealt with COVID–19. So we are 
testing a lot of people. 
But if we want to go back to work 
and we want to go back to school, we 
are going to need to have quick, reli-
able tests for everybody in the nursing 
home, everybody in the meatpacking 
plant, everybody maybe on the college 
campus, everybody in a graded school. 
We are going to have such widespread 
testing that people will be willing to 
come out of their homes and go back to 
work. That is one reason we need the 
testing. 
The second reason we need the test-
ing is because it helps contain the dis-
ease. We know how to stop the spread 
of the disease. If every single one of us 
just stayed in our room, it wouldn’t 
spread. We have come pretty close to 
doing that for the last 5 weeks and 
nearly destroyed our economy in the 
process, but we had to do it. 
The other way to do it is have enough 
tests to identify the people who are 
sick. We don’t know exactly how many 
that is. I would guess—and I am no sci-
entist, but just from the scientists I 
talk to, I am guessing that in Ten-
nessee it is 3, 5, 7 percent of us who 
might have this virus, and maybe half 
of us or some of us have symptoms, and 
the rest of us don’t. But what we need 
to do is identify who those people are 
and quarantine them for 2 weeks or 
help them in the hospital, and then the 
rest of us can go back to school and 
back to work. We can’t do that without 
tens of millions of more tests, even 
though we are testing more people 
than any other country in the world. 
That is what we are talking about, 
and we are so fortunate to have Dr. 
Francis Collins, who headed the Human 
Genome Project, to lead that effort. He 
has been at the National Institutes of 
Health for 27 years. He led it during 
President Obama’s time and during 
President Trump’s time. He has invited 
the best ideas from around the country 
and gotten more than 1,000 proposals. 
We call it a shark tank because there is 
a reality television show where entre-
preneurs fight to see who can win. 
Well, all we need is one or two or three 
winners 
of 
the 
sharks 
swimming 
around 
in 
this 
tank, 
and 
then 
BARDA—our other agency that is in-
volved—can go to work with manufac-
turers and begin to produce tens of mil-
lions of these tests. How quickly? We 
don’t know, and we shouldn’t predict 
things we don’t know, but our goal is 
to produce millions more tests by Au-
gust, when 100,000 public schools want 
to open and 5,000 colleges want to open, 
first, by accelerating all the known 
technologies, and second, by finding 
some mighty white shark in this shark 
tank that produces a new technology. 
There is a lot of talk about antigen 
tests. There is one proposal that would 
have you take just a simple nose 
swab—not the kind of thing that goes 
all the way back into your throat but 
a simple nose swab, maybe even saliva. 
You take a picture of it with your cell 
phone, and if it is positive, it tells you 
and it sends that to your doctor. It is 
that simple. It is as simple as a preg-
nancy test. That would be a screening 
test, and you might need to take a sec-
ond test to confirm it because some of 
these screening tests aren’t 100 per-
cent. 
We had a very good hearing. We 
heard from Dr. Collins. We have ex-
actly the right person. We have good 
cooperation with BARDA, the agency 
that has done so much good work, and 
I am looking forward to the results. 
I would say to my colleagues, we 
have another hearing scheduled. We are 
doing our job of oversight. On next 
Tuesday, Senator MURRAY and I have 
scheduled a hearing on safely back to 
school and back to work. That will fea-
ture Dr. Fauci, who has become some-
thing of a television personality over 
the last 3 or 4 weeks, but he has ap-
peared before our committee many 
times; Dr. Redfield, who is head of the 
Centers for Disease Control; Dr. Hahn, 
who is head of the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, which has to approve the 
safety and effectiveness of all these 
ideas; and Admiral Giroir, who is co-
ordinating testing. 
Dr. Collins also said that we are 
making great strides in treatments and 
in vaccines. Congress has appropriated 
$3 trillion—I see my friend from Okla-
homa here, so I will come to a conclu-
sion so he can have his time—Congress 
has appropriated $3 trillion, but the 
most important money we have appro-
priated goes for tests, treatments, and 
vaccines. 
Dr. Collins is leading the accelerated 
effort with nearly 1,000 proposals now 
that were set up in record time—sort of 
a mini-Manhattan Project—to take the 
brainpower of this country and see if 
we can find a new way to create these 
rapid tests and then work with BARDA 
and manufacturers to produce tens of 
millions of them so we can go back to 
school in August and millions more so 
that we can get ready for the flu sea-
son. 
There are also promising treatments, 
medicines that will be ready by the 
summertime. 
As 
Senator 
KENNEDY 
from Louisiana observed in one of our 
meetings, what bothers most people 
about this disease is that they might 
die from it. There is no medicine to 
treat it. Well, now there is one ap-
proved by the FDA, and there should be 
more by the summer. 
Finally, the administration has set 
as a very aggressive goal the only 
thing that will really put us back to 
anything approaching normal, which is 
a vaccine. Their goal is that we would 
produce 100 million doses by September 
and 300 million by the end of the year, 
which is much more rapid than we have 
ever done before. I have no idea wheth-
er it is possible, but I like the idea of 
the goal. 
So the shark tank for the tests, the 
acceleration of treatments for the sum-
mer, the warp speed vaccination—all in 
a country that has everybody working 
hard on the problem. Yes, there was a 
bump in the CDC tests to start with, 
but today we have tested 7 million peo-
ple—more than any other country. And 
I think it is important for the Amer-
ican people to know that on tests, 
treatments, and vaccines, we are all 
working as hard as we can. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
REMEMBERING THOMAS COBURN 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I rise 
to pause and remember March 28, 2020. 
It is a day that Oklahomans and the 
Nation lost a patriot and a friend to 
many. 
I stand here at this desk that I have 
used for the past 5 years, but before it 
was my desk, it was the desk of Dr. 
Tom Coburn. 
A few days after we gaveled out in 
March, Dr. Coburn took his first breath 
in Heaven, where he was finally cancer- 
free, finally pain-free, and living in the 
presence of Jesus, where there is no

May 7, 2020 
government waste and no inefficiency, 
where there is no conflict, and liberty 
is absolutely eternal. We will miss his 
sage advice, his blunt perspective, and 
his steadfast wisdom. 
Dr. Coburn served in this Chamber 
for 10 years, from 2005 to 2015, but he 
also served in the House of Representa-
tives for 6 years, from 1995 to 2001. The 
one title he carried in both of those 
Chambers was ‘‘Doctor,’’ and that was 
his preferred term. 
Thomas Allen Coburn was born in 
Casper, WY, on March 14, 1948. Dr. 
Coburn graduated from Central High 
School in 1966. In 1968, he married 
Carolyn Denton—by the way, the 1967 
Miss Oklahoma. They had three daugh-
ters and nine grandchildren. 
At Oklahoma State University, Dr. 
Coburn was an honor student and presi-
dent of the student business council. 
He graduated in 1970 with a bachelor’s 
degree in accounting. 
After the family business he worked 
at was sold, he attended medical school 
at the University of Oklahoma and re-
ceived his medical degree with honors 
in 1983. He interned at St. Anthony’s 
Hospital in Oklahoma City. In 1986, he 
founded the Muskogee Family Medi-
cine practice, which is still in oper-
ation today. 
His victory over melanoma as a 
young man inspired him to become a 
physician. He stated he wanted to give 
back because he had been given to. Un-
fortunately, that battle with mela-
noma when he was a young man was 
not his last battle with cancer. 
As a physician, his dedication to his 
patients was inexhaustible. Over his 
career, he delivered 4,000 babies and 
would often see 30 patients a day in his 
office. 
After his election to the House of 
Representatives in 1994, he would fly 
home from Washington, DC, so that he 
could continue to see his patients on 
weekends—a schedule he maintained 
for the entire 6 years he spent in the 
House. He was a doctor all the time. 
It was not uncommon for him to be 
in a conversation with someone, and 
right in the middle of the conversation, 
he would ask them how they were feel-
ing because he had picked up some-
thing 
in 
their 
demeanor 
that 
he 
thought was a little bit wrong. 
Dr. Coburn was a deacon and a Sun-
day school teacher. 
In all the story that I have told you, 
if you are looking for some element of 
politics in the background, you won’t 
find it until 1994. His decision to run 
for Congress in 1994 was a long shot. He 
narrowly won, becoming the first Re-
publican to represent Oklahoma’s Sec-
ond Congressional District in 73 years. 
He went to Congress as a man on a 
mission. He was determined to help 
solve the Nation’s problems. His focus 
was not Oklahoma; it was the Nation. 
I remember asking him privately be-
fore I started serving in the House of 
Representatives how he made a dif-
ference. His answer was that there are 
two people who make a difference in 
Congress—the person who studies and 
the committee chairman. Study more 
than anyone else, know the issue, and 
you can get it done. 
His tenacity on every issue was leg-
endary. POLITICO once summarized it 
well, saying: ‘‘A typical bill moving 
through the Senate has a number of in-
stitutional 
hurdles 
to 
clear: 
sub-
committee, committee, leadership and 
Coburn. It’s that last one that you 
won’t find in a textbook.’’ 
His staff were wholly devoted to the 
cause, not necessarily because of him 
but because of the mission. One of his 
former staffers wrote this after Dr. 
Coburn passed: 
We blocked a lot of bills. We offered a lot 
of amendments. We lost a lot of votes. We 
highlighted a lot of wasteful spending. We 
irked a lot of people. And over time, we 
started changing how business was done. 
Bills that added new spending couldn’t pass 
without offsets. Program duplication became 
part of the lexicon. The practice of ear-
marking went away. People started paying 
attention to government waste. 
Doctor Coburn’s annual ‘‘Wastebook’’ 
became one of the more high-profile re-
ports coming out of Washington each 
year. Over the years, Dr. Coburn and 
his team highlighted trillions in ques-
tionable spending on low-priority items 
that taxpayers were unwittingly pay-
ing for. Any spending that proved to be 
classic Federal wastefulness, duplica-
tive, fraudulent, or purely ineffective, 
likely made the list each year. The 
‘‘Wastebook’’ became an annual ral-
lying cry for taxpayers frustrated by 
Washington’s spending habits. Phrases 
that are common in American political 
conversations today, like ‘‘the bridge 
to nowhere,’’ ‘‘shrimp on a treadmill,’’ 
‘‘term limits,’’ and ‘‘earmarks,’’ were 
all battles that he fought to win. 
In 2010, in a fight over the debt limit 
increase, Dr. Coburn created an annual 
report from the Government Account-
ability Office on government duplica-
tion. It seemed like just another gov-
ernment report, but that report—that 
report that he passed in 2010—has saved 
taxpayers $262 billion dollars so far. 
Dr. Coburn and his team were in the 
fights worth fighting, but they were 
battling on the playing field of ideas 
and policy proposals, not against peo-
ple. In a town that wants to label ev-
erything 
left 
versus 
right, 
liberal 
versus conservative, Dr. Coburn and his 
team didn’t have any criteria to meet 
for those who joined them in the fight; 
they were willing to pull together any 
ally. You didn’t have to agree on every-
thing, but as long as you agreed on a 
couple things in front of you, that is 
what mattered. The friendships that 
were forged in the fight were genuine, 
true, and certainly unique. 
He was the chief sponsor of President 
Obama’s USASpending.gov to increase 
transparency in government spending. 
He was a champion for HIV/AIDS pa-
tients and medical research to save 
lives. He was a tenacious fighter 
against 
Social 
Security 
disability 
fraud, eventually exposing a $1 billion 
Social Security scam in West Virginia 
run by a lawyer named Eric Conn, a 
Kentucky lawyer who filed thousands 
of bogus disability applications. 
He was a master of Senate rules—his 
clay pigeon amendment is legendary in 
Senate procedure. He was one of the 
unlikeliest Members to vote for TARP 
in 2008. It was probably one of the hard-
est votes that he took, but when he 
looked at the facts in front of him, he 
saw that it was the right thing to do. 
That was ultimately what it boiled 
down to—he was willing to do the right 
thing, no matter what the cost. He op-
posed what needed opposition, but he 
would prefer to argue in private to re-
solve an issue rather than in public, al-
though he was clearly not afraid to 
argue in public. 
After years of serving families as 
their physician—a task he continued 
on weekends even when he was in the 
House of Representatives—the Senate 
Ethics 
Committee 
ruled 
that 
Dr. 
Coburn was violating conflict of inter-
est rules by holding an outside job and 
prohibited him from practicing medi-
cine as a Senator. Dr. Coburn then just 
stopped taking payment and did his 
work as a physician pro bono, and the 
Ethics Committee also rejected that 
plan and prohibited him from working 
pro bono, even as a physician. 
Ironically, I am now the chairman of 
Ethics for the Senate. The last time I 
visited with Dr. Coburn at his house in 
February, in the middle of our long, 
great conversation, he said to me: 
Since you are the chairman of Ethics, 
why don’t you get that rule changed 
and allow doctors to still practice med-
icine while they are in the Senate? 
That is wrong. That needs to be fixed. 
Even in the end, he was still working 
to right what was wrong. 
Many people know that when Dr. 
Coburn left the Senate, he spent his 
time trying to fix Congress—still work-
ing on term limits and a balanced 
budget amendment. 
If you have not seen it, you should 
read some of the things his former staff 
wrote about Dr. Coburn after he passed 
away a few weeks ago. Any Senator in 
this Chamber could only wish that our 
staff looked up to us as much as his 
staff looked up to him. 
I thought the best way to honor Dr. 
Coburn today, though, was to remind 
this body of what Dr. Coburn said as he 
walked out of this body—his farewell 
speech. Among the many things he 
said, he challenged the Senate and Sen-
ators by saying this: 
The Senate was designed uniquely to force 
compromise, not to force gridlock—to force 
compromise. One Senator had the power to 
stop everything for the first 100 years but it 
didn’t because compromise was the goal. 
Our Founders understood there were 
many differences between the States in 
size, in geography, economy, and opin-
ions. They united the States as one 
country based upon the premise that 
the many are more powerful than the 
one. As Senators, we have to follow 
this example. 
Then, he said this:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2311 
May 7, 2020 
I’ve not always done that—I admit that 
freely to you. I should have. 
As Senators, we must follow the ex-
ample and stand for our principles, but 
working to find those areas of agree-
ment where compromise can be found 
to unite and move our country forward. 
Not all the powers of the Senators are 
exercised on the Senate floor. Each 
Member of the Senate has a unique role 
to participate and practice oversight 
and to hold the government account-
able. That is part of our duties, except 
most often that is the part of our du-
ties that is most ignored. 
True debates about national prior-
ities would come about if we did effec-
tive oversight. It is the Senate, once 
hailed as the world’s greatest delibera-
tive body, where these differences 
should 
be 
argued. 
Our 
differences 
should be resolved through civil dis-
course so they are not settled in the 
streets. Just as the Constitution pro-
vides for majority rule in our democ-
racy, while protecting the rights of in-
dividuals, the Senate must return to 
principles to bring trust to the elec-
torate, and it can. 
The theme of his whole farewell 
speech centered around this one state-
ment: 
We do not have one problem we cannot 
solve. There is nothing too big for us. They 
are all solvable. 
On this National Day of Prayer, I be-
lieve it is entirely appropriate that we 
pray for Dr. Coburn’s family, friends, 
and former staff, who will miss his 
friendship and his counsel, and so will 
our Nation. 
I pray that Carolyn, their daughters, 
and their families cherish the memo-
ries of a husband, dad, and grandfather. 
Our State and our Nation will be for-
ever grateful for your sacrifice. I pray 
that the task Dr. Coburn began would 
be completed for the sake of our liberty 
and of our future, and I pray that this 
body will take up the challenge he left 
on this floor: to solve the hard prob-
lems we face as a nation together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to add my col-
league, Senator BROWN from Ohio, as a 
cosponsor to S.J. Res. 68. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about President Trump’s veto of 
S.J. Res. 68, a veto that he commu-
nicated to the Senate by a statement 
yesterday afternoon. We debated this 
at length in February. So there is no 
need to spend too much time on the 
substance. 
I was proud of the resolution, cospon-
soring it in a bipartisan way, to assert 
the importance of the Senate. I very 
much appreciated hearing my col-
league from Oklahoma talk about the 
importance of the Senate. The debate 
that we had in February about S.J. 
Res. 68 was about the importance of 
Congress in one of the most important 
responsibilities we have, whether or 
not the Nation would go to war. 
We specified in that resolution that 
except to defend the Nation against at-
tack or imminent attack, the United 
States would not be engaged in war 
with the government of Iran absent a 
congressional vote. It passed this body 
by a healthy bipartisan margin and 
also passed the House by a bipartisan 
margin. The President has vetoed S.J. 
Res. 68, and the next vote at 1:30 will be 
on whether to override the veto. I 
know what the votes will be because we 
have already voted on this once. 
I want to just focus for a minute on 
the President’s veto statement, which I 
think is instructive. When he vetoed 
S.J. Res. 68, this was his primary rea-
son—the first thing he said: 
This was a very insulting resolution intro-
duced by Democrats as part of a strategy to 
win an election on November 3 by dividing 
the Republican Party. The few Republicans 
who voted for it played right into their 
hands. 
What I find so notable about that 
statement is that the President could 
not see Congress expressing an opinion 
about war through any lens other than 
himself and his reelection on November 
3. As everyone in this Chamber knows, 
the bill was not a partisan bill. It was 
introduced with an even number of bi-
partisan Senators. It was not part of a 
strategy to hurt President Trump. I 
have advocated these same positions, 
as have other Members of this body, 
under Presidents who were both Demo-
crat and Republican. The Republican 
Senators and Democratic Senators who 
voted for it and those who voted 
against it had particular views about 
the allocation of constitutional war 
powers, but in no way was this par-
tisan, and in no way was it part of a 
strategy dealing with the November 3 
election. 
For President Trump to look at a 
matter of war and peace and the Con-
stitutional 
obligations 
of 
Congress 
through the lens of the November elec-
tion, frankly, shocked me. 
The President, later in the state-
ment, said: 
The United States is not engaged in the 
use of force against Iran. 
Let’s be clear. The U.S. military en-
gaged in military action that wiped out 
Iran’s top military commander. If any 
other Nation did that to our Secretary 
of Defense or Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, would we call that a use 
of force against the United States? Of 
course we would. As for the strike 
against General Soleimani, you might 
say it was a great thing. The President 
advocated for it. No one is sad that 
General Soleimani does not exist. But 
rather than justifying it as a necessity, 
the President says it was not a use of 
force against Iran. 
The President goes on to say that the 
strike was justified by law, citing arti-
cle II of the Constitution—we had some 
debates about that, obviously—but also 
citing the Iraq war resolution of 2002. I 
have not heard anyone assert that as a 
justification for killing an Iranian 
leader. That resolution, which is now 
essentially dead letter, was designed to 
topple the government of Saddam Hus-
sein, and to use that as a resolution to 
attack members of the Iranian Govern-
ment is a stretch. 
Finally, the President says: 
We live in a hostile world of evolving 
threats, and the Constitution recognizes that 
the President must be able to anticipate our 
adversary’s next moves and take swift and 
decisive action and response. 
He concludes: 
Congress should not have passed this reso-
lution. 
You cannot tell the article I branch 
how to do its job. We can’t tell the ar-
ticle II branch how to do its job. But 
for the President to say it is insulting 
for Congress to take up matters of war 
and peace and that we should not have 
passed the resolution, to me, dem-
onstrates a fundamental 
misunder-
standing of the importance of the arti-
cle I branch. 
We are not an article 21⁄2 branch, and 
we are not required to play ‘‘Mother 
May I’’ with the President. We have 
our own independent responsibilities 
that we swear to uphold. 
S.J. Res. 68, in my view, was a great 
example of coming together in a bipar-
tisan way to uphold those responsibil-
ities. I urge my colleagues to vote to 
override President Trump’s veto of the 
resolution. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are 
here today to ensure the Senate fulfills 
its constitutional duties in having the 
sole power to send U.S. troops to war. 
Article 1, section 8 of the U.S. Con-
stitution is explicit in saying the 
power to declare war is an explicit 
power of the Congress. 
Congress 
overwhelming 
reaffirmed 
this Constitutional provision when it 
passed the War Powers law in 1973 over 
the veto of President Nixon after the 
American people were lied to by both 
political parties about that war. 
Under the law, the President has the 
authority to approve military attacks 
as a response to an imminent threat or 
with the expressed authorization of 
Congress. 
Neither of these was the case with 
President Trump’s decision to kill Ira-
nian General Suleimani in January, a 
decision that led to a horrific missile 
attack on U.S. forces in Iraq and only 
further added to ongoing tensions with 
Iran. 
The majority leader has argued that 
the War Powers law is somehow only 
relevant to thousands of troops being 
deployed to a Vietnam type situation, 
not a military action the President ar-
gues is simply a deterrence. 
Well, that is a dangerous rationale 
argument and exactly what this law 
had in mind, the reckless or creeping 
escalation to war without the author-
ization of Congress. 
In fact, the recent briefing by the ad-
ministration on Iran was filled with

echoes of the Gulf of Tonkin, vague as-
sertions used to justify stunning mili-
tary escalation in Vietnam. 
It raised serious concerns about what 
we are being told about the justifica-
tions for the attack and showed little 
evidence of an imminent threat and 
this from an administration whose 
President has made more than 18,000 
misleading or false statements already. 
Certainly nothing in the briefings of-
fered the Senate convinced me that the 
administration even thinks it needs 
congressional authorization for taking 
escalatory actions. 
That is why I joined Senator KAINE 
in invoking the War Powers Act. This 
Senate should not allow the county to 
led into another Middle East war with-
out its consent. 
And the Constitution is clear on this; 
Article I section 8 states that the 
power to declare war is an explicit 
power of the Congress—as it should be, 
one should never send our sons and 
daughters into war without the consent 
of the people. 
I have made this same argument re-
gardless of who was in the White 
House, Republican or Democrat. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in re-
affirming this body’s constitutional 
role in matters of war by overriding 
the President’s veto. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, in Feb-
ruary, a bipartisan majority of the 
Senate voted to affirm our constitu-
tional authority to declare war and to 
prohibit the President from starting a 
war with Iran. In March, the House of 
Representatives also cast a bipartisan 
vote to affirm that Congress, and Con-
gress alone, has the authority to de-
clare war. 
The President has vetoed that Iran 
War Powers resolution, rebuking the 
will of Congress, the will of the Amer-
ican people, and the directive of the 
U.S. Constitution. 
It is now up to Congress to reassert 
our authority, to override this veto, 
and to make good on the words of arti-
cle 2, section 8 of the Constitution that 
gives Congress the sole power to ‘‘de-
clare War’’—because the last thing we 
need right now, at this time of grave 
crisis for our Nation, is a crisis of our 
own making in the Middle East—a pro-
tracted, unconstitutional conflict with 
Iran. 
Some would like to think that there 
is no chance that this President would 
begin a war with Iran in the middle of 
a global pandemic, a war that would 
kill Americans and Iranians alike. 
Think again. 
On March 11, a barrage of rockets hit 
an airbase north of Baghdad housing 
U.S. troops, and killing two. That day 
marked the birthday of Iran’s General 
Suleimani, who was killed in January 
in an unprovoked attack ordered by 
the President. 
The attack was launched by a Shiite 
military group, whose leader also had 
been killed during the January attack 
on Suleimani. However, the Pentagon 
did not have solid evidence that the at-
tack had been ordered by the Iranian 
Government. 
But the President’s advisers, who 
have supported a maximum pressure 
campaign that has risked military con-
flict with Iran, did not wait for clear- 
cut evidence of Iran’s involvement to 
try to push us closer to war. Senior ad-
visers to the President, including Sec-
retary of State Pompeo, strongly ar-
gued that the U.S. should launch a di-
rect attack upon Iran in retaliation. 
Pentagon 
and 
military 
leaders 
pushed 
back 
against 
Secretary 
Pompeo’s call for military action in-
side Iran, warning that a large-scale re-
sponse within Iran’s borders could draw 
us into a wider war with that country. 
Thankfully, these cooler heads pre-
vailed, and the President ended up or-
dering night airstrikes against the mi-
litia’s outposts inside Iraq to limit the 
possible death toll. 
But, not satisfied with that response, 
Pentagon officials have ordered the 
military to draw up a plan to destroy 
the responsible militia group inside 
Iran. 
However, the top U.S. commander in 
Iraq, LTG Robert P. White, has reacted 
strongly to that directive, warning 
that any such campaign could be 
bloody and counterproductive and risk 
war with Iran. He warned any such es-
calation would require thousands more 
American troops be sent to Iraq. 
So, since March, at least twice, high 
level Pentagon and military officials 
have warned that Trump administra-
tion officials’ plans risk war with Iran. 
And, most recently, President Trump 
tweeted out an order to rewrite the 
rules of engagement at sea to attack 
harassing Iranian ships. While we con-
demn such harassing conduct, this is 
conduct the U.S. and other nations 
have determined is not worth a wide-
spread war. 
With the advisers that the President 
surrounds himself with, like Secretary 
Pompeo and Special Advisor Brian 
Hook, the chilling fact is we are never 
far from war with Iran. The threat is 
ever-present, even as coronavirus rav-
ages our country and spreads within 
the military and even when all re-
sources of the Federal Government 
should be singularly focused on fight-
ing this pandemic, keeping Americans 
safe, and keeping our economy going. 
So since we are still at risk of war 
with Iran in the middle of this public 
health and economic crisis, it is more 
imperative than ever that we override 
the President’s veto and pass the Iran 
War Powers resolution once and for all. 
At this point in time, it would expo-
nentially worsen the current disaster if 
we were to bungle our way into another 
Middle Eastern war with Iran. 
The American people don’t want war 
with Iran. They didn’t want it before 
this terrible virus hit, and they cer-
tainly don’t want it now while we are 
in the throes of this pandemic. 
But 
Secretary 
Pompeo 
and 
his 
hawkish allies in the administration 
cannot be counted on to represent the 
will of the American people. 
That is why we are here. And that is 
why the Framers of the Constitution 
vested the authority to go to war with 
the legislative branch and not the exec-
utive branch. They placed the author-
ity to go to war squarely with the peo-
ple’s representatives. 
At this point in time, all national re-
sources must be directed toward the 
public health and economic crisis fac-
ing our Nation. Now is the time to send 
a message to this President and those 
in his administration who seem to be 
always itching to escalate the conflict, 
that initiating war against Iran is not 
this President’s or any President’s 
choice to make. 
Mr. KAINE. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is 
one of the rare places where you can be 
in an institution with someone you 
dearly love and yet disagree with so 
strongly. That is the relationship that 
we have. I have a lot of respect for my 
friend from Virginia, but I think this 
has been twisted around in a way to 
make the President look bad. In his 
heart, he knew what he was doing at 
the time. 
You know, we have to keep in mind— 
and I would even suggest—that this is 
probably the boldest defense policy de-
cision of his Presidency to date. He au-
thorized an airstrike against the leader 
of Iran’s Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, 
in accordance with, I still believe, his 
privilege and responsibilities under ar-
ticle II of the Constitution. 
Now, let’s remember who Soleimani 
was. It has been awhile now and a lot 
has happened since then, but he was a 
terrorist. He was responsible for the 
training and funding of militias across 
the Middle East, the very militias that 
had targeted American personnel, fa-
cilities, and partners for decades. He 
was a monster—nothing less. 
Some people out there want to be-
lieve that his action was a rush to war. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth. Instead, looking at the facts, 
they pushed ahead with the War Pow-
ers Resolution, and instead of making 
war less likely, it made it more likely. 
Let me tell you how. 
The resolution was shortsighted and 
dangerous in February, but the 4 
months since then have only confirmed 
that it was not necessary. We are clear-
ly not at war. Not only that, but an 
airstrike is not war. Defending Amer-
ican lives is not war. The President has 
made it clear that he doesn’t desire 
war. We all know that. Nobody here 
wants war. 
At the same time, nobody should 
want a policy that would leave Ameri-
cans vulnerable to the whims of Iran’s 
terrorist-supporting regime. If we do 
that, if we tie the President’s hands so 
that he cannot defend American lives, 
we leave ourselves more vulnerable 
and, therefore, make war infinitely 
more likely, and accordingly, we must 
all vote to sustain the President’s veto. 
I yield the floor.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to highlight the heroes of my 
home State of Maryland who are work-
ing on the frontlines to fight COVID– 
19. 
On January 21, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention announced 
the first confirmed case of COVID–19 in 
the United States. Since then, the 
number of confirmed COVID–19 cases in 
the United States has ballooned to over 
1.2 million cases and over 72,000 Ameri-
cans have died. 
The CDC has designated the Balti-
more-Washington 
corridor 
as 
a 
hotspot, as cases continue to rise in 
the region. As of May 6, there have 
been 28,163 confirmed cases of COVID– 
19 and 1,290 confirmed deaths in the 
State of Maryland. These are trying, 
unprecedented times for all commu-
nities in America, and Maryland is no 
different in this regard. 
Fred Rogers once said that in times 
of crisis, times like these, we should 
‘‘look for the helpers.’’ I would like to 
take this time to recognize some of the 
heroes who are helping communities in 
Maryland. 
I am very proud of our State’s hos-
pitals, distilleries, manufacturers, and 
biomedical and pharmaceutical compa-
nies that have come together to per-
form their own testing, manufactured 
personal 
protective 
equipment 
and 
hand sanitizers, and are at the fore-
front of developing a vaccine. 
Maryland is home to some of the 
world’s premier academic medical sys-
tems, 
including 
the 
University 
of 
Maryland Medical System and Johns 
Hopkins University, which have been 
critical in preparing our State for the 
pandemic. 
I am particularly proud of Johns 
Hopkins’ coronavirus tracking system, 
which public health officials worldwide 
have come to rely on for up-to-date, ac-
curate information. I applaud Johns

Hopkins officials and staff creating the 
vital public health tool, which has al-
ready proven itself critical to fighting 
this disease. 
Lord Kelvin stated so long ago: 
When you can measure what you are 
speaking about, and express it in numbers, 
you know something about it; but when you 
cannot measure it, when you cannot express 
it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre 
and unsatisfactory kind. 
In the early days of the pandemic in 
Maryland, our State officials, like offi-
cials in most States, were desperately 
searching for ways to increase testing 
capacity. Johns Hopkins developed its 
own coronavirus test to help meet de-
mand. 
The university has been especially 
helpful in Maryland’s effort to combat 
the virus in nursing homes. Johns Hop-
kins has closely collaborated with 
local nursing homes to train their em-
ployees and test residents to protect 
our most vulnerable populations. 
I commend Johns Hopkins’ inge-
nuity, which has been critical to ef-
forts to identify those afflicted with 
COVID–19 and to prevent the spread of 
the virus. 
The University of Maryland Medical 
System has stepped up to lead efforts 
to address the devastating impact of 
COVID–19 in our State’s minority com-
munities, which is likely due to the un-
derlying healthcare disparities. The 
university has assembled a team of 
public health experts to execute the 
proposed 
Maryland 
Health 
Equity 
COVID–19 Consortium. The consortium 
will be critical to the developing of 
strategies that inform our State’s re-
sponse efforts to protect our commu-
nities of color, who are more suscep-
tible to COVID–19. 
Despite the immense burden Mary-
land’s small businesses are facing, they 
have stepped up to help local hospitals, 
nursing homes, and other frontline 
workers. 
Sagamore Spirits Distillery in Balti-
more is one such small business. Saga-
more has completely converted its op-
eration to distill corn ethanol to 
produce hand sanitizers. The distillery 
is sourcing its corn from Maryland 
farmers. 
Hardwire, an armor company on the 
Eastern Shore in Pocomoke City, now 
produces sustainable face shields that 
can last up to 6 months. By the end of 
this week, Hardwire will have shipped 
out 1 million face shields to healthcare 
workers, first responders, and others 
on the frontline in the fight against 
COVID–19. The demand for Hardwire’s 
face shield is so great that it has hired 
115 new employees, providing much 
needed economic relief to communities 
on the Eastern Shore. 
In addition, Maryland’s world-leading 
biomedical and pharmaceutical compa-
nies are working tirelessly to find a 
vaccine for COVID–19. 
AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical and 
life sciences company with research 
and development facilities in Gaithers-
burg and Frederick, has partnered with 
the University of Oxford on a potential 
vaccine that has already entered phase 
1 clinical trials. 
Emergent BioSolutions in Rockville 
is collaborating with Johnson & John-
son on its lead COVID–19 vaccine can-
didate. Emergent BioSolutions will be 
providing contract development and 
manufacturing services in Maryland to 
support Johnson & Johnson’s recently 
announced commitment to supply 1 bil-
lion vaccines worldwide. 
I would be remiss if I did not also 
thank Maryland’s frontline healthcare 
workers who risk their lives every day 
to care for those with COVID–19. These 
physicians, 
physician 
assistants, 
nurses, 
lab 
technicians, 
EMT 
per-
sonnel, and many others go to work 
day after day facing the unimaginable 
strain of caring for patients who are 
fighting this deadly virus and com-
forting their families. 
These examples are by no means ex-
haustive. There are countless other 
healthcare providers, law enforcement 
agencies, nonprofits, small businesses, 
higher education institutions, and indi-
vidual Marylanders pitching in to de-
feat COVID–19. 
Marylanders are stocking grocery 
shelves, driving buses, delivering gro-
ceries to elderly neighbors, hosting vir-
tual events to keep families and young 
children entertained as they continue 
to practice social distancing, and they 
are making homemade face coverings 
for those who need them. I have seen 
my neighbors come together to make 
lunch packs for families in need. 
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., said, ‘‘Everybody can be 
great because anybody can serve.’’ The 
COVID–19 pandemic is not testing our 
character; it is revealing it. I am so 
proud to represent all the great Mary-
landers 
who 
are 
serving 
on 
the 
frontlines, and I will continue working 
as hard as I can to ensure that we in 
Congress are doing everything we can 
to support them as they lead the fight 
against COVID–19. 
I yield the floor.

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3608 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, $3 tril-
lion. As best I can tell, that is how 
much money the Congress has appro-
priated—let me amend that. That is 
how much taxpayer money Congress 
has 
appropriated 
to 
fight 
the 
coronavirus and its aftermath—$3 tril-
lion. That is 12 zeros. Three trillion 
dollars is 3,000 billion dollars. 
These numbers take my breath away. 
We spent this money even though we 
don’t have it. We don’t even have 5 per-
cent of it. We borrowed every penny. 
Our national debt will now be approxi-
mating, maybe exceeding $25 trillion. 
The last coronavirus bill that we 
passed, as you know, was the CARES 
Act, but it was not the only bill. We 
have passed a number of pieces of legis-
lation to try to fight this virus and the 
COVID–19 that it causes, and those 
bills were very hard for me to vote for, 
not because I don’t care about the 
American people—I do, of course; we 
all do—but because of the fact that this 
is such a staggering amount of money. 
I have spent my career in govern-
ment—more at the State government 
level than the Federal Government 
level—I have spent my career in gov-
ernment being cheap when it comes to 
taxpayer money, and it bothers me, as 
it should bother all of us, that we spent 
money we don’t have. 
I have driven all over Washington, 
DC, and I can’t find the money tree. 
These are taxpayer dollars. But I voted 
for the bills, including but not limited 
to the CARES Act, because it was clear 
we had to do something. We had to ap-
propriate money to fight the virus. We 
had to appropriate money to help peo-
ple and their businesses to recover eco-
nomically from the impact of the 
virus. 
We don’t know what works in the 
CARES Act and what doesn’t work, and 
we won’t know for a while. I suspect we 
will look back and say: Well, this 
measure was a pretty smart thing to 
do—and with hindsight, but this meas-
ure fell a little bit short. 
But already many of my colleagues, 
and I say this with respect, have other 
bills to spend even more money, pri-
marily to help State and local govern-
ment. It is like a Labor Day mattress 
sale around here, the number of bills 
flying around. Someone wants to spend 
another $250 billion. Somebody else 
wants to spend $500 billion and give it 
to State and local government. Speak-
er PELOSI wants to spend $1 trillion. I 
think all that is premature. I suggest 
that we pause once again, we see what 
works, we see what has worked, and see 
what hasn’t worked. 
Also, it would seem to me that any 
fair-minded person would have to con-
clude that we should open up. Once we 
open up government and see the eco-
nomic impact, we will have additional 
information. And make no mistake 
about it—we are going to have to open 
up the economy again. I don’t see any 
reason why we can’t both save lives 
and save jobs. 
But I want to make it clear that 
every single one of these 3 trillion dol-
lars, as far as I am concerned, is a pre-
cious commodity because they come 
from taxpayers. 
The discussion that many of my col-
leagues have been having about spend-
ing additional money on top of the $3 
trillion specifically for State and local 
government seems to forget that we 
have already appropriated an enormous 
amount of money to State and local 
government. 
In my State, for example—I will just 
take Louisiana—I think, as a result of 
the CARES Act, we are going to re-
ceive about $31⁄2 billion, and I am very 
grateful for every single penny. This 
Congress appropriated $287 million for 
public schools in Louisiana, $190 mil-
lion for universities, $623 million for

hospitals. We have received extra Med-
icaid 
payments. 
Additionally, 
Louisianans have received $1.803 billion 
for State and local government. You 
add it all up, and that is about $31⁄2 bil-
lion that has already been appropriated 
just to Louisiana. Some States got 
more; some States got less. 
So the point I am trying to make is 
that we need to recognize the fact that 
we have already done a lot for State 
government, and we have already done 
a lot for our cities. And I happily voted 
for the bill. I had some reluctance for 
reasons I have explained—just the 
breathtaking amount of money. 
This doesn’t mean that our State and 
local governments are not going to 
have to sacrifice. We have certainly 
asked the American people to sacrifice, 
and we have certainly asked the Amer-
ican business community to sacrifice, 
and I think State government and local 
government are going to have to share 
in that sacrifice. They are going to 
have to scrub their budgets, and that is 
just a fact. 
As far as I am concerned, the Federal 
Government needs to do the same 
thing. There is not a single Member of 
this body who believes every single 
penny we spend in the Federal budget 
is absolutely necessary. 
I have a bill that I think may well 
make it unnecessary to appropriate 
new money for our State and local gov-
ernments. I have a bill that I think 
may well moot the entire issue. 
We made one mistake—we probably 
made others, but in my judgment, I 
know we made one in the CARES Act 
when 
we 
put 
restrictions 
on 
the 
amount of money we gave to State and 
local government. Now, I understand 
why we did it, and at the time, I sup-
ported it. We do not want to bail out 
States, for example, that have been 
mismanaged. If a State decides to give 
generous retirement benefits at an 
early retirement age to its State em-
ployees, as far as I am concerned, that 
is that State’s business, but also, as far 
as I am concerned, the people of Lou-
isiana shouldn’t have to pay for that— 
what, in my opinion, is mismanage-
ment—and I think a number of my col-
leagues in the Senate share that senti-
ment. 
But in hindsight—I will take Lou-
isiana as an example. We received $1.8 
billion. There is a requirement in the 
legislation that says that $1.8 billion 
can only be used to defray the expenses 
of coronavirus expended by the State of 
Louisiana and by our cities. That is 
what the statute says. It is the statute 
passed by Congress that controls. 
I am not sure what the Treasury De-
partment issued, but they issued some-
thing—they didn’t go through the 
APA—that says: Well, the States—Lou-
isiana, for example, has great flexi-
bility to spend that $1.8 billion that we 
received in Louisiana that went to 
State and local government. They can 
spend it on first responders and police-
men and school teachers. I appreciate 
the Department of Treasury issuing 
whatever it was they issued. I think 
they called it a directive. 
There is just one problem: The stat-
ute doesn’t say that, and the U.S. 
Treasury does not have the authority— 
nor should it—to change a bill passed 
by the Congress. 
So 
I 
am 
grateful 
to 
Secretary 
Mnuchin for trying to help here, but I 
don’t believe what he is doing is legal, 
and it gives me great pause that State 
government and our cities might act 
on a directive from the Treasury that 
could change 2 weeks from now. I think 
the only way to address this issue is 
through a statute passed by Congress. 
Here is what my bill would do. My 
bill would not appropriate any new 
money. Let me say that again. My bill 
would not appropriate any new money. 
My bill would say that, with respect to 
the $150 billion that this Congress— 
unanimously, in the Senate—has al-
ready appropriated to help State gov-
ernments 
and 
local 
governments, 
which is the $1.8 billion that I am refer-
ring to that Louisiana received, they 
can use that money for operating ex-
penses. 
They can’t use it—my bill would spe-
cifically prohibit it—to bail out mis-
managed retirement systems. They 
can’t use it to bail out any retirement 
systems, mismanaged or otherwise, but 
they can use that money, with this 
small change to the CARES Act, to fill 
the holes in their budget as a result of 
any revenue shortfalls. 
In my State, for example, we are very 
heavily reliant on the sales tax and on 
the personal income tax. I think this 
measure may well moot the issue of 
having 
to 
appropriate 
brand 
new 
money for States and local govern-
ments. The Governors I talked to tell 
me: Kennedy, look, we really appre-
ciate the money you sent State and 
local governments. There is just one 
problem. Our hands are tied. Our prob-
lem today is not enough money to fight 
the virus. Our problem today is, How 
do we fill a hole as a result of the 
shortfalls in our sales tax? 
That is what my bill would do. 
For that reason, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Appro-
priations be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 3608—that is my 
bill—and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I further ask 
that the Kennedy substitute amend-
ment at the desk be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read for a third time and 
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I clearly 
appreciate my colleague’s remarks. 
State, local, and Tribal governments 
across our great country are working 
tirelessly during this difficult time and 
have received Federal funding through 
the CARES Act, specifically directed 
to aid in their efforts to keep families 
safe. 
While I understand the spirit of my 
colleague’s proposal, I am very con-
cerned that removing the important 
limitations related to the appropriate 
uses of the Coronavirus Relief Fund in 
the CARES Act would siphon resources 
away from the coronavirus response ef-
forts that desperately need these re-
sources. 
Further, I am unfortunately hearing 
that some States and localities would 
simply like to use Federal dollars to 
backfill their decades of fiscal mis-
management. Hard-working American 
taxpayers should not be on the hook to 
bail out poorly run States or to fund 
areas of State budget expenses that 
have nothing to do with coronavirus. 
We see States like California, Illi-
nois, and New York with big budgets, 
high taxes, and tons of debt. Contrast 
that with States like Florida, where we 
made the hard fiscal decisions to pay 
off debt and live within our means. Flo-
ridians should not be punished and 
forced to backfill the budgets of these 
States. 
I have a chart here that shows what 
has happened as a result—I just picked 
out three States—of their fiscal mis-
management. From 1985 to 2018, you 
can see here that Florida gained sig-
nificant population while these poorly 
managed States lost population. You 
can see that in Florida we watched our 
budget and didn’t keep borrowing more 
money. We lived within our means. 
You can look at our debt—$27 billion. 
When you look at California, it is $155 
billion; New York, $148 billion, and Illi-
nois, $67 billion. 
You see what people are doing. They 
are leaving these high-tax States. Look 
at the personal income taxes and look 
at their attitude toward business. 
These are the three worst States for 
business. The Tax Foundation shows 
how poorly they do with their tax pol-
icy. 
If you look at what has happened, 
people have left these States and 
moved their income to Florida and 
other lower tax States and more busi-
ness-oriented States. I am completely 
opposed to bailing out these States. 
Now, the difficulty in my colleague’s 
proposal is that it is very difficult how 
you decide what is going to be used for 
one expense in a State budget or an-
other expense in a State budget. Let’s 
not forget that this year’s Federal 
budget deficit will be the largest in the 
history of our Nation—the largest in 
the history of our Nation—in excess of 
the cumulative deficits for the first 200 
years of our country’s existence. 
As my colleague said, we will end the 
year with an excess of $25 trillion 
worth of Federal debt. More than ever, 
I think my colleague will agree with 
me that we have to be focused and very 
careful with our taxpayer dollars. 
I am very supportive of continuing to 
get needed resources to the commu-
nities and first responders in need.

That is why, when the Senate passed 
the CARES Act, we wisely placed limi-
tations on how this money could be 
spent. We need to maintain those 
guardrails to ensure that the country 
can continue on a path to recovery. 
For these reasons, Mr. President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Alaska. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO KYLE HOPKINS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, as we 
all know, it has been an extraor-
dinarily challenging time for our great 
Nation, a time that has been painful 
for so many of our fellow Americans. 
It has also been a time when people 
across the country have given so much 
to their communities, to their States, 
and to their neighbors. And, as you 
know, we are a great nation. We are a 
kind nation. We are a proud nation, 
and we are a resilient Nation. 
This pandemic has been testing the 
character of our country, and I believe 
that we are passing the test as Ameri-
cans. I believe that because I see it ev-
erywhere. I certainly see it in my 
State, the great State of Alaska. Peo-
ple are passing out food, doing what 
they can for the elderly, tending to 
those in need. We are seeing this all 
across our Nation. 
We see millions of our fellow citi-
zens—people whom we all have the 
privilege of representing here in the 
Senate—stepping up with purpose and 
resolve. We see a greater appreciation 
for the dignity and the value of our 
workers who are on the frontlines of 
helping us get through this pandemic. 
I was recently home in my State. The 
rule in Alaska is if you travel from the 
outside, when you get to Alaska, you 
have a very strict 14-day quarantine. I 
was quarantined with my wife and 
three daughters, hunkered down in An-
chorage. 
Yet I was also able to still appreciate 
what was happening with so many of 
our fellow citizens, especially frontline 
workers who are helping Alaska power 
through this crisis. So many of them 
are working day in and day out to en-
sure 
that 
our 
grocery 
stores 
are 
stocked, that the goods are trans-
ported, that buildings are maintained, 
that our telecommunication systems 
are running, that our airplanes are fly-
ing, that our hospitals are open, that 
our healthcare workers can give care, 
and that our extraordinary teachers 
are finding creative ways to teach our 
kids. The list goes on and on. It is hap-
pening in every State across the Na-
tion. 
Last week, I decided to give an im-
promptu Alaskan of the Week speech in 
my backyard. It wasn’t here on the 
Senate floor the way we usually do it 
and the way we are doing it today. I 
was highlighting these workers. Many 
of them are part of the Teamsters 
Local 
959, 
led 
by 
third-generation 
teamster Gary Dixon. I want to say 
thank you to them again. 
We talk a lot about people who are 
telecommuting. That is great. It is im-
portant to get us through this pan-
demic, but we also know there are a lot 
of people who can’t do that. They are 
really our national heroes right now— 
essential workers on the frontlines, 
keeping our economies and our supply 
lines open, moving, robust. 
Now that I am back in DC and the 
Senate is open again—finally, open 
again—and the business of the Senate 
is continuing, so does our Alaskan of 
the Week series from the floor of the 
Senate. It is one of my favorite times 
of the week, when I get to focus on a 
special Alaskan or a group of Alaskans 
who made Alaska such a great and 
unique place. I think the Presiding Of-
ficer likes it a lot, too. 
I had intended, as I mentioned, on 
my Alaskan of the Week speech here 
coming back, to focus on more of these 
frontline workers who are doing so 
much in our States and so much in our 
country to get us through this pan-
demic. However, some really inter-
esting and, I think, exciting news, 
broke on Monday in our State, as big 
news born of a tragic situation. And for 
that reason, I thought we would have a 
different focus on our Alaskan of the 
Week. 
The Alaskan of the Week this week is 
an intrepid Alaska reporter, Kyle Hop-
kins, who led coverage in our local 
paper, the Anchorage Daily News, that 
earned him the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for 
public service. It is probably the most 
prestigious award in all American jour-
nalism—the prize of prizes. 
Kyle Hopkins, an Alaska reporter, 
won that on Monday. He won it for a 
17-story series called ‘‘Lawless,’’ about 
the public safety crisis of rural Alaska 
and the horrendous issue of sexual as-
sault and domestic violence in our 
State. 
As we all know, we are confronting a 
pandemic in our country. I live in a 
great State, but we have a lot of social 
challenges, just like a lot of States. We 
are confronting this pandemic right 
now nationally. My State has been con-
fronting an epidemic of domestic vio-
lence and sexual abuse that has been 
going on for years—decades, genera-
tions. 
Kyle’s series combined dogged report-
ing and meticulous fact-checking with 
the utmost sensitivity that a subject 
like this requires, which is not an easy 
task at all. It was, according to the 
Pulitzer committee, riveting public 
service reporting. It was so much more 
than that. I will tell you that it was 
very, very important to the State of 
Alaska. 
Let me tell you a little bit about our 
Alaskan of the Week, Kyle Hopkins, 
and what made him very qualified to 
write this series and why it had such 
an impact. And I believe—maybe, I 
should say I hope—it is beginning to 
bring changes to our public safety sys-
tem and, most importantly, to the un-
fortunate culture that we have in our 
State that spawns this kind of abuse 
and violence. 
Kyle was born in beautiful Sitka, AK. 
That is in Southeast Alaska. His father 
was a teacher who came from Cali-
fornia to teach the children of logging 
camp workers at a time when the 
southeast part of our State had a very 
vital 
timber 
industry. 
The 
family 
moved back to California after a few 
years, but then back to Alaska again, 
and then away and then back again. 
Sitka, 
Kake, 
Skagway—two 
small 
towns, one village—are all in Alaska’s 
beautifully gorgeous southeast. For 
Kyle, the towns provided the backdrop 
of a magical childhood—spruce trees 
that seemed to rise to the clouds, 
aquatic universes and tidal basins, fish 
to catch, towering totem poles. High 
school was all about basketball for 
him, as it is for so many Alaskan high 
schoolers and kids. Traveling for tour-
naments in Alaska is a unique experi-
ence, requiring trips on small bush 
planes. 
Kyle remembered seeing the planes 
and the ferries: ‘‘I remember thinking I 
was lucky to see and do these things.’’ 
He knew that even as a young man. He 
went to the University of Alaska Fair-
banks for college, searching for a sub-
ject that allowed him to read a lot. He 
had an adviser that recommended a 
journalism class. Well, the rest, you 
could say, is history. 
During college, he had a host of in-
ternships across the State in jour-
nalism, 
covering 
business, 
politics, 
sports, and crime—all the usual beats— 
and with some of our best journalism 
and media establishments, like the 
Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, before 
moving to Anchorage to work for the 
Anchorage Press, a weekly paper; then, 
to KTUU, Channel 2, our big TV station 
in Alaska; and, then, to where he is 
now, the Anchorage Daily News. 
Throughout all of his reporting, a few 
things constantly struck him. One is 
that we are a very big State, but also 
how few people even in Alaska had ever 
been to a village in our State. They 
didn’t know the challenges and the 
beauty of what we call rural Alaska, 
the soul of Alaska. More than 200 vil-
lages dot our State, most of which are 
not connected by any roads or infra-
structure. 
He was always struck and increas-
ingly disturbed by the challenge that I 
mentioned at the outset of my re-
marks—these very high rates of sexual 
violence that we have in Alaska. De-
pending on how you measure it, it is at 
least three times the national aver-
age—three times the national average. 
Just like so many of us in Alaska, he 
assumed that someday the adults, the 
people in charge, would do something 
about it, until he realized at a certain 
point in his life that he was an adult 
and he had two children, two girls, 
with his wife Rebecca Palsha, another 
intrepid reporter in Alaska, and he 
wanted to make Alaska a better place

not only for his girls but for all other 
children across our State, a State that 
he knows and loves. 
So the time was right to tackle this 
issue, and the time was right for an-
other reason throughout the State. 
There was a more open discussion 
about this dark issue, this black mark 
on Alaska, the issue of sexual assault. 
Brave women had started coming for-
ward to tell their stories. A statewide 
initiative that I was part of called 
Choose Respect was launched over a 
decade ago trying to address cultural 
changes and then the ‘‘Me Too’’ move-
ment came, and more and more people 
were beginning to share their stories of 
trauma and abuse and to have the 
courage to do it—because it takes cour-
age. 
Kyle not only captured many of 
those voices, he also began to dig into 
the larger issues of generational trau-
ma and an issue that is so important in 
our State, the lack of law enforcement 
in many of these places, in so many 
small villages across Alaska. He did it 
all the while by capturing the complex-
ities of a multitiered public safety sys-
tem 
in 
Alaska. 
Working 
with 
ProPublica, he traveled throughout the 
State, dug through reams of docu-
ments, talked to dozens and dozens of 
survivors, perpetrators, police officers, 
lawyers, you name it. 
Let me try to capture the breadth 
and depth and heartache of his 17-part 
series told by just a few headlines. 
These are some of the headlines of the 
stories in the Anchorage Daily News: 
one, ‘‘Discussing Alaska’s history of 
sexual violence is one step toward 
seeking solutions;’’ another headline, 
‘‘Lawless: One in three Alaska villages 
have no local police;’’ another head-
line, ‘‘Dozens of convicted criminals 
have been hired as cops in rural Alas-
ka. Sometimes, they’re the only appli-
cants;’’ another headline: ‘‘She leapt 
from a van on the Kenai Peninsula to 
escape her rapist. Then she waited 18 
years for an arrest.’’ You get the pic-
ture. 
Let me summarize the opening to one 
of the stories, a first-person piece head-
lined, ‘‘Why we’re investigating sexual 
violence in Alaska,’’ and it tells Alas-
kans why this series is delving into 
this very, very difficult topic. It is a 
story—a 
horrible 
story—of 
a 
very 
young girl in one of our villages who 
vanished from the playground, found 
later sexually abused, murdered, and it 
rips your heart out. 
These are the kinds of stories that I 
have certainly heard about and tried to 
address in my time in public service in 
Alaska. These are the stories that 
haunt us as Alaskans. They have 
haunted countless Alaskans: of course, 
survivors, victims, their families, lead-
ers, good citizens, good people. They 
are difficult and shocking stories to 
tell, but they need to be told, they 
must be told, and that is what Kyle 
Hopkins did, and that is why he earned 
the Pulitzer Prize. These are the kinds 
of stories that Attorney General Barr 
confronted when he came to Alaska 
last May, his first trip to any State in 
the country after he was confirmed as 
our new Attorney General. 
Before his confirmation hearing, Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI and I had both invited 
him to come to Alaska. We talked to 
him in detail about these challenges, 
and then we did something that I think 
mattered, and, again, it gives a sense of 
why this series was so important. We 
started sending the Attorney General 
some of Kyle Hopkins’ stories of this 
17-part series, the ones that he had 
written at this time. 
So the Attorney General knew before 
he even got here some of the challenges 
because of this reporting. Attorney 
General Barr actually came to our 
State for almost 5 days—a long visit— 
to hear from survivors, law enforce-
ment, lawyers, meeting dozens of Alas-
kans throughout the State who have 
worked on these issues—some without 
a voice, without help from the Federal 
Government, many Tribal members. It 
was a really important trip. 
He was given a beautiful kuspuk as a 
gift, and when he left, he took a piece 
of Alaska with him in his heart. I am 
convinced of that. As a matter of fact, 
I talked to him about Alaska yesterday 
on the phone and this very series. He 
still wears the kuspuk, by the way. He 
says it makes him look trim. 
Shortly after returning to DC, he 
began to focus with the Department of 
Justice on some of these big issues, de-
claring a public safety emergency in 
rural Alaska and starting to free up 
significant resources to improve public 
safety in our State’s rural commu-
nities. 
So the funding helps, and it is al-
ready being put to good use, but this is 
a story not just about money. As a 
matter of fact, that is not even the im-
portant issue. The important issue is 
culture. We desperately need a cultural 
change on these issues in Alaska that 
have been going on for way too long, 
and that is another reason why Kyle’s 
work is so important, because you 
can’t change the culture if you don’t 
know how broken it is. 
Will it work? Does he think things 
will change? ‘‘I wouldn’t presume to 
know,’’ he said, when my team caught 
up with him on Tuesday, a day after 
the Pulitzer Prize was announced, al-
ready hard at work on another story, 
by the way. 
‘‘I hope things change,’’ he said. 
‘‘That’s one of the goals of the series 
. . . But if nothing changes, at least 
people will know about the injustice in 
our system . . . and if it’s going to con-
tinue, if we’re going to allow this to 
continue, it should be with our knowl-
edge.’’ That is his quote. 
‘‘This is my place,’’ Kyle added, talk-
ing about Alaska. ‘‘It’s an awesome 
place and I don’t want to live anyplace 
else. But things are wrong. And it 
shouldn’t be for the next generation, 
for my girls and other girls. If there’s 
something we can do about it, we 
should do it.’’ That is his quote. 
And of course, he is right. We should 
do it, and many of us in Alaska—real-
ly, thousands of us in Alaska—are com-
mitted to this cause and have been 
committed to the cause for a long 
time. I believe Kyle’s work is going to 
help a lot in that regard. 
I want to thank the Anchorage Daily 
News for supporting this series, to all 
the staff who worked on the series, to

the Pulitzer committee for recognizing 
the importance of this series, and 
thank you, Kyle, for your hard work

Congratulations, again, on winning 
the Pulitzer Prize, and probably even 
more prestigious than winning the Pul-

gratulations on being our Alaskan of

I yield the floor.

WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, free-
dom of the press is a fundamental 
human right, a foundational pillar of 
democracy, and an indispensable check 
on authoritarian overreach. Over the 
past months, as we have collectively 
come to appreciate a new under-
standing of ‘‘essential workers,’’ we 
have witnessed once again how essen-
tial the work journalists do is to main-
taining our democracy. From Wuhan, 
China, to conflict zones in Venezuela, 
to cities and towns in the United 
States, journalists are risking their 
lives to report, investigate, and keep 
people informed on the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Unfortunately, responses to this 
global crisis have also reminds us that 
press freedom is under assault across 
the globe, including in the United 
States. Fearful of negative coverage of 
their capacity to protect their citizens 
and address a global health crisis, 
autocrats and other governmental fig-
ures around the world have focused 
their attention on concealing informa-
tion. As journalists fight to advance 
truth and objectivity under dire cir-
cumstances, far too many governments 
have responded with verbal attacks and 
prison sentences. Today, we applaud 
the work and the courage of all those 
involved 
in 
bringing 
stories 
from 
around the world to our fingertips. 
Amidst the backdrop of the COVID–19 
pandemic, countries across the world 
from Algeria to Zimbabwe have im-
posed restrictions and threatened jour-
nalists for their work. As they do when 
credible, reliable, and timely informa-
tion is an essential commodity, jour-
nalists have persisted. 
In China, in an effort to educate his 
community and the world about its po-
tential 
threat, 
Chen 
Qiushi 
docu-
mented the impacts of the COVID–19 
outbreak in Wuhan, China, in dozens of 
videos online. On February 6, 2020, 
Chen’s family and friends lost contact 
with him, and he is presumed to have 
been disappeared by the CCP. 
In Niger, journalist Kaka Touda 
Mamne Goni reported on a suspected 
COVID–19 case, was arrested by police 
on March 5, 2020, and faces up to 3 
years in prison on charges of ‘‘dissemi-
nation of data likely to disturb the 
public order.’’ 
In Venezuela, a group of masked po-
lice agents detained freelance jour-
nalist Darvinson Rojas on March 21, 
2020, and interrogated Rojas about his 
reporting on COVID–19 cases in the 
state of Miranda. Rojas remains in de-
tention. 
While the COVID–19 pandemic has 
spurred new restrictions and harass-
ment, these stories of abuse and resil-
ience are nothing new in the field of 
journalism. Since 1992, the Committee 
to Project Journalists has reported 
1,369 journalists killed around the 
world, including at least 25 killed in 
2019. Last year also represented the 
14th year in a row that Freedom House 
has noted a global decline in press free-
dom. As of April 20, 2020, at least 299 
journalists were imprisoned for their 
work worldwide. 
Of course, the global decline in press 
freedom and access is not limited to 
foreign lands. In the United States, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has accelerated 
the struggle of local news organiza-
tions to stay afloat. The shuttering of 
local print publications has left rural 
populations and marginalized commu-
nities without critical sources of infor-
mation and has chipped away at the 
foundation of the U.S. free press. 
From the White House, President 
Trump continues to target journalists 
and the media, referring to journalism 
as ‘‘an evil propaganda machine’’ and 
the free press as the ‘‘enemy of the peo-
ple.’’ Most recently and severely, amid 
the COVID–19 pandemic, the Trump ad-
ministration restricted most on-the- 
record access to administration offi-
cials and reportedly instructed all offi-
cials, including scientific and medical 
experts, to have public statements 
cleared through Vice President PENCE. 
This episode is unfortunately the lat-
est in an ongoing saga. Countries 
around the world have followed Presi-
dent Trump’s lead in attacking jour-
nalism as ‘‘fake news.’’ Between Janu-
ary 2017 and May 2019, at least 26 coun-
tries have enacted or introduced laws 
restricting access and media in the 
name of ‘‘fake news.’’ In attacking the 
media, President Trump not only un-
dermines the hard-hitting work jour-
nalists in the United States do to hold 
our leaders accountable and keep the 
public informed, but provides foreign 
leaders with the permission and vocab-
ulary to do the same. 
In spite of the unprecedented assault 
on the free press, journalists continue 
to take significant risks in the pursuit 
of truth and transparency. In January 
2020, the International Consortium of 
Investigative Journalists revealed how 
Isabel dos Santos amassed one of Afri-
ca’s largest fortunes in Angola, one of 
the world’s poorest countries, through 
embezzlement and corruption using a 
network of companies and subsidiaries. 
In May 2019, Caixin journalists re-
ported on business and government ac-
tions that resulted in the 2019 Jiangsu 
Tianjiayi Chemical Plant explosion in 
China that killed 78 people and injured 
over 600. Journalists have also contin-
ued to report on the situation of 
Uyghurs and other minorities held in 
detention centers in China’s Xinjiang 
region, including new revelations from 
hundreds of pages of leaked CCP docu-
ments published by the New York 
Times in November 2019. 
I join the international community 
in honoring and defending the brave 
journalists seeking to report on the 
truth and tell the stories that deserve 
to be told. Over 200 years ago, our 
Founding Fathers had the foresight to 
recognize the importance of a free 
press to a democracy, enshrining it in 
our First Amendment. Today, that im-
portance cannot be overstated. Recog-
nizing that societies where informed 
citizens can hold their governments ac-
countable are more stable, secure, and 
prosperous, we have a responsibility to 
stand up for the fundamental rights of 
freedom of expression and a free press. 
This week, I introduced a resolution 
commemorating World Press Freedom 
Day. The resolution highlights increas-
ing threats to freedoms of the press 
and expression worldwide, especially 
amid the COVID–19 pandemic, reaf-
firms the centrality of a free and inde-
pendent press to the health of democ-
racy, and reiterates freedom of the 
press as a priority of the United States 
in 
promoting 
democracy, 
human 
rights, and good governance. On this 
World Press Freedom Day, I call on the 
Trump administration and our world 
leaders to recommit to advancing press 
freedom, protecting journalists, and 
embracing the important role they 
play in a healthy and secure society. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to commemorate World Press 
Freedom Day, which was this past Sun-
day, and to celebrate the brave journal-
ists all over the world who safeguard 
the values of truth, democracy, trans-
parency, and justice through their 
work. Every year, we set aside this day 
to reaffirm our commitment to the free 
press. This year, however, is a little bit 
different. This year, we are in the 
midst of a brutal global public health 
crisis. One of the reasons that the 
COVID–19 pandemic has wreaked so 
much havoc—taking hundreds of thou-
sands of lives and devastating the econ-
omy—is that people with power have 
propagated misinformation about the 
virus. In the words of the World Health 
Organization, we are witnessing an 
‘‘info-demic.’’ Now, more than ever, it 
is vital that the public receives the 
truth, and that means protecting the

free press. We are relying on the press 
to bring us crucial, often life-saving, 
information about testing sites, shel-
ter-in-place orders, school closures, 
government aid, and how to keep our-
selves and our loved ones safe. That is 
why many States, Maryland among 
them, have designated local news out-
lets as ‘‘essential businesses’’ that are 
allowed to keep operating despite so-
cial distancing policies. 
In a noble effort to keep the public 
informed, many local media outlets 
have 
removed 
their 
paywalls 
for 
COVID–19-related news, forfeiting des-
perately needed revenue. Meanwhile, 
COVID–19 continues to place immense 
economic pressure on local news out-
lets and jeopardize their ability to 
function at all. Dozens of local publica-
tions have had to furlough reporters, 
reduce their publication frequency, or 
drop their print editions completely. 
This financial nightmare comes on the 
heels of more than a decade of hardship 
for local news. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pan-
demic is not the only threat facing 
journalists today. All around the globe, 
reporters face harassment and persecu-
tion for their attempts to spread the 
truth and hold leaders accountable. Re-
porters Without Borders has deter-
mined that at least 229 journalists 
worldwide currently are imprisoned for 
their work. According to the Com-
mittee to Protect Journalists, at least 
25 journalists were killed around the 
world in 2019, and at least six journal-
ists and media professionals have been 
killed in the first 4 months of 2020 
alone. Corrupt and powerful govern-
ments and individuals understand that 
free expression is a mighty tool against 
injustice, so they go to horrible lengths 
to stifle it. 
One courageous reporter who was 
murdered for pursuing the truth was 
Washington Post journalist and U.S. 
resident Jamal Khashoggi. The Central 
Intelligence Agency concluded with 
high confidence and the Senate unani-
mously approved a resolution stating 
that Saudi Government officials exe-
cuted and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi 
in 2018 at the behest of Crown Prince of 
Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman. 
To this day, however, justice for this 
crime remains elusive. The Global 
Magnitsky Act, which I authored with 
the late Senator John McCain to com-
bat human rights violations like this 
one, requires the U.S. administration 
to declassify its findings regarding who 
was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s 
death and to impose additional sanc-
tions on the culpable parties. President 
Trump has refused to do so. 
This failure to stand up for an Amer-
ican journalist an authoritarian regime 
silenced is just one example of how the 
Trump administration has turned its 
back on the freedom of the press. The 
President and his supporters have con-
tinuously 
tried 
to 
demonize 
and 
delegitimize news outlets whose report-
ing upsets them, to the point of label-
ing the media an ‘‘enemy of the Amer-
ican people.’’ As the illustrious jour-
nalist Edward R. Murrow so famously 
noted 66 years ago in responding to 
then-Senator 
Joe 
McCarthy’s 
vile 
smear tactics and intimidation: 
We must not confuse dissent with dis-
loyalty. We must remember always that ac-
cusation is not proof and that conviction de-
pends upon evidence and due process of law. 
We will not walk in fear, one of another. We 
will not be driven by fear into an age of 
unreason, if we dig deep in our history and 
our doctrine, and remember that we are not 
descended from fearful men—not from men 
who feared to write, to speak, to associate, 
and to defend causes that were, for the mo-
ment, unpopular. 
When the leader of the United States, 
a country devoted to principles of lib-
erty and democracy, flouts the truth in 
this way, it reverberates all across the 
world to the detriment of free expres-
sion everywhere. Between 2016 and 2019, 
the number of journalists imprisoned 
on spurious charges of disseminating 
so-called fake news more than tripled 
globally. 
We Americans feel the impact of this 
vilification of the press much closer to 
home, too. I will never forget learning 
about the fatal shooting at the Capital 
Gazette in Annapolis, MD, almost 2 
years ago. In the most deadly news-
room shooting in American history, a 
man who was angry that the newspaper 
accurately and merely reported his 
guilty plea in a criminal harassment 
case stormed into the Gazette office 
with a gun and killed five people. 
Those 
individuals—Gerald 
Fishman, 
Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca 
Smith, and Wendi Winters—died de-
fending one of the most sacred institu-
tions in our country. They died pro-
tecting every American’s right to know 
the truth. But they and hundreds of 
other journalists worldwide should not 
have to die in the line of duty. 
For the sake of our democracy and 
global human rights, we must do every-
thing we can to eliminate the violence 
and repression news media face. The 
United States can help lead this effort 
by loudly voicing our support for the 
free press as a key component of an in-
formed civil society and a government 
accountable to its people. That is why 
I am proud to cosponsor Senator 
MENENDEZ’s resolution in honor of 
World Press Freedom Day declaring 
the need for a truly free press and con-
demning threats to the freedom of ex-
pression around the world. The resolu-
tion applauds the bravery of journal-
ists and media workers and remembers 
those who have lost their lives in the 
course of their duties. 
We can also demonstrate our com-
mitment to a free press by remem-
bering those journalists and media pro-
fessionals who have lost their lives in 
the course of their duties. To that end, 
Senator PORTMAN
and I have intro-
duced a bill, S. 1969, to authorize a na-
tional memorial to fallen journalists. 
The National Capital Region has nu-
merous monuments and memorials to 
honor 
those 
individuals 
who 
have 
helped make our country stronger 
since its founding days. Currently 
missing from that honor roll is a me-
morial to reporters and other journal-
ists, such as those at the Capital Ga-
zette, who have sacrificed everything 
to protect the free, open, and trans-
parent society that all people deserve. 
My hope is that Congress will pass the 
Fallen Journalists Memorial Act soon. 
Once we establish this memorial, we 
will have a visible reminder to pay 
tribute to these heroes not just once a 
year, but every day. 
f 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH 
DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, while 
the Senate was out of session, the 
American people celebrated the 50th 
anniversary of Earth Day. I would like 
to take a moment to acknowledge that 
historic anniversary. 
We first celebrated Earth Day in 1970 
when 
then-Senator 
Gaylord 
Nelson 
brought more than 20 million Ameri-
cans together to mobilize in defense of 
our planet. In the half-century since, 
our Nation has benefitted from a pas-
sionate environmental movement that 
has pushed lawmakers, businesses, and 
communities to foster a healthier 
Earth. While this movement has yield-
ed significant progress, we nonetheless 
must do more to address the gravest 
threat to our environment: climate 
change. 
I recognize that, in the midst of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it might be dif-
ficult to wrap our heads around a sec-
ond crisis, but we have an important 
opportunity here to learn from one 
global emergency about how to navi-
gate another. 
The first lesson from the COVID–19 
pandemic: We must listen to experts. 
Public health experts have long fore-
cast the risk of a viral pandemic. Still, 
our 
leaders 
failed 
to 
prepare 
for 
COVID–19 and even denied the mag-
nitude of the threat we faced when it 
was 
at 
our 
doorstep. 
The 
novel 
coronavirus has now claimed over 
72,000 lives in the United States, a 
death toll higher than any other coun-
try. 
We are witnessing a parallel problem 
with climate change. For decades, ex-
perts have warned that human-caused 
climate change is heating the Earth. 
Ninety-seven percent of the world’s sci-
entists agree on this. Scientists are no 
longer just predicting the future impli-
cations of this crisis; they are pointing 
out the very real consequences of cli-
mate change that have already arrived. 
These include the rise in extreme 
weather events like floods, hurricanes, 
and wildfires that we have experienced 
across the United States in recent 
years. In Maryland, we have seen com-
munities like Ellicott City devastated 
by flash flooding from increased rain-
fall. Our State’s many miles of low- 
lying coast make us particularly vul-
nerable to high tide flooding and storm 
surge. The longer we wait to address 
climate change, the more natural dis-
asters we will face.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2320 
May 7, 2020 
Nevertheless, many of our Nation’s 
leaders continue to ignore and deny the 
science of climate change. President 
Trump has nominated several individ-
uals to oversee environmental regula-
tions, despite their alarming lack of 
expertise. Federal agencies like the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. 
Department of Agriculture have sup-
pressed climate science while carrying 
out crucial environmental research. 
And the Trump administration has ad-
vanced a policy agenda that unravels 
critical environmental protections. 
Right now, we need to be doing ev-
erything possible to protect our planet, 
not make it more vulnerable. 
Experts tell us that we have a short 
and critical window for action before 
the climate crisis becomes far more 
dire. According to the United Nations’ 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, we have 10 years to reduce 
global carbon emissions by 45 percent, 
or the Earth’s ecosystems will likely 
begin to collapse. That will mean even 
greater sea-level rise, more high tide 
flooding, more devastating hurricanes, 
more and faster-spreading wildfires, 
and more global infectious diseases. 
It is vital that we listen to experts 
and take steps to curb the development 
of climate change before it is too late. 
The second lesson: We must work 
with the international community to 
tackle this crisis. Much of President 
Trump’s foreign policy seems to rest on 
the assumption that the United States 
can become stronger through isolation. 
But the spread of COVID–19 makes it 
painfully clear that we are part of a 
global community and that there are 
certain threats that we will either 
overcome together or succumb to to-
gether. 
Climate change is one such threat. 
The United States is the second-largest 
emitter of greenhouse gas. Our failure 
to improve our environmental prac-
tices will have enormous impact on the 
rest of the world. Likewise, America’s 
long-term security depends on other 
countries’ efforts to protect the envi-
ronment. 
For example, as climate change con-
tinues, the number and severity of nat-
ural disasters in the United States will 
increase, which will take a substantial 
toll on our economy. A report that I re-
quested from the Government Account-
ability Office shows that the 14 climate 
disasters in 2018 cost the U.S. at least 
$91 billion in damage. And today, tax-
payer spending on Federal disaster re-
lief in the U.S. is almost ten times 
what it was three decades ago. 
We need help from our friends around 
the world in order to avoid these reper-
cussions of climate change. And if we 
ask for help, we had better be prepared 
to do our part, too. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
extremely 
dis-
appointing that President Trump is fi-
nalizing the withdrawal of the United 
States from the Paris Agreement, 
which we joined alongside more than 
190 other countries in 2016. Parties to 
the agreement committed to lowering 
carbon emissions with investment in 
clean and renewable energy sources, 
placing them at the forefront of the 
fight against climate change. Our Na-
tion’s retreat from this agreement un-
dermines our global credibility and 
leadership and threatens devastating 
environmental consequences. 
I led the U.S. congressional delega-
tion to the conference where the par-
ties originally adopted the Paris Agree-
ment; therefore, I could not stand by 
and watch that important work be un-
done. So I introduced a bipartisan reso-
lution expressing support for the agree-
ment and calling on the U.S. to con-
tinue working with the global commu-
nity to address the causes and effects 
of climate change. It will be up to lead-
ers at the local, State, and national 
level to ensure that the United States 
pulls our weight in this worldwide ef-
fort. 
The third lesson: Meaningful progress 
is within reach if Americans commit to 
urgent and bold action. Though it 
pains me to see the suffering that the 
COVID–19 pandemic is causing, I have 
been proud to watch communities 
across the country make the adjust-
ments required to slow the spread of 
the virus and keep each other safe. 
People are staying home, teleworking, 
helping their kids learn remotely, and 
isolating from friends and family. 
Health workers, first responders, and 
other essential employees are inspiring 
us with their bravery and dedication. 
And in Congress, we are working in a 
bipartisan fashion to pass major legis-
lation that will help us weather this 
storm. 
The resilience of the American peo-
ple in the face of this public health 
emergency gives me faith that we can 
similarly pull together to combat cli-
mate change if we recognize it for the 
life-threatening emergency that it is. 
After all, the World Health Organiza-
tion predicts that climate change will 
kill an additional 241,000 people per 
year by 2030, and the World Bank esti-
mates that, by 2050, it will force more 
than 140 million people out of their 
homes. 
The good news is that, unlike with 
COVID–19, the adaptations that will 
help us tackle climate change will also 
create jobs and stimulate our economy. 
The U.S. clean energy economy em-
ploys more than 3.3 million workers, a 
number that has been on the rise for 
the last 5 years. Furthermore, pro-
ducing renewable energy is cheaper in 
the long run than continuing to rely on 
coal. By 2025, almost every existing 
coal plant in the country will cost 
more to operate than building replace-
ment wind and solar plants nearby. 
And crucially, energy efficient infra-
structure will strengthen communities 
by lowering the cost of utilities, im-
proving residents’ health, and increas-
ing economic development. 
For my part, I will keep working as 
a member of the Senate Environment 
and Public Works Committee to advo-
cate for laws that protect Americans 
by protecting our planet. This Con-
gress, I was able to get the first ever 
climate title included in the surface 
transportation reauthorization bill in 
order to reduce vehicular emissions, 
the single largest source of U.S. carbon 
pollution. I have also cosponsored bills 
that will lessen our dependence on fos-
sil fuels and increase the development 
of renewable energy technologies by 
supporting the wind and solar indus-
tries. 
As always, I will continue to defend 
the vital wetlands and marshes of the 
Chesapeake Bay. As climate change 
causes severe weather patterns to in-
crease, these ecosystems will act as 
pollution filters and buffers from storm 
surge and flooding, minimizing the 
damage to Marylanders’ homes and 
businesses. The Chesapeake Bay res-
toration program is a model for the 
local, State, and Federal cooperation 
that we need to reach our environ-
mental goals. I am confident that we 
can address the climate crisis as a 
whole in an equally collaborative man-
ner. 
Now is the time for an ‘‘all hands on 
deck’’ approach. Just as we have re-
sponded to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Americans must urgently work to-
gether, on Earth Day and every day, to 
slow the causes and consequences of 
climate change. If we do things right, 
then perhaps on the 100th anniversary 
of Earth Day, someone will be standing 
here, thanking her predecessors for 
protecting the Earth and looking for-
ward to many more golden anniver-
saries on our beautiful home planet.

TRIBUTE TO THE BOUSTANY 
FAMILY 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today to tell the hopeful story of 
the Boustany family, Lebanese immi-
grants who arrived in Providence, RI, 
100 years ago next month. The family’s 
history exemplifies the extraordinary 
contributions that generations of im-
migrants have made to American life. 
The Boustany family’s journey began 
in Deir al-Qamar, Lebanon, a village 
southeast of Beirut. Life in Lebanon 
was difficult in those days. The people 
of Deir al-Qamar had seen it all: war, 
famine, pandemics, and even swarms of 
locusts. Michel and Yahout Boustany 
lost eight children to difficulties in 
childbirth and illnesses, and a ninth 
was tragically kidnapped. The sur-
viving members of the grief-stricken 
family resolved to leave their native 
country to start a new life in a land of 
opportunity. 
Getting to America wouldn’t be with-
out heartbreaking setbacks. The depar-
ture was delayed 6 long years due to 
World War I. Sadly, Michel passed 
away unexpectedly not long before the 
family 
was 
to 
make 
the 
voyage. 
Yahout, and two of her sons, Francis, 
age 11, and Frem, age 17, resolved to 
carry on with the plan to emigrate. 
The Boustany family left for the first 
leg of the journey from Beirut on a

Line 
steamship 
bound 
for 
Marseille, France. In Marseille, they 
boarded Fabre Lines’ SS Providence on 
its maiden voyage to Providence, RI. 
The family landed at the Port of 
Providence in June 1920. According to 
an article printed the following month 
in Providence Magazine, the SS Provi-
dence was welcomed by Rhode Islanders 
with great fanfare, as it was the largest 
steamship that had ever traveled up 
Narragansett Bay. From there, the 
family boarded a train to Lafayette, 
LA, where Yahout’s two oldest children 
had already settled. 
The 
Boustany 
family 
thrived 
in 
America. The children grew up, started 
families, and became successful entre-
preneurs and respected leaders in their 
community. 
The 
first 
generations 
passed along their Catholic faith and 
an exceptional work ethic to their chil-
dren and grandchildren who would go 
on to find success of their own in many 
pursuits. Members of the family have 
become civic leaders, doctors, lawyers, 
teachers, and so on. Among them is 
Vicki Kennedy, an accomplished law-
yer and the widow of a giant of the 
Senate, Ted Kennedy. Vicki is a dear 
friend to many of us in this Chamber. 
Dr. Charles Boustany, a retired heart 
surgeon and former Congressman from 
Louisiana, is also one of the family. 
June 17, 2020 marks 100 years to the 
day members of the Boustany family 
first set foot in Providence. Prior to 
the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, their 
descendants had been planning to trav-
el to Rhode Island to celebrate the cen-
tennial of their family’s beginning in 
America. Now, they are considering 
other ways to mark the anniversary re-
motely as a family. The Boustany fam-
ily represents the very best of us: hard-
working, generous, and community- 
minded. I wish them well as they cele-
brate this joyful occasion.

REMEMBERING ROSHELL ‘‘MIKE’’ 
ANDERSON 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and achieve-
ments of Mr. Roshell ‘‘Mike’’ Ander-
son, acclaimed journalist for 36 years 
with the Milwaukee-based television 
station, WISN–12. 
Mike was born in Bogalusa, LA, in 
1952 and raised in New Orleans. New Or-
leans’ rich musical culture inspired 
Mike’s life-long passion for R&B that 
landed him twice on the R&B soul 
charts in the 1970s with ‘‘Snake out of 
Green Grass’’ and ‘‘Grapevine will Lie 
Sometimes.’’ His musical accomplish-
ments continued into the early 1990s 
and helped spawn a unique brand of 
journalistic storytelling. 
Mike attended Louisiana State Uni-
versity and the Career Academy School 
of Broadcast Journalism in Atlanta, 
GA. He started his career as a disc 
jockey in various Atlanta radio sta-
tions in 1970 and got his start in tele-
vision in Seattle, WA, in 1979. When 
Mike took the job at WISN in Mil-
waukee in 1981, he planned to stay 3 
years. He retired from the station 36 
years later in 2017. 
Mike’s journalism career spanned 
nearly four decades and six U.S. Presi-
dencies. He was proud to have inter-
viewed Richard Nixon, George Bush, 
Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. But 
Mike’s most powerful work involved 
telling powerful and moving stories 
about the Milwaukee community. He is 
perhaps best known for his two award- 
winning documentaries on inner-city 
violence, ‘‘Children in the Line of Fire’’ 
and ‘‘Solutions to Violence.’’ 
Five years after Hurricane Katrina 
struck New Orleans, Mike returned to 
his home city to cover the city’s devas-
tation and its slow process of rehabili-
tation. Through his interviews with 
local residents, Mike found stories of 
hope, resilience, and many sobering re-
minders that much work was left to be 
done. As always, Mike brought his 
unique style of warmth, kindness, and 
optimism to even the darkest issues 
and events. 
After breaking racial and class bar-
riers, he mentored other journalists of 
color and worked to celebrate their 
success through his work with the Wis-
consin Black Media Association and 
Milwaukee’s annual Black Excellence 
Awards. 
Mike’s 
straightforward 
style 
and 
commitment to fairness led to a deep 
sense of trust on the part of his view-
ers. He will long be remembered for 
telling the stories of Milwaukee hon-
estly and with a deep connection to the 
community. 
Mike Anderson’s most lasting legacy, 
however, is that he was beloved by the 
Milwaukee community for not only 
being a great reporter people could 
trust, he was a good person whose kind-
ness will be missed. 
f 
REMEMBERING EUGENE KANE 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and work of Mr. 
Eugene Albert Kane, a renowned, pas-
sionate, and fearless journalist who for 
more than 30 years spoke truth to 
power and forced his readers to con-
front the uncomfortable realities of 
racism and injustice in Milwaukee, in 
Wisconsin, and in America. 
Eugene was born to Eugene Albert 
Kane, Sr., and Hattie (Freeman) Kane. 
He grew up in North Philadelphia and 
graduated 
from 
Temple 
University 
where he majored in journalism and 
minored in Black studies. In 1984, Eu-
gene moved to Milwaukee to take a job 
with the Milwaukee Journal, the pre-
cursor to today’s Milwaukee Journal 
Sentinel. There, he wrote what would 
become a very well-known column, 
‘‘Raising Kane.’’ The title’s insinuation 
of stirring the pot and causing what 
civil rights icon Congressman JOHN 
LEWIS has termed ‘‘good trouble,’’ was 
indeed, intentional. 
His early personal experiences with 
discrimination shaped his passion for 
equality and his need to speak publicly 
about racism. His grandfather, seri-
ously ill with pneumonia, died after 
being turned away from hospital emer-
gency rooms because of the color of his 
skin. As a teenager attending a mostly 
White school, Eugene remembered a 
fellow student he considered a friend, 
who taunted and berated him with vile 
racist insults. Racism followed him 
into his professional life as well. He re-
counted times when it was next to im-
possible to obtain interviews from peo-
ple in mostly White settings and was 
even falsely accused of being part of a 
pickpocket scheme while covering the 
Green Bay Packers in 1997 during 
Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. 
These experiences and others inspired 
him to give voice to the systematic 
racism saw and the lack of economic 
opportunities facing African Ameri-
cans in Milwaukee and the country. 
Rather than shying away from the un-
varnished truth of racism and social in-
justice in America, he walked right to-
wards it, pen and notebook in hand. 
As a Black journalist who elevated 
the voice of Black Milwaukee in a col-
umn read predominantly by a White 
audience, Eugene’s work garnered irri-
tation as well as praise. Even a fellow 
Wisconsin journalist wondered out loud 
why the Journal Sentinel would ‘‘give 
this guy a soap box?’’ He took hateful 
responses to his column in stride, view-
ing them as proof his words were land-
ing exactly where they needed to. In 
fact, he took pride in motivating peo-
ple to care enough about an issue to 
disagree with him. 
A greater number of readers and col-
leagues, however, were motivated to 
praise his work. In 2014, he was in-
ducted into both the Wisconsin Media 
Hall of Fame and the Milwaukee Press 
Club Hall of Fame. In 1992, he was 
awarded the Knight Fellowship at 
Stanford University. He also received 
national 
recognition, 
winning 
first 
place for Best General Column from 
the Society of Professional Journalists 
in 2000 and two first-place National 
Headliner Awards for Best Local Inter-
est Column in 2001 and 2003. 
His accomplishments and contribu-
tions went beyond the written word. He 
hosted ‘‘Black Nouveau’’ on Milwaukee 
Public 
Television 
from 
2002–2006, 
taught at the University of Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee and Marquette University, 
and served as president of the Wis-
consin Black Media Association in 2002. 
I am forever grateful that Eugene 
shared 
his 
important 
perspective 
throughout his long, storied career. 
Each step of the way he demonstrated 
the courage to tell the truth and shine 
a light on the injustices that were 
more comfortably left unspoken. This 
is a true testament to the value he 
served Wisconsin as a journalist. 
Eugene was a vital and honest voice 
for the Milwaukee community. Call 
him an agitator if you must. I don’t be-
lieve he would have it any other way. 
He said and wrote and needed to be 
heard and read. Eugene Kane will be 
missed by so many, but what he said 
and the words of wisdom he wrote will

REMEMBERING Q. TODD 
DICKINSON 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today, on 
behalf of myself and Senator COONS, we 
honor the life and legacy of The Honor-
able Q. Todd Dickinson. Todd was a 
great friend to our offices, and we often 
relied on him for impartial counsel as 
we endeavored to reform patent law. 
Todd was incredibly generous with his 
time and his intimate knowledge of 
patent law, and we will greatly miss 
him. 
Todd had an immeasurable impact on 
our patent system during a career 
spanning more than four decades. Todd 
served as the first Undersecretary of 
Commerce for Intellectual Property 
and Director of the Patent and Trade-
mark Office from 1999 to 2001, where he 
transformed the USPTO into a more 
modern and independent agency. Todd 
also served as executive director of the 
American Intellectual Property Law 
Association, where he played an essen-
tial role in the enactment of the 
Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. 
Todd is survived by his husband, Rob-
ert Atkins, and his brother, John Dick-
inson. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Todd’s family during this difficult 
time. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO KIMBERLY BIERLY 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor Kimberly ‘‘Kim’’ Bierly, 
who will retire this month after 13 
years of service to the U.S. Senate. For 
as long as I have been in the Senate, 
Kim has served as my regional man-
ager for the North Central Region of 
Pennsylvania. 
Born and raised in Lock Haven, Kim 
gained a wealth of professional experi-
ence prior to her Senate service. A stu-
dent of journalism, Kim graduated 
from Rider College before becoming a 
reporter for the Lock Haven Express. 
She later served as the national mar-
keting director for Penn State Univer-
sity and worked in private sector mar-
keting, before lending her time and tal-
ents to my 2006 Senate campaign. Fol-
lowing our victory that year, Kim 
began her Senate service when I asked 
her to join my State staff in 2007. 
Over the course of these many years, 
Kim has tirelessly championed the con-
cerns of rural constituents and worked 
to ensure that their needs were always 
addressed in my work. She answered 
thousands of phone calls, attended hun-
dreds of constituent meeting and trav-
eled far and wide across many, many 
miles to meet people in their own 
towns. She worked hard to present the 
views of our State’s farming commu-
nity and conducted me around all my 
engagements and events throughout 
the region. It is often said that Kim 
‘‘knows everyone in Central Pennsyl-
vania,’’ and I can testify that that is 
true. 
Kim has a heart of gold, and she has 
always watched over all of her col-
leagues as a kind of ‘‘Mother Hen,’’ 
sending along a kind word of encour-
agement, placing a personal call, and 
helping everyone who is in need. As a 
proud cancer survivor, she proudly 
ministers to other patients and be-
lieves in giving back in return for the 
many kindnesses bestowed on her dur-
ing her illness. 
For all of her professional accom-
plishments, Kim has many hobbies and 
personal pursuits. She is an accom-
plished knitter—socks are her favor-
ite—who owned her own small business 
in Centre County for several years 
called ‘‘Main Street Yarn.’’ She is also 
an animal lover who spent 10 years 
leading a volunteer golden retriever 
rescue organization in her free time 
that saved over 800 dogs. While she 
misses 
her 
goldens 
‘‘Timber’’ 
and 
‘‘Teddy’’ every day, she loves to show 
off pictures of her dog, ‘‘Charlie,’’ and 
her cat, ‘‘Caddy.’’ They are her family. 
My most enduring memories of Kim 
are our annual attempts to procure 
donuts and milkshakes at the Pennsyl-
vania Farm Show and snacking on the 
wonderful chocolate chip cookies she 
would bake for the whole team during 
our staff retreats. Her departure leaves 
big shoes to fill, but I wish her well as 
she and her husband, Keith, move on to 
this next adventure in their lives. 
Congratulations, Kim, for a job well 
done. I am grateful for your service to 
the country and the Commonwealth, 
and I wish you the best of luck in your 
retirement. We will miss you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
NORTH 
DAKOTA 
STUDENTS RECEIVING THE PRU-
DENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY 
AWARDS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I would 
like to congratulate and honor four 
North Dakota students who have been 
recognized for their remarkable volun-
teer service by the Prudential Spirit of 
Community Awards program. 
This year’s State honoress are Micah 
Schilittenhardt and Alexis Thompson 
of Bismarck. Distinguished finalists 
are Teagen Nicholes of Minot and 
Amorelle Upton of Fargo. 
Micah, a student at Legacy High 
School, has spent more than 150 hours 
raising awareness across North Dakota 
about the benefits of dance for people 
with Parkinson’s disease, while also 
raising funds for dance lessons, support 
groups, and research. Alexis, who at-
tends Horizon Middle School, started 
an annual toy drive which has provided 
gifts for more than 400 adolescent hos-
pital patients, launched a campaign to 
increase 
scoliosis 
awareness 
and 
screening, and organized a support 
group for girls with curvature of the 
spine. 
Teagen established a food pantry at 
Erik Ramstad Middle School, along 
with contacting local businesses for fi-
nancial support, spreading awareness 
about food insecurity and organized 
schoolwide activities to raise funds and 
donations. Amorelle, who attends Da-
vies High School, has raised money to 
benefit the Rape and Abuse Crisis Cen-
ter, has secured donations from local 
businesses, hosted several fundraising 
events, and sent more than 300 letters 
soliciting support from her local com-
munity. 
The Prudential Spirit of Community 
Awards were created by Prudential Fi-
nancial in partnership with the Na-
tional Association of Secondary School 
Principals in 1995. Their purpose is to 
impress upon all youth volunteers 
their contributions are critically im-
portant and highly valued and to in-
spire other young people to follow their 
example. Over the past 25 years, the 
program has become the Nation’s larg-
est youth recognition effort based sole-
ly on community service. It has hon-
ored more than 130,000 young volun-
teers at the local, State, and national 
level. 
These young volunteers inspire all of 
us and are among our brightest hopes 
for a better tomorrow. I heartily ap-
plaud them for their dedication to 
making 
their 
communities 
better 
places to live and for the positive im-
pact they have had on the lives of oth-
ers. Their actions show that young 
Americans can and do play important 
roles in their communities and that 
America’s community spirit continues 
to hold tremendous promise for the fu-
ture. Again, congratulations to Micah, 
Alesis, Teagen, and Amorelle. I fully 
expect to hear much more from each of 
them as they emerge as leaders of our 
next generation.∑

RECOGNIZING THE VICTORY 
SEWERS OF SANDERS COUNTY 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
the Victory Sewers of Sanders County 
for volunteering their time to support 
their community during the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic. 
In the face of these challenging 
times, a group of nearly 45 Montanans 
in Sanders County have stepped up to 
sew gowns for the staff of Fork Valley 
Hospital. Volunteers have also used 
leftover materials to produce protec-
tive masks for our law enforcement 
and first responders. 
The group has made over 90 gowns 
and over 500 masks, which have been 
distributed to clinics in Thompson 
Falls, Hot Springs, and to various 
emergency service personnel across 
Sanders County. The Victory Sewers 
are 
comprised 
of 
Montanans 
from 
Plains, 
Paradise, 
Thompson 
Falls, 
Trout Creek, and Noxon. 
It is my honor to recognize the Vic-
tory Sewers of Sanders County for 
their efforts to support our healthcare 
heroes and those on the frontlines of 
this pandemic. The compassion and

REMEMBERING SARKIS TATIGIAN 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Senator REED, we 
come to the floor today to ask our col-
leagues to join us in recognizing Mr. 
Sarkis Tatigian, who began his Navy 
career at the age of 19 during World 
War II and didn’t end it until he passed 
away last month at age 97. 
At the time of his death, Mr. 
Tatigian, after nearly 78 years of serv-
ice, was the longest serving civil serv-
ant in the history of the DOD. He was 
the only WWII sailor still serving in 
the Navy Department. 
Eligible for retirement since 1973, Mr. 
Tatigian continued to honor America 
through his faithful service as the 
Naval 
Sea 
Systems 
Command’s, 
NAVSEA, 
small 
business 
advocate, 
championing our Navy, our small busi-
nesses, and our country. 
Mr. Tatigian began his civilian ca-
reer with the Navy in July 1942 as a 
junior radio inspector at the naval air-
craft factory in the Philadelphia Navy 
Yard and the Navy Office of Inspector 
of Naval Aircraft in Linden, NJ. He left 
his position as an inspector in March 
1943 and entered the uniformed Navy as 
an Active-Duty sailor in April 1943. In 
June 1944, as an aviation electronics 
technician’s mate, he aided in the de-
velopment of the Navy’s first guided 
anti-ship 
munition, 
the 
ASM–N–2 
‘‘BAT’’ glide bomb. The BAT became 
an operational weapon in January 1945 
and was used to sink two Japanese war-
ships later that year. 
In 1943, Mr. Tatigian began his serv-
ice at NAVSEA, then called the Bureau 
of Ordinance. After World War II, he 
transitioned from the Active-Duty to 
the civil service working on guided mu-
nitions. 
In 1951, Mr. Tatigian saw the need to 
expand the Navy’s industrial base and 
believed that small business was the 
answer. He developed a small business 
mobile exhibit that traveled coast to 
coast, visiting all State capitals and 
cities 
with 
populations 
exceeding 
400,000. For his organizational efforts 
on the exhibit, Tatigian received con-
gressional recognition. His work ex-
panded the small business industrial 
base with more than $100 billion in con-
tracts awarded to diverse, small busi-
nesses. 
Over his unprecedented career, Mr. 
Tatigian received numerous awards, in-
cluding the Navy’s Superior Civilian 
Service Award in 2007. In recognition of 
his exceptional accomplishments in 
service, the Navy has even named an 
award after him, the Sarkis Tatigian 
Small Business Award, which recog-
nizes outstanding performance through 
organizational culture and command 
climate. 
Mr. Tatigian’s life of dedication and 
service to his country is truly inspira-
tional. On behalf of a grateful nation, 
we thank you, Mr. Sarkis Tatigian, for 
all you have done for our people, our 
government, and our Navy.∑

REMEMBERING JOHN A. MEANS 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize and honor the life 
of a great South Carolinian, Lt. Col. 
John A. Means, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), 
of Summerville. 
John was born on a farm in Kansas 
on December 11, 1918. In his lifetime, he 
witnessed 
many 
remarkable 
social 
changes, technological advancements, 
and international developments that 
transformed the world. 
He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air 
Corps in 1942 and became a pilot in 
1943. In 1950, he was called to Active 
Duty and was deployed to Korea as 
part of the 6147th Squadron, known as 
the Mosquitoes. John served in Wash-
ington, DC, with the Special Air Mis-
sions, SAM, unit, flying dignitaries at 
home and abroad in Air Force Two. 
During his time in the SAM outfit, he 
flew Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, 
Charles Lindbergh, and many others. 
He then retired from the military in 
1965 with the rank of lieutenant colonel 
and moved his family to Summerville, 
SC. After returning to civilian life, he 
worked as a mechanical engineer at 
Avcco and as a machine operator at 
Bosch. He also owned and operated his 
own service station. 
John served his community as a 
member of the Masons for over 75 
years, Scottish Rite, Shriners, and was 
also president of the Lions Club of 
Summerville. He also served on the 
board of directors as vice president of 
Charleston Mental Health, was an ac-
tive booster of the Summerville High 
School Marching Band, and was a 
founding member and Elder of Dor-
chester Presbyterian Church. 
Though Mr. Means has left us, his 
legacy will continue to live on in the 
hearts of many. Mr. Means’ patriotism, 
integrity, dedication, and commitment 
to serve his country are an inspiration 
to us all. He will not be forgotten, and 
I am certain South Carolina will con-
tinue to benefit from his labors for gen-
erations to come.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 3671. A bill to amend title VI of the 
Social Security Act to provide addi-
tional funding for States, Tribal Gov-
ernments, and local communities due 
to 
the 
Coronavirus 
Disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) public health emergency, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, in order to 
build on a key provision I authored in 
the CARES Act, which provided states 
with $150 billion in Coronavirus Relief 
Funds (CRF), I am introducing the 
State and Local Emergency Stabiliza-
tion Fund Act so that States and local 
governments can continue to be sup-
ported as they shoulder the costs of 
battling the corona virus. 
The State and Local Emergency Sta-
bilization Fund Act would cut needless 
red tape that was bureaucratically im-
posed by the Trump Administration, 
which is constraining States from 
spending the CRF money that Congress 
unanimously approved to save lives 
and help rescue our economy. My legis-
lation makes it clear that lost revenue 
is a cost. It also extends the time hori-
zon States have to spend the money in 
order to ensure they have the flexi-
bility to equitably allocate and dis-
burse the funding and help commu-
nities combat COVID–19 and recover. 
Unfortunately, the costs of respond-
ing to the coronavirus and keeping our 
economy afloat have only increased as 
result of this Administration’s inabil-
ity to formulate and execute a public 
health strategy based on facts and 
science, or implement effectively the 
resources and programs Congress au-
thorized to keep our economy afloat. 
To meet these increasing costs, this 
bill would provide State and local gov-
ernments an additional $600 billion in 
funding. The bill includes a protective 
$5 billion small State minimum, treats 
the District of Columbia and the Com-
monwealth of Puerto Kico as States, 
and reserves funds for territories and 
Tribes. In addition, $59 billion would be 
allocated to States based on their rel-
ative coronavirus infection rates, and 
$205 billion would be reserved elusively 
for local governments. 
State and local governments are 
being pushed to the financial brink by 
skyrocketing costs and plunging rev-
enue, and they need stability in order 
to have a chance at recovery. While 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have tried to paint this 
issue as a ‘red State vs. blue State’ 
problem, all fifty States are suffering 
and need financial relief from the Fed-
eral government to prevent massive 
layoffs, cuts to needed services, and fu-
ture tax hikes. 
In addition, on May 6, 2020, CNBC re-
ported ‘‘[p]rivate payrolls hemorrhaged 
more than 20 million jobs in April as 
companies sliced workers amid a co-
rona virus-induced shutdown that took 
most of the U.S. economy offline, ac-
cording to a report Wednesday from 
ADP. 
In 
all, 
the 
decline 
totaled 
20,236,000—easily the worst loss in the 
survey’s history going back to 2002 but 
not as bad as the 22 million that econo-
mists surveyed by Dow Jones had been 
expecting. The previous record was 
834,665 in February 2009 amid the finan-
cial crisis and accompanying Great Re-
cession.’’ 
Mr. President, the scale and pace of 
our public health emergency and the 
impact it has having on our economy 
requires each of us to swiftly set aside 
ideology and work urgently to address 
these generational challenges head on. 
Failure to respond in a timely manner 
will only result in more layoffs and a 
longer recession. It will mean States 
and local governments will be left un-
able to provide needed health, edu-
cation, public safety, and sanitation 
services, just when those services are 
needed most. Any economic recovery 
needs reliable State and local govern-
ments that provide the business cer-
tainty that make our attractive to 
businesses and investors throughout 
the world.

S2326 
May 7, 2020 
Nobody is immune from this crisis. 
Congress should come together, do the 
right thing, and provide States the re-
sources they need to save lives and 
livelihoods and get the economy work-
ing again. I urge each of my colleagues 
to join me in working to enact this leg-
islation so that we can get more crit-
ical federal resources to our States and 
local governments who are on the front 
lines of battling this public health and 
economic emergency.

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mrs. BLACKBURN, 
Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mr. DURBIN, and Ms. 
ERNST) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 563 
Whereas National Women’s History Month 
recognizes and spreads awareness of the im-
portance of women in the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas, throughout the history of the 
United States, whether in their homes, in 
their workplaces, in schools, in the courts, 
or during wartime, women have fought for 
themselves, their families, and all people of 
the United States; 
Whereas, even from the early days of the 
history of the United States, Abigail Adams 
urged her husband to ‘‘Remember the La-
dies’’ when representatives met for the Con-
tinental Congress in 1776; 
Whereas women were particularly impor-
tant in the establishment of early chari-
table, philanthropic, and cultural institu-
tions in the United States; 
Whereas women led the efforts to secure 
suffrage and equal opportunities for women, 
and also served in the abolitionist move-
ment, the emancipation movement, labor 
movements, civil rights movements, and 
other causes to create a more fair and just 
society for all; 
Whereas suffragists wrote, marched, were 
arrested, 
and 
ultimately 
succeeded 
in 
achieving— 
(1) the ratification of the 19th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States, 
which provides, ‘‘The right of citizens of the 
United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of sex.’’; and 
(2) the enactment of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), which ex-
tended the protection of the right to vote to 
women of color and language minorities; 
Whereas, in 2020, the United States cele-
brates the 100th anniversary of the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which guarantees 
women the constitutional right to vote; 
Whereas women have been and continue to 
be leaders in the forefront of social change 
efforts, business, science, government, math, 
art, literature, music, film, athletics, and 
other fields; 
Whereas women now represent approxi-
mately half of the workforce of the United 
States; 
Whereas women once were routinely barred 
from attending medical schools in the 
United States, but now are enrolling in med-
ical schools in the United States at higher 
numbers than men; 
Whereas women previously were turned 
away from law school, but now represent ap-
proximately half of law students in the

Whereas, since the American Revolution, 
women have been vital to the mission of the 
Armed Forces, with more than 200,000 women

veterans representing every branch of serv-

Whereas more than 10,000,000 women own

pass Congress designating ‘‘Women’s History 
Month’’; 
Whereas, in 1987, President Ronald Reagan

claiming March 1987 as ‘‘Women’s History 
Month’’; and 
Whereas, despite the advancements of 
women in the United States, much remains 
to be done to ensure that women realize

it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2020 as ‘‘National

Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in which they di-
vided Poland between themselves; 
Whereas Nazi Germany invaded Poland 
from the west on September 1, 1939, and the 
Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east 
on September 17, 1939; 
Whereas over 60,000 Polish soldiers died in 
combat defending Poland from these inva-
sions; 
Whereas, after the Red Army invaded Po-
land, it captured thousands of Polish mili-
tary personnel and civilians, many of whom 
had fled east from the Nazi invasion; 
Whereas the Soviet People’s Commissariat 
for Internal Affairs, or NKVD, took charge of 
the Polish prisoners from the Red Army and 
transferred them to the Kozelsk, Starobilsk, 
and Ostashkov internment camps in the 
western Soviet Union, where many were sub-
ject to lengthy interrogations; 
Whereas, on March 5, 1940, Soviet General 
Secretary Josef Stalin and three Soviet Po-
litburo members signed an NKVD order to 
execute nearly 22,000 prisoners by shooting 
that also identified more than 10,000 addi-
tional Polish prisoners for possible execu-
tion; 
Whereas, in April and May 1940, the NKVD 
summarily executed the condemned Polish 
prisoners at several sites in the Soviet 
Union, including at the Katyn Forest west of 
Smolensk in the Russian Soviet Federative 
Socialist Republic, and buried them in mass 
graves; 
Whereas, in April 1943, occupying Nazi 
troops discovered eight mass graves in the 
Katyn Forest with the remains of many of 
those Polish prisoners; 
Whereas, following this discovery in the 
Katyn Forest, the mass executions by the 
Soviets of the Polish prisoners from all three 
camps became known as the Katyn Mas-
sacre; 
Whereas the 21,892 victims of the Katyn 
Massacre included military officers, chap-
lains, professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, 
teachers, journalists, and refugees, many of 
whom were military reservists who had been 
mobilized as a result of the Nazi invasion; 
Whereas between 700 and 900 Polish Jews 
were killed in the Katyn Massacre; 
Whereas the Soviet Union falsely blamed 
Nazi Germany for the massacre and broke off 
diplomatic relations with the Polish govern-
ment-in-exile following a request by the gov-
ernment-in-exile 
that 
the 
International 
Committee of the Red Cross examine the 
Katyn mass graves; 
Whereas an international medical commis-
sion excavated the area in Spring 1943 and 
determined that the massacre occurred in 
1940, when the area was under Soviet control; 
Whereas the Soviet Union continued to 
deny responsibility for the Katyn Massacre, 
blaming the Nazis and concealing evidence of 
its guilt, for nearly 50 years; 
Whereas, on September 18, 1951, the United 
States House of Representatives established 
the Select Committee to Conduct an Inves-
tigation and Study of the Facts, Evidence, 
and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Mas-
sacre, which is referred to as the Madden 
Committee; 
Whereas, after reviewing witness testi-
mony and relevant documents, the Madden 
Committee unanimously found that the 
NKVD, and thus the Soviet Union, was re-
sponsible 
for 
the 
executions 
and 
rec-
ommended a trial before the International 
World Court of Justice; 
Whereas scholars in the United States and 
United Kingdom published books and articles 
demonstrating the truth of the Katyn Mas-
sacre during the decades of Soviet denial; 
Whereas, in Poland in 1981, the Solidarity 
movement erected a memorial with the in-
scription ‘‘Katyn, 1940’’ that the Communist 
government removed and replaced with a 
memorial falsely blaming the Nazis for the 
massacre; 
Whereas, in 1988, demonstrators marched 
in Warsaw to demand an official inquiry into 
the Katyn Massacre; 
Whereas, on April 13, 1990, 50 years after 
the executions of the Polish prisoners and 47 
years since the day the discovery of the mass 
graves was announced, the Soviet govern-
ment issued a statement accepting responsi-
bility for the Katyn Massacre and calling it 
‘‘one of the most heinous crimes of Sta-
linism’’; 
Whereas on that day Soviet President Mi-
khail Gorbachev gave the Government of Po-
land copies of Soviet archival materials per-
taining to the executed prisoners that con-
firmed Soviet responsibility for the mas-
sacre; 
Whereas, in recent months, President 
Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials 
have attempted to propagate a false nar-
rative that Poland was responsible for the 
outbreak of World War II, ignoring the facts 
of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the co-
ordinated Nazi and Soviet invasions of Po-
land; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Russian officials 
ordered the removal of a plaque at a former 
regional NKVD headquarters in Tver com-
memorating the estimated 6,000 Poles mur-
dered in the building as part of the Katyn 
Massacre; 
Whereas President Putin and the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation use these 
historical revisionist narratives, including 
false accusations about Polish responsibility 
for World War II, as a tool in their attempt 
to whitewash Soviet history, elevate Rus-
sia’s international position, and sow polit-
ical discord among its neighbors and adver-
saries; 
Whereas the Katyn Massacre fits into a 
larger pattern of Communist governments 
around the world persecuting their citizens 
and denying their people freedom, which has 
resulted in the deaths of up to 100,000,000 peo-
ple since the Russian Revolution of 1917; and 
Whereas the year 2020 marks the 80th anni-
versary of the Katyn Massacre: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the lives and legacies of the ap-
proximately 22,000 Polish soldiers and civil-
ians who were murdered by the Soviet Peo-
ple’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or 
NKVD, during the Katyn Massacre 80 years 
ago; 
(2) recognizes the witnesses, scholars, ac-
tivists, and demonstrators who fought to 
bring the truth of the Katyn Massacre to 
light in the face of the cover-up campaign or-
chestrated by the Soviet Union; 
(3) condemns both past and present at-
tempts to cover up truth of the Katyn Mas-
sacre; 
(4) condemns broader efforts by the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation to spread 
disinformation about the history of World 
War II; and 
(5) encourages education about the facts of 
the Katyn Massacre, including the horrors of 
the massacre itself and subsequent attempts 
to deny it or cover it up.

RISCH, Mr. KAINE, Mr. COONS, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. 
MARKEY, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
ROMNEY, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 567 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
caused an unprecedented disruption in global 
commerce and travel; 
Whereas foreign governments around the 
world have limited and restricted commer-
cial travel arriving and departing from their 
countries to mitigate the spread of COVID–19 
by closing airports, seaports, and borders; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and the 
resulting travel restrictions abroad left tens 
of thousands of United States citizens and 
legal permanent residents overseas without a 
direct way to return to the United States; 
Whereas it was an extraordinary challenge 
for the Department of State to help so many 
Americans seeking repatriation from around 
the world at the same time; 
Whereas on March 19, 2020, in response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic and the mounting 
repatriation demand from United States citi-
zens and legal permanent residents living 
abroad, the Department of State created a 
Repatriation Task Force to facilitate the re-
patriation of these Americans and to notify 
Congress and any Americans needing repatri-
ation assistance of these efforts; 
Whereas career professionals at the De-
partment of State, with exemplary contribu-
tions from the members of the Department’s 
Repatriation Task Force and embassy and 
consulate staff around the world, in partner-
ship with commercial airlines and the United 
States Transportation Command, brought 
home more than 78,000 Americans on 833 
flights originating from 128 countries and 
territories during an 18-week period; 
Whereas Department of State officers, 
their family members, and locally engaged 
staff faced personal risk, long hours, and rap-
idly changing local circumstances to assist 
Americans needing transportation to the 
United States; 
Whereas Department of State officers and 
contract employees across the United States 
have worked to ensure that vital visa and 
passport services remain operational, includ-
ing for tasks critical to the support of our 
national security, health care systems, and 
food supply chains; and 
Whereas at least 450 Department of State 
personnel were diagnosed with COVID–19, in-
cluding 5 who died from the illness: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the tremendous work done 
by Department of State career profes-
sionals— 
(A) to address the extraordinary challenges 
related to the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
(B) to bring home more than 78,000 Amer-
ican citizens during a time of crisis; 
(2) thanks Department of State career pro-
fessionals who volunteered to work at all 
hours to meet the Department’s highest pri-
ority, which was helping fellow citizens in a 
time of dire need and stress; 
(3) commends the Repatriation Task Force 
for their efforts to facilitate the repatriation 
of United States citizens and lawful perma-
nent residents; 
(4) thanks the employees at United States 
embassies and consulates throughout the 
world, particularly career consular officers, 
for their work to identify flights and execute 
the departure procedure of thousands of indi-
viduals, despite difficult operating condi-
tions on the ground;

Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise to introduce a resolution 
with Senator RISCH, as well as other 
colleagues, to thank countless State 
Department career officials for their 
extensive efforts to bring home over 
78,000 United States citizens and legal 
permanent 
residents 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This pandemic 
caused an unprecedented disruption in 
global travel, leaving tens of thousands 
of United States citizens and legal per-
manent residents stranded overseas 
with no direct way to return to the 
United States. While we will have 
ample opportunity in the future to ex-
amine and better understand the deci-
sions made by senior leadership at the 
Department of State at the onset of 
the COVID–19 crisis that could have al-
lowed the United States to more effec-
tively respond to this pandemic, in-
cluding to identify and mitigate repa-
triation challenges, I will note that 
once the Department recognized the 
enormity of the repatriation crisis, it’s 
career professionals sprung into action 
and, characteristically, rose to meet 
the challenge and serve their nation 
with distinction. 
Staying true to the Department’s 
most fundamental mission, to protect 
U.S. citizens abroad, State Department 
officers, family members, and local em-
ployees faced great personal risk and 
long hours to assist U.S. citizens dur-
ing a time of dire need and stress. For 
that, my colleagues and I are tremen-
dously grateful. We commend the ex-
traordinary work done by the Repatri-
ation Task Force, embassy and con-
sulate staff around the world, and the 
United States Transportation Com-
mand. Their efforts resulted in the re-
patriation of over 78,000 Americans on 
833 flights originating from 128 coun-
tries and territories in just an 18–week 
period. I would also like to extend my 
deepest thanks to Principal Deputy As-
sistant Secretary Ian Brownlee and 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Hugo Yon 
for their exemplary leadership of and 
contribution to the Repatriation Task 
Force, as well as to Wendy Kennedy for 
her work with the Bureau of Legisla-
tive Affairs. Furthermore, I would like 
to thank Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Julie Chung, Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary Kevin O’Reilly, Consul 
General Dana Deree (Honduras), Consul 
General William Bent (El Salvador), 
Consul General John Barrett (Recife), 
Deputy Chief of Mission Denison Offutt 
(Lima), Director for Central America 
Affairs Marta Youth, and Country Con-
sular Coordinator Alexander Delorey 
(Quito) for their leadership in facili-
tating the repatriation of thousands of 
Americans citizens from countries in 
the Western hemisphere. I recognize 
that in calling out these individuals 
who were especially helpful to me and 
to my office that I run the risk of not 
naming the tens, if not hundreds of 
others who worked just as hard and 
contributed just as much; they have 
my thanks as well. 
I, along with my colleagues, are pro-
foundly grateful to the Department of 
State personnel who have worked tire-
lessly these past few months, who have 
served the United States above and be-
yond the call of duty, and who have 
helped their fellow citizen in a time of 
dire need. I urge the Department to 
continue its good work and to remain 
ready to bring home American citizens 
and legal permanent residents as the 
COVID–19 pandemic persists.
