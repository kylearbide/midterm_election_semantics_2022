PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who sends the rain that 
satisfies the parched Earth, we honor 
Your Name. 
Today, give our lawmakers the wis-
dom to understand that You are their 
sure foundation. Inspire them to seek 
Your guidance as they strive to do 
Your will. Lead them by Your truth 
and teach them, for You are the God 
who saves them. 
May their quest to fulfill Your pur-
poses motivate them to bring You their 
requests and to wait patiently for Your 
response. 
Lord, show them clearly what to do 
and which way to turn. Surround them 
with the shield of Your love. 
We pray in Your marvelous Name.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 963 and H.R. 1868 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I understand that there are two 
bills at the desk due for a second read-
ing en bloc. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The leader is correct. 
The clerk will read the bills by title 
for a second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 963) to authorize dedicated do-
mestic terrorism offices within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the Department 
of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation to analyze and monitor domestic 
terrorist activity and require the Federal 
Government to take steps to prevent domes-
tic terrorism, and for other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 1868) to prevent across-the- 
board direct spending cuts, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bills on the calender under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding en bloc. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bills will be placed on the calendar. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
despite unprecedented obstacles, the 
Senate has had an extremely produc-
tive first period of business. 
It has been a little over 60 days since 
Democrats assumed the majority in 
the Senate and Joe Biden was sworn in 
as President. In that relatively short 
amount of time, the Senate has con-
firmed every available Cabinet Sec-
retary—a group filled with a bevy of 
historic firsts—faster than under the 
prior two administrations. 
Every single Cabinet nominee has re-
ceived a bipartisan vote of approval 
here on the floor, a tribute to their 
character, their qualifications, and 
their caliber. 
The Senate also conducted a fair and 
honest 
impeachment 
trial 
of 
the 
former President, resulting in the larg-
est and most bipartisan conviction

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1792 
March 25, 2021 
vote in the history, in the history of 
Presidential impeachments. 
And, of course, the Democratic ma-
jority in the Senate passed the most 
sweeping Federal recovery effort in 
decades, the American Rescue Plan. 
Again, despite several unprecedented 
obstacles, not only did we get a late 
start on our work, a result of the run-
off elections in Georgia, we have had to 
contend with the aftermath of an 
armed insurrection at the Capitol, an 
impeachment trial, and the difficulty 
of navigating an evenly divided Senate. 
Let’s take a quick look at the score-
board. 
Economists project that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan could double eco-
nomic growth while cutting child pov-
erty in half—the biggest anti-poverty 
effort in a generation. 
We have made the single largest in-
vestment in American education and 
Native Tribes ever. 
Experts have called the American 
Rescue Plan the most significant legis-
lation for Black farmers since the Civil 
Rights Act. 
The American Rescue Plan provides a 
lifeline to Main Street businesses from 
one end of the country to the other. 
Companies are already scaling back 
layoffs. 
In less than 100 days, the Biden ad-
ministration and Democratic majori-
ties have helped deliver more than 100 
million shots in people’s arms and 100 
million checks in people’s pockets. As 
a result, the American people are more 
optimistic than at any time over the 
past year, and for the first time since 
the COVID–19 pandemic began, a clear 
majority of Americans believe our 
country is back on track. 
Just this morning, the jobs report 
showed that applications for unemploy-
ment benefits fell by nearly 100,000 peo-
ple—a sign that businesses are reopen-
ing 
and 
Americans 
are 
optimistic 
about getting back to work. After one 
of the most difficult years in American 
history, the country is finally turning 
the corner, and the Senate is off to a 
fantastic start. 
Now looking forward, of course the 
job certainly isn’t done yet. Now that 
we have passed the American Rescue 
Plan, the Senate must continue to 
make progress on other issues facing 
the American people. When the Senate 
returns to session, our agenda will be 
no less ambitious than it was over the 
past few months. 
We will focus on three areas: one, 
voting rights, civil rights; two, eco-
nomic recovery and jobs, with an em-
phasis on climate change and building 
back better; and three, health and gun 
safety. 
This Senate will once again be the 
forum where civil rights are debated 
and historic action is taken to secure 
them for all Americans. 
Last week, the Judiciary Committee 
held the first-ever hearing on the 
Equality Act, landmark legislation 
that would enshrine as a matter of law 
that no American shall be denied jus-
tice based on their gender or sexual 
orientation. 
In the coming work period, the 
Democratic majority will also seek to 
repeal a Trump administration rule 
that gives employers an unfair advan-
tage over workers when settling dis-
criminatory claims. 
At the same time, the Judiciary and 
Rules Committees have started their 
work responding to the concerted, na-
tionwide, despicable attack on voting 
rights. In one State after another, new 
restrictions on the franchise are taking 
aim at communities of color in ways 
we haven’t seen since the days of Jim 
Crow. 
Yesterday, I attended the Rules Com-
mittee hearing on S. 1, the For the 
People Act, and I listened to my Re-
publican colleagues try to defend these 
outrageous voter suppression laws. One 
member on the committee told us not 
to worry about them because many are 
just proposals and won’t become law. 
Later that day, the same day, the Mon-
tana State Senate advanced a bill to 
end same-day voter registration. 
Another member on the committee 
defended limits to early voting on Sun-
days—a day when many African Ameri-
cans go to vote after church—by 
quoting the Bible and the Command-
ment to keep the Sabbath holy. I don’t 
know where to begin with that one, but 
I will start by reminding my colleagues 
of the separation between church and 
state, and, frankly, the Bible passage 
she talked about comes from the Old 
Testament, when the Sabbath was on 
Saturday. 
This is getting beyond ridiculous. 
Across the country, the Republican 
Party seems to believe that the best 
strategy for winning elections is not to 
win more voters but to try to prevent 
the other side from voting. That is not 
America. That is not democracy. And 
this Senate will take action to protect 
the voting rights of tens of millions of 
Americans. The Senate will vote on the 
For the People Act. 
We will also keep a laser focus on our 
economic recovery. In the coming 
months, the Senate will consider legis-
lation to rebuild our infrastructure and 
fight climate change, boost research 
and development and domestic manu-
facturing, reform our broken immigra-
tion system, and grow the power of 
American workers. Finally, the Senate 
will address health and gun safety. 
When the Senate gavels back into 
session, 
we 
will 
vote 
on 
Senator 
HIRONO’s 
COVID 
hate 
crimes 
bill, 
which my colleague GRACE MENG has 
sponsored in the House. It will give the 
Department of Justice and our local 
police departments crucial tools to 
fight the wave of racist violence we 
have seen against Asian Americans. 
I have also committed to put a bill 
on expanded background checks on the 
floor of the Senate. 
On the health front, we will take aim 
against the former administration’s de-
cision to roll back limits on methane 
emissions from oil and gas produc-
tion—gases that pack a much greater 
punch than carbon dioxide when it 
comes to our climate. Senators HEIN-
RICH, KING, and MARKEY
have been 
working very hard on this issue. I ap-
plaud them. The Senate will take up a 
Congressional Review Act measure to 
reinstate the commonsense regulation 
of methane emissions to fight climate 
change. 
The bottom line is this: The Senate 
of the 117th Congress has accomplished 
a lot in its first few months, but we 
have a lot of work left to do. The chal-
lenges our country still faces are im-
mense, and there is no reason both 
sides cannot work together on issues 
that will affect our country and our 
children’s future. We won’t agree on 
everything, but we must agree that in-
action is unacceptable. The Senate 
must help the country finish the job 
against COVID while continuing to 
build a more equal economy and a 
more just society. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the crisis on our southern border con-
tinues to escalate. CBP is tracking the 
largest surge in migrant apprehensions 
in 20 years. Unaccompanied children 
are literally piling up in close quarters. 
It turns out when politicians spend a 2- 
year campaign advertising amnesty, 
people actually listen. As one senior 
CBP official said, there is ‘‘no end in 
sight.’’ No end in sight. 
The administration still refuses to 
even admit there is a crisis, much less 
address it. We keep hearing strange 
mixed messaging from the White House

March 25, 2021 
podium like ‘‘now is not the time to 
come,’’ as if there will be a good time 
to break the law and come illegally, 
and the White House will let us all 
know when that time is, I assume. 
The Washington Post put it gently: 
‘‘Administration officials have been 
plagued by muddled messaging.’’ Boy, 
that is an understatement. But actu-
ally, when you look at Democrats’ ac-
tions, the message isn’t mixed at all. 
That is the problem. For months on 
the campaign trail, President Biden 
spoke directly to potential migrants. 
At one point, he said, ‘‘You want to 
flee . . . you should come.’’ That was 
President Biden. 
President Lopez Obrador of Mexico 
himself stated this week that President 
Biden’s campaign created expectations 
that ‘‘caused Central American mi-
grants, and also from our country, 
wanting to cross the border, thinking 
that it is easier to do so.’’ That was the 
President of Mexico. 
On Inauguration Day, the President 
followed through—five Executive or-
ders to roll back immigration enforce-
ment and open up the border. The ad-
ministration wasted no time rolling 
back the policies from the prior admin-
istration that had guarded against this 
exact outcome. South of the border, 
message received. Some migrants are 
arriving with Biden campaign flags and 
T-shirts. One arriving person said, 
‘‘Biden promised us that everything 
was going to change.’’ 
So what about the Democrats here in 
Congress? Are the House Democrats 
rising to the occasion with solutions? 
Well, not exactly. They prioritized 
passing another amnesty bill. They 
doubled down on the wrong direction 
and the wrong incentives. 
The situation is raising eyebrows 
among Democrats’ own rank and file. 
As one Texas Democrat put it, ‘‘When 
you create a system that incentivizes 
people to come across . . . that imme-
diately sends a message.’’ 
Here, in the Senate, our Democratic 
colleagues decided to go the route of 
obstruction. 
Yesterday, 
Republicans 
tried to pass serious proposals to help 
address parts of the immigration sys-
tem. Democrats rejected every single 
one of them. 
Senator ERNST had a proposal to re-
quire detention for migrants charged 
with violent crimes. It is not exactly a 
radical idea. Democrats blocked it. 
Senator CRUZ had legislation to raise 
the stakes for repeated illegal entry. It 
is not exactly rocket science. Demo-
crats blocked that one too. 
Senator BLACKBURN and Senator LEE 
tried to combat child trafficking with-
in the asylum process, and Democrats 
even blocked that. 
The furthest left ideology on these 
issues is keeping Washington Demo-
crats from upholding the basic respon-
sibility of government: ensuring the in-
tegrity of our borders and protecting 
our national security. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Madam President, now, on another 
matter. Yesterday, the Rules Com-
mittee held a hearing on the Demo-
crats’ proposal to tilt our entire polit-
ical system on a partisan basis. It 
would forcibly rewrite every State’s 
election laws in ways that defy com-
mon sense and are deeply unpopular 
with American voters. 
It would mandate nearly unrestricted 
same-day registration. It would man-
date big loopholes that would render 
voter ID almost meaningless. It would 
make every State legalize ballot har-
vesting, where paid operatives can turn 
up carrying big piles of ballots with 
other people’s names on them, zero 
chain of custody. 
Democrats want to hide behind the 
mantle of voting rights. What they are 
really proposing is less security, less 
integrity, and a grab bag of changes 
that are deeply, deeply unpopular. Just 
look at the other changes with zero re-
lationship to voting rights that Demo-
crats want to smuggle in behind that 
smokescreen. 
This bill would take the Federal 
Election Commission from an evenly 
split, bipartisan panel to a partisan 
body so that Democrats could rule uni-
laterally over politics as well as citi-
zens’ speech, turn the neutral judge 
into a partisan prosecutor, and it 
would send taxpayers’ money to fund 
political campaigns. 
It contains a massive attack on the 
privacy of citizens who engage in free 
speech, a massive and intentional gift 
to cancel culture. That led even the 
leftwing ACLU to oppose this bill 2 
years ago and lead senior ACLU law-
yers to torch it again in the Wash-
ington Post just recently. 
Democrats are desperate to avoid 
talking about any of these things. 
They are desperate to convince the 
media that a partisan takeover at the 
FEC, socialism for political ad makers, 
and an assault on free speech and 
Americans’ privacy are just ‘‘voting 
rights,’’ a shameless, shameless bait 
and switch. 
I noticed something funny yesterday. 
Remember, this is the same bill Demo-
crats were shopping around 2 years ago 
in response to the 2016 election, which 
they said was a disaster. Now, 2 years 
ago, Democrats were marketing this 
bill as a massive shakeup that our bro-
ken elections badly needed. 
Our democracy was in shambles after 
they lost in 2016. It was broken, they 
said. It was insecure, they said, and 
only 
this 
sweeping 
transformation 
could possibly repair it. Of course, it 
didn’t pass, and the 2020 election came 
and went without the liberal takeover, 
and yet Democrats say it was a huge 
success. 
Democrats said the 2020 election was 
beyond reproach. They said the integ-
rity and security were beyond ques-
tion. They have said only conspiracy 
theorists would complain about the 
last election. 
Oh, but curiously enough, they are 
now still pushing this very same bill. 
Now, instead of a sweeping trans-
formation, they are trying to say it 
would just preserve our smoothly func-
tioning system so State legislatures 
can’t mess it up. 
So let’s get this straight. Two years 
ago, in 2019, Democrats suggested this 
bill was a bold, radical overhaul for a 
broken system. In the meantime, what 
happened was, they got an election 
they liked, and now they claim the 
exact same legislation just does a few 
modest things to protect our system 
just the way it is. 
What 
utter 
nonsense—utter 
non-
sense. This legislation has but one 
goal, just one. It has only ever had one 
goal, just one. That goal was the same 
in 2019 as it is today. And that goal is 
to let Washington Democrats rig the 
rules of democracy from top down to 
hide that partisan project behind the 
smokescreen, the smokescreen of vot-
ing rights. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now one final mat-
ter. Senators will soon head home for 
the State work period. We will be see-
ing an Easter recess of optimism and 
hope as the tide of the pandemic con-
tinues to turn. Thanks to science and 
fueled by five bipartisan bills we passed 
last year, vaccines were developed, ap-
proved, and preordered in record time. 
America was delivering more than a 
million doses per day before the cur-
rent administration even took office. 
And because of last year’s bipartisan 
work, our economy was already poised 
for a historic comeback. I am also 
going to be talking with Kentuckians 
about their confusion and concern sur-
rounding the multitrillion-dollar par-
tisan spending plan that Democrats 
just rushed through Congress recently, 
like why teachers unions got huge 
sums for schools, much of which won’t 
be spent until years, years into the fu-
ture, without any meaningful require-
ment to reopen, even though science 
says it is safe. There are concerns like 
why Kentucky and other States whose 
budgets have come through the crisis 
intact will actually be subsidizing mas-
sive bailouts to other States for mis-
management that predates the pan-
demic, and confusion and concern 
about the radical, last-minute provi-
sion that tries to prevent States from 
implementing any policy, any policy 
that might be interpreted as a tax cut. 
That one could wreak havoc on the 
plans of local officials in my State and 
entire industries as they try to get the 
Bluegrass growing again. This provi-
sion has the potential to shoot down a 
State law designed to help the Com-
monwealth’s small businesses deduct 
PPP expenses from their State taxes 
and unwind planned waivers of hikes 
on their unemployment taxes. 
Secretary Yellen was asked about 
this huge uncertainty in a hearing yes-
terday, about how this will be defined 
or enforced. She essentially had no an-
swers. 
So I will be joining Kentuckians to 
celebrate what has gone well, thanks 
to our bipartisan work just last year; 
to hear their concerns about all the

consequences of the Democrats’ go-it- 
alone effort; and to hear what they 
think about the multimillion-dollar 
cousin of the Green New Deal that 
Democrats are reportedly planning for 
a sequel. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Oklahoma. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 1402 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
there is a problem with the Paycheck 
Protection Program. It passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan support last 
December, but the implementation has 
been botched. 
Let me explain what I mean. If you 
are a small business owner, if you are 
an individual that is a sole proprietor 
of what is called a schedule C, if you 
had major issues in trying to be able to 
cover your employment last year, you 
would turn in—make a request for the 
Paycheck Protection Program. It was 
extended in December of last year for 
only the hardest hit businesses, those 
that had a 25-percent loss or more. 
Those businesses could not survive into 
the next year. 
So we extended it out and allowed 
them to be able to get additional time 
and an additional couple of months of 
payroll to be able to make sure they 
make it. Now, for these extremely 
small businesses, these sole propri-
etors, and these individuals who are 
out there, this means just them or 
sometimes them and one other person 
whom they are actually covering the 
expenses 
for. 
These 
are 
not 
our 
megabusinesses. These are our back-
bone small businesses. This is the 
truckdriver in Oklahoma. This is the 
piano teacher in Oklahoma. These are 
folks who are actually trying to be able 
to make a living the best way they 
know how. 
When it was passed in December, the 
Small Business Administration inter-
preted that rule to say you can only 
use your net expenses for that—your 
net expenses. Then, in March, the 
Small Business Administration rein-
terpreted that and said: No, you could 
use your gross expenses on that. 
Now, for a lot of folks, they would 
say: What is the difference on that? 
Well, the difference is usually about 
$5,000 or $10,000. That is an enormous 
difference. And for some folks in this 
room, $5,000 or $10,000 may not be very 
much, but it is a lot more for that 
truck driver and that piano teacher. 
So the logical thing for the Small 
Business Administration to do would 
be to say: OK. We changed the rule in 
March from what it was earlier so let’s 
make it retroactive. Then folks who 
apply early, the most desperate folks, 
could actually still get the difference. 
But that is not what happened. The 
Small Business Administration said: 
No, if you received the loan earlier, 
you received the smaller amount. If 
you waited and applied later, you get 
the larger amount. 
It is the exact same type of business, 
exact same situation, but basically the 
Small Business Administration said: 
This is too complicated to go back and 
redo this. So we will just allow folks 
who applied early, the most desperate, 
to get the least, and folks who applied 
later to get more. 
We are bringing an amendment that 
would just fix that and would allow the 
folks who applied early, the most des-
perate folks, to be able to get the same 
level of help as the folks that applied 
later. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that it be in order for me 
to offer my Amendment 1402. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there an objection? 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, 
let me thank the Senator from Okla-
homa for bringing this to the floor. 
Here is our challenge. If it gets onto 
the bill that we have before us, it will 
delay the continuation of the Paycheck 
Protection Program because it termi-
nates on March 31. We are not going to 
have any program to modify. And the 
House is not in session until the second 
week in April so it is not possible to 
get this done before the program ex-
pires. 
So, for that reason, we have to op-
pose any amendment on the underlying 
bill, which is a clean extension of the 
PPP. 
But I want to thank my friend from 
Oklahoma for bringing this forward be-
cause I agree with you. As chairman of 
the Small Business and Entrepreneur-
ship Committee, I support making the 
changes that the administration made 
in regard to the determination for self- 
employed retroactive. I think that is a 
fair thing to do. I also support making 
sure that the business structure that is 
chosen by a small business also quali-
fies, whether it be a partnership or a 
traditional business arrangement. 
I think we need to make those 
changes, and I know our staffs are 
working on the exact language. There 
is some challenge on how we draft the 
language. And you have my commit-
ment that we will work during this re-
cess, and I assure you that I want to 
see this done. I hope we can do it by UC 
when we return, when the House is in 
session, and get this done as quickly as 
possible. 
The point the Senator from Okla-
homa raises is very valid, but let me go 
back to the original bill for the self- 
employed that used, as you said, a for-
mula that didn’t work. In some cases, 
it was $50 or $80 that they got on the 
PPP, which was ridiculous because a 
self-employed person doesn’t have the 
same payroll expenses that a tradi-
tional small business has. 
We based the PPP calculations on 
the payroll amount. That didn’t apply 
to the self-employed. So that is why 
the gross receipts are the right way to 
make those calculations, and that is 
what we want to do. That is what this 
administration did in its recalculation, 
but it made it prospective only. It 
needs to be retroactive. 
So I agree with the gentleman, but I 
cannot consent to agree to it today. 
And it is not going to delay the Senate 
consideration of it because the House is 
not in session for the next 2 weeks. 
So the first time we can really get 
this done is the second week in April, 
and you have my commitment that we 
will work together to get the provision 
made retroactive and to cover the legal 
structures that are used by some of our 
small businesses that are not currently 
covered under the current interpreta-
tion—I think legal, this is a legal issue 
that we have to resolve. 
For all those reasons, I do object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
do want to thank my friend from Mary-
land. This is an important issue. It 
does need to be resolved. It has not had 
enough attention on this. As he and I 
talked about it the last several days, 
and several others joined in, this deals 
with partnerships, whether it be ag. 
This deals with individuals. 
So my friend from Kansas, he and I 
worked together on this to be able to 
combine a piece of legislation to make 
sure we are dealing with all types of 
businesses that will be affected, and I 
do hope to be able to get this through 
by unanimous consent in the days 
ahead to get this resolved as quickly as 
possible as well as continue to reach 
out to the Small Business Administra-
tion and to see what they can to do to 
be able to communicate with those 
folks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Kansas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1403 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed to complete my remarks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
thank the gentleman, my neighbor 
from Oklahoma, for yielding. And I 
thank the gentleman from Maryland, 
our chairman of the Small Business 
Committee, for his cooperation. 
Our amendment will allow farmers 
and ranchers categorized as a partner-
ship, including LLPs, S corps, to uti-
lize gross income when calculating 
their PPP maximum loan amount. 
It is no secret that our Nation’s 
farmers and ranchers have faced in-
credible 
difficulties 
through 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic when we literally 
couldn’t pay people to come get our 
cattle and hogs. In December, we made 
changes to allow farmers to use gross 
income in calculating their PPP loan. 
Before it passed, the payments were 
based on farmers’ net income. This net 
income number is often low or negative 
because of the amount of depreciation 
farmers claim on equipment. These 
changes were helpful and provided as-
sistance for much of the agriculture in-
dustry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1795 
March 25, 2021 
Unfortunately, 
certain 
farm 
and 
ranch partnerships, many of which are 
small family partnerships, were left 
out of changes made in the program in 
December. I believe Congress intended 
to include partnerships; however, the 
SBA, 
interpreting 
the 
statute 
we 
passed, did not. They made it crystal 
clear, short of legislation, they would 
not include partnerships under this 
new interpretation. 
My amendment, in a nutshell, would 
let farmers categorized as a partner-
ship use gross income rather than net 
income for the PPP loan. I encourage 
all my colleagues to support this 
amendment and help our farmers dur-
ing this difficult time. 
I yield back to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma. Thank you. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that there be two minutes of de-
bate, equally divided, before each vote 
in today’s series. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1401 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
without order, there can be no justice. 
We all know that. Without order, there 
can be no justice. 
This past year, we have seen felony 
rioting throughout the United States. 
It doesn’t matter whether that felony 
rioting happened here at the Capitol. It 
doesn’t matter whether it happened in 
Portland or Chicago or Atlanta or at 
any of our other wonderful commu-
nities throughout the United States. It 
is wrong, and we have all condemned 
it. It should be punished, and it cer-
tainly shouldn’t be rewarded. 
My amendment is very simple. It 
says that if you were one of those riot-
ers and you have received due process, 
you have been convicted by a court of 
law of competent jurisdiction, and you 
have been adjudged to have committed 
a felony with respect to a riot or civil 
disorder in the past 2 years, then you 
cannot participate in the PPP pro-
gram. We already have that law at the 
SBA for disaster loans. This would ex-
tend it to the PPP program. 
What you allow is what will con-
tinue. What you allow is what will con-
tinue, and that is why I would respect-
fully ask consideration for my amend-
ment. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. I rise in opposition to 
the Kennedy amendment. 
Let me be clear. Any amendment 
that is put on this clean extension will 
mean that the program will terminate 
in less than 1 week, and hundreds of 
thousands of small businesses will not 
be able to get their PPP loans. These 
are newly eligible. We changed the cal-
culations on how much you can apply 
for. Those who have difficulty finding a 
financial institution to write the for-
givable loan, those in hard-to-serve 
communities, all are going to be de-
nied. The SBA has indicated there are 
hundreds of thousands of eligible appli-
cants that have not been able to get in 
by the due date. 
Now, in regard to the Kennedy 
amendment, the SBA COVID–19 relief 
is for existing businesses and current 
business owners with proven reentry 
track records. Anyone who has rebuilt 
their life after being incarcerated 
should be celebrated and supported. 
There is no reason why a business 
owned by someone with an unrelated 
criminal record should be treated any 
differently. 
I would urge my colleagues, for the 
sake of getting this bill to the Presi-
dent and signed so we can help our 
small businesses, to reject the Kennedy 
amendment. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I 
have left? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. No time remaining. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask unani-
mous consent for another 30 seconds? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
this is the third time I have brought 
this amendment—the third time. 
Now, you either approve of the riot-
ing that happened this summer and at 
the Capitol or you don’t. The riots this 
summer killed 47 people. There was 
well over $1 billion worth of damage. 
No. 2, I can’t help it if Speaker 
PELOSI has decided to go home, which 
prevents us from offering amendments 
to make this bill better. We all support 
extension of the PPP program, but this 
is not right, and it would be a lot more 
intellectually honest if my colleague, 
who opposed my amendment, said: 
Look, we just don’t think that if you 
rioted you should be punished with re-
spect to the PPP program, because 
that is what a ‘‘no’’ vote is saying. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Time has expired. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 30 seconds to re-
spond. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
The 
gentleman’s 
amendment goes well beyond that. The 
gentleman’s amendment goes back 2 
years. It could have been a civil dis-
turbance on a college campus if some-
one now has an existing business to-
tally unrelated to any economic crime. 
It is just something that should not be 
in this law, and I urge my colleagues to 
reject it. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to ask 
my colleague for 30 more seconds. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
just wanted to read the language to 
you. It says that you are prohibited 
from getting a PPP loan if you have 
been convicted of a felony in relation 
to a riot or a civil disorder in the past 
2 years. You either support violence or 
you don’t. 
Madam President, I would like to ask 
that my amendment, Kennedy amend-
ment No. 1401, be called up. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KENNEDY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1401. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that we dis-
pense with the reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit paycheck protection 
program loans and second draw loans for 
applicants convicted of a felony in relation 
to a riot or civil disorder during the 2-year 
period preceding the date of the applica-
tion) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. PROHIBITION ON PAYCHECK PROTEC-
TION PROGRAM LOANS AND SECOND 
DRAW LOANS FOR APPLICANTS CON-
VICTED OF A FELONY IN RELATION 
TO A RIOT OR CIVIL DISORDER. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 7(a) of the Small 
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)) is amended—

riot or civil disorder during the 2-year period 
preceding the date of the application.’’; and 
(2) in paragraph (37), by adding at the end

The amendment (No.1401) was re-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1405 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 1405 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the clerk will report the 
amendment by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO], for 
himself and others, proposes an amendment 
numbered 1405. 
The amendment is as follows 
(Purpose: To establish appropriate limita-
tions on the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration establishing new 
priorities for processing lender applica-
tions) 
On page 2, between lines 15 and 16, insert 
the following: 
(d) LIMITATION ON PRIORITIZATION.—During 
the period beginning on the date of enact-
ment of this Act and ending on the last day 
of the covered period, as defined in section 
7(a)(36)(A)(iii) of the Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 636(a)(36)(A)(iii)), as amended by this 
Act, the Administrator of the Small Busi-
ness Administration may not establish or en-
force any priority for processing lender ap-
plications under paragraph (36) or (37) of sec-
tion 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
636(a)), except for any priority reasonably 
necessary to carry out the set-asides estab-
lished under section 323(d) of the Economic 
Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Non-
profits, and Venues Act (title III of division 
N of Public Law 116–260). 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the very 
reason we even have to do an extension 
is that the new administration has un-
fairly and unnecessarily restricted eli-
gible businesses and nonprofits from 
applying. It has created confusion. 
People haven’t been able to get in by 
the deadlines, and unless we put in 
more guardrails, there is little assur-
ance that this is not going to continue. 
In particular, the one thing that would 
undermine this popular, bipartisan pro-
gram is if people came to the conclu-
sion that it was being used arbitrarily 
to give priority to politically favored 
groups. 
So all this amendment does is pro-
hibit the Small Business Administra-
tion from setting up any new set-asides 
beyond those that this Congress, on a 
bipartisan basis, already created last 
year when we passed this at the end of 
2020. 
What were those priorities? Smaller 
businesses, businesses in low-income 
areas, community financial institu-
tions. All it says is, if you want to 
change those priorities, Congress has 
to do it, not the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the Rubio amendment. 
The policy that Senator RUBIO is ob-
jecting to is implemented by the Small 
Business Administration to help the 
underserved communities. 
During that 14-day period, 400,000 
small businesses with 20 employees or 
less were able, at long last, to get PPP 
help. And almost half were first-time 
borrowers under the PPP program, 
those that had been shut out in the 
past. 
But, specifically, the Rubio amend-
ment, if it were adopted—and it is 
wrong policy—would require the House 
to concur. The House is not in session 
for 2 weeks. That could take us beyond 
the 31st of March, and the program 
would end, costing hundreds of thou-
sands of small businesses the oppor-
tunity that—some are now eligible for 
the first time; some are trying to fig-
ure out the calculations. 
So for all those reasons—and one last 
point: The Chamber of Commerce of 
the United States urges all of us to 
vote in favor of the underlying bill and 
oppose any amendment that would de-
rail the expeditious approval of this 
measure. 
Let’s follow the Chamber’s advice. 
Let’s vote down the Rubio amendment.

The amendment (No. 1405) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in 2010, 
Congress passed what is known as pay- 
go. Pay-go was signed into law and re-
quires that if you want to spend new 
money, you have to spend for it, hence 
the name ‘‘pay as you go.’’ 
The idea was that if you wanted to 
spend money on something, you would 
either need to cut spending or raise 
taxes, but you couldn’t just simply bor-
row more money. And if you don’t cut 
something, the cuts would be auto-
matic. Except we have now waived pay- 
go 60 times since we passed pay-go. 
Debt has gone from $13.5 trillion to $30 
trillion because Congress continues to 
evade the rules they put in place. 
It brings us back to the $1.9 trillion 
spending bill the other side just passed. 
They want to now waive the pay-go 
rule. This will be the 61st time to waive 
pay-go. 
Some 
will 
say 
that 
Republicans 
didn’t seem to care about the debt 
when they voted to cut taxes. However, 
honest observers will note that I also 
forced a vote on pay-go when we cut 
taxes. Interestingly, every Democrat in 
this body at that time voted to evade 
the pay-go rules and add taxes to the 
deficit, as I am sure they will today. 
So do deficits matter? The answer is 
a resounding yes. There is no free 
money. When we borrow or print new 
money, that money must be repaid. We 
have racked up nearly $30 trillion in 
debt. That is almost 150 percent of our 
entire economy. We borrow $6.6 million 
every minute. Get that. We borrow 
$6.6— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent 
to have 1 minute to conclude my re-
marks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1797 
March 25, 2021 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PAUL. The deficit has gone from 
$3 trillion last year; it will be $3.5 tril-
lion this year. 
In Washington, every day is a good 
day to spend money. Big spenders like 
to say the Federal Government is no 
different than a family budget. We 
have the Federal Reserve that can 
print money to buy our debt, but all 
that does is cause inflation. Even with 
inflation not spiking, we have lost 17 
percent of the dollar over the last sev-
eral years. 
Who is responsible for the $30 trillion 
debt? Republicans? Democrats? The an-
swer is yes and yes. Both parties are to 
blame. The vote I have called for is a 
litmus test for fiscal responsibility. 
Anyone who cares about the debt 
should vote to enforce the pay-go rule. 
According to the CBO, the bill before 
us will increase the deficit by $15 bil-
lion in fiscal year 2021; therefore, I 
raise a point of order against the meas-
ure pursuant to section 404(a) of S. 
Con. Res. 13 of the 111th Congress. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have 
been advised by the administration 
there is an excess of $50 billion avail-
able at the end of this month for the 
extension. So pursuant to section 904 of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
the waiver provisions of applicable 
budget resolutions in section 4(g)(3) of 
the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 
2010, I move to waive all applicable sec-
tions of those acts and applicable budg-
et resolutions for purpose of the pend-
ing measure, and I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

firmative, the motion is agreed to. 
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent for 6 minutes, 3 minutes 
equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PAUL. Since the implementation 
of PPP last April, 38 Planned Parent-
hood affiliates applied for and received 
$80 million in taxpayer funds meant for 
small business relief. 
Pursuant to the longstanding affili-
ation rules, which stipulate that affili-
ated organizations are considered one 
organization, the Small Business Ad-
ministration found that Planned Par-
enthood was ineligible for PPP funds 
and sent letters to each of the 38 orga-
nizations 
that 
wrongfully 
received 
funds. 
After months of delay, though, SBA 
finally revealed that they have now 
given secondary loans to more Planned 
Parenthood organizations. These ap-
provals come long after the SBA had 
determined that the initial ones were 
illegal. 
Further extending the PPP program 
could allow all 49 Planned Parenthood 
affiliates time to access both the first 
or second draw of PPP loans, given the 
Biden administration’s apparent recent 
actions. 
I urge everyone who believes that 
taxpayers should not be forced to pay 
for abortion to vote no. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I 
want to thank Senator COLLINS for her 
leadership on this issue. I want to 
thank Senator SHAHEEN for her help in 
getting this done. 
This bill is widely supported. It 
passed the House by 415 to 3, supported 
by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the 
NFIB, 
and 
numerous 
other 
stake-
holders in small business. 
It will be 1 year since the passage of 
the CARES Act, and the PPP program 
has saved millions of small businesses 
from being shuttered. It has helped 
save our unemployment insurance sys-
tem by keeping small-employer em-
ployees on the payroll. It has kept 
workforce together for small busi-
nesses, which is critically important to 
get through this pandemic. 
Small 
businesses 
need 
additional 
time because we have changed the eli-
gibility, we have changed the calcula-
tion, and you have to find private 
banks that are willing to take on this 
loan. And we are now into a second 
round. There is over $50 billion avail-
able at the end of this month to con-
tinue the program. 
I would urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
I would yield the remainder of our 
time to Senator COLLINS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to urge my colleagues to support pas-
sage of H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension 
Act of 2021. It is imperative that we act 
immediately to pass this bill because 
we are just days away from the PPP 
being closed to applications for assist-
ance. This bill mirrors legislation I in-
troduced with my colleagues, Senators 
CARDIN and SHAHEEN, which is cospon-
sored by Senators MARSHALL, SUL-
LIVAN, 
ROSEN, 
MURKOWSKI, 
LEAHY, 
WYDEN, 
TILLIS, 
OSSOFF, 
CAPITO, 
MERKLEY, HEINRICH, PORTMAN, KLO-
BUCHAR, and MANCHIN. 
Last March, Senators RUBIO, CARDIN, 
SHAHEEN, and I crafted the Paycheck 
Protection Program, PPP—a forgivable 
loan program designed to help keep 
small employers afloat and their em-
ployees paid during the pandemic. 
The bipartisan bill we are consid-
ering today would simply extend the 
current application deadline for new 
PPP loans from March 31 to May 31 of 
this year and then provide an addi-
tional 30-day period during which time 
the Small Business Administration 
may continue processing applications 
received prior to the new May 31 dead-
line. This bipartisan bill passed the 
House last week by an overwhelming 
margin of 415 to 3. 
The PPP has been a lifeline for small 
businesses in Maine and across the 
country, providing the support they 
need to survive the pandemic and con-
tinue paying their employees. In 2020, 
more than 5 million small employers 
received forgivable PPP loans, helping 
to sustain upwards of 50 million Amer-
ican jobs. This included more than 
28,000 Maine small businesses, which 
received nearly $2.3 billion in forgiv-
able PPP loans. The average loan size 
in Maine during this time was $80,000. 
Recognizing the importance of this 
program for our Nation’s small em-
ployers, the bipartisan December 2020 
COVID-relief law provided an addi-
tional $284.5 billion to reopen the Pay-
check Protection Program and allow 
the hardest hit small employers to re-
ceive a second forgivable loan. The De-
cember law also made other improve-
ments to the PPP, such as expanding 
forgivable overhead expenses to include 
supplier costs and investments in facil-
ity modifications and personal protec-
tive equipment needed to operate safe-
ly. 
Since reopening in January, more 
than 3.1 million additional forgivable 
loans—totaling nearly $196 billion— 
have been approved for small busi-
nesses across the country. In Maine, 
more than 12,700 small employers have

been approved for $797 million in for-
givable loans since PPP’s reopening. In 
total, Maine small employers have 
been approved for upwards of $3 billion 
in forgivable loans since the program 
was created last year. 
I have heard from numerous small 
employers about the impact this pro-
gram has had on them and their em-
ployees. The PPP has helped the own-
ers 
of 
Pottle 
Transportation 
in 
Hermon, Anglers Restaurants in Hamp-
den, and the Harraseeket Inn in Free-
port keep their businesses alive and 
their employees paid. Hodgdon, Amer-
ica’s oldest boat builder, was able to 
keep its family-owned East Boothbay 
business in operation with the help of 
two forgivable PPP loans. The owner of 
Channel X Radio in Aroostook County 
told me that two forgivable PPP loans 
kept his business going. The Boys & 
Girls Clubs of Southern Maine and the 
Y in Bangor have been able to provide 
childcare and other services to children 
due to support from the PPP. 
With the ongoing distribution of 
COVID–19 vaccines and reopening of 
our Nation’s economy, I am hopeful 
that better times will soon be ahead. 
We are not there yet, which is why we 
need to extend the deadline to apply 
for new PPP loans. Extending the dead-
line would provide more time for the 
Small Business Administration to re-
solve error messages generated by its 
computer systems that prevented eligi-
ble small businesses from receiving ap-
proval for a PPP Loan. It would also 
give us more time to address an in-
equity facing certain sole proprietors 
who received their PPP loans before 
the Biden administration unexpectedly 
announced a change in the maximum 
loan amount calculation for these 
types of businesses. 
By extending the PPP for another 2 
months and then providing an addi-
tional 30 days after that time for the 
SBA to process applications that are 
still pending, the bill before us today 
would help our Nation’s small employ-
ers retain access to forgivable PPP 
loans. 
This bill has been endorsed by more 
than 90 organizations, including the 
National Federation of Independent 
Business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
American Hotel & Lodging Associa-
tion, International Franchise Associa-
tion, National Restaurant Association, 
the U.S. Travel Association, and the 
Independent Community Bankers of 
America. I would ask unanimous con-
sent that these letters of support be 
printed in the RECORD at the conclu-
sion of my statement. 
I would like to once again thank my 
colleagues, Senators CARDIN and SHA-
HEEN, for partnering with me on this 
legislation, and Senator RUBIO
for 
working to craft the PPP and oversee 
its implementation. I look forward to 
working with them and the new admin-
istrator of the Small Business Admin-
istration to ensure that the PPP is im-
plemented according to Congressional 
intent. 
I urge my colleagues to support pas-
sage of this bill. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, March 15, 2021. 
Hon. SUSAN COLLINS, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. BEN CARDIN, 
Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Small 
Business, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR COLLINS, CHAIRMAN CARDIN, 
AND SENATOR SHAHEEN: On behalf of the Con-
sumer Bankers Association (CBA), I write to 
express our support of S. 723, The PPP Ex-
tension Act of 2021. I thank you for your con-
tinued leadership as our nation rises to meet 
the challenges posed by the COVID–19 crisis. 
CBA commends the work of Congress, the 
Small Business Administration (SBA), and 
all the lenders across the country who to-
gether worked dutifully to make the Pay-
check Protection Program (PPP) a reality 
and provide much needed relief to millions of 
small businesses. 
Lenders remain committed to serve their 
small business customers and have engaged 
considerable resources to process PPP loan 
applications so they can ensure our nation’s 
small businesses have the support they need 
to endure these challenging economic times. 
Unfortunately, operational changes made by 
SBA during this current round of PPP lend-
ing has slowed the funding of PPP loan ap-
plications. 
With just weeks before the program sun-
sets, our members are working tirelessly to 
resolve complications with the processing 
and approval of PPP applications. Issues 
flagged during SBA’s processing of applica-
tions, such as loan hold and error codes, con-
tinue to be major hurdles for successful PPP 
funding. Despite lenders’ efforts to work 
with their customers and the SBA to quickly 
resolve them, these issues continue to sig-
nificantly delay the funding of requests to 
businesses that have very pressing financial 
concerns. This, coupled with the recent 
changes by the SBA allowing Schedule C bor-
rowers to qualify for more PPP relief, makes 
it imperative that more time is provided. 
Extending the PPP and providing a window 
for lenders and the SBA to process received 
applications will ensure any small business 
that wants access to the program is able to 
do so. The PPP Extension Act of 2021 will 
provide the SBA, lenders, and small busi-
nesses the critical time that is needed to 
properly implement recent alterations to the 
program and resolve any outstanding proc-
essing issues, ultimately allowing small 
businesses to fully realize the benefits of the 
PPP. 
Again, thank you for your time and consid-
eration on these important matters. CBA 
and our members remain eager to work with 
Congress and the SBA to help small busi-
nesses in these uncertain economic times. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD HUNT, 
President and CEO, 
Consumer Bankers Association.

DEAR SENATORS CARDIN, COLLINS AND SHA-
HEEN
AND
REPRESENTATIVES
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
LUETKEMEYER, BOURDEAUX AND KIM: The un-
dersigned organizations are writing to thank 
you for your bicameral leadership and swift 
bipartisan action to provide relief to Amer-
ica’s small businesses through this economic 
emergency. We strongly support the PPP Ex-
tension Act of 2021, which will extend the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Pay-
check Protection Program (PPP) application 
period beyond the March 31, 2021 sunset date. 
While we realize the Small Business Ad-
ministration (SBA) is under tremendous 
time constraints and is struggling with in-
ternal resource issues, our members are 
highly concerned by the lack of progress on 
major Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 
processing issues, including hold/error codes 
and application rejections due to Taxpayer 
Identification Number (‘‘TIN’’) issues or 
mismatches, in addition to many unresolved 
technical problems with the current PPP 
process. These delays and denials may put 
many applicants in danger of not making the 
March 31st authorization deadline. 
Nearly one year into the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the continued liquidity challenges of 
the small business sector are acute, espe-
cially for those business limited by dramatic 
capacity 
restrictions 
and 
other 
critical 
health and safety protocols in place to pro-
tect the public, consumers and workers from 
COVID–19. Thank you for extending the win-
dow of opportunity for pandemic programs 
to effectively impact the affected small busi-
ness sector, especially those traditionally 
under-invested 
and 
underserved 
groups 
which must also be given the chance to suc-
ceed. 
We stand ready to work with you during 
this critical moment, and thank you for con-
sidering our views.

INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY 
BANKERS OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, March 16, 2021. 
Hon. BEN CARDIN, 
Chairman, Committee on Small Business & En-
trepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. SUSAN COLLINS, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN CARDIN AND SENATORS COL-
LINS AND SHAHEEN: On behalf of community 
banks across the country, with more than 
50,000 locations, I write to thank you for in-
troducing the PPP Extension Act of 2021 (S. 
723). This legislation is needed to ensure that 
thousands of Paycheck Protection Program 
applicants—small businesses, churches, and 
other non-profit employers—are not stranded 
by an abrupt shutdown of the Program and 
would do so using funds that have already 
been appropriated. 
Community banks are doing everything in 
their power to complete and submit PPP ap-
plications to the SBA before the March 31 
deadline. Unfortunately, they have no assur-
ances that qualified applications submitted 
timely will be approved. The CARES Act 
does not allow for approval of applications 
after March 31, regardless of when they were 
submitted and the quality of the applica-
tions. Unless a statutory change is made, 
thousands of applications will be rejected 
simply because the clock has run out. 
This outcome would be especially unfair 
because of the thousands of applications 
have been in limbo at the SBA for weeks be-
cause they were flagged and put on hold by 
an automated program for possible waste, 
fraud, or abuse. These applications require 
SBA review in order to be cleared of holds 
and approved for funding. If they cannot be 
cleared by March 31, cash starved applicants 
and the people they employ will be denied 
access to funds they had anticipated and 
planned for. We do not believe this outcome 
was intended by Congress. 
The PPP Extension Act would resolve this 
problem by extending the application dead-
line until May 31 and creating a second dead-
line of June 30 for SBA approval. This will 
give applicants more time, and the two- 
tiered deadline will ensure the Program does 
not end abruptly. 
ADDITIONAL CHANGES NEEDED TO ENSURE 
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PPP FUNDS 
Any extension of the deadline will give 
Congress the opportunity to refine and im-
prove the Program rules and formulas to en-
sure equitable distribution of funds to those 
borrowers that can make the best use of 
them. ICBA urges Congress and the SBA to 
make fixes to resolve the problems identified 
below. 
First Draw Increase Eligibility. Certain 
borrowers who have not yet filed for and re-
ceived forgiveness of their first draw 2020 
PPP loan may apply for an increase in that 
loan. However, borrowers whose first draw 
2020 loans have already been forgiven cannot 
apply for a first draw loan increase, even if 
they otherwise meet the criteria for an in-
crease. This is unfair because it punishes 
borrowers who filed forgiveness applications 
early. The statute should be amended to 
allow borrowers who have received first draw 
loan forgiveness to be eligible to receive a 
first draw loan increase. 
Second Draw Eligibility. Those applying 
for a first draw in 2021 should be allowed ac-
cess to a second draw. Community bankers 
have solicited and received numerous appli-
cations for first draw loans in 2021. In many 
cases, these applicants would have applied 
for first draw loans in 2020, if they had the 
benefit of better information and advice, and 
would now be eligible for second draw loans. 
They have effectively left money on the 
table that could be used for critical expendi-
tures. 
Second Draw Use of Proceeds Requirement. 
Borrowers with a modest shortfall in using 
first draw dollars for eligible purposes 
shouldn’t be shut out from second draw 
loans, especially if they’ve already repaid 
the remaining balance on the first draw loan. 
Congress should consider creating a percent-
age-based de minimis test to define a level of 
spending on ineligible expenses that would 
not disqualify a borrower for a second draw 
loan. 
Farm Partnerships. Current law allows 
self-employed farmers and ranchers that re-
port farm income on Schedule F to use the 
gross income method, rather than the net in-
come method, to calculate their maximum 
loan amount and owner’s compensation. 
However, SBA has limited this treatment to 
1040 Schedule F filers. It is not available to 
thousands of self-employed farmers and 
ranchers whose businesses are organized as 
partnerships or S corporations. Congress 
should direct the SBA to make the gross in-
come method available to these farmers and 
ranchers. 
Schedule C Borrowers. Schedule C filers 
should be able to apply for an increase under 
new SBA rules that allow Schedule C bor-
rowers with no employees to use gross in-
come rather than net profit to determine the 
loan amount. This is a welcome change, but 
those borrowers who have already obtained 
loans have no opportunity to apply for an in-
crease based on the new rules. They may 
qualify for significantly larger loans but are 
effectively being punished for submitting 
their applications early. 
Save Our Stages Applicants. Live action 
venues eligible for Save Our Stages grants 
should be allowed to apply for PPP loans 
while waiting to find out if they will receive 
a grant. If such a venue eventually does re-
ceive a grant, the amount of the grant could 
be reduced by the amount of the PPP loan, 
thereby avoiding the double dipping prohib-
ited by the statute. 
Thank you again for introducing the PPP 
Extension Act. We look forward to working 
with you to advance this important legisla-
tion. We urge you to use this opportunity to 
address the problems with the Program dis-
cussed above. 
Sincerely, 
REBECA ROMERO RAINEY, 
President & CEO. 
NFIB, 
March 25, 2021. 
DEAR SENATOR: On behalf of NFIB, the na-
tion’s leading small business advocacy orga-
nization, I write in support of H.R. 1799, the 
PPP Extension Act of 2021, which will extend 
authorization for the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP) beyond March 31, 2021. H.R. 
1799 will be considered an NFIB Key Vote for 
the 117th Congress. 
NFIB research indicates economic condi-
tions remain challenging for our nation’s 
small businesses. According to NFIB’s latest 
monthly survey, small business optimism re-
mains below its historic 47-year average. 
Small business owners expecting better busi-
ness conditions over the next six months re-
mains at a net negative 19%, a poor reading. 
Moreover, the economic recovery continues 
to be uneven for small businesses, especially 
those still managing state and local regula-
tions and restrictions, with 15% recently re-
porting that they will have to close their 
doors if current economic conditions do not 
improve over the next six months. 
Many small business owners are con-
tinuing to evaluate their financial needs as 
they assess the future of government restric-
tions on their businesses as well as progress 
in controlling the COVID–19 pandemic. Un-
fortunately, the timeframe for making deci-
sions regarding a first or second draw PPP 
loan after passage of the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act of 2021 has been short, particu-
larly as Congress and the Administration 
have recently made additional changes to 
the program. 
For these reasons and given the high level 
of uncertainty over future economic condi-
tions, it makes sense to extend the author-
ization of the PPP program through May 31, 
2021 to give small businesses additional time 
to consider their needs and apply. NFIB is 
also pleased that this legislation will provide 
an additional 30 days for SBA to process 
pending applications, which will help to en-
sure small businesses are not unfairly 
harmed by PPP processing delays, which 
continue to pose a challenge to the program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1800 
March 25, 2021 
NFIB supports H.R. 1799, the PPP Exten-
sion Act of 2021 and will consider final pas-
sage of the legislation as an NFIB Key Vote 
for the 117th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN KUHLMAN, 
Vice President, 
Federal Government Relations, NFIB. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge 
all of our colleagues to vote yes on this 
bill, which will provide a crucial 2- 
month extension for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. 
This program has been a lifeline to 
countless small businesses and has 
saved more than 50 million jobs in this 
country. 
I 
salute 
my 
colleagues 
Senator 
CARDIN and Senator SHAHEEN for their 
work on this extension, which was 
overwhelmingly passed by the House. 
Let’s talk about briefly what would 
happen if we do not act. If we do not 
act, there are approximately 190,000 
loans still under review, which pre-
vents any of these businesses from re-
ceiving a second PPP loan. These small 
businesses need this assistance now in 
order to pay their employees and stay 
afloat during this pandemic. 
We cannot wait. The House has gone 
home. We cannot allow an interruption 
of this vital program that has made 
such a difference to our small busi-
nesses and their employees. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this 2-month extension, with an addi-
tional month for SBA to review the ap-
plications. 
VOTE ON H.R. 1799 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is

PREVENTING ACROSS-THE-BOARD 
DIRECT SPENDING CUTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 1868; that the Shaheen- 
Collins substitute amendment No. 1410 
and the Scott of Florida amendment 
No. 1411 be made pending and reported 
by number; further, that the Senate 
vote in relation to the Scott amend-
ment and the substitute, that upon dis-
position of the amendments, the bill be 
considered read a third time, the Sen-
ate vote on passage of the bill as 
amended, if amended, with 60 affirma-
tive votes required for passage; further, 
that there be 2 minutes for debate, 
equally divided, prior to each vote; and 
finally, that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table, all with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The 
Senator 
from 
Indiana. 
Mr. 
BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving the 
right to object, I rise today to ask sup-
port of this body to fix a problem in 
the American Rescue Plan, a bill that 
was passed in a rushed manner with no 
input from Republicans. 
I do not rise today to debate the un-
derlying bill, although there could be 
plenty to debate about it, but to make 
the point we can multitask and address 
more than one time-sensitive issue at a 
time. 
We need to protect senior citizens 
and ensure we aren’t making cuts to a 
vital program like Medicare, and today 
we will do that. 
But we have another issue that we 
can address today as well. 
In the American Rescue Plan, Demo-
crats punished red States, like Indiana, 
for keeping unemployment low, by tak-
ing a smart approach to COVID, by bal-
ancing public safety with the economy. 
Now they want to tell States that 
they can’t cut taxes through 2024, de-
spite being good stewards day in and 
day out of taxpayer money over the 
past year. 
This provision is so troubling that 21 
State AGs sent a letter to the Treasury 
raising the following concerns about 
the tax cut prohibition: 
It imposes an ambiguous condition 
on Federal funding; it results in Fed-
eral conditions that don’t relate to the 
Federal interest for which the program 
was established; it violates separation 
of powers and fundamental democratic 
principles and effectively commandeers 
half of the States’ fiscal ledgers; and, 
ultimately, it is unconstitutionally co-
ercive. 
Treasury said last week that States 
can still cut their taxes; they just can’t 
use American Rescue Plan money to do 
it. But Governors and State legisla-
tures are still confused. 
One midwestern attorney general has 
asked a Federal judge to block the tax 
cut prohibition. Multiple tax profes-
sionals and outside groups say there 
are many questions still left unan-
swered. 
We can stop this entire mess by 
adopting 
my 
amendment, 
the 
Let 
States Cut Taxes Act, an amendment 
to stop the Federal Government’s un-
constitutional overreach on States’ 
rights. 
Therefore, I ask that the Senator 
modify his request to include my 
amendment, which is at the desk, and 
that following disposition of the Scott 
amendment, the Senate vote on my 
amendment with a 60-affirmative-vote 
threshold for adoption. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object. 
I have a statement to make. 
Last week, my friend from Indiana 
and I were last down here discussing 
this issue. 
There seemed to be a lot of confusion 
about the Treasury—or how the Treas-
ury would interpret the net tax rev-
enue provision. There seemed to be a 
fear that this language would prevent 
States from cutting any taxes whatso-
ever. 
And the good news is that we re-
ceived some guidance earlier this week 
from Secretary Yellen that should put 
those concerns to bed once and for all. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
letter from Secretary Yellen. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, 
Washington, DC, March 23, 2021. 
Hon. MARK BRNOVICH, 
Attorney General, State of Arizona, 
Phoenix, AZ. 
DEAR
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
BRNOVICH: I 
write in reply to your March 16, 2021 letter 
regarding Treasury’s implementation of sec-
tion 9901 of the American Rescue Plan Act 
(the ‘‘Act’’), which provides funds to States, 
territories, Tribal governments, and local-
ities to help them manage the economic con-
sequences of COVID–19. 
In the Act, Congress has provided funding 
to help States manage the public health and 
economic consequences of COVID–19 and it 
has given States considerable flexibility to 
use that money to address the diverse needs 
of their communities. At the same time, 
Congress placed limitations to ensure that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1801 
March 25, 2021 
the money is used to achieve those pur-
poses—including provisions stating that this 
funding may not be used to offset a reduc-
tion in net tax revenue resulting from cer-
tain changes in state law. 
It is well established that Congress may 
place such reasonable conditions on how 
States may use federal funding. Congress in-
cludes those sorts of reasonable funding con-
ditions in legislation routinely, including 
with respect to funding for Medicaid, edu-
cation, and highways. Here, the Act provides 
a broad outlay of federal funds, and accord-
ingly includes restrictions to ensure that 
those funds are properly applied. Earlier 
COVID–19 relief measures providing state 
funding 
also 
included 
restrictions 
that 
barred States from spending those funds on 
certain ineligible expenditures. 
Nothing in the Act prevents States from 
enacting a broad variety of tax cuts. That is, 
the Act does not ‘‘deny States the ability to 
cut taxes in any manner whatsoever.’’ It 
simply provides that funding received under 
the Act may not be used to offset a reduction 
in net tax revenue resulting from certain 
changes in state law. If States lower certain 
taxes but do not use funds under the Act to 
offset those cuts—for example, by replacing 
the lost revenue through other means—the 
limitation in the Act is not implicated. 
It is also important to note that States 
choosing to use the federal funds to offset a 
reduction in net tax revenue do not thereby 
forfeit their entire allocation of funds appro-
priated under this statute. The limitation af-
fects States’ ability to retain only those fed-
eral funds used to offset a reduction in net 
tax revenue resulting from certain changes 
in state law. 
Treasury is crafting further guidance—in-
cluding guidance to address more specifi-
cally the issues raised by your letter and the 
procedures Treasury will use for any future 
recoupment—that will provide additional in-
formation about how this provision will be 
administered. We will provide this guidance 
before a State must submit a certification 
under 602(d)(1). We also expect to engage in 
an ongoing dialogue throughout the pro-
gram. 
These funds will provide transformative re-
lief to States, territories, and Tribal govern-
ments, and our communities should be able 
to use the funds to recover from the eco-
nomic fallout due to the pandemic, which is 
what Congress intended. I hope to work with 
your State, as well as others across the 
country, to ensure these funds can be used in 
ways that align with the goals of the statute 
without undue restrictions. 
Sincerely, 
JANET L. YELLEN. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I will 
enter this letter into the RECORD, but I 
would like to read the key sentences. 
And to the Senator from Indiana, if I 
could read this letter to you and to 
make sure that—I don’t know how—I 
have spoken to my attorney general, 
who was one of the original cosigners, 
and I said: Mr. Attorney General, I 
want to explain this in English because 
it is very easy to understand. It says 
this: 
Nothing in the Act prevents States from 
enacting a broad variety of tax cuts. 
Do whatever you want. 
That is, the Act does not ‘‘deny States the 
ability to cut taxes in any manner whatso-
ever.’’ 
This comes from the Secretary of 
Treasury. 
It simply provides that funding received 
under the Act may not be used to offset a re-
duction. . . . 
That you choose, unless it is COVID 
related. It makes all the sense in the 
world. It has to be COVID related. 
If States lower certain taxes but do not use 
funds under the Act to offset those cuts—for 
example, by replacing the lost revenue 
through other means—the limitation in the 
Act is not implicated. 
They can do whatever they want to. 
And if they can show other revenue to 
offset it, that is great. They just can-
not use the Treasury’s money that the 
people have invested in their States for 
that purpose. 
It also says this: 
It is . . . important to note that the States 
choosing to use the Federal funds to offset a 
reduction in net tax revenue do not thereby 
forfeit their entire allocation of funds appro-
priated under this statute. 
They have alluded to that, which is 
not accurate. 
The limitation affects States’ ability to re-
tain only those Federal funds used to offset 
a reduction in . . . tax revenue resulting 
from certain changes in [the] state law. 
That is it. That is not—and these are 
all supposed to be educated attorneys 
that are writing letters wanting expla-
nations. 
This is as common sense as it gets. It 
is a bipartisan guardrail to simply 
make sure the emergency funds make 
it to the people who need it most, and 
the States can do whatever they think 
they should do and could do. 
As a former Governor, I would have 
been offended if I thought it was ham-
pered. I am not. I have got to make 
good decisions here. I have other rev-
enue coming in. I want to cut this tax. 
That is fine. I just can’t cut a tax to be 
popular and then say: OK. Mr. Senators 
here, please send us money so we can 
be popular back home but use your 
money to make us look good. That is 
about it in a nutshell. 
So it is for those reasons, and many, 
many more, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. BRAUN. Reserving the right to 
object, coming from the world of busi-
ness, I have been dismayed by Washing-
ton’s inability to fix problems in a 
timely, rational manner, and that has 
been over a stretch of many years be-
fore I got here. 
I do, respectfully, disagree with my 
friend from West Virginia. We should 
fix this tax cut prohibition right now 
that was forced into the American Res-
cue Plan in the wee hours of the morn-
ing. 
If we want to fix a commonsense 
problem, we are being told that our 
only choice is to hold Hoosier seniors 
hostage. This is the most deliberative 
body in the world; this cannot be the 
best the Senate has to offer. 
We must get the Federal Government 
out of the way and stop complicating 
and confusing States. They should be 
allowed to do their jobs. 
And, by the way, they do their jobs— 
balancing their budgets every year, liv-
ing within their means. Most of the 
rest of the country accepts that as 
well. 
Given the looming April 1 deadline 
for cuts to return to Medicare, I am 
not willing to let Hoosier seniors suf-
fer. As a result, I will withdraw my 
amendment in the interest of seniors 
across Indiana. 
I look forward to working with the 
two leaders after the recess to fix this 
issue. I will not object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Under the previous order, the Senate 
will proceed to the consideration of 
H.R. 1868, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1868) to prevent across-the- 
board direct spending cuts, and for other 
purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the clerk will now 
report the amendments numbered 1410 
and 1411 by number.

AMENDMENT NO. 1411 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1410 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1411 to 
amendment No. 1410. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
Strike section 2(b). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to 
amendment No. 1411. 
The Senator from Florida is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
it must be nice to be the Speaker of the 
House. Speaker PELOSI gets to push 
around our new majority leader and 
my Democratic colleagues, and they 
get nothing in return. 
This bill is a bailout for Speaker 
PELOSI
and 
gives 
California’s 
healthcare system the ability to claim 
up to 175 percent of uncompensated 
care costs in their DSH Program while 
all the other States can only claim up 
to 100 percent of costs. 
How is that fair to Florida? 
How can the majority leader and my 
new colleagues from Georgia, Colorado, 
New Mexico, and Arizona justify a vote 
that is unfair to their States? Well, 
welcome to Pelosi’s U.S. Senate. 
Seriously, how can anyone in this 
body, except, perhaps, my two col-
leagues from California, possibly jus-
tify voting against this amendment? 
This is a very simple concept. All 50 
States should be treated equally. One 
State should not be given special treat-
ment over the others. This is a bailout 
for Speaker PELOSI, period. 
I want to be very clear. I oppose any 
cuts to Medicare benefits. So what I 
am offering protects Medicare benefits, 
and the only change it makes to this 
bill is to strip out this ridiculous 
Pelosi bailout. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that I have 
another 30 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. What I am of-
fering protects Medicare benefits, and 
the only change it makes to this bill is 
to strip out this ridiculous Pelosi bail-
out. 
A vote for my amendment is a vote 
to ensure that all 50 States play by the 
same rules. It is to preserve the cur-
rent law. 
A vote against my amendment is a 
vote to say that your State plays by 
the rules, but PELOSI gets her own set 
of rules. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California is recognized. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise in strong opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The bill before us today fixes a draft-
ing error from legislation enacted last 
December. The unintentional error oc-
curred accidentally against a long-
standing rule under which California is 
able to use Medicaid funding to reim-
burse hospitals serving uninsured and 
Medicaid patients. 
Today’s bill fixes that drafting error. 
It makes no other changes to law and 
does not provide additional funds to 
California or any other State. CBO 
says that this provision has no budg-
etary effect. 
Because of the sheer number of Med-
icaid and uninsured patients that re-
ceive care in California’s safety net 
hospitals, Congress, in 1997, granted 
the State additional flexibility. It can 
use Federal funds it receives to cover 
hospital expenses for those in need. 
If the Scott amendment passes, hos-
pital care for half of the children in 
California and the vulnerable popu-
lations most affected by COVID would 
be at risk. 
Please vote no on this amendment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1411 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the Scott 
amendment. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Nebraska (Mr. SASSE), the Sen-
ator from Kansas (Mr. MORAN), and the 
Senator from Mississippi (Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Kansas (Mr. MORAN) 
would have voted ‘‘yea’’ and the Sen-
ator from Nebraska (Mr. SASSE) would 
have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there 
any other Senators in the Chamber de-
siring to vote or to change their vote? 
The result was announced—yeas 47,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1803 
March 25, 2021 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come together and help en-
sure that our Nation’s hospitals, nurs-
ing 
homes, 
physicians, 
and 
other 
healthcare providers have the support 
they need to get through the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
This substitute amendment that Sen-
ator COLLINS and I are offering is a 
compromise that delays the Medicare 
payment cuts through December 31 and 
ensures that the cost of this delay is 
paid for. 
I hope you will support it. 
Senator COLLINS. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to support the Shaheen-Collins 
substitute to prevent a cut in Medicare 
reimbursements for hospitals, nursing 
homes, home health agencies and other 
healthcare providers who continue to 
care for their patients in this era of 
COVID. Congress twice last year sus-
pended the 2-percent Medicare seques-
ter in bipartisan COVID relief pack-
ages, and I hope we can do so once 
again. 
At a time when our country is rely-
ing so heavily on our healthcare pro-
viders to help get us back to normal, 
we cannot ignore the financial realities 
they face. Almost half—17 out of 36—of 
Maine hospitals finished last year with 
a negative operating margin. Accord-
ing to Northern Light Health in Maine, 
relief from the Medicare sequester 
amounts to $1 million per month. 
The Shaheen-Collins amendment will 
extend the current sequester morato-
rium until the end of the year. This fi-
nancial certainty is needed in these un-
certain times. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Shaheen-Collins substitute. 
Thank you. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1410 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment (No. 1410) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the bill is consid-
ered read a third time. 
The amendments were ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
are 2 minutes of debate. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to come together and 
help ensure that our Nation’s hos-
pitals, nursing homes, physicians, and 
other healthcare providers have the fi-
nancial support they need to get 
through the COVID–19 pandemic. 
On March 25, 2020, this body came to-
gether and passed the CARES Act, by a 
96–0 vote—exactly 1 year ago today. 
The CARES Act helped to provide the 
resources needed to ramp up testing 
and vaccine development, ensure that 
small businesses would have support to 
continue to pay their workers, and pro-
vide much-needed financial relief for 
healthcare providers on the frontlines 
of this pandemic. 
A year later, we can start to see the 
light at the end of the very long tunnel 
that is this public health crisis. More 
than 100 million doses of COVID–19 vac-
cines have been administered across 
the country. And we are starting to see 
job growth as more companies start 
hiring again. 
However, with hundreds of millions 
of Americans still needing to be vac-
cinated and the threat of COVID–19 
variants still looming, we need to con-
tinue 
to 
support 
our 
frontline 
healthcare providers and help keep 
them financially strong for the months 
ahead. 
That is why Senator COLLINS and I 
came together to introduce the Medi-
care Sequester Relief Act, a bill that 
would suspend the 2 percent Medicare 
payment cuts that are scheduled to hit 
healthcare providers starting on April 
1. 
As a result of the CARES Act and 
through subsequent relief measures, 
these payment cuts have been sus-
pended through March 31, and they 
need to be suspended again. 
With American hospitals and nursing 
homes projecting tens of billions of 
dollars in additional financial losses 
this year due to the COVID–19 crisis, 
we need to continue to avert these 
Medicare payment cuts until we are 
further past the worst of the pandemic. 
The substitute amendment that Sen-
ator COLLINS and I are offering today is 
a reasonable compromise. It delays the 
Medicare payment cuts through De-
cember 31. And it ensures that the cost 
of this delay is paid for, so that we do 
not increase the Federal budget deficit. 
This week, I heard from Wentworth- 
Douglass Hospital in Dover, NH. 
They highlighted that this legisla-
tion would result in $2.1 million in des-
perately needed additional revenue for 
the hospital. 
The hospital’s chief financial officer, 
Peter Walcek told me: ‘‘These are real 
dollars supporting our organization’s 
recovery from tens of millions in lost 
revenue and added costs during the 
pandemic. . . . By passing a continued 
moratorium through 2021, Wentworth- 
Douglass will be in a better place to 
care for those in need and respond to 
any future crisis affecting the health of 
our community.’’ 
I also heard about the importance of 
Medicare 
sequester 
relief 
for 
New 
Hampshire nursing homes. Patricia 
Ramsey, from the Edgewood Centre 
nursing facility in Portsmouth, NH, 
said ‘‘the Medicare sequestration sus-
pension, although not a cure, will help 
us mitigate the added operating ex-
penses and losses we continue to expe-
rience, especially with the exacerbated 
workforce shortage.’’ 
I have heard stories like these from 
so many healthcare providers across 
New Hampshire, and I believe there are 
healthcare providers in each of our 
communities that would share similar 
stories. 
We need to provide them with more 
financial support so that they can be 
there to care for patients, as we con-
tinue to make progress in combating 
this pandemic. 
We cannot allow our hospitals and 
healthcare providers to go under as we 
fight through the worst public health 
crisis of our lifetimes. 
I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether again, like we did in the CARES 
Act, and support this legislation when 
it comes up for a vote today. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 30 sec-
onds’ worth. 
First of all, we are protecting the 
lifeline for senior citizens by delaying 
the sequester cut to Medicare. We 
would have extraordinary problems if 
this cut were to be allowed to take ef-
fect. 
Second, we have defeated the Scott 
amendment which, if adopted, would 
have set a horrible precedent by refus-
ing to fix Congress’s mistake and forc-
ing hospitals in one Senator’s State to 
take on draconian Medicaid cuts. 
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
VOTE ON H.R. 1868 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass, as 
amended? 
Mr. MANCHIN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
EQUAL PAY DAY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our Na-
tion is built on some fundamental 
ideas. One of those ideas is fairness. 
But there are millions of women 
across this country today who are 
doing the same job as their male col-
leagues and are being paid less. 
That is why on this National Equal 
Pay Day, I stand with my fellow Sen-
ators to close the pay equity gap and 
ensure equal pay for equal work. 
Fifty-eight years after the passage of 
the Equal Pay Act, women still only 
earn, on average, 82 cents for every dol-
lar paid to men. 
This wage gap is even worse for 
women of color. 
African-American women who work 
full time make only 63 cents for every 
dollar paid to White males. 
Hispanic women make only 55 cents 
on the dollar. 
In nearly every industry in our coun-
try, women’s median earnings remain 
less than their male counterparts. 
There has been one profound change 
since the passage of the Equal Pay Act 
58 years ago. Forty-one percent of 
women are now the primary-or only- 
breadwinners for their families. 
In my own State of Illinois, women 
earn, on average, just 81 cents for every 
dollar earned by men. 
African-American women in Illinois 
make just 63 cents for every dollar paid 
to White males. Hispanic women are 
paid even less-just 49 cents on the dol-
lar. 
This pay discrimination hurts work-
ing families. More than one-third of 
households led by women in Illinois 
live in poverty. 
Over their lifetimes, this persistent 
pay equity gap will cost the average 
woman in my State nearly $500,000 in 
lost wages. 
This is not right, and it is not fair. 
And it means women have to work that 
much harder to support their families 
and retire in dignity, and too many 
can’t achieve those goals no matter 
how long or hard they work. 
The coronavirus pandemic has under-
scored just how deep and damaging pay 
inequality is in the United States. 
Nearly 2 in 3 frontline workers are 
women. Yet they-nearly universally- 
are paid less than men in the same 
roles. 
For example, 88 percent of registered 
nurses are women. Yet they make 93 
cents for every dollar a male nurse 
makes. 
Women who work as home health 
aides, personal care aides, or nursing 
assistants 
typically 
lose 
$250 
per 
month, or $3,000 per year, because of 
the gender wage gap. 
While our economy is slowing start-
ing to recover as people become vac-
cinated and the virus is brought under 
control, economists warn that it may 
take years for women to recover from 
the economic and career setbacks they 
have suffered during this pandemic. 
Four times as many women as men 
left the workforce in September of 2020 
alone. More than 860,000 women com-
pared to 216,000 men. 
From wage discrimination to the un-
availability of childcare, women are 
not getting a fair deal. That means 
working families are not getting a fair 
deal. That must change. 
This Senate should pass the Pay-
check Fairness Act reintroduced by 
Senator MURRAY. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would 
build on the successes of the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was the 
first bill signed into law by President 
Obama back in 2009. 
The Lily Ledbetter Act prohibits 
gender-based pay discrimination, but it 
is hard to enforce because many em-
ployers still maintain policies that 
punish 
employees 
who 
voluntarily 
share salary information with their co-
workers. 
Workers can’t demand equal pay if 
they don’t know that they are being 
underpaid. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would 
close loopholes that still permit retal-
iation against workers who disclose 
their wages. 
It would prohibit employers from 
asking prospective employees about 
their salary history. 
It would require that employers 
prove that pay disparities exist for le-
gitimate, job-related reasons, not sim-
ply because they think that ‘‘women’s 
work’’ is worth less. 
I am disappointed that Republican 
opposition has prevented the Senate 
from passing this bill, which is vital to 
the economic security of millions of 
American women and their families. 
But we are not giving up. 
Women have carried America’s fami-
lies and our economy through this pan-
demic. As the pandemic begins to end, 
so should the persistent pay discrimi-
nation against women. 
I urge my colleagues across the aisle 
to commit to passing the Paycheck 
Fairness Act and working with us to 
close this gender wage gap once and for 
all. 
f 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I’m re-
introducing a piece of legislation that I 
first introduced in 2017: the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act. 
Back then, we knew there was an ur-
gent need to address the crisis of hate 
and violent extremism in America. 
In the years since, that crisis has 
only gotten worse, and Congress has 
failed to take meaningful steps to ad-
dress it. 
We can change that, and we can 
change it now. 
Earlier this week, the Judiciary 
Committee held a hearing on gun vio-
lence in America. 
It happened just one day after a mass 
shooting in Boulder, CO claimed 10 
lives and just 1 week after a shooting 
spree at 3 Atlanta-area spas claimed 8 
lives. 
During the hearing, I mentioned how 
these tragedies—mass shootings, acts 
of terror, hate crimes—they occur with 
such frequency, that we can’t keep 
track. 
Each life lost is added to our national 
tally of failure. A failure to save Amer-
ican lives. 
And behind each number is a person. 
We lost eight of them last week in 
the Atlanta area in a hateful act of vio-
lence. 
Each of them had a name and a 
story. 
Xiaojie Tan was a hard-working 
mother, wife, and business-owner. 
Soon Chung Park was a mother and 
grandmother who loved to stay active. 
Her family was sure she was going to 
live to 100. 
Hyun Jung Kim was a former elemen-
tary school teacher who had immi-
grated to the United States from South

Sooncha Kim was a wife, mother, 
grandmother, and avid line dancer. She 
and her husband had been married for 
50 years. 
All of their lives were cut short by a 
lone gunman with hate in his heart. 
How many more lives must we lose 
before we act? 
How many more vigils, funerals must 
we hold? 
How many more families must be 
devastated forever? 
While the motives behind these hor-
rific attacks are still being inves-
tigated, it is impossible to ignore that 
six of the victims in the Atlanta attack 
were Asian-American women. 
It happened at a moment when vio-
lence against members of the Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity has been on the rise. 
Two of my colleagues in the Senate 
have shown tremendous courage in the 
wake of last week’s attack in Atlanta. 
I am proud to have Senator HIRONO 
as my colleague on the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, and I am proud to 
serve alongside Senator DUCKWORTH 
and represent our home State of Illi-
nois. 
The two of them have, rightfully, 
criticized the Federal Government for 
failing to protect members of the AAPI 
community from acts of hate and vio-
lent extremism. 
And they have every reason to be 
angry. 
A year ago, they warned us. 
They-along with Vice President Har-
ris, who was serving in the Senate at 
the time-introduced a resolution ex-
pressing alarm that people are, quote, 
‘‘living in fear and terror following the 
dramatic increase of threats and at-
tacks against those of Asian descent.’’ 
They called on us, the Members of 
this body, to have a ‘‘singular focus’’ 
on protecting the safety of AAPI peo-
ple, along with every American. 
We failed to do that. 
Since 
the 
pandemic 
began 
last 
March, nearly 3,800 hate incidents tar-
geting members of the AAPI commu-
nity have been reported. 
Now these Americans are afraid to 
walk the streets of their own neighbor-
hoods. 
It is one of many examples that high-
light the dire need to transform the 
way we deal with domestic terrorism in 
this country. 
Even before the pandemic began, a 
tide of hatred had begun sweeping over 
America. 
In 2019, the FBI reported that hate 
crimes had increased to the highest 
level in more than a decade. 
Another report, from the Center for 
the Study of Hate and Extremism, 
found that the number of hate-moti-
vated aggravated assaults in America 
had increased by nearly 50 percent be-
tween 2013 and 2019. 
Since hate crimes are historically 
underreported, we know that the in-
crease is probably much greater. 
Recently, the Department of Home-
land Security warned that violent, 
White supremacy is now ‘‘the most per-
sistent and lethal threat in the home-
land.’’ 
Violent extremism is a threat to all 
of us, whether it is a lone gunman in 
Atlanta or hordes of blood-thirsty ex-
tremists battering down the doors of 
this very chamber. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act will enhance the Federal Govern-
ment’s ability to prevent these acts of 
extremist violence. 
It will establish offices to combat do-
mestic terrorism at the Department of 
Justice, the FBI, and the Department 
of Homeland Security. 
Those offices would regularly assess 
the threat of violent extremism so law 
enforcement can focus their limited re-
sources on the most significant ones. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act would also provide training and re-
sources to assist State, local, and trib-
al law enforcement in addressing those 
threats. 
I want to thank Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for working expeditiously to 
bring this bill to the floor. 
I want to thank Senators HIRONO and 
DUCKWORTH for their leadership and for 
joining me in cosponsoring a version of 
this legislation that combines the Do-
mestic Terrorism Prevention Act with 
their COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act. 
This combined bill, which we have 
named the ‘‘Domestic Terrorism and 
Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2021’’, 
would both combat the broader threat 
of domestic terrorism and ensure that 
the Department of Justice is promptly 
addressing the particular threats fac-
ing the AAPI community. 
Over the past week, in response to 
the attacks in Atlanta and Boulder, 
CO, I have heard Senators on both sides 
of the aisle make speeches about tak-
ing action to prevent acts of domestic 
terrorism. 
Well, I can think of no better first 
step than voting in support of this leg-
islation. To be clear, it is just one step. 
There is more we can and must do to 
combat domestic terrorism. 
But we have been waiting 4 years too 
long to sign this bill into law. 
Too many Americans have died. 
Let’s work to save ourselves from an-
other 4 years of unthinkable tragedies. 
I yield the floor.

The committee is also mandated by Senate 
Rule XXV.1(j)(2) to study and review, on a 
comprehensive basis, matters relating to the 
national security policy, foreign policy, and 
international economic policy as it relates 
to foreign policy of the United States, and 
matters relating to food, hunger, and nutri-
tion in foreign countries, and report thereon 
from time to time. 
(b) Oversight.—The committee also has a 
responsibility 
under 
Senate 
Rule 
XXVI.8(a)(2), which provides that ‘‘. . . . 
each standing committee . . . shall review 
and study, on a continuing basis, the appli-
cation, administration, and execution of 
those laws or parts of laws, the subject mat-
ter of which is within the jurisdiction of the 
committee.’’ 
(c) ‘‘Advice and Consent’’ Clauses.—The 
committee has a special responsibility to as-
sist the Senate in its constitutional function 
of providing ‘‘advice and consent’’ to all 
treaties entered into by the United States 
and all nominations to the principal execu-
tive branch positions in the field of foreign 
policy and diplomacy. 
RULE 2—SUBCOMMITTEES 
(a) Creation.—Unless otherwise authorized 
by law or Senate resolution, subcommittees 
shall be created by majority vote of the com-
mittee and shall deal with such legislation 
and oversight of programs and policies as the 
committee directs. Legislative measures or 
other matters may be referred to a sub-
committee for consideration in the discre-
tion of the chairman or by vote of a majority 
of the committee. If the principal subject 
matter of a measure or matter to be referred 
falls within the jurisdiction of more than one 
subcommittee, the chairman or the com-
mittee may refer the matter to two or more 
subcommittees for joint consideration. 
(b) Assignments.—Assignments of members 
to subcommittees shall be made in an equi-
table fashion. No member of the committee 
may receive assignment to a second sub-
committee until, in order of seniority, all 
members of the committee have chosen as-
signments to one subcommittee, and no 
member shall receive assignments to a third 
subcommittee until, in order of seniority, all 
members have chosen assignments to two 
subcommittees. 
No member of the committee may serve on 
more than four subcommittees at any one 
time. 
The chairman and ranking member of the 
committee shall be ex officio members, with-
out vote, of each subcommittee. 
(c) Hearings.—Except when funds have 
been specifically made available by the Sen-
ate for a subcommittee purpose, no sub-
committee of the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations shall hold hearings involving ex-
penses without prior approval of the chair-
man of the full committee or by decision of 
the full committee. Hearings of subcommit-
tees shall be scheduled after consultation 
with the chairman of the committee with a 
view toward avoiding conflicts with hearings 
of other subcommittees insofar as possible. 
Hearings of subcommittees shall not be 
scheduled to conflict with meetings or hear-
ings of the full committee. 
The proceedings of each subcommittee 
shall be governed by the rules of the full 
committee, subject to such authorizations or 
limitations as the committee may from time 
to time prescribe. 
RULE 3—MEETINGS AND HEARINGS 
(a) Regular Meeting Day.—The regular 
meeting day of the Committee on Foreign 
Relations for the transaction of committee 
business shall be on Wednesday of each week, 
unless otherwise directed by the chairman. 
(b) Additional Meetings and Hearings.—Ad-
ditional meetings and hearings of the com-
mittee may be called by the chairman as he 
may deem necessary. If at least three mem-
bers of the committee desire that a special 
meeting of the committee be called by the 
chairman, those members may file in the of-
fices of the committee their written request 
to the chairman for that special meeting. 
Immediately upon filing of the request, the 
chief clerk of the committee shall notify the 
chairman of the filing of the request. If, 
within three calendar days after the filing of 
the request, the chairman does not call the 
requested special meeting, to be held within 
seven calendar days after the filing of the re-
quest, a majority of the members of the com-
mittee may file in the offices of the com-
mittee their written notice that a special 
meeting of the committee will be held, speci-
fying the date and hour of that special meet-
ing. The committee shall meet on that date 
and hour. Immediately upon the filing of the 
notice, the clerk shall notify all members of 
the committee that such special meeting 
will be held and inform them of its date and 
hour. 
(c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.—To 
ensure that the issue which is the subject of 
the hearing is presented as fully and fairly as 
possible, whenever a hearing is conducted by 
the committee or a subcommittee upon any 
measure or matter, the ranking member of 
the committee or subcommittee may select 
and call an equal number of non-govern-
mental witnesses to testify at that hearing. 
(d) 
Public 
Announcement.—The 
com-
mittee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall 
make public announcement of the date, 
place, time, and subject matter of any meet-
ing or hearing to be conducted on any meas-
ure or matter at least seven calendar days in 
advance of such meetings or hearings, unless 
the chairman of the committee, or sub-
committee, in consultation with the ranking 
member, determines that there is good cause 
to begin such meeting or hearing at an ear-
lier date. 
(e) Procedure.—Insofar as possible, pro-
ceedings of the committee will be conducted 
without resort to the formalities of par-
liamentary procedure and with due regard 
for the views of all members. Issues of proce-
dure which may arise from time to time 
shall be resolved by decision of the chair-
man, in consultation with the ranking mem-
ber. The chairman, in consultation with the 
ranking member, may also propose special 
procedures to govern the consideration of 
particular matters by the committee. 
(f) Closed Sessions.—Each meeting and 
hearing of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, or any subcommittee thereof shall be 
open to the public, except that a meeting or 
hearing or series of meetings or hearings by 
the committee or a subcommittee on the 
same subject for a period of no more than 14 
calendar days may be closed to the public on 
a motion made and seconded to go into 
closed session to discuss only whether the 
matters 
enumerated 
in 
paragraphs 
(1) 
through (6) would require the meeting or 
hearing to be closed followed immediately by 
a record vote in open session by a majority 
of the members of the committee or sub-
committee when it is determined that the 
matters to be discussed or the testimony to 
be taken at such meeting or hearing or series 
of meetings or hearings— 
(1) will disclose matters necessary to be 
kept secret in the interests of national de-
fense or the confidential conduct of the for-
eign relations of the United States; 
(2) will relate solely to matters of com-
mittee staff personnel or internal staff man-
agement or procedure; 
(3) will tend to charge an individual with 
crime or misconduct; to disgrace or injure 
the professional standing of an individual, or 
otherwise to expose an individual to public 
contempt or obloquy, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy 
of an individual; 
(4) will disclose the identity of any in-
former or law enforcement agent or will dis-
close any information relating to the inves-
tigation or prosecution of a criminal offense 
that is required to be kept secret in the in-
terests of effective law enforcement; 
(5) will disclose information relating to the 
trade secrets or financial or commercial in-
formation pertaining specifically to a given 
person if— 
(A) an Act of Congress requires the infor-
mation to be kept confidential by govern-
ment officers and employees; or 
(B) the information has been obtained by 
the government on a confidential basis, 
other than through an application by such 
person for a specific government financial or 
other benefit, and is required to be kept se-
cret in order to prevent undue injury to the 
competitive position of such person, or 
(6) may divulge matters required to be 
kept confidential under other provisions of 
law or government regulations. 
A closed meeting or hearing may be opened 
by a majority vote of the committee. 
(g) Staff Attendance.—A member of the 
committee may have one member of his or 
her personal staff, for whom that member as-
sumes personal responsibility, accompany 
and be seated nearby at committee meetings 
and hearings. The chairman or ranking 
member may authorize the attendance and 
seating of such a staff member at committee 
meetings and hearings where the member of 
the committee is not present. 
Each member of the committee may des-
ignate members of his or her personal staff 
for whom that member assumes personal re-
sponsibility, who holds, at a minimum, a top 
secret security clearance, for the purpose of 
their eligibility to attend closed sessions of 
the committee, subject to the same condi-
tions set forth for committee staff under 
Rules 12, 13, and 14. 
In addition, the majority leader and the 
minority leader of the Senate, if they are not 
otherwise members of the committee, may 
designate one member of their staff for 
whom that leader assumes personal responsi-
bility and who holds, at a minimum, a top 
secret security clearance, to attend closed 
sessions of the committee, subject to the 
same conditions set forth for committee 
staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. 
Staff of other Senators who are not mem-
bers of the committee may not attend closed 
sessions of the committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1808 
March 25, 2021 
Attendance of committee staff at meetings 
and hearings shall be limited to those des-
ignated by the staff director or the minority 
staff director. 
The committee, by majority vote, or the 
chairman, with the concurrence of the rank-
ing member, may limit staff attendance at 
specified meetings or hearings. 
RULE 4—QUORUMS 
(a) Testimony.—For the purpose of taking 
sworn or unsworn testimony at any duly 
scheduled meeting a quorum of the com-
mittee and each subcommittee thereof shall 
consist of one member of such committee or 
subcommittee. 
(b) Business.—A quorum for the trans-
action of committee or subcommittee busi-
ness, other than for reporting a measure or 
recommendation to the Senate or the taking 
of testimony, shall consist of one-third of 
the members of the committee or sub-
committee, including at least one member 
from each party. 
(c) Reporting.—A majority of the member-
ship of the committee, including at least one 
member from each party, shall constitute a 
quorum for reporting any measure or rec-
ommendation to the Senate. No measure or 
recommendation shall be ordered reported 
from the committee unless a majority of the 
committee members is physically present, 
including at least one member from each 
party, and a majority of those present con-
curs. 
RULE 5—PROXIES 
Proxies must be in writing with the signa-
ture of the absent member. Subject to the re-
quirements of Rule 4 for the physical pres-
ence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy 
voting shall be allowed on all measures and 
matters before the committee. However, 
proxies shall not be voted on a measure or 
matter except when the absent member has 
been informed of the matter on which he is 
being recorded and has affirmatively re-
quested that he or she be so recorded. 
RULE 6—WITNESSES 
(a) General.—The Committee on Foreign 
Relations will consider requests to testify on 
any matter or measure pending before the 
committee. 
(b) Presentation.—If the chairman so de-
termines, the oral presentation of witnesses 
shall be limited to 10 minutes. However, 
written statements of reasonable length may 
be submitted by witnesses and other inter-
ested persons who are unable to testify in 
person. 
(c) Filing of Statements.—A witness ap-
pearing before the committee, or any sub-
committee thereof, shall submit an elec-
tronic copy of the written statement of his 
proposed testimony at least 24 hours prior to 
his appearance, unless this requirement is 
waived by the chairman and the ranking 
member following their determination that 
there is good cause for failure to file such a 
statement. 
(d) Expenses.—Only the chairman may au-
thorize expenditures of funds for the ex-
penses of witnesses appearing before the 
committee or its subcommittees. 
(e) Requests.—Any witness called for a 
hearing may submit a written request to the 
chairman no later than 24 hours in advance 
for his testimony to be in closed or open ses-
sion, or for any other unusual procedure. The 
chairman shall determine whether to grant 
any such request and shall notify the com-
mittee members of the request and of his de-
cision. 
RULE 7—SUBPOENAS 
(a) Authorization.—The chairman or any 
other member of the committee, when au-
thorized by a majority vote of the committee 
at a meeting or by proxies, shall have au-
thority to subpoena the attendance of wit-
nesses or the production of memoranda, doc-
uments, records, or any other materials. At 
the request of any member of the committee, 
the committee shall authorize the issuance 
of a subpoena only at a meeting of the com-
mittee. When the committee authorizes a 
subpoena, it may be issued upon the signa-
ture of the chairman or any other member 
designated by the committee. 
(b) Return.—A subpoena, or a request to an 
agency, for documents may be issued whose 
return shall occur at a time and place other 
than that of a scheduled committee meeting. 
A return on such a subpoena or request 
which is incomplete or accompanied by an 
objection constitutes good cause for a hear-
ing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, 
the chairman or any other member des-
ignated by him may convene a hearing by 
giving 4 hours notice by telephone or elec-
tronic mail to all other members. One mem-
ber shall constitute a quorum for such a 
hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing 
shall be to elucidate further information 
about the return and to rule on the objec-
tion. 
(c) Depositions.—At the direction of the 
committee, staff is authorized to take depo-
sitions from witnesses. 
RULE 8—REPORTS 
(a) Filing.—When the committee has or-
dered a measure or recommendation re-
ported, the report thereon shall be filed in 
the Senate at the earliest practicable time. 
(b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional 
Views.—A member of the committee who 
gives notice of his intentions to file supple-
mental, minority, or additional views at the 
time of final committee approval of a meas-
ure or matter, shall be entitled to not less 
than 3 calendar days in which to file such 
views, in writing (including by electronic 
mail), with the chief clerk of the committee, 
with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the 
same day that the committee has ordered a 
measure or matter reported. Such views 
shall then be included in the committee re-
port and printed in the same volume, as a 
part thereof, and their inclusion shall be 
noted on the cover of the report. In the ab-
sence of timely notice, the committee report 
may be filed and printed immediately with-
out such views. 
(c) Roll Call Votes.—The results of all roll 
call votes taken in any meeting of the com-
mittee on any measure, or amendment there-
to, shall be announced in the committee re-
port. The announcement shall include a tab-
ulation of the votes cast in favor and votes 
cast in opposition to each such measure and 
amendment by each member of the com-
mittee. 
RULE 9—TREATIES 
(a) General.—The committee is the only 
committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to 
review and report to the Senate on treaties 
submitted by the President for Senate advice 
and consent to ratification. Because the 
House of Representatives has no role in the 
approval of treaties, the committee is there-
fore the only congressional committee with 
responsibility for treaties. 
(b) Committee Proceedings.—Once sub-
mitted by the President for advice and con-
sent, each treaty is referred to the com-
mittee and remains on its calendar from 
Congress to Congress until the committee 
takes action to report it to the Senate or 
recommend its return to the President, or 
until the committee is discharged of the 
treaty by the Senate. 
(c) Floor Proceedings.—In accordance with 
Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which have been 
reported to the Senate but not acted on be-
fore the end of a Congress ‘‘shall be resumed 
at the commencement of the next Congress 
as if no proceedings had previously been had 
thereon.’’ 
(d) Hearings.—Insofar as possible, the com-
mittee should conduct a public hearing on 
each treaty as soon as possible after its sub-
mission by the President. Except in extraor-
dinary circumstances, treaties reported to 
the Senate shall be accompanied by a writ-
ten report. 
RULE 10—NOMINATIONS 
(a) Waiting Requirement.—Unless other-
wise directed by the chairman and the rank-
ing member, the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations shall not consider any nomination 
until 5 business days after it has been for-
mally submitted to the Senate. 
(b) Public Consideration.—Nominees for 
any post who are invited to appear before the 
committee shall be heard in public session, 
unless a majority of the committee decrees 
otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f). 
(c) Required Data.—No nomination shall be 
reported to the Senate unless (1) the nomi-
nee has been accorded a security clearance 
on the basis of a thorough investigation by 
executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee 
has filed a financial disclosure report and a 
related ethics undertaking with the com-
mittee; (3) the committee has been assured 
that the nominee does not have any interests 
which could conflict with the interests of the 
government in the exercise of the nominee’s 
proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons 
nominated to be chief of mission, ambas-
sador-at-large, or minister, the committee 
has received a complete list of any contribu-
tions made by the nominee or members of 
his immediate family to any Federal elec-
tion campaign during the year of his or her 
nomination and for the 4 preceding years; (5) 
for persons nominated to be chiefs of mis-
sion, the report required by Section 304(a)(4) 
of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the 
demonstrated competence of that nominee 
to perform the duties of the position to 
which he or she has been nominated; and (6) 
the nominee has provided the committee 
with a signed and notarized copy of the com-
mittee questionnaire for executive branch 
nominees. 
RULE 11—TRAVEL 
(a) Foreign Travel.—No member of the 
Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff 
shall travel abroad on committee business 
unless specifically authorized by the chair-
man, who is required by law to approve 
vouchers and report expenditures of foreign 
currencies, and the ranking member. Re-
quests for authorization of such travel shall 
state the purpose and, when completed, a full 
substantive and financial report shall be 
filed with the committee within 30 days. 
This report shall be furnished to all members 
of the committee and shall not be otherwise 
disseminated without authorization of the 
chairman and the ranking member. Except 
in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel 
shall not be approved unless the reporting 
requirements have been fulfilled for all prior 
trips. Except for travel that is strictly per-
sonal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government 
sources is subject to the same approval and 
substantive reporting requirements as U.S. 
Government-funded

addition, 
members and staff are reminded to consult 
the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as appro-
priate, the Senate Select Committee on Eth-

Any proposed travel by committee staff for 
a subcommittee purpose must be approved 
by the subcommittee chairman and ranking 
member prior to submission of the request to 
the chairman and ranking member of the full 
committee.

rule, no more than one member of the per-
sonal staff of a member of the committee

el, the personal staff member shall be consid-
ered to be an employee of the committee.

the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
RULE 12—TRANSCRIPTS AND MATERIALS 
PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE 
(a) General.—The Committee on Foreign 
Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of 
all committee and subcommittee meetings 
and hearings and such transcripts shall re-
main in the custody of the committee, unless 
a majority of the committee decides other-
wise. Transcripts of public hearings by the 
committee shall be published unless the 
chairman, with the concurrence of the rank-
ing member, determines otherwise. 
The committee, through the chief clerk, 
shall also maintain at least one copy of all 
materials provided to the committee by the 
Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in 
the custody of the committee and be subject 
to the committee’s rules and procedures, in-
cluding those rules and procedures applica-
ble to the handling of classified materials. 
Such transcripts and materials shall be 
made available to all members of the com-
mittee, committee staff, and designated per-
sonal representatives of members of the 
committee, except as otherwise provided in 
these rules. 
(b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or 
Materials.— 
(1) The chief clerk of the committee shall 
have responsibility for the maintenance and 
security of classified or restricted tran-
scripts or materials, and shall ensure that 
such transcripts or materials are handled in 
a manner consistent with the requirements 
of the United States Senate Security Man-
ual. 
(2) A record shall be maintained of each 
use of classified or restricted transcripts or 
materials as required by the Senate Security 
Manual. 
(3) Classified transcripts or materials may 
not leave the committee offices, or SVC–217 
of the Capitol Visitors Center, except for the 
purpose of declassification or archiving, con-
sistent with these rules. 
(4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid 
taking notes or quotes from classified tran-
scripts or materials. Their contents may not 
be divulged to any unauthorized person. 
(5) Subject to any additional restrictions 
imposed by the chairman with the concur-
rence of the ranking member, only the fol-
lowing persons are authorized to have access 
to classified or restricted transcripts or ma-
terials: 
(A) Members and staff of the committee in 
the committee offices or in SVC–217 of the 
Capitol Visitors Center; 
(B) Designated personal representatives of 
members of the committee, and of the ma-
jority and minority leaders, with appropriate 
security clearances, in the committee offices 
or in SVC–217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; 
(C) Senators not members of the com-
mittee, by permission of the chairman, in 
the committee offices or in SVC–217 of the 
Capitol Visitors Center; and 
(D) Officials of the executive departments 
involved in the meeting, hearing, or matter, 
with authorization of the chairman, in the 
committee offices or SVC–217 of the Capitol 
Visitors Center. 
(6) Any restrictions imposed by the com-
mittee upon access to a meeting or hearing 
of the committee shall also apply to the 
transcript of such meeting, except by special 
permission of the chairman and ranking 
member. 
(7) In addition to restrictions resulting 
from the inclusion of any classified informa-
tion in the transcript of a committee meet-
ing or hearing, members and staff shall not 
discuss with anyone the proceedings of the 
committee in closed session or reveal infor-
mation conveyed or discussed in such a ses-
sion unless that person would have been per-
mitted to attend the session itself or is a 
member or staff of a relevant committee or 
executive branch agency and possess an ap-
propriate security clearance, or unless such 
communication is specifically authorized by 
the chairman, the ranking member, or in the 
case of staff, by the staff director or minor-
ity staff director. A record shall be kept of 
all such authorizations. 
(c) Declassification.— 
(1) All noncurrent records of the com-
mittee are governed by Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. 474 
(96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or 
materials transferred to the National Ar-
chives and Records Administration under 
Rule XI may not be made available for pub-
lic use unless they have been subject to de-
classification review in accordance with ap-
plicable laws or Executive orders. 
(2) Any transcript or classified committee 
report, or any portion thereof, may be de-
classified, in accordance with applicable laws 
or Executive orders, sooner than the time pe-
riod provided for under S. Res. 474 if: 
(A) the chairman originates such action, 
with the concurrence of the ranking mem-
ber; 
(B) the other current members of the com-
mittee who participated in such meeting or 
report have been notified of the proposed de-
classification, and have not objected thereto, 
except that the committee by majority vote 
may overrule any objections thereby raised 
to early declassification; and 
(C) the executive departments that partici-
pated in the meeting or originated the classi-
fied information have been consulted regard-
ing the declassification. 
RULE 13—CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 
(a) General.—The handling of classified in-
formation in the Senate is governed by S. 
Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established 
the Office of Senate Security. All handling of 
classified information by the committee 
shall be consistent with the procedures set 
forth in the United States Senate Security 
Manual issued by the Office of Senate Secu-
rity. 
(b) Security Manager.—The chief clerk is 
the security manager for the committee. The 
chief clerk shall be responsible for imple-
menting the provisions of the Senate Secu-
rity Manual and for serving as the com-
mittee liaison to the Office of Senate Secu-
rity. The staff director, in consultation with 
the minority staff director, may appoint an 
alternate security manager as circumstances 
warrant. 
(c) Transportation of Classified Material.— 
Classified material may only be transported 
between Senate offices by appropriately 
cleared staff members who have been specifi-
cally authorized to do so by the security 
manager. 
(d) Access to Classified Material.—In gen-
eral, Senators and staff undertake to confine 
their access to classified information on the 
basis of a ‘‘need to know’’ such information 
related to their committee responsibilities. 
(e) Staff Clearances.—The chairman, or, in 
the case of minority staff, the ranking mem-
ber, shall designate the members of the com-
mittee staff whose assignments require ac-
cess to classified and compartmented infor-
mation and shall seek to obtain the requisite 
security clearances pursuant to Office of 
Senate Security procedures. 
(f) PRM Clearances.—For the purposes of 
this rule regarding security clearances and 
access to compartmented information, the 
officially-designated personal representative 
of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), 
shall be deemed to have the same rights, du-
ties, and responsibilities as members of the 
staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
(g) Regulations.—The staff director is au-
thorized to make such administrative regu-
lations as may be necessary to carry out the 
provisions of this rule. 
RULE 14—STAFF 
(a) Responsibilities.— 
(1) The staff works for the committee as a 
whole, under the general supervision of the 
chairman of the committee, and the imme-
diate direction of the staff director, except 
that such part of the staff as is designated 
minority staff shall be under the general su-
pervision of the ranking member and under 
the immediate direction of the minority 
staff director. 
(2) Any member of the committee should 
feel free to call upon the staff at any time 
for assistance in connection with committee 
business. Members of the Senate not mem-
bers of the committee who call upon the 
staff for assistance from time to time should 
be given assistance subject to the overriding 
responsibility of the staff to the committee. 
(3) The staff’s primary responsibility is 
with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, 
and nominations and other matters within 
the jurisdiction of the committee. In addi-
tion to carrying out assignments from the 
committee and its individual members, the 
staff has a responsibility to originate sugges-
tions for committee or subcommittee consid-
eration. The staff also has a responsibility to 
make suggestions to individual members re-
garding matters of special interest to such 
members. 
(4) It is part of the staff’s duty to keep 
itself as well informed as possible in regard 
to developments affecting foreign relations 
and national security and in regard to the 
administration of foreign programs of the 
United States. Significant trends or develop-
ments which might otherwise escape notice 
should be called to the attention of the com-
mittee, or of individual Senators with par-
ticular interests. 
(5) The staff shall pay due regard to the 
constitutional separation of powers between 
the Senate and the executive branch. It 
therefore has a responsibility to help the 
committee bring to bear an independent, ob-
jective judgment of proposals by the execu-
tive branch and when appropriate to origi-
nate sound proposals of its own. At the same 
time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon 
the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. 
(6) In those instances when committee ac-
tion requires the expression of minority 
views, the staff shall assist the minority as 
fully as the majority to the end that all 
points of view may be fully considered by 
members of the committee and of the Sen-
ate. The staff shall bear in mind that under 
our constitutional system it is the responsi-
bility of the elected members of the Senate 
to determine legislative issues in the light of 
as full and fair a presentation of the facts as 
the staff may be able to obtain. 
(b) Personal Representatives of the Mem-
ber (PRM).—Each Senator on the committee 
shall be authorized to designate one personal 
staff member as the member’s personal rep-
resentative of the member and designee to

the committee (PRM) that shall be deemed 
to have the same rights, duties, and respon-
sibilities as members of the staff of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations where specifi-
cally provided for in these rules. 
(c) Restrictions.— 
(1) The staff shall regard its relationship to 
the committee as a privileged one, in the na-
ture of the relationship of a lawyer to a cli-
ent. In order to protect this relationship and 
the mutual confidence which must prevail if 
the committee-staff relationship is to be a 
satisfactory and fruitful one, the following 
criteria shall apply, unless staff has con-
sulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the 
approval of the Senate Ethics Committee 
and advance permission from the staff direc-
tor (or the minority staff director in the case 
of minority staff): 
(A) members of the staff shall not be iden-
tified with any special interest group in the 
field of foreign relations or allow their 
names to be used by any such group; and 
(B) members of the staff shall not accept 
public speaking engagements or write for 
publication in the field of foreign relations. 
(2) The staff shall not discuss their private 
conversations with members of the com-
mittee without specific advance permission 
from the Senator or Senators concerned. 
(3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone 
the proceedings of the committee in closed 
session or reveal information conveyed or 
discussed in such a session unless that per-
son would have been permitted to attend the 
session itself or is a member or staff of a rel-
evant committee or executive branch agency 
and possesses an appropriate security clear-
ance, or unless such communication is spe-
cifically authorized by the staff director or 
minority staff director. Unauthorized disclo-
sure of information from a closed session or 
of classified information shall be cause for 
immediate dismissal and may, in certain 
cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution. 
RULE 15—STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES 
(a) Status.—In addition to the foregoing, 
the Committee on Foreign Relations is gov-
erned by the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
which shall take precedence in the event of 
a clear inconsistency. In addition, the juris-
diction and responsibilities of the committee 
with respect to certain matters, as well as 
the timing and procedure for their consider-
ation in committee, may be governed by 
statute. 
(b) 
Amendment.—These 
rules 
may 
be 
modified, amended, or repealed by a major-
ity of the committee, provided that a notice 
in writing (including by electronic mail) of 
the proposed change has been given to each 
member at least 72 hours prior to the meet-
ing at which action thereon is to be taken. 
However, rules of the committee which are 
based upon Senate rules may not be super-
seded by committee vote alone.

TRIBUTE TO JOE HACK 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, every 
Senator depends on their staff to pro-
vide them with information and advice 
on the issues. Every Senator knows the 
importance of having good staff who 
can respond to the questions and con-
cerns their constituents may have in 
dealing with the Federal bureaucracy. 
And every Senator believes that their 
staff members are the most prepared, 
the most conscientious, and the most 
caring people in the U.S. Senate. 
I know that my staff is. I have been 
fortunate with the people who have 
joined my team to work for the great 
State of Nebraska. I have been ex-
tremely fortunate that Joe Hack has 
been a member of Team Fischer since 
my very first day as a U.S. Senator. 
Joe officially joined my team as my 
communications director on that first 
day. He was not new to the Senate; he 
had first arrived here as an 18-year-old 
intern. On our first day in 2013, he im-
mediately got to work with his new 
boss in getting out press releases, 
reaching out to State and national 
media, and helping me continue my 
practice of writing a weekly column 
for media back home. 
Joe never missed a beat. He helped 
guide me through the traditions and 
inner workings of the Senate and 
through the tunnels of the Russell 
Building. 
After 2 years, Joe Hack became my 
chief of staff, the youngest chief in the 
Senate at that time. Joe set the tone I 
wanted for my office: Be professional, 
take your job seriously, be honest, get 
along with your colleagues, always re-
spond to constituents, gather all the 
information we need on an issue and 
then get more, and work hard. Joe’s 
closing to every email and every staff 
meeting was always, ‘‘Work harder.’’ 
And he set the example for all of these. 
Joe was involved in every major 
piece of legislation we have accom-
plished, from passing the first-ever 
paid family leave law to the FAST Act, 
our 
Internet 
of 
Things 
work, 
broadband, infrastructure, and agri-
culture issues. He guided the Omaha 
VA clinic from inception to comple-
tion, and he will see the Lincoln VA 
clinic open and the Offutt Air Force 
Base runway completely rebuilt. He 
knew the importance of securing fund-
ing for Nebraska highway and water 
projects and for the continued growth 
of our university system. He was part 
of every success. 
Joe knows Nebraska, and Nebraskans 
know Joe. He knew instinctively that 
the people of our State are why we do 
this work. We represent them. Joe has 
attended statehood dinners in our Cap-
itol Rotunda, driven a combine in 
Grand Island, had meals at Ole’s Big 
Game Bar, and gone to Husker tail-
gates and games. He loves browsing at 
Cabela’s and a good meal at Rosita’s. 
He knows which Nebraska hotels have 
the best gym, where every Runza drive- 
thru is located in the State, and where 
to find the best steaks. He has shared 
BBQ at our ranch with family, neigh-
bors and the U.S. Secretary of Ag. He 
is also addicted to Colby Ridge popcorn 
balls. He buys them in bulk, and he 
doesn’t share. 
He has attended countless Nebraska 
breakfasts and constituent meetings in 
Washington. He has worked hard for 
the people of Nebraska. 
Joe has traveled the vastness of our 
State, understanding its diversity and 
standing in awe while viewing our 
skies, sunrises and sunsets, our clouds, 
and the majesty of our night stars. He 
fell in love with ‘‘The Good Life’’. A 
New Jersey guy became a Nebraskan. 
Joe has been by my side since my 
very first day in the Senate, and now, 
he is moving on to new opportunities. 
He has been a mentor to many, my 
trusted policy and political adviser, 
and a leader whose admonition to 
‘‘work 
harder’’ 
became 
our 
office 
mantra. Joe has smoothed the waters 
and ruffled feathers. 
Joe Hack is a friend. He is family. I 
wish him only the best as he meets new 
challenges and faces new adventures in 
his life. 
Thank you, Joe.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CELEA POITRA AND 
GAHGE WHITEMANRUNSHIM 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week, I have the honor of recognizing 
Celea 
Poitra 
and 
Gahge 
Whitemanrunshim of Big Horn County 
for courageously stepping up to help 
others in the face of danger. They ex-
hibit strong Montana values, and their 
dedication to helping others is admi-
rable. 
Celea and Gahge were in their grand-
mother’s pickup truck heading to a 
dental appointment on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 27, 2021, when they witnessed 
devastating 30–vehicle pileup on the 
Yellowstone River Bridge outside Bil-
lings, MT. Dozens of vehicles crashed 
into each other on the icy interstate 
highway bridge. After their truck came 
to a stop, Celea and Gahge saw a vehi-
cle with a mother and two kids hang-
ing partially off the guardrail of the 
bridge. Celea and Gahge did not hesi-
tate to step in and help. However, the 
impact from other vehicles hitting the 
pile-up knocked both of them off of the 
bridge, and they fell to the ground 
about 60 feet below. 
They sustained serious injuries when 
they fell and are recovering in Billings’ 
hospital. Celea was treated for a bro-
ken back, lacerated kidney, and other 
injuries. She was in an intensive care 
unit and is expected to need multiple 
surgeries. Gahge suffered a fractured 
neck, punctured lung, and other inju-
ries. Their grandmother and guardian, 
Joan, stated that it is very much in her 
children’s nature to go out of their way 
to help someone. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Celea and Gahge for demonstrating 
such bravery to help others in need and 
I pray for their swift recovery. Their 
selflessness serves as an inspiration to 
all Montanans. ∑

REMEMBERING MARLENE BANE 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, today I 
rise to recognize the life of Ms. Mar-

Marlene answered the highest calling 
of dedication to her country, her State, 
and her local community. Along with 
her husband, Assemblyman Tom Bane,

government through a blend of intel-
ligence, soft-spoken charm, organiza-
tion, and, most of all, dear friends and

relatives. She spent a lifetime engaged 
in political consulting and nonprofit 
projects such as lupus research and the 
Jewish Home for the Aging. 
Marlene worked tirelessly to improve 
California and serve those most in 
need. She was also well known and 
loved throughout L.A.’s Jewish com-
munity for her civic activism and sup-
port for Israel. 
Marlene was renowned for mentoring 
an amazing number of our political 
leaders on how to serve constituents 
with honor and commitment. Up to the 
last week of her life, she threw herself 
into the cause of supporting can-
didates. She believed in the command-
ment of Tikkun Olam, that she must 
leave the world better than she found 
it. It is undeniable that she left those 
who knew her better off for having 
known her.∑

REMEMBERING ANTONIO 
GONZALEZ 
∑ Mr. 
PADILLA. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
would like to include in the RECORD 
the following obituary for Mr. Antonio 
Gonzalez, written by his children. 
The material follows: 
Beloved Antonio Gonzalez made his transi-
tion the night of December 30, 2020. Born in 
Calera in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico on 
March 30, 1964, he was the eldest of four chil-
dren born to Antonio Gonzalez and Antonia 
Del Villar. The Gonzalez family spent their 
early years living with Antonio’s maternal 
grandparents in a small town in Calera. An-
tonio shared fond memories of times spent 
on his grandparent’s abundant ranch. He de-
scribed what seemed to him an endless land-
scape of rolling hills, trees, livestock and 
horses (his favorite). 
Hard times fell on the young family around 
the time Antonio turned eight. A sudden re-
gime change resulted in his dad losing his 
job, forcing them to set their sights ‘‘north’’ 
in search for work and a better life. Their 
trek north ended in what was (at the time) a 
small dusty town just south of the California 
border. It was there, in Tecate, BC where he 
and his three siblings, Antonio (Tony Chico), 
Margarita and Maria de la Luz were raised 
and attended school. But, with a lack of good 
paying jobs, times remained tough in Tecate. 
Antonio 
recalled 
working 
odd-end 
jobs 
throughout his childhood and adolescence; a 
shoe shiner, sweeper—anything to help en-
sure that there was food on the table. 
As a young adult, Antonio set his sights on 
completing the journey north—to the U.S. In 
1971, 
shortly 
after 
marrying 
Florentina 
‘‘Nina’’ Herrera, he made his way to Los An-
geles. They settled in the San Fernando Val-
ley—a sleepy suburb of LA at the height of 
rock and roll, disco, and bell bottoms. 
Antonio 
worked 
just 
about 
anywhere 
where hard work was needed—maintenance 
work at a convalescent hospital, land-
scaping, you name it. But his fate would 
change when he landed a job at a large con-
struction company. I’m not sure what it was 
about ‘‘construction’’ that he loved. Perhaps 
it was the job stability or the early start to 
the day where he could greet the sunrise on 
his drive into downtown. Or maybe it was 
the art of building—the satisfaction of erect-
ing a structure where only a plot of land ex-
isted—a tangible outcome only accomplished 
by hard work and sweat. Over the years, he 
had become somewhat of an infrastructure 
historian, recalling with such clarity the 
buildings he helped build and rehabilitate in 
the San Fernando Valley, Downtown LA, 
Santa Monica, and Malibu. 
He dedicated most of his life to erecting 
buildings and homes, whether for work or 
building homes for his family both in the 
San Fernando Valley and in Tecate, BC. An-
tonio built his family home, simple and un-
pretentious yet on a solid foundation with 
strong bones. In fact, as time would prove, 
there’s nowhere else his family would prefer 
to be in an earthquake but under the protec-
tion of those strong beams hammered to-
gether with pride and affection. Even in his 
retirement years, Antonio never stopped 
building. 
Antonio was a great provider for his fam-
ily. Through his hard work and dedication, 
he showed his children that the true Amer-
ican dream could be achieved—of buying a 
home, raising a family and ensuring a better 
future for the next generation. 
He is survived by his wife, ‘‘Nina’’, son 
David, daughter Maria Ines and son-in-law 
Jose, daughter Sandra and son-in law James, 
son Cristian and grandchildren Javier, Si-
enna and Julian. Siblings Antonio, Mar-
garita and Maria de la Luz and many loving 
cousins, nieces and nephews. He was pre-
ceded in death by his father Antonio Gon-
zalez and mother, Antonia Gonzalez Del 
Villar.∑

REMEMBERING JOE ‘‘PINOY’’ 
LOZANO 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize the life of Mr. Joe Lozano. 
Joe ‘‘Pinoy’’ Lozano was born on De-
cember 26, 1934, in Pacoima, CA, as one 
of 10 children. Joe had every job you 
can imagine. He shined shoes and 
worked in the fields as a young boy. He 
joined the U.S. Marine Corp in 1954 and 
served during the Korean war as an in-
fantryman. 
After the service, he married the love 
of his life, Virginia. They were married 
for 60 years and had 6 children, 21 
grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren, 
and 1 great-great-grandchild. 
Joe was a community-oriented per-
son. After his family, his community 
came first. He painted over graffiti, he 
helped beautify the streets, and he 
even mowed the grass on the center di-
vider of his street when the city was 
too busy to do it. 
Joe worked as a prop maker for the 
studios for many years. He had tons of 
stories, and he loved his job. He re-
tired, went back to work, and only 
stopped again to care for his wife when 
she became ill. 
Since 2004, Joe worked with the an-
nual San Fernando Valley Veterans 
Day Parade organizing committee so 
that Veterans could be honored on Vet-
erans Day. 
He will be missed by many.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING VERMONT MEALS 
ON WHEELS 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I 
would like to take a moment to recog-
nize 
the 
extraordinary 
work 
of 
Vermont’s Meals on Wheels Programs. 
Each March, we celebrate March for 
Meals to draw attention to the incred-
ible work of Meals on Wheel through-
out the country, including in my home 
State of Vermont. All across our State, 
hundreds of volunteers regularly de-
liver freshly cooked, nutritious meals 
to thousands of older people in their 
homes, many of whom otherwise might 
not have enough to eat. These volun-
teers play a critically important role 
in 
helping 
ensure 
that 
older 
Vermonters have access to adequate 
nutrition. In and of itself, that is no 
small matter. 
In a typical year, Meals on Wheels 
volunteers do so much more than deliv-
ering meals. These volunteers provide 
critical social interaction for the peo-
ple they visit, which goes a long way to 
combat the effects of isolation that 
many Vermonters face, especially in 
rural areas. Without this social inter-
action, seniors are more likely to have 
feelings of loneliness and depression, 
which puts them at higher risk for de-
mentia, chronic disease, falls, and hos-
pitalization. Their regular visits serve 
another purpose as well. The volun-
teers know each person they visit and 
recognize immediately if something 
does not seem right. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that volunteers have lit-
erally saved Vermonters’ lives by fol-
lowing up when no one answers the 
door, taking the time to discover that 
someone had fallen and been injured. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, vol-
unteers—both 
new 
and 
existing— 
stepped up to deliver over 1 million 
meals to over 7,500 Vermonters. This 
represents a 30-percent increase in the 
number of meals and almost a 20-per-
cent increase in the number of people 
receiving meals through this vital Fed-
eral program. At a time when so many 
Vermonters struggled with the dual 
hardship of loneliness and hunger cause 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, Meals on 
Wheels served as a critical lifeline. 
In addition to the many Meals on 
Wheels 
volunteers 
throughout 
Vermont, I also want to recognize and 
thank the caring and dedicated profes-
sionals who run Vermont’s Meals on 
Wheel Programs. From the chefs who 
prepare the nutritious meals with skill 
and care, to the program staff who en-
sure that everything runs smoothly, 
these Vermonters are the backbone of 
what makes Meals on Wheels the suc-
cess that it is. In March, when so much 
of our State shut down due to the pan-
demic, these dedicated people imme-
diately pivoted to expand Meals on 
Wheels and ensure that any older 
Vermonter who wanted a meal could 
get one. This was particularly impor-
tant for all those who had previously 
relied on congregate meal programs, 
which were unsafe during the pan-
demic. 
Together, every single Meals on 
Wheels volunteer and staff person 
forms an indispensable link in our so-
cial safety net and has my sincere ap-
preciation for their remarkable work. 
As more and more Vermonters are now 
vaccinated and the State begins a care-
ful reopening, following the science 
and ensuring the safety of all our peo-
ple, I look forward to a day when I and

controversial. 
Some may view these lands as reposi-
tories for timber, energy, or minerals. 
Others may enjoy using recreational 
trails through them. Others may be-
lieve that they should be left to nature 
and not disturbed. The truth, of course, 
is that all of these uses are important; 
the conflict lies in agreeing on which 
lands are best suited to which pur-
poses. 
In the lead-up to the latest multiyear 
GW Forest Management Plan, various 
forest users came together to see if 
they 
could 
find 
reasonable 
com-
promises that would avoid years of un-
productive disagreement and litiga-
tion. This group, known as the George 
Washington National Forest Stake-
holder 
Collaborative, 
succeeded. 
Through hard work and consensus, the 
collaborative made joint recommenda-
tions to the U.S. Forest Service for for-
est management and protection. Pres-
ervation advocates consented to timber 
harvest and other active forest restora-
tion and management in certain areas, 
while forest products interests con-
sented to wilderness and light manage-
ment in other areas. Following this 
fruitful collaboration, the Forest Serv-
ice convened the Lower Cowpasture 
Restoration and Management Project, 
bringing together the collaborative and 
other stakeholders to help develop 
management activities on this par-
ticular part of the forest in Bath Coun-
ty. Again, this collaborative succeeded, 
with everyone getting some of what 
they want and giving some ground. 
The collaborative has now come to-
gether to support the wilderness addi-
tions in this bill, which designates 4,500 
acres to be added to the Rich Hole Wil-
derness Area and 1,000 acres to be 
added to the Rough Mountain Wilder-
ness Area. I am proud to partner on 
this with my colleague Senator MARK 
WARNER, and we are following in the 
path blazed by Senator John Warner 
and Representative Rick Boucher, who 
led the original Virginia Wilderness 
Act in 1984. I am further proud that 
this bill passed unanimously in the 
Senate last Congress and as part of a 
package passed the House this Con-
gress. I hope it will cross the finish line 
soon. 
Taking care of our Nation’s public 
lands is good for the economy and good 
for the environment. Land disputes 
may often be contentious, but this ex-
ample proves they don’t have to be. 
When everyone comes to the table and 
invests the necessary time, we can find 
common ground. I hope this will be a 
lesson for us in other tough policy 
challenges, and I encourage the Senate 
to support this bill.

A court that imposed a sentence for a cov-

tions 401 and 403 of the First Step Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5220) and the

ered offense was committed if, after consid-
ering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) 
of title 18, United States Code, the nature 
and seriousness of the danger to any person, 
the community, or any crime victims, and 
the post-sentencing conduct of the defend-
ant, the sentencing court finds a reduction is 
consistent with the amendments made by

made by that Act, including a review of any 
prior criminal conduct or any other relevant

subsection (f)(1) (relating to criminal his-
tory), the court may, upon prior notice to 
the Government, waive subsection (f)(1) if 
the court specifies in writing the specific 
reasons why reliable information indicates

the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal 
history or the likelihood that the defendant 
will commit other crimes. 
‘‘(2) PROHIBITION.—This subsection shall 
not apply to any defendant who has been 
convicted of a serious drug felony or a seri-
ous violent felony as defined in paragraphs

GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any

fendant convicted as an adult for an offense 
committed and completed before the defend-
ant attained 18 years of age if— 
‘‘(1) the defendant has served not less than 
20 years in custody for the offense; and 
‘‘(2) the court finds, after considering the 
factors set forth in subsection (c), that the 
defendant is not a danger to the safety of 
any person or the community and that the 
interests of justice warrant a sentence modi-
fication. 
‘‘(b) SUPERVISED RELEASE.—Any defendant 
whose sentence is reduced pursuant to sub-
section (a) shall be ordered to serve a period 
of supervised release of not less than 5 years 
following release from imprisonment. The 
conditions of supervised release and any 
modification or revocation of the term of su-
pervise release shall be in accordance with

prisonment pursuant to subsection (a), shall 
consider— 
‘‘(1) the factors described in section 3553(a), 
including the nature of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant;

onstrated maturity, rehabilitation, and a fit-
ness to reenter society sufficient to justify a 
sentence reduction; 
‘‘(6) any statement, which may be pre-
sented orally or otherwise, by any victim of 
an offense for which the defendant is impris-
oned or by a family member of the victim if 
the victim is deceased; 
‘‘(7) any report from a physical, mental, or 
psychiatric examination of the defendant 
conducted by a licensed health care profes-
sional;

termines relevant to the decision of the 
court.

tion.

MENT.—The table of sections for chapter 403

By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, 
Mr. 
INHOFE, 
Mr. 
BOOKER, and Mr. CARDIN): 
S. 1022. A bill to create jobs in the 
United States by increasing United 
States exports to Africa by at least 200 
percent in real dollar value within 10 
years, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1022 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Increasing 
American Jobs Through Greater Exports to 
Africa Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Export growth helps United States busi-
ness grow and create United States jobs. 
Ninety-eight percent of United States ex-
ports 
came 
from 
approximately 
300,000 
small- and medium-sized businesses sup-
porting 4,000,000 United States jobs. 
(2) In a February 5, 2021, message to an Af-
rican leaders meeting at the African Union 
Summit, President Joseph R. Biden re-
affirmed the United States relationship with 
African countries as partners in the con-
tinent-wide spirit of entrepreneurship and 
innovation. 
(3) Many countries have trade-distorting 
export promotion programs that aggres-
sively subsidize exports to Africa and other 
countries around the world. In 2019, there 
were 115 known official export credit pro-
viders around the world, including export 
credit agencies, up from 85 in 2015—a 35 per-
cent increase from 2015 to 2019. The increas-
ing investment by foreign governments into 
export credit can threaten competitiveness 
of United States businesses abroad. 
(4) Between 2008 and 2019, the People’s Re-
public of China alone provided more than 
$462,000,000,000 in loans to the developing 
world, and, in 2009, the People’s Republic of 
China surpassed the United States as the 
leading trade partner of African countries. 
The Export-Import Bank of the United 
States reports the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s export finance activity is larger than all 
the other export credit agencies in the Group 
of 7 countries combined, making the People’s 
Republic of China the world’s largest official 
creditor with a portfolio more than twice the 
size of the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund combined. 
(5) The Export-Import Bank of the United 
States supported $12,400,000,000 worth of 
transactions to sub-Saharan Africa from 2009 
to 2019, while in 2018, the People’s Republic 
of China made up 22 percent of public debt 
stock, and, in 2020, the People’s Republic of 
China made up 29 percent of debt service in 
low-income countries in Africa. The People’s 
Republic of China accounts for a quarter or 
more of all public and publicly guaranteed 
debt in Angola, Djibouti, Cameroon, the Re-
public of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and 
Zambia. 
(6) The practice of the People’s Republic of 
China of concessional financing runs con-
trary to the principles of the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development 
related to open market rates, undermines 
naturally competitive rates, and incentivizes 
governments in Africa to overlook the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China’s troubling record on 
labor practices, human rights, and environ-
mental impact. 
(7) Sixty percent of Africa’s approximately 
1,250,000,000 people are under the age of 25, 
and by the year 2050, one-third of global 
youth will be in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2030, 
Africa will have 17 cities with more than 
5,000,000 inhabitants, as well as 90 cities with 
populations of at least 1,000,000. Both are fac-
tors contributing to rising household con-
sumption predicted to reach approximately 
$2,500,000,000,000 by 2030. 
(8) When countries such as the People’s Re-
public of China assist with large-scale gov-
ernment projects, they often gain access to 
valuable commodities such as oil and copper, 
typically without regard to environmental, 
human rights, labor, or governance stand-
ards. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to 
create jobs in the United States by expand-
ing programs that will result in increasing 
United States exports to Africa by 200 per-
cent in real dollar value within 10 years. 
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) AFRICA.—The term ‘‘Africa’’ refers to 
the entire continent of Africa and its 54 
countries, including the Republic of South 
Sudan. 
(2) AFRICAN DIASPORA.—The term ‘‘African 
diaspora’’ means the people of African origin 
living in the United States, irrespective of 
their citizenship and nationality, who are 
willing to contribute to the development of 
Africa. 
(3) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Appropriations, the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, and the Committee on Finance of the 
Senate; and 
(B) the Committee on Appropriations, the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, the

‘‘SEC. 36C. CREDIT FOR COMPUTER COSTS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—In the case of an eligible 
individual, there shall be allowed as a credit

the aggregate amount of any advance pay-
ments of such credit under section 7527B for 
such taxable year. 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of advance payments under section 7527B for 
the taxable year exceeds the amount of the

taxable year (determined without regard to 
paragraph (1)), the tax imposed by this chap-
ter for such taxable year shall be increased

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 136—RECOG-
NIZING THE DUTY OF THE SEN-
ATE TO ABANDON MODERN MON-
ETARY 
THEORY 
AND 
RECOG-
NIZING THAT THE ACCEPTANCE 
OF MODERN MONETARY THEORY 
WOULD LEAD TO HIGHER DEFI-
CITS AND HIGHER INFLATION 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Ms. ERNST, 
and Mr. TILLIS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs: 
S. RES. 136 
Whereas noted economists from across the 
political spectrum have warned that the im-
plementation of Modern Monetary Theory 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘MMT’’) 
would pose a clear danger to the economy of 
the United States; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Zach Moller, deputy 
director of the economic program at Third 
Way, wrote in a memo the problems associ-
ated with MMT, including that— 
(1) ‘‘Under an MMT regime, policymakers 
would need to respond to inflation by doing 
two of the most unpopular things ever: rais-
ing taxes and cutting spending. . . . We can 
easily imagine divided government’s paral-
ysis to fight inflation: Republicans refusing 
to raise taxes and Democrats refusing to cut 
spending.’’; 
(2) MMT ‘‘ends our central non-political 
economic manager’’ and ‘‘markets trust the 
Federal Reserve and, as a result, businesses 
and individuals have well-anchored inflation 
expectations. . . . To solve the challenges 
higher interest rates create, including a pos-
sible interest financing spiral, MMT gen-
erally says that the Fed will be tasked with 
keeping interest rates low by making the 
Federal government, through the Fed, the 
consistent (if not the primary) purchaser of 
bonds. This is a different mission for the Fed 
than it has now. The Fed would no longer be 
tasked with intervening to keep prices stable 
because it would be too busy buying bonds. 
Bond purchases by the Fed generally in-
crease inflation. Thus, the Fed would no 
longer be an independent manager of the 
economy.’’; and 
(3) MMT ‘‘destroys foreign confidence in 
America’s finances. . . . Holders of U.S. debt 
(in the form of treasuries) expect stability in 
value, a return from their investments, and 
the ability to be paid back. MMT blows that 
up. Bondholders would no longer be assured 
a return on their investment, and it will no 
longer be as desirable for our creditors to 
hold U.S. debt.’’; 
Whereas, on May 17, 2019, Joel Griffith, a 
research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, 
wrote in an article entitled ‘‘The Absurdity 
of Modern Monetary Theory’’ the following: 
‘‘There is no free lunch. We will pay either 
through the visible burden of direct tax-
ation, the hidden tax of inflation, or higher 
borrowing costs (as the government com-
petes with businesses for available capital). 
Such realities might not make for a great 
stump speech, but facing them squarely now 
can save us a lot of headaches down the 
road.’’; 
Whereas, on March 25, 2019, Janet Yellen, 
former Chair of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, disagreed with 
those individuals promoting MMT who sug-
gest that ‘‘you don’t have to worry about in-
terest-rate payments because the central 
bank can buy the debt’’, stating: ‘‘That’s a 
very wrong-minded theory because that’s 
how you get hyper-inflation.’’; 
Whereas former Secretary of the Treasury 
and Director of the National Economic Coun-
cil Lawrence H. Summers— 
(1) on March 5, 2019, wrote in an opinion 
piece in the Washington Post entitled ‘‘The 
left’s embrace of modern monetary theory is 
a recipe for disaster’’ that, ‘‘contrary to the 
claims of modern monetary theorists, it is 
not true that governments can simply create 
new money to pay all liabilities coming due 
and avoid default. As the experience of any 
number of emerging markets demonstrates, 
past a certain point, this approach leads to 
hyperinflation.’’; and 
(2) on March 4, 2019, said that— 
(A) MMT is fallacious at multiple levels; 
(B) past a certain point, MMT leads to 
hyperinflation; and 
(C) a policy of relying on a central bank 
to finance government deficits, as advo-
cated by MMT theorists, would likely re-
sult in a collapsing exchange rate; 
Whereas, on February 26, 2019, Jerome 
Powell, Chair of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, stated: ‘‘The 
idea that deficits don’t matter for countries 
that can borrow in their own currency I 
think is just wrong.’’; 
Whereas, 
on 
February 
24, 
2019, 
Matt 
Bruenig, founder of the People’s Policy 
Project, wrote in an article entitled ‘‘What’s 
the Point of Modern Monetary Theory’’ that 
‘‘the real point of MMT seems to be to de-
ploy misleading rhetoric with the goal of de-
ceiving people about the necessity of taxes in 
a social democratic system. If successful, 
these word games might loosen up fiscal and 
monetary policy a bit in the short term. But 
insofar as getting government spending per-
manently up to 50 percent of GDP really will 
require substantially more taxes in the me-
dium and long term.’’; 
Whereas, 
on 
February 
21, 
2019, 
Doug 
Henwood, a journalist and economic analyst, 
wrote in an article in Jacobin entitled ‘‘Mod-
ern Monetary Theory Isn’t Helping’’ that 
‘‘MMT’s lack of interest in the relationship 
between money and the real economy causes 
adherents to overlook the connection be-
tween taxing, spending, and the allocation of 
resources’’; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2019, in a question 
and answer session with James Pethokoukis 
of AEIdeas, Stan Veuger, visiting lecturer of 
economics at Harvard University, stated 
that, ‘‘if you take MMTers at their word in 
the most aggressive sense, then what you 
would see is a massive debt finance expan-
sion of the welfare state with Medicare for 
All, with a jobs guarantee, and with concerns 
about inflation being deferred entirely to 
elected officials who would have to raise 
taxes to keep it under control. I think in a 
scenario like that, we do run a risk of going 
back to the 1970s pre-Volker style macro-
economics and I think that would be bad.’’; 
Whereas, on January 17, 2019, Michael 
Strain, Director of Economic Policy Studies 
at AEI, wrote in an opinion article in 
Bloomberg entitled ‘‘Modern Monetary The-
ory Is a Joke That’s Not Funny’’ that ‘‘if 
you thought from the start that the whole 
idea sounded like lunacy, you were right, 
even if it’s possible to admit some sliver of 
sympathy for it’’; 
Whereas Paul Krugman, winner of the 2008 
Nobel 
Memorial 
Prize 
in 
Economic 
Sciences— 
(1) on March 1, 2019, posted on Twitter a 
point-by-point rebuttal to an article entitled 
‘‘The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary The-
ory and the Birth of the People’s Economy’’ 
by Stephanie Kelton, which concluded with 
Krugman tweeting that— 
(A) ‘‘Sorry, but this is just a mess. 
Kelton’s response misrepresents standard 
macroeconomics, my own views, the ef-
fects of interest rates, and the process of 
money creation.’’; 
(B) ‘‘Otherwise I guess it’s all fine.’’; and 
(C) ‘‘See what I mean about Calvinball?’’; 
and 
(2) on February 12, 2019, wrote in an opin-
ion piece in the New York Times the fol-
lowing: ‘‘And debt can’t go to infinity—it 
can’t exceed total wealth, and in fact as debt 
gets ever higher people will demand ever-in-
creasing returns to hold it. So at some point 
the government would be forced to run large 
enough primary (non-interest) surpluses to 
limit debt growth.’’; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2019, Jason 
Fichtner and Kody Carmody of the Bipar-
tisan Policy Center wrote in a report enti-
tled ‘‘Does the National Debt Matter? A 
Look at Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT’’ 
that— 
(1) ‘‘deficits do have a role to play in public 
finance’’ but, ‘‘as interest rates rise, some 
private-sector projects no longer make fi-
nancial sense and are forgone. Crowding out 
private investment ultimately leads to a 
misallocation of resources away from their 
most economically productive use, ham-
pering economic growth. . . . The more we 
borrow today, the more expensive it will be 
to continue borrowing in the future. At some

free lunch.’’; 
(2) ‘‘MMT underestimates other downside 
risks of debt’’ and ‘‘MMT advocates note 
that inflation is the only restraint on debt- 
financed spending. This leads some to con-
clude that under the theory of MMT, debt is 
not a concern, as governments can simply 
print more money to pay off debt. Such a 
theory is roundly rejected by academic 
economists on both sides of the political 
spectrum.’’; 
(3) printing money has costs, including a 
‘‘loss of credibility for the government’’, an 
‘‘inflation risk’’, and exacerbating ‘‘exchange 
rates’’;

(4) ‘‘MMT assumes away politics’’ and puts 
‘‘the onus of inflation control on Congress, 
the institution that lately seems worst- 
equipped to handle it. The Federal Reserve— 
which has spent a long time building exten-
sive credibility in its commitment to fight 
inflation—would be largely sidelined.’’; 
(5) ‘‘even MMT admits that deficits and 
debt matter’’, noting that Stephanie Kelton 
has stated: ‘‘I would never take the position 
that we ought to move forward, passing leg-
islation with no offsets, to do Green New 
Deals, and Jobs Guarantees, and Medicare 
for All. In the end, MMT’s arguments largely 
boil down to a disagreement over how much 
room there is to borrow without accelerating 
inflation.’’; and 
(6) it is ‘‘hard to pin MMT down on any-
thing at all’’ due, in large part, to the fact 
that ‘‘prominent supporters of MMT have 
taken vague, sometimes contradictory posi-
tions: When politicians make claims about 
paying for the Green New Deal through 
MMT, stay silent, and when economists 
criticize this view, claim you are being mis-
understood.’’; 
Whereas the March 2019 report entitled 
‘‘How Reliable is Modern Monetary Theory 
as a Guide to Policy?’’ by Scott Sumner and 
Patrick Horan of the Mercatus Center at 
George Mason University found that— 
(1) MMT— 
(A) has a flawed model of inflation, 
which overestimates the importance of 
economic slack; 
(B) overestimates the revenue that can 
be earned from the creation of money; 
(C) overestimates the potency of fiscal 
policy, while underestimating the effec-
tiveness of monetary policy; 
(D) overestimates the ability of fiscal au-
thorities to control inflation; and 
(E) contains too few safeguards against 
the risks of excessive public debt; and 
(2) an MMT agenda of having fiscal au-
thorities manage monetary policy would run 
the risk of— 
(A) very high debts; 
(B) very high inflation; or 
(C) very high debts and very high infla-
tion, each of which may be very harmful to 
the broader economy; 
Whereas the January 2020 working paper 
entitled ‘‘A Skeptic’s Guide to Modern Mone-
tary Theory’’ by N. Gregory Mankiw stated: 
‘‘Put simply, MMT contains some kernels of 
truth, but its most novel policy prescriptions 
do not follow cogently from its premises.’’; 
Whereas the January 2019 report entitled 
‘‘Modern Monetary Theory and Policy’’ by 
Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise In-
stitute warned that ‘‘hyperinflation becomes 
a real risk’’ when a government attempts to 
pay for massive spending by printing money; 
and 
Whereas the September 2018 report entitled 
‘‘On Empty Purses and MMT Rhetoric’’ by 
George Selgin of the Cato Institute warned 
that— 
(1) when it comes to the ability of Congress 
to rely on the Treasury to cover expendi-
tures, Congress is, in 1 crucial respect, more 
constrained than an ordinary household or 
business is when that household or business 
relies on a bank to cover expenditures be-
cause, if Congress is to avoid running out of 
money, Congress cannot write checks in 
amounts exceeding the balances in the gen-
eral account of the Treasury; and 
(2) MMT theorists succeed in turning oth-
erwise banal truths about the workings of 
contemporary monetary systems into novel 
policy pronouncements that, although tanta-
lizing, are false: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
realizes 
that 
large 
deficits 
are 
unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous; 
and 
(2) recognizes— 
(A) that the acceptance of Modern Mone-
tary Theory would lead to higher deficits 
and higher inflation; and 
(B) the duty of the Senate to abandon Mod-
ern Monetary Theory in favor of mainstream 
fiscal and monetary frameworks.

RESOLUTION 
137—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD 
TUBERCULOSIS DAY TO RAISE 
AWARENESS 
ABOUT 
TUBER-
CULOSIS 
Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. 
SULLIVAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 137 
Whereas, in 2019, nearly 1⁄4 of the global 
population was infected with the tuber-
culosis bacterium (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘TB’’); 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WHO’’) 
estimates that 10,000,000 people developed TB 
in 2019, 8.2 percent of whom were also in-
fected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘HIV’’); 
Whereas, in 2019, TB killed an estimated 
1,408,000 people, causing more deaths world-
wide than any other single infectious agent; 
Whereas, globally in 2019, an estimated 
1,200,000 children developed TB, and in 2017, 
230,000 children died of TB; 
Whereas 2⁄3 of new TB infections in 2019 oc-
curred in 8 countries: India, Indonesia, 
China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, 
Bangladesh, and South Africa; 
Whereas TB is a leading killer of people in-
fected with HIV, and 208,000 people with HIV 
died of TB in 2019; 
Whereas vulnerable populations also at 
high risk for developing TB include individ-
uals who are pregnant and newborns; 
Whereas, in 2018, TB was one of the 6 lead-
ing causes of death among adult women be-
tween the ages of 15 and 49 in low-income 
countries; 
Whereas, in some settings, women with TB 
can 
face 
stigma, 
discrimination, 
and 
ostracization by their families and commu-
nities; 
Whereas the global TB epidemic and the 
spread of drug-resistant TB present a per-
sistent public health threat to the United 
States because the disease does not recognize 
borders; 
Whereas antibiotic-resistant pathogens are 
a growing problem worldwide, and drug-re-
sistant TB can occur when the drugs used to 
treat TB are mismanaged or not made con-
sistently accessible; 
Whereas studies have demonstrated direct 
person-to-person transmission of drug-resist-
ant TB; 
Whereas multi-drug resistant TB (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘MDR–TB’’) is caused 
by bacteria with resistance to rifampin and 
isoniazid, the 2 most potent treatments for 
TB infection; 
Whereas, in 2019, according to the 2020 
WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, an esti-
mated 3.3 percent of all new TB cases and 18 
percent of previously treated cases were 
MDR–TB or rifampin-resistant TB; 
Whereas, in 2019, an estimated 465,000 peo-
ple around the world developed MDR–TB or 
rifampin-resistant TB, yet only approxi-
mately 38 percent of those individuals were 
identified and treated; 
Whereas extensively drug-resistant TB (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘XDR–TB’’) is 
a rare type of TB that is resistant to nearly 
all medicines, and therefore can be very dif-
ficult and expensive to treat, especially 
among patients with HIV; 
Whereas, in 2019, every WHO region re-
ported XDR–TB cases; 
Whereas, in 2019, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘CDC’’) estimated that the aver-
age cost of treating a single patient with 
MDR–TB in the United States was $178,000, 
and the average cost of treating a patient 
with XDR–TB was even higher at $553,000, 
compared with $20,000 to treat a patient with 
drug-susceptible TB; 
Whereas, between 2005 and 2007, according 
to an analysis by CDC, MDR–TB and XDR– 
TB cases in the United States collectively 
cost the health care system an estimated 
$53,000,000; 
Whereas CDC estimates that costs result-
ing from all forms of TB in the United States 
totaled more than $608,000,000 in 2019; 
Whereas, in a 2000 report, the Institute of 
Medicine found that a decrease in TB control 
funding and the spread of HIV and acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘AIDS’’) caused a resurgence of 
TB in the late 1980s and early 1990s; 
Whereas a total of 8,916 TB cases were re-
ported in the United States in 2019, rep-
resenting all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia, and up to 13,000,000 people in the 
United States are estimated to be living with 
latent TB infection; 
Whereas 75 percent of States have reported 
an increase in the proportion of complex 
cases of TB in recent years due to factors 
such as homelessness, HIV infection, drug re-
sistance, substance abuse, refugee status, 
and other factors; 
Whereas the rate of TB disease in African 
Americans is 8 times higher than the rate of 
disease in White, non-Hispanic Americans, 
and significant disparities exist among other 
minorities in the United States, including 
Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and 
Native Americans and Alaska Natives, with 
approximately 88 percent of all reported TB 
cases in the United States in 2019 occurring 
in racial or ethnic minorities; 
Whereas smoking— 
(1) greatly increases the risks of con-
tracting TB and infection recurrence; and 
(2) impairs therapeutic efficacy; 
Whereas diabetes is a major risk factor for 
TB, and people with diabetes are more likely 
to develop and succumb to TB; 
Whereas bedaquiline is an antibiotic that 
boosts an MDR–TB patient’s chance of sur-
vival from approximately 50 percent to as 
much as 80 percent, and through a public-pri-
vate partnership, the United States Agency 
for International Development (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘USAID’’) provided ap-
proximately 105,000 treatments in 110 eligible 
countries from 2015 through 2019; 
Whereas Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, a TB 
vaccine that is known as ‘‘BCG’’, provides 
some protection to infants and young chil-
dren against serious forms of childhood TB 
but has had little epidemiologic impact on 
controlling TB worldwide; 
Whereas there is a critical need for new 
drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for control-
ling the global TB epidemic; 
Whereas, in September 2018, the United Na-
tions held the first high-level meeting on TB 
in which 120 countries, including the United 
States, signed a political declaration com-
mitting to accelerating the TB response, in-
cluding by increasing funding for TB control 
programs and research and development ef-
forts, with the goal of reaching all affected 
people with TB prevention and care; 
Whereas the enactment of the Tom Lantos 
and Henry J. Hyde United States Global 
Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, 
and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 
(Public Law 110–293; 122 Stat. 2918), and the

March 25, 2021 
Comprehensive 
Tuberculosis 
Elimination 
Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–392; 122 Stat. 4195) 
led to a historic United States commitment 
to support the global eradication of TB, in-
cluding a commitment to treat 4,500,000 TB 
patients and 90,000 MDR–TB patients be-
tween 2009 and 2013 and to provide additional 
treatment through coordinated multilateral 
efforts; 
Whereas USAID— 
(1) provides technical assistance to 55 
countries and implements bilateral programs 
in 23 high-burden TB countries that— 
(A) build capacity; and 
(B) support the adoption of state-of-the- 
art TB-related technologies; 
(2) supports the development of new diag-
nostic and treatment tools; and 
(3) supports research to develop new vac-
cines and other new methods to combat TB; 
Whereas, in 2018, USAID launched— 
(1) a new business model entitled ‘‘Global 
Accelerator to End Tuberculosis’’ to accel-
erate progress and build capacity with re-
spect to TB prevention and treatment; and 
(2) a new mechanism to directly support 
local organizations in priority countries; 
Whereas TB incidence in the countries that 
receive bilateral TB funding from the United 
States through USAID has decreased by 
more than 29 percent since 2000; 
Whereas, according to the Copenhagen 
Consensus Center, TB prevention programs 
return $56 for each dollar invested, which is 
one of the highest returns on investment of 
any health intervention; 
Whereas CDC, in partnership with other 
entities of the United States and individual 
States and territories— 
(1) directs the national TB elimination pro-
gram; 
(2) coordinates TB surveillance, technical 
assistance, and prevention activities; and 
(3) helps to support the development of new 
diagnostic, treatment, and prevention tools 
to combat TB; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health, 
through its many institutes and centers, 
plays the leading role in basic and clinical 
research on the identification, treatment, 
and prevention of TB; 
Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘Global Fund’’), to which 
the United States is a top financial donor, 
provides more than 73 percent of all inter-
national financing for TB programs; 
Whereas, in 2019, Global Fund-supported 
programs detected and treated more than 
5,700,000 cases of TB; 
Whereas 
the 
coronavirus 
disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic and mitigation efforts 
put in place as a result of the pandemic have 
taken a devastating toll on countries with 
the highest burden of TB disease and on the 
global TB response, threatening to reverse 
up to 8 years of progress fighting the disease; 
Whereas, in 2020, in the 23 high-burden TB 
countries in which USAID implements bilat-
eral programs, 1,000,000 fewer people with TB 
had access to diagnosis and treatment, a 23 
percent decline from 2019; 
Whereas, between 2020 and 2025, global pro-
jections estimate that the impact of the 
COVID–19 pandemic will lead to an addi-
tional 6,300,000 cases of TB and an additional 
1,400,000 TB deaths; and 
Whereas March 24, 2021, is World Tuber-
culosis Day, a day that commemorates the 
date in 1882 on which Dr. Robert Koch an-
nounced his discovery of Mycobacterium tu-
berculosis, the bacterium that causes TB: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of World Tuber-
culosis Day to raise awareness about tuber-
culosis; 
(2) commends the progress of tuberculosis 
elimination efforts by entities that include 
the United States Agency for International 
Development, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, the National Institutes 
of Health, the World Health Organization, 
and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber-
culosis and Malaria; and 
(3) reaffirms the commitment to strength-
en the leadership role of the United States 
in, and the effectiveness of the global re-
sponse to, the fight to end the tuberculosis 
epidemic.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO 
EXEMPT 
CERTAIN 
TECH-
NOLOGIES 
USED 
TO 
DETECT 
CHILD 
SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION 
FROM 
EUROPEAN 
UNION 
EPRIVACY DIRECTIVE 
Mr. COTTON (for himself, Mr. BOOZ-
MAN, and Ms. MURKOWSKI) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 138 
Whereas ensuring the safety of children on-
line is a global issue that nations must ad-
dress together; 
Whereas the online trafficking of child sex-
ual abuse material (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘CSAM’’) and online enticement of 
children (also known as ‘‘grooming’’) are per-
vasive problems that are growing at dra-
matic rates; 
Whereas crucial tools in detecting CSAM 
and grooming online and protecting children 
using online platforms from child predators 
are hashing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming 
technologies that are voluntarily used by 
electronic service providers (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘ESPs’’) to detect, report, 
and remove CSAM; 
Whereas the use of hashing, PhotoDNA, 
and anti-grooming technology by ESPs has 
generated millions of reports annually to the 
CyberTipline of the National Center for 
Missing & Exploited Children; 
Whereas the CyberTipline is a global hot-
line for reports related to child sexual ex-
ploitation that was authorized by Congress 
in 1998; 
Whereas in 2019, more than 69,000,000 im-
ages, videos, and files related to child sexual 
abuse were reported to the CyberTipline, 
with more than 3,000,000 of these images, vid-
eos, and files related to an offender or child 
victim in the European Union (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘EU’’); 
Whereas in a Communication to the Euro-
pean Parliament, dated July 24, 2020, the Eu-
ropean Commission noted, ‘‘the EU has be-
come the largest host of child sexual abuse 
material globally (from more than half in 
2016 to more than two thirds in 2019)’’; 
Whereas in 2018, an EU Directive extended 
the scope of prohibitions on processing per-
sonal data in the electronic communications 
sector to cover interpersonal communica-
tions, such as messenger services and e-mail; 
Whereas this EU Directive caused ESPs to 
lose 
the 
legal 
basis 
to 
use 
hashing, 
PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming technologies 
to detect and report CSAM and online en-
ticement of children to the CyberTipline; 
Whereas this EU Directive took effect on 
December 21, 2020, without any derogation to 
exempt the voluntary practice of using these 
technologies to detect and report distribu-
tion of CSAM and enticement of children for 
sexual abuse; 
Whereas the prohibition on the use of 
hashing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming tech-
nologies will have dire consequences for chil-
dren in Europe and globally; 
Whereas, since the EU Directive took ef-
fect, reports to the National Center for Miss-
ing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline 
from the EU decreased by 51 percent during 
the 6-week period immediately following the 
Directive’s implementation compared to the 
same period in 2020; 
Whereas it is unclear whether ESPs— 
(1) will be able to partition the use of hash-
ing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming tech-
nologies to carve out users in the EU; and 
(2) will decide to abandon the voluntary 
use of these technologies in the United 
States and globally; 
Whereas since children in the United 
States can be harmed by online predators in 
the EU through grooming, enticement, and 
the dissemination of CSAM images among 
EU offenders, such material should be de-
tected, reported, and removed; 
Whereas if the use of hashing, PhotoDNA, 
and anti-grooming technologies for detecting 
CSAM and grooming is stopped, the exploi-
tation of children globally will largely go 
undetected and continue to proliferate; and 
Whereas Congress agrees with the Euro-
pean Commission that ‘‘immediate action 
must be taken to address this issue’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) finds that hashing, PhotoDNA, and 
anti-grooming technologies are essential in 
detecting child sexual abuse material and ex-
ploitation online, including known and new 
CSAM, and grooming of children globally; 
and 
(2) urges the European Parliament to enact 
legislation that amends the EU Directive to 
allow electronic service providers to con-
tinue their current voluntary activities of 
using hashing, PhotoDNA, and anti-groom-
ing technologies for the purpose of detecting 
child sexual exploitation.

MURRAY, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 139 
Whereas blueberries are a native North 
American fruit, first managed and harvested 
as wild blueberries by the native Wabanaki; 
Whereas wild blueberries continue to be 
managed and harvested in Maine by farmers 
including the Wabanaki, as a native, natu-
rally occurring crop; 
Whereas the pioneering work conducted in 
New Jersey in the early 1900s by Elizabeth 
White and Dr. Frederick Coville, a botanist 
at the Department of Agriculture, to domes-
ticate wild lowbush blueberries resulted in 
the development of the hybrid for cultivated 
highbush blueberries; 
Whereas because of these early efforts, 
highbush blueberries are large, sweet, juicy 
berries that can be commercially produced 
and shipped; 
Whereas wild blueberries— 
(1) are small and sweet; and 
(2) are not planted, but still grow and are 
harvested where they have naturally oc-
curred for thousands of years;

United States agriculture with an annual 
economic impact of $4,700,000,000; 
Whereas highbush and wild blueberries 
have a total harvested area estimated at 
more than 140,000 acres and are produced in 
48 States by nearly 13,185 farms; 
Whereas 
blueberry 
production 
in 
the 
United States has continually increased, 
with particular growth in the first 2 decades 
of the 21st century, to reach a harvest of 
730,000,000 pounds in 2020; 
Whereas blueberries are low in fat and a 
source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals; 
Whereas blueberries are being studied to 
examine the role the berries may play in pro-
moting good health in areas such as cardio-
vascular health, brain health, exercise, insu-
lin response, and gut health; and 
Whereas blueberries are harvested in the 
United States from March through early 
September, with the harvest reaching its 
peak in July: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 2021 as ‘‘National Blue-
berry Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the contributions of blue-
berry growers in the United States and their 
families; and

many Asian Americans across the United 
States to feel fearful and unsafe; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric to refer to COVID–19, such as 
the ‘‘Chinese virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan virus’’, and 
‘‘kung flu’’ perpetuate anti-Asian stigma 
that has resulted in Asian Americans being 
harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes 
increased by nearly 150 percent in major cit-
ies throughout the United States; 
Whereas, according to a recent report by 
Stop AAPI Hate, there were nearly 3,800 re-
ported cases of anti-Asian discrimination re-
lated to COVID–19 between March 19, 2020 
and February 28, 2021; 
Whereas 68 percent of reported incidents of 
anti-Asian hate targeted Asian-American 
women, a population that has been histori-
cally 
marginalized, 
sexualized, 
and 
fetishized; 
Whereas, on March 19, 2021, President Joe 
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met 
with Asian-American leaders in Georgia and 
reaffirmed their strong commitment to con-
demning and combating racism, xenophobia, 
and violence targeting the Asian-American 
community; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
will always remember the victims of these 
shootings and stand in solidarity with those 
affected by this senseless tragedy: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the heinous and inexcusable 
acts of gun violence that led to the tragic 
loss of 8 lives in Georgia on March 16, 2021; 
(2) condemns any racism and sexism in the 
choice of the shooter to target Asian Amer-
ican-owned businesses and murder 6 women 
of Asian descent; 
(3) honors the memory of the victims, of-
fers heartfelt condolences to the families of 
the victims, and recognizes that the healing 
process will be long and difficult for the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity and all communities impacted by this 
tragedy; and 
(4) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States Federal Government to com-
bating hate, bigotry, and violence against 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and 
to prevent tragedies like this from ever hap-
pening again.

FOR 
NATIVE AMERICANS AND ALAS-

THE 
RESPONSIBILITY 
OF 
THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EN-
SURE SUCH WATER ACCESS 
Mr. 
BENNET 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
WYDEN, Ms. WARREN, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. HEIN-
RICH, Mr. KELLY, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. 
TESTER, and Mr. SCHATZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs: 
S. RES. 141 
Whereas access to reliable, clean drinking 
water is an essential human need that is 
critical to the public health, well-being, edu-
cational attainment, and economic develop-
ment of all communities in the United 
States; 
Whereas many countries, along with the 
United Nations, have recognized the urgency 
of water access by passing laws or resolu-
tions regarding the human right to water, 
including recognition of these needs among 
indigenous peoples and establishing aggres-
sive targets for achieving universal access to 
this basic service; 
Whereas access to reliable, clean drinking 
water has long been a significant problem in 
many Tribal communities and in many Alas-
ka Native Villages, such that nearly half of 
all Native American households still do not 
have access to reliable water sources, clean 
drinking water, and are significantly more 
likely than White households to lack indoor 
plumbing; 
Whereas reliable, clean drinking water 
may be unavailable to these households for a 
number of reasons, including because— 
(1) there is no piped water system con-
necting to the house; 
(2) the water available to the household 
does not meet minimum protective stand-
ards; 
(3) the water infrastructure is deterio-
rating or insufficient; or 
(4) Indian Tribes face challenges in sup-
porting the operation and maintenance needs 
of existing water infrastructure; 
Whereas Federal programs administered 
through the Indian Health Service of the De-
partment of Health and Human Services, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the De-
partment of Agriculture, and other Federal 
and State agencies have been unsuccessful in 
developing the infrastructure necessary to 
provide reliable, clean drinking water for 
some Tribal communities; 
Whereas many Indian Tribes have signifi-
cant unresolved claims for Federally re-
served water rights, many of which have 
been unresolved for decades and which may 
not be resolved for many years to come, due 
in part to the complex and significant issues 
typically involved in water rights adjudica-
tion and settlements; 
Whereas the development of water infra-
structure in Tribal communities has fre-
quently been conditioned on the settlement 
of such Tribal reserved water rights, and has 
been prevented or delayed by continuing un-
certainty over the status of Tribal water 
rights, by the years-long process of Tribal 
water rights settlements, or by continued 
conflict over the quantification of Tribal re-
served water rights in State water rights ad-
judications; 
Whereas the quantity of water that would 
be required to supply reliable, clean drinking 
water to provide for the basic needs of the

March 25, 2021 
residents of Tribal communities and in Alas-
ka Native Villages are typically only a small 
fraction of the total quantity of Tribal re-
served water rights; 
Whereas the trust responsibility of the 
Federal Government to Tribal nations re-
quires the Federal Government to ensure the 
survival and welfare of Indian Tribes and 
people, and the failure to provide basic water 
service cannot be reconciled with this trust 
responsibility; 
Whereas the Indian Self-Determination 
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 
et seq.) affirmed the trust responsibility of 
the Federal Government to support Tribal 
self-governance and self-determination, and 
these goals cannot be fully realized without 
addressing inequities such as ensuring access 
to reliable, clean drinking water for every 
Tribal community; 
Whereas the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic 
has had a disproportionate impact on Native 
American people due to factors including 
persistent economic disadvantages in Tribal 
communities and in Alaska Native Villages, 
racial inequity, lack of access to adequate 
health care, and lack of public health infra-
structure, including access to running water; 
and 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has pro-
vided a stark reminder that access to reli-
able, clean drinking water to support basic 
hygiene is a matter of life or death for all 
citizens of the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(A) access to reliable, clean drinking water 
in Tribal communities and in Alaska Native 
Villages is an essential human need, is crit-
ical to the health, well-being, and economic 
development of people living on such com-
munities and in such villages, and is integral 
to maintaining the public health of the en-
tire United States; 
(B) settlement or adjudication of Tribal 
claims of reserved water rights is not and 
should not be a prerequisite to the provision 
of this basic human service to households lo-
cated in Tribal communities and in Alaska 
Native Villages, nor should the provision of 
such basic human services be used to lever-
age the resolution of Tribal reserved water 
rights and claims; and 
(C) the provision of reliable, clean drinking 
water to support the domestic requirements 
of Tribal members and Tribal communities 
is an essential component of the Federal 
trust responsibility to Indian Tribes; and 
(2) the Senate— 
(A) calls upon the Federal Executive 
Branch to work in collaboration with Tribal 
governments and with any relevant State 
and local jurisdictions to expedite the plan-
ning, design, development, and operation of 
the infrastructure necessary to provide reli-
able, clean drinking water in Tribal commu-
nities and in Alaska Native Villages, and to 
inform Congress of further authorizations 
and expenditures that may be necessary to 
meet this objective; 
(B) calls upon the Federal Executive 
Branch to employ a ‘‘whole of government’’ 
approach to ensure the provision of reliable, 
clean drinking water to households in Tribal 
communities and in Alaska Native Villages 
and to create an interagency task force con-
sisting of high-level representatives from de-
partments and agencies with authority to 
provide water infrastructure that will work 
to remove barriers, optimize funding, and 
make immediate and tangible progress on 
meeting this objective and report annually 
to Congress on such progress; and 
(C) calls upon the Federal Executive 
Branch, State governments, and affected 
water agencies to affirmatively support de- 
coupling the planning, design, development, 
and operation of such infrastructure from 
the settlement or adjudication of Tribal re-
served water rights, and to support the de-
velopment of that infrastructure necessary 
to provide reliable, clean drinking water in 
Tribal communities independent of such set-
tlements or adjudications.

Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
HAGERTY, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. ROMNEY, 
and Mr. COONS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 142 
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance 
is a cornerstone of global peace and stability 
and underscores the past, present, and future 
United States commitment to the stability 
and prosperity of Japan and the Indo-Pacific 
region; 
Whereas the United States and Japan es-
tablished diplomatic relations on March 31, 
1854, with the signing of the Treaty of Peace 
and Amity; 
Whereas 2021 marks the 76th anniversary of 
the end of World War II, a conflict in which 
the United States and Japan were enemies, 
and the strength of the alliance is a testa-
ment to the ability of great nations to over-
come the past and to work together to create 
a more secure and prosperous future; 
Whereas, January 19, 2021, marked the 61st 
anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of 
Mutual Cooperation and Security between 
the United States and Japan; 
Whereas the U.S.–Japan Security Consult-
ative Committee (2+2) met on March 16, 2021, 
in Tokyo and ‘‘reaffirmed that the U.S.- 
Japan Alliance remains the cornerstone of 
peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo- 
Pacific region’’; 
Whereas the American and Japanese people 
share deeply rooted values of defending free-
dom, championing economic and social op-
portunity and inclusion, and respecting the 
rule of law; 
Whereas the peoples of Japan and the 
United States support each other in times of 
need with Japan being one of the first coun-
tries to offer assistance following the 9/11 at-
tacks and Hurricane Katrina, and Americans 
supporting Japan in the aftermath of the 
Great East Japan Earthquake, ten years ago 
this month, through Operation Tomodachi; 
Whereas the strength of the United States- 
Japan relationship is due in part to the sub-
stantial reservoir of goodwill created by the 
close ties between the American and Japa-
nese people at the grassroots level, often 
supported by the Governments of the United 
States and Japan; 
Whereas there are more than 30,000 United 
States alumni of the Government of Japan- 
sponsored Japan Exchange and Teaching 
(JET) program, including nearly 200 JET 
program alumni working at the Department 
of State; 
Whereas the Fulbright program has sent 
nearly 7,500 young Japanese on Fulbright 
scholarships to the United States since 1952, 
and there are 37 United States-based Japan- 
America Society chapters, and the United

Whereas the Governments and people of 
the United States and Japan share a com-
mitment to free and open markets, high 
standards for the free flow of commerce and 
trade, and the establishment of an inclusive 
architecture for regional and global trade 
and development; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are 
top trading partners that exchange over 
$300,000,000,000 worth of goods and services 
each year, Japan serves as the biggest cumu-
lative Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) con-
tributor to the United States and the biggest 
job creator in the United States manufac-
turing sector regarding trade, and the United 
States-Japan bilateral economic relationship 
is one of strongest in the world; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are 
working closely via whole-of-government 
initiatives, bilateral partnerships, coopera-
tion with like-minded countries, multilat-
eral mechanisms including the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and 
enhanced private-sector engagement to as-
sist countries in the Indo-Pacific and across 
the globe to catalyze investment in infra-
structure, energy, and the digital economy 
to 
promote 
connectivity 
and 
economic 
growth; 
Whereas United States-Japan economic co-
operation has also led to close collaboration 
in science and technology and promoted 
shared values in research, including on 
COVID–19 response, the digital economy, na-
tional security-focused investment screen-
ing, 
quantum 
sciences, 
artificial 
intel-
ligence, space exploration, biosciences, col-
laborative 5G networks, and interoperable 
approaches for Open RAN (radio access net-
work) technologies; 
Whereas, following a year of delay due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Japan will host the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games in the sum-
mer of 2021, bringing together athletes from 
around the world in a celebration of the re-
silience of the human spirit; 
Whereas a robust and effective trilateral 
relationship between and among the United 
States, the ROK, and Japan is critical for 
joint security and interests in defending 
freedom and democracy, upholding human 
rights, championing women’s empowerment, 
combating climate change, promoting re-

Whereas the United States welcomes Ja-
pan’s successive measures to enhance the 
role of its Self Defense Forces in securing 
peace and stability in the region and beyond, 
including its commitment on collective self 
defense under Japan’s laws, which strength-
ens the alliance’s ability to defend Japan and 
to continue safeguard regional security; 
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance 
is essential for ensuring maritime security

reaffirmed its commitment to a shared vi-
sion for an Indo-Pacific region that is ‘‘free,

Whereas people-to-people ties between the 
United States and Japan are long-standing 
and deep, as exemplified by the gift of the 
beautiful cherry trees that dot our Nation’s 
capital from the People of Japan to the Peo-

cases of COVID–19 and has recorded over 
10,000 known deaths caused by COVID–19; 
Whereas over 1,000,000 veterans lost their 
jobs because of the pandemic, with veteran 
unemployment reaching nearly 12 percent in 
April 2020; 
Whereas many veterans have experienced 
feelings of isolation and loneliness caused by 
the public health restrictions needed to curb 
the spread of COVID–19; 
Whereas, since their inception, Veterans 
Service Organizations (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘VSOs’’) have always supported 
and advocated on behalf of members of the 
Armed Forces, veterans, and their families; 
Whereas VSOs have adapted to the unique 
challenges posed by the pandemic in order to 
continue to support veterans and advocate 
for the veteran community; 
Whereas members of VSOs have fostered a 
sense of connection and community amid the 
pandemic by— 
(1) calling, emailing, or writing to fellow 
veterans; 
(2) delivering food and groceries to fellow 
veterans and their families; and 
(3) hosting virtual and socially distanced 
events; 
Whereas members of VSOs have conducted 
thousands of peer-wellness checks to combat 
the ongoing mental health crisis that has 
been exacerbated by the pandemic; 
Whereas VSOs have continued to help vet-
erans access healthcare during the pandemic 
by— 
(1) assisting veterans with enrollment in 
VA healthcare plans; 
(2) enabling access to telehealth; and 
(3) providing hundreds of thousands of 
rides to medical appointments; 
Whereas VSOs have helped veterans find 
employment by— 
(1) connecting veterans to employers; 
(2) hosting virtual job fairs; and 
(3) providing online job search resources;

in encouraging all veterans to get vac-
cinated; 
Whereas members of VSOs are volun-
teering at vaccination sites across the 
United States to help their fellow veterans 
and all other individuals in the United 
States receive the COVID–19 vaccine; and 
Whereas VSOs will continue to play an in-
strumental role representing and supporting 
the veteran community as the United States 
moves forward on the path towards recov-

(2) commends efforts by VSOs to improvise 
and adapt to the challenges posed by COVID–

S. RES. 144 
Whereas the designation of National Poi-
son Prevention Week was first authorized by 
Congress and President Kennedy in 1961 in 
Public Law 87–319 (75 Stat. 681); 
Whereas National Poison Prevention Week 
occurs during the third full week of March 
each year; 
Whereas, as of February 10, 2021, poison

related to the COVID–19 pandemic alone and 
have seen dramatic increases in cases relat-
ing to hand sanitizer and household cleaning 
products; 
Whereas poison control centers responded 
to COVID–19 related surges by conducting 
poison safety and poisoning prevention out-
reach in a virtual format during the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
Whereas the American Association of Poi-
son Control Centers (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘AAPCC’’) works with the 55 
poison control centers in the United States 
to track— 
(1) more than 1,000 commonly used house-
hold and workplace products that can cause 
poisoning; and 
(2) poisonings and the sources of those 
poisonings; 
Whereas the National Poison Data System

soning every day, and more than 130 children 
19 years of age and younger die as a result of 
being poisoned each year; 
Whereas, in 2019, children younger than 6 
years of age constituted 43 percent of all poi-
son exposures; 
Whereas, from 2000 to 2018, data from poi-
son control centers revealed a significant in-
crease of an average of 3.4 percent per year 
in the number of intentional suicide patients 
who were adolescents 10 to 24 years of age, 
and that increase disproportionately oc-
curred among females; 
Whereas, in 2021, poison control centers are 
seeing an increase in suspected suicides in 
individuals ranging from 11 to 14 years of 
age; 
Whereas, in 2019, more than 114,000 children 
19 years of age and younger were treated in 
an emergency room due to unintended pedi-
atric poisoning, and more than 90 percent of 
those incidents occurred in the home, most 
often with blood pressure medications, acet-
aminophen, laundry packets, bleach, or seda-
tives or anti-anxiety medication; 
Whereas there was a 444 percent increase in 
pediatric magnet ingestion cases reported to 
United States poison control centers from 
2018 to 2019 based on an analysis of the Na-
tional Poison Data System (NPDS), dem-
onstrating the significant risk of injury from 
high-powered magnet ingestions; 
Whereas 70,237 cases of death due to drug 
overdose were reported in the United States 
in 2017, and the majority of those cases, ap-
proximately 68 percent, involved an opioid;

cations that adults called the poison help 
line about were prescription and non-pre-
scription pain relievers, household cleaning 
substances, cosmetics and personal care 
products, and antidepressants; 
Whereas pain medications lead the list of 
the most common substances implicated in 
adult poison exposures, and are the single 
most frequent cause of pediatric fatalities 
reported to the AAPCC; 
Whereas poison control centers issue guid-
ance and provide support to individuals, in-
cluding individuals who experience medica-
tion and dosing errors; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of calls to 
the poison help line are from individuals 20 
years of age or older, with more than half of 
those calls involving patients older than 50 
years of age, and a common reason for those 
calls is therapeutic errors, including ques-
tions regarding drug interactions, incorrect 
dosing route, timing of doses, and double 
doses; 
Whereas normal, curious children younger 
than 6 years of age are in stages of growth 
and development in which they are con-
stantly exploring and investigating the 
world around them, and are often unable to 
read or recognize warning labels; 
Whereas the AAPCC engages in community 
outreach by educating the public on poison 
safety and poisoning prevention, and pro-
vides educational resources, materials, and 
guidelines to educate the public on poisoning 
prevention; 
Whereas individuals can reach a poison 
control center from anywhere in the United 
States by calling the poison help line at 1- 
800-222-1222; 
Whereas, despite regulations of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission requiring 
that a child-resistant package be designed or 
constructed to be significantly difficult for 
children under 5 years of age to open, or ob-
tain a harmful amount of the contents, with-
in a reasonable time, children can still open 
child-resistant packages; and 
Whereas, each year during National Poison 
Prevention Week, the Federal Government 
assesses the progress made by the Federal 
Government in saving lives and reaffirms the 
national commitment of the Federal Govern-
ment to preventing injuries and deaths from 
poisoning: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the week of March 21 
through March 27, 2021, as ‘‘National Poison 
Prevention Week’’; 
(2) expresses gratitude for the people who 
operate or support poison control centers in 
their local communities; 
(3) expresses gratitude for frontline work-
ers supporting poison prevention during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
(4) supports efforts and resources to pro-
vide poison prevention guidance or emer-
gency assistance in response to poisonings; 
and 
(5) encourages— 
(A) the people of the United States to edu-
cate their communities and families about 
poison safety and poisoning prevention; and 
(B) health care providers to practice and 
promote poison safety and poisoning preven-
tion.

SENATE RESOLUTION 145—DESIG-
NATING THE FIRST WEEK OF 
APRIL 2021 AS ‘‘NATIONAL AS-
BESTOS AWARENESS WEEK’’ 
Mr. 
TESTER 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, 
Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, 
Mr. 
DAINES, Mr. CARPER, and Mr. DURBIN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 145 
Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are in-
visible and cannot be smelled or tasted; 
Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbes-
tos fibers can cause significant damage; 
Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer 
(such as mesothelioma), asbestosis, and 
other health problems; 
Whereas symptoms of asbestos-related dis-
eases can take between 10 and 50 years to 
present themselves; 
Whereas the projected life expectancy for 
an individual diagnosed with mesothelioma 
is between 6 and 24 months; 
Whereas little is known about late-stage 
treatment of asbestos-related diseases, and 
there is no cure for those diseases; 
Whereas early detection of asbestos-re-
lated diseases may give some patients in-
creased treatment options and may improve 
the prognoses of those patients; 
Whereas, although the consumption of as-
bestos within the United States has been 
substantially reduced, the United States 
continues to consume tons of the fibrous 
mineral each year for use in certain prod-
ucts; 
Whereas thousands of people in the United 
States have died from asbestos-related dis-
eases and thousands more die every year 
from those diseases; 
Whereas, although individuals continue to 
be exposed to asbestos, safety measures re-
lating to the prevention of asbestos exposure 
have significantly reduced the incidence of 
asbestos-related diseases and can further re-
duce the incidence of those diseases; 
Whereas thousands of workers in the 
United States face significant asbestos expo-
sure, which has been a cause of occupational 
cancer; 
Whereas a significant percentage of vic-
tims of asbestos-related diseases were ex-
posed to asbestos on naval ships and in ship-
yards; 
Whereas asbestos was used in the construc-
tion of a significant number of office build-
ings and public facilities built before 1975; 
Whereas people in the small community of 
Libby, Montana, suffer from asbestos-related 
diseases, including mesothelioma, at a sig-
nificantly higher rate than individuals in the 
United States as a whole; and 
Whereas the designation of a ‘‘National As-
bestos Awareness Week’’ will raise public 
awareness about the prevalence of asbestos- 
related diseases and the dangers of asbestos 
exposure: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the first week of April 2021 
as ‘‘National Asbestos Awareness Week’’; 
(2) urges the Surgeon General of the United 
States to warn and educate people about the 
public health issue of asbestos exposure, 
which may be hazardous to their health; and 
(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolu-
tion to the Office of the Surgeon General.

SENATE RESOLUTION 146—DESIG-
NATING APRIL 2021 AS ‘‘SECOND 
CHANCE MONTH’’ 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 146 
Whereas every individual is endowed with 
human dignity and value; 
Whereas redemption and second chances 
are values of the United States; 
Whereas millions of citizens of the United 
States have a criminal record; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals return to their communities from Fed-
eral and State prisons every year; 
Whereas individuals returning from Fed-
eral and State prisons have paid their debt 
for committing crimes but still face signifi-
cant legal and societal barriers (referred to 
in 
this 
preamble 
as 
‘‘collateral 
con-
sequences’’); 
Whereas collateral consequences for an in-
dividual returning from a Federal or State 
prison are often mandatory and take effect 
automatically, regardless of— 
(1) whether there is a nexus between the 
crime and public safety; 
(2) the seriousness of the crime; 
(3) the time that has passed since the indi-
vidual committed the crime; or 
(4) the efforts of the individual to make 
amends or earn back the trust of the public; 
Whereas, for individuals returning to their 
communities from Federal and State pris-
ons, gaining meaningful employment is one 
of the most significant predictors of success-
ful reentry and has been shown to reduce fu-
ture criminal activity; 
Whereas many individuals who have been 
incarcerated struggle to find employment 
because of collateral consequences, which 
are often not directly related to the offenses 
the individuals committed or any proven 
public safety benefit; 
Whereas many States have laws that pro-
hibit an individual with a criminal record 
from working in certain industries or obtain-
ing professional licenses; 
Whereas, in addition to employment, edu-
cation has also been shown to be a signifi-
cant predictor of successful reentry for indi-
viduals returning from Federal and State 
prisons; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record often has a lower level of educational 
attainment than the general population and 
has significant difficulty acquiring admis-
sion to, and funding for, educational pro-
grams; 
Whereas an individual who has been con-
victed of certain crimes is often barred from 
receiving the financial aid necessary to ac-
quire additional skills and knowledge; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record—

S1838 
March 25, 2021 
(1) faces collateral consequences in secur-
ing a place to live; and 
(2) is often barred from seeking access to 
public housing; 
Whereas collateral consequences prevent 
millions of individuals in the United States 
from contributing fully to their families and 
communities; 
Whereas collateral consequences can con-
tribute to recidivism, which increases crime 
and victimization and decreases public safe-
ty; 
Whereas collateral consequences have par-
ticularly impacted underserved communities 
of color and community rates of employ-
ment, housing stability, and recidivism; 
Whereas the inability to find gainful em-
ployment and other collateral consequences 
of conviction inhibit the economic mobility 
of an individual with a criminal record, 
which can negatively impact the well-being 
of the children and families of the individual 
for generations; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and eco-
nomic and public health consequences of the 
COVD–19 pandemic have made the pursuit of 
gainful employment and access to commu-
nity supports more daunting for individuals 
with a criminal record; 
Whereas the bipartisan First Step Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194) was 
signed into law on December 21, 2018, to in-
crease opportunities for individuals incarcer-
ated in Federal prisons to participate in 
meaningful recidivism reduction programs 
and prepare for their second chances; 
Whereas the programs authorized by the 
Second Chance Act of 2007 (Public Law 110– 
199; 122 Stat. 657)— 
(1) have provided reentry services to more 
than 164,000 individuals in 49 States and the 
District of Columbia since the date of enact-
ment of the Act; and 
(2) were reauthorized by the First Step Act 
of 2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194); 
Whereas the anniversary of the death of 
Charles Colson, who used his second chance 
following his incarceration for a Watergate- 
related crime to found Prison Fellowship, 
the largest program in the United States 
that provides outreach to prisoners, former 
prisoners, and their families, falls on April 
21; and 
Whereas the designation of April as ‘‘Sec-
ond Chance Month’’ may contribute to— 
(1) increased public awareness about— 
(A) 
the 
impact 
of 
collateral 
con-
sequences; and 
(B) the need for closure for individuals 
with a criminal record who have paid their 
debt; and 
(2) opportunities for individuals, employ-
ers, congregations, and communities to ex-
tend second chances to those individuals: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2021 as ‘‘Second Chance 
Month’’; 
(2) honors the work of communities, gov-
ernmental institutions, nonprofit organiza-
tions, congregations, employers, and individ-
uals to remove unnecessary legal and soci-
etal barriers that prevent individuals with 
criminal records from becoming productive 
members of society; and 
(3) calls upon the people of the United 
States to observe ‘‘Second Chance Month’’ 
through actions and programs that— 
(A) promote awareness of those unneces-
sary legal and social barriers; and 
(B) provide closure for individuals with a 
criminal record who have paid their debt. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 147—RECOG-
NIZING THE NATIONAL DEBT AS 
A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECU-
RITY 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, and Ms. 
ERNST) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: 
S. RES. 147 
Whereas, in September 2020, the total pub-
lic 
debt 
outstanding 
was 
more 
than 
$26,000,000,000,000, resulting in a total inter-
est expense of more than $371,000,000,000 for 
fiscal year 2020; 
Whereas, in September 2019, the total pub-
lic debt as a percentage of gross domestic 
product was about 100 percent; 
Whereas leaders of the Congressional Budg-
et Office and the Government Accountability 
Office have testified that— 
(1) the growth of the public debt is 
unsustainable; and 
(2) Congress must undertake extensive fis-
cal consolidation to combat that growth; 
Whereas the last Federal budget surplus 
occurred in 2001; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, Federal tax re-
ceipts totaled $3,420,000,000,000, but Federal 
outlays totaled $6,652,000,000,000, leaving the 
Federal Government with a 1-year deficit of 
$3,132,000,000,000; 
Whereas, since the last Federal budget sur-
plus occurred in 2001, Congress— 
(1) has failed to maintain a fiscally respon-
sible budget; and 
(2) has had to raise the debt ceiling repeat-
edly; 
Whereas the Medicare Board of Trustees 
projects that the Medicare Hospital Insur-
ance Trust Fund will be depleted in 2026; 
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare 
Boards of Trustees project that the Dis-
ability Insurance and the Federal Old-Age 
and Survivors Insurance Trust Funds will be 
depleted in 2026 and 2031, respectively; 
Whereas heavy indebtedness increases the 
exposure of the Federal Government to in-
terest rate risks; 
Whereas the credit rating of the United 
States was reduced by Standard and Poor’s 
from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011, and has 
remained at that level ever since; 
Whereas, without a targeted effort to bal-
ance the Federal budget, the credit rating of 
the United States will continue to fall; 
Whereas improvements in the business cli-
mate in populous countries, and aging popu-
lations around the world, will likely con-
tribute to higher global interest rates; 
Whereas more than $7,000,000,000,000 of Fed-
eral debt is owned by individuals not located 
in the United States, including more than 
$1,000,000,000,000 of which is owned by individ-
uals in China; 
Whereas China and the European Union are 
developing alternative payment systems to 
weaken the dominant position of the United 
States dollar as a reserve currency; 
Whereas rapidly increasing interest rates 
will squeeze all policy priorities of the 
United States, including defense policy and 
foreign policy priorities; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy of 
the United States, as of the date of adoption 
of this resolution, highlights the need to re-
duce the national debt through fiscal respon-
sibility; 
Whereas, on April 12, 2018, former Sec-
retary of Defense James Mattis warned that 
‘‘any Nation that can’t keep its fiscal house 
in order eventually cannot maintain its mili-
tary power’’; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2018, Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats warned: ‘‘Our 
continued plunge into debt is unsustainable 
and represents a dire future threat to our 
economy and to our national security’’; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2017, former Sec-
retaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Car-
ter, and Chuck Hagel warned: ‘‘Increase in 
the debt will, in the absence of a comprehen-
sive budget that addresses both entitlements 
and revenues, force even deeper reductions in 
our national security capabilities’’; and 
Whereas, on September 22, 2011, former 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mi-
chael Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe the single, 
biggest threat to our national security is 
debt’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that the national debt is a 
threat to the national security of the United 
States; 
(2) realizes that persistent, structural defi-
cits are unsustainable, irresponsible, and 
dangerous; and 
(3) commits to addressing the looming fis-
cal crisis faced by the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1840 
March 25, 2021 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Adewale O. Adeyemo, of Cali-
fornia, to be Deputy Secretary of the 
Treasury. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nomination. 
NOMINATION OF ADEWALE D. ADEYEMO 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate is debating the nomination of 
Wally Adeyemo to serve as the next 
Deputy Treasury Secretary. I expect 
his nomination is going to pass with a 
big, bipartisan margin, but I want to 
take a few minutes to lay out a few 
reasons why every Senator ought to 
support this nominee. 
First, you hear a lot these days about 
how Members of the Senate are looking 
for unity. Three weeks ago, the Fi-
nance 
Committee 
approved 
the 
Adeyemo nomination unanimously by 
voice vote, and you can’t get more uni-
fied than that. 
That unanimous vote followed an ex-
cellent hearing, in which Mr. Adeyemo 
demonstrated his command of all the 
various issues the Treasury is con-
fronting today. A severe jobs crisis. 
Worsening 
inequality. 
A 
dangerous 
shortage of domestic manufacturing in 
critical areas of our economy. Intense 
economic competition with China, in-
cluding job rip-offs and trade cheating 
that have undermined American work-
ers for too long. And many other big 
challenges. 
Members understand that there will 
be policy disagreements with the other 
party, but Mr. Adeyemo made it clear 
that he wants to work on a bipartisan 
basis to confront these challenges. 
Members take him seriously on that 
and trust him because he has done it 
before at the Treasury as a member of 
the Obama administration. 
Second, the pandemic economic cri-
sis is far from over, and it is essential 
that the Treasury Department has its 
leadership team in place. COVID cases 
and deaths are still tragically high. 
Jobless claims are still incredibly 
high—they spent an entire year above 
the previous peaks. So millions of fam-
ilies in Oregon and around the country 
are still walking an economic tight-
rope, and that is one of the key reasons 
why Senate Democrats passed the 
American Rescue Plan earlier this 
month. 
The Treasury is right at the center of 
the enormous effort to implement that 
legislation. It is extraordinarily chal-
lenging work. Getting relief payments 
out to tens of millions of Americans in 
a timely way. Saving millions of jobs 
at the State and local level, particu-
larly teachers, firefighters and munic-
ipal workers. Launching a landmark 
expansion and reinvention of the child 
tax credit to cut child poverty in half. 
This is difficult work. It requires the 
kind of strong and committed leader-
ship that Wally Adeyemo will bring to 
the Treasury Department. 
I am also looking forward to working 
with him on the issue of shell compa-
nies. Late last year Congress passed 
landmark legislation to end the use of 
anonymous shell companies in the 
United States. Several members of the 
Finance Committee had spent years 
working to get that legislation passed. 
Now that it has become law, it is up to 
the Treasury Department to write 
strong rules and implement it. This is 
a vital challenge, and it is a long time 
coming. So I am very much looking 
forward to working with Mr. Adeyemo 
once he is confirmed. He is as highly 
qualified as they come. He is also a his-
tory-making nominee because he will 
be the first African American Deputy 
Treasury Secretary. 
I support his nomination 100 percent. 
He got 100 percent of the Finance Com-
mittee’s support a few weeks ago. I be-
lieve he will have strong bipartisan 
support from the Senate, and I urge all 
Members to vote to confirm this nomi-
nation. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise in opposition to the nomination 
of Wally Adeyemo for Deputy Sec-
retary of the Treasury, 
The U.S. Treasury Department plays 
a significant part in enforcing Amer-
ican foreign policy through economic 
sanctions. We know that sanctions 
work and that the strong application of 
these measures against adversaries, in-
cluding Communist China, Iran, North 
Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nica-
ragua, are essential to holding the bru-
tal dictators and their enablers who 
hold power in these nations account-
able. 
Communist China is the biggest 
threat our Nation faces. Communist 
China 
is 
committing 
a 
genocide 
against the Uyghurs, stripping Hong 
Kongers of their basic rights, and con-
tinues to threaten to take Taiwan by 
force. 
I 
am 
concerned 
that 
Mr. 
Adeyemo does not understand the risk 
Communist China poses to our national 
and economic security and to our al-
lies. Communist China is not a stra-
tegic competitor; they are an adver-
sary and must be treated as such. Any 
U.S. official who thinks that Com-
munist China can play a positive role 
in the world is mistaken. 
I 
am 
also 
concerned 
that 
Mr. 
Adeyemo will not be strong when 
standing up to Castro’s Communist re-
gime in Cuba. I cannot support anyone 
who will back a return to the failed 
Obama-Biden 
appeasement 
policies, 
which did nothing to help the Cuban 
people and allowed Havana to extend 
its reach and expand its control, giving 
power to other ruthless dictatorships 
in Latin America. 
Currently, our Nation is on track to 
reach $30 trillion in debt. We have to 
get serious about Federal spending and 
the impacts it will have on our chil-
dren 
and 
grandchildren. 
President 
Biden’s massive spending policies are 
already causing the cost of living in 
America to rise. I cannot support can-
didates who think the solution to 
America’s economic woes is more gov-
ernment, more taxes and more regula-
tion, not more individual opportunity. 
That is wrong and will only send us 
further into debt and our families fur-
ther into despair. We need to focus on 
growing the economy and growing jobs 
in order to preserve the American 
dream. 
For all these reasons, I oppose Mr. 
Adeyemo’s nomination and urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Adeyemo nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion to reconsider is considered made 
and laid upon the table, and the Presi-
dent will be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action.

MORNING BUSINESS—Continued

ator from Mississippi.

ALEXEI NAVALNY 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise this afternoon to call attention to 
a courageous Russian hero who is in 
danger even as I speak. He is a man 
who has consistently stood up to Vladi-
mir Putin and his cronies and has, on 
numerous occasions, placed his own life 
in jeopardy to bring the truth to light. 
The lawless thugs in the Kremlin often 
avoid saying his name in public, but 
here on the Senate floor, I am proud to 
stand 
in 
solidarity 
with 
Alexei 
Navalny. 
It was just last August that Alexei 
Navalny, Russia’s foremost opposition 
leader, was poisoned with a deadly 
nerve agent. Millions of us remember 
seeing the video of his being stricken 
on an airplane and hearing his painful 
cries, the crew members unsure how to 
soothe his pain. Thanks to the quick 
diplomatic work of our friends in Ger-
many, Mr. Navalny was evacuated to 
Berlin, where he received expert med-
ical attention and, against all odds, re-
covered from this poisoning. 
An ordinary man would have stayed 
safe and very far away from the Krem-
lin, but Alexei Navalny is no ordinary 
man. He is a Russian patriot who envi-
sions a different kind of Russia, one 
where citizens have a say in govern-
ment, 
where 
freedom 
blooms, 
and 
where the President does not siphon 
away funds intended for hospitals in 
order to build secret palaces or to en-
rich members of his kleptocracy. 
So, 3 months ago, Mr. Navalny re-
turned to Russia, knowing full well the 
dangers he would face. Immediately 
upon his arrival, he was arrested at the 
airport for a parole violation, which re-
sulted from his hospitalization, which 
resulted from his poisoning. He now 
sits in one of the most notorious penal 
colonies in Russia, known for its psy-
chological torture. He has been deemed 
a flight risk and is awakened eight 
times a night under the guise of moni-
toring his whereabouts. His lawyers 
were recently prevented from seeing 
him. Reports are that he is suffering 
from severe back pain and other health

concerns and has received inadequate 
medical care. 
This is a familiar sounding story, but 
one thing is clear: The Russian dicta-
torship is terrified of Alexei Navalny. 
He is a threat to them because he has 
exposed their unbridled corruption and 
urged voters to demand that the gov-
ernment respect their rights. Because 
of that, Alexei Navalny’s life is in dan-
ger at this very moment. 
The tens of thousands of demonstra-
tors who turned out across Russia to 
support this jailed opposition leader 
send an unmistakable message to the 
Kremlin: You cannot suppress the 
voice of the people indefinitely. 
Freedom-loving Americans and free-
dom-loving people around the world 
are, today, crying out for justice for 
Alexei Navalny. He endures the suf-
fering of many before him—in Russia, 
people like Sergei Magnitsky and Boris 
Nemtsov and, abroad, people like Nel-
son Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi— 
whose legacies and movements did not 
rot while they were in prison but, in-
stead, helped to bring down oppressive 
governments. 
At this point, I yield to the Senator 
from Colorado for a brief intervention 
before I close with a thought or two. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
rise on behalf of Senator CARDIN, who 
is a Democrat from the State of Mary-
land and an original cosponsor of this 
bill with Senator WICKER, to say what 
he would have said if he had been here 
today, which is that Alexei Navalny is 
a Russian patriot, that he is a prisoner 
of conscience, and that we need to 
stand up to Russia’s human rights vio-
lations. 
Thank you. 
Mr. WICKER. In reclaiming my time, 
I appreciate the work of my friend Sen-
ator CARDIN. 
Senator COONS from Delaware was 
also here, but, unfortunately, he had to 
leave. 
They also wanted to make it clear 
that, on a bipartisan basis, on both 
sides of the aisle, the U.S. Senate 
stands for freedom-loving people in 
Russia and for their spokesman, Alexei 
Navalny. We intend to shine the light 
of public opinion on the actions of the 
Russian kleptocracy and dictatorship 
with regard to prisoners and patriots 
like Alexei Navalny. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Ohio.

CONFIRMATION OF ADEWALE O. 
ADEYEMO 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, be-
fore we hear from Senator BOOKER and 
Senator BENNET and Senator WARNOCK 
on one of the best things this Senate 
has done in my career, that being the 
extension of the child tax credit and 
the earned income tax credit, I just 
want to say a few words about someone 
we just voted on at the Department of 
the Treasury who is so, so important, 
Adewale Adeyemo, who will be Janet 
Yellen’s—one exemplary Treasury Sec-
retary—Chief of Staff. He is a terrific 
public servant. 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO, the Presiding 
Officer, and I were talking a few min-
utes ago about the importance of the 
Treasury 
Department 
in 
so 
many 
things from the child tax credit, to the 
pension bill, to so many things that we 
do that matter—getting the $1,400 
checks out and making sure our tax 
system is fair. 
Senator BENNET and I serve together 
with Senator CORTEZ MASTO and others 
on the Committee on Finance. What 
that means and what we are trying to 
do on that committee is to take away 
the 50-percent-off coupon from corpora-
tions that shut down production in 
Reno or in Boulder or in Cleveland or 
in Newark and move overseas. They 
get, essentially, a 50-percent-off coupon 
on their taxes. We need to close those 
loopholes. We need a Treasury Sec-
retary, and we need Adewale Adeyemo, 
who will make a huge difference in our 
work there. 
So I thank Senator SCHUMER
and 
those on both sides of the aisle for fi-
nally confirming him today and get-
ting him to work. 
I yield to Senator BENNET, who, I 
think, is going to start or, maybe, Sen-
ator BOOKER. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, President 
Biden signed the American Rescue 
Plan into law. He ushered in some of 
the 
most 
transformative 
economic 
policies to come out of Washington in 
generations. 
By expanding access to and eligi-
bility for the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan is going to lift 10 mil-
lion kids above or closer to the poverty 
line and put money in the pockets of 17 
million American workers across the 
country. 
I want to start out by noting that 
both the income—low-income and mid-
dle-income families and workers poten-
tially qualify for these credits, and 
they will be issued periodically via 
check and direct deposit. American 
workers should know this was a pro-
found change that will benefit you. 
American workers also have to know 
that they won’t have to wait until next 
year. You won’t have to start to see ad-
vanced payments of these credits 6, 7, 
10 months down—you will see them as 
early as July. And because of the 
changes that we made, if you didn’t 
previously qualify because you didn’t 
have a high enough income, you could 
be eligible now. 
I am so proud to be here today along-
side Senator BROWN, Senator BENNET, 
Senator WARNOCK, the Presiding Offi-
cer, who are in large part responsible 
for this powerful lifeline to the Amer-
ican people and, critically, for our chil-
dren. 
Senator 
BENNET, 
Senator 
BROWN, 
Senator WARNOCK, thank you. You are 
champions who have been fighting in 
and out of the Senate and understand 
not just the economic urgency but the 
moral urgency to address poverty. And 
that is really what we are all here to 
talk about—the urgency of the crisis of 
poverty and specifically child poverty. 
In America, this is unacceptable. In 
the wealthiest Nation on the planet 
Earth, the question of poverty is not 
one of inevitability; it is one of policy 
choice. It is not if we can do some-
thing; it is will we do something. 
Tonight, I am going home to Newark, 
driving very soon, where I have lived 
over the past 20 years. I am proud to 
call Newark home. I am proud to be a 
part of a community of people who 
take care of each other. I am proud to 
be part of a community that is rich 
with dignity, rich with activism and 
intellect and engagement. 
But we are also a community, like so 
many others in America, that still 
struggles. According to the last census, 
the median income for the census track 
that I live in was about $14,000 per 
household, and that was before the 
dual public health and economic crises 
of the COVID pandemic. 
And in my community, like many 
others, urban and rural, across Amer-
ica, adults aren’t the only ones strug-
gling; our kids are too. In fact, the 
poorest age group in America is our 
children, with one in six American kids 
living in poverty. It is nothing less 
than a moral obscenity that the richest 
Nation in the world should have the 
highest rates of child poverty in the de-
veloped world. 
For adults, poverty has a technical 
definition. It is a federally defined 
guideline—an amount of annual income 
that you fall under that also takes into 
account how many people are in your 
household. 
For kids, poverty is defined by what 
they experience every single day, by 
what happens to them. It is growing up 
being more likely to deal with food in-
security, not knowing where your next 
meal will come from or when it will 
come. It is facing housing insecurity. A 
quarter of kids living in poverty will 
have gone through an eviction before 
they turn 15 years old. 
Kids in poverty have worse health 
outcomes, worse educational outcomes, 
and are more likely to become en-
trapped in our broken criminal justice 
system. And kids who grow up in pov-
erty are more likely to be poor as 
adults. 
Study after study has shown how 
children who live in poverty have high-
er levels of stress hormones. The stress 
of poverty literally affects their brains. 
It inhibits brain development. It is vio-
lence against the brain of a child. 
One child poverty expert described 
the stress hormones that are con-
stantly released in kids growing up in 
poverty as similar to the feeling that 
an adult would get after a car crash— 
every single day. This is violence. 
We know that when a child experi-
ences poverty, there are lifelong psy-
chological and physiological effects 
they carry with them. Study after 
study after study has borne this out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1842 
March 25, 2021 
For kids, poverty is literally dangerous 
for their development, dangerous for 
their health, and they could have per-
manent and lasting damage to their 
brains. 
The cruelty of this crisis is that no 
parent would ever choose that for their 
child. Poor parents do not choose for 
their kids to experience the daily trau-
ma of poverty. They do not choose to 
condemn their kids to a life of worse 
education outcomes, worse health out-
comes. 
What we must understand is that 
child poverty is not a choice that low- 
income parents make. It is a failure of 
our country to take collective respon-
sibility for the well-being of American 
children. This is a moral sin. It is not 
a sin to be poor but a sin to tolerate 
such poverty in our communities. 
Almost 2 weeks ago, Congress and 
President Biden made the choice to do 
something about this American sin, 
this unacceptable reality, this moral 
obscenity—the violence happening to 
so many children. They did something 
about it; we did something about it in 
the American Rescue Plan. And now we 
are calling on our—really, we are on 
our way for a year to cut child poverty 
in half; for Black children more than in 
half, 52 percent; for Hispanic children, 
by 45 percent; for Native American 
children, by 62 percent. 
That is millions of kids across the 
country who will not face the violence 
of poverty. In New Jersey, that is 89,000 
kids and their families who are not just 
going to be lifted out of poverty but 
will be given the opportunities and the 
freedoms that come with being able to 
build a life and a future beyond with-
out the trauma that comes with pov-
erty. 
That is why we are together here this 
afternoon—because lifting kids out of 
poverty is not just about ending a cri-
sis but about beginning a new Amer-
ican tradition of giving every child 
what every child should have in Amer-
ica as a birthright. It is about creating 
freedom and liberty from the oppres-
sion of poverty. We have the power to 
do this. We have the tools to do it, and 
we know it makes good economic sense 
to get kids and adults out of poverty. 
I love what James Baldwin wrote. He 
said: ‘‘Anyone who has ever struggled 
with poverty knows how . . . expensive 
it is to be poor.’’ Well, that is also true 
for our country. Whether we realize it 
or not, child poverty is expensive for 
all of us, costing our country $1.1 tril-
lion every year. But investing in end-
ing poverty benefits us all. Every dol-
lar spent on combating child poverty 
saves this Nation $7 down the road; $1 
invested saves us $7 later. Other coun-
tries, our peers, have made these kinds 
of investments in children and families 
and have reaped rewards that we are 
denying ourselves. 
Expanding the child tax credit and 
the earned income tax credit and mak-
ing them permanent are proven, data- 
driven, evidence-based, result-apparent 
ways to respond to some of the most 
morally and economically urgent chal-
lenges of the United States of America. 
These are the kinds of investments in 
our people that will change life trajec-
tories and have a ripple effect for gen-
erations yet to come. 
If you give the child—a child firmer 
ground on which to grow, they will 
blossom and reap a harvest beyond our 
imagination. But if you punish them in 
the trauma, in the violence of poverty, 
you decimate not just their destinies 
but all of our destinies. 
I am so grateful to have champions 
that are here today alongside me in 
this effort, and, together, I know this 
is a crisis we are going to meet, and 
this crisis we can overcome. I am proud 
of the work we have done. Now we 
should make those changes to the 
earned income tax credit and the child 
tax credit permanent. 
I am proud to pass the microphone 
and the moment on to a great cham-
pion of the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit, one of the 
original authors of the legislation that 
was pulled from for our recovery plan, 
and that is the Senator from Ohio, 
SHERROD BROWN. 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Senator. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK.) The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, thanks 
to Senator BOOKER. I will be very brief. 
I want to hear from Senator BENNET, 
and I know that the Presiding Officer 
is going to switch chairs and be out 
here speaking on this. 
I am so appreciative of the Presiding 
Officer, who won his election just in— 
on January 5. He was declared the win-
ner—I don’t know. Georgia elections 
are a little different from those of us 
from other places, and as soon as he 
was named the winner of that election, 
he came here and has been in the Sen-
ate about 6 or 7 weeks now and is al-
ready a leader on this fight that Sen-
ator BOOKER talked about in the child 
tax credit and the earned income tax 
credit. 
I have been here long enough to re-
member when the earned income tax 
credit was—people just didn’t know 
much about it, including our constitu-
ents. 
I used to, when I was a Member of the 
House, I would ask accountants—CPAs 
and public accountants—to volunteer 
their time a couple of Saturdays a 
month for the 2 or 3 months before 
April 15. They would volunteer their 
time, and we encouraged people to sign 
up for the earned income tax credit, 
and people making $20,000 or $25,000 a 
year with kids would often get $2,000 or 
$3,000 in a tax refund, in real dollars 
back, because they benefited from the 
earned income tax credit. 
So what Senator BENNET and I have 
worked on for a number of years is to 
continue to expand the earned income 
tax credit and now a big expansion of 
the child tax credit. Senator BENNET 
has led on that issue, on that expan-
sion, and we worked together with Sen-
ator BOOKER and now Senator WARNOCK 
to make a huge difference. 
When I voted from this chair on Jan-
uary—I am sorry, on March 6, we had 
been in session all night. We had voted 
time after time after time. It was a 
partisan vote. 
I mean, partisanship is not what Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and my Republican 
colleagues say it is. Something that is 
partisan or nonpartisan is what the 
voters think, and the voters over-
whelmingly support the earned income 
tax credit, the child tax credit, and the 
whole American Rescue Plan Act, and 
it will make such a huge difference in 
peoples’ lives. 
But I remember after that vote—it 
was 1 o’clock in the afternoon. I was 
walking out of the building to drive 
back to Ohio. I drive every week or a 
young man drives with me every week 
back home. And a reporter stopped me 
and said: What do you think? I said: 
This is the best day of my political life 
because we—what we did, as CORY 
BOOKER said, we are cutting the child 
poverty rate in half. 
In my State—and I don’t think Colo-
rado or Georgia is much different. In 
my State, 92 percent of children in my 
State—92 percent of children will ben-
efit from the child tax credit and their 
families often also benefit from the 
earned income tax credit. What is not 
to love about that? 
That is why, like, 40 Democratic Sen-
ators are signing a letter to the Presi-
dent of the United States, asking—we 
have done this for a year, this expan-
sion to the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit. We should do 
it permanently, and that is what—that 
is the mission that the four of us Sen-
ators sitting in this room have, is to 
make sure this is permanent because 
we know there will likely be good eco-
nomic growth next quarter, the quarter 
after, in large part, because of what we 
have done with this rescue act. There 
will be strong economic growth, but I 
want to make sure that growth is 
shared by people at the bottom. 
And it so often isn’t. We have seen 
for 20 years—30 years we have seen ex-
ecutive compensation explode upward. 
We have seen profits up. We have seen 
worker productivity is up, but workers’ 
wages are flat. That is why, in the 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee, we are working so hard to 
make sure that we provide more hous-
ing for people so that people have safe, 
affordable, accessible housing in this 
country because, too often, they don’t. 
That committee is called the Senate 
Banking Committee around here. It is 
officially Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs, but for years it is all about 
banking and Wall Street and very little 
about housing and urban affairs. We 
are changing that. We are changing 
that, in part, because this body, under 
Senator BENNET’s leadership and oth-
ers—this body is actually going to do 
the right thing, as CORY BOOKER said, 
and make sure that America’s children 
have greater opportunities than they 
have had in the past. That is why I am 
thrilled to be a part of this effort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1843 
March 25, 2021 
I yield to my friend from Colorado, 
Senator BENNET. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado is recognized. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, thank 
you very much for being a part of this 
effort, and I want to thank my col-
league from Ohio for his extraordinary 
leadership from the very beginning on 
both of these bills. He led on the EITC 
bill, and I was very grateful to have the 
chance to be with him on that, and I on 
the child tax credit, and he was my 
partner from the very beginning on 
that, as was Senator BOOKER and Sen-
ator HARRIS, before she became Vice 
President HARRIS. 
I have only been here for 11 years, 
Mr. President, and you have been here 
a shorter time than that, and I never 
thought this day would come. I never 
thought we would see this day. 
Before I came to the Senate, I was 
the superintendent of the Denver Pub-
lic Schools. That is a large urban dis-
trict in Colorado. Most of the kids are 
kids of color and most of the kids are 
kids living in poverty, and parents are 
working two and three jobs, many of 
them. No matter what they do, they 
can’t get their kids out of poverty. No 
matter what they do, no matter how 
hard they work, they are not paid 
enough to get their kids out of poverty. 
Over the last 11 years, I have had the 
great privilege of traveling the State of 
Colorado, and it is a diverse State. Po-
litically, it is a diverse State. We have 
urban areas and rural areas, and we 
have got some of the most dynamic 
economies and business environments 
in the country, and therefore on the 
planet. And yet, if I had to summarize 
those townhalls, it is really easy. It is 
people who are coming and saying: MI-
CHAEL, we are working really hard, but 
no matter what we do we can’t afford 
housing, healthcare, higher education 
or early childhood education. We can’t 
save. We think our kids are going to 
live a more diminished life than the 
life that we would, and we are already 
living less of a good life than our par-
ents did. 
And that is the anecdotal reflection 
of an economy that, for the last 50 
years, has worked really well for the 
top 10 percent of Americans but has 
not worked for the bottom 90 percent. 
The bottom 90 percent is all of Amer-
ica, and their wages have been flat. We 
have seen income inequality grow 
through two recessions, the great re-
cession and now the COVID recession, 
and the gaps between more affluent 
families and poorer families have only 
grown as a result. 
And everywhere I went this year—I 
went to all 64 counties of Colorado dur-
ing COVID—I heard the same thing: 
Give us a little bit of hope. 
That is what the American Rescue 
Plan is going to do. It is going to give 
people just a little bit of hope, make it 
a little bit easier for people to buy gro-
ceries for their families or to pay the 
rent at the end of the month, pay their 
mortgage, set up a savings fund for 
their kids’ college education. 
That might sound like an obvious 
thing for us to want to do, but Wash-
ington, for years, has done exactly the 
opposite of what we are doing in this 
plan. Washington has passed one re-
gressive tax cut after another saying 
they were cutting taxes for the middle 
class. That was a complete smoke-
screen. Since 2000, they have cut—lis-
ten to this—$5 trillion of taxes. Almost 
all of that has gone to the wealthiest 
people in the country, when we have 
got the worst income inequality that 
we have had since 1928. It doesn’t make 
any sense. 
Can you imagine if the mayor of At-
lanta went to his citizens and said: We 
are going to borrow a bunch of money 
from the Chinese. We are going to bor-
row more money than we ever have be-
fore. And you say: Well, that kind of 
worries me. What are you going to use 
that money for? Are you building infra-
structure and roads and bridges? No. 
Are you going to invest in our schools? 
No. Our sewers? No. Mental health, 
something we need desperately across 
this country? No. Healthcare? No. 
What are you doing with the money? 
You are borrowing $5 trillion, what are 
you doing with the money? 
We are going to give it to the two 
wealthiest neighborhoods in Atlanta 
and hope that somehow it is going to 
trickle down to everybody else. That is 
how you write a bill, which is the 
Trump tax bill, where 42 percent of the 
benefit of that bill—it was a $2 trillion 
bill—42 percent went to the top 5 per-
cent of Americans, to the people who 
needed it least. 
This is exactly the opposite of that. 
Sixty percent of our bill—I am not 
going to give you a lot of numbers, but 
60 percent of our bill, the majority of 
our bill, goes to people making $50,000 
or less. And as my colleagues have 
said, we are cutting childhood poverty 
in half this year as a result of what we 
are doing, and 90 percent of American 
children are going to benefit from what 
we are doing. That is about as broad- 
based as you can get. It is progressive 
in the sense that the greatest benefit is 
going to the poorest kids because the 
credit means the most to the people 
making the least, but if you are mak-
ing up to $150,000 as a couple, you are 
going to have a benefit for your kids. 
You will get the full tax credit for your 
kids. 
So let me describe it a little bit, and 
then I will talk about the earned in-
come tax credit, and then I am going to 
take over for the Presiding Officer, and 
I look forward to hearing what he has 
to say. 
Most families under this change to 
the law are going to receive $250 a 
month per child. That is $300 a month 
for kids under the age of 6. It is fully 
refundable. What does that mean? Well, 
there was a view about this tax credit 
before that said that you had to make 
a certain amount of money before you 
could be eligible for the tax credit be-
cause there was a theory that, you 
know, if you got the tax credit, you 
wouldn’t work. 
That is not the problem. People are 
killing themselves. They are not get-
ting paid. And so we say that you get 
the tax credit from dollar zero, which 
means, finally, millions of America’s 
poorest children who have been com-
pletely 
overlooked—not 
just 
over-
looked, ignored—are going to get the 
tax credit. So millions and millions 
and millions of children who were too 
poor to benefit from what was going on 
here while we were cutting taxes for 
the richest people in America are now 
going to benefit from this tax credit, 
and it will make the biggest difference 
for them. 
We are the wealthiest country in 
human history, and yet we have one of 
the largest, if not the largest, child-
hood poverty rates in America. As my 
colleague from New Jersey, Senator 
BOOKER, 
said—I 
lost 
my 
train 
of 
thought—wait until I get it back. I am 
so excited about what we are doing, I 
can’t believe it. 
As Senator BOOKER said, the largest 
group of poor people in America are 
children. In other words, children have 
the highest percentage poverty rates in 
our country. How can that be? How can 
we accept that as a permanent state of 
things? Well, we are not. Because of 
Joe Biden’s bill, we are cutting it in 
half. And we are saying, in the richest 
country in the world, it is unacceptable 
for us to have one of the highest pov-
erty rates. Other countries have cut 
their poverty rates by half, why can’t 
we? Well, today we are. 
We also have some of the worst eco-
nomic mobility rates in the industri-
alized world as well, meaning it is hard 
to move up on the economic ladder. We 
used to say we are the land of oppor-
tunity. Unfortunately, there are a lot 
of other countries where people are 
able to get ahead by working hard. We 
want that to be our country again, and 
we want to give poor children a chance 
here. There is not a single child who 
chooses to be born poor. 
The Senator from New Jersey quoted 
James Baldwin. He is one of my favor-
ite authors, too, about how expensive 
it is to be poor. 
The other thing that we have done in 
America is we have made it incredibly 
hard to be poor, incredibly hard to be 
poor. And that is one of the interesting 
things about this bill. In countries that 
have child benefits like this child ben-
efit, they actually have a higher per-
centage of people in the workforce than 
we do. And why is that? It makes total 
sense. It makes total sense because if 
you have got a little bit of breathing 
room at the end of every month, you 
can fix a car that breaks down, and you 
can stay on your job. If you can afford 
to pay for a little bit of childcare for a 
few hours in the afternoon, maybe that 
lets you stay on the job. 
For working moms in particular, I 
think it is going to really create the 
opportunity for them to earn income 
over the long haul because it will be 
easier for them to stay in their jobs 
than not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1844 
March 25, 2021 
As I mentioned, nationwide over 90 
percent of children are going to ben-
efit. So, over many nights, late nights 
often, on this floor, I have come here 
with one complaint or another about 
how we have turned our back on Amer-
ica’s children. I have come here and I 
have said over and over again that we 
are treating America’s children like 
they are someone else’s children, not 
like they are America’s children. And 
you know what? In this bill, we treated 
America’s children like they are Amer-
ica’s children, like they really matter 
to us, like we believe in their future 
and the future of our country; that 
they are filled with promise. No matter 
how poor they are, no matter what ZIP 
Code they live in, rural or urban, they 
matter to us. They are visible to us, 
and we are going to make them a pri-
ority. 
This is the biggest reduction in child-
hood poverty in the history of our 
country, and we need to make it per-
manent. Today, 40 of us sent a letter to 
President Biden saying that we are 
going to work with him to find a way 
to make this permanent. 
My goal is to end childhood poverty 
in this country. That is where I really 
want to be because then I will know we 
really are not going to hold some 
child’s economic circumstances against 
them, but we are going to give every 
child in America the chance to run the 
footrace with each other. But 50 per-
cent is pretty good. It is the best thing 
we have seen out of Washington in gen-
erations. 
I want to just mention a few words 
also about the other bill that Senator 
BROWN led on the earned income tax 
credit, which triples that credit for 
low-income workers who don’t have 
kids. So these are workers who don’t 
have kids, who won’t benefit from what 
we are doing in the child tax credit but 
will benefit from what we are doing on 
the earned income tax credit. 
Believe it or not, until now, until we 
passed this bill, Washington, DC, was 
actually taxing people into poverty. In 
other words, people were working; they 
were earning a living; and then they 
had to pay their taxes. And then they 
were in poverty because we were tri-
pling the tax credit from about $500 to 
$1,500. That no longer will be true. 
We also bring the minimum age down 
from 25 down to 17, and we lift the cap 
for seniors so more people can benefit 
from this tax credit. In fact, 17 million 
people in this country are going to ben-
efit from this change. There are 300,000 
workers in my home State of Colorado. 
And these changes are going to trans-
form lives. They are going to give folks 
a chance to breathe. 
Just like all of you, I want an econ-
omy that when the economy grows, it 
grows for everybody. It doesn’t grow 
just for the people at the very top. 
That is the economy we have had for 
the last 50 years. Such an economy is a 
threat to democracy. You cannot have 
a democracy if you don’t have an econ-
omy where everybody feels like they 
get ahead. It won’t work. It has never 
worked in human history, and I think 
it would be unreasonable for us to ex-
pect it would work here. 
It has created a lot of uncertainty 
and, in many places, a lot of anger 
about whether the American Dream 
still exists for most Americans. I be-
lieve we will be able to dream again 
here, and we are going to need, as I 
said, an economy that works for every-
body. That means investing in our in-
frastructure. That means having an ap-
proach, you know, to the competition 
from the Chinese Government that 
doesn’t just leave us and our industries 
as collateral damage but creates thriv-
ing supply chains here, high-paying 
jobs here, and making sure that we 
own auto manufacturing here and 
other kind of manufacturing. 
It means having an education system 
that can prepare people to do the jobs 
of the 21st century. That is work we 
still have to do. It means making sure 
that every single high school kid or 
every single kid that graduates from 
high school graduates knowing they 
can earn not just a minimum wage but 
a living wage the day they walk out of 
their high school. That is what we need 
to do. 
But, in the meantime, this tax cut 
for working people and for low-income 
people means that people are going to 
be able to put food on the table, save a 
little bit of money, get through this 
pandemic, make their lives a little bit 
better, and give their kids a little bit 
more hope. 
I am really grateful. I am really 
grateful that we elected a President 
and a Vice President who is not treat-
ing America’s children like they are 
someone else’s children but treating 
them like they are our children. That 
is not only the right thing to do for 
them. That is the essential thing to do 
if this democracy is going to survive. 
I want to thank the Presiding Officer 
for all his efforts on this bill as well 
since you joined the Senate. I am going 
to stop there, and I will come replace 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BEN-
NET). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues—Senator 
BROWN; Senator BOOKER; the Presiding 
Officer, Senator BENNET—in shining a 
bright spotlight on the tragedy of child 
poverty and what the Senate needs to 
do and can do to eliminate poverty per-
manently—child poverty across our 
country. 
Someone has said that children are 
the casualties of every age, and while 
this is a longstanding problem, the 
fight could not be more urgent as 
countless families work to pull them-
selves out of the economic misery 
caused by a once-in-a-century pan-
demic. This pain is felt all across our 
country. 
But as we talk about the issue of 
child poverty, this is not theoretical. 
For me, it is personal. I grew up in pub-
lic housing. I am one of 12 children in 
my family. I am No. 11 and the first 
college graduate. I stand here today as 
a U.S. Senator, but I am the product of 
good Federal public policy and good 
public schools. I know that what we do 
in this Chamber makes a difference in 
the lives of families and in the lives of 
all of our children. My life’s journey is 
a testament to the promise of our 
country, 
the 
greatest 
country 
on 
Earth, when we make the necessary in-
vestments in our youth and enable 
them to thrive. 
As a pastor, I speak to young people 
all the time, and I often go back to my 
hometown of Savannah, GA, and com-
munities all across Georgia like the 
neighborhood I grew up in. In my ef-
forts to inspire children who are strug-
gling, I tell them that your parent’s in-
come does not have to determine your 
outcome. It is not where you start; it is 
where you end up. 
Now, that is what I say to them, and 
I believe it, because they need to be in-
spired to give it all that they have got. 
But the truth is, when I tell them that 
their parent’s income does not deter-
mine their outcome, that is not based 
simply on what they do, but on what 
we do. That has to be made real 
through good public policy. 
That is why I am so proud to work 
with my Senate colleagues and I was so 
happy to join this U.S. Senate at such 
a critical time in our country, and in a 
moment, when we, buoyed by the peo-
ple of Georgia who made a historic 
choice, our majority enabled us to pass 
the American Rescue Plan. 
Over the past year, we have seen how 
the consequences of COVID–19 and the 
economic downturn that followed it 
have both illuminated and exacerbated 
so many of the longstanding disparities 
that have challenged Georgians, Amer-
icans, and people everywhere. We know 
that low-income families and children, 
especially, have not only not been 
spared but have, in many ways, suf-
fered more than most. Children are cas-
ualties at every age. 
According to data from the Center 
for American Progress, we know that 
nearly one in five children in Georgia 
was living in poverty last year. Think 
about that: nearly one in five children 
in poverty in the middle of a pandemic. 
It is tough enough to live in poverty, 
but it is even tougher to live in poverty 
in the middle of a pandemic. What 
could be tougher than being a child in 
poverty in a pandemic? 
Another 217,000 of those children live 
in what we could call extreme poverty 
in the United States—stock markets 
soaring and children struggling and no 
relationship between what is happening 
on Wall Street and what is happening 
on their streets. It is our job to make 
it true when I say to them that their 
parent’s income need not determine 
their outcome. 
I don’t know about anyone else, but I 
think that these high rates of child 
poverty are unacceptable in the great-
est, richest country on the planet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1845 
March 25, 2021 
Often, we tell our children to stay on 
the right road, to stay out of trouble, 
and we should—stay focused—but we 
ought to spread that net of responsi-
bility. 
The truth is, poverty is its own vio-
lence. Poverty is a violence that 
traumatizes the mind, oppresses the 
body, and bruises the human spirit, so 
that is why the American Rescue Plan 
is so necessary, so important, and so 
historic. I am glad that Senators BOOK-
ER, BROWN, and BENNET—I feel a little 
left out, the odd guy out here—I am 
glad that we were able to push through, 
in the American Rescue Plan, a land-
mark expansion of two tax credit pro-
grams: the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit. 
Now, I am calling on all my Senate 
colleagues to join us in making these 
expansions permanent. By increasing 
the child tax credit, thousands of more 
dollars a year will flow into the pock-
ets of the children and families who 
need it most, cutting poverty—child 
poverty—nationwide in half. 
In Georgia, more than 1 million fami-
lies with children will benefit from the 
increased tax refund, and it will lift 
more than 171,000 Georgia children out 
of poverty. Those are my neighbors and 
yours. Those are kids around my 
church and who attend my church. 
So I want to be clear. Not only were 
we able to expand the tax refund so 
that more families are getting more 
money, but we were able to do so in 
such a way that it gives families a 
monthly 
cash 
payment 
providing 
greater financial security. 
This is going to be a gamechanger for 
so many families, especially those who 
did not previously qualify for the cred-
it when it was used just to offset taxes 
already owed to the government. Prior 
to this expansion, we had folk who 
were too poor to get our help. There is 
something wrong about that—too poor 
to get our help. This expansion cor-
rects that. Now, we are putting dollars 
directly into the hands of the families 
who need it the most. 
In the COVID package, we were able 
to strengthen the earned income tax 
credit, nearly tripling the maximum 
tax refund allowed for qualifying work-
ers because we have to make sure that 
childless families in our communities 
also have the support they need to pay 
their rent, keep food on the table, and 
more to keep our communities strong. 
Taken together, expanding and ex-
tending these programs are a major 
move toward eliminating child poverty 
and poverty in general once and for all 
in Georgia and all across our country, 
but it is still not enough to truly tack-
le the issue. We have included this in 
the American Rescue Plan; now, we 
must make it permanent. As so often is 
the case, the right thing to do is also 
the smart thing to do. This will not 
only help these families, it will help 
the American economy. 
I am just old enough to remember 
when they started talking about trick-
le-down economics. I know some com-
munities where they have been waiting 
for decades for that trickle. It hadn’t 
trickled down; it is trickling up. 
The right thing to do is often the 
smart thing to do. When we help these 
families, it is actually good economic 
policy. Because when you help poor 
families with children, they buy things 
like food, baby diapers, a coat for their 
kid, and it helps the American econ-
omy. 
The right thing to do is the smart 
thing to do. If Congress can slash child 
poverty for 1 year, why wouldn’t we or 
shouldn’t we do it once and for all? And 
so I urge the Senate to stand up and do 
this work in this moral moment in 
America. 
In just a few days, I will go home. I 
will stand up, and I will preach on 
Easter Sunday morning. This year, as 
it turns out, Easter is on April 4. It is 
the anniversary of Dr. King’s death. So 
I will be thinking about Dr. King as I 
preach this coming Easter because Dr. 
King spent his last birthday, January 
15, 1968, in his office, at our church, 
among other things, planning the Poor 
People’s Campaign, trying to organize 
us and get us ready to stand up against 
poverty. He spent his birthday think-
ing about other people’s children be-
cause he understood that his children 
would not be OK until other people’s 
children were OK. 
April 4 is his birthday. April 4 is also 
Easter this year. Let’s make these tax 
credits permanent and resurrect hope 
and possibility and promise for all of 
America’s children. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF 
GREECE AND CELEBRATING DE-
MOCRACY IN GREECE AND THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 17, S. Res. 34. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 34) recognizing the 
200th anniversary of the independence of 
Greece and celebrating democracy in Greece 
and the United States. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor in honor of an his-
toric occasion: the 200th anniversary of 
Greece’s independence. I am delighted 
to join the Greek-American commu-
nity in New Jersey and across the 
United States in celebrating this bicen-
tennial. The bonds of friendship be-
tween the United States and Greece are 
unbreakable, and as I stand here, in the 
center of American democracy, I am 
reminded of the strength of the shared 
democratic values on which our long 
partnership is based. 
Greece has made incredible contribu-
tions to the world, not least of which is 
developing the ideals of democracy and 
rule of law that inspired our Founding 
Fathers to establish our American sys-
tem of government. The very architec-
ture of the Capitol building is a tribute 
to the foundational role Greece played 
in the shaping of our democracy and 
society. The democratic ideals devel-
oped in ancient Greece continue to mo-
tivate Americans and people around 
the world today. 
The people of the United States in 
turn worked to support the people of 
Greece as they began their own strug-
gle for independence 200 years ago. 
American 
Philhellene 
Committees, 
comprised 
of 
ordinary 
Americans, 
sprung up to support the Greek fight 
for freedom through fundraising and 
humanitarian assistance. 
Members of Congress, including Dan-
iel Webster applauded ‘‘the struggle of 
an interesting and gallant people . . . 
contending against fearful odds . . . for 
the common privilege of human na-
ture.’’ In a letter to Greek scholar 
Adamantios 
Koraes, 
whose 
work 
formed the intellectual basis for the 
Greek independence struggle, Thomas 
Jefferson demonstrated his support by 
writing that ‘‘no people sympathise 
more feelingly than ours with the 
sufferings of your countrymen, none 
offer more sincere and ardent prayers 
to heaven for their success.’’ 
Several American Philhellenes trav-
eled to Greece to assist the Greek peo-
ple more directly. Dr. Samuel Gridley 
Howe, who later became a prominent 
voice in America’s fight to end slavery, 
served with the Greek army as a sur-
geon and a soldier. Jonathan Peckham 
Miller, another future noted aboli-
tionist, also served in the Greek army. 
George Jarvis fought alongside the 
Greek people, as well as working to 
provide food, medicine, and clothing to 
those who needed it with the support of 
the American Philhellene Committees. 
The bonds between the peoples and 
governments of Greece and the United 
States have lasted throughout our 
countries’ long history and are strong-
er than ever today. Greece is an invalu-
able partner to the United States as a 
NATO member, as an EU member, and 
in promoting peace and stability in the 
Balkans and the Eastern Mediterra-
nean region. Greece’s unwavering com-
mitment to democracy and the rule of 
law makes it a truly reliable ally in 
the region and an increasingly critical 
one as we face the challenges of the 
21st century. 
I am proud that Congress dem-
onstrated its support for further boost-
ing U.S.-Greece cooperation and U.S. 
support for the Greece-Cyprus-Israel 
trilateral, with the passage of the East-
ern Mediterranean Security and En-
ergy Partnership Act a little over a 
year ago. Ensuring full implementa-
tion of this act is one of my priorities 
as chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
The past few years have seen critical 
developments in U.S.-Greece relations. 
I am grateful to the leadership of offi-
cials in both countries whose work has 
helped U.S.-Greece ties reach their 
strongest level ever, including Ambas-
sador Geoff Pyatt, and I look forward 
to building on their fantastic efforts in 
the months and years to come. 
This 200th anniversary of Greece’s 
independence truly is a time to cele-
brate: a time to celebrate Greece’s 
hard-won freedom; a time to celebrate 
the bonds between our peoples, and es-
pecially the many contributions Greek 
Americans have made to this country; 
and a time to celebrate our countries’ 
shared history and democratic values, 
which will be the basis of our coun-
tries’ cooperation for years to come. 
This week, the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions 
Committee 
unanimously 
ap-
proved a resolution congratulating the 
people of Greece on the 200th anniver-
sary of their independence. I am grate-
ful to Senator BARRASSO for joining me 
in leading this resolution and to my 
many Senate colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who have cosponsored this 
resolution. With the passage of this 
resolution every year, Congress—and, 
through us, the American people—send 
a clear message of support for the 
Greek people and our countries’ endur-
ing partnership. 
Greece’s 200th independence anniver-
sary serves not only as a reminder of 
our countries’ long friendship, but also 
as a time for us to look to build on 
that history and strengthen our part-
nership for generations to come. The 
Eastern Mediterranean region and the 
world face unprecedented challenges, 
and growing the U.S.-Greece relation-
ship is more critical than ever for our 
shared security and stability. I look 
forward to working with the people of 
Greece and the Greek-American com-
munity to make the vision of an even 
stronger U.S.-Greece relationship a re-
ality. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 34) was agreed 
to. 
The preamble was agreed to.
