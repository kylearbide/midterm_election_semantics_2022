Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2020

The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Friday, September 11, 2020, at 1 p.m.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, who sits on a lofty throne, we 
acknowledge Your sovereignty over our 
Nation and world. Keep us from becom-
ing so desensitized to falsehoods that 
we abort Your plan for our lives. 
Lord, we are unworthy to approach 
Your throne, for we are merely sinners 
saved by Your loving grace. Remove 
our guilt and forgive our sins. May we 
respond to Your forgiveness by obeying 
Your command for us to pray for our 
Nation. 
Lord, use our Senators today as mes-
sengers of truth, unity, and peace. In-
spire them to stand for right regardless 
of the consequences. 
We pray in Your holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Today, the Senate 
will vote on moving forward with relief 
for Americans. That relief is necessary 
because of COVID–19. 
The bill contains new funds for test-
ing and contact tracing, aid for schools 
and colleges to keep our kids safe, and 
it also includes childcare assistance. It 
has more money for developing the 
coronavirus vaccine and treatments, 
funding for the Postal Service, and 
help for farmers. It allows for small 
businesses to access more Paycheck 
Protection Program funds with more 
flexibility and provides for enhanced 
unemployment benefits. 
Now, surely these are items we can 
all agree on and ought to agree on 
right now. We know how to work to-
gether to produce results for Ameri-
cans. We saw that in March when we 
successfully passed the CARES Act. 
That is a good model to follow now. 
Back in March, Republicans in the 
Senate proposed a framework, then 
worked across party lines through the 
relevant committees to produce a con-
sensus product that received over-
whelming support in the Senate. I was 
glad to lead the bipartisan negotiations 
on the part of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee for that CARES package and 
have been standing ready to repeat the 
process if Democratic leaders would 
just agree to agree. Why can’t we re-
peat the same process now? 
Democrats seem to think that they 
can hold out until Republicans either 
agree to their partisan wishes or Re-
publicans take the blame for the lack 
of relief. If the Democrats are right, it 
would be a partisan win for their party, 
but at the same time, it would be a tre-
mendous loss for the American people. 
Let’s agree to move forward like we 
did last March. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Nineteen years 
ago tomorrow, thousands of our fellow 
Americans were murdered by terror-
ists. National landmarks were burning. 
Brave first responders in New York 
City, 
Arlington, 
and 
Pennsylvania 
rushed into mortal danger, putting 
their lives on the line to save strang-
ers. 
As the dust settled and 3,000 Amer-
ican families grieved their loved ones 
far before their time, we quickly saw 
there was no going back. The old world 
we had woken up to that Tuesday 
morning was gone. 
We had not gone overseas in search of 
these monsters. These monsters came 
to us. These enemies would not leave 
our Nation alone if we declined to con-
front them, so as we reflect on this an-
niversary tomorrow, we will remember 
the thousands of innocent Americans 
who died that day and the brave serv-
icemen and women who went on to pay 
the ultimate sacrifice to do justice and 
to prevent more attacks. 
My fellow Kentuckians and I cannot 
be prouder of the heroes stationed on

September 10, 2020 
our soil who have deployed throughout 
the War on Terror. The special opera-
tors of the 160th, the Night Stalkers, 
based at Fort Campbell, KY, handled 
the very first airborne insertion of 
Army troops in mid-October—a dan-
gerous fight over the Hindu Kush 
mountains. The soldiers they carried 
were from the famed 5th Special Forces 
Group, also based at Fort Campbell, 
who formed the tip of the spear to un-
leash the might of America on the ter-
rorists and their Taliban hosts. The fa-
mous 101st Airborne, also at Fort 
Campbell, became the first conven-
tional unit on the ground just days 
later. 
Fast-forward a decade, and the Night 
Stalkers were helicoptering over Af-
ghanistan yet again. They inserted and 
extracted SEAL Team Six the night we 
took Osama bin Laden off the battle-
field. 
Thousands more servicemembers de-
ployed from Kentucky’s Fort Knox and 
Fort Campbell during the War on Ter-
ror, and more than 18,000 soldiers and 
airmen from the Kentucky National 
Guard had been mobilized to defend our 
Nation. 
Fighting by our side for nearly 20 
years now have been our friends and 
NATO allies. America’s friends invoked 
article 5 right away and have fought 
alongside us to defeat this global 
threat. 
That dark day occasioned brave con-
tributions from so many—from the 
firefighters who sprinted through the 
smoke to the citizens who donated 
blood and flew our flag, to the young 
men and women who are stationed 
thousands of miles from home right 
now to help our Nation project power 
and protect our homeland. 
We did what Americans do. We 
stayed strong. We stuck together. We 
rolled up our sleeves, and we rebuilt. 
Some rebuilt their lives. Others rebuilt 
buildings. Some put on the uniform 
and rebuilt peace and security with 
their own hands. 
May we never fail to honor them, and 
may we never tire of the toughness, 
vigilance, 
and 
persistence 
it 
has 
taken—and will continue to take—to 
make our pledge, ‘‘Never Again,’’ a re-
ality. 
f 
S. 178 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, Con-
gress has spent months talking—talk-
ing—about whether to give the Amer-
ican people more relief as they con-
tinue grappling with this pandemic. 
Today we are going to vote. 
Today we are going to vote. Every 
Senator will be counted. Should we 
move forward with the floor process to 
deliver hundreds of billions of dollars 
more for kids, jobs, and healthcare? 
Should we at least vote to move for-
ward and have this debate out in the 
open? Or do our Democratic colleagues 
prefer to hide behind closed doors and 
refuse to help families before the elec-
tion? 
Well, we will find out in a couple of 
hours. 
Republicans have tried repeatedly to 
build on the CARES Act and get more 
help out the door to American families. 
Democrats have blocked us at every 
turn. They have invented different ex-
cuses each time. 
A few months ago, Speaker PELOSI 
wrote a massive multitrillion-dollar 
liberal wish list that even her own 
House Democratic Members said would 
never become law. 
‘‘The HEROES Act went too far.’’ A 
‘‘political wish list.’’ These are quotes 
from House Democrats. 
But in July, when the Senate Repub-
licans put forward a serious offer, 
Speaker PELOSI
and the Democratic 
leader said they would not even talk— 
not even talk—unless we started with 
that unserious bill. No help for families 
unless they got to pass the absurd bill 
their own Democratic Members have 
ridiculed. 
So, in August, Republicans tried 
something else. We proposed breaking 
off some of the most urgent, most bi-
partisan policies and agreeing wherever 
we could: unemployment insurance, 
the Paycheck Protection Program. But 
Speaker PELOSI
and the Democratic 
leader blocked that too. They said they 
didn’t want to do anything ‘‘piece-
meal.’’ ‘‘Piecemeal,’’ they said. 
Then, just a few weeks later, Speaker 
PELOSI completely contradicted herself 
and rushed back to Washington to pass 
a total piecemeal bill that only helped 
the Postal Service and did nothing for 
working families—contradiction after 
contradiction, 
excuse 
after 
excuse, 
while working families have suffered 
and waited and wondered whether 
Washington 
Democrats 
really 
care 
more about hurting President Trump 
than helping them through this crisis. 
My Democratic colleagues should 
stand up and tell the American people 
which elements of our multihundred- 
billion-dollar proposal they actually 
oppose. 
Let me say that again. They should 
stand up and tell the American people 
which parts of the proposal we will 
vote on later today that they are actu-
ally against. 
Today, we are going to vote to extend 
the Federal unemployment insurance. 
Will Democrats vote against that? 
Thanks 
to 
Senator 
COLLINS
and 
Chairman RUBIO, we are going to vote 
on a whole second round of the PPP for 
hard-hit businesses. Are the Democrats 
against that? 
Thanks to colleagues such as Sen-
ators ERNST, DAINES, GARDNER, and 
SULLIVAN, we will be voting on help for 
small businesses like farms and fish-
eries. Thanks to Senator CORNYN, we 
will be voting on commonsense legal 
protections that universities and non-
profits have been asking for. Who are 
the 
Democrats 
excited 
to 
vote 
against—the farmers or the university 
presidents? 
Thanks to Chairman ALEXANDER and 
Senator BLUNT, we are going to vote on 
an incredibly robust package for edu-
cation and healthcare to get kids back 
in school safely and then defeat this 
virus through science. We will be vot-
ing on $105 billion for education, more 
than House Democrats put on their 
bill; billions on testing and tracing; 
and even more support for vaccines. 
Thanks to a number of our col-
leagues, including Senators ERNST and 
LOEFFLER, there is new support for 
childcare, plus other arrangements like 
homeschooling, 
thanks 
to 
Senator 
CRUZ. 
Are Democrats going to vote against 
childcare and education during a pan-
demic because they are afraid the Re-
publicans might get some credit? Real-
ly? They are going to vote against find-
ing and distributing vaccines because 
they are afraid the breakthrough that 
our Nation is praying for might pos-
sibly help President Trump? 
These are the policies that every one 
of us will be voting on in a couple of 
hours—these and many more. 
Speaker PELOSI and the Democratic 
leader can keep up their frantic polit-
ical spin. They can keep trying to 
make this an abstract argument over 
leverage or an infinite set of things 
that aren’t in the bill or whether the 
White House Chief of Staff has been po-
lite to them or whatever new excuse 
they will settle on today. But none of 
that is what we are going to vote on. 
We are going to vote on policy. 
Today, every Senator will either say 
they want to send families the relief we 
can agree to or they can send families 
nothing—nothing. 
Reporters asked the Democratic lead-
er yesterday if his stonewalling was 
making the perfect the enemy of the 
good. He replied—listen to this—‘‘Re-
publicans are the enemy of the good.’’ 
‘‘Republicans are the enemy.’’ That is 
what he said. 
We have all heard the saying that a 
gaffe is when a politician accidentally 
says what he really thinks. That is a 
Washington gaffe, when a politician ac-
tually says what he really thinks. Well, 
the Democratic leader just told us how 
poisonous his thinking has become. 
The Americans we represent, how-
ever they vote, know that Republicans 
aren’t our enemies and Democrats 
aren’t our enemies. The coronavirus is 
the enemy. The coronavirus is the 
enemy. 
My home State just passed a sad 
milestone yesterday. More than 1,000 
Kentuckians have lost their lives to 
COVID–19. These families I represent 
are not burying their loved ones be-
cause Republicans or Democrats are 
the enemy. They are burying their 
loved ones because of this virus. That 
is what we are fighting. That is what 
families are dealing with. We are not 
each other’s enemies. We are all in this 
together, just like we were back in 
March and April. 
So, today, every Senator is going to 
vote. Every Senator is going to vote. 
Senators who share the Democratic 
leader’s toxic attitude, who think the

real enemies are their political oppo-
nents, I assume, will follow his lead 
and vote no. They can tell American 
families they care more about politics 
than helping them. 
But Senators who want to move for-
ward will vote yes. They will vote to 
advance this process so we can shape it 
into a bipartisan product and make a 
law for the American people. That is 
what working families need. They need 
us to act. They need us to legislate. 
Today, they will see exactly who has 
their backs.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Hala Y. Jarbou, 
of Michigan, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the Western District of 
Michigan. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, once 
again this week, Republicans are bring-
ing forward a proposal to provide addi-
tional coronavirus relief to help pro-
tect jobs, to get kids and teachers back 
in the classroom safely, and to provide 
funding for the treatments and vac-
cines we need to defeat this virus, and 
once again, Democrats are objecting. It 
is the same old song: Republicans’ bill 
doesn’t spend enough. Well, let’s talk 
about that for a minute. 
First of all, Republicans are not 
claiming that the bill we put on the 
floor this week contains the last dol-
lars we will need to spend in response 
to the coronavirus. We may need to 
spend more. This bill is simply an at-
tempt to direct relief funds to some of 
the biggest priorities right now, like 
helping the hardest hit small busi-
nesses weather this crisis and pro-
viding more resources for testing, 
treatment, and vaccines. These are 
areas we should all agree on. 
Second 
of 
all, 
Democrats’ 
coronavirus proposal—the $3 trillion 
bill they proposed—is both unrealistic 
and irresponsible. 
Our Nation is deeply, deeply in debt 
right now. Next year, our country will 
owe more than we produce for the first 
time since the end of World War II. 
That is a very bad place to be. That is 
getting toward the kind of debt-to-GDP 
ratio that helped bring about financial 
disaster in Greece. While the United 
States is not Greece, if we grow our 
debt enough, what happened to the 
Greek economy could happen here. 
Being the United States of America 
does not exempt us from financial re-
alities. In times of crisis, sometimes 
you have to borrow money, and that is 
what we had to do earlier this year 
with 
the 
CARES 
Act 
and 
other 
coronavirus relief legislation. But we 
have an absolute responsibility to 
every American, to every hard-working 
individual in this country to ensure 
that we are only borrowing what is ab-
solutely necessary. 
Democrats’ proposal doesn’t even 
come close to meeting the definition of 
‘‘necessary spending.’’ To give just one 
example, Democrats have proposed ap-
propriating a staggering $1 trillion for 
States even though the States still— 
still—haven’t spent the money we pro-
vided for them in the original CARES 
Act. Now, it is certainly possible that 
at some point, we will have to provide 
some kind of additional assistance to 
States, but to create a trillion-dollar 
slush fund for States before they have 
even spent the money they have al-
ready been given would be an incred-
ibly irresponsible use of taxpayer dol-
lars. At least some of that money could 
be used for coronavirus relief. 
Other money in the Democrats’ bill 
would go to measures that have noth-
ing—absolutely nothing—to do with 
the virus, things like diversity studies 
in the cannabis industry, a soil health 
study, federalizing elections, and tax 
cuts for millionaires in States like New 
York and California. 
One of the biggest priorities in the 
wake of the coronavirus is helping 
Americans keep their jobs or to find 
new ones. It should be front and center 
in any relief bill. Yet Democrats’ mas-
sive bill—over $3 trillion in the Demo-
crats’ bill—manages to mention the 
word ‘‘cannabis’’ more often than the 
word ‘‘job.’’ Diversity studies for mari-
juana are more important, evidently, 
than jobs—at least if you look at the 
Democrats’ bill. That should tell you 
all you need to know about the serious-
ness of the Democrats’ proposal. I 
would love for the Democratic leader 
to come down to the floor and explain 
how a bill that mentions the word 
‘‘cannabis’’ more often than the word 
‘‘job’’ is a serious coronavirus bill. 
Of course, despite the unseriousness 
of the Democrats’ proposal, Repub-
licans have been willing to compromise 
on a coronavirus bill from the very be-
ginning. We understand how negotia-
tion works, and we knew that we would 
have to give some ground and that 
Democrats would have to give some 
ground. We were and are willing to do 
just that. But from the beginning, 
Democrats have rejected serious nego-
tiation. Sure, they sat in meetings, and 
they talked about a bill, but at the end 
of the day, Democrats refused to com-
promise. It was their bill or no bill, 
which means that so far, they have 
chosen no bill. 
The only way to get a bill through 
the Senate and to the President’s desk 
is to develop a compromise bill. Even if 
the majority leader puts Democrats’ 
exact bill on the floor today, there is 
no way—no way—it would make it 
through the Senate, much less be 
signed into law by the President. So if 
the Democrats really want a bill, they 
are going to have to compromise, and 
that is something they have continued 
to refuse to do, which leads to the log-
ical conclusion that Democrats don’t 
want a bill at all. 
If Democrats really wanted to get re-
lief to Americans, they would work 
with Republicans to pass a compromise 
bill even if it didn’t contain all the 
money Democrats want, because even 
if it were true that the Republican leg-
islation is inadequate, some money is 
better than no money. If you can’t get 
someone in need all the money you 
think they should have, you should get 
them what money you can. 
If Democrats really thought it was of 
overwhelming importance that we de-
liver relief to Americans right now, 
they would be working with Repub-
licans to get as much relief as they 
could through Congress. But, for Demo-
crats, delivering relief to Americans is 
not really of overwhelming impor-
tance. What is of overwhelming impor-
tance 
to 
Democrats 
is 
keeping 
coronavirus alive as a political issue, 
and if that means no bill, well then 
Democrats are OK with that. They 
would rather have no bill, zero funding, 
and a political weapon than to have a 
bill and allow Republicans to say that 
we helped Americans. So all indica-
tions are that when we have a vote 
later today, they plan to filibuster this 
bill. 
This is not the first time we have 
seen this. Think back to the end of 
June. In the wake of George Floyd’s 
death at the knee of a police officer, 
Americans of all parties came together 
to push for police reform. Republicans 
put a police reform bill on the floor of 
the Senate for debate and amend-
ment—a substantial bill that included 
75 to 80 percent of what both Demo-
crats and Republicans said they want-
ed, the product of years of research and 
work by Senator TIM SCOTT, who has 
personal experience on this issue. 
And Democrats? Well, Democrats 
filibustered. That is right. In the face 
of a nationwide call for police reform 
legislation, Democrats refused to even 
move forward to debate the legislation. 
Why? Because agreeing to work with 
Republicans on legislation would have 
taken away much of Democrats’ ability 
to exploit police reform as a political 
issue. So Democrats filibustered even 
though, remarkably, they were offered 
by Senator SCOTT and other supporters

of the bill numerous amendments—10 
amendments, 20 amendments—votes, 
opportunities to improve the bill—at 
least improve the bill in their eyes into 
a form that they could pass it. 
It is hard not to wonder if some of 
the violence that we have seen in our 
cities across the country in recent 
months could have been avoided if 
Democrats had not decided to attempt 
to exploit this issue for political gain. 
There is not a lot Republicans can do 
if 
Democrats 
intend 
to 
keep 
prioritizing perceived political advan-
tage over doing their jobs as legisla-
tors, but we are going to take this vote 
on the coronavirus relief bill this week, 
today, and we are going to keep offer-
ing opportunities for Democrats to 
work with Republicans to help the 
American people. 
Maybe some of the Democratic rank 
and file will decide that they have had 
enough of their leaders playing politics 
and will work with us to resolve and to 
get some things done for the American 
people. 
Republicans are ready to negotiate. 
We just need Democrats to come to the 
table. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today the Senate will take a rather 
pointless vote on the latest highly par-
tisan, Republican, emaciated COVID 
relief bill. 
Now, the Republican leader keeps 
claiming that his bill is an attempt at 
a bipartisan solution, but of course the 
bill was drafted solely by Repub-
licans—no input from Democrats—and 
rushed to the floor. 
Mr. Leader, go look up in the dic-
tionary what bipartisanship is. It is 
both parties working together, not 
your party doing a bill and then saying 
it is bipartisan. 
What the Republican leader has done 
is no one’s idea of bipartisanship, not 
even his own Members’. 
Let’s go over history. He has done 
this trick before: COVID 2, COVID 3, 
COVID 3.5. In each case, Republicans 
came out—the leader came out saying 
he did his own bill, saying: This is the 
only bill that will pass. Democrats are 
blocking it. 
Democrats held strong, and what 
happened? We got much better bills 
with many of the things we wanted. We 
got truly bipartisan bills once the lead-
er determined that he had to negotiate 
with Democrats to pass something. 
That will happen again. There is a de-
cent chance that will happen again. 
But this bill is not going to happen be-
cause it is so emaciated, so filled with 
poison pills, so partisanly designed—it 
was designed to fail. 
Now, the Republican leader claims 
the vote this week will expose Demo-
cratic obstruction and delay—another 
one of these ‘‘Alice in Wonderland″- 
type statements—but, of course, Demo-
crats weren’t the ones who said: Let’s 
put the Senate on pause. Who said 
that? Democrats didn’t say: Let’s wait 
and see. Who said that? Democrats 
didn’t delay for 4 months while the Na-
tion suffered. In fact, the House passed 
a bill with the broad support of Senate 
Democrats. 
So while the President was lying to 
the 
American 
people 
about 
the 
coronavirus, Senate Republicans were 
following suit in spirit. The Republican 
leader himself talked about the lack of 
urgency in his caucus to address the 
problem. So the idea that Democrats, 
who passed a comprehensive relief 
package through the House nearly 4 
months ago, are the cause of delay and 
obstruction is ridiculous. It has been 
the Republicans all along. The record 
shows it. 
From the beginning, from way back 
in March after the CARES Act passed, 
Democrats have insisted on continuing 
a program of assistance to the Amer-
ican people. We proposed legislation to 
give hazard pay to essential workers, 
rental assistance, housing assistance, 
nutrition assistance, legislation to ex-
tend the enhanced unemployment ben-
efits that kept nearly 12 million Ameri-
cans out of poverty, money for rural 
broadband, money to help our res-
taurants and our hotels. We have pro-
posed many different things, none of 
which are in the Republican bill. 
House Democrats passed the Heroes 
Act through their Chamber. So far, it 
is the only major COVID relief bill 
since the CARES Act to pass either 
Chamber of Congress. Meanwhile, as 
the spring turned into summer and as 
summer approached fall, Republicans 
dithered and delayed. They pushed 
their chips in with President Trump’s 
lie and hoped the virus would miracu-
lously disappear and everything would 
be all better. Rather than use the 
power of the Federal Government to 
help our citizens during a once-in-a- 
lifetime 
crisis, 
Senate 
Republicans 
closed their eyes and crossed their fin-
gers, hoping they wouldn’t have to do 
anything. Sound familiar? It is just 
what President Trump tried to do as 
well. 
Here now, in September, Republicans 
finally felt the public pressure to sup-
port a bill, but instead of working with 
Democrats on something that could 
pass, our friends on the other side tried 
to find the bare minimum that Senate 
Republicans could support. They had 20 
Republican Senators—in the words of 
the leader—who wanted to spend no 
money. The greatest economic crisis 
since the Depression, the greatest 
health crisis since the Spanish flu just 
about a century ago, and 20 Repub-
licans want to spend nothing. They are 
the tail wagging the Republican dog. 
So the Republican leader didn’t know 
what to do. He proposed a meager bill, 
a skinny bill of $1 trillion, but even 
that wasn’t good enough for the hard 
right—the large hard right—in his cau-
cus. So he put together, with spit and 
polish, an emaciated bill that hardly 
does a thing—that leaves out so many 
Americans, it doesn’t come close to 
meeting the moment—so he might say 
he might be able to bring something on 
the floor with a modicum of support in 
his caucus. 
It is insufficient. It is completely in-
adequate. It does not help renters keep 
a roof over their heads or American 
families put food on the table. It short-
changes healthcare and education. It 
does not provide a dime to protect es-
sential State and local services. It is 
laden with poison pills, provisions our 
colleagues 
know 
Democrats 
would 
never support, to guarantee the bill’s 
failure. 
The truth is, the Republicans and the 
Republican leader don’t want to pass a 
bill. Too many on the hard right—in 
the Senate and outside it—would be 
angry if they actually put together a 
bill that could pass. 
So Leader MCCONNELL, this morning, 
demanded that Democrats name ex-
actly what we oppose in their bill, like 
it was some kind of challenge. How 
about the broad immunity provisions? 
From the day he announced them, he 
knew that it wouldn’t get Democratic 
support. How about the Betsy DeVos 
school choice plan that would funnel 
money into private schools while he 
neglected the real needs of our public 
schools? Of course Democrats would 
oppose that. He knew that. He knows 
that. 
The truth is, this emaciated bill is 
not a serious attempt at legislation or 
solving the real problems in our coun-
try. It is a shame. It is one of the most 
cynical moves I have seen, a fairly 
transparent attempt to show that the 
Republicans 
are 
doing 
something, 
when, in fact, they want to do nothing, 
in reality. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic, 
historic 
unemployment, 
industries 
struggling from one end of America to 
the other, and Leader MCCONNELL isn’t 
searching for bipartisan progress; he 
seems to be looking for political cover. 
Once this bill goes down, we will be 
right where we started at the start of 
the week: waiting for our Republican 
colleagues to wake up to the size of the 
crisis in our country and work with us 
on a bill that actually makes sense. 
We want to work on a bipartisan bill. 
The Speaker and I have come down $1 
trillion off our initial request, which 
was based on the real needs of the 
American people during this pandemic 
crisis. Our Republican colleagues—both 
the President’s minions and the Repub-
lican Senate—have refused to budge. 
I still have some hope, once this bill 
is defeated. If past is prologue, there is 
actually a significant chance that the 
public heat on many Republican Sen-
ators, as they go back home, will have 
them come to their senses and they 
will start negotiating with us in a seri-
ous way. That happened on COVID 2. It

COVID 3.5. I pray and plead, for the 
sake of our country and the people who 
are suffering, that it will happen again 
and that Republicans, once they see 
they can’t pass this emaciated, terribly 
insufficient, 
and 
poison-pill-pocked 
proposal, will start negotiating in re-
ality with us—something they have not 
done as of yet. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, now on President 
Trump, yesterday it was reported that, 
in taped interviews with Bob Wood-
ward, President Trump acknowledged 
that he knew the danger posed by 
COVID–19 way back in February but he 
deliberately—deliberately—downplayed 
the threat to the American people. We 
now know that the President wasn’t 
ill-informed. He wasn’t being overly 
optimistic. He was lying to the Amer-
ican 
people. 
He 
was 
deliberately 
downplaying the virus to the American 
people at a time when early and force-
ful action could have saved so many 
lives. 
Look, when the house is on fire—a 
five-alarm fire—you have an obligation 
to let people know. If you don’t, they 
are going to burn, and they are going 
to die. 
When we look at the rest of the world 
and see why they are doing better than 
we are in fighting this disease, the rea-
son is simple: They had some leader-
ship. We have had none from the White 
House—none. We have had lying. We 
have had ignoring the problem. We 
have had misleading the American peo-
ple but no leadership at a time when 
we desperately need it. 
Other leaders around the world were 
clear about science. They faced up to 
the problem and worked hard to solve 
it. They instituted policies to test, 
trace, and isolate. We had a President 
who simply lied about the dangers of 
the disease and suggested that Ameri-
cans inject bleach. Other leaders took 
responsibility and ownership. We had a 
President who said: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
In the annals of history, this will be 
one of the five greatest examples of 
lack of leadership in American history. 
President Trump, the history books 
are not going to regard you kindly. 
They are not going to regard you kind-
ly. 
The President is coming up with 
great excuses now for his perfidious 
lies. This time, he said he didn’t want 
to tell the truth about COVID because 
it might cause panic. Really? Is this 
the same President who is busy pan-
icking America right now, telling 
women in the suburbs that their safety 
is at risk when the suburbs are not at 
risk at all? Is this the same President 
who invented a caravan of migrants in 
an attempt to panic Americans before 
the last election? This President al-
ways uses panic as a tool when he 
thinks it serves his interest, so the 
idea that he did it because he didn’t 
want to panic Americans does not ring 
true. It seems like an ex post facto ex-
cuse for the President’s perfidious lies. 
President Trump doesn’t mind pan-
icking people when it serves his inter-
est. What is worse is that he will not 
tell the truth when it hurts his inter-
est, even if lives are at stake. 
The President’s comments in this 
interview were despicable. It should 
serve as a warning to all Americans 
about who this man is and his total, 
complete abject failure to lead. 
(Mr. SCOTT of Florida assumed the 
Chair.) 
TRANSIT 
Mr. President, finally, on transit, 
COVID–19 has changed nearly every as-
pect of American life, but Senate Re-
publicans and the White House only 
want to address the barest sliver of the 
problems in our country, so this week 
I have been pointing out many of the 
things that the Republican proposal 
leaves out. 
Yesterday, I spoke about the plight 
of live venues and the need to save that 
essential part of our culture and our 
economy. Today I want to address an-
other topic that has received far too 
little attention from the Senate Repub-
licans: transit. 
Public transportation systems are 
the lifeblood of great American cities. 
Regional networks connect workers to 
jobs and consumers and businesses. As 
anyone can imagine, during the pan-
demic, while transit authorities like 
the MTA have continued round-the- 
clock operations to serve the people, 
ridership on public transportation has 
plummeted, leaving them in a state of 
crisis. God forbid if public transpor-
tation were forced to shutter or dras-
tically reduce operations, like on Long 
Island, where they rely on the Long Is-
land Rail Road. The damage to re-
gional economies and to the national 
economy would be severe. But there is 
not a penny—not one single penny—in 
the Republican bill to help public tran-
sit systems or even help State and 
local governments, which fund a lot of 
the transit systems—not a penny. 
My Republican friends seem to look 
at this crisis through a narrow lens. 
Some of my colleagues have criticized 
Democrats for the outrageous idea of 
wanting to help our State governments 
and the essential public services they 
provide. 
I have news for our colleagues. These 
regional transit systems are mission 
critical to the national economy. It is 
not just a New York problem or a New 
Jersey problem or an Illinois problem, 
it is a national crisis. 
The Metropolitan Transit Authority 
alone carries about 40 percent of the 
Nation’s transit riders and drives as 
much as 10 percent of the national 
GDP—10 percent. The facts argue for 
heavy investment in public transpor-
tation systems to stanch the bleeding 
and jump-start the economy when the 
pandemic wanes. The lack of invest-
ment in transit systems in the Repub-
lican legislation is unacceptable. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. President, finally, according to a 
whistleblower complaint filed by a 
former senior official in the Office of 
Intelligence and Analysis at the De-
partment of Homeland Security, polit-
ical leaders at DHS told him to refrain 
from sharing reports about Putin’s ef-
forts to interfere with our elections be-
cause ‘‘they make the President look 
bad.’’ And this DHS whistleblower goes 
on to allege a broader pattern by 
Trump and his lieutenants of politi-
cizing 
and 
misrepresenting 
intel-
ligence, altering the information to fit 
the President’s way of thinking, what 
the President thinks makes him look 
good. 
We know this President doesn’t like 
to hear the truth. He literally can’t 
handle it. But what is even more 
alarming is that former DNI Director 
Dan Coats, according to Bob Wood-
ward’s new book, could not shake his 
‘‘deep suspicions’’ that Vladimir Putin 
‘‘had something’’ on the President. 
Many Americans believe what Coats 
said; that the reason Donald Trump 
bows down in obeisance to Putin is 
that Putin knows something that the 
President doesn’t want made public. 
That is how egregious the pattern of 
President Trump’s behavior has been. 
It cries out for an explanation, and 
there is no logical one. There is no hon-
orable one. President Trump’s pattern 
of downplaying the threat from Putin, 
placating the dictator, and pursuing 
policies that have long been the goal of 
Moscow asks an enormous question: 
What does President Putin know that 
President Trump is so afraid of? 
Here is what needs to happen. Before 
we leave for the election, there has to 
be an all-Senators briefing on the 
threat from Putin to our election. 
Every 
Senator—Democratic, 
Repub-
lican, 
liberal, 
conservative, 
North, 
South, East, and West—has an obliga-
tion to our constituents and the coun-
try we all love to find out what exactly 
Putin is up to. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my 
colleague from New York for his com-
ments this morning. He is right. We 
have seen this play before. We know 
how it ends. Senator MCCONNELL, the 
Republican leader, comes to the floor 
and proclaims that his latest creation 
is bipartisan; the Democrats have a 
choice to vote yes or no; take it or 
leave it; we are done. 
We have been through this over and 
over again. That is not how Congress or 
human activity works. We have a split 
government between Democrats and 
Republicans. When we sit down to-
gether and compromise, good things 
can happen. We proved it March 26. The 
vote was 96 to 0 for the CARES Act, a 
$3 trillion bill early on to address the 
coronavirus pandemic and to deal with 
the serious challenges to our economy. 
Thank goodness we did it. It gave 
$600 a week in additional Federal sup-
plements and unemployment to fami-
lies who were facing layoffs and clo-
sures of their businesses. We helped

small businesses injecting billions of 
dollars back into protecting their pay-
roll and keeping the lights on for the 
day when they can return. 
It worked, and it worked on a bipar-
tisan basis, but where we are today re-
flects a failure and a repetition on the 
Republican side. 
Explain to me this: Why did the Re-
publican Senate leader refuse to phys-
ically present himself at any stage of 
the negotiation since March 26 for re-
lief from this coronavirus pandemic? 
That is right. Senator MCCONNELL re-
fuses to enter the room where rep-
resentatives of the White House and 
Democratic congressional leaders were 
meeting to discuss a bipartisan com-
promise. We can’t reach a compromise 
unless we clearly have all the parties 
at the table. When the Republican con-
gressional 
leaders—MCCONNELL, 
MCCARTHY of California on the House 
side—boycott these meetings for nego-
tiations, nothing happens. 
I can’t tell you how many times back 
in Illinois during the August recess I 
was asked, so are you going back to 
Washington? 
I said: Yes, we are planning on going 
back the first week in September. 
What are you going to go? 
I said: I don’t know. 
At this point, there has been no nego-
tiation and compromise. Today we 
have a vote. We have been through this 
before. It is a McConnell proposal that 
was not put to any kind of bipartisan 
negotiation. It is a one-sided offering. 
It fails in so many respects. 
Think if you are unemployed, trying 
to make your mortgage payments, car 
payments, medical bill payments, cred-
it card payments, put food on the 
table, make sure the kids are ready to 
go back to school, and Senator MCCON-
NELL announces, well, we are going to 
cut that check you have been receiving 
for unemployment benefits in half. It 
will not be $600 a week; it will be $300 
a week. 
Why? For that family, their needs 
and their bills are still the same. The 
economy is still hurting, with 30 mil-
lion-plus 
Americans 
out 
of 
work, 
800,000 in Illinois receiving unemploy-
ment benefits, I am sure thousands in 
the Commonwealth of Kentucky. And 
yet the reality is, what is going to be 
proposed by Senator MCCONNELL today 
will create a hardship on these families 
they never envisioned. 
Is there any money in there to pro-
tect these families from being evicted? 
No. Wait a minute. How about food 
stamps and SNAP? Many of these fami-
lies are struggling to put food on the 
table. Any help in this bill for them? 
No. How about money for testing so 
that we can find out if people have 
positive results and should quarantine 
themselves and stay away from others? 
No, not the kind of investment that is 
needed at this moment in history. 
Time and again, what this Senator 
from Kentucky has given us is just an 
effort to say we tried. But he didn’t. He 
didn’t present himself at one of the ne-
gotiations to make a bipartisan bill. 
There is one provision I just want to 
spend a minute on here that really is 
troubling. Senator MCCONNELL has an-
nounced for months that nothing will 
move, nothing will help Americans un-
employed or small businesses until he 
gets what he called his redline proposal 
on liability immunity. 
Basically, what they have done is to 
write a provision in this bill which ab-
solves businesses from their responsi-
bility to the public and to their em-
ployees when it comes to safety in the 
workplace and the marketplace. They 
have argued they have to do it because 
of the tsunami of frivolous lawsuits 
they anticipate because of COVID–19. 
It turns out that that so-called tsu-
nami has never materialized. The law-
suits that are being filed are primarily 
by businesses against insurance compa-
nies to decide coverage under insurance 
policies and by inmates in prisons who 
are protesting what they consider to be 
inhumane conditions in the midst of a 
pandemic. It is only a handful of law-
suits that have been filed against busi-
nesses or malpractice suits related to 
COVID–19 infections. 
Here is the bottom line: Conscien-
tious businesspeople in Illinois and 
across America are prepared to make 
their business place safe for the people 
who work there in the marketplace. 
What they need is a rational, clear 
statement of public health experts as 
to what they must do. I heard this over 
and over again. They said to me: Sen-
ator, give me the standards on social 
distancing and labeling and sanitizers 
and masks, and we will live up to them. 
We can never guarantee that some-
one will not file a frivolous lawsuit, 
but we should be able to say to people, 
if you will follow the public health ex-
perts with a real standard of care, then 
your motion to dismiss is going to pre-
vail in that lawsuit, and that will be 
the end of it. 
But Senator MCCONNELL thinks there 
is a better way to really absolve them 
from meeting any standard when it 
comes to public health. In fact, what 
he proposes today basically says: If you 
try to comply with any local ordi-
nance, good enough; enough said; it 
doesn’t have to be any standard of pub-
lic health that is credible. 
This doesn’t keep America safe. What 
it is going to do is encourage the bad 
actors to do little or nothing. If we are 
going to deal with this pandemic, ev-
eryone has to be serious about it—from 
wearing 
these 
masks 
to 
social 
distancing, to putting up with what has 
become a tedious responsibility of 
staying away from friends and family 
when you want to be with them to get 
this behind us. 
When it comes to the business and 
marketplace, the same thing applies. 
They are going to have to pitch in, if 
they want to reopen—and I wish they 
could today or tomorrow—but if I, they 
went to reopen, they have to pitch in 
with a good-faith effort to meet a good 
public standard. I will stand by them, 
and everyone else will too. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s approach ab-
solves them from responsibility. It is 
liability immunity and an invitation 
for bad actors to do little or nothing in 
protecting innocent people, including 
their own employees. 
I am going to yield the floor at this 
point and say that we can do better 
than what Senator MCCONNELL is offer-
ing the Senate today. We can gather on 
a bipartisan basis and reach a com-
promise if he will attend the negotia-
tions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have listened to the minority whip 
here. I would say that I agree with him. 
This bill that we will have an oppor-
tunity to vote on later this afternoon 
does not have everything in it. I think 
almost—I think every one of us would 
agree, it doesn’t have everything that 
we would like. It certainly doesn’t have 
everything that I would like. In fact, it 
has a few things in there that I would 
have just as soon be jettisoned. 
What we will have an opportunity to 
vote on today is a targeted relief meas-
ure. It is targeted toward our small 
business men and women who have 
been feeling the kick to the gut on a 
daily basis in my State and certainly 
in a State like Florida that relies on 
tourism. It is targeted relief that is de-
signed to help our kids get back into 
school and teachers to be able to be in 
a safe environment. It is targeted relief 
that is designed to help provide addi-
tional childcare resources. It is tar-
geted relief to help us advance to a vac-
cine that is readable and traceable and 
affordable to all Americans. It is tar-
geted relief that will help us with addi-
tional testing. 
I think we recognize that more test-
ing is going to be better than less test-
ing. There is assistance for the U.S. 
Postal Service. It is not enough, in my 
view. I would like to see it increased 
significantly, but that is not in there. 
But there is some targeted relief for 
our Postal Service as well. 
The minority whip mentions the li-
ability protection that is included 
within this measure. It has been no se-
cret that that has been a priority not 
only of the majority leader but of a 
majority of so many of us who have 
looked at and heard from those in our 
communities, our school districts that 
are concerned about their liability, our 
small businesses that are concerned 
about reopening with no liability. This 
is not a ‘‘get out of jail free’’ card. This 
is designed that if you have followed 
the protocols, if you have followed the 
requirements that have been set out 
there, that you are not going to lose 
that business. Your school district is 
not going to be, really in terms of their 
funding, eroded because of litigation. 
Again, it does not absolve if you have 
been negligent in any way here. 
What I want to reinforce is, we will 
have an opportunity here to vote on a 
measure today that is not everything

to everybody. We couldn’t get there. 
Negotiations—I think it is fair to say 
we all wish that there had been greater 
success with broader bipartisan nego-
tiation. We haven’t gotten to this 
place. 
We are at a place where we do have 
an opportunity to put a measure out 
there that is more directed in its tar-
geted relief; that does leave out certain 
areas; that, in my view, does include 
some things that should not be in here, 
but it is where we are today. 
We either have an opportunity to do 
some incremental steps to build on 
what we put in place with the CARES 
Act several months ago or to do noth-
ing for an indeterminate period of 
time. 
I can tell you that in my State, I 
have small businesses for whom the 
PPP was a lifesaver. But I come from a 
State where we are pretty seasonally 
focused with our economy, and the re-
lief they were able to get for those few 
months in the summertime, that al-
lowed them to stay open. 
When you don’t have your tourists 
come to town and when you really 
don’t have your economy kick into 
gear during the summer—believe it or 
not, folks—it doesn’t happen in the 
wintertime in Alaska. We don’t have 
those people coming to visit us. We 
don’t have the cruise ships. We don’t 
have the airplanes that are filled with 
people willing to come and spend their 
money. So we have to wait until at 
least next May. Alaskans, right now, 
are hoping and praying that they can 
hold on until May. 
There are some things in this tar-
geted relief package that directly helps 
them. There is an opportunity for a 
second round, an opportunity that is 
focused on our smaller businesses, an 
opportunity for an extension of time 
within 
which 
to 
pay 
down 
those 
CARES Act monies. The thing I have 
heard more often than anything else is 
this: Give us more time to spend this 
because we don’t want to spend it on 
things that we don’t need right now be-
cause we know that the winter is going 
to be long and dark and tough. Give us 
that ability. We didn’t get the flexi-
bility that we had asked for. That 
would have been important. 
The time extension will be impor-
tant. The loan forgiveness piece for the 
smaller loans will be important. The 
extension of the additional UI will be 
important. No, it is not a full $600, but 
it does allow for additional support for 
those who are suffering most. 
Again, what we are trying to do is to 
target the relief and not put it all out 
there in areas where some didn’t need 
it, some did, and hope we get it right. 
Again, this is a measure that many 
will say is a half measure, but I am 
talking to folks back home who are 
saying: Give us something. We need to 
have something now because otherwise 
we don’t know how long we can hold 
on. 
This is something that I am going to 
be supporting later this afternoon, de-
spite what I point to as the flaws in it. 
I am not going to spend my time here 
today to talk about why I disagree 
with some of the school choice provi-
sions that are in here. I think my posi-
tion on that is relatively well known. 
But I am going to vote for this regard-
less of the fact that those provisions 
are in there because there are provi-
sions that are going to help our fisher-
men, that are going to help our small 
businesses, that are going to help our 
schools, and that are going to help us 
help those who need this additional un-
employment insurance. 
There is a measure in this bill, 
though, that has evoked an interesting 
bit of controversy. It is in an area that 
I offered. This comes from the text of 
my American Mineral Security Act. 
This is a bill that we reported from the 
Energy Committee last year. The por-
tion of the bill that is in controversy 
right now, according to my friends on 
the other side of the aisle, is actually 
text from a bipartisan bill that my 
friend and the ranking member on the 
Energy Committee inserted himself. I 
cosponsored it. It would effectively au-
thorize the Department of Energy to 
conduct research to develop advanced 
processes to help recover rare earth 
elements from coal and coal byprod-
ucts. It authorizes. It doesn’t appro-
priate. It authorizes $23 million a year 
for 7 fiscal years. 
We saw that this was a particularly 
worthy provision to advance. We know 
that we import almost all of our rare 
earths from abroad, primarily from 
China. We know the supply is precar-
ious. China has already demonstrated 
its willingness to cut off another coun-
try when it feels like it. And we know 
we need this, whether it is for iPhones, 
flat screens, jet engines, satellites. It is 
all about supply chain. 
I was a little bit bemused, I guess, 
when I saw that this particular provi-
sion was the object of partisan scorn. It 
was actually the Obama administra-
tion that helped fund the research to 
examine the potential of these tech-
nologies. NETL, the National Energy 
Technology Lab, has been working on 
this, as have a number of universities. 
When you think about what we are 
doing here, we are seeking to recover 
rare earths from coal waste. It is a lit-
tle bit like turning your trash into 
treasure. It is the ultimate in recy-
cling. You have already disturbed the 
earth. That has already happened. 
What we are doing now is we are going 
through that and trying to determine 
if we can’t utilize some of that waste 
for something of great value—rare 
earths. It could ironically add to our 
domestic 
supplies 
without 
necessi-
tating new mines. You would think 
that those on the other side of the aisle 
who don’t like mining would agree that 
recycling that waste is a strong and a 
positive thing to do. 
Some have said: Why is this Amer-
ican Mineral Security Act or any of the 
provisions in this bill at all? I think 
one of the things we learned from this 
pandemic is that supply chains really 
matter, whether it is supply chains in 
the 
pharmaceutical 
end 
or 
supply 
chains when it comes to these min-
erals. They are so essential to every-
thing that we do. 
There have been some interesting at-
tacks on this bipartisan provision. One 
of my Democratic colleagues declared 
that it could ‘‘fast-track coal mines.’’ 
One said it is ‘‘targeted to corporate 
donors.’’ Another said on Twitter that 
this amounts to ‘‘corporate welfare to 
the coal industry during a climate 
emergency.’’ It is so wrong on so many 
levels that you don’t know where to 
begin to rebut that. 
Let me just cite a couple. For a 
starting point, the Department of En-
ergy has a research mission. DOE does 
not permit coal mines. So there is no 
fast-tracking under the provision be-
cause there is no authority within the 
DOE to do so. It doesn’t exist. We are 
not putting labs in charge of the review 
process. You are not going to see one of 
your National Labs now become a per-
mitting office. 
I have also been surprised to hear 
that research grants from the Depart-
ment of Energy are somehow or an-
other corporate welfare now. I have a 
great deal of respect for the work that 
goes on within DOE. I think that they 
are the ultimate engine for innovation, 
leading to good jobs, economic growth, 
cleaner 
air, 
cleaner 
water. 
These 
grants are not just directed to indus-
try. Many of our universities will be 
among the likely recipients. 
It is important, I think, to recognize 
that what we are establishing within 
this measure is something that would 
benefit our economy, benefit jobs, and 
benefit the environment. I mentioned 
that this provision is an authorization 
of appropriations. It doesn’t allocate 
any taxpayer dollars. It simply creates 
a new option for those of us who serve 
as appropriators to choose as part of 
our normal budgeting process. We have 
seen a lot of accusations—misleading 
attacks over different things that are 
in this bill or perhaps some things that 
are not in the measure. 
I think, again, what we have in front 
of us is an opportunity to provide tar-
geted relief to Americans at a time 
when they are in need. What we do 
today, how we do it today, I think, is 
important. I think it is unfortunate 
that we will likely see this as a wholly 
partisan exercise. I would like to think 
that we would have a different out-
come. I would like to think that each 
of us can look at these provisions and 
say: Well, it might not be as much as I 
would like for my constituents in Flor-
ida or Alaska, but it does allow us to 
advance one step further. 
My hope is that we will continue ag-
gressive negotiations because I con-
tinue to hear from people in my State 
who are still reeling from the impacts 
of this pandemic. They do not see the 
upcoming months giving them notable 
relief from an economic perspective. 
They want to know that their Federal

S. RES. 685 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I come to 
the 
floor 
to 
first 
thank 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH for leading many of us to 
come to the floor this week to stand in 
solidarity with all of the military fam-
ilies around the country and through-
out our Nation’s history who have sac-
rificed so much in service to our coun-
try. 
I hope we can all join together, not 
as Republicans and Democrats but as 
servants of the American people, in ex-
pressing outrage and disgust at the 
comments made by the President that 
were confirmed by multiple news out-
lets last week. A deep reverence for 
servicemembers, including the Pre-
siding Officer, who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice for our country, has 
never before been a partisan issue in 
this body or in our country. 
These Americans laid down their 
lives because they loved this country, 
and they loved what we stand for. They 
understood something that President 
Trump never will, which is the idea of 
service—the ethos of giving your all for 
something greater than yourself. 
I know some of my colleagues will 
continue to bury their heads in the 
sand to pretend the President couldn’t 
possibly have said those things, but if 
you don’t believe it is within President 
Trump’s character to denigrate our 
troops, you haven’t been paying atten-
tion over the last 5 years. 
President Trump called our former 
colleague and our friend Senator John 
McCain—an American war hero to 
every one of us—a loser. He denigrated 
all POWs and their families when he 
said he liked people who were not cap-
tured. He attacked a Gold Star family, 
whose son paid the ultimate sacrifice 
for our country, with anti-Muslim big-
otry. He repeatedly attacked and re-
taliated 
against 
LTC 
Alexander 
Vindman, who spent his entire life 
serving our country. 
Yet, as despicable and disrespectful 
as they are, it is not just President 
Trump’s words—it is his actions. He di-
verted funding from our military bases 
to pay for his vanity project border 
wall. 
He has made it easier for payday 
lenders to prey on our servicemembers 
by selling them predatory loans at ex-
orbitant 
rates. 
In 
Dayton, 
go 
to 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and 
look at the payday lenders that just 
crop up around our military bases. 
The President handed out favors to 
foreign banks, like Santander, that il-
legally 
repossessed 
servicemembers’ 
cars and illegally foreclosed on their 
homes while they were defending our 
country. 
He ordered the closure of the mili-
tary’s newspaper, Stars and Stripes, 
because it refused to serve as a propa-
ganda machine for him. Under pres-
sure, he is saying he is now going to 
bring it back. 
Now he is failing to protect our 
troops and our veterans from this dis-
ease. His administration used them as 
guinea pigs this spring by prescribing 
them hydroxychloroquine tablets—an 
unproven COVID treatment. He did 
that this spring while he was not tell-
ing the country about the seriousness 
of this disease. 
None of this should be partisan. I 
know my Republican colleagues and I 
disagree on a lot of things—taxes and 
budgets and healthcare policy—but I 
have never heard any of us disagree on 
the fact that Americans who serve our 
country are American heroes. Whether 
they fought during World War I or 
fought against fascists in World War II, 
like my father did, or are defending us 
today, we owe them and their families 
a debt of gratitude. Those who made 
the ultimate sacrifice were mothers 
and fathers and sons and daughters and 
aunts and uncles. They had hopes, and 
they had dreams of devoting careers to 
service. 
All of my colleagues have spoken to 
the families of the fallen. We try to 
empathize with the unbearable pain 
they go through. Some of my col-
leagues have been those brothers or sis-
ters or sons or daughters. All of our 
servicemembers and all of our veterans 
and all of their families deserve better. 
I ask my colleagues to join me and 
Senator DUCKWORTH in standing in soli-
darity with all American servicemem-
bers and veterans and their families. 
We will never forget the debt we owe 
you. We are humbled by your commit-
ment to service. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

objection, it is so ordered.

CONFIRMATION OF HALA Y. 
JARBOU 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
have two items I would like to speak 
for a few moments on today, but first I 
want to rise to say how pleased I am 
that the Senate voted to confirm Judge 
Hala Jarbou to serve as the Federal 
judge in the U.S. District Circuit for 
the Western District of Michigan. 
Both Senator PETERS and I supported 
her, returned our blue slips, and were 
very pleased to support her confirma-
tion. I think she will do an excellent 
job. 
Her story, Judge Jarbou’s story, is 
really an American story. She was born 
in Iraq and came to this country as a 
young girl. She was the first person in 
her family to earn her college degree 
from the University of Michigan and

her law degree from Wayne State Uni-
versity. 
She is the first Chaldean judge to 
serve at the circuit court level in Oak-
land County, MI, and she is now the 
first Chaldean-American to serve on 
the Federal bench. So I am very, very 
pleased that she was confirmed today. 
Judge Jarbou greatly values the op-
portunity she has been given, I know, 
and has worked to extend those oppor-
tunities to others during her career. 
She is active in the Michigan legal 
community and in the Chaldean Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce and other 
cultural organizations. 
She served as a mentor and has 
worked to increase the diversity of 
clerks in her own courtroom. Again, I 
am just very pleased that she was over-
whelmingly confirmed by the U.S. Sen-
ate today. 
f 
HONORING MILITARY VETERANS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise now on behalf of the more than 19 
million people in our Nation and half a 
million people in Michigan who show 
us every day what service and sacrifice 
and love of country is really all about. 
These patriots landed on beaches in 
Normandy and the Pacific theater, 
crept through jungles in Korea, shed 
blood in Vietnam, survived attacks in 
Iraq, and fought terrorists in Afghani-
stan. These people are heroes. They 
love our Nation so much. They are 
willing to put their lives on the line for 
our democracy, our people, and our 
way of life. 
That is why it is so incredibly shock-
ing and infuriating to hear the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Com-
mander in Chief of our Armed Forces, 
disparage 
our 
veterans. 
President 
Trump called them losers and suck-
ers—losers and suckers. He said he 
couldn’t understand why anyone would 
join the military because ‘‘What is in it 
for them?’’ 
He said veterans who had lost limbs 
shouldn’t be in parades. Why? Because 
he couldn’t handle seeing them. He 
didn’t think people would want to see 
them. People in Michigan want to see 
them and thank them and do so every 
day. 
We all remember what he said about 
our former colleague and friend, the 
late Senator John McCain. President 
Trump said that he prefers veterans 
who didn’t get captured. 
My own dad served in the Navy dur-
ing World War II. He signed up because 
he believed in a cause bigger than him-
self. Perhaps President Trump doesn’t 
understand, but my dad was a sailor, 
not a sucker. 
About one in four people who have 
served in our armed services now live 
with a service-connected disability. 
President Trump, these veterans are 
leaders; they aren’t losers. 
President Trump wonders what is in 
it for them. Well, maybe he should ask 
them because we all know what they 
would say. We all know what they 
would say: pride, duty, honor, the feel-
ing that comes from putting something 
or someone above yourself. It is becom-
ing increasingly clear that these aren’t 
feelings that the current occupant of 
the Oval Office understands. 
My dad once told me something I 
have never forgotten. In fact, it has in-
fluenced my whole life as an elected of-
ficial. He said that a veteran should 
never stand at the back of any line for 
a job, for healthcare, for education, or 
for the military recognitions they 
earned. My dad came home after World 
War II and went to school on the GI 
bill, and I don’t know what would have 
happened to our family if he had not 
had that opportunity. So my dad said 
over and over again that a veteran 
should not stand at the back of any 
line. They certainly shouldn’t be put at 
the end of the line by their own Presi-
dent. It is appalling that this even 
needs to be said, actually. 
When I heard these comments and 
heard them verified over and over 
again in every media outlet from right 
to left, verifying that, in fact, these 
were his comments, it was stunning. It 
was appalling. It made me very angry. 
Our veterans deserve a place of honor 
at the front of the line—at the front of 
the line. They deserve a Commander in 
Chief who respects them, who honors 
their service, and, frankly, who gets it. 
Thank goodness we have people who 
believe in things beyond themselves. 
Thank goodness we have people who 
are willing to stand up for all of us, to 
keep us safe and stand up for our val-
ues and our country. 
So on behalf of the people of Michi-
gan, I want to say thank you to every-
one who has served and everyone who 
is currently serving our country in our 
armed services. We are truly grateful 
for your sacrifice and service and your 
willingness to stand up and support and 
defend our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
ALEXANDER). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, thank 
you. I am on the floor today to talk 
about the coronavirus pandemic and 
what we can and should do here in the 
U.S. Senate and in Congress as a whole 
to actually address the ongoing prob-
lem. 
We are not out of the woods yet. We 
still have a healthcare crisis and, of 
course, an economic crisis that is a 
consequence of that. 
We have done some good bipartisan 
work over the past 6 months. In fact, 
not many people realize that we have 
actually passed five or six bills with 
strong bipartisan majorities. The one 
people know about most is the biggest 
one, the CARES Act. I think it got 97 
votes here on the floor of the Senate— 
97 to nothing. 
We have in the past been able to fig-
ure out a way to come together as Re-
publicans and Democrats and as Ameri-
cans to be able to address this crisis. 
We need to do it again because we still 
do have a crisis. We still do have unac-
ceptably high levels of people getting 
infected, hospitalized, being in the ICU, 
fatalities, and, of course, our economy 
is not where any of us would like to see 
it although it has improved signifi-
cantly, in part because of the legisla-
tion we passed here. 
I am convinced that we would be at 
over 10 percent unemployment still if 
not for the legislation we passed here. 
Instead, we are beginning to come 
down—8.4 percent last month. That is 
faster than anybody thought it could. 
Still, of course, it is unacceptably high. 
So more help is needed, and we can’t 
let the upcoming election and the poli-
tics around that keep us from getting 
together and continuing to do the work 
that we have to do. We haven’t been 
able, in the last 5 or 6 weeks, to do 
that. Instead, we have been working 
kind of on opposite sides of the aisle on 
our own projects. 
Today we voted on a bill that had a 
majority of the U.S. Senators sup-
porting it. That is not how you pass 
something around here; there has to be 
a supermajority—60 votes. But a ma-
jority of the Senators in this Chamber 
just voted for legislation that has 
strong bipartisan appeal I would think 
because, as we will talk about in a sec-
ond, almost every element is supported 
by the Democrats, Republicans, and, 
most importantly, by the American 
people. 
What we have done is we have kind of 
fallen into camps. So the Democrats 
passed a bill in the House called the 
Heroes Act. It is a $3.5 trillion bill. Re-
member, we have already spent about 
$3.5 trillion, making this the largest 
deficit in the history of our country 
and making our debt now, for the first 
time since World War II, the size of our 
entire economy. That concerns all of 
us, and it should. I hope it concerns all 
of us because our fiscal situation going 
forward for our kids and grandkids is 
something we should be concerned 
about too. 
Anyway, the $3.5 trillion bill is a 
grab bag, to be honest. Some of it is re-
lated to COVID–19, but some of it is 
not. As an example, there is a provision 
in there that I hope would be a non-
starter that changes our tax laws and 
repeals the State and local tax deduc-
tion cap that was put in place just re-
cently. This gives a huge break to 
wealthy Americans. In fact, 40 percent 
of this benefit, according to the Joint 
Committee on Taxation, goes to the 
top 1 percent of wage earners. What 
does 
that 
have 
to 
do 
with 
the 
coronavirus? It will help millionaires

on both coasts a lot, but it really does 
not affect the crisis that we are in. 
They also want to use this $3.5 tril-
lion package as a way to make changes 
in our immigration policy. Now, that is 
pretty controversial stuff as it stands, 
and that is going to make, of course, 
that bill hard to pass because of the 
immigration 
policy. 
People 
have 
strong views on it. It has no place in a 
COVID–19 bill. 
One that also concerns those of us 
who are concerned about the election 
coming up is it puts Federal mandates 
in place on the States that are unprec-
edented with regard to their election 
system. Now, that is something we 
have always left to the province of the 
States, but, instead, it puts mandates 
in place on the electoral system. That 
is not, again, something that is going 
to help us in terms of the coronavirus. 
So my hope is that those House 
Democrats who passed that bill can 
now see what we passed over here. This 
is a targeted bill that focuses on the 
coronavirus. It is less than $500 billion, 
which used to be a lot of money around 
here, but as compared to the $3.5 tril-
lion. So it is obviously a lot less 
money, but it is also more targeted and 
more focused. 
Again, I think so much of it is policy 
that can be supported by both sides of 
the aisle. It will really help to continue 
the efforts we started here to help ad-
dress the healthcare crisis but also 
help with regard to the weak economic 
performance as a result of people being 
isolated from the economy. 
I heard someone this week say we 
have a K-shaped recovery. What does 
that mean? Well, think of the letter 
‘‘K.’’ A lot of people say you want to 
have a V-shaped recovery, where you 
go down steeply through a recession 
and you come back up just as steeply. 
That is where I think a lot of America 
is. In other words, a lot of families and 
a lot of businesses have seen a pretty 
rapid recovery here in the past few 
months, but there are others who have 
not. 
So the top part of the K is true for a 
lot of people and a lot of businesses— 
think of the businesses that provide 
food, the grocery stores; the businesses 
that are involved in construction, busi-
nesses like Home Depot or Lowe’s that 
provide building products. They are 
doing well. They are at the top of the 
K. They are in the V. 
But there are others that are in the 
bottom. That would include travel and 
hospitality. It would certainly include 
the airlines and bus companies. They 
are having a tough time. Many of our 
smaller 
retail 
businesses—certainly 
our bars, movie theaters, and bowling 
alleys—they are having a tough time. 
So there is a bottom end to that. 
This is an uneven recovery, and we 
have to acknowledge that. Therefore, 
to my colleagues on my side of the 
aisle who might say, you know, we 
have done enough; the recovery is on; 
everything is good, unfortunately, that 
is not true. I wish it were. I wish we 
had turned the corner on the economy 
and also begun to turn the corner on 
the virus. We can’t say that yet. We 
have made progress. No question about 
it. I think we are on the right track, 
but we are in a K-shaped recovery, I be-
lieve. 
By the way, it is the same thing with 
individuals. Think about it. If you own 
your own home, the value of your home 
has probably gone up. You are probably 
in pretty good shape, particularly if 
you are trying to sell your home right 
now. It is a good time to sell, I guess. 
If you invest it in the stock market, 
which a lot of the people who own their 
homes are, it has been darn good. The 
market increase has been substantial. I 
was on a program this morning where 
they were talking about how the 
Nasdaq was back up again, and the 
tech stocks, if you are in the tech 
world, are doing great. 
But let’s say you don’t own your own 
home. Let’s say you are a renter. Your 
rent is likely to start going up if it 
hasn’t already, and then, you are not 
invested in the markets, so you are not 
taking advantage of that, and yet your 
job is at risk and may be gone. So, 
again, K-shaped isn’t it. Some people 
are doing quite well, and others are 
still having a rough time and need help 
to be able to deal with the issue of the 
coronavirus and the economic fallout 
from that. 
By the way, this K-shaped recovery, I 
believe, has increased inequality in 
terms of our income in this country, 
and income inequality was something 
we were making progress on. In Feb-
ruary, we had the 19th straight month 
of wages increasing over 3 percent in 
this country just in February, not long 
ago. And, by the way, most of that in-
crease was among lower and middle-in-
come workers. Now, that was positive. 
That was where we wanted to head as a 
country. That is why so many of us 
pushed for tax reform and regulatory 
relief thinking that would get this 
economy moving and help those work-
ers who are in the lower and middle-in-
come bracket the most, and, guess 
what, it did. 
That has changed now so we have to, 
here in Congress, in my view, continue 
to help, continue to do things that will 
help with the healthcare crisis and 
with regard to the underlying eco-
nomic situation that is affected by it. 
One thing that I think was very posi-
tive about today is that we were able 
to pass legislation that has many, 
many bipartisan elements to it. I think 
the vote we just had—again, where a 
majority of Senators in this Chamber 
voted for a targeted COVID–19 ap-
proach—I think this gives us a chance 
to reset, a chance to get back to the 
bargaining table, and a chance to say: 
OK. Now the Republicans have put for-
ward a proposal that has a lot of very 
reasonable provisions in it. 
The Presiding Officer here today was 
part of that. He put provisions into the 
bill that has to do with our schools. It 
is widely popular. There are other pro-
visions in there that I think there is 
very little disagreement on. Let me 
highlight a few of them. 
One is on the healthcare response, 
particularly on our testing capacity. 
Republicans and Democrats alike know 
that testing is critical. We need it. In 
Ohio, we are looking for more funding 
for testing because we know that is 
how you stop the spread of the dis-
ease—testing, contact tracing, getting 
to the hotspots and trying to contain 
it. That way people will feel more com-
fortable returning to work, returning 
to shop, and returning to school. This 
is something that is in this legislation, 
$16 billion alone for testing. The legis-
lation that was voted on this afternoon 
in this Chamber was voted positively 
by a majority of the Senators. 
Just last week, in Ohio, I visited The 
Health Collaborative, which is a multi-
agency coalition approach to dealing 
with COVID–19. It includes hospitals, 
county commissioners, health commis-
sioners, and even nursing homes. They 
are utilizing the $19 million they have 
received through the CARES Act to 
fund and design and execute a testing 
strategy for people in the Southwest 
Ohio area. I am really pleased to see 
them take the funding and using it in 
this way because now more and more 
people are getting the opportunity to 
be tested, and, by the way, they are 
doing it on a no-needs basis. There is 
no need to pay for this testing with 
your insurance. If you don’t have it, 
everybody is welcome to get a test. 
These kinds of initiatives are a big 
help, and I am glad that in this legisla-
tion we voted on this afternoon, we 
added another $45 billion in total to 
HHS to go toward testing and vaccine 
development to get this vaccine as 
quickly as possible, and distribution of 
the vaccine, helping on the antiviral 
medications. This ‘‘Shark Tank’’ con-
cept that the Presiding Officer and oth-
ers are involved in is brilliant because 
it sort of tells the private sector: Look, 
we are going to provide you the basic 
funding to go out there and compete to 
come up with a safe way to develop a 
vaccine or antiviral therapy, and that 
has encouraged competition in it, and 
in unprecedented speed, we are devel-
oping these alternatives—thank good-
ness—and we need them. Hopefully, by 
the end of this year, we will have them. 
Second, I think we agree that Con-
gress should double down on any 
COVID–19 policies in previous legisla-
tions that have worked well, and, one, 
of course, is what is called the Pay-
check Protection Program. That is in 
this legislation we voted on today too. 
Back on August 8, it ended. So if you 
are a small business out there and you 
have not already taken advantage of 
the PPP program that many of your 
peers have and you have seen them be 
able to keep their doors open because 
of it, you are out of luck right now be-
cause the program is not accepting new 
applicants. So we need to extend that 
program. I think everybody agrees 
with that. I don’t know a Senator in

September 10, 2020 
this Chamber who doesn’t have an ex-
perience back home of a small business 
saying: I couldn’t have stayed open 
without this. I visited three or four 
businesses just in the past few weeks in 
Ohio, and all of them had the same 
story. 
Different 
timing, 
different 
busi-
nesses, some in construction, some in 
the restaurant business, some in manu-
facturing, but what they all tell me is 
they needed that influx badly. It pro-
vided them a low interest loan—1 per-
cent. They converted it into a grant, 
effectively, because the loan was for-
given if they used it for their salaries 
or for their utilities or for their mort-
gage or rent. They would have had to 
close their doors and let a lot of people 
go. They were able to hang on. 
For some of these businesses, like the 
manufacturer I visited, thank good-
ness, because they would have let go 30 
percent of their workforce. They didn’t 
have to do that. They kept everybody 
on. Now they are going great guns. 
They are looking for people. By the 
way, they are having a tough time hir-
ing people. They are looking for people. 
That is a good sign that you have busi-
nesses out there trying to pull people 
into the workforce. That is in this leg-
islation. 
My hope is that we are going to see 
Republicans and Democrats agree on 
this. I think they do agree. Reinstating 
the PPP for the foreseeable future so 
that more small businesses can take 
advantage of this smart loan program 
is a smart thing to do. It is more tar-
geted, and it does require you to show 
a loss of revenue. That is OK. That is 
good. We want this to be targeted and 
focused. 
We 
don’t 
want 
to 
waste 
money. 
Third, the bill reflects that Members 
on both sides of the aisle recognize 
that Congress should give additional 
support to our schools. I mentioned 
this earlier, but $105 billion in this bill 
goes to education—about $70 billion to 
K–12, 
our 
primary 
and 
secondary 
schools and high schools, and that is 
needed right now. We are trying to re-
open around the country, and many of 
these schools are telling me: ROB, I 
have got additional costs. I have got 
these Plexiglass shields I have to put 
up. I have to reconfigure the class-
room. I have to hire more teachers be-
cause I want smaller classrooms so 
that if someone gets sick, it will be in-
fecting a smaller group. There is fund-
ing that is needed for remote learning. 
So this is good for us to provide fund-
ing for these schools because that will 
enable them to reopen and reopen safe-
ly and stay open. That is in this legis-
lation. 
There is also funding in here for col-
leges and universities. I think there is 
about $30 billion for that. Again, it is 
the same thing I am hearing back 
home from our colleges and univer-
sities, some of which are having a 
tough time staying open. They do need 
more help, more testing, more PPE, 
personal protective gear, so this is im-
portant too. Again, that is all in this 
legislation. 
Interestingly, I mentioned the Heroes 
Act earlier, the $3.5 trillion bill that 
the House Democrats passed not too 
long ago as kind of their alternative, 
that had funding for schools also. 
Guess what. This bill that was passed— 
well, not passed but voted on by a ma-
jority of Senators today in the U.S. 
Senate—actually has slightly more 
money than the Heroes Act has for 
education. What is the big issue here? 
Why can’t we get together and figure 
this out? 
There are so many opportunities 
here. Finally, I would just say that one 
thing that this bill does and one reason 
it is called a targeted bill is it repur-
poses funding that we have already ap-
propriated here in the first four or five 
bills but that has not been used and is 
not likely to be needed. So isn’t that 
smart? I mean, as taxpayers, don’t you 
want to be sure that we are not just 
throwing money at this problem if is 
not needed? 
The Treasury Department, in par-
ticular, has been helpful in working 
with us, saying they have a bunch of 
money that they could use for a loan 
program that they haven’t had much 
takeup on because, frankly, the com-
mercial lending is going pretty well 
right now. People are able get the 
money from their bank. They don’t 
need to come to Treasury or the Fed as 
much as we thought they might, so 
there is money left over. We are talk-
ing hundreds of billions of dollars. So 
that should certainly be used to offset 
the cost of any new program. I think 
that is just a commonsense idea. I 
can’t imagine anybody in this Cham-
ber, if they think through this, would 
be against us repurposing the funds we 
have already appropriated toward new 
uses that are more targeted. That is in 
this legislation too. 
I think those things all have bipar-
tisan appeal, and it seems to me, again, 
this is a reset. Let’s face it, the Demo-
crats have been saying over the past 
several weeks: Well, fine, we have got 
our bill we passed, the Heroes Act. 
What have you guys put out showing 
that at least a majority of the Senate 
and pretty much every Republican can 
support? Now we have done that. 
So we have our stake in the ground, 
and they have their stake in the 
ground. There is a lot of overlap. I just 
talked about four areas where there is 
considerable overlap, but there are 
many others as well. We should be able 
to figure this out on behalf of the 
American people. 
We have a campaign ongoing for 
President, for Senators, and for Mem-
bers of Congress. We have to look out 
for the interests of the American peo-
ple here. We can do both. We can cam-
paign and also be working on our legis-
lation that is absolutely needed right 
now for the healthcare and economic 
future of our country. 
By the way, only about one-third of 
the Senate is up for reelection, so for 
two-thirds of us, we don’t even have an 
election to worry about, and yet it 
seems like this place has become way 
too political too quickly. Let’s focus on 
taking this bill that was voted on 
today where the majority of Senators 
supported it and figure out ways to 
work with Democrats to come up with 
a new approach that enables us to con-
tinue the effort to help with regard to 
this K-shaped recovery and to help 
with regard to the ongoing healthcare 
crisis we are facing. 
I want to mention, if I could, three or 
four other things I would love to see in 
the final bill that did not make it into 
the so-called targeted bill. I understand 
why they didn’t, and, in part, because 
we weren’t looking to put a lot of tax 
provisions in there because it is not a 
tax vehicle, but I do think there are 
other things that have broad bipartisan 
support that we ought to include. 
First, I think we would all agree it is 
important that the taxpayer-funded re-
search that is supported by this legisla-
tion, research into antiviral medica-
tions and research into vaccines, is 
protected from other countries, in par-
ticular, China coming into our country 
and taking that research. This is tax-
payer-funded research, and we know, 
from what the FBI has told us and 
what the Department of Justice has 
told us, that this is currently at risk. 
It is currently at risk. 
With that in mind, we need to in-
clude legislation that safeguards our 
American innovation. This was actu-
ally in the legislation that was intro-
duced by Senator MCCONNELL a few 
weeks ago called the Heals legislation, 
and the legislation that I am talking 
about is called the Safeguarding Amer-
ican Innovation Act. It stops this kind 
of theft of research and innovation at 
our research institutions, our colleges 
and our universities. That is one where 
Republicans and Democrats have come 
together. It is a bipartisan bill. It is 
the result of a committee process. It is 
the result of an investigation that took 
over a year. It is the result of a lot of 
hearings and a lot of work. It is solid 
legislation to encourage us to be able 
to protect the research we are doing, 
including on the coronavirus. 
Second, for a while now, there has 
been a bipartisan consensus that a 
smart coronavirus response should in-
clude tax incentives to help our econ-
omy to not just open and reopen but to 
do so safely and effectively. Small 
business owners I have spoken to dur-
ing this pandemic, especially in recent 
weeks, have told me they are eager to 
reopen, but they want to do it in a safe 
manner. And we want them to do in a 
safe manner. Let’s provide some incen-
tives for that. 
One example of how that process can 
be helped along is an expanded tax 
credit for new hiring called the work 
opportunity tax credit. It is already 
out there. It is legislation that passed 
years ago. It helps, let’s say, veterans, 
returning citizens, who are looking for 
a second chance. It gives them the

chance to get a job because the em-
ployer gets a tax credit for a while, and 
then almost always that person ends up 
getting a job. 
Let’s include the COVID–19 unem-
ployed in that—people who have lost 
their jobs because of COVID–19. That 
makes all the sense in the world to get 
people back to work. 
There is also something that is in 
law now based on the CARES legisla-
tion called the employee retention tax 
credit. I think this is very important. 
Companies that couldn’t access the 
PPP because they didn’t qualify or 
didn’t want to will have access to this 
program kind of as an alternative. It 
gives companies a tax credit against 
their payroll taxes—the employer side 
of the payroll taxes—if they keep peo-
ple on or bring people on. Again, this 
makes all the sense in the world right 
now to encourage more hiring to en-
sure we can get this economy moving 
again and do so safely. 
Speaking of safety, I have also intro-
duced a new tax credit that was part of 
the HEALS legislation that was intro-
duced a few weeks ago. It is called the 
healthy workplaces tax credit, which 
helps businesses pay for this protective 
equipment, like the plexiglass shields 
and like the PPE that they now need, 
which is expensive. Just the gowns and 
the masks and the gloves—those ex-
penses add up, particularly for busi-
nesses that are having a tough time be-
cause of the weakening economy out 
there. 
These credits will help them not just 
reopen again but reopen safely. I think 
getting these kinds of tax credits into 
the coronavirus legislation would be 
very smart. Again, these should be bi-
partisan efforts. 
Third, while I am pleased we are revi-
talizing the successful PPP program, I 
think there are steps to improve it 
that we ought to take up in whatever 
our final package is. 
For example, one oversight in the 
original PPP legislation is that people 
who have been convicted of a felony 
going back 5 years are not able to ac-
cept a PPP loan. 
One day, I get a call from a guy back 
home. Troy Parker is his name. Troy 
said: I can’t get a PPP loan. I am a guy 
who had a financial issue, a financial 
fraud issue. I had a felony conviction. I 
got out of incarceration, and I started 
my own business. I took my second 
chance. 
He said: I did everything that you are 
always talking about, PORTMAN, which 
is that you want to encourage people 
to take that second chance. You want 
to give them that opportunity to get 
the training to be able to do that. 
Then he went out and hired a bunch 
of other second-chance folks, and he 
started a cleaning business. It is quite 
successful. 
But 
obviously, 
with 
coronavirus, a lot of the offices he 
cleaned and others said: We can’t have 
you come in. He lost his businesses. He 
was about to shut his doors. He 
couldn’t get a PPP loan. Why? Because 
within the last 5 years, he had a felony 
conviction. 
That is not what we should be doing 
here. We shouldn’t be penalizing people 
who have turned their lives around and 
have done all the right things and are 
hiring other second-chance individuals. 
We should be helping them to stay on 
their feet and to continue to do what 
they are doing for themselves, the com-
munity, and the workforce. So we 
worked with the Treasury Department, 
and to their credit, we got them to put 
forward a temporary solution, which 
was a change in the rule so that Troy 
could get his PPP loan and others like 
him around the country. We now need 
to make that permanent. That is an ex-
ample of something we should do—to-
tally bipartisan. 
I worked with colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle on this issue, and 
I will continue to because this is one 
where, again, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, as Americans, would want 
this to be part of the legislation. 
Fourth, while I am glad this bill re-
flects the bipartisan support for edu-
cational funding, I had hoped it would 
also 
reflect 
that 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike have come out for ad-
ditional support and flexibility for 
State and local governments. 
Ohio has been particularly hard hit 
here because our cities in Ohio, unlike 
your city—wherever you are in Amer-
ica, probably—can use income taxes as 
a revenue source. I think 90 percent of 
cities can’t do that, but in Ohio, we 
can, and we do. Obviously, income 
taxes went down with this coronavirus, 
and the economy fell short, so they 
suddenly find themselves with less rev-
enue coming in and then additional ex-
penses: fire, police, EMS, coronavirus 
expenses for public health. 
It has been tough for a lot of our cit-
ies in Ohio, so I have been pushing for 
not just more funding on a targeted 
basis, showing need, but also more 
flexibility to be able to use the funding 
for closing that revenue gap, which is 
caused by the weak economy, which is 
caused by the coronavirus. So it is re-
lated. Certainly, we ought to be able to 
do that on a bipartisan basis. That is 
what a lot of Democrats have said they 
would like to do. I am not the only Re-
publican who wants to work with 
Democrats on that. We could get that 
into a final bill, and that would help all 
of our cities. Let’s move forward on 
this. 
Finally, I think all of us agree that 
we need to have better access to tele-
health. Telehealth medicine has been 
one of the few silver linings in this 
dark cloud. A lot more of my constitu-
ents are using telehealth. One way 
they are using it is for behavioral 
health, mental health services, and an-
other is for addiction services, but also, 
just generally, telehealth has been 
something that has been very helpful. 
A lot of people say that in the last 
few months, we have gone 5 years 
ahead of where we would have been in 
terms of telehealth. I think the same is 
true with regard to teleworking and 
with regard to telelearning. But with 
regard to telehealth, based on a poll I 
recently saw—a survey by Morning 
Consult—one in every four adults—25 
percent—has used telehealth recently 
during the pandemic. It has been a life-
line for so many people, particularly 
for some people who are fighting addic-
tion and can’t get in-person care to 
help their recovery or people who have 
mental health challenges and are able 
to access telehealth to help them. 
I have worked with the Trump ad-
ministration to expand telehealth and 
delivery options, which in some in-
stances has, for instance, allowed ad-
diction specialists to reach new pa-
tients they hadn’t been able to reach 
before. 
There have been some positives here, 
but these reforms are only temporary. 
We need to make these permanent as 
well. We don’t want to lose ground on 
this issue, so Senator WHITEHOUSE, on 
the other side of the aisle, and I have 
introduced 
legislation 
called 
the 
TREATS Act. We want that to be part 
of the final legislation as well. 
We have an opportunity to help with 
telehealth by expanding broadband ac-
cess as well so that more Americans 
can access these services from home. 
This also relates, of course, to edu-
cation when schools are telling us they 
are going to go to partly in-person 
classrooms, partly remote, and some 
altogether remote. If you live in a 
rural area of America, you may not 
have access to broadband, and you are 
at a disadvantage. Also, in a lot of our 
urban school districts, there may be 
the infrastructure for broadband, but it 
is not in the home. 
We need to help more in terms of 
broadband. I am the Senate sponsor of 
a bipartisan, bicameral bill called the 
Rural Broadband Acceleration Act, 
which basically speeds up the FCC’s 
distribution they were going to make 
anyway of $20 billion in rural digital 
funds to go toward the building of 
broadband networks. This will help 
spread high-speed internet over more 
than 400,000 miles of internet fiber ca-
bles, bringing about 3 million new 
households online immediately if we 
can get this done. By the way, it em-
ploys thousands of workers as well. I 
think it is a great investment in infra-
structure that is needed right now. So 
people talking about infrastructure— 
this is one we could do right now that 
helps with regard to telehealth, tele-
medicine, 
telelearning, 
and 
tele-
working. 
The Nation will be looking to Con-
gress in the coming weeks to work to-
gether to make sure that we can im-
prove our response to the coronavirus 
and to help get this economy through a 
tough time. Now more than ever, we 
cannot revert to the norm, which is 
partisanship these days. We cannot do 
that with regard to this issue. 
Using this new targeted bill as a 
base—the one that, again, got a major-
ity of Senators in this Chamber to vote

on today—and voting on some of the 
areas of agreement I have outlined 
today, we need to come up with an ap-
propriate and effective bill that re-
sponds to the challenge. 
I am going to continue to work with 
Republicans and Democrats alike to in-
sist we put the partisanship aside and 
work on behalf of our constituents to 
take the necessary steps to get us 
through this unprecedented healthcare 
crisis and to get us on the other side of 
the economic crisis. I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
work together to do the same.

CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, actions 
speak louder than words, and by their 
actions it is clear that the majority 
leader and Senate Republicans have 
not been serious about passing another 
COVID relief bill that matches the ur-
gency of this moment. 
First, the majority leader wanted to 
take a pause, and then he sat on the 
Housed-passed Heroes Act for months. 
Then in July, he introduced a series of 
inadequate piecemeal bills that went 
absolutely nowhere. Now the majority 
leader and Senate Republicans showed 
their priorities yet again by rushing to 
confirm five more Trump judges and 
offering an anemic, weak COVID bill 
aimed at appeasing the most conserv-
ative Members of their caucus. And we 
just voted on that bill. 
While Senate Republicans have been 
‘‘waiting for Godot’’ on the next COVID 
bill, Senate Democrats have been lis-
tening to our constituents, and we 
have a sense of urgency. We have had 
this sense of urgency for the 4 months 
that we have been waiting for Congress 
to deal with the Heroes Act. We have 
been waiting for over 4 months, as I 
mentioned, for the majority leader to 
stop taking a pause. 
American 
workers 
and 
families 
couldn’t afford a pause for 4 months, 
and they certainly can’t afford to take 
a pause now. In fact, things have got-
ten worse. While Republicans sat on 
their hands, our country was facing 
and continues to face a grim reality. 
In the coming days, we are certain to 
pass the almost unthinkable milestone 
of 200,000 deaths from COVID–19. On 
March 29, when Dr. Fauci warned us

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5540 
September 10, 2020 
that America could reach this mile-
stone as an almost worst-case scenario, 
2,300 Americans had died. And because 
Donald Trump has provided no na-
tional leadership, Dr. Fauci’s warning 
will, more than sadly, soon come to 
pass. 
Over 6 million Americans have con-
tracted coronavirus. Tens of millions of 
Americans remain out of work. Mil-
lions of Americans have lost their 
healthcare. Colleges and universities 
have started their fall sessions with 
students back on campus and are expe-
riencing significant outbreaks. Mil-
lions of parents are facing the agoniz-
ing choice of sending their children to 
schools that aren’t safe or dealing with 
the challenge of distance learning and 
childcare needs. And State after State, 
long abandoned by the Trump adminis-
tration’s failure to lead during the pan-
demic, are left on their own to deal 
with billions in budget deficits as a re-
sult of the pandemic and to make dif-
ficult decisions about how to confront 
new outbreaks. 
In Hawaii, new cases have been rising 
since July. The severity of our out-
break, particularly on Oahu, led the 
mayor of the city and county of Hono-
lulu to issue a 2-week stay-at-home 
order on August 27. Yesterday, he ex-
tended this order for another 2 weeks. 
This order and the outbreak that pre-
ceded it offer a grim reminder that 
constant vigilance is necessary in the 
fight against COVID–19. It is a re-
minder that even States like Hawaii, 
which for months was lauded as a 
coronavirus success story, can become 
home to one of the fastest growing out-
breaks in the country. 
At the end of July, Hawaii had barely 
over 2,000 cases of COVID–19. Yester-
day, Hawaii crossed the grim milestone 
of 10,000 cases. Like in many other 
States, our outbreak has hit certain 
communities and populations the hard-
est. Our thriving, dynamic, and vital 
Pacific Islander community represents 
a mere 4 percent of our population but 
nearly one-third of our total cases. 
More than a dozen long-term care 
homes across our State are experi-
encing significant outbreaks that put 
our kupuna—our seniors—at height-
ened risk. 
The Oahu Community Correctional 
Center has seen the 299 inmates and 76 
staff members infected with COVID–19. 
The rising caseload on Oahu is putting 
pressure on Hawaii’s already under-
staffed medical system, where existing 
provider shortages are straining the ca-
pacity of our hospitals. 
Although Hawaii’s outbreak is cen-
tered on Oahu, we are seeing troubling 
signs on the Neighbor Islands, as well, 
with serious outbreaks at the Yuko 
Okutsu State Veterans Home in Hilo 
and the Maui Memorial Medical Center 
in Kahului. 
As we analyze and assess what is hap-
pening in Hawaii, the most important 
thing our State can do is learn from 
our experience and not to repeat the 
same mistakes. We have to explain 
things clearly and plainly, and we have 
to be accountable and transparent in 
our decision making. 
Our States certainly should have 
done a better job conducting outreach 
to at-risk communities, expanding our 
testing capacity, developing an effec-
tive contact tracing system, and estab-
lishing a clearer chain of command. 
But we don’t have the luxury of simply 
pointing fingers, assigning blame, and 
moving on. In other words, we cannot 
be like the President. 
Instead, we need to work together to 
get our outbreak under control and 
support the hundreds of thousands of 
Hawaii residents who have suffered 
from this unprecedented public health 
and economic crisis. 
The Senate must do its part by pass-
ing a real comprehensive COVID relief 
bill that would help States like Hawaii 
confront their outbreaks and help the 
millions of Americans who are suf-
fering right now. While the majority 
leader struggles to unite his caucus 
even around an emaciated, weak bill, 
like the one we voted on today, Demo-
crats are united behind passing the He-
roes Act because that bill’s scope 
matches the urgency and severity of 
this moment. 
I certainly understand and appreciate 
the need to negotiate and compromise 
to get something done, but we cannot 
lose sight of whom we are fighting for. 
Unlike the majority leader and Senate 
Republicans, who are fighting tooth 
and nail for corporate interests in the 
next COVID bill, I am fighting for the 
workers, families, and small businesses 
that are getting screwed. 
I am fighting for Hawaii’s small busi-
ness owners, like Laura Andersland, 
who runs Salty Wahine on Kauai. 
Laura is one of the favorites on the 
Hill, where many of my colleagues, in-
cluding those on the other side of the 
aisle, line up to sample Salty Wahine’s 
Hawaiian salts. Laura’s products are 
incredible, and her success over the 
years reflects the hard work she has 
put into building and growing her busi-
ness. But Laura and Salty Wahine have 
been devastated by the pandemic. Al-
though she was able to take advantage 
of past relief programs that we passed, 
Laura is struggling. She needs more 
help right now to pay the rent and re-
hire her employees. 
Alongside congressional Democrats, I 
am fighting for hundreds of billions in 
new assistance for small businesses 
like Laura’s. I am fighting for the 
homeowners and renters who have lost 
their jobs and are terrified to think of 
what might happen to them if the Fed-
eral protections that have prevented 
their foreclosure or evictions expire. 
I am grateful that organizations like 
the Legal Aid Society of Hawaii are 
stepping in to help people worried that 
they will lose their homes. Legal Aid’s 
executive 
director 
Nalani 
Fujimori 
Kaina told me that doing this work 
during a pandemic is like playing 3D 
chess on a Tilt-A-Whirl. In other 
words, it is mighty hard. 
The Senate needs to step up and pro-
vide the $100 billion-plus in housing 
and rental assistance needed to make a 
dent in this crisis. I am fighting for 
parents, teachers, and students who are 
struggling to adapt to the new normal 
of hybrid and distance learning: grand-
mothers, like a retired educator I 
spoke with last week—she is concerned 
about learning loss and her 5-year-old 
grandson struggling to sit and learn, 
sitting behind a computer screen for 
hours a day; women like the restaurant 
owner of Kauai I spoke with—she is 
worried about how to balance running 
her struggling business with tutoring 
her high school-age children; and the 
many students I have spoken with over 
the past few months—they are strug-
gling with learning loss, finding a quiet 
place to study from home, hunting 
down reliable internet at Starbucks, or 
having trouble concentrating—all be-
cause Republican Senators can’t get 
their acts together. 
We need to increase our support for 
public schools so they can create safer 
environments for students once they 
are back in school. We can do this by 
investing billions of dollars to help 
States get their outbreaks under con-
trol through testing and contact trac-
ing so we can get our kids back to 
school safely. The operative word is 
‘‘safely.’’ We all want our kids to go 
back to school. They need to go back in 
a safe environment. 
The bill our Republican colleagues 
offered today was anemic and weak, at 
best. It does more to help their cor-
porate benefactors than to address the 
pain so many Americans are feeling 
right now. 
After today’s vote, I am left won-
dering: How much more pain do the 
American people have to endure before 
Senate Republicans get serious and 
act? How many more Americans have 
to die? How many more Americans 
have to lose their jobs? How many 
more businesses have to close? How 
many more children have to go hungry 
during this pandemic? How many more 
people have to lose their health insur-
ance? The list goes on. 
I say to the majority leader: What is 
it going to take for you to finally do 
your job? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

S. RES. 685 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my support for my 
colleague Senator DUCKWORTH’s resolu-
tion honoring the service and sacrifices 
of members of the U.S. Armed Forces 
and our veterans. The resolution right-
ly criticizes President Trump for a se-
ries of statements and actions which

S5541 
September 10, 2020 
have denigrated our men and women in 
uniform, our veterans, and our institu-
tions. 
Service and sacrifice run deep among 
my constituents in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia. With 130,000 Active-Duty 
members living in Virginia, the Com-
monwealth has one of the highest pop-
ulations of military personnel in the 
Nation. Virginia is home to more than 
700,000 veterans, men and women who 
have displayed the highest level of self-
less service while defending this coun-
try and who have endured hardship and 
have put country above self. 
I am proud to call these American 
heroes my constituents, as well as my 
neighbors, and I am humbled to rep-
resent and serve them in Congress. I 
am thankful to them for protecting 
this great country. 
President Trump, though, again and 
again, has made disrespectful remarks 
about servicemembers, veterans, and 
military leaders despite being Com-
mander in Chief. His name-calling and 
disdain for the value of service is divi-
sive and dangerous. 
Remember 
how 
President 
Trump 
ridiculed the Gold Star parents of 
Army CPT Humayun Khan, who died in 
June 2004 from an IED in Iraq. Mr. and 
Mrs. Khan are residents of Virginia. 
Remember his comments questioning 
whether Senator John McCain should 
be called a hero and remember his re-
cent comments, even after the reports 
of his comments in The Atlantic arti-
cle came out—his recent comments 
that our top officials at DOD want to 
continue fighting wars to make defense 
contractors happy. 
Whether it is pardoning and excusing 
those in uniform who commit crimes or 
not standing up to President Putin in 
defense of our troops when reports 
emerged that bounties have been of-
fered for killing members of our Armed 
forces, whether it is deploying our 
military in response to peaceful pro-
tests, threatening to politicalize and 
divide our military from civilian soci-
ety, the President, on each of these oc-
casions, is on the wrong side of hon-
oring our servicemembers. These ac-
tions and statements are an affront to 
everyone who serves or has served. 
They are unacceptable and un-Presi-
dential. 
Instead, let’s stay focused on what 
matters in this country. Let’s stay 
united. We need to ensure that we are 
expressing each and every day how 
thankful we are to those who serve for 
protecting the freedoms we hold dear. 
I want to thank Senator DUCKWORTH 
for the introduction of this resolution 
and, more so, I thank her for her dedi-
cated and exemplary military service 
to our country. 
It is my hope that all my colleagues 
in the Senate will recognize the mis-
takes made by our Commander in Chief 
when addressing the heroes of our mili-
tary and our Nation’s veterans. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
the world today is in the clutches of a 
pandemic disease that touches directly 
or indirectly pretty much every human 
being on the face of the planet. It is 
costing us in lives, in money, and in 
immeasurable human pain. 
It didn’t have to be this way. We 
could have been better prepared. Presi-
dent Trump was left a detailed play-
book from his predecessor, but he ig-
nored it. Trump did away with key 
safety systems like the National Secu-
rity Council’s pandemic response unit. 
Once the pandemic struck, Trump and 
his team assured us it would all go 
away in time—no urgency. 
It is a cautionary tale, it is a lesson, 
and it brings me today for the 270th 
time to call this Chamber to action on 
the issue of climate change. We cannot 
wait flat-footed for the next foresee-
able crisis to engulf us. Climate change 
is a foreseeable crisis. It was indeed a 
foreseen crisis—indeed, even foreseen 
by Big Oil—and it is an actual crisis 
right now. It is a crisis we maybe can 
manage if we act swiftly and deci-
sively, but if we fail to heed the warn-
ings our natural world is screaming at 
us, we will be lost. 
The fossil fuel industry runs a mas-
sive dark-money influence campaign to 
foment fake uncertainty about climate 
change, but the evidence—the evi-
dence—is overwhelming. We see cli-
mate effects in harsher wildfires, more 
frequent and intense storms, and more 
extreme heat waves. Mother Nature’s 
warnings grow clearer and louder every 
day. It is the ocean—the ocean—that 
signals some of the strongest warnings. 
The changes in our marine world are 
clear. Oceans are acidifying, oceans are 
warming, and oceans are rising against 
our shores. These changes are meas-
ured; they are not hypotheticals. They 
are measured with thermometers, with 
tide gauges, with simple pH tests. 
The tide gauges in Rhode Island don’t 
lie about sea level rise. Sea levels are 
up nearly a foot over the last century. 
In other areas of the globe, sea levels 
have risen even higher, and the rate of 
sea level rise is accelerating. 
We just learned more about Green-
land, whose melting ice sheet is an 
enormous contributor to global sea 
level rise. Over a fifth of global sea 
level rise since 2005 is Greenland ice 
melt. Last month, Greenland broke its 
previous record for ice loss. Again, the 
pace of the melting is accelerating. 
A team at Ohio State University just 
released a new study of the Greenland 
ice sheet based on 4 years of satellite 
data. The data showed that Greenland 
poured an average of 300 billion tons of 
melted glacier into our oceans every 
year across that period. But over the 
last two decades, that rate of melting— 
that glacial collapse, as the scientists 
put it—is up sevenfold from the ear-
liest years they studied. The rate is ac-
celerating. That means that Green-
land’s ice is now melting so quickly 
that winter snows that typically re-
plenish these glaciers won’t keep up. 
We are now on course for the entire 
Greenland ice sheet to disappear. 
‘‘Glacial retreat has knocked the dy-
namics of the whole ice sheet into a 
constant state of loss,’’ said Ohio 
State’s Ian Howat. 
Greenland’s glacial collapse portends 
dramatic and destructive sea level rise. 
Scientists 
reckon 
Greenland 
holds 
enough water to raise sea levels by 
about 20 feet. That puts my capital 
city of Providence and Florida’s major 
cities underwater. Antarctica holds 
enough ice to melt and raise sea water 
levels 60 feet. So it is not hard to see 
the problem—total coastal inundation. 
But well before total coastal inunda-
tion, coastal property values would 
plummet. Financial experts have been 
following the sea level economic threat 
for years because a coastal property 
values crash would radiate quickly 
through the rest of the economy. That 
crash creates what financial experts 
call systemic risk—a threat to the en-
tire economic system. In 2016, the top 
economists for mortgage giant Freddie 
Mac—which 
is 
no 
liberal 
environ-
mental group—warned that climate- 
driven flooding along U.S. coasts will 
lead to economic losses ‘‘greater . . . 
than those experienced in the housing 
crisis and Great Recession.’’ 
It is not just Rhode Island. Pulitzer 
Prize-winning outdoors reporter Bob 
Marshall has warned of losing essen-
tially all of Louisiana south of I–10. He 
said: ‘‘Voting for congressmen who op-
pose emissions regulations is a vote to 
drown this coast.’’ 
It is not even just coasts. A new 
study out of the University of Arkan-
sas shows sea level rise could push in-
land water tables higher, flooding com-
munities many miles from the sea. We 
already see this phenomenon in inland 
Florida. 
Last, there is really no dispute about 
the data. A tide gauge is a simple and 
ancient measure. But we see this and 
do nothing. 
Another alarm bell is ringing in the 
ocean, and that is temperature. Oceans 
are warming, and the warming is accel-
erating. The rate of ocean warming has 
already doubled, and the ocean is pro-
jected to absorb up to five to seven 
times more heat by 2100. Why? Because 
the oceans regulate our planet’s tem-
perature 
by 
absorbing 
atmospheric 
heat. The oceans indeed have absorbed 
over 90 percent of the excess atmos-
pheric heat fossil fuels have caused. If 
you think things are bad right now, we 
are actually only experiencing 10 per-
cent of the global warming we have 
caused. The other 90 percent has been 
absorbed by the ocean. It is a lot of 
heat. By one example, our oceans are

warming at the rate of multiple Hiro-
shima explosions worth of heat per sec-
ond—per second. There is not a lot of 
dispute here either, unless you want to 
argue with a thermometer. 
Ocean warming displaces fisheries, 
disrupts ocean currents, destroys coral 
reefs, and depletes the oxygen levels 
and carrying capacity of the sea. These 
are the kinds of changes that usually 
transpire across geologic time. They 
are happening now. 
Ocean warming sends its dangers 
ashore because that ocean heat energy 
powers up storm systems. They power 
up into stronger storms, and they 
power up faster. We just watched Trop-
ical Storm Laura spin up into category 
4 Hurricane Laura in less than 24 
hours. As Bob Marshall, the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning Louisiana writer put it: 
‘‘High water temperature [is] the crys-
tal-meth of hurricane intensity.’’ 
Warmer 
seas 
power 
up 
stronger 
storms, and they power up more 
storms. The Atlantic has already gen-
erated a typical full year’s worth of 
storms, pumping out about 55 percent 
more energy than usual into tropical 
storms and hurricanes. This year deliv-
ered the earliest ever C-, E-, F-, G-, H- 
, I-, J-, K-, L-, and M-named storms— 
every single one, the earliest of its 
name. 
In 2019, 14 separate billion-dollar dis-
asters struck the United States, and 
the majority of them were hurricanes. 
In 2018 and 2019, Dorian, Florence, and 
Michael slammed into our coasts. Year 
2017 brought Harvey, the most signifi-
cant tropical cyclone rainfall event 
ever recorded; and Irma, the strongest 
storm ever recorded outside of the Gulf 
of Mexico and Caribbean, with sus-
tained winds reaching 185 miles per 
hour; and Hurricane Maria, killing 
nearly 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico 
and laying waste to the island. 
Ocean warming is altering basic oper-
ating systems of our planet. Physical 
systems are altered; biological systems 
are altered; basic features of the ocean 
are altered; and the change has just 
begun. Many of these changes are oce-
anic, but some come ashore. We need to 
buckle up. 
The third ocean alarm bell is acidifi-
cation. Oceans absorb not just 90 per-
cent of the excess heat; they absorb 
about 30 percent of the carbon pollu-
tion—the excess carbon dioxide from 
fossil fuel emissions, and they have 
sucked up a lot of excess carbon. Since 
the Industrial Revolution, oceans have 
absorbed about 525 billion tons of CO2— 
22 million tons per day. That added 
carbon dioxide chemically changes the 
ocean’s pH, making oceans more acid-
ic. 
It 
looks 
like 
the 
oceans 
are 
acidifying at their fastest rate in at 
least 50 million years. As with warming 
and sea level rise, the rate of acidifica-
tion is accelerating. Again, there is no 
real dispute; pH testing is pretty reli-
able stuff. 
A new Texas A&M study shows car-
bon dioxide levels rising at alarming 
rates in the Gulf of Mexico—bad news 
for shrimp, coral, and other marine life 
that are highly sensitive to acidity. 
Texas A&M warns of the acidification 
threat to the gulf’s commercial fish-
eries, worth roughly $1 billion per year. 
The Woods Hole Institute made star-
tling findings about acidification of 
coral 
reefs 
triggering 
a 
kind 
of 
osteoporosis for coral, hampering the 
organism’s ability to grow skeletons. 
Reefs, of course, are the nurseries of 
the sea. Without coral reefs, marine 
biodiversity plummets and our oceans 
become unrecognizable. 
The University of Alaska has an en-
tire ocean acidification research center 
because of the dangers to Alaskan fish-
eries. The lowly pteropod is a base spe-
cies along the northern Pacific coast. 
It is damaged in acidified seas, and no 
one quite knows what becomes of that 
ocean food chain when a foundation 
species like the pteropod collapses. We 
know it is not good. 
All of these warnings are stark. Our 
oceans are in crisis. Our natural world 
hurdles toward a point of no return. 
Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry 
keeps deploying lies and political influ-
ence in a carefully orchestrated covert 
operation run against our own govern-
ment. 
The fossil fuel industry’s menacing 
climate denial apparatus has captured 
one of America’s major political par-
ties. In the wake of Citizens United, 
fossil fuel dark money has so thor-
oughly corrupted American politics 
that Congress has lost an entire dec-
ade—the lost decade—to industry mis-
chief. Even today, we still fritter and 
dawdle. 
Eventually, we will see the full con-
tours of the covert operation the fossil 
fuel industry has run against us as if 
we were an enemy nation. One day will 
come a full accounting of this indus-
try’s wanton deception of the Amer-
ican people. One day we will see just 
how much money this industry paid for 
its malign influence and who accepted 
that money and denied the science and 
ignored the problem. History will judge 
those involved harshly, and deservedly 
so. It is a crime in progress against our 
own children and the world they will 
inhabit. 
After the lost decade of Citizens 
United, time is short to heed the warn-
ings of our oceans and end the fossil 
fuel pollution that threatens them. It 
is truly getting to be now or never.

REMEMBERING JIM THOMPSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1978, I 
was the Democratic nominee for Lieu-
tenant Governor of Illinois, running 
with Michael Bakalis, the Democratic 
nominee for governor. We squared off 
against a ticket headed by six-foot-six 
Governor Big Jim Thompson. Big Jim 
was 40 years old and a relatively new 
Governor, only elected 2 years earlier. 
Bakalis and I were underdogs, but we 
were hopeful. We shouldn’t have been. 
Our fate was sealed when Jim and 
Jayne were joined by their beautiful 
daughter Samantha right after Labor 
Day. Election day came, and we were 
clobbered. We found out what many 
Democrats would learn over the years. 
Big Jim was hard as hell to beat. Why? 
He may have campaigned as a partisan, 
but he governed in bipartisanship. His 
talent for working to get things done 
helped make him the longest serving 
Governor in Illinois history. 
Last month, Jim passed away. I was 
honored to call him a friend and, 
today, I would like to pay tribute to 
his life. 
James Robert Thompson, Jr. was 
born on the West Side of Chicago in 
1936. Jim was known to be shy but am-
bitious. He listed his ambition as 
‘‘President-Politician’’ in his yearbook. 
In one classmate’s yearbook, he wrote 
‘‘Jim Thompson, Pres. of U.S. 1984– 
1992.’’ 
Jim attended the University of Illi-
nois at its campus on Navy Pier in Chi-
cago. He transferred to Washington 
University in St. Louis in his junior 
year and attended law school at North-
western in 1959. 
In 1961, Jim worked for the Cook 
County State’s attorney and argued 
two cases before the United States Su-
preme Court. He also joined North-
western University Law School as an 
assistant professor. 
For 5 years, Jim taught at North-
western, inspiring many students to 
pursue criminal law. In 1969, he became 
the head of the criminal division of the 
U.S. Attorney’s office. As fate would 
have it, he was the lecturer on criminal 
procedure in my bar review course. In 
1971, 
President 
Richard 
Nixon 
ap-
pointed him to be the U.S. Attorney for 
the Northern District of Illinois. 
At the age of 35, Jim was a crusader 
against corruption in both parties, 
leading investigations against Chicago 
aldermen and Vice President Spiro 
Agnew. His efforts made him look like 
a political outsider—just what Illinois

was looking for in a Governor. Jim de-
cided to run for Governor in the 1976 
election. During that campaign, he 
married his wife Jayne. 
He won the gubernatorial race as the 
first candidate in the State ever to gar-
ner 3 million votes. Though he would 
have a close election in 1982, Big Jim 
never lost a race. 
As Governor, he accomplished a lot 
of good for the State of Illinois. He 
spurred the construction of more high-
ways than any other Governor. His 
‘‘Build Illinois’’ plan launched a $2.3 
billion infrastructure effort that helped 
turn the State into a national leader in 
economic development, historic preser-
vation, and environmental protection. 
There are too many projects to name 
that Jim championed through the 
State legislature. He helped bring 
about Navy Pier’s renovation, making 
it the State’s top tourist destination. 
When the Chicago White Sox were on 
the verge of leaving Chicago for Flor-
ida, he fought hard to keep them. Jim 
was working the votes well into the 
night, and the White Sox got their new 
stadium. He supported the legislation 
that paved the way for the Chicago 
Bulls’ arena, the United Center. 
When Republicans in the Illinois 
House sought to make Illinois a right- 
to-work State, Jim called local beer 
distributors in Springfield and had 
them set up on the lawn of the Gov-
ernor’s mansion, where he invited pro-
testing labor members to have a drink. 
The right-to-work legislation never 
passed. 
In 1989, Jim decided against running 
for a fifth term. He had guided the 
State through a recession and helped 
rebuild it. He made countless deals 
with people of both parties. Jim could 
have coasted on the reputation he had 
built, but he didn’t. He joined the law 
firm Winston & Strawn, and within 2 
years, he was chairman and had made 
the firm a powerhouse. Jim also con-
tinued to serve his country as he was 
part of the 9/11 Commission, he chaired 
the Illinois Sports Facilities Author-
ity, and he argued several cases before 
the Illinois Supreme Court. He retired 
in 2015. 
Jim Thompson never hesitated to 
work with the other side for a greater 
good. We were political adversaries, 
yet we also were personal friends. Sure, 
we disagreed on quite a bit, but we al-
ways worked together for the State of 
Illinois. 
Loretta 
and 
I 
send 
our 
thoughts and prayers to Jayne and 
their daughter Samantha.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for September 2020. 
This is my third scorekeeping report 
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2021 on May 4, 2020, 
as required by the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2019, BBA19. The report com-
pares current-law levels of spending 
and revenues with the amounts agreed 
to in BBA19. In the Senate, this infor-
mation is used to determine whether 
budgetary points of order lie against 
pending legislation. The Republican 
staff of the Budget Committee and the 
Congressional Budget Office prepared 
this report pursuant to section 308(b) of 
the Congressional Budget Act. The in-
formation included in this report is 
current through September 4, 2020. 
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on July 23, 2020, two measures 
with significant enforceable budgetary 
effects have been enacted. The first 
measure, the Great American Outdoors 
Act, P.L. 116–152, established a Na-
tional Parks and Public Land Legacy 
Restoration Fund to address deferred 
maintenance on Federal lands and pro-
vided $900 million per year in perma-
nent, mandatory funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. CBO es-
timated this legislation, which passed 
the Senate by a vote of 73–25, would in-
crease the deficit by $17.3 billion over 
the fiscal year 2021–2030 period. The 
second measure, the Ryan Kules and 
Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing 
Improvement Act of 2019, P.L. 116–154, 
modified certain veteran housing and 
education benefits. CBO estimated that 
this legislation would increase direct 
spending in the near term but would 
ultimately be offset over the fiscal 
year 2020–2030 window. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared Tables A–G. 
Table A provides the amount by 
which each Senate authorizing com-
mittee exceeds or falls below its alloca-
tions for budget authority and outlays 
under the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal 
year 2021 deemed budget resolutions. 
This information is used for enforcing 
committee allocations pursuant to sec-
tion 302 of the CBA. Compliance re-
mains substantively unchanged since 
my last report, with the exception of 
the Energy and Natural Resources and 
Veterans’ Affairs Committees. The en-
actment of the Great American Out-
doors Act has caused significant viola-
tions of ENR’s allocations provided in 
the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget. En-
actment of P.L. 116–154 caused viola-
tions in the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal 
year 2021 windows for the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, which were then miti-
gated by deficit reduction in the out- 
years. 
Tables B–G, which track spending re-
lated to the appropriations process, re-
main unchanged from my last report. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I 
am submitting CBO tables which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
Because legislation can still be en-
acted that would have an effect on fis-
cal year 2020, CBO provided spending 
and revenue reports for both fiscal year 
2020 and fiscal year 2021. This informa-
tion is used to enforce aggregate spend-
ing levels in budget resolutions under 
CBA section 311. CBO’s estimates show 
that current levels of spending for fis-
cal year 2020 exceed amounts in last 
year’s budget resolution by $68.6 billion 
in budget authority and $55.1 billion in 
outlays 2020—Tables 1–2. Revenues are 
$114.8 billion below the revenue floor. 
Additionally, Social Security outlays 
are at the levels assumed for 2020, 
while Social Security revenues are $16 
million above the levels assumed in 
budget. 
For fiscal year 2021, the current law 
levels are $1,177.1 billion and $667.5 bil-
lion in budget authority and outlays, 
respectively, below allowable levels— 
2021, Tables 1–2. This spending room 
will be spent down as regular appro-
priations bills are enacted for fiscal 
year 2021. Revenues and Social Secu-
rity levels are at the levels assumed by 
the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget for 
this budget year. Over the fiscal year 
2021–2025 and 2021–2030 period, revenues 
are $5 million and $28 million, respec-
tively, greater than revenue levels as-
sumed in the deemed budget resolu-
tion. 
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate Pay- 
As-You-Go—PAYGO—rule—2021, Table 
3. This rule is enforced under section 
4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The 
Senate PAYGO scorecard currently 
shows enacted deficit increases in 
every enforceable window. The largest 
debit on the scorecard is $17.3 billion 
over the fiscal year 2020–2030 period. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 4, 2020. No 
points of order have been raised since 
my July report. 
An years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, September 10, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE ENZI, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2021 budget and is current 
through September 4, 2020. This report is 
submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of 
section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, 
as amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
May 4, 2020, pursuant to section 205 of the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116– 
37). 
Since our last current level dated July 23, 
2020, the Congress has cleared and the Presi-
dent has signed the following legislation 
that has significant effects on budget au-
thority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal year 
2021: Great American Outdoors Act (Public 
Law 116–152); and The Ryan Kules and Paul 
Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improve-
ment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–154). 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director.

the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $646 million in estimated prior outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020, by the Chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on the Budget pursuant to section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not in-
clude those items. 
c Current level excludes budgetary effects designated as an emergency pursuant to section 4112 of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018. As a result, this report excludes 
$68,534 million in budget authority, $72,977 million in outlays, and all revenue effects stemming from legislation enacted before the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget published aggregate spending and revenues for fiscal 
year 2021 in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020. It also excludes the budgetary effects of other laws, enacted this session, which were designated as emergency requirements in accordance with section 4112 of H. Con. Res 71.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION 
DAY 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in honor 
of National POW/MIA Recognition Day 
this September 18, 2020, I join in raising 
awareness about the more than 81,900 
Americans the Defense POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency, DPAA, reports re-
main missing from World War II, the 
Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold 
War, the Gulf wars and other conflicts. 
I also commend the members of the 
POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of 
Pocatello, ID, and other similar groups 
that keep a spotlight on the immense 
service of our American servicemem-
bers and the ongoing need to bring 
them all home. 
My heart goes out to the American 
families who have carried on through 
years, and even decades, waiting for 
answers to their questions. Those who 
see a loved one off to war but long after 
the war’s end still await that loved 
one’s return shoulder our country’s 
sorrow. May all servicemembers’ fami-
lies get the resolution of knowing their 
lost family members have been re-
turned to the country they served so 
admirably. 
Thank you to those who work for and 
assist the DPAA and related efforts to 
get needed answers and bring all Amer-
ican servicemembers home. Piecing to-
gether 
the 
circumstances, 
where-
abouts, and lives of those lost cannot 
be easy, especially during a global pan-
demic, but bringing them home is crit-
ical to honoring their service. The 
DPAA reports that 75 percent of lost 
Americans are located in the Indo-Pa-
cific, and more than 41,000 of the miss-
ing are presumed lost at sea. Despite 
the difficulty, the agency announced 
accounting for more than 70 missing 
servicemembers since March. Their lo-
cations included Germany, Laos, North 
Korea, Papua, Pearl Harbor, the Phil-
ippines, 
Romania, 
Saipan, 
South 
Korea, and Tarawa. 
To help with this effort, I have sup-
ported and introduced the bipartisan 
Bring Our Heroes Home Act, which 
would address obstacles preventing 
families and caseworkers from access-
ing the records needed for recovery ef-
forts by putting one entity in charge of 
prioritizing and facilitating the declas-
sification of records related to missing 
servicemembers. We cannot let up in 
bringing home all our Nation’s heroes, 
including the 359 Idahoans, who have 
yet to be returned. Those who have 
served our Nation deserve no less than 
to rest at home, and we cannot rest 
until they do.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO VIRGIL GUST 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Virgil Gust of Sweet Grass County for 
his commitment to keeping entrepre-
neurial spirits high during these chal-
lenging times. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has dis-
rupted the lives of all Montanans and 
has proven to be a significant challenge 
for small business owners. Over the 
past several months, local business 
owners have faced tremendous finan-
cial hardships as a result of the pan-
demic, making it difficult to hold on to 
hope. 
Virgil Gust, the founder of Gusts of 
Big Timber, opened the store in 1947 
and has worked there for over 70 years. 
Virgil still approaches his work with 
the same enthusiasm and dedication as 
he did at the beginning of his career. 
It is my honor to recognize Virgil for 
fostering the values of positivity and 
hard work in his community during 
these difficult times. As both a WWII 
veteran and a small business owner, 
Virgil brings a unique entrepreneurial 
perspective to his community and is a 
truly exceptional role model to Mon-
tanans from all walks of life.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 4556. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, 
acting through the Director of the In-
dian Health Service, to acquire private 
land to facilitate access to the Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, 
California, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Indian Affairs. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am pleased to introduce a bill 
to facilitate better access to the Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter, located in Hemet, CA, is a health 
center run by the Indian Health Serv-
ice. It is the only currently operating 
center in the State of California that 
provides culturally-sensitive substance 
use disorder treatment to indigenous 
youth. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter serves an important role to the re-
gional Native American community. 
The 
facility 
not 
only 
provides 
healthcare but also academic support, 
family therapy, and an individualized 
treatment plan to support the healing 
and long-term recovery of youth en-
rolled at the center. 
Despite the center’s important work, 
the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center 
is only accessible by a dirt road. Lack 
of a paved road limits access to the 
center during California’s extreme wet 
and dry seasons. The dirt road fre-
quently cracks or floods during these 
times and creates significant chal-
lenges to those receiving healthcare. 
Private landowners are supportive of 
selling their land to allow the Indian 
Health Service to pave an access road, 
but the agency does not currently have 
the authority to do so. It is appropriate 
we provide for safe and dignified access 
to the center, and I am pleased to in-
troduce legislation that will solve this 
problem. 
The bill would authorize the Director 
of the Indian Health Service to pur-
chase land from willing sellers and con-
struct a paved road to improve access 
to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness 
Center. After construction, Riverside 
County would own and maintain the 
road. 
This effort includes widespread, bi-
partisan support. An identical, bipar-
tisan bill introduced by Representative 
RAUL RUIZ passed the House of Rep-
resentatives as part of a larger package 
just last month. Representative RUIZ’s 
bill is cosponsored by Representatives 
KEN
CALVERT, PETE
AGUILAR, PAUL 
COOK, DOUG LAMALFA, NANNETTE DIAZ 
BARRAGA´ N, TONY CA´ RDENAS, and JOSH 
HARDER. This legislation also has the 
support of local stakeholders, including 
Riverside County, and organizations 
like the California Rural Indian Health 
Board. 
The bill will provide safe access to 
the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter, ensuring indigenous youth can re-
ceive healthcare in a supportive and 
culturally-sensitive 
environment. 
American Indian and Alaskan Native 
youth report 14.9 percent rate of sub-
stance dependence or abuse, furthering 
underscoring the need to guarantee the 
accessibility 
to 
facilities 
like 
the 
Desert Sage Wellness Center. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass this legislation.

Whereas lobstering has served as an eco-
nomic engine and family tradition in the 
United States for centuries; 
Whereas thousands of families in the

vesters begin fishing as children and stay in

one of the most sustainable fisheries in the 
world; 
Whereas, throughout history, Presidents of

Whereas 
lobster 
is 
continually 
incor-
porated into trending recipes such as pho, 
gnocchi, hummus, and fried lobster and waf-
fles; 
Whereas the peak of the lobstering season

(2) REVIEW.—The Administrator may— 
(A) review the exchange values listed in 
the table contained in paragraph (1) on a 
periodic basis; and 
(B) subject to notice and opportunity for 
public comment, adjust the exchange values 
solely on the basis of— 
(i) publicly available, peer-reviewed sci-
entific data; and 
(ii) other information consistent with 
widely used or commonly accepted existing 
exchange values. 
(3) OTHER REGULATED SUBSTANCES.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to notice and op-
portunity for public comment, the Adminis-
trator may designate a substance not in-
cluded in the table contained in paragraph 
(1) as a regulated substance if— 
(i) the substance— 
(I) is a chemical substance that is a satu-
rated hydrofluorocarbon; and 
(II) has an exchange value, as determined 
by the Administrator in accordance with the 
basis described in paragraph (2)(B), of great-
er than 53; and 
(ii) the designation of the substance as a 
regulated substance would be consistent 
with the purposes of this section. 
(B) SAVINGS
PROVISION.—Nothing in this 
paragraph authorizes the Administrator to 
designate as a regulated substance a blend of 
substances 
that 
includes 
a 
saturated 
hydrofluorocarbon for purposes of phasing 
down production or consumption of regu-
lated substances under subsection (e), even if 
the saturated hydrofluorocarbon is, or may 
be, designated as a regulated substance. 
(d) MONITORING
AND REPORTING REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
(1) PRODUCTION, IMPORT, AND EXPORT LEVEL

port under subparagraph (A) shall not be re-
quired from a person if the person— 
(I) permanently ceases production, impor-
tation, 
exportation, 
destruction, 
trans-
formation, use as a process agent, or rec-
lamation of all regulated substances; and 
(II) notifies the Administrator in writing 
that the requirement under subclause (I) has 
been met. 
(iii) BASELINE PERIOD.—Each report under 
subparagraph (A) shall include, as applica-
ble, the information described in that sub-
paragraph for the baseline period of calendar 
years 2011 through 2013.

lated 
substances 
in 
the 
United 
States 
through an allowance allocation and trading 
program in accordance with this section; and 
(B) phasing down the consumption of regu-
lated 
substances 
in 
the 
United 
States 
through an allowance allocation and trading 
program in accordance with the schedule 
under paragraph (2)(C) (subject to the same 
exceptions and other requirements as are ap-
plicable to the phase-down of production of 
regulated substances under this section). 
(4) EXCEPTIONS; ESSENTIAL USES.— 
(A) FEEDSTOCKS AND PROCESS AGENTS.—Ex-
cept for the reporting requirements de-
scribed in subsection (d)(1), this section does 
not apply to— 
(i) a regulated substance that is used and 
entirely consumed (except for trace quan-
tities) in the manufacture of another chem-
ical; or 
(ii) a regulated substance that is used and 
not entirely consumed in the manufacture of 
another chemical, if the remaining amounts

destroyed. 
(B) ESSENTIAL USES.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act and subject to para-
graphs (2) and (3) and clauses (ii) and (iii), 
the Administrator may, after considering 
technical 
achievability, 
commercial 
de-
mands, safety, and other relevant factors, in-
cluding overall economic costs and environ-
mental 
impacts 
compared 
to 
historical 
trends, allocate a quantity of allowances for 
a period of not more than 5 years for the pro-
duction and consumption of a regulated sub-
stance exclusively for the use of the regu-
lated substance in an application, if— 
(I) no safe or technically achievable sub-
stitute will be available during the applica-
ble period for that application; and 
(II) the supply of the regulated substance 
that manufacturers or users of the regulated 
substance for that application are capable of 
securing from chemical manufacturers, as 
authorized under paragraph (2)(A), including 
any quantities of a regulated substance 
available from reclaiming, prior production, 
or prior import, is insufficient to accommo-
date the application. 
(ii) PETITION.—If the Administrator re-
ceives a petition requesting the designation 
of an application as an essential use under 
clause (i), the Administrator shall— 
(I) not later than 180 days after the date on 
which the Administrator receives the peti-
tion— 
(aa) make the complete petition available 
to the public; and 
(bb) when making the petition available to 
the public under item (aa), propose and seek 
public comment on— 
(AA) a determination of whether to des-
ignate the application as an essential use; 
and 
(BB) if the Administrator proposes to des-
ignate the application as an essential use, 
making the requisite allocation of allow-
ances; and 
(II) not later than 270 days after the date 
on which the Administrator receives the pe-
tition, take final action on the petition. 
(iii) LIMITATION.—A person receiving an al-
location under clause (i) or (iv) or as a result 
of a petition granted under clause (ii) may 
not produce or consume a quantity of regu-
lated substances that, considering the re-
spective exchange values of the regulated 
substances, exceeds the number of allow-
ances issued under paragraphs (2) and (3) 
that are held by that person. 
(iv) MANDATORY ALLOCATIONS.— 
(I) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding clause (i) 
and subject to clause (iii) and paragraphs (2) 
and (3), for the 5-year period beginning on 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Ad-
ministrator shall allocate the full quantity 
of allowances necessary, based on projected, 
current, and historical trends, for the pro-
duction or consumption of a regulated sub-
stance for the exclusive use of the regulated 
substance in an application solely for— 
(aa) a propellant in metered-dose inhalers; 
(bb) defense sprays; 
(cc) structural composite preformed poly-

(I) IN GENERAL.—For each essential use ap-
plication receiving an allocation of allow-
ances under clause (i) or (iv), the Adminis-
trator shall review the availability of sub-
stitutes, including any quantities of the reg-
ulated substance available from reclaiming 
or prior production, not less frequently than 
once every 5 years. 
(II) EXTENSION.—If, pursuant to a review 
under subclause (I), the Administrator deter-
mines, subject to notice and opportunity for 
public comment, that the requirements de-
scribed in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) 
are met, the Administrator shall authorize 
the production or consumption, as applica-
ble, of any regulated substance used in the 
application for renewable periods of not 
more than 5 years for exclusive use in the ap-
plication. 
(5) 
DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURING.—Notwith-
standing paragraph (2)(A)(i), the Adminis-
trator may authorize a person to produce a 
regulated substance in excess of the number 
of production allowances held by that per-
son, subject to the conditions that— 
(A) the authorization is— 
(i) for a renewable period of not more than 
5 years; and 
(ii) subject to notice and opportunity for 
public comment; and

mands, safety, and other relevant factors, in-
cluding the quantities of regulated sub-
stances available from reclaiming, prior pro-
duction, or prior import, by January 1, 2025 
(for the first review), by January 1, 2030 (for 
the second review), and at least once every 5 
years thereafter. 
(B) PUBLIC
AVAILABILITY.—The Adminis-
trator shall make the results of a review 
conducted under subparagraph (A) publicly 
available. 
(6) SAVINGS
PROVISION.—Nothing in this 
subsection authorizes the Administrator to

that governs the transfer of allowances for 
the production of regulated substances under 
subsection (e)(3)(A) that uses— 
(A) the applicable exchange values de-
scribed in the table contained in subsection 
(c)(1); or 
(B) the exchange value described in the 
rule designating the substance as a regulated 
substance under subsection (c)(3). 
(2) REQUIREMENTS.—The final rule promul-
gated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall— 
(A) ensure that the transfers under this 
subsection will result in greater total reduc-
tions in the production of regulated sub-
stances in each year than would occur during 
the year in the absence of the transfers; 
(B) permit 2 or more persons to transfer 
production allowances if the transferor of 
the allowances will be subject, under the 
final rule, to an enforceable and quantifiable 
reduction in annual production that— 
(i) exceeds the reduction otherwise applica-
ble to the transferor under this section; 
(ii) exceeds the quantity of production rep-
resented by the production allowances trans-
ferred to the transferee; and 
(iii) would not have occurred in the ab-
sence of the transaction; and 
(C) provide for the trading of consumption 
allowances in the same manner as is applica-
ble under this subsection to the trading of 
production allowances.

MANAGEMENT
OF
REGULATED
SUB-
STANCES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—For purposes of maxi-
mizing reclaiming and minimizing the re-
lease of a regulated substance from equip-
ment and ensuring the safety of technicians 
and consumers, the Administrator shall pro-
mulgate regulations to control, where appro-
priate, any practice, process, or activity re-
garding the servicing, repair, disposal, or in-
stallation of equipment (including requiring, 
where appropriate, that any such servicing, 
repair, disposal, or installation be performed 
by a trained technician meeting minimum 
standards, as determined by the Adminis-
trator) that involves— 
(A) a regulated substance; 
(B) a substitute for a regulated substance; 
(C) the reclaiming of a regulated substance 
used as a refrigerant; or 
(D) the reclaiming of a substitute for a reg-
ulated substance used as a refrigerant. 
(2) RECLAIMING.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out this sec-
tion, the Administrator shall consider the 
use of authority available to the Adminis-
trator under this section to increase oppor-
tunities for the reclaiming of regulated sub-
stances used as refrigerants. 
(B) RECOVERY.—A regulated substance used 
as a refrigerant that is recovered shall be re-
claimed before the regulated substance is 
sold or transferred to a new owner, except 
where the recovered regulated substance is 
sold or transferred to a new owner solely for 
the purposes of being reclaimed or destroyed. 
(3) COORDINATION.—In promulgating regula-
tions to carry out this subsection, the Ad-
ministrator may coordinate those regula-
tions with any other regulations promul-
gated by the Administrator that involve— 
(A) the same or a similar practice, process, 
or activity regarding the servicing, repair, 
disposal, or installation of equipment; or 
(B) reclaiming. 
(4) INAPPLICABILITY.—No regulation pro-
mulgated pursuant to this subsection shall 
apply to a regulated substance or a sub-
stitute for a regulated substance that is con-

evant publicly available and peer-reviewed 
scientific data;

revises the number of allowances for produc-
tion under subsection (e)(2), as applicable, 
for the United States such that the aggre-
gate national production of the regulated 
substance to be traded under the revised pro-
duction limits is equal to the least of— 
(i) the maximum production level per-
mitted for the applicable regulated sub-
stance in the year of the transfer under this 
section, 
less 
the 
production 
allowances 
transferred; 
(ii) the maximum production level per-
mitted for the applicable regulated sub-
stances in the transfer year under applicable 
law, less the production allowances trans-
ferred; and

duction level of the applicable regulated sub-
stances for the 3-year period ending on the 
date of the transfer, less the production al-
lowances transferred; or 
(B) from a person in a foreign country if, at 
the time of the trade or transfer, the Admin-

provided with respect to transfers by a per-
son in United States under this subsection. 
(3) EFFECT
OF
TRANSFERS

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today 
as a result of the horrific pandemic and 
economic 
meltdown, 
the 
American 
working class is hurting in a way that 
they have not been hurting since the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. Tens of 
millions of our fellow citizens have lost 
their jobs. They have lost their in-
comes. They have lost their health in-
surance. They have depleted their life 
savings. They cannot afford to pay 
rent. They cannot afford to put food on 
the table. And they are scared to death 
that any day now they are going to get 
a knock on the door from a sheriff, 
evicting them from their homes and 
throwing them and their belongings 
out on the street. 
This is the United States of America, 
the richest country in the history of 
the world. None of us—no man, woman, 
or child—should go hungry. None of us 
should have to live in fear of becoming 
homeless, and no one should be denied 
the healthcare that they need—espe-
cially during the worst public health 
crisis in 100 years. But that is precisely 
what is going on all over our country 
as we speak this evening. 
Just the other day, National Public 
Radio, NPR, released a survey on the 
unprecedented economic suffering fac-
ing the American people. That should 
shock everyone in the U.S. Senate and 
in our Nation. And here is what that 
survey found: 46 percent of Ameri-
cans—over 150 million people—are now 
experiencing serious financial prob-
lems. 
Forty-one percent of Americans— 
over 134 million people—have used up 
all or most of their savings. Their sav-
ings accounts are now depleted. Thirty- 
three percent of American families 
have had someone in their household 
who has either lost a job, lost a busi-
ness, or has been furloughed during the 
pandemic. This is an unprecedented 
moment in American history, and the 
Senate needs to take unprecedented ac-
tion to improve the lives of the Amer-
ican people. 
Yet in the midst of all of this pain 
and suffering, what has the Repub-
lican-led Senate done over the last 5 
months to address the economic con-
cerns of the American people? The an-
swer is nothing except pass a $740 bil-
lion budget for the bloated Pentagon 
and take an extended vacation. That is 
not something that anybody in the 
Senate should be proud of. 
The Senate is now back in session. 
Senate Republicans have introduced a 
so-called skinny relief bill that is to-
tally inadequate in terms of addressing 
the crisis we are facing today. The Sen-
ate Republican bill provides nothing 
for rent, nothing for mortgages, noth-
ing for food, nothing for hazard pay, 
nothing for healthcare, nothing for 
public transportation, and nothing to 
prevent the mass layoffs of teachers, 
nurses, firefighters, and construction 
workers that will take place in cities 
and States as cities and States struggle 
economically. 
In other words, the same Republicans 
who had no problem voting for a tril-
lion-dollar tax break for the top 1 per-
cent large corporations 2 years ago are 
now telling 40 million Americans who 
are struggling to pay for housing that 
we cannot afford to help them pay 
their rent or mortgage. The same Re-
publicans who just voted to provide 
$740 billion for the Pentagon and the 
military industrial complex to wage 
endless wars are now telling 30 million 
workers who lost their jobs that we 
cannot afford to continue the $600-a- 
week supplement they were receiving 
in unemployment benefits. The same 
Republicans who slipped $135 billion 
tax breaks for multimillionaires and 
billionaires in the last coronavirus re-
lief package are now telling 29 million 
Americans who do not have enough 
food to eat that we cannot afford to 
help them feed their families. 
But if you are an executive in the 
coal industry, you are in luck. The Re-
publican Senate bill provides your in-
dustry with $161 million in corporate 
welfare. That is right. The Republican 
Senate bill provides no money for 
working families to feed their kids, no 
money to house the homeless, no 
money to insure the uninsured—no 
money for them—but it does provide 
$161 million in corporate welfare for 
the coal industry during a climate 
emergency. That may make sense for 
the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry 
who are destroying the planet with 
their product, but it makes zero sense 
to me. 
Further, under the Senate Repub-
lican bill, if you are a wealthy business 
owner who forces employees to work in 
an unsafe and unhealthy workplace, 
you are rewarded. The Republican bill 
will provide you with the immunity 
you need from lawsuits if your workers 
get sick or die from the coronavirus,

but if you are an essential worker dur-
ing this pandemic, you get nothing. 
The Republican bill does not provide a 
nickel more for hazard pay or the per-
sonal protective equipment that you 
need and deserve. 
Needless to say, I am strongly op-
posed to the Senate Republican bill and 
am glad it was defeated earlier today. 
Instead of listening to the needs of 
fossil fuel CEOs, we need to listen to 
the needs of working-class Americans, 
the people who are hurting. Instead of 
providing more corporate welfare to 
billionaires and large corporations, we 
need to provide more economic relief 
to the tens of millions of Americans 
who are hurting economically. 
Nearly 4 months ago, the House of 
Representatives did its job by passing 
the Heroes Act, a $3.5 trillion bill. In 
my view, the Senate has to stand up 
and do its job and pass the Heroes Act 
or a bill that is even better than that 
legislation. 
I received many, many thousands of 
letters, emails, and social media from 
constituents in the State of Vermont 
and, in fact, all over this country about 
how the economic crisis has negatively 
impacted their lives and what that $600 
a week in unemployment benefits that 
expired in July meant to them. 
Let me read you just a few of the 
many thousands of stories my office 
has received. A constituent from North 
Chittenden, VT, wrote: 
I was laid off in March. Since the end of 
the extra $600 I’ve been able to eat because of 
the food bank. I wasn’t able to get one of my 
prescriptions because even with insurance it 
was $88. I saved as much as I could during 
the extra $600 period, but I’m almost out of 
money now. Literally enough to make it 
about 10 days. Then what? I’m 65 [years of 
age]. 
An unemployed worker wrote: 
We can’t pay our rent including car pay-
ment and car insurance, bills, feed our four 
kids, or buy necessities. We desperately need 
the extra $600 to stay afloat. If we don’t get 
our money soon, we could lose EVERY-
THING! 
Another unemployed worker recently 
wrote: 
My State benefit was $127 a week (I ex-
hausted my available State funds last week). 
My rent is $1,200 a month. Without further 
congressional action, I will be unhoused 
within a month or two. 
A constituent from Danville, VT, 
wrote: 
That moment the government stopped the 
$600 a week they closed my benefits. I never 
saw anything other than that $600 and it 
went to bills and rent. Now I am behind on 
everything again. 
And on and on it goes. For millions 
of people, that $600-a-week check was 
life and death. 
Clearly, in the midst of this unprece-
dented crisis, the Senate must act and 
act now, not with a skinny relief bill 
that does virtually nothing to help 
working families in their time of need, 
but with legislation that responds to 
the unprecedented economic pain and 
suffering that the American working 
class is experiencing. 
We need to extend the extra $600 a 
week in unemployment benefits for the 
30 million Americans who have lost 
their jobs—like the House passed over 3 
months ago. This is absolutely essen-
tial. During this crisis, it would give 
families the income they need to live 
with it. We need to make sure that 
every working-class person in America 
receives $2,000 a month until this crisis 
is over so they can pay the rent and 
put food on the table. 
We need to expand Medicare to all 
the 92 million Americans who are unin-
sured or underinsured. Nobody should 
be unable to go to a doctor during this 
crisis because they don’t have health 
insurance. In other words, we need a 
coronavirus relief bill that benefits the 
working families of this country and 
low-income 
people, 
not 
just 
the 
wealthy and well-connected. 
I know what my Republican col-
leagues will say—that it is too expen-
sive, and we can’t afford it. Maybe, just 
maybe, our Republican colleagues are 
so concerned about the deficit they 
might want to ask their billionaire 
campaign contributors to pay their fair 
share of taxes instead of giving them 
massive tax breaks. 
In the midst of the worst economic 
crisis since the Great Depression and 
the worst public health crisis in more 
than 100 years, I think most Americans 
would be shocked to learn that 467 bil-
lionaires in our country have seen 
their wealth go up by $800 billion dur-
ing the pandemic. Let me repeat that: 
467 billionaires have seen their wealth 
go up by $800 billion during the pan-
demic. In my view, at a time of mas-
sive wealth and income inequality and 
when so many of our people are hurt-
ing, it is morally obscene for billion-
aires to use a global pandemic as an op-
portunity to make outrageous profits. 
Instead of more austerity for the 
working class of this country, we need 
to impose austerity on the billionaire 
class and on Wall Street. That is why I 
have introduced legislation to tax the 
obscene wealth gains billionaires have 
made during the public health crisis. 
According to the Americans for Tax 
Fairness, if we taxed 60 percent of the 
windfall gains billionaires made during 
the pandemic, we could raise over $420 
billion. That is enough revenue to 
allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of- 
pocket healthcare expenses for every-
one in America in the next 12 months. 
Yes, by taxing 60 percent of the wealth 
gains made by just 467 people during 
this horrific pandemic, we could guar-
antee healthcare as a right for an en-
tire year for every man, woman, and 
child in this country. Billionaires 
would still be able to pocket over $300 
billion in wealth gains during the 
worst economic downturn since the 
Great Depression. 
At a time of enormous economic pain 
and suffering, we have a choice to 
make. We can continue to allow the 
very rich to get much richer while ev-
eryone else gets poorer and poorer or 
we can tax the winnings a handful of 
billionaires made during the pandemic 
to improve the health and well-being of 
tens of millions of Americans. 
It is time for the Senate to act on be-
half of the working families of this 
country who are hurting like they have 
never hurt before and not just the bil-
lionaire class who are doing phenome-
nally well and have never had it so 
good. 
I yield the floor.
