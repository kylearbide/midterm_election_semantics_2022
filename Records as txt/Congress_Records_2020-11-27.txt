CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MS. 
ELAINE SHAMIR 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 27, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of my friend Ms. 
Elaine Shamir, who passed away at the age of 
48 on October 5, 2020. Elaine dedicated her 
life to advocating for causes that would help 
her fellow human beings and promote democ-
racy and fairness. Elaine believed passion-
ately in the equality of all persons no matter 
what race, gender, or religion, and lived her 
life in a way that reflected that. She attributed 
her love of all mankind to the loving influence 
of her father, Mordechai Shamir. 
Born on October 12, 1971, Elaine grew up 
in Randolph, New Jersey. She attended the 
University of Maryland and worked in Wash-
ington, D.C. until she came to Los Angeles to 
work for the senatorial campaign of former 
United States Senator Barbara Boxer. For the 
following 20 years, Elaine would continue to 
work for Senator Boxer in addition to her work 
as the founder of Integrity Matters, a full-serv-
ice firm that provides elected officials, can-
didates, and organizations the tools and re-
sources necessary to succeed. Elaine dedi-
cated much of her time to advocating for 
causes close to her heart. Elaine was pas-
sionate about mental health causes and was 
a driving force behind the passage of mental 
health parity laws through Mind Matters, an or-
ganization she founded to fight for access to 
mental health care for all Americans. Most re-
cently, she had been working to protect voter’s 
rights and fight against voter suppression with 
Fair Fight, a national voting rights organization 
based in Georgia. When she wasn’t working, 
Elaine spent her time enjoying music, cinema, 
swimming, the ocean, and spending time with 
her family and friends. 
Elaine is survived by her mother, Ruth 
Shamir, her sister, Karen Marks, her brother- 
in-law, Ian Marks, her niece, Madison Marks, 
and her nephews Mason and Maxwell Marks, 
as well as many other loving family members 
and friends. It was an honor for me to have 
known and worked with Elaine. May Elaine’s 
memory be a blessing to us all.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF TROY 
LEE JONES 
HON. JODEY C. ARRINGTON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 27, 2020 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life, and honor the 
memory of Troy Lee Jones, a member of the 
Greatest Generation who I had the privilege of 
representing in the United States House of 
Representatives. 
It cannot be disputed, Madam Speaker, that 
Mr. Jones’ life was defined by his devotion to 
the Lord, a fierce American patriotism, and a 
specialty for salesmanship—traits he no doubt 
passed along to the children and grand-
children he raised, all of whom have made tre-
mendous contributions to the economic, health 
and educational wellbeing of West Texas. 
Troy Lee Jones drew the first breath of his 
extraordinary life on May 14, 1924, in Radium, 
Jones County, Texas. Born to Georgia Mae 
and Lacy D. Jones, Mr. Jones grew up in 
small towns on the South Plains before grad-
uating in 1941 from Sparenberg High School, 
located at Five Mile, Dawson County, Texas. 
After high school, he worked several jobs, in-
cluding that of Civilian Quartermaster at 
Lamesa Field, a United States Army Air Force 
glider training school. Despite qualifying for a 
deferment, and against his mother’s wishes, 
Mr. Jones enlisted in the United States Army 
in 1943. He trained at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, 
Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Fort 
Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, and Fort Ham-
ilton, Brooklyn, New York. 
A member of the 487th Port Battalion, Com-
pany B, 5th Engineers Special Brigade, 1st 
Army, Mr. Jones trained for Operation Over-
lord with his fellow soldiers in Wales’ Rhondda 
Valley before landing on Omaha Beach during 
the first wave of the Allied invasion of Nor-
mandy on June 6, 1944. A recipient of multiple 
campaign awards and the Purple Heart, Pri-
vate Jones served the remainder of the war in 
Antwerp, supporting supply chains to arm and 
feed the Allied Forces, all the while, under 
constant bombardment by the Nazis. 
After returning from Europe, Mr. Jones lived 
in Lamesa where he worked for several years 
before meeting the woman with whom he 
would spend the rest of his life. Troy and Min-
nie Margaret ‘‘Marge’’ Ward met on a blind 
date on New Year’s Eve, 1947 and the couple 
married on March 31, 1950, in Lovington, New 
Mexico. Troy and Marge lived and worked 
alongside one another for the next seventy 
years, and their devotion to one another was 
evident even during the final days of their life 
together. During the decade following their 
nuptials, the couple was blessed with three 
children, Cathy, Terry and Jeff. 
A natural-born salesman, Mr. Jones peddled 
ointment door-to-door as a boy before begin-
ning his formal sales career at Fair Depart-
ment Store in Lamesa the week following his 
marriage. He worked in and managed con-
sumer sales enterprises for over fifteen years 
until he operated his own—Jones Department 
Store—in Silverton, Texas. Not only was Mr. 
Jones a business leader in Briscoe County, he 
was elected to the Silverton City Council and 
served as the town’s mayor during the twenty- 
two years he lived there. Marge and Troy sold 
their store in 1986 and moved to Lubbock, 
where he worked in several sales positions 
prior to his retirement in 1999. 
It’s true that Troy Lee Jones performed he-
roically on the battlefield and that he made 
many positive civic and economic contribu-
tions to West Texas, but what his family ap-
preciates most, Madam Speaker, is the faith 
heritage that Troy passed along to them. He 
accepted Christ as his Savior at the age of 
seven, was baptized in Moran, Texas and 
spent the next nine decades living out his faith 
alongside his family and his community. He 
was an active member in several Baptist 
churches and was an ordained deacon. 
Mr. Jones was preceded in death by his 
parents Georgia Mae Loudder Jones and Lacy 
D. Jones. He is survived by his devoted wife 
Minnie Margaret ‘‘Marge’’ Ward Jones and his 
children, Cathy Marion Jones Buchanan (Mi-
chael) of Lubbock, Terry Lee Jones Byers 
(James) of Muleshoe and Jeffery Ward Jones 
(L’ Anna) of Lubbock. He is also survived by 
eight grandchildren: Juli Catherine Buchanan 
McCauley, Cameron Ward Buchanan, Michael 
Dee Buchanan, Riley Mac Byers, Russell 
Ward Byers, Austin Keith Jones, Linley Brittain 
Jones Melham, Jeffery Nicholas Jones, and 
seventeen great-grandchildren. 
While Mr. Jones resided in Lubbock for the 
final thirty-four years of his life, he lived and 
worked in towns such as Radium, Lorenzo, 
Tuxedo and Levelland, communities that are 
the heart and soul of West Texas and the life 
book of Texas’ 19th Congressional District. 
Like so many other rural Americans, Mr. 
Jones decided as a young man to trade a life 
of relative tranquility on the South Plains for 
one of grueling sacrifice on the battlefields of 
World War II. We must never forget those 
brave Americans, like Troy Lee Jones, who 
risked everything to secure not only America’s 
freedom, but also to liberate the world from 
tyranny and terror. Private Jones and his fel-
low soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines re-
turned home to build their families and com-
munities, laying the groundwork for the moral 
strength and economic prosperity that, even 
today, extends across the dusty plains of West 
Texas and from sea to shining sea. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents and the Texas congressional delegation, 
I wish to thank Troy Lee Jones for his sacrifice 
for the cause of freedom, his legacy of faith 
and service to Almighty God, and his deep 
and lasting contributions to West Texas.

RECOGNIZING NOVEMBER AS COM-

HON. KATHLEEN M. RICE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 27, 2020 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize November as Complex 
Regional Pain Syndrome Awareness Month 
and to join my colleagues in Congress and in-
dividuals around the United States and the 
world in recognizing the unique hardships 
faced by those living with chronic pain. 
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) 
is a rare neurological disorder that causes sig-
nificant chronic or acute pain, most often in

the arms or legs. According to the National 
Organization for Rare Disorders, it is esti-
mated that there are as many as 200,000 peo-
ple in the United States who are affected by 
CRPS each year. While many of these individ-
uals do eventually recover, its effects can last 
for months or years, and for those with more 
severe forms of the disorder, CRPS can cause 
long-term disability. 
Although our country has made great 
progress in diagnosing and treating CRPS, we 
have so much more to learn about this little- 
understood disorder and other rare conditions 
that cause chronic pain. That is why I am 
proud to support the great work of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the National Institute 
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the 
lnstitute’s Brain Resources and Information 
Network (BRAIN) program. 
In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, we 
must recognize the significant additional hard-
ships that many of our fellow citizens face due 
to CRPS and other rare diseases. On Novem-
ber 2nd, New York landmarks from Nassau 
County to Niagara Falls were lit up in orange 
in honor of those living with CRPS. Please join 
me in recognizing November as CRPS Aware-
ness Month to spread further awareness of 
CRPS and those that it affects.
