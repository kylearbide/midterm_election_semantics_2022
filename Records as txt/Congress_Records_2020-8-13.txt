U.S. SENATE,

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate was supposed to spend this 
week finalizing another bipartisan res-
cue package for the American people. 
Millions of laid-off workers needed 
more Federal assistance to weather the 
storm. Small businesses needed more 
support to make payroll. Schools and 
families need more funding, tools, and 
certainty with reopening dates fast ap-
proaching. 
Doctors, 
nurses, 
and 
healthcare workers need more backup 
as they hold the line against this dis-
ease. We all need more gas for the race 
toward more testing, better treat-
ments, and the vaccine that will finish 
this fight. So last week I canceled the 
first week of our August State work 
period in the hope that the Speaker of 
the House and the Democratic leader 
would put aside their ideological de-
mands with no relation to this pan-
demic and finally let Congress legis-
late. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats have 
continued 
to 
let 
working 
families 
down. They are still rejecting any more 
relief for anyone unless they get a 
flood of demands with no relationship 
to COVID–19. 
It has been more than 2 weeks since 
Senate Republicans put out a trillion- 
dollar plan to help America reopen, re-
cover, and stay on offense against this 
virus. Republicans did the same thing 
that worked back in March. We set up 
the same process that built the unani-
mous CARES Act in a matter of days. 
We laid out a strong marker built by 
our chairmen and our committees, 
fitted to real, fact-based needs of our 
Nation and then invited the Democrats 
to negotiate. 
We want another round of direct cash 
payments for American families. We 
want to send $105 billion to help 
schools and universities safely reopen 
and billions more to help working par-
ents with childcare. We want to create 
new incentives for retaining and rehir-
ing America’s workers and for busi-
nesses to improve workplace safety. We 
want to create the smart legal protec-
tions that small businesses and univer-
sity presidents are pleading for, so they 
can reopen safely for students and 
workers without paying a ransom to 
the trial lawyers. 
These are the strong policies we pro-
posed because these are the policies our

Nation actually needs. We want to take 
second runs at the best and most suc-
cessful parts of the bipartisan CARES 
Act while adding in bold new steps for 
this new phase of our Nation’s battle. 
But as I said right from the outset, 
Republicans had no illusion that our 
initial marker would become law. That 
isn’t how divided government operates. 
There was never any question that bi-
partisan compromise would be needed 
to get an outcome. So I expected that, 
just like in March, the Democratic 
ranking members would sit down with 
our chairmen, bring some of their own 
serious ideas to the table, and work to-
gether to build a bipartisan bill. That 
is what happened back then. But, in-
stead, the country got something else 
entirely. 
Instead of working with our serious 
framework, the Speaker of the House 
and the Senate Democratic leader 
spent 
weeks 
insisting 
on 
a 
com-
pletely—completely—unrealistic, 
far- 
left proposal that even their own 
Democratic Members mocked as a go- 
nowhere messaging stunt the instant it 
was first released. 
Instead of letting their committees 
and their Members discuss substantive 
issues across the aisle, they said no-
body could negotiate but them. And in-
stead of staying focused on the real 
needs of our Nation, these two Demo-
cratic leaders have held the talks hos-
tage 
for 
weeks 
now—weeks—over 
nonCOVID-related ideological items, 
which the political left has wanted 
since well before this virus hit our 
shores. 
You know what I am talking about. 
By now, the whole country knows what 
I am talking about: the absurd issues 
the Democrats have turned into stick-
ing points; the bizarre, parochial left-
wing favors that Democrats have put 
ahead of the help that working families 
need right now, like the massive tax 
cuts for the highest earners in the blu-
est States—an idea that even sup-
posedly progressive economists have 
said is ‘‘not a good idea’’; the trillion- 
dollar slush fund for State and local 
governments that have only spent 25 
percent—25 percent—of the billions 
that we sent them back in March, to-
tally out of proportion to any estimate 
of urgent pandemic shortfalls; the so-
cialist insistence on the Federal Gov-
ernment paying people more not to 
work—not 
to 
work—than 
essential 
workers earn when they are on the job. 
Go to any kitchen table in America, 
outside of a few skyscraper penthouses, 
and put these bizarre demands up 
against the trillion dollars of real, 
practical relief that Republicans want-
ed to get out the door weeks ago. No 
family in Middle America is saying: 
Thank goodness. Thank goodness the 
Democrats are blocking cash payments 
to me, money for my kids’ schools, and 
money for vaccines until Manhattan 
millionaires get a tax cut. 
No working people are saying: Thank 
goodness the Democrats are blocking 
the next small business rescue plan, 
money for testing, and rehiring incen-
tives until Malibu, CA, gets Federal 
money to keep buying more electric 
cars, which they wrote to the Congress 
demanding. 
Families aren’t saying this. Outside 
of Speaker PELOSI and Leader SCHU-
MER, 
even 
Washington 
Democrats 
aren’t saying this. 
While the press tries its hardest to 
praise Speaker PELOSI
for ‘‘playing 
hardball,’’ her own House Democrats 
are rebelling. They say they are ‘‘frus-
trated’’ and ‘‘angry’’ that relief is 
being held up over what they them-
selves acknowledge is a ‘‘political wish 
list.’’ 
‘‘[T]he HEROES Act went too far,’’ is 
another quote. 
These are Democrats talking about 
the Heroes Act. 
Even the Speaker’s own members are 
not buying their political spin. They 
want what Republicans want, what the 
administration wants, what America’s 
families everywhere want. We need to 
get an outcome. 
The Secretary of the Treasury and 
the White House chief of staff have 
given ground. They have put new issues 
on the table that Democrats wanted. 
They 
have 
worked 
to 
find 
com-
monality. But the Democrats are bare-
ly even pretending to negotiate—barely 
even pretending. The Speaker’s latest 
spin is that it is some heroic sacrifice 
to lower her demands from a made-up 
$3.5 trillion marker that was never 
going to become law to an equally 
made-up $2.5 trillion marker. She calls 
this meeting in the middle. 
That is not negotiating; that is 
throwing spaghetti at the wall to see 
what sticks. People who have serious 
policy proposals that are fitted to ac-
tual needs cannot breezily knock off a 
trillion here and add a trillion there. 
Heck, by the Speaker’s logic, they 
should have just opened with their en-
tire $93 trillion Green New Deal. Then 
they could have blamed the President 
for not meeting them halfway at the 
cut-rate bargain sum of $45 trillion. 
Come on. In point of fact, the Speak-
er and the leader have not conceded 
anything at all. They haven’t budged 
on their absurd demands. They just 
moved the expiration date a few weeks 
on the exact same crazy wish list, so 
the pricetag comes down without mov-
ing an inch on the merits. 
They have refused Republicans’ offer 
to pass everything that we can agree 
on. The administration has said: Let’s 
pass things we can agree on right now. 
The Republicans don’t think that a 
disputed issue should hold up the most 
urgent aid for working families, but 
the answer so far from the Democratic 
leadership is no. The partisan games 
continue, so the Nation’s pain con-
tinues as well. 
Laid-off workers and kids and par-
ents and doctors and nurses are waiting 
for help. Our people are waiting for 
help. Republicans have been at the 
table for weeks. We just need serious-
ness on the other side. American fami-
lies’ livelihoods are at stake. American 
lives are at stake. Democrats must 
rerun their political calculations and 
finally—finally—let Congress act.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, here we 
go again. Another day has passed. 
Nothing has happened—no incremental 
progress, no compromise. To some it 
might just be one day, but for too 
many Americans, another day fighting 
for your health or how you will pay 
your rent or how you will feed your 
kids is a brutal and terrifying thing. 
What is one more day to an average 
American? It might be a day closer to 
the rent being due without having 
money to pay it. It might be another 
day with insufficient unemployment 
benefits while bills pile up. It might be 
another day closer to possibly needing 
SNAP assistance or help from a food 
bank. 
One more day could mean con-
strained testing supplies don’t pick up 
as many cases of COVID–19, so the car-
riers can isolate and protect others. 
One day today means for one of my 
staffers—it was move-in day for his 
oldest daughter at college, but because 
she couldn’t get her test result back 
quickly enough, that experience, which 
is an exciting one for a young person, 
could not happen. 
These are not simple legislative days 
while we follow a negotiation strategy. 
These are days when Americans are 
struggling and suffering, and we are 
not responding. 
Democrats are here. We are ready to 
compromise any day. In fact, we have 
already offered to meet the White 
House halfway on the size of the relief 
effort. Our meet-in-the-middle offer 
was rebuffed Friday, and it was re-
jected by the White House again yes-
terday. 
I have heard the majority leader 
today and on other days characterize 
the Heroes Act in his remarks as a 
Democratic wish list. So what I would 
like to do is walk through the Demo-
cratic and Republican proposals side by 
side. At every step I hope listeners will 
ask themselves: Which of these agendas 
is 
oriented 
to 
helping 
Americans 
through hard times? 
The Democratic proposal includes 
this: continuing expanded unemploy-
ment benefits for the duration of this

crisis; cash assistance for struggling 
families to avoid eviction and fore-
closure rather than just delaying bills 
and piling up debt; sufficient funding 
and flexibility for State and local gov-
ernments so that we don’t have a sec-
ond wave of job loss when those gov-
ernments are forced to cut their budg-
ets, and so they don’t have to cut vital 
programs and lay off first responders 
during a global health pandemic; suffi-
cient childcare funding both to help 
working 
families 
and 
to 
allow 
childcare providers to reopen so that 
we can get back to work; providing K– 
12 schools with the funding they need 
regardless of how they choose to re-
open so that they can effectively edu-
cate students; ensuring every Amer-
ican can have access to free treatment 
for coronavirus; helping families keep 
food on the table by giving an increase 
in the SNAP benefit plus additional 
funding for nutrition programs; con-
tinuing support for America’s small 
businesses; protection for the integrity 
of our elections during a period of un-
certainty and fear. Those are the pro-
posals that are contained in the Heroes 
Act. 
The Republican proposals, combining 
both the HEALS Act—the Senate GOP 
proposal—and President Trump’s Exec-
utive orders, include this: $1.75 billion 
to keep the FBI headquarters in DC so 
as to prevent potential hotel competi-
tion 
for 
the 
Trump 
International 
Hotel; expanded corporate tax writeoffs 
for business lunches—another top pri-
ority for the White House; sharp cuts 
to unemployment benefits for workers 
who are suffering and out of work; 
broad immunity for large corporations 
even if they are not taking any actions 
to protect their workers; the effective 
elimination of State rules, including a 
rule in Virginia designed to facilitate 
the safe reopening of businesses and 
the economy; undermining important 
protections and enforcement of long-
standing civil rights and disability 
laws; punishing public schools that 
choose to follow public health guidance 
but still want to provide their students 
with an education by reopening vir-
tually; pushing a tax credit program 
that would make donations to private 
school scholarships already deductible 
as 
charitable 
contributions—that 
would make those now preferred over 
any 
other 
charitable 
contribution, 
likely draining money away from other 
charities and hurting government fund-
ing, as well; and finally, stopping pay-
roll tax contributions into the Social 
Security trust fund, creating huge un-
certainty for employers and employees 
but also threatening to undermine the 
fiscal future of Social Security retire-
ment benefits. 
These are elements of the Republican 
HEALS Act and President Trump’s Ex-
ecutive orders. 
Equally important is what is not in 
any of the Republican proposals—ei-
ther that offered in the Senate or im-
plemented by the President’s Executive 
orders. Food aid for hungry kids and 
families? Nothing. Rental assistance? 
Nothing. Mortgage assistance? Noth-
ing. Aid to the States and localities 
where Americans live and work? Noth-
ing. Funding to ensure the integrity of 
the upcoming elections? Nothing. 
So I would ask anyone, which of 
these proposals seems more likely to 
help Americans who are experiencing 
hard times? If anyone is in doubt—and 
I don’t think any are—about what 
kinds of hard times people are in, yes-
terday I shared some stories from Vir-
ginians who have shared them with me, 
just as they are sharing them with all 
Senators. Here are a few more of the 
constituents who have reached out to 
me. 
The owner of a small business with 18 
employees in Northern Virginia wrote 
me: ‘‘My business is struggling, my em-
ployees are suffering, and we need fur-
ther assistance.’’ He went on to de-
scribe how his business was completely 
shut down in the crisis. Even now that 
they are open, they will be operating at 
less than half their normal revenue for 
the foreseeable future. Their PPP and 
EIDL loan funds—they were glad to get 
them—have run out, and they need 
Congress to act to prevent the business 
from shuttering and those 18 jobs from 
disappearing permanently. 
A 
woman 
from 
Henrico 
County, 
which is right outside of Richmond, 
wrote: 
As I watch the news, it gets harder and 
harder. We desperately need help. . . . My 
son had COVID, he is still struggling with 
health issues and cannot work. 
A woman in Springfield, here in Fair-
fax County, has been waiting for infor-
mation that she needs mailed to her so 
she can get access to unemployment 
benefits, but the delays in the Postal 
Service have left her without the bene-
fits she earned and is entitled to. She is 
a single mother of five and said: ‘‘At 
this point, I am struggling to feed my 
family.’’ 
A woman from Dumfries in Prince 
William County said: 
I’m asking for help with the aid for the un-
employed workers like myself that Covid has 
affected. We are a family of 4 and I have lost 
my unemployment that we depended on for 
groceries. My husband’s salary covers the 
bills but I worked for groceries and any ex-
tras. As of now I may be able to get $190 a 
week from the state if they reevaluate my 
claim. Please, I’m asking for bipartisan sup-
port on an unemployment package that will 
help families like mine to make it through 
this pandemic. 
Finally, a woman from Alexandria— 
just across the Potomac—wrote: 
I would like to request consideration for 
more emergency funding for daycare and pre-
school facilities. My 14 month old little girl 
attends daycare 5 days per week. Her 
daycare is wonderful, but it’s at risk of clos-
ing in the very near future because it only 
has 1/3 of the minimum number of enrollees 
that it needs to be able to afford to stay 
open. I’m an essential worker in healthcare, 
specifically in pediatric care, and my hus-
band is an essential Department of Defense 
employee. If I have to stay home with my 
daughter, I can’t take care of the children of 
others, and I’m honestly very worried about 
the prospects of eventually finding a new 
job, as healthcare facilities are also suffering 
a large reduction of daily patients. I ask this 
from the bottom of my heart. Please provide 
funding for our daycare and preschool facili-
ties, so they can be here for us through and 
after the pandemic, so parents in Virginia 
will be able to continue work now or return 
to work when it is safe to do so. 
It is not about politics. It is not 
about 
credit. 
It 
is 
about 
coming 
through for Americans when they need 
it. It is the case that, yesterday, Demo-
cratic leaders reached out again to the 
White House and repeated what they 
had offered last Friday. Let’s meet in 
the middle. Let’s meet halfway be-
tween the Republican proposals laid 
out in the HEALS Act and the Presi-
dent’s Executive orders and the Demo-
cratic proposal passed by a sizeable 
majority in the House nearly 3 months 
ago. 
That is what Americans want—nego-
tiate, compromise, meet in the middle, 
and find common ground, just as we did 
in the CARES Act. The White House 
response was, no dice. They refused the 
Democratic proposal to meet halfway. 
They said that is not going to happen. 
We need to get serious. Days con-
tinue to tick by as families face hard 
decisions. Democrats are here, and we 
are ready. The White House must stop 
its ‘‘no compromise’’ position to meet 
the needs of American families. Let’s 
buckle down, make a deal, and get this 
done. The American people can’t afford 
to wait any longer. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROB-
ERTS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
stand in recess subject to the call of 
the Chair. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 1:53 p.m., recessed subject to the call 
of the Chair and reassembled at 2:43 
p.m., when called to order by the Act-
ing President pro tempore. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, after 
the Senate adjourns today, we will 
have our regular pro forma meetings 
through the end of the State work pe-
riod. 
If the Speaker of the House and the 
minority leader of the Senate decide to 
finally let another rescue package 
move forward for workers and for fami-
lies, it would take bipartisan consent 
to meet for legislative business sooner 
than scheduled. As has been the case,

The American people need more help. 
The coronavirus is not finished with 
our country, so Congress cannot be fin-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5410 
August 13, 2020 
S. 4530. A bill to establish a Snow 
Water Supply Forecasting Program 
within the Department of the Interior, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the Snow 
Water Supply Forecasting Program 
Authorization Act, which I introduced 
today with Senator HARRIS. Represent-
atives JOSH HARDER, JOHN GARAMENDI, 
JERRY MCNERNEY, GRACE NAPOLITANO, 
T.J. COX, and AMI BERA—all Democrats 
from California—and DIANA DEGETTE 
and JOE NEGUSE—both Democrats from 
Colorado—have 
introduced 
identical 
companion legislation in the House. 
Airborne snow observatory, ASO, 
technology is a snow monitoring tool 
that provides precise measurement of 
depth and water content for every 
square meter of snow in a watershed. 
The technology measures snow depth 
and water content using an airplane- 
mounted light detection, LiDAR, in-
strument coupled with an imaging 
spectrometer. 
When combined with conventional 
snow surveys, ASO provides a near-per-
fect picture of snow water content. 
By near perfect, I mean that ASO es-
timates snowpack and runoff forecast 
with 96 to 99 percent accuracy. This is 
much better than current practices, 
which only measure snowpack and run-
off with 50 to 90 percent accuracy. 
These 
forecast 
accuracies 
are 
achieved by comparing LiDAR meas-
urements of bare ground topography in 
the summer with multiple measure-
ments of snow depth during the winter. 
The greatest accuracies are based on 
once-a-month flights in watersheds 
earlier in the winter, and twice month-
ly flights during the spring runoff pe-
riod. 
The much more precise measure-
ments of snowpack that ASO provides 
will be critical in better managing 
competing missions of western water 
storage reservoirs for flood control and 
water supply amidst a changing cli-
mate and growing population. 
For example, in a single year, 2018, 
Turlock Irrigation District used this 
technology in the Tuolumne River wa-
tershed to save 150,000 acre-feet of 
water supply. 
Because they knew precisely how 
much snow was in the upper watershed 
of the Tuolumne, Turlock was able to 
avoid a release of 150,000 acre-feet of 
water from Don Pedro Reservoir that 
otherwise would have been required for 
flood control. 
Without ASO technology, Turlock 
would have had to assume for safety 
purposes that the melting snow in the 
upper Tuolumne watershed was at the 
high end of a wide range of guess-
timates using conventional snowpack 
technology. With the possibility of a 
big snowmelt, Turlock would have had 
to release the extra 150,000 acre feet of 
water. 
With water in California often cost-
ing $1000 per acre foot or more, errors 
in water-storage management can cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars in un-
necessary releases from reservoirs and 
extra groundwater pumping. 
Additional ASO flights to better 
measure snowpack often have a high 
return on investment, by one estimate 
as much as 40:1 for water supply bene-
fits, and 80:1 for all benefits, including 
hydro, recharge, flood control, and eco-
system benefits. 
After several years developing and 
refining the deployment of snowpack 
measurement technology, in December 
2019, NASA concluded management of 
the-ASO program and transferred it to 
the private sector. While consistent 
with NASA’s traditional approach to 
developing 
new 
technologies, 
this 
transfer reduces the certainty for Fed-
eral support of a program with signifi-
cant public benefits, including im-
proved water conservation, supply and 
delivery forecasts across the West. 
The bill establishes a snow pack fore-
casting program at the Bureau of Rec-
lamation within the Department of the 
Interior. 
The Bureau shall implement the pro-
gram in two phases: 
No. 1, the first step is to coordinate 
with other Federal agencies on how 
they will work together to improve 
analyses of snowpack depth. This inter-
agency process will result in a report 
due to Congress by October 21, 2021. 
No. 2, following the completion of the 
report, the Bureau will cost-share with 
States, water districts, other Federal 
agencies and other partners on in-
creased LiDAR flights and other activi-
ties in particular watersheds. 
This program is expected to benefit 
many Western States, including but 
not limited to Sierra Nevada and Cas-
cade Mountains; the Front Range of 
the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wy-
oming, and New Mexico; and the Colo-
rado River tributaries in Utah and Ari-
zona, and the Pacific Northwest. 
Fifteen million dollars would be au-
thorized for the program from fiscal 
years 2022 to 2026. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill.

680—CON-
DEMNING THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-
LIC OF CHINA’S USE OF MILI-
TARY AGGRESSION TO CHANGE 
THE STATUS QUO AT THE LINE 
OF ACTUAL CONTROL BETWEEN 
INDIA AND CHINA 
Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. 
WARNER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 680 
Whereas, since a truce ended the 1962 war 
between India and the People’s Republic of 
China, the countries have been divided by a 
Line of Actual Control; 
Whereas the United States officially recog-
nizes the McMahon Line, the Indian state of 
Arunachal Pradesh, and encourages a diplo-
matic solution to remaining contested areas 
of the border between India and China; 
Whereas, due to the disputed nature of the 
Line of Actual Control, minor standoffs be-
tween India and the People’s Republic of 
China have occasionally happened, but prior 
to June 15, 2020, no military fatalities had 
occurred since 1975; 
Whereas, in the months leading up to June 
15, 2020, the People’s Republic of China in-
creased troop deployments, built new infra-
structure in contested areas, and harassed 
Indian patrols along multiple sectors of the 
Line of Actual Control, particularly around 
the Depsang Plains, Galwan Valley, Hot 
Springs, and Pangong Lake; 
Whereas the events of June 15, 2020, which 
resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers, 
raises serious concerns regarding the intent 
of the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China and its military forces; 
Whereas this act by the People’s Republic 
of China military occurred during bilateral 
diplomatic negotiations between the Govern-
ments of the People’s Republic of China and 
India, who were attempting to deescalate 
tensions at the Line of Actual Control; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China’s expanded territorial 
claims in Bhutan’s eastern sector is a trans-
parent attempt at expanding its illegitimate 
claims over the Indian state of Arunachal 
Pradesh; 
Whereas the United States designated 
India as a Major Defense Partner and has 
taken steps to deepen the bilateral defense 
relationship, including by elevating India to 
Strategic Trade Authorization Tier 1 Status 
and conducting annual joint military exer-
cises; 
Whereas the United States Government re-
mains committed to a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific and views China’s aggression at the 
Line of Actual Control, in the Indian Ocean, 
and in the Western Pacific as a threat to the 
stability and security of the international 
community; 
Whereas the Government of India has 
taken steps to secure its telecommuni-
cations infrastructure from Chinese security 
threats; 
Whereas it mutually benefits the United 
States and India to strengthen their Com-
prehensive 
Global 
Strategic 
Partnership 
through increased defense interoperability, 
intelligence sharing, access to military in-
stallations, and trade; 
Whereas the United States and India have 
signed three foundational military agree-
ments, the General Security of Military In-
formation Agreement, the Logistics Ex-
change Memorandum of Understanding, and 
the Communications, Compatibility, and Se-
curity Agreement, and are working to sign 
the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agree-
ment; and 
Whereas it is in the mutual interest of the 
United States and India to expand their de-
fense and intelligence relationships both bi-
laterally, as well as multilaterally through 
the Quadrilateral Dialogue with Japan and 
Australia: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s use of military force to change the sta-
tus quo at the Line of Actual Control, as well 
as its refusal to demarcate that Line in ac-
cordance with past bilateral agreements 
with India; 
(2) supports a diplomatic solution that rap-
idly restores the April 2020 status quo at the 
Line of Actual Control; 
(3) commends India for taking steps to se-
cure its telecommunications infrastructure

WORKERS WHO WORKED ON THE 
TRANSCONTINENTAL 
RAILROAD 
FROM 1865 TO 1869 AND THE IM-
PORTANT 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF 
THOSE RAILROAD WORKERS TO 
THE GROWTH OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 681 
Whereas the Transcontinental Railroad 
was 1 of the most remarkable engineering 
feats of the 19th century; 
Whereas construction of the nearly 2,000- 
mile Transcontinental Railroad spanned 6 
years; 
Whereas the completion of the Trans-
continental Railroad facilitated commerce 
and reduced cross-country travel time from 6 
months to 1 week; 
Whereas nearly 12,000 Chinese immigrants 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Chinese 
railroad workers’’) were employed in the 
construction of the Transcontinental Rail-
road, constituting more than 80 percent of 
the workforce of the Central Pacific Rail-
road Company; 
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers 
were— 
(1) considered indispensable by the foremen 
on the project; and 
(2) respected for their work ethic and dis-
cipline; 
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers set a 
world record by laying 10 miles of railroad 
track in just 1 work day; 
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers 
were— 
(1) given the most difficult and dangerous 
jobs; and 
(2) paid lower wages than other railroad 
workers; 
Whereas nearly 1,200 Chinese railroad 
workers died from work accidents, ava-
lanches, and explosions while working in the 
Sierra Nevada Mountains; 
Whereas, in honor of the courage shown by 
the Chinese railroad workers in organizing 
for fair wages and safe working conditions, 
the Department of Labor inducted the Chi-
nese railroad workers into the Labor Hall of 
Honor in 2014; 
Whereas the fight of the Chinese railroad 
workers against discrimination set an exam-
ple for millions of Asian Americans who 
later came to the United States; 
Whereas the descendants of the Chinese 
railroad workers and the wider Asian-Amer-
ican community view the sacrifices of the 
Chinese railroad workers as integral to the 
creation of the vibrant and growing Asian- 
American community that exists throughout 
the United States; and 
Whereas the legacy of the Chinese railroad 
workers continues to have a profound and 
positive impact on life in the United States 
by advancing the ideals of equal opportunity 
and the dignity of work for everyone: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the Chinese immigrants who worked on 
the Transcontinental Railroad from 1865 to 
1869 (referred to in this resolving clause as 
the ‘‘Chinese railroad workers’’); and 
(B) the contributions of the Chinese rail-
road workers to the construction of the 
Transcontinental Railroad and the growth of 
the United States; 
(2) honors the Chinese railroad workers 
who lost their lives working in the Sierra 
Nevada Mountains; and 
(3) acknowledges all of the risks faced by 
the Chinese railroad workers in completing 
the construction of the Transcontinental 
Railroad while enduring discrimination and 
unequal pay and treatment.

PEOPLE 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RISCH, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. ROMNEY, Mr. MURPHY, 
and Mr. PORTMAN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 682 
Whereas, on August 4, 2020, 2,750 tons of 
ammonium nitrate detonated at the Port of 
Beirut, killing more than 200 people and in-
juring thousands more; 
Whereas the dangerous and highly explo-
sive material was unsafely stored at the Port 
of Beirut since 2014, despite repeated warn-
ings over the threat the stockpile posed to 
the surrounding civilian population; 
Whereas the Secretary General of the Leb-
anese Red Cross was quoted as saying, ‘‘What 
we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe.’’; 
Whereas the blast destroyed vast swaths of 
infrastructure across Beirut and displaced up 
to 300,000 people; 
Whereas the blast destroyed or damaged 
the entire port of Beirut, through which Leb-
anon imports the bulk of its food, including 
the destruction of approximately 120,000 met-
ric tons of desperately needed food stocks, 
according to the United Nations; 
Whereas, prior to the blast, nearly 1,000,000 
people in the Beirut metropolitan area, in-
cluding more than 500,000 children, did not 
have the means to buy basic essentials, in-
cluding food; 
Whereas Lebanon already struggles to sup-
port the largest per-capita population of ref-
ugees in the world, including nearly 1,000,000 
Syrian refugees currently registered with 
the United Nations; 
Whereas the governor of Beirut predicted 
that the full cost of recovery and relief could 
be between $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000; 
Whereas several Beirut hospitals, already 
struggling to procure medical equipment and 
pay medical staff amid the spread of COVID– 
19, have sustained too much blast damage to 
admit new patients; 
Whereas the blasts coincides with a period 
of protracted political crisis in Lebanon; 
Whereas, after months of political dead-
lock, Lebanon formed a government in Janu-
ary of this year with the backing of 
Hezbollah, a United States-designated For-
eign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and its 
allies; 
Whereas 
endemic 
corruption 
and 
Hezbollah’s mismanagement has led Lebanon 
to the brink of economic collapse, including 
an 80 percent currency devaluation since 
2019, one of the highest rates of public debt, 
food insecurity, and hyperinflation; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has longstanding concerns about Hezbollah’s 
use of and influence over the Beirut port as 
a transit and storage point for its terrorist 
enterprise; 
Whereas the people of Lebanon across the 
political spectrum have renewed demands for 
a meaningful change in Lebanon’s political 
leadership, government accountability, and 
transparency; 
Whereas, following the explosion and pub-
lic outcry from the Lebanese people, Prime 
Minister Hassan Diab announced on August 
10, 2020, that he and his government would 
step down; 
Whereas international donors, including 
the United States, have pledged $297,000,000 
in aid to Lebanon at a virtual summit hosted 
by French President Emanuel Macron; 
Whereas the United States, through the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment, announced on August 7, 2020, that 
it would provide more than $15,000,000 in hu-
manitarian assistance to aid the people of 
Lebanon following the explosions at the Port 
of Beirut, and that these funds would support 
life-saving medical responses and relief for 
the immediate needs of people facing this 
tragedy, including food aid for 50,000 people 
for three months and medical and pharma-
ceutical support for up to 60,000 people for 
three months; and 
Whereas a stable Lebanon with a credible, 
transparent government free from Iranian 
and Hezbollah interference is in the broader 
national security interests of the United 
States and United States partners and allies: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) extends its heartfelt condolences to, 
and stands with, the people of Lebanon; 
(2) supports United States Government ef-
forts to provide emergency humanitarian re-
lief in concert with other governments and 
international partners; 
(3) affirms that United States assistance, 
led by the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, should be delivered 
directly to the Lebanese people through 
properly vetted channels, organizations, and 
individuals; 
(4) calls on the Government of Lebanon to 
conduct a credible, impartial, and trans-
parent investigation into the cause of, and 
responsibility for, the explosion, and include 
impartial international experts as part of 
the investigation team; 
(5) calls on the investigation team to 
evaluate and determine the root causes of in-
stability and economic mismanagement that 
have impacted the people of Lebanon; and 
(6) further calls on the Government of Leb-
anon to restore faith and confidence by 
prioritizing policies and programs that ad-
vance the interests of the people of Lebanon.

S. RES. 683 
Whereas all major medical authorities rec-
ommend exclusive breastfeeding for about 
the first 6 months of life and continued 
breastfeeding for not less than the first year 
of life; 
Whereas 
the 
World 
Alliance 
for 
Breastfeeding Action has designated the first 
week of August as ‘‘World Breastfeeding 
Week’’, and the United States Breastfeeding 
Committee has designated August as ‘‘Na-
tional Breastfeeding Month’’; 
Whereas National Breastfeeding Month fo-
cuses on how data and measurements can be 
used to build and reinforce the connections 
between breastfeeding and a broad spectrum 
of other health topics and initiatives; 
Whereas World Breastfeeding Week and 
National Breastfeeding Month provide im-
portant opportunities to address barriers to 
breastfeeding faced by families across the 
United States and around the world; 
Whereas breastfeeding is a proven primary 
prevention strategy that builds a foundation 
for life-long health and wellness; 
Whereas the evidence of the value of 
breastfeeding to the health of women and 
children is scientific, solid, and continually 
reaffirmed by new research; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and 
Prevention 
publishes 
an 
annual 
Breastfeeding Report Card, which has found 
that, while the proportion of infants who 
were ever breastfed in the United States is 
increasing, the United States continues to 
miss targets for exclusive breastfeeding for 
the first 6 months of life; 
Whereas there are substantial racial and 
ethnic disparities in access to breastfeeding 
support, resulting in reduced breastfeeding 
rates and an associated increase in risk for a 
variety of negative health outcomes; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, the National Immunization 
Survey reports that 86.6 percent of White in-
fants have ever been breastfed, while— 
(1) 74 percent of Black infants have ever 
been breastfed; and 
(2) 79.5 percent of American Indian and 
Alaska 
Native 
infants 
have 
ever 
been 
breastfed; 
Whereas the Healthy People initiative of 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices has consistently identified breastfeeding 
as a national health priority; 
Whereas the majority of new parents want 
to breastfeed but face significant barriers in 
community, health care, and employment 
settings; 
Whereas, while some parents may choose 
not to breastfeed or are unable to breastfeed, 
all parents can benefit from access to edu-
cation on infant nutrition and wellness; 
Whereas 
protecting 
and 
supporting 
breastfeeding for parents who are able to 
breastfeed is essential to ensuring critical 
food security and immunologic protection 
for the youngest residents of the United 
States; and 
Whereas the consistent and well-docu-
mented health, economic, and environmental 
benefits 
of 
breastfeeding 
show 
that 
breastfeeding is an investment that will con-

HOLDERS FOUNDATION, LLC 
Ms. MCSALLY (for herself and Mrs. 
BLACKBURN) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. CON. RES. 43 
Whereas sovereign debt obligations (in this 
preamble referred to as ‘‘bonds’’) of the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
were offered and sold in United States cap-
ital markets; 
Whereas the bonds constitute full faith and 
credit sovereign obligations of the inter-
nationally recognized Government of the 
People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China 
subsequently defaulted on those bonds; 
Whereas the bonds constitute an unpaid 
general obligation of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, under the successor government 
doctrine of settled international law (relat-
ing to establishing the continuity of obliga-
tions among successor governments), the re-
payment obligation for the bonds is the obli-
gation of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China continues to refuse to 
repay the bonds held by United States citi-
zens and has officially repudiated the debts, 
which is a clear violation of United States 
law, international law, and the rules and reg-
ulations of the World Bank and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China honored repayment of the 
exact same bonds held by citizens of the 
United Kingdom while rejecting the claims 
of citizens of the United States; 
Whereas, since the normalization of bilat-
eral relations between the United States and 
the People’s Republic of China in the 1970s, 
the United States has shown good will to the 
People’s Republic of China by focusing on an 
expansion of bilateral trade while deferring 
discussion of repayment of the People’s Re-
public of China’s defaulted national debt; 
Whereas, under standard legal principles, 
the People’s Republic of China’s defaulted 
sovereign gold debt has been accumulating 
compound interest for more 82 years and is 
estimated to exceed the total amount of the 
United States national debt to the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas, 
as 
representative 
of 
United 
States bondholders who own the People’s Re-
public of China’s defaulted sovereign gold 
bonds, American Bondholders Foundation, 
LLC, has proposed using the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s obligations as payment for the 
United States national debt to the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas, the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China covered up the outbreak of 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) during its early 
stages, resulting in a global pandemic and 
more than $2,000,000,000,000 in financial dam-
age to the United States; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
pays its debts, and so should the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that the President should do ev-
erything in his power to achieve resolution 
and repayment of the defaulted sovereign 
debt of the People’s Republic of China held 
by 20,000 families in the United States who 
are represented by the American Bond-
holders Foundation, LLC, for the benefit of 
the bondholders and the people of the United 
States.
