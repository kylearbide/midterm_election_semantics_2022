HAPPY NEW YEAR 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
first I want to wish all my fellow Sen-
ators and our staff colleagues here in 
the Capitol a happy and healthy new 
year. In particular, I would like to ex-
tend our gratitude to the Capitol Po-
lice, offices of the Secretary of the 
Senate and the Sergeant at Arms, and 
the many other staff who have gone 
above and beyond to help us attend to 
important business this holiday season. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Today, by the 
grace of God, the genius of science, and 
the resilience of the American people, 
we appear to have a bright 2021 on the 
horizon. Our great Nation is poised to 
defeat this pandemic in the months 
ahead through safe and effective vac-
cines. 
The pace of the American people’s 
economic recovery has already beaten 
expectations and predictions. Thanks 
to the ingenuity of our citizens and 
historic relief policies from Congress, 
overall personal income in our country 
is already higher now than it was prior 
to the pandemic. 
Now, the country needs more sup-
port, and the significant remaining 
pain is not—I repeat, not—evenly dis-
tributed, far from it. So we just en-
acted another historic $900 billion res-
cue package to get vaccines distrib-
uted, to keep small businesses alive, 
and to get a whole lot more targeted 
support to struggling people who actu-
ally need it. From multiple kinds of 
extra Federal unemployment benefits 
to nutrition assistance, rental assist-
ance, direct cash, and beyond. 
This latest, huge, historic package 
was just signed into law less than 1 
week ago. It is beginning to take effect 
right now. Many households have al-
ready received the latest round of di-
rect cash, or will receive it very soon, 
to help them turn the page into this 
brand new year. 
While this huge new aid package 
takes effect, a bipartisan, common-
sense caucus in both Chambers is not 
keen to let Speaker PELOSI and Sen-
ator SANDERS rush to borrow half a 
trillion dollars for universal cash give-
aways, regardless of need. A huge 
chunk would essentially be socialism 
for rich people—money flowing to

households earning well into six figures 
who did not lose any jobs or income 
last year. 
The House Democrats’ bill is just 
simply not the right approach. That is 
what editorial pages across the polit-
ical spectrum say. That is what even 
liberal economists say. And that is 
what common sense tells us. 
Here is what the Senate is focused 
on: completing the annual Defense leg-
islation that looks after our brave men 
and women who volunteer to wear the 
uniform. We passed this legislation 59 
years in a row and, one way or another, 
we are going to complete the 60th an-
nual NDAA and pass it into law before 
this Congress concludes on Sunday. 
It is a serious responsibility, but it is 
also a tremendous opportunity to di-
rect our national security priorities to 
reflect the resolve of the American 
people and the evolving threats to 
their safety at home and abroad. It is 
our chance to recommit to research 
and development so that our 21st cen-
tury military is equipped to outmatch 
any adversary. It is our chance to en-
sure that we keep pace with competi-
tors like Russia and China. It is our 
chance to remind brave servicemem-
bers and their families that we have 
their backs with facilities, resources, 
and support benefiting the finest fight-
ing forces in the world. 
Over the past year, our colleagues on 
the Armed Services Committee have 
made sure the legislation delivers for 
our troops and for our Nation. Now it is 
time for us to deliver this bill.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 9051 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, I 
can’t remember the last time the Sen-
ate convened on New Year’s Day. I 
want to take this opportunity to wish 
all of my colleagues a happy new year. 
I want to thank the staff for having to 
come into work on New Year’s Day, 
and I want to bid good riddance to 2020. 
There can be no question that last 
year was a horrible year—as they have 
said in Britain, an ‘‘annus horribilis.’’ 
But as we begin the first year of this 
new decade, preparing to inaugurate a 
new President and inoculate the coun-
try against this virus, the American 
people have reason to hope. 
The Senate can start off this new 
year by adding to that sense of hope by 
sending $2,000 checks to struggling 
American families. The Senate can 
start off 2021 by really helping the 
American people. We can start off 2021 
by sending $2,000 checks to struggling 
American 
families 
to 
carry 
them 
through the darkest and final days of 
this pandemic. 
The votes today, on this uncommon 
New Year’s Day session, could be the 
last of the 116th Congress. That means 
that today is the last chance to take 
up and pass the House bill to provide 
$2,000 checks to the American people. If 
the Senate does not take action today, 
$2,000 checks will not become law be-
fore the end of Congress, and they will 
know that Leader MCCONNELL and the 
Republican majority have prevented 
them from getting the checks, plain 
and simple. 
This is the last chance—the last 
chance for a mother in Nashville, $4,000 
behind on the rent, whose water was 
shut off earlier this month. This is the 
last chance—the last chance for the 
medical receptionist in Macomb, $2,100 
behind on the rent, whose electricity 
was shut off in September, on her son’s 
third day of virtual kindergarten. The 
kid can’t go to school. This is the last 
chance for 12 million Americans who 
have fallen nearly $6,000 behind on rent 
and utility or the 26 million Americans 
who have had trouble putting food on 
the table—the last chance. 
Make no mistake about it, $600 has 
never been enough for them. This is the 
last chance to deliver $2,000 before a 
new Congress is sworn in and the legis-
lative process must start all over 
again. 
For once, we have progressive Demo-
crats, conservative Republicans, the 
President himself, and not to mention 
the majority—the vast majority—of 
the American people singing from the 
same songbook in support of these 
checks. We have a bill that has already 
passed the House. 
All we are asking for is a simple vote 
in the Senate. I, for one, am confident 
it would pass if given the chance, and 
that may be the real reason that Lead-
er MCCONNELL
and the Republicans 
don’t want to bring it up. We have had 
many opportunities this week to vote 
on the measure. Senator MCCONNELL 
has blocked every one of them. 
We have offered to vote on whatever 
unrelated issues the Republican leader 
says he wants to vote on, so long as we 
can get a clean vote on the House bill 
to provide $2,000 checks—the only way 
to actually make it happen in this 
year, in this session of Congress. That 
offer still stands. That offer still 
stands. But give us a vote. Give us a 
vote on the House bill. 
It is OK if the Republican leader op-
poses checks. It is OK if the majority 
of Republican Senators oppose the 
checks. They can make their case to 
the American people and oppose the 
bill, but let us vote. It is OK if the Re-
publican leader wants to call direct as-
sistance to American people ‘‘poorly 
targeted’’ and ‘‘socialism for the rich,’’ 
even after he drove the passage of a $2 
trillion across-the-board reduction in 
corporate taxes. But give us a vote. 
Make the argument. Let the Senate 
work its will. 
To me, it seems like the Republican 
leader is afraid to schedule a vote on 
$2,000 checks because he is afraid it will 
pass. What a terrifying thought that 
struggling Americans would get some 
money to feed their families, pay the 
rent, and get on with their lives; pay 
the utility bill of that kindergarten kid 
or third grade kid who can’t even go to 
school because his family can’t afford 
electricity. 
We have a chance—a chance at the 
end of this painful year and at the be-
ginning of a new one—to give Ameri-
cans reason for hope in 2021. The only 
thing standing in the way right now is 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Republican 
Senate majority. 
In a moment, I will ask consent for 
the final time that the Senate set a 
time for a vote on the House bill to 
provide $2,000 checks. I have done it 
every day this week. This is it, the last 
chance for the 116th Congress to pass 
$2,000 checks and to say to regular 
Americans: ‘‘Help is on the way.’’ 
Let’s have a vote. Let’s have a vote. 
Pass this bill. There is no better way to 
usher in the new year. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No. 
645, H.R. 9051, a bill to increase recov-
ery rebate amounts to $2,000 per indi-
viduals; that the bill be read a third 
time and the Senate vote on passage; 
and if passed, that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The assistant majority leader. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object—and let me say, 
through the Chair, thank you to the 
Senator from New York and the Sen-
ator from Vermont, the Senator from 
Illinois, and others here for the oppor-
tunity to spend New Year’s with them. 
I know that has always been something 
that has been on my bucket list— 
maybe not on top of the bucket list. 
But, nevertheless, thank you for that 
opportunity. It does feel like a long 
time ago, but it was, actually, only—if 
you can believe this—the beginning of 
last week when both sides of the aisle 
and both sides of the Capitol came to-
gether to pass a targeted, responsible, 
and necessary relief package, which be-
came law with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. It passed here in the 
Senate 92 to 6. Members on both sides 
of the aisle, myself included, have dem-
onstrated that we are willing to dedi-
cate resources to those who are strug-
gling during this pandemic. 
The problem with what is being put 
forward—the House-passed CASH Act— 
is that it is not targeted to help those 
who are the most in need. I will just 
point out that it is not just our saying 
that; even the Washington Post edi-
torial board called it ‘‘one last bad 
idea’’ for 2020. It singled out as ‘‘espe-
cially wrongheaded’’ the efforts of the 
progressive left to depict this ‘‘as aid 
to ‘desperate’ Americans despite the 
huge amounts’’—this is the Wash-
ington Post’s term—‘‘destined for per-
fectly comfortable families.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7997 
January 1, 2021 
As others here on the floor have 
noted, the bill would provide a pay-
ment to a family of five making up to 
$350,000. A family of five making 
$250,000 would receive a $5,000 benefit. 
Just to put that in perspective, that is 
more than was paid to a middle-class 
family of five under the CARES Act 
that we passed back in March. In addi-
tion, the bill would add an additional 
$463 billion—nearly half a trillion dol-
lars—to the annual debt. 
Again, it is all money we have to bor-
row. All of this is money we have to 
borrow, and that is more than the first 
two economic impact payments com-
bined. Put that in perspective, and 
think of other ways you could use that 
amount of money. The truth is that 
those types of sums could potentially 
be spent in many more targeted ways, 
but our colleagues on the Democratic 
side don’t even want to debate some of 
those alternatives. 
Allowing small businesses a second 
draw from the Paycheck Protection 
Program would cost, approximately, 
$285 billion. For the cost of the CASH 
Act, we could do another round of as-
sistance to help small businesses keep 
their employees on the payrolls and 
still have almost $200 billion left over. 
The expanded unemployment bene-
fits—signed into law last week—will 
cost approximately $120 billion for 11 
additional weeks. That means, for the 
same cost as this proposal, we could 
provide an additional 40 weeks—10 
months—of enhanced unemployment 
insurance benefits to those who have 
lost their jobs. 
This is simply not targeted relief for 
the people who need it the most, and 
those who say that we should just vote 
on this flawed House bill conveniently 
leave out the fact that they do not 
want us to amend it to make it better 
in order to deliver more assistance to 
the people who are hurting the most. 
Again, I will just point out one last 
time that it has been less than a week, 
really, since the Senate voted and the 
President signed into law a proposal 
negotiated, 
literally, 
over 
months. 
Every fine point of that proposal was 
negotiated, and it was signed into law 
to provide targeted, fiscally respon-
sible assistance to the people of this 
country who need it the most. This 
proposal is a shotgun approach, where 
a rifle makes a lot more sense. 
If you really want to help people who 
need this the most, at a time when we 
are running a $26 trillion debt and are 
borrowing every penny that we are 
making available to do this, we ought 
to sit down and figure out how to do it 
in the most efficient, effective, tar-
geted way possible. This, absolutely, 
does not do that. When you have a fam-
ily who is making $350,000 a year in 
this country getting up to thousands of 
dollars of payments and a family mak-
ing $250,000 a year in this country get-
ting, under this proposal, a $5,000 
check, I would argue that it is not tar-
geted, that it is not fiscally respon-
sible, that it is not efficient, and that 
it is not an effective way to spend the 
American taxpayers’ dollars. 
Let’s help the people who need it the 
most. We just passed and signed into 
law a proposal that does that. I think 
many of us on this side of the aisle are 
willing to look at other ideas and 
things that we could do that would 
help these people more, but this is cer-
tainly not it, so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority—excuse me. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Someday soon. 
(Laughter.) 
Mr. President, the only thing I would 
say, through the Chair, to my friend 
from South Dakota is that the many 
proposals he proposed as alternatives 
to our proposal are those to which the 
Republican majority objected when we 
had our negotiations on the CARES 
bill. We believe this can be in addition 
to the expansion of unemployment in-
surance and other things. Given the 
state of the economy, that is what is 
needed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 9051 AND S. 5085 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
say to my friend, Senator THUNE, that 
I certainly concur with you as to what 
a pleasure it is to be spending New 
Year’s Day with you and our col-
leagues. It is exactly what I, I know, 
and every other Member here wanted 
to do, but here we are because we have 
to be here. We are here because, back 
home in my State and all over this 
country, millions and millions of fami-
lies are struggling to put food on the 
table. They are struggling to pay their 
rent. They are struggling to come up 
with the money they need to go to the 
doctor. 
This hits me, in a sense, in a personal 
way. The other day, I received a letter 
from a colleague of mine in Burlington, 
VT, where I live—the largest city in 
the State of Vermont, all of 40,000 peo-
ple. He wrote to me, reporting on a 
food drive in Burlington, VT, where I 
live: 
Over 30 volunteers showed up to the Cham-
plain School to help bag groceries and to 
hand them out to those who came out. Un-
fortunately, there was not nearly enough do-
nated food to provide a bag to everyone who 
showed up despite us planning on an in-
creased need. The line of cars filled the park-
ing lot, wrapped around the school, and went 
out onto the main road for half a mile. This 
represented a major up-tick for the October 
event that we were involved in. 
This was in Burlington, VT, with 
hundreds of cars lining up for emer-
gency food and the volunteers not hav-
ing enough food to distribute. They had 
to say to the families who were trying 
to feed their kids: Sorry. We do not 
have enough food. 
So what we are doing today is very 
simple, and that is that Senator 
THUNE, Senator MCCONNELL, and others 
have raised objection to the House- 
passed bill. In the U.S. Senate, when 
we have differences of opinion, what we 
should be doing is debating that bill. 
So all that Senator SCHUMER is asking 
and all that I am asking is simple: 
Bring the bill to the floor. We are not 
even asking you to vote for it. Bring 
the bill to the floor. On top of every-
thing else, we need 60 votes to pass it— 
60 votes. Can we get 60 votes? I don’t 
know. I think virtually all of the 48 
Democrats will vote for it. 
It means, Senator THUNE, that we 
need 12 Republicans. I gather we have 
one right here who indicated he would 
vote for it, and five or six others have 
been public about saying they will vote 
for it. Will we get the rest? I don’t 
know. You don’t know. What is the 
problem with giving Members of the 
U.S. Senate the opportunity to vote on 
the legislation? When we have that de-
bate, you can come up and raise all of 
your objections, and we can debate it. 
Now, I heard Senator THUNE and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL before him talk about 
this bill being socialism for the rich, 
which I have to tell you I find some-
what hysterical because that is an 
issue I have been talking about for 
many, many years. I am very delighted 
that 
my 
conservative 
Republican 
friends now recognize that we do have 
socialism for the rich. To paraphrase 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he said we 
live in a society where we have social-
ism for the rich and rugged individ-
ualism for the poor. King was right. 
Despite what my Republican col-
leagues are saying, the truth is that, 
according to the Tax Policy Center, the 
top 
5 
percent 
of 
Americans—the 
wealthiest people in our country— 
would receive less than 1 percent of the 
benefits of these direct payments—less 
than 1 percent. It doesn’t sound, to me, 
like too much socialism for the rich. 
While we are on the subject of social-
ism for the rich, which my Republican 
friends have suddenly become very con-
cerned about, let me talk about the 
Trump tax proposal that was pushed 
very hard by Senator MCCONNELL and 
the Republican leadership and that, I 
think, every Republican voted for. Do 
you want to talk about socialism for 
the rich? It is not the bill that puts 
$2,000 into working-class hands all over 
this country. That isn’t socialism for 
the rich. This is socialism for the rich. 
In that bill, Amazon—oh, by the way, I 
must say this, if I may: We were 
quoting the liberal Washington Post, 
owned by Jeff Bezos—the wealthiest 
guy in the world. So here is Jeff Bezos’ 
company, Amazon, and they received a 
tax rebate. They paid nothing in 2018 in 
Federal taxes. That is a corrupt tax 
system to begin with, but then, on top 
of that, they received $129 million as a 
tax rebate. 
That, Senator THUNE, is socialism for 
the rich. In fact, this particular com-
pany is owned by the richest guy in the 
world, and you gave him a $129 million 
rebate, but it is not just Amazon.

Delta Air Lines also paid nothing in 
Federal taxes in 2018; yet they received 
a $187 million rebate from that par-
ticular bill. Chevron, in helping to de-
stroy our planet with their carbon 
emissions, received $181 million in a re-
bate. 
That, my friends, is what socialism 
for the rich is about. Socialism for the 
rich is not—in the midst of this ter-
rible pandemic—putting $2,000 checks 
into the hands of working families. 
The truth of the matter is, as a result 
of this pandemic, we are living through 
the worst and most difficult economic 
period since the Great Depression. Tens 
of millions of families are facing evic-
tion all over this country—in the 
wealthiest Nation on Earth. Moms are 
struggling to feed their kids, keep the 
electricity on, and be able to go to the 
doctor. 
Now, I hear from my Republican 
friends that the economy is doing bet-
ter, but I would like to just read to 
them a few of the stories that I have 
received in my office. We asked people 
a simple question: How are you doing 
out there, and what is going on in your 
lives? We received many, many thou-
sands of responses from people in every 
State in this country. I will read a few 
just to bring some dose of reality here 
to the U.S. Senate, which often, in the 
midst of all of the campaign contribu-
tions coming in from the rich, does not 
know what is going on in the real 
world. 
Here is the real world. 
A gentleman in Texas wrote: 
$2,000 is the difference between keeping our 
apartment and being evicted. 
A mother in Virginia wrote: 
$2,000 means I can afford to feed my three 
kids. 
Now, maybe we should give her a 
long lecture on macroeconomics and 
how well the stock market is doing, 
but all she is worried about is feeding 
her three children. 
A woman in Wisconsin wrote: 
$2,000 would mean not having to choose be-
tween rent and groceries and not having to 
ration my partner’s meds. 
A woman in Nevada wrote: 
[It means] paying my rent and getting life-
saving treatment because I can’t afford the 
$50 co-pay through my work insurance just 
to see my neurologist right now. 
A father in Florida wrote: 
It would mean I could pay my bills. My 
electricity and phone are about to get shut 
off. I didn’t have money for my son on 
Christmas, and I won’t have money for his 
birthday on January 2. 
A father in New Jersey wrote: 
It would mean I could pay off credit card 
debt accumulated during this pandemic, feed 
my children, and pay my bills. 
A parent in Massachusetts wrote: 
It would mean that I could pay my rent 
and electricity and put food on the table. 
A woman in Missouri wrote: 
It would mean getting out of crushing 
debt. It would mean survival without daily 
fear. 
Someone in Texas wrote: 
It would mean I could actually put food in 
the fridge. 
A man in Maryland wrote: 
It would mean I don’t have to beg or go 
without food, shelter, and medicine. It would 
mean my family stays warm another couple 
of months and my dad gets proper treat-
ment. 
Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. SANDERS. I would. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask a 
question of the Senator from Vermont 
through the Chair. 
I have listened to the Republican 
analysis of the bill, which you and Sen-
ator SCHUMER are asking for a vote on. 
It is a bill which passed the House and 
would give $2,000, basically, in allot-
ments or payments to families across 
America, with certain income restric-
tions. 
And I have heard from the other side 
of the aisle, repeatedly, that this is so-
cialism for the rich, that this is fun-
damentally unfair, and that we should 
do things in a targeted way. That is the 
argument that is made over and over 
again. 
And reference has been made repeat-
edly to the COVID–19 bill that passed 
last week with 92 votes, including 
many of the Republicans—virtually all 
of them. Not all of them but virtually 
all of them. 
And so that bill, if I remember cor-
rectly, had a $600 payment included in 
the bill, and I asked my staff: Would 
you please analyze the formula for dis-
tributing the $600 and compare to it 
the formula for the $2,000, which is part 
of our bill. 
And lo and behold, they discovered it 
is the same formula. So if there is some 
fundamental, moral injustice in the 
distribution of these funds, then I am 
afraid all but six of the Republicans are 
guilty of the same immorality because 
they all voted for that formula last 
week when it was $600 and now are 
scandalized by the notion that the 
same formula they voted for would be 
used for a $2,000 payment. 
I am sure I have missed something in 
the translation here. I would like to 
ask the Senator from Vermont to ex-
plain this faux outrage from the Re-
publican side of the aisle. 
Mr. SANDERS. Well, I think my 
friend from Illinois missed nothing in 
the translation. He is exactly right. 
But I also— 
Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Illi-
nois makes a good point. 
Would the Senator yield for a ques-
tion? 
Mr. SANDERS. Yes. 
Mr. THUNE. So if the same formula 
is used, and you are increasing the 
amount by $1,400 per person—so you 
are going from, basically, for a family 
of four, what would be a $2,400 payment 
to an $8,000 payment, and you phase 
that down using the same formula, 
does the Senator from Illinois under-
stand the math and why that skews to-
ward people who make a lot more 
money than they would under the 
other formula? 
Mr. DURBIN. If the question is di-
rected toward me, I will answer it. 
Mr. THUNE. Well, I just think that 
you are making a point in the state-
ment which is not accurate because 
you are saying the formula is the same. 
The formula is the same, but the in-
puts change, and so the way it ramps 
down means that somebody who makes 
$350,000 gets a payment under the 
Sanders-Hawley proposal that they 
wouldn’t—but they wouldn’t—no, and 
it phases out a lot sooner, as you know. 
So let’s be clear about how that for-
mula works. You are misrepresenting 
the way that formula works. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont has the floor. 
Mr. SANDERS. Thank you very 
much, Mr. President. 
I would ask my friend from South 
Dakota: Do you disagree with the Tax 
Policy Center, which says that the top 
5 percent of Americans—the wealthiest 
people in our country—would receive 
less than 1 percent of the total benefits 
being disbursed? 
Mr. THUNE. I have not seen the Tax 
Policy Center, but I know math, and I 
know as a basic principle that when 
you stick bigger numbers in there and 
you are using the same formula to 
phase something out, you are going to 
make it available to people who make 
a lot more money. That is a mathe-
matical fact. 
And what you are saying, when you 
talk about the same formula, it skews 
entirely different in the income scale, 
and you know that. 
And all I am saying is don’t mis-
represent the facts. 
Mr. SANDERS. And all that I am 
saying is that, according to a very rep-
utable tax center organization—people 
who do this for a living—less than 1 
percent of the benefits of the entire 
program go to the wealthiest people in 
this country. 
So when you are talking about trying 
to say: Oh my God, all of this money is 
going to the rich, that ain’t really 
true. 
But I would also ask my friend: When 
did you suddenly become a religious 
adherent about concerns of socialism 
for the rich, when you gave 83 percent 
of the benefits for the rich and large 
corporations in the tax bill that you 
supported? Where was your concern 
about socialism for the rich when Ama-
zon—owned by the richest guy in the 
world—got a $129 million tax rebate? I 
didn’t hear much about socialism for 
the rich during that debate. 
Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator from 
Vermont allow me to respond to that 
question? 
Mr. SANDERS. Yes. 
Mr. THUNE. Well, very simply, what 
you are suggesting—what you are say-
ing here is that the owner of the Wash-
ington Post, who said this is really bad 
policy and shouldn’t be done in this 
way at the end of this year—is that 
what you are saying? That because he 
is a wealthy person, that somehow that 
is why he is making that statement?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7999 
January 1, 2021 
Mr. SANDERS. The wealthiest in the 
world. 
Mr. THUNE. I think the Washington 
Post editorial board, in most cases, has 
been very sympathetic to the argument 
of the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. That is factually in-
accurate. 
Mr. THUNE. In fact, they take a lib-
eral point of view on almost every 
issue. 
My point, very simply, is that we 
have a limited amount of resources. 
This is borrowed money, as the Senator 
from Vermont knows. And when we 
spent months—literally months—and 
you ask: Why can’t you guys just come 
down here, why can’t you just come 
down here and debate this, we tried for 
months to get the Democrats down 
here to debate a bill. We put a bill on 
the floor in September, we put a bill on 
the floor in October, a coronavirus re-
lief bill, and you guys blocked it. You 
didn’t even want to talk about it. You 
didn’t want to have an opportunity to 
amend it. 
We have been working at this for 
months, and we finally arrived, after 
months, at a proposal that helps people 
who need it the most, including nutri-
tion assistance, including rental assist-
ance, and including checks to people— 
Mr. SANDERS. Reclaiming my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. All that I am say-
ing—all that I am saying—this is a 
great debate, John. We should have 
this debate, and in 2 minutes—in 2 min-
utes, John, I am going to give you the 
opportunity to say you support what 
we are doing, and then we will have 
this debate. That is your opportunity. 
But I want to get back—the Senator 
from South Dakota did not answer the 
question that it was not, apparently, a 
huge concern about socialism for the 
rich in the bill that they supported or 
worried about the debt that would 
incur. 
So I see, if I may say so, a bit of hy-
pocrisy here. Senator THUNE and the 
Republican leadership want to debate 
this issue, and so do I. I think it is a 
great debate—great debate. 
Now, as everybody knows, Senator 
MCCONNELL proposed an idea. I don’t 
agree with it, but it is an idea that is 
worthy of debate and discussion, and 
he said: Let’s combine three elements 
together. Let’s incorporate the bill 
passed in the House by two-thirds of 
the House, including 44 Republicans; 
let’s add to that the repeal of section 
230 of the Telecommunications Act; 
and let’s also add to that, at President 
Trump’s request, an issue about voter 
integrity, et cetera, et cetera. 
OK. That is what Senator MCCON-
NELL proposed. 
And in one moment, I am going to 
bring—because 
I 
know 
Republicans 
think I don’t do much for them and I 
am not concerned about them—but, 
Senator THUNE, I am going to bring 
your bill to the floor. Show you what a 
nice guy I am. New year, I am going to 
bring Senator MCCONNELL’s bill right 
to the floor and give you an oppor-
tunity to vote for it. 
All that I am asking, while I bring 
Senator MCCONNELL’s Republican bill 
to the floor, we are going to bring the 
bill that passed the House, with 44 Re-
publicans, to the floor as well. 
We will have two votes: One vote on 
Senator MCCONNELL’s bill, which needs 
60 votes to pass; one vote on the House 
bill, 60 votes to pass. That is it. 
So it is hard for me to imagine how 
Senator THUNE will object to us bring-
ing forward the Republican bill. 
Here it goes. This is the legalese that 
I need to say and I am going to bring it 
forth and I am sure that Senator 
THUNE will support me in my effort. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that if cloture is invoked on the 
veto message on H.R. 6395, National 
Defense Authorization Act, that not-
withstanding rule XXII, at 3 p.m. 
today—short period of time—3 p.m. 
today, Friday, January 1, the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 645, H.R. 9051, to provide a 
$2,000 direct payment to the working 
class; that the bill be considered read a 
third time and the Senate vote on pas-
sage of the bill; and that if passed, the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; further, 
that following the vote on H.R. 9051, 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of Calendar No. 644, S. 5085; that 
the bill be considered read a third time; 
that there be 1 hour of debate on the 
bill, equally divided and controlled by 
myself or my designee and Senator 
MCCONNELL or his designee; that fol-
lowing the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on passage of the 
bill; and that if passed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, all without intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I want 
to say that I can’t, for the life of me, 
figure out why it is so difficult to get 
a vote on the bills that Senator SAND-
ERS has just referenced, when, by my 
count, the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the House, a 
large majority of the House of Rep-
resentatives, and I think a super-
majority of this body are all in favor— 
all in favor—of $2,000 COVID relief pay-
ments to working Americans. 
Now, we have had some back-and- 
forth on the floor today about how we 
got to the level of $2,000. We all know 
how we got to that level. The President 
of the United States said that is the 
level he supported. The number origi-
nates with him. This is the number 
that he has asked for and the House 
adopted it and a majority of Senators 
have said already publicly that they 
support it. 
And yet we can’t seem to even get a 
vote on it. We can’t even seem to have 
debate on it. 
I mean, with all due respect, this 
doesn’t seem, to me, to be a Repub-
licans versus Democrats issue; this 
seems to be the Senate versus the 
United States of America and I just 
don’t understand it and I am willing to 
bet—I am willing to bet that the Amer-
ican people don’t understand it either. 
I mean, here we are, in the throes of 
the worst pandemic in a century, that 
working people have borne the brunt 
of, and all that we are asking is that 
those working people be first in line for 
relief and that they be given meaning-
ful relief that is only approximately 
commensurate with the hardships that 
they and their families have borne. 
Now, I hear a lot of talk about how 
we can’t afford it. I do notice, however, 
that we seem to be able to afford all 
kinds of other stuff. We can afford to 
send lots of money to other govern-
ments. We can afford to send all kinds 
of tax breaks and bailouts to big cor-
porations. We can afford to spend enor-
mous sums of money on pork—hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in that last 
bill on pork—hundreds of billions. But 
we can’t seem to find the money for re-
lief for working people that the Presi-
dent and the House and the Senate all 
support, and yet we can’t seem to get 
it onto the floor. 
Let me just share three stories that I 
have heard just this week alone—this 
week alone—from my home State, 
from Missouri. 
Danielle, from St. Louis County, 
called my office. She said her utilities 
are about to be shut off. She is des-
perate for help. She said a $2,000 pay-
ment would go a long way to help keep 
the lights on and her house warm. 
I heard from a mother in Southeast 
Missouri. That is the bootheel of my 
State. She wrote that her son had lost 
pay because of his company’s cutting 
back hours because of COVID and that 
he himself had contracted the virus 
and so he had to be home and he was 
missing work, missing shifts. His fam-
ily can’t make it paycheck to pay-
check. Her daughter-in-law is donating 
plasma in order to help earn some 
extra grocery money—donating plasma 
in order to get some money to pay for 
groceries to feed their family. 
Richard from St. Louis wrote to me 
and said any extra help that he could 
get would go directly to paying his 
rent and his utilities. He had a job that 
he lost, in the retail business, the re-
tail sector, and he is desperately strug-
gling. 
I would state to the Presiding Officer 
that these people are not ne’er-do- 
wells. These are working people. These 
are strong people. These are proud peo-
ple. And all they ask for, as I have said 
many times on this floor before, is a 
chance to get back on their feet and to 
be able to provide for their families. 
And I can’t for the life of me under-
stand why we cannot get so much as a 
vote on these bills. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I do 
not object. In fact, I enthusiastically 
support the measures that Senator

SANDERS is trying to bring to the floor, 
and I would vote for both if we were 
given the opportunity. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserv-

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—VETO—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the veto message 
on H.R. 6395, which the clerk will re-
port. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Veto message, a bill (H.R. 6395) to author-
ize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for 
military activities of the Department of De-
fense, for military construction, and for de-
fense activities of the Department of Energy, 
to prescribe military personnel strengths for 
such fiscal year, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, these 
are the last few words that Senator 
REED and I will say before the vote, 
and I want to mention something that 
I haven’t talked about as much as I 
probably should have. 
First of all, the cooperation and 
working with Senator REED and his 
staff—this is a long enduring thing. It 
is hard for people to believe, but we are 
actually starting on next year’s bill 
now. We have already started. 
I thought I would mention something 
that hasn’t been talked about as much 
as it should have been talked about 
since we have suffered arguably the 
worst cyber attack in American his-
tory. This is the most significant piece 
of cyber legislation in American his-
tory. It contains 27 of our Cyberspace 
Solarium 
Commission 
recommenda-
tions. All 27 are in this NDAA, to in-
clude provisions that are directly rel-
evant to the SolarWinds attack that 
would have allowed us to get ahead of 
this—most notably by allowing deci-
sive cyber security measures in DHS to 
begin hunting for threats on dot-gov 
networks. 
We have other recommendations to 
enhance our cyber resilience for our 
nuclear command and control systems 
in this NDAA. Establishing a national 
cyber 
director 
is 
in 
the 
NDAA, 
strengthening the size and elevating 
his leadership, giving him more re-
sources. I fear that the SolarWinds at-
tack is a harbinger of things to come. 
I am very proud of the work our Com-
mission has done, and the provisions 
are absolutely critical. 
The final thing I would say is that 
this is arguably the most serious piece 
of legislation when it comes to deter-
ring China that we have had in dec-
ades, if not ever, including provisions 
such as the Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive. This is kind of a followup to last 
year’s European Deterrence Initiative, 
where we are concentrating more on 
Russia, but this is specific to China. 
That is what the whole division of 
this bill is about—to enhance our pres-
ence and our deterrence posture in the 
INDOPACOM provisions for protecting 
against Chinese industrial espionage, 
more transparency for Chinese mili-
tary companies, reporting on Chinese 
United Front Work Department in the 
United States and abroad, and the list 
goes on and on. It is a very serious 
piece of legislation when it comes to 
deterring China. That is one of the 
things we are concerned about. China 
is our No. 1 threat and will be for per-
haps, regrettably, decades to come. So 
this bill brings us along to where we 
should be. 
Once again, I want to say thanks for 
the effort that has gone into this bill, 
the weekends, the hard work. LIZ CHE-
NEY and John Bonsell, I have to say, 
along with JACK REED—they probably 
worked more weekends than they have 
not worked weekends. So it has been a 
real effort. 
It is the most important and signifi-
cant piece of legislation that we will 
pass, and this next vote is a very crit-
ical vote. 
I will yield to Senator REED for any 
comments he would like to make about 
this. Keep in mind that this is a real— 
people talk about how the Democrats 
and Republicans don’t do things to-
gether. This has been an example of 
what can happen in government. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me first 
begin by commending the chairman for 
his extraordinary efforts. He led this 
process, let there be no mistake about 
it. He rose to the challenges. This is 
the most challenging NDAA for so 
many different reasons—because of the 
pandemic, 
the 
need 
for 
social 
distancing in terms of hearings, the 
whole scope of challenges that have 
arisen in the past few months—and the 
chairman has done a remarkable job. 
Let me start by saying that this is 
essential for our national security. 
This bill is not optional. If we want to 
continue to maintain our security for 
the United States, we have to pass this 
legislation. It is that simple. 
What does it do? Well, it does things 
that we have to do every year. One, it 
provides for the support of our service 
men and women. I know we are all 
celebrating New Year’s Day here. It is 
kind of disconcerting to be working 
when everyone else is partying, but if 
you feel a little bit put upon, think 
about the soldiers in forward operating 
bases in Afghanistan who are facing 
danger. Think about the ballistic sub-
mariners protecting the United States. 
Think about the airmen who flew the 
B–52 bombers. Think about them and 
their families, and I think you will ap-
preciate more what they do every day 
and what we do once in a while. 
One of the issues that the chairman 
spoke about is how cyber security is es-
sential. We based our efforts on an in-
sightful report by the Cyber Solarium 
Commission, headed by Senator ANGUS 
KING and Congressman MIKE GALLA-
GHER. 
Every day, we are learning more 
about the Russian penetration of our 
whole national security apparatus and 
civilian companies. Just today, Micro-
soft announced that they have been 
deeply penetrated by the Russian in-
trusion, and I suspect it is very serious. 
This legislation was done, remark-
ably, before we knew of such an intru-
sion and responds specifically to this 
type of cyber breach on the United 
States. It gives the Department of 
Homeland Security the authority to 
audit other agencies in terms of their 
cyber security and take other steps to 
hunt for threats. It is just the first 
step, but if we don’t take this step, we 
will be further behind. 
Now, the other thing I want to point 
out, too, is echoing what the chairman 
said about the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative. We have identified $2 billion 
that can be used—and we will focus 
upon how it is used—to create a new 
strategy. This is really the first time 
that we have stepped back and said: 
Let’s set up a strategic posture that 
recognizes the true threats that China 
is now presenting to us in the Pacific. 
This is the first time we have done 
this. 
What it does is it builds on our close 
relationships 
with 
key 
allies—Aus-
tralia, Japan, South Korea. It does that 
by a series of steps—first, through 
command post exercises where we test 
our communications; second, real exer-
cises. With these steps, we are building 
to a point where large-scale joint exer-
cises involving not only our key allies 
but other partners become possible. 
That will set us up for the ability to 
deter China. When they see all of the 
nations of the Pacific that have worked 
with us closely and that are prepared 
to work with us, that will be a great 
deterrence. That is the goal of this ef-
fort. So any suggestion that China is 
happy about this bill is completely 
baseless. 
Then finally, again, like the chair-
man, I must thank the staff, John 
Bonsell and Elizabeth King and the 
staff and all the Members. Again, my 
congratulations to the chairman for 
his great work. 
I urge passage. Again, I think this is 
essential. As I said before, there are 
thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
marines, and coastguardsmen who are

on the watch as we speak. It is our ob-
ligation to them to give them the tools 
they need to protect us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. I suggest that this is 
the most significant bill we have 
passed in the last 59 years. 
Mr. President, I would ask unani-
mous consent that the mandatory 
quorum call be waived with respect to 
the motion to invoke cloture on the 
veto message on H.R. 6395, the NDAA. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the veto 
message on H.R. 6395, a bill to authorize ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2021 for military 
activities of the Department of Defense, for 
military construction, and for defense activi-
ties of the Department of Energy to pre-
scribe military personnel strengths for such 
fiscal year, and for other purposes. 
Mitch McConnell, James M. Inhofe, Todd 
Young, John Cornyn, Cindy Hyde- 
Smith, Mike Braun, Deb Fischer, John 
Barrasso, Roger F. Wicker, Richard 
Burr, Pat Roberts, Shelley Moore Cap-
ito, Mitt Romney, Susan M. Collins, 
Richard C. Shelby, Thom Tillis, Lamar 
Alexander. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-
imous consent, the mandatory quorum 
call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the veto mes-
sage on H.R. 6395, a bill to authorize 
appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for 
military activities of the Department 
of Defense, for military construction, 
and for defense activities of the De-
partment of Energy, to prescribe mili-
tary personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes, shall be 
brought to a close? 
The yeas and nays are mandatory 
under the rule. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Arkansas (Mr. COTTON), the Sen-
ator from Texas (Mr. CRUZ), the Sen-
ator from Colorado (Mr. GARDNER), the 
Senator from South Carolina (Mr. GRA-
HAM), the Senator from Georgia (Mrs. 
LOEFFLER), the Senator from Georgia 
(Mr. PERDUE), and the Senator from 
Nebraska (Mr. SASSE). 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Alabama (Mr. JONES) is 
necessarily absent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there 
any other Senators in the Chamber de-
siring to vote?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are 
going to go on to final passage, and I 
just want to make one comment that 
this is a really significant vote, not 
just because it is the NDAA and many 
of us contend, as I do, every year that 
the NDAA is the most significant vote 
that we have, but this year especially 
so in light of all the disruptions and 
problems that we have had. 
Once again, I want to say how great 
it has been to work and show the 
American people that Democrats and 
Republicans can work together and get 
significant legislation passed. I am 
very proud that we had this bill, and I 
am proud to have worked with Senator 
REED and his staff. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, this legis-
lation is central to the national secu-
rity of the United States and to the 
welfare of the troops and their families 
who defend us every day. 
I would urge all my colleagues to 
vote to override the veto. 
I want to thank Senator INHOFE for 
his leadership and congratulate John 
Bonsell on the Republican side and Liz 
King on the Democratic side. 
Again, I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote for this bill. 
I yield the floor.

jority leader.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any further debate? 
If not, the question is, Shall the bill 
(H.R. 6395) pass, the objections of the 
President of the United States to the 
contrary notwithstanding?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8002 
January 1, 2021 
having been read and spread upon the 
Journal in full and that the message be 
printed in the RECORD. 
The veto message is ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD as follows: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
I am returning, without my approval, 
S. 906, the Driftnet Modernization and 
Bycatch Reduction Act. America’s fish-
ermen have made great sacrifices to 
ensure that our Nation’s marine fish-
eries are a sustainable economic engine 
for coastal communities. Under my Ad-
ministration, the number of United 
States fish stocks subject to over-
fishing is at a historic low. This 
achievement is the result of a trans-
parent and collaborative regulatory 
process that is supported by regional 
fishery management councils. At coun-
cil meetings, fishermen work with Fed-
eral Government and State govern-
ment representatives to meet their 
statutory obligations under the Mag-
nuson-Stevens 
Fishery 
Conservation 
and Management Act. 
In passing S. 906, the Congress has ig-
nored the fact that the regional fishery 
management process has had strong, 
bipartisan support since its creation. 
By forcing the West Coast drift gillnet 
fishery to use alternative gear that has 
not been proven to be an economically 
viable substitute for gillnets, the Con-
gress is effectively terminating the 
fishery. As a result, an estimated 30 
fishing vessels, all of which are oper-
ated by family-owned small businesses, 
will no longer be able to bring their 
bounty to shore. At a time when our 
Nation has a seafood trade deficit of 
nearly $17 billion, S. 906 will exacerbate 
this imbalance. 
Further, S. 906 will not achieve its 
purported conservation benefits. The 
West Coast drift gillnet fishery is sub-
ject to robust legal and regulatory re-
quirements for environmental protec-
tion that equal or exceed the environ-
mental protections that apply to for-
eign fisheries. Without this fishery, 
Americans will import more swordfish 
and other species from foreign sources 
that frequently have more bycatch 
than our own fisheries. If the Congress 
wants to address bycatch, it should in-
sist on a level playing field for im-
ported seafood instead of crushing 
American fishing families. 
My Administration has done more for 
American fishermen than any Presi-
dent before me. On May 7, 2020, I signed 
an Executive Order on Promoting 
American Seafood Competitiveness and 
Economic Growth to bolster our do-
mestic seafood industry while curbing 
illegal, unreported, and unregulated 
fishing abroad. On June 5, 2020, I issued 
a 
Proclamation 
on 
Modifying 
the 
Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Ma-
rine National Monument to open it to 
commercial fishing that is conducted 
in accordance with the Magnuson-Ste-
vens Act and other applicable laws, 
regulations, and requirements. And as 
fishermen struggled to stay on the 
water during the pandemic, I issued a 
Memorandum on Protecting the United 
States Lobster Industry and later made 
approximately $530 million available, 
through the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s Seafood Trade Relief Pro-
gram, to support the United States sea-
food industry and fishermen affected 
by retaliatory tariffs from foreign gov-
ernments. 
My Administration would support 
provisions of the enrolled bill, if passed 
separately, which would authorize fee 
collection in a different fishery—the 
Pacific Halibut fishery. This authority 
is needed to implement a provision of 
the International Pacific Halibut Com-
mission 
Convention, 
to 
which 
the 
United States is a party. However, for 
the sake of American fishermen na-
tionwide, I will not let the Congress 
circumvent the fisheries management 
process by effectively terminating a 
fishery without appropriate consulta-
tion and input from fishery manage-
ment councils. If this occurred, it 
would increase our reliance on im-
ported seafood and take away the live-
lihoods of hard-working Americans and 
their family businesses. It is my duty 
to return S. 906 to the Senate without 
my approval. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.

MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time 
has come to declare victory and come 
home from the war in Afghanistan—the 
longest war in the history of our coun-
try. 
Over 4,000 Americans have died fight-
ing in Afghanistan, and over 20,000 
have been wounded. It is time to bring 
our soldiers home. 
After the 9/11 attacks, I supported 
going into Afghanistan. We were abso-
lutely justified in rooting out the 
Taliban who harbored al-Qaida. 
Had I been in Congress at that time, 
I would have voted in favor of going 
into Afghanistan. 
But the people who attacked us on 9/ 
11 have all been killed or captured. 
They are long gone. But we are still 
there. 
Most of the people fighting us in Af-
ghanistan today are the successors or 
children or the children of their chil-
dren. 
The cycle shows no sign of ending. 
The war shows no sign of ending. It is 
not sustainable to keep fighting in Af-
ghanistan generation after generation. 
Here is some perspective: We have 
been fighting in Afghanistan for so 
long that when the 9/11 attacks hap-
pened, our youngest soldiers fighting 
there today weren’t even born yet. 
American fathers who fought in Af-
ghanistan are now watching as their 
sons fight in Afghanistan. 
We have spent about $1 trillion to es-
tablish an Afghan government—a gov-
ernment that is rife with corruption 
and dysfunction. It is a government 
that cannot perform much of any gov-
ernment function on its own. So we 
spend more to do for them what they 
still cannot do for themselves. 
A trillion dollars and we have hardly 
progressed from where we started. 
Yet instead of outrage—which is how 
most 
Americans 
feel—the 
reaction 
from Congress is, gosh, maybe let’s 
spend a trillion more. 
After World War II, much of Europe 
was reduced to rubble. It was utterly 
destroyed. 
So 
we 
rebuilt 
Europe 
through the Marshall Plan. 
We have now spent many times more 
to rebuild Afghanistan than we did 
under the Marshall Plan. What has 
that money gotten us? 
We have built infrastructure in Af-
ghanistan and then watched it deterio-
rate and watched the Afghans be un-
able to even maintain the infrastruc-
ture we built for them, and then they 
ask us for more money to maintain the 
structure. So we rebuild the infrastruc-
ture we just built for them. 
Meanwhile, our roads and our bridges 
here at home crumble as we spend mil-
lions upon millions to rebuild the in-
frastructure in Afghanistan. 
I want to walk through some exam-
ples of how our money has been used in 
Afghanistan. 
Several years ago, we reportedly 
hired a local security consultant to 
help secure road construction projects, 
at a cost of $1 million per year. But ac-
cording to the report by the Special In-
spector General for Afghanistan Recon-
struction, American officials came to 
suspect that the money was being fun-
neled to insurgents to stage attacks on 
our infrastructure, which could be used 
to justify the security contract. 
So our money was going to a guy who 
was apparently paying insurgents to 
stage attacks against him so he could 
justify his security contract. It is 
crazy. 
We spent $43 million on a natural 
gas, gas station. Guess how many vehi-
cles in Afghanistan run on natural gas. 
Zero. You can’t even find the gas sta-
tion. My staff actually went there to 
see how the money had been spent, and 
they were told they couldn’t go there 
because it was too unsafe. Now the re-
port is that the gas station has been 
abandoned—and with it $43 million 
flushed away. 
We spent nearly $80 million on a lux-
ury hotel. Why is the American tax-
payer building luxury hotels in Kabul? 
Guess what. It was abandoned halfway 
through. It is a skeleton. The Taliban 
are now said to climb up into the struc-
ture and shoot down at our Embassy. 
We spent about $400 million on equip-
ment and other things to create an Af-
ghan Army Corps of Engineers. Except

all the equipment we bought was lost. 
Gone. 
We spent hundreds of millions on 
electrification projects in Afghanistan, 
but the system wasn’t working. Af-
ghans didn’t understand that you had 
to pay for electricity and that you 
couldn’t climb up utility poles. So, we 
spent almost $2 million on a public 
awareness campaign to tell Afghans 
that they did, in fact, have to pay for 
electricity and to please stop climbing 
on the electrical wires. 
There 
was 
a 
multimillion-dollar 
highway project that also required $32 
million in community outreach. This is 
basically an attempt to help locals un-
derstand what is happening, since they 
have no experience with a giant high-
way or what it is for. 
The Special Inspector General for Af-
ghanistan 
Reconstruction 
examined 
this ‘‘community outreach’’ and found 
that one Regional Coordinator was 
given cash—$75,000—to help with out-
reach with locals, but SIGAR found 
that they could not account for the 
$75,000 which had been filed as used for 
‘‘goat distribution.’’ Now, I don’t know 
a lot about goats, but that seems like 
a lot of ‘‘goat’’ money. 
The guy giving out the goat money 
mysteriously disappeared. The inspec-
tor general reports that the money is 
unrecoverable. 
My subcommittee held an oversight 
hearing on Afghan war spending, and 
Ambassador Boucher, one of the wit-
nesses, recounted that the Afghan Fi-
nance Minister told him 80 to 90 per-
cent of the money Congress approves 
disappears before it gets to Afghani-
stan. It is not just corruption. He said: 
You know, we hire a contractor who 
hires a subcontractor, who hires a 
bunch of consultants, who hires a 
bunch of security personnel, who flies 
in airplanes, etc. And by the time you 
get somebody on the ground in Afghan-
istan receiving a benefit, it is a very 
small portion of all those billions and 
billions of dollars that Congress allo-
cated for whatever that purpose was. 
We continue to pour good money 
after bad into Afghanistan, hoping that 
the outcome will somehow change, 
hoping that maybe the next 20 years 
will produce better results than the 
last 20 years did. 
The American people say ‘‘Come 
home,’’ and now is the time. A Pew poll 
from last year found that 59 percent of 
Americans—and 58 percent of vet-
erans—thought the Afghanistan war 
has not been worth fighting. One poll 
from this year shows far more Ameri-
cans support withdrawal from Afghani-
stan than support continuing the war, 
and almost three-quarters of veterans 
support ending the war. 
We should be listening to those who 
have been on the ground in Afghani-
stan. There are so many veterans who 
have witnessed firsthand the rudderless 
direction of the war. 
We should listen to Army combat 
medic Shane Reynolds, who served in 
Iraq: ‘‘For all of us that went over 
there and worked so hard, and put our 
families through so much, and there 
was never a strategy. We were just 
going through motions, chasing ghosts 
through mountains . . . We felt that 
there was no plan, there was no strat-
egy and there was no will to change 
anything about that.’’ 
Maybe the Senate should listen to In-
fantryman Jay O’Brien, who served in 
Kandahar: 
‘‘Now I realize that no one above us 
knew what the hell was going on ei-
ther. It’s systemic willful ignorance all 
the way up to the top.’’ 
Army 
Intelligence 
Officer 
Gregg 
Frostrom, who served four deploy-
ments overseas over an 11-year period, 
captures the perspective of those who 
served: 
‘‘There’s a lot of feeling like you’re 
Sisyphus, like you’re just pushing the 
rock up the hill, and you go home for 
six months, and you come back and the 
rock’s at the bottom of the hill and 
you’re like, well, now I’ve got to start 
pushing it again.’’ 
President Trump ran for the Presi-
dent promising to end these forever 
wars. The American people want to end 
the Afghanistan war. Yet the establish-
ment powers in Washington and Con-
gress have fought him at every turn. 
This bill explicitly tries to tie the 
hands of all Presidents and make it dif-
ficult if not impossible to declare vic-
tory and come home. 
Not only does this bill make it hard-
er for any President to end a war, we 
already have high-ranking officials of 
our government directly defying the 
President’s orders to deescalate war. 
Take Syria for example. President 
Trump ordered troop levels to decline 
from around 2,000 to approximately 200. 
Former Ambassador Jim Jeffrey not 
only defied this order, he lampooned it 
later by saying, ‘‘What Syria with-
drawal? There was never a Syria with-
drawal.’’ 
According to Defense One, ‘‘outgoing 
Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. spe-
cial envoy for Syria acknowledges that 
he routinely misled senior leaders 
about troop levels in Syria.’’ 
Jeffrey’s admitted to ‘‘playing shell 
games’’ to obscure from the President 
and his generals how many troops were 
really left in Syria. In reality, Trump’s 
order to reduce the troops was counter-
manded by an unelected bureaucrat. 
As Becket Adams explains, ‘‘Obscure 
federal workers have reportedly been in 
control of the U.S. military presence in 
northern Syria, and all in direct viola-
tion of explicit orders from the Presi-
dent.’’ 
Adams continues: ‘‘Nothing to worry 
about here, folks. Just some nameless 
federal drones allegedly misleading the 
commander of the U.S. military in 
order to keep troops stationed overseas 
in conflicts that said drones believe are 
necessary and winnable. People laugh 
when they hear the term ‘‘deep state,’’ 
but it is no joke.’’ 
President Trump has ordered troop 
levels to be reduced in Afghanistan, so 
Congress 
responded 
by 
passing 
an 
NDAA which actually restricts his 
ability to withdraw troops. 
That is right. Congress, which has 
spent decades lecturing any and every 
one that we don’t need 535 generals and 
that there is only one Commander in 
Chief who has absolute powers to wage 
war however he sees fit, has now re-
versed course and decided that we actu-
ally do need 535 generals in order to 
stop the Commander in Chief from 
withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. 
President Trump vetoed that NDAA, 
and now we are here today in an at-
tempt to override that veto, to add a 
20th year to this war. 
This is a mistake. But Congress has 
had it wrong for a long time, so this is 
nothing new. They just passed a $1.4 
trillion omnibus bill that no one saw 
until hours before it was to be voted 
on, and they paired it with a $900 bil-
lion coronavirus bailout, paid for with 
money borrowed from our children. 
We are told all the time that there is 
simply no more fat left to cut in the 
budget, that we have to borrow because 
we can’t cut our high priorities. What 
are those high priorities, you may ask? 
Let’s start with a look at this bill that 
just passed. 
There is $25 million for Pakistan in 
there. Pakistan puts Christians on 
death row when they are accused of 
blasphemy, except that allegations of 
blasphemy are often based on petty dis-
putes among neighbors or coworkers. 
There are reportedly 80 people on death 
row in Pakistan for blasphemy-related 
charges. 
There is $700 million for Sudan in the 
bill, where freedom of expression is re-
stricted. 
There is another $500 million to ad-
dress the root causes of migration from 
Central America. I doubt the report 
mentions the allure of all the free stuff 
you can get after you break in to 
America. 
How about $575 million for ‘‘family 
planning’’ in the third world? 
How many businesses, struggling to 
make payroll because their Governor 
closed them down, could have used that 
$575 million? 
Congress is borrowing a trillion dol-
lars a year so that they can keep 
spending money on these kinds of 
things. They don’t want to set prior-
ities. 
This is hardly new. I have been 
watching this for years and called out 
the big spenders in Congress for ap-
proving: $250,000 to send kids from 
Pakistan to Space Camp in Alabama 
and Dollywood in Tennessee; $1.8 mil-
lion to improve the international per-
ception of Afghan artisans and crafts-
man; $10,000 to improve Pakistan’s film 
industry. Really? U.S. taxpayer money 
to subsidize Pakistan’s version of Hol-
lywood; a $2 million venture capital 
fund in Bosnia for businesses that 
couldn’t get their own financing; al-
most $8 million for foreign dance 
residencies. Really? Ballet for Bolivia; 
more than $9 million to ease medical

debt in Cambodia. What about Ameri-
cans’ with medical debt; more than $23 
million to help college graduates in 
Morocco find jobs. How about college 
grads in Kentucky; $273 million in 
grants to help people learn how to 
apply for grants. Really? U.S. tax-
payers are being fleeced to teach peo-
ple how to get more of our money; $20 
million to teach Laotians how to speak 
Laotian. Makes me want to utter Lao-
tian profanities. But I will likely need 
a government grant in order to learn to 
swear in Laotian; $1 million to produce 
a comedic variety TV show in Afghani-
stan. I don’t know about you but I 
don’t find that funny at all; almost $15 
million to produce foreign versions of 
‘‘Sesame Street’’ that would teach 
children in other countries about cli-
mate change. Next year, I am sure the 
taxpayer will be sending Muppets in 
Masks to Madagascar; and $153 million 
in development assistance that in-
cluded subsidies for low-income mort-
gages in Nigeria. 
So Americans are losing their homes, 
but Congress has already spent the 
money buying Nigerian mortgages. 
Americans are losing their liveli-
hoods, but Congress has already spent 
the money on economic support funds 
in places like Bosnia. 
American infrastructure is crum-
bling, but Congress spends billions on 
roads in Afghanistan. 
We could have rebuilt the Brent- 
Spence Bridge in my State, which has 
been a priority for some time, but Con-
gress can’t stop spending the money 
overseas. 
Again, the war in Afghanistan costs 
$50 billion per year. Our mission is 
complete. 
Al-Qaida 
is 
diminished. 
Osama bin Laden is dead. It is time to 
declare victory. The American people 
want the war to end. So many of our 
veterans want the war to end. The 
President is trying to bring it to an 
end. But Congress is standing in the 
way. 
Today we have the chance to act as 
the people’s representatives instead of 
acting like 535 generals. We should not 
override the veto. We should remove 
the language that tries to block the 
President’s drawdown of troops. 
I urge a vote against the veto over-
ride. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
voted against the motions to proceed 
and invoke cloture on overriding the 
President’s veto of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021 because, at this time of national 
crisis, the Senate’s first order of busi-
ness should be getting more relief to 
struggling American families. That 
means the Senate should have held a 
clean up-or-down vote on the House- 
passed measure to increase the amount 
of the individual stimulus payments 
from $600 to $2,000. The Senate could 
have easily passed both the additional 
payments and completed the business 
of the NDAA veto override this week 
had Senator MCCONNELL and the GOP 
majority been willing to do so. Given 
the President’s purported support of 
this relief, it could have been signed 
into law this week. But instead of de-
livering this additional help to strug-
gling American families, the Repub-
lican majority repeatedly blocked re-
quests to pass the additional relief by 
unanimous consent and refused to 
schedule an up-or-down vote. 
That said, I support the underlying 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
The President’s veto of this legislation 
put at risk a number of important 
measures, including a pay raise for our 
troops; critical investments for Mary-
land’s military installations; a process 
to rename those military facilities 
that bear the names of individuals who 
fought with the Confederacy to pre-
serve slavery; limits on the transfer of 
military equipment to local police 
forces; and support for key national se-
curity priorities. While the NDAA bill 
is not perfect and includes a number of 
provisions I oppose, on balance it is an 
important measure for our country. 
That is why I voted for it in the first 
place and why I voted in favor of over-
riding the President’s veto.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ED GOMES 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Edwin ‘‘Ed’’ Gomes, an ex-
emplary public servant, community 
leader, and advocate for equality and 
justice. Sadly, Ed passed away on De-
cember 22, 2020, at the age of 84. He will 
be remembered for his outstanding leg-
acy of dedication to Connecticut as a 
statesman and an activist. 
Ed began his impressive career on be-
half of our country in the U.S. Army, 
serving for 5 years. A dedicated steel-
workers’ union representative, he was 
first elected to the Bridgeport City 
Council in 1983. Throughout his decades 
on the council, Ed quickly earned the 
respect of constituents and colleagues, 
alike. 
In 2004, Ed was elected to the Con-
necticut Senate, where he served for a 
total of 12 years. As State senator, Ed 
fought tirelessly for the people of Con-
necticut, always going the extra mile 
to help his constituents. He knew that 
government 
could 
instill 
positive 
change for working families and con-
stantly advocated on their behalf. 
Committed to social reform and civil 
rights, Ed participated in the March on 
Washington 
in 
1963. 
His 
activism 
touched countless lives across our 
State and was an inspiration for all of 
us. Known for his passionate efforts to 
help others and strong principles, Ed 
was also respected across the aisle and 
warmly recognized for his positive spir-
it. Those who had the chance to work 
with him know well his respected, 
straightforward style and readiness to 
bolster advocacy by pulling from his 
personal experiences. 
I had the privilege of attending the 
annual L’Ambiance memorial cere-
mony, recognizing those workers who 
died in a horrific construction acci-
dent, with Ed, who unstintingly con-
tinued his advocacy for workplace safe-
ty. There was always an opportunity to 
do more and raise greater awareness of 
issues facing Connecticut’s working 
families. His dedication to fighting in-
justice was a model across our State, 
and he never hesitated to initiate 
change from the frontlines. I can attest 
firsthand to Ed’s unfailing attitude, 
which was equal parts joy and deter-
mination. 
His 
commitment 
to 
bettering our State and loyalty to his 
friends and family have left a lasting, 
positive mark on Connecticut’s legacy. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Ed’s family dur-
ing this difficult time. May their many 
wonderful memories of Ed provide 
them solace and comfort.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE VETO OF S. 906, 
THE DRIFTNET MODERNIZATION 
AND BYCATCH REDUCTION ACT— 
PM 63 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States which was ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, spread in full upon the 
Journal, and held at the desk: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
I am returning, without my approval, 
S. 906, the Driftnet Modernization and 
Bycatch Reduction Act. America’s fish-
ermen have made great sacrifices to 
ensure that our Nation’s marine fish-
eries are a sustainable economic engine 
for coastal communities. Under my Ad-
ministration, the number of United 
States fish stocks subject to over-
fishing is at a historic low. This 
achievement is the result of a trans-
parent and collaborative regulatory 
process that is supported by regional 
fishery management councils. At coun-
cil meetings, fishermen work with Fed-
eral Government and State govern-
ment representatives to meet their 
statutory obligations under the Mag-
nuson-Stevens 
Fishery 
Conservation 
and Management Act. 
In passing S. 906, the Congress has ig-
nored the fact that the regional fishery 
management process has had strong, 
bipartisan support since its creation. 
By forcing the West Coast drift gillnet 
fishery to use alternative gear that has 
not been proven to be an economically 
viable substitute for gillnets, the Con-
gress is effectively terminating the 
fishery. As a result, an estimated 30 
fishing vessels, all of which are oper-
ated by family-owned small businesses,

will no longer be able to bring their 
bounty to shore. At a time when our 
Nation has a seafood trade deficit of 
nearly $17 billion, S. 906 will exacerbate 
this imbalance. 
Further, S. 906 will not achieve its 
purported conservation benefits. The 
West Coast drift gillnet fishery is sub-
ject to robust legal and regulatory re-
quirements for environmental protec-
tion that equal or exceed the environ-
mental protections that apply to for-
eign fisheries. Without this fishery, 
Americans will import more swordfish 
and other species from foreign sources 
that frequently have more bycatch 
than our own fisheries. If the Congress 
wants to address bycatch, it should in-
sist on a level playing field for im-
ported seafood instead of crushing 
American fishing families. 
My Administration has done more for 
American fishermen than any Presi-
dent before me. On May 7, 2020, I signed 
an Executive Order on Promoting 
American Seafood Competitiveness and 
Economic Growth to bolster our do-
mestic seafood industry while curbing 
illegal, unreported, and unregulated 
fishing abroad. On June 5, 2020, I issued 
a 
Proclamation 
on 
Modifying 
the 
Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Ma-
rine National Monument to open it to 
commercial fishing that is conducted 
in accordance with the Magnuson-Ste-
vens Act and other applicable laws, 
regulations, and requirements. And as 
fishermen struggled to stay on the 
water during the pandemic, I issued a 
Memorandum on Protecting the United 
States Lobster Industry and later made 
approximately $530 million available, 
through the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s Seafood Trade Relief Pro-
gram, to support the United States sea-
food industry and fishermen affected 
by retaliatory tariffs from foreign gov-
ernments. 
My Administration would support 
provisions of the enrolled bill, if passed 
separately, which would authorize fee 
collection in a different fishery—the 
Pacific Halibut fishery. This authority 
is needed to implement a provision of 
the International Pacific Halibut Com-
mission 
Convention, 
to 
which 
the 
United States is a party. However, for 
the sake of American fishermen na-
tionwide, I will not let the Congress 
circumvent the fisheries management 
process by effectively terminating a 
fishery without appropriate consulta-
tion and input from fishery manage-
ment councils. If this occurred, it 
would increase our reliance on im-
ported seafood and take away the live-
lihoods of hard-working Americans and 
their family businesses. It is my duty 
to return S. 906 to the Senate without 
my approval.

ices in Cameroon to ensure they are held ac-
countable for abuses; and 
(G) engage in an ongoing effort to ensure 
that the crisis in the Anglophone regions is 
discussed in international fora, including the 
United Nations Security Council, that focus 
on urgent international diplomatic engage-
ment and response; and 
(7) urges members of the international 
community to— 
(A) join in a strategic collective effort to 
pressure the Government of Cameroon and 
separatist armed groups, including through 
the use of available diplomatic and punitive 
tools, to immediately conclude and uphold a 
ceasefire, participate in an inclusive and 
meaningful dialogue to address the root 
causes of the conflict and pending griev-
ances, and seek nonviolent solutions to the 
conflict, including by possibly involving an 
independent and credible international medi-
ator; 
(B) mobilize and coordinate funding for 
local and international organizations to pro-
vide humanitarian and development assist-
ance, including to fight coronavirus, to com-
munities affected by the crisis in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon; 
(C) leverage bilateral relationships to en-
courage key partners of Cameroon, particu-
larly France, to help foster a peaceful resolu-
tion to the crisis in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon, potentially 
with the involvement of an independent me-
diator, and implement a mutually agreed- 
upon program to address longstanding griev-
ances and marginalization; and 
(D) use regional and international fora, in-
cluding the African Union, the Economic 
Community of Central African States, and 
the United Nations Security Council to— 
(i) discuss the ongoing crisis in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon; 
(ii) push for a cessation of violence, an ex-
pedient resolution, and the implementation 
of a mutually agreed-upon program for ad-
dressing the root causes and pending griev-
ances; and 
(iii) maintain calls for the investigation 
and prosecution of human rights abuses and 
crimes committed against civilians. 
SA 2737. Mr. BOOZMAN (for Mr. 
RISCH) proposed an amendment to the 
resolution S. Res. 684, calling on the 
Government of Cameroon and sepa-
ratist armed groups from the English- 
speaking Northwest and Southwest re-
gions to end all violence, respect the 
human rights of all Cameroonians, and 
pursue a genuinely inclusive dialogue 
toward resolving the ongoing civil con-
flict in Anglophone Cameroon; as fol-
lows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas Cameroon is beset with multiple 
security challenges, including a Boko Haram 
insurgency in the Far North region, cross- 
border conflict and criminality by Central 
African militia groups to the east, and a 
civil war involving the Government of Cam-
eroon and Anglophone separatist armed 
groups in the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions; 
Whereas the official actions and policies of 
the Francophone-dominated Government of 
Cameroon have repressed English-speaking 
Cameroonians politically and economically 
throughout the history of Cameroon, dating 
back to the reunification of British-adminis-
tered 
Southern 
Cameroons 
and 
French 
Cameroun under a federal system in October 
1961; 
Whereas, in June 1972, following a national 
referendum, a new constitution was adopted 
that abolished the federal system, changed 
the name of the country from the Federal 
Republic of Cameroon to the United Republic 
of Cameroon, and gave additional powers to 
the presidency; 
Whereas Paul Biya, the oldest head of 
state in Africa, has been the President of 
Cameroon since 1982, maintaining his grip on 
power by centralizing authority in the exec-
utive, undermining the Constitution of Cam-
eroon, 
impeding 
democratic 
governance 
through corrupt practices, using security 
services to repress the opposition, and con-
ducting elections marred by widespread 
irregularities and allegations of fraud; 
Whereas key decentralization reforms en-
acted in the Constitution of Cameroon in 
1996, which mandated the establishment of a 
decentralized unitary state, ‘‘equality of all 
citizens before the law’’, the equal status of 
French and English as official languages, and 
the establishment of local authorities with 
‘‘administrative and financial autonomy’’, 
remain largely unrealized, though an ena-
bling law was adopted in December 2019; 
Whereas, throughout his tenure, President 
Biya has spent extended periods in Europe, 
pursued government policies exclusively ben-
efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-
eroon, and crippled many parastatals and 
private enterprises in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions, further marginalizing 
English-speaking Cameroonians; 
Whereas, in October 2016, English-speaking 
lawyers, students, and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon 
took to the streets to peacefully protest 
marginalization 
of 
English-speaking 
Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-
eroon in the legal and education systems, as 
exemplified by the appointment of French- 
speaking judges and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions and the pub-
lishing of important legislation solely in the 
French language; 
Whereas 
those 
peaceful 
protests 
by 
English-speaking 
lawyers, 
students, 
and 
teachers were met with excessive force by 
the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, 
which led to gross human rights violations, 
the 
arrest 
of 
lawyers, 
teachers, 
and 
Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-
tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in 
Yaounde´; 
Whereas, amid broader protests across the 
Northwest and Southwest regions demanding 
greater autonomy from the central govern-
ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 
56th anniversary of the end of British trust-
eeship 
over 
Southern 
Cameroons, 
the 
Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist 
armed groups declared independence from 
Cameroon; 
Whereas, in 2017, Anglophone separatist 
armed groups responded to the repressive 
and violent actions of the Government of 
Cameroon by targeting government officials 
and facilities as well as civilians and tradi-
tional leaders seen as sympathetic to the 
Government of Cameroon and brutally en-
forcing ‘‘ghost town operations’’ (general 
strikes) and school boycotts in the North-
west and Southwest regions; 
Whereas 
lengthy 
government-imposed 
shutdowns of the internet and social media 
in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-
taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a 
devastating impact on the economies and 
educational institutions in the regions, un-
dermined freedom of expression, prevented 
the free flow of information related to the 
conflict, and restricted the ability of local 
communities to interact and communicate; 
Whereas the conflict in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon has caused 
considerable instability and human suf-
fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to 
the conflict as of 2018, with more recent fig-
ures difficult to ascertain due to lack of ac-
cess to the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions, and according to United Nations agen-
cies, as of 2020, approximately 3,000,000 peo-
ple in Cameroon are in need of humanitarian 
assistance, 
approximately 
60,000 
Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria, 
and approximately 700,000 persons are inter-
nally displaced; 
Whereas numerous credible reports from 
human rights monitors, including the United 
Nations 
High 
Commissioner 
for 
Human 
Rights, have documented the excessive use of 
force by government security forces against 
Cameroonian 
civilians 
living 
in 
the 
Anglophone regions, including the burning of 
villages, the use of live ammunition against 
protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, 
torture, sexual abuse, and killing of civil-
ians, including women, children, and the el-
derly; 
Whereas the Department of State 2019 
Country Report on Human Rights Practices 
for Cameroon documented killings of civil-
ians, kidnappings, abductions, and hostage 
taking, beatings, attacks on health workers 
and media, restrictions on movements of 
persons and goods, and use of child soldiers 
by armed Anglophone separatists; 
Whereas the United Nations Children’s 
Fund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-
dren are out of school due to the conflict, 
and the Department of State added Cam-
eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act 
List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-
port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-
ing the previous year as having govern-
mental armed forces, police, or other secu-
rity forces, or government-supported armed 
groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; 
Whereas United States citizen Charles 
Wesco was shot and killed near the town of 
Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018,

S8008 
January 1, 2021 
and, in November 2018, the Department of 
State stated, ‘‘In memory of American mis-
sionary Charles Wesco and all others who 
have lost their lives in the Anglophone Cri-
sis, we urge all sides to end the violence and 
enter into broad-based reconciliatory dia-
logue without preconditions.’’; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Government of 
Switzerland announced that, together with 
the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it 
was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition 
groups to support a resolution of the 
Anglophone crisis; 
Whereas, in September 2019, President Biya 
hastily announced a Major National Dia-
logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from 
September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde´, 
‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond 
to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-
lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; 
Whereas, though the Major National Dia-
logue led to some concessions by the Govern-
ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-
tion issues, such as the release of some polit-
ical prisoners, including the leader of the 
Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice 
Kamto, and some of his associates after nine 
months of detention, it failed to bring sepa-
ratist groups to the table; 
Whereas, since the Major National Dia-
logue, the killing of civilians and other 
atrocities continue to be recorded across the 
Northwest and Southwest regions, including 
in towns and villages such as Babanki, 
Bamenda, Bangem, Buea, Mamfe, Muyuka, 
Pinyin, and Ngarbuh, and the Government of 
Cameroon recently has resumed its attack 
on the political opposition, placing Mr. 
Kamto under house arrest and detaining doz-
ens of his supporters; 
Whereas national and international out-
rage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-
ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant 
women, by government security forces and 
allied militia on February 14, 2020, in 
Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the 
Northwest region, and a commission of in-
quiry established by Cameroonian authori-
ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-
ing of 3 soldiers for murder; 
Whereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing 
concern over attacks on freedom of the press 
and detention of journalists on politically 
motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon 
authorities confirmed that an Anglophone 
journalist covering the conflict, Samuel 
Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was 
arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a 
military facility, died in custody shortly 
after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led 
to widespread condemnation and calls for an 
independent inquiry; 
Whereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion 
(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which 
has been accused of torture and extrajudicial 
killings and implicated in massacres like 
that of February 14, 2020, has received train-
ing and support from the United States, po-
tentially in contravention of legal require-
ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished 
. . . to any unit of the security forces of a 
foreign country if the Secretary of State has 
credible information that such unit has com-
mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; 
Whereas, in February 2019, the Department 
of State announced that it would withhold 
some security assistance to Cameroon, in-
cluding equipment and training, citing cred-
ible allegations of human rights violations 
by state security forces and a lack of inves-
tigation, accountability, and transparency 
by the Government of Cameroon in response; 
Whereas, on December 26, 2019, the United 
States terminated the designation of Cam-
eroon as a beneficiary under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 
et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-
eroon currently engages in gross violations 
of internationally recognized human rights’’; 
Whereas a European Parliament resolu-
tion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive 
political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone 
crisis, called for the conflict to be considered 
by the United Nations Security Council, and 
urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-
ical leverage provided by development aid 
and other bilateral programmes to enhance 
the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; 
Whereas France maintains considerable in-
terests in Cameroon, including significant 
economic and security cooperation, but has 
not adequately used its influence to stem 
atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-
gions or support stronger international ac-
tion to seek resolution to the conflict; 
Whereas the United Nations Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon 
stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon 
can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs 
to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 
2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 
Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United 
Nations Security Council and the United Na-
tions Secretary-General, the African Union, 
the Commonwealth of Nations, and La 
Francophonie to ‘‘ensure that Cameroon’s 
Anglophone conflict is on the agenda of the 
forthcoming UN Security Council meeting 
and all UNOCA sessions before the UNSC’’; 
Whereas, on May 13, 2019, an Arria-formula 
meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-
eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, but a formal meeting on the 
situation in Cameroon has not yet been 
placed on the United Nations Security Coun-
cil agenda; 
Whereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 
(2020), the United Nations Security Council 
unanimously underlined its support of the 
appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-
eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as 
the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; 
and 
Whereas 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
Cameroonian diaspora in the United States, 
and Cameroon is a longstanding security 
partner and aid recipient of the United 
States, participating in the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led 
by the Department of State and in United 
States-supported efforts to counter Boko 
Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, 
both of which have mounted terrorist oper-
ations in the Far North region of Cameroon 
since 2014: Now, therefore, be it

Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 466, S. Res 406. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 406) recognizing that 
for 50 years, the Association of South East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its ten mem-
bers, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Ma-
laysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,

the United States toward stability, pros-
perity, and peace in Southeast Asia, and ex-
pressing the sense of the Senate that the 
United States will continue to remain a 
strong, reliable, and active partner in the

ment to strike the preamble and insert

Whereas an estimated 7,000,000 United States 
citizens identify with an ethnicity represented 
in ASEAN; 
Whereas the United States and ASEAN have 
been cooperating to advance our mutual inter-
ests for 40 years, having first established dia-
logue relations on September 10, 1977, through 
the 1977 Joint Communique of the First ASEAN- 
United States Dialogue and the United States’ 
accession to the Treaty of Amity and Coopera-
tion in Southeast Asia (TAC) at the ASEAN 
Post Ministerial Conference Session in Thailand 
on July 22, 2009; 
Whereas the United States was the first non- 
ASEAN country to appoint an ambassador to 
ASEAN on April 29, 2008, and the first non- 
member to establish a permanent mission to 
ASEAN in 2010; 
Whereas cooperation between the United 
States Government and the governments and 
people of the ASEAN nations can help realize 
our common goals of a free, open, peaceful, and 
prosperous Indo-Pacific rooted in a rule-based 
order that promotes security, opportunity, and 
dignity to all peoples; 
Whereas the member states of ASEAN are all 
vibrant economies that have given rise to a 
flourishing middle class and collectively are pre-
dicted to become the world’s fourth-largest econ-
omy by 2050; 
Whereas, in 2019, ASEAN’s 10 members rep-
resented the sixth largest economy in the world 
and constitute the United States fourth-largest 
export market, with total United States exports 
to ASEAN countries reaching $116,200,000,000; 
Whereas ASEAN is the number one destina-
tion for United States investment in the Indo- 
Pacific, with $329,000,000,000 in cumulative for-
eign direct investment; 
Whereas ASEAN nations surround critical 
global sea lanes, with $5,300,000,000,000 of global 
trade and more than half of the world’s total 
shipped tonnage transiting through ASEAN 
waters each year; 
Whereas the ultimate goal of the ASEAN Eco-
nomic Community (AEC) is to create one of the 
world’s largest single market economies and fa-
cilitate the free movement of goods, services, and 
professionals; 
Whereas the United States-ASEAN Single 
Window custom facilitation system expedites 
intra-ASEAN trade and enhances the ability of 
United States businesses to operate in the re-
gion; 
Whereas the United States-ASEAN Business 
Alliance for Competitive Small and Medium- 
Sized Enterprises (SMEs) has trained more than 
4,600 small-to-medium size enterprises, with 
nearly half of the participants being women en-
trepreneurs; 
Whereas the Lower Mekong Initiative, estab-
lished on July 23, 2009, promotes sustainable 
long-term economic development throughout 
mainland Southeast Asia and fosters regional 
cooperation, integration, and capacity building; 
Whereas the newly announced Japan-United 
States Mekong Power Partnership aims to ‘‘pro-
mote a more sustainable energy sector and qual-
ity energy infrastructure development’’ and 
demonstrates the shared commitment of the 
United States and other Indo-Pacific nations to 
strengthen ties with Mekong countries; 
Whereas, in 2018 and 2019, the United States 
announced several additional initiatives to en-
hance cooperation with ASEAN, including the 
United States-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership, 
the ASEAN Policy Implementation Project, and 
the United States-ASEAN Innovation Circle; 
Whereas the United States is cooperating with 
ASEAN member states and providing emergency 
health assistance to enhance their resilience in 
the face of the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
through the recently announced United States- 
ASEAN Health Futures program that builds on 
the over $3,500,000,000 the United States has in-
vested in global health collaboration with 
ASEAN nations over the last 20 years; 
Whereas the United States remains committed 
to working with ASEAN to improve the pro-
motion and protection of human rights and fun-
damental dignity of the people of ASEAN coun-
tries, a key ingredient to maintaining stability, 
promoting economic growth, and advancing 
good governance; 
Whereas the United States opposes all actions 
and claims that infringe upon the freedom and 
lawful use of the sea, and has a national inter-
est in ensuring freedom of navigation and over-
flight, open access to the Indo-Pacific region’s 
maritime commons, and respect for international 
law in the South China Sea; 
Whereas the United States is deeply concerned 
about recent assertive and unsafe behavior by 
the People’s Republic of China in the South 
China Sea, and urges all claimants with com-
peting territorial claims to seek peaceful resolu-
tion of disputes through collaborative diplomacy 
and, as necessary, international arbitration 
mechanisms consistent with international law;

ippines’ decision to use arbitration under the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea (UNCLOS), done at Montego Bay December 
10, 1982, to peacefully and lawfully address com-
peting claims; 
Whereas the United States supports develop-
ment of a Code of Conduct (COC) that rep-
resents the interests of all parties and promotes 
peace and stability in the region, opposes efforts 
by any nation to use a COC as a vehicle to limit 
presence in or lawful use of the South China 
Sea, encourages claimants not to undertake new 
or unilateral attempts to change the status quo 
since the signing of the 2002 Declaration of Con-
duct, including reclamation activities or admin-
istrative measures or controls in disputed areas 
in the South China Sea, and encourages ASEAN 
countries to adopt a unified position in negoti-
ating the COC; 
Whereas the ASEAN-United States Maritime 
Exercise (AUXM), which ran from September 2– 
6, 2019, and featured over 1,000 sailors from all 
11 countries, built greater maritime security on 
the strength of ASEAN, strengthened navy-to- 
navy bonds, and exemplified our shared belief in 
a free and open Indo-Pacific; and 
Whereas natural disasters in the ASEAN re-
gion over the past four decades have resulted in 
major loss and damage, with a disproportionate 
impact on developing countries, and the United 
States will pursue initiatives that are consistent 
with sustainable long-term economic develop-
ment, including the achievement of food secu-
rity and poverty alleviation; improvement of 
conservation and sustainable management of 
forests, fish stocks, and oceanic resources; resil-
ience to extreme weather events that are in-
creasing in frequency and severity; and provi-
sion of sustainable livelihoods for local commu-
nities throughout the ASEAN region: Now, 
therefore, be it

their religious beliefs or political views; 
(4) urges the Government of Cameroon to— 
(A) initiate a credible, inclusive, good-faith

Charles Wesco; 
(5) urges the Anglophone armed separatist 
groups to—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8013 
January 1, 2021 
Whereas Cameroon is beset with multiple 
security challenges, including a Boko Haram 
insurgency in the Far North region, cross- 
border conflict and criminality by Central 
African militia groups to the east, and a 
civil war involving the Government of Cam-
eroon and Anglophone separatist armed 
groups in the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions; 
Whereas the official actions and policies of 
the Francophone-dominated Government of 
Cameroon have repressed English-speaking 
Cameroonians politically and economically 
throughout the history of Cameroon, dating 
back to the reunification of British-adminis-
tered 
Southern 
Cameroons 
and 
French 
Cameroun under a federal system in October 
1961; 
Whereas, in June 1972, following a national 
referendum, a new constitution was adopted 
that abolished the federal system, changed 
the name of the country from the Federal 
Republic of Cameroon to the United Republic 
of Cameroon, and gave additional powers to 
the presidency; 
Whereas Paul Biya, the oldest head of 
state in Africa, has been the President of 
Cameroon since 1982, maintaining his grip on 
power by centralizing authority in the exec-
utive, undermining the Constitution of Cam-
eroon, 
impeding 
democratic 
governance 
through corrupt practices, using security 
services to repress the opposition, and con-
ducting elections marred by widespread 
irregularities and allegations of fraud; 
Whereas key decentralization reforms en-
acted in the Constitution of Cameroon in 
1996, which mandated the establishment of a 
decentralized unitary state, ‘‘equality of all 
citizens before the law’’, the equal status of 
French and English as official languages, and 
the establishment of local authorities with 
‘‘administrative and financial autonomy’’, 
remain largely unrealized, though an ena-
bling law was adopted in December 2019; 
Whereas, throughout his tenure, President 
Biya has spent extended periods in Europe, 
pursued government policies exclusively ben-
efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-
eroon, and crippled many parastatals and 
private enterprises in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions, further marginalizing 
English-speaking Cameroonians; 
Whereas, in October 2016, English-speaking 
lawyers, students, and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon 
took to the streets to peacefully protest 
marginalization 
of 
English-speaking 
Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-
eroon in the legal and education systems, as 
exemplified by the appointment of French- 
speaking judges and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions and the pub-
lishing of important legislation solely in the 
French language; 
Whereas 
those 
peaceful 
protests 
by 
English-speaking 
lawyers, 
students, 
and 
teachers were met with excessive force by 
the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, 
which led to gross human rights violations, 
the 
arrest 
of 
lawyers, 
teachers, 
and 
Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-
tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in 
Yaounde´; 
Whereas, amid broader protests across the 
Northwest and Southwest regions demanding 
greater autonomy from the central govern-
ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 
56th anniversary of the end of British trust-
eeship 
over 
Southern 
Cameroons, 
the 
Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist 
armed groups declared independence from 
Cameroon; 
Whereas, in 2017, Anglophone separatist 
armed groups responded to the repressive 
and violent actions of the Government of 
Cameroon by targeting government officials 
and facilities as well as civilians and tradi-
tional leaders seen as sympathetic to the 
Government of Cameroon and brutally en-
forcing ‘‘ghost town operations’’ (general 
strikes) and school boycotts in the North-
west and Southwest regions; 
Whereas 
lengthy 
government-imposed 
shutdowns of the internet and social media 
in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-
taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a 
devastating impact on the economies and 
educational institutions in the regions, un-
dermined freedom of expression, prevented 
the free flow of information related to the 
conflict, and restricted the ability of local 
communities to interact and communicate; 
Whereas the conflict in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon has caused 
considerable instability and human suf-
fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to 
the conflict as of 2018, with more recent fig-
ures difficult to ascertain due to lack of ac-
cess to the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions, and according to United Nations agen-
cies, as of 2020, approximately 3,000,000 peo-
ple in Cameroon are in need of humanitarian 
assistance, 
approximately 
60,000 
Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria, 
and approximately 700,000 persons are inter-
nally displaced; 
Whereas numerous credible reports from 
human rights monitors, including the United 
Nations 
High 
Commissioner 
for 
Human 
Rights, have documented the excessive use of 
force by government security forces against 
Cameroonian 
civilians 
living 
in 
the 
Anglophone regions, including the burning of 
villages, the use of live ammunition against 
protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, 
torture, sexual abuse, and killing of civil-
ians, including women, children, and the el-
derly; 
Whereas the Department of State 2019 
Country Report on Human Rights Practices 
for Cameroon documented killings of civil-
ians, kidnappings, abductions, and hostage 
taking, beatings, attacks on health workers 
and media, restrictions on movements of 
persons and goods, and use of child soldiers 
by armed Anglophone separatists; 
Whereas the United Nations Children’s 
Fund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-
dren are out of school due to the conflict, 
and the Department of State added Cam-
eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act 
List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-
port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-
ing the previous year as having govern-
mental armed forces, police, or other secu-
rity forces, or government-supported armed 
groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; 
Whereas United States citizen Charles 
Wesco was shot and killed near the town of 
Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018, 
and, in November 2018, the Department of 
State stated, ‘‘In memory of American mis-
sionary Charles Wesco and all others who 
have lost their lives in the Anglophone Cri-
sis, we urge all sides to end the violence and 
enter into broad-based reconciliatory dia-
logue without preconditions.’’; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Government of 
Switzerland announced that, together with 
the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it 
was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition 
groups to support a resolution of the 
Anglophone crisis; 
Whereas, in September 2019, President Biya 
hastily announced a Major National Dia-
logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from 
September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde´, 
‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond 
to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-
lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; 
Whereas, though the Major National Dia-
logue led to some concessions by the Govern-
ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-
tion issues, such as the release of some polit-
ical prisoners, including the leader of the 
Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice 
Kamto, and some of his associates after nine 
months of detention, it failed to bring sepa-
ratist groups to the table; 
Whereas, since the Major National Dia-
logue, the killing of civilians and other 
atrocities continue to be recorded across the 
Northwest and Southwest regions, including 
in towns and villages such as Babanki, 
Bamenda, Bangem, Buea, Mamfe, Muyuka, 
Pinyin, and Ngarbuh, and the Government of 
Cameroon recently has resumed its attack 
on the political opposition, placing Mr. 
Kamto under house arrest and detaining doz-
ens of his supporters; 
Whereas national and international out-
rage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-
ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant 
women, by government security forces and 
allied militia on February 14, 2020, in 
Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the 
Northwest region, and a commission of in-
quiry established by Cameroonian authori-
ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-
ing of 3 soldiers for murder; 
Whereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing 
concern over attacks on freedom of the press 
and detention of journalists on politically 
motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon 
authorities confirmed that an Anglophone 
journalist covering the conflict, Samuel 
Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was 
arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a 
military facility, died in custody shortly 
after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led 
to widespread condemnation and calls for an 
independent inquiry; 
Whereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion 
(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which 
has been accused of torture and extrajudicial 
killings and implicated in massacres like 
that of February 14, 2020, has received train-
ing and support from the United States, po-
tentially in contravention of legal require-
ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished 
. . . to any unit of the security forces of a 
foreign country if the Secretary of State has 
credible information that such unit has com-
mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; 
Whereas, in February 2019, the Department 
of State announced that it would withhold 
some security assistance to Cameroon, in-
cluding equipment and training, citing cred-
ible allegations of human rights violations 
by state security forces and a lack of inves-
tigation, accountability, and transparency 
by the Government of Cameroon in response; 
Whereas, on December 26, 2019, the United 
States terminated the designation of Cam-
eroon as a beneficiary under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 
et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-
eroon currently engages in gross violations 
of internationally recognized human rights’’; 
Whereas a European Parliament resolu-
tion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive 
political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone 
crisis, called for the conflict to be considered 
by the United Nations Security Council, and 
urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-
ical leverage provided by development aid 
and other bilateral programmes to enhance 
the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; 
Whereas France maintains considerable in-
terests in Cameroon, including significant 
economic and security cooperation, but has 
not adequately used its influence to stem 
atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-
gions or support stronger international ac-
tion to seek resolution to the conflict; 
Whereas the United Nations Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon 
stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon 
can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs 
to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8015 
January 1, 2021 
Whereas, in February 2019, the Department 
of State announced that it would withhold 
some security assistance to Cameroon, in-
cluding equipment and training, citing cred-
ible allegations of human rights violations 
by state security forces and a lack of inves-
tigation, accountability, and transparency 
by the Government of Cameroon in response; 
Whereas, on December 26, 2019, the United 
States terminated the designation of Cam-
eroon as a beneficiary under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 
et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-
eroon currently engages in gross violations 
of internationally recognized human rights’’; 
Whereas a European Parliament resolu-
tion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive 
political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone 
crisis, called for the conflict to be considered 
by the United Nations Security Council, and 
urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-
ical leverage provided by development aid 
and other bilateral programmes to enhance 
the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; 
Whereas France maintains considerable in-
terests in Cameroon, including significant 
economic and security cooperation, but has 
not adequately used its influence to stem 
atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-
gions or support stronger international ac-
tion to seek resolution to the conflict; 
Whereas the United Nations Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon 
stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon 
can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs 
to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 
2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 
Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United 
Nations Security Council and the United Na-
tions Secretary-General, the African Union, 
the Commonwealth of Nations, and La 
Francophonie to ‘‘ensure that Cameroon’s 
Anglophone conflict is on the agenda of the 
forthcoming UN Security Council meeting 
and all UNOCA sessions before the UNSC’’; 
Whereas, on May 13, 2019, an Arria-formula 
meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-
eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, but a formal meeting on the 
situation in Cameroon has not yet been 
placed on the United Nations Security Coun-
cil agenda; 
Whereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 
(2020), the United Nations Security Council 
unanimously underlined its support of the 
appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-
eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as 
the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; 
and 
Whereas 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
Cameroonian diaspora in the United States, 
and Cameroon is a longstanding security 
partner and aid recipient of the United 
States, participating in the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led 
by the Department of State and in United 
States-supported efforts to counter Boko 
Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, 
both of which have mounted terrorist oper-
ations in the Far North region of Cameroon 
since 2014: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) strongly condemns abuses committed 
by state security forces and armed groups in 
the Northwest and Southwest regions of 
Cameroon, including extrajudicial killings 
and detentions, the use of force against civil-
ians and nonviolent protestors, torture, rape, 
kidnappings, and other forms of violence 
against women, and violations of the free-
doms of press, expression, and assembly; 
(2) urges all parties to the Anglophone con-
flict in Cameroon, including political opposi-
tion groups, to— 
(A) conclude and uphold an immediate 
ceasefire; 
(B) guarantee unfettered humanitarian ac-
cess and assistance to the Northwest and 
Southwest regions; 
(C) exercise restraint and ensure that po-
litical protests are peaceful; and 
(D) establish a credible process for an in-
clusive dialogue that includes all relevant 
stakeholders, including from civil society, to 
achieve a sustainable political solution that 
respects the rights and freedoms of all of the 
people of Cameroon; 
(3) affirms that the United States Govern-
ment continues to hold the Government of 
Cameroon responsible for safeguarding the 
safety, security, and constitutional rights of 
all citizens, regardless of their region of ori-
gin or the regions in which they reside, or 
their religious beliefs or political views; 
(4) urges the Government of Cameroon to— 
(A) initiate a credible, inclusive, good-faith 
effort to end the armed conflict in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon by 
addressing the root causes of the crisis and 
grievances and seeking nonviolent solutions 
to resolve the conflict, including possibly in-
volving an independent mediator in negotia-
tions; 
(B) follow through on initiatives developed 
to address the grievances that sparked the 
conflict, including the National Commission 
for the Promotion of Bilingualism and 
Multiculturalism, the Ministry of Decen-
tralization and Local Development, and the 
National Disarmament, Demobilization, and 
Reintegration Committee; 
(C) fully implement recommendations of 
the Major National Dialogue held in late 
2019; 
(D) respect the rule of law and the con-
stitutional rights of all Cameroonians, in-
cluding members of the political opposition, 
civil society activists, and journalists; 
(E) allow for credible, independent, and 
transparent investigations of all allegations 
of human rights abuses committed in the 
Northwest and Southwest regions; 
(F) release all political prisoners and jour-
nalists currently detained and immediately 
stop all arbitrary detention, torture, forced 
disappearances, deaths in custody, and inhu-
mane prison conditions; and 
(G) work with United States law enforce-
ment to thoroughly investigate and pros-
ecute those responsible for the murder of 
Charles Wesco; 
(5) urges the Anglophone armed separatist 
groups to— 
(A) engage peacefully with government of-
ficials to express grievances and engage in 
nonviolent efforts to resolve the conflict, in-
cluding participation in a credible and inclu-
sive dialogue, possibly involving an inde-
pendent mediator; 
(B) 
immediately 
cease 
human 
rights 
abuses, including killings of civilians, tor-
ture, kidnapping, and extortion; 
(C) immediately end coercive and violent 
enforcement of the school boycott in the 
Northwest and Southwest regions and at-
tacks on schools, teachers, and education of-
ficials, and allow for the peaceful and safe 
return of all students to class; and 
(D) publicly condemn the illegal detention 
and kidnapping of civilians; 
(6) urges the Department of State, Depart-
ment of the Treasury, and United States 
Agency for International Development, in 
coordination with other relevant Federal de-
partments and agencies, to— 
(A) consider imposing targeted sanctions 
on individual government and separatist 
leaders 
‘‘responsible 
for 
extrajudicial 
killings, torture, or other gross violations of 
internationally recognized human rights’’; 
(B) press the Government of Cameroon to 
provide unfettered humanitarian access to 
vulnerable populations in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon; 
(C) support credible efforts to address the 
root causes of the conflict and to achieve 
sustainable peace and reconciliation, pos-
sibly involving an independent mediator, and 
efforts to aid the economic recovery of and 
fight coronavirus in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions; 
(D) support humanitarian and development 
programming, including to meet immediate 
needs, advance nonviolent conflict resolu-
tion and reconciliation, promote economic 
recovery and development, support primary 
and secondary education, and strengthen 
democratic processes, including political de-
centralization, enshrined as a fundamental 
principle of state governance in the Con-
stitution of Cameroon; 
(E) continue to limit security assistance to 
Cameroon and ensure that United States 
training and equipment is not being used to 
facilitate human rights abuses in the North-
west and Southwest regions; 
(F) prioritize efforts to help develop and 
sustain effective, professional civilian over-
sight of law enforcement and security serv-
ices in Cameroon to ensure they are held ac-
countable for abuses; and 
(G) engage in an ongoing effort to ensure 
that the crisis in the Anglophone regions is 
discussed in international fora, including the 
United Nations Security Council, that focus 
on urgent international diplomatic engage-
ment and response; and 
(7) urges members of the international 
community to— 
(A) join in a strategic collective effort to 
pressure the Government of Cameroon and 
separatist armed groups, including through 
the use of available diplomatic and punitive 
tools, to immediately conclude and uphold a 
ceasefire, participate in an inclusive and 
meaningful dialogue to address the root 
causes of the conflict and pending griev-
ances, and seek nonviolent solutions to the 
conflict, including by possibly involving an 
independent and credible international medi-
ator; 
(B) mobilize and coordinate funding for 
local and international organizations to pro-
vide humanitarian and development assist-
ance, including to fight coronavirus, to com-
munities affected by the crisis in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon; 
(C) leverage bilateral relationships to en-
courage key partners of Cameroon, particu-
larly France, to help foster a peaceful resolu-
tion to the crisis in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon, potentially 
with the involvement of an independent me-
diator, and implement a mutually agreed- 
upon program to address longstanding griev-
ances and marginalization; and 
(D) use regional and international fora, in-
cluding the African Union, the Economic 
Community of Central African States, and 
the United Nations Security Council to— 
(i) discuss the ongoing crisis in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon; 
(ii) push for a cessation of violence, an ex-
pedient resolution, and the implementation 
of a mutually agreed-upon program for ad-
dressing the root causes and pending griev-
ances; and 
(iii) maintain calls for the investigation 
and prosecution of human rights abuses and 
crimes committed against civilians.
