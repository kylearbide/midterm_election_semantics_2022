PRAYER 
The Guest Chaplain, the Reverend 
Lisa Wink Schultz, Office of the Senate 
Chaplain, offered the following prayer: 
Almighty God, maker of Heaven and 
Earth, at Your word, the sea was cre-
ated. Your hand formed the sand as a 
boundary for the sea. We praise You for 
Your magnificent, breathtaking cre-
ation. 
We remember when You caused the 
storm to be still so that the waves of 
the sea were hushed. 
We ask that You calm Hurricane Ian 
and have mercy to all in its path. 
Give wisdom to our lawmakers, espe-
cially those who represent the State of 
Florida. 
Heal what has been broken, restore 
and comfort the faint, and give peace 
to all who work in this Chamber. 
We pray in Your merciful name. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

f 
ADDRESSING INNER-CITY GUN 
VIOLENCE 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, on Tues-
day, as they were leaving football prac-
tice at Roxborough High School in 
Philadelphia, five teenage boys were 
shot. Four survived the horrific shoot-
ing, but 14-year-old Nicolas Elizalde 
was killed. God bless him. 
Earlier that day, I stood with Rep-
resentative SCANLON, the Giffords orga-
nization, and the community to advo-
cate for gun violence prevention. One 
of the advocates in our audience was a 
grandmother like me. Only hours later, 
it was her grandson, Nicolas, who was 
gunned down leaving football practice. 
I cannot imagine her pain. Nicolas is 
the 23rd child to be shot and murdered 
in Philadelphia this year. 
There is a frightening trend of far too 
many illicit guns ending up in the 
hands of teenagers. This must end. 
We need serious solutions, not finger- 
pointing, to address inner-city gun vio-
lence. We cannot simply out-police 
loose gun laws that contribute to teen-
agers getting their hands on guns and 
murdering one another. 
So, while this may be the final day of 
our session, I will not stop working on 
this issue. I will be sending a letter to 
ATF requesting an increased focus on 
ending the pipeline of guns to our chil-
dren’s hands. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEPRES-
SION 
AND 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
SCREENING MONTH 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Octo-
ber as National Depression and Mental 
Health Screening Month and next week 
as Mental Illness Awareness Week. 
National 
Depression 
and 
Mental 
Health Screening Month is aimed to 
raise awareness of the need for acces-
sible mental health screenings and to 
provide support to people facing men-
tal health conditions, ensuring that 
they don’t feel alone. 
The National Alliance of Mental Ill-
ness study found that one in five people 
in Iowa navigates the reality of living 
with a mental health condition. Mental 
health affects everyone, and it is im-
portant that Congress implements leg-
islation to support Americans who are 
struggling. 
I am proud of the work that Congress 
and the FCC have done to implement 
the 
988 
crisis 
hotline, 
which 
has 
changed the 10-digit hotline to a 3-digit 
number that everyone can remember. 
The hotline provides immediate sup-
port around the clock, but Congress 
can and should do more. I hope my col-
leagues will take this month to reflect 
on our current system and think of 
ways we can expand mental health re-
sources, perhaps changing it to brain 
health.

In working together to address brain 
health, we can save countless lives. 
f 
CREATING SAFER COMMUNITIES 
ACROSS AMERICA 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the work Demo-
crats are doing to create safer commu-
nities across America. Living safely 
should not be determined by your ZIP 
Code, your ethnicity, or your salary. 
That is why, last week, Democrats 
passed four public safety bills, includ-
ing: 
The Invest to Protect Act, which 
helps local police departments with 
less than 125 officers to hire additional 
officers; 
The 
Mental 
Health 
Justice 
Act, 
which provides for training of mental 
health professionals to respond to men-
tal health crises; 
The Break the Cycle of Violence Act, 
which provides grant dollars for neigh-
borhood crime prevention programs; 
and 
The VICTIM Act, which allows us to 
hire and train more detectives to inves-
tigate violent crimes. 
Keeping families safe by putting peo-
ple first and putting people over poli-
tics is what Democrats do. 
f 
PANDEMIC IS OVER 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, ‘‘The 
pandemic is over.’’ That is what Presi-
dent Biden declared in an interview on 
‘‘60 Minutes.’’ 
OSHA 
clearly 
hasn’t 
gotten 
the 
memo, or it wouldn’t be attempting to 
revive a COVID–19 emergency tem-
porary 
standard, 
ETS, 
regarding 
healthcare workers and seeking to 
make it permanent. 
Our healthcare industry is strained 
enough as it is without the Biden ad-
ministration 
demanding 
additional 
burdensome COVID–19 requirements. 
This regulation is a perfect example of 
the left’s hypocrisy. 
President Biden can’t have it both 
ways, pretending there is a permanent 
pandemic when he wants to further his 
own emergency powers and declaring it 
is over when he wants to tout his ac-
complishments. 
It is time to let our medical profes-
sionals work in peace instead of having 
to jump through these unnecessary 
hoops. After all, the President said it 
himself: ‘‘The pandemic is over.’’ 
f 
HONORING WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ LUNA 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor Lieu-
tenant 
Colonel 
William 
Luna. 
He 
passed away on August 8 of this year 
and played a significant role in Chi-
cago’s Mexican Independence Day Pa-
rade for several years. 
Born Guillermo Luna, he was raised 
in East Chicago, Indiana, by his aunt 
after his parents passed away. 
William was a patriot, an educator, 
and an active member of the commu-
nity. He was a Green Beret and 
jumpmaster who served our country in 
the U.S. Army’s 2nd Airborne 505 Infan-
try and later joined the Army Re-
serves. 
His passion for boxing earned him the 
U.S. Golden Gloves boxing champion-
ship in 1958. 
Bill was a fierce advocate for the rec-
ognition 
of 
the 
contributions 
of 
Latinos, particularly Mexican Ameri-
cans, in the military. 
A lover of history and education, Bill 
earned a master’s degree in English 
and later became an adjunct professor 
of Mexican history and minority stud-
ies at the Indiana University North-
west. 
His knowledge of Mexican-American 
history led Chicago’s Channel 7 to in-
vite Bill to be a cohost of the Mexican 
Independence Day Parade broadcast for 
7 years. 
We will always remember him. Rest 
in peace, Lieutenant Colonel William 
‘‘Bill’’ Luna. 
f 
POLICY FAILURES CAUSE 
WILDFIRES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
residents in forested areas shouldn’t 
have to be worried about catastrophic 
wildfires every single year. 
Wildfires are part of California’s 
landscape and have been for centuries, 
but they occur less frequently and are 
better mitigated with healthy forests. 
They are less bad. 
Denouncing wildfires as solely a con-
sequence of climate change is flat-out 
false. We are seeing more and more of 
these giant wildfires due to decades of 
policy failures that have allowed our 
forests to become built up with over-
grown brush and dried-out, decaying 
wood, aka fire fuel. 
On top of that, environmental regula-
tions make it near impossible to clear 
that overgrowth, thin trees, or create 
bulldozer lines for fire breaks near 
towns or create large buffers around 
power lines and roads as needed. 
So, instead, what do we get? The Los 
Angeles Times comes up to my district 
and basically says we shouldn’t be 
there. People should not live in these 
rural 
forests 
because 
of 
climate 
change. 
Well, I want to know who is going to 
do the work to bring you your wood 
products, your paper products; if no-
body lives up there to do the work to 
thin the forest, to put the fire out, to 
make it where you can do tourism 
there? 
Who is going to do that if you kick 
us out of rural areas and make us live 
in places like L.A. with all the trash 
and other things like that? Yeah, I 
wonder. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share my appreciation for 
local law enforcement officers in my 
community and across the country. 
I recognize the sacrifices these brave 
men and women make every day to 
keep our communities safe, but words 
of praise and gratitude are never 
enough. I am proud to say I have 
backed up my words with action. 
Last week, I voted to pass a package 
of bills that support our police officers 
and increase public safety. Investing in 
our officers is critical to protecting our 
communities. 
We can increase public safety by en-
suring that law enforcement agencies 
are well trained to de-escalate dan-
gerous situations, respond to mental 
health and domestic violence emer-
gencies properly, and make sure that 
the right channels are in place to up-
hold justice for all. 
That is why I voted to pass the Invest 
to Protect Act. This legislation will 
provide Federal grants to smaller law 
enforcement agencies like those in my 
district to recruit, retain, and train 
good, accountable officers. 
To the police officers and first re-
sponders in my community: Thank you 
for the work you do to protect North 
Carolina’s Sixth District. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF 
KENT R. HANCE 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
on November 14, the proudest Dimmitt 
Bobcat, biggest Texas Tech fan, and 
the legendary west Texas leader Kent 
R. Hance turns 80 years old. 
I wish my dear friend and former boss 
the happiest of birthdays and thank 
him for his tremendous and matchless 
service, leadership, and love for the 
people, values, and spirit of west Texas. 
He strengthened the Lone Star State 
as a Texas Senator. He helped Reagan 
pass the tax cuts of 1986 as a U.S. Con-
gressman. He unleashed energy inde-
pendence in Texas as chairman of the 
energy commission. As the Texas Tech 
chancellor, 
we 
saw 
unprecedented 
growth in endowment, enrollment, and 
research. 
God blessed west Texas, and He broke 
the mold with Kent R. Hance.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 
6833, AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW 
ACT; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDER-
ATION OF H.R. 8987, FAIRNESS 
FOR 9/11 FAMILIES ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1404 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1404 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 6833) to amend 
title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 to establish requirements with re-
spect to cost-sharing for certain insulin 
products, and for other purposes, with the 
Senate amendment thereto, and to consider 
in the House, without intervention of any 
point of order, a motion offered by the chair 
of the Committee on Appropriations or her 
designee that the House concur in the Senate 
amendment. The Senate amendment and the 
motion shall be considered as read. The mo-
tion shall be debatable for one hour equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations or their respective designees. 
The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the motion to its adoption with-
out intervening motion. 
SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it 
shall be in order to consider in the House the 
bill (H.R. 8987) to amend the Justice for 
United States Victims of State Sponsored 
Terrorism Act to authorize appropriations 
for catch-up payments from the United 
States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism 
Fund. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. An amendment 
in the nature of a substitute consisting of 
the text of Rules Committee Print 117-68 
shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as 
amended, shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill, 
as amended, are waived. The previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill, as amended, and on any further amend-
ment thereto, to final passage without inter-
vening motion except: (1) one hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary or their respective 
designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
1404, making in order a motion offered 
by the chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations, or her designee, to concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 6833. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate on 
the motion equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/ 
11 Families Act, under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, and provides 
one motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, I am sure we will 
have a spirited debate on this rule, but 
before we do, I want to begin by ex-
pressing my heartfelt sympathy for the 
people of Florida. The catastrophic 
devastation left behind by Hurricane 
Ian is unlike anything we have seen in 
quite some time. 
Our hearts are with those whose lives 
have been lost and their loved ones, 
and we pray for those who are missing 
that they will be located safely and 
soon. If there is one thing we know, it 
is that the people of Florida are strong. 
This is not their first hurricane. They 
will recover and they will come back 
stronger than ever. 
I want to thank all of the first re-
sponders who have sprung into action 
to save lives: from local police, fire, 
and EMS, all the way up to our Federal 
response at FEMA. The people of Flor-
ida ought to know that America stands 
with them. Part of standing with the 
people of Florida is passing this impor-
tant legislation to keep the govern-
ment open during this critical moment. 
Madam Speaker, with less than 24 
hours until the end of the fiscal year, 
today we are here to do our job. We, in 
Congress, have a responsibility to the 
American people to keep the lights on. 
In addition to preventing the furlough 
of thousands of Federal employees, 
averting a shutdown will also ensure 
that our constituents can continue to 
receive the vital government services 
that they need. 
The last shutdown, when the Repub-
licans were in charge of the House and 
the Senate and the White House, was 
the longest shutdown in our history. It 
cost our economy an astounding $11 
billion. 
In contrast, Democrats are doing our 
job. We are keeping the government 
open as we finish up bipartisan, bi-
cameral negotiations on a longer-term 
fiscal year 2023 appropriations package. 
This CR also provides Ukraine with 
the security, economic, and humani-
tarian assistance that they need to 
fight back against Russia’s brutal inva-
sion. With Russia holding fake elec-
tions to annex parts of Ukraine, the 
Ukrainian people urgently need our 
support to protect their families and 
defend global democracy. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I men-
tioned earlier the devastating hurri-
cane in Florida. We also just had an 
awful hurricane in Puerto Rico. The 
people of Puerto Rico are still reeling 
from the damage of Hurricane Fiona. 
Also, the people of Alaska are recov-
ering from a terrible typhoon. 
This bill contains money to support 
communities across the United States 
as they recover from natural disasters. 
Madam Speaker, we are talking 
about hurricane relief for God’s sake. I 
am begging my Republican friends, can 
we please at least come together on 
providing relief to communities dev-
astated by hurricanes? 
Can we all agree that we ought not 
shut the government down in the mid-
dle of a major natural disaster re-
sponse? 
The funding in this bill will help fam-
ilies and small businesses get back on 
their feet and rebuilt from extreme 
weather events while repairing damage 
to critical infrastructure. 
This is a bipartisan bill, Madam 
Speaker. It earned 72 votes in the Sen-
ate. I don’t think you can get 72 votes 
in the Senate on what to have for 
lunch, let alone on government funding 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to again 
plead with my colleagues, do not vote 
against additional funding to help peo-
ple recover from hurricane damage, 
please, 
especially 
my 
Republican 
friends from Florida. A vote against 
this CR is a vote against funding for 
help with hurricane recovery in your 
own State. 
I just hope that we are not at the 
point where we have become so par-
tisan and so polarized that we can’t 
even agree on this. 
Madam Speaker, this rule also in-
cludes H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/11 
Families Act. This bill will ensure 
thousands of 9/11 families and victims 
who received some but not all of the 
compensation that they deserve are 
made whole. 
Both of these measures deserve broad 
support today. Americans are depend-
ing on us to get this done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Massachusetts, my 
very good friend, Chairman MCGOVERN, 
for yielding me the customary time, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to begin by 
associating myself with the chairman’s 
very appropriate remarks about the 
unfolding disaster in Florida and the 
southeast. It is something that moves 
all Americans. Florida, and frankly all 
of the region, is in our prayers and in 
our thoughts as they deal with an un-
precedented natural disaster. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
two items. The first I will discuss is 
H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/11 Families 
Act. This bill would shift just under $3 
billion from the CARES Act small busi-
ness loan fund to the United States

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8324 
September 30, 2022 
Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism 
Fund to compensate victims of the 9/11 
terror attacks. 
Last night at the Rules Committee 
we heard testimony on this bill, which 
unfortunately, is the only hearing this 
bill will receive this Congress. My Re-
publican colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee testified at length about 
the efforts they have gone to in order 
to work with the majority on this mat-
ter. But instead of working together in 
a bipartisan manner, the majority in-
stead chose to move ahead on this bill 
with no hearing or markup held in the 
committee of jurisdiction. 
This represents a complete failure of 
regular order. Madam Speaker, it re-
sults in a lack of process that is unfair 
to everyone. It is especially unfair to 
the victims of 9/11 who deserve both a 
bipartisan process and a bipartisan bill 
that everyone can support. It did not 
have to be this way, and it is unfortu-
nate that the majority decided to treat 
this issue with less than the gravity it 
deserved. 
Despite these procedural failures, 
however, I intend to support this legis-
lation, but we could have and should 
have done much better. 
Our second bill is the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 6833, a continuing resolu-
tion funding the government through 
December 16 of 2022. 
Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that Congress has waited until the last 
minute to take up the serious work of 
funding the government and keeping it 
open. It is equally unfortunate that our 
only option for doing so is the flawed, 
inadequate bill that does not meet the 
needs of the American people. 
Despite this bill’s flaws, there is 
much to like in it and much that I do 
support. I voted in favor of the omni-
bus spending bill back in March, and 
this bill would maintain those spending 
levels through the middle of December. 
I 
support 
additional 
funding 
for 
Ukraine as they seek to defend them-
selves against Vladimir Putin’s unjust 
and illegal invasion, and I support ad-
ditional funds for disaster relief. 
But just as important as what is in-
cluded in this bill is what is not in-
cluded in this bill and should have 
been. 
It is undeniable that we are facing a 
humanitarian crisis on our southern 
border, caused in large part by the 
Biden administration’s unwillingness 
to confront what is staring them in the 
face. The administration asked for $1.8 
billion to assist migrants, which they 
have received in this legislation, but 
they did not ask for a single penny to 
secure the border. 
The Biden administration has sought 
to add workers elsewhere in the gov-
ernment, like 87,000 new employees at 
the IRS, but they did not ask for 
money to add any new Border Patrol 
agents to help address this Biden-made 
crisis on the southern border. This 
could and should have been addressed 
in this bill, but it is not. 
Similarly, the bill does nothing to 
address the high price of energy or pro-
vide new sources of energy. We should 
be doing everything we can to provide 
secure, reliable, and inexpensive en-
ergy to the American people. Instead, 
the President is spending his time 
chastising 
energy 
companies. 
We 
should have addressed this issue in this 
bill, too, but we did not. 
Nor does this bill address other crises 
affecting the American people, includ-
ing inflation and the economic reces-
sion, both caused by the reckless and 
profligate spending policies of the 
Biden administration and this major-
ity. I could go on and on, but the point 
remains: so much should have been in 
this bill but is not. 
I hope that if my friends in the ma-
jority take anything from today’s dis-
cussion, it is this: it is high time for 
them to get serious about appropria-
tions and about holding bipartisan dis-
cussions with Republicans on full-year 
spending bills. 
Consider where we are: the House Ap-
propriations Committee, I am proud to 
say, passed all 12 bills out of com-
mittee this summer, yet, as of today, 
only six have passed the floor. It is the 
majority’s responsibility to bring those 
bills to the floor. 
In the Senate, which Democrats also 
control, the record is even worse. Not a 
single bill has been passed out of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee. In 
addition, no serious negotiations have 
taken place between Republicans and 
Democrats and between the House and 
the Senate. These negotiations have 
been postponed all summer and into 
the fall while the House takes up one 
political messaging bill after another. 
Madam Speaker, we need to focus on 
the serious business of funding govern-
ment. In order to accomplish that goal 
and achieve a bipartisan agreement, 
four conditions will have to be met. 
First, defense spending will have to 
go up to meet the level authorized in 
the fiscal year 2023 NDAA. The level in-
cluded in the House defense appropria-
tions bill is wholly inadequate to meet 
America’s defense needs and must go 
up to reach a final deal. 
Second, 
non-defense 
discretionary 
spending will have to come down. The 
House non-defense appropriations bills 
were all marked up at a bloated level 
of spending which cannot be justified. 
These numbers must be reduced for an 
agreement to be had. 
Third, longstanding bipartisan pro- 
life policies that have historically been 
carried in appropriations bills must be 
restored. The majority stripped these 
out in the Appropriations Committee 
this year, but they must go back in. I 
cannot emphasize this point strongly 
enough, Madam Speaker. No Repub-
licans—and I mean no Republicans— 
will vote for these bills unless these bi-
partisan pro-life riders are restored. 
Fourth, the 12 House Appropriations 
Committee bills include countless poi-
son pills that have to come out. These 
are liberal policy riders on all matters 
of topics, ranging from climate change 
to abortion to labor law. They have to 
come out to reach a bipartisan deal. 
The appropriations bills cannot pass 
this House and pass the Senate unless 
there is a bipartisan deal. 
Madam Speaker, we can reach a bi-
partisan, bicameral, full-year spending 
deal if my friends in the majority get 
serious about negotiating. At the end 
of the day, Republicans must be in-
cluded in these negotiations. If the ma-
jority continues to dither, we are head-
ed for a year-long continuing resolu-
tion. That is a bad outcome for the in-
stitution, a bad outcome for the gov-
ernment, and a bad outcome for the 
American people. 
b 0930 
When the majority begins to seri-
ously negotiate on a bipartisan appro-
priations package, I will certainly be 
there to help. But neither I, nor many 
of my colleagues, will participate in 
kicking the can down the road so my 
Democratic friends can ignore their re-
sponsibility to govern until after the 
upcoming election. 
I urge opposition to the rule, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), 
my 
good friend and my fellow member of 
both the Appropriations Committee 
and the Rules Committee. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
COLE for yielding me the time. 
Under the Biden-Harris administra-
tion, we are seeing crises, manufac-
tured crises. Let’s just look at a few in 
turn. 
We have a manufactured economic 
crisis. The inflation rate has increased 
by 550 percent since January of 2021. 
Total government spending during that 
time has increased over $9 trillion. 
This is out-of-control spending that is 
leading to this inflation. It is costing 
the average American family $6,000 a 
year. 
Let me just put that in perspective. 
That would be like going up to a family 
and saying, can you give me 1 month’s 
paycheck? Most cannot do that. The 
inflation has deprived the average 
American family of 1 month’s pay, and 
this CR does absolutely nothing to ad-
dress inflation. It does nothing to bring 
the economic crisis to an end. 
It just doesn’t stop there. Let’s talk 
about the manufactured energy crisis. 
The day, literally, day 1 that Biden 
took office, he declared war on Amer-
ican energy. He shut down the Key-
stone Pipeline and, as a result, Amer-
ican families are paying higher and 
higher prices at the pump. 
We are going to face record-level en-
ergy costs going into this winter, and 
yet, this CR does absolutely nothing to 
address the energy crisis. 
Let’s talk about crime. There is a 
crime wave going on all over country. 
Cities across the Nation are witnessing 
the results of the defund the police

September 30, 2022 
movement. Homicide rates across this 
country have increased roughly 50 per-
cent, compared to this time in 2019. 
In my home State of Pennsylvania, 
Philadelphia has recorded over 400 
murders so far this year. Philadelphia 
is on track to see the highest homicide 
rate in recorded history, and it is be-
cause of the defund the police move-
ment. It is because of Democrat rule. 
It is not just Philly. Los Angeles, in 
2021, L.A. defunded the police by $150 
million. What did they get? Homicide 
rates went up 23 percent, yet this CR 
does nothing to combat the crime wave 
that we are seeing. It does nothing to 
re-fund the police. 
Let’s talk about fentanyl. In my dis-
trict, and across the country, commu-
nities are facing the opioid epidemic, 
and that is a direct result of fentanyl 
flooding across our porous southern 
border. 
The devastation is because of Biden’s 
failed policies, the open border policies 
that he has instituted. And just don’t 
take my word for it. The DEA Commis-
sioner said that the open border poli-
cies are killing Americans ‘‘at rates 
never seen before.’’ 
Yet, this CR does nothing to address 
the fentanyl issue. It does nothing. It 
is because the base of the Democratic 
Party, the woke yuppies who stay at 
home and are on Zoom classes all day 
view this issue as a Cracker Barrel 
problem, something that will never af-
fect them because they don’t shop at 
Walmart. They drive a hybrid, not a 
Chevy Silverado; so that is why we are 
not seeing urgency on the fentanyl cri-
sis. 
Let me just put it in perspective. 
Fentanyl overdose leads to about 300 
deaths every single day in this coun-
try. That is the equivalent of an air-
liner going down every single day. If an 
airliner went down just once a week in 
this country, it would be declared an 
emergency within 2 to 3 weeks. 
Yet, we are seeing the same death 
every single day, and because it is 
viewed as a fly-over problem, an issue 
that is facing people that don’t live on 
the coast, no one cares about it, and 
this CR does nothing to address it. 
It is just not fentanyl. Let’s talk 
about the crisis of immigration. Since 
Biden took office, over 3.5 million ille-
gal immigrants have been apprehended 
at the southern border. This CR does 
nothing to add additional border secu-
rity; nothing for additional infrastruc-
ture; nothing for advanced technology. 
For those reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and 
‘‘no’’ on the continuing resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate my friend from Pennsyl-
vania reciting the Republican Congres-
sional Campaign Committee’s greatest 
hits, but let me remind people who are 
watching why we are here today. 
We are here today to move two im-
portant pieces of legislation forward; 
one that would help 9/11 families, which 
I hope we all can agree is worth sup-
porting; and the second is to make sure 
that 
the 
government 
doesn’t 
shut 
down; that we continue to provide 
funding that will help aid some of the 
natural disasters that we are seeing 
happen all over this country. 
While it is too early to have a dam-
age assessment from Hurricane Ian and 
actually know what the true cost of all 
this is going to be, make no mistake, 
this CR will help. There is money for 
2022 disasters and community develop-
ment block grants for disaster recovery 
above the OMB request. 
More importantly, we included lan-
guage to give FEMA a full year’s worth 
of funding up front, not just for the 21⁄2- 
month CR period; and more help will 
come for Florida, as we find out what 
is needed. 
Communities across America are cur-
rently dealing with record-breaking 
numbers of storms. According to The 
Washington Post this morning, ‘‘Since 
2017, 
an 
unprecedented 
number 
of 
storms rated Category 4 or stronger 
have lashed the U.S. shoreline: Harvey, 
Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, and 
now Ian. They all qualify as ‘rapid in-
tensification events,’ when a storm’s 
wind speeds increase by at least 35 
miles within 24 hours.’’ 
People should read The Washington 
Post about what is happening as a re-
sult of these storms. 
We have an obligation to help all of 
these communities. But you know 
what won’t help? A government shut-
down in the midst of a natural disaster 
of this magnitude. 
Again, I would point out to my col-
leagues here, we think it is unaccept-
able to ever shut down the Federal 
Government. My Republican friends 
obviously have a different point of view 
because when they were in charge, 
when they controlled the House, the 
Senate, and the White House, they shut 
the government down, the longest gov-
ernment shutdown in our history, and 
it was costly. To even contemplate 
doing that in the face of these natural 
disasters is unbelievable. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS), my good friend. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to comment on one portion 
of the rule, H.R. 8987, which is a bill 
that is incredibly important to me and 
to those that I represent. As a matter 
of fact, I drafted the legislation. On 
August 5, I had introduced the lan-
guage as part of H.R. 8667. We garnered 
bipartisan support for this very impor-
tant bill. 
What the bill does is finally make 
whole so many of our families that 
were affected by 9/11 because they lost 
loved ones, but they were not com-
pensated properly under the United 
States Victims of State Sponsored Ter-
rorist Fund. 
So we are talking about 5,347 widows 
and children that were excluded from 
this fund by this body; and it was an 
injustice that should have never been 
allowed to happen. As a result of their 
initial exclusion, widows and children 
missed the first two payments of the 
USVSST fund, creating a massive dis-
parity between their restorative justice 
payments and others that were in-
cluded. 
This bill would catch up those wid-
ows and children to the other victim 
groups and ensure that, moving for-
ward, they are no longer left out, for-
gotten, or excluded. So this bill is truly 
about fairness and doing what is right 
for the wives and the children or the 
husbands and the children of our first 
responders killed on September 11. 
Twenty-one years later, this House is 
finally going to do the right thing, and 
I am very happy to have played a part 
in helping them move this forward. 
In the gallery I have a special guest, 
Angela Mistrulli, who is the head of 
the 9/11 Children for Justice. She is a 
tireless advocate who has been affected 
personally, and I thank her for working 
with our office over the last 6 months 
and the advocacy of all of her members 
in seeing this through. I hope all my 
colleagues support this on the floor 
when it comes up later today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s com-
ments, and I hope that she will vote for 
the rule because if the rule doesn’t 
pass, we can’t bring this bill up for a 
vote. I agree with her; this is incred-
ibly important. So I hope all my col-
leagues will vote for the rule, not just 
to help 9/11 families, but also to keep 
the government open during this really 
critical time. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
bring up H.R. 7967, the Prosecutors 
Need to Prosecute Act, for immediate 
consideration. The bill will ensure that 
the perpetrators of violent crimes are 
held accountable for their actions and 
that victims of violent crimes receive 
the justice that they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, Amer-
ica’s largest cities are in the midst of a 
wave of violent crime, making some of 
them nearly unlivable. This spike in 
violent crime has many causes, but one 
factor is undeniably making the prob-
lem worse: That is the fuzzy-headed 
ideology followed by woke prosecutors 
who are refusing to do their jobs and 
prosecute violent offenders. 
As part of the Commitment to Amer-
ica, Republicans have made it clear

September 30, 2022 
that we will fund the police; that we 
will take clear steps to stop the 
scourge of fentanyl coming over the 
southern border into our Nation; and 
that we will crack down on prosecutors 
and district attorneys who refuse to 
prosecute violent criminals. 
H.R. 7967 fulfills that commitment. It 
would require the same prosecutors to 
report annually on the cases they re-
ceive and their decisions to prosecute 
or not prosecute. As Justice Louis 
Brandeis said, ‘‘sunlight is said to be 
the best of disinfectants.’’ 
This reporting would allow the citi-
zens of our great cities to see, once and 
for all, just what this wave of progres-
sive woke prosecutors is actually up to, 
and just how many violent crime cases 
they are refusing to prosecute out of 
ideology. 
To further explain the amendment, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS), my 
good friend, the author of the bill. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to urge that we amend the 
rule to also include H.R. 7967, which is 
the Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act. 
My legislation would hold prosecutors 
accountable and create transparency 
by letting the public know how many 
cases prosecutors are declining to pros-
ecute, the number of offenses com-
mitted by career criminals, and the 
number of criminals released. 
Over the past 2 years, we have seen a 
disturbing trend in progressive district 
attorneys in cities across the country 
who are refusing to prosecute violent 
criminal offenders. Look no further 
than my city of New York, our city of 
New York, where Manhattan District 
Attorney Alvin Bragg released a Day 1 
memo initially directing his staff not 
to prosecute certain crimes, including 
drug possession, trespassing, sex trad-
ing, driving with a suspended license, 
resisting arrest, and public obscenity. 
He even directed his staff to downgrade 
felony charges filed by our police, in-
cluding 
armed 
robbery, 
weapons 
charges, and drug dealing. 
Worst of all, his office will no longer 
seek sentences of life without parole, 
which means that the most heinous 
murderers, including terrorists, serial 
killers, cop killers, and perps who kill 
young children in connection with sex 
crimes will be released back onto our 
streets in 20 years or less. 
These policies have sent a clear mes-
sage to the criminals. It is, go ahead, 
break the law because we will not en-
force it. With prosecutors that refuse 
to prosecute, violent career super- 
criminals are free to wreak havoc on 
our streets. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
previous question today so we can hold 
woke prosecutors accountable for fail-
ing to do their jobs and protect. 
We want to be able to add this legis-
lation to the rule because it is incred-
ibly important that the public knows 
which prosecutors are refusing to do 
their job; and as we saw in San Fran-
cisco, they did repeal one of their pros-
ecutors. Many States, like ours, do not 
have a recall law, but this would give 
them the information they need to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
when 
it 
comes to selecting who is going to be 
the prosecutors for their cities, because 
prosecutors should actually be pros-
ecuting crimes. They should not be act-
ing like criminal defense attorneys. 
b 0945 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am embarrassed for my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. I just saw 
the bill. I am looking at the bill, and 
all it does is ask for more reports, more 
paperwork. I don’t know. I kind of 
think it is silly that that is going to 
fight crime, asking for more reports 
and more paperwork. Give me a break. 
We are here today, Madam Speaker, 
to try to bring two important bills to 
the floor, one to help 9/11 families and 
the other, Madam Speaker, to keep the 
government open because if it shuts 
down amidst all of these natural disas-
ters, things are going to be incredibly 
worse for everybody who right now is 
suffering. And this is what they come 
to the floor with? This is what they 
want to talk about? 
If you want to talk about what they 
are about, let’s look at their poorly 
named ‘‘Commitment to America,’’ 
which I guess is a rip-off on Contract 
with America, which basically would 
gut Social Security and Medicare. 
They want to ban abortion nationwide, 
and they want to make it easier for 
people to overturn the will of the 
American people in elections. 
I mean, that is the radical agenda 
they are all pushing here. 
Here we are, at this moment, trying 
to make sure that essential funding is 
there to help deal with these natural 
disasters, and this is what we get? This 
is like we hear the greatest hits from 
the National Republican Congressional 
Campaign Committee. They use Rus-
sian B-roll in their rollout of their 
Commitment to America. Come on. 
At this moment, right now, we have 
two bills that, quite frankly, should 
enjoy huge bipartisan support. We 
ought to move forward to help the 9/11 
families, and at the same time, we 
ought to keep this government open. 
Then, that gives us time to work out a 
longer term bill, which we can vote on 
after the election. 
But turn on the news. Look at what 
is happening in Florida right now. 
Look at what happened in Puerto Rico. 
Look at what is happening in Alaska. 
People need help. We have a responsi-
bility. 
Look 
at 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
Ukraine. Do we support helping pre-
serve democracy in Ukraine or not? 
That is what is at stake here. 
So, we can try to cut a political ad 
on the House floor here. Fine. But let’s 
not kind of make-believe that what my 
friends are trying to do is somehow 
real or will make any kind of a dif-
ference. It is a sound bite, plain and 
simple. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
quickly respond to my friend. 
Crime is also a problem all across the 
country, and we will work with you on 
the 9/11 survivors bill, which I point 
out, again, was originally my colleague 
from New York’s bill as opposed to a 
Democratic proposal. But I will give 
you credit for picking up a good idea 
that my friend originated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS), my friend, to respond. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I understand that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle don’t believe in 
transparency, that they believe this in-
formation should be kept from the pub-
lic. But these prosecutors work for us. 
Quite frankly, crime has soared in 
my city. People are getting killed. Peo-
ple are getting assaulted. Nearly every 
single category of crime has risen in 
New York City, and our prosecutors are 
refusing to put people behind bars. 
If the Democrats feel that public 
safety 
and 
crime 
skyrocketing 
in 
America’s cities is not an issue, that 
explains why you support defunding 
the police, bail reform, and all of these 
ridiculous policies. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
My friend can yell all that she wants, 
but what I took exception to is the fact 
that a proposal that essentially does 
nothing more than call for more re-
ports to be sent to the Committee on 
the Judiciary is somehow fighting 
crime. 
I would also tell my friends, let’s not 
talk about defunding the police when 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle have Members that are now sell-
ing T-shirts to defund the FBI and law 
enforcement or the fact that many of 
them voted against bills last week that 
actually provided more funding to the 
police. 
Come on. Reports somehow are going 
to fight crime? I mean, if that is your 
crime-fighting solution, well, America 
is in trouble. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it has become all 
too common in recent years to learn 
about the perpetrators of violent crime 
who should have been locked up for 
earlier incidents. All too often, we hear 
that a woke prosecutor decided not to 
pursue charges against a criminal for 
an earlier violent act, only for that 
same criminal to then offend again and 
again. As part of our Commitment to 
America, House Republicans will take 
action to end this practice. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
TIFFANY) to speak more about this

September 30, 2022 
issue and the solution contained in 
H.R. 7967. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the remarks by the gentleman 
from Oklahoma because he has been 
spot-on throughout this whole debate. 
I rise to oppose the previous question 
so that the House can consider the 
Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret that 
crime is completely out of control in 
this country. Annual homicide records 
have been broken in at least a dozen 
major cities. Brazen smash-and-grab 
robberies in broad daylight are a daily 
occurrence. Killings, severe beatings, 
armed robberies, carjackings, sexual 
assaults, arson, and looting have be-
come a common feature on the evening 
news. 
The gentleman on the other side of 
the aisle asked why we are doing a bill 
like this. Turn on the news and you 
will see. Crime in America is at his-
toric levels. 
Yet, rogue prosecutors in cities like 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadel-
phia, New York City, and Milwaukee 
continue to release predators from cus-
tody almost as fast as the police can 
arrest them. 
The use of no-cash bail policies, plea 
bargains, and a complete refusal to put 
dangerous repeat offenders behind bars 
has demoralized our police and endan-
gered our communities, and America’s 
most iconic cities resemble a Third 
World country. 
Take Milwaukee County. Here is a 
quote from the district attorney in 
Milwaukee County. If you want to 
know why there should be data kept on 
this and why the American people 
should know what is going on as a re-
sult of prosecutors’ actions in cities 
across America, here is a quote: ‘‘Is 
there going to be an individual I divert 
. . . who is going to go out and kill 
somebody? You bet.’’ 
That district attorney is still there 
in Milwaukee County. He is the person 
who gave a low-cash bail to the man 
who committed the Waukesha Christ-
mas parade killings last year, killing 
six people, out on low-cash bail, injur-
ing 60. 
There is a problem in America, and it 
needs to be dealt with. Americans are 
sick and tired of the lawlessness, and 
they are demanding accountability. 
That is what this is about, account-
ability. 
Madam Speaker, each year, jurisdic-
tions across the United States benefit 
from the Edward Byrne Memorial Jus-
tice Assistance Grant program, which 
provides funding to States, Tribes, and 
local governments to support a range 
of justice-related programs. 
If we defeat the previous question, we 
will offer an amendment to the rule, 
calling for immediate consideration of 
the Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act, 
offered by my friend from New York 
City, which will apply a reporting re-
quirement to these grants. 
It would, among other things, man-
date that district attorneys report to 
Congress 
how 
often 
they 
follow 
through on holding criminals charged 
with violent crimes, like murder, rape, 
arson, crimes involving illegal guns, 
and motor vehicle theft, accountable. 
They would also be required to dis-
close how often they prosecute the ini-
tial charges, how often they secure 
convictions, whether or not those 
charged were already on probation or 
parole, and how many offenders were 
released without bail. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, the 
American people need to know if the 
people they have entrusted to keep 
their neighborhoods safe are actually 
using their tax dollars to finance this 
crime wave. It is time to end the policy 
of underwriting progressive policies 
that endanger the lives and livelihoods 
of decent, hardworking Americans, and 
that starts with transparency. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with us for safer com-
munities and oppose the previous ques-
tion. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me say this again: a reporting re-
quirement. I mean, all of us are against 
violent crime, and we are against all 
the things that the gentleman listed. 
That is why we brought a group of bills 
to the floor last week to try to deal 
with some of these challenges. Again, 
many of my Republican colleagues 
voted against it. 
I am not questioning why my friends 
bring these items to the floor. I know 
why they do it. It is politics 101. But I 
do have to say that I do have a problem 
when they come to the floor and say 
that they are making a proposal that 
will somehow do something. A report-
ing requirement, more paperwork to 
the Committee on the Judiciary, oh, 
boy, that is really going to stop 
carjackings, that is going to stop mur-
der. Give me a break. 
If you want to come up with some-
thing that actually does something, we 
are all willing to work with you. But to 
come to the floor to say, oh, a report-
ing 
requirement, 
more 
paperwork 
going to the Committee on the Judici-
ary is somehow going to do something 
to prevent crime, I mean, I don’t know 
anybody who believes that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, a resident of the State of 
Florida was interviewed, and he said 
that with Ian, his whole house was 
gone. Everything in his house was 
gone. 
The people of South Carolina are fac-
ing Ian now. The people of the areas of 
Alaska and the people in the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico have all faced an 
enormous surge and impact of hurri-
canes—lives lost, people still being res-
cued. 
That is why the leadership of this 
Congress and the Members will join to-
gether, I hope in a unified manner, to 
recognize what our job is. Our job is to 
be the umbrella on a rainy day. 
In this, those who will suffer in the 
coldness of the winter, I am reminded 
of the freeze in Texas. Of course, we 
had no electricity, but thank God for $1 
billion for the Low Income Home En-
ergy Assistance Program. Some people 
are saying how grateful they are. Help-
ing FEMA to be able to be on the 
ground, $2 billion for helping people re-
cover their housing and infrastructure. 
They are obliterated in Florida, 1 mil-
lion people without lights. Of course, 
we know about Jackson, Mississippi, 
and Flint, Michigan, $20 million for 
water and wastewater and other crises 
that we have had. 
I want this Congress to stand up for 
not shutting the government down but 
taking its rightful responsibility and 
dealing with the crises of America. 
We have done it with the Inflation 
Reduction Act. We want to take people 
over politics. We want to make sure 
that we have jobs, good healthcare, low 
cost. We want to do something. 
My friend on the Committee on the 
Judiciary, I am always eager to work 
with you. We all are facing the crises 
that come about after the pandemic. 
But thank God we have legislation 
that deals with safer communities and 
restricting gun trafficking. We have 
one that provides us with the oppor-
tunity for those cases that have been 
backlogged. 
We have done the work as Demo-
crats. We ask you to join us in this ef-
fort. The CR must pass. Ukraine is 
fighting for democracy. We are helping 
them. We must make a difference by 
keeping the government open. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for support for 
the underlying rule. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, it is deeply unfortu-
nate that we have once again waited 
until the last minute to fund the gov-
ernment. With no time left for negotia-
tions, the majority is putting forward a 
bill to fund the government that was 
not subject to bipartisan negotiations 
in the House. It is no surprise, then, 
that this bill fails to accomplish so 
many things that are necessary to ad-
dress the crises currently confronting 
the Nation. 
I am an appropriator, and I would ad-
vise my friend that the Appropriations 
Committee—and I give great credit to 
my friend, the chairwoman of that 
committee, Ms. DELAURO
from Con-
necticut, and the ranking member, Ms. 
GRANGER from Texas—actually got all 
12 bills done by the end of July and out 
of committee. 
b 1000 
Six of those have come across the 
floor. That is a good thing. Six others

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8328 
September 30, 2022 
have not. That includes, by the way, 
the bills to defend the United States of 
America, the largest spending bill. It 
includes the bill to defend our southern 
border. 
The reality is, they haven’t come to 
the floor because my friends don’t have 
the votes to pass them. Many of their 
own Members want to reduce the size 
of defense as opposed to increase it in 
a dangerous world. Many of their 
friends simply don’t want to do any-
thing to secure the southern border. 
Now, the reality is, in the end, I 
think we will get both those things 
done, and there will have to be a bipar-
tisan negotiation to do it. There has 
been absolutely no negotiation since 
July in the House. 
I also point to the United States Sen-
ate, which is not the responsibility of 
my friends, but their party controls it. 
That body has not moved a single bill 
out of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee. Not one. 
Now we are asked, because we are in 
an emergency, to kick the can down 
the road. My friends have had months 
to deal with this issue and to engage in 
serious bipartisanship. They have cho-
sen not to do that. They would rather 
do messaging bill after messaging bill 
after messaging bill. That is what we 
have been dealing with. 
Frankly, the Rules Committee, un-
usually, has become a committee of 
original jurisdiction in bill after bill 
after bill because those bills have not 
gone through the committee. They are 
raced through the Rules Committee to 
come to the floor to make a political 
point on the eve of an election. That is 
a bad way to govern. 
Now, I am hopeful once we get to the 
other side of the election, my friends 
will sit down, and we will arrive at a 
bipartisan agreement on funding the 
government, which is the primary re-
sponsibility of Congress, in my view. 
But so far those negotiations have not 
taken place. We don’t have agreed-upon 
top lines. 
My friends can’t pass important bills, 
so they are left to linger. And then 
they come to us at the very last 
minute and say, gosh, you have to help 
us here in this emergency. 
We are going to pass the bills. The 
government is not going to shut down. 
Nobody here has the illusion that it 
will. But we should not be in this situa-
tion. Both sides have done this, I will 
grant my friend that. But this is a par-
ticularly egregious process of no nego-
tiations on things like defense and se-
curing the southern border. 
We live in a dangerous world. We 
don’t need a CR in defense; we need a 
bill. Actually, the Democratic-con-
trolled House Armed Services Com-
mittee produced a bill. It is just $30 bil-
lion more than the President asked for 
because that is what that committee 
felt we needed. It passed on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
Why can’t we move the appropria-
tions level up to do what a Democratic- 
controlled House Armed Services Com-
mittee asked us to do? 
Our friends have not wanted to deal 
with that issue. 
We know we have a crisis on the 
southern border. You can turn on the 
television and see it every night. You 
can look at the fentanyl pouring into 
the country. You can see the tragedy of 
human trafficking. 
Is there anything in this bill that 
asked us to do anything different, any-
thing new? 
Has any legislation come to the floor 
to do that? 
No. We are just asked, please allow 
us to continue the current state of af-
fairs to exist on the southern border. 
That is a travesty. 
When you say, well, we are bringing 
irrelevant issues, the reality is you 
won’t bring the relevant issues to the 
floor. You won’t bring the relevant ap-
propriations bills to the floor. 
But make no mistake, Republicans 
have put forward a Commitment to 
America to address the concerns of our 
citizens: 
We will fund the police and uphold 
law and order. 
We will add needed security infra-
structure at the southern border. 
We will achieve longer and healthier 
lives for our citizens. 
We will ensure that America has an 
all-of-the-above energy policy that pro-
vides consistent, low-cost energy to 
keep our economy strong. That is 
something my friends don’t want to 
deal with. 
We will end the majority and the 
Biden administration’s reckless spend-
ing policies that have led to record in-
flation and stifling economic recession. 
This administration inherited a V- 
shaped recovery, and a 1.4 percent in-
flation rate. Now we are in a recession 
with a 40-year-high, 8.3 percent infla-
tion rate. That is a record of disaster. 
We ought to be talking about those 
issues, not maintaining the status quo. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
have great respect for the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), but I will 
take exception with his characteriza-
tion of us passing messaging bills. 
Let me just go through a few items 
here that we did pass and that have 
been signed into law: 
The Honoring our PACT Act for our 
veterans. 
The Inflation Reduction Act. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act. 
The Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, the biggest investment in in-
frastructure ever in this country. A 
bill, by the way, that some of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
voted against, but they were at the an-
nouncement 
of 
moneys 
to 
rebuild 
bridges and roads in their district even 
though they voted against it. 
The Postal Service Reform Act. 
Protecting Medicare and American 
Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act. 
The American Rescue Plan Act. 
I could go on and on and on. These 
aren’t messaging bills. These are major 
investments in our country that will 
have an impact for generations, that 
will help our children, that will help 
our senior citizens, that will help our 
veterans. 
This is what we are supposed to be 
doing, helping uplift the American peo-
ple, investing in our country. So that 
is not messaging. That is real work. 
Today’s bills aren’t messaging bills, 
either. I mean, helping 9/11 families. 
That is not a messaging bill. That is 
real. It is something we should do. We 
ought to be together on that. 
This continuing resolution, this is 
important, especially in light of all the 
natural disasters that are happening in 
this country right now. 
Madam Speaker, this should be sim-
ple. We have an obligation to fund the 
government. We have a bipartisan bill, 
again, that had 72 votes in the Senate. 
We have a bipartisan bill that not only 
will keep the lights on but will provide 
critical funding to help communities 
devastated by recent natural disasters. 
Now, House Republicans have made 
it clear that they would rather brag 
about their dangerous, extreme, un-
popular agenda than do real work. All 
I can say to that is that Democrats are 
committed to putting people over poli-
tics. 
The Republicans’ radical agenda bans 
abortion, and we want to protect 
Americans’ right to affordable, acces-
sible healthcare and safeguard Amer-
ica’s right to reproductive care. 
We are here to defend Americans’ 
right to vote. They want to make it 
easier to overturn elections. 
We want to protect Social Security. 
You saw the agenda that the Repub-
lican leaders in the Senate unveiled. 
They gut Social Security. 
There is a contrast here. But today, 
we are here to advance relief for com-
munities hit by natural disasters, pass 
overdue benefits for 9/11 families, and 
keep the government running. 
What does putting people over poli-
tics mean? 
It means that we come together to 
make sure that the people of Florida 
have what they need to get through 
this terrible disaster. 
It means that we are there for the 
people of Puerto Rico and that we are 
there for the people of Alaska, that we 
are there for people anywhere in this 
country, whether it is a red State or 
blue State, who are dealing with these 
natural catastrophes. 
That is what this is about. If this 
went down and we shut the government 
down, the pain that people are already 
dealing 
with 
would 
only 
increase. 
Shame on us for doing that. 
Now, I get it, Madam Speaker. There 
are some people here who don’t really 
care about whether the government 
stays open or shuts down.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8329 
September 30, 2022 
I remind you again, when my friends 
were in charge, when the Republicans 
controlled the House, when they con-
trolled the Senate, when they con-
trolled the White House, they shut the 
government down. They walked away. 
The longest shutdown in history. Bil-
lions and billions and billions of dollars 
it cost our economy. 
We had to clean up their mess when 
we took over. Today, we are doing 
what is right for the American people, 
for all people. This is not about poli-
tics. This is about putting people over 
politics. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule 
and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1404 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
7967) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act to direct district attor-
ney and prosecutors offices to report to the 
Attorney General, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 7967. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on ordering the previous 
question will be followed by a 5-minute 
vote on adoption of the resolution, if 
ordered. This is a 15-minute vote. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
208, not voting 5, as follows:

ing such methodology in forecasting shall in-
clude only the activities described in that notice 
and, as feasible, additional activities that are 
directly related to the direct review of biosimilar 
biological product applications and supple-
ments, including additional formal meeting 
types, the direct review of postmarketing com-
mitments and requirements, the direct review of 
risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and 
the direct review of annual reports for approved 
biosimilar biological products. Subject to the ex-
ceptions in the preceding sentence, the Secretary 
shall not include as workload categories in ap-
plying such methodology in forecasting any 
non-core review activities, including those ac-
tivities that the Secretary referenced for poten-
tial future use in such notice but did not utilize 
in setting fees for fiscal year 2021.

in fee revenue for a fiscal year that is less than 
the sum of the amounts under subsections 
(b)(1)(A) (the annual base revenue for the fiscal 
year), (b)(1)(B) (the dollar amount of the infla-
tion adjustment for the fiscal year), and 
(b)(1)(C) (the dollar amount of the strategic hir-
ing and retention adjustment). 
‘‘(D) PUBLICATION IN FEDERAL REGISTER.—The 
Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register 
notice under paragraph (5) the fee revenue and 
fees resulting from the adjustment and the 
methodologies under this paragraph. 
‘‘(4) OPERATING RESERVE ADJUSTMENT.— 
‘‘(A) INCREASE.—For fiscal year 2023 and sub-
sequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall, in ad-
dition to adjustments under paragraphs (1), (2), 
and (3), further increase the fee revenue and 
fees if such an adjustment is necessary to pro-
vide for at least 10 weeks of operating reserves 
of carryover user fees for the process for the re-
view of biosimilar biological product applica-
tions. 
‘‘(B) DECREASE.—

the Secretary has carryover balances for such 
process in excess of 27 weeks of such operating 
reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee 
revenue and fees to provide for not more than 27 
weeks of such operating reserves. 
‘‘(iii) FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND SUBSEQUENT FISCAL 
YEARS.—For fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fis-
cal years, if the Secretary has carryover bal-
ances for such process in excess of 21 weeks of 
such operating reserves, the Secretary shall de-
crease such fee revenue and fees to provide for 
not more than 21 weeks of such operating re-
serves. 
‘‘(C) FEDERAL
REGISTER
NOTICE.—If an ad-
justment under subparagraph (A) or (B) is 
made, the rationale for the amount of the in-
crease or decrease (as applicable) in fee revenue 
and fees shall be contained in the annual Fed-
eral Register notice under paragraph (5)(B) es-
tablishing fee revenue and fees for the fiscal 
year involved.’’; and

(2) on April 6, 2022, the prescribed burn, 
which became known as the ‘‘Hermit’s Peak 
Fire’’, exceeded the containment capabilities of 
the Forest Service, was declared a wildfire, and 
spread to other Federal and non-Federal land; 
(3) on April 19, 2022, the Calf Canyon Fire, 
also in San Miguel County, New Mexico, began 
burning on Federal land and was later identi-
fied as the result of a pile burn in January 2022 
that remained dormant under the surface before 
reemerging; 
(4) on April 27, 2022, the Hermit’s Peak Fire 
and the Calf Canyon Fire merged, and both

Randy Moore ordered a 90-day review of pre-
scribed burn policies to reduce the risk of 
wildfires and ensure the safety of the commu-
nities involved; 
(8) the U.S. Forest Service has assumed re-
sponsibility for the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon 
Fire; 
(9) the fire resulted in the loss of Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, and private property; and 
(10) the United States should compensate the 
victims of the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
(1) to compensate victims of the Hermit’s Peak/ 
Calf Canyon Fire, for injuries resulting from the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8347 
September 30, 2022 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Ms. DELAURO of Connecticut moves that 
the House concur in the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 6833. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1404, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the Senate amendment to H.R. 6833. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Continuing 
Appropriations 
and 
Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, which extends funding for Federal 
programs and services through Decem-
ber 16. 
With a 72–25 vote, the United States 
Senate approved this legislation with 
the support of all Democrats and 22 Re-
publicans, including Senators SHELBY 
and MCCONNELL. 
Before I begin, I want to acknowledge 
the millions of people in Florida, Puer-
to Rico, Alaska, and elsewhere reeling 
from recent disasters, stranded without 
power and other necessary resources, 
and mourning the loss of loved ones. 
This institution will stand with com-
munities across America as they re-
build and recover. 
With the many challenges facing our 
Nation and the world, including dev-
astating natural disasters and the high 
cost of living, we cannot wait any 
longer to pass this bill. 
This bill guarantees that we have the 
means to continue the important work 
we are doing to help middle class and 
working families with the cost of liv-
ing, support vulnerable Americans by 
keeping roofs over the heads of mil-
lions of families and food on their ta-
bles, uphold our commitment to our 
veterans, and strengthen our national 
security. But this is not enough, and 
this solution is only a short-term one. 
The Appropriations Committee and 
House Democrats worked to clear all 12 
government funding bills out of com-
mittee and pass six on the floor of the 
House this summer. These are trans-
formational bills needed to meet the 
moment and tackle our Nation’s big-
gest challenges. 
The legislation before us allows addi-
tional time for bipartisan, bicameral 
negotiations to enact final 2023 funding 
bills. 
The bill also includes $12.35 billion in 
necessary emergency funding to sup-
port the Ukrainian people and global 
democracy in the face of Russia’s 
grievous invasion of Ukraine. This 
body came together twice earlier this 
year to deliver on our commitment to 
the courageous people of Ukraine, but 
most of those resources have already 
been disbursed or committed. 
For that reason, this bill includes 
necessary 
security 
assistance 
for 
Ukraine, including $3 billion for the 
Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative 
to keep weapons and ammunition flow-
ing without interruption, and $1.5 bil-
lion to replenish U.S. stocks of equip-
ment sent through drawdown author-
ity. 
We also help Ukraine protect its de-
mocracy by supporting the continuity 
of its democratic government and de-
livery of citizen services with $4.5 bil-
lion. This contribution ensures we con-
tinue upholding our moral responsi-
bility to support the people of Ukraine 
in the face of a vicious invasion that 
continues to demand decisive action 
from us. 
The bill also includes safeguards over 
these funds, such as a requirement of 
third-party monitoring and a certifi-
cation by the Secretary of State that 
protects against corruption. 
With $2 million for the DOD Inspec-
tor General to monitor funds and pro-
vide 
Congress 
with 
a 
report 
inventorying security assistance, we 
ensure weapons are used for their in-
tended purpose by their intended re-
cipients. 
At the same time, this bill responds 
to the devastation that recent natural 
disasters and extreme weather events 
have left behind. As the climate crisis 
wreaks havoc on communities all over 
our Nation, this legislation provides 
significant support for disaster re-
sponse and recovery efforts. 
Included in this is a critical $20 mil-
lion in funding to complete previously 
authorized Army Corps of Engineers 
projects that will help address the 
water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, 
and upgrade its water and wastewater 
infrastructure. 
In the wealthiest Nation in the 
world, the bare minimum every person 
deserves is drinking water that is clean 
and safe, and this bill gets us one step 
closer to that minimum. 
By fully funding the Disaster Relief 
Fund, this bill responds to Hurricane 
Ian in Florida; to the crisis left behind 
in Puerto Rico after the devastating 
Hurricane Fiona; and to the severe 
storm, flooding, and landslides in Alas-
ka, helping with recovery and disaster 
relief efforts. 
We also provide $1 billion in funding 
for the Low Income Home Energy As-
sistance Program to help lower-income 
families cover the rising energy costs 
of home heating and cooling; including 
$2.5 billion to address the largest wild-
fire in New Mexico, in their history, 
that started from prescribed burns on 
Federal land; and support these and 
other communities all over the Nation, 
including Kentucky, California, Lou-
isiana, and Texas, by providing $2 bil-
lion to help address unmet housing, in-
frastructure, and economic recovery 
needs in communities recovering from 
recent 
wildfires, 
major 
storms, 
droughts, floods, and extreme heat. 
While this legislation provides a 
bridge to an omnibus, it is not perfect. 
I am saddened that the continuing res-
olution does not fully meet some of our 
country’s most urgent needs, including 
the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic and 
monkey pox outbreak. I will continue 
working to provide the resources to 
combat these public health crises and 
support the areas in need of additional 
resources to recover from natural dis-
asters. 
Despite these shortcomings, the in-
vestments included in this bill are ur-
gent and necessary to avoid disruptions 
to vital Federal agencies, to help com-
munities get back on their feet, and to 
ensure we have the time needed to ne-
gotiate a final funding agreement that 
meets the needs of hardworking people. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in opposition to the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 6833, a short- 
term continuing resolution extending 
government funding through December 
16. I oppose this CR for several reasons. 
First, we should be here addressing 
the border crisis, the energy crisis, and 
the inflation crisis. This bill does noth-
ing to fix any of these issues. In fact, 
this bill actually bails out the Biden 
administration for their failures and 
provides additional appropriations to 
put a Band-Aid on some of these prob-
lems for a few more months. 
For example, this bill includes nearly 
$2 billion in funding for children and 
families flooding the border. Providing 
more funding without changing the 
policies that led to this crisis will only 
encourage more migrants to come. 
Second, it is unfortunate this bill 
will be rushed through the House today 
with just hours to spare to avoid a gov-
ernment shutdown. The American peo-
ple continue to wonder why Congress 
can’t get its job done until the very 
last minute and why we don’t have 
more time to review legislation. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the 
chair of the Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for 
yielding. 
I rise to support this continuing reso-
lution that will keep our Federal Gov-
ernment open and deliver the vital 
services that impact us all. 
Look no further than Southwest 
Florida, in my home State, where Hur-
ricane Ian inflicted tragic human loss

September 30, 2022 
and massive property damage. While 
we pray for those who endured Ian’s 
wrath and those who still face it, let’s 
pass this continuing resolution and 
offer more than well wishes. 
Thankfully, President Biden declared 
a major disaster, unleashing extensive 
Federal aid and assistance for the 
counties hit by Ian. But this CR will 
allow FEMA and other Federal part-
ners to keep assistance flowing to Flor-
ida in our time of need, while also aid-
ing those hurting in Puerto Rico, Alas-
ka, New Mexico, and Mississippi. 
We cannot leave communities behind 
that are still picking up the pieces 
from disastrous floods, wildfires, and 
hurricanes, and even basic water sys-
tem failures. This Federal funding bill 
comes to their rescue by helping to 
meet long-term housing, infrastruc-
ture, and recovery needs. 
This CR also extends funding for 
vital Federal education, health, hous-
ing, and public safety programs. It 
keeps up school, job training, and child 
nutritional investments, and it keeps 
funds flowing to address badly needed 
affordable 
housing 
problems 
which 
plague so many families in Florida. 
Anyone who understands the housing 
struggles that millions of Americans 
face cannot possibly ignore the relief 
that this CR offers. This legislation 
also keeps America’s security intact, 
while also supporting those brave vet-
erans who defended us. 
This CR also confronts Russia’s fake 
elections to annex parts of Ukraine, 
whose families urgently need our sup-
port to defend global democracy and 
turn back a murderous communist ty-
rant. 
I am pleased that this continuing res-
olution before us reflects that van-
ishing breed of bipartisan, bicameral, 
negotiated compromise. 
I hope our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle respect that and honor 
the trust that Americans hand us to 
maintain an orderly economy and state 
of affairs. This CR provides that basic 
test of governance. 
Americans 
want 
our 
government 
funding bills to help reduce their cost 
of living, support their families, create 
good jobs, and combat climate change. 
This continuing funding legislation 
gives us the time we need to ensure our 
2023 bills will do exactly that. 
Let’s keep America running so Con-
gress can complete America’s critical 
fiscal work. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on be-
half of the people of the Sixth District 
of Virginia who are contacting my of-
fice right now expressing their outrage 
at this failed, do-nothing Democratic 
majority who has brought us to the 
brink of a government shutdown. They 
are furious, furious because Democrats 
control the House, the Senate, the 
White House, and still, here we are at 
the point where we have to keep the 
government running, and instead of 
confronting these crises that are lead-
ing us to this shutdown, this Demo-
cratic majority is kicking the can 
down the road until after the elections 
in November. 
The American people are furious at a 
broken, business-as-usual Washington 
that refuses to confront the crises. In 
fact, it exacerbates the crises created 
by President Biden and the Democratic 
majority. 
This continuing resolution we are 
voting on today, once again, makes 
clear that the Democrats’ business-as- 
usual Washington must end. 
Just look at some of these policies 
that Democrats have stuffed in this 
bill, thrown taxpayer dollars at Biden’s 
wide-open border crisis, the raging in-
flation crisis, and the skyrocketing en-
ergy crisis. 
$57.5 billion for DHS to continue 
wide-open border and amnesty policies 
that have allowed illegal migrants to 
pour across our southern border and 
drug 
cartels 
to 
smuggle 
deadly 
fentanyl into our communities under 
Secretary Mayorkas’ failed leadership. 
$10.8 billion for the FBI that the 
Biden administration has weaponized 
against Americans who disagree with 
its policies, including parents con-
cerned about their kids in schools. 
$12.6 billion for the IRS, on top of the 
$80 billion that Democrats just gave to 
hire 87,000 new agents to spy into the 
bank accounts of Americans and con-
duct more audits on small businesses. 
$728 billion to a Department of De-
fense that is more focused on pro-
moting the radical left’s woke ideology 
than protecting our national security 
here at home and abroad. 
$3.8 billion for a Low Income Housing 
Energy Assistance Program that pays 
for the increased energy costs for those 
that live in anti-fracking States like 
New York, without addressing the real 
cause of the energy crisis, which is the 
Democrats’ socialist Green New Deal 
agenda. 
Americans are hurting and their pay-
checks are declining in value, but 
Democrats continue to fund these out- 
of-touch policies, and that is why I am 
voting ‘‘no.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Virginia. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
are hurting. Their paychecks are de-
clining in value, but Democrats con-
tinue to fund these out-of-touch poli-
cies with billions of taxpayer dollars 
from hardworking Americans. That is 
why I am voting ‘‘no.’’ I hope my col-
leagues will join me. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
b 1130 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman of the Committee on 
Appropriations for all she has done to 
get us to the point where we are able to 
pass this continuing resolution today. 
In June, House Democrats and Re-
publicans came together to pass, by an 
overwhelming supermajority, a sweep-
ing package of reforms at the Food and 
Drug Administration. That bipartisan 
legislation would strengthen the integ-
rity of the accelerated approval pro-
gram, foster innovation, improve clin-
ical trial diversity, and reauthorize the 
agency’s medical product user fee pro-
grams. Those user fee programs help 
fund FDA reviews for safety and effi-
cacy of drugs and medical devices. 
While the House concluded its work 
in June, the Senate failed to act. As 
soon as we passed our legislation 
through the House, I reached out to 
Ranking Member RODGERS
and the 
Democratic and Republican leaders of 
the Senate HELP Committee to begin 
bipartisan, bicameral conversations to 
come to an agreement on a package of 
mutually agreeable FDA reforms. 
After weeks of negotiations, our 
talks hit a temporary roadblock with 
Senator BURR, the Republican ranking 
member of the Senate HELP Com-
mittee, but we stayed at the table, and 
eventually, the negotiations were fruit-
ful. We were able to come together to 
find common ground across several 
meaningful policy areas. 
Unfortunately, despite this progress, 
Senate Minority Leader MCCONNELL 
decided to stand in the way of enacting 
bipartisan policies to improve public 
health. Senator MCCONNELL threatened 
to hold up government funding if our 
FDA reforms were included in the con-
tinuing resolution we are debating 
today. 
While I am pleased that we are reau-
thorizing user fees, which will prevent 
layoffs at the agency and allow the 
FDA to continue its mission, I will 
continue pushing for the widely sup-
ported improvements at the agency. 
I have secured commitments from 
Senators MURRAY and BURR, as well as 
Ranking Member RODGERS, to continue 
working to finalize a package of FDA 
reforms before the continuing resolu-
tion expires in December, and I look 
forward to taking meaningful action in 
the near future. For now, I encourage 
Members to support continuing the 
work at the FDA by voting in favor of 
the continuing resolution. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the 
preamble 
to 
the 
Constitution 
states that its purpose is, in part, to 
‘‘secure the blessings of liberty to our-
selves and our posterity.’’ Are we doing 
that today? 
This legislation represents Congress 
at its worst. We are voting to let gov-
ernment funding expire on December 
16, just days after dozens of Democrats 
are fired by the voters on November 8. 
But before this Congress adjourns and 
new 
courageous 
conservatives 
are 
sworn in, Congress wants to stick it to 
the American people one more time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8349 
September 30, 2022 
The funding for 2023 and beyond 
should reflect the will of the people and 
how they vote on November 8 when 
they reject the policies under which 
they are suffering today. 
No Republican in the Senate should 
have, and no Republican in this House, 
and even those on the other side, 
should give one more cent to a govern-
ment that doesn’t care about our bor-
der but wants to send $12 billion more 
to secure the border of Ukraine. 
We should not fund a government 
that is allowing an invasion across our 
southern border and is giving hundreds 
of millions of dollars to the countries 
that are facilitating that just south of 
our border. 
We should be cutting our spending 
and not increasing inflation by more 
massive spending, as reflected in this 
package today. 
We should support American energy 
production, not subsidize unreliable en-
ergy and Biden’s gas price hike. 
We should not be funding the hiring 
of 87,000 new IRS agents to go after 
regular, hardworking Americans. 
We should end the vaccine mandate 
and the COVID China virus emergency 
and not fund an administration that 
wants to fire healthcare workers be-
cause they don’t get a vaccine. 
All Republicans should oppose this 
CR, not give one more vote for one 
more cent for this tyrannical govern-
ment that is hurting all Americans. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this continuing res-
olution. 
In addition to averting a disastrous 
government shutdown, this legislation 
provides critical funding to continue 
our support for Ukraine, resettle Af-
ghan refugees, support communities 
impacted by natural disasters, and help 
low-income families heat their homes 
this winter. 
However, we still have work to do as 
this package lacks funding to support 
our public health response to COVID–19 
and monkeypox, also known as MPV. 
Our public health workforce is de-
pleted and exhausted from battling the 
COVID–19 pandemic over the last 2 
years. They cannot stop the spread of 
these outbreaks without additional 
Federal support. 
Both viruses disproportionately im-
pact 
low-income 
communities 
and 
communities of color. Congressional 
inaction will deepen these disparities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote today to avert a government shut-
down and then join us in working on 
long-term funding bills that address 
these public health crises and the other 
priorities of the American people. 
I want to end by thanking the ex-
traordinary chairwoman of the Com-
mittee 
on 
Appropriations, 
ROSA 
DELAURO, for her leadership in negoti-
ating today’s legislation and thanking 
her for all she has done. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship. 
I am very glad to say that there is 
something that responsibility calls you 
to do: save lives. This CR indicates 
that we will not shut the government 
down in the face of disasters around 
the world. We will not freeze out low- 
income families by not providing them 
with the home energy assistance pro-
gram. And, yes, we will ensure that 
agencies like housing and health and 
public safety, to reduce the crime 
across America, to respond to the 
needs of our police officers and victims 
of crime, will not shut down. 
But, yes, we will also recognize that 
we are good neighbors. In Pakistan, 33 
million people have been dislocated be-
cause of catastrophic floods of Biblical 
proportions. Mothers are about to de-
liver babies, 70,000 of them, and we can 
help them as USAID goes and does its 
work internationally. 
I am glad that we are putting a stop 
sign on closing the government down. I 
wish our friends on the other side 
would join us. 
Finally, I want us to give more 
money to the hostage section of the 
Department of State because people 
like Brittney Griner are in cages in 
Russia, and we have to get our hos-
tages out. Americans are looking for 
America to stand by their side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman very much and 
again applaud her persistence in help-
ing the American people. 
As I finish, on the issue of Brittney 
Griner, introducing this to many of our 
colleagues that don’t know, she is a 
hostage in Putin’s Russia. Playing bas-
ketball there was her only crime, if 
you will. There she is, in a cage in Rus-
sia, a hostage since February. 
We have a department that works on 
this issue inside the Department of 
State. I want to implore them and 
make sure they have the resources for 
the many Americans who are inno-
cently held by countries around the 
world. It is a tragedy and a shame that 
we have a circumstance where Ameri-
cans cannot travel. I am grateful for 
that support. 
I am also grateful to acknowledge, if 
you will, the Disaster Relief Fund for 
our domestic crises. As I said earlier, a 
man was interviewed in Florida and 
said: I have lost everything, my house 
and everything in it. 
There are a million people with no 
access to power, so this is a crucial and 
important CR. Puerto Rico is in need. 
It is a crucial and important CR. We al-
ways stand to hand out to our friends 
around the Nation and around the 
world. That is the United States of 
America. That is why we are passing 
the CR. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 6833: the Continuing Res-
olution to fund the federal government through 
December 16, 2022. 
I commend our colleagues in the Senate 
and the House for crafting this bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement that keeps the federal 
government fully operational without any inter-
ruption. 
The agreement that led to this Continuing 
Resolution reflects our commitment to the poli-
cies on which Americans rely. 
It reassures the American people that our 
government will continue to deliver all services 
while negotiations continue on funding federal 
agencies, programs, activities, and services 
for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2023. 
Passing this continuing resolution might ap-
pear to be a basic ministerial act; but it is ac-
tually much more than that and highly con-
sequential. 
Throughout my 27 years of service in Con-
gress, I have never lost sight of my principal 
responsibilities to my constituents and to the 
American people. 
Paramount among them are two priorities: 
to do everything we can to keep our country 
and our people safe, and to provide the vitally 
necessary services and activities that preserve 
and enhance quality-of-life standards for all 
Americans. 
Keeping our country safe includes protecting 
Americans from: 
domestic terrorism and violent extremism, 
public health pandemics, 
aggression from adversarial countries and 
non-country actors, 
environmental hazards to our air and water, 
food and drug contamination, 
racially based hate crimes, and 
gun violence, which we advanced this sum-
mer by enacting the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act. 
Maintaining vital services includes providing: 
health care and public health programs, 
food stamps and SNAP funding, 
clean air and water standards, 
weather forecasting to enable resilience 
against natural disasters and FEMA funding to 
help rebuild lives and communities after they 
strike, 
child nutrition and immunizations, 
education programs and funding, 
economic and business support programs 
that help create jobs and entrepreneurial op-
portunities, 
workplace safety protections and safeguards 
for employee rights, 
prosecution of crimes and protections of civil 
rights, 
housing assistance and homelessness pre-
vention assistance, 
broadband and other communication serv-
ices, 
medical research and healthcare innovation, 
American leadership in the world commu-
nity, and 
myriad other services and programs that are 
synonymous with service to all Americans, es-
pecially those who are most in need of a help-
ing hand to uplift themselves and thrive. 
Both of these goals—keeping Americans 
safe and providing vital services—require that 
the federal government and all of its programs 
remain fully operational at all times without 
any interruption, especially a disruption due to 
political discord.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8350 
September 30, 2022 
It is incumbent upon Congress to pass ap-
propriations bills that enable the federal gov-
ernment to fulfill its diverse mandates. 
With 535 members of the House and Sen-
ate, is essential that we negotiate, com-
promise, and reach agreements to ensure that 
the government will deliver for the American 
people on all activities that we are entrusted to 
perform. 
Failure is not an option because the con-
sequences on peoples’ lives and livelihoods 
would be far too great to bear. 
Failure would debilitate our economy, elimi-
nate jobs, and devastate family finances. 
Failure would mean that: 
the health of Americans would suffer, 
more people would become homeless, 
production of food would be limited and its 
safety put at risk, 
public safety would be impaired, 
rebuilding from natural disasters would grind 
to a halt, 
veterans and Social Security recipients 
would not receive their checks, and 
the global stature of the United States would 
be diminished, among many other unaccept-
able outcomes. 
These are just some of the reasons why I 
support passage of this Continuing Resolution. 
It is imperative that we keep the federal 
government open and fully functional over the 
next few months as we continue to craft ap-
propriations legislation that will fuel the federal 
government for the remainder of this fiscal 
year. 
During this time, we will be able to craft lan-
guage to improve government operations, ad-
dress urgent needs, and accelerate forward- 
looking initiatives that will strengthen our coun-
try, ensure equity, and enhance opportunity for 
all Americans. 
Yet, some needs are already well recog-
nized. That is why I am particularly pleased 
that this bill not only continues funding for gov-
ernment programs and services at their cur-
rent rate, but also includes funding for critically 
necessary activities, and extends programs 
that would have expired. 
Some of the many provisions in the bill that 
would achieve these aims and which I fully 
support are the: 
$1 billion in aid to Jackson Mississippi to 
help them resolve their water crisis, 
$1 billion in Low Income Home Energy As-
sistance Program support to help low income 
families afford heat during the upcoming cold 
weather months, 
funding for victims of natural disasters that 
is needed to help them restore their homes 
and rebuild their lives, 
maintenance of social security customer 
service systems, 
$2 billion for the Community Development 
Block Grant Disaster Recovery program, 
extension of child and family services pro-
grams, 
extension of veterans’ health care and hous-
ing supports, 
fortification of cybersecurity by funding the 
newly created Office of the National Cyber Di-
rector, 
enhancement of the Judiciary’s court secu-
rity program, 
extension of the national flood insurance 
program, 
funding of the FDA to continue its activities, 
and 
$12.35 billion in aid to Ukraine that will en-
able them to combat Russia’s hegemony. 
Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution is 
crucial for the sustenance and resilience of the 
American people. 
I urge all my colleagues to support the Con-
tinuing Resolution so that we can keep the 
government operating while we negotiate a 
comprehensive bill to maintain programs, serv-
ices, and activities through the remainder of 
this fiscal year. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. NADLER). 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, there are 
many good things about this CR. One 
of the best is that it won’t shut down 
the government. 
It is shocking to me that our Repub-
lican colleagues seem to want to shut 
down the government, with all of these 
services and necessary things it does 
for the people of the United States. 
This CR does many good things. I 
want to focus on one of them, the 87,000 
extra new agents to be hired for en-
forcement by the Internal Revenue 
Service. That is an excellent thing be-
cause what will they do? They will go 
after the rich people. 
By the terms of the statute, by the 
terms of the CR, they cannot be used 
for enforcement of taxes against any-
body earning less than $400,000, so we 
are not talking about the middle class. 
The rich people in this country are 
cheating. They are cheating tremen-
dously. They are cheating to the tune 
of tens of billions of dollars because 
they know they can get away with it 
and because there is no manpower or 
womanpower to enforce the law. This 
will give us the manpower to enforce 
the law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from New York. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, this will 
give us the manpower to enforce the 
law and to make sure that the rich pay 
their fair share, and, therefore, there 
can be more services for the middle 
class and for low-income people in this 
country, which is exactly what the 
government is for. 
This is one of the best things it does. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote 
for the CR, in particular, because of 
the 87,000 extra agents that the Inter-
nal Revenue Service will have to en-
force taxes against rich tax cheats. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We need this bill. We need this bill to 
continue negotiating final 2023 funding 
bills. 
With the bill before us, what is in 
this bill, and why is it so onerous to 
some? 
We provide relief to working fami-
lies, our schools, our children, small 
businesses, and communities across 
this Nation. 
We support the people of Ukraine. We 
support them in what is the fight for 
their lives, for their democracy, and for 
world democracy against Russian ag-
gression. 
We protect communities everywhere 
in need of safe water. We help to re-
build them from crushing natural dis-
asters. 
This bill will make a very real dif-
ference in the lives of Americans ev-
erywhere, and I am proud to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting these 
bills, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we all 
know we must pass the CR to keep the 
government open. But this bill is a 
wasted opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
thank Chair DELAURO for her diligent work to 
bring this CR to the floor in order to fund the 
essential services of the federal government at 
a time when our Nation needs stable govern-
ance. 
As Chair of the House Energy and Water 
Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased 
that this bill provides $20 million in emergency 
funding to the Corps of Engineers for pre-
viously authorized water and wastewater infra-
structure improvements, which can be used in 
Jackson, Mississippi. 
I also appreciate the inclusion of $1 billion 
for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance 
Program to help address pressure on low-in-
come households’ pocketbooks due to inflation 
caused by pandemic-related supply chain 
backups and global energy disruption due to 
Russia’s war on Ukraine. 
As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I am grateful for the inclusion 
of a new U.S. funding package that will deliver 
urgently-needed weapons, equipment, aid, 
and support to America’s friend and ally 
Ukraine in her valiant battle for Liberty against 
Putin’s tyranny. 
We have more work ahead of us to pass 
the full slate of appropriations bills—including 
our Energy and Water bill to invest in Amer-
ican progress, American jobs, American fami-
lies, and the future of American communities. 
Today, we take a responsible step forward 
to keep the government open—and we con-
tinue our work to deliver for the American peo-
ple. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1404, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the motion by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

FAIRNESS FOR 9/11 FAMILIES ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 1404, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 8987) to amend the Justice for 
United States Victims of State Spon-
sored Terrorism Act to authorize ap-
propriations for catch-up payments 
from the United States Victims of 
State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1404, an 
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117–68 is adopted, and 
the bill, as amended, is considered 
read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 8987 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fairness for 9/ 
11 Families Act’’. 
SEC. 2. APPROPRIATIONS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 404(d)(4)(C) of the 
Justice for United States Victims of State Spon-
sored Terrorism Act (34 U.S.C. 20144(d)(4)(C)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(iv) AUTHORIZATION.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—The Special Master shall 
authorize lump sum catch-up payments in

clauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (iii). 
‘‘(II) APPROPRIATIONS.— 
‘‘(aa) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to 
be appropriated and there are appropriated to 
the Fund such sums as are necessary to carry 
out this clause, to remain available until ex-
pended. 
‘‘(bb) 
LIMITATION.—Amounts

Loans Program Account, CARES Act’’, for car-
rying out paragraphs (36) and (37) of section 
7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)), 
$2,982,000,000 are hereby rescinded. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 8987. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Fairness for 9/11 
Families Act would provide a catch-up 
payment to thousands of 9/11 victims, 
spouses, and dependents who were un-
fairly excluded from the U.S. Victims 
of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund 
when it was first established in 2015. 
While no amount of money can ever 
make up for the incalculable loss that 
they suffered on September 11, this leg-
islation would ensure that they are 
fairly compensated for their claims 
against those responsible for one of our 
Nation’s darkest days. 
In 2015, Congress created the United 
States Victims of State Sponsored Ter-
rorism Fund to provide compensation 
for individuals with terrorism judg-
ments against designated state spon-
sors of terrorism. 
At the time, those who had received 
payments from the September 11th 
Victim Compensation Fund—primarily 
victims, spouses, and children—were 
precluded from receiving funds from 
the VSSTF. 
Their exclusion from the fund led to 
a perverse result by which other family 
members who were not eligible for pay-
ments under the VCF could receive 
compensation 
from 
the 
VSSTF—in 
some cases, substantially more than 
what was paid out under the VCF— 
while victims, spouses, and children 
were excluded from the fund, despite 
also having claims. 
Congress corrected this injustice in 
2019, and a year later it tasked the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
with calculating a lump-sum catch-up 
payment that would bring those who 
initially had been wrongly excluded 
from the VSSTF into parity with those 
individuals who had been included in 
the fund when it was first created. 
The Fairness for 9/11 Families Act 
fully funds these catch-up payments, 
offset by funds no longer needed to im-
plement the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. I thank Senators MENENDEZ and 
SCHUMER for their partnership on this 
legislation and for all of their efforts to 
provide justice and support to 9/11 fam-
ilies over the years. 
I also thank the many victims and 
family members whose advocacy and 
determination were essential to bring-
ing this legislation forward. Although 
nothing can make up for 20 years of 
missed birthdays, anniversaries, and 
memories for those who lost loved ones 
on September 11, I hope that these 
funds can provide some measure of 
comfort and justice to the people 
whose lives were changed forever that 
day. 
As we pass this legislation, we must 
not forget the survivors and first re-
sponders who continue to suffer the 
health effects of the 9/11 attacks. As I 
always have, I will continue to fight to 
ensure that these people have the care 
they need. We can, and we must, look 
after everyone who was affected that 
fateful day. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support the Fairness for 9/11 Families 
Act, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the families of the 9/11 
victims have our deepest sympathies. 
They have spent the last 20 years seek-
ing justice through a maze of red tape. 
Due to errors made with how funds to 
compensate victims were structured, a 
disparity emerged between the com-
pensation received by differently situ-
ated 9/11 families. This legislation 
would help remedy that inequity. 
Behind the scenes, we have been 
working to solve this problem for 
years. Unfortunately, the Democrats 
have not been particularly interested. 
During the last few years of trying to 
resolve this matter, the Judiciary 
Committee has not held a single hear-
ing or markup to evaluate the prob-
lems with victims funds or how to best 
address the problem. 
In fact, according to a GAO study re-
quired by Congress, the shortfall owed 
to 9/11 families amounts to $2.7 billion. 
The proposal before us takes from 
COVID relief money that Congress ap-
propriated for small businesses to 
make 9/11 families whole. 
There are potential solutions to this 
problem that we should have put for-
ward earlier. Unfortunately, because 
Chairman NADLER
has declined to 
allow the Judiciary Committee to con-
sider these other possibilities, we are 
left with just the bill before us today. 
I do think it is important to recog-
nize that we are here today thanks to 
the hard work of the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) and 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH). 
I 
know 
Congresswoman 
MALLIOTAKIS and Congressman SMITH 
have been working tirelessly on this 
during this entire Congress. It would 
have been nice to have their bill before 
our committee for some debate. We 
never would have gotten to a place of 
finding a solution for these victims 
without their tireless efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote and 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. NADLER) for work that is long 
overdue, and the Senators in the other 
body, as well. 
I lived through 9/11, as many of us 
who have served in this Congress did. I 
lived through the terror, the horror, 
the horrific scenes that were unspeak-
able and unbelievable. I lived through 
them with the same sense of this could 
not be America. 
I was in this building as the planes 
hit the Pentagon. We did not get the 
direct information about the World 
Trade Center, but as we were screamed 
at to get out and flee, as we ran with-
out knowledge, I could see the bil-
lowing smoke, as the plane had already 
hit the Pentagon. 
Never in our lives since World War II 
and Pearl Harbor had I seen or heard 
about, if you will, such atrocities and

violence. Imagine those families, never 
being able to bury their loved ones. 
I went to Ground Zero by train be-
cause at that time planes were not in 
the air. I was insistent, as a member of 
the beginning of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, to go there with a 
former Senator. We went to the very 
site. 
No, there was no rescuing at that 
time; it was recovering. 
We saw those fire department per-
sonnel, firemen, and law enforcement 
guarding 
this 
sacred 
place. 
Those 
firepersons would get a whistle blown 
when someone who had been digging 
found the remnants of a body, pieces of 
bones, and because they wanted to 
honor those families, they would blow 
the whistle and a gurney would come, 
and they would put what they found on 
the gurney. 
That is what this bill is all about. It 
is to be able to say that families have 
suffered unconscionably, and that due 
to their own government withholding 
payments due to them and only incre-
mentally dribbling them out in small 
amounts over the years, the families 
have faced financial hardship. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this would provide financial relief for 
the families of those murdered by the 
terrorists by helping to put more dol-
lars in this victims’ fund, more so than 
the Victim Compensation Fund, to pro-
vide them with catch-up payments that 
they did not get. That is important to 
do. 
Mr. Speaker, might I say that I vis-
ited with the Uvalde families this past 
Monday. Their pain is deep, and it is 
the same. They don’t have a handle on 
these compensation funds. They are 
suffering. And as this has evidenced, 
that you must always ease the suf-
fering of those who you cannot replace 
their loved ones, I look forward to 
working with the chairman on helping 
these Uvalde families in their suf-
fering. 
I support this legislation. I thank the 
chairman, and I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 8987. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to wholeheartedly and 
enthusiastically support H.R. 8987, the ‘‘Fair-
ness for 9/11 Families Act’’. 
I commend my colleague and friend, Chair-
man JERRY NADLER, for introducing this bill 
and bringing it before the House today. 
This legislation provides us the opportunity 
to ‘‘do right’’ for the families who suffered di-
rectly from the heinous acts and carnage per-
petrated on our nation on September 11th, 
2001. 
H.R. 8987 would provide financial relief to 
the families of those murdered by terrorists on 
September 11th by providing lump sum catch- 
up payments to them of the funds to which 
they are entitled from the United States Vic-
tims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. 
When the Victims of State Sponsored Ter-
rorism Fund was created, it did not allow for 
payments to families who already received 
some payments from the Victims Compensa-
tion Fund, even though they were clearly with-
in the scope of the new fund. 
This error was corrected later, but the fami-
lies still have not received the catch-up pay-
ments to which they were entitled to provide 
them the financial assistance that they would 
have received if the initial error had not been 
made. 
This legislation would provide them with 
lump-sum payments to immediately correct 
that injustice. 
Needless to say, these families have suf-
fered enough, and it unconscionable that they 
should be subjected to further suffering due to 
their own government withholding payments 
due to them, and only incrementally dribbling 
them out in small amounts over many years. 
The families have faced financial hardship 
since that day, partly due to the loss of their 
loved one’s income, and just as directly, by 
the inability to focus on employment while 
coping with their loss of a loved one through 
that unspeakable national tragedy. 
The events of September 11th were among 
the most horrifying, frightening, and shocking 
that I have ever endured. That day, I was at 
the Capitol and experienced the frantic panic 
of being rushed off of the Capitol grounds 
when we feared that Flight 93 was aiming to-
ward us. 
And yet, my experience that day was inci-
dental and transitory compared to the life-al-
tering devastation that was felt that day and 
every day since then by the families of those 
who were killed in the airplanes and in the 
buildings that were struck. 
Any time a loved one is abruptly and 
unforeseeably killed by violence or an acci-
dent, their surviving family members are dev-
astated and debilitated, with a lengthy adjust-
ment period that sometimes is never resolved. 
In the case of the 9/11 victims and families, 
the aftermath of grief, mourning, and inca-
pacity was protracted and compounded. 
This was initially due to the uniquely hei-
nous and horrible circumstances of 9/11, and 
thereafter due to the annual national memo-
rials and the ubiquitous reminders of the trag-
edy that is embedded in the national con-
sciousness. 
These families are forever intertwined with 
the grief, sadness, and despondency associ-
ated with those acts of warfare against the 
United States. Thus, it is our responsibility, as 
the Congress of their United States, to 
prioritize their needs, revitalization, and com-
pensation since, in effect, their loved ones 
were lost in an act of war by enemy combat-
ants. 
Although we can never sufficiently com-
pensate the families for the loss of their loved 
ones, we must do all we can to support them 
and help them reclaim their productive lives. 
It is not too much to ask—indeed, it is the 
least we can do—to ensure that the funds al-
located to them be transmitted to them imme-
diately to ease their financial burdens and 
support their pursuit of fulfilling lives. 
The catch-up payments that were allocated 
to the families must be distributed to them 
promptly in lump sum payments for the dual 
sakes of fairness and solidarity with those 
whose sacrifice is enshrined in our national 
fabric. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH), who has been representing the 
good folks of his State for over four 
decades here in the United States Con-
gress and who has worked tirelessly on 
this issue. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) for his leadership 
and for his kind words. I thank the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
for sponsoring this extraordinarily im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, everyone remembers 
where they were and what they were 
doing—I 
was 
in 
Washington 
here 
chairing a Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
hearing—when 
a 
group 
of 
radical 
jihadists hijacked four airliners to per-
petrate the worst act of terrorism in 
American history. 
Today, 21 years later, we remember 
the horror and pain suffered by those 
who were murdered and the anguish 
felt by their families and friends both 
then and now. 
On the morning of 9/11, I got a mere 
glimpse into the sense of horror suf-
fered by the victims’ families when I 
couldn’t reach my own brother, Tom, 
an American Airlines 757 captain who 
often piloted Flight 11 from Logan to 
L.A., the flight that crashed into the 
north tower. After several hours, when 
I finally made contact, he was okay, 
but he was friends with the crew of 
Flight 11, all who were killed that day. 
I ask my colleagues to strongly sup-
port H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/11 
Families Act. This legislation address-
es a significant shortcoming in pro-
grams made available to the widows 
and children of 9/11. 
As I think Members know, in 2015, 
Congress created the United States 
Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism 
Fund 
to 
provide 
compensation 
to 
Americans injured in acts of inter-
national state-sponsored terrorism. De-
spite the obvious connection to the 9/11 
surviving family members, however, a 
misinterpretation of the law by the 
fund’s special master unjustly barred 
spouses and children of 9/11 from par-
ticipating in the fund. 
In 2021, at the behest of Congress, the 
GAO conducted an investigation and 
found that 5,364 victims, spouses, and 
dependents were excluded from the fair 
restitution due to a technicality in the 
administration of the Victims of State 
Sponsored Terrorism Fund. 
H.R. 8987 provides immediate relief, 
with a lump-sum catch-up payment to 
the victims’ immediate families. 
For two decades, Mr. Speaker, I have 
worked 
with 
the 
Jersey 
Girls 
to 
achieve justice—that is what they call 
themselves—wonderful, wonderful wid-
ows who have tried to achieve justice 
for those who committed these horrific 
crimes and for those who suffered and 
were left behind. 
Because of them, we got the 9/11 
Commission. I was the chief Repub-
lican sponsor of that bill, but that 
wasn’t because of what we did here as 
much as it was because of the work

that they did in walking the halls and 
trying to get people to support a 9/11 
fund. 
I point out to my colleagues that 
Tom Kean, our former Governor, head-
ed that up, along with Lee Hamilton, 
the distinguished former chairman of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. What 
they produced after their hearings be-
came the blueprint to protect America. 
As they noted in their opening state-
ment—and 
I 
chaired two hearings 
about implementing the report—what 
they said was, We are safer but not 
safe, and they prescribed both adminis-
trative and legislative actions that 
should be undertaken to protect Amer-
ica. 
I would note that Kathie Wisniewski, 
who works on my staff, and lost her 
husband, 
Alan, 
is 
with 
us 
today, 
Kristen Breitweiser; Mindy Kleinberg; 
Lorie Van Auken; Kathy Maher and her 
sons, Joseph and Daniel; and the next 
generation of 9/11 family advocates, in-
cluding Angela Mistrulli and Brett 
Eagleson, who lost his parents on 9/11, 
were the driving force in achieving this 
win today, which, again, is a modicum 
of justice for their egregious loss. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS, our colleague from Stat-
en Island, for her work on this and her 
bill, as well as the chairman’s bill, 
which has a pay-for. I think this is an 
important, important piece of legisla-
tion. I hope every Member of the body 
will support it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Fairness for 9/11 Fami-
lies Act. 
9/11 is a day that left an indelible 
mark on all of us. We all remember 
where we were. When the towers fell, 
they took so many innocent lives, and 
the families left suffered irreplaceable 
loss. This bill would provide catch-up 
payments to 9/11 survivors, spouses, 
and dependents, who were unfairly ex-
cluded from the U.S. Victims of State 
Sponsored Terrorism Fund. While no 
amount of money can make up for 
their loss, this bill would fairly com-
pensate them for their claims against 
those responsible for one of our Na-
tion’s darkest days. 
It would provide some relief to people 
like my constituents: Gail Eagleson, 
who lost her husband, Bruce, on 9/11, 
and her son, Brett Eagleson, who lost 
his father on 9/11. He was just 15 years 
old. That dark day Bruce saved lives. 
He was an incredible human being, a 
devoted husband, father, and friend. In 
helping to save lives, he lost his own. 
Bruce would be proud to know that 
his son, Brett, has led the charge on 
this fight. I have been so proud to work 
with him. It is an honor to work with 
him to get this done. He never gave up. 
The families never gave up. 
While we cannot fill the hole in the 
hearts of these families, we can say, We 
understand your sacrifice, your loss, 
and make justice work on your behalf. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with all these fami-
lies. Do the right thing. Support this 
critical legislation. It is so long over-
due.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS), who has worked so hard 
on this issue this entire Congress. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, al-
though 21 years have passed, the pain 
we experienced on September 11, 2001, 
when terrorists unleashed deadly and 
calculated destruction across our coun-
try has not faded. 
Those that have empty chairs at 
their dinner tables, the widows, the 
widowers, the children of those that 
perished in that attack, they are still 
fighting for their entitled compensa-
tion under the United States Victims 
of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. 
Frankly, the exclusion of the 5,364 
widows and children from this fund was 
an injustice that Congress should have 
never allowed to happen. As a result of 
their initial exclusion, widows and 
children missed the first two payments 
from the terrorism fund, creating a 
massive disparity between their restor-
ative justice payments that others, in-
cluding people like Madeline Bergin 
and Jeanette Schardt from my district, 
who lost their husbands, FDNY fire-
fighters, on that dreadful day. 
This bill, which I drafted and intro-
duced on August 5, would catch up wid-
ows and children to our victims’ groups 
and ensure that moving forward they 
are no longer left out, forgotten, or ex-
cluded. This bill rights a grave wrong 
that should have been corrected long 
ago. 
Today with us earlier was Angela 
Mistrulli, the head of the 9/11 Children 
for Justice, someone who was also af-
fected, a tireless advocate for the wid-
ows and children and someone who has 
become a good friend to me and my of-
fice. 
For nearly 6 months we had been 
working together on this issue and this 
legislation. Today, I am proud that the 
work we have done is being brought to 
this floor and that the widows and chil-
dren are one step closer to their enti-
tled compensation. 
I thank Chairman NADLER, Ranking 
Member JORDAN, CHRIS SMITH, and my 
other colleague, KATHLEEN RICE, who 
made this a bipartisan bill, for their 
support and their help in getting this 
done. 
President Truman once said, ‘‘It is 
amazing what you can accomplish 
when you do not care who gets the 
credit.’’ This case is no different. 
So many people have come together 
from across the political spectrum to 
correct a wrong that should have been 
done, as I said, years ago. I am so 
proud and honored to have been a part 
of this process and bringing these won-
derful people, people who lost so much, 
some justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member in 
this Chamber, on both sides of the 
aisle, to vote in support of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act, 
another vital step to support our Sep-
tember 11 heroes and their families. 
I salute Chairman NADLER for his 
committed leadership in bringing this 
legislation to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 11, our 
Nation 
watched 
in 
horror 
as 
unfathomable acts of terror unfolded 
on our soil, gripped by an unthinkable 
nightmare. 
For thousands of families, it was 
only the beginning: Children growing 
up without a mom or dad by their side; 
missing smiles at dance recitals and 
soccer games; empty seats at gradua-
tions and weddings and baptisms. 
Yet, in the wake of such harrowing 
tragedy, these grieving families rallied 
together, channeling their sorrow into 
solidarity, transforming their pain into 
purpose, mobilizing their agony into 
advocacy. Some of them were very 
much responsible for us getting a 9/11 
Commission, which some in Congress 
had resisted. Without their outside mo-
bilization, it would not have happened. 
Congress and the country greatly ad-
mire the courage of the survivors and 
families who have come together to 
make their voices heard. 
In fact, it was my honor to host 
many of them in the Capitol just ear-
lier this month, to listen to their mov-
ing stories and learn how we can con-
tinue to support them. 
This is an injustice, as was described. 
Moved by their remarkable resilience, 
the House has worked relentlessly over 
the years to honor our solemn promise 
to the 9/11 families. We passed the 
Zadroga Act to ensure that they could 
receive help from the September 11th 
Victim Compensation Fund; and we 
passed the Never Forget the Heroes Act 
to permanently authorize those funds. 
But there is still more to be done to 
ensure they get every last cent they 
are due. I don’t know that any money 
really makes up for their loss; but 
what they are due, they should receive. 
The Fairness for 9/11 Families Act 
corrects an outrageous injustice, fi-
nally delivering the $2.7 billion that 
these families are owed from the 
United States Victims of State Spon-
sored Terrorism Fund. This initiative 
was established to support Americans 
devastated by evils of international 
terror, but for years, the wives, hus-
bands, and children of those killed on 9/ 
11 were refused assistance from this 
particular fund, even as more distant 
relatives received compensation. 
Yes, they were getting funds from an 
earlier fund, but if you got money from 
the earlier fund, you couldn’t get

money from this additional fund. This 
is about fairness today. 
As Democrats took the majority, we 
ended this unconscionable disparity. 
Today, we vote to make them whole, 
delivering 
the 
benefits 
they 
were 
wrongfully 
denied. 
No 
amount 
of 
money can replace those who were sto-
len away, nor restore the memories and 
moments that could have been; but 
with this legislation, we can further 
ease two decades of anguish, and we 
can take another step to ensure that 
justice is done. I am so pleased it is 
being done in a bipartisan way, because 
at the start, that was not the case. 
President Lincoln once cautioned 
against the ‘‘silent artillery of time’’— 
the slow, steady fading of our Nation’s 
collective memory. 
For 21 years, these families have 
served as a bulwark against that silent 
threat. Here today, let us stand with 
them and renew our sacred promise to 
never forget. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a resounding and 
bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ and, hopefully, a 
unanimous vote so that we may em-
power thousands of Americans to begin 
finding the peace that they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, as I have the floor, I 
also rise in strong support of the con-
tinuing resolution to keep government 
open and working for the people. This 
legislation ensures full government 
funding through December 16, giving 
appropriators more time to reach bi-
partisan, bicameral agreement on fund-
ing levels for the upcoming fiscal year. 
It includes critical funding to sup-
port Ukraine, to respond to natural 
disasters, and to advance many addi-
tional key priorities. 
I thank ROSA DELAURO, chair of the 
Committee on Appropriations, for her 
strong 
values-driven 
leadership 
to 
bring forth this necessary legislation. 
As I always say, as an appropriator my-
self, left to their own devices, the ap-
propriators will find a bipartisan path. 
I thank Rosa for her ongoing work to 
assemble an omnibus government fund-
ing package that honors our values as 
a Nation. That is the next step. 
Today, we proceed with this legisla-
tion. As we do, war rages on in 
Ukraine. With the legislation we pass 
today, Congress secures an additional 
$12.3 billion for Ukraine-related prior-
ities, including security, economic and 
humanitarian aid to the historic and 
heroic Ukrainian people. 
This package comes at a pivotal mo-
ment as Ukraine’s freedom fighters 
work to turn the tide, liberating key 
cities and repelling Russian forces. 
When I traveled to Berlin for the G7 
Speakers’ Summit earlier this month, 
it was my privilege to hear directly 
from 
Ukraine 
Speaker 
Ruslan 
Stefanchuk, who offered an invaluable 
report on the state of the war. 
At 
those 
meetings, 
I 
reiterated 
America’s unbreakable, unshakeable 
commitment to stand with Ukraine in 
the fight for democracy. By the way, 
every other Speaker from the G7, they 
call them heads of parliament in some 
countries, spoke out strongly in favor 
of democracy in Ukraine. So it wasn’t 
just me talking about unbreakable, 
unshakeable commitment, others did, 
too. 
With this supplemental funding, we 
take another strong step to honor our 
country’s pledge. 
Alongside this critical package for 
Ukraine, this legislation directs sig-
nificant funding to help American fam-
ilies devastated by disaster. We con-
tinue to hold all of the families af-
fected by Hurricane Ian in our hearts 
and prayers during this difficult time, 
but we need money to help them. 
The $2 billion more in Community 
Development Block Grant Disaster Re-
covery funding in this bill will go to-
ward supporting Florida, as well as 
Puerto Rico, Alaska, and other com-
munities 
hit 
by 
catastrophe. 
But, 
again, we need more. 
We are also allowing FEMA to spend 
up to its entire year of funding, giving 
the agency access to an additional $18.9 
billion from FEMA’s disaster relief 
fund to quickly respond to disasters, 
especially appropriate now with Ian; 
and we will need more. 
Thanks to the leadership of Congress-
woman TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ, we 
are sending $2.5 billion to help New 
Mexicans begin to heal, recover, and 
rebuild after the Hermit’s Peak/Calf 
Canyon fire. She and the Members from 
New Mexico were very instrumental in 
making sure we were aware of the dis-
astrous mistake that was made in New 
Mexico and how we need to address it. 
At the same time, thanks to the im-
passioned advocacy of Congressman 
BENNIE THOMPSON, we secured $20 mil-
lion in Jackson, Mississippi, which is 
suffering a devastating water emer-
gency. This man-made disaster poses a 
direct threat to public health and de-
mands urgent action. 
Additionally, we are proud that this 
legislation includes $1 billion more for 
the Low Income Home Energy Assist-
ance Program, a vital lifeline to help 
families pay their bills and stay safe in 
their homes this winter. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a 
package for the people. I urge a strong 
bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ on the continuing res-
olution so that we may swiftly send 
this bill to the President’s desk. I hope 
that we will have a unanimous vote on 
the legislation, Fairness for 9/11 Fami-
lies to support our 9/11 heroes and their 
families. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, when our 
Nation was attacked on September 11, 
we made a commitment on that ter-
rible day to support the victims and 
their families. The Fairness for 9/11 
Families honors that commitment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

SUOZZI). All time for debate has ex-

COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE LENOX ROAD 
BAPTIST CHURCH 
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in commemora-
tion of the 150th anniversary of the 
Lenox Road Baptist Church and their 
150 years of selfless service as a spir-
itual home to the people of Central 
Brooklyn and all those who were 
blessed to cross their threshold in fel-
lowship with one another. 
It was a century-and-a-half ago, in 
the heart of Flatbush, that the Lenox 
Road Baptist Church was established 
as a beacon of love, light, and Christian 
discipleship. 
Over these many years, this sacred 
community of faith never failed to 
open its doors to any and all who were 
eager to hear and follow the teachings 
of Jesus Christ. 
For 150 years, those doors remained 
open to those in need of spiritual guid-
ance, communion of saints, and warm 
embrace. 
On this sacred anniversary, under the 
leadership 
of 
Pastor 
Kirkpatrick 
Cohall and his team, may the Lenox

Road Baptist Church continue to grow

God’s word, blessing His holy name, up-
lifting the people in service to all hu-

HONORING HERB ELFRING 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor World War II veteran 
Herb Elfring of Jackson, Michigan, for 
his distinguished service to our coun-
try. Herb truly embodies the very best 
of America and the Greatest Genera-
tion. 
Herb turned 100 years old earlier this 
year, and he is one of a very few sur-
vivors of the Pearl Harbor attack to 
still be alive. 
From 1940 to 1945, Herb served in the 
U.S. Army National Guard and was sta-
tioned in Hawaii at the time of the at-
tack, barely avoiding fire from Japa-
nese planes. Herb would earn pro-
motions and various medals for his 
bravery in the line of duty. 
Herb and his late wife, Ruth, were 
married for 57 years and had five chil-
dren, eight grandchildren, and seven 
great-grandchildren. 
To this day, Herb remains active in 
the Jackson community. 
Thank you, Herb, for your service to 
our country and legacy in the Jackson 
community.

RECOGNIZING THE 
CONGRESSIONAL WORKERS UNION 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the bravery and ini-
tiative of the Congressional Workers 
Union. 
On Monday, my staff became the first 
in the 233-year history of this Congress 
to form a union, with a unanimous 
vote. I look forward to bargaining a 
just contract to set strong standards 
for the years ahead. 
The CWU has also announced that 
staff in the offices of Congresswoman 
OMAR
and Congressman KHANNA
are 
voting to form unions, as well. 
As it happens, the Jewish New Year 
began on Monday. It is a fitting time 
to mark a powerful new beginning for 
workers here on Capitol Hill. 
If we want Congress to have a work-
force that reflects America’s diversity; 
if we want poor and working-class peo-
ple to work here, not just the children 
of the wealthy; if we want to reduce 
turnover and increase the effectiveness 
and efficiency of our work, then it is 
high time we afford our staff a say in 
their working conditions. 
That is the journey we are embark-
ing on, and I am delighted to be a part 
of it. Friends, there is power in a 
union.

CONGRATULATING 
LT. 
COM-
MANDER MICHAEL D’ANGELO ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
Michael 
D’Angelo on his retirement from an in-
credibly distinguished career with the 
United States Navy. 
For more than 40 years, Lieutenant 
Commander D’Angelo has served our 
country with incredible dedication and 
honor. 
Upon graduation from Morris Catho-
lic High School in New Jersey, he pur-
sued a history degree at Penn State 
University. Enlisting after his gradua-
tion from Penn State, he began his ca-
reer in the Navy as a Persian-Farsi 
cryptologic linguist, eventually rising 
to rank of senior chief petty officer in 
2001. 
After years of hard work as a naval 
cryptologic officer, he attended the 
Naval Postgraduate School. Following 
graduation, he was deployed to Afghan-
istan in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom. He then returned to central 
Pennsylvania and set up roots in 
Ebensburg with his wife and seven chil-
dren, where he commanded the Navy 
Operational Support Center for 3 years. 
Lieutenant Commander D’Angelo had 
the unique experience of serving along-
side his son, Chief Petty Officer David 
D’Angelo, in Afghanistan. These men 
risked everything in the service of our 
great Nation, and we are forever grate-
ful to the D’Angelo family. 
Congratulations on your successful 
career and best wishes to you and your 
family in your next chapter. 
f 
HONORING WALTER MUNK 
(Mr. PETERS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today to honor the legacy of Walter 
Munk, a groundbreaking scientist and 
oceanographer 
who 
advanced 
our 
knowledge of waves, ocean tempera-
ture, the Earth’s rotation, and much 
more. 
Born in Austria, he eventually made 
his way to San Diego and enlisted in 
the Army as World War II approached. 
In 1941, Munk returned to San Diego’s 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography to 
work in the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound 
Laboratory. 
The scope of Walter Munk’s work was 
vast. He helped meteorologists predict 
the waves troops would face in Nor-
mandy during World War II and devel-
oped methods incorporated into mod-
ern tsunami warning networks. His 
passion for his work and for San Diego 
also led him to push to build the UC 
San Diego campus in the 1960s. 
Later in life, and bolstered by years 
of expertise, Munk brought attention 
to climate change and conferred with 
figures like Pope Francis and the Dalai 
Lama to advocate for action. His work 
earned him the National Medal of 
Science and the Kyoto Prize. 
In his honor, I have proclaimed Octo-
ber 19 Walter Munk World Oceans Day 
in California’s 52nd Congressional Dis-
trict. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
STEVE CHAZEN 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, on 
Sunday, friends and family will gather 
to celebrate the extraordinary life of 
Steve Chazen. As they do, I extend my 
deepest condolences to his wife, Pat, 
and his entire family. 
The Steve I knew was a trans-
formational leader, proud of his coun-
try and devoted to his loving family 
and community. His impact on Kern 
County and across America was enor-
mous. 
As a champion of American energy, 
he saw the value of investing in the 
Kern County oil patch. In 1998, he orga-
nized a masterful deal to purchase the 
Elk Hills Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
in my congressional district in Cali-
fornia. It was a huge gamble, but it 
paid off. Today, Kern County is re-
nowned for its energy production, 
largely because of the hard work of our 
oil workers and our embrace of innova-
tive technologies. 
The Elk Hills deal captures the es-
sence of Steve’s long and storied ca-
reer. He was a trendsetter, not a trend 
follower. Others took cues, Steve took 
smart risks. 
With his intellect and vision, his guts 
and wit, and his candor, Steve trans-
formed an industry and helped deliver 
American global energy leadership. 
I also appreciate that he didn’t mince 
words. His quips were legendary. He fa-
mously said, ‘‘Houston had bad weath-
er and good people. L.A. has great 
weather.’’ 
By the time we met, Steve was al-
ready a titan in industry, but I also 
saw another important side of Steve. I 
saw his boundless generosity. Here is 
the truth: Steve was a relentless phi-
lanthropist. When he wasn’t working, 
he was giving back to his community. 
Education, medicine, and environ-
ment, these are just a few of the many 
areas that benefited from Steve’s un-
selfish support. His impact was pro-
found. The most notable part is, Steve 
didn’t care about getting the credit. He 
was a great leader, but an even greater 
person. 
Finally, let me say a word about 
Steve’s selfless patriotism. For several 
years, Steve served his country as a ca-
nine handler in the Vietnam war. He 
didn’t talk about it much, but he was a 
decorated veteran. In Vietnam, Steve 
and his scout dog would find and dis-
able land mines in front of the rest of 
his unit.

September 30, 2022 
Dog handlers like Steve were so ef-
fective that they were special targets 
for the enemy. Only 13 of the 113 brave 
soldiers who trained with Steve re-
turned home. Yet because of their 
courage, more than 10,000 American 
lives were saved. Imagine for a moment 
if the Vietnam Memorial had another 
10,000 names on it. 
Whether it was his visionary leader-
ship, his philosophy, his pride in Amer-
ica, or his deep love for Pat, Steve was 
a great man. His life is an enduring ex-
ample of leadership and service, a re-
minder of our duty to help one another. 
As we celebrate his life and lasting 
impact, let’s lift up Pat and the entire 
Chazen family in our prayers, and let’s 
dedicate ourselves to continuing the 
lessons Steve instilled in us to improve 
our country.

SUSPENDING REQUIRED MINIMUM 
DISTRIBUTIONS 
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I pro-
posed H.R. 8331 to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to temporarily 
suspend required minimum distribu-
tion rules for certain retirement plans 
and accounts. 
I would like to briefly discuss these. 
These distributions are generally min-
imum amounts that retirement plan 
account owners must withdraw annu-
ally or else they pay a penalty. The 
amount to be distributed is calculated 
based on the account balance as of De-
cember 31 of the previous year. 
Since the market was nearly at an 
all-time high at the end of 2021, and it 
has dropped more than 20 percent, the 
distributions from 2022 are dispropor-
tionately high. While this administra-
tion pushes more terrible inflationary 
policies that hurt our market, it is our 
retirees who are suffering the con-
sequences most from this downturn. 
I have introduced this bill to waive 
the required minimum distributions for 
2022, much like this body did in 2020 in 
the CARES Act when the government 
shut down our economy. 
My office has received countless 
phone calls, not just from my constitu-
ents, but from American retirees all 
over the country who are demanding 
that Congress address this issue. I hope 
we can get something done by the end 
of the year.

BRING OUR HOSTAGES HOME 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as 
we begin to take our work recess and 
engage with constituents, families, 
young people—in Texas sports are sort 
of the heart of our State, we love our 
Friday night football—I want us to 
think of a young woman who did every-
thing right. 
Brittney Griner, her father was a 
Vietnam vet, grew up in Houston, 
Texas, went to high school in my dis-
trict, was quiet but an outstanding 
athlete. Athletes are holistic persons 
with many talents. She even did better 
than that, graduating from Baylor Uni-
versity 
and 
becoming 
a 
two-time 
Olympian. 
I guess the Russians realized how im-
portant a person she is. She is now in 
a cage in Russia, as many of our hos-
tages are in Iran and Russia. Putin, I 
believe, thinks that this is his own spe-
cial pawn, a 6-foot-9-inch young woman 
in a cage. 
I ask my colleagues as they go home 
to their families to remember to tweet 
out to bring Brittney Griner home and 
direct it to Putin to stop the cruelty. 
Bring 
Brittney 
Griner 
and 
Paul 
Whelan and all of our hostages home.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
BARSTOW, 
CALI-
FORNIA 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 75th anni-
versary of the city of Barstow, Cali-
fornia. 
Barstow got its genesis in 1947 as a 
key stop on Route 66 and has since 
grown to form an iconic part of Califor-
nia’s diverse landscape. It is the home 
of the BNSF rail yard, one of the most 
important logistics hubs in our rail 
system. 
It is also the home of the Marine 
Corps Logistics Base at Barstow, as 
well as the transit point for every piece 
of equipment and soldier who trains at 
the Army’s National Training Center 
in Fort Irwin, where almost all of our 
soldiers who were deployed to Afghani-
stan have gotten their training. 
As Route 66 approaches its 100th 
birthday, I have no doubt that Barstow 
will continue to be a key component of 
the Mojave Desert’s diverse infrastruc-
ture and economy. 
I join Barstow Mayor Paul Courtney 
in wishing the city a very happy birth-
day and many years of prosperity in 
the future.

REPUBLICANS WILL RESTORE 
FISCAL SANITY 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-
ican people have one thing on their 
minds, and that is inflation. So let’s 
talk about it. 
Inflation is caused by a rapid in-
crease in the money supply, the kind of 
increase that only follows a drastic rise 
in government spending. Since Inau-
guration Day, Biden and the Demo-
crats have passed nearly $4 trillion in 
new spending. 
For reference, that is almost all the 
money we brought in last year, and we 
had record revenues. It is all out the 
door before we even fund the govern-
ment. But that is not all. Through his 
executive orders, Biden has singlehand-
edly spent another $1.5 trillion. 
This reckless spending has set off an 
economic crisis the likes of which we 
have never seen. The average American 
family will spend an extra $8,000 this 
year just to keep pace with rising 
prices. For most Georgians, that is al-
most 2 months’ pay. 
The current majority has dug us 
deeper and deeper into debt. It is time 
to stop digging. 
Republicans will put an end to this 
recklessness and restore fiscal sanity 
to the people’s House. 
f 
WAKE UP, AMERICA 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, from 
time to time we talk about the crisis 
at the border, but we still don’t talk 
about it enough. A lot of times I get 
people saying, well, maybe these are 
all wonderful people, maybe they will 
get a job. It is still a big problem be-
cause you are having people skip in 
line ahead of people who are doing 
things right. 
But something came out in the last 
few weeks that ought to have people 
really mad—it maybe should even wake 
up the Biden administration, who has 
done so much, I think, to permanently 
damage this country—and that is news 
that Venezuela may be sending people 
here out of their prisons. 
Can you imagine any quicker way to 
ruin America than to accept people 
from other countries who are emptying 
out their prisons? 
But that is apparently what is going 
on. 
And nothing is done. We still have 
over 150,000 people a month crossing 
the border, even now, knowing that 
probably we are getting people who are 
committing crimes, heinous crimes in 
Venezuela, and sending them here, and 
the communist government of Ven-
ezuela, I am sure, is laughing all the 
way. 
Please, America, and, please, our co-
matose press corps, wake up and edu-
cate America that we may be ruined 
because we have criminals coming here 
from Venezuela and allowed to cross 
the border.

The Marne Rockstar program recog-
nizes private citizens for their dedica-
tion to serving Fort Stewart and Hun-
ter Army Airfield, which are both in 
Georgia’s First Congressional District. 
Recipients of the award must show 
that they have given back to the bases 
through outstanding public service. 
Joe Higgins has done just that. 
As a result of him winning this pres-
tigious award, Joe’s photo, along with 
a description of his service, will be per-
manently displayed at division head-
quarters. Throughout the years, Joe 
has given back to the military bases in 
many ways. He has given turkeys to 
junior soldiers at Thanksgiving, ar-
ranged meals for over 700 families for 
Family Day, and has secured donations 
from local distributors. 
Joe has gone above and beyond with 
every opportunity he has gotten. He 
could not be more deserving of this 
award. 
On behalf of myself and the First 
Congressional District of Georgia, I say 
thank you, Joe, for giving to our serv-
icemen and -women.

ECONOMICS 101 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I’m 
going to do my best not to sound frus-
trated and defeated. I actually do be-
lieve there is hope. But somewhere 
here—and I’m going to show the num-
bers—we have got to figure out some 
way, particularly my brothers and sis-
ters on the left but even some on my 
side, to understand what is going on in 
the math. The math will always win. 
Tonight, I am going to throw a lot of 
math, a lot of the facts. These facts 
functionally decide whether this coun-
try survives or not. These facts decide 
whether we are going to have pros-
perity or not. And the avoidance of the 
math around here, the avoidance of the 
actual math. The level of cruelty, the 
level of just viciousness that will make 
to the poor, the working middle class, 
to anyone in this country, because the 
actual economic data that has flowed 
through to today is pretty damn ugly. 
Let’s start to deal with some reality 
on the math. And this board is already 
out of date. 
In the next 30 years, CBO—and this is 
from a couple months ago—says, in to-
day’s dollars, 30 years from now, we 
will have $138 trillion—and the reason I 
had to do this is because the number 
keeps changing, and this is already out 
of 
date—$138 
trillion 
of 
borrowed 
money. 
And this is one of the hard things, be-
cause we are terrified to tell our voters 
this, but it is the math. It is the truth. 
Every dime of this borrowed money, 
from today’s $31 trillion of borrowed to 
$138 trillion borrowed, is the shortfall 
on Medicare. It is the shortfall on So-
cial Security. It is the demographics. 
And what is terrifying is this Medi-
care number, when healthcare right 
now has doubled the inflation rate, 
doubled the inflation rate of the rest of 
the country. I represent the highest in-
flation 
in 
the 
continental 
United 
States; the Scottsdale-Phoenix area. 
We are sitting around 13 percent. And 
in my marketplace, we are being told 
20-plus percent is my medical inflation. 
This number explodes. 
How many times this last week have 
you had anyone come behind these 
microphones and say: I am terrified 
what I just did to people trying to head 
toward retirement. I am terrified what 
we have done to the next generation. 
This is reality. This is the math. And 
this doesn’t really have all the spend-
ing. 
President Biden, unified control of 
the left, has been here, what, 18-some 
months. Congratulations, he added $4.8 
trillion to the deficit. 
Remember the campaign rhetoric? 
Oh, they’re going to be responsible, 
they are going to balance things—$4.8 
trillion to the deficit. 
Here is where the math gets terri-
fying, and I am just livid that no one is 
willing to walk behind these micro-
phones and tell the voters the truth be-
cause we need to hand out cash, so they 
vote for us; so they cuddle with us and 
say, Oh, we like you. Thank you, Mr. 
Congressman, for funding this, funding 
that. 
This is going to make sense in a mo-
ment. 
The end of 2021, we functionally had 
zero percent interest when you did the 
adjustment for—here is our inflation 
and here is UST bills, when you do the 
WAM, the weighted average daily. 
September 22. We are at 3.1. We are 
now calculating. And this is real inter-
est. So, yes, bonds and T-bills are up 
here, but when you adjust for inflation, 
we believe the futures are going to con-
tinue to go up. 
For the next few years, as far as we 
can see on the current futures market, 
interest rates are 2, 3, 4 points higher 
than the Congressional Budget Office’s 
modeling. 
What does that actually mean? 
Let’s just do the easiest one. If we 
are 2 points higher than what the CBO 
had projected just a few months ago, in 
just a decade you are well over 126 per-
cent 
of 
debt-to-GDP. 
But 
it 
gets 
crazier. 
Remember, what I am saying here is 
with inflation, with expectations, and 
the speech I did last week where we 
showed you data after data after data 
points. 
First, the lie from earlier this year: 
Inflation is transitory. It was never 
transitory. Anyone that said that 
didn’t show up at their economics 
class. 
Look at the structural inputs we saw 
last week. Inflation now is structural, 
meaning the Federal Reserve is going 
to either have to bust the labor mar-
kets because this place is incapable of 
doing what is necessary, which is 
incentivizing 
savings, 
and 
incentivizing, in a big-time way, pro-
ductivity. 
Because if you don’t make more 
stuff—and I know it is supply side and 
supply side is a rightwing, except it is 
economics. It works. If we don’t get 
more productive as a society—it is an 
economic term—what is it—oh, yeah, 
we are screwed. 
So do understand, under the current 
CBO protections, and this is from 
months and months ago before they 
plugged in the inflation data we are in 
right now, in 30 years, 50 percent of all 
tax receipts, we are just paying inter-
est. 
Now, most of this is not Republican 
or Democrat, it is demographics. We 
got old as a society, but this is our fu-
ture. Now you put in the crappy fiscal 
decisions and economic decisions this 
place has made over the last 18 months, 
and you start to see what the future 
actually looks like. 
This is from the CBO numbers. This 
is CBO data from a year ago, that if we 
had just a single percentage point high-
er mean on U.S. sovereign debt interest 
rates, in 30 years, 70 percent of all tax 
receipts are consumed by just paying 
back the interest. Not paying down the 
principal, 70 percent just paying inter-
est. 
So what happens if where we are at 
right now becomes long term? Because 
we are right now 2 points plus on that 
CBO model. If it were to last 30 years— 
and I don’t believe it will—but if it 
did—you have got to understand this is 
from CBO last year—if we ran 2 percent 
higher on U.S. sovereign—so T bills, 
the 10 years, the 30 years, you know, 2 
percent higher, 100 percent of the tax 
receipts of this country go just to pay 
our interest. 
Doesn’t this scare the crap out of 
anyone? Does anyone here own a calcu-
lator with a battery in it? 
Mr. Speaker, I have a 12-week little 
boy that just came to us. And, yes, my 
wife and I, we are going to be old par-
ents, but he is 12 weeks. If this is our 
future where because we have borrowed 
so much money, because we have set 
off inflation, because we have blown up 
productivity—and I showed last week 
that productivity per work hour is ac-
tually crashing. It is falling. The incen-
tives to participate in the labor mar-
kets are not working. 
So we say, Well, we have this great 
unemployment number, except if you 
look at the U6 data and those things, 
why are there so many millions of 
young males missing from the work-
force? The incentives we should be en-
gaging in to get older Americans to 
stay in the workforce, what can we do 
to incentivize that, because if we don’t, 
this is our future. One hundred percent 
of all tax receipts being consumed just 
paying back the interest; not paying 
down the debt, not paying for govern-
ment. It is just the United States have

basically become functionally an insur-
ance company with an army. 
At the rate we are going, we are not 
going to be able to pay our insurance 
benefits: Social Security, Medicare, 
VA, Indian Health Service. It just 
drives me to the edge just in anger; the 
trite, the crazy. 
We are going to talk about anything 
that we think will motivate our voters 
or get them to get excited or maybe 
give us money, or this and that, but to 
tell them the truth on how much trou-
ble we are in. 
I accept that maybe I am a heretic. 
Maybe the job of a Member of Congress 
is not to come behind this microphone 
and tell the public the truth. I accept 
these are big numbers; we are talking 
trillions. 
Think of this: The shortfall in Social 
Security over the next 65 years—and I 
know it is a long time, but that is ac-
tually how you do the Social Security. 
I am the ranking Republican on Social 
Security. The shortfall in just Social 
Security over the next 65 years is $202 
trillion. 
In, functionally, a decade it is out of 
money; and at that point, you take a 25 
percent cut. We will double the number 
of our brothers and sisters who are sen-
iors who will be in poverty. 
How much discussion do you see 
around here that anyone here cares 
about people? But we do brilliant vir-
tue signaling. We virtue signal the hell 
out of this place, and then when it 
comes to anything requiring a calcu-
lator—and all of your phones have a 
calculator on it—we do, what? 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to show this 
because hopefully this will make sense. 
I am going to try to tie in that there 
are 
solutions. 
There 
are 
actually 
things we could be doing. 
With the amount of money the left 
has spent in the last 18 months, if that 
money had been actually directed to 
things that actually would have made 
a difference, hell, they might be head-
ing toward the majority again—they 
are not—but we also would save the 
country, and there would be optimism. 
Instead, we do pandering. We spend our 
money on basically buying the next 
generation of votes. 
So, look, this is actually really a so-
cietal problem, and we need to have an 
honest discussion about it. And this is 
terrifying, because Members are terri-
fied to come behind these microphones 
and say anything where the Twitter 
army is going to attack you. 
But the 2021 estimate, 37.3 million 
people, up from 26 million, will have di-
abetes. I’m going to show you a slide in 
a moment that we may have doubled in 
certain areas the number of our broth-
ers and sisters who are obese during 
the COVID shutdowns. 
Why is this board important? Our es-
timates from a couple years ago was 
that diabetes is 33 percent of all 
healthcare spending. It is 31 percent of 
all Medicare spending; diabetes and the 
associated. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent the popu-
lation with the second highest diabetes 
in the United States. It is a Tribal 
community on the side of Scottsdale. 
You want to meet the misery? Come 
visit. I will introduce you to families 
who actually are doing okay finan-
cially, and grandma’s feet have been 
cut off. So the solution in this place is: 
Well, we will build more diabetic clin-
ics. We will find ways to help people 
maintain their misery. 
I know I am going to get crap for 
this: Body mass index approximately 
doubled during the shutdowns. 
We have been trying to dive into why 
the excess mortality numbers from this 
last year, and we are trying to do it in-
tellectually honest, intellectually ro-
bust, saying: Here is our COVID deaths. 
Here is our fentanyl deaths. 
Mr. Speaker, come to Phoenix, Ari-
zona, and see the number of people now 
living in alleys. Talk to my local police 
about the number of bodies they are 
picking up every week who are dying 
on fentanyl because fentanyl has be-
come so incredibly cheap. We are now 
the distribution center because the 
border is wide open. 
But, hey, these are loving, caring 
Democrats who don’t give a damn 
about the border. 
b 1400 
But understand the misery. 
But this just hit us saying: Oh, God, 
what happens in society if we just dou-
bled obesity in the country? 
We know what this means, and we 
also know that diabetes in the previous 
model was 33 percent of all healthcare 
spending. We know this health index: 
lots of folks gaining weight during the 
time that we were locked in because 
that was the brilliance of this govern-
ment. 
How many people have we made sick-
er and more miserable? 
Maybe that is the reason those young 
people aren’t in the workforce. Maybe 
that is the reason productivity isn’t 
working. It is a unified theory: health, 
immigration, and technology; all these 
things come together to make this 
country healthy. 
The reality is we are in trouble. We 
are in just real trouble. The debt is ex-
ploded, now the interest on that debt is 
exploded, and the elements where we 
say: Well, we are going to cut—look, 
the Democrat mantra is: Well, rich 
people don’t pay enough taxes. 
I have shown boards after boards 
after boards. You can take every dime 
they have, and you functionally don’t 
cover but a fraction of the crushing 
debt that is coming. 
Republicans have their sin. We will 
say: It is waste and fraud. 
Well, it turns out that waste and 
fraud and foreign aid are just a frac-
tion. They need to be fixed. They are 
all things that probably should be 
fixed. They are part of the formula. 
Think of the cash the left spent on 
some of their legislation on giving cash 
to the Big Pharma that make insulin 
instead of doing something that would 
have been much more brilliant. Not too 
many miles from D.C., here in Virginia, 
there is a co-op that is actually about 
to make I think it is about eight types 
of generic insulin, and they are going 
to make it less than the subsidized 
price. 
Why wouldn’t you pass legislation 
saying: We are going to bring that on-
line, and we are going to do the things 
to incentivize this type of working to-
gether. 
By the way, this is how you bring en-
tries into the market because the addi-
tional competition is what lowers 
price. But, instead, the brain trust 
around here says: We hate Big Pharma. 
Hey, here is a bunch of cash. Here is 
billions of dollars. 
That was the Democrat solution. It 
was fascinating how many groups actu-
ally wanted the cash much more than 
they wanted the competition because 
this place is always about the money. 
This is something I have been trying 
to pitch here. Maybe it won’t work. 
Maybe it is just too utopian for this 
place to get their heads around. But I 
think we now have a half a dozen 
Americans who have been cured of type 
1 diabetes. I did a whole functionally 40 
minutes here on the floor a couple of 
months ago walking through the proc-
ess of the stem cell being tagged with 
CRISPR so the body doesn’t see it as 
foreign; so you can do it in a bio-
foundry, so you can make lots of this; 
and then putting it into the body, the 
islet cells actually start to attach, and 
it produces insulin. 
Mr. Speaker, why wouldn’t you put a 
fortune into bringing this and seeing if 
it works? 
The 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed, 
the 
Democrats can call it anything they 
want, because this is moral. This is ac-
tually loving and kind. 
Mr. Speaker, if you look at the pre-
vious slides, then you understand we 
have a debt avalanche, and now the in-
terest on that debt avalanche is about 
to crush us. 
We need our brothers and sisters to 
be healthy and able to participate in 
the economy. There are some fas-
cinating things we have been working 
on showing that, hey, income inequal-
ity, why is this population poor over 
here? 
We would always get from our broth-
ers and sisters on the left: Well, it is 
racism. It is education. 
It turns out it is a hell of a lot more 
complicated. It turns out if we actually 
start to dig into the data, we actually 
start to see health—health—and the 
fact that crime and people break your 
bones and steal your stuff—but health 
was an incredibly large component of 
why some of these urban populations— 
my Tribal populations—weren’t par-
ticipating in the economy. It was dia-
betes, the commonality of diabetes in 
these populations. 
So why wouldn’t this be everything? 
We are going to take on the farm bill 
and make it so we can help our broth-
ers and sisters in type 2 get healthy. 
Yes, it will take time, it will be con-
troversial, and it will be difficult. But

September 30, 2022 
if this is the modern plague, when you 
saw the numbers of the growth of dia-
betes, why wouldn’t we throw every-
thing we have at it? 
Because from a math standpoint, it is 
singularly the most important thing 
you and I could do for U.S. sovereign 
debt. Think of that, Mr. Speaker. It is 
crazy, but if 31 percent of all Medicare 
spending is diabetes—and that number 
is about to grow substantially because 
of what we have done the last couple 
years—and Medicare is 75 percent of all 
the 
future 
debt, 
ta-da, 
the 
math 
doesn’t take a brain surgeon. 
So let’s actually start to walk 
through more of the things that are ac-
tuality optimistic and hopeful, and 
maybe when Republicans are the ma-
jority here, we will actually have the 
competence to try to do hard and com-
plicated things to actually make peo-
ple’s lives better. 
I just pulled this up as just a thought 
experiment except for the fact that the 
product actually exists today. It is 
functionally a home biopsy. You can 
get this and have it on your shelf at 
home. It actually will be functioning a 
laboratory where you can put some sa-
liva on it, some other body fluids, and 
it calculates, it talks to the phone; it 
talks to the algorithm; it gives you a 
diagnosis; and it would be in your 
home. It would help crash parts of the 
healthcare. 
Now, this technology is substantially 
illegal if you allow the algorithm to 
write a script in this country. We also 
know that healthcare costs are the 
things that are about to crush us. You 
would think that this place would be 
contemplating: What can we do in the 
technology disruption? 
But, instead, the brain trust here 
somehow 
thinks: 
Well, 
the 
ACA, 
ObamaCare. 
No. Mr. Speaker, you have got to un-
derstand that was a financing bill. The 
Republican alternative was one, and 
Medicare for All, they are financing 
bills: Who gets to pay and who gets 
subsidized. In Medicare for All every-
body is subsidized. Those are financing 
bills. They have nothing to do with 
what—with what—we pay. 
This is one of the ways you disrupt 
the cost of healthcare. 
But I believe this place is terrified 
because you just took, what, hospitals 
are the largest lobbyists here in Wash-
ington, D.C. They should love and em-
brace these types of technology disrup-
tion. We are just afraid to have that 
conversation with them. 
The other thing is actually one of my 
pieces of legislation. It is just a simple 
idea. 
What is inflation? 
Let’s first go back to our high school 
economics class. Inflation is too many 
dollars chasing too few goods and serv-
ices. Okay. We can make more stuff. 
Part of my argument is reform the 
Tax Code and reform the regulatory 
codes—things we did in the 2017 tax re-
form with expensing where we had that 
productivity 
spike—because 
invest-
ments and things that make the soci-
ety more productive means you can 
pay people more. 
The other side is also too many dol-
lars. 
How do I get my brothers and sisters 
to say: Don’t take that cash that is sit-
ting in your checking account and go 
buy another big screen television? 
What if this place would give an in-
centive and say: Take the cash and go 
put it in your retirement account? 
Believe it or not, it accomplishes 
much of the same thing. We have got-
ten some nice write-ups on the piece of 
legislation Congressman DONALDS from 
Florida and I are doing that says: Let’s 
provide an incentive for people to take 
excess cash and instead of spending it 
in the marketplace continuing the in-
flationary cycle, put it in retirement 
security. 
But, instead, Congress seems abso-
lutely content on letting the Federal 
Reserve blow up the economy. You al-
ready see what is happening around the 
world. When the United States has in-
flation and we start to raise our inter-
est rates and money comes screaming 
in from the world and the U.S. dollar 
spikes up and the other currencies in 
the world collapse, and yet they need 
to buy fuel and food in U.S. dollars, 
then understand the decisions Demo-
crats here made 2 years ago—a little 
less than 2 years ago—to push out al-
most $2 trillion in excess spending that 
set the match on the inflation kin-
dling, you just blew up much of the 
world. 
This time next year there will be 
countries around the world that can’t 
make their debt payments. 
Mr. Speaker, do you think we will 
hear anyone on the left actually come 
behind the microphone and say: We 
screwed up, we didn’t show up at our 
economics class, and we just blew up 
the world? 
Because they did it in my commu-
nity. I have 13 percent inflation in the 
Phoenix-Scottsdale area. 
Mr. Speaker, if you work and you 
haven’t had a pay raise, then you have 
lost a month and a half of your wages— 
a month and a half of your wages. 
That is the biggest modern tax hike. 
I tried to explain this last week: Who 
are the winners and losers in inflation? 
Society and people who save money, 
that young couple who is trying to save 
to get their family going, and that re-
tired couple. They are crushed. 
Who is the biggest debtor in the 
world? 
This place. We have $31 trillion of 
borrowed money. 
And guess what, Mr. Speaker? 
We now get to pay back that $31 tril-
lion—or at least the interest on it— 
with deflated dollars, with cheaper dol-
lars because we lowered your econom-
ics, and we made it cheaper for us to 
do. 
That is one of the reasons why there 
is this sort of whisper here in Wash-
ington, particularly the Treasury-type 
folks, who say that inflation is hor-
rible. But at least in the short term, 
Democrats are almost giddy that, hey, 
by the end of the year, the debt-to-GDP 
ratio in real dollars will actually close. 
It is not because they did anything to 
grow the economy. It is because the 
dollar value has crashed because of in-
flation. The value of the debt, because 
you are paying it back with deflated 
dollars, that debt to GDP in real dollar 
terms will close. 
Now, the punch line is a year or so 
from now when we have had to sell the 
new bonds at the higher interest rates 
and the higher interest rates and the 
higher interest rates, then it moves 
against us. That is like those slides I 
told you where we had long-term inter-
est rates, 2 percent over CBO model, it 
is 100 percent. One hundred percent of 
all tax receipts go to pay just interest. 
This is where we are heading. 
Shouldn’t this be the number one 
conversation in this place, the survival 
of the country and the survival of my 
new little boy? 
But it doesn’t give a damn because it 
is math and our voters—let’s face it— 
our voters want the shiny object be-
cause it is our fault because we are ter-
rified to have a conversation with our 
voters saying: If we don’t do these 
things, then we can’t save Medicare 
and we can’t save Social Security. 
That becomes the attack ad. We do it 
to each other. I believe Democrats are 
much more duplicitous in it. But math 
is scary, and it doesn’t need to be. 
There is hope. 
Mr. Speaker, I just bring this one up 
because this was in a recent article 
talking about some of the productivity 
effects, the GDP growth effects when 
we got the parts of the Tax Code right. 
We didn’t get everything we should 
have. 
But, Mr. Speaker, I need you, if you 
want a real living example, to look at 
the fourth quarter of 2017. Because re-
member, the fourth quarter of 2017 got 
the benefit of expensing even though 
the tax reform didn’t finish until the 
end of 2017. But we did that retrospec-
tive. 
Then look at 2018. Look at 2019. The 
shrinkage of income inequality. The 
poor got much less poor. The working 
middle class had a couple of their most 
prosperous years in modern history. 
African-American 
females 
had 
this 
amazing growth in wages and job op-
portunities. 
But it is a demonstration. I know it 
is heresy for the left to compliment tax 
reform. It wasn’t tax cuts, it was tax 
reform, because the actual receipts, the 
revenues that came in, the number of 
times our friends on that side said: You 
are going to put us into depression. 
I am waiting for my apology because 
we actually took in more money. Cor-
porate receipts went up. Thank God we 
had actually that robust of an economy 
and that robust of a tax system when 
the pandemic hit. 
Could you imagine if we didn’t, Mr. 
Speaker, how miserable we would have 
been?

The last thing, this is not meant to 
be a non sequitur. It is meant to be a 
closing on the discussion of the misery. 
I am a border State. I know most of 
the Democrat votes aren’t anywhere 
near the border States, so you don’t 
give a damn about us, but I am dead se-
rious. 
I am blessed. I have just an amaz-
ingly wonderful congressional district. 
It is where I grew up. It is my home. It 
is my obligation to try to defend them. 
Even neighborhoods that don’t vote 
for me, come drive with me, and come 
see the misery that is living in the 
alleys behind these houses. 
Fentanyl has crashed in price in the 
Phoenix area. I have a Phoenix police 
sergeant who is my neighbor. He was 
telling me, a year or 2 ago, $120 to get 
high for the day. Today, it is like $12. 
Now, we are finding a new form of syn-
thetic opioid crossing our border. It is 
10 times more potent than fentanyl. 
Maybe you don’t give a damn about 
people in the Southwest or the misery 
of the little 14-year-old girl who just 
died down the way from me, taking one 
pill. But when this stuff gets left on a 
countertop somewhere at your favorite 
wine bar, and everyone in the room is 
dead, will the left take seriously the 
misery that their open border policies 
have brought to us? 
Look, my pitch is really simple. The 
economics are all screwed up. The 
Democrats set off inflation. That piled 
on the debt, piled on our demographics, 
piled on our healthcare. We are in real 
trouble as a nation. 
If we would embrace the disruptions 
of technology and the incentives for 
productivity, we can at least bend the 
curve. We are not going to pay down 
the debt, but we can bend it so that 
debt-to-GDP is survivable, but you 
have to get other policies right. 
This place is having no conversations 
that are actually serious, honest, and 
important, and I don’t know how this 
became Republican versus Democrat. 
We are now just talking about the sur-
vival of our Republic. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS KEEP-
ING MONEY FROM 9/11 VICTIMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) 
is recognized for the remainder of the 
hour as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 28 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. GOHMERT. We had a bill we 
took up the last vote of the day before 
we are out for October, and it was 
strange because this bill got rushed to 
the floor. I can’t find anybody on our 
side of the aisle who had any idea this 
was coming until yesterday afternoon. 
It is interesting, though. It is titled 
Fairness for 9/11 Families Act, and it 
makes $2.982, right at $3 billion, avail-
able for 9/11 families. 
There has been a lot of money pro-
vided in the past, but it is interesting 
because just last week, I was talking 
about this article from September 12 
by Daniel Greenfield about what the 
Biden administration was doing in bat-
tling against 9/11 victims’ families in 
court. 
There was $7 billion of Afghanistan 
assets, bank funds, liquid money funds 
in the bank in America that were fro-
zen after 9/11 when we found out who 
was responsible. 
The 9/11 victims’ families sued, and 
they had gotten a judgment against 
the Taliban, al-Qaida, and Iran for $6 
billion. 
As this article points out, White 
House Democrats have a history of 
fighting against terror victims who are 
suing Islamic terrorists. 
The Obama administration battled 
American terror victims suing the 
PLO. In 2015, after they won a $218 mil-
lion judgment against the terror group, 
Blinken, then only a Deputy Secretary 
of State, intervened, claiming that the 
lawsuit threatened ‘‘several decades of 
U.S. foreign policy.’’ In other words, he 
took up for the terrorists against the 
victims’ families. 
The article points out that now the 
Biden administration is fighting 9/11 
victims on behalf of the Taliban. At 
stake are billions of dollars being held 
by the Afghan central bank fund in the 
United States. 
Further down, it points out that 
since Afghanistan has assets in this 
country, the United States, including 
$7 billion in bank funds, it is now en-
tirely possible for the victims to col-
lect that money. 
Biden officially announced that he 
was splitting the $7 billion between the 
families of the victims and a trust fund 
to provide ‘‘humanitarian aid’’ for the 
people of Afghanistan. 
For those who don’t understand 
international relationships, when the 
Biden administration says it is for hu-
manitarian aid, what it means is they 
have to give that money to the Taliban 
and trust the people who have lied and 
killed Americans and killed 13 Ameri-
cans on the very day that the Biden ad-
ministration had that ridiculous, hasty 
retreat. You are going to trust them? 
Are you kidding me? It is just so out-
rageous. 
The article points out that $3.5 bil-
lion was placed in a separate trust that 
would be separate and distinct from 
around $800 million the Biden adminis-
tration has already spent on aid to Af-
ghanistan. 
It wasn’t enough that this adminis-
tration left $85 billion worth of mili-
tary equipment that they could use to 
attack us later, but they have been 
sending millions of dollars over there, 
like that is going to really go to help 
the people. 
The article points out that what 
Biden actually did was take money off 
the table for the 9/11 victims, and it got 
worse. On the same day as Biden’s ex-
ecutive order reserving $3.5 billion for 
the terrorists, his Justice Department 
filed a statement of interest in court 
arguing that the judgment for the vic-
tims of terrorism here in the United 
States was too large and that actually 
turning over the money to those vic-
tims in America would interfere with 
the Biden administration’s foreign pol-
icy in Afghanistan, like we have a for-
eign policy in Afghanistan. Who be-
lieves that? 
This administration tucked tail and 
ran, and ran so fast, it exposed our 
military, our people, our allies to 
death. Policy in Afghanistan, for heav-
en’s sake. 
The article points out that now a 
magistrate judge has repeated back 
much of the Department of Justice’s 
arguments and ruled for the Biden ad-
ministration that the 9/11 families who 
were laying claim to the other half of 
the $7 billion, that $3.5 billion, were 
not entitled to it. 
If it weren’t for the Biden adminis-
tration going to court and fighting 
against the 9/11 victims’ families, there 
would have been $3.5 billion, and this is 
not just some speculation. That is 
money in the bank. This is liquidity. 
This is money that is there. 
The Biden administration has been 
fighting them in court to keep them 
from getting that $3.5 billion with a b 
that the Biden administration wants to 
give to the Taliban for ‘‘humanitarian 
aid.’’ 
Now, the Taliban is more likely to 
torture and kill, as they have done, 
anybody who was our ally than provide 
true humanitarian aid. To them, hu-
manitarian aid is treating women like 
property, preventing them from having 
an education, which was improving, 
and killing those with whom they dis-
agree. It is just tragic. 
If there is any doubt about who 
would get the money, the deputy gov-
ernor of the bank that this will go 
through is a Taliban leader who we 
have listed specifically as a global ter-
rorist. That is who the Biden adminis-
tration wants to help. 
It shouldn’t have been a surprise. I 
talked about this here on the House 
floor last week, that the Biden admin-
istration was fighting our own 9/11 vic-
tims, trying to keep them from getting 
reimbursement from the terrorists. 
So, what happens? The last thing, 
here we come, running in here. Oh, we 
don’t want the 9/11 families too mad at 
us. Let’s take $3 billion that American 
taxpayers have paid and give that to 
the 9/11 victims instead of the $3.5 bil-
lion that belongs to the Taliban, we are 
told, by this administration. 
Well, I think most Americans, if they 
knew that this had gone on, would say 
this is crazy. Do you actually want to 
give the people responsible for killing 
3,000 Americans $3.5 billion so that you

can take taxpayer money from Ameri-
cans and give that for the damages 
that the terrorists did? 
That makes no sense, but it does ex-
plain why the last bill for the next 
month and a half was $3 billion of tax-
payers’ money that the Biden adminis-
tration wants to use instead of the $3.5 
billion that they say they need to send 
to the terrorists, the Taliban, in Af-
ghanistan. 
It was bad enough that this adminis-
tration deserted our allies in Afghani-
stan and left them to be massacred by 
the evil within the Taliban, but now 
they want to give the terrorists even 
more money? 
I mean, at least you would have 
thought somebody in this administra-
tion would have said: Do you know 
what? We left them $85 billion of mili-
tary equipment. I think they can get $3 
billion out of that. 
That would pay the victims of 9/11. 
But this administration—$85 billion of 
equipment they left with them—has 
added $800 million of American tax-
payer dollars sent over there to the 
Taliban for humanitarian aid. Now, 
they want to give $3 billion more of 
taxpayer money, instead of terrorist 
money, to 9/11 victims? 
I think there were 30 or so Repub-
licans who voted against this. Anybody 
who tries to say they don’t care about 
9/11 victims is a liar because they do, 
and that is why we have appropriated 
billions of dollars for them. 
But in this case today, I can’t help 
but think if everyone on both sides of 
the aisle—well, I know some would 
have known. If they had known there 
was $3.5 billion from the terrorists’ 
own money in our banks that we could 
give to the 9/11 victims, then they 
would say that is probably a better 
idea than taking it from American tax-
payers. That is outrageous. 
b 1430 
Now, shifting to what is going on in 
our Department of Justice. We have 
been seeing these tactics that have 
been coming for some years, and people 
know that there was some corruption 
within J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI. People 
should have gone to prison within the 
DOJ for what they did to Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., to the point not only 
did they harass him, spy on him ille-
gally, but even send him messages that 
he needed to kill himself. 
We know it has been bad in the past, 
but most of us felt like there have been 
great strides forward to the point that 
in the 1980s and 1990s, if you asked peo-
ple around the world, they would say 
the FBI is probably the greatest law 
enforcement entity in the world. 
That is not the case anymore. Some 
of the first people that will tell you 
that are people working for the FBI, 
but they have to be very careful. I have 
heard from FBI agents, former FBI 
agents, people that have been around 
awhile, one of them said, you remem-
ber the way it used to be? The FBI was 
a class organization. 
We knew if there was a defendant 
who was nonviolent that—and I re-
member this happening before I went 
on the bench as a judge, and then dur-
ing my years on the bench as a district 
judge. I knew of cases, where the FBI 
knew they were nonviolent, white-col-
lar crimes, and even though they were 
very, very serious felonies, they would 
call the guy’s lawyer, and say, you 
need to show up at the jail at this 
time, you have been indicted or you 
will be indicted. They knew they would 
show up because otherwise they might 
come knock down the door. That was 
not what they did. That was not their 
practice. They believed in civility and 
humanity. 
I have been thinking about the in-
timidation tactics that have been used 
by the FBI, and it was for no other rea-
son but intimidation. I think Merrick 
Garland, through some of the things he 
and Christopher Wray have said, they 
made it clear, they are out to intimi-
date conservatives, and they have done 
a good job. 
Many are afraid to speak up about 
the improprieties that are going on 
within the FBI and the DOJ, even to 
the point that the head of the Depart-
ment of Justice, the Attorney General 
himself, who was nominated for the Su-
preme Court—thank you, God, that he 
is not there—but he is in a place he can 
do a lot of damage to people’s rights, 
and he has. He issued an order that 
DOJ and FBI, they were not to speak 
to a Member of Congress or the Senate 
without going through the FBI. 
I have heard from people that have 
complained about what is going on in 
DOJ and FBI. They have talked about 
how Christopher Wray has talked re-
peatedly using this line, protect the 
brand. Protect the brand. 
From the things that he would say, 
they tell me, he made it clear, we are 
not asking you to be honest and truth-
ful. We are asking you, when you find 
something that is criminal or a wrong-
doing within the FBI, don’t tell any-
body, just pass it up the chain of com-
mand. Let’s keep it inhouse because if 
people find out about corruption inside 
the FBI or the DOJ, then it hurts our 
brand. 
Christopher Wray and Merrick Gar-
land apparently don’t understand the 
damage that they have done to the 
brand of the FBI and the DOJ. 
The Attorney General knows the 
Constitution and knows this body’s 
right of oversight and knows that ev-
erybody inside and outside the Depart-
ment of Justice has a constitutional 
right to talk to their Member of Con-
gress without going through Merrick 
Garland’s screeners. Yet, he orders 
that they don’t have the constitutional 
rights they have got because he thinks 
his orders take precedence over the 
U.S. Constitution. 
Why wouldn’t he think that? They 
have been giving orders that take prec-
edence over the Constitution. 
I have been thinking, there is so 
much in the way of intimidation tac-
tics being utilized by the FBI and the 
DOJ, that is exactly what the tactics 
were of a group that people understood 
they were all about intimidation. We 
hear comparisons, people say, oh, Don-
ald Trump is like Hitler. 
Really? 
He wants more participation. He 
wants to have more rights back in the 
States. He wants to spread out the 
power of the government. 
And that the left thinks is like Hit-
ler? 
No, that is not. 
When you have a so-called Justice 
Department that is using the exact 
same tactics as the gestapo—you need 
to understand your Republic, a demo-
cratic Republic as it is often referred 
to, because we elect Representatives 
and then have Representatives rep-
resent us. They are servants of the peo-
ple. So it is a Republic, democratically 
elected, it is in jeopardy. And ours is in 
jeopardy when the DOJ gets this pow-
erful. 
Now, there were some that were ex-
tremely upset about what happened on 
9/11, like all Americans were, but they 
were concerned about what they saw as 
infringements 
on 
liberty 
within 
a 
month after 9/11. They have been talk-
ing about those for years now. 
It has really come into focus in re-
cent days as the FBI has knocked down 
doors, leaked information to media so 
that they are there to film people when 
they drag them out in their underwear. 
In some cases, not even giving them a 
chance to put on clothes. 
Contrast that to the same treatment 
they would have gotten back in the 
1980s or 1990s of telling them they need 
to report to the jail on a certain day 
and a certain time. I don’t use the term 
‘‘gestapo’’ lightly. 
And why is our Justice Department 
feeling like they got to be like the ge-
stapo? 
I greatly admired the FBI when I saw 
the way they worked in the 1980s and 
1990s. They were so professional. 
Then along came Mueller in 2001 as 
the new director of the FBI. He started 
a policy that allowed the FBI to run off 
thousands and thousands and thou-
sands of years of experience because he 
wanted nothing but young, yes-people 
working at the FBI. 
So over the years, those people that 
would have said, excuse me, I know you 
think that is a good idea, but let me 
tell you what happened when we tried 
that before, or let me tell you where 
that is going and why it is not a good 
idea. They didn’t want those people 
there. 
If they wanted to go after a can-
didate like Donald Trump, they wanted 
people around them that would say, 
okay, here is how we can do it. We can 
do this secretly and we can do this and 
that. If it violates the Constitution, we 
don’t care. We need an insurance policy 
to keep Trump from getting elected. If 
he gets elected, we need to violate 
more rights and we need to have people 
working for the Justice Department 
that will lie in an affidavit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8364 
September 30, 2022 
I am telling you, that is why when I 
saw the lack of response, or appro-
priate response from the FISA court, 
when they found out that the FBI and 
the DOJ lied to them, and then kept 
filing for a warrant every 90 days, bas-
ing it back on a lie, those FISA judges 
should have been outraged. The Chief 
Justice across the street on our Su-
preme Court should have been out-
raged. They weren’t. They really didn’t 
do anything. 
The State district judges I know and 
the former Federal district judges I 
practiced in front of trying cases, I 
couldn’t imagine them not calling a 
lawyer in and finding them in con-
tempt because it was done in their 
presence and sending them to jail for 6 
months before any criminal prosecu-
tion even took place, and then demand-
ing that there be a criminal prosecu-
tion. That didn’t happen. 
So it tells you something about the 
FISA courts. We learned, I believe it 
was 2007, that the National Security 
Letters that give the FBI the ability to 
just send a letter like a warrant say-
ing, produce all the records you have 
on this individual, that individual. 
And, by the way, it is a Federal felony 
if you tell anybody that you got this 
letter. 
The IG did an inspection and ulti-
mately said, oh, there are probably 
3,000 or so National Security Letters 
that were sent out by the FBI when 
there was no case, there was no prob-
able cause, they were just doing fishing 
expeditions. That is unconstitutional. 
We would have hoped that that got 
cleaned up, but we had an FBI director 
named Mueller that kept adding to the 
problems. 
Instead of punishing the FBI agent 
that fabricated a case against Ted Ste-
vens, a Republican Senator, the one 
that brought forward the fraud by the 
FBI, he gets run out of the FBI. The 
one that was involved in the fraud got 
a promotion and got a better job. So 
that tells you even back not long after 
Mueller took over at the FBI, he was 
involved in intimidation. 
Really, I felt that ever since—we 
know that William Jefferson was a 
criminal, committed a crime, and was 
punished as he should have been. But 
when the FBI under Mueller made it 
clear—this is intimidation to Con-
gress—you better not mess with me or 
counter me or have legitimate over-
sight over what I am doing, or I may 
just come search your office. Well, they 
did. It had never been done before that. 
It was all about Members of Congress 
concerned about what was happening 
at the FBI, the abuses of our Constitu-
tion. So he shoves it right back in our 
face. It is intimidation. These are ge-
stapo-type tactics. 
There was an article that was written 
in the ‘‘Eurasia Review’’ back on Sep-
tember 1 of this year, and it expressed 
the concern I have. It is titled ‘‘The 
FBI’s Gestapo Tactics: Hallmarks of an 
Authoritarian Regime.’’ 
It talks about, ‘‘With every passing 
day, the United States Government 
borrows yet another leaf from Nazi 
Germany’s playbook: Secret police. Se-
cret courts.’’ 
We have FISA, and I am fine if we get 
rid of them. We had national secrets 
that were kept before FISA. But the 
abuses and the lack of concern about 
the abuses by the judges tell me we 
need to get rid of them. 
It says, ‘‘Secret government agen-
cies. Surveillance. Censorship. Intimi-
dation. 
Harassment. 
Torture. 
Bru-
tality. Widespread corruption.’’ 
Look, if that power is there and the 
Republicans take over and put staunch 
conservatives in there, you know, we 
still would need very, very stringent 
oversight, so that nobody did that to 
the Democrats because when it hap-
pens to one side it should concern ev-
erybody. 
I got really upset when I found out 
about the abuses of the National Secu-
rity Letters, and that was under the 
Bush administration. I was calling it 
out. I was angry about it. And I am not 
hearing 
any 
Democrats 
concerned 
about the abuses of the Constitution 
that have gone on. The intimidation, 
borrowing pages directly from the ge-
stapo. 
b 1445 
This is how you intimidate people. 
This is very serious, and I don’t have 
time to go into all of this. It is a good 
article from the Eurasia Review, but it 
goes and documents what the Gestapo 
did and what the FBI is doing, and it is 
scary. 
I hope that if Democrats are not will-
ing to address this issue now then, 
surely, they will be when we have a Re-
publican administration because the 
abuse needs to stop. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE GREAT 
THINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for giving me the 
opportunity to be able to speak this 
afternoon from the heart. 
Democrats have done great things. 
We have certainly appreciated the 
Members of the other side of the aisle 
who have joined us on some of those. 
Those things include passing a very ef-
fective CHIPS bill that I hope to bring 
thousands of jobs to my congressional 
district through the production and 
manufacturing, using precious metals, 
in particular, coming from the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo. 
We now have families who suffer 
from diabetes who, shockingly, for the 
first time in their lives, can have insu-
lin capped at $35. I am glad to have 
been a part of that. 
I seek, as I did before, that Medicaid 
recipients can also have their insulin 
capped. 
I am glad that working families, in 
this storm of inflation, can, through 
the Biden administration and Congress, 
have subsidies for healthcare and get 
cheaper healthcare. 
I am glad that the flooding that is so 
intensive in places like Houston, can, 
in fact, now have the bipartisan infra-
structure bill; and isolated commu-
nities without transportation or tran-
sit can, in fact, now have the potential 
of billions of dollars coming to those 
rural and urban centers, inner-city cen-
ters that need an infrastructure re-
build. 
We need clean water, and Flint and 
Jackson, Mississippi, should not be the 
norm in the United States of America; 
and lead in pipes that helped destroy 
the cognitive genius of our children 
should not exist. 
We have done great things. And as we 
go to work in our districts, listen to 
our constituents even more than we do 
when we have a moment over the week-
ends that we go home, we go home to 
hold in our hands the destiny of democ-
racy when we fight for re-election for 
the purpose of ensuring the value of 
this Nation, as I look, In God We Trust. 
We have done great things. Families 
of America should know that this lead-
ership, under NANCY PELOSI, and STENY 
HOYER, and JIM
CLYBURN, and the 
chair, Mr. JEFFRIES, and the vice chair 
of the Democratic Caucus, we should 
all know that there have been good 
things that were done. 
So, when I go home, I have no hesi-
tancy to be able to go and to champion 
the lives we have saved; the veterans 
who will get answers to their questions 
and their health conditions; the people 
who suffered under the burn pit, now 
relief, they celebrated because of this 
Congress, this Democratic Congress, 
with our friends who wanted to do what 
is right. 
We have given hope to those burn pit 
victims. They can’t breathe, and we 
have finally given relief. 
This body has determined that the 
electoral count should be accurate, 
with no false electors showing up, giv-
ing false representation that they rep-
resent the States. No Vice President 
can do anything but ministerial. 
There will be no doubt that if you 
vote in a Presidential election fairly 
and electors are selected to cast their 
vote for you—something, of course, 
that I think is a figment of our past 
and should not be in place, but let’s 
make it perfect—you can now trust 
that the electors will do right, as they 
did in 2020; and they provided the final 
vote under the Vice Presidency of Mr. 
PENCE
that elected Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
We pray to God that we will never 
see January 6 again; never again; never 
the violence and brutality, the blood-
shed of our police officers, the deaths 
that occurred, the innocent lives lost. 
We hope never again. 
We have done some good things. 
There is such a litany of them, I can-
not list them all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8365 
September 30, 2022 
I am delighted to have passed the 
Stop Human Trafficking in School 
Zones, the legislation that I authored; 
that we have fixed the Terry fix, to en-
sure justice for those who were not 
able to come appropriately under the 
reduction of sentencing dealing with 
crack and cocaine. 
I am glad to have been able to push 
the Victims of Crime Act to ensure bet-
ter handling of victims of crime. 
At the same time, I believe that it is 
important to assure that the American 
people know that we are, in fact, work-
ing hard for them. So the many amend-
ments to help HBCUs that I have of-
fered; the many important elements of 
the appropriations, including more dol-
lars for post-traumatic stress under the 
NDAA and some aspects of the appro-
priations, as I do every year; the help-
ing of those suffering from triple nega-
tive breast cancer; and working to en-
sure that the lives of our children are 
better by helping to create resources 
for safer schools; work still unfinished 
to get our storage laws in place; to ban 
assault weapons. 
But we have done a great thing in 
passing legislation to break the cycle 
of violence led by Mr. HORSFORD; and 
to utilize the tools that have been 
given through this Congress, under the 
Democratic leadership, to make lives 
better for all Americans. 
We have done some good things. As 
we have done some good things, there 
is more work to be done. I want to 
make sure that we see the passage of 
the voting rights, so that oppression of 
voting can cease and desist. 
It is appalling that we go into this 
election, but we fought, as Democrats, 
to make it happen. I am so sorry the 
noes came from the other side of the 
aisle. 
I thank my colleagues, 217-plus, who 
have, in fact, supported the idea of a 
commission to study slavery and to 
look seriously and thoroughly at the 
question of reparation proposals. I 
know that we will work together going 
forward. It is the heart of America to 
cure both racism and to heal and to 
bring people together. I have con-
fidence. I feel well about our opportu-
nities. 
I thank the Speaker that is in the 
chair, to have joined me in the midst of 
the crisis of reproductive freedom 
being taken away, to support medical 
personnel who, right now, under the 
laws of the Dobbs case in America, are 
being arrested, could be, nurses, nurse 
practitioners, doctors, who are simply 
trying to help a desperate woman that 
has been raped, or a child that has been 
raped. I hope to pass that Protecting 
the Medical Personnel of America bill. 
I hope to pass the legislation that I 
introduced to stop the stalkers who 
would get a bounty on women by 
watching what they do, calling up and 
saying, I think she is getting an abor-
tion. She is over at this address; and 
receiving $10,000. 
Can you believe it? The law of the 
land in the State of Texas. 
We have done some good things and 
we are doing good things. But if this 
Special Order is about one issue or 
item, this is what I want it to be about. 
I want it to be about something that 
our psyche is just not used to. 
I don’t know how many times we 
have thought of the tens upon tens of 
Americans 
that 
are 
held 
hostage 
around the world. We learned a little 
bit about MIAs, people missing in ac-
tion, soldiers missing in action, really, 
through the Vietnam War. I know they 
were missing in action in World War II 
and other wars, but in this recent gen-
eration, we learned about it because 
the late heroic John McCain would al-
ways remind us of the MIAs. 
I joined with my colleague, Ben 
Reyes, and put a flag out in front of the 
City Hall in Houston, Texas, when I 
was a member of the City Council; the 
first MIA flag, I believe, maybe, in city 
councils across America. 
I came here to the United States 
Congress, and outside my door is the 
flag of MIAs. We understand that. 
But do we understand about Ameri-
cans who have done little, have been 
plucked off the streets of places that 
are despotic, and joined the thousands 
of their own citizens thrown in jail 
with no real justice system? 
So if I come to you today, I want the 
title of this Special Order to focus us 
on where we need to go. 
THE PLIGHT OF BRITTNEY GRINER 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
when I mention Brittney Griner, I want 
everybody to know I am thinking of 
Paul Whelan, and I am thinking of the 
journalist in Iran, and hostages around 
the world, U.S. citizens. 
Does anybody know that we work 
hard on this? When I say we, the ad-
ministration works hard on this every 
day. On the floor today, I asked for 
more resources for the hostage finding 
team—I will just call them that. 
But I want to take a moment to just 
show you Brittney Griner’s life. She is 
a Houstonian; went to the schools, the 
public schools in the area; went to 
Nimitz High School in my congres-
sional district. I met some of her class-
mates. Even the students there today 
want to do something to show their 
care and outrage about where she is 
today. 
Brittney Griner, no, she was not in 
the United States military. I honor 
them. But she wore the uniform. She 
was an Olympian; brought a gold medal 
home to the United States, I believe, 
two Olympics, back to back. That is 
USA Number 42 and Number 15, num-
bers worn in the Olympics. 
b 1500 
That is Brittney Griner sharing some 
good news, a good dunk maybe, with 
her teammates, and Brittney Griner, 
an Olympian, wearing that good-look-
ing Gold Medal. We like that because 
everybody watches the Olympics. 
What 
an 
unbelievable 
basketball 
player—that is a shot; I could only 
dream 
about 
that 
shot—Brittney 
Griner, an American, African-Amer-
ican young woman. 
I know the Baylorites love the cham-
pionships and the hard playing that she 
did for them at Baylor University. 
That is Brittney Griner. She had a life 
in front of her. 
Because of the very poor compensa-
tion, of sorts, compared to the NBA, 
many women WNBA players go off to 
foreign countries to play. She got 
drafted by Phoenix and played stupen-
dously, so many world records in bas-
ketball as a professional. 
Big heart, Brittney Griner, her team-
mates loved her. 
I visited the Phoenix arena where her 
team 
plays. 
Of 
course, 
Brittney 
Griner’s locker was there waiting for 
her to come back. 
This looks like an exciting time, 
some good-looking pictures of our fel-
low American. 
Paul Whelan, a marine, had some 
good days serving his country. 
It is just an innocent civilian, who 
the infractions of what she is charged 
with wind up suggesting and threat-
ening and charging her as a drug traf-
ficker, a big-time drug trafficker—no 
sense but nonsense. 
She could have been released and di-
rected back to the United States. But 
no, this is what Mr. Putin wanted to 
do. He felt, after the Olympics of 2022, 
the Winter Olympics, where his teams 
were embarrassed because of drugs, 
that he would show the United States. 
Here she is. They put her in a cage, 6 
feet 9 inches in a cage. The beauty of 
her size was to recognize such a tal-
ented person playing the sport, doing 
well, giving joy to the fans and getting 
Americans to cheer her on during the 
Olympics. 
This is what they wanted to show 
Americans: We got you now. In your 
eye. 
A young woman longs to be home, de-
serves to be home, with other hostages 
who have been brutally treated. 
President Biden has indicated, as 
Commander in Chief, that he wants all 
the hostages home, and he is ready to 
speak to Mr. Putin if he would only 
have a heart, if he would only recog-
nize that there is no justice in his in-
justice. 
Ninety-nine percent of those who go 
to trial in Russia are convicted. They 
are, in fact, held hostage. This is a di-
rect result of Putin’s interest in saying 
to the United States, I guess: We got 
you. 
Not respecting she has family, not re-
specting that she has done nothing 
wrong. 
Brittney is an extension of us in 
Houston. She represents the quin-
tessential American stories and quali-
ties. 
She 
is 
suffering 
after 
going 
through a trial, the process of appeal, 
doing 
everything, 
offering 
doctors’ 
statements as to why certain items 
were with her, indicating a mistake, 
doing everything told by her lawyers. 
Nothing. Denial of basic rights to 
Brittney Griner, because they are the

rights to which we believe all people 
are entitled, a trial by jury of your 
peers and the right to be able to be 
proven innocent. 
We do not accept the dehumanization 
that is commonplace in Russia, and our 
values compel us to seek justice for 
Brittney’s immediate release and re-
turn to her family and friends. 
She spoke eloquently by saying: I am 
sorry. It was a mistake. 
It seems to have fallen on deaf ears. 
Can it be nothing more than an at-
tempt to humiliate her, her family, her 
loved ones, who cry out for the poten-
tial of what may happen? 
She cried out to the President of the 
United States: I fear that I may be here 
for the rest of my life. 
She is a young woman who gives 
away shoes and items to children with-
out. 
Her basic rights—we as Americans 
cannot just go quietly. We have a lot 
on our plate, but the only lifeline they 
have is the United States of America. 
As a mother who has watched my 
children grow up, proud to see them 
excel, I can only imagine the gut- 
wrenching pain of her mother and fa-
ther and her wife, and how hopeless 
they feel. There is no worse feeling 
than when someone in your family is in 
imminent danger and beyond your 
reach to help. 
As a Black woman, I can say there is 
no greater fear through the history of 
our time, through slavery, through dis-
crimination, through unequal treat-
ment that we face in a justice system, 
even here, to think that there is noth-
ing we can grab at to be able to give 
the defense, the explanation. 
I want Americans to think of the 
pain of losing their children to some-
thing that is so foreign to us. They are 
alive, but they are held hostage. 
There is much pain in this country. I 
have seen it through gun violence, so I 
don’t speak to the pain of those moth-
ers and fathers. What I speak to is that 
we need to do something about it. 
I have gone to the Russian consulate 
in Houston. I have gone to the Russian 
Embassy. I have looked the Ambas-
sador in the eye, at a huge, gigantic 
complex, and I said: Send this message 
to Mr. Putin. Let Brittney go. Let Paul 
Whelan go. Let the people of Russia, 
the good people who are out fighting 
against this vile and vicious war 
against Ukraine, let them go, too. 
But I can’t leave silently to go back 
to Houston without coming to this 
floor and saying, since February, about 
2 weeks after the Olympics, she has 
been held. 
She is not a soldier. She had nothing 
to do with any government activities. 
The only reason I say that is because 
her training does not lend her to these 
dastardly conditions, a cage, inhumane 
cage, ultimately to go to a labor camp 
where Trevor Reed suffered and Paul 
Whelan suffered. 
She has been denied access to con-
sular officials, and she was dependent 
upon Russian lawyers who mean well 
but simply go into the court and watch 
their client be convicted. 
As they faked elections just the last 
couple of days, Brittney Griner is suf-
fering from Putin’s demonstration of 
power and control that stems from cen-
turies of bigotry and hatred embodied 
in an autocratic leader who is the very 
antithesis of everything Ms. Griner 
represents. 
If you want to know why she is incar-
cerated and not released, it is based 
upon her country of origin, something 
she cannot help. 
Americans who are blessed to be born 
under this flag cannot help the values 
upon which we stand. We cannot help 
our Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of 
the United States of America. We can-
not help our national anthem that 
calls for victory, ‘‘The Star-Spangled 
Banner.’’ 
We cannot help that we are called by 
nations to defend them. We cannot help 
that we have the freedom to travel and 
that we welcome people to this coun-
try, Russian students, Russian players, 
even on the space station. That is 
America. 
But now we find the dastardly acts of 
stealing land, calling it an election, 
fighting people who want to be free, 
Ukrainians. In the midst of this tur-
moil is a young woman who graduated 
in my district from Nimitz High 
School, a Baylor University graduate, 
a two-time Olympian, and, of course, 
with all her friends in Phoenix, and 
just a basic human being. 
I hope I made it clear. There are two 
teams in Phoenix. She is with the 
Phoenix Mercury, the WNBA team. 
I couldn’t leave this day without re-
minding America that if in God we 
trust, give some hope to these people, 
lonely, all over the world, shocked that 
they were snatched off the streets or 
snatched from an airport, gave every 
explanation. They created no out-
rageous, vile, terroristic act. They did 
nothing 
with 
guns, 
drugs 
of 
any 
amount. They were no detriment to 
anybody in that land, and here they 
are. 
My colleagues, Congressmen STAN-
TON
and ALLRED, supported H. Res. 
1132, led by Congressman STANTON out 
of Phoenix, calling for the immediate 
release of Brittney Griner. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article from Sports Illustrated: 
‘‘Brittney Griner’s Wife Has Troubling 
Update On How She’s Doing.’’ 
[From the Spun, by Sports Illustrated, Sept. 
17, 2022] 
BRITTNEY GRINER’S WIFE HAS TROUBLING 
UPDATE ON HOW SHE’S DOING 
(By Andrew McCarty) 
Earlier this week, President Joe Biden met 
with Cherelle Griner, the wife of imprisoned 
WNBA star Brittney Griner. 
Griner has been in a Russian prison since 
February, when she was arrested for having 
cannabis oil in her bag at a Russian airport. 
Ever since then, the United States has been 
trying to get her home. 
A meeting between Biden and Cherelle is a 
big step towards that, but it also came with 
some troubling news. According to Cherelle, 
Brittney’s letters to her have taken an in-
creasingly dark tone. 
Cherelle offered a larger statement fol-
lowing her meeting with Biden. 
‘‘I’ve felt every minute of the grueling 
seven months without her,’’ she said. ‘‘I look 
forward to the day my wife is back home. As 
my family and I continue on this journey, I’d 
like to thank the broad coalition of friends, 
leaders and supporters who continue to stand 
with us and advocate for Brittney’s swift and 
safe return. Let’s share a unified commit-
ment to bringing all Americans home to 
their families and loved ones. Together We 
Are BG.’’ 
Hopefully the United States and Russia 
can work together to bring Griner home in 
the near future. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD
two articles 
from CNN, one titled ‘‘Biden set to 
meet with families of Brittney Griner 
and Paul Whelan at the White House’’ 
and an article written most recently 
about 
Brittney 
Griner’s 
conditions 
that she is facing and what she thinks 
is going to happen to her life. 
[From CNN, Sept. 16, 2022] 
BIDEN
SET
TO
MEET
WITH
FAMILIES
OF 
BRITTNEY GRINER AND PAUL WHELAN AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet 
with the families of Brittney Griner and 
Paul Whelan at the White House on Friday, 
marking his first time personally meeting 
with them since their loved ones were de-
tained in Russia. 
White House press secretary Karine Jean- 
Pierre said Thursday that Biden will meet 
with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, and 
Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth Whelan, to assure 
them his administration is committed to se-
curing the release of their loved ones and 
that they remain ‘‘front of mind.’’ Biden will 
meet with them separately, an official said. 
‘‘One of the things that the President 
wanted to make clear is, and one of the rea-
sons he’s meeting with the families, is that 
he wanted to let them know that they re-
main front of mind and that his team is 
working on this every day, on making sure 
that Brittney and Paul return home safely,’’ 
Jean-Pierre said. 
The Biden administration has repeatedly 
said that working to secure Griner and 
Whelan’s release, as well as that of Ameri-
cans wrongfully detained abroad, is a top pri-
ority. In late July, US Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken announced that the US had 
put forward a ‘‘substantial proposal’’ to try 
to secure the release of Griner and Whelan. 
Sources told CNN that proposal included a 
swap for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. 
Griner was detained in February for car-
rying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil 
in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic 
basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to 
drug charges and said she accidentally 
packed the drugs while in a hurry. She has 
been sentenced to nine years, along with a 
fine of about $16,400. Her legal team in Rus-
sia has appealed the sentence. 
Whelan has been imprisoned in Russia for 
more than three years after being convicted 
on espionage charges that he vehemently de-
nies. He was sentenced in June 2020 to 16 
years in prison in a trial US officials de-
nounced as unfair. 
A senior administration official told CNN 
Thursday that there has been ‘‘movement 
but not breakthrough’’ on the efforts to se-
cure the releases of Griner and Whelan. The 
official said that the US has urged Russia to 
put forward ‘‘a serious counteroffer’’ to the 
proposal on the table to secure the release of 
the two, but ‘‘we’ve not gotten a serious re-
sponse back.’’

H8367 
September 30, 2022 
State Department spokesperson Ned Price 
said Thursday that ‘‘there have been discus-
sions with the Russian government,’’ but ac-
knowledged the negotiations process ‘‘cer-
tainly hasn’t moved with the speed we would 
like.’’ He said he wouldn’t call the process 
‘‘stalled.’’ 
The White House meetings come after CNN 
first reported earlier this week that former 
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and his 
team were in Moscow and held meetings with 
Russian leadership. 
The details around those meetings were 
not immediately clear. Richardson and his 
namesake center privately work on behalf of 
families of hostages and detainees. 
Biden administration officials have repeat-
edly expressed concerns that private citi-
zens’ attempts to broker deals to repatriate 
wrongfully detained Americans may end up 
hindering ongoing efforts by the US govern-
ment to bring them home. 
Since taking office, Biden has met with the 
families of other Americans who have been 
detained abroad. 
The President in May met with the family 
of Austin Tice, an American journalist de-
tained at a checkpoint near Damascus in Au-

WHAT WE KNOW (AND DONT KNOW) ABOUT THE 
ARREST
OF
US 
OLYMPIC
CHAMPION 
BRITTNEY GRINER IN RUSSIA 
(By Holly Yan) 
A month after US basketball star Brittney 
Griner was arrested in Russia, it’s still not 
clear exactly where she’s being held. 
But a Moscow court has ordered the 31- 
year-old to stay in custody until at least 
May 19, the Russian state news agency TASS 
reported March 17. 
‘‘The court granted the request of the in-
vestigation and extended the period of deten-
tion of the US citizen Griner until May 19,’’ 
the court said, according to TASS. 
Griner is a championship-winning player 
with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury who has 
spent her past several offseasons playing for 
the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg. 
But last month, Russian authorities ac-
cused 
Griner 
of 
smuggling 
significant 
amounts of a narcotic substance after flying 
from New York to a Moscow airport. 
Now, the mystery surrounding her detain-
ment in a country she’s worked in for years 
has come to symbolize the growing tensions 
between the US and Russia during Russia’s 
continued invasion of Ukraine. 
Why was Griner detained? 
The Russian Federal Customs Service said 
an American’ was detained at Moscow’s 
Sheremetyevo Airport after being found with 
hash oil. 
‘‘As a US citizen was passing through the 
green channel at Sheremetyevo Airport upon 
arriving from New York, a working dog from 
the Sheremetyevo customs canine depart-
ment detected the possible presence of nar-
cotic substances in the accompanying lug-
gage,’’ a statement from the customs service 
said. 
‘‘The customs inspection of the hand lug-
gage being carried by the US citizen con-
firmed the presence of vapes with specifi-
cally smelling liquid, and an expert deter-
mined that the liquid was cannabis oil (hash 
oil), which is a narcotic substance.’’ 
The Russian statement did not identify 
Griner by name, but said the detainee is an 
American professional basketball player and 
two-time US Olympian. 
The customs agency said the US citizen 
was placed in pretrial detention. It said a 
criminal case was underway for smuggling 
significant amounts of narcotic substances— 
an offense carries a potential punishment of 
five to 10 years in prison. 
Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, has publicly 
called for the release of her wife. USA Bas-
ketball, the Women’s National Basketball 
Association, the Phoenix Mercury and the 
WNBA players’ union have all publicly 
shared their concerns for Griner. 
When was Griner arrested? 
The Russian customs agency said in a 
statement a US citizen was detained ‘‘in 
February of 2022,’’ after flying to Moscow 
from New York, but did not say what day. 
US Rep. Colin Allred, whose office has been 
in touch with the US State Department, said 
Griner was arrested in Russia on February 
17. 
A State Department spokesperson said the 
department is ‘‘aware of and closely engaged 
on this case.’’ 
Where is Griner now? 
As of March 17, Griner’s exact whereabouts 
were not clear. 
Ekaterina Kalugina, a representative of 
Moscow’s Public Monitoring Commission— 
which observes the treatment of prisoners— 
visited Griner at her pre-trial detention cen-
ter, TASS reported. 
A court advocate said Griner should be 
kept under house arrest because their jail 
beds are a foot too short for Griner, who is 6 
feet 9 inches tall, according to the Russian 
news service RIA Novosti. 
Can Griner communicate with anyone in the 
US? 
Allred said Griner has been in contact with 
her Russian lawyer, who is in touch with her 
agent and her family in the US. But Griner’s 
consular service has been blocked, which is 
‘‘extremely concerning,’’ Allred said. 
TASS quoted Kalugina as saying the US 
consul had not yet visited Griner, despite 
Russian authorities’ willingness to ‘‘create 
all conditions’’ for their visit. 
CNN has reached out to Russian officials 
and the US Embassy in Moscow for comment 
on Griner’s consular access but has not heard 
back. 
Although a State Department official told 
CNN the US has been denied consular access 
to Griner, a source close to the situation 
told CNN Griner’s Russian legal team has 
seen her several times a week throughout 
her detention, and she is well. 
The source added that the Russian inves-
tigation is ongoing, and a trial date has not 
been set. 
Her high school basketball coach, Debbie 
Jackson, said she worries Griner’s case will 
be used for political purposes. 
‘‘My biggest fear is that . . . she will be-
come a political pawn,’’ Jackson told CNN. 
What was Griner doing in Russia? 
‘‘Griner was in Russia for work: playing for 
UMMC Ekaterinburg, where in 2021 she 
helped the team win its fifth EuroLeague 
Women 
championship,’’ 
wrote 
Tamryn 
Spruill, a journalist who covers women’s bas-
ketball. 
Spruill 
started 
the 
‘‘Secure 
Brittney 
Griner’s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.’’ 
petition on Change.org. 
‘‘Like many athletes competing in the 
WNBA, Griner plays abroad during the 
WNBA offseason because her salary is expo-
nentially higher in other countries,’’ Spruill 
wrote on the petition’s page. 
‘‘For WNBA players, that means playing 
abroad, while NBA rookies who haven’t 
played a professional game yet are handed 
salaries many-times higher than what title- 
winning, All-Star designated WNBA veterans 
could ever hope for,’’ Spruill said. 
‘‘These realities are not the fault of the 
players. They simply want to be paid their 
worth like their male counterparts, and they 
do not deserve to be entangled in geo-
political turmoil for doing so.’’ 
Are there any other WNBA players in Rus-
sia? 
In early March, the WNBA confirmed to 
CNN that no other players were in Russia 
nor Ukraine. 
What are the odds of getting Griner out of 
Russia? 
A member of the US House Armed Services 
Committee said ‘‘it’s going to be very dif-
ficult’’ to get Griner out of Russia. 
‘‘Our diplomatic relationships with Russia 
are nonexistent at the moment,’’ Democratic 
Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN 
on March 7. 
‘‘Perhaps during the various negotiations 
that may take place, she might be able to be 
one of the solutions. I don’t know.’’ 
He also noted ‘‘Russia has some very, very 
strict LGBT rules and laws’’—though it’s not 
clear whether those rules and laws might im-
pact Griner’s case. 
Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legisla-
tion and outlawed the ‘‘propaganda of non-
traditional sexual relations around minors.’’ 
But the Biden administration is working 
on trying to get Griner out of Russia, mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Caucus said 
after meeting with President Joe Biden on 
March 7. 
‘‘The best news we got today was that they 
know about it and that she’s on the agenda,’’ 
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents 
Griner’s hometown of Houston, Texas, told 
reporters. 
Noting a potential 10-year sentence for 
Griner, Jackson Lee added: ‘‘We know about 
Britney Griner, and we know that we have to 
move on her situation.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a press state-
ment from my office. 
[Press Statement from Congresswoman 
Sheila Jackson Lee, Aug. 4, 2022] 
WASHINGTON, DC.—Congresswoman Sheila 
Jackson Lee condemns the Russian Court 
System for their egregious sentencing of 
Brittney Griner. Today Griner was sentenced 
to nine years in prison by a Russian Court. 
This decision comes after the House passage 
of H. Res. 1132 ‘‘Calling for the immediate re-
lease of Brittney Griner, a citizen of the 
United States, who was wrongfully detained 
by the Government of the Russian Federa-
tion in February 2022.’’ 
‘‘If I have to beg for mercy for the release 
of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan myself, 
I am prepared to do so,’’ explained Rep. 
Jackson Lee. Brittney Griner grew up in 
Houston, Texas, was a collegiate All Amer-
ican star basketball player at Baylor Univer-
sity where she won a national championship, 
won two Olympic gold medals as the leader 
of the U.S. national basketball team, and is 
a WNBA superstar playing for the Phoenix 
Mercury based in Arizona. Prior to being 
held captive by the Russian government for 
several 
months 
before 
having 
charges 
brought against her Griner played in the 
Russian leagues in the United States’ WNBA 
off season. 
On May 3, 2022, the United States Govern-
ment declared Brittney Griner unlawfully 
detained and immediately moved her case to 
the Department of State under hostage nego-
tiation. The U.S. Department of state is a 
leading Government agency which serves an

integral role in foreign policy and the ad-
vancement of the American people. ‘‘We 
thought there might be a glimmer of hope, 
but we were obviously wrong,’’ Congress-
woman Jackson Lee explained. 
While on trial Alexander Boikov, a mem-
ber of Griner’s legal team, requested Griner’s 
acquittal stating that the prosecution failed 
to prove criminal intent. Charges brought 
against Griner are drug smuggling and can-
nabis possession, which the prosecution has 
categorized as a significant amount. Griner 
was in possession of less than one ounce of 
cannabis oil, which demonstrates how cor-
rupt Russia’s court system is. By padding 
smuggling charges, Russian courts were able 
to lengthen Griner’s sentence when evidence 
only substantiated drug possession charges. 
While playing for the Phoenix Mercury in 
Arizona, Griner legally obtained and fre-
quently used cannabis to treat chronic pain 
from an injury. Griner took her career in the 
Russian basketball league seriously and de-
cided to travel to Russia, even amidst the 
political unrest, so she would not let her 
teammates or Russian fanbase down. 
The Biden administration has offered the 
trade of Russian illegal arms dealer Viktor 
Bout for the trade of both Griner and 
Whelan. Congresswoman Jackson Lee urges 
Russia to act on this deal and reassures the 
American people ‘‘We are not violating our 
integrity as Viktor Bout has served majority 
of his sentence.’’ Bout, nicknamed ‘‘the mer-
chant of death,’’ was convicted on November 
2, 2011, and sentenced, to twenty-five years 
in prison on charges of conspiracy to kill 
U.S. citizens and officials, and conspiring to 
provide aid to a terrorist organization. In-
versely, Griner is currently imprisoned on 
charges for 0.702 ounces of cannabis oil and 
serving a nine-year sentence. ‘‘The American 
people must come together, and ensure our 
citizens are brought home,’’ explained Rep. 
Jackson Lee. 
b 1515 
And so, Mr. Speaker, let me express 
my appreciation to my colleagues. I 
hope they see the pain that her family 
is feeling. None of us can stand in their 
shoes. 
Because none of us can stand in their 
shoes, we have to plead to Vladimir 
Putin. Let our important and crucial 
leaders listen to this plea. Listen to 
our anguish. Listen and see this pic-
ture versus the ones that I have shown, 
this picture. Just look at them. From 
Olympian to a cage. The Olympian to a 
cage. 
I am going to do everything I can. 
I have asked the Embassy, and I want 
to know what kind of shame they are 
experiencing, not giving Americans 
visas for us to go to our embassy in 
Moscow? 
What are they thinking that they can 
live in a world like this, locking people 
up so they can play gotcha and be in-
humane and stick it in the eye of the 
American people? 
Well, I will tell you, as I stand here 
today, let me take this fist, this fist, to 
make the promise that all of our hos-
tages should be free. I hope the State 
Department’s team of hostage nego-
tiators gets the additional funding to 
grow the team. 
But to the families of hostages who 
are in pain, some who don’t know 
whether their loved one is alive, and 
they live with the pain every day that 
they have not been able to honor them 
if they are not. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that I have said 
something to ignite the conscience of 
the American people and to ignite the 
conscience, if you will, of all of my col-
leagues. 
Free Brittney Griner now. 
Free Paul Whelan. 
Free Brittney Griner now. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule by 
which the House has passed H. Res. 1132, 
‘‘Calling for the immediate release of Brittney 
Griner’’. 
A very important component of the rule cur-
rently before the House is that it: ‘‘Provides 
that House Resolution 1132 is hereby adopt-
ed.’’ 
I fought hard for passage of H. Res. 1132, 
introduced by Congressman STANTON, myself, 
and Congressman ALLRED, because, by rais-
ing our voices for Brittney Griner, we raise our 
voices for bedrock American values and prior-
ities that are intrinsic to our national character. 
H. Res. 1132 calls for the release of Brittney 
Griner and, in so doing, puts Congress on 
record emphatically defending true American 
values such as our devotion to human rights, 
respect and dignity for each person, the right 
to due process, and justice based on truth. 
Each of these have been offended by Rus-
sia unjustifiably holding Griner, and by the 
Russian distortion of a judicial system that ex-
tends her detention, preventing her release to 
return home, without a factual or legal basis 
for doing so. 
Brittney Griner, who grew up in Houston, 
Texas, is an extension of all of us. She rep-
resents quintessential American stories and 
qualities. The injustices inflicted upon her by 
Putin and his acolytes in Russia could have 
been imposed on any Americans within their 
reach. 
The denial of basic rights from Brittney of-
fends all Americans because they are rights to 
which we believe all people are entitled. We 
do not accept the dehumanization that is com-
monplace in Russia, and our values compel 
us to seek justice for Brittney, her immediate 
release, and her return home to her family and 
friends. 
As a mother who has raised a family, I can 
only imagine the gut-wrenching pain that her 
parents, family, and friends must be feeling 
right now. There is no worse feeling than 
when someone in your family is in imminent 
danger and they are beyond your reach to 
help them. 
As a Black woman, I can say there’s no 
greater fear than having a loved one being 
wrongfully placed in a situation or environment 
over which there is no control. 
For any of us, if we had a loved one placed 
in this situation, we would be doing everything 
in our power to ensure their prompt and safe 
return. 
We would be calling and seeking the help of 
everyone possible—including the media, the 
US State Department, and even allies in Rus-
sia. 
We would press every politician and public 
figure to fight against the corrupt government 
of Russia to ensure that our family member is 
guaranteed their natural born rights to due 
process, a fair trial, and a prompt release from 
detention. 
No American citizen should be detained in a 
foreign country for months, denied access to 
American consular officials, and, dependent 
upon the performance of a Russian lawyer, 
especially in absence of substantial evidence 
of a crime. 
Ms. Griner is suffering from Russia’s hei-
nous demonstration of power and control that 
stems from centuries of bigotry and hatred 
embodied in an autocratic leader who is the 
very antithesis of everything Ms. Griner rep-
resents. 
Ms. Griner’s detention is primarily based on 
the country of her citizenship, in a game of po-
litical leverage. Since she was targeted be-
cause of being an American, every American 
should take this personally. Her detention is 
an offense against our country, and against 
our people. 
Griner was detained on February 17, 2022, 
her initial release date was set to be May 
19th, it was then shifted to June 19th, and 
when that date approached, it was delayed to 
July 2nd. 
That is not justice—it’s oppression. We call 
on Putin and the Russian government to com-
ply with their international treaty obligations. 
By passing the rule and adopting H. Res. 
1132, the House insists, alongside the Griner 
family, that Brittney Griner must be imme-
diately and safely released and returned home 
to the US. 
We are unified in demanding respectful 
treatment and justice for her, in accordance 
with American values. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNIZING 
FEMALE 
LEADERS 
WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS 
HONORING 
AS 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-
dinary female leaders in our country who are 
being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try 
and lead by example through my faith and 
commitment to public service. But many times, 
people don’t look to Washington for their role 
models. Fortunately, it does not take long to 
find others guided by their strong moral com-
pass, faith, and commitment to selfless public 
service. Today, I honor some of these women, 
who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world. For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-
gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Nancy ‘‘Honeytree’’ 
Miller, is a global ambassador for Christian 
Music. Raised in a family of classical musi-
cians, she recorded her first album in 1973. 
Known as the ‘‘First Lady of Jesus Music,’’ 
she was one of the pioneers of Christian con-
temporary music. Over her 49-year career, 
she has recorded 17 albums in 3 different lan-
guages. After her ‘‘Jesus Music’’ era, Nancy 
became an ordained minister and developed a 
specialized ministry to singles, while con-
tinuing to write and record. She ministered in 
prisons for a time alongside Prison Fellowship. 
After marriage and family, she developed an 
international focus, ministering in several 
countries and recording albums in Spanish 
and Urdu. Not only has she been an enduring 
presence to her generation, but she continues 
to inspire young Christian artists in Pakistan 
and Latin America. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Nancy, know full well the impact they have 
had on countless lives. These women are trail-
blazers, and the example they have set will be 
followed by people of my district, and many 
other Americans, for years to come. I thank 
each of them for their passion and commit-
ment. This honor is well-deserved.

NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of National Hispanic Heritage 
Month to celebrate the accomplishments and 
contributions of Latino and Hispanic Ameri-
cans in Central Washington, and around the 
United States. 
Hispanic Heritage Month is about recog-
nizing the history of our Hispanic neighbors, 
and honoring the hardships endured to create 
a better life for future generations. In Central 
Washington, our Hispanic neighbors strength-
en our communities through their strong family 
values, cultural diversity, and incredibly hard 
work ethics. Our region could not prosper 
without the Hispanic farmers, police officers, 
teachers, and soldiers who support our soci-
ety. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring our Hispanic American friends, fami-
lies, and neighbors and in recognizing Na-
tional Hispanic Heritage Month.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
WORK 
OF 
FORMER 
SENIOR 
CONSTITUENT 
SERVICES 
ADVOCATE 
LAURA 
RUDE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate and recognize the work of Laura 
Rude, my former Senior Constituent Services 
Advocate in Rock Island, Illinois. 
Laura has given nine years of dedicated 
service to the communities that make up Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. She over-
sees our Congressional Record program, 
where she writes and edits submissions, and 
has nearly doubled our output per year during 
our final term in Congress. Laura has also 
written over 3,000 congratulations letters to 
constituents on my behalf. During her time in 
our office, Laura successfully closed over 
2,500 cases, encompassing every single type 
of casework and working with every federal 
agency. She is truly a jack of all trades. 
Laura, who received her Master’s Degree in 
Social Work from Illinois State University, is 
truly the ‘‘do-it-all’’ caseworker. She is pro-
foundly kind and understanding when assisting 
constituents, and has handled every type of 
miscellaneous case that others would consider 
out-of-the-box or difficult. One of her most 
memorable 
cases 
was 
assisting 
Laura 
Thomsen, who contacted our office because 
she was approved for Social Security Dis-
ability Insurance in November 2021, and had 
waited past the 120-day wait period to receive 
her benefits. Laura swiftly contacted the Social 
Security Administration on Ms. Thomsen’s be-
half and kept her updated on the case. Finally, 
on July 14, 2022, the Social Security Adminis-
tration released the $71,317.81 in backpay 
that was owed to Ms. Thomsen. This is a 
lifechanging amount of money for anyone, let 
alone someone who was unable to work due 
to a disability. Without a doubt, Laura has 
made a significant difference in the lives of 
countless constituents. 
It is because of kind and dedicated leaders 
such as my former Senior Constituent Serv-
ices Advocate, Laura Rude, that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to, again, formally celebrate the exceptional 
work of Laura Rude.

HONORING ZACH LEKSE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Zach Lekse, an 
Investigations Sergeant with the Martinez Po-
lice Department. I have named Mr. Lekse as 
a Public Safety Hero of the Year for Contra 
Costa County in California’s 5th District as a 
result of his extraordinary selflessness, dedi-
cation, and service to others. 
Mr. Lekse began his career in law enforce-
ment shortly after graduating from the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma in 2001. For nearly ten 
years, he served with the Pleasant Hill Police 
Department as a detective, defense tactics in-
structor, and SWAT team member before join-
ing the Martinez Police Department in 2014. 
There he began as a Police Officer before be-
coming a Narcotics Task Force Officer, Patrol 
Sergeant, and most recently, an Investigations 
Sergeant. 
During a suspicious vehicle stop in early 
2019, Mr. Lekse discovered a small amount of 
methamphetamine and learned from the driver 
that a mid-level dealer was living and oper-
ating near the Martinez Police Department. 
Noting that the dealer was on probation, Mr. 
Lekse coordinated a search that resulted in 
the seizure of 1⁄4 pound of methamphetamine, 
a loaded handgun, and $5,000 in cash. Con-
tinuing with his investigation, Mr. Lekse con-
nected the dealer to the Guzma´n family cartel 
of Mexico and ascertained key information 
about their operation. 
Over the course of several months, Mr. 
Lekse worked with the FBI to lead a massive 
multi-agency effort resulting in multiple drug 
seizures and 12 indictments. In total, numer-
ous firearms, approximately 100 pounds of 
methamphetamine, heroin, illicit mushrooms, 
$23,000 in cash, and $80,000 of assets were 
seized. Through his determination, leadership, 
and investigative prowess, Mr. Lekse success-
fully coordinated a complex investigation into a 
drug 
trafficking 
organization 
that 
largely 
evaded justice for 7 years. 
Madam Speaker, we thank Mr. Lekse for his 
persistence and investigative skill. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
MATTHEW 
BOYON AND NATIONAL ECZEMA 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of my constituent, Matthew 
Boyon, and his family. Matthew is currently a 
student at Londonderry High School and has 
suffered from eczema his whole life. In honor 
of Matthew and the more than thirty-one mil-
lion Americans with eczema, I would also like 
to take this opportunity to recognize October 
as National Eczema Awareness Month. 
Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition 
that causes itchiness, dry skin, rashes, scaly 
patches, blisters and skin infections. There are 
seven forms of eczema, including the most 
common and chronic form, atopic dermatitis, 
and no known cure. Adults and children with 
eczema are at risk for, and frequently also ex-
perience additional comorbid health conditions 
such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, 
and bacterial, viral and fungal skin infections. 
Additionally, adolescents with atopic derma-
titis are more likely to report suicidal ideation 
compared to their nonaffected counterparts 
and sleep disturbances reported in 67 percent 
of children with atopic dermatitis. Parents of 
children with atopic dermatitis are 4 to 8 times 
more likely to average fewer than 6 hours of 
sleep per night. 
The impacts of living with eczema go be-
yond just health concerns. More than 66 per-
cent of children with atopic dermatitis report 
being absent from school more than one day 
per year as a result of their illness and nearly 
forty percent of school-aged children and 
teens diagnosed with atopic dermatitis have 
experienced bullying due to their disease. 
The economic impacts of eczema are also 
staggering. 5.9 million workdays are lost due 
to eczema annually and the annual economic 
burden of eczema, including direct medical 
costs, indirect costs from lost productivity, and 
quality of life impacts, is estimated at $5.3 bil-
lion. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank the Boyon family for bringing awareness 
to this condition and hope my fellow Ameri-
cans will join me in recognizing National Ec-
zema Awareness Month.

HOMETOWN HERO—ASHLEY CAIN- 
GRIBBLE 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor our Texas 24 Hometown Hero 
of the week, Ashley Cain-Gribble, a Carrollton 
native who represented the United States at 
this year’s Olympics. 
Ashley lived out her lifelong dream last 
month as she took to the ice in the Olympics. 
Along with her partner, Timothy Leduc—who 
also calls the DFW area home—they finished 
in the top 8, the first time an American pair 
has done so since 1998. 
Ashley’s heroics on the world stage have in-
spired us all back home. But her years of 
training and hard work should serve as a re-
minder to every American that success is im-
possible without sacrifice. 
Fulfilling her dream did not happen over-
night. Since the age of 2, Ashley has been on 
the ice with one goal in mind: to compete on 
the world’s biggest stage. In the years leading 
up to the Olympics, Ashley and Timothy 
trained with her father in Euless, TX—putting 
in blood, sweat, and tears to accomplish her 
goal. 
Ashley returns to TX–24 a hero. Americans 
like her are an inspiration not only to the 
young girls who look up to her, but to the en-
tire country. 
I thank Ashley for her hard work and dedi-
cation. May they inspire the rest of the country 
to fulfill their dreams.

RECOGNIZING THE 65TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF MCCAIN FOODS 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of McCain Foods’ 65th 
anniversary. 
McCain Foods is the largest producer of fro-
zen french fries and appetizers in the world, 
now with over 65 years of experience working 
with potato, sweet potato, and onion growers 
from family farms across the United States— 
including in Central Washington. Every year, 
they partner with over 3,500 producers to har-
vest and locally source 6.8 million tons of po-
tatoes. 
With processing plants across the United 
States, including in my district in Othello, 
Washington, McCain is a strong industry part-
ner that plays a critical role as a customer of 
Washington grown potatoes, and a provider of 
safe, nutritious food for consumers across the 
globe. 
Please join me in recognizing McCain 
Foods as they celebrate 65 years of dedicated 
service supporting American farmers and fill-
ing Americans’ plates.

Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-

being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try

gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Lynn Fitch, is the 40th 
and current Attorney General for the state of 
Mississippi. At the age of 23, she began her 
legal career as a Special Assistant Attorney 
General at the Mississippi Attorney General’s 
Office. She continued her career accumulating 
more than 35 years of legal experience both 
in private practice and public service as State 
Treasurer, Vice President for the National As-
sociation of Treasurers, and Chair of the State 
Financial Officers Foundation. She served on 
the Executive Committee of the National Asso-
ciation of Attorneys General and is currently 
serving as Co-Chair of the National Associa-
tion of Attorneys General Human Trafficking 
Conunittee. She was named in TIME’s list of 
the 100 most influential people in the world in 
2022 and has also been active in her commu-
nity, serving as a board member of several 
charitable organizations. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Attorney General Fitch, know full well the 
impact they have had on countless lives. 
These women are trailblazers, and the exam-
ple they have set will be followed by people of 
my district, and many other Americans, for 
years to come. I thank each of them for their 
passion and commitment. This honor is well- 
deserved.

COMMEMORATING THE 5TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF BORICUACTIVATED 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, when most people imagine 
the American democracy at work, they picture 
this House—or the other chamber—and the 
work we do as lawmakers. 
Or they picture themselves or their neigh-
bors in the voting booth, casting ballots to de-
termine the make-up of government at the 
local, state, and federal levels. 
To me, however, American democracy also 
takes another form: the ongoing dialogue be-
tween citizens and public servants, like us, 
whom they elect to represent them. It is in 
these conversations that we truly learn our 
constituents’ hopes and dreams for the future; 
it is where we learn to make their priorities 
into our priorities; it is where we truly live up 
to our founders’ ideals that the people should 
be allowed—and encouraged—to petition their 
government. 
That is true civic engagement. And that 
premise is at the heart of BoricuActivatEd, a 
stellar volunteer-run organization that is now 
proudly celebrating its fifth anniversary. They 
are leading the way in fostering that active, 
ongoing dialogue. 
The group was created in the wake of Hurri-
canes Maria and Irma, which struck Puerto 
Rico with tragic ferocity. The group found im-
mediate success in marshalling the combined

voice of the Puerto Rican Diaspora, proving its 
impact and displaying the power of civic en-
gagement. They grew from there. 
Through its civic engagement workshops, 
BoricuActivatEd has now supplied more than 
2,000 people with the tools needed to make 
their voices heard. It has taught them how to 
advocate for their priorities and to garner the 
attention of their elected officials. I can per-
sonally attest, having participated in their 
workshops, just how effective and valuable 
these sessions can be. 
To their credit, just as it was born during a 
moment of tragedy, BoricuActivatEd continued 
to grow its programs during another chal-
lenging period—the COVID–19 pandemic. Re-
markably, during the past two years, it has de-
veloped a curriculum enabling the next gen-
eration of citizens to become engaged in their 
government. BoricuActivatEd has brought its 
lessons to students at the high school level, 
including Esperanza Academy in my district. 
By training people of all ages, and by secur-
ing the active participation of elected officials 
at all levels of government, BoricuActivatEd 
represents civic engagement and empower-
ment at its best. 
I am proud to congratulate BoricuActivatEd 
on its fifth anniversary and wish them every 
success as they embark on new accomplish-
ments in the years ahead.

RECOGNITION OF THE 154TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE LUNDY CHAP-
EL 
MISSIONARY 
BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Lundy Chapel Mis-
sionary Baptist Church of Macon, Georgia for 
its 154 blessed years of faithful service and 
ministry to the greater community. Lundy 
Chapel will celebrate their anniversary on Sun-
day, October 2, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. during 
their Sunday service in Macon. 
Throughout its long history, Lundy Chapel 
has proven that patience, faith, and the hard 
work of dedicated leaders can lead to great 
accomplishments for the service of others. 
The story of Lundy Chapel Missionary Baptist 
Church, which began as a small group of peo-
ple worshipping 154 years ago and has grown 
into an expansive and successful church, is 
truly an inspiring one of the perseverance of a 
faithful congregation who put all their love and 
trust in the Lord. Having humble beginnings, 
the first service of the Lundy Chapel Mis-
sionary Baptist Church was held under a bush 
arbor in 1868 on Old Lundy Road by Rev. 
Dan Parsons. Shortly thereafter, the congrega-
tion constructed a log cabin church which 
would eventually burn down. Judge R.S. 
Lundy was moved by the Lord to deed the 
church a plot of land on Forest Hill Road from 
the Lundy Estate on which the Lundy Chapel 
could construct a new house of worship, and 
in 1963 the congregation constructed its new 
home under the leadership of Rev. L.H. 
Hendrix. Over the years, it is here that the 
church continued to thrive through the dedi-
cated service of several pastors, including 
Rev. O.R. Redding, Sr., Rev. H.C. Cain, Rev. 
Lewis E. Lockett, Rev. Wallace B. Herring, Sr., 
and Rev. James H. Hall. 
On April 5, 1998, Rev. Anthony Q. Corbett, 
Sr. was called to pastor Lundy Chapel Mis-
sionary 
Baptist 
Church. 
Under 
Pastor 
Corbett’s shepherding and the grace of God, 
the church bounded to new heights. In addi-
tion to its fast-growing membership, the Lord 
instilled within Pastor Corbett a vision to con-
struct a new sanctuary for the faithful con-
gregation. On October 28, 2001, a Ribbon 
Cutting Ceremony was held as the church 
marched into its new sanctuary for Sunday 
School, followed by the first worship service. 
After the construction was completed, the Lord 
turned Pastor Corbett’s eye to the spiritual en-
richment and upbringing of Lundy Chapel’s 
young people. In March 2005, Pastor Corbett 
and church leadership implemented the Lundy 
Higher Heights Community Enrichment Cor-
poration to provide special programs that 
would provide the church’s youth with a sense 
of direction and motivation, a source of inspi-
ration, and financial support through college 
scholarships. Additionally, the Enrichment Cor-
poration seeks not only to uplift the church’s 
youth, but also to extend support to that of the 
greater Middle Georgia community; the organi-
zation provides incredibly useful information 
and resources meant to assist community or-
ganizers to develop their own service pro-
grams. This mission of aiding and inspiring 
community youth to pursue an education and 
meaningful careers was exemplified by the 
creation of the Lundy Higher Heights Commu-
nity Enrichment Corporation’s Lundy Wonder-
land Summer Day Camp, where young camp-
ers can participate in academic studies, field 
trips, recreational activities, hear weekly ca-
reer speakers, and more. Through this pro-
gramming, campers have the opportunity to 
gain useful career skills so they can go on to 
lead fruitful lives rooted in God’s greater plan. 
On March 3, 2013, Lundy Chapel Missionary 
Baptist Church continued to grow its ministry 
by building a Family Life Center which in-
cludes an administrative and educational 
building and a gymnasium. Lundy Chapel’s fa-
cilities have proven very popular among the 
greater community as many groups often rent 
out its spaces to hold meetings, dinners, 
sports camps, weddings, funerals, and more. 
In Matthew 28:18–20, Jesus tells his fol-
lowers, ‘‘All authority in heaven and on earth 
has been given to me. Go therefore and make 
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the 
name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey every-
thing that I have commanded you.’’ Under 
Pastor Corbett’s dedicated leadership, several 
ministers have been licensed and ordained to 
spread the word of God to other congrega-
tions, including Rev. Roosevelt Glover, Rev. 
Richard Vaughn, Rev. Tony Lowden, Rev. An-
thony Stewart, Rev. Ernest Lawson, and Rev. 
Alexander Gibson. It is without a doubt that 
Lundy Chapel Missionary Baptist Church’s 
ministry has touched so many lives in the Mid-
dle Georgia community and inspired so many 
to do what they may not have previously 
thought possible. Pastor Corbett has done 
great things for Lundy Chapel, but none of 
these accomplishments would have been pos-
sible without the grace of God and the love 
and support of his extraordinary wife, Juanita. 
Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues 
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 
more than 730,000 people of Georgia’s Sec-
ond Congressional District in recognizing and 
honoring the Lundy Chapel Missionary Baptist 
Church on its 154th anniversary for its con-
gregation’s enduring commitment to each 
other and to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
May their actions continue to inspire the com-
munity in courage, in dedication, and in faith.

PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNING CREW 
ACT (S. 2293) INTO LAW 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, this week I 
was proud to join President Biden at the White 
House for the signing ceremony of S. 2293, 
the Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce 
(CREW) Act, which is the Senate companion 
to legislation I introduced to protect Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) re-
servists from losing their fulltime employment 
when they are called to assist communities 
during disasters. 
Right now, we are continuing to see 
wildfires burning in the West and are in the 
middle of hurricane season which is causing 
tremendous damage on the East Coast with 
Hurricane Ian. These disasters are becoming 
deadlier and costlier due to climate change, 
and we need to have a FEMA reservist work-
force ready to respond when communities 
need it most. 
Unlike military reserves, FEMA’s workforce 
is not afforded employment protections during 
deployment. When these men and women are 
answering the call of duty, they shouldn’t be 
worried about losing their means of income. 
That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation 
to guarantee these employment protections to 
the FEMA reservist workforce. 
This will not only give reservists peace of 
mind while they are responding to commu-
nities in need, but it will also bolster FEMA’s 
long-term recruitment and retention efforts that 
will better prepare our country for future disas-
ters.

MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 29, 2022 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 7780) to support 
the behavioral needs of students and youth, 
invest in the school-based behavioral health 
workforce, and ensure access to mental 
health and substance use disorder benefits: 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I include 
in the RECORD the cost estimate prepared by 
the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 
7780, the Mental Health Matters Act. The cost 
estimate was not available at the time of the 
filing of the Committee report.

estimate for H.R. 7780, the Mental Health 
Matters Act. 
If you wish further details on this esti-
mate, we will be pleased to provide them.

Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director. 
Enclosure. 
H.R. 7780 would expand resources to ad-
dress the mental health of K–12 students and 
staff members. The bill would authorize sev-
eral grant programs to support school-based 
mental health services and providers. It 
would require postsecondary institutions 
that receive federal financial assistance to 
develop policies to identify and provide spe-
cial accommodations to individuals with dis-
abilities. Finally, it would prohibit manda-
tory arbitration clauses, class action waiv-
ers, and representation waivers in employer- 
sponsored benefit plans under the Employ-
ment Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974. 
CBO estimates that the bill would have no 
effect on direct spending and would increase 
revenues over the 2022–2032 period. The bill 
contains provisions that would increase 
spending subject to appropriation, but CBO 
has not completed an estimate of those 
costs.

Section 602 of H.R. 7780 would allow the 
Secretary of Labor to impose civil monetary 
penalties on plan sponsors and administra-
tors of group health plans if they fail to 
meet requirements of parity in mental 
health and substance use disorder benefits; 
the penalties would begin one plan year after 
the date of enactment. Section 602 also 
would clarify existing provisions regarding 
the re-adjudication and payment of benefits 
to remedy violations. 
Based on the number of violations cited in 
Department of Labor reports regarding men-
tal health parity enforcement, CBO projects 
that there would be about 11 violations of 
mental health parity requirements per year 
with a small portion of those violations re-
sulting in penalty collections. In total, CBO 
estimates that penalty collections would in-
crease revenues by about $29 million over the 
2022–2032 period. 
H.R. 7780 would impose private-sector man-
dates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act by prohibiting mandatory arbi-
tration clauses, class action waivers, and 
representation waivers in employee benefit 
plans covered by the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act. It also would deem 
such provisions in existing contracts as un-
enforceable. The cost of the mandate would 
include any difference between the amounts 
received in rulings reached through the 
courts versus through arbitration. Because 
the resolution of arbitration proceedings is 
generally confidential, there is little data to 
compare with the outcome of traditional 
lawsuits. Furthermore, the number and type 
of claims that would be filed in the courts in 
the absence of arbitration is uncertain. 
Therefore, CBO cannot determine the cost of 
the mandate.

RECOGNIZING 
FEMALE 
LEADERS 
WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS 
HONORING 
AS 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-
dinary female leaders in our country who are 
being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try 
and lead by example through my faith and 
commitment to public service. But many times, 
people don’t look to Washington for their role 
models. Fortunately, it does not take long to 
find others guided by their strong moral com-
pass, faith, and commitment to selfless public 
service. Today, I honor some of these women, 
who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world. For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-
gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Dr. Madeline Manning 
Mims, is an author, international speaker, con-
temporary gospel recording artist, and a mem-
ber of many Halls of Fame. Madeline is a gold 
and silver Olympic medalist in track. She pio-
neered the 800-meter run for the United 
States by being the first (and until Tokyo 
2021, a 53-year span) only American woman 
to bring back a gold medal in this event, along 
with the Olympic Record, World Record and 
American Record. She has been a member of 
four Olympic teams for the United States and 
was the first American woman to break the 2- 
minute barrier in the 800-meter. She is a lead-
er among world athletes and the founder and 
president of the United States Council for 
Sports Chaplaincy, serving as a chaplain since 
1988 for the Olympic games. 
Madam Speaker I hope these women, such 
as Madeline, know full well the impact they 
have had on countless lives. These women 
are trailblazers, and the example they have 
set will be followed by people of my district, 
and many other Americans, for years to come. 
I thank each of them for their passion and 
commitment. This honor is well-deserved.

HONORING TIM LANIER 
HON. LAUREN BOEBERT 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the life of a great rancher, pub-
lic servant, family man, and friend—Tim La-
nier. Tim was a staple of the Southwest Colo-
rado agricultural community, a third-generation 
farmer descending from a proud family of 
homesteaders. Tim was a legend in the agri-
cultural community, and he was the honored 
recipient of the 2021 Stockman of the Year 
award. Tim was a rancher who worked tire-
lessly to serve his land and his family. Tim’s 
agricultural legacy will live on through his son, 
who is now a fourth-generation rancher. 
Tim’s life was one of service. Tim believed 
in people and went out of his way to support 
his friends and colleagues. His dedication to 
Montezuma County and the rest of South-
western Colorado will not be forgotten. He 
served for years as a firefighter and EMT for 
the Pleasant View Fire Department, and he 
served for over a decade on the Cortez 
School Board. Through his public service, he 
was a champion for the conservative values 
Southwest Colorado holds dear. His strong 
voice will be dearly missed, but I take comfort 
in knowing that his memory and contributions 
will live on in the community, and most impor-
tantly, with his family: his wife Merlene, his 
children Joseph, Stephanie, Emilie, Courtnie, 
and Ashlie, and his 21 grandchildren.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
U.S. 
MARINE 
CORPS RESERVE TOYS FOR TOTS 
PROGRAM 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the immeasurable generosity of 
the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots 
Program, and the seven Missouri chapters in 
my district: Boonville, California, Columbia, 
Kansas City, Moberly, Warrensburg, and 
Waynesville, as the program celebrates its 
75th year of giving. 
The U.S. Marine Corps Reserve not only 
serves abroad, but here at home as well. For 
the past 75 years, this program has spread 
Christmas cheer to over 281 million children 
across the country, distributing 627 million 
toys to kids in need with the help of their local 
communities. Tomorrow, on the first of Octo-
ber, chapters across Missouri and the United 
States will begin their annual toy drive, col-
lecting the priceless gift of providing children 
with happy Christmas memories. 
These acts of charity are not limited to the 
Christmas season; the U.S. Marine Corps Re-
serve Toys for Tots also supports families

HONORING MR. CHRIS SHAKE AND 
MR. SABU SHAKE, JR. 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. Chris Shake and Mr. Sabu 
Shake, Jr. for their contributions to the central 
coast of California and to celebrate 15 years 
of their annual philanthropy, ‘‘Sabu’s Safari.’’ 
Mr. Chris Shake and Mr. Sabu Shake, Jr. 
are sons of Sabu Shake, Sr., a well-known 
restaurateur, family man, and philanthropist, 
who passed away on December 5, 1998. In 
his memory, on the first-year anniversary of 
Mr. Shake, Sr.’s death, the brothers created 
the Sabu Shake Memorial Fundraiser to assist 
families during the holiday season. In 2002, it 
was decided that the Salvation Army Monterey 
Corps, one of their father’s favorite charities, 
would become the sole recipient of funds 
raised in memory of Mr. Shake, Sr. 
In 2008, the brothers created the dinner and 
auction event called ‘‘Sabu’s Safari’’ to raise 
additional funds for the Salvation Army. The 
inaugural dinner was attended by over 300 
members of the Monterey community. For its 
first two years, Sabu’s Safari was hosted at 
what is now the Monterey Zoo, and soon the 
fundraiser outgrew the venue, but the name 
stuck. Sabu’s Safari is now a community insti-
tution, attended by more people every year 
and, to date, has raised more than $1,725,000 
for the Salvation Army Monterey Corps. 
Through the brothers’ generous spirits and 
commitment to community, Sabu’s Safari and 
other Shake family fundraisers have raised 
over $5.7 million for Salvation Army Monterey 
Corps. Over the years, these funds have 
helped many local families and children in 
need through daily hot meals and food boxes, 
showers, laundry, computers, and job assist-
ance at the Sabu Shake Jr. Good Samaritan 
Center in Sand City, adjacent to what is now 
known as ‘‘Shake Avenue.’’ 
Today, on October 1, 2022, the gala takes 
place for the 15th and final time. The peren-
nially sold-out event marks the end of an era 
for the Shake brothers, but their legacy of phi-
lanthropy and community values will live on. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize Mr. Chris Shake and Mr. Sabu Shake, 
Jr’s impact on our community and the Central 
Coast. I extend my personal gratitude for their 
inspiring generosity and many philanthropic 
and civic contributions. It is therefore fitting 
and proper that we honor the Shake family 
here today. 
CELBRATING JUSTIN GERMAN 
AND CARSON HALE 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to rise in celebration of the 
marriage of my Chief of Staff, Justin German, 
to his new wife, Carson Hale. Justin has led 
my office since my first day in Congress in 
2019 and has proven to be an invaluable 
counselor and operator to the success of de-
livering for the nation and Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict. I am delighted to recognize Justin and his 
new bride as they begin their marriage. 
On August 20, 2022, the couple was joined 
by friends and family for a beautiful ceremony 
in Justin’s hometown of Harrisburg, Virginia. 
After vows were exchanged at Melrose Cav-
erns, the two celebrated their new commit-
ment with a honeymoon to Hawaii. 
Justin has spent countless hours managing 
complex policy implementation plans and 
doing the work of a true public servant. With 
that service comes the support and dedication 
of his new wife, Carson, who, in her own right, 
has an incredible career working in gardens 
and landscapes across the region. They truly 
complement one another and have built a 
beautiful life in Washington, D.C. 
Madam Speaker, it is a joy to recognize 
Justin and Carson and to extend enthusiastic 
well-wishes as they embark on this new chap-
ter of life as newlyweds. Please join me in 
celebrating the marriage of Justin German and 
Carson Hale.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
REBUILDING 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES-FLAG 
INTERNATIONAL FLEET ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the bipartisan ‘‘Rebuilding the United 
States-Flag International Fleet Act,’’ with Con-
gressmen GIBBS (R–OH) and LOWENTHAL (D– 
CA). 
Our comprehensive legislation would help to 
recapitalize the U.S.-flag international fleet of 
ocean-going, commercial vessels by guaran-
teeing government cargo during peacetime so 
that U.S.-flag vessels are available during war-
time or emergencies. The United States has 
the world’s most capable navy able to operate 
in all five oceans, and we need an equally im-
pressive fleet of commercial cargo vessels 
crewed by American mariners. 
For too long, Congress and both Democratic 
and Republican presidents have allowed the 
commercial fleet of U.S.-flagged, ocean-going 
vessels to dwindle. According to the U.S. De-
partment of Transportation’s Bureau of Trans-
portation Statistics, the number of ocean-going 
U.S.-flagged vessels has declined more than 
75 percent since 1985, following the 1982 
treaty called the United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea. 
The global supply chain crunch during the 
height of the COVID–19 pandemic, the Rus-
sian invasion and blockade of Ukraine, and 
the People’s Republic of China’s island build-
ing in the South China Sea and saber-rattling 
in the Taiwan Strait have shown that the 
United States cannot remain reliant on foreign 
vessels flying flags of convenience. 
The ‘‘Rebuilding the United States-Flag 
International Fleet Act’’ offers Congress the 
chance to enact the first comprehensive re-
form of cargo preference laws in decades. Our 
legislation incorporates recommendations for 
the Maritime Administration from the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s report published 
on September 14, 2022, entitled ‘‘Actions 
Needed to Enhance Cargo Preference Over-
sight.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of the 
House to join us in cosponsoring this critical 
legislation to address this crisis facing the 
U.S.-flag international fleet.

CELEBRATING THE CITY OF 
BARSTOW’S 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 75th Anniversary of 
the City of Barstow, California. This city, home 
to 25,415 residents in California’s 8th District, 
serves as a unique pillar of the High Desert 
culture and a crossroads of opportunity within 
our desert community. 
Barstow had its beginnings in 1947 as the 
Mojave Desert hub of Route 66 and the U.S. 
railroad system. Today, the city still serves a 
critical role in our nation’s transportation and 
logistics systems as home to the BNSF 
Railyard with the potential for great expansion 
and growth in our future that could forever 
change the landscape of this High Desert 
community. 
Barstow also plays a critical role in sup-
porting our military and military families. The 
city is home to the only veterans home in the 
Inland Empire and High Desert region. It also 
serves as a transportation hub for the U.S. 
Marine Corps with Marine Corps Logistics 
Base Barstow located just up the street and 
supports the U.S. Army as the closest town 
serving the National Training Center at Fort 
Irwin, where almost every soldier deployed to 
Afghanistan has trained. 
Furthermore, the city remains a critical 
waypoint as the last major town travelers pass 
on their way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. 
The city’s work to preserve this unique cultural 
input as we approach the 100 anniversary of 
historic Route 66 has helped to keep Cali-
fornia culture and American history alive and 
strong. 
As we celebrate Barstow’s 75th Anniver-
sary, I am proud to partner with local officials, 
including Mayor Paul Courtney, to help shep-
herd in economic growth, and the potential for 
a new golden age. Congratulations to the City 
of Barstow on its rich history and long future 
ahead.

WE MUST PASS THE JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI ACT 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the death and honor 
the legacy of Washington Post journalist, 
Jamal Khashoggi, and to support my bill, the 
Jamal Khashoggi Act. 
The murder of Mr. Khashoggi was not only 
a gross human rights violation, but a brutal 
crime. It is imperative that Congress send a 
message to the Executive Branch—and the 
world—that we will not condone those coun-
tries that target dissidents of any kind, includ-
ing journalists seeking to report the truth. 
As reported in David Ignatius’ September 28 
column 
in 
the 
Washington 
Post, 
Mr. 
Khashoggi’s final column was about the need 
for ‘‘free expression.’’ Mr. Khashoggi built a 
career on exposing assaults against press 
freedom and consistently reminded his read-
ers that all of us hold a stake in an open 
press; from here in the United States to Saudi 
Arabia, Turkey, China, and beyond. 
Mr. Khashoggi’s legacy must be honored. I 
am introducing this bill to demand the U.S. 
government do the right thing and impose ac-
countability for those who attack democratic 
voices. I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation and show the world that the United 
States will defend the global right to a free 
and open press.

TRIBUTE TO CINDY ROTH 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Cindy Roth, who is 
retiring after serving the Greater Riverside 
Chamber of Commerce for the past 45 years. 
Cindy has been a true leader in Riverside 
County for decades and served as an effective 
advocate whose many tireless efforts to better 
our region will be missed. 
Cindy’s lifelong career at the Chamber 
began when she was 17 years old. After serv-
ing as a staff member and working her way up 
through the organization, she was chosen to 
serve as President and CEO in 1999. 
Throughout her career, Cindy has been a 
powerful and influential voice for the Riverside 
business community in Southern California as 
well as our state capital in Sacramento and 
here in Washington, D.C. Everyone in River-
side County knows if you want to get some-
thing done, one of the best people to turn to 
is Cindy Roth. 
Over the years, Cindy has been a part of 
many efforts and achievements that have 
shaped the future of our region, including lo-
cating the California Air Resources Board 
emissions testing facility in Riverside and es-
tablishing the School of Medicine at the Uni-
versity of California, Riverside. My office and 
I have also enjoyed a productive partnership 
with Cindy to strengthen the role played by 
March Air Reserve Base and the Naval Sur-
face Warfare Center, Corona Division, in our 
national security and Riverside County. In ad-
dition to her role leading the Chamber, Cindy 
has been an active member of many commu-
nity organizations including the Monday Morn-
ing Group of Western Riverside County, The 
Raincross Club, the Fox Riverside Theater 
Foundation, the City of Riverside Economic 
Development Corporation, and the Foundation 
Board of Trustees for La Sierra University. 
Cindy clearly possesses a passionate belief 
in public service and a dedication to the com-
munity she has served so faithfully. I know I 
speak on behalf of all residents in expressing 
my heartfelt thanks and praise for Cindy’s sig-
nificant contributions to Riverside County. Per-
sonally, I will always value her friendship and 
collaboration on so many important issues. I 
wish Cindy, her husband Richard, and the en-
tire Roth family the very best in the years to 
come. 
RECOGNIZING 
FEMALE 
LEADERS 
WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS 
HONORING 
AS 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-
dinary female leaders in our country who are 
being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try 
and lead by example through my faith and 
commitment to public service. But many times, 
people don’t look to Washington for their role 
models. Fortunately, it does not take long to 
find others guided by their strong moral com-
pass, faith, and commitment to selfless public 
service. Today, I honor some of these women, 
who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world. For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-
gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Dr. Carol Swain, has 
risen from adversity to become an award-win-
ning political scientist, former tenured pro-
fessor at Princeton and Vanderbilt Univer-
sities, 
public 
intellectual, 
speaker, 
entre-
preneur, commentator, and author or editor of 
eleven books. She is passionate about em-
powering others to confidently raise their 
voices in the public square and so founded 
the Be the People Project (BTPP). Her clarion 
call is for ‘‘We the People to stand up and Be 
the People’’ who change our nation and world. 
Dr. Swain served on the Tennessee Advisory 
Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commis-
sion, the National Endowment for the Human-
ities, and the 1776 Commission. Her research 
has won national awards and has been cited 
in three U.S. Supreme Court cases. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Dr. Swain, know full well the impact they 
have had on countless lives. These women 
are trailblazers, and the example they have 
set will be followed by people of my district, 
and many other Americans, for years to come. 
I thank each of them for their passion and 
commitment. This honor is well-deserved.

ing from the Rock Island Fire Department after

Chief Yerkey first joined the Rock Island

helped found the Emergency Medical Techni-
cian-Paramedic program in 1991, a core unit 
still in place today. His honorable stewardship 
to his community earned him a promotion to 
lieutenant in 2000. As he continued to set an 
example of excellence among his peers, he 
was elevated to Captain in 2006, then Bat-
talion Chief in 2008. His innovative approach 
to protecting and serving his neighbors was 
unrelenting in every respect. Two years later, 
he was promoted to Assistant Fire Chief, 
where his experience was an asset to boost-
ing public safety. On April 4, 2016, he as-
cended to Fire Chief, a role he carried out with 
rare courage, dedication and spirit. Always 
committed to bettering his city, he took on the 
additional role of Assistant City Manager in 
July 2021. Chief Yerkey’s contributions to the 
City of Rock Island are deeply admirable. His 
impact on our region will be remembered for 
generations to come. 
It is because of heroic and determined lead-
ers such as Chief Yerkey that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to, again, 
formally recognize Rock Island Fire Depart-
ment Chief Jeff Yerkey on his retirement and 
thank him for his 33 years of service to our 
community.

RECOGNIZING 
DR. 
VINCENT 
L. 
ROSS, MD, ITALIAN AMERICAN 
MAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor Dr. Vincent L. Ross, MD, who will be 
named the Italian American Man of the Year 
by the Columbus Day Association of Lacka-
wanna County at their annual gathering on 
Sunday, October 9, 2022. 
Dr. Ross was born and raised in West 
Scranton, Pennsylvania to Luciano and Dora 
Ross. He completed his undergraduate degree 
at the University of Scranton as a cadet in the 
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. He 
then attended Loyola University-Chicago’s 
Stritch School of Medicine. After completing 
his medical degree in Chicago, Dr. Ross relo-
cated to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where he 
did a residency in pediatrics at the Harrisburg 
Hospital. In fulfillment of his commitment to 
the Air Force, Dr. Ross was assigned to two 
years of duty at the Air Force Academy in Col-
orado Springs, Colorado where he served as 
the physician for the football team. While in 
Colorado, he also worked in Denver-area hos-
pitals. As the use of air transport increased for 
moving critically ill children between hospitals, 
Dr. Ross had the opportunity, as a senior offi-
cer, to fly over the Rocky Mountains. 
In 1971, he returned to his native Scranton 
where he opened his own pediatrics practice. 
As the pediatrics department at the Commu-
nity Medical Center grew, he was named the 
Director of Pediatrics there. During his long 
tenure with the hospital, he was also named to 
the President’s staff and the hospital Board of 
Directors. For his dedication to medicine and 
Northeastern Pennsylvania, Dr. Ross was rec-
ognized by Mercy Hospital and Moses Taylor 
Hospital for 50 years of service. He also re-
ceived the American Medical Association Rec-
ognition Award, the 50 Year Award from the 
Lackawanna Medical Society, and the Soci-
ety’s Presidential Award. 
He currently lives in Scranton with his wife 
of 59 years, Donata, and they have three chil-
dren and two grandchildren. 
I am proud to join with the Columbus Day 
Association of Lackawanna County in recog-
nizing Dr. Ross for his commitment to caring 
for Northeastern Pennsylvania’s youngest resi-
dents for more than five decades. As a com-
passionate and highly respected physician and 
dedicated community member, he has been a 
driving force for good and is well deserving of 
this honor. May he continue to find fulfillment 
in his service to medicine and the community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF RICK SEDGWICK 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
privilege to honor the life and service of Rick 
Sedgwick, who passed away at the age of 67 
after a lifetime of service to the people of 
Michigan’s First District and beyond. 
Born in San Diego, California on November 
23, 1954, Rick moved to Michigan when he 
was a child. After graduating from Saginaw Ar-
thur Hill High School in 1973, he enrolled at 
Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, 
where he studied the Ojibwe language and 
culture and earned a degree in education. 
Rick would go on to work in community mental 
health, school transportation, the U.S. Postal 
Service, and various trades in the construction 
field before serving twenty-five years as a spe-
cial education teacher for Alcona Community 
Schools. In addition to his long and distin-
guished career, Rick and his family spent two 
years working as missionaries counseling Na-
tive Americans at Okontoe Christian Fellow-
ship Retreat Center in Northern Minnesota. 
This was just one of the many opportunities 
Rick pursued to spread the gospel and serve 
others. His church family could certainly con-
firm the same. Rick and his wife Robin were 
members of New Life Christian Fellowship in 
Alpena, Michigan for close to twenty years. 
Rick passed away on the morning of Sep-
tember 5, 2022, surrounded by his loving fam-
ily. His kindness, selflessness, and devotion to 
others will surely leave a lasting mark on 
those who had the opportunity to know him. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Rick Sedgwick. His 
legacy will forever live on in his family, friends, 
communities, and in the many lives he 
bettered through his service.

Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

They are working to provide peace of mind to 
Idaho families, farms, and businesses of Idaho 
by protecting what matters most. 
Over the last 75 years, Farm Bureau has

prosperity of Idaho’s communities. As an ac-
tive corporate citizen, Farm Bureau has been 
a positive force in Idaho by sponsoring Christ-
mas in the Night Skies, Relay for Life, Salute 
to Idaho Veterans, Elevate Leadership Sum-
mit, and the Gold Star Families Memorial 
Monument among other causes and events 
over the last 75 years. 
Farm Bureau has been awarded an AM 
Best financial strength rating of excellent or 
higher since 1959. In 1996, they earned the 
Better Business Bureau’s Torch award for eth-
ics. In 2021, they were awarded the best in-
surance company in Idaho by Forbes. In both

Demotech’s Star Award for superior business 
practices and customer satisfaction.

pany of Idaho for 75 years of exceptional serv-
ice to our great state.

HONORING MAJOR N. CODY RUSH 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to pay tribute to Major Cody Rush for his 
exemplary dedication to duty and service as 
an Army Congressional Fellow and the Army 
House 
Liaison 
Division. 
Major 
Rush 
is 
transitioning to the Army Reserves, where he 
will serve as a Legislative Liaison in the Office 
of the Chief of the Army Reserves. 
Hailing from Christiansburg, Virginia, Major 
Rush was commissioned as a Second Lieu-
tenant from the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets 
as an Armor Officer. He later transitioned to 
the Signal Corps. He earned a Bachelor’s De-
gree in Political Science from Virginia Tech, a 
Master’s Degree in Information Technology 
Management from Webster University, and a 
Master’s Degree in Legislative Affairs from 
The George Washington University. 
Major Rush has served in wide-ranging as-
signments during his 11 years as an Army offi-
cer including Tank and Scout Platoon Leader 
and Battalion S6 in the lst Cavalry Division at 
Fort Hood, Texas, Battalion S6 and Company 
Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division at 
Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Legislative Li-
aison in Washington, D.C. He served one 
combat deployment to Iraq with the 82nd Air-
borne Division and served in the first Region-
ally Aligned Combined Arms Battalion in the 
Korean. Peninsula. 
I had the privilege of working directly with 
Major Rush, who first served as a fellow in my 
office during the challenging year of 2020 and 
during his succeeding assignment as an Army 
Liaison until 2022. His professionalism, per-
formance and commitment to the mission, as 
both a fellow and liaison, are in keeping with 
the highest traditions of military service and 
made a lasting impression with Members and 
staff of the United States Congress. 
Throughout his career, Major Rush has 
positively impacted soldiers, peers and superi-
ors alike. Our country has benefited from his 
leadership,judgment and passion for the Army 
profession. 
The foundation of Cody’s success is his 
family. His wife, Tiffany, his daughter, Abigail, 
and son, Jackson, are the lights of his life. I 
thank Tiffany, Abigail and Jackson for their 
sacrifices in supporting Major Rush’s service 
to our country. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine 
pleasure to have worked with Major Rush 
since the second session of the 116th Con-
gress. It is with great appreciation that I recog-
nize and commend Major Rush for his service 
to our country and wish him all the best as he 
continues his service in the United States 
Army.

RECOGNITION OF TONY 
GIACOMAZZI 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Tony Giacomazzi, affectionately 
known as ‘‘Tony G.’’, for his commitment to 
the town of Hillsborough and in particular its 
children. Tony G. has positively impacted 
thousands of Hillsborough students as both a 
teacher and now recreation leader. For his 
outstanding contribution, he has been award-
ed the Community Care Award for 2022 by 
the 
Associated 
Parents’ 
Group 
of 
Hillsborough. 
Tony came to Hillsborough as a teacher in 
2003 and quickly gained the admiration of stu-
dents and parents. Originally hired as a sub-
stitute, he soon joined the staff in a full-time 
position, teaching 3rd and 4th graders for 
eight years. As a remarkable leader at West 
School, he quickly gained more responsibility 
as he became president of the Hillsborough 
Teacher Association. Although he wanted to 
become a principal, and earned his master’s 
degree in administration, he was drawn to 
sports and coaching. 
Ultimately, Tony couldn’t stay away from the 
sports fields, and he transitioned to the 
Hillsborough Recreation Department, formed 
through a joint powers agreement between the 
town and school district. For the past 12 
years, he has overseen preschool program-
ming, elementary after school class offerings, 
sports programs at Crocker Middle School, 
and classes for the greater Hillsborough com-
munity. 
Tony has the remarkable ability to remem-
ber the names of every child in the school dis-
trict along with the names of their siblings and 
parents. With that kind of memory, the man 
would 
obviously 
be 
competitive 
running 
against any member of Congress, including 
this one. He’s an employee of the district but 
he is also a parent. He volunteers to coach 
soccer, baseball, and basketball, referees flag 
football, and does master scheduling. There’s 
often grass beneath his feet, but it sure 
doesn’t grow there because this is a guy who 
is always on the move. 
The pandemic played havoc with recreation 
as well as learning. Tony was instrumental in 
bringing students back to campus during the 
pandemic. He worked closely with the board 
of education, faculty and the superintendent to 
find ways to keep the kids active yet safe. 
Teachers had childcare support because Tony 
arranged for it. He oversaw COVID testing at 
preschools and ensured that providers felt 
safe returning to schools. 
Tony attended both Serra High School and 
Mills High School. It was at Mills that he met 
his wife, Jackie. They have two sons—Max 
(13) and Zach (10). Max and Zach, in Turn, 
have a dog named Haze that they graciously 
agree to share with their parents. When not 
planning the next recreation event or working 
with the students, Tony enjoys playing golf, 
basketball and cheering for his favorite teams. 
He selected three great champions—the Gi-
ants, the Warriors and the Niners. Regrettably, 
from my personal point of view, he also roots 
for the Chiefs. 
In the documents describing his nomination 
for this year’s Community Care Award, Tony 
Giacomazzi was described as the perfect mix 
of teacher, coach, friend and mentor, and it 
was noted that he inspires the children to be 
their best selves both on and off the court. 
This is how American is built: one character at 
a time across generations. Congratulations to 
Tony Giacomazzi. His career will touch gen-
erations, and we are grateful that he is in pub-
lic service in the wonderful community of 
Hillsborough, California.

EPHRIAM 
FOR 
60 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to join the members of the New Vision 
Christian Center Church of God In Christ to 
celebrate Pastor Superintendent William R. 
Ephriam. At 87 years old, Supt. Ephraim is the 
longest-serving superintendent of the jurisdic-
tion of Colorado CHURCH OF GOD IN 
CHRIST, INC., and a pillar of the Colorado 
Springs community. He has been pastoring 
this congregation for a remarkable 50 years, 
and this year marks 60 years of dedicated 
service in the Colorado district. 
As Senior Pastor, Supt. Ephriam founded 
and served as Executive Director of the New 
Hope Home for Girls in Colorado Springs. This 
organization provides a safe Christian environ-
ment for as many as 600 girls who have been 
abused and are runaways. Many of these 
young ladies are now leading prosperous lives 
and remain in contact with Supt. Ephriam. 
He organized the Colorado Springs Council 
for Church and Social Action and served as 
Vice President of the Colorado Coalition for 
Religious Freedom. As a result of this work, 
God also led him to establish the New Hope 
Outreach Ministry and Jail Ministry at Re-
bound. 
Through Superintendent Ephriam’s labors of 
love and gracious patience, many people in 
the Fifth Congressional District have had mul-
tiple chances and restoration. His unique abil-
ity to motivate, inspire, and empower others is 
truly a gift of God—and has been a blessing 
to the Pikes Peak Region. 
Superintendent Ephriam’s exemplary service 
and strong leadership performance personify 
the essence of a great leader. He has led his 
congregation to the Word of God and the 
meaning of loving brotherhood, following the 
rule of Christ ‘‘Love thy neighbor as thyself’’ 
James 2:8. 
Please join me today in celebrating the Man 
of God William R. Ephriam and thanking him 
for admiringly serving our Lord and our region. 
‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’’

Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and honor the life of Joni 
Dahl from Gilbert, Minnesota, who tragically 
passed away in a car accident this summer. 
Born and raised on the Iron Range, Joni 
truly embodied the spirit of Our Way of Life in

passion and service for her community. 
Joni was the Executive Director of the 
Hibbing Area Chamber of Commerce and 
served on the Gilbert Planning and Zoning 
Commission, among many other local organi-
zations. 
She was also very passionate about racing 
and hockey. 
Joni impacted countless lives, and her loss

Let us all remember Joni’s compassion, 
dedication, and love for northern Minnesota 
and her fellow Iron Rangers. 
May her legacy live on.

Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to

dinary female leaders in our country who are

‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try

gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Libia Duran, was born 
in Columbia, South America, and is a commu-
nity leader concerned with the education of 
children, youth, and their families at the local 
and national level. Her dream is to see all mi-
nority families across the nation fully engaged 
and invested in their children’s education. This 
dream was born as a result of the experience 
she had as an immigrant mother in the public 
school system in the United States. She be-
came an advocate through serving the com-
munity in leadership roles, volunteering at the 
elementary school level. For this work, she re-
ceived the Maryland Governor’s ‘‘Volunteer of 
the Year’’ award. Libia also founded Pastors 
Wives of America, an organization that fo-
cuses on empowering women with leadership 
potential by equipping families to become en-
gaged in the education of their children. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Libia, know full well the impact they have 
had on countless lives. These women are trail-
blazers, and the example they have set will be 
followed by people of my district, and many 
other Americans, for years to come. I thank 
each of them for their passion and commit-

Texas on his amazing accomplishment of run-
ning 100,000 miles. 
Mr. Schlater is currently the Assistant Track

three miles every day. On October 21st, he

completing his last two laps at the SJA sta-
dium before the Homecoming football game. 
Mr. Schlater has served his community 
faithfully by being a role model for students in 
Brownsville. His commitment to his students 
and to the community is commendable and 
deserves recognition. It is only fitting that Mr. 
Schlater celebrates his final run amongst stu-
dents, friends, and family, as he has devoted 
part of his career to the Brownsville commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize

Speaker, today, I rise to honor John Dodd, an 
exemplary leader in North Carolina. John re-
tired in 2020 after serving for 26 years as 
President of The Jesse Helms Center based 
in Wingate, North Carolina. As President, John 
organized a $5 million campaign to fund the 
Center’s current headquarters, museum, and 
archives. John dedicated the headquarters 
building in 2001 alongside the former British 
Prime Minister, Lady Margaret Thatcher, and 
Senator and Mrs. Helms. 
John is also the Founder of The Helms 
Center’s nationally acclaimed Free Enterprise 
Leadership Challenge, an educational program 
for high school students to further entrepre-
neurship and freedom. To date, the program 
has served more than 11,000 graduates 
around the world. Beyond North Carolina, 
John worked with government and education 
leaders in Mexico to introduce The John 
Templeton Foundation’s Laws of Life char-
acter education program. He also co-authored 
a book, And The World Came His Way: Jesse 
Helms’ Contributions to Freedom. 
John also maintains another important role 
in his local community: lacrosse coach. He’s 
led three teams, from both the college and 
high school ranks, to national and state cham-
pionships. I hope John is truly able to enjoy 
his retirement with his wife, Teresa, and chil-
dren, Katie and Mary. 
I congratulate John on his successful ca-
reer, and thank him for his remarkable leader-
ship and dedication to his fellow North Caro-
linians. I wish him a long and happy retire-
ment.

RECOGNIZING 
FEMALE 
LEADERS 
WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS 
HONORING 
AS 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-
dinary female leaders in our country who are 
being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try 
and lead by example through my faith and 
commitment to public service. But many times, 
people don’t look to Washington for their role 
models. Fortunately, it does not take long to 
find others guided by their strong moral com-
pass, faith, and commitment to selfless public 
service. Today, I honor some of these women, 
who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world: For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-
gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Kristi Noem, is the 
current, and the first, female Governor of 
South Dakota. 
Governor Noem is a small business owner, 
a rancher, a farmer, and former member of 
the South Dakota state legislature and United 
States House of Representatives. As a be-
liever that government should serve the peo-
ple, she works night and day to ensure her 
constituents have ample opportunities given to 
them for a chance at a brighter future. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Governor Noem, know full well the impact 
they have had on countless lives. These 
women are trailblazers, and the example they 
have set will be followed by people of my dis-
trict, and many other Americans, for years to 
come. I thank each of them for their passion 
and commitment. This honor is well-deserved.

Action Center as they celebrate 40 years of 
service to the communities of Central Wash-
ington. 
The Northwest Community Action Center 
first opened in 1982 to help expand on the 
mission of the Yakima Valley Farm Workers 
Clinic, 
helping 
families 
weatherize 
their 
homes, pay their bills, navigate the healthcare 
system, and provide them with after-care 
school services. 
Since its opening, the Northwest Community 
Action Center has expanded its service pro-
grams to meet the needs of families across 
Washington and Oregon. 
Today, community members can take ad-
vantage of the variety of services they now 
offer, which include adult education classes, 
English language classes, homelessness serv-
ices, citizenship classes, and so much more. 
I extend my congratulations and gratitude to 
the Northwest Community Action Center for its 
leadership and many years of service to our 
Central Washington communities.

HOMETOWN HERO—DONNA 
CRANSTON 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Donna 
Cranston 
of 
Coppell, Texas as this week’s Texas-24 
Hometown Hero. Donna’s commitment to sup-
porting our veterans has made a great impact 
on our community. 
Donna started an organization called De-
fenders of Freedom when her son Matt served 
in Iraq. Matt experienced a lot of action and 
trauma while serving and came home with se-
vere PTSD, which many veterans across the 
nation also face. Donna and Defenders of 
Freedom were able to partner with members 
of the medical community to treat veterans 
with brain treatment. 
Defenders of Freedom provides donors with 
the organization they need to support post 
9/11 Veterans in their transition to civilian life 
through emergency financial assistance, mo-
rale building programs, and traumatic brain in-
jury treatment. 
I thank Donna for the support and care she 
is sharing with our veterans who have fought 
to protect us and our Nation. Her contributions 
and sacrifices do not go unnoticed and the im-
pact she is making on the lives of Texas-24 
veterans is immensely appreciated.

One 
of 
these 
women, 
Elsa 
Prince 
Broekhuizen, has inspired many with her time, 
talent, and treasure. Elsa was born in Holland, 
Michigan, the beloved daughter of hard-work-
ing greenhouse owners. Elsa, along with her 
late husband, Ed, started Prince Corporation. 
With their giving spirit, they branched into 
community responsibility, investing deeply of 
their time and resources to create partnerships 
and revitalize their own downtown Holland. 
Their principled investment continued to grow 
nationally and globally. Elsa’s unwavering con-
victions and deeply loving heart have helped 
many successful people and organizations 
grow at home, across the nation, and around 
the world. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such

RECOGNITION OF REVEREND DR. 
JOHN DUCKWORTH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today, I want 
to recognize Reverend Dr. John Duckworth of 
Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church in 
Michigan’s 13th District Strong, as he cele-
brates his twentieth pastoral anniversary. 
Reverend Dr. Duckworth began his career 
in ministry at Samaritan Missionary Baptist of 
Detroit, where he faithfully served until 2002 
when he accepted the Call from Gethsemane 
Missionary Baptist Church of Westland. Dr. 
Duckworth has incorporated his holistic view 
of the ministry into his spiritual leadership of 
the flock at Gethsemane. He has executed 
that vision through the implementation of nu-
merous ministries that integrate church and 
community, including the Body & Soul Health 
and Well Being and the senior-focused Sage 
Ministry. Dr. Duckworth’s commitment to the 
community involves annual events. He also 
serves the community through his leadership 
to the various boards: Wholistic Living Com-
munity Corporation, Henry Ford Health Sys-
tems, Interfaith Health & Hope Coalition, and 
Authority Health. 
Reverend Dr. Duckworth holds dual Bach-
elor Degrees in Business Administration and 
Marketing & Management from Northwood 
University in Midland, Michigan. He also 
earned an Associates of Arts Degree in Adver-
tising while attending Northwood University. 
He has also earned a Master of Divinity De-
gree at the United Theological Seminary in 
Dayton, Ohio. His education includes inter-
national study of Biblical Geography and 
Archeology in Israel and Trans-Cultural Min-
istry in Ghana, West Africa. He has earned a 
Doctor of Ministry Degree from Ecumenical 
Theological Seminar in Detroit. In addition to 
his duties at Gethsemane, Reverend Dr. 
Duckworth serves as an instructor at the Herit-
age Center for Religious Studies and as an 
adjunct Professor at the Ecumenical Theo-
logical Seminary. He currently serves on the 
Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit & Vicinity, 
Inc, as well as the Inkster Ministerial Alliance. 
Please join me in celebrating Reverend Dr. 
John Duckworth’s 20 years of service to Geth-
semane Missionary Baptist Church and the 
community of Westland.

RECOGNIZING THE SUCCESS OF 
KATOM RESTAURANT SUPPLY 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize the success story of a fantastic 
company in East Tennessee and the family 
that runs it. 
Back in 2003, a company called KaTom 
Restaurant Supply was operating out of a ga-
rage. It had fewer than 20 employees and 
brought in about 3.5 million dollars per year. 
This year, that company will bring in almost 
half a billion dollars. In less than twenty years, 
it boomed into one of the nation’s largest res-
taurant equipment suppliers that ships thou-
sands of products to food service industries all 
across the country. 
This company’s amazing success is due to 
the hard work and dedication of the family that 
runs it. 
Patricia Bible is the founder, president, and 
CEO of KaTom, and she runs the company 
with her two kids, Paula and Charley. The 
company is actually named after the kids, 
whose middle names are Katherine and Tom. 
Patricia is also a breast cancer survivor, and 
she funded a mobile mammogram that travels 
to rural counties across East Tennessee. This 
mammogram catches cancer and saves lives 
of women who otherwise wouldn’t have ac-
cess to these services. 
I want to congratulate this family and every-
one at KaTom for all their success. Our econ-
omy is built on companies like this, and these 
kinds of accomplishments only happen with a 
LOT of hard work and dedication. It’s espe-
cially wonderful to see a family building some-
thing like this together.

dedicated his time to the historic shipyard, 
from his first job to his role as secretary, treas-
urer, vice executive director, executive direc-
tor, and tour guide. 
In 1945, Bill enlisted in the Navy at the age 
of 17 and was assigned as a submariner to 
the USS Sea Owl, a ship he was familiar with 
as he had worked on the Sea Owl’s construc-
tion in Portsmouth. Bill continued his service in 
Key West, Florida operating a recommissioned 
U–2513 German U-boat, an experience that 
made him one of the few members of the U.S. 
Navy qualified to operate both U.S. sub-
marines and German U-boats. 
Bill’s continued service to the oldest active 
shipyard in the Nation has ensured that it both 
functions as an effective repair station for our 
military’s submarines as well as a historic 
landmark in Portsmouth. The shipyard’s Herit-
age Center contains many pieces of naval his-
tory, including the launching cage used to 
christen the 1938 USS Squalus, a piece that 
Bill tracked down himself. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate Bill for 78 years of service and 
thank him for his outstanding contributions to 
the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and our Na-
tion.

HONORING CORY SMITH 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Cory Smith, a 
Firefighter Paramedic with South Lake County 
Fire and CAL FIRE in Cobb, California. I have 
named Mr. Smith as a Public Safety Hero of 
the Year for Lake County in California’s 5th 
District as a result of his extraordinary self-
lessness, dedication, and service to others. 
Mr. Smith has dedicated years of faithful 
service to his community, both as a paramedic 
and Fire Marshal with Lake County Fire as 
well as a volunteer Fire Captain with the 
South Lake County Fire Protection District. 
In August 2021, Mr. Smith showed great ini-
tiative and assisted in the safe evacuation of 
multiple civilians as a member of Prevention 
715 (Lake County Fire Protection District). Ar-
riving at the Cache Fire in Clearlake, Mr. 
Smith and his team worked with two engine 
companies from CALFIRE to remove fences 
and clear paths. During this assignment, they 
discovered two individuals in immediate dan-
ger from nearby flames. Upon safe evacuation 
to their engine, the firefighters found severe 
burns on one woman and radioed for a med-
ical unit to transport her to a nearby hospital. 
When Mr. Smith is not fighting fires, he is a 
dedicated husband and father who enjoys 
spending time with his wife and three kids. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Mr. 
Smith is an exemplary civil servant who rep-
resents the very best of our community. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today. 
VISIT AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 28, 2022 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in 
favor of my legislation to strengthen the U.S. 
travel and tourism industry at a time when it 
is needed most. 
Las Vegas welcomes nearly 43 million visi-
tors annually from around the world. My Visit 
America Act will ensure tourism is at the table 
when we consider national economic policy. 
Currently, the United States is the only 
member of the G20 that does not have a Cab-
inet-level or equivalent position focused on 
tourism. 
My bill creates an Assistant Secretary posi-
tion at the Department of Commerce specifi-
cally charged with strengthening the United 
States travel and tourism industry. This de-
partment will work with other agencies to co-
ordinate a comprehensive tourism strategy 
and help position cities like Las Vegas to 
serve as hosts for large meetings, con-
ferences, and exhibitions. 
Having a position at the Department of 
Commerce to oversee travel and tourism will 
not only help insulate Southern Nevada’s re-
gional economy from future economic shocks 
but also better position the U.S. travel econ-
omy in the age of global competitiveness. 
I look forward to working with the new As-
sistant Secretary to bolster our hospitality in-
dustry and let the world know the U.S. is a 
great place to visit, to work, and to play.

HONORING 
THE 
COMMODORE 
SLOAT CHAPTER OF THE NA-
TIONAL SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF 
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Commodore Sloat Chapter of 
the National Society Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution, as it celebrates a century of 
dedication to promoting patriotism, preserving 
American history, and securing America’s fu-
ture through better education for our children. 
The National Society Daughters of the 
American Revolution was founded on October 
11, 1890, during a time marked by a renewed 
sense of patriotism and intense interest in the 
beginnings of the United States of America. It 
was founded by women wanting to express 
their patriotic feelings and perpetuate the 
memory of our ancestors who fought to make 
this country free and independent. 
The Commodore Sloat Chapter of the Na-
tional Society Daughters of the American Rev-
olution was organized on September 29, 1922, 
in the city of Pacific Grove, California. Origi-
nally named the Pacific Grove Chapter, it was 
renamed the Commodore Sloat Chapter on 
September 19, 1934, to commemorate the 
contributions of Commodore John Drake 
Sloat, who led the Battle of Monterey and es-
tablished California as part of the United 
States of America. 
The Commodore Sloat Chapter’s 117 mem-
bers actively support the national objective of 
historic preservation, education, and patriotism 
through national, state, and local activities. 
Their educational efforts include the hosting of 
an American history essay contest, the Good 
Citizen awards, and youth luncheons. Under-
standing the importance of patriotism, the 
chapter supports the Central Coast’s veterans, 
active-duty military members, and Junior Re-
serve Officer Training Corps, as well as par-
ticipates in Monterey’s Fourth of July Parade. 
The Chapter routinely recognizes and honors 
local members of our community for their con-
tributions to the preservation of American his-
tory. Notably, ‘‘Sloat’s Landing’’ is celebrated 
annually in Monterey, where Sloat’s Proclama-
tion is read. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the century-long efforts of the Com-
modore Sloat Chapter of the National Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution and their in-
valuable contributions to the Central Coast. It 
is therefore fitting and proper we honor them 
here today.

RECOGNIZING MS. GERALDINE S. 
KILSDONK 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great honor to rise in recognition of Ms. Geri 
Kilsdonk, a spirited resident of Plymouth, 
Michigan, who has dedicated herself to nu-
merous causes that benefit Michigan’s 11th 
District. Ms. Kilsdonk has made an immense 
impact on the lives of those around her, and 
I am thrilled to join the community in cele-
brating Ms. Kilsdonk for her many contribu-
tions to her fellow Americans. 
In 1943, Ms. Geri Kilsdonk was born to Mr. 
Joseph Flinn and Ms. Loretta Flinn. Her father 
was a member of the International Brother-
hood of Teamsters, as a ‘‘milk man’’ in Illinois, 
while her mother worked hard raising Geri and 
her two brothers and two sisters at their home 
in Evanston, Illinois. Geri was prepared for her 
life of service through her Catholic School 
education, instilling in her values that guided 
her through her adult life and activism. 
In 
1968, 
Geri 
Kilsdonk 
married 
John 
Kilsdonk, beginning their 33–year marriage. 
The couple made Southeast Michigan their 
home after departing Illinois. Taking advan-
tage of an FHA loan, the Kilsdonks submitted 
a $2,000 down payment on their first Michigan 
house, making Dearborn Heights, Michigan 
their new community. Like many in Metropoli-
tan Detroit, the family made their living by 
working in the automotive industry. Ms. 
Kilsdonk was proud of her husband’s 33–year 
career at Ford Motor Company, eventually 
earning him an executive-level position. In 
1974, the family chose the Northville/Plymouth 
area as their permanent residence. Because 
Their daughter, Susanne, began kindergarten 
in the Northville public schools and graduated 
from Madonna University. 
A new chapter began with the passing of 
Geri’s husband, John, in September of 2001. 
Geri bravely delivered her husband’s eulogy 
before returning to what she did best, advo-
cating for a better society. As a member of an

automotive family, Geri understood the impor-
tance of the industry to the lives of many of 
her neighbors. During the 2008 automotive fi-
nancial crisis, Geri lost the healthcare cov-
erage she earned as a surviving spouse of a 
Ford retiree. Geri knew that her neighbors 
were also feeling the strain from the struggling 
automotive industry, so she created her own 
script and called her neighbors to discuss 
these important issues and urge them to take 
action through civic participation. 
Described as a ‘‘doer’’ by those who know 
her, Geri donates immense amounts of time to 
the causes that she values. She has sup-
ported Ronald McDonald House Charities for 
many years, along with contributions to the 
arts and culture through her support of the 
Plymouth Historical Museum and the Penn 
theater. Geri’s impact extends to education, as 
well, having created nursing scholarships for 
future medical professionals and part of the 
Schoolcraft College Foundation. Many in 
Michigan’s 11th District and across the state 
have benefitted from expanded educational 
opportunities, gained access to critical serv-
ices, and engaged with the vibrant cultural ex-
periences that have been supported by Ms. 
Kilsdonk. 
Madam Speaker, Geri continues to bring 
about positive change to Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict with her ongoing contributions to civics, 
health, and the arts. Please join me in thank-
ing Geri for her commitment to strengthening 
our communities.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
WORK 
OF 
FORMER 
DIRECTOR 
OF 
CASE-
WORK AND CONSTITUENT SERV-
ICES ELLIE LABOTTE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate and recognize the work of Ellie 
LaBotte, my former Director of Casework and 
Constituent Services in Rock Island, Illinois. 
Ellie was the very first intern to be hired in 
my district office, and due to her exceptional 
work, was hired as a Constituent Advocate be-
fore she even graduated college. She quickly 
moved up to Senior Constituent Advocate and 
was later promoted to Director of Constituent 
Services. In our office Ellie handled Veterans 
and Department of Defense casework, and 
was instrumental in identifying issues with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs on the ground. 
She also ran our robust intern program in Illi-
nois, maintaining strong ties to many former 
interns and assisting them in their future ca-
reers. 
Ellie was responsible for getting military 
medals for many constituents. However, the 
one that meant the most to her and was a 
major casework achievement, was getting a 
Prisoner of War Medal for Richard Holmquist, 
who earned this during his service in the Ko-
rean War, and had previously fought in World 
War II. I had the great pleasure of presenting 
the award to his son, Paul Holmquist, during 
a prominent medals ceremony with participa-
tion from the Deputy Commanding General of 
First Army at the Rock Island Arsenal. During 
her time in the office, Ellie successfully closed 
nearly 2,000 cases and has made a significant 
difference in the lives of countless constitu-
ents. 
It is because of dedicated and impactful 
leaders such as my former Director of Case-
work and Constituent Services, Ellie LaBotte, 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally celebrate the 
amazing work of Ellie LaBotte.

RECOGNITION OF DON GEDDIS 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dr. Don Geddis upon the occa-
sion of his being named Citizen of the Year for 
2022 by the Associated Parents’ Group of 
Hillsborough. His service to our community is 
so enormous that I think of Don as being one 
of the towering eucalyptus trees that populate 
the town . . . . . without, of course, all the 
shedding bark. 
When Don’s children entered Hillsborough 
schools in 2006, he immediately took a leader-
ship role by joining the School Site Council, 
placing him on the West Parent Group execu-
tive board. For many years he was a highly 
qualified judge of the West iLab Tech Chal-
lenge, bringing his PhD in artificial intelligence 
and computer science from Stanford to bear 
on the work product of student tinkerers. He 
also served for two years as the West Parent 
Group’s trustee representative, giving him ex-
tensive exposure to the operations of the 
school board. 
Don took the plunge and ran for school 
board in 2013. He has served every year 
since, four times as board president. He com-
bines this volunteer job with service on the 
recreation commission, a joint powers author-
ity between the school district and the town of 
Hillsborough. He also serves as trustee liaison 
to the Associated Parents’ Group. 
The pandemic hit every school district hard, 
and every district scrambled to create remote 
work. The biggest challenge, however, was 
the creation of a back-to-school safety plan. 
Don and the District Core Return to School 
team created testing and other protocols that 
permitted Hillsborough schools to be one of 
the first in the state to return to full-time, in- 
person instruction. As a major leader in the 
town, Don explained the plan to countless par-
ents and advocated for it at the board. He lo-
cated testing solutions and helped plan the 
district’s testing policy. The students and par-
ents of Hillsborough will be forever grateful to 
Don for his dedication to education and to 
public health. 
Measure H was a $140 million school facili-
ties bond measure that recently passed due in 
no small part to Don’s leadership. It paves the 
way for modern schools in Hillsborough for 
decades to come. As a school board member, 
he’s also served on the board’s negotiation 
team, mentored new trustees, and been active 
in the San Mateo County School Boards Asso-
ciation. 
Don is not all about work or even civic en-
deavors. If you visit his website, you’ll imme-
diately see a list of 18 major life accomplish-
ments, starting with his bachelor’s in computer 
science at Stanford and ending with his cur-
rent status as a board member and recreation 
commissioner. 
However, arrayed below that list is another 
list of ‘‘Completed Bets.’’ For example, in 2015 
he apparently bet on whether then-Judge 
Kavanaugh would be appointed to the Su-
preme Court. He lost a buck. In the 2017 
match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and 
Conor McGregor, he bet $10 and won. He’s 
obviously a better boxing fan than reader of 
Senate tea leaves. Between 2002 and 2020 
he bet 34 times on various events paying out 
donuts (2019) or that dollar, and winning lob-
ster or truffles. Altogether, he’s won 21 times, 
had one draw and there’s one bet still out-
standing (fusion power, 100MW+ in 20 years 
from 2018). His site also lists his four other 
current websites and five previous websites, 
including one that he says was a joke. 
As this list demonstrates, Don is a brainiac, 
but I can honestly state that he’s one of the 
most personable, and earnest, people that I’ve 
ever met. In case you doubt his driven nature, 
he participates in both Aiki and Brazilian Jiu-
jitsu and has third-degree black belts in both 
forms of martial arts. As the holder of a brown 
belt in judo, the conclusion that I draw from 
his website is that you probably come out bet-
ter betting cash with Don, and losing, than 
fighting him and losing. 
Despite Don being something of a rocket 
scientist by nature, he is about as down to 
earth as they come. For this and many more 
reasons he will always be an honored resident 
of our community, and it is my honor to note 
his contributions to America in today’s record 
of the proceedings of the House of Represent-
atives. Congratulations to Don, his wife Laura 
and their family on his remarkable achieve-
ments. His neighbors and countless friends 
are betting he’ll be a leader for many more 
years to come. We’re not going to lose that 
bet.

HONORING ADA LIMO´ N 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ada Limo´n. In 
recognition of her outstanding work as a poet, 
Ms. Limo´n has been selected by the Library of 
Congress as this year’s Poet Laureate Con-
sultant in Poetry, making her the 24th indi-
vidual to receive this coveted position. 
Ms. Limo´n was born and raised in Sonoma 
County, California to a family of educators and 
artists. She graduated from Sonoma Valley 
High School in 1993 and attended the Univer-
sity of Washington. Ms. Limo´n then earned a 
Master of Fine Arts degree at New York Uni-
versity. She now lives with her husband in 
Lexington, Kentucky. 
During her career, Ms. Limo´n has published 
6 books and maintained a faculty position at 
Queens University of Charlotte. Some of her 
work includes Sharks in the Rivers (2010), 
Bright Dead Things (2015), and The Hurting 
Kind (2022). Currently, she is in the process of 
writing her seventh book, titled Beast: An An-
thology of Animal Poems. 
She has received several awards for her 
work, including the National Book Critics Circle 
Award and the Chicago Literary Award for Po-
etry. Ms. Limo´n also has a podcast titled ‘‘The

Slowdown’’, which serves a platform for her to 
raise awareness of poetry. 
Nature is a key component and source of 
inspiration for Ms. Limo´n’s poetry. She speaks 
often of the influence of landscape in her work 
and how her surroundings impact the poetry 
that she creates. Additionally, Ms. Limo´n fo-
cuses on the structure of her poetry and how 
it is conveyed through speech. 
As the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry, 
Ms. Limo´n will be tasked with promoting po-
etry throughout the United States from Octo-
ber 2022 to May 2023. Following the prece-
dent of other laureates before her, Ms. Limo´n 
will create a project of her choosing and take 
steps to complete that project throughout her 
time in the position. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Ms. 
Limo´n has left a tremendous impact on both 
her community and the United States through 
her work as a poet. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor her here today. 
RECOGNIZING 
FEMALE 
LEADERS 
WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS 
HONORING 
AS 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 30, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and highlight the work of some extraor-
dinary female leaders in our country who are 
being honored by She Leads America as 
‘‘Christian Women of Distinction.’’ 
For my constituents back in Michigan, I try 
and lead by example through my faith and 
commitment to public service. But many times, 
people don’t look to Washington for their role 
models. Fortunately, it does not take long to 
find others guided by their strong moral com-
pass, faith, and commitment to selfless public 
service. Today, I honor some of these women, 
who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world. For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-
gious freedom here in Congress to ensure 
each of these women, and all of my constitu-
ents, never have to compromise their religious 
beliefs in order to conform to whatever the 
trending culture is at the moment. 
One of these women, Kathleen Cooke, is a 
leading figure in the entertainment industry, 
who along with her husband Phil, co-founded 
the Cooke Media Group where she oversees 
casting and creative development. They also 
founded the Influence Lab, a nonprofit that 
internationally mentors leaders on the use of 
media. Among her other endeavors, Kathleen 
is an actress and member of the Screen Ac-
tors Guild, adjunct professor at Biola Univer-
sity, founder of the Christian Women in Media 
Association’s Hollywood chapter, and national 
advisory board member for the Salvation 
Army. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women, such 
as Kathleen, know full well the impact they 
have had on countless lives. These women 
are trailblazers, and the example they have 
set will be followed by people of my district, 
and many other Americans, for years to come. 
I thank each of them for their passion and 
commitment. This honor is well-deserved.
