PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our star of hope, con-
tinue to be the light that enables us to 
see the way. Lead our lawmakers to ac-
complish Your work on Earth, making 
them Your agents for justice, truth, 
and freedom. Inspire them to be stew-
ards of Your will as You answer their 
cries for help. Lord, listen to their fer-
vent prayers as they wait expectantly 
for Your deliverance. Keep our Sen-
ators on the right path of Your pre-
vailing providence, and surround them 
with the shield of Your love. Defend 
them with Your heavenly grace, and 
give them the courage to face perils 
with total trust in You. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
watch the news or read the newspapers, 
and you will know that there are a lot 
of deliberations going on to help with 
the problems that we have of people 
being unemployed, the pandemic we 
are fighting, and getting the economy 
up and running. While those negotia-
tions are going on, every once in a 
while, some of us on this side of the 
aisle try to get things to help people 
who have needs. 
A few days ago, the Democratic lead-
er objected to one of these attempts, 
which was a short-term extension of 
the Federal unemployment supplement 
that was created by this body as part of 
the 
CARES 
Act. 
Remember, 
the 
CARES Act passed unanimously by 
this body back in March. Those things 
are running out, and we are trying to 
get them extended. This effort to get 
this short-term extension was to pro-
vide for Americans who need the con-
tinued help while talks continue about 
a longer extension and even more re-
lief. 
Common sense ought to play a role. 
There doesn’t seem to be any downside 
to a temporary extension, but there ap-
parently was a political upside to the 
other side’s blocking it. I hope we can 
work together and that the Democratic 
leader will let his Members work with 
their Republican colleagues on a path 
forward. This partisan ‘‘my way or the 
highway’’ approach just doesn’t work, 
particularly in a body in which it takes 
60 votes to get things done. These ob-
jections are not how we got the CARES 
Act passed in the first place, and it is 
not how we will continue to deliver for 
the American people now if we don’t 
get more cooperation. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BEIRUT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
first, I extend the Senate’s condolences 
to the people of Lebanon following yes-
terday’s horrific explosion in Beirut. 
Reports indicate that at least 100 have 
died and that more than 4,000 others 
were injured. 
The Lebanese people have seen more 
than their share of tragedy—civil war, 
Syrian occupation, terrorism and as-
sassination, sectarian violence, eco-
nomic and political corruption, the 
burden of caring for more than a mil-
lion refugees fleeing Syria. 
Now, unfortunately, once again, in 
the wake of great tragedy, the Leba-
nese Armed Forces will have to dem-
onstrate they serve the state of Leb-
anon and its people, not a political 
party or sect. Since the end of Syrian 
occupation, the LAF has demonstrated 
it can be a unifying and national force, 
largely free from sectarianism that 
corrodes other Lebanese institutions. 
Now it must do so again. 
The people of Beirut are beginning 
the hard work of rebuilding their city. 
Their nation continues its hard work 
to restore its democracy and sov-
ereignty. On these fronts, the Senate

and the American people stand with 
them in their journey. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, stop 
me if the story I am about to tell 
sounds familiar. 
The Speaker of the House and the 
Democratic leader summon President 
Trump’s representatives to the Capitol. 
They meet for a long while. The Demo-
crats emerge, saying they have per-
mitted a few millimeters of progress, 
but a deal is still far off, leaving mil-
lions of Americans in the lurch. Then 
they continue to push their $3 trillion 
wish list that even their own Demo-
cratic colleagues brush off as absurd. 
We have had variations on this theme 
daily for more than a week now. 
Yesterday, the Speaker of the House 
called their far-left proposal a ‘‘well- 
developed strategic plan,’’ but even 
Members of her own caucus know that 
is not true. 
Back when the Speaker’s wish list 
was rammed through the House, one 
Democratic Member came right out 
and said that the so-called Heroes Act 
‘‘isn’t a plan. It’s a wish list.’’ 
Another said that Members of her 
caucus had taken the bill as ‘‘an oppor-
tunity to make political statements 
. . . that goes far beyond pandemic re-
lief and has no chance at becoming 
law.’’ 
Others said it was ‘‘not focused’’ and 
‘‘partisan gamesmanship.’’ 
These are Democrats I am quoting. 
Even the Speaker’s own rank and file 
know it is comical to say your ‘‘stra-
tegic plan’’ for COVID–19 involves send-
ing taxpayer checks to people who are 
here illegally, paying people more not 
to work than essential workers earn by 
working, 
soil 
health 
programs—so- 
called 
‘‘environmental 
justice’’ 
grants—and a massive tax cut aimed 
directly at wealthy people in New York 
and California. 
That last point needs special atten-
tion. 
Now, in ordinary negotiations, Mem-
bers of Congress like to bring things 
home for their core supporters, but it 
is a little too on the nose for the 
Speaker from San Francisco and the 
Democratic leader from New York City 
to be holding up $1 trillion in emer-
gency aid for the entire country unless 
they get big tax breaks for millionaires 
in their hometowns. 
Economists across the political spec-
trum say this demand of theirs is a bad 
idea because 94 percent of the benefit 
would flow to people who make north 
of $200,000. 
In the words of one progressive econ-
omist, who ought to be on their side: 
This is not a good idea. . . . It would not 
help the economy heal and would not benefit 
the people who need help. 
Yet my friends in the Democratic 
leadership are not deterred. More than 
a week into these talks, they are still 
threatening to block any and all relief 
for struggling people unless big city 
penthouses get these tax cuts. The 
Democratic leader said just yesterday 
that he is still holding out for this. 
Now, this isn’t the only bad policy 
they are hung up on. The Speaker and 
the Democratic leader continue to in-
sist that Federal unemployment assist-
ance should pay people more not to 
work than the essential workers who 
have kept working. Let me say that 
again. The Democratic position has 
been that these millions of laid-off peo-
ple should get nothing unless they get 
a higher salary than the people who are 
still working. This isn’t just bad eco-
nomics if you are trying to reopen a 
country; it is also just simply unfair in 
the simplest terms. 
The Republicans want to keep pro-
viding some supplemental Federal un-
employment. We just don’t think it is 
remotely fair for the Federal Govern-
ment to tax essential workers who 
have kept working every day so Uncle 
Sam can pay their neighbors a higher 
salary to stay home. Let me say that 
again. We just don’t think it is re-
motely fair for the Federal Govern-
ment to tax essential workers who 
have kept working every day so Uncle 
Sam can pay their neighbors a higher 
salary to stay home. 
Outside of the Democratic leader and 
the Speaker of the House, even Demo-
crats concede it is a bit upside down to 
pay people more not to work. 
Last week, the House Democratic 
majority leader said: ‘‘It’s not $600 or 
bust.’’ 
Our colleague, the senior Senator 
from Maryland, has said: ‘‘We certainly 
understand we don’t want to have high-
er benefits than what someone can 
make working.’’ 
Just yesterday, the senior Senator 
from West Virginia stated plainly that 
Speaker PELOSI’s position was unten-
able. ‘‘I don’t think we’re going to stay 
at the $600.’’ 
Let’s bear in mind, even $200 would 
be eight times what the Democrats put 
in place with unified control of the 
government during the last crisis in 
2009. It is unthinkable they will hold 
every bit of relief hostage unless we 
land back at $600 and pay workers a 
bonus if they do not help to reopen our 
country. Maybe the Speaker and the 
Democratic leader will get the memo 
from their colleagues sometime soon. 
Then there is the Democrats’ demand 
for $1 trillion more to hand out to 
State and local governments even 
though they have only spent a fourth 
of the money we sent them back in 
March. 
Yesterday, I received an urgent letter 
from the city of Malibu, CA—and I 
promise I am not making this up—ask-
ing Congress for hundreds of billions of 
dollars for State and local governments 
because it has had to delay its ‘‘conver-
sion to an all-electric city fleet.’’ 
I guess that is an emergency in 
Malibu when they can’t keep buying 
brandnew electric cars as quickly as 
they would like. Well, this emergency 
is hitting most of America very dif-
ferently. 
My constituents in Kentucky have 
bigger problems. They need actual re-
lief to go straight to struggling fami-
lies, and, frankly, they needed it yes-
terday, not a $1 trillion slush fund for 
bureaucrats who haven’t spent what we 
sent them back in March. 
Those are just some of the fantasy 
items that are in the Democrats’ de-
mands. I haven’t even gotten to all of 
the important things they left out. 
Their bill costs three times as much as 
the Senate Republicans’ HEALS Act, 
but they skip over major, serious 
things that we took care of. 
The Democrats proposed fewer re-
sources than the Republicans for the 
fund to help schools reopen safely. The 
Democrats 
completely 
shortchanged 
the successful Collins-Rubio Paycheck 
Protection Program, wherein our bill 
would fund a whole second round. The 
Democrats have no real equivalent to 
our proposals to strengthen domestic 
supply chains for PPE and critical re-
sources, and they propose no legal pro-
tections at all for the doctors and 
nurses who have fought this unknown 
enemy or for the schools, universities, 
churches, and businesses that are try-
ing to reopen. Apparently, those soil 
health experiments and diversity ini-
tiatives didn’t leave enough room for 
the critical policies that would actu-
ally help the country. 
But, remember, our Democratic col-
leagues told us from the beginning 
their goal was never a targeted plan for 
COVID–19. 
In March, one of the Speaker’s top 
lieutenants said the Democrats should 
view this deadly disease and mass un-
employment as a ‘‘tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit our 
vision.’’ Speaker PELOSI herself called 
this crisis a ‘‘wonderful opportunity.’’ 
It is clear they view it that way be-
cause, while Americans are struggling, 
the Democratic leaders have moved 
about 1 inch in 8 days. 
For the sake of the millions and mil-
lions who need more help, let’s hope 
they decide to get serious soon.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
negotiations on the next round of 
COVID relief continued yesterday and 
will continue again today. Speaker 
PELOSI and I are making progress with 
the White House, but we remain far 
apart on a large number of issues. 
As I mentioned yesterday, the funda-
mental disagreement between our two 
parties is the scope and severity of the 
problem. This is the greatest economic 
crisis America has faced in 75 years and 
the greatest health crisis in 100. There 
must be a relief package commensu-
rate with the size of this historic chal-
lenge. A skinny package—a package 
that doesn’t solve so many of the prob-
lems that America faces—would hurt 
the American people, and we cannot 
have it. 
But our Republican friends are wed-
ded ideologically to the idea that gov-
ernment shouldn’t take forceful action; 
that we should leave the welfare of the 
American people to the whims of the 
private sector. It just doesn’t work like 
that, especially in a time of national 
emergency. The private sector cannot 
do it. 
While we have started to generate 
some forward momentum, we need our 
partners in the White House to go 
much further on a number of issues, let 
alone the Republican Senate, where 20 
or so Republicans, by the majority 
leader’s admission, don’t want to do 
anything. 
For example, the administration has 
finally come around to the view that 
we should extend the moratorium on 
evictions, but they continue to refuse 
to provide actual assistance to the 
renters themselves. What good does 
that do? We can prevent Americans 
from being kicked out of their apart-
ments for another few months, but if 
they can’t pay the rent, they will be 
right back at square one when the mor-
atorium expires, with even more un-
paid bills piled up. Extending the mor-
atorium on evictions solves only one- 
half of the problem. 
Republicans continue to stonewall 
support for State, local, and Tribal 
governments, which have already shed 
more than a million public service jobs 
this year and will continue to lay off 
teachers, firefighters, and more if Con-
gress does nothing. 
In the early days of the crisis, State 
and local governments fought this dis-
ease basically on their own. The Trump 
administration couldn’t be bothered to 
coordinate a national response or sup-
ply them with the necessary resources. 
Now Leader MCCONNELL and others on 
the Republican side say our States 
should just go bankrupt. They put zero 
into their proposal for State and local 
and would like Republican Senators to 
go home and tell their Governors, tell 
their mayors, and tell their county ex-
ecutives: We want zero for you. That is 
what our leader is for. Well, it is not 
acceptable. 
On unemployment insurance, a few 
Senate Republicans have belatedly ac-
cepted the view we should extend the 
enhanced benefit of $600 for an ex-
tended period of time, as Democrats 
have proposed and voted for in the 
House. Of course, many Senate Repub-
licans—most Senate Republicans—still 
object to that, but at least a few have 
come around. At the moment, however, 
the White House is not there, and we 
are not going to strike a deal unless we 
extend the unemployment benefits, 
which have kept nearly 12 million 
Americans out of poverty. 
The same goes for healthcare, test-
ing, and tracing. How is it that every-
one in the White House can get tested, 
everyone in the NFL can get tested, 
but average Americans still cannot ac-
cess tests easily or get results back 
fast enough? More than 7 months into 
the crisis, this administration does not 
have a plan or adequate capacity for 
testing and contact tracing. It is a 
shocking failure on the part of the 
Trump administration and the Repub-
lican Senators. 
So Democrats are insisting that we 
provide enough resources to finally 
slow the spread and defeat this dis-
ease—the single most important thing 
to our recovery. The American people 
know that the Trump administration 
and their Republican adherents in the 
Senate are to blame for this huge fail-
ure in testing and tracing. They de-
mand we act and act fully now, not 
with some half-baked, poorly funded 
plan that won’t do the job, which is 
where the administration seems to be 
at right now. 
Democrats are insisting that every 
American should be able to vote this 
November safely and confidently in- 
person or by mail. COVID has affected 
how we will vote. Many more will vote 
by mail. There will be a need for poll-
ing places—maybe more of them—and a 
need to space people out as they vote. 
We are not going to stop fighting until 
State election systems and the post of-
fice, which is part of getting the mail 
there on time, get the resources they 
need. 
Elections are a wellspring of our de-
mocracy, and the only answer as to 
why neither the Republicans in the 
Senate nor the White House wants to 
do anything about it is they fear a free 
and fair election. That is inimicable to 
the core of this Republic. 
We are going to keep fighting. There 
have been alarming reports about re-
cent failures at the post office, about 
residents in Michigan and Pennsyl-
vania not getting their medicines or 
their paychecks for 3 weeks or more. 
The Postal Service is vital—and not 
just for elections but every single day. 
The new Postmaster, Mr. DeJoy, a 
big donor to President Trump—which 
many believe is his main qualification 
for being chosen—has enacted new 
guidelines in the post office that ex-
perts say will cause severe delays in 
mail delivery. Then he refused for 
weeks to even hold a phone call with 
Democrats, including myself, about 
this issue. I called three times. Mr. 
DeJoy evidently didn’t have the time 
to call back when I was so concerned 
about mail delivery in New York and 
the rest of the country. So we have in-
sisted to Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mead-
ows on meeting with Mr. DeJoy, which 
will take place later today. 
We need to resolve the problems at 
the post office—this lack of funding 
and the new regulations that get in the 
way of the timely delivery of the mail. 
We must resolve those issues in a way 
that allows mail to be delivered on 
time for the election and for the neces-
sities that people need. 
Each and every one of these issues is 
critical, and there are many more. We 
need answers and movement on all of 
them, not just on one or two, but some 
of our Republican friends seem content 
to pass a bill—any bill—so they can 
check the box and go home. We cannot 
do that. We cannot agree to an inad-
equate bill and then go home while the 
virus continues to spread, the economy 
continues to deteriorate, and the coun-
try gets worse. So we are going to keep 
slogging through, step by step, inch by 
inch, until we achieve the caliber, the 
extent, the depth and breadth of the 
legislation that the American people 
need, deserve, and want. 
In stark contrast, the Republican 
leader has decided that he would rather 
lob partisan pot shots from the Senate 
floor each morning rather than join in 
productive negotiations. It is difficult 
to listen to the Republican leader spin 
such a malicious fiction about why 
Congress has yet to pass another round 
of relief when he can’t even sit in the 
room with us and negotiate, when he 
can’t even create a modicum of unity 
in his disturbingly divided caucus. 
For 3 months, Leader MCCONNELL 
and Senate Republicans put the Senate 
on 
pause 
when 
it 
came 
to 
the 
coronavirus. As COVID threats spread 
throughout the South and West, as 
States hit daily records for new cases 
and hospitalizations, as 50 million 
Americans filed for unemployment, the 
Senate Republican majority merely 
hummed along as if it were living in a 
different universe. 
Leader MCCONNELL
scheduled con-
firmation votes on rightwing judges. 
The chairman of Judiciary and Home-
land Security held hearings on the 
President’s wild conspiracy theories 
about the 2016 election and conducted 
desperate fishing expeditions, hoping 
to dig up dirt on the family of the 
President’s political rivals. When the 
Republican majority did put legisla-
tion on the floor, it wasn’t even re-
motely related to COVID. 
All through that time, Democrats 
came to the floor to practically beg our

August 5, 2020 
colleagues to consider COVID relief 
legislation. We asked consent to pass 
urgent relief no fewer than 15 times, 
and every single time, Republicans 
blocked our requests. 
Once Senate Republicans finally de-
cided to write a bill, it was the legisla-
tive equivalent of a dumpster fire. Re-
publicans bickered among themselves 
for over a week and a half before fi-
nally giving up. They didn’t even re-
lease a coherent bill; just a series of 
nibbling proposals, rife with corporate 
giveaways and K Street carve-outs. Re-
publicans proposed a tax break for 
three-martini lunches but no food as-
sistance for hungry kids; $2 billion to 
build an FBI building to boost the 
value of the Trump hotel but not a 
dime to help Americans afford their 
rent. 
Then, to top it all off, almost as soon 
as the Republican plan on COVID was 
released, it became clear that even 
Senate Republicans didn’t support it. 
President Trump called it ‘‘semi-irrele-
vant.’’ 
‘‘Semi-irrelevant’’ 
is 
what 
President Trump called the Republican 
proposals. 
Leader MCCONNELL basically gave up 
and left Democrats and the White 
House to negotiate the next bill. So it 
strains reason for Leader MCCONNELL 
to criticize those of us who are actu-
ally engaged in negotiations while he is 
intentionally staying out of it. His 
‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ rhetoric—flip-
ping everything on its head and accus-
ing the other side of the sins that 
Leader MCCONNELL, in fact, is commit-
ting—is extremely counterproductive. 
Since Senate Republicans clearly 
cannot reach a consensus, any agree-
ment is going to require a lot of Demo-
cratic votes. Suffice it to say, the Re-
publican leader’s rhetoric and positions 
are not helpful in that regard. 
While Republican leadership con-
tinues to sit on the sidelines, Demo-
crats are in the room working hard. 
That is what the American people ex-
pect of us. They want to see us working 
to get something done in this time of 
extraordinary challenge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from New York 
and thank him for the negotiations he 
has engaged in. 
It is nothing short of amazing that 
the Republican leader of the U.S. Sen-
ate comes to the floor of the Senate 
every morning and criticizes Senator 
SCHUMER and Speaker PELOSI, who are 
sitting in a room day after day after 
day, trying to hammer out an agree-
ment to help America in this time of 
need, while there are two empty chairs 
at that table. KEVIN MCCARTHY, the 
House Republican leader, does not at-
tend the meetings, and sadly, the Re-
publican leader of the Senate is also 
boycotting these meetings. I can’t re-
member a time when this has occurred, 
ever—no time in history when there 
was a critical national decision to be 
hammered out between the parties and 
the leaders of the Republican Party in 
Congress refused to attend the meet-
ings. 
Senator MCCONNELL
gives polished 
speeches on the floor criticizing Sen-
ator SCHUMER
and Speaker PELOSI. 
They should be polished—he has time 
to practice them all day instead of 
going into the negotiations that can 
actually make a difference in the fu-
ture of America. 
Americans are genuinely concerned, 
and they should be. We face a national 
health emergency with this pandemic, 
sadly, where the infections are spiking 
across America. It is still amazing to 
consider two numbers: the number 5— 
the United States has about 5 percent 
of the world’s population; and the num-
ber 25—the United States has gen-
erated 25 percent of the COVID–19 in-
fections in the world. Five percent of 
the population and 25 percent of the re-
ported COVID infections in the world. 
How did we reach this point where 
this great developed, civilized, and 
strong Nation has been brought to its 
knees by this pandemic? We have 
reached this point by lack of leader-
ship. The American people know that 
there have been leadership failures at 
the top. They know this President re-
fuses to listen to experts. If the experts 
say something he doesn’t like to hear, 
he banishes them, as Dr. Fauci has 
found. 
We also know that this President is 
downplaying the threat that sadly is 
taking American lives in the thousands 
by the day. Just yesterday or the day 
before, he branded this pandemic as all 
but over. Really? There is hardly any-
one in America who would agree with 
that statement—certainly no one who 
is paying any attention to the sad re-
alities facing families. 
This President has failed to tell the 
truth. He has been engaged in medical 
quackery. 
This 
hydroxychloroquine 
that he clings to has been discredited 
by the sources that test it. It just isn’t 
an answer. The President should know 
better. For goodness’ sake, he doesn’t 
have the competence to make a med-
ical judgment along those lines, but 
that won’t stop him. 
But many people across America are 
just fed up with it, whether it is Lysol 
cocktails 
or 
ultraviolet 
insertions. 
Lord only knows what he will come up 
with next. At a time when people are 
literally sick and dying, when our 
healthcare heroes are risking their 
lives every day, this President goes off 
on these flights of medical fantasy, and 
the American people are fed up with it. 
This President has failed to take the 
action that America desperately needs. 
We cannot reopen this economy, we 
cannot 
consider 
reopening 
schools 
until we dramatically invest in better, 
quicker testing. That is a reality. 
As Senator SCHUMER
said earlier, 
Americans wonder how the President 
manages to test everyone who crosses 
the threshold of the White House over 
and over, every single day, and how 
Major League Baseball and the Na-
tional Football League can get test re-
sults in a matter of hours while Ameri-
cans are standing in line and waiting 
for results that are largely irrelevant 
when they are delivered 5 or 6 days 
after the test. What good is a test if it 
tells you that you are safe 6 days ago, 
when you want to see your grand-
children today? That is the reality of 
testing in America. 
And what has this President done 
about it? He has made statement after 
statement that there are all the tests 
we could possibly want available to 
every American. We know better. All 
across America, we know better. Test-
ing has improved and increased, but it 
is not where we need it. That should be 
the highest priority of this administra-
tion, but they failed when it came to 
providing personal protective equip-
ment, and they failed when it comes to 
providing testing. 
The biggest failure is the attitude of 
the Senate Republican leader and the 
President when it comes to the crises 
America faces—first, the coronavirus 
crisis and, second, the economic crisis. 
The biggest tragedy is the fact that 
they believe we should do little or 
nothing—little or nothing when we are 
facing some the greatest challenges of 
our time, some of the greatest chal-
lenges in American history. The Amer-
ican people expects us to take it seri-
ously and to aggressively go after this 
coronavirus and its spread and aggres-
sively help this economy back to its 
feet. 
We have come up with a plan, which 
Senator MCCONNELL has come to the 
floor and mocked every single day. It 
passed the House of Representatives 11 
weeks ago. Eleven weeks ago, Speaker 
PELOSI passed it and sent it to the Sen-
ate. What has happened in that 11-week 
period? 
Speech 
after 
speech 
after 
speech, deriding the efforts of the 
House of Representatives and, literally, 
nothing on the other side to show for 
it. 
Finally, last week, they 
started 
trickling out a few ideas here and 
there, and they weren’t very good. 
They refused to participate, will not 
even attend the negotiation sessions 
with the White House, and come to the 
floor each day and mock and criticize 
Democratic efforts to deal with the 
issues before us. 
As far as a recovery is concerned, it 
is essential that we dedicate ourselves 
to it, but, first, coronavirus—first, get 
the infections under control and save 
the lives of those who have already 
been infected. That is the first thing 
that needs to be done. 
The Republican approach is too little 
and too late. We have come up with a 
$3 trillion plan. They have come up 
with a $1 trillion plan and said: We 
may not even spend that much. 
Particularly troublesome for me is 
this attitude toward the unemploy-
ment 
compensation 
being 
paid 
to 
Americans. I couldn’t believe the Sen-
ator from Kentucky when he came to

the floor today and tried to pit our 
healthcare heroes against the unem-
ployed, saying: They are going to work 
every day. Why should we give any 
money to those who don’t go to work 
every day? 
Really? We have four unemployed 
Americans—four unemployed Ameri-
cans—for every single job opening. I 
don’t believe the doctors, nurses, and 
medical professionals who are fighting 
COVID every single day resent those 
who are unemployed. I think they un-
derstand full well the devastation of 
this pandemic, not only on the individ-
uals they treat but on the economy at 
large. 
When it comes to these healthcare 
heroes, the Democrats have stepped up 
and called for hazard pay. Will the Re-
publicans join us? We think these 
healthcare heroes deserve it—that and 
more, our gratitude and more, for all 
they have given to the United States. 
Let me say a word about those who 
are receiving unemployment benefits. I 
met with five of them in Chicago last 
week, heard their stories, asked them a 
few questions, and learned a little bit 
about their lives. I wasn’t surprised at 
the hardship they face. Many of them 
have been out of work for 4 or 5 months 
already. It is no surprise that almost 
half of the people out of work have ex-
hausted all of their savings at this 
point, even with unemployment bene-
fits. 
You ask those who are unemployed: 
Well, what do you do with these checks 
that are sent to you each week? 
It is pretty obvious to them what you 
do with it. You pay the mortgage, if 
you have one. You pay the rent, the car 
payment, so it is not repossessed and 
taken away from you. You try to keep 
food on the table. You try to keep the 
people issuing the credit cards at bay. 
These are the basics that people face 
every single day. But the Republicans 
don’t seem to get that. They don’t un-
derstand it because they don’t get to 
know these people or even ask them 
what life is like. They are not on any 
bed of roses with $600 a week when you 
consider the debts they face, when you 
consider the expenses they face, and 
you consider the fact that many of 
them are struggling to pay for their 
own health insurance at this point. A 
family trying to pick up the cost of 
their health insurance, that their em-
ployer once provided half of, finds 
themselves spending $1,400 to $1,700 a 
month on that alone. That is the re-
ality. 
For the record, of those who have re-
turned to work in America, we are 
grateful that they are back to work. 
We are happy that they are back to 
work. Seventy percent of them were 
making more money on unemployment 
than they made returning to work. 
Well, why would they do that? Because 
they are not lazy people. They are peo-
ple who take pride in work, believe 
there is dignity with work, and are pre-
pared to return even if they made more 
on unemployment. They know that un-
employment is a temporary help. They 
want to get back to work, a place 
where they can prove their worth as in-
dividuals and feel some satisfaction 
that they are going to work and doing 
their best. That is part of the reality. 
f 
REOPENING SCHOOLS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me also address for a moment this 
issue of reopening of schools. There is a 
debate raging across the country right 
now about what this autumn will look 
like for our Nation’s schools, the 
schoolchildren, teachers, and school 
staff. You have heard the President, 
who has literally threatened those who 
don’t reopen their schools that they 
may lose Federal funding if they don’t 
reopen schools. What is that funding 
spent for? Special education, school 
lunches, help for kids in poor schools. 
The message has been reiterated by 
the loyal Education Secretary, Betsy 
DeVos. She, too, has joined in the 
threats of schools that don’t reopen. 
Now the Republicans in the Senate 
have taken that threat and turned it 
into legislation with their proposal in 
the next relief package. 
Let me be really clear. There is a 
concern 
about 
empty 
classrooms. 
Those who study childhood behavior 
worry that lack of socialization takes 
its toll on childhood development. 
Teachers are often sentinels for evi-
dence of child abuse, which now may be 
going 
unreported. 
Remote 
learning 
works well for some but not for others. 
But that is not the concern of this 
President. He wants schools back so he 
that can claim some kind of false vic-
tory over the coronavirus. 
Last week, I led 24 of my colleagues 
in writing to the majority leader and 
the Democratic leader opposing put-
ting children and teachers in any dan-
ger by conditioning funding of schools 
reopening in person. 
Recently, I had the opportunity to 
visit the Little Village Academy in 
Chicago 
with 
the 
Chicago 
Public 
Schools chief, Janice Jackson. Some 
wonderful people are there each day 
passing out lunches to the kids in the 
neighborhood who come around the 
school. They haven’t reopened for 
classes. They hope they will, but that 
decision is still to be made. 
I can tell you that in Chicago and 
around my home State of Illinois, 
school boards, administrators, teach-
ers, parents, and others are facing 
these decisions honestly. They have to 
provide a safe and effective learning 
environment 
for 
students 
and 
for 
teachers, whether that be in person, in 
school, or at home. 
Unlike President Trump, who is nice-
ly insulated in the bubble of the White 
House with the multiple daily COVID– 
19 tests for everyone who just might 
come in contact with him, these edu-
cation professionals in my home State 
of Illinois have to answer directly to 
the families in their communities. It is 
a decision that local officials are best 
suited to make without intimidation or 
threats from Washington, DC. 
But Washington does have a role to 
play. The best thing we can do to help 
local school districts through this dif-
ficult fall and beyond is to provide the 
Federal assistance and support they 
need to ensure the path they choose is 
one that keeps students and staff safe 
while allowing the learning and devel-
opment to continue effectively. 
It is why, as we negotiate a fourth 
coronavirus response package, I will be 
pushing 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
Coronavirus Childcare and Education 
Relief Act, being led in the Senate by 
Senator PATTY MURRAY of Washington. 
In addition to supporting childcare, 
early education, and higher education, 
the bill provides $175 billion to elemen-
tary and secondary schools to help 
meet technology, cleaning, staffing, 
and other needs of schools. It provides 
funds to school districts based on their 
share of low-income children. In that 
way, it is similar to the CARES Act, 
which brought more than $200 million 
to the Chicago Public Schools and a 
total of $512 million across our State of 
Illinois. Compare that $175 billion to 
the $70 billion being offered on the Re-
publican side—another classic example. 
We believe this is a serious national 
issue, when it comes to education. The 
Republicans do not. The amount of 
money that they are proposing is a 
fraction of what we offer, and much of 
it is conditioned on the schools actu-
ally reopening in person, regardless of 
what is the safest thing for the schools, 
the teachers, and the students in any 
given area. 
Congress shouldn’t put State and 
local officials in the position of choos-
ing between desperately needed Fed-
eral assistance and the safety of stu-
dents and the school personnel. Con-
gress should not incentivize schools to 
reopen in person prematurely or penal-
ize those where the public health situa-
tion makes it dangerous. 
The argument from the administra-
tion seems to go: ‘‘Well, if schools 
don’t reopen, they either don’t deserve 
or don’t need any help.’’ That is just 
not the case. Even schools that are not 
able to reopen in person need assist-
ance ensuring their students, espe-
cially those from low-income families, 
have the ability to participate in re-
mote learning. They need help keeping 
staff on payroll, preparing the build-
ings so they can return in person in the 
future, and addressing any number of 
difficulties this pandemic has created. 
For school buses, if there is going to be 
social distancing of the kids on the 
buses, will there be a need for addi-
tional buses and busdrivers? 
In addition to funding, the Federal 
Government should also ensure that 
schools have science-based guidance to 
support safely opening, free from polit-
ical influence and Presidential quack-
ery. 
They also need the flexibility to con-
tinue serving critical meals to our stu-
dents, regardless of what the school 
year looks like this fall.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4888 
August 5, 2020 
Chicago Public Schools have done an 
incredible job providing 18 million 
meals since March. We need to ensure 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
provides the range of alternative op-
tions needed to make sure that no kid 
in America goes hungry. 
Schools in Chicago and around our 
State don’t need any more tweets or 
self-congratulatory 
briefings, 
Mr. 
President. They need Federal resources 
and guidance based on the best science 
our government has to offer. That is 
why I am fighting for this relief pack-
age to be at a level to meet the chal-
lenge we face across America. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me close by saying this. The majority 
leader comes to the floor regularly and 
talks about special interests. Perhaps 
he can explain to us why the Repub-
lican proposal for relief for the COVID– 
19 virus includes a $2 billion allocation 
for a new FBI building across the 
street from the Trump hotel. Perhaps 
he can explain the $30 billion wish list 
from the Department of Defense, try-
ing to make up for cuts that were made 
when the President raided their ac-
counts to build his almighty wall in 
the southern border. Perhaps the ma-
jority leader can explain to us the li-
ability immunity which is being pro-
posed by the Republican side as a ‘‘red-
line, take it or leave it, we will walk 
away if you don’t like it’’ approach. 
It would be one thing if the Repub-
lican leader were in the room, actually 
negotiating, but he just makes a red-
line and walks away. That redline is a 
subsidy to the largest corporations in 
America, giving them liability immu-
nity when it comes to possible court 
suits. 
Wouldn’t we want a standard to 
make sure that all businesses and 
every individual or group or business is 
doing its best to keep America safe? 
When we say, don’t worry about any li-
ability in court if you ignore the public 
health reality, that is no guarantee 
that it is going to be a safe environ-
ment for America when we reopen this 
economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last 
week Senate Republicans did introduce 
a new coronavirus relief bill called the 
Health, Economic Assistance, Liability 
Protection, and Schools Act. This bill 
is a $1 trillion piece of legislation fo-
cused on getting Americans back to 
work, getting kids and college students 
back 
to 
school, 
and 
providing 
healthcare resources to help defeat the 
virus. As the title says—the Health, 
Economic Assistance, Liability Protec-
tion, and Schools Act—it does have li-
ability protections in there. 
I just listened to the Senator from Il-
linois attack the idea of including 
those types of protections in the legis-
lation, but I think it is really impor-
tant to point out that those type of 
protections are critical if we are going 
to get the economy reopened again. 
Businesses that are doing all the 
right things—following the CDC guide-
lines, adhering to all the laws, all the 
guidelines and restrictions that are out 
there—shouldn’t have to worry about 
lawyering up and spending thousands 
and, in some cases, millions of dollars 
to try and defend themselves against 
frivolous lawsuits, which are being 
filed as we speak by the thousands. 
The implication given by the Senator 
from Illinois that somehow this is all 
about big corporations or big busi-
nesses is just not consistent with the 
facts on the ground. In fact, I had a 
conversation 2 days ago with the 
school administrators in my State of 
South Dakota, all of whom are very in-
terested in getting their schools opened 
up and getting kids back in school, 
which, again, is one of the priorities of 
our legislation and should be, I think, 
one of the priorities of the country as 
we head into the fall. 
One of their big issues was ensuring 
that they had protections against li-
ability—a liability shield, if you will, 
not 
against 
gross 
negligence, 
not 
against intentional misconduct—those 
types of things would not be covered— 
but protections if, in fact, they are 
doing all the right things, consistent 
with the guidelines, following the rules 
that have been put in place, that they 
should have at least some protections. 
That is going to be true not just of 
schools and small businesses, but it is 
also going to be true of healthcare pro-
viders. 
We 
have 
people 
on 
the 
frontlines who are sacrificing every 
day to try and get people better, to 
heal those who have contracted the 
virus, and also protect those who are 
on the frontlines from getting it. They, 
too, are going to need those very types 
of protections that are called for in our 
legislation. 
So this is not something that was put 
in there on a whim just because we 
knew that the Democrats wouldn’t like 
it. It was put in there because of feed-
back we received from States, local 
governments, 
school 
districts, 
healthcare providers, hospitals, nurs-
ing homes, and, yes, some small busi-
nesses, all of whom are going to be es-
sential if we are going to get the econ-
omy up and going again and get people 
back to work, kids back to school, and 
Americans back on their feet. 
So it is an essential part of the legis-
lation, one which, so far, the Demo-
crats have demonstrated no interest in 
including and, frankly, no interest in 
even having a conversation about, 
which is unfortunate because it is a 
critical element, feature, of any bill 
that we should be working on right 
now to provide coronavirus relief. 
When we introduced this bill, we 
knew this version wouldn’t be the final 
draft. I think everybody conceded that. 
We knew we would need to negotiate 
with our Democratic colleagues just 
like we did with the CARES Act, which 
was our largest coronavirus relief bill, 
back in March. 
Back in March, the model that was 
used was having committee chairmen 
and ranking members get together in 
compromise and work out differences 
and end up with a strong, bipartisan 
bill. Was it a perfect bill? Well, no, of 
course not. No bill is. Did everyone get 
everything that he or she wanted? No, 
but it was a strong, bipartisan bill that 
was praised by Democrats and Repub-
licans alike—in fact, reflected by the 
unanimous vote. 
I would like to say that we are en-
gaging in those same types of negotia-
tions right now, but unfortunately I 
can’t say that. I can’t say, in fact, 
what is happening right now is even ne-
gotiations. Negotiations involve both 
sides being willing to give something 
up to compromise and to try and move 
toward a solution. While Republicans 
are willing to make compromises to 
ensure that we can deliver another 
coronavirus relief bill to the American 
people, Democrats apparently aren’t 
willing to make any. 
Back in May, House Democrats pro-
posed and passed a massive $3.4 trillion 
piece of legislation that they called a 
coronavirus relief bill. Subsequently, it 
has been endorsed by Senate Demo-
crats who have gone so far as to offer 
up unanimous consent requests here on 
the Senate floor to adopt the House- 
passed bill. In reality, that House- 
passed bill, $3.4 trillion bill, was a 
lengthy liberal wish list which even 
Members of the Democrats’ own party 
dismissed as dead on arrival. In fact, 
Democrats had some work to do to per-
suade Members of their own caucus in 
the House to vote for the bill. 
As POLITICO put it at the time: ‘‘As 
of late Thursday evening, the House 
Democratic leadership was engaged in 
what a few senior aides and lawmakers 
described as the most difficult arm- 
twisting of the entire Congress: con-
vincing their rank and file to vote for 
a $3 trillion stimulus bill that will 
never become law.’’ 
That is from POLITICO. The House 
bill includes various ‘‘coronavirus pri-
orities’’ like funding for diversity and 
inclusion studies in the marijuana in-
dustry, tax cuts for blue-State million-
aires, federalizing elections. Those are 
just a few of the items that were in-
cluded in the House-passed bill that it 
is very hard to argue have anything to 
do with defeating the coronavirus. In 
fact, the House bill mentions the word 
‘‘cannabis’’ more often than it men-
tions the word ‘‘job,’’ which tells you 
all you need to know about the serious-
ness of that proposal. 
Despite all that, Democratic leaders 
have taken the House bill as their 
starting and, yes, their ending point 
for negotiations. They are insisting 
that Republicans sign off on pretty 
much everything in their bill, from the 
tax cuts for wealthy Americans to 
major changes in election law. And

they are not budging on the pricetag 
either. 
As I said, Republicans have proposed 
a $1 trillion piece of legislation, and I 
can tell you—from being a Member of 
the Republican conference and the dis-
cussions that we have—what a stretch 
it is for a lot of Republicans, who al-
ready 
have 
voted 
for 
multiple 
coronavirus relief bills to the pricetag 
of about $3 trillion so far, to do another 
trillion dollars, knowing that every 
one of those dollars is a borrowed dol-
lar, every one of those dollars is going 
on a Federal debt which is already up-
ward of $25 billion and will ultimately 
have to be paid back by our children 
and grandchildren. 
Well, that said, the trillion-dollar 
legislation that was put forward by Re-
publicans is nowhere close to the 
pricetag for the Democrats’ bill, which 
is $3.4 trillion, as I said. Now, I think 
even an elementary school student 
would realize that compromise lies 
somewhere between those two num-
bers, more than, perhaps, the Repub-
licans’ bill and less than the Demo-
crats’ bill, but apparently that is not 
something Democrats are willing to en-
tertain. 
A 
senior 
correspondent 
for 
CNN 
talked to Speaker PELOSI yesterday, 
who claimed she wanted to reach 
agreement on a bill this week. The cor-
respondent asked the Speaker what 
pricetag she was willing to agree to. 
Her answer: $3.4 trillion. In other 
words, after more than a week of nego-
tiations, the Speaker of the House 
hasn’t budged from her original posi-
tion. She hasn’t budged, nor have the 
Senate Democrats, who every time 
something has come up on our side to 
try and address this crisis have an-
swered with: Well, let’s just pass the 
Heroes Act of the House, the $3.4 tril-
lion boondoggle. 
Well, that is not a compromise. That 
is not a negotiation. And if we emerge 
from 
this 
process 
without 
a 
coronavirus relief bill, the responsi-
bility rests squarely on the shoulders 
of the Democratic leadership. 
Let’s suppose, for a moment, that Re-
publican negotiators agreed to every 
single thing that Democrats are insist-
ing on: tax cuts for millionaires, diver-
sity studies for the marijuana indus-
try, a trillion-dollar pot of money for 
States, which, I might add, haven’t 
even 
come 
close 
to 
spending 
the 
coronavirus money the government has 
already given them. Let’s suppose Re-
publican negotiators agreed to every-
thing. What would happen then? 
Well, the bill would never pass the 
Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 
votes to pass a bill, and there simply 
aren’t 60 votes in the Senate for the 
Democrats’ liberal fantasies. In fact, it 
would be lovely if, as Democrats seem 
to think, the government drew its 
funding from a magical pot of gold that 
never runs out, but it doesn’t. Every 
dollar of the coronavirus relief that we 
already provided has been borrowed 
money, which continues to drive up our 
national debt. Now, arguably, it was 
money that needed to be borrowed, but 
there has to be a limit. 
The higher we drive our national 
debt, the greater the danger to the 
health of our economy. Democrats may 
be fine with jeopardizing our economic 
health to pay for diversity studies in 
the marijuana industry, but I can tell 
you the Republicans are not. Repub-
licans know we are going to have to 
borrow some additional money to meet 
the demands of the coronavirus crisis— 
and we have offered legislation to do 
just that—but we are not going to fur-
ther endanger our already battered 
economy by signing off on every unnec-
essary spending item on the Demo-
crats’ liberal fantasy list. 
Now, are Republicans going to have 
to agree to some of the things that we 
are not crazy about? Of course we are. 
But Democrats are going to have to ac-
cept that they can’t dictate every word 
of the bill. 
The bill which passed the House, I 
might add, was 1,800 pages long. The 
bill that we have proposed in the Sen-
ate is 165 pages. The ball is in the 
Democrats’ court. Republicans want to 
pass a coronavirus relief bill, and we 
are ready to negotiate. The Democrats 
are going to have to decide they want 
to come to the table. 
‘‘Our way or the highway’’ is not a 
negotiating position, and if Democrats 
continue to insist on getting every-
thing that they want, they are going to 
be responsible for Congress’s failure to 
deliver additional relief. I hope—I real-
ly hope the Democratic leadership will 
remember what it means to negotiate 
and that it will work with Republicans 
to arrive at a compromise bill that can 
make it through both Houses of Con-
gress and actually become law.

FREE SPEECH 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, ‘‘Free-
dom is the freedom to say that two 
plus two makes four. If that is granted, 
all else follows’’—so wrote novelist 
George Orwell. 
In the late 1980s, I traveled to the 
former Soviet Union as part of a youth 
soccer program. Now, decades have 
passed since that trip, of course, but 
the memories to me are still vivid. The 
shelves were barren. Citizens drank 
from communal water fountains. The 
items most in demand and hardest to 
find were American items: blue jeans— 
Levi Strauss—and bubble gum. 
Of course, those weren’t the only 
things common in Indiana that were 
contraband behind the Iron Curtain. 
For decades, news, literature, art, or 
entertainment that was not broadcast 
or approved by the state was scarce 
and available only by bootleg. 
The monuments towering over Rus-
sia were built to honor those who con-
trolled it, the same men who regularly 
erased parts of Russia’s history to suit 
their own political purposes, not to 
serve others. 
This was a society where ideas and 
dialogue existed only underground, 
where watching American movies was 
a jailable offense, where free thinkers 
weren’t found in newspapers or air-
waves but locked away in labor camps, 
where information protected the State 
instead of empowering the individuals, 
where history was constantly purged 
and revised. 
By the time I visited, though, Soviet 
leadership, in self-preservation mode, 
had gradually allowed citizens access 
to information and media as new tech-
nologies emerged. It was only a ray of 
sunlight through a very small crack, 
but through it, people all across the 
former Soviet Union and the Eastern 
Bloc could finally see and hear what 
had long been hidden from them: jazz, 
rock ‘n’ roll, Star Wars, Chuck Norris, 
Dr. Zhivago, and Robinson Crusoe. His-
tory once erased was restored. The 
truth of Stalin’s murders was revealed. 
Inevitably, the fatal conceit of a cen-
trally planned Communist economy 
was exposed, and large numbers of Rus-
sians realized just how poorly their 
quality of life compared to the free, 
Western alternative. They were even 
permitted rights to express dissatisfac-
tion with their circumstances. 
A totalitarian regime’s greatest ally 
is darkness and silence. Keeping a peo-
ple in the dark is the surest way to 
guarantee they never demand their 
God-given rights. But just a trickle of 
information, just a hint of truth, a 
small offering of differing perspectives, 
and a touch of freedom of expression 
helped lead to the Soviet Union’s de-
mise—‘‘the freedom to say that two 
plus two make four.’’ 
Free people become and stay free 
through open dialogue because of the 
free 
exchange 
of 
information 
and 
ideas—even ones we disagree with; be-
cause of patience with perspectives 
that are not our own; because we study 
our history, celebrate its highs, and 
learn from its lows. 
That is why—that is why—it was 
painful to read recently that over 60 
percent of Americans are now scared to 
admit their beliefs or air their opinions 
for fear of offending others and the 
consequences that will come with it. It 
is painful to learn but easy to under-
stand. 
This is the logical reaction when 
Americans are regularly canceled, as 
we say today, for things said or written 
decades ago, with no chance of grace or 
allowance for growth. It is not just 
people who are being canceled. It is 
words. It is music. Classrooms and li-
braries 
are 
banning 
‘‘Huckleberry 
Finn’’ and ‘‘To Kill A Mockingbird’’ 
rather than encouraging students to 
examine or understand their authors’ 
words and messages. ‘‘Hamilton’’ is 
falling from grace now for the ‘‘sin’’ of 
acknowledging America was created in 
1776. Whole parts of our American 
story are being wiped away. 
Communities have a right to lawfully 
determine who and what adorns their

squares and streets, but that is a world 
away from toppling statues of George 
Washington and U.S. Grant in the same 
manner those of Lenin and Stalin were 
once removed at the end of the Cold 
War. 
Our entertainment industry is get-
ting in on the act too. American mov-
ies once inspired freedom seekers. 
Today, they are self-censored to ap-
pease another totalitarian regime in 
Beijing. 
America is a good nation. Those who 
call it home are decent and kind. We 
are not perfect, but our imperfections 
are not irredeemable. 
The year 2020 has made it clear, 
though, that much work remains in the 
task of building a more perfect union. 
That effort is ongoing. Every genera-
tion since our founding has worked to-
ward it. Every generation has made 
hard-earned progress, and our own 
work to create a more just future will 
be no less difficult—certainly more so 
than knocking down bronze and marble 
men or waging war on books or on each 
other across social media. 
Every time our Nation has moved 
closer to better realizing the promise 
at the heart of our Declaration of Inde-
pendence ‘‘that all men are created 
equal . . . endowed by their Creator 
with certain inalienable Rights,’’ it has 
been because the Founders dared to 
dream that was possible and left us the 
means to do so: the freedom to raise 
our voices and state our opinions, to 
disagree and respectfully debate; the 
gift of free inquiry; the right to chal-
lenge our country on toward what Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., memorably called 
its noble dream through words, music, 
art, or expression—all free from censor-
ship and recrimination. 
These 
liberties—unparalleled 
in 
human history—were won, preserved, 
and handed down to us by many of 
those whose memorials are falling. Out 
of gratitude, we must remember the 
men and women who came before us. 
We must see their faults but not lose 
sight of their virtues and aspire to the 
high ideals they set for us, even if they 
often fell short of realizing them. What 
will we have without these freedoms, 
without memory and understanding of 
our 
past? 
Desolate 
public 
spaces, 
empty bookshelves, silenced citizens 
with nothing to strive for other than 
self-preservation. But with these free-
doms and inspired by our history, valu-
able debate and dialogue will flourish; 
daring ideas will be welcome; and great 
ideas will live. And the work we are 
in—the work of building a more perfect 
union and a freer and fairer nation— 
will be possible. Let this be the path we 
choose. 
It would be natural to close with a 
quote by one of our several generations 
of Founding Fathers: Washington, Lin-
coln, King. But today I feel it is more 
appropriate to remember another na-
tion’s founder and a good American 
friend—a man who lived behind the 
Iron Curtain and knew well the dangers 
of censorship and the power of free ex-
pression. As a playwright and a musi-
cian, he suffered under censorship. As a 
public leader, he helped his nation gain 
the power of free expression. It was ex-
actly 30 years ago today that Vaclav 
Havel, then the President of Czecho-
slovakia, spoke in this building. ‘‘You 
have thousands of problems of all 
kinds, as other countries do,’’ he ob-
served of America. ‘‘But you have one 
great advantage,’’ he reminded us. 
‘‘You have been approaching democ-
racy . . . for more than 200 years, and 
your journey toward that horizon has 
never been disrupted by a totalitarian 
system.’’ 
Fellow Americans, our journey con-
tinues on toward that horizon, and 
only we have the power to disrupt it. In 
this Nation, two plus two must always 
equal four. 
We can take a positive step forward 
in one respect. Here is how. Beginning 
today, I will be regularly recognizing 
notable pieces of Indiana’s history. It 
may be through a floor speech or a res-
olution or a social media posting. The 
purpose will be to celebrate and better 
understand my State’s part of Amer-
ica’s story and to remember the Hoo-
siers who—through and because of free-
dom of action, speech, and expression— 
wrote that story. They will not be 
erased. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
have been talking here in the Senate 
for months now about what needs to be 
done to respond to COVID–19. Right 
now, we are debating behind the scenes 
a fifth bill dealing with COVID–19. We 
have already passed four through the 
House and the Senate that the Presi-
dent has signed. 
Many Americans know the effects of 
those previous bills. They have re-
ceived deposits from the Treasury of 
$1,200, and they have received assist-
ance from the Paycheck Protection 
Program. Their schools have received 
assistance. Their hospitals have re-
ceived assistance. Their States have re-
ceived assistance. Their local jurisdic-
tions have received assistance. There 
has been wide support in multiple 
areas—for housing and for health, for 
testing and for vaccines. All of those 
things have happened in the previous 
four bills. 
Yet, when we passed the last set of 
bills, there was a lot of thought about 
what would happen next. How would 
the virus spread? How long would this 
last? Would Americans continue to just 
stay sequestered in their homes, away 
from everyone else? 
Now, after months of dealing with 
this COVID–19, not only in the United 
States but globally, we know a lot 
more about not only how we are going 
to respond and treat the disease but 
also about what we are dealing with, 
for COVID–19 doesn’t affect everyone in 
the same way health-wise or economi-
cally. 
There are some people who get 
COVID–19, and they, literally, never 
know it—they experience no symptoms 
at all—while others end up in a hos-
pital, in the ICU, or on ventilators. 
There are even fatalities. 
Economically, we are at the same 
spot with COVID–19. Some businesses 
in America and some individuals in 
America are, literally, making more 
money now than they ever have before. 
They are in one of those businesses 
that is in high need—maybe home im-
provement. Since lots of folks are stay-
ing at home, they are doing home im-
provements. The price of lumber has 
skyrocketed and the price for replace-
ment windows. All kinds of people are 
installing pools at their homes. They 
aren’t going on vacation this year. So 
they are doing things to fix up their 
homes. Construction and home im-
provement have skyrocketed. Retail 
sales and craft businesses and things to 
do at home have skyrocketed. 
A lot of other businesses that we 
have seen have actually increased dra-
matically, not just grocery stores and 
department stores and such, but online 
retailers. They are doing really good 
business. In my State, the incomes 
from many small towns to their com-
munities are higher now than they ever 
were in the history of their cities be-
cause people aren’t driving to other 
towns to shop. They are staying at 
home and are shopping locally or on-
line. So that tax revenue is going back 
to the cities. Literally, they are doing 
better now than they ever have done. 
For other communities and other 
businesses, there have been horrible ef-
fects during this time period, if you are 
a hotel or a convention center or a res-
taurant that surrounds a convention 
center. If the businesses deal with trav-
el, transportation, or vacations, all of 
those are struggling horribly during 
this time period, and there are mul-
tiple others. 
Here is the challenge that we have: 
Should our response now be the same 
as it was in March—to just pretend 
that this has struck everyone exactly 
the same—or should we pay attention 
to the realities economically around 
the country? 
I think we should be more strategic 
and understand that what we are 
spending is other people’s money. It is 
not just printed monopoly money that 
we can just throw out of here. It is debt 
on our future or it is, literally, taking 
money from the person next door or 
from your house. 
So what do we need to do in a bill, 
and what are the needs at this point? 
Some of them are very obvious. For 
the next bill that is coming, we need to 
focus in on vaccines, tests, and thera-
peutics. 
What are we going to do with tele-
health? How are we going to be able to 
help? 
This is, first and foremost, a health 
crisis, and it is amazing to me the

August 5, 2020 
number of topics that are being dis-
cussed for the next bill that have noth-
ing to do with COVID–19—nothing to do 
with it. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle came forward with the Heroes 
Act—a great name. It is a $3 trillion 
bill, and a full $1 trillion of it has noth-
ing to do with COVID–19. Unrelated 
completely is $1 trillion of it because it 
is a big bill, and we want to get other 
things in. We want to just throw it in 
there. 
Why don’t we start with this as a 
health crisis, and let’s focus in on the 
health issues there—vaccines, testing, 
therapeutics, telehealth. What can we 
do for rural hospitals? What needs to 
happen at urban and suburban hos-
pitals? Those are basic questions that 
should be there. 
One of the most successful programs 
that we put forward in the CARES Act 
was the Paycheck Protection Program. 
Now that it has had its headlines, as 
some folks have said, there are people 
who have abused it. Well, welcome to 
government. Every single program that 
comes out of government will be 
abused by someone at some time. 
We have seen that in the unemploy-
ment system. Unemployment insur-
ance has gone out, and it has been 
widely abused. Well, so have some por-
tions of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, but we have all seen the long 
lines at unemployment offices around 
the country. The reason this was put in 
place—the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram—was to do whatever we could to 
help shorten those lines at unemploy-
ment offices, for people to not have to 
leave and go on unemployment but to 
stay connected to their small business 
or not-for-profit. That has worked. 
In my State, 65,000 businesses and 
nonprofits have taken advantage of the 
Paycheck Protection Program—about 
$5.5 billion of assistance just in my 
State. 
But there are some things that need 
to be dealt with. The forgiveness sys-
tem on it is just coming out—much de-
layed, much to our frustration, but 
there are some straightforward things 
that can be done. 
If you are an entity with a loan that 
is $150,000 or less, there should be a 
very straightforward process of testi-
monial—a single page to fill out to 
complete this. We want to see this. 
We want to see businesses with the 
highest need—let’s say businesses with 
a 35-, 40-percent, 50-percent—some of 
them, 70-, 75-percent loss in revenue 
from the previous year should have an 
eligibility to get through this. 
Now, some businesses took the Pay-
check Protection Program, and they 
had a 5-percent loss over last year. To 
me, that is fine because at the begin-
ning of this, no one knew who was 
going to survive. Many of those busi-
ness owners were in the process of say-
ing: I am going to have to lay everyone 
off or I can keep them on the Paycheck 
Protection Program. They kept them 
on the Paycheck Protection Program 
and that helped those families have a 
stable time, where they knew where 
their check was coming from. It helped 
those businesses reopen, and many of 
them are reopening now. It kept them 
off the unemployment assistance. 
Now, if we do a second round of pay-
check protection, it really needs to be 
focused in on those businesses that are 
significantly off on revenue that will 
not survive without some additional 
help. 
We need to be attentive to how we 
actually handle this and be more stra-
tegic. We are not in the same situation 
that we were in March. 
We need to also look at businesses 
that were funded with private equity. 
It makes no sense to me that if a busi-
ness started and got their loan from a 
bank, they can get a Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, but if they got their cap-
ital from private equity, they are not 
eligible for this. 
The employees that work there don’t 
know where the capital came from to 
start the business; they just know they 
work there. But for some reason, there 
is a continual pushback to say: Well, if 
they were funded with private equity 
rather than a bank, then they are evil. 
No, they are startup companies doing 
technology, 
innovation, 
healthcare. 
Those are the kinds of companies that 
are out there that are being funded 
with private equity, but yet we have 
told their employees: You can just go 
to unemployment, and, literally, the 
business next door to them: No, you get 
paycheck protection. That makes no 
sense. We should fix that. 
We should put into this next bill 
some help for schools that are reopen-
ing. Now, not every school is reopen-
ing. They are not going to need the 
same level of help. Some schools are 
not reopening or they are choosing not 
to. I understand that. We gave addi-
tional funds—$30 billion of funds— 
across the country from the previous 
CARES Act to help schools transition 
to online learning, to help them get 
through the process of finding cleaning 
supplies, do additional training. That 
was $30 billion that was sent out to do 
that. 
Additional dollars should be helping 
those schools that are reopening that 
will have additional expenses. They are 
going to have to run additional bus 
routes to make sure they keep kids 
separate. They are going to have to do 
A and B schedules to open up their 
classrooms. There are going to be 
greater expenses for them, so we should 
help those schools that are reopening 
through the process. That is common 
sense in this. 
There has been a big request for an 
additional assistance check for those 
that need additional assistance. There 
are some families who are struggling to 
make their payments and are going to 
be evicted. 
The $1,200 that was sent out earlier 
this year went out to help stop that 
early in the year, and some families 
are still unemployed and still strug-
gling through this. What are we going 
to do to help them? 
There are some strategic ways to get 
out some additional assistance, but we 
should target it to those families of 
greatest need, and that should be the 
same with their unemployment assist-
ance. 
Unemployment assistance passed in 
March. There was an additional $600 
per week, per person that was sent out 
on unemployment assistance in addi-
tion to the normal State unemploy-
ment assistance. 
For many individuals in my State, 
that meant you made more on unem-
ployment than you did on employment. 
That is a problem long term. Now, this 
program was set up to be short term; 
that it would be assistance through the 
end of July, which has now passed. It 
was a week ago. But individuals apply-
ing for unemployment assistance this 
week are still getting unemployment 
assistance in my State, exactly as they 
were in February of this year, exactly 
as they were in November of last year, 
exactly as they were in August of last 
year. Unemployment assistance is still 
happening in my State, just like it is 
happening in every other State. 
But the debate is, do we want to go 
above and beyond unemployment as-
sistance that literally takes people to 
the spot where they make more stay-
ing at home than they do at work? 
Now, there are some folks who are 
saying: Well, that doesn’t actually 
deincentivize work. Really? Tell that 
to the folks whom I have talked to who 
work in manufacturing, who are there 
at the job working every day, and the 
person who usually works a pod away 
from them is at home because they 
have talked to them, and they are say-
ing: I will come back once my unem-
ployment goes away. 
So this person is busting their tail 
working, making less than the person 
who is staying at home, and the person 
staying at home is telling their friend: 
I will come back when the benefits run 
out. That is not right for either one of 
those folks. That tells that person 
working: You are a sucker for not just 
staying home and getting somebody 
else’s money. 
We should not incentivize for not 
working. We should help people get 
through a very difficult time, and that 
is what this is, but not discourage en-
gagement in work. That is not fair to 
the guy or the lady who is still work-
ing. That is not fair to the employer 
that has opened up and saying: I have 
got jobs available but no one will 
apply. And that is not right for that 
family who is staying home, taking 
money from their neighbors, when they 
know they could come back and work. 
Now, the law says that if you are of-
fered a job and you are on unemploy-
ment, you have to take it. But we 
know of way too many cases already 
where individuals are not taking the 
job they are offered, and the employer 
knows it is one of their employees who 
is a good employee, and they want

them to come back, so they hate to 
turn them in. So it puts everyone in a 
quandary—the employer and the em-
ployee because the employee is break-
ing the law by staying home, teaching 
their family to do the wrong thing, be-
cause it gets them more money. We 
shouldn’t put them in that spot, and we 
shouldn’t encourage people to be in 
that spot. 
In this bill, we should deal with un-
employment, but we should make sure 
we are helping people through this sea-
son, not incentivizing them to break 
the law. 
We should deal with nursing care and 
senior living. We should deal with hos-
pital care in this bill. Those are the 
areas that have been the hardest hit in 
all of America. The largest number of 
fatalities that we have had and the 
greatest amount of expense are in that 
area. We should do something to come 
alongside them. 
We should do something in this bill 
about liability protections. I have let-
ters and phone calls from universities 
in my State and from businesses in my 
State saying they are terrified to re-
engage for fear of what is going to hap-
pen with lawsuits coming in the days 
ahead that they can’t stop. 
They want to be able to serve their 
students at school, they want to be 
able to serve their customers in their 
business and the families who depend 
on that, but they are afraid of an en-
trepreneurial lawyer that will file law-
suits and will push them to settle or 
push them into bankruptcy at a very 
difficult time for them, only because 
this body will not step up and do basic 
liability protections. 
Now, if there is gross negligence, we 
should never protect that company. 
But if they are doing the best that they 
can, why wouldn’t we have basic liabil-
ity protections for our universities, our 
schools, and our places of business? 
We need to have in this bill some 
help for the postal system. There is a 
lot of debate about what that should 
be. Is it total reform of the postal sys-
tem? No, that is not what this is about. 
But just like we helped the State De-
partment in the CARES Act, we should 
help USPS in this bill as well. 
We have had some pushback on help-
ing some of the areas on immigration. 
Many of the entities in immigration 
are totally fee-based. When someone 
applies to come into the country with 
our visa system, they pay a fee to do 
that. Well, obviously, they are not 
coming in right now, so those areas of 
our immigration policy are really 
struggling right now. We should come 
alongside and help. That is a unique 
situation in a Federal agency. 
We should deal with election issues— 
maybe not like some people in this 
body want. In the CARES Act, we in-
cluded $350 million to the States to 
help them in their elections for this 
fall—$350 million. Almost none of that 
has been used by States because in the 
bill itself it also required the State leg-
islatures to add matching dollars to be 
able to come into session, and when we 
put that out from this body, those 
State legislatures were going out of 
session or they were locking down be-
cause they didn’t know what their ex-
penses would be. So almost no one has 
taken those funds because their legisla-
ture wasn’t in session to vote for it and 
because they didn’t have any ability to 
anticipate what funds would be needed 
this session, and so there is $350 mil-
lion of unused money from the last bill 
that we should just take the strings off 
of and make it clear to States: You 
could use these funds for the election 
coming up this fall. 
Now, there is a big push to say: Let’s 
add another $350 million. Come on, peo-
ple. Let’s read the last bill that we 
wrote and bring it forward into this 
bill and fix the problems from the last 
one. It shouldn’t be that difficult. 
Our States are going to need help on 
the elections this year. There will be 
much greater expenses, but we want 
the election to go smoothly. We have 
already allocated them the dollars. 
Let’s allow them to actually use it in a 
way that they can during this session. 
But that shouldn’t be for just mass 
mailing of every ballot. Just printing 
off ballots and mailing it to every 
house doesn’t solve the issue; it com-
plicates the issue. But we should help 
people with their election systems. 
And while I speak on State funding, 
this whole issue of State funding does 
need to be addressed. During the 
CARES Act that passed in March, this 
body gave the States $150 billion. There 
was also an allocation for healthcare of 
$260 billion. There was an allocation for 
education of $30 billion. Why do I bring 
that up? 
The three most expensive aspects in 
any State budget are education, public 
safety, and healthcare. Those are the 
three most expensive portions from 
any State budget. 
This body allocated $260 billion to-
ward healthcare, $30 billion toward 
education, $150 billion toward public 
safety and COVID expenses. 
Just to put that in perspective, the 
total budget for every State in Amer-
ica is $900 billion. Every State’s total 
budget combined spending that they do 
in a year—$900 billion. 
My Democratic colleagues want us to 
give almost $1 trillion to the States for 
COVID expenses. The total budget for 
every State in the entire country for 
the entire year is just over $900 billion, 
and they are going to give $1 trillion to 
them on top of it. That is more than 
replacing every State budget in Amer-
ica. That is absurd, and that is why 
these negotiations are so difficult—be-
cause it is not reasonable. 
They can just throw a number out 
and say everybody needs this. Replac-
ing the budget of every State in Amer-
ica is reasonable? I don’t think so, es-
pecially when we have already allo-
cated $260 billion toward healthcare, 
$30 billion toward education, and $150 
billion toward public safety and COVID 
response. 
The real issue is with the public safe-
ty and the COVID expenses because so 
many of the States—now with this 
whole ‘‘defund the police’’ movement— 
don’t want to allocate their public 
safety dollars toward public safety. 
They want to be able to use it for other 
things, not public safety. 
Well, that is a decision States can 
make, but they have the flexibility al-
ready to use those dollars. Literally, 
they could pay for every single law en-
forcement officer in their State—their 
salary and their benefits would be fully 
taken care of—but they are saying: I 
don’t want to pay our law enforcement. 
I want to use it for other things. Well, 
those funds have been allocated, and 
they need to make a decision on what 
they are going to do with it. 
Now, there is a lot that could be done 
with this bill, but my challenge for us 
is, let’s focus on the things that are es-
sential to be done, not the long wish 
list of what people want to cram into a 
bill because it is getting big, and they 
can hide something in it. 
Let’s keep it focused and let’s con-
tinue to remember this is a health cri-
sis and it is a season during which we 
should work across the aisle to solve 
things that are common sense and not 
ignore the problem. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Florida. 
f 
NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to address a topic 
that Washington has been ignoring for 
decades. For years, Republicans fought 
against wasteful spending under the 
Obama administration. My party ar-
gued that our debt and deficits were 
unsustainable, and they were leaving a 
burden that our children and grand-
children simply can’t afford. Unfortu-
nately, my party has shown an almost 
equal disregard for the dangers of a 
growing national debt and annual defi-
cits, as have the Democrats. 
Congress 
spends 
taxpayer 
money 
with no accountability—something you 
would never do in business or in your 
personal life—and our Federal Govern-
ment is borrowing an unprecedented 
amount of money. Congress borrows 
money with no plan to pay it back. Our 
families and our businesses cannot do 
that. Congress is leaving debt for the 
next generation. Parents and grand-
parents don’t do that. 
This year, between mid-March and 
late June, the Treasury’s total bor-
rowing rose by about $2.9 trillion, and 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of U.S. 
Treasury debt rose by about $1.6 tril-
lion. The Federal Reserve is creating 
an artificial market for treasuries to 
keep interest rates low. This is not sus-
tainable 
and 
will 
have 
dire 
con-
sequences. There will come a time 
when they can’t purchase any more 
treasuries and rates will increase. 
When the Federal Reserve can no 
longer keep interest rates low, every-
thing from car loans to student loans

August 5, 2020 
to mortgages become more expensive 
for the American people, and the inter-
est on our debt, which is already the 
fourth largest expenditure in the Fed-
eral budget, will become our largest ex-
penditure. For every 1 percent increase 
in our interest rate, we are going to 
spend almost $2 trillion over 10 years. 
That is more money the taxpayers get 
no return on. 
Even during the economic boom we 
were experiencing, our Federal Govern-
ment could not live within its means. 
Our Federal Government was set to 
spend approximately $4.6 trillion while 
collecting only $3.6 trillion in taxes in 
one of our greatest economies ever. 
Now, as we continue to address the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
the 
Federal 
Government this year will spend more 
than $7 trillion and collect much less 
than $3 trillion. The market is telling 
us that lenders are not confident this 
pandemic is being handled in a fiscally 
responsible manner. We are seeing the 
price of gold at a record high and the 
dollar devaluing, and this is just the 
beginning. 
Now Congress wants to spend more, 
even though we still don’t know how 
much has already been spent from pre-
vious relief packages. What is hap-
pening in Washington, DC, is wrong. It 
is unfair to Americans who work hard 
every day to take care of their fami-
lies. 
For months, I made a weekly video 
called ‘‘Washington Waste Wednesday’’ 
to highlight all the ways Washington is 
currently wasting taxpayer dollars. It 
wasn’t hard to find examples. Officials 
in Washington have failed to make the 
tough decisions that will put our Na-
tion on a fiscally successful path. It is 
the most inefficient place you can 
imagine. 
These poor choices mean a day of 
reckoning is coming. If our financial 
system comes crashing down because of 
excessive government spending and 
borrowing, history suggests we will 
have runaway inflation, with the price 
of goods skyrocketing. That will hurt 
the poorest families and those living on 
a fixed income. With inflation, fixed in-
comes will stay the same while the 
prices for necessities go up month after 
month. For hourly workers, wages will 
not grow fast enough to cover the ever- 
increasing costs of goods and services. 
This happened in the United States in 
the 1970s. 
Let’s not forget about the mandatory 
spending programs that Congress takes 
no accountability for. Medicare is run-
ning out of money. When Medicare 
runs out of money in 2026, either doc-
tors and hospitals will be paid signifi-
cantly less or Medicare recipients will 
receive less care. Medicaid costs are in-
creasing by about 5 percent a year. So-
cial Security will run out of cash re-
serves by 2035. At that time there will 
be an automatic 20-percent reduction 
of Social Security payments. 
Our country is like a failing business 
without a plan. We can’t accept this 
fate. 
I ran for Governor of Florida in 2010 
because I could not stand to watch the 
fiscal mismanagement by politicians 
anymore. Over my 8 years as Governor, 
we made the tough choices to turn the 
State around. We grew the economy by 
over 30 percent, added almost 1.7 mil-
lion new jobs, paid down almost one- 
third of State debt, and cut taxes by 
more than $10 billion. I was the first 
Governor in 20 years to actually pay 
down State debt. 
I ran for the U.S. Senate to do the 
same thing at the Federal level. I was 
tired of watching career politicians in 
Washington 
spend 
other 
people’s 
money without a care. Washington 
seems to have forgotten that trillions 
of dollars in new spending means tril-
lions in tax increases somewhere down 
the road. They want short-term solu-
tions regardless of consequences. 
Career politicians say they care 
about you. When they run huge defi-
cits, do they care about you? 
When they raise your taxes, do they 
care about you? 
When they overpromise benefits for 
Social Security without a funding 
source, do they care about you? 
When they overpromise Medicare 
benefits without a funding source, do 
they care about you? 
Maybe the intentions are good. Who 
knows? But, unfortunately, you can’t 
pay for Social Security with good in-
tentions. You can’t pay for Medicare 
with good intentions. You can’t build a 
lethal military with good intentions. 
And you can’t open a business with just 
good intentions. These good intentions 
have created $27 trillion of debt that 
our children and grandchildren will 
have to answer for. Now they want to 
spend another $3 trillion. It is time to 
wake up. 
We can fix this and put our Nation on 
a fiscally responsible path. We fix this 
by doing what I did in Florida. We need 
to focus on growing the economy, cut-
ting taxes and burdensome regulations, 
and streamlining permitting. We fix 
this by helping every American get a 
good job. We fix this with a focus on 
buying American, with the under-
standing that buying products made by 
our adversaries, like Communist China, 
hurts American jobs and manufac-
turing and threatens our national secu-
rity. We fix this by making good trade 
deals with other freedom-loving coun-
tries, and we fix this by getting a re-
turn on every taxpayer dollar we 
spend. 
Turning around a failing business is 
hard. I have done that. Turning around 
a failing State is also hard—even hard-
er. I have done that. Turning around 
the future of a nation sounds impos-
sible, but it is not. 
If elected leaders don’t want to do 
the hard work—and it is going to be 
hard—then they should go home. They 
can no longer hide behind the cow-
ardice of political expediency. 
Politicians in Washington are afraid 
to tell you the truth, so here it is: If we 
want our country to survive and thrive 
and continue to be a beacon for free-
dom, prosperity, and hope around the 
world, we will need to make tough 
choices. We will need to be more pro-
ductive, and we cannot rely on govern-
ment programs paid for through more 
borrowing. We will need to reassert the 
fundamental principle of conservatism 
that the private sector and individ-
uals—not the government—should be 
the driving forces behind our economic 
stability and success. 
As long as I am a Member of the U.S. 
Senate, I will fight to rein in the out- 
of-control spending that is putting our 
children’s and our grandchildren’s fu-
tures at risk. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, his-
tory has a way of repeating itself. If we 
don’t learn from the mistakes of the 
past, we are apt to repeat them. As the 
November election draws near and as 
foreign adversaries again seek to med-
dle in our democracy, let’s review our 
history so we can better identify and 
prevent future threats. 
In late July 2016, Obama’s FBI 
opened 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
Trump campaign that ended up spi-
raling out of control for years—4 years. 
The 
investigation 
was 
ultimately 
based, in large part, on what is known 
as the Steele dossier, which was a 
bunch of unverified claims from Rus-
sian Government sources. It happens 
that that dossier was paid for by the 
Democratic National Committee and 
by the Clinton campaign. 
We know that its author, Christopher 
Steele, simultaneously pitched those 
same unverified claims to U.S. media 
outlets, which then reported on them 
without even testing their veracity. 
That is not responsible journalism. 
We know that Members of this Sen-
ate publicly seized on those unverified 
media reports to attack their political 
rivals. They even made references to 
the ‘‘secret FBI investigations’’ to give 
the unverified, foreign-sourced claims 
a veneer of credibility. We know that 
those unverified claims became part of 
the focus of a sweeping and unneces-
sary multiyear investigation by some 
of the Justice Department’s most ag-
gressive prosecutors. 
In the end, they found no crime by 
the campaign or President Trump, de-
spite the dossier’s allegations. Also, 
that shameful and damaging episode 
was propelled by selective leaks from 
government officials and breathless 
broadcasting by the press and the op-
posing political view.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4894 
August 5, 2020 
Of course, now it is undergoing a 
postmortem. What we are finding out 
isn’t very pretty, and the people behind 
it ought to be ashamed—ought to be 
very ashamed. 
We have learned that some of those 
now-debunked claims of collusion with 
a 
foreign 
adversary 
were 
actually 
sourced to that same foreign adver-
sary. In other words, those claims were 
assessed to be Russian disinformation. 
Democrats got duped into falsely ac-
cusing their political rivals of doing 
the very thing they were actually 
complicit in. 
We have learned that senior FBI offi-
cials had such disdain for President 
Trump that they pushed the unverified 
information despite repeated warnings 
of its flaws. They wanted to believe so 
badly in the politically convenient nar-
rative that they failed to do their jobs. 
They lied to a court to spy on the cam-
paign. They leaked memos to launch a 
special counsel investigation. They 
even doctored the paperwork—all to 
advance an investigation rooted in lies, 
innuendo, and foreign disinformation. 
I could go on about the harmful con-
sequences from the hysteria that con-
sumed the last few years, but the les-
son from it all is very simple: Our ad-
versaries will do anything to hijack 
our political differences to sow discord 
and distrust. Our adversaries want us 
at each other’s throat. So long as we 
are fighting amongst ourselves, they 
win. 
Why do I bring this up now? Because 
exactly 4 years later, we are watching 
the same group run the same play 
today. If we aren’t careful, they will 
win again. Just like in 2016, foreign 
sources are pushing unverified mate-
rial about political candidates; just 
like in 2016, that material has report-
edly found its way into the U.S. intel-
ligence reviews; and just like in 2016, 
political rivals in Congress and the 
press are using the unverified foreign 
sources and their claims to suggest col-
lusion between Republicans and foreign 
adversaries. Just remember what I 
said—just like in 2016. 
In the last few weeks, Democrats 
have falsely accused me and Senator 
JOHNSON of receiving packets of infor-
mation, 
including 
tapes, 
from 
a 
Ukrainian. That is false reporting 
based on leaks from a letter written by 
Senators SCHUMER, WARNER, Speaker 
PELOSI, and Representative SCHIFF, 
which is itself based on cherry-picked 
innuendo from classified documents. 
This Ukrainian claims that he also 
sent the information to several Demo-
crats. These Democrats have also de-
nied receiving anything. Again, what is 
this all about? The goal is to sow as 
much confusion as possible. The claims 
are baseless. Neither I nor anyone on 
my staff had anything to do with him. 
We never reached out to him or re-
ceived anything from him. We never re-
ceived or reviewed anything like what 
was described in the Democrats’ leaked 
documents. 
Here is the rub. But that didn’t stop 
the press from reporting the story any-
way. Remember, 2016, 2017, and 2018? It 
didn’t stop the press from reaching out 
to this Ukrainian to present him with 
the apparently leaked classified infor-
mation from the Democrats’ letter. 
Let me be clear. My investigation 
with Senator JOHNSON is based on how 
the Obama administration formulated 
its Ukraine policy, which then-Vice 
President Biden oversaw while his son 
was on the board of a corrupt Ukrain-
ian natural gas company that was 
under investigation. 
Did the corrupt firm get special ac-
cess or special treatment because of its 
ties to the Vice President’s son? We 
should know that. Did the Obama ad-
ministration appropriately address any 
conflicts of interest? We should know 
that. In fact, the American people 
should know that. 
In pursuit of those facts—now, fol-
lowing the leads where they take you, 
so I say, in pursuit of the facts, we 
have requested records from the State 
Department, National Archives, De-
partment of Justice, some other Fed-
eral agencies, and the U.S. consulting 
firm Blue Star Strategies. We have also 
talked with current and former U.S. 
Government officials. 
Isn’t this odd? Apparently, Obama 
administration records and speaking 
with Obama administration officials is, 
to our Democratic friends, foreign or 
Russian disinformation. Isn’t that odd? 
As Senator JOHNSON and I noted to 
our Democratic colleagues in a letter 
when we answered their letter—if it is, 
then that means the Obama adminis-
tration routinely peddled in it as well. 
Democrats have suggested that the 
cause 
of 
their 
concern 
is 
Andrii 
Telizhenko. In March 2020, the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee sought to subpoena 
him only for records from his yearlong 
employment with Blue Star Strate-
gies—a Democratic consulting firm 
that lobbied the U.S. Government on 
behalf of the Biden-connected Ukrain-
ian energy firm. Blue Star also had 
contracts at the highest levels of Presi-
dent Obama’s administration. Notably, 
Mr. Telizhenko had working relation-
ships with Obama administration offi-
cials. 
I don’t recall ever any Democrat rais-
ing concerns about Mr. Telizhenko 
being a national security threat while 
he was meeting with the Obama admin-
istration, but, apparently, he suddenly 
becomes one when Republicans ask for 
records involving his time at a Demo-
cratic lobby shop. 
Truth be told, the Democrats should 
know a thing or two about Russian 
disinformation. Investigative work by 
me and Senator JOHNSON has revealed 
now declassified intelligence reporting 
that parts of the Steele dossier were 
parts of the Russian disinformation 
campaign. 
I am not aware of the Democrats 
commenting publicly on this very dis-
turbing revelation. Where is their out-
rage about concerns of actual Russian 
disinformation contained in the Steele 
dossier and at the same time Russian 
disinformation paid for by the Demo-
cratic National Committee and Hillary 
Clinton? 
The Steele dossier is the very, very 
definition of election interference, and 
yet we hear no objection from Demo-
crats. Did the Democrats and the Clin-
ton campaign know that the dossier 
was filled with Russian disinformation 
and run with it, anyway, knowing it 
would cause damage to Trump, his 
campaign, and administration? 
Is Russian disinformation synony-
mous with Democratic National Com-
mittee 
disinformation? 
Maybe 
the 
Democrats don’t want to look under 
the hood of the fake Russia investiga-
tion because—because they would be 
front and center. 
I would like to remind my Demo-
cratic colleagues that I ordered my 
staff to interview Donald Trump, Jr., 
and Republican officials during my 
time as chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, and we did so. At the same 
time, ask yourself if I ever requested 
an interview with Hunter Biden. If I 
did that, how would the Democrats 
react? 
My fellow Americans, this is where 
we are at now. The Democrats live by 
the motto ‘‘Do as I say, not as I do.’’ 
Yet they accuse me and my colleague, 
Senator JOHNSON, of playing politics 
and engaging in a disinformation cam-
paign. 
The hard truth is, it is the Democrats 
who are engaged in a disinformation 
campaign all because the facts don’t fit 
into their political narrative. Their si-
lence regarding the Steele dossier and 
fake Russia investigation, yet com-
plaints about my legitimate oversight 
investigation, is proof of that. 
In conclusion, these recent media re-
ports hinge on the leak of Democrats’ 
classified 
documents, 
which 
they 
hadn’t shared with their Republican 
colleagues. Only after the stories were 
published—I want to emphasize, only 
after the stories were published—were I 
and my staff able to review the Demo-
crats’ documents. 
Their letter is full of cherry-picked 
lines designed to shoehorn Republicans 
into warnings of a very real threat that 
faces all of us. Their letter attempts to 
cast Republicans as unwitting pawns in 
foreign disinformation, but it appears 
that the Democrats are playing the 
role as a useful idiot for foreign adver-
saries. 
The leaks only further distort the 
content of their letter. In no conceiv-
able way do the facts support the 
Democrats’ and the media’s prepos-
terous narrative. 
Here is what really bothers me the 
most. My Democratic colleagues have 
known me for a very long time. They 
know who I am. They know where to 
find me. And they know that if they 
were so concerned about what I was al-
legedly up to, they should have just 
raised all of those issues with me. This 
nonsense of orchestrated leaks to plant 
stories and falsely accusing me of deal-
ing in disinformation based on actual

disinformation that I wasn’t even privy 
to serves only the interest of our 
shared adversaries. This happens to be 
the behavior of cowards. And, of 
course, it should stop. As I started out 
my remarks today, we have seen this 
movie before. It didn’t end well for 
those who relied on a disinformation 
dossier in 2016. 
Finally, the truth is slowly starting 
to come out and the FBI, the media, 
and the Members of Congress who tout-
ed the disinformation look pretty bad 
today. I started out by saying we need 
to learn from history—I believe it was 
George Santayana who said something 
like that maybe 100 years ago—or you 
are going to repeat the mistakes of the 
past. Let’s not repeat this history. In-
stead, we ought to be learning from it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
(Mr. ROUNDS assumed the chair.) 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
COVID–19 HEROES 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
talk about two topics today. One topic 
I was reminded of when I was in St. Jo-
seph and Joplin, MO, over the weekend, 
talking to healthcare providers and 
volunteers of all kinds who are trying 
to do what they can to help us emerge 
from this pandemic stronger than we 
were to start with. 
Certainly, what first comes to mind 
is the healthcare workers themselves— 
the medical workers, doctors, nurses, 
and support staff whom we have relied 
on from the very first moments that 
we began to realize that this virus was 
bigger than any health issue we have 
dealt with in a long time. We are still 
depending on them today. At some 
point someone can run out of some of 
the capacity and steam that you have 
to do the job that needs to be done, but 
we see these heroes continuing to step 
up, and some giving their lives. 
Billy Birmingham, in Kansas City, 
was an emergency medical technician. 
He was with the Kansas City Fire De-
partment, and he died of coronavirus in 
April. His son described Billy as self-
less. He said Billy had decided he want-
ed to find new ways to help people. So 
he reinvented himself as an EMT when 
he was in his 40s so he could help oth-
ers. He was an EMT for about 22 years. 
We see the emergency medical tech-
nicians and first responders out there 
saving lives, bringing people into the 
hospital who are in a desperate situa-
tion, infectious, as many of them can 
be, and at sort of the height of suf-
fering and unable to do much to help 
you help them, but we see that hap-
pening. We are benefited by it, and we 
see a lot of sacrifice in the community. 
There are people such as Heather 
Black at the Harry S. Truman Memo-
rial Hospital in Columbia, MO. She do-
nated 623 hand-sewn masks for her col-
leagues and the veterans at the facility 
whom they care for. She brought her 
sewing machine to work so that she 
could make masks during her free time 
before and after her shift and during 
her breaks. One of her colleagues said: 
You have to be just literally awed by 
somebody that dedicated to helping 
people. Remember that she is making 
masks, and between the breaks she is 
helping care for the patients at the vet-
erans hospital. 
We see people finding different ways 
of being heroes in their communities. 
Dozens of people in Cape Girardeau, in 
May, decided to put a parade together 
for residents of the veterans home who 
were unable to have visitors. The vet-
erans got to the windows and the doz-
ens of people came by doing what they 
could to present a Memorial Day kind 
of parade. There are groups in St. 
Louis and other places, but particu-
larly the one I was thinking about in 
St. Louis. They went around and col-
lected food and personal care items, 
and they took those to people who had 
lost their jobs, who were suffering from 
the pandemic, who were isolated in 
their efforts. 
I talked today to a number of people 
in the behavioral health area who un-
derstand that, at moments like this, 
people who have behavioral health 
issues have logical reasons for those 
issues to begin to pile up on them. You 
are isolated. You are sick or somebody 
in your family is sick. You have lost a 
job or somebody you know has lost a 
job. And those issues get bigger. 
Then we see businesses who figure 
out how to use their unique set of re-
sources, whatever that might be, to 
make things happen. When we find it 
hard to get hand sanitizers, a number 
of distilleries went into the hand sani-
tizer business. Anheuser-Busch, which 
is not a distillery but a brewery, used 
their brewery facilities to produce 
more than a half-million bottles of 
hand sanitizer and then they used their 
distribution system to get those half 
million bottles in the communities and 
places around the country where they 
would do the most good. 
Bass Pro Shops, in my hometown of 
Springfield, donated 1 million face 
masks to healthcare workers on the 
frontlines. From delivering truckloads 
of critical supplies to simply checking 
on our neighbors, there are thousands 
of stories to tell in towns across Mis-
souri and in towns in Georgia, where 
the Presiding Officer lives. There are 
people doing all they can to make this 
terrible situation less terrible and this 
challenging situation less challenging. 
We are grateful to them. 
I know a number of people have come 
to the floor today to talk about those 
heroes and how they serve us. 
COVID–19 TESTING DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the sec-
ond topic I wanted to talk about is 
that we spend lots of time discussing 
what to do in this next phase of dealing 
with the coronavirus legislation. I 
want to talk about something we did 
earlier and the results it has produced. 
In April, Senator ALEXANDER and I 
proposed that the National Institutes 
of Health create a ‘‘Shark Tank’’ pro-
gram for scientists to develop new 
technologies for COVID–19 testing. NIH 
set up that program very quickly. We 
gave them the authority and money to 
do it, but they did in a week what they 
normally would have done in 6 months. 
They have been working overtime ever 
since with the private sector and with 
BARDA, or the Biomedical Advanced 
Research and Development Authority, 
to meet the tremendous need for 
quicker and earlier tests. 
The Presiding Officer and I talked 
about this just the other day. The 
President is right in his view that some 
of these tests only tell us information 
that gives us more data. We need tests 
that are quicker and have an imme-
diate response. When you go get a test 
and you don’t have a response for 5 
days, that really doesn’t do anybody a 
whole lot of good. You have been mov-
ing around for 5 days, maybe without 
symptoms, and you don’t know that 
you are continuing to spread the virus. 
If you had known in 5 minutes or 15 
minutes what it took you 5 days to find 
out, how many less people would have 
gotten the disease if you had known 
what you needed to know when you 
needed to know it? 
We need tests that give accurate re-
sults in minutes, that are easy to take, 
and are inexpensive—tests that may 
cost from a $1 to $5 or $6, that give you 
an immediate response. So that is what 
we asked of this program at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to work on, 
to put together scientists, researchers, 
and engineers to come up with their 
boldest ideas. 
So far, since April 29, 650 applications 
have been submitted with ideas from 
single individuals or businesses who 
say: I think this would work. That 
would be sort of the starting point. By 
the way, a lot more than 650 people had 
‘‘this will work’’ ideas, but when NIH 
sat down and looked, they came up 
with 650 applicants they thought need-
ed a careful look. 
Thirty-one of those projects have 
gone into phase 1 testing. They go 
through a process of validation, seeing 
if the likelihood that this will work is 
as great as what the scientists, engi-
neers, and technologists who populate 
the shark tank thought it would be. 
NIH announced that 20 of those 
projects would be considered even more 
closely over a few weeks in phase 2, and 
just last week, NIH selected 7 compa-
nies that would start scaling up pro-
duction of their technology. Taxpayers 
are investing about $250 million to help 
those tests get out there quickly. 
These tests could be available as early

as next month. Some of them are the 
type of rapid tests that give a result on 
site. 
One test uses a handheld device that 
can detect the virus within 30 minutes. 
Another test company has developed a 
way to speed up lab testing so that labs 
that now handle hundreds of tests can 
handle tens of thousands in the same 
period of time. These kinds of tech-
nologies and others are essential if we 
want to get our society fully reopened. 
In early April, there was an average 
of 145,000 tests a day. Today, we are 
running about 800,000 tests, but often 
they are not the kind of tests we need, 
and they are not the numbers we need. 
We need tests that millions of people 
can take dozens of times. We need tests 
for every person who walks into an of-
fice or a factory or a nursing home or 
a school or a childcare center so that 
there is confidence in knowing they are 
not bringing the virus into that center. 
It is a high hurdle, but I think it is one 
that we are going to clear. 
The HEALS Act includes another $15 
billion for testing to help in our prior-
ities, which are nursing homes and 
daycare centers, childcare centers, ele-
mentary and secondary schools, col-
leges and universities. Those are areas 
where we think the government itself 
has an extraordinary obligation to 
make the difference. That $16 billion, 
added to the $9 billion of money for 
this purpose that hasn’t been spent up 
until now, means that we have that 
kind of big investment to see that peo-
ple have tests that work for them and 
work quickly. 
For this to happen, Congress has to 
act. Congress has to move. We have to 
be supportive of efforts that get our so-
ciety back to school, back to work, 
back to childcare, and back to better 
health. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
appreciate the remarks of my col-
league, Senator BLUNT, and the effort 
he has made to really focus in on how 
we can ensure there are appropriate 
levels of testing as we respond to this 
COVID pandemic. We recognize that 
the technologies, treatments, and vac-
cines are what will get us there. 
In the meantime, there are many 
men and women across the country 
who are doing extraordinary work re-
sponding on the healthcare side, as 
well as responding as we deal with the 
economic impact and the economic 
fallout due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
There are a lot of challenges—incred-
ible challenges, all over the country— 
challenges to the health sector, to our 
economy, and to our everyday life. I 
think it is fair to say that the last 6 
months have been emotionally ex-
hausting for people. 
We have heard this before. We are all 
ready for COVID–19 to be over, but the 
virus is not ready to be over with us. 
We are adjusting to a new normal, 
and as we deal with it, I think it is im-
portant to acknowledge the individ-
uals—really, the heroes—in so many of 
our communities who have saved lives 
and really provided a level of care and 
compassion throughout it all. 
Like all States in the Nation, Alaska 
has been severely impacted by this 
pandemic. Last week was a pretty 
rough week for us. We were included 
among the States with the fastest 
growing numbers in terms of rates of 
transmission. Fortunately, that seems 
to be tapering a little bit right now but 
only with very aggressive measures. 
In my hometown of Anchorage, our 
mayor has resumed the hunker-down 
mode for us in terms of restaurants and 
bars being closed to indoor dining or a 
recognition that many of the advances 
we had been able to move forward on 
are now being ratcheted back. There 
are also additional travel restrictions. 
For us, it is a time of year when our 
communities all over the State would 
be welcoming droves of tourists, all 
coming to enjoy the best of Alaska, but 
this year, our season is all but elimi-
nated, almost nonexistent. Certainly, 
when it comes to recognizing the vol-
ume of tourists the cruise industry pro-
vides to Alaska, those have all been 
canceled. The flights that people would 
make to the State have been made 
more difficult by mandatory quar-
antine for our travelers. It has not im-
pacted just the tourism sector; it has 
impacted the oil industry, the service 
industry, and our fisheries. 
As I mentioned, as difficult as these 
economic times are, the most impor-
tant thing we all need to be focused on 
is the health and safety of our people. 
I have tremendous appreciation and 
gratitude for all the healthcare work-
ers and the individuals who work to 
protect Alaskans on a daily basis. 
In Alaska, we are extremely fortu-
nate to have our COVID–19 health re-
sponse led by Dr. Anne Zink. She is our 
State’s chief medical officer. She, 
along with her team at the Division of 
Public Health, has been doing a great 
job under Governor Dunleavy’s leader-
ship to implement and communicate 
clear public health guidelines from the 
beginning of this unpredictable event. I 
think if you have an opportunity to 
meet Dr. Zink, she just projects calm. 
She projects confidence. She projects 
assurance. 
She has absolutely earned the trust 
of Alaskans throughout this difficult 
time. She has done so not only because 
of her demeanor but really how she 
leads. She leads by example in mod-
eling the behavior that she is encour-
aging all Alaskans to follow. She has 
probably taken social distancing and 
teleworking to a new level, as she 
teleworks from a yurt outside of her 
family home in Palmer. 
She was able to take a small group of 
Alaskans to some villages—more re-
mote villages in this State with Dr. 
Eastman from Health and Social Serv-
ices when he came to Alaska. It was at 
a time when most of these commu-
nities were very, very reticent—as 
many still are—to allow anyone in 
from the outside for fear of transmit-
ting the virus. She not only led this 
trip very safely, but then, when she re-
turned to her home, she led the exam-
ple of self-quarantining for 14 days to 
ensure that anything she might have 
been exposed to was not going to be 
shared with those whom she loved. Her 
priority has been and continues to be 
flattening 
the 
curve, 
slowing 
the 
spread. 
We know in our State that we are 
just a little more isolated. We are more 
separate. We are more remote. But we 
know that we are not immune from 
any disease of this type. That is surely 
evidenced by our history. 
In 1918, when the Spanish flu—the 
last global pandemic—hit our State, 
more people died per capita in Alaska 
than almost anywhere else in the 
world. In many of our small and Native 
villages, 70 percent, 80 percent of the 
population was wiped out literally in a 
few-day period. It is hard not to think 
about that when we face this current 
pandemic. 
In fact, Alaska was one of the very 
first States in the country to put to-
gether a coordinated response to the 
challenges presented by COVID. This 
was back in January. 
On January 28, there was a chartered 
plane carrying U.S. consulate per-
sonnel and citizens from an area of 
China that had been at the center of 
the outbreak. That plane landed in An-
chorage. The passengers had to debark 
the plane in order to refuel. They were 
moving to California. 
We had a situation where there was a 
pretty quick scramble. Dr. Zink led her 
team, and they were able to mobilize 
very quickly and very efficiently to en-
sure a safe operation that was success-
ful in ensuring the protection and the 
health and safety of all who were in-
volved. They opened up a terminal 
there at Ted Stevens International Air-
port. They created a quarantine unit 
that delivered not one but two health 
screenings to over 200 passengers and 
crew members. It was a pretty extraor-
dinary event that they were able to put 
together in very, very short order. 
Those who were part of that said Dr. 
Zink’s comments on this effort really 
reflect her strong leadership. 
Dr. Zink noted: 
It is easy to stay focused on all that we 
had to do in a short period of time to prepare 
and respond, but at the end of the day, this 
mission was about people. It was about 
American citizens, some of whom were work-
ing to serve our country. It was about fami-
lies, and it was about helping each other in 
a time of need. 
Dr. Zink has been doing extraor-
dinary work as we have dealt with 
challenging issues as they relate to 
quarantine after travel, travel restric-
tions around the States that have been 
extraordinarily limiting. 
She has worked with her team to put 
together plans of operation and proto-
cols so that our fisheries can be suc-
cessfully prosecuted, and they have

been a mark of success in terms of 
being able to identify and then isolate 
and then keep the virus from transmit-
ting. 
She is now very, very focused on how 
we safely return our kids back to 
school. I had a long conversation with 
her a few days back. She says that this 
is the ultimate challenge in that it is 
not just how we reopen schools but how 
we keep our schools open after that. 
That is our challenge. 
She shared with me—she said: I 
thought that putting together the 
plans and the protocols for the seafood 
processors was going to be challenging 
and difficult in these very remote com-
munities where they have limited 
healthcare in the event that you have 
the virus spread. That was difficult, 
but getting our schools open and keep-
ing them open safely—this is the big-
gest challenge. 
She said that schools are now her 
new seafood processors. So she is tak-
ing up the challenge aggressively. 
Dr. Zink reminds us that at the end 
of the day, what we have to stay fo-
cused on is keeping people safe, keep-
ing our families and our workers safe. 
This is a moment about all of us and 
how we respond during this great time 
of need. 
I am extraordinarily thankful for Dr. 
Zink’s leadership, both out in front and 
behind the scenes as she works with 
the many extraordinary Alaskans who 
are seeking to make a difference as we 
take on the daily challenges and bat-
tles that face us with the COVID–19 re-
sponse. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
f 
COVID–19 HEROES 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
join my colleagues in honoring those 
who have helped their communities to 
overcome 
challenges 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
There are many everyday heroes who 
deserve recognition. We have seen the 
efforts of our first responders, law en-
forcement, teachers, postal and deliv-
ery employees, and store workers, 
among others, who have continued pro-
viding essential services in spite of the 
challenges 
brought 
on 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
As the chairman of the Senate Agri-
culture Appropriations Subcommittee, 
I have spoken many times about the 
critically important work of our farm-
ers and our ranchers. 
I see I am joined here on the floor by 
our Agriculture Committee chairman. I 
know he has been down here as well 
pointing out how our farmers and 
ranchers are continuing to provide 
food, fuel, and fiber for our Nation even 
during this pandemic. We are working 
to help and support them during this 
challenging time. Every American ben-
efits every day from the work of those 
farmers and ranchers, who provide the 
highest quality and lowest cost food 
supply in the world in tough times and 
even in times when we face something 
like a pandemic. 
Today, I would like to recognize the 
valiant efforts of the healthcare profes-
sionals in my State and across this 
country and highlight some of the 
work our North Dakotans are doing— 
doctors, nurses, and many others work-
ing in hospitals and clinics across our 
State. 
North Dakota’s healthcare profes-
sionals have been working around the 
clock to prevent the spread of this 
virus and to treat those affected by 
COVID–19. 
One example is Dr. Chris Pribula, a 
graduate of the University of North 
Dakota Medical School, who worked 
with a team to set up the COVID Care 
Unit at Sanford Hospital in Fargo. He 
was on duty when the first COVID pa-
tient arrived at the hospital and re-
mained on duty for the next 18 days 
straight to make sure that staff and 
patients had everything they needed. 
Over the past several months, I have 
held a number of roundtables with 
healthcare professionals in North Da-
kota. As we have discussed issues and 
challenges, one thing is clear: Our 
healthcare providers are diligent and 
dedicated in their efforts to prepare for 
and prevent the spread of coronavirus 
and to provide patients with the best 
possible care. 
Another individual highlighted by his 
colleagues is Dr. Kremens, a critical 
care physician at Essentia Health who 
intubated and managed multiple criti-
cally ill patients at once. Dr. Kremens 
is a good example of the many inten-
sive care and emergency department 
physicians and nurses who have fought 
on the frontlines of the pandemic and 
continue to do so. 
We are grateful for the dedicated 
service of the many healthcare profes-
sionals in North Dakota and recognize 
that they and their loved ones have 
made 
many 
sacrifices 
during 
this 
health emergency. 
We worked to provide our health pro-
viders with much needed support in the 
first three phases of the coronavirus re-
lief legislation. For example, under the 
CARES Act, North Dakota rural hos-
pitals and providers have received $135 
million to help with their efforts to 
combat COVID–19. As negotiations con-
tinue on the next phase of relief, 
healthcare remains a top priority. 
While our healthcare providers have 
been working diligently, I would also 
like to recognize how members of our 
communities have stepped up to help 
our medical professionals as well. 
An example of the community step-
ping up to meet the challenge during 
the pandemic is Proof Artisan Dis-
tillers, a small craft distillery in 
Fargo, ND. Back in March, Proof Arti-
san Distillery responded to the commu-
nity need. Working with Tharaldson 
Ethanol in Casselton, ND, they began 
producing sanitizer for healthcare, as-
sisted living facilities, first responders, 
Tribal and municipal entities, and 
highway patrols from four neighboring 
States. 
Proof Artisan Distillery’s president, 
Joel Kath, relayed this story: 
During our second day of production, I an-
swered a frantic call from a supply director 
of a large memory care group. They were vir-
tually out of sanitizer and would not be re-
supplied through their normal channels for 
many weeks. The caller broke down with 
emotion when I confirmed that we could eas-
ily supply their needs. It’s a response I will 
never forget, and a constant reminder of the 
importance of our task at hand. 
Another example from my home 
State is Infinite Leap, a company 
founded by Air Force veteran Mark 
Rheault that is using technology to 
help healthcare providers offer virtual 
waiting rooms. Infinite Leap’s tech-
nology helps eliminate registration 
lines, reduce congestion in waiting 
areas, and decrease patient waiting 
times. Not only is this technology 
being utilized by healthcare providers 
to help maintain social distancing, the 
technology is also helping other indus-
tries, including restaurants and manu-
facturing plants, to safely reopen. 
These are just a few examples of the 
individuals 
and 
organizations 
that 
have stepped up and helped their com-
munities to meet the challenges during 
this health emergency. 
Again, I thank our healthcare pro-
viders for their dedicated effort to 
fight this virus. We recognize the chal-
lenges they face, and we are truly 
grateful for their hard work. They are, 
in fact, truly everyday heroes. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
f 
COVID–19 HEROES 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my many colleagues fa-
miliar with agriculture—the farmers, 
ranchers, growers, everybody in the 
food chain—and my thanks to Senator 
ERNST for really starting this, making 
a great speech last week. We are all 
trying to follow up with the same mes-
sage to shine a spotlight on our Na-
tion’s COVID–19 heroes. 
We have heard the term ‘‘hero’’ a lot 
during this pandemic. I believe the 
title is warranted to describe the many 
Kansans and, for that matter, all 
Americans who are doing extraor-
dinary work and making great sac-
rifices to make this country safer and 
healthier. 
Today, I want to talk about the he-
roes—the special heroes in agriculture: 
our farmers, our ranchers, our growers. 
The Sun comes out every day. A lot of 
us are in safe places. We have decided 
that is the best alternative for us, and 
so we have a lot of shutdowns. 
Not 
farm 
country. 
The 
farmers, 
ranchers, and growers, they don’t have 
that option. They have to do what they 
have to do in terms of planting their 
crops, harvesting their crops, taking 
care of their crops. They work long 
hours, day in and day out, to produce

the food on our dinner tables and make 
sure 
our 
supermarket 
shelves 
are 
stocked. 
These 
producers 
are 
facing 
low 
prices, regulatory overreach, a chal-
lenging trade environment, and drastic 
and sudden changes in demand for their 
crops and animals. To top it off, net 
farm income is estimated to drop by 
nearly $20 billion as of this year. De-
spite all these challenges, they have 
continued to produce even more with 
less. 
American farmers and ranchers are 
so efficient at their jobs that we are 
able to enjoy the most affordable food 
of any country in the world—and the 
most safe. We also have the safest and 
most ample food supply. 
That is why I consider—as well as all 
of my colleagues on the Agriculture 
Committee and others who are privi-
leged to represent farmers, ranchers, 
and growers—that they are true heroes. 
Producing food for a troubled and 
hungry world is what farmers do day in 
and day out, but especially at times 
like this, it is nothing short of heroic. 
We have taken steps to address the 
needs of our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers, and in recent months—in 
March—unanimously, we passed the 
CARES Act. 
I would say that would be a goal we 
might want to achieve with the Heroes 
Act scaled down to whatever we want 
to call it—and also the HEALS Act. At 
any rate, it was unanimous back then, 
and that funded the Department of Ag-
riculture to address the needs related 
to the pandemic, among a lot of other 
things. 
We included $9.5 billion for Agri-
culture Secretary Sonny Perdue to de-
liver emergency support for those in 
agriculture and the food industry who 
suffered losses due to the pandemic, 
and we included $14 billion partial re-
plenishment for the Department of Ag-
riculture’s Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion to provide additional assistance to 
affected producers. This legislation en-
sured the continued implementation of 
our 2018 farm bill programs, which do 
provide certainty and predictability at 
a time when both are scarce. 
We also provided additional resources 
for 
telemedicine, 
broadband 
connectivity, as well as business and 
industry loans. The CARES Act also 
supplied the Department with the re-
sources to continue mandatory inspec-
tion services to ensure our food safety 
and minimize potential interruption in 
the food supply chain. 
COVID–19 created a ripple effect that 
has been felt from the farm to the su-
permarket. The agriculture and food 
sector, along with the administration, 
the CDC, and OSHA have all imple-
mented practices and policies that ad-
dress worker health and safety in our 
processing plants. Keeping America’s 
meat and poultry processing system 
functional was imperative—it was dif-
ficult, but we are making progress—as 
was boosting worker safety and protec-
tion in these plants. 
Now we must take what lessons we 
have learned in the past few months 
and build upon this progress. 
I am privileged to be the chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry. I have worked 
on the role of addressing rural Amer-
ica’s priorities as part of a fourth 
COVID–19 relief package, as have all 
members of the committee, both Dem-
ocrat and Republican. 
This week, we are considering legis-
lation with the hopes of a bipartisan 
solution. We all know and we antici-
pate this process will go through sev-
eral twists and turns before a final 
agreement is reached, but we must pro-
vide solutions. The entire country is 
truly counting on us. 
In closing, I want to again thank our 
farmers, our ranchers, and our growers 
all across the country who have contin-
ued to do their job during these very 
difficult times, and I want them to 
know that we are continuing to work 
to make sure they have the tools need-
ed to continue to feed not only our 
country but a very troubled and hun-
gry world. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as 
we debate the need for additional 
coronavirus 
relief 
funding, 
I 
am 
pleased to join my colleagues in com-
mending the millions of Americans 
who have gone above and beyond to 
help others during this pandemic. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, ev-
eryday heroes emerge in times of tur-
moil to aid their neighbors in so many 
ways. The COVID–19 pandemic is no ex-
ception. In every corner of my State, 
Mississippi’s 
first 
responders 
and 
healthcare providers are historically 
stepping into harm’s way to provide 
care to patients affected by the virus. 
f 
REMEMBERING WILLIAM DAVID 
MARTIN 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
let me first honor the life of William 
David Martin, a paramedic with Amer-
ican Medical Response of Southwest 
Mississippi, serving on the frontlines of 
Mississippi’s healthcare as COVID–19 
began to spread. 
Sadly, in April, he passed away from 
complications due to the virus. Mr. 
Martin is a true hero and one example 
of the extent to which first responders 
and healthcare workers are working to 
overcome this national emergency. 
f 
COVID–19 HEROES 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
rural hospitals like King’s Daughters 
Medical Center in my hometown of 
Brookhaven have always been the 
backbone of healthcare in Mississippi. 
The work of the staff at these rural 
hospitals during the pandemic has been 
remarkable. 
Dedicated nurses like my friends 
Larue Lambert, Tammy Livingston, 
Misty Britt, Christina Miller, and their 
coworkers—which are so many—toil 
every day under heavy stress and 
heart-wrenching situations to care for 
patients and their families. They are 
lifesavers, and they are best friends to 
total strangers. They take on extra 
shifts and duties while doing what they 
can to keep morale up. They are 
healthcare heroes who are enduring ex-
treme conditions. 
Doctors like Dr. Jeff Ross are work-
ing through both physical and mental 
exhaustion. Yet they continue to do 
their job, selflessly managing the care 
of their fellow Mississippians. 
In the heavily affected Jackson met-
ropolitan area, the University of Mis-
sissippi Medical Center has brought its 
unique capabilities to bear. In the 
early days of the pandemic, its re-
search labs rushed to create its own in- 
house COVID test. And the UMC Na-
tional Telehealth Center of Excellence 
quickly 
ramped 
up 
technology 
to 
triage patients for testing and provide 
socially distanced care. 
I greatly admire UMC’s work with 
the Federal Government on best tele-
health practices during a pandemic. As 
potential treatments have emerged, 
UMC researchers and healthcare pro-
viders have stood up eight cutting-edge 
COVID clinical trials in their new clin-
ical trials unit. 
Our healthcare providers aren’t the 
only ones who have been working to 
protect the health of Mississippians. 
Industries across the State have quick-
ly pivoted to provide needed supplies to 
fight COVID–19. For example, distill-
eries like Wonderbird Spirits in Taylor, 
Cathead Distillery in Jackson, and 
Lazy Magnolia Brewery in Kiln made 
the quick decision to begin producing 
hand sanitizer early in the pandemic. 
Furniture companies, like Confortaire 
in Tupelo, stepped up to produce need-
ed PPE for the North Mississippi Med-
ical Center and our local schools. And 
Mississippi Prison Industries, a non-
profit that gives incarcerated individ-
uals the opportunity to be employed 
and gain work experience, is producing 
up to 15,000 masks and 7,000 isolation 
gowns per day. 
Since the start of this pandemic, I 
recognized that we are dealing with 
two 
emergencies. 
There 
is 
the 
healthcare emergency and the eco-
nomic emergency. I am proud of the 
many ways in which Mississippians are 
helping each other weather these dif-
ficult economic times. 
Mississippi bankers worked around 
the clock, 7 days a week, to help small 
businesses access the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loans. Our friend Brad 
Jones at the Bank of Franklin in Mead-
ville, MS, was so helpful in keeping me 
abreast of the needs of our local busi-
ness owners. Because of their efforts, 
Mississippi ranked No. 1 in the entire 
Nation in PPP loans, with nearly 50,000 
loans processed. This tireless work is 
helping small businesses stay open 
with their employees at work. 
Ensuring Mississippians have access 
to food has been a challenge. A Mis-
sissippian who has been a godsend to

many families is Andy Mercier, who 
leads Merchants Foodservice in Hat-
tiesburg. In partnership with the Mis-
sissippi Food Network, his 800 employ-
ees have remained on the payroll and 
worked to provide more than 100,000 
gallons of milk and nearly half a mil-
lion food produce boxes to those in 
need. 
These USDA Farmers to Families 
boxes filled with food products from 
Mississippi farmers and producers have 
sustained families and helped our hard- 
hit agricultural industry. 
In addition to efforts in the private 
sector, our churches and nonprofits 
across our State are also working tire-
lessly for Mississippians. St. James 
United Methodist Church in Columbus 
coordinated with a Delta catfish pro-
ducer to distribute five tons of Mis-
sissippi farm-raised catfish to those in 
need in the Golden Triangle region. 
Finally, I could not stand up here 
today and fail to mention our Mis-
sissippi teachers, especially as so many 
schools across our State are beginning 
the new academic year this month. 
Last spring, our teachers accepted 
the challenge and quickly transitioned 
their classrooms to a new kind of 
learning through technology and other 
socially distanced means. While those 
challenges continue as schools navi-
gate how best to serve students this 
fall, each and every one of our teachers 
will be in my prayers over the next few 
weeks. 
In every facet of our society, we have 
heroes standing up to help their neigh-
bors during unprecedented challenges. 
To all of the healthcare workers and 
first 
responders 
on 
the 
frontlines 
against this virus, to all the research-
ers racing to test treatments and de-
velop protocols, to all of the people 
making hand sanitizers and PPE to 
help prevent the spread of this virus, to 
all the bankers and small businesses 
working to keep people on the payroll, 
to all of our farmers, ranchers, food 
distributors, and grocery store workers 
keeping food on the store shelves and 
on our tables, to all of our churches 
and nonprofit organizations serving 
our communities, and to our teachers 
who are facing challenges they could 
have never imagined, from the bottom 
of my heart, I say thank you. Your he-
roic labors are noticed, and they are 
greatly appreciated. 
I yield the floor.

f 
COVID–19 HEROES 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleagues today—the Sen-
ator from Mississippi, the Senator from 
Kansas, and so forth—for coming down 
and spending just a little bit of time 
talking about the wonderful heroes we 
have in our home States, and we really 
do have so, so many of them. 
While the country is anxiously await-
ing Washington to come together and 
pass an updated COVID relief package, 
we are truly blessed to have everyday 
heroes back in our 50 States who are 
working around the clock to help out 
their neighbors. 
Essential workers haven’t taken a 
break. They have been keeping our 
country running—and not just during 
this global pandemic but every single 
day. I have heard, time and again, sto-
ries of Iowans helping Iowans. Folks 
are volunteering their time and their 
talents to serve their communities and 
ensure no one feels alone during this 
time of social distancing. 
When my friend Iowa Governor Kim 
Reynolds announced that there was a 
shortage of face masks to protect 
frontline workers, Iowans, including 
my own mother, started sewing. 
Deb Siggins of Lisbon, IA, has made 
more than 400 masks that she has do-
nated to a local hospital, her friends, 
and coworkers, the local fire depart-
ment, grocery store employees, and el-
derly patients. She has even turned a 
tree near her home into a ‘‘giving tree’’ 
decorated with her homemade masks 
for people to take, which she is con-
stantly updating. Deb plans to keep 
making the masks until they are no 
longer needed because she believes that 
sewing is her gift from God, which she 
can use to help others. 
Mary Shotwell of Des Moines wanted 
to give back to those helping her dur-
ing this pandemic. In ‘‘i-sew-lation,’’ as 
she describes it, Mary sewed masks for 
her entire neighborhood and healthcare 
workers at Broadlawns Medical Center. 
In addition to the demand for masks, 
there has also been an increased need 
for food, especially to feed our hungry 
kiddos. Linn-Mar teacher Carla Iron-
side, who hasn’t seen her students in 
the classroom since March, now sees 
some of them when they pick up meals 
at Feeding Lunches to Youth in Marion 
and Cedar Rapids, where she volun-
teers. Carla says the opportunity to 
serve these meals helps calm her anx-
ious mind, knowing her students are 
fed. She said: ‘‘I get to see their smiles 
. . . and it helps me, and I think it 
helps them.’’ 
But it is not just our wonderful 
teachers; students are doing their part 
too. Allie Stutting of Princeton, IA, 
who is a University of Iowa student, 
launched an effort to mobilize her 
peers to serve and protect those at 
heightened risk. Worried about the 
threat COVID posed to her grand-
parents and the elderly, Allie set up a 
network of young people called the 
Iowa City Errand-ers to get groceries 
and food, pick up prescriptions, and 
run other errands for older folks and 
others in need. Allie’s idea has inspired 
an army of over 400 volunteers—yes, 400 
volunteers, folks. 
The story of these everyday heroes 
continues. To keep those who are ven-
turing out safe, ambassadors from Op-
eration Downtown are walking around 
Des Moines, cleaning and sanitizing 
handrailings, door handles, parking 
meters, and other high-touch surfaces. 
Julie Skalberg, an Operation Down-
town ambassador, explains that it is an 
effort to help folks feel secure during 
what can be a very scary time. 
Despite the potential risk, Cynthia 
Allen—another Operation Downtown 
ambassador—says she feels that it is an 
honor to give back to our community. 
Folks, the actions of these and many, 
many others like them who are pitch-
ing in and doing their part are exam-
ples of what I like to call ‘‘Iowa Nice.’’ 
For each of them, serving others is not 
a chore but, rather, a gift greeted with 
gratitude. 
At a time filled with immeasurable 
uncertainty, these heartland heroes are 
bringing comfort to their communities, 
including complete strangers, many 
who are isolated and alone. 
Defeating this virus will require the 
development of an effective vaccine, 
and Iowa is helping to lead the way in 
this effort. Right now, the hard-work-
ing folks at the University of Iowa’s 
Medical School are working with Pfizer 
to develop a COVID–19 vaccine. In the 
annual 
Defense 
bill 
that 
recently 
passed the Senate, I helped increase 
funding for these types of studies and 
developments. 
The efforts of our bright young Iowa 
college students, combined with the 
work of Operation Warp Speed and the 
administration, provide great hope for 
the future development of cures, treat-
ments, and vaccines. Now, as we wait 
for the results, let’s not forget the hope 
that the stories of our everyday COVID 
heroes bring. It is the Iowa way: step-
ping up and doing your part—meeting 
the needs of family, friends, and even 
strangers. 
Folks, I have said it before, and I will 
say it yet once again here today: We 
will get through these challenging 
times, and we will do it together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
come to the floor again today to speak 
about an obscure section of immigra-
tion law that has a direct impact on 
the lives of literally millions of people 
living and working in the United 
States. I am here to speak about the 
plight of immigrant workers who are 
suffering because of a serious problem 
in our immigration system, known as 
the green card backlog. Many of these 
immigrants are essential workers help-
ing to lead the fight against COVID–19. 
We have just heard tributes on the 
floor to these healthcare heroes from 
Senators on the other side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4900 
August 5, 2020 
This green card backlog, which I 
speak to, puts them and their families 
at risk of losing their immigration sta-
tus and being deported from the United 
States. Under current law, there are 
not nearly enough immigrant visas— 
also known as green cards—available 
each year. As a result, many immi-
grants are stuck in crippling backlogs 
for years, waiting and praying for the 
moment when their number comes up. 
Close to 5 million future Americans 
are in line, waiting for these green 
cards, including 1 million immigrant 
workers and their families. Despite 
this number—5 million—there are only 
226,000 family green cards and 140,000 
employment green cards available each 
year. 
These backlogs are really hard on 
families. They are caught in immigra-
tion limbo. What happens to the chil-
dren is particularly awful. Children in 
many of these families age out while 
the parents are waiting for the green 
cards. What does that mean? They 
reach the age of 21, and then these chil-
dren, as adults, face deportation be-
cause they are no longer under the age 
of 21 by the time the green cards are 
available. 
The solution to the green card back-
log is so clear: Increase the number of 
green cards. I have introduced legisla-
tion known as the RELIEF Act with 
Senator PAT LEAHY and Senator MAZIE 
HIRONO. The RELIEF Act would in-
crease the number of green cards to 
clear the backlogs for all immigrants 
waiting in line for green cards within 5 
years. The RELIEF Act would protect 
aging out children who qualify for a 
green card based on the parents’ immi-
gration petition. 
This RELIEF Act is not new; it is 
based on the bipartisan 2013 Com-
prehensive Immigration Reform bill. I 
know a little bit about it. That bill was 
written by eight Senators, and I was 
one of them—four Democrats, four Re-
publicans. We worked for months. We 
took the bill through the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. We faced 200 amend-
ments, I believe, and then brought it to 
the floor, subject to even more amend-
ments. At the end of the day, that bill 
passed with a strong bipartisan vote of 
68 to 32 on the floor of the Senate. But 
Republicans, who controlled the House 
of Representatives, refused to even 
consider this comprehensive immigra-
tion bill. If they had, we wouldn’t be 
here today. That bill and the provi-
sions we added to it eliminated the 
green card backlog. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
my 
col-
leagues on the Republican side are still 
unwilling to increase the number of 
immigrant visas even by one. They 
want to keep these immigrant workers 
on temporary visas where they are at 
risk of losing their immigration status 
and being deported. 
The senior Senator from Utah, Mr. 
LEE, introduced a bill, S. 386, known as 
the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act, to address the green card 
backlog. I have a basic concern with 
Senator LEE’s bill. S. 386 includes no— 
no—additional green cards. 
Without additional green cards, S. 
386 will not reduce the green card back-
log. Don’t take it from me; listen to 
the 
nonpartisan 
Congressional 
Re-
search Service. Here is what they say 
about Senator LEE’s legislation: ‘‘S. 386 
would not reduce future backlogs com-
pared to current law.’’ 
This is not a partisan group; it is the 
nonpartisan 
Congressional 
Research 
Service. S. 386 would not reduce future 
backlogs. 
Despite my concerns about Senator 
LEE’s bill, I told him I was willing to 
sit down and work in good faith to see 
if there was something we could agree 
on. Last December, we reached an 
agreement—a good one. 
Republicans object to increasing the 
number of green cards, and, as a result, 
even our agreement—the amendment 
we agreed to—wouldn’t reduce the 
green card backlog. But it was a good 
bill that we proposed. 
Let me highlight two key provisions 
of this agreement. We protect immi-
grants and their families stuck in the 
backlog. Immigrant workers and their 
immediate family members would be 
allowed to ‘‘early file’’ for their green 
cards. This was a proposal from Sen-
ator LEE that I thought was good and I 
was willing to support. That doesn’t 
mean they would receive their green 
cards early, but they would be able to 
switch jobs and travel without losing 
their immigration status. That, to me, 
was only sensible. 
Early filing adds a critical protection 
that was not in Senator LEE’s original 
bill. It prevents the children of immi-
grant workers from aging out of green 
card eligibility so they will not face de-
portation while they are waiting for a 
green card. 
Our agreement also would crack 
down on the abuse of H1–B temporary 
work visas. The amendment we agreed 
to would prohibit a company from hir-
ing additional H1–B workers if the 
company’s workforce were more than 
50 employees and more than 50 percent 
of them were temporary workers. 
These shell companies were created 
for outsourcing Americans jobs and 
abusing the H1–B visa process. I know 
because 
Senator 
GRASSLEY—Repub-
lican of Iowa—and I introduced this re-
form years and years ago when this 
abuse became so obvious. It targets the 
top recipients of H1–B visas, which are 
outsourcing companies that use loop-
holes in the law to exploit immigrant 
workers and to offshore American 
workers’ jobs. 
Two weeks ago, I came to the floor of 
the Senate to ask that we pass this 
agreement. Unfortunately, at that mo-
ment, Senator LEE objected. Instead, 
he offered a revised version of our De-
cember agreement, including changes 
that are required by the Trump admin-
istration. 
First, Senator LEE wants to remove a 
provision known as the hold harmless 
clause. That assured immigrants who 
are already waiting for a green card— 
sometimes for years—would not lose 
their place in line because Congress 
changed the rules in the middle of the 
game. 
Second, Senator LEE wanted to delay 
for 3 years the effective date of this 50– 
50 rule to crack down on outsourcing 
companies. I don’t believe we should 
give these companies that are out-
sourcing American jobs and exploiting 
immigrant workers a free pass for 3 
years. 
Third, Senator LEE wanted to delay 
for years early filing for people who are 
stuck in the green card backlog. Any 
children who would age out in the 
meantime would lose their chance for a 
green card and be subject to deporta-
tion. 
Those changes suggested by the Sen-
ator from Utah were unacceptable, but 
because there are so many lives at 
stake here, families at stake here—and 
I know the intensity of emotion behind 
this issue—I was determined to keep 
working to see if we could find some 
common ground. 
Last Tuesday, I sent Senator LEE an-
other compromise offer. The Senate 
Republican leader is planning to recess 
the Senate in a few days, so I thought 
it was important to come to the floor 
today to try to pass this proposal be-
fore the Senate convenes. 
Let me be clear. This isn’t how we 
are supposed to make laws in the Sen-
ate. Last year, I sent a letter—joined 
by every Democrat on the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee—to the senior Sen-
ator from Texas, JOHN CORNYN, chair of 
the Immigration Subcommittee. We 
asked for the regular order of business 
in the Senate, which so seldom occurs 
now. We asked Senator CORNYN, as 
chair 
of 
the 
Immigration 
Sub-
committee, to hold a hearing on this 
complicated legislation that addresses 
the green card backlog. We wanted 
them to include in the hearing consid-
eration of Senator LEE’s bill and my 
legislation, the RELIEF Act. We re-
quested a hearing with witnesses, a 
markup, a bill, a vote in the com-
mittee, and a vote on the floor. It is al-
most like something called the U.S. 
Senate used to be. This would help the 
Senate 
to 
understand, 
during 
the 
course of this hearing and debate, the 
impact of each of these proposals and 
to pass legislation that would actually 
fix the backlog. That really is how the 
Senate used to work. I know it is hard 
for newer Members to believe it. 
The Immigration Subcommittee is 
certainly not too busy to take up this 
hearing. For this session of Congress, 
which began a year and a half ago, the 
Immigration Subcommittee of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee has held one 
hearing—one. 
Unfortunately, Senator CORNYN
re-
jected our request. This leaves me no 
other option but to bring this proposal 
directly to the Senate floor. 
Let me explain what my amendment 
would do. 
First, it would ensure that the chil-
dren of immigrant workers do not age

out while waiting for a green card. This 
provision would not increase the num-
ber of green cards. It would not provide 
any special benefits. It would simply 
allow children of immigrant workers to 
keep their place in line for a green card 
and to be protected from deportation 
until they can get their green card. 
Second, my amendment would delay 
the bill section that changes the dis-
tribution of green cards by 1 year. This 
provision, which Senator LEE actually 
proposed earlier this year, would not 
replace the hold-harmless provision; 
however, it would allow processing 
time for immigrants with pending ap-
plications to get their green cards. 
Third, my amendment would allow 
for immediate implementation of the 
50–50 H–1B visa rule. I was told that the 
purpose of delaying it 3 years was to 
protect those currently working for 
these companies. So instead of the 3- 
year delay, my amendment would ex-
empt renewals for current H–1B em-
ployees, which gives current employees 
the chance to apply for early filing 
without creating a loophole for out-
sourcing firms. 
What I offered Senator LEE
after 
months and months of deliberation and 
negotiation was a good-faith effort to 
find common ground. There are so 
many lives at stake. So many families 
are following this debate because it lit-
erally will decide the fate of each of 
these individuals who are applying for 
the green cards and members of their 
family. 
It is heartbreaking to meet these 
families who have been waiting for 
years for a green card and to realize 
that the limitations of our system 
today make it so difficult. Many of 
these are good, hard-working people in 
America who are doing the right thing. 
In my hometown of Springfield, IL, 
there are physicians whom I have met 
and talked to personally who have 
driven hundreds of miles to plead their 
case with me. This one physician 
brought his young daughter; I think 
she was about 12 years old. I haven’t 
forgotten her to this day. She traveled 
200 miles to beg me to try to help. That 
is why I came in with this amendment 
in an effort to protect her and give her 
family a chance to be part of America’s 
future. 
I will now request unanimous con-
sent to pass my amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Judiciary Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
of H.R. 1044 and the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; further, 
that the Durbin substitute amendment 
at the desk be considered agreed to; the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time and passed; and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I want to thank and 
appreciate the work done by my friend, 
my distinguished colleague, the senior 
Senator from Illinois. 
Senator DURBIN and I have worked on 
many issues. We spent a lot of time 
working on this particular bill. In our 
most recent round of negotiations, he 
made a number of suggestions, and we 
incorporated many of those. I wish we 
could incorporate all of them. 
For the reasons that I gave a couple 
of weeks ago when we went through 
this, there are some of them that I un-
fortunately can’t agree to because they 
would result in our inability to pro-
ceed. On that basis, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we are living 
in some really unprecedented times. 
The economic impact of this global 
pandemic on our Nation, our people, 
and our communities has been nothing 
short of devastating. Within weeks of 
the start of this pandemic, we went 
from being one of the best economies 
that the world has ever seen to some of 
the deepest levels of unemployment we 
have ever seen. 
While the unemployment rate im-
proves each month, countless Ameri-
cans are still suffering from business 
closures, from layoffs, and from fur-
loughs. 
Ultimately, the best economic stim-
ulus we can offer in this hour of need is 
to foster opportunities for Americans 
to find meaningful work and to achieve 
economic independence. We have to en-
sure that our immigration system does 
not punitively disadvantage our own 
citizens from working in their chosen 
field, does not create unnecessary ob-
stacles to achieving economic inde-
pendence, and that it does not unnatu-
rally depress wages. 
I echo President Trump’s bold call to 
put America’s interests first as we 
work toward economic recovery. 
During this economic crisis, the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority, a federally 
owned entity, made the decision to fur-
lough its American workers and re-
place them with contractors who rely 
on work-based immigrant labor. Many 
of these same outsourcing companies 
are able to conduct operations for far 
less money because they pay immi-
grant workers below market wages and 
require them to work, in some cir-
cumstances, under terrible conditions. 
It was never the intention of any em-
ployment-based visa program to crowd 
out American workers in this way or to 
allow for the exploitation of legal im-
migrant workers. I fully support Presi-
dent Trump in making that clear in his 
actions earlier this week. 
Let me be clear. This legislation, S. 
386, Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act, does not add a single green 
card or additional visa to the current 
numbers. No. It only lifts the per-coun-
try caps on applications for green cards 
for immigrants who are already here. 
So it doesn’t add to the number; it just 
lifts this artificial, arbitrary per-coun-
try cap. 
In times of high unemployment, if we 
need to reform other work-based immi-
gration programs that protect Amer-
ican workers, let’s do it. If we need to 
end the optional practical training pro-
gram to ease the burden on American 
graduates entering the economy, let’s 
do it. If we need to reform the H–1B 
program and make significant reduc-
tions in the number of work-based im-
migrants who come into this country, 
let’s talk about that. 
I support these reforms, and that is 
why I worked with Senators GRASSLEY 
and DURBIN, among so many others in 
this body, to add significant reforms to 
the H–1B program, to the Fairness for 
High-Skilled Immigrants Act. This in-
cludes a reduction in the number of 
work-based visa holders that any one 
company may lawfully sponsor. This 
reform, included at Senator DURBIN’s 
request, is a good one, and it aims to 
protect not only American workers but 
immigrants as well by significantly 
curbing the system that allows for 
both the exploitation of visa holders 
and the depression of wages for all em-
ployees in a given sector. Its passage 
into law will increase the opportunity 
for Americans to compete for these po-
sitions. 
The bill also includes provisions 
strengthening the Department of La-
bor’s ability to enforce and investigate 
claims that employers are providing 
less than fair wages and working condi-
tions for immigrant workers, requiring 
employers to disclose more informa-
tion regarding their H–1B hiring prac-
tices and ensuring that employers may 
not use other visas to circumvent the 
H–1B caps. 
We must put Americans first. These 
provisions seek to do just that. Unless 
we are willing to completely end the 
work-based visa programs, we have an 
obligation to ensure they are adminis-
tered and allocated in accordance with 
the principles that we espouse as 
Americans. 
My goal in sponsoring this legisla-
tion many years ago—nearly a decade 
ago, in fact—was simply to bring some 
equity into this system. 
I have always been struck by the fact 
that the government has conditioned a 
benefit—in this case, a green card and 
a pathway to citizenship, given that 
this is a series of immigrant visa pro-
grams at issue—based solely on the ap-
plicants’ country of origin. 
There may have been some legiti-
mate reason many decades ago, in fact, 
for this. I almost can’t think of what 
those legitimate reasons might have 
been. Regardless, this has led to a sys-
tem that largely discriminates against 
green card applicants from one coun-
try—and I mean literally one country. 
This is inconsistent with our founding 
principles. This is not how we try to do 
things as Americans. And it is not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4902 
August 5, 2020 
Today, if you are a work-based immi-
grant from India entering into the EB– 
2 green card application process, you 
will wait almost 200 years before your 
application is even considered solely 
because of where you were born—al-
most 200 years on a waiting list. Some 
people don’t even live that long. Our 
country isn’t much older than that. 
Yet that is the amount of time they 
would have to wait based solely on the 
basis of the country in which they were 
born. If you are born anywhere else— 
anywhere else other than China; say in 
Ghana, Sweden, Indonesia—basically 
any other country other than India, 
your application will be considered im-
mediately. 
This sort of discrimination is simply 
inconsistent with the principles of an 
America-based 
immigration 
system 
and with our founding principles and 
the principles that unite us as Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Judiciary Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
and the Senate now proceed to H.R. 
1044; further, that the Lee amendment 
at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator 
from Utah for his response to my pro-
posal. My staff reviewed his amend-
ment yesterday. We quickly reviewed 
the language, and I would like to share 
my reactions. 
Senator LEE does not include my lan-
guage to protect children of immigrant 
workers from aging out during the 
delay in early filing because of objec-
tions on his side of the aisle. I am dis-
appointed. 
Senator 
LEE’s 
amendment 
would 
modify my proposal to allow imme-
diate implementation of the 50–50 rule, 
so the rule would go into effect after 
180 days. 
Senator LEE would also provide that 
current H–1B employees may continue 
to change employers. My purpose is to 
prevent outsourcing from continuing 
to exploit the H–1B visa program by 
hiring new H–1B employees. Senator 
LEE’s language would not allow these 
companies to import new H–1B workers 
to exploit, so that is not objectionable 
to me. Senator LEE’s amendment also 
accepts my proposal to delay by 1 year 
the bill section changing the distribu-
tion of green cards to allow processing 
time for pending applications. 
To sum up, this amendment cur-
rently being considered, for which 
unanimous consent has been asked, in-
cludes several key provisions I have ad-
vocated for that were not in Senator 
LEE’s original bill, including early fil-
ing to protect immigrant workers and 
their families who are stuck in the 
backlog; an annual green card set-aside 
for immigrant workers who are ineli-
gible for early filing because they are 
overseas; a 1-year delay in section 2 of 
the bill to protect immigrant workers 
with pending green card applications; 
and the 50–50 rule to protect American 
jobs and workers and to prevent the ex-
ploitation 
of 
immigrant 
workers, 
which helped to create the green card 
backlog. 
Therefore, I am prepared to accept 
this amendment in the spirit of bipar-
tisan compromise. I will not object to 
Senator LEE’s request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
in reserving the right to object, I fully 
appreciate the hard work my col-
leagues have put into this measure. 
Florida is an immigration State, and 
we value our diversity. 
We also need to fix our immigration 
system so it makes sense. That starts 
with securing our border. I have heard 
from many of my constituents about 
this bill because it impacts so many 
people in my State, including those 
who came to Florida from Latin Amer-
ica. We also have to help those who are 
escaping Communist China’s crack-
down on freedoms in Taiwan and Hong 
Kong. 
I offer an amendment today to make 
sure we are not creating an unfair sys-
tem that favors certain nations or that 
would disadvantage immigrants who 
don’t happen to be from the nations 
that are the largest drivers of the em-
ployment-based visa backlog that we 
see today. I know my colleagues share 
my desire to preserve the diversity of 
our Nation, and I look forward to their 
accepting my amendment today. 
Therefore, I ask that the Senator 
from Utah modify his request, include 
my amendment to the Lee amendment 
at the desk; that the amendment be 
considered and agreed to; that the Lee 
amendment, as amended, be agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Utah so modify his re-
quest? 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in reserving 
the right to object, Senator SCOTT’s 
proposed 
amendment, 
to 
be 
clear, 
would create a carve-out for people 
based on the languages they speak. 
Now, unless their language skills are 
somehow part of the analysis deter-
mining whether or not they qualify for 
employment-based immigrant visas, I 
do not see that making a carve-out for 
particular languages would be con-
sistent with our immigration rules or 
with principles of fairness or of equity. 
Amendments like this one that pur-
port to carve out groups of people 
based on their nationalities or their 
ethnicities or their native languages 
are antithetical to the type of equi-
table change we have been pursuing 
with this bill for years. When we look 
at this, it operates quite broadly. He is 
trying to create a carve-out for people 
who are native speakers of Spanish, 
Portuguese, 
Haitian, 
Creole, 
Can-
tonese, Taiwanese, Hokkien, or Hakka, 
for those who have attained a master’s 
degree or higher in the aforementioned 
languages, or for people who are 
spouses or children of the people on the 
aforementioned list. There are a lot of 
people who have been identified there. 
Interestingly enough, this doesn’t in-
clude other languages. I haven’t heard 
any principled basis upon which we 
could differentiate between those two. 
So it seems to me that, in fixing one 
problem, we reinsert this amendment 
in there and give preferential treat-
ment to people who, by the way, are 
not speakers of Hindi or of Urdu or of 
other languages that are commonly 
spoken in India. I don’t understand the 
principled distinction between these 
language speakers and others. 
More fundamentally, this undermines 
and contravenes the fundamental pur-
pose of this legislation, which is to say 
that, regardless of what other factors 
you might take into account when de-
ciding how you are going to allocate 
employment-based green cards, the one 
thing we shouldn’t look to and that no 
longer makes any sense to look to—to 
the extent it ever made sense to begin 
to look to, which it probably didn’t—is 
the country of origin. This makes no 
sense, and it is wrong. 
Therefore, 
I 
cannot 
support 
the 
amendment offered by my colleague 
Senator SCOTT, and I object to its adop-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
in reserving the right to object, clear-
ly, I am disappointed that my col-
league is unwilling to accept my 
amendment. 
My goal is to be fair to the many 
wonderful and skilled people who want 
to build lives in our great country. I 
have also spoken to those at the White 
House about the bill, and they have 
agreed we need more time to review 
the proposal and to understand its im-
pacts on our immigration system. 
I hope my colleagues want to con-
tinue to work together, and I hope we 
can find a path forward to address the 
current visa backlog. Therefore, I re-
spectfully object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I go back to 
the question I asked rhetorically a mo-
ment ago. 
What is it about the speakers of 
these languages that are mentioned in 
the amendment offered by my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the junior 
Senator from Florida—that is, the na-
tive speakers or speakers who hold a 
degree in the languages of Spanish, 
Portuguese, 
Haitian, 
Creole, 
Can-
tonese, 
Taiwanese, 
Hokkien, 
or 
Hakka—that makes them more deserv-
ing of an allocation of an employment-

based immigrant visa than the speak-
ers of Hindi, of Urdu, or of any of the 
languages spoken in India? 
As I mentioned a moment ago, you 
have a real problem, a real inequity. 
Overwhelmingly, the per-country cap 
punishes would-be immigrants from 
India in a way that doesn’t affect any 
others, except maybe some from China. 
By the way, he covers some of the lan-
guage groups spoken in and around 
China, including Cantonese and Tai-
wanese. So why not Mandarin? Then, if 
Mandarin, why not any of the lan-
guages spoken in India? 
This cuts right to the heart of why it 
is we need this reform and why it is we 
have an Elvis Presley-era, outdated, 
outmoded, unwise, and fundamentally 
inequitable 
immigration 
code—one 
that is at odds with the way our immi-
gration system works. 
Imagine two otherwise identical ap-
plicants for a visa, wherein they are ex-
actly the same in all respects—those 
being their academic degrees they have 
earned, their employment experience, 
their background checks, their family 
statuses, their earning potential, their 
job commitment, and professional cer-
tifications. Imagine they are identical 
in every single respect except for one— 
that immigrant A happens to hail from 
Sweden and that immigrant B happens 
to have been born in India. Immigrant 
A will be eligible to have an employ-
ment-based immigrant visa application 
considered immediately. Immigrant B, 
simply by virtue of having come from 
India, will, in many circumstances, 
have to be on a waiting list for 200 
years. This is wrong. 
I really would like, one day, for 
someone—anyone—to explain to me 
why it makes any sense to leave this 
law on the books. One can’t. One will 
not because there is no good reason for 
doing so. If one can’t and if one will 
not, why on Earth would you want to 
weaken something and dilute some-
thing to create special privileges to 
one group of would-be employment- 
based green card holders simply be-
cause they happen to come from yet 
another preferred country over the 
nonpreferred, 
discriminated-against 
country? This is wrong. 
We have to get this thing passed. I 
am so grateful to DICK DURBIN and the 
work that he has done with me on this. 
I am grateful to my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have put together 
this bipartisan bill. I believe we are 
close. I believe we are very close. I in-
tend and plan and fully commit in the 
coming days to keep pushing this. This 
issue isn’t going away. We are going to 
get this thing passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am dis-
appointed. After all of these months of 
negotiation and of the emotion, inten-
sity, and feelings that we share for the 
people who are caught in this backlog, 
it is a real disappointment that, at the 
last moment, the Senator from Florida 
exercised his right as a Senator to ob-
ject to our unanimous consent re-
quest—a request which I was prepared 
to accept. 
May I suggest that this is an illustra-
tion of the bottom line that I raised in 
my statement. In being stuck with a 
140,000-limit on green cards for employ-
ment visas and country caps for that 
140,000 limit, we will continue to run 
into the problem illustrated by the 
Senator from Florida. 
There will be those who will want to 
create an exception to the overall 
quota or the country caps, and there 
will be compelling, personal, and fam-
ily reasons for them to ask for it. Time 
and again, they will find that, if they 
get a privilege, it will be at the expense 
of someone else, and there will be an 
objection. 
The only rational answer is to raise 
the cap on the green card quotas. These 
140,000 employment-based visas a year 
might have made sense 30 or 40 years 
ago. They make no sense today in the 
world that we live in. We are talking 
about people in the United States who 
are working, who are trying to make 
lives here of a more permanent nature. 
They love this country enough to want 
to bring their families here—to relo-
cate and live. They are working here 
and contributing in the computer in-
dustry, in healthcare, and in so many 
different areas. They are valuable and 
important to the future of America. 
I sincerely hope that we can resolve 
the issue that was brought up on the 
floor today. Equally important, if not 
more important, I hope that we will 
have the will on a bipartisan basis to 
tackle comprehensive immigration re-
form. We did it 7 years ago. We passed 
it 7 years ago. It can be done with Sen-
ators of good faith and good will who 
will work together. Yet it will mean 
you will have to accept the premise 
that there may be one additional, new 
immigrant coming to America. Some 
people cannot stomach that, and they 
object to any effort to change immi-
gration laws that might result in an 
additional immigrant. 
This son of an immigrant, who hap-
pens to be a U.S. Senator, believes that 
immigration defines this country, that 
our diversity defines this country, and 
that bringing people here who are will-
ing to sacrifice and risk everything to 
be part of America’s future is part of 
the reason we have prospered as a na-
tion. 
I hope that Senators on both sides of 
the aisle will have the good sense to 
come to that conclusion and that, at 
another time, with another Congress 
and, perhaps, with another President, 
we will have a meaningful and fair- 
minded conversation. 
In the meantime, I will work with 
Senator LEE to resolve the differences 
that we have, which are now down to 
only a handful. As evidenced today, I 
believe 
we 
have 
made 
dramatic 
progress. We are disappointed by the 
result, but we are not giving up. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as our 
Nation’s war against the coronavirus 
wages on, negotiations on the next re-
lief package seem to remain at a stand-
still. 
The bolstered unemployment bene-
fits provided by the CARES Act have 
expired. Principals and teachers—and 
parents, I might add—are preparing to 
begin the school year without adequate 
funding for the protective measures 
they need, and additional investments 
into vaccines and treatments are des-
perately needed. 
I believe the Senate should stay in 
session until we are able to pass an-
other 
coronavirus 
relief 
bill, 
but 
Speaker PELOSI and Senate Minority 
Leader SCHUMER
seem to have zero 
sense of urgency in delivering the sup-
port those in our country need, includ-
ing their own constituents, and they 
have zero interest, apparently—at least 
so far—in a bipartisan compromise. 
Despite the less-than-enthusiastic in-
terest from their own Members and a 
flatout veto threat from the White 
House, they continue to push the more 
than $3 trillion Heroes Act as a solu-
tion to the crisis. 
Remember, this is legislation that 
was so unpopular among Democrats 
that it barely managed to pass the 
House earlier this summer, and it in-
cludes 
extraneous 
items, 
like 
tax 
breaks for millionaires and billionaires 
who live in blue States and diversity 
studies for the marijuana industry. 
It doesn’t take a policy expert to see 
that these portions of the bill have ab-
solutely nothing to do with the crisis 
at hand, and they demonstrate how 
unserious Speaker PELOSI and Demo-
crats in the House have been and, un-
fortunately, now joined by some of our 
colleagues here in the Senate—how 
unserious they are about actually solv-
ing this problem to the best of our abil-
ity. 
They even go so far as to call that 
particular piece of legislation, the He-
roes Act, a messaging document. Well, 
that messaging document helps abso-
lutely zero people. It is a wish list, a 
pipedream, and it is an effort to try to 
appease the most radical Members of 
the Democratic caucus. 
Though Speaker PELOSI says the title 
of this legislation is a tribute to our 
healthcare workers, it is really a cruel 
joke. The bill itself does nothing to 
protect them from one of the biggest 
threats lurking around the corner. 
We are already beginning to see evi-
dence that the coronavirus pandemic is 
moving from hospitals to courtrooms, 
as lawyers have filed lawsuits against 
our essential healthcare workers and 
any institution that has kept its doors 
open throughout this crisis. 
This is something that has come up 
in my conversations with many of my 
constituents in Texas over the last sev-
eral months—healthcare workers, edu-
cators, nonprofits, restaurant workers, 
child daycare centers, retailers—the 
list goes on and on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4904 
August 5, 2020 
They are worried about the carpet- 
bombing of opportunistic litigation. 
After all, these are some of the very 
same people we have said must show up 
for work, must continue to provide es-
sential goods and services to their com-
munities during this crisis. Now they 
are worried that we are going to throw 
them under the bus and make them 
subject to lawsuits for doing the best 
they could under very difficult cir-
cumstances. 
Well, we can already see the commer-
cials on TV or the billboards soliciting 
these lawsuits. The trial bar is pre-
pared to file lawsuits against doctors, 
nurses, teachers, small business own-
ers—anyone and everyone who might 
be able to pay a judgment or, more 
likely, who has an insurance policy. 
According to the law firm Hunton 
Andrews Kurth, nearly 4,000 claims 
have already been filed—more than 275 
in Texas—but we are also talking 
about circumstances under which the 
statute of limitations is 2 years. So 2 
years from the claimed incident, you 
could file a lawsuit. So this is just the 
tip of the iceberg. 
As our economy begins to reopen, so 
will the floodgates, and we need to 
take action now to prevent this tidal 
wave of litigation from wiping out the 
very workers, businesses, and institu-
tions we have been fighting to keep 
afloat. 
Leader MCCONNELL and I have intro-
duced the SAFE TO WORK Act to ad-
dress this issue and to prevent this 
trial lawyer bonanza from bringing 
even more harm to our country and to 
our economy. 
Unlike the unserious Heroes Act, this 
would give our healthcare workers ex-
actly the kind of support they need, 
but I want to make clear what this leg-
islation does and does not do. 
First, it is not a blanket shield from 
liability. It will not prevent bad actors 
from being held accountable. It will 
not 
prevent 
people 
from 
filing 
coronavirus lawsuits, and it will not 
give anyone a ‘‘get out of jail free’’ 
card. 
In cases of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, where applicable public 
health guidelines were ignored, the per-
son bringing the claim has every right 
to sue and to be made whole, and we 
are not suggesting any change to that. 
What we do need to do, though, is put 
some safeguards in place to help those 
who were operating in good faith under 
uncertain circumstances, under some-
times changing guidance and direction, 
even though they were trying to follow 
all of the relevant guidelines. 
That includes protections for non-
profits that have gone above and be-
yond to support their communities, as 
the demand for their services has sky-
rocketed. It includes the schools, the 
colleges, the universities that are pre-
paring to take every conceivable pre-
caution to keep students and teachers 
safe this fall. It includes the hospitals 
that have been on the frontlines and 
have fought significant headwinds to 
keep their staff, their patients, and 
their communities safe. And, of course, 
it includes protections for our incred-
ible healthcare workers who have been 
on the frontlines of this crisis for 
months. 
Amid rapidly changing guidelines, 
staffing shortages, and scarce supplies 
of personal protective equipment, they 
continued to adapt and deliver the best 
possible care to their patients. 
Just to give you one example of how 
rapidly the guidelines are changing, in 
March, the Texas Health and Human 
Services Commission provided a man-
ual to nursing homes with guidance on 
managing and preventing a COVID–19 
outbreak. The manual was 28 pages 
long. Since then, it has nearly tripled 
in length. 
As we have learned more about this 
virus, guidelines have evolved, as you 
would hope they would, to ensure that 
our healthcare workers know the most 
effective ways to quarantine, test, and 
treat patients. That is an unequivo-
cally good thing. It is strengthening 
our response, it is helping us slow the 
spread of the virus, and it is savings 
lives. 
But it has also created a host of chal-
lenges for the healthcare workers who 
are the very ones complying with these 
rapidly changing guidelines, doing the 
best they can under difficult cir-
cumstances. 
I learned about an elderly patient 
who arrived at a hospital emergency 
room during the early stages of the 
pandemic with a fever but no other 
COVID–19 symptoms. 
At that point, testing supplies were 
constrained, and the applicable CDC 
protocol was to limit testing only to 
patients who met the strict criteria, 
who had symptoms. And with only a 
fever, this patient did not meet those 
criteria so he was not tested. 
The healthcare workers identified an 
infection site that could have been 
causing his fever, so they treated him 
and discharged him with instructions 
to return if his condition worsened. 
Several days later, unfortunately, his 
condition did worsen, and he went to a 
different hospital where he was given a 
COVID–19 test. The result came back 
positive, and ultimately he was admit-
ted to the intensive care unit. 
Then, several days later, he trag-
ically passed away from coronavirus- 
related symptoms. 
For the man’s family, I know this 
raises questions of how things might 
have been different today if he had 
been tested on that initial visit in the 
emergency room. They have said they 
may file a lawsuit against the physi-
cian and the hospital for not per-
forming a test and admitting the man 
to the hospital on the first visit. 
But the doctors there were simply 
following the best advice they had at 
the time and were constrained by the 
number of tests available—only to test 
patients when they had symptoms of 
the 
virus 
and, 
unfortunately, 
this 
man’s symptoms did not qualify. 
If the doctor and the hospital did the 
best they could following those guide-
lines, they should not be subjected to 
these types of litigation. 
Now, as I have said, the legislation 
would not provide blanket immunity. 
Nobody is arguing for that, but we do 
need clear guardrails to ensure that 
the dedicated healthcare workers and 
other essential workers who were act-
ing in good faith will not be drained 
dry by the trial bar. 
This legislation sets a willful mis-
conduct or gross negligence standard 
to ensure that only bona fide, legiti-
mate claims are brought against these 
healthcare workers. 
The patients subjected to that type 
of treatment have every right to sue 
and to be made whole, and this will 
preserve that basic right. But it will 
also make sure that the hard-working 
doctors, nurses, emergency medical 
technicians, and other medical profes-
sionals who have acted in good faith 
are not pulled into litigation that 
could send them into bankruptcy. 
Over the past several months, our 
healthcare workers have navigated the 
dark, treacherous, and rapidly chang-
ing waters of this storm to save as 
many lives as possible. 
I should point out that I think about 
30 States have, at the State level, pro-
vided 
the 
kind 
of 
protection 
to 
healthcare workers I am talking about. 
So we need to throw them a lifeline, 
not feed them to the sharks. Instead of 
naming 
a 
bill 
in 
honor 
of 
our 
healthcare heroes that does absolutely 
nothing to help them, as the House has 
done, let’s pass a bill that will honor 
them. 
If our friends across the aisle want to 
help our healthcare workers and thank 
them for their immeasurable sacrifices 
they have made, liability protection 
would do exactly that. 
So I hope our colleagues are prepared 
to acknowledge the widely known 
truth—that the Heroes Act is an 
unserious piece of legislation that has 
zero chance of becoming law. It is time 
to stop playing games and get serious 
about what our country needs at this 
critical moment. 
As negotiations on the next relief 
package continue, I would ask our col-
leagues to set aside the completely un-
related priorities in the Heroes Act and 
focus on the changes that need to be 
made to keep our healthcare and other 
essential workers safe but also to pro-
tect them from frivolous litigation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4905 
August 5, 2020 
I disagree with my colleague from 
Texas on a few of the descriptions of 
the bill that came over from the House, 
which I think the fact that the bill 
that was first introduced here in the 
Senate had only 20 percent of the fund-
ing for testing that the House bill had 
is very concerning, when you look at 
people waiting to get test results, the 
fact that there was no money to keep 
our elections safe. You can just go 
through line by line on the issues and 
the differences in the bill. 
But my interest today is not actually 
emphasizing those differences; it is how 
can we come together, what are the 
things we can agree on, and the fact 
that we cannot just pass a bandaid for 
the American people when we have 
learned that the GDP annualized is 
going to be down 30 percent, when we 
learned that so many people are losing 
their homes or being evicted, and so 
many are filing for unemployment. 
This is the time for action. 
Broadband, I would say, has been an 
issue, especially in rural America, for a 
long time, and having once traveled to 
Iceland and having seen how the Ice-
landers have high-speed internet at 
every corner of their country, despite 
the fact that they are a country of lava 
and volcanoes and volcanic ash, we can 
certainly do better. 
The problems I was hearing about for 
years that we tried to get at slowly but 
surely with access to internet have be-
come very clear to parents who are 
simply trying to make sure their chil-
dren are able to participate remotely 
in school. While other kids of other 
parents who happen to have high-speed 
internet are able to fully participate, 
others aren’t. Sometimes it is because 
of equipment, but oftentimes, in my 
State, it is because of a lack of access 
to high-speed internet. 
Stories of one girl in Southern Min-
nesota who had to take her biology 
test in a liquor store parking lot be-
cause that is where she could get the 
high-speed internet; the doctor—this is 
prepandemic—who could, yes, access x 
rays in the hospital, but if, late at 
night, he had to help a patient in a re-
mote area, he had to go to the McDon-
ald’s parking lot, drive in from his 
home, because he did not have access 
there. 
I thank Senator VAN
HOLLEN
for 
bringing us together this afternoon and 
for his work in organizing this time to 
focus attention on the pressing edu-
cation priorities in the relief bill. 
Access to broadband, as I just noted, 
has become more critical now than 
ever, as schools and workplaces are 
closed in an effort to limit the spread 
of the coronavirus, where teachers, 
many with preexisting conditions, sim-
ply cannot put themselves at risk, and 
where we know, going forward, we will 
continue to have a substantial number 
of kids learning remotely. 
As I said, even before the pandemic, 
one study found that about 42 million 
Americans nationwide lacked access to 
broadband. Reports have also found 
that only 66 percent of Black house-
holds, 61 percent of Latino households, 
and 63 percent of rural households have 
broadband at home of the quality that 
would allow them to work and to con-
duct their business and to participate 
in school and host a meeting in 
healthcare. 
In rural areas in my State, about 16 
percent of households lack broadband 
even at baseline speeds. That means we 
have 144,000 households that don’t have 
access to the internet. One of the sad-
dest stories I remember was a house-
hold in one of our Tribal areas that got 
and paid for their own high-speed inter-
net and the parents looked out the win-
dow and saw all these kids in their 
lawn, and that is because they were 
trying to get access to the internet 
from that one household to be able to 
do their homework. That was a story 
from Leech Lake Reservation. 
Many students have shifted to online 
and will continue distance learning, 
and we need to make sure that all kids 
can learn. That is why I wrote a letter 
to Senators PETERS and TESTER, urging 
the FCC to ensure that all K–12 stu-
dents have internet access to continue 
learning from home during this pan-
demic. Following the announcement of 
school closings in Minnesota and the 
remote learning, I worked with Sen-
ator SMITH to urge the FCC to ensure 
that Minnesota students have access to 
high-speed internet. 
I am grateful for Senator MARKEY’s 
leadership in ensuring students have 
the connectivity they need. I was proud 
to join him and 43 of our Democratic 
colleagues in the Senate to introduce 
the Emergency Educational Connec-
tions Act, to establish a fund at the 
FCC to help schools and libraries pro-
vide Wi-Fi hotspots or other connected 
devices to students without home 
internet access. This bill, in fact, as I 
think of the comments of my colleague 
from Texas—this bill was included in 
the Heroes Act that was passed by the 
House, and it is incredibly important 
that we have broadband capabilities in 
the bill that we pass in the Senate. 
It is not just K–12 students who need 
help connecting to the internet during 
this crisis. Colleges and universities 
across the country have also moved 
classes online, and many low-income 
students who rely on campus resources 
are struggling to continue their edu-
cation from home and are at serious 
risk of falling behind. 
I know for quite a while the White 
House was hoping this crisis would 
magically go away, with false claims of 
improved situations and false claims of 
chugging bleach and the like to make 
it go away, but, in fact, I would say the 
President was accurate a week or two 
ago in one way when he publicly said 
that this is going to get worse before it 
gets better. 
So the thought that we would allow 
these disparities to continue, where 
households 
cannot 
get 
high-speed 
internet, they are at a complete dis-
advantage, not just for a month—that 
might be OK—not just for 3 months but 
for a year and beyond when it comes to 
education. Little kids, first graders and 
second graders, when they are supposed 
to be learning to read, they can’t be 
apart from teaching for that long a pe-
riod of time without it having a major 
impact on their education. Again, that 
also includes higher education. Not 
every kid in a college or community 
college can afford high-speed internet. 
That is why I introduced the Sup-
porting Connectivity for Higher Edu-
cation Students in Need Act in May, 
with Senators HIRONO, PETERS, and 
ROSEN, that creates a fund at the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration to help ensure 
that college students with the greatest 
financial need can access critical inter-
net 
services 
and 
equipment 
like 
laptops and tablets. 
Our 
bill 
prioritizes 
Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal 
colleges and universities, Hispanic- 
serving institutions, and other minor-
ity-serving institutions, as well as 
rural-serving institutions. As we con-
tinue to confront this pandemic, ensur-
ing that students get internet from 
kindergarten and preschool on through 
college and the like is really impor-
tant. 
I have spoken with small broadband 
providers and superintendents across 
my State who have been working with 
school districts to connect students to 
the internet, going that extra mile to 
help, including providing free internet 
services and installing public Wi-Fi 
hotspots in their communities. They 
helped our kids, but we know we need 
better long-term solutions. 
That is why Senator CRAMER and I 
introduced the Keeping Critical Con-
nections Act to create a fund at the 
FCC to help small broadband providers 
continue to provide critical internet 
services. It has been my experience 
after many years in my State that 
many of these smaller providers on the 
ground are much quicker and do a bet-
ter job of keeping their promises and 
building out as opposed to some of the 
big telephone companies—or maybe 
they don’t see this as economical to 
reach these rural areas. I don’t think it 
is a surprise. So many of my colleagues 
have had the same experiences listen-
ing to people in the rural areas of their 
States that our bill will now have 34 
cosponsors, half Democrats, half Re-
publicans. It would put $2 billion in to 
work with small providers to give them 
the funding they need to expand imme-
diately out to these areas. 
I don’t want to hear another story 
like the high school student taking her 
biology exam in the liquor store park-
ing lot simply because she doesn’t have 
internet. 
We also need to make sure people 
know about existing resources that can 
help them connect to the internet. Due 
to job losses or reductions in income 
during the pandemic, millions of Amer-
icans are newly eligible for nutrition 
benefits and Medicaid and can also get

help 
connecting 
to 
the 
internet 
through FCC’s Lifeline Program to 
help low-income people connect. Some 
of these people have never been low in-
come and because of the pandemic they 
now are. According to FCC Commis-
sioner Starks, only about 7 million of 
the 38 million households that were eli-
gible for the Lifeline Program were en-
rolled. That is why in April I wrote a 
letter to Senator DURBIN
and Rep-
resentative MARCIA FUDGE of Ohio and 
ANNA ESHOO of California, along with 
140 Members of Congress, urging the 
FCC to work with the USDA and HHS 
to ensure that the millions of Ameri-
cans who are now eligible for SNAP are 
informed about their eligibility for the 
FCC’s Lifeline Program. As we work to 
bring high-speed internet to commu-
nities across the country, it is simply 
critical that we have a clear under-
standing of where broadband is avail-
able. 
My bipartisan bill with Chairman 
WICKER
and 
Senators 
PETERS
and 
THUNE to improve the accuracy of the 
FCC’s broadband maps was, in fact, 
signed into law in March. It was not 
soon enough for this pandemic, but we 
simply just hear: Hey, we have high- 
speed internet in our area, which I 
know Senators WICKER
and THUNE 
heard, just like I did, and in fact you 
go there and that isn’t true at all. That 
is why having these updated maps, as 
we look at not just what we are dealing 
with today but the day after tomor-
row—which is a metaphor for next year 
when the vaccine starts coming out, 
when things start going back to a place 
where people are out and about freely— 
well, we have to make sure that if we 
haven’t expanded to everyone with 
broadband at that moment, that we do 
it then, and to do that we need accu-
rate mapping. 
The last bill I wanted to mention is a 
bill that has passed the House, and that 
is Representative CLYBURN’s invest-
ment of $100 billion to build high-speed 
broadband 
infrastructure 
in 
under-
served areas, including rural areas, to 
expand affordable high-speed internet 
to everyone. I am the lead on the Sen-
ate version of that bill, and given that 
it has passed, it is a part of another 
piece of legislation, and it is something 
else we must be looking at as we move 
forward the next few months. 
We all depend on reliable broadband, 
and we must make sure that we get re-
liable broadband to all. I always be-
lieved 
that 
when 
we 
invest 
in 
broadband, we invest in opportunities 
for every American. 
If we could bring electricity to every-
one’s home, even the smallest farms in 
the middle of areas with very little 
population, we can do this in the mod-
ern era. Otherwise, we are going to 
continue with the haves and have-nots. 
It shouldn’t depend on your ZIP Code 
whether your kid can learn to read. It 
shouldn’t depend on where your ZIP 
Code is to figure out what their home-
work is the next day. It shouldn’t de-
pend on where your ZIP Code is to find 
out whether you are going to be able to 
virtually visit your mom and dad in 
the senior center because some places 
will have high-speed access that will 
allow us to do that and others won’t. It 
shouldn’t depend on your ZIP Code to 
figure out if you could actually have 
your doctor show you an x ray instead 
of going into a medical setting that 
maybe 
you 
don’t 
feel 
comfortable 
going into. 
All Americans should have access to 
high-speed internet. This pandemic has 
put a big magnifying glass on what has 
been a problem for many, many years, 
and it is time to act now. 
I yield the floor, and I again thank 
Senator VAN HOLLEN for bringing us to-
gether and thank Senator HASSAN from 
the State of New Hampshire for her 
leadership in bringing us together. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator KLOBUCHAR for her 
leadership in this area, and her capac-
ity to understand not only the policy 
that we need to address and change but 
also the practical impacts it will have 
on not only her constituents but people 
all over the United States of America. 
I want to thank Senator VAN HOLLEN 
as well for gathering us all this after-
noon to focus, as we need to, on the 
needs of our young people, our stu-
dents, their educators and their fami-
lies in these coming months. 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, in 
New Hampshire and all across the 
country, school supplies are lining the 
shelves of stores, but school board 
members, teachers, and parents are 
still wrestling with the decisions about 
what exactly this school year will look 
like. 
No matter if schools open fully re-
mote, fully in person or a hybrid of 
both, we have to do all we can to en-
sure that young people receive a qual-
ity education while also keeping stu-
dents, school faculty, and their fami-
lies safe. 
Just as schools are trying to make 
decisions, just as administrators, edu-
cators, and families are trying to fig-
ure out what this school year will look 
like in their communities, they have 
been met by a lack of resources and 
clear guidance from this administra-
tion and from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. 
We have known for months that 
schools would face enormous chal-
lenges this fall, and Federal delays 
have only made the situation more 
challenging across the country. 
For months, the Senate majority 
leader stalled action on an additional 
COVID–19 relief package, saying that 
he felt ‘‘no urgency.’’ But school dis-
tricts across this country have felt 
plenty of urgency. Instead of giving 
them time and appropriate resources to 
plan, Senator MCCONNELL kicked the 
can down the road. Now he has released 
a completely inadequate and unaccept-
able proposal that provides too few re-
sources to schools and would actually 
withhold aid if schools don’t fully re-
open in person. 
My Democratic colleagues and I have 
focused on an approach that would ac-
tually help schools navigate the year 
ahead. We proposed $430 billion to help 
schools implement public health proto-
cols, address the challenges of students 
who have fallen behind, and provide 
quality education to all students re-
gardless of how schools reopen. This 
proposal would help address some of 
the most pressing issues facing our stu-
dents. 
When I talk to educators back home 
in New Hampshire, a common theme I 
hear from students and educators is 
that they need more and better high- 
speed internet access to support online 
learning. This is a challenge both for 
remote and also in-person learning. For 
instance, last week, Kevin Carpenter, 
principal of Kennett High School in 
North Conway, told me that part of his 
school’s reopening plan requires ex-
panding broadband capacity at the 
school. This would enable students to 
access online materials in every class-
room and minimize the risk of spread-
ing COVID–19 by minimizing physical 
transitions from class to class. 
Other educators have noted that in 
many areas of our State, families are 
still having trouble accessing an ade-
quate broadband connection and de-
vices that can support online learning 
throughout the day at home. Just as 
Senator KLOBUCHAR referenced some of 
the conversations she has had in Min-
nesota, in a discussion I had in New 
Hampshire earlier this summer, a 
teacher in the Gilmanton School Dis-
trict said that some parents were tak-
ing their children to the parking lots of 
their school to do their schoolwork 
from the car because it was the only 
way they could access a Wi-Fi connec-
tion. 
Too many students are at risk of fall-
ing 
behind 
because 
they 
lack 
broadband access. Our proposal in-
cludes $4 billion in funding to help en-
sure that all K–12 students have ade-
quate home internet connectivity and 
devices during the pandemic, which is a 
priority that I have been fighting for 
throughout the last several months. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
support this proposal and to work with 
Democrats to deliver sufficient relief 
without any further delay. 
As we approach the upcoming school 
year, our families and educators are 
facing unprecedented, heart-wrenching 
uncertainty. Even in areas where the 
infection rates are low and schools are 
well-resourced, the lack of testing ca-
pacity and the lack of clear guidance 
from this administration, for example, 
on what to do if a teacher or a student 
tests positive for the virus are exacer-
bating the effects of this awful pan-
demic. Inaction and ineptitude are 
making a truly difficult set of chal-
lenges much, much worse, and at a cer-
tain point, inaction and ineptitude are 
indistinguishable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4907 
August 5, 2020 
Congress must address these needs so 
that our educators can overcome these 
immense challenges and do what they 
do best—help our children learn and 
grow. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank my colleague from New 
Hampshire, Senator HASSAN, for the 
important points she made about what 
is happening in New Hampshire. In lis-
tening to her, I think each of us could 
say that that holds true for our State. 
Certainly, what she says holds true in 
my State of Maryland. 
In Maryland, we are just weeks away 
from the opening day of school. In 
other parts of the country, schools 
have already reopened. 
I think all of us can remember back 
to when we were going back to school 
during our K–12 years. We had a mix of 
excitement and anxiety. And those of 
us who are parents with children 
shared the excitement and anxiety of 
our children as they went off to school. 
This year, we are facing a sense of 
emotions and realities that none of us 
has ever experienced before. I think all 
of us agree that we would like all stu-
dents to be able to return to actual 
classrooms as soon as safely possible. I 
hope we would all also agree that we 
want to make sure that in returning, 
we don’t put at risk those children, 
students, teachers, or others in the 
school community. 
We all agree that in-classroom in-
struction provides the best learning en-
vironment for students, but we should 
also agree that students should not be 
returning to classrooms if it will put 
them at greater risk to their lives or 
their health or the health or lives of 
their teachers or others in the school 
community. 
We know that in order to reopen 
schools safely, we have to do two 
things: We have to reduce the spread of 
COVID–19 in those communities where 
it still exists and is still spreading, and 
we need much more rapid testing ca-
pacity so that we can quickly detect 
and isolate somebody who has COVID– 
19. We need to be able to quickly detect 
an outbreak of COVID in a school, 
whether that be a student or a teacher, 
so we can make sure that others do not 
get infected. 
In so many places, such as the major-
ity of major school systems in my 
State of Maryland, the reason they 
have not been able to plan to reopen 
the classrooms on opening day is that 
the spread continues in so many areas, 
and we don’t have rapid, comprehen-
sive testing. That is the result of a 
failed and botched policy at the highest 
levels—the fact that this administra-
tion, this President, has not put in 
place a comprehensive national strat-
egy to slow and then stop the spread. 
Even today, you have to wait days 
and days and days to get the results of 
a test. That dramatically reduces the 
usefulness of that test when it comes 
to identifying an outbreak, doing all of 
the following up to figure out who else 
has been in contact with that person, 
and preventing the spread. 
That is why so many schools, includ-
ing so many in the State of Maryland, 
will not be able to return to their 
classroom’s opening day. It is not be-
cause they don’t want to—of course, 
they want to—but because they don’t 
want to put students, teachers, and the 
community at risk. That is the reality 
we are facing at the moment. 
In order to ensure that our kids, our 
students, get an education beginning 
on the first day of school, we need to 
dramatically scale up our ability to 
provide distance learning to those stu-
dents. It is simple common sense that 
distance learning for our students re-
quires two things to happen: No. 1, 
teachers need to have the necessary 
equipment and training to connect via 
the internet to their students; No. 2, 
students need to be able to connect to 
the internet so they can receive the 
lessons from their teachers. That is 
simple logic, and that is common 
sense. 
In our country, right now, we have a 
major problem, a major gap, a major 
inequity, and that is that millions of 
students, as we prepare to begin the 
first day of school, don’t have access to 
the internet. That means they will be 
cut off from that form of distance 
learning, and that is unacceptable, 
given the fact that that is the approach 
we have to take at least for some pe-
riod of time in many schools around 
the country. 
I think we should agree—and I hope 
we agree—that every child in our coun-
try, regardless of his or her ZIP Code 
or their family’s income, should re-
ceive a high-quality, top-notch edu-
cation that allows each of those stu-
dents to achieve their full potential. 
They can’t even connect to the inter-
net if they can’t even connect to their 
teachers. That, obviously, can’t hap-
pen. 
In many ways, what we have seen 
from the coronavirus is, unfortunately, 
not anything new. It is the magnifica-
tion of deep, systemic inequities that 
existed in our country before the out-
break of the pandemic and have been 
amplified since then—inequities in our 
healthcare system, inequities in var-
ious social systems, and, certainly, in-
equities in our social system. 
Those inequities have put students— 
many students—at an increased dis-
advantage, primarily students from 
lower income families and neighbor-
hoods 
and, 
especially, 
students 
of 
color. 
Before the pandemic, we used to refer 
to this distance learning gap for stu-
dents as the ‘‘homework gap.’’ What do 
we mean by the homework gap? Well, 
when I was at school and we were given 
a homework assignment, we pretty 
much needed our textbooks, and we 
needed our pens and paper. But now the 
overwhelming majority of homework 
assignments given by teachers require 
access to the internet to do your as-
signment and to do your research. 
Before the pandemic, we had millions 
of American students who couldn’t ac-
cess the internet for the purposes of 
doing their homework, and that was a 
serious problem. We called that the 
homework gap. But now what we call 
the homework gap has become a full- 
blown learning gap. It is not just a 
question of not being able to access the 
internet to do our homework assign-
ment; these millions of students can’t 
access the internet at all for their 
learning. 
This is not an isolated, small prob-
lem, and it is not just relegated to cer-
tain parts of the country. It is every-
where. 
In urban communities, 21 percent of 
students do not have access to ade-
quate internet. In suburban areas, it is 
25 percent. In rural areas, it is 37 per-
cent. 
There are three reasons for this lack 
of access. One is lack of access to a de-
vice, a computer device. Obviously, you 
need to have a device to get on the 
internet. 
Here is a letter I received when 
schools had to shut down earlier this 
spring as a result of the pandemic. I re-
ceived a letter from an 11-year-old 
Marylander who shared that his family 
has one computer, which he needs to 
share with his sister, who is in fourth 
grade, while his mom, who is a single 
parent, has to work full time using 
that same computer. He said that his 
family hadn’t gotten any other help 
with additional electronics and that 
his mom, who ‘‘is the most supportive 
and strongest mom . . . can only do so 
much.’’ That is just one example of a 
student who doesn’t have access to a 
device. 
What is another reason you can’t 
connect? Well, if you don’t have an 
internet connection either because you 
don’t have a hotspot for your cell sig-
nal or you are not otherwise connected 
through a wire, then you obviously 
can’t get the signal. So we need to 
make sure that we have more hotspot 
devices available for more students and 
do our best to build out the infrastruc-
ture to reach those who cannot be 
reached by hotspots. That is a second 
reason: You just can’t connect to the 
internet and get the signal. 
A third reason is that in some places, 
internet access is available, but it is 
unaffordable. It just costs too much. 
We should not have any situation 
where a student, during this pandemic, 
can’t get on the internet because his or 
her family cannot afford to pay for it. 
Just to give you an idea of the mag-
nitude of this problem, in the spring, 50 
million K–12 students were trying to 
access the internet from home for their 
lessons. But 15 to 16 million of those 
students either did not have access to 
high-speed broadband or they did not 
have a device. Nine million of them 
lacked both access to high-speed inter-
net and did not have a device. This is

not a small problem, and it is not an 
isolated problem. It is a problem we 
need to address now, since schools are 
opening in a few weeks in Maryland 
and schools have already opened in 
parts of the country. 
Here is a note I received from an ele-
mentary schoolteacher—someone who 
has been in the classroom for over 20 
years—during the spring when they 
were trying to get their students con-
nected: 
Like thousands of my colleagues, I rose to 
the occasion in transitioning to distance 
learning and engaging with all of my stu-
dents who had access to devices. What was 
disheartening was the students whose faces I 
did not see—a high number of which were my 
African American students. 
This does hit communities of color 
disproportionately, but it does hit stu-
dents in every geographic area in every 
part of each one of our States. 
To give you an example of the dis-
parity based on race and ethnicity, you 
have 18 percent of White students who 
lack access to the internet, 26 percent 
of Latinx students, 30 percent of Black 
students, and 35 percent of Native 
American students. 
I hear some people say: Well, we are 
going to do distance learning, so that 
is not so expensive. Why do we need to 
provide schools with additional help 
during this period of time? 
The reality is, transitioning to a via-
ble distance learning system that helps 
every one of our students costs money. 
In fact, it is an average of $500 per stu-
dent. 
In Maryland, schools are already 
struggling to try to connect their stu-
dents, trying to purchase these devices, 
trying to make sure that they sign up 
families who qualify for the Lifeline 
service, but we are falling short, and 
they need help. 
That is the students. We also have 
learned that 400,000 teachers are cur-
rently unable to connect to the inter-
net because they lack connections. 
School superintendents have reported 
to us stories of teachers who are going 
to the school parking lots to access the 
school hotspots to do their teaching 
and provide their lessons. So we have 
to act urgently to address this issue. 
This should not be a political matter. 
There should not be a debate about the 
need to make sure every student can 
get classroom instruction via distance 
learning during this pandemic. 
That is just for starters. We also 
have schools who have to make sure 
that they provide education to the spe-
cial ed students. We need to make sure 
that students who receive nutrition 
and lunches continue to be able to re-
ceive those, and we need to make sure 
that community schools, which in 
many of our States provide essential 
wraparound 
services, 
have 
the 
re-
sources that they need. 
So let me just end by listing the key 
steps that we need to include in this 
next emergency package that we have 
been working hard to do. One are the 
resources to close this distance learn-
ing gap, including the Emergency Edu-
cation Connections Act which I, along 
with Senator MARKEY and many oth-
ers, have introduced. We need $4 billion 
to make those connections. 
I see Senator CORTEZ MASTO on the 
floor, and I want to thank her for her 
leadership here, as well as Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and Senator REED. 
Two, we need to provide $12 billion 
for additional help for the IDEA pro-
gram for special ed. Three, we need to 
make sure that we continue the flexi-
bility for school lunch programs and 
increase the SNAP benefit by 15 per-
cent. Four, we need to provide the $175 
billion to help all of our K–12 schools, 
including our community schools. 
I will end with this. Childcare facili-
ties are really feeling stretched and 
going under. If we want to have a safe 
and calibrated reopening, we need to 
make sure that those childcare centers 
remain open to parents so that they 
are able to go back to work—as they 
are allowed to safely—and make sure 
that their kids are well cared for. 
We have got a lot of work to do. We 
have been trying to have these discus-
sions for over 21⁄2 months, since the 
House passed the Heroes Act. This is 
long overdue. We hope these negotia-
tions will conclude quickly because 
many of the protections that are in 
place right now are expiring. 
As we do that, let’s make sure that 
our kids, who are going back to school 
in a matter of weeks in my State of 
Maryland—that all of them can con-
nect to the internet so all of them can 
learn. 
It is simply unacceptable that mil-
lions of American kids are going to be 
going back to school, just like we all 
remember doing at one point in time, 
but they are not able to go in the class-
room, and their only way to learn is by 
connecting to their teachers via the 
internet. We need to solve that prob-
lem and do it now. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor to the next Senator who is 
going to speak on this issue. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I am proud to follow my very dis-
tinguished colleague from Maryland 
after those very powerful and eloquent 
remarks, and I subscribe to literally 
every point that he has made in rep-
resenting Maryland. We are joined by 
Senators from all over the country, 
Senator REED, and Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO. This issue is truly national in 
scope. 
It occurred to me as I was listening 
to Senator VAN HOLLEN: We would not 
ask students to go through an edu-
cation where they had no books, where 
they had no desks, where they had no 
writing instruments, where they had 
no teachers. The internet is as funda-
mental to education today as the basic 
building blocks of desks and teachers 
and books. They are our future. Our 
students are our future, and the inter-
net is part of their present and future. 
I want to bring this issue home to 
Connecticut. I convened a roundtable— 
as I have done in many parts of the 
State—in Hartford a week or so ago 
with the superintendent of schools, the 
mayor of Hartford, and parents and 
community groups to talk about the 
digital divide—or the homework gap, 
as it is now known so widely and 
colloquially. 
The stories they told me about at-
tempting to connect during this time 
when their students were learning re-
motely were absolutely heartbreaking. 
Students who wanted to learn and 
sought to participate did not have that 
basic opportunity because either they 
weren’t connected or they couldn’t af-
ford it or they didn’t have the com-
puter or, in some instances, their par-
ents couldn’t connect, lacked the ex-
pertise. Many of us have been there. 
It is about connectivity, written 
broadly, but it is also about the afford-
ability of that service; it is about the 
mechanical 
instruments, 
the 
com-
puters, necessary to do it; it is about 
parents having the expertise; and it is 
also about the learning habits of sit-
ting in front of a screen and absorbing 
knowledge in that way—not playing 
video games but absorbing knowledge 
through distance learning. 
In the absence of a robust and ade-
quate governmental response, private 
groups and philanthropists are filling 
some of the gaps. I want to cite one in 
particular because it arose during that 
meeting. The Dalio Foundation—spe-
cifically, Barbara and Ray Dalio— 
along with the Hartford Foundation for 
Public Giving, have provided com-
puters to schools in the Hartford area. 
In fact, Barbara and Ray Dalio have 
provided thousands of computers to 
schools all around Connecticut, filling 
that gap through their enormous gen-
erosity. They are people of vision who 
know that students need this basic in-
strument of learning. It is about access 
to the building blocks of education. 
They are providing it, but private 
sources of funding and philanthropy go 
only so far, and that is why we are here 
today to talk about this really urgent 
issue. It is urgent for Connecticut but, 
literally, for every State. There should 
be nothing political about it. We have 
the wherewithal. We need the will. It is 
not a red State or a blue State issue. It 
is the United States that has to come 
to the rescue of American education 
and provide broadband connectivity. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has literally 
exposed deep inequities—and one of 
them is in education—in connectivity. 
There are inequities in housing; red-
lining still exists. There are inequities 
in healthcare, which is the reason why 
the burden of this pandemic has fallen 
disproportionately on communities of 
color. In Connecticut, if you are Black, 
you are 21⁄2 times more likely to die of 
the coronavirus, but one of the most 
pernicious injustices are the barriers 
that prevent access to virtual learning 
and online education. 
Schools in communities across Con-
necticut and the country are grappling

with 
this 
unprecedented 
question: 
When is it safe to reopen? That answer 
will depend on local circumstance, the 
opinions of scientists, public health ex-
perts’ views. Listen to the epidemiolo-
gists and the scientists, not to the poli-
ticians. Undoubtedly, there will be, in 
some cases, virtual learning and, in 
others, a hybrid of virtual and phys-
ically present learning. 
We have to recognize that the inter-
net is going to be essential in many, 
many communities in Connecticut and 
around the country, and some commu-
nities will choose virtual learning in 
order to keep their students, their 
teachers, and their parents safe, but 
the digital divide will plague it, and it 
will plague almost every community. 
We have this notion that somehow it 
is limited to rural areas or it is limited 
to some States. It is, in fact, endemic 
to almost every community in our Na-
tion that some students are isolated 
and divided and that some of our young 
people experience this homework gap. 
As my colleague Senator VAN HOLLEN 
said, one-quarter of all students na-
tionally are at risk of losing months of 
education because their homes still 
lack adequate home internet. 
We take broadband for granted. We 
rely on it every day in this building 
and in many others around the coun-
try, in office buildings and in many 
schools; but for some parents and chil-
dren, it is absent, and that is why the 
measures that we have suggested are so 
vital. 
As with far too many of our divi-
sions, the weight of these inequities 
falls 
disproportionately 
and 
dan-
gerously on communities of color. In 
fact, at least 30 percent of African- 
American 
students 
lack 
access 
to 
broadband, as well as 35 percent of Na-
tive Americans. We are leaving behind 
those students who most need the help, 
and in this time of national reckoning 
over racial justice, these barriers to 
education and opportunity are even 
more dramatic, more profound, and 
more lasting. 
We have to take the kind of signifi-
cant steps now that we took after Hur-
ricane Katrina. The FCC took sweeping 
action to make sure that individuals 
whose lives were upended by disaster 
were connected. Within 1 month, the 
FCC dedicated more than $200 million 
to fund connectivity efforts and aggres-
sively expanded Lifeline and E-Rate 
programs. We are not even close to 
matching that commitment. 
Remember, the bold plan in that in-
stance was from George W. Bush and 
from the FCC majority he appointed. 
This time, again, we must take bold, 
bipartisan action. We can help bridge 
this divide and close the gap. 
I have joined my colleagues in push-
ing for emergency funds for broadband 
access, for the Lifeline program, for E- 
Rate; yet, when I asked the chairman 
of the FCC at a most recent Commerce 
Committee hearing, he was unwilling 
to commit to the billion-dollar pro-
gram that I have suggested in various 
proposals, along with colleagues, is a 
minimum that we should set forward. 
These proposals should be a first step 
toward congressional action, a kind of 
rubric. 
I was proud to introduce the Emer-
gency Broadband Connections Act with 
Senator WYDEN
to provide families 
with assistance so they can afford 
broadband connections and to reinforce 
the Lifeline program. I am also proud 
to work with Senator MARKEY and oth-
ers on the Emergency Education Con-
nections Act to ensure that the FCC’s 
E-Rate program can help all K–12 stu-
dents obtain broadband and devices. 
As a country, there have been so 
many sacrifices made by so many and 
so much heartbreak and hardship. This 
absence of broadband should not be one 
of those sacrifices that we impose on 
our children. 
We have the opportunity and the ob-
ligation to act now. I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to take this stark re-
ality and include funding to address 
the Homework Act within the long- 
overdue COVID–19 package. We need to 
take this obligation seriously. We need 
to seize this moment. It is a moment of 
reckoning, and we cannot fail to meet 
the challenge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, in a couple of weeks, students in 
Nevada and around the country are 
going to begin their studies again. I 
want what every parent in America 
wants—a safe school year that allows 
schoolchildren to thrive in mind and 
body. To make that happen, students 
and parents need the flexibility to 
make decisions that are best for their 
families. They need school systems 
that can afford the technology, the 
equipment, and the resources to keep 
students and staff safe. They need ac-
cess to the internet and the devices 
that will support education as well as 
allow parents to work from home and 
supervise their kids. 
I have been working to bridge the 
digital divide for Nevadans as part of 
my Innovation State Initiative, which 
helps Nevada develop groundbreaking 
solutions to 21st-century problems. 
That is why last month I held a state-
wide conversation about broadband. I 
heard local officials in rural commu-
nities talk about the challenges they 
faced getting high-quality internet ac-
cess to their communities. 
A 9-year-old student told me how she 
struggled to do schoolwork because she 
only had her mother’s cell phone for 
internet access. I also heard stories 
about how libraries in my State are 
stepping 
into 
the 
digital 
breach 
through the FCC’s E-rate Program, 
which subsidizes internet access for 
schools and libraries. 
Most of all, we talked about how 
widespread the issue is in my State. 
The FCC’s own figures show that half 
of rural Nevadans and 6 percent of peo-
ple statewide can’t even get high-speed 
wired internet. That is not counting 
people who can’t afford services or de-
vices or those who can’t get reliable 
wireless services. We are talking hun-
dreds of thousands of people in the Sil-
ver State without the ability to stay 
connected to one another during a time 
of social distancing. 
Students in Nevada need internet ac-
cess not just to attend class remotely 
but to submit homework online. Be-
tween 12 million and 16 million stu-
dents across the country can’t com-
plete their homework because they 
lack access. It is not just families with 
school-age 
kids 
who 
need 
better 
broadband access; businesses need it, 
too, to reach new customers and offer 
new services, particularly during a 
time when we are dealing with a 
healthcare crisis and asking people to 
shelter in place. 
That is why we must build on the $2 
billion the CARES Act included for 
various broadband technology invest-
ments and allocate funds in this next 
coronavirus package to make access to 
broadband more affordable in every 
ZIP Code. 
With my colleagues, I introduced the 
Accessible, Affordable Internet for All 
Act to invest over $100 billion in things 
like E-rate support, including Wi-Fi on 
schoolbuses, and digital literacy train-
ing. That investment can fund vouch-
ers to offset broadband costs for those 
who might not otherwise be able to af-
ford it. It can go toward establishing a 
one-stop 
clearinghouse 
of 
Federal 
broadband program information for 
communities and organizations that 
need it and offer the ability to track 
funds, through my bipartisan ACCESS 
BROADBAND Act. Fundamentally, it 
can help a confused high school sopho-
more watch a video explaining her ge-
ometry homework, while her parents 
video-conference with colleagues in the 
next room and her little sister talks 
with her grandparents. 
It is our job at the Federal level to 
ensure that Americans across this 
country have the resources and tools 
they need as local districts so that 
those districts can decide what is best 
for their communities as we move for-
ward. To do that, we need to set aside 
those proposals that force schools to 
make decisions they are uncomfortable 
with. We need to listen to local teach-
ers on the ground who know what is 
best for their school districts, not leg-
islators in Washington trying to man-
date what schools must do. Local dis-
tricts are in touch with their leaders 
and are monitoring the actual spread 
of the virus in our local communities. 
Yet, unfortunately, some of my col-
leagues want to withhold two-thirds of 
schools’ funding unless students are 
physically present at school. It makes 
no sense to make schools all over the 
country move in lockstep. We need to 
listen to local school boards, to par-
ents, to teachers, and to our public 
health experts about the safest way to 
teach in our local communities. 
Back home in Nevada, I am listening 
to my school districts, to parents and

teachers. I am fighting to get the re-
sources and support they need so that 
everyone can feel safe and learn in an 
environment that is best for them 
right now. I want to make sure we get 
our families and school districts alike 
the resources and tools they need for 
the safest possible year ahead. I want 
to let them do it on their terms, 
whether that is in person or online. But 
that requires Congress and this Senate 
to ensure we are doing everything in 
the next package to put funding into 
broadband so that we can ensure every 
student has equal access to the oppor-
tunity to learn and no one is left be-
hind. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
come together in a bipartisan way so 
that we can fund the necessary relief 
when it comes to broadband and any 
other relief that is necessary for our 
families and our students and our 
teachers and our staff during this 
healthcare crisis. 
I yield the floor to my esteemed col-
league, the senior Senator from Rhode 
Island. 
Mr. REED. Thank you very much, 
Senator, for those very thoughtful re-
marks. 
Twenty-one days—that is how long 
one Florida public school teacher was 
on 
a 
ventilator 
after 
contracting 
COVID 
this 
spring. 
Plasma 
trans-
fusions and anti-viral medication ulti-
mately saved her life. And now she is 
being asked to return to the class-
room—a job she loves, teaching kids 
she loves. She wants to go back but is 
afraid to go back while the virus is 
surging, while more people in her com-
munity are being sent to the very same 
hospital. 
In Arizona, a small school district 
lost a teacher to COVID despite fol-
lowing all the protocols. The super-
intendent called a safe reopening a fan-
tasy, saying: ‘‘Kids will get sick or 
worse. 
Family 
members 
will 
die. 
Teachers will die.’’ 
Yet children will be denied needed 
education funding unless classes are in 
person, according to the President. 
Should the majority, which has failed 
to take action on the House-passed He-
roes bill for months—should the Trump 
administration itself have done a bet-
ter job making it safe for kids and 
teachers to return to school? Abso-
lutely. And the continued failure to 
act, to lead, to do a better job of con-
taining COVID will cost people their 
lives and children their education. 
What is the Republican plan to avert 
this 
catastrophe? 
‘‘OPEN 
THE 
SCHOOLS!!!’’ the President tweets in 
all capital letters. The Republican plan 
is to open the schools for in-person 
learning—or else. Open the schools 
even when the transmission of the 
virus 
is 
not 
contained. 
Open 
the 
schools even if testing and contact 
tracing are inadequate to manage the 
spread of the virus. Open the schools 
even if your facilities do not have ade-
quate ventilation. Open the schools or 
we will privatize the public school sys-
tem. Open or else. 
We know what happens when things 
reopen when community transmission 
remains 
high, 
when 
proper 
public 
health safety measures are not in 
place, when we do not have the rapid- 
result testing and contact tracing nec-
essary to contain the virus. We get out-
breaks. People get sick. Hospitaliza-
tions and deaths increase. What is the 
President’s response? He said: ‘‘It is 
what it is.’’ 
What has Senate Republican leader-
ship prioritized? Shielding businesses 
from liability and being sued for neg-
ligence. In other words, if reopening 
too quickly results in more sickness, 
‘‘it is what it is.’’ This approach is ap-
palling and unacceptable and must be 
rejected. 
School is a lifeline for children in the 
communities hit hardest by the pan-
demic and the ensuing economic fall-
out. The Federal Government must 
step in with a comprehensive plan and 
the resources to make sure that school 
is there for these children, the teach-
ers, the custodians, the parents, the 
family. 
We know this school year will be like 
no other. School districts will need to 
redesign the school day and be pre-
pared to switch to distance learning, as 
necessary. There will be new protocols 
for sanitization, transportation, and 
staffing. 
Teachers need training on how to 
stay safe in the classroom. You will re-
call that many in this body wanted to 
add firearms training to the list of 
teacher duties. It is disheartening to 
note that many of the same Members 
who wanted to equip teachers with 
guns and firearms training are now un-
willing to provide them with basic 
cleaning supplies and personal protec-
tive equipment. They are denying them 
the resources and training they need to 
keep themselves and their students 
safe from a very clear and present dan-
ger: COVID–19. 
Schools will have to reengineer the 
use of space in and around the school 
building and reconfigure classrooms to 
ensure that social distancing can be 
maintained. With the recent Govern-
ment 
Accountability 
Office 
report 
showing that over half of school dis-
tricts nationwide need to update or re-
place 
multiple 
systems 
in 
their 
schools, such as heating, ventilation, 
air-conditioning—HVAC—and 
plumb-
ing, dedicated funding for infrastruc-
ture is needed as well. In fact, we need 
significant money for school infra-
structure. We needed it before COVID. 
We need more of it today. 
More critically, schools will need to 
increase their capacity to support chil-
dren’s well-being—including nutrition, 
health screening, and mental health 
support—whether in person or at a dis-
tance. 
The first step in any reasonable plan 
to reopen schools starts with robust, 
rapid-result testing and contact trac-
ing to contain the spread of the virus. 
There is no path for safe in-person 
schooling without it. That is step one, 
and the President has not taken that 
step yet. 
A comprehensive plan for schools 
would also stabilize State and local 
budgets, ensure equity and access to 
technology and broadband, enhance nu-
trition services, and provide support 
for our broader educational ecosystem, 
including afterschool programs, muse-
ums, and libraries. For example, with-
out a robust investment in our public 
libraries, we will continue to struggle 
to close the digital divide and the 
homework gap. 
Many, many, many, many school sys-
tems today are beginning their classes 
on a remote basis. The children need an 
electronic device—some type of laptop, 
something—and they also need access 
to Wi-Fi. Many families don’t have 
that. And unless we step in with the re-
sources to support the localities and 
States in providing those capacities, 
those children will be denied an edu-
cation. 
One way, as I suggested, to do that is 
through our public libraries. As I have 
gone through Rhode Island, it was en-
couraging to see in the afternoon, 
throughout the State—in small librar-
ies, everywhere—young people doing 
their homework. They don’t have Wi-Fi 
at home; they have it in the library. 
This is just part of what we have to do, 
and libraries can be at the heart of 
that. 
We have to put the resources, the 
commitment, the plan, the leadership, 
the force, and the momentum behind 
this effort, and we have seen none of 
that in the administration. The most 
fundamental aspect of all of this is 
that it does come down to the re-
sources—the substantial, dedicated re-
sources that have to go to our public 
schools to meet these additional costs, 
to meet these additional demands, to 
serve this generation of young Ameri-
cans who, if they are denied these serv-
ices, will be denied an education. And 
that is not just a momentary loss; that 
is a cumulative, lifetime effect that 
will not only deny them a chance at 
opportunity, it will deny this Nation 
their talent. 
These are the issues that we are 
struggling with at this moment. These 
are the issues we must confront. We— 
the 
Democratic 
caucus—have 
been 
calling for $175 billion to support our 
public schools, to put education in a 
place in which this generation of stu-
dents can learn, to make this country 
or continue to keep this country what 
we always thought it was: a special 
place in which anyone with the ability 
and the desire to learn would have the 
opportunity to do so. And that would 
mean their success and our commu-
nity’s and our country’s success. 
We are counting on schools being 
able to deliver for students despite the 
challenges caused by this pandemic. 
Yet the Senate majority and the 
Trump administration are unwilling to 
commit the resources necessary to 
avoid a potential generational catas-
trophe. State and local governments

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4911 
August 5, 2020 
are reeling from the loss of revenue due 
to the economic shutdown caused by 
the pandemic. There is no Governor in 
this country—Republican or Demo-
crat—there is no county administrator 
or city leader who I think would stand 
up and say: ‘‘We are fine. We don’t need 
any help. We are in great shape.’’ 
No. They all have one message, and it 
has been coming through from the Na-
tional Association of Republican Gov-
ernors and the National Association of 
Democratic Governors: You must give 
us resources and flexibility to use these 
resources to fulfill our obligation to 
the people of our States. 
That is the message. We are seeing 
school districts across the Nation 
starting to lay people off in anticipa-
tion of budget cuts. Even if they are 
able to maintain current levels of staff-
ing and financial resources, it would 
not be enough to meet the upcoming 
challenges. Even if they could keep 
their staff in place, where do they get 
the extra money for the infrastructure 
repairs, for the traditional Wi-Fi, for 
the additional teaching changes that 
have to take place, for the different ap-
proaches to education one must take in 
order 
to 
be 
effective 
in 
social 
distancing? 
The School Superintendents Associa-
tion of the United States estimates 
that the average traditional COVID-re-
lated cost per student will be $490. We 
need at least that. 
We must go forward with a package 
that 
includes 
provisions 
of 
the 
Childcare Educational Relief Act, the 
Library Stabilization Fund Act, and 
the State and Local Stabilization Fund 
Act to ensure that this generation of 
Americans can overcome the pandemic 
and reach its full potential. 
This is a generational crisis. Just as 
Americans 
of 
previous 
generations 
have been called upon to sacrifice and 
to commit themselves to the young of 
this country so that they could have a 
better future, we are being called upon 
to do that, and we are waiting for an 
answer. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the Senate floor to speak 
about a topic that is very close to my 
heart. 
As the son of Cuban refugees and as a 
first-generation American, the strug-
gles of immigrant families are not 
something I read about in books or 
watched on television. I lived them. I 
saw with my own eyes what it meant 
to grow up in an immigrant family in 
a low-income tenement in Union City, 
NJ. My mother worked tirelessly as a 
seamstress and sacrificed everything to 
make sure that my siblings and I could 
have a better life and a better future, 
because that is the very essence of 
what we call the American dream. It is 
about ensuring that the next genera-
tion has it better than we do and that 
our children and grandchildren and 
their children and grandchildren have 
greater opportunities than we do to re-
alize their full potential. 
It doesn’t matter who you are, where 
you are from, or when your ancestors 
came to this country. We are a nation 
built by immigrants. Every single 
member of this great and storied body 
is a descendant of those who came to 
America, seeking better lives for them-
selves and their loved ones. 
The President is a second-generation 
American. His grandfather, Friedrich 
Trump, came here from Germany. Our 
First Lady is herself an immigrant. 
Yet this administration and President 
Trump 
have 
gone 
to 
painstaking 
lengths to deny, erase, and ignore the 
contributions of immigrants to Amer-
ican life and culture, innovation and 
ingenuity, economy and prosperity. 
They have worked overtime to deny 
the very fact that the immigrant story 
is America’s story. 
As an old saying in Spanish goes, 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows): ‘‘There 
is nothing worse than not wanting to 
see what is right in front of you.’’ 
Donald Trump’s endless lies and at-
tacks on immigrants started long be-
fore he descended down that escalator 
in Trump Tower to announce his run 
for 
the 
Presidency. 
They 
haven’t 
stopped since. 
The President recently took another 
aggressive step in his war to erase im-
migrants from the portrait of America 
when he issued an unconstitutional 
edict to exclude our undocumented 
brothers and sisters from being count-
ed in the 2020 census for the purpose of 
determining representation in Con-
gress. 
His message was loud and clear to 
immigrant communities across the 
country: You are not welcome here. 
You don’t belong here. You don’t 
count. 
His goal is to instill fear in immi-
grant communities, and that is shame-
ful and un-American. 
Let’s be clear. The U.S. Constitution 
is explicit on this particular point. Ar-
ticle I, section 2 clearly reads: ‘‘Rep-
resentatives and direct Taxes shall be 
apportioned among the several States 
which may be included within this 
Union, according to their respective 
Numbers, which shall be determined by 
adding to the whole Number of free 
Persons.’’ 
The census requires an accurate 
count of all persons living in the coun-
try. It does not distinguish between 
status or citizenship. It could have 
read that it requires an account of all 
citizens of the then-United States, of 
the Union. It could have read that it is 
an account of all citizens and all legal 
permanent residents. It didn’t read 
that either. 
It specifically recognized this be-
cause, as the Union was developing, 
there were people from different walks 
of life in the United States, and it pur-
posely understood that not all of them 
would necessarily be citizens at the 
time of accounting, but who was in 
America at any given time from the 
creation of the Constitution was im-
portant—all persons. 
My friends, we have been sent here to 
serve all of our constituents in our 
home States, no matter the color of 
their skin, their gender, or their legal 
status. 
The history of America is inter-
twined with immigrant stories. In 
every State of our Union, immigrants 
work in every industry and contribute 
in all facets of American life—the most 
important parts of our lives. 
They work in our fields, picking our 
fruits and vegetables. They are check-
ers at grocery stores and construction 
workers, 
building 
our 
bridges 
and 
homes. They educate our children in 
our schools. They treat the sick in our 
hospitals as nurses, doctors, and men-
tal health professionals. They wear the 
uniform and carry our flag in the U.S. 
armed services. 
In fact, during this pandemic, hun-
dreds of thousands of immigrants, in-
cluding 
undocumented 
immigrants, 
have put their lives on the line to serve 
as essential frontline workers and to 
keep businesses open, despite the ad-
ministration actively seeking to deport 
them. 
Like many American citizens, they 
are risking their lives every day, while 
being disproportionately affected by 
COVID–19, to provide others with the 
services they need and to protect the 
health and safety of our fellow Ameri-
cans. All the while, they are facing dis-
proportionate infection and death rates 
from this horrible disease. They are the 
invisible heroes of this pandemic. They 
are the ones who make it possible for 
us to receive the essential goods and 
services so that we can stay home, 
which is what we are told by the Na-
tion’s public health officials. 
But the message from the President 
to these essential workers, who per-
form backbreaking work in our fields, 
care for our children, or treat you at 
the hospital is: You are not worthy. 
I ask every single one of my col-
leagues if, God forbid, you were in-
fected with COVID–19, would you really 
care about the citizenship status of the 
doctor or nurse treating you? Would 
you ask for his or her legal papers be-
fore getting help? Would any of you 
refuse to eat fruit or vegetables in your 
homes picked by the calloused hands of 
an undocumented immigrant sweating 
in our fields? Would you rather not 
have a highway built in your State be-
cause the workers have a native lan-
guage other than English?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4912 
August 5, 2020 
Now, many of you would tell me that 
is nonsense. But yet, the Trump Presi-
dency has been marked by deafening si-
lence in the face of this inflammatory, 
xenophobic, immoral campaign against 
immigrants. 
Just take the example of TPS and 
DACA beneficiaries. As my home State 
of New Jersey struggled in the early 
days of the pandemic—until recently, 
we 
had 
the 
second-most 
cases 
of 
COVID–19—temporary protective sta-
tus holders like Madelia Cartagena in 
Newark and Dreamers like Daysi from 
Monmouth County rose to the chal-
lenge presented by the pandemic. 
As more than 131,000 temporary pro-
tective status holders across the Na-
tion, and 7,500 in New Jersey alone, 
Madelia was considered an essential 
worker as the company she has worked 
for in the last 17 years had to respond 
to the increasing demand for sanitizer 
dispensers. 
For Daysi, the fact that she was 
brought to the United States from Cen-
tral America at just 9 years old meant 
nothing to the patients whose lives she 
was helping to save. What mattered is 
that she showed up when she was need-
ed, and that she did so despite the lin-
gering threat that DACA, or deferred 
action for children arrivals, would be 
abruptly terminated, and with it her 
ability to remain in this country. She 
showed up every day, helping to save 
lives. 
Put simply, TPS holders like Madelia 
and DACA beneficiaries like Daysi help 
us heal and will also help our economy 
recover. They represent among the best 
of America. 
To give you some context, when I say 
they will help our economy recover, 
Dreamers bring in a net $3.4 billion an-
nually to the U.S. Treasury and gen-
erate $42 billion in gross domestic prod-
uct each year—Dreamers. 
Yet the administration has fought 
tooth and nail to send Dreamers pack-
ing, despite the American flag being 
the only one they have ever pledged al-
legiance to and the national anthem 
being the only national anthem they 
have ever sung. 
Even after the Supreme Court’s re-
cent ruling—the Supreme Court, the 
highest Court in the land—that the ter-
mination of DACA was unlawful, the 
administration has openly defied the 
Supreme Court’s order by not reopen-
ing the full DACA Program. 
These Dreamers are battling the 
coronavirus and the Trump administra-
tion. 
Polls show that even a majority of 
Trump voters want to protect Dream-
ers from deportation, and wide swaths 
of registered voters support Dreamers, 
regardless of the voter’s gender, edu-
cation, income, ethnicity, religion, or 
ideology. That includes 68 percent of 
Republicans, 71 percent of conserv-
atives, and 64 percent of those who ap-
prove of the job the President is doing. 
But instead of accepting the Supreme 
Court’s decision and acknowledging the 
enormous contributions of Dreamers, 
this administration is planning new ef-
forts to end DACA. It is no secret. They 
indicate as much in the latest Depart-
ment of Homeland Security memo. 
And let’s be honest. If it is not out-
right termination they seek, the ad-
ministration will treat the protection 
of Dreamers as a bargaining chip in 
order to undo our legal immigration 
system. They want to cut legal family 
immigration in exchange for what they 
call a merit-based immigration system. 
That would be pretty shameful and of-
fensive because there are many who are 
here who would never be here under a 
merit-based system. 
This administration and my Repub-
lican colleagues need to open their 
eyes and realize how we are treating 
immigrants in this country. We need 
them to do it now, in this moment, as 
we are pleading with our colleagues to 
do what is right, to give families a 
fighting chance to beat the virus and 
put the economy back on track. 
We can’t turn a blind eye to the fact 
that immigrant families will likely be 
excluded from help desperately needed 
during this pandemic in the next 
COVID–19 package. 
So far, undocumented immigrants 
who pay their taxes and selflessly risk 
their lives as essential workers to save 
others have been deliberately excluded 
from the Federal pandemic assistance 
Congress has provided. 
Virtually all immigrants who use an 
individual 
taxpayer 
identification 
number—or as we call it, an ITIN—to 
file their Federal taxes under U.S. law, 
which is totally permissible, and their 
U.S. 
citizen 
spouses—U.S. 
citizen 
spouses—and children were left out 
from any economic impact payments 
in the CARES Act. 
In other words, we denied American 
citizens and their American citizen 
children badly needed assistance as a 
punishment—as 
a 
punishment—for 
being married to an undocumented im-
migrant or belonging to a mixed-status 
family during this economic emer-
gency. 
I grew up believing that an American 
citizen is an American citizen—is an 
American citizen, regardless of whom I 
marry, regardless of whether my chil-
dren are the offspring of one parent 
who is an American citizen and an-
other one who is not. 
Thousands of American citizens were 
denied 
$1,200 
individual 
stimulus 
checks to which other American citi-
zens were entitled to just because of 
who they love. American citizen chil-
dren were denied $500 in assistance to 
which other American citizen children 
were entitled. It is wrong. 
Are there two classes of American 
children in this country now? Are there 
two classes of American citizens now? 
As we consider the next COVID–19 re-
lief package, Congress has to fix this 
injustice. 
If you work hard, follow the rules, 
and pay your taxes, you deserve tax re-
lief, regardless of how you filed. At the 
very least, if you are an American cit-
izen living in a mixed-status family or 
an American child who is the offspring 
of a mixed-status family, you should 
not be denied the cash benefit you are 
rightfully entitled to. It is just that 
simple. It is justice. It is what is right. 
In the face of this tremendous public 
health crisis, we should not let the in-
sidious, 
cruel, 
and 
relentless 
scapegoating of immigrants prevent us 
from providing much needed relief to 
the very same families and workers 
who are helping us survive. All families 
deserve to be treated with dignity. It is 
the humane thing to do. 
But that is not all. As we expanded 
access to free COVID–19 testing, un-
documented immigrants were left be-
hind. Now, that makes no sense. The 
coronavirus doesn’t check your status 
before it infects you. 
An undocumented immigrant living 
in America with COVID–19 is no less a 
threat to become a seriously ill indi-
vidual or spread the virus than an 
American citizen who has been in-
fected. The virus does not discriminate 
on race, gender, ethnicity, borders, or 
legal status. As a public health propo-
sition, you want everybody to be test-
ed. 
Given 
the 
pandemic’s 
dispropor-
tionate impact on low-income and 
communities of color and the fact that 
those communities of color are serving 
in essential industries, I would argue 
that they are more likely to be in-
fected. 
What good is it to any one of us if 
someone, regardless of who or where 
they are, is walking around with an 
undiagnosed case of COVID–19 because 
they weren’t eligible for a test? That 
person can unwittingly infect their rel-
atives, their neighbors, and their co-
workers. 
If we ever want to see our economy 
and lives return to some semblance of 
normal, there must be access to free 
COVID–19 testing, treatment, and vac-
cines for everyone living in the United 
States—everyone living in the United 
States, and that includes regardless of 
immigration status. 
America has to do better to acknowl-
edge the hard work, sacrifice, and con-
tribution of immigrants. Sadly, these 
past 4 years have seen a rise in hate 
crimes and hateful rhetoric targeting 
immigrants. Led by the President, im-
migrants are continuously scapegoated 
for every problem. 
One of my Senate colleagues even 
suggested recently that Hispanics were 
to blame for the rise in COVID cases 
across our own country, instead of the 
epic failure of the administration to 
develop and implement a national pan-
demic response plan or one that in-
cludes culturally competent outreach 
to minority-majority communities. 
As elected officials and leaders in our 
communities, we have a moral respon-
sibility to rise above the immigrant 
fearmongering 
and 
the 
President’s 
hateful rhetoric to reunite our coun-
try. Not only must we include immi-
grant families in the upcoming relief

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4913 
August 5, 2020 
package, but to truly address these in-
justices, we must reform our immigra-
tion laws once and for all. 
We have to come together as we did 
before here in the Senate—I was part of 
that Gang of 8—to restart these long 
overdue discussions and find a path for-
ward to achieving real immigration re-
form. 
I have always believed and still be-
lieve that reforming our immigration 
laws is the civil rights issue of this 
community and of this time. 
It is time to treat immigrants fairly 
and to recognize their hard work and 
contributions to this Nation—immi-
grants like my mother, Evangelina, 
who came here with nothing but the 
conviction that everything in America 
was possible. She refused to let not 
speaking English or her modest wages 
as a seamstress stop her from giving us 
the best life she could. 
And here I am, one of 100 U.S. Sen-
ators, in a country of over 320 million 
people. I am the embodiment of that 
American dream, and my story is no 
less meaningful than that of any other 
immigrant coming to this country or 
in this country to build a better future 
for their family and this Nation. 
That is our past; that is our history; 
that is our present; and it will be our 
future. It is past time that due ac-
knowledgment and respect be given. It 
is now time for action. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as ev-
erybody knows, this country faces at 
this moment an extraordinary set of 
crises—in fact, crises that are unprece-
dented in the history of our country. 
We are in the midst of the worst public 
health crisis since the Spanish flu of 
100 years ago, and, sad to say, this Sen-
ate has done nothing to address that 
crisis over the last 21⁄2 months. 
Over 
the 
past 
4 
months, 
the 
coronavirus has infected nearly 5 mil-
lion 
Americans 
and caused 160,000 
deaths, and the Senate is doing noth-
ing. 
Incredibly—and this is incredible— 
more Americans have been killed by 
the coronavirus than by the Korean 
war, the Vietnam war, the Persian Gulf 
war, 9/11, the Afghanistan war, and the 
Iraq war combined, and the Senate is 
still not acting. 
We are in the midst of the worst eco-
nomic meltdown since the Great De-
pression of the 1930s, and the Senate is 
doing nothing. 
Since March, more than 30 million 
Americans have lost their jobs. Last 
week, the Senate allowed a $600-a-week 
increase in their unemployment bene-
fits to expire. Over half of the Amer-
ican people have seen a loss in their in-
come. Yet the Senate continues to do 
nothing. 
Forty million Americans—an unbe-
lievable number—40 million Americans 
are in danger of being evicted from 
their homes while the Senate has al-
lowed a moratorium on evictions to ex-
pire. 
This is no great shock. Everybody 
knew this would happen. Yet the Re-
publican leadership here has allowed 
that moratorium to expire. 
Twenty-six million Americans can-
not afford food to feed their families, 
and those Americans are lining up at 
emergency food banks in record num-
bers, the vast majority of whom have 
never been to an emergency food bank 
in their lives, and the Senate is doing 
nothing. 
A recordbreaking 5.4 million Ameri-
cans recently lost their health insur-
ance. 
Under 
our 
dysfunctional 
healthcare system, when you lose your 
job, you often lose your health insur-
ance, and that now leaves us with over 
90 million Americans who are unin-
sured or underinsured; that is, 90 mil-
lion Americans who today worry about 
whether they can afford to go to a doc-
tor when they or their kids are sick. 
The Senate is doing nothing. 
In total, American households have 
lost a staggering $6.5 trillion in wealth 
since this pandemic began. It is an un-
imaginable number. What does that 
mean? That $6.5 trillion is a number 
much too large for many of us to fath-
om, and the Senate does nothing. 
Although I know there is some obfus-
cation about this, what everybody in 
America should understand is that over 
2.5 months ago, the House did its job. 
Over 2.5 months ago, the U.S. House of 
Representatives did its job, and they 
passed legislation responding to the 
enormous pain and suffering that the 
American people are now experiencing. 
They did their job, but the Senate has 
not. 
The Heroes Act passed by the House 
in May would extend the $600-a-week 
increase 
in 
unemployment 
benefits 
until January. I want everybody to un-
derstand that. I think sometimes there 
is confusion. The House did its job. 
Under the House bill, if that bill were 
passed here today here in the Senate, 
people would continue to get that $600 
supplement in their unemployment 
benefits. 
The House bill would provide over 
$900 billion to State and local govern-
ments to prevent the massive layoff of 
teachers, firefighters, nurses, construc-
tion workers, and millions of other 
workers who are serving the public 
during this horrific pandemic. Over 1 
million workers who work for State 
and local governments have already 
lost their jobs, and if we do not provide 
substantial aid to State and local gov-
ernments, there will be a mass epi-
demic of job loss there. 
The House bill would provide hazard 
pay to essential workers, which is 
something that is long, long overdue. 
People are putting their lives on the 
line and sometimes dying in order to 
provide us with groceries or to get us 
to work on a bus or on a train. Those 
workers need hazard pay, and that is 
what the House did. 
The House also passed a provision in 
their legislation to require businesses 
to adopt strong health and safety 
standards to protect their employees 
and their customers. 
The House bill would provide $175 bil-
lion in rental and foreclosure assist-
ance to make sure that millions of 
Americans do not lose their homes or 
get evicted from their apartments and 
end up out on the streets. 
The House bill also provides vital 
funding for nutritional assistance, for 
election security—an enormous issue 
here, whether or not we are going to 
have free and fair elections—and also 
substantial funding for the U.S. Postal 
Service, which is now being sabotaged 
by the Trump administration. That is 
what the House passed 2.5 months ago. 
Do I agree with everything that was 
in the House bill? No, I don’t. I think 
much of it, however, is excellent. But 
we can and should make improvements 
in that bill here in the Senate. That is 
what we should be doing—accepting 
the bill and improving it. 
Two and a half months after the 
House passed its bill, Senate Repub-
licans finally woke up, and they said: 
We have to do something. We have to 
respond. The public wants us to re-
spond. We have to do something. And 
they finally released their bill to re-
spond to the coronavirus crisis. Unfor-
tunately, although not surprisingly, 
the Republican plan is woefully inad-
equate for the working families of our 
country, for the elderly, for their chil-
dren, and for the poor, while at the 
same time it provides even more cor-
porate welfare to the rich and the pow-
erful. One might think that in the 
midst of this terrible pandemic, my Re-
publican 
colleagues 
could 
control 
themselves just a bit and not pile on 
more benefits to the people who don’t 
need them and maybe—just maybe— 
pay attention to the people who do 
need help. 
The Senate Republican bill provides 
nothing for hazard pay. If you are a 
grocery store worker, if you are a 
truckdriver, if you are a busdriver, if 
you are working in mass transit, noth-
ing in that bill is provided for hazard 
pay. There is nothing for nutrition as-
sistance and nothing for the 92 million 
Americans who are uninsured or under-
insured. Ninety-two million people are 
uninsured or underinsured in the midst 
of a terrible public health crisis, and 
the Republican legislation ignores that 
reality completely. There is nothing 
for the U.S. Postal Service and nothing 
for State and local governments, many 
of which are on the verge of bank-
ruptcy. 
Here is what that Republican bill 
does contain. It does include another

$29 billion for the Pentagon. Last week, 
this body passed a $740 billion bill for 
the Pentagon, which is more money 
than the next 11 nations combined, 
most of which are our allies—a huge 
military budget, but clearly, in the 
midst of the pandemic, the Pentagon 
needs even more. 
The Republican bill does include an-
other tax break for the meals and en-
tertainment of wealthy CEOs. The Re-
publican bill does include another $1.75 
billion for an FBI building, $1 billion 
for new surveillance planes, $636 mil-
lion more for F–35s, $360 million more 
for a new missile defense system, and 
$283 million more for Apache heli-
copters. I am not quite sure what 
Apache helicopters have to do with a 
pandemic, but be that as it may, they 
did put money in for the helicopters 
and for the Pentagon. 
Under the Republican bill, if you are 
a wealthy business executive, you will 
get a 100-percent tax deduction for a 
three-martini lunch—a 100-percent tax 
deduction for having lunch at some 
fancy restaurant and spending another 
couple hundred dollars on your meal. 
But if you are one of the 26 low-income 
Americans who do not have enough 
food to eat, you get nothing in the Re-
publican bill. In other words, when Re-
publicans, in their bill, refer to nutri-
tion, they are talking about tax breaks 
for the rich who eat at expensive res-
taurants but not one nickel for the 
children in this country who are facing 
hunger. 
Under the Republican bill, if you are 
a profitable defense contractor, you 
will receive an additional $11 billion in 
corporate welfare, but if you are one of 
the 92 million Americans who are unin-
sured or underinsured, you get nothing. 
Under the Republican bill, if you are 
a business owner who forces employees 
to work in an unsafe and unhealthy en-
vironment, you are rewarded. The Re-
publican bill will provide you with the 
immunity you need from lawsuits if 
your workers get sick or die from the 
coronavirus. In other words, you have 
employers who are saying: You have to 
come back to work, or else you are 
going to get fired and not be able to 
feed your family. But the working con-
ditions that we are providing for you 
are not protective of your health, and 
if you get sick, if you die, you are on 
your own. Don’t hold us responsible for 
that. 
The Republican bill does not provide 
a nickel for essential workers during 
this pandemic, but it does make sure 
that you do not receive the hazard pay 
or the personal protective equipment 
that you need and deserve. 
Unbelievably—unbelievably—in 
the 
richest country in the history of the 
world, we have tens of thousands of 
workers—not only doctors and nurses 
but workers from all kinds of profes-
sions—who are interacting with the 
public who need high-quality personal 
protective equipment, and they don’t 
have it. 
While the Republican bill slashes un-
employment benefits by 43 percent for 
30 million Americans who lost their 
jobs, it continues a $135 billion tax 
break to 43,000 millionaires, primarily 
in the real estate and hedge fund indus-
try. In other words, we stop the $600 
benefit for unemployment, but we 
maintain a $135 billion tax break for 
the wealthy. 
It goes without saying that I am 
strongly opposed to the Senate Repub-
lican proposal. Instead of listening to 
the needs of the military-industrial 
complex, we should be listening to the 
needs of working families and the poor. 
Instead of providing more tax breaks to 
the very wealthy, we need to provide 
more economic relief to the tens of 
millions of Americans who are hurting 
economically. 
Just last month, I asked my con-
stituents in Vermont and, in fact, all 
over this country to write to me, email 
me, and tell me how the economic cri-
sis we are in has impacted their lives. 
We received thousands and thousands 
of responses. 
I would like to take a moment to 
read just a few of the many stories that 
came into my office because I think 
sometimes it is very easy for us to live 
in a bubble and not really appreciate 
what is going on. It is especially more 
difficult when, because of the pan-
demic, many of us can’t get out the 
way we would like to get out. So I used 
our email approach to reach out to peo-
ple in Vermont and around the country 
and asked them to tell me what is 
going on, what is going on in your 
lives. Let me just repeat and read to 
you some of the responses—a few of the 
responses that I received. 
A gentleman named Dominic from 
Williston, VT, wrote: 
Without the additional $600/week benefit, 
my benefit will automatically revert to the 
minimum $191/week. 
So he is now getting $791. If he didn’t 
have that $600, it would be $191. 
At that rate, my wife and I will be in seri-
ous crisis within a month. 
Like 
millions 
of 
other 
people, 
Dominic does not have a lot of money 
in the bank. If he did not get that $600 
on top of his unemployment benefit, 
which in Vermont, for him, would be 
$191 a week, he would be in a serious fi-
nancial crisis. 
Denise from Waitsfield, VT, wrote: 
I lost my job due to COVID–19 on March 16, 
2020. The PUA program and the additional 
$600 per week is keeping our family out of 
debt and allowing us to afford our mortgage. 
Without PUA and the additional federal 
stimulus, our family would not be able to 
survive financially. 
In other words, without the unem-
ployment and that $600 supplement, 
her family would not be able to survive 
financially. 
Casey from Burlington, VT, wrote: 
I have been unemployed since March 20th 
and have no job to return to and limited op-
tions for finding a new job in a timely fash-
ion; losing the extra $600/weekly unemploy-
ment benefit would be devastating for me. I 
know it would be the same for so many oth-
ers, including many friends and family. 
Amanda from Isle La Motte, a beau-
tiful 
town 
in 
Northern 
Vermont, 
works, as it happens, while living in 
Vermont, for an unemployment office 
in the State of Massachusetts. She 
wrote—and this speaks to the job that 
she now has: 
I have heard heart wrenching stories. I’ve 
had moms crying that they can’t feed their 
kids, families telling me they’ve been evict-
ed and are homeless. A single dad who was a 
self-employed musician, he cried with me 
saying his savings had run out, he had no 
money for food. This man’s story will stick 
with me the rest of my life. I’ve cried so 
many days for all these people I can’t help. 
I suggest the government officials work in 
an unemployment call center for a day. The 
heart-wrenching stories they will hear. 
I thank Amanda for that. I thank 
Amanda for the work she is doing and 
what she is trying to do but for re-
minding us that, in too many in-
stances, Members of Congress are iso-
lated from the reality that is taking 
place out there. 
The stories go on and on and on. Now 
that the $600 a week in unemployment 
benefits has expired, now that the mor-
atorium on evictions has also expired, 
this crisis is only going to get worse 
and worse and worse. In my view, we 
need to extend the extra $600 a week in 
unemployment benefits for the 30 mil-
lion Americans who have lost their 
jobs. I think that is a no-brainer. 
People are hurting. People are des-
perate. People cannot feed their kids. 
People are going to be evicted from 
their homes and their apartments. We 
have to respond to that pain and ex-
tend that $600 supplement to normal 
unemployment. 
I would go further. I believe that we 
need to make sure that every working- 
class person in this country receives 
$2,000 a month until this crisis is over 
so they can have the security they 
need that they and their family are 
going to survive this crisis with dig-
nity. 
And we cannot continue to ignore the 
reality 
that 
92 
million 
Americans 
today are uninsured or underinsured. 
While I, of course, believe in Medicare 
for All and will continue that fight, at 
least during this crisis, we should 
make sure that all of the 92 million 
who are uninsured or underinsured get 
covered by Medicare for their out-of- 
pocket expenses. It is not asking too 
much that, during this crisis, people 
who have private insurance or Medi-
care or Medicaid not have to pay out- 
of-pocket expenses. 
We need a coronavirus relief bill that 
benefits the working class of this coun-
try and low-income people, not the 
wealthy and the well connected. 
Now, what I think many people do 
not fully understand—it doesn’t get a 
whole lot of attention—is that, during 
this pandemic, not everybody is hurt-
ing. Not everybody out there needs the 
Senate to act. While over 30 million 
Americans have seen their $600 a week 
in 
unemployment 
benefits 
expire, 
thanks to the emergency actions taken 
by the Federal Reserve to prop up the 
stock market, 467 billionaires in this 
country have seen their wealth go up

S4915 
August 5, 2020 
by over $730 billion since the pandemic 
has begun. Let me repeat that: 467 bil-
lionaires have seen their wealth go up 
by over $730 billion in the last several 
months of this pandemic. 
Millions of people are unemployed, 
struggling to put food on the table, but 
467 billionaires have seen their wealth 
go up by over $700 billion. Meanwhile, 
during the last 4 months, while the 
very, very wealthy have become much 
richer, American households have seen 
their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. 
In all likelihood, in the midst of ev-
erything else we are experiencing, we 
are currently looking at what is likely 
the greatest transfer of wealth from 
the middle class and the poor to the 
very rich in the modern history of this 
country. A massive transfer of wealth: 
the 
working-class 
and 
middle-class 
poor getting poorer; the people at the 
very, very top becoming phenomenally 
richer. 
In other words, in the midst of a pan-
demic, in the midst of an economic 
meltdown for working families, in the 
midst of a great struggle regarding sys-
temic racism and police brutality, in 
the midst of the existential threat to 
our planet of climate change, in the 
midst of a President undermining de-
mocracy and moving this country in an 
authoritarian direction—in the midst 
of all of that, we are also seeing a mas-
sive increase in income and wealth in-
equality and the movement in this 
country toward oligarchy. 
Let me just give you a few examples 
of the incredible growth in inequality 
that is taking place right now as we 
speak. While Amazon is denying paid 
sick leave to its employees, while they 
are denying hazard pay and personal 
protective equipment to 450,000 of their 
workers, Jeff Bezos, the owner of Ama-
zon, has increased his wealth by over 
$70 billion. Yes, one person, during the 
pandemic, has seen his wealth increase 
by $70—7–0—billion. 
While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing 
the starvation wages at Walmart by 
providing food stamps and affordable 
housing and Medicaid to the workers 
who are employed by the Walton fam-
ily of Walmart, the Walton family—the 
owner of Walmart—has made over $20 
billion during the pandemic and now 
has a net worth of over $200 billion. 
While 40 million Americans face evic-
tion, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his 
wealth over the past 4 months and now 
has a net worth of more than $70 bil-
lion. 
While millions of Americans are lin-
ing up at emergency food banks be-
cause they don’t have enough money to 
put 
food 
on 
the 
table, 
Mark 
Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, 
has increased his wealth by more than 
$37 billion during the pandemic and is 
now worth over $70 billion. 
In a time of massive wealth and in-
come inequality, when so many people 
in our country are hurting, it is mor-
ally obscene for billionaires to use a 
global pandemic as an opportunity to 
make outrageous profits and to very 
substantially increase their wealth, 
and that is why I will be introducing 
legislation tomorrow to tax the ob-
scene wealth gains billionaires have 
made during this public health crisis. 
According to Americans for Tax Fair-
ness, if we tax 60 percent of the wind-
fall gains these billionaires made from 
March 18 until August 3, we could raise 
over $420 billion. That is enough rev-
enue to allow Medicare to pay all of 
the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses 
for every man, woman, and child in 
this country over the next 12 months. 
So that is the choice we have to 
make. Do we have a tax on the obscene 
increase in wealth that has taken place 
for a few hundred billionaires during 
this pandemic or do we have a fair tax 
on their wealth and say to every man, 
woman, and child: During this crisis, 
you will no longer have to pay any-
thing out of pocket for the healthcare 
you and your family need? 
By taxing 60 percent of the wealth 
gains made by just 467 billionaires—so, 
in a nation of 330 million people, we are 
talking about a tax on 467 of them—a 
tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of 1 percent. 
Just by doing that, we could guarantee 
healthcare as a right for all people in 
this country for an entire year. 
By the way, if anybody out there is 
very worried about the impact of this 
tax on the billionaires, on the people 
who are being taxed—how will they 
survive a 60-percent tax? That is a high 
tax. Do you think they are going to 
make it? Well, we have left them more 
than $310 billion to survive with. That 
is a $310 billion increase in their 
wealth. That is what we have left 
them. 
In my view, above and beyond this 
circumstance, above and beyond the 
pandemic, this Nation must address 
the obscene level of income and wealth 
inequality which exists. It existed be-
fore the pandemic, and it is even worse 
now. In my view, we can no longer tol-
erate three people in this country own-
ing more wealth than the bottom half 
of our Nation at a time when 30 million 
Americans have lost their jobs and 93 
million people are either uninsured or 
underinsured. We need to reconsider 
our value system and make it clear 
that so few cannot have so very much, 
such obscene wealth—which is explod-
ing during the pandemic—while so 
many of our people are living in eco-
nomic desperation. 
Now is the time to develop a new set 
of priorities and a new set of moral val-
ues for this country. Now is the time to 
tax the winnings of a handful of bil-
lionaires to improve the health and 
well-being of tens of millions of Ameri-
cans. The time is long overdue for the 
Senate to act on behalf of the working 
class of this country, the people who 
are hurting like they have never hurt 
before—not in our lifetime—and have 
the courage to tell the billionaire 
class, who are doing phenomenally 
well, that they cannot have it all. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-
night to talk about a couple of issues I 
know that will be considered—at least 
I hope will be considered—in the nego-
tiations that are under way. 
Later in this hour, we will be joined 
by three of my colleagues: Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, Senator BLUMENTHAL, and 
Senator DUCKWORTH. Each of us will be 
talking about these issues from dif-
ferent perspectives, but all focused on 
those in our society who are most at 
risk in the midst of this worldwide pan-
demic and in the midst of this eco-
nomic and jobs crisis that we are con-
fronting right now. We know that this 
is the most difficult public health cri-
sis in a century, and one of largest, if 
not in the top two, job crises we have 
ever faced. 
When we talk about Americans who 
are most at risk, among them are, of 
course, older Americans. Tonight, I 
will spend some time talking about 
older Americans in nursing homes who 
are at risk if we don’t take action, and 
people with disabilities who need the 
benefit of—as do many older Americans 
need the benefit of—home and commu-
nity-based services; and, third, Ameri-
cans who are in communities of color 
who need the benefit of Medicaid, 
among other programs that we should 
be focused on. 
Let me start with nursing homes. We 
know that in the context of nursing 
homes, the skilled care that is provided 
there is the highest level of care for an 
older American or sometimes a person 
with a disability. We also know that is 
care that is provided to men and 
women who have done so much for the 
country—Americans who have fought 
our wars, worked in our factories, built 
the middle class, built America in so 
many ways and gave us life and love. 
All that they ask and all their families 
ask is when they are in a long-term 
care 
facility, 
especially 
a 
nursing 
home, that they are receiving skilled 
care that is quality care, and in the 
midst of this crisis, that we are taking 
every step possible to protect them 
from the virus and to keep them safe. 
Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened 
in America today. 
As we speak tonight, more than just 
a couple of days ago, the number was 
lower than this, but now it is more 
than 62,000 Americans who have died in 
long-term care settings. Most of those 
are in nursing homes. When you add up 
the number of residents who con-
tracted the virus and died with the 
workers who have died, the number is 
more than 62,000 Americans. That is

August 5, 2020 
about 40 percent of all the deaths in 
America. We have to take steps to get 
those numbers down—both the death 
number as well as the case number. Of 
course, the two are directly related. 
A number of months ago, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, who joins us on the floor 
tonight, and I introduced S. 3768, which 
was the Nursing Home Protection and 
Prevention Act. It was a proposed $20 
billion investment in best practices. 
The tragedy here is that we know what 
works to get the death number down in 
nursing homes. We know exactly what 
works. Those nursing homes that were 
implementing 
these 
best 
practices 
months ago—way back, sometime in 
early March or even in February—are 
the ones that had lower numbers, for-
tunately, of deaths and case numbers. 
We know that you have to invest in a 
series of best practices, which means 
having 
enough 
personal 
protective 
equipment for everyone in a nursing 
home, but especially the residents and 
workers. We know that is essential to 
keeping people safe. We know that 
testing is part of that, of course, and 
having the capacity to test frequently 
and to have results transmitted very 
quickly. 
Cohorting is not a term that we hear 
a lot about, but it is a very simple con-
cept. Cohorting means you separate 
the residents with COVID–19 from 
those who don’t have it. As easy as 
that is to say, it is more difficult to in-
stitute in a nursing home. Sometimes 
you have to retrofit. Sometimes you 
have to take other steps that funding 
is needed for. 
Cohorting works, which stands to 
reason, but we know it works now that 
we have some experience with the 
virus. 
We know that surge teams are criti-
cally important, as well, as part of 
these best practices. If you have an 
outbreak in a nursing home—and we 
have had so many examples of that in 
my home State of Pennsylvania and in 
so many other States—when the virus 
is spreading and there is a crisis in 
that nursing home because of the virus, 
you might need more help. You may 
need more doctors or nurses or cer-
tified nurse’s assistants or so many 
other critical personnel in that nursing 
home. So $20 billion is a good down 
payment on protecting Americans in 
nursing homes. Our bill would do that. 
I am grateful for the help of Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, as well as so many other 
Members of the Senate who joined in 
that bill. Unfortunately, the bill pro-
posed—I guess it was July 27 or one of 
the last days of July. Unfortunately, 
the bill proposed by the majority has 
no meaningful investment in these best 
practices. We have to ask ourselves: Is 
this what America is going to settle 
for, that the greatest country in the 
history of the world is going to throw 
up our hands and say: There is really 
nothing we can do. It is a pernicious 
virus and the virus is spreading in con-
gregate care settings like nursing 
homes, where you have individuals who 
are particularly vulnerable. So there is 
not much we can do. 
That is a defeatist, anti-American at-
titude. We know we can get these num-
bers down if we make the investment. 
The America that we claim to be would 
have a full-court press, a pull-out-all- 
the-stops effort to make sure that we 
get these numbers down. 
I don’t think most Americans believe 
that we should throw up our hands and 
surrender to another 62,000-plus deaths 
a couple of months from now, which is 
where we could be headed if we don’t 
take these steps. No one would assert 
that we can get these numbers down to 
zero or that there is some magic wand 
that will allow us to remove this 
threat from those we love so much in 
these nursing homes. But, my God, in 
America we are not going to take steps 
we know will work to get the case 
number down and the death number 
down? 
I think America is ready for an ac-
tion plan that has been developed here 
in the United States by smart people 
who know how to attack this problem. 
So issue No. 1 is the most at-risk 
Americans. 
The second issue in terms of at-risk 
Americans is older Americans and peo-
ple with disabilities who need the ben-
efit of home and community-based 
services. Again, the Republican bill 
proposed by the majority here in the 
Senate doesn’t mention Medicaid. In 
order to attack the nursing home 
issue—the nursing home death prob-
lem—or to invest in home and commu-
nity-based services, we need to invest 
in Medicaid. We must stabilize and 
strengthen home and community-based 
services to keep older adults and peo-
ple with disabilities both safe and 
healthy. 
To do that, you have to pay the 
workers more. The workers should be 
paid a living wage. When those workers 
are going into a home to provide that 
critical care, they should be provided 
the personal protective equipment that 
they need to keep themselves safe and 
also that person with a disability or a 
senior, if someone is coming into their 
home. 
Without sufficient dollars, human 
service organizations cannot recruit 
and retain the direct support profes-
sionals and personal care attendants 
who provide essential healthcare and 
community inclusion services for sen-
iors and people with disabilities. 
This is just one example, among 
many. This is a picture of Marisa. She 
is from Allegheny County, PA. You can 
see by the picture—you may not see it 
from a distance—that the T-shirt says: 
‘‘Proud to Be Your Neighbor.’’ You can 
barely read the words: ‘‘Giant Eagle.’’ 
That is one of the great supermarket 
chains in Southeastern Pennsylvania. 
Marisa uses home and community- 
based services to live independently. 
She is a volunteer at a food pantry and 
works at one of the Giant Eagle gro-
cery stores and has done that work for 
19 years. All these years later, she is 
one of the beneficiaries of this pro-
gram. She can get services in the home 
and in her community. 
The key to this is that without dedi-
cated dollars, agencies like Achieva, 
one of the many agencies that does this 
work and provides such services—these 
agencies will not be able to provide 
services that people with disabilities 
like Marisa and families like hers need. 
Pennsylvania, like many States, has 
so-called centers for independent liv-
ing. They told me just last week on a 
phone call that as for helping people 
move from a nursing home or a con-
gregate care setting, where often the 
risk is higher with the virus, often 
their ability to move people from that 
setting who want to go into a home or 
an apartment is fully dependent on the 
dollars from the funding they have. 
They have been able to move some peo-
ple, but very few because they don’t 
have the funding to move them. 
Another implication of this concern 
we have is that the direct service pro-
viders have scaled back these services. 
Most don’t have enough cash reserve 
for longer than a month because of the 
lack of funding. Just imagine that. 
I introduced a bill 4 months ago, S. 
3544, which provided dedicated dollars 
to respond to this crisis. But it wasn’t 
until the HEROES Act passed by the 
House—not yet passed by the Senate, 
but passed by the House 10 weeks ago— 
included provisions of my bill, which 
was supported here in the Senate by 28 
Senators. 
I have just two more issues. One is 
Medicaid and the other issue I will ad-
dress is on the liability debate. 
Of course, we know what the Med-
icaid program is. It has been around 
since 1965. Medicaid is the program 
that helps 75 million Americans. If you 
add up the children on Medicaid, which 
is about 31 million children, and people 
with disabilities, which is another 9 
million, you have roughly 40 of the 75 
million. 
Medicaid is not just a program. It is 
a program that saves lives, maybe even 
more so in the middle of a public 
health emergency that we have been in 
all these months. 
Medicaid is also, I believe, a reflec-
tion of who we are as a nation. I think 
it also reflects whom we value. That is 
why Medicaid is so critical to seniors 
living in nursing homes who are some-
times from relatively middle-class fam-
ilies who could not afford long-term 
care. 
Many Americans with disabilities—as 
I mentioned, 9 million at last count, 
and of course, 31 million children— 
many of them live in rural Pennsyl-
vania, in rural America. In fact, if you 
look at it by percentage, it is often the 
case that in rural counties, there is a 
higher percentage of children on Med-
icaid and the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program. There is a higher per-
centage in a rural county than children 
in a county that has a lot of urban 
communities in it. So rural and small 
town America depend heavily upon 
Medicaid.

August 5, 2020 
They depend upon Medicaid in an-
other way when you consider rural hos-
pitals. Often the largest employer in a 
rural county in Pennsylvania—or the 
second or third largest employer at 
least—is a rural hospital. We have 48 of 
our 67 counties that are rural, and in 
those 48 rural counties, more than half 
of the top employers in the county are 
hospitals—or I should say the top or 
the second or third highest employers. 
So, of the top three employers in the 
most rural counties, you have a hos-
pital—and Medicaid is so vital to those 
rural hospitals—operating on a thin 
margin and is evermore stressed in a 
pandemic. 
Medicaid expansion, of course, made 
it possible for millions of Americans to 
get healthcare through the Affordable 
Care Act, and we just saw yesterday, in 
the State of Missouri, the vote there to 
expand Medicaid. It has been happening 
in a lot of States that may not have 
embraced Medicaid expansion a num-
ber of years ago but that are now em-
bracing it. 
Medicaid is a safety net in this time 
of crisis, in terms of the economic and 
jobs crisis we are living through. It, of 
course, impacts State budgets. One of 
the biggest expenditures in State budg-
ets is Medicaid. For example, in our 
State of Pennsylvania, our unemploy-
ment rate in June was 13 percent, and 
there were 821,000 people out of work. 
In some counties, the unemployment 
rate is 14 percent or 15 percent or 16 
percent or 17 percent. So, when 821,000 
people are out of work in a State, a lot 
of them have lost their healthcare, and 
they have turned to Medicaid. 
Now, in the Families First bill, way 
back in the early part of March, the 
matching dollars—the so-called FMAP, 
which means the Federal matching dol-
lars for Medicaid—were increased by 6.2 
percent. That was a good step in the 
right direction, but Governors in blue 
and red States will tell you now, as a 
lot of other people will tell you now, 
they need an additional increase in 
Medicaid. I think the 14 percent FMAP, 
or matching dollar percentage, in the 
Heroes Act in the House made a lot of 
sense. I hope we can get to that num-
ber in the bill we are considering or we 
hope to be considering soon. 
The Republican bill does not have ad-
ditional dollars for Medicaid, matching 
dollars, despite the fact that many of 
the Republican Governors around the 
country have asked for this kind of 
help. So I hope that will change as the 
negotiations move forward. 
I want to end on time if I can, maybe 
in the next 10 minutes. That is the 
goal. 
Finally, I want to talk about the li-
ability shield issue. There are a lot of 
different perspectives on this. Let me 
talk about it in the context of those we 
are discussing tonight—seniors in nurs-
ing homes, people with disabilities who 
need home- and community-based serv-
ices, folks who are in communities of 
color, and others who need the benefit 
of Medicaid. 
In my judgment, the Republicans’ 
proposal, when you look at the liabil-
ity proposal, would slam the doors of 
justice on those who want to bring an 
action. We have had a lot of com-
mentary lately about our criminal jus-
tice system and its defects, its short-
comings, and even about the racism 
that, I believe, permeates that system. 
In this context, we are talking about 
the civil justice system. 
What do we do about that part of our 
justice system—the ability for a citizen 
to bring an action in a court of law to 
deal with an injury of some kind either 
by way of negligence or intentional 
conduct? 
In this context, we have a proposal 
by the majority to short-circuit, to un-
dermine, that system of justice. It will 
affect those we are here to talk about 
tonight in very real ways whether they 
are low-income workers or people with 
disabilities or older adults or even, 
more broadly, essential workers. 
Why do I say that? 
If you are going to use a crisis like 
we are in now to try to achieve gains 
that some in this Chamber have tried 
to achieve for years in the so-called 
tort system—really, the civil justice 
system—and you paint with a very 
broad brush, you are going to slam 
those doors of justice pretty tightly. 
Just by way of comment from a 
Georgetown 
law 
professor, 
David 
Vladeck, in reference to this proposal, 
he recently explained the ‘‘extreme 
reach’’ of the proposal vastly exceeds 
‘‘any prior ‘tort reform’ bills that have 
been introduced in Congress.’’ He went 
on to call this corporate liability 
shield provision ‘‘essentially impen-
etrable.’’ That is how he described the 
strength of this shield. He warned that 
such proposals would give ‘‘license for 
irresponsible and reckless conduct.’’ 
When it comes to liability, it would 
also preempt all State laws requiring 
businesses to act reasonably. It would 
impose a heightened—so-called—clear 
and convincing burden of proof on 
plaintiffs instead of the typical prepon-
derance-of-the-evidence standard. 
We know that in our system, in a 
civil case, the preponderance-of-the- 
evidence standard is the lowest stand-
ard. Just a little more than 50 percent 
of the jury would have to make the de-
termination in terms of liability. We 
know that, in the criminal system, in 
order to find guilt, it has to be found 
beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the 
highest standard. There are some cases 
that are given the middle standard of— 
so-called—clear and convincing. That 
burden of proof is right in the middle. 
In a civil lawsuit, this bill would ele-
vate it from a preponderance to clear 
and convincing, which would be, I 
think, a step in the wrong direction. 
The proposal would also force a 
worker, a consumer, a resident of a 
nursing home, or even a patient to 
show that a business failed to make 
‘‘reasonable efforts’’ to comply with 
any applicable government standard. 
The issue here is that the Federal 
Government hasn’t issued any manda-
tory standards. So these entities— 
many of them employers of one kind or 
another, sometimes very large employ-
ers—would be able to follow any stand-
ard they would choose. They could 
choose a local standard or a State 
standard or a Federal standard even if 
the one they were to choose would be 
the weakest standard as it relates to 
the protection of the worker. 
What the administration could have 
done, which I called for and many 
Members of the Senate called for, 
would have been to have promulgated a 
standard against which the actions of 
an employer could be measured. 
One idea was to promulgate an emer-
gency temporary standard. I don’t 
know why the Department of Labor 
wouldn’t do that in the middle of the 
worst public health crisis in a cen-
tury—why the Department of Labor 
would not simply take that step. That 
would give clarity to employers. That 
would give clarity to so many Ameri-
cans about what the standard would be 
in a workplace to keep people safe from 
a raging virus, but they chose not to do 
that. 
Without any mandatory standards, it 
is wide open. Then we are supposed to 
believe that taking away the right to 
bring an action is somehow going to be 
just fine for a period of time. An emer-
gency temporary standard by the De-
partment of Labor should have been 
promulgated months ago, and it could 
still do it and remove the uncer-
tainty—the lack of clarity—that pre-
vails right now. 
With regard to the liability provi-
sions, 
this 
bill 
would 
immunize 
healthcare 
providers 
and 
facilities 
from 
any 
claims 
arising 
from 
‘‘coronavirus-related healthcare serv-
ices.’’ 
That is pretty broad. How does the 
bill define that? The bill defines that as 
follows: the treatment of patients ‘‘for 
any purpose,’’ not merely the treat-
ment of COVID–19 patients during this 
public health emergency. That is about 
as broad as it gets, and that impen-
etrable liability shield would be in 
place for several years. 
It gets worse when it comes to people 
with disabilities. To add insult to in-
jury, just consider what we did last 
week. Our Nation celebrated the 30th 
anniversary of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act—a law that extends civil 
rights protections to people with dis-
abilities in every State. President 
George H. W. Bush signed the bill into 
law, and Republicans and Democrats 
and Independents all over the country 
celebrated its 30th anniversary. 
Literally, the next day, the majority 
proposed this corporate liability shield, 
which would blow a hole in the protec-
tions provided by the so-called ADA 
after the celebration of 30 years. That 
bill, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, makes it possible for people with 
disabilities to be full participants in 
American society, but this corporate 
liability shield would undermine those 
very protections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4918 
August 5, 2020 
It would decimate Federal protec-
tions granted under other landmark 
employment and civil rights laws, in-
cluding the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act, the so-called ADEA; the 
Genetic 
Information 
Nondiscrimina-
tion Act; and OSHA, the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act, which is one of 
the seminal actions, or pieces of legis-
lation, to protect workers. It would 
also adversely impact the Fair Labor 
Standards Act as well as title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I don’t 
know how you could have more of a 
wrecking ball in place for these land-
mark pieces of legislation in the mid-
dle of a pandemic. 
I will wrap up by saying that we have 
a lot of work to do, obviously, in these 
negotiations. In the midst of the nego-
tiations, we ought to be thinking about 
the most vulnerable, whether they be 
older Americans, children, people with 
disabilities, or folks in communities of 
color, who have been adversely im-
pacted in so many ways and evermore 
so in this time of crisis. 
I will not enter into it the RECORD, 
because it will be in the RECORD any-
way, but I am holding in my hand a 
letter that we sent to Leader MCCON-
NELL that outlines all of these con-
cerns. It is a letter, led by Senator 
DUCKWORTH
from 
Illinois, 
Senator 
WARREN from Massachusetts, and me, 
as well as now more than 40 of our col-
leagues, which goes through these con-
cerns that we have for investments in 
strategies to get the nursing home 
death number down and for invest-
ments in home- and community-based 
services. It goes through the concerns 
we raised about the corporate liability 
shield, as well as about an overdue in-
vestment in Medicaid, which is the pro-
gram that takes care of the most vul-
nerable among us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am grateful to have the chance to fol-
low my friend from Pennsylvania, who 
has shown such great leadership with 
respect to healthcare and particularly 
with respect to the nursing home popu-
lation. I am delighted to join him to 
discuss what COVID is doing to the 
elder Americans who are in our nursing 
homes and long-term care facilities, 
because this illness has swept like a 
savage scythe through those facilities. 
In my small State of Rhode Island, 
750 residents of long-term care facili-
ties have died of COVID. We just 
crossed 1,000 deaths statewide, and 750 
are at these facilities. If that doesn’t 
attract the concern of this Senate, 
something is very wrong with this Sen-
ate. 
Across the country, the death toll in 
nursing homes and long-term care fa-
cilities, just as Senator CASEY said, is 
62,000 Americans. My dad served for 5 
years in the Vietnam conflict. In the 
decades of the Vietnam conflict, we 
sustained over 58,000 American mili-
tary casualties. 
That means the death toll in our 
nursing homes and long-term care fa-
cilities—just in COVID, just in these 
months—is greater than the death toll 
of our soldiers in Vietnam. 
And if that is not enough to attract 
the attention of the Senate, something 
is wrong with the Senate. 
In Rhode Island, there is a little 
nursing home—just by way of exam-
ple—called Hallworth House. Hallworth 
House is a great little place. It has 
been operating for half a century. It 
opened in 1968. It has a five-star rating 
from CMS. They do a great job. 
It was announced that it will perma-
nently close at the end of August due 
to COVID. It had 51 residents, and by 
June, 29 had been infected; 12 had died. 
Of its staff, 20 were infected and had 
to be quarantined. It couldn’t survive 
that. It is closing. 
And the stories behind the institu-
tions like Hallworth House are the sto-
ries of people like Therese in Lincoln. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania is ami-
cably disposed to women named The-
rese. 
Therese’s mom Germaine is 88 years 
old. She has Alzheimer’s. She is a resi-
dent of a nursing home in nearby Man-
ville, RI. That facility has not allowed 
visitation since March 11. Therese 
hasn’t seen her mom since March 11. 
This is a woman with Alzheimer’s, liv-
ing in a facility. As a result, her mom’s 
cognition has declined. The presence of 
her daughter was part of what kept her 
active, kept her moving. She used to 
take her for walks every day. 
Now, the best they can do is Skype, 
and her mom barely recognizes the lit-
tle image on Skype. 
So behind 750 deaths, behind col-
lapsing institutions that have served 
elderly people for 50 years are these 
personal stories of broken relation-
ships. 
Barry in Narragansett has been mar-
ried to his wife Dorothy for 46 years. 
Now he can only see her through 
Plexiglas and only twice. That is a real 
cost. 
Germaine, 88 years old, not being 
able to see her daughter; Barry and 
Dorothy, after 46 years of marriage, 
separated by Plexiglas, unable to see 
each other. 
Those are small concerns, but you 
can multiply them across the popu-
lation of our nursing homes and of our 
long-term care facilities. 
And if that isn’t something that the 
Senate will care about, then there is 
something wrong with the Senate. 
We have tried to give the Senate 
something to do, something we can be 
for. So we have the Nursing Home 
COVID–19 Protection and Prevention 
Act. It has $20 billion for staffing sup-
port, for testing—because there is not 
enough testing—for personal protective 
equipment, for the staff who serve, 
really heroically and tragically under-
paid in these circumstances, in these 
facilities. 
It encourages successful practices 
like cohorting. It provides responses 
like surge teams. When a place be-
comes so hit with COVID that the staff 
are quarantined out, who is going to 
come in? We were talking about de-
ploying the National Guard in nursing 
homes. No, we need trained surge 
teams that provide for those things and 
data so people learn fast and know 
what to do to take care of this. 
We have a solution, and I hope very 
much the Senate will care enough to 
consider our solution in whatever bill 
we end up beginning to negotiate on. 
I will close by talking about what 
has been called liability protection but 
is, in fact, corporate negligence am-
nesty. 
I have been around here a little 
while, and I have been through the im-
migration debate. And in this building, 
we heard people talk about children— 
children who were brought to this 
country who were innocent of any mis-
conduct. In fact, they were minors. 
They were, by law, innocent, and they 
had done no one any harm. Children 
guilty of no misconduct, innocent who 
had done no one any harm. And what 
was the word we heard? ‘‘Amnesty.’’ 
We can’t have amnesty. There are laws 
around here that have to be followed— 
for children who were innocent and had 
done no one any harm. 
What does the corporate negligence 
amnesty bill do? It gives corporations 
that are not innocent, that are neg-
ligent, that have caused harm, and 
that have even caused death, amnesty. 
If that is the standard, when you are 
small and innocent and a child and 
have done no harm, then we are going 
to be outraged at any amnesty for you, 
at any kindness, but if you are a big 
corporation and you actually are neg-
ligent and as a result of your neg-
ligence someone dies of this disease, 
what is the solution? Amnesty. That is 
what we will do. We will help our cor-
porate friends. 
If that is where this Senate is going 
to stand, then there is something 
wrong with this Senate. 
Oh, and by the way, this is no small 
thing. This is no small thing, by the 
way. The right to a jury began, really, 
at about the time of Henry II, in the 
12th century, and followed through 
English common law, through Black-
stone’s legendary commentaries, the 
book that informed the early creation 
of American law, through to the Dec-
laration of Independence, where the 
jury was part of the casus belli of our 
country, and then into our Constitu-
tion. 
This is an important part of our 
Anglo-American rule of law tradition, 
and the fact that we are willing to 
throw it over the side because big cor-
porations come and say: We can’t bear 
the indignity of having to be treated 
equally and fairly in court with these 
people we are so used to pushing 
around in legislatures where we have 
lobbyists and money—that is why we 
are going to throw out eight centuries 
of tradition and learning? 
Do you want to know how long ago 
that was? There is a great movie called

August 5, 2020 
‘‘Lion in Winter,’’ a wonderful movie 
about Henry II. That is when this tra-
dition started, and we are going to 
throw it out here for corporations that 
have been so negligent as to cause 
death and injury? 
Something is wrong. 
I yield the floor, and I thank the Sen-
ator from Connecticut, my friend, Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, for his indulgence 
for that historical exercise. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
would be happy to listen for much 
longer to that kind of eloquence and 
enormously powerful and significant 
comment on the blanket shield that 
some of our Republican colleagues seek 
to provide to wrongdoers, whether they 
are corporate wrongdoers or others 
who have severely harmed innocent 
people. 
And it is not just about the rule of 
law that provides accountability for 
victims and survivors of wrongdoing, it 
is also an important part of the deter-
rent function of our legal system. 
Accountability 
and 
penalties 
for 
wrongdoing are essential to protecting 
vulnerable people in the future, and so 
our side will stand for keeping the 
courthouse doors open. Those rights 
that some of our Republican colleagues 
would destroy are essential not only to 
the Anglo-Saxon concept of rule of law, 
they are also important to vindicating 
right. 
And some of the folks who lived in 
nursing homes and who passed away as 
a result of this virus are veterans of 
wars. They fought for these rights. 
They risked their lives and sacrificed, 
and many were wounded, and they have 
now reached an age where they are in 
nursing homes. 
But one of the reasons they fought 
was to preserve these very rights that 
some of our colleagues would sacrifice 
so needlessly and so readily. 
Today, we are here not to look back 
and to lay blame. There will be time 
enough to establish a commission, as I 
hope there will be, a 9/11-type commis-
sion, to learn from the mistakes that 
were made. Obviously, we need to hold 
accountable other countries, including 
China, who may have failed to reveal 
the extent and magnitude of the health 
threat posed by this pandemic. We need 
to hold accountable officials in this 
country who may have failed to warn 
and who denied the severity of this 
pandemic. 
We need to look forward, and right 
now, in this relief package, save Amer-
ica from the raging pandemic that con-
tinues, a health crisis, and from the 
collapse of our economy, happening be-
fore our eyes, an economic crisis. 
And part of our package must be to 
provide funds for those nursing homes 
where those veterans live, where grand-
parents live, community leaders, peo-
ple who have served our Nation in all 
kinds of capacity, raised our children, 
served in our religious places of wor-
ship, and been there for us. 
They have served and sacrificed, and 
we owe them places that are safe and 
clean and, yes, healthy—at least con-
forming to standards that we know are 
necessary to preserve them from dis-
ease. 
And here is the blunt truth: A dis-
proportionate number of the deaths 
have occurred in these nursing homes. 
In Connecticut, as is the case in 
many other States, the pandemic has 
hit nursing homes especially hard. 
Of over 4,400 COVID–19 deaths in Con-
necticut so far, about 65 percent of all 
of 
them—that 
is 
2,900—have 
been 
amongst individuals living in nursing 
homes. That is a searing indictment of 
our society. It is staggering. 
And so I am proud to join with my 
colleague, Senator CASEY, others who 
have come to the floor, like Senator 
WHITEHOUSE. 
I 
especially 
want 
to 
thank Senator CASEY because his lead-
ership has been so instrumental in this 
effort. 
We need now to make nursing home 
reform and funding part of the next 
package we pass here. We have all seen 
the signs ‘‘Heroes Work Here’’ outside 
nursing homes, and they are well de-
served. 
I have visited a number of them. 
Most recently, the Riverside Health 
and Rehabilitation Center in East 
Hartford and the Mary Wade facility in 
New Haven. 
What struck me most was, in fact, 
the heroism of these workers. Heroes 
do work there. They have put their 
lives on the line. They have reported 
for duty, despite the threats to their 
own well-being and the threats to their 
own health and safety and their fami-
lies. They have been there for the peo-
ple who live in those nursing homes. 
They deserve to be recognized and re-
warded, not just in work but in money, 
in hazardous duty pay. The $13 per hour 
on top of regular wages that is part of 
the HEROES Act. It is known as the 
Heroes Fund. It should be part of what 
we do next as a relief package. We need 
to put our money where our mouth is 
in saying we support those essential 
frontline workers. Let’s recognize and 
reward them but also retain them and 
make sure we recruit more of them be-
cause we need more of them. 
Let’s put our money where our 
mouth is, not just for our frontline 
workers, not just for the hazardous 
duty pay, not just for the Heroes Fund 
but for the people they serve in the 
conditions and care that prevail in 
these nursing homes. The heroes are 
not only the workers, they are the resi-
dents because they are veterans, teach-
ers, firefighters, nurses, parents and 
grandparents, friends, community lead-
ers, mentors. They are the Little 
League coaches who are now at an age 
where they are not going to the base-
ball field. They are the firefighters and 
police who once stood proudly in pro-
tecting our communities and now de-
pend on others to help them stand. 
We know that older Americans are 
more vulnerable to this insidious virus. 
We cannot simply surrender. We must 
act and we must protect those nursing 
home residents. Let’s also be blunt 
about where the effects fall because 
these health disparities also have a ra-
cial equity component. They not only 
affect older people who are more vul-
nerable, they also affect older people in 
communities of color even more heav-
ily. 
Those disparities are unacceptable. A 
New York Times analysis of nursing 
homes found that nearly all—97 per-
cent—of Connecticut nursing homes 
where at least a quarter of the resi-
dents are Black or Latino reported a 
coronavirus case. So there is a gap be-
tween homes with significant minority 
populations and homes that do not 
have them. Addressing this crisis in 
our nursing homes means we must ad-
dress the racism that accounts for 
those disparities and mars our Nation. 
We can never forget that these resi-
dents of nursing homes are more than 
numbers, more than statistics; they 
are real people. As shocking as the 
numbers are, they are less dramatic 
than what you and I have seen when we 
visit those nursing homes. And my 
guess is, everybody listening to me 
now, almost all Americans are touched 
by the deaths that have occurred there 
in one way or another, directly or indi-
rectly. 
So I am proud to join Senator CASEY 
in fighting for the Nursing Home 
COVID–19 Protection and Prevention 
Act. It would provide $20 billion in 
emergency funding specifically tar-
geted for protecting those nursing 
home residents and providing the kind 
of 
personal 
protective 
equipment, 
training, and other kinds of resources 
that are necessary for making sure 
that the heroes, the frontline workers, 
have the capacity to do their jobs and 
the heroes who live in those nursing 
homes both receive the care and re-
sources they need. 
I am also proud to have introduced 
legislation with Senator BOOKER, the 
Quality Care for Nursing Home Resi-
dents and Workers During COVID–19 
Act, which would provide for additional 
reforms to address the egregious num-
ber of nursing home deaths in Con-
necticut and throughout the country. 
It would require weekly tests of every 
resident and testing for every shift for 
healthcare workers. It would also man-
date that all healthcare workers have 
sufficient PPE and comprehensive safe-
ty training around COVID–19, and each 
facility have a full-time infection-con-
trol preventionist on staff to keep resi-
dents and workers safe. It would guar-
antee that sufficient staff is available 
to facilitate weekly virtual visits be-
tween residents and their families. The 
sense of isolation of many of these 
nursing home residents is one of the 
major failings of how they have been 
treated during this pandemic. 
We need to move forward without 
delay. There is no excuse for spending 
time debating this issue. We all know 
that these steps are necessary. There

should be no politics. Nursing homes do 
not provide care for red or blue resi-
dents. They do not employ red or blue 
frontline workers. This cause should be 
bipartisan. 
Unfortunately, the Republican pro-
posal fails to provide virtually any re-
sources—certainly nothing like the $20 
billion that we are asking. So I hope we 
will move forward, as reasonable, car-
ing minds and hearts must do, and 
make sure we provide the resources 
necessary to do justice to these heroes.

f 
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES 
ACT 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
am speaking tonight on behalf of the 
millions of Americans living with dis-
abilities, and on behalf of the many 
more who, whether they know it or 
not, are just 1 day, one accident, one 
devastating medical diagnosis away 
from acquiring a disability as well. 
I come to the floor on their behalf be-
cause I came to the floor by rolling 
through the Capitol’s corridors in the 
wheelchair you see me sitting on now, 
and I could come to the floor because 
30 years ago, Congress passed the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, grant-
ing millions of Americans like me bet-
ter access to the full, independent lives 
we deserve. 
That 
landmark 
legislation 
only 
passed because of the dedicated activ-
ists who proudly crowded in front of 
this building in 1990 to demand that 
their country finally give those with 
disabilities the basic rights the Con-
stitution provided. 
It only became law because dozens of 
them got out of their wheelchairs, set 
down their crutches, and crawled up 
the 83 steps of the Capitol Building— 
because Jennifer Keelan, an 8-year-old 
with cerebral palsy, pulled herself to 
the top of the steps, saying, ‘‘I’ll take 
all night if I have to,’’ and because 
those around her refused to leave a fel-
low American behind, offering Jennifer 
support when she needed it, one step, 
one shoulder to lean on at a time. 
Thirty years ago, these activists 
changed Senators’ hearts, minds, and, 
most importantly, votes. Thirty years 
ago, this legislative body said that peo-
ple like me mattered. But last week, 
Republicans in this Chamber proposed 
a bill that said we don’t. 
I speak out of a sense of frustration 
as I watch my Republican colleagues, 
including the ones who once cham-
pioned the ADA, attempt to recon-
struct, brick by brick, the shameful 
wall of exclusion that Congress sought 
to tear down three decades ago. 
Less than a week after celebrating 
the 30th anniversary of a Republican 
President declaring that the ADA 
would bring us ‘‘closer to that day 
when no Americans will ever again be 
deprived of their basic guarantee of 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness,’’ Senate Republicans have put 
forward legislation that threatens to 
deprive our community of those same 
fundamental rights. 
Many interpreted the timing of the 
HEALS Act as confirmation of an 
alarming fact: The GOP has declared 
war on the disability community and 
the ADA. I truly hope this is not the 
case and that the timing was a deeply 
unfortunate coincidence, but at the end 
of the day, actions speak far louder 
than words. 
If Senate Republicans want to dem-
onstrate that they value life, that they 
value the civil rights of all Americans, 
they must join Democrats in sup-
porting two measures that would show 
the disability community that their 
party actually gives a darn about 
them. 
First, we need to save lives by pre-
venting 
mass 
institutionalization. 
Placing individuals with disabilities 
into congregate care facilities where 
the risks of serious illness or death are 
high is reckless and unacceptable. To 
achieve this goal, we must increase the 
Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent-
ages, the FMAP, by 10 percent for Med-
icaid 
Home 
and 
Community-Based 
Services. 
Republicans and Democratic Gov-
ernors alike desperately need this 
change. The House already passed this 
10 percent FMAP increase months ago, 
and the Senate must follow suit in any 
COVID–19 relief deal that is reached. 
Real-world experience has tragically 
demonstrated 
how 
vulnerable 
con-
gregate care settings are to deadly 
superspreader events like COVID–19. 
We know from existing data that 
Americans with intellectual and devel-
opmental disabilities are killed at far 
higher rates than other Americans 
when infected with COVID–19. So in-
vesting in State efforts to provide Med-
icaid 
services 
to 
vulnerable 
popu-
lations in the safety of their own 
homes is just a commonsense policy 
that would save countless lives. 
Second, Senate Republicans must 
abandon efforts to gut the ADA, once 
and for all. Disability rights are human 
rights, and these civil rights must 
never become optional benefits that 
can be taken away whenever it is con-
venient or cheaper for employers or 
those who are in power. Allowing busi-
nesses to exclude employees with dis-
abilities from reopening plans is ex-
actly the type of discrimination that 
the ADA sought to abolish. Yet the 
GOP HEALS Act seeks to relegate mil-
lions of Americans back to second- 
class status, sending the offensive mes-
sage that our community can be cast 
aside if the cost to companies are too 
high. 
But the harsh reality is that these ef-
forts are anything but new. Decades 
ago, when my friend Judy Heumann 
passed her exams to earn a teaching li-
cense, she was nevertheless denied the 
license by the school board all because 
of so-called concerns about legal liabil-
ity in the workplace. 
They said that because Judy used a 
wheelchair, she represented a fire haz-
ard and could not safely teach in a 
classroom. Do these types of concerns 
sound familiar? The passage of the 
ADA was supposed to relegate such 
workplace discrimination stories to the 
history books. Those outrageous exam-
ples of injustice were supposed to rep-
resent the nightmares of yesterday, 
not the reality of tomorrow made pos-
sible by a Republican proposal today. 
Yet here we are in 2020, and Senate 
Republicans are shamelessly using a 
deadly pandemic as cover to gut the 
ADA and hoist that brick wall of exclu-
sion right back up. No one is asking for 
special treatment. What we are asking 
for is to not take away the basic rights 
the Constitution promised all those 
centuries ago and this Chamber af-
firmed three decades ago under a Re-
publican President. 
So as we debate this next relief pack-
age, the questions that every Member 
of this body must ask are simple: Are 
we going to leave Americans with dis-
abilities behind? Are their lives worth 
saving? Are their jobs expendable? 
For anyone with a conscience—for 
anyone with any ounce of compassion 
or even just a lick of respect for the 
rule of law, the answer to those ques-
tions should be obvious. 
You know, in the Army our Soldier’s 
Creed included never leaving a fallen 
comrade behind. I am alive today be-
cause my buddies in Iraq risked their 
lives to recover my body because they 
thought I was dead and refused to leave 
me behind. 
The activists who crawled their way 
up the Capitol steps did much the same 
for each other: helping one another 
make their way up inch by inch, closer 
to the Chamber I am sitting in right 
now, refusing to let any one of them 
struggle—to let any one of them fall 
behind. 
I am on the floor tonight because of 
those two acts of courage from two dif-
ferent groups of people continents 
away and a decade and a half apart. 
Now, as a Senator, my North Star is 
paying that debt of honor forward and 
trying to live up to the sacrifices they 
made for others. So today and tomor-
row and the tomorrow after that, you 
better believe I am going to keep fight-
ing to hold the Senate accountable for 
living up to the motto of the Nation we 
serve: ‘‘E Pluribus Unum,’’ Out of 
Many, One, because this country was 
born on that idea. It was born from the 
phrase ‘‘We the People.’’ And it grew 
out of the belief that there is nothing 
more powerful than the will of the citi-
zenry when the citizenry works with 
each other and for each other. 
Our response to this pandemic is a 
test of our faith in that Founding doc-
trine. If we focus on the ‘‘we’’—if we 
think about uniting the many into the 
one—then we can save lives and move 
past this national trauma together. 
But it is up to each one of us to act in 
a way that protects all of us, to act in 
a way that ensures no one, nobody, dis-
abled or otherwise, will be left behind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4921 
August 5, 2020 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
f 
COMMANDER JOHN SCOTT HANNON 
VETERANS 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2019 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be on the floor this evening, 
but I am here to discuss a significantly 
tragic issue that affects way too many 
Americans all across our country—cer-
tainly at home in Kansas—and that is 
the lack of treatment for mental 
health conditions and, in many in-
stances, the consequence that comes 
from that—suicide. 
Sadly, veterans in particular face 
risks for suicide, and, unfortunately, 
COVID–19 has increased the problem. 
Veterans have a higher rate of suicide 
and mental health issues than people 
who have not served in our armed serv-
ices. 
We know there is not a single expla-
nation or reason for suicide, and there 
is no single treatment for prevention 
strategy. One veteran lost to suicide is 
one too many, and, of course, we all 
have the obligation to help those who 
have served our Nation—those who 
fought bravely for our country—to help 
fix this tragedy. 
Every day that we fail to act is an-
other day we lose another 20 veterans 
to suicide. They need our help. 
I want to highlight one veteran who 
fought a battle with his mental health 
condition, CDR John Scott Hannon. 
Commander Hannon was a decorated 
Navy SEAL. I met his family through 
the 
Senator 
from 
Montana, 
Mr. 
TESTER. He, like every other veteran, 
was more than just what his service 
record would show. His family and 
friends remember him as a passionate 
mental health advocate for veterans. 
He tried to help other veterans who 
faced the same challenges that he did. 
They say he had a gentle heart and a 
fierce belief in taking actions to tackle 
big challenges. 
Sadly, Commander Hannon lost his 
fight with post-traumatic stress, bipo-
lar disorder, and the effects of a trau-
matic brain injury. He lost that fight 
in February 2018. He now lives on in the 
memories of his friends and family, and 
when S. 785 becomes law—the name-
sake of the Commander John Scott 
Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act—he will be remem-
bered even more—more by other Amer-
icans than his family and friends. 
I am proud to lead this effort in pas-
sage of this legislation, in its develop-
ment, its creation, in the studies and 
efforts, the conversations that went on 
with my colleagues in the Senate, our 
colleagues in the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, the veterans service orga-
nizations, and his family. I am proud to 
lead that effort with the Senator from 
Montana, the Senator who represents 
Commander Hannon’s family. 
For several months now, our com-
mittee has been working closely with 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
and the White House to improve upon 
and advance S. 785. This bill will make 
necessary investments in suicide pre-
vention. It will improve and support in-
novative research. It will make im-
provements and increase the avail-
ability of mental health care. 
This bill establishes a grant program 
championed by Mr. BOOZMAN, the Sen-
ator from Arkansas. The VA will be re-
quired to better collaborate with com-
munity organizations across the coun-
try, serving veterans. 
Senator TESTER, Senator BOOZMAN, 
and I come from rural States, and it is 
hard to find the services where they 
are necessary. If we can allow the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to deal 
with local organizations, we have a 
better chance of fighting suicide. 
This legislation represents a team ef-
fort. I appreciate Secretary Wilkie, 
David Ballenger, Cathy Haverstock, 
and Chris Anderson for their help and 
commitment 
in 
addressing 
mental 
health services. 
President Trump and his support for 
veterans is well recognized. The Second 
Lady, Karen Pence, has also been a 
long-time advocate for veterans’ men-
tal health, and I appreciate our con-
versations on this important topic. The 
staff at the White House and at the Do-
mestic Policy Council—Joe Grogan, 
Brooke Rollins, James Baehr, and Vir-
ginia McMillin—deserve recognition as 
well. 
The Senate VA committee is known 
for its spirit of bipartisanship, and I 
want to thank my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle for their input on this 
important legislation. Along with the 
lead sponsor of this legislation, Sen-
ator TESTER, and the efforts I men-
tioned of Senator BOOZMAN, I would 
recognize Senator SULLIVAN, Senator 
TILLIS, 
Senator 
CASSIDY, 
Senator 
ROUNDS, Senator CRAMER—the Pre-
siding Officer this evening—Senator 
LOEFFLER, Senator BLACKBURN, Sen-
ator MCSALLY, and Senator KAINE for 
their substantive contributions to sev-
eral primary sections of this bill. 
These 
contributions 
by 
our 
col-
leagues range from studies on over-
medication and suicidality, the effec-
tiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy 
on PTSD and TBI, a pilot program for 
post-traumatic growth, and many pro-
visions that will provide more direct 
oversight of the VA to ensure the De-
partment is equipped to better serve 
veterans. 
As a result, this bipartisan legisla-
tion has 51 cosponsors, and it received 
a unanimous 17-to-0 vote in the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs earlier 
this year, and today is the time we will 
pass this measure out of the Senate. 
I am calling on my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to do our part to 
make certain that every veteran has 
access to the lifesaving care and sup-
port they need. We need to ensure that 
every VA medical center is equipped 
with the proper personnel, evidence- 
based treatment options, and the best 
research-informed care to fit the needs 
of each veteran who walks through its 
doors. 
For veterans and servicemembers 
like CDR John Scott Hannon, we, in 
Congress, have the opportunity to take 
action to help them know they don’t 
have to struggle alone. Our legislation 
will help connect these veterans and 
servicemembers to more resources and 
provide them with the tools they need 
to address the challenges related to 
their service. 
To my colleagues, we have a signifi-
cant role and responsibility to combat 
this struggle, and here today we can do 
our part to make certain that, in their 
struggles, our veterans are equipped 
with the care and services they need to 
be successful, to win. We must take 
real and urgent action to tackle the 
challenges together. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR TO S. 785 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senator from Rhode Is-
land, Mr. REED, be added as a cosponsor 
to S. 785. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I also 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 498, S. 785. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 785) to improve mental health 
care provided by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure?

proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following:

SEC. 508. REPORT ON EFFORTS BY DEPARTMENT 
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO IMPLE-
MENT SAFETY PLANNING IN EMER-
GENCY DEPARTMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs must 
be more effective in its approach to reducing the 
burden of veteran suicide connected to mental 
health diagnoses, to include expansion of treat-
ment delivered via telehealth methods and in 
rural areas. 
(2) An innovative project, known as Suicide 
Assessment and Follow-up Engagement: Veteran 
Emergency Treatment (in this subsection re-
ferred to as ‘‘SAFE VET’’), was designed to help 
suicidal veterans seen at emergency departments 
within the Veterans Health Administration and 
was successfully implemented in five interven-
tion sites beginning in 2010. 
(3) A 2018 study found that safety planning 
intervention under SAFE VET was associated 
with 45 percent fewer suicidal behaviors in the 
six-month period following emergency depart-
ment care and more than double the odds of a 
veteran engaging in outpatient behavioral 
health care. 
(4) SAFE VET is a promising alternative and 
acceptable delivery of care system that aug-
ments the treatment of suicidal veterans in 
emergency departments of the Veterans Health 
Administration and helps ensure that those vet-
erans have appropriate follow-up care. 
(5) Beginning in September 2018, the Veterans 
Health Administration implemented a suicide 
prevention program, known as the SPED pro-
gram, for veterans presenting to the emergency 
department who are assessed to be at risk for 
suicide and are safe to be discharged home. 
(6) The SPED program includes issuance and 
update of a safety plan and post-discharge fol-
low-up outreach for veterans to facilitate en-
gagement in outpatient mental health care. 
(b) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a report on 
the efforts of the Secretary to implement a sui-
cide prevention program for veterans presenting 
to an emergency department or urgent care cen-
ter of the Veterans Health Administration who 
are assessed to be at risk for suicide and are safe 
to be discharged home, including a safety plan 
and post-discharge outreach for veterans to fa-
cilitate engagement in outpatient mental health 
care. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by para-
graph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) An assessment of the implementation of 
the current operational policies and procedures 
of the SPED program at each medical center of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, including 
an assessment of the following: 
(i) Training provided to clinicians or other 
personnel administering protocols under the 
SPED program. 
(ii) Any disparities in implementation of such 
protocols between medical centers. 
(iii) Current criteria used to measure the qual-
ity of such protocols including— 
(I) methodology used to assess the quality of 
a safety plan and post-discharge outreach for 
veterans; or 
(II) in the absence of such methodology, a 
proposed timeline and guidelines for creating a 
methodology to ensure compliance with the evi-
dence-based model used under the Suicide As-
sessment and Follow-up Engagement: Veteran 
Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) program of 
the Department. 
(B) An assessment of the implementation of 
the policies and procedures described in sub-
paragraph (A), including the following: 
(i) An assessment of the quality and quantity 
of safety plans issued to veterans. 
(ii) An assessment of the quality and quantity 
of post-discharge outreach provided to veterans.

Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the com-
mittee-reported substitute be with-
drawn; 
that 
the 
Moran 
substitute 
amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to; and that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was with-
drawn. 
The amendment (No. 2594) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. MORAN. I know of no further de-
bate on the bill, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the bill having 
been read the third time, the question 
is, Shall the bill pass, as amended? 
The bill (S. 785), as amended, was 
passed. 
Mr. MORAN. Thank you for that. I 
now ask unanimous consent that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. I yield to the Senator 
from Montana for his conversation and 
discussion about this legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank 
the chairman of the VA Committee, 
Senator MORAN, for his leadership. 
What we have done here today is a 
very, very good thing. I think the big-
gest challenge facing the VA today is 
that we are losing 20 veterans a day to 
suicide. It has been that way for some 
time. 
People have been looking for solu-
tions—looking for solutions—and the 
fact is that there is no silver bullet. 
But what we have done today is give 
the VA more tools in their toolbox to 
be able to address this problem of men-
tal health and veteran suicide amongst 
our veterans. 
I thank Chairman MORAN
for his 
comments 
about 
CDR 
John 
Scott 
Hannon, after whom this bill is named. 
As Senator MORAN has pointed out,

this Navy SEAL served our Nation for 
23 years. And after combat, Scott re-
turned to Helena, MT, but, unfortu-
nately, the invisible wounds of war fol-
lowed him right back home. 
He was open about his journey to re-
covery, getting involved in the Mon-
tana chapter of the National Alliance 
on Mental Illness and using animal 
therapy and programs at Montana 
Wild. But, unfortunately—and I know 
his family is watching right now—on 
February 25, 2018, Scott succumbed to 
the wounds of war that caused his men-
tal illness. 
As Chairman MORAN has pointed out, 
this bill honors his legacy by sup-
porting the kinds of programs that 
helped improve Commander Hannon’s 
quality of life by expanding our under-
standing of mental health conditions 
and the treatments that may have 
made diagnosing the conditions easier. 
I am not going to go into everything 
the bill does because Senator MORAN 
did a fine job on that. All I can say is 
that we have a great VA Committee in 
this U.S. Senate. It is a committee 
that works to get things done in a bi-
partisan way. 
I have had the honor of serving with 
JOHNNY ISAKSON as chairman and now 
with Chairman MORAN, and we haven’t 
missed a step. We continue to work to-
gether to support our veterans across 
this country. 
There is no better way of supporting 
our veterans than to pass this bill, 
which is what we just did in the U.S. 
Senate about 2 minutes ago. 
The bottom line is this: This isn’t the 
final bill we are going to pass out of 
the U.S. Senate dealing with veterans. 
We have plenty more. In fact, I think 
we passed a dozen bills in the VA Com-
mittee today, dealing with a myriad of 
different issues that impact our vet-
erans in this country. The bottom line 
is that today we can be proud. We can 
be proud of Senators in the U.S. Senate 
for doing something that needed to be 
done that is going to help our veterans 
and move this country forward. 
I am going to close by going where I 
started, and that is to say thank you, 
Senator MORAN. Thank you for your 
leadership. Thank you for your friend-
ship. Thank you for your trust. It is 
great working with you, and I look for-
ward to doing many more good things 
before this Congress ends. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, let me 
extend the courtesies that were ex-
tended to me by the Senator from Mon-
tana, Mr. TESTER. 
It has been a privilege to work with 
him on this and many other issues— 
many of them related to our Nation’s 
service men and women and those who 
served and are now veterans. 
I appreciate that Senator TESTER and 
I have the ability to work together to 
resolve differences and find common 
ground for the benefit of those who 
have served. 
Before I conclude my comments this 
evening, I would use this as a mo-
ment—on behalf of the Presiding Offi-
cer, on behalf of Senator TESTER and 
me, and on behalf of all Members of the 
U.S. Senate—to express our gratitude 
to all who have served our country and 
express our respects and honor for 
those who are no longer with us, who, 
because of those battle wounds, have 
lost their lives to suicide. 
We express our condolences and sym-
pathies to their family members and to 
their friends, and, in each and every in-
stance, we recognize what sacrifice 
they have made for the benefit of each 
and every one of us here today and 
across the country. 
I would say to those family members 
that this legislation—we hope—and the 
example that their loved ones dem-
onstrated in their lives will be some-
thing that will inspire us to do the 
right thing and care for those who 
served. So I express my condolence and 
sympathies to the families, and I thank 
all who served, and I do so on behalf of 
all Members of the U.S. Senate. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t 
thank the many dedicated staff mem-
bers 
who 
helped 
this 
legislation 
through to this point: Emily Blair, who 
is with us on the Senate floor tonight, 
Tiffanii 
Woolfolk, 
Mark 
Crowley, 
Asher 
Allman, 
Scott 
Nulty, 
Pat 
McGuigan, David Shearman, and Caro-
line Canfield. 
In addition, thank you to Senator 
TESTER’s staff: Sophie Friedl, Dahlia 
Melendrez, and Tony McClain, the Kan-
san, as well as the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee staff members. 
Suicide is preventable, and with the 
passage of Commander John Scott 
Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act tonight—here, mo-
ments ago—we take a stand to protect 
the lives of the people who have given 
us so much in their protection of each 
and every American. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO PUTNAM ‘‘PUT’’ 
BLODGETT 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Putnam 
‘‘Put’’ Blodgett’s lifetime of service to 
the Vermont forest industry deserves 
special recognition. Put personified the 
essence, values, and traditions of what 
makes Vermont special. 
Put’s family moved to a Bradford, 
VT, dairy farm during the height of the 
Great Depression. He attended Dart-
mouth College and returned home in 
1953 to work on the family farm, which 
he eventually took over and continued 
to steward with his wife and children. 
Put left the dairy business for other 
endeavors but maintained his connec-
tion to the family land, working tire-
lessly to restore and manage its 700- 
acre wood lot. Always focused on long- 
term sustainable management, Put 
placed the acreage in conservation 
with the Upper Valley Land Trust, pre-
serving the forest for all generations. 
Put’s son now manages the forest, con-
tinuing that legacy. 
Put and his wife, Marilyn, ran the 
Challenge Wilderness Camp, teaching 
children about nature and guiding 
them on wilderness pursuits. Children 
would travel from cities to live in an 
Adirondack shelter, cook over an open 
fire, learn to canoe, and explore the 
forest. Put’s goal was to assist young 
people on their journey to adulthood, 
cultivating their connection with the 
natural world. Watching our own chil-
dren and grandchildren play in woods 
and fields of our farm in Middlesex, VT, 
Marcelle and I know how crucial it is 
for children to have the experience in 
nature that Put and Marilyn provided 
to so many. 
A true leader in Vermont’s conserva-
tion and forestry community, Put was 
the longstanding president of Vermont 
Woodlands Association and oversaw 
the Tree Farm Program. He was recog-
nized twice as Vermont’s Outstanding 
Tree Farmer of the Year. Our farm in 
Middlesex has been enrolled in the Tree 
Farm Program for about 30 years, and 
I am deeply appreciative of the value 
the program has brought to my land 
and to Vermont. 
Forest management discussions can 
be 
a 
tense 
tug-of-war 
between 
environmentalism and timber manage-
ment, but Put didn’t see it that way. 
He understood conservation as a shared 
priority—a public and private good 
alike—and he worked to unite diver-
gent stakeholders around this common 
interest. I looked to Put for advice 
when writing Vermont wilderness leg-
islation and Put was a founding mem-
ber of the Vermont Natural Resources 
Council’s Forest Roundtable, an open 
forum for Vermonters to exchange in-
formation and recommend conserva-
tion policy. On many occasions, Put 
helped opposing sides find that elusive 
common ground on forest management 
policy. 
Putnam Blodgett, as any true for-
ester, worked with a mission to be ac-
complished 
on 
a 
timeframe 
much 
longer than his own life span or a sin-
gle generation. Put passed away earlier 
this year, and yet I take comfort know-
ing that the Green Mountains of 
Vermont are better for his work here. 
To the great benefit of my grand-
children and many generations to 
come, Put’s legacy lives in the North-
ern Forest.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the

the community during the COVID-19 
pandemic, finding creative ways to 
bring their important programing and 
resources to the public. 
The center, located in Burlington, 
VT is dedicated to educating people of 
all ages and abilities about science, the 
natural environment, and the impor-
tance of protecting the Lake Cham-
plain watershed and others like it. Rec-
ognizing the importance of equitable 
access to achieving this mission, the 
center utilizes several programs that 
break down financial barriers to its fa-
cilities and ensures that these edu-
cational opportunities are available to 
all. Most years see more than 167,000 
visitors to this award-winning, LEED- 
certified facility on the Burlington 
shores of Lake Champlain. Visitors of 
all ages come to experience over 100 
interactive exhibits and 70 different 
species of fish, amphibians, and rep-
tiles that inhabit the ecosystem we 
call home. 
When COVID-19 began to spread 
throughout the northeast, the center, 
like so many businesses and facilities, 
was forced to close its doors to the pub-
lic. But though they were unable to 
welcome visitors into the physical lo-
cation, the center’s dedicated staff 
were undeterred. After closing their 
doors on March 14, the staff drew on 
their considerable skills to quickly 
adapt to the new remote environment, 
offering a range of online learning 
tools, including educational videos, in-
structions for at-home science experi-
ments, and live video feeds of animal 
exhibits in order to support local 
schools and families. They even contin-
ued remote programming for adults. in-
cluding legislative updates on water 
quality work through the Clean Water 
Network and an LGBTQIA panel dis-
cussion during Pride Week. Some staff 
took 
it 
upon 
themselves, 
wearing 
masks of course, to stealthily clean out 
the shelves of the gift shop and set up 
remote centers of commerce from their 
own homes. Animal care staff reported 
to work without interruption, and the 
turtles and fish and frogs that call 
ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Cham-
plain home, thrived, all while missing 
their human visitors. 
Having helped with our State’s great 
success in curtailing the spread of the 
virus, ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake 
Champlain reopened to members on 
June 29 and to all guests on July 4, 
with extensive health and sanitary 
guidelines in place. Just as they were 
reopening, the center even hosted a 
wedding on just a few minutes notice, 
after staff spotted a well-dressed cou-
ple looking for a spot on the Bur-
lington waterfront and invited them in 
for the ceremony. 
Lake Champlain is one of Vermont’s 
greatest natural treasures, and it has 
always been a priority of mine to pre-
serve its beauty and the ecosystem it 
supports, which in turn provides an ir-
replaceable foundation for our state’s 
economy. 
I 
am 
proud 
that 
all 
Vermonters can look to ECHO, Leahy 
Center for Lake Champlain for oppor-
tunities to instill a passion for sci-
entific discovery, preservation of nat-
ural resources, and stewardship of the 
Lake Champlain basin in the hearts 
and minds people young and old, even 
during a pandemic. I especially thank 
the staff at the center for their resil-
ience, adaptability, innovation, and un-
wavering commitment to continuing 
this important work.

RECOGNIZING KING ARTHUR 
FLOUR 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a moment to recognize a 
storied Vermont business, King Arthur 
Flour of Norwich, VT, for their accom-
plishments over the years and their 
commitment to serving the community 
during the COVID–19 pandemic Almost 
as old as the United States itself, this 
company was established in 1790, just 1 
year into George Washington’s Presi-
dency. It began in Boston, with Henry 
Wood 
importing 
high-quality 
flour 
from England, and has evolved into a 
nationally 
recognized 
resource 
for 
home bakers and a beloved Vermont 
company. In 1984, King Arthur Flour 
moved to Norwich, where the business 
grew rapidly. Today, the brand is 
ranked second in the Nation for overall 
flour sales. But the rise to fame doesn’t 
mean they abandoned the Arthurian 
principles that their name was inspired 
by. 
In 2004, the family business was offi-
cially sold to its employees. Such an 
act demonstrates the high value the 
company places on their community 
and their employees. They also con-
tinue to source entirely from American 
farms, to ensure high-quality produc-
tion and to support a sustainable agri-
cultural economy. As always, they 
guarantee quality and purity by prom-
ising their customers products free of 
bleach, bromate, or any artificial pre-
servatives. Through their commitment 
to their employees, the community, 
and to delivering high-quality, respon-
sibly sourced products, this company 
truly demonstrates the values and 
character of a Vermont business. 
King Arthur Flour further confirmed 
their commitment to serving and en-
gaging with the community during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. In March of this 
year, Americans were ordered to stay 
home to slow the spread of the virus. 
This led millions of Americans to begin 
baking at unprecedented rates. It was 
not uncommon to visit a grocery store 
this spring and see the empty shelves 
in the baking aisle. Like many other 
essential services, King Arthur was 
tasked with the need to fulfill a rising 
demand, while also keeping their em-
ployees safe. True to their character, 
King Arthur stepped up and did just 
that. Not only did they get their prod-
ucts to consumers, they continued to 
staff the Baker’s Hotline. For the last 
several decades, King Arthur has been 
about more than just selling products; 
they also want to educate and connect 
with people. Inundated with calls and 
social media engagement from home 
bakers, the company’s baking instruc-
tors, whose jobs were put on hold, 
began answering the Baker’s Hotline 
and managing the high quantity of so-
cial media interactions. 
When the country needed an at-home 
pastime, King Arthur Flour answered 
the call. I have visited their flagship 
store in the past and can attest to the 
quality of their products and services. I 
applaud them for their commitment to 
serving the national community during 
such uncertain times. King Arthur 
Flour truly exemplifies what it means 
to be a Vermont business and deserves 
enormous praise. Marcelle and I visit 
their plant often in Norwich, and I am 
so proud of all they have accomplished. 
King Arthur’s story during the pan-
demic was recently covered by Melissa 
Pasanen of the Vermont newspaper 
Seven Days, and I request that ex-
cerpts of this article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Seven Days, June 23, 2020] 
HOW THE PANDEMIC PROPELLED KING ARTHUR 
FLOUR INTO THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT 
(By Melissa Pasanen) 
Laurie Furch, a former bakery owner, has 
answered calls for the King Arthur Flour 
Baker’s Hotline for almost six years. Every 
shift, she handles dozens of questions from 
anxious bakers. She’s used to trouble-
shooting problems such as Why are my cook-
ies taking an hour to bake? Or, Can I sub-
stitute all-purpose flour for bread flour? 
But not even the holiday baking season 
and its deluge of calls prepared Furch and 
her teammates for the tsunami of home bak-
ing appeals that struck the weekend of 
March 14. That Sunday, the hotline handled 
a 50 percent spike in calls. 
As the coronavirus pandemic shut busi-
nesses and schools, and shelter-in-place or-
ders 
rolled 
out 
nationwide, 
homebound 
Americans were baking at an unprecedented 
rate—and they needed help. 
Millions of those bakers turned to Nor-
wich, Vt.-based King Arthur for advice—and 
for flour to fuel the new national pastime. 
The crescendo of phone calls was some-
thing the company could handle by rede-
ploying staff from its temporarily shuttered 
baking education center and retail oper-
ation. Addressing a nationwide run on flour 
that left grocery store shelves bare was a 
bigger challenge. 
‘‘Not only were people all learning how to 
bake,’’ Furch said, ‘‘then Americans decided 
they all needed flour at the same time.’’ 
King Arthur started as a regional New 
England brand and eventually developed na-
tional distribution for its products. In recent 
years, when customers from Florida or Cali-
fornia emailed to ask where to buy the flour, 
they could be referred to a nearby super-
market. 
The pandemic changed that—and shone a 
national spotlight on a beloved Vermont 
company and how it does business. 
It’s a welcome story that demonstrates 
nice guys can finish first. 
‘THE NEW HOT CATEGORY’ 
Normally, the flour business is pretty 
sleepy and doesn’t tend to grab headlines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4938 
August 5, 2020 
Plain wheat flour is a low-margin business 
that many consumers consider an undifferen-
tiated, basic commodity. 
‘‘If you want to make money, you don’t 
grow potatoes; you sell potato chips. You 
don’t sell flour; you sell breakfast cereal,’’ 
explained Jeffrey Hamelman, a certified 
master baker and retired original director of 
King Arthur’s Norwich bakery. 
But COVID–19 has affected almost every-
thing, including the flour world. 
March is the slowest time of the year for 
flour sales, although it leads up to Easter, 
which is the second busiest baking season 
after the winter holidays. 
So Bill Tine, King Arthur’s vice president 
of marketing, was surprised when, seemingly 
out of the blue, hotline call volume took its 
giant leap in mid-March. 
Tine said he recalls a late Sunday evening 
phone call to check in with colleagues about 
the unusual numbers. But, honestly, he said, 
that period of time is a blur. King Arthur, 
like every essential business, was busy fig-
uring out how to keep going and keep its em-
ployees safe. Then, unexpectedly, they were 
simultaneously faced with the sudden spike 
in demand for flour and baking advice. 
The week of March 16 was when grocery 
store orders started to pick up in an 
unseasonal way. Over the next four weeks, 
they leapt 600 percent over prior year sales, 
Tine said. There were well-publicized short-
ages of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but, 
he said, ‘‘It was a little bit of a shock that 
all of a sudden flour became, like, the third 
thing that started to go out of stock.’’ 
In response to empty grocery shelves, more 
consumers ordered direct from King Arthur 
than ever before, reaching six times normal 
sales. 
On April 19, the company tallied a new 
one-day website traffic high of close to 1 mil-
lion user sessions and 2.3 million page views. 
It blew past the previous record of 542,000 
sessions on the day before Thanksgiving 2019. 
And the orders looked different, Tine said. 
Direct sales were traditionally a mix of hard-
er-to-find specialty products. But now con-
sumers were ordering the core supermarket 
item they could not find: King Arthur’s sig-
nature 5-pound red-and-white paper bag of 
flour. 
While management was scrambling to get 
those bags back on grocery shelves nation-
wide, Furch, her hotline colleagues and the 
team that handles social media interactions 
were on a neverending hamster wheel. 
As call volume snowballed, it started to 
feel ‘‘like a continual Christmas season,’’ 
Furch recalled. All told, the calls, emails, so-
cial media interactions and web traffic 
across April and May saw a sixfold increase. 
Management did what it could to deepen 
the bench. The four-person digital engage-
ment team grew to 17, thanks to bakers and 
baking instructors whose regular jobs were 
on hold or much reduced. The hotline simi-
larly drew on six reinforcements from within 
the company, bringing its ranks to 21. 
At no time, according to Tine, did the com-
pany technically run out of flour. What it 
ran out of was enough bagged flour to feed 
the newly voracious appetite of Americans 
stuck at home. 
During the initial spike, Tine explained, 
King Arthur had enough flour to fill orders 
because the pipeline was full in preparation 
for Easter. In fact, throughout the whole 
flour ‘‘shortage,’’ he said, there was never in-
sufficient grain or even milling time to turn 
the grain into flour. The roadblocks were 
bagging capacity and speed of distribution. 
Starting in mid-March, King Arthur was in 
constant communication with its milling 
and distribution partners to add shifts and 
speed up delivery, Tine said. The company 
paid the extra cost of shipping flour from 
mills by truck instead of the usual railcars. 
And King Arthur signed a contract with a 
new distribution center to get grocery 
shelves restocked as quickly as possible; it 
also negotiated a partnership with an addi-
tional mill. 
But no matter what company leaders did, 
it felt like they were just plugging holes in 
a leaky bathtub. There simply were not 
enough additional bagging lines at any of 
their partners to fill the orders. 
‘‘As soon as a truckload of flour came in, it 
was sold that next day,’’ Tine said. Unlike 
toilet paper hoarding, he pointed out, people 
were using all the flour they bought and 
heading back for more: ‘‘People were actu-
ally baking.’’ 
To the surprise even of those in the flour 
business, it turned out that the quarantine 
was compelling people to bake, whether be-
cause they couldn’t get out to buy their 
daily loaf, they craved comfort food or they 
simply had a lot of time on their hands. Sud-
denly, social media feeds were filled with 
photos of pies, cakes, cookies and crusty 
loaves 
of 
sourdough 
tagged 
#quarantinebaking. 
SPEAKING UP 
King Arthur’s management team is well 
aware that there is always room to do better. 
Last November, senior leadership started on-
going diversity, equity and inclusion train-
ing. The program was to be rolled out to the 
entire company, until the pandemic put it on 
pause. 
‘‘We’ve got to be more proactive and more 
forward-looking on how to make sure that 
we’re actively getting all people to our 
table,’’ said Tine. 
While women are well represented in man-
agement at King Arthur, the company has 
very little racial diversity. ‘‘We live in a 
white state,’’ said co-CEO Karen Colberg, 
quickly adding, ‘‘That doesn’t absolve us 
from trying to talk about [race], to raise 
awareness, to make change and to be in it.’’ 
On June 1, King Arthur reacted to the pro-
tests sparked by the police killing of George 
Floyd with a social media post condemning 
‘‘the devastating racial injustices that con-
tinue to plague our country’’ and announcing 
a $200,000 fund to support racial justice 
changemaking organizations. 
This was a big step for a company whose 
potentially controversial statements had 
previously been limited to ‘‘Say no to raw 
dough’’ (due to the risk of E. coli in raw 
flour, not salmonella in raw eggs). 
Only a few hundred of the 39,0000-plus 
Facebook reactions to the racial justice post 
were negative. The social media team re-
sponded with a firm but empathic reiteration 
of the company’s position. 
Social advocacy, Colberg acknowledged, 
‘‘is new for King Arthur, and it’s the right 
thing to do for us.’’ The company had been 
planning to launch a Pride Month campaign 
instead on June 1 but decided to postpone it. 
Although some have accused big consumer 
brands of jumping on the cause bandwagon, 
King Arthur felt compelled to take a clear 
stand, she continued, ‘‘not because of some 
expected payoff—though I do believe people 
value it.’’ 
To those who say King Arthur should stick 
to baking, Colberg responds, ‘‘If we can’t 
speak to what is unfair . . . then we are not 
being responsible leaders to our organization 
and our society as a whole. There are so 
many injustices out there and we have to do 
better.’’ 
NEW NORMAL 
At about 9:30 a.m. on Friday, June 12, the 
bread bakers at King Arthur’s Norwich head-
quarters were wrapping up their shift that 
had started at 3:30 a.m. Masked and well 
spaced, two bakers lifted rounds of dough, 
folding and shaping them deftly. 
On the pastry side, the scent of cinnamon 
was so strong it seeped through the glass 
viewing windows and visitors’ mandatory 
masks. 
During Vermont’s ‘‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’’ 
period, the King Arthur bakery continued to 
bake at reduced volume for local customers. 
The retail store had just reopened with strict 
safety guidelines. Jeanne Seymour had driv-
en 70 miles from Guilford as soon as she 
heard the news. Her basket was soon full of 
baking tools and ingredients. 
‘‘I love that it’s Vermont, that it’s one of 
our companies,’’ she said, ‘‘and that it’s em-
ployee-owned.’’ 
In a classroom, a pair of education center 
employees were bagging loaves they’d baked 
for local community groups. The tally had 
just reached 10,000 loaves donated during the 
pandemic—15,000 including those baked at 
King Arthur’s Washington education center. 
Both locations are targeting late July or 
early August to restart classes—albeit with 
fewer students to ensure social distancing. 
The Norwich complex fondly known as 
Camelot by King Arthur employees is slowly 
moving back toward normal. 
The question for King Arthur is what ‘‘nor-
mal’’ will look like, at that facility and 
around the country. Baking usually slows in 
the summertime, Tine said, but as of mid- 
June, sales are up more than 50 percent com-
pared to a year ago. ‘‘I would say that 
they’re settling in, not settling down,’’ he 
said. ‘‘We’re settling in to a new normal.’’ 
The company feels confident it has devel-
oped systems to respond to any future spike 
in demand. The challenge, Colberg explained, 
is to figure out how to nurture the new inter-
est in baking hatched by the pandemic. 
‘‘How do we engage people that have shown 
some interest in baking and keep them bak-
ing?’’ she pondered. 
The bigger question, perhaps, is whether 
baking during the pandemic has taught 
Americans anything. 
‘‘I think people like the tactile aspect of it: 
the touching, the smelling, the feeling. We 
don’t always engage all of our senses in what 
we do,’’ Furch of the Baker’s Hotline said. 
‘‘Baking also forces you to pay attention to 
somebody 
else’s 
rhythm, 
which 
is 
the 
rhythm of the dough. I think people are 
learning patience.’’

tation. 
We owe Bob Halstead a debt of grati-
tude for the crucial work he has done 
to protect Nevadans and the State 
itself from becoming the Nation’s nu-
clear dumping ground. 
Bob also has defended the state be-
yond the Yucca Mountain fight. Two 
years ago, when it came to light that 
the Department of Energy had secretly 
shipped a half ton of weapons-grade 
plutonium to the Nevada National Se-
curity Site, Bob led the charge to right 
this 
incredible 
wrong 
committed 
against our State. 
I am deeply grateful for Bob’s tireless 
work to protect the health and safety 
of our community and our environ-
ment. He has been a source of great 
support for me and my staff, offering 
his unmatched knowledge of the com-
plex history of Yucca Mountain and 
our State’s fight against the ill-advised 
proposal, to which Nevadans have 
never consented. 
Even though Bob is taking a step 
back from his work and is beginning a 
well-deserved retirement, I know that 
he will remain a continued source of 
inspiration, knowledge, and passion as 
we continue in our fight to defend Ne-
vada. I thank Bob Halstead for a life-
time of service, and I wish him and his 
family all the best in this new chapter 
of life.∑

RECOGNIZING JWR CONSTRUCTION 
SERVICES, INC. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
family-owned 
small 
business 
that 
builds high-quality projects and is ac-
tively involved in several community 
organizations. This week, it is my 
pleasure to honor JWR Construction 
Services, Inc., of Deerfield Beach, FL, 
as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week. 
In 1985, Jerry DuBois and William 
Gallo founded JWR Construction Serv-
ices in Deerfield Beach, FL. Recog-
nizing a need for well-built commercial 
buildings, 
they 
combined 
Jerry’s 
project management expertise and Wil-
liam’s architectural skill to start their 
general contracting and construction 
management firm. From the beginning, 
Jerry and William established passion, 
respect, ownership, service, and safety 
as the core values of their company. 
They prioritized customer service and 
community involvement. 
Over the next 35 years, JWR Con-
struction 
finished 
construction 
projects throughout Florida. They have 
built affordable multi-family housing, 
healthcare facilities, and senior living 
centers, along with commercial and in-
dustrial facilities. Notably, JWR Con-
struction has completed projects for 
the University of Miami, Johnson & 
Wales University, Nova Southeastern 
University, and Florida Atlantic Uni-
versity. 
JWR Construction creates dignified 
work for their employees and contrac-
tors, ensuring social mobility and sup-
porting the skilled trades. They em-
phasize hiring veterans including Jer-
ry’s son, Dustin, who is a U.S. Navy 
veteran. Dustin served for 5 years as a 
machinist mate and special warfare 
combatant-craft crewman. He joined 
the family business in 2009 and cur-
rently serves as its chief operating offi-
cer. 
Through their leadership and service, 
JWR Construction has advocated for 
the contracting industry and south 
Florida community. In addition to 
earning several local industry awards, 
JWR Construction is active in the As-
sociated Builders and Contractors Flor-
ida East Coast chapter, with two mem-
bers serving on the local 2020 board of 
directors. 
JWR 
Construction 
has 
partnered with dozens of community 
organizations, including the Boys and 
Girls Club, the Deerfield Beach Little 
League team, and the Broward Navy 
Days. Jerry serves on the board of Re-
building Together Broward, which revi-
talizes homes for low-income individ-
uals, especially veterans. 
Like many Floridian small busi-
nesses, 
JWR 
Construction 
Services 
stepped up to support its community 
during 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
When the Deerfield Beach Housing Au-
thority hosted its seventh Annual Des-
tination Graduation for local low-in-
come high school seniors, JWR Con-
struction helped organize a drive- 
through graduation celebration. They 
provided a laptop for each graduating 
student, donating a total of $14,000 in 
graduation gifts. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program, Jerry and William 
applied immediately. The PPP provides 
forgivable loans to impacted small 
businesses and nonprofits who main-
tain their payroll during the COVID–19 
pandemic. In April 2019, JWR Construc-
tion received a PPP loan, which en-
abled them to keep 37 employees paid 
and allowed them to safely continue 
their essential work in south Florida. 
JWR Construction Services is an in-
credible example of how hard work and 
strong values can create a business 
that is both successful and beneficial 
to the community that it serves. I 
commend their important work. Con-
gratulations to Jerry, William, Dustin, 
and the entire team at JWR Construc-
tion Services. I look forward to watch-
ing your continued growth and invest-
ment in the south Florida commu-
nity.∑ 
25TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIRGINIA 
ORGANIZING 
∑ Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish 
to commemorate the 25th anniversary 
of Virginia Organizing, a nonpartisan 
grassroots group committed to chal-
lenging injustice by empowering people 
in local communities across the Com-
monwealth to work together, demo-
cratically 
and 
nonviolently, 
for 
change. 
For a quarter century, Virginia Orga-
nizing has led the debate on the most 
important issues of our time, including 
economic security for families, equal 
opportunity in education, a sustainable 
environment, access to healthcare, and 
the guarantee that every person is en-
titled to have their voice heard. 
Virginia Organizing and I share a 
common goal, one that I have spoken 
about many times, that all Virginians 
and all Americans should have a fair 
shot at success. We share the belief 
that all people should be treated fairly 
and with dignity in all aspects of life, 
regardless of race, class, gender, reli-
gion, sexual orientation, age, ability, 
or country of origin. 
Now more than ever, I am proud to 
serve alongside a group that embraces 
and celebrates diversity. This year, to 
celebrate their 25th anniversary, I 
would like to again recognize and 
thank the leaders, members, and staff 
of Virginia Organizing, who continue 
to work tirelessly to provide children, 
low-income residents, immigrants, vet-
erans, retirees, people with disabilities, 
and 
other 
underrepresented 
groups 
with the resources that they need to 
have a fair shot. I am so grateful for 
their work for the people of the Com-
monwealth and wish them well as they 
embark on their next quarter-century.∑

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
KING, and Mr. SULLIVAN): 
S. 4460. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to waive cer-
tain eligibility requirements for a vet-
eran to receive per diem payments for 
domiciliary care at a State home, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the State Veterans 
Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility 
Act. This bill would address a current 
gap in care for veterans in Maine living 
with early-stage dementia. Specifi-
cally, it would ensure that the VA can 
waive certain eligibility requirements 
to allow veterans with early-stage de-
mentia to be cared for in State vet-
erans’ homes when it is in the best in-
terest of the veteran. 
In Maine, we lead the way in caring 
for our veterans. For more than 40 
years, Maine Veterans’ Homes has been 
a vital part of our State’s commitment 
to our heroes. My father, Donald Col-
lins, a decorated World War II veteran, 
was cared for by the Veterans’ Home in 
Caribou at the end of his life, so I know 
firsthand the compassion and care that 
Maine Veterans’ Homes provide. In the 
land of the free, Maine Veterans’ 
Homes help ensure that there will al-
ways be a home for the brave when 
they need care. 
As chairman of the Senate Aging 
Committee and representing the oldest 
State by median age in the country, I 
have championed policies to help indi-
viduals living with dementia, such as 
Alzheimer’s disease, as well as Amer-
ica’s hidden heroes—our military and 
veteran caregivers. I cofounded the 
Senate Alzheimer’s Task Force in rec-
ognition of the devastating impact

that disease has on individuals and 
families. 
Our Nation owes America’s veterans 
our deepest gratitude. We must honor 
our commitment to veterans by con-
tinuing to support their needs, includ-
ing the needs of veterans who are liv-
ing with early-stage dementia. 
The State Veterans Homes Domi-
ciliary Care Flexibility Act would re-
quire VA to implement a waiver au-
thority, allowing the VA to grant 
domiciliary care per diem payments for 
veterans who meet at least half of the 
VA’s current eligibility requirements 
and if such a waiver would be in that 
veterans’ best interest. This will pro-
vide the flexibility to ensure this vul-
nerable group of veterans do not fall 
through the cracks and that VA can 
help address the growing needs for as-
sistance for these patients. 
Mr. President, this legislation has 
the support of Melissa Jackson, the 
president of the National Association 
of State Veterans Homes, as well as 
Kelley Kash, CEO of Maine Veterans’ 
Homes, and I urge all of my colleagues 
to join me in honoring and supporting 
some of our Nation’s most vulnerable 
veterans by supporting its passage.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
667—CALL-
ING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RE-
LEASE 
OF 
TREVOR 
REED, 
A 
UNITED 
STATES 
CITIZEN 
WHO 
WAS UNJUSTLY SENTENCED TO 9 
YEARS IN A RUSSIAN PRISON 
Mr. CORNYN submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 667 
Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed 
is a resident of Granbury, Texas, and a 
United States Marine Corps veteran; 
Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow 
to visit his girlfriend on May 16, 2019; 
Whereas Moscow’s Police Service detained 
Trevor Reed on August 16, 2019; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grab-
bing the arm of the police officer driving the 
vehicle and elbowing another officer while en 
route to the police station, causing the vehi-
cle to swerve and therefore endangering the 
lives of the police officers; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a med-
ical evaluation until 10 days following his ar-
rest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team pre-
sented video evidence to the courts that dis-
proves the police officers’ statements of sup-
posed endangerment and wrongdoing; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team was 
denied access to additional video evidence 
from the police vehicle and police station 
that had the potential to prove his inno-
cence; 
Whereas the police officers claimed emo-
tional and physical damages, but did not sus-
tain any visible injury, or claim any time 
missed from work; 
Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation and the Second 
Court of Cassation of General Jurisdiction 
concurred that Russian procedural law was 
violated in the way that Trevor Reed’s bail 
was revoked; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed complaints with the Rus-
sian Foreign Ministry regarding denial of 
communications with Trevor Reed; 
Whereas during the trial, the defense coun-
sel presented 59 minutes of traffic camera 
video that showed the police car— 
(1) did not change direction or leave its 
lane; 
(2) did not swerve; and 
(3) did not stop or slow down; 
Whereas on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky Dis-
trict Court Judge Arnout read a verdict that 
dismissed all defense evidence, witnesses, 
and government experts and included infor-
mation from the investigator’s case files 
that were not discussed or read into the 
court files; 
Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed 
to 9 years in a prison camp even though no 
person had previously been sentenced to 
more than 8 years in prison for a level II 
crime; 
Whereas the judge also ordered Trevor 
Reed to pay 100,000 rubles to each police offi-
cer for moral and physical injuries; 
Whereas Trevor Reed had already been de-
tained in Russia for 1 year at the time of the 
judge’s verdict; 
Whereas, the United States Ambassador to 
Russia, John Sullivan, upon Trevor’s sen-
tencing, stated that the prosecution’s case 
and the evidence presented against Mr. Reed 
were ‘‘so preposterous that they provoked 
laughter in the courtroom’’, the conviction 
and sentence were ‘‘ridiculous’’, and ‘‘justice 
was not even considered’’. 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul 
Whelan, and all prisoners unjustly impris-
oned in the Russian Federation; 
(2) condemns the practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment in the Russian Fed-
eration, which violates the commitments of 
the Russian Federation to international obli-
gations with respect to human rights and the 
rule of law; 
(3) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise the case of 
Trevor Reed and to press for his release; 
(4) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to immediately release Trevor 
Reed and all other prisoners arrested for po-
litical motivations; 
(5) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide unrestricted consular 
access to Trevor Reed while he remains in 
detention; 
(6) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation— 
(A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary 
medical treatment and personal protective 
equipment; 
(B) to notify the United States Ambas-
sador to Russia of any medical problems or 
complaints that arise during his detention; 
and 
(C) to provide the United States Embassy 
in Moscow with full access to all of Trevor 
Reed’s medical records; 
(7) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to respect Trevor Reed’s univer-
sally recognized human rights; and 
(8) expresses support to the family of 
Trevor Reed and commitment to bringing 
Trevor Reed home.

SEC. lllll. RESPONSIBILITY OF FOREIGN 
STATES FOR RECKLESS ACTIONS OR 
OMISSIONS CAUSING THE COVID–19

States in any case in which money damages 
are sought against a foreign state for death 
or physical or economic injury to person, 
property, or business occurring in the United 
States following any reckless action or omis-
sion (including a conscious disregard of the 
need to report information promptly or de-
liberately hiding relevant information) of a 
foreign state, or of any official, employee, or 
agent of that foreign state while acting with-
in the scope of his or her office, employment,

forcement of this section, including pre-judg-
ment injunctions related to transfer or dis-
posal of assets. 
‘‘(d) INTERVENTION.—The Attorney General 
may intervene in any action in which a for-
eign state is subject to the jurisdiction of a 
court of the United States under subsection 
(a) for the purpose of seeking a stay of the 
civil action, in whole or in part. 
‘‘(e) STAY.— 
‘‘(1) IN

other parties as to whom a stay of claims is 
sought. In exercising its discretion under 
this subsection, the court shall balance the

tion may be granted for not more than 180 
days.

GENERAL.—The Attorney General 
may petition the court for an extension of 
the stay for additional periods not to exceed

Secretary of State recertifies that the 
United States remains engaged in good faith 
discussions with the foreign state defendant 
concerning the resolution of the claims 
against the foreign state, or any other par-
ties as to whom a stay of claims is sought. In 
choosing whether to grant an extension, the 
court shall balance the interests of the 
United States with the interests of the plain-
tiffs in a timely review of their claims.’’. 
(b) APPLICABILITY.—The amendment made 
by subsection (a) shall apply to any action or 
omission described in section 1605C of title 
28, United States Code, as added by that sub-

its immunity from attachment prior to judg-
ment, notwithstanding any withdrawal of 
the waiver the foreign state may purport to 
effect except in accordance with the terms of 
the waiver;

cure satisfaction of a judgment that has been

which the foreign state is not immune under

eign state while acting within the scope of

the bill S. 178, to condemn gross human 
rights violations of ethnic Turkic Mus-
lims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end 
to arbitrary detention, torture, and 
harassment of these communities in-
side and outside China; which was or-
dered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lllll. POSTAL SERVICE EMERGENCY AS-
SISTANCE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) By law, the Postal Service operates as 
‘‘a basic and fundamental service provided to 
the people by the Government of the United 
States’’ and must serve rural, suburban, and 
urban areas throughout the United States. 
(2) The Postal Service is a lifeline for busi-
nesses and consumers across the United 
States, especially those in remote and rural 
areas of the country, delivering business cor-
respondence, educational, cultural and sci-
entific information, critical prescriptions 
and medications, household items, and com-
mercial goods with affordable, reliable serv-
ice not fewer than 6 days per week. 
(3) The Postal Service helps small busi-
nesses stay connected with their customers 
no matter where they are located or where 
their customers live. 
(4) Since 1970, the Postal Service has been 
charged with operating as a self-sustaining 
entity and its operations are funded from 
postage paid for mail and shipping and not 
primarily by taxpayer funds. 
(5) The Government Accountability Office 
reports that the Postal Service has lost ap-
proximately $78,000,000,000 from fiscal year 
2007 through 2019 due primarily to declining 
mail volumes and rising costs. 
(6) Package delivery volumes have more 
than doubled since 2010, but the Postal Serv-
ice faces competition in this area. 
(7) The Postal Service is not on a sustain-
able path and needs reform to be viable over 
the long term. 
(8) Reforms must be focused on the long 
term solvency of the Postal Service while 
ensuring the greatest benefit to the public 
and 630,000 employees of the Postal Service. 
(9) By law, the authority for operation and 
strategic direction of the Postal Service, an 
independent establishment of the executive 
branch, is delegated to the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Postal Service, including the 
Postmaster General. 
(10) On May 6, 2020, the Board of Governors 
of the Postal Service selected Louis DeJoy 
as the 75th Postmaster General of the United 
States. 
(11) The new Postmaster General should be 
given the opportunity to review the oper-
ations and finances of the Postal Service 
and, in coordination with the rest of the 
Board of Governors of the Postal Service, 
propose a plan to ensure its long term viabil-
ity. 
(12) At the same time, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has significantly contributed to the 
decline in market dominant mail volumes 
and revenues while increasing costs, putting 
additional stress on the financial situation 
of the Postal Service. 
(13) Now more than ever, affordable mail 
and package delivery provided by the Postal 
Service is a lifeline for people in the United 
States, especially for seniors and others liv-
ing in remote and rural areas. 
(14) The critical services the Postal Service 
provides will play a fundamental part of the 
economic recovery of the United States. 
(15) Congress should provide immediate 
emergency appropriations to cover financial 
losses to the Postal Service caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic in order to keep the 
Postal Service operating without interrup-
tions in service and to give the new Post-
master General and the Board of Governors 
of the Postal Service time to formulate and 
propose to Congress a plan to ensure the long 
term viability of the Postal Service. 
(16) In addition, although Congress recog-
nized the critical role the Postal Service 
plays by providing $10,000,000,000 in bor-
rowing authority in the CARES Act (Public 
Law 116–136; 134 Stat. 281) to address oper-
ating losses caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, clarification is required with respect 
to the terms and conditions imposed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury on any such bor-
rowing. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) 
COVID–19.—The 
term 
‘‘COVID–19’’ 
means the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID– 
19).

SEC. 507. REPORT ON EFFORTS BY DEPARTMENT 
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO IMPLE-
MENT SAFETY PLANNING IN EMER-
GENCY DEPARTMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs 
must be more effective in its approach to re-
ducing the burden of veteran suicide con-
nected to mental health diagnoses, to in-
clude expansion of treatment delivered via 
telehealth methods and in rural areas. 
(2) An innovative project, known as Sui-
cide Assessment and Follow-up Engagement: 
Veteran Emergency Treatment (in this sub-
section referred to as ‘‘SAFE VET’’), was de-
signed to help suicidal veterans seen at 
emergency departments within the Veterans 
Health Administration and was successfully 
implemented in five intervention sites begin-
ning in 2010. 
(3) A 2018 study found that safety planning 
intervention under SAFE VET was associ-
ated with 45 percent fewer suicidal behaviors 
in the six-month period following emergency 
department care and more than double the 
odds of a veteran engaging in outpatient be-
havioral health care. 
(4) SAFE VET is a promising alternative 
and acceptable delivery of care system that 
augments the treatment of suicidal veterans 
in emergency departments of the Veterans 
Health Administration and helps ensure that 
those veterans have appropriate follow-up 
care. 
(5) Beginning in September 2018, the Vet-
erans Health Administration implemented a 
suicide prevention program, known as the 
SPED program, for veterans presenting to 
the emergency department who are assessed 
to be at risk for suicide and are safe to be 
discharged home. 
(6) The SPED program includes issuance 
and update of a safety plan and post-dis-
charge follow-up outreach for veterans to fa-
cilitate engagement in outpatient mental 
health care. 
(b) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall sub-
mit to the appropriate committees of Con-
gress a report on the efforts of the Secretary 
to implement a suicide prevention program 
for veterans presenting to an emergency de-
partment or urgent care center of the Vet-
erans Health Administration who are as-
sessed to be at risk for suicide and are safe 
to be discharged home, including a safety 
plan and post-discharge outreach for vet-
erans to facilitate engagement in outpatient 
mental health care. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) An assessment of the implementation 
of the current operational policies and proce-
dures of the SPED program at each medical 
center of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, including an assessment of the fol-
lowing: 
(i) Training provided to clinicians or other 
personnel administering protocols under the 
SPED program.

contract is to be awarded, sufficient funds 
will be available to perform the contract in 
such fiscal year, and the future-years defense 
program submitted to Congress under sec-
tion 221 of title 10, United States Code, for 
that fiscal year will include the funding re-
quired to execute the program without can-
cellation. 
(3) The contract is a fixed-price type con-
tract. 
(4) The proposed contract provides for pro-
duction at not less than minimum economic 
rates given the existing tooling and facili-
ties. 
(5) The Secretary has determined that each 
of the conditions described in paragraphs (1) 
through (6) of subsection (c) will be met by 
such contract and has provided the basis for 
such determination to the congressional de-
fense committees. 
(6) The determination under paragraph (5) 
was made after the completion of a cost 
analysis performed by the Director of Cost

nishing of such information under section

son subject to review under this section; and

promotion by the promotion board that rec-
ommended the person for promotion, and an 
appropriate sampling of the records of those 
officers who were considered by and not rec-
ommended for promotion by that promotion 
board. 
‘‘(2) Records and information shall be pre-
sented to a special selection review board for 
purposes of paragraph (1) in a manner that 
does not indicate or disclose the person or 
persons for whom the special selection re-
view board was convened.

In 
considering 
whether 
the 
rec-
ommendation for promotion of a person

cial selection review board shall, to the 
greatest extent practicable, apply standards 
used by the promotion board that rec-
ommended the person for promotion. 
‘‘(4) The recommendation for promotion of 
a person may be sustained under this section 
only if the special selection review board de-
termines that the person— 
‘‘(A) ranks on an order of merit created by 
the special selection review board as better 
qualified for promotion than the sample offi-
cer highest on the order of merit list who 
was considered by and not recommended for 
promotion by the promotion board con-
cerned; and 
‘‘(B) is comparable in qualification for pro-
motion to those sample officers who were

motion board.

person may be sustained under this section 
only by a vote of a majority of the members 
of the special selection review board.

not sustain a recommendation for promotion 
of a person under this section, the person 
shall be considered to have failed of selection 
for promotion.

sified information. 
‘‘(C)(i) An opportunity to submit com-

promotion by the promotion board that rec-
ommended the person for promotion, and an 
appropriate sampling of the records of those 
officers who were considered by and not rec-
ommended for promotion by that promotion 
board. 
‘‘(2) Records and information shall be pre-
sented to a special selection review board for 
purposes of paragraph (1) in a manner that

cial selection review board shall, to the 
greatest extent practicable, apply standards 
used by the promotion board that rec-
ommended the person for promotion.

a person may be sustained under this section 
only if the special selection review board de-
termines that the person— 
‘‘(A) ranks on an order of merit created by 
the special selection review board as better 
qualified for promotion than the sample offi-
cer highest on the order of merit list who 
was considered by and not recommended for 
promotion by the promotion board con-
cerned; and 
‘‘(B) is comparable in qualification for pro-
motion to those sample officers who were 
recommended for promotion by that pro-
motion board. 
‘‘(5) A recommendation for promotion of a 
person may be sustained under this section 
only by a vote of a majority of the members 
of the special selection review board.

but died before receiving a first duty assign-
ment was not eligible for a death gratuity

States Code, or for casualty assistance under 
section 633 of the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (10 U.S.C.

SEC. 752. REPORT ON BILLING PRACTICES FOR 
HEALTH CARE FROM DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Through the TRICARE program, the 
Department of Defense provides health care 
benefits 
and 
services 
to 
approximately 
9,500,000 beneficiaries. 
(2) The Department of Defense is not struc-
tured as a typical health care provider, 
which can lead to complicated billing prac-
tices and strict deadlines for members of the 
Armed Forces, former members of the Armed 
Forces, and their dependents, as well as for 
providers. 
(3) Numerous findings issued by the Inspec-
tor General of the Department of Defense be-
tween 2014 and 2019 describe the third-party 
collection program of the Department as in-
adequately managed, resulting in substantial 
uncollected funds that could be used to im-
prove the quality of health care at military 
medical treatment facilities. 
(4) Numerous press reports have found that 
the Federal Government aggressively col-
lects unpaid debts from uninsured or low-in-
come civilian patients who happen to receive 
treatment at a military medical treatment 
facility, even though providing that treat-
ment often benefits military readiness by 
providing experience to military medical 
professionals. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that it is in the national interest of 
the United States to ensure members of the 
Armed Forces, former members of the Armed 
Forces, and their dependents receive high- 
quality health care, and that Federal agen-
cies prioritize fairness and accessibility 
when administering health care. 
(c) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to Congress a report assessing 
the billing practices of the Department of 
Defense 
for 
care 
received 
under 
the 
TRICARE program or at military medical 
treatment facilities. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) A description of the extent to which 
data is being collected and maintained on 
whether beneficiaries under the TRICARE 
program have other forms of health insur-
ance.

have received increased radiation amounts. 
(iii) Identify, for each covered individual, 
duty stations, dates of service, aircraft 
flown, and additional duties (including Land-
ing Safety Officer, Catapult and Arresting 
Gear Officer, Air Liaison Officer, Tactical

(iv) Determine locations where a covered 
individual served or additional duties of a 
covered individual that are associated with 
higher incidences of cancers. 
(v) Identify potential exposures due to 
service in the Armed Forces that are not re-
lated to aviation, such as exposure to burn 
pits or toxins in contaminated water, embed-
ded in the soil, or inside bases or housing. 
(vi) Determine the appropriate age to 
begin screening covered individuals for can-
cer based on race, gender, flying hours, pe-
riod of service as aviation support personnel, 
Armed Force, type of aircraft, and mission.

integration of programs, resources, and ex-
pertise to strengthen the shipbuilding indus-
trial base, as well as to provide recommenda-
tions to Congress, to better stabilize the 
shipbuilding industrial base workforce and 
determine appropriate solutions for work-
force fluctuations. 
(2) DUTIES.—The working group shall carry 
out the following activities related to the 
ongoing challenges with workforce stability: 
(A) Analyze existing Department of the 
Navy contracts with the shipbuilding indus-
try and other relevant information to better 
anticipate future employment trends and 
tailor workforce resources and opportunities 
for workers most vulnerable to upcoming 
workforce fluctuations. 
(B) Identify existing Department of Labor 
programs for unemployed, underemployed, 
and furloughed employees that could benefit 
the shipbuilding industrial base workforce 
during times of workload fluctuations and 
workforce instability, and explore potential 
partnerships to connect employees with ap-
propriate resources. 
(C) Explore possible cost sharing agree-
ments to enable the Department of the Navy 
to contribute funding to existing Depart-
ment of Labor workforce programs to sup-
port the shipbuilding workforce. 
(D) Examine possible programs that will 
specifically assist furloughed employees who 
may sporadically rely on unemployment 
benefits. 
(E) Explore opportunities for unemployed, 
underemployed, or furloughed employees to 
provide workforce training through tem-
porary partnerships with States, technical 
schools, community colleges, and other local 
workforce development opportunities. 
(F) Review existing training programs for 
the shipbuilding workforce to maximize rel-
evant and necessary training opportunities 
that would broaden employee skillset during 
times of unemployment, underemployment, 
or furlough, where applicable. 
(G) Assess the possibility of shipbuilding 
worker support programs to weather a period 
of unemployment, underemployment, or fur-
lough, including compensation options, al-
ternative employment, temporary stipends, 
or other worker support opportunities. 
(H) Study cross-State credentialing re-
quirements and identify any restrictions 
that inhibit the flexibility of the ship-
building workforce to seek employment op-
portunities across State lines, and make rec-
ommendations 
to 
streamline 
licensing, 
credentialing, certification, and qualifica-
tion requirements within the shipbuilding 
industry. 
(I) Review additional or new contracting 
authorities that could enable the Depart-
ment of the Navy to award short-term, flexi-
ble contracts that will prioritize work for 
unemployed, underemployed, or furloughed 
employees within the shipbuilding work-
force. 
(J) Identify specific workforce support pro-
grams to support suppliers of all sizes within 
the shipbuilding industrial base, and assess 
any additional support from prime contrac-
tors that would improve the stability of such 
suppliers. 
(K) Assess whether greater collaboration 
with the United States Coast Guard and its 
shipbuilding contractors and subcontractors 
would improve workforce stability by assess-
ing a totality of shipbuilding demands. 
(L) Consider potential pilot programs that 
will specifically address shipbuilding indus-
trial base workforce stability. 
(M) Explore any additional opportunities 
to invest in recruiting, retaining, and train-
ing a skilled shipbuilding workforce. 
(N) Consider and incorporate the findings 
and recommendations, as appropriate, of the 
report on shipbuilder training and the de-
fense industrial base required under section 
1037 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92).

SEC. 884. PILOT PROGRAM EXPLORING THE USE 
OF 
CONSUMPTION-BASED 
SOLU-
TIONS TO ADDRESS SOFTWARE-IN-
TENSIVE 
WARFIGHTING 
CAPA-
BILITY. 
(a) FINDING.—In its final report, the Sec-
tion 809 Panel recommended the adoption of 
consumption-based approaches at the De-
partment of Defense, stating, ‘‘More things 
will be sold as a service in the future. XaaS 
could really mean everything in the context 
of the Internet of things (IoT). Consumption- 
based solutions are appearing in many indus-
try sectors, from last mile transportation 
(e.g., bike shares and electric scooters) to ag-
riculture (e.g., tractor-as-a-service for farm-
ers in developing countries). Most smart 
phone users are familiar with software up-
dates that provide bug fixes or new features. 
A more extreme example of technology inno-
vation enabled by the IoT is the ability to 
deliver physical performance improvements 
to vehicles through over-the-air software up-
dates. . . In the not-so-distant future, cloud 
computing and the IoT will enable consump-
tion-based solution offerings and delivery 
models that are hard to imagine today.’’ 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress— 
(1) that the Department of Defense should 
take advantage of ‘‘as-a-service’’ or ‘‘aaS’’ 
approaches in commercial capability devel-
opment, particularly where the capability is 
software-defined, and cloud-enabled; 
(2) to support the Department of Defense’s 
commitment to new approaches to develop-
ment and acquisition of software; 
(3) that the Department should explore a 
variety of approaches, to include the use of 
consumption-based solutions for software-in-
tensive warfighting capability; and 
(4) that, in conducting activities under the 
pilot program established under this pro-
gram, the Department should use the Soft-
ware pathway under the new Adaptive Ac-
quisition Framework. 
(c) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to the avail-
ability of appropriations, the Secretary of 
Defense is authorized to establish a pilot 
program to explore the use of consumption- 
based solutions to address software-intensive 
warfighting capability. 
(d) SELECTION
OF
INITIATIVES.—The Sec-
retary of each military department and the 
commander of each combatant command 
with acquisition authority shall propose for 
selection by the Secretary of Defense for the 
pilot program at least one and not more than 
three initiatives that are well-suited to ex-
plore consumption-based solutions to address 
software-intensive 
warfighting 
capability. 
The initiatives may be new or existing pro-
grams of record and shall focus on software- 
defined or machine-enabled warfighting ap-
plications, and may include applications 
that— 
(1) rapidly analyze sensor data; 
(2) secure warfighter networks, including 
multi-level security; 
(3) swiftly transport information across 
various networks and network modalities; or 
(4) otherwise enable joint all-domain oper-
ational concepts, including in a contested 
environment. 
(e) CONTRACT
REQUIREMENTS.—Contracts 
for consumption-based solutions entered into 
pursuant to the pilot program shall provide 
for— 
(1) the solution to be measurable on a fre-
quent interval customary for the type of so-
lution; 
(2) the contractor to notify the govern-
ment when consumption reaches 75 percent 
and 90 percent of the contract funded 
amount; and 
(3) discretion for the contracting officer to 
add new features or capabilities without ad-
ditional competition for the contract, pro-
vided that the amount of the new features or 
capabilities does not exceed 25 percent of the 
total contract value. 
(f) DURATION OF INITIATIVES.—Each initia-
tive carried out under the pilot program 
shall be carried out during the three-year pe-
riod following selection of the initiative. 
(g) MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PILOT 
PROGRAM.—The Director of the Office of Cost 
Assessment and Program Evaluation shall 
establish continuous monitoring to evaluate 
the pilot program established under sub-
section (c), including collecting data on cost, 
schedule, and performance from the program 
office, the user community, and the contrac-
tors. 
(h) REPORTS.— 
(1) INITIAL REPORT.—Not later than Janu-
ary 31, 2021, the Secretary of Defense shall 
submit to the congressional defense commit-
tees a report on initiatives selected for the 
pilot program, roles and responsibilities for 
implementing the pilot program, and the 
monitoring and evaluation approach for the 
pilot. 
(2) PROGRESS REPORT.—Not later than April 
15, 2021, the Secretary of Defense shall sub-
mit to the congressional defense committees 
a report on the progress of the initiatives. 
(3) FINAL REPORT.—Not later than 3 years 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report 
on the cost, schedule, and performance out-
comes of the initiatives. The report shall 
also include lessons learned about the use of 
consumption-based solutions for software-in-
tensive capabilities and any recommenda-
tions for statutory or regulatory changes to 
facilitate their use. 
(i) 
CONSUMPTION-BASED
SOLUTION
DE-
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘consump-
tion-based solution’’ means any combination 
of software, hardware or equipment, and 
labor or services that provides a seamless ca-
pability that is metered and billed based on 
actual usage and predetermined pricing per 
resource unit, and includes the ability to 
rapidly scale capacity up or down.

NAVY. 
It is the sense of Congress that to achieve 
the national policy of the United States to 
have available, as soon as practicable, not 
fewer than 355 battle force ships— 
(1) the Navy must be adequately resourced 
to increase the size of the Navy in accord-
ance with the national policy, which in-
cludes the associated ships, aircraft, per-
sonnel, sustainment, and munitions; 
(2) across fiscal years 2021 through 2025, the 
Navy should start construction on not fewer 
than— 
(A) 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers; 
(B) 10 Virginia-class submarines; 
(C) 2 Columbia-class submarines; 
(D) 3 San Antonio-class amphibious ships; 
(E) 1 LHA-class amphibious ship; 
(F) 6 John Lewis-class fleet oilers; and 
(G) 5 guided missile frigates; 
(3) new guided missile frigate construction 
should increase to a rate of between two and 
four ships per year once design maturity and 
construction readiness permit; 
(4) the Columbia-class submarine program 
should be funded with additions to the Navy 
budget significantly above the historical av-
erage, given the critical single national mis-
sion that these vessels will perform and the 
high priority of the shipbuilding budget for 
implementing the National Defense Strat-
egy; 
(5) stable shipbuilding rates of construc-
tion should be maintained for each vessel 
class, utilizing multi-year or block buy con-
tract authorities when appropriate, until a 
deliberate transition plan is identified; and 
(6) prototyping of potential new shipboard 
subsystems should be accelerated to build 
knowledge systematically, and, to the max-
imum extent practicable, shipbuilding proto-
typing should occur at the subsystem-level 
in advance of ship design.

August 5, 2020 
(3) Afghan allies routinely risk their lives 
to assist United States military and diplo-
matic personnel; 
(4) honoring the commitments made to Af-
ghan allies with respect to the special immi-
grant visa program is essential to ensuring— 
(A) the continued service and safety of 
such allies; and 
(B) the willingness of other like-minded in-
dividuals to provide similar services in any 
future contingency; 
(5) the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 
(8 U.S.C. 1101 note) states that all Govern-
ment-controlled processing of applications 
for special immigrant visas under that Act 
‘‘should be completed not later than 9 
months after the date on which an eligible 
alien submits all required materials to com-
plete an application for such visa’’; 
(6) any backlog in processing special immi-
grant visa applications should be addressed 
as quickly as possible so as to honor the 
United States commitment to Afghan allies 
as soon as possible; 
(7) failure to process such applications in 
an expeditious manner puts lives at risk and 
jeopardizes a critical element of support to 
United States operations in Afghanistan; and 
(8) to prevent harm to the operations of 
the United States Government in Afghani-
stan, additional visas should be made avail-
able to principal aliens who are eligible for 
special immigrant status under that Act. 
SEC. 1215. SENSE OF SENATE AND REPORT ON 
UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN AF-
GHANISTAN. 
(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the United States and our coalition 
partners have made progress in the fight 
against al-Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan; 
however, both groups— 
(A) maintain an ability to operate in Af-
ghanistan; 
(B) seek to undermine stability in the re-
gion; and 
(C) threaten the security of Afghanistan, 
the United States, and the allies of the 
United States; 
(2) the South Asia strategy correctly em-
phasizes the importance of a conditions- 
based United States presence in Afghanistan; 
therefore, any decision to withdraw the 
Armed Forces of the United States from Af-
ghanistan should be done in an orderly man-
ner in response to conditions on the ground, 
and in coordination with the Government of 
Afghanistan and United States allies and 
partners in the Resolute Support mission, 
rather than arbitrary timelines; 
(3) a precipitous withdrawal of the Armed 
Forces of the United States and United 
States diplomatic and intelligence personnel 
from Afghanistan without effective, counter-
vailing efforts to secure gains in Afghanistan 
may allow violent extremist groups to regen-
erate, threatening the security of the Afghan 
people and creating a security vacuum that 
could destabilize the region and provide 
ample safe haven for extremist groups seek-
ing to conduct external attacks; 
(4) ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure a 
peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflict 
in Afghanistan are the best path forward for 
establishing long-term stability and elimi-
nating the threat posed by extremist groups 
in Afghanistan; 
(5) the United States supports inter-
national diplomatic efforts to facilitate 
peaceful, negotiated resolution to the ongo-
ing conflict in Afghanistan on terms that re-
spect the rights of innocent civilians and 
deny safe havens to terrorists; and 
(6) as part of such diplomatic efforts, and 
as a condition to be met prior to withdrawal, 
the United States should seek to secure the 
release of any United States citizens being 
held against their will in Afghanistan. 
(b) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than September 
1, 2020, the Secretary of Defense shall submit 
to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the House of Representative a re-
port that includes— 
(A) an assessment of— 
(i) the external threat posed by extremist 
groups operating in Afghanistan to the 
United States homeland and the homelands 
of United States allies; 
(ii) the impact of cessation of United 
States counterterrorism activities on the 
size, strength, and external aims of such 
groups; and 
(iii) the international financial support the 
Afghan 
National 
Defense 
and 
Security 
Forces requires in order to maintain current 
operational capabilities, including force co-
hesion and combat effectiveness; 
(B) a plan for the orderly transition of all 
security-related tasks currently undertaken 
by the Armed Forces of the United States in 
support of the Afghan National Defense and 
Security Forces to Afghanistan, including— 
(i) precision targeting of Afghanistan- 
based terrorists; 
(ii) combat-enabler support, such as artil-
lery and aviation assets; and 
(iii) noncombat-enabler support, such as 
intelligence, 
surveillance 
and 
reconnais-
sance, medical evacuation, and contractor 
logistic support; and 
(C) an update on the status of any United 
States citizens detained in Afghanistan, and 
an overview of Administration efforts to se-
cure their release.

ORGANIZATION 
EN-
HANCED OPPORTUNITIES PARTNER 
STATUS FOR UKRAINE. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the United States should support the 
designation of Ukraine as an enhanced op-
portunities partner as part of the Partner-
ship Interoperability Initiative of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization; 
(2) the participation of Ukraine in the en-
hanced opportunities partner program is in 
the shared security interests of Ukraine, the 
United States, and the North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization alliance; 
(3) the unique experience, capabilities, and 
technical expertise of Ukraine, especially 
with respect to hybrid warfare, cybersecu-
rity, and foreign disinformation, would en-
able Ukraine to make a positive contribu-
tion to the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion alliance through participation in the en-
hanced opportunities partner program; 
(4) while not a replacement for North At-
lantic Treaty Organization membership, par-
ticipation in the enhanced opportunities

matters;

programs and exercises;

paredness and response; and

forms in Ukraine, including defense institu-

ereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine;

tential as a strategic partner of the United 
States; and

cently amended by section 1247 of the Na-

SEC. 1237. SENSE OF SENATE ON KOSOVO AND 
THE ROLE OF THE KOSOVO FORCE 
OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY 
ORGANIZATION. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) normalization of relations between 
Kosovo and Serbia is in the interest of both 
countries and would enhance security and 
stability in the Western Balkans; 
(2) the United States should continue to 
support the diplomatic efforts of Kosovo and 
Serbia to reach a historic agreement to nor-
malize relations between the two countries; 
(3) mutual recognition should be a central 
element of normalization of relations be-
tween Kosovo and Serbia; 
(4) both Kosovo and Serbia should refrain 
from actions that would make an agreement 
more difficult to achieve; 
(5) the Kosovo Force of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization continues to play an in-
dispensable role in maintaining security and 
stability, which are the essential predicates 
for the success of the diplomatic efforts of 
Kosovo and Serbia to achieve normalization 
of relations; 
(6) the participation of the United States 
Armed Forces in the Kosovo Force is 
foundational to the credibility and success of 
mission of the Kosovo Force; 
(7) with the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation allies and other European partners 
contributing over 80 percent of the troops for 
the mission, the Kosovo Force represents a 
positive example of burden sharing; 
(8) together with the allies and partners of 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
United 
States 
should— 
(A) maintain its commitment to the 
Kosovo Force; and 
(B) take all appropriate steps to ensure 
that the Kosovo Force has the necessary per-
sonnel, capabilities, and resources to per-
form its critical mission; and 
(9) the United States should continue to 
support the gradual transition of the Kosovo 
Security Force to a multi-ethnic army for 
the Republic of Kosovo that is interoperable 
with North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
members through an inclusive and trans-
parent process that— 
(A) respects the rights and concerns of all 
citizens of Kosovo;

bility; and

lantic Treaty Organization. 
SEC. 1238. SENSE OF SENATE ON STRATEGIC 
COMPETITION WITH THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERATION AND RELATED ACTIVI-
TIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DE-
FENSE. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the 2018 National Defense Strategy af-
firms the re-emergence of long-term stra-
tegic competition with the Russian Federa-
tion as a principal priority for the Depart-
ment of Defense that requires sustained in-
vestment due to the magnitude of the threat 
posed to United States security, prosperity, 
and alliances and partnerships; 
(2) given the continued military mod-
ernization of the Russian Federation, includ-
ing the development of long-range strike 
systems and other advanced capabilities, the 
United States should prioritize efforts within 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to 
implement timely measures to ensure that 
the deterrence and defense posture of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains 
credible and effective; 
(3) the United States should reaffirm sup-
port for the open-door policy of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization; 
(4) to enhance deterrence against aggres-
sion by the Russian Federation, the Depart-
ment of Defense should— 
(A) continue— 
(i) to prioritize funding for the European 
Deterrence Initiative to address capability 
gaps, capacity shortfalls, and infrastructure 
requirements of the Joint Force in Europe; 
(ii) to increase pre-positioned stocks of 
equipment in Europe; and 
(iii) rotational deployments of United 
States forces to Romania and Bulgaria while 
pursuing training opportunities at military 
locations such as Camp Mihail Kogalniceanu 
in Romania and Novo Selo Training Area in 
Bulgaria; 
(B) increase— 
(i) focus and resources to address the 
changing military balance in the Black Sea 
region; 
(ii) the frequency, scale, and scope of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and other mul-
tilateral exercises in the Black Sea region, 
including with the participation of Ukraine 
and Georgia; and 
(iii) presence and activities in the Arctic, 
including special operations training and 
naval operations and training; 
(C) maintain robust naval presence at 
Souda Bay, Greece, and pursue opportunities 
for increased United States presence at other 
locations in Greece; 
(D) enhance military-to-military engage-
ment among Western Balkan countries to 
promote interoperability with the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization and regional se-
curity cooperation; and 
(E) expand information sharing, improve 
planning coordination, and increase the fre-
quency, scale, and scope of exercises with 
Sweden and Finland to deepen interoper-
ability; and 
(5) to counter Russian Federation activi-
ties short of armed conflict, the Department 
of Defense should— 
(A) integrate with United States inter-
agency efforts to employ all elements of na-
tional power to counter Russian Federation 
hybrid warfare; and 
(B) bolster the capabilities of allies and 
partners to counteract Russian Federation 
coercion, including through expanded cyber 
cooperation and enhanced resilience against 
disinformation and malign influence.

FOR COORDINATED ACTION TO EN-
SURE THE SECURITY OF BALTIC AL-
LIES. 
It is the sense of Congress that—

critical to achieving United States national 
security interests and defense objectives 
against the acute and formidable threat 
posed by Russia; 
(2) the United States and the Baltic states 
are leaders in the mission of defending inde-
pendence and democracy from aggression 
and in promoting stability and security 
within the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO), with non-NATO partners, and 
with other international organizations such 
as the European Union; 
(3) the Baltic states are model NATO allies 
in terms of burden sharing and capital in-
vestment in materiel critical to United 
States and allied security, investment of 
over 2 percent of their gross domestic prod-
uct on defense expenditure, allocating over 
20 percent of their defense budgets on capital 
modernization, matching security assistance 
from the United States, frequently deploying 
their forces around the world in support of 
allied and United States objectives, and 
sharing diplomatic, technical, military, and 
analytical expertise on defense and security 
matters; 
(4) the United States should continue to 
strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense 
by, with, and through allied nations, particu-
larly those that possess expertise and dex-
terity but do not enjoy the benefits of na-
tional economies of scale; 
(5) the United States should pursue a dedi-
cated initiative focused on defense and secu-
rity assistance, coordination, and planning 
designed to ensure the continued security of 
the Baltic states and on deterring current 
and future challenges to the national sov-
ereignty of United States allies and partners 
in the Baltic region; and 
(6) such an initiative should include an in-
novative and comprehensive conflict deter-
rence strategy for the Baltic region encom-
passing the unique geography of the Baltic 
states, modern and diffuse threats to their 
land, sea, and air spaces, and necessary im-
provements to their defense posture, includ-
ing command-and-control infrastructure, in-
telligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance

Assurances’’ provided by the United States 
to Taiwan in July 1982 are the foundation for 
United States-Taiwan relations; 
(2) that nothing in the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) 
constrains deepening, to the extent possible, 
the extensive, close, and friendly relations of 
the United States and Taiwan, including de-
fense relations; 
(3) that the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) shall be im-
plemented and executed in a manner con-
sistent with evolving political, security, and 
economic dynamics and circumstances; 
(4) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Rela-
tions Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et 
seq.), the United States expects the ‘‘future 
of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful 
means,’’ and that ‘‘any effort to determine 
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
means’’ is ‘‘a threat to the peace and secu-
rity of the Western Pacific area and of grave 
concern to the United States’’; 
(5) that the increasingly coercive and ag-
gressive behavior of the People’s Republic of 
China towards Taiwan, including growing 
military maneuvers targeting Taiwan, is 
contrary to the expectation of the peaceful 
resolution of the future of Taiwan; 
(6) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Rela-
tions Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et

states: ‘‘[T]he Asia Reassurance Initiative 
Act, a major bipartisan legislation, was 
signed into law by President Trump on De-
cember 31, 2018. This legislation enshrines a 
generational 
whole-of-government 
policy 
framework that demonstrates U.S. commit-
ment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region 
and includes initiatives that promote sov-
ereignty, rule of law, democracy, economic 
engagement, and regional security.’’.

ther states: ‘‘The United States has a vital 
interest in upholding the rules-based inter-
national order, which includes a strong, 
prosperous, and democratic Taiwan. . .The 
Department [of Defense] is committed to 
providing Taiwan with defense articles and 
services in such quantity as may be nec-
essary to enable Taiwan to maintain a suffi-
cient self-defense capability.’’.

enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act (22 
U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide Taiwan with 
defense articles; and 
(B) states: ‘‘The President should conduct 
regular transfers of defense articles to Tai-
wan that are tailored to meet the existing 
and likely future threats from the People’s 
Republic of China, including supporting the 
efforts of Taiwan to develop and integrate 
asymmetric capabilities, as appropriate, in-
cluding mobile, survivable, and cost-effective 
capabilities, into its military forces.’’.

recommitted the United States to support 
the close, economic, political, and security 
relationship between the United States and 
Taiwan; and 
(2) the United States should fully imple-
ment the provisions of that Act with regard 
to regular defensive arms sales to Taiwan. 
(c) BRIEFING.—Not later than 30 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of De-
fense, or their designees, shall brief the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the

SEC. 1655. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NUCLEAR 
COOPERATION 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED 
KINGDOM. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) continues to play an essential role in 
the national security of the United States 
and the independent nuclear deterrents of 
other NATO members, such as the United 
Kingdom, have helped underwrite peace and 
security; 
(2) the nuclear programs of the United 
States and the United Kingdom have enjoyed 
significant collaborative benefits as a result 
of the cooperative relationship formalized in 
the Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses 
of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Pur-
poses, signed at Washington July 3, 1958, and 
entered into force August 4, 1958 (9 UST 1028), 
between the United States and the United 
Kingdom (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Mu-
tual Defense Agreement’’); 
(3) the unique partnership between the 
United States and the United Kingdom has 
enhanced sovereign military and scientific 
capabilities, strengthened bilateral ties, and 
shared costs, particularly on such programs 
as the Trident II D–5 weapons system and the 
common missile compartment for the future 
Dreadnought and Columbia classes of sub-
marines; 
(4) additionally, the extension of the nu-
clear deterrence commitments of the United 
Kingdom to members of the NATO alliance 
strengthens collective security while reduc-
ing the burden placed on United States nu-
clear forces to deter potential adversaries 
and assure allies of the United States and 
the United Kingdom; 
(5) as the international security environ-
ment deteriorates and potential adversaries 
expand and enhance their nuclear forces, the 
extended deterrence commitments of the 
United Kingdom play an increasingly impor-
tant role in supporting the security interests 
of the United States and allies of the United 
States and the United Kingdom; 
(6) it is in the national security interest of 
the United States to support the United 
Kingdom with respect to the decision of the

Government of the United Kingdom to main-
tain its nuclear deterrent until global secu-
rity conditions warrant its elimination; 
(7) as the United States must modernize its 
aging nuclear forces to ensure its ability to 
continue to field a nuclear deterrent that is 
safe, secure, and effective, the United King-
dom faces a similar challenge; 
(8) bilateral cooperation on the parallel de-
velopment of the W93/Mk7 warhead of the 
United States and the replacement warhead 
of the United Kingdom, as well as associated 
components, will allow the United States 
and the United Kingdom to responsibly ad-
dress challenges within their legacy nuclear 
forces in a cost-effective manner that— 
(A) preserves independent, sovereign con-
trol; 
(B) is consistent with each country’s obli-
gations under the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Wash-
ington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 
UST 483) (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Nu-
clear Non-Proliferation Treaty’’); and 
(C) supports nonproliferation objectives; 
and 
(9) continued cooperation between the nu-
clear programs of United States and the 
United Kingdom, including through the W93/ 
Mk7 program, is essential to ensuring that 
the NATO alliance continues to be supported 
by credible nuclear forces capable of pre-
serving peace, preventing coercion, and de-
terring aggression.

SEC. 1703. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law clarify certain obligations and promises 
that the Government of China has made with 
respect to the future of Hong Kong. 
(2) The obligations of the Government of 
China under the Joint Declaration were codi-
fied in a legally-binding treaty, signed by the 
Government of the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and registered 
with the United Nations. 
(3) The obligations of the Government of 
China under the Basic Law originate from 
the Joint Declaration, were passed into the 
domestic law of China by the National Peo-
ple’s Congress, and are widely considered by 
citizens of Hong Kong as part of the de facto 
legal constitution of Hong Kong. 
(4) Foremost among the obligations of the 
Government of China to Hong Kong is the 
promise that, pursuant to Paragraph 3b of 
the Joint Declaration, ‘‘the Hong Kong Spe-
cial Administrative Region will enjoy a high 
degree of autonomy, except in foreign and 
defence affairs which are the responsibilities 
of the Central People’s Government’’. 
(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 
3b of the Joint Declaration is referenced, re-
inforced, and extrapolated on in several por-
tions of the Basic Law, including Articles 2, 
12, 13, 14, and 22. 
(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes 
that ‘‘No department of the Central People’s 
Government and no province, autonomous 
region, or municipality directly under the 
Central Government may interfere in the af-
fairs which the Hong Kong Special Adminis-
trative Region administers on its own in ac-
cordance with this Law.’’. 
(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law make clear that additional obligations 
shall be undertaken by China to ensure the 
‘‘high degree of autonomy’’ of Hong Kong. 
(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 
19, and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong 
‘‘will be vested with executive, legislative 
and independent judicial power, including 
that of final adjudication’’. 
(9) On multiple occasions, the Government 
of China has undertaken actions that have 
contravened the letter or intent of the obli-
gation described in paragraph (8) of this sec-
tion, including the following: 
(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress overruled a deci-
sion by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal 
on the right of abode. 
(B) On multiple occasions, the Government 
of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Govern-
ment of China, is suspected to have not al-
lowed persons entry into Hong Kong alleg-
edly because of their support for democracy 
and human rights in Hong Kong and China. 
(C) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
Kong has, despite restrictions on inter-
ference in the affairs of Hong Kong as de-
tailed in Article 22 of the Basic Law— 
(i) openly expressed support for candidates 
in Hong Kong for Chief Executive and Legis-
lative Council; 
(ii) expressed views on various policies for 
the Government of Hong Kong and other in-
ternal matters relating to Hong Kong; and 
(iii) on April 17, 2020, asserted that both 
the Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong and 
the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of 
the State Council ‘‘have the right to exercise 
supervision . . . on affairs regarding Hong 
Kong and the mainland, in order to ensure 
correct implementation of the Basic Law’’. 
(D) The National People’s Congress has 
passed laws requiring Hong Kong to pass 
laws banning disrespectful treatment of the 
national flag and national anthem of China. 
(E) The State Council of China released a 
white paper on June 10, 2014, that stressed 
the ‘‘comprehensive jurisdiction’’ of the Gov-
ernment of China over Hong Kong and indi-
cated that Hong Kong must be governed by 
‘‘patriots’’. 
(F) The Government of China has directed 
operatives to kidnap and bring to the main-
land, or is otherwise responsible for the kid-
napping of, residents of Hong Kong, includ-
ing businessman Xiao Jianhua and book-
seller Gui Minhai. 
(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting 
with the support of the Government of 
China, introduced an extradition bill that 
would have permitted the Government of 
China to request and enforce extradition re-
quests for any individual present in Hong 
Kong, regardless of the legality of the re-
quest or the degree to which it compromised 
the judicial independence of Hong Kong. 
(H) The spokesman for the Standing Com-
mittee of the National People’s Congress 
said, ‘‘Whether Hong Kong’s laws are con-
sistent with the Basic Law can only be 
judged and decided by the National People’s 
Congress Standing Committee. No other au-
thority has the right to make judgments and 
decisions.’’. 
(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic 
Law, that the ‘‘current social and economic 
systems in Hong Kong will remain un-
changed, as so will the life-style.’’. 
(11) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (10) of this 
section, including the following:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5105 
August 5, 2020 
(A) In 2002, the Government of China pres-
sured the Government of Hong Kong to in-
troduce ‘‘patriotic’’ curriculum in primary 
and secondary schools. 
(B) The governments of China and Hong 
Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion 
of Hong Kong independence and self-deter-
mination in primary and secondary schools, 
which infringes on freedom of speech. 
(C) The Government of Hong Kong man-
dated that Mandarin, and not the native lan-
guage of Cantonese, be the language of in-
struction in Hong Kong schools. 
(D) The governments of China and Hong 
Kong agreed to a daily quota of mainland 
immigrants to Hong Kong, which is widely 
believed by citizens of Hong Kong to be part 
of an effort to ‘‘mainlandize’’ Hong Kong. 
(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 
29, 30, 31, 32 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, 
that the ‘‘rights and freedoms, including 
those of person, of speech, of the press, of as-
sembly, of association, of travel, of move-
ment, of correspondence, of strike, of choice 
of occupation, of academic research and of 
religious belief will be ensured by law’’ in 
Hong Kong. 
(13) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (12) of this 
section, including the following: 
(A) On February 26, 2003, the Government 
of Hong Kong introduced a national security 
bill that would have placed restrictions on 
freedom of speech and other protected rights. 
(B) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
Kong has pressured businesses in Hong Kong 
not to advertise in newspapers and maga-
zines critical of the governments of China 
and Hong Kong. 
(C) The Hong Kong Police Force selec-
tively blocked demonstrations and protests 
expressing opposition to the governments of 
China and Hong Kong or the policies of those 
governments. 
(D) The Government of Hong Kong refused 
to renew work visa for a foreign journalist, 
allegedly for hosting a speaker from the 
banned Hong Kong National Party. 
(E) The Justice Department of Hong Kong 
selectively prosecuted cases against leaders 
of the Umbrella Movement, while failing to 
prosecute police officers accused of using ex-
cessive force during the protests in 2014. 
(F) On April 18, 2020, the Hong Kong Police 
Force arrested 14 high-profile democracy ac-
tivists and campaigners for their role in or-
ganizing a protest march that took place on 
August 18, 2019, in which almost 2,000,000 peo-
ple rallied against a proposed extradition 
bill. 
(14) Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law as-
sert that the selection of Chief Executive 
and all members of the Legislative Council 
of Hong Kong should be by ‘‘universal suf-
frage.’’. 
(15) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (14) of this 
section, including the following: 
(A) In 2004, the National People’s Congress 
created new, antidemocratic procedures re-
stricting the adoption of universal suffrage 
for the election of the Chief Executive of 
Hong Kong. 
(B) The decision by the National People’s 
Congress on December 29, 2007, which ruled 
out universal suffrage in 2012 elections and 
set restrictions on when and if universal suf-
frage will be implemented. 
(C) The decision by the National People’s 
Congress on August 31, 2014, which placed 
limits on the nomination process for the 
Chief Executive of Hong Kong as a condition 
for adoption of universal suffrage. 
(D) On November 7, 2016, the National Peo-
ple’s Congress interpreted Article 104 of the 
Basic Law in such a way to disqualify 6 
elected members of the Legislative Council. 
(E) In 2018, the Government of Hong Kong 
banned the Hong Kong National Party and 
blocked the candidacy of pro-democracy can-
didates. 
(16) The ways in which the Government of 
China, at times with the support of a subser-
vient Government of Hong Kong, has acted 
in contravention of its obligations under the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as set 
forth in this section, are deeply concerning 
to the people of Hong Kong, the United 
States, and members of the international 
community who support the autonomy of 
Hong Kong. 
SEC. 1704. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
HONG KONG. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States continues to uphold 
the principles and policy established in the 
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
(22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) and the Hong Kong 
Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 
(Public Law 116–76; 22 U.S.C. 5701 note), 
which remain consistent with China’s obliga-
tions under the Joint Declaration and cer-
tain promulgated objectives under the Basic 
Law, including that— 
(A) as set forth in section 101(1) of the 
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
(22 U.S.C. 5711(1)), ‘‘The United States should 
play an active role, before, on, and after July 
1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong’s con-
fidence and prosperity, Hong Kong’s role as 
an international financial center, and the 
mutually beneficial ties between the people 
of the United States and the people of Hong 
Kong.’’; and 
(B) as set forth in section 2(5) of the United 
States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 
U.S.C. 5701(5)), ‘‘Support for democratization 
is a fundamental principle of United States 
foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies 
to United States policy toward Hong Kong. 
This will remain equally true after June 30, 
1997.’’; 
(2) although the United States recognizes 
that, under the Joint Declaration, the Gov-
ernment of China ‘‘resumed the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect on 1 
July 1997’’, the United States supports the 
autonomy of Hong Kong in furtherance of 
the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 
1992 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act of 2019 and advances the de-
sire of the people of Hong Kong to continue 
the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ regime, in 
addition to other obligations promulgated by 
China under the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law; 
(3) in order to support the benefits and pro-
tections that Hong Kong has been afforded 
by the Government of China under the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, the United 
States should establish a clear and unambig-
uous set of penalties with respect to foreign 
persons determined by the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Treasury, to be involved in the con-
travention of the obligations of China under 
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and 
the financial institutions transacting with 
those foreign persons; 
(4) the Secretary of State should provide 
an unclassified assessment of the reason for 
imposition of certain economic penalties on 
entities, so as to permit a clear path for the 
removal of economic penalties if the sanc-
tioned behavior is reversed and verified by 
the Secretary of State; 
(5) relevant Federal agencies should estab-
lish a multilateral sanctions regime with re-
spect to foreign persons involved in the con-
travention of the obligations of China under 
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law; 
and 
(6) in addition to the penalties on foreign 
persons, 
and 
financial 
institutions 
transacting with those foreign persons, for 
the contravention of the obligations of China 
under the Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law, the United States should take steps, in 
a time of crisis, to assist permanent resi-
dents of Hong Kong who are persecuted or 
fear persecution as a result of the contraven-
tion by China of its obligations under the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law to be-
come eligible to obtain lawful entry into the 
United States. 
SEC. 1705. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN PER-
SONS INVOLVED IN THE EROSION OF 
THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHINA UNDER 
THE JOINT DECLARATION OR THE 
BASIC LAW AND FOREIGN FINAN-
CIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CONDUCT 
SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS WITH 
THOSE PERSONS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
if the Secretary of State, in consultation

contributing to, has materially contributed 
to, or attempts to materially contribute to 
the failure of the Government of China to 
meet its obligations under the Joint Declara-
tion or the Basic Law, the Secretary of State 
shall submit to the appropriate congres-
sional committees and leadership a report 
that includes— 
(1) an identification of the foreign person; 
and 
(2) a clear explanation for why the foreign 
person was identified and a description of the 
activity that resulted in the identification. 
(b) IDENTIFYING FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTI-
TUTIONS.—Not earlier than 30 days and not 
later than 60 days after the Secretary of 
State submits to the appropriate congres-
sional committees and leadership the report

Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State, shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees and leadership a 
report that identifies any foreign financial 
institution that knowingly conducts a sig-
nificant transaction with a foreign person 
identified in the report under subsection (a). 
(c) EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION.— 
(1) INTELLIGENCE.—The Secretary of State 
shall not disclose the identity of a person in

telligence operation, activity, source, or 
method of the United States. 
(2) LAW
ENFORCEMENT.—The Secretary of 
State shall not disclose the identity of a per-
son in a report submitted under subsection 
(a) or (b), or an update under subsection (e), 
if the Attorney General, in coordination, as 
appropriate, with the Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the head of any 
other appropriate Federal law enforcement 
agency, and the Secretary of the Treasury, 
determines that such disclosure could rea-
sonably be expected— 
(A) to compromise the identity of a con-
fidential source, including a State, local, or 
foreign agency or authority or any private 
institution that furnished information on a 
confidential basis; 
(B) to jeopardize the integrity or success of 
an ongoing criminal investigation or pros-
ecution; 
(C) to endanger the life or physical safety 
of any person; or 
(D) to cause substantial harm to physical 
property. 
(3) NOTIFICATION REQUIRED.—If the Director 
of National Intelligence makes a determina-
tion under paragraph (1) or the Attorney

Senate that, in recognition of the close rela-
tionships between the nuclear weapons ex-
pertise and infrastructure of the national se-
curity laboratories (as defined in section 4002 
of the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 
2501)), those laboratories should continue to

the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 4223. EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT PRO-
GRAM FOR LIFE EXTENSION PRO-
GRAMS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall 
establish an earned value management pro-
gram to establish earned value management 
standards— 
‘‘(1) to ensure specific benchmarks are set 
for technology readiness for life extension 
programs; and 
‘‘(2) to ensure that appropriate risk mitiga-
tion measures are taken to meet the cost 
and schedule requirements of such programs. 
‘‘(b) REVIEW OF CONTRACTOR EARNED VALUE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.—The Administrator 
shall enter into an arrangement with an 
independent entity under which that entity 
shall review and determine whether the 
earned value management standards of con-
tractors of the Administration for life exten-
sion programs are consistent with the stand-
ards established under subsection (a). 
‘‘(c) RECONCILIATION OF COST ESTIMATES.— 
The Administrator shall ensure that key de-
cisions of the Administration concerning 
project milestones in life extension programs 
are based on a reconciliation of cost esti-
mates of the Administration with any inde-
pendent cost estimates conducted by the Di-

related to reducing the time required to exe-
cute a nuclear test if necessary. 
SEC. 3167. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXTENSION 
OF LIMITATIONS ON IMPORTATION 
OF URANIUM FROM RUSSIAN FED-
ERATION. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) a secure nuclear fuel supply chain is es-
sential to the economic and national secu-
rity of the United States; 
(2) the United States should— 
(A) expeditiously complete negotiation of 
an extension of the Agreement Suspending 
the Antidumping Investigation on Uranium 
from the Russian Federation (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Russian Suspension Agree-
ment’’); or 
(B) if an agreement to extend the Russian 
Suspension Agreement cannot be reached, 
complete 
the 
antidumping 
investigation 
under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) with respect to imports of 
uranium from the Russian Federation— 
(i) to avoid unfair trade in uranium and 
maintain a nuclear fuel supply chain in the 
United States, consistent with the national 
security and nonproliferation goals of the 
United States; and 
(ii) to protect the United States nuclear 
fuel supply chain from the continued manip-
ulation of the global and United States ura-
nium markets by the Russian Federation 
and Russian-influenced competitors; 
(3) a renegotiated, long-term extension of 
the Russian Suspension Agreement can pre-
vent adversaries of the United States from 
monopolizing the nuclear fuel supply chain; 
(4) as was done in 2008, upon completion of 
a new negotiated long-term extension of the 
Russian Suspension Agreement, Congress 
should enact legislation to codify the terms 
of extension into law to ensure long-term 
stability for the domestic nuclear fuel supply 
chain; and 
(5) if the negotiations to extend the Rus-
sian Suspension Agreement prove unsuccess-
ful, Congress should be prepared to enact leg-
islation to prevent the manipulation by the 
Russian Federation of global uranium mar-
kets and potential domination by the Rus-
sian Federation of the United States ura-
nium market.

porting vendor base constitute a national se-
curity imperative that is unique and must be 
protected; 
(2) a healthy and efficient industrial base 
continues to be a fundamental driver for 
achieving and sustaining a successful ship-
building procurement strategy; 
(3) without consistent and continuous com-
mitment to steady and predictable acquisi-
tion profiles, the industrial base will strug-
gle and some elements may not survive; and 
(4) proposed reductions in the future-years 
defense program to the DDG–51 Destroyer 
procurement profile without a clear transi-
tion to procurement of the next Large Sur-
face Combatant would adversely affect the 
shipbuilding industrial base and long-term 
strategic objectives of the Navy. 
(b) LIMITATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Navy 
may not deviate from the 2016 Navy Force 
Structure Assessment to implement the re-
sults of a new force structure assessment or 
new annual long-range plan for construction 
of naval vessels that would reduce the re-
quirement for Large Surface Combatants to 
fewer than 104 such vessels until the date on 
which the Secretary of the Navy submits to 
the congressional defense committees the 
certification under paragraph (2) and the re-
port under subsection (c). 
(2) CERTIFICATION.—The certification re-
ferred to in paragraph (1) is a certification, 
in writing, that each of the following condi-
tions have been satisfied: 
(A) The large surface combatant ship-
building industrial base and supporting ven-
dor base would not significantly deteriorate 
due to a reduced procurement profile. 
(B) The Navy can mitigate the reduction in 
anti-air and ballistic missile defense capa-
bilities due to having a reduced number of 
DDG–51 Destroyers with the advanced AN/ 
SPY–6 radar in the next three decades. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report 
that includes— 
(1) a description of likely detrimental im-
pacts to the large surface combatant indus-
trial base and the Navy’s plan to mitigate 
any such impacts if the fiscal year 2021 fu-
ture-years defense program were imple-
mented as proposed; 
(2) a review of the benefits to the Navy 
fleet of the new AN/SPY–6 radar to be de-
ployed aboard Flight III variant DDG–51 De-
stroyers, which are currently under con-
struction, as well as an analysis of impacts 
to the fleet’s warfighting capabilities, should 
the number of such destroyers be reduced; 
and 
(3) a plan to fully implement section 131 of 
the National Defense Authorization for Fis-
cal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92), including 
subsystem prototyping efforts and funding 
by fiscal year.

SEC. 6235. SENSE OF SENATE ON ADMISSION OF 
UKRAINE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
TREATY ORGANIZATION ENHANCED 
OPPORTUNITIES 
PARTNERSHIP 
PROGRAM. 
(a) INEFFECTIVENESS OF SECTION 1235.—Sec-
tion 1235 shall have no force or effect. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) On August 24, 1991, Ukraine became a 
free and independent country after declaring 
its independence from the Soviet Union. 
(2) The Russian Federation is required to 
respect the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of Ukraine through its 
signed commitments to the 1994 Budapest 
Memorandum, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, and 
the Charter of the United Nations. 
(3) On February 8, 1994, Ukraine was among 
the first post-Soviet states to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Partnership 
for Peace, and Ukraine subsequently partici-
pated in numerous North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization-led security assistance, peace-
keeping, counterterror, and maritime initia-
tives. 
(4) The North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and Ukraine have continuously deep-
ened their cooperation through the estab-
lishment of— 
(A) the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion-Ukraine Charter on a Distinctive Part-
nership and the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization-Ukraine Commission in 1997; 
(B) the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion-Ukraine Joint Working Group on De-
fense Reform in 1998; and 
(C) the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion-Ukraine Action Plan in 2002. 
(5) In the Bucharest Summit Declaration 
of April 2008, heads of state and governments 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization mem-
ber countries declared, ‘‘NATO welcomes 
Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspi-
rations for membership in NATO. We agreed 
today that these countries will become mem-
bers of NATO.’’. 
(6) Beginning on November 21, 2013, and 
ending on February 22, 2014, during a period 
that became known as the Revolution of Dig-
nity, the people of Ukraine peacefully pro-
tested the decision of then President Viktor 
Yanukovych to suspend the signing of the 
Ukraine-European Union Association Agree-
ment, resulting in the unanimous removal 
from office of Yanukovych by the Verkhovna 
Rada. 
(7) On May 25, 2014, Peter Poroshenko was 
elected democratically to become the Presi-
dent of Ukraine based on a pro-European 
Union and pro-North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization platform, which laid the foundation 
for progress on the European Union Associa-
tion Agreement. 
(8) In response to Ukraine’s Revolution of 
Dignity, the Russian Federation launched an 
overt and covert military campaign against 
Ukraine, illegally occupied Ukraine’s Cri-
mean Peninsula, and instigated war in east-
ern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of ap-
proximately 14,000 Ukrainians. 
(9) The Russian Federation’s invasion and 
illegal occupation of the Crimean Peninsula 
and 
instigation 
of 
conflict 
in 
eastern 
Ukraine in 2014 was widely viewed as an ef-
fort to stifle pro-democracy and pro-Western 
developments across Ukraine in the wake of 
the Revolution of Dignity. 
(10) At the 2014 Wales Summit, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization adopted the 
Enhanced Opportunities Partnership Pro-
gram as a component of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization Partnership Interoper-
ability Initiative, which would ‘‘encourage, 
facilitate, and sustain’’ Ukraine’s contribu-
tions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion. 
(11) In 2016, as a result of the Warsaw Sum-
mit, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
pledged additional training and technical 
support for the military forces of Ukraine 
and endorsed a comprehensive assistance 
package that included ‘‘tailored capability 
and capacity building measures . . . to en-
hance Ukraine’s resilience against a wide 
array of threats, including hybrid threats’’. 
(12) In 2017, in the face of continued Rus-
sian Federation aggression in the eastern re-
gion of Ukraine and the continued occupa-
tion of Crimea, the Government of Ukraine 
rejected cooperation with the Russian Fed-
eration and voted to make cooperation with 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a 
foreign policy priority. 
(13) On September 1, 2017, the Ukraine-Eu-
ropean Union Association Agreement en-
tered into force. 
(14) On April 21, 2019, the new president of 
Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy— 
(A) reaffirmed to European Union and 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders 
that Ukraine’s strategic course was to 
achieve full membership in the European 
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation; and 
(B) championed the adoption of an amend-
ment to the Constitution of Ukraine declar-
ing that the Government of Ukraine is re-
sponsible for implementing such strategic 
course toward membership in the European 
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation. 
(15) In January 2020, the Government of 
Ukraine requested that the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization grant Ukraine the sta-
tus of an Enhanced Opportunities Partner. 
(16) Since Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity 
and in recognition of the United States- 
Ukraine strategic partnership, the United 
States has— 
(A) provided Ukraine with more than 
$1,600,000,000 in security assistance, including 
critical defense items; 
(B) collaborated closely with the military 
forces of Ukraine; and 
(C) imposed strong sanctions on the Rus-
sian Federation in response to continued 
Russian Federation aggression in Ukraine. 
(17) On June 12, 2020, the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization welcomed Ukraine into 
the Enhanced Opportunities Partnership pro-
gram, joining Australia, Finland, Sweden, 
Georgia, and Jordan. 
(c) SENSE OF SENATE.—It is the sense of the 
Senate that the Senate— 
(1) applauds the progress of Ukraine and 
the Revolution of Dignity with respect to 
strengthening the rule of law and combating 
corruption, 
aligning 
with 
Euro-Atlantic 
norms 
and 
standards, 
and 
improving 
Ukraine’s military combat readiness and 
interoperability with the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization; 
(2) affirms the unwavering commitment of 
the United States to— 
(A) supporting the continued efforts of 
Ukraine to implement democratic and free 
market reforms; 
(B) restoring the territorial integrity of 
Ukraine; and 
(C) providing additional lethal and non-
lethal security assistance to strengthen the 
defense capabilities of Ukraine and to deter 
further Russian Federation aggression;
