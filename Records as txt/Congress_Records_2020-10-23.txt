Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2020 
No. 182 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 11:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
Rabbi 
Arnold 
E. 
Resnicoff, 
U.S. 
Navy, Retired, Washington, D.C., of-
fered the following prayer: 
Almighty God, we pray, reflect in dif-
ferent ways but together mourn our 
dead and tell their stories to keep their 
memories alive. 
Thirty-seven years ago today, I was 
in Beirut when a terrorist truck-bomb 
attack took the lives of 241 U.S. mili-
tary 
personnel. 
Fifty-eight 
French 
troops died a heartbeat later: a second 
truck, another deadly blast. 
They came in peace. They risked 
their lives to buy some time for 
change. Peace did not prevail, but their 
risk, their sacrifice must be honored 
and remembered. Their story must be 
told. 
Today, as we recall and honor Beirut 
dead and Beirut vets in a special way, 
we mourn all those we have lost to 
war, to hatred, and disease as well. 
Lord, may we heed Your call: to-
gether, to choose life—to work for, 
fight for life: a better life for those who 
one day will remember us. 
And may we say amen.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal King, You are great and mar-
velous. You alone are God. Without 
Your wondrous deeds, our Nation and 
planet could not survive. You continue 
to perform wonders on our behalf, res-
cuing us from ourselves. 
Lord, teach our lawmakers Your pre-
cepts so that they may walk in Your 
truth, experiencing the reverential awe 
that comes when You are near. Provide 
them with the inspiration and knowl-
edge that will bring peace and stability 
to our land. May we not conceal our 
sins but confess and forsake them. Sov-
ereign God, keep our Senators on the 
path of wisdom. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

nized.

554, S. 4675, a bill to amend the Health

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Republicans, as we all know and as the 
Nation knows, are running the most 
partisan, most hypocritical, and least 
legitimate process in the history of Su-
preme Court nominations. That is why 
I suggested the absence of a quorum. 
We are not going to have business as 
usual. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from New Jersey (Mr. BOOKER), 
the Senator from California (Ms. HAR-
RIS), the Senator from Alabama (Mr. 
JONES), and the Senator from Arizona 
(Ms. SINEMA) are necessarily absent. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Are there any other Senators in 
the Chamber desiring to vote?

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—MOTION 
TO PROCEED 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
move to proceed to executive session to 
consider Calendar No. 890 and ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, I 
believe the Senate majority is on the 
precipice of making a colossal and his-
toric mistake. By rushing this nomina-
tion through the Senate only 8 days be-
fore a national election, after 50 mil-
lion Americans have already voted, the 
Republican majority is steering the 
Senate, the Supreme Court, and the 
country in a very dangerous direction. 
The damage to Americans’ faith in 
these institutions could be lasting. 
So before we go any further, we 
should shut off the cameras, close the 
Senate, and talk face-to-face about 
what this might mean for the country. 
We need to restore public trust in our 
institutions, not continue to under-
mine it. The Senate majority may have 
the power to confirm this nomination 
before the election, but that does not 
make it right. Might does not make it 
right. 
We ought to have a candid conversa-
tion, Senator-to-Senator, in which we 
truly listen to each other before it is 
too late. So I am making a motion to 
move to closed session. 
f 
MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED 
SESSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in ac-
cordance with rule XXI, I now move 
that the Senate go into closed session. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a second? 
Mr. DURBIN. I second the motion. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The motion having been made 
and seconded, the Senate will go into 
closed session. 
The Chair, pursuant to rule XXI, now 
directs the Sergeant at Arms to clear 
all Galleries, close all doors of the Sen-
ate Chamber, and exclude from the 
Chamber and its immediate corridors 
all employees and officials of the Sen-
ate who, under the rule, are not eligi-
ble to attend the closed session and 
who are not sworn to secrecy. 
The question is not debatable. 
Pursuant to rule XXIX, I authorize 
the Secretary’s desk staff and her Dep-
uties and the Assistant Secretaries for 
the majority and minority to remain in 
the Chamber during the closed session. 
The doors will be closed. 
People who are not authorized to be 
here will please leave the Chamber. 
(At 12:55 p.m., the doors of the Cham-
ber were closed.) 
(At 1:15 p.m., by a vote of 53 to 44, the 
doors of the Chamber were opened, and 
the open session of the Senate was re-
sumed.) 
VOTE ON MOTION TO PROCEED 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The question is on the motion to 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider Calendar No. 890, the nomination 
of Amy Coney Barrett to be an Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
The yeas and the nays were pre-
viously ordered. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from California (Ms. HARRIS), 
the Senator from Alabama (Mr. JONES), 
and the Senator from Arizona (Ms. 
SINEMA) are necessarily absent. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Are there any other Senators in 
the Chamber desiring to vote or change 
their vote?

The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Amy Coney Barrett, of Indi-
ana, to be an Associate Justice of the 
Supreme Court of the United States.

CLOTURE MOTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
send a cloture motion to the desk. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The cloture motion having been 
presented under rule XXII, the Chair 
directs the clerk to read the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the nomi-
nation of Amy Coney Barrett, of Indiana, to 
be an Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court of the United States.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, col-
leagues, in my first experience with 
Supreme Court confirmations in the 
Senate, I was a young staffer for a jun-
ior Member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. That was also the same time I 
met a young guy named LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER, who had just left the Senate to 
go to the White House to work in Con-
gressional Affairs. So I have had an op-
portunity for quite a long time to ob-
serve the confirmation process through 
various ups and downs—periods when 
nominees were confirmed almost over-
whelmingly and periods during which 
they were heated, to put it mildly, con-
tests over the nomination. 
What I think you can safely say 
about the Senate over the last 40 or 50 
years is that it is in an assertive pe-
riod. In other words, viewing the whole 
process as a joint thing, the President 
has a role to play, and the Senate has 
a role to play. And at various times in 
the history of our country, the Senate 
has been pretty passive about it; at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6409 
October 23, 2020 
other times, they have been pretty ag-
gressive about it. But the Constitution 
is clear: The Senate has a role if it 
chooses to exercise it. 
Rarely have we ever had a nominee 
as extraordinary as the one we have be-
fore us right now. We have had a 
chance to witness this outstanding 
nominee. We have watched her in com-
mittee. She has demonstrated she has 
the deep legal expertise, dispassionate 
judicial temperament, and sheer intel-
lectual horsepower that the American 
people deserve to have on their Su-
preme Court. 
Last week, we saw why fellow legal 
scholars called Judge Barrett ‘‘a bril-
liant and conscientious lawyer who 
will analyze and decide cases in good 
faith,’’ and they say she is ‘‘tailor- 
made’’—tailor-made—‘‘for this job.’’ 
We saw why her former law clerks— 
her students—call her ‘‘a woman of un-
assailable integrity’’ and ‘‘a role model 
for generations to come.’’ 
We saw why the American Bar Asso-
ciation—an institution the Democratic 
leader has called the gold standard— 
the gold standard—deemed Judge Bar-
rett ‘‘well qualified’’ to sit on the Su-
preme Court. And they heard why the 
legal professionals behind that rating 
called her—listen to this—‘‘a stag-
gering’’—staggering—‘‘academic 
mind.’’ 
The chair of the ABA Standing Com-
mittee on the Federal Judiciary told 
the committee directly that ‘‘in inter-
views with individuals in the legal pro-
fession and community who know 
Judge Barrett, whether for a few years 
or decades, not one person’’—not one, 
not one—‘‘uttered a negative word 
about her character.’’ 
This outstanding nominee is excep-
tionally suited to this job, period. And 
I know we all know that. She is an ex-
ceptional nominee to the Supreme 
Court who will make the Senate and 
the country exceedingly proud. 
There are few of us around here who 
have experienced the last 30 years up 
close and personal, and I am one of 
them. Others of you have followed 
parts of history from the outside, and 
now you are making history. 
It is a matter of fact, a matter of his-
tory, that it was Senate Democrats 
who first began our contemporary dif-
ficulties 
with 
judicial 
nominations 
back in 1987 and who have initiated 
every 
meaningful 
escalation—every 
single one of them—from then up to 
the present day. Every escalation was 
initiated by the other side. 
In 1987, Ted Kennedy and his friends 
introduced 
the 
country 
to 
Robert 
Bork’s America—the first effort to 
smear a fully qualified judicial nomi-
nee based on insulting, apocalyptic 
scare tactics. Even some of the people 
who 
were 
directly 
involved 
in 
‘‘Borking’’ Bork—Democrats, by the 
way—say they regret that low moment 
and what it has unleashed in the years 
since. 
In the early 2000s, it was Democrats 
who very willfully invented a brandnew 
strategy to make judicial ideology, and 
not just qualifications, an acceptable 
criteria for tanking Presidential nomi-
nees. 
I remember reading in the early part 
of Bush 43’s first term a seminar that 
was convened by my friend the Demo-
cratic leader, and he invited a couple of 
scholars—Laurence 
Tribe 
and 
Cass 
Sunstein—to come talk to him about 
the appropriateness of beginning to use 
every single tool in the toolbox to stop 
judicial nominations. 
It was always possible to filibuster 
judges; it just wasn’t done. I mean, 
there are plenty of things you could do 
that you don’t do; it just simply wasn’t 
done. 
The best example of that was the 
Clarence Thomas nomination. There 
couldn’t have been a more controver-
sial nomination than that one. The 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
Joe Biden, and Ted Kennedy sitting 
next to him—it was about as aggressive 
as it gets. It made, in some ways, the 
Bork treatment look like child’s play. 
The committee reported out Justice 
Thomas with an even vote—even. And 
as we all know around here, it only 
takes 1 of 100 Senators to make you get 
60—just 1—only 1 to get the Senate in 
a place where you have to get 60 votes. 
The tradition of dealing with the ju-
dicial nominees with a simple majority 
was so strong that not 1 Democrat—not 
1—required 60 votes on Clarence Thom-
as. In case you don’t remember, the 
vote on this confirmation was 52 to 48. 
One Senator out of 100 could have de-
nied Clarence Thomas his career on the 
Supreme Court. That is how strong the 
tradition was of dealing with the Judi-
ciary in a simple majority way. 
Well, in Bush 43, my colleague, the 
Democratic leader, at this meeting, ap-
parently, with Cass Sunstein and Lau-
rence Tribe—I am paraphrasing, I am 
sure—was predicting all of these crazy 
rightwing judges were going to be sent 
up by Bush 43, and we ought to use 
every tool in the toolbox, whether it 
was used before or not, to stop judicial 
nominees. 
So Democrats used the brandnew 
tool, the partisan filibuster, to block 
one Bush nominee after another whose 
qualifications nobody even disputed. 
In her own confirmation hearing 
years later, for example, now-Justice 
Elena Kagan went out of her way to 
say that Miguel Estrada—a name some 
of you may not be familiar with, who 
got here recently—would have been 
qualified to sit on the DC Circuit. She 
said he even would have been qualified 
to sit on the Supreme Court. He be-
came the poster child for this new 
process invented by the Democratic 
leader and his colleagues to routinely 
filibuster judges. It was written, the 
suspicion was, that it might provide for 
Bush 43 the opportunity to name the 
first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, 
and, of course, they didn’t want that to 
happen. So Senate Democrats filibus-
tered him seven separate times in 2003. 
He was one of the many victims of this 
norm-shattering, 
precedent-breaking 
behavior. 
A few years later, colleagues such as 
Senators 
Biden, 
DURBIN, 
LEAHY, 
Obama, and SCHUMER tried to filibuster 
Justice Alito’s nomination to the Su-
preme Court. Fortunately, that was 
not successful. 
But then something really funny 
happened. Something really funny hap-
pened. All of a sudden, there was a new 
President—President 
Obama. 
Sud-
denly, a Democratic President was 
making judicial nominations. 
Well, imagine what happened then. 
Suddenly, Senate Democrats became 
very allergic to experiencing the ef-
fects of what they had started—in ef-
fect, the effects of their own playbook. 
They had no patience to taste their 
own medicine, none whatsoever. Our 
colleagues did not appreciate being 
held to the standards they had just cre-
ated a few years before. The shoe was 
on the other foot. 
Well, we all know what happened 
next—another massive Senate-shaking 
escalation by Senate Democrats in 
2013: the nuclear option. They broke 
the Senate rules to change the Senate 
rules so that a Democratic President 
would not have to play by the same 
rules they had invented shortly before. 
And with a 51-vote threshold in place, 
Democrats began confirming nominees 
without meaningful minority support. 
I said at the time, quoting myself: 
They would regret it a lot sooner than 
they would think. 
Well, that regret began in 2016. In 
2016, when Justice Scalia passed away, 
Senate Republicans had won our ma-
jority a year later. As I said then, when 
I recommended to all of you that we 
not fill that vacancy created in the 
middle of a Presidential election year, 
you would have to go back to 1888 to 
find the last time a Senate of a dif-
ferent party from the President con-
firmed a Supreme Court nominee to a 
vacancy created during the Presi-
dential election year. In other words, 
not surprisingly, one party in control 
of the Senate was less inclined—and 
had been less inclined for a very long 
time—to confirm a Supreme Court 
nominee in the middle of a Presidential 
election year. It was entirely within 
the rights of the Senate to do that be-
cause what had clearly developed over 
these years was the Senate viewed 
itself as a partner—a partner—in the 
process. The President gets to nomi-
nate, but we get to decide whether to 
act on the nomination. 
Needless to say, after the unprece-
dented Senate-shaking steps that Sen-
ate Democrats had taken, the Repub-
lican Senate majority was not much 
inclined to depart from precedent and 
do President Obama that favor. 
Our decision in 2016 was fully in line 
with precedent, fully within the Con-
stitution, and completely within the 
Senate rules. Now, I understand why 
they didn’t like it. I wouldn’t have ei-
ther. Of course they didn’t like it. But 
elections 
have 
consequences, 
and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6410 
October 23, 2020 
America had chosen a Republican Sen-
ate in 2014. 
But there is no parallel between ac-
tually breaking the rules, as the Demo-
crats did in 2013, and merely applying 
the rules in ways the Democrats do not 
like. There is a big difference between 
breaking the rules and applying the 
rules in ways the Democrats did not 
like. If the Senate is going to function, 
we must maintain a distinction be-
tween when people break the rules and 
when they apply the rules in ways we 
may not like. 
When President Trump won in 2016, 
Senate Democrats took yet another 
reckless and unprecedented step. They 
mounted the first ever successful par-
tisan filibuster of a Supreme Court 
nominee. That had not been done be-
fore. They tried it on Alito; it didn’t 
succeed. They tried it on Gorsuch, and 
it did. The message was, in effect, no-
body who President Trump nominates 
is going to get 60 votes for the Supreme 
Court, no matter how qualified. 
Of course, speaking of qualifications, 
Justice Gorsuch’s qualifications were 
simply beyond question—someone who, 
frankly, has gone on to issue some rul-
ings, by the way, that these guys over 
here like, which shows you predicting 
what a Supreme Court Justice is going 
to rule on has been a hazardous guess 
most of the time. Their apocalyptic 
threats about predictions about what is 
going to happen with nominees of Re-
publican Presidents have been con-
sistent going back to John Paul Ste-
vens: Every single one of them is going 
to be a disaster for women, minorities, 
and all the rest—none of which, of 
course, ever materialized. 
So, Republicans applied and extended 
what Senate Democrats had begun in 
2013. They had left out the Supreme 
Court from being dealt with with a 
simple majority. So we decided we 
were going to return to where, by the 
way, the judicial calendar was—by 
practice anyway—just a few years ago. 
It was always dealt with with a simple 
majority. 
The 
Thomas 
nomination 
proved it. That was the custom here, 
until our friends on the other side de-
cided to start a new custom, within the 
rules but a new custom. 
So, all of my friends, this happened 
as a result of the threshold being low-
ered for the Supreme Court, and we are 
back to where we were as recently as 
Clarence Thomas. The Executive Cal-
endar is dealt with with a simple ma-
jority. I think that is better for the 
country, and they will benefit from 
that, too, at some point. 
When you have a President and a 
Senate of the same party, obviously, 
this is going to happen quicker. That is 
the way it has always been, whether 
the rule allowed a filibuster or not. So, 
ironically, we are back to where we 
were; the entire Executive Calendar 
will now be dealt with as it was a few 
years ago, before all of this back-and- 
forth with a simple majority. 
Well, obviously, Justice Gorsuch was 
confirmed on a bipartisan basis once 
the Executive Calendar was returned 
finally to a simple majority. 
And then Justice Kavanaugh—most 
of us were here for that—despite the 
horrific and embarrassing display that 
some of our Senate colleagues aided 
and abetted, we made it through that. 
So the good news is this: In about 72 
hours, I anticipate we will have a third 
new Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court—in about 72 hours. 
I do not blame some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues, who were not present 
for all of this, who wish the Senate 
would behave differently. 
But just know this—this is not spin. 
This is fact. Just know this: Every new 
escalation, every new step, every new 
shattered precedent, every one of them, 
was initiated over there. No excep-
tions. Every one of them. And it all 
happened over the strenuous objection 
of Republicans, who tried, in each in-
stance, to stop Democrats from trading 
away 
long-term 
Senate 
norms 
for 
short-term political wins. 
Seventeen years ago, colleagues— 
seventeen years ago—Democrats were 
boasting to newspapers about this 
brandnew campaign to politicize judi-
cial confirmations. They thought it 
was a great idea—bragged about it. One 
of my colleagues called himself the 
king of the filibuster and proudly 
wanted to own it. Well, sooner or later, 
the shoe is always on the other foot. 
So I hope our colleague from New 
York is happy with what he has built. 
I hope he is happy with where his inge-
nuity has gotten the Senate. 
Colleague, we have had this argu-
ment over and over for months, if not 
years. This is not really what we are 
here to debate today. We are here to 
actually consider an outstanding nomi-
nee 
whose 
qualifications 
nobody 
doubts—Judge Amy Coney Barrett. 
So, colleagues, let’s get on with it. 
Let’s do our job. Let’s rediscover the 
rational treatment of nominations that 
the Democratic leader embarked on a 
deliberate project, starting 20 years 
ago, to erase. 
We will give this nominee the vote 
she deserves no later than Monday. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
have just heard a tit-for-tat, con-
voluted version of history that the ma-
jority leader uses to justify steering 
the Senate toward one of the lowest 
moments in its long history. Might 
does not make right. 
‘‘You did something wrong, so we can 
do something wrong’’ is no justifica-
tions when the rights of the American 
people are at stake. The Republican 
majority is steering the Senate toward 
one of the lowest moments in its long 
history. The Republican majority is on 
the precipice of making a colossal and 
historic mistake, and the damage it 
does to this Chamber will be irrev-
ocable. 
After thwarting the constitutional 
prerogative of a duly elected Demo-
cratic President to appoint a Supreme 
Court Justice because it was an elec-
tion year, the Republican majority is 
rushing to confirm a Justice for a Re-
publican President 1 week before elec-
tion day. Consistency? I am afraid not. 
You don’t have the right to argue con-
sistency when you are doing what you 
are doing now. 
Four short years ago, all of our Re-
publican friends argued that it was a 
principle—that was the word they used, 
‘‘principle’’—to let the American peo-
ple have a voice in the selection of a 
Supreme Court Justice because an 
election was 8 months away. 
Those same Republicans are pre-
paring to confirm a Justice with an 
election that is 8 days away. In the 
process, the majority has trampled 
over norms, rules, standards, honor, 
values—any of them—that could pos-
sibly stand in its monomaniacal pur-
suit to put someone on the Court who 
will take away the rights of so many 
Americans. 
The Republican majority, of course, 
ignored health guidelines to conduct 
in-person hearings in the middle of a 
pandemic after Republican members of 
the committee themselves had con-
tracted COVID–19. It has broken long-
standing Senate precedent. Never— 
never in the history of the Senate, de-
spite any sophistic analyses of recent 
history, never has a Supreme Court 
nominee, a lifetime appointment, been 
considered so close to an election. The 
Presiding Officer of the Senate con-
firmed this yesterday in response to 
this Senator’s inquiry; never in the his-
tory of the Senate has a Supreme 
Court nominee been confirmed after 
July of an election year. 
My friends, it is the hallmark of de-
mocracy that might does not make 
right. The Republican Senate is bla-
tantly ignoring this principle. Here in 
Leader MCCONNELL’s Senate, the ma-
jority lives by the rules of ‘‘because we 
can.’’ They completely ignore the ques-
tion of whether they should. 
A Supreme Court nominee will be 
confirmed on a party-line vote after 
the rules were changed to allow it. Now 
it doesn’t matter that an election is 
just a short time away. It is a complete 
contradiction of the supposed principle 
that same party so vehemently argued 
only 4 years ago. Again, it is 8 days—8 
days—before an election in which the 
American people will choose exactly 
whom they want to pick Supreme 
Court Justices for them. 
For the Republican leader to argue 
for consistency, using his convoluted 
version of history is laughable. It is ab-
surd. It is outrageous. It is a stain on 
this body and an indelible mark on this 
Senate majority. In short, the Senate 
Republican majority is conducting the 
most rushed, most partisan, and least 
legitimate process in the entire history 
of Supreme Court nominations, and 
Democrats will not lend an ounce of le-
gitimacy to the process. 
Yesterday, the seats of the Demo-
cratic members of the Judiciary re-
mained vacant in that committee

room. In their place, were the remind-
ers of what is ultimately at stake in 
this 
nomination—the 
fundamental 
rights of the American people. It is not 
Democrat or Republican or who did 
this when and who did that when. It is 
the rights of the American people, 
what America needs and what Judge 
Barrett has stood for on these issues in 
the past that is ultimately what mat-
ters. 
On the seats of those Democratic 
members were photographs of Ameri-
cans whose lives would be devastated if 
a Justice Barrett delivers the decisive 
vote to strike down the Affordable Care 
Act, ripping away healthcare from tens 
of millions of Americans and elimi-
nating protections for more than 130 
million Americans with preexisting 
conditions. 
You could imagine, alongside their 
faces, the faces of women who cherish 
the right to make their own private 
medical decisions, the faces of LGBTQ 
Americans who want to marry whom 
they love and not be fired for who they 
are, the faces of American workers who 
are breaking their backs to make ends 
meet and need their union to help them 
get a better wage, the faces of young 
people who know that the planet is in 
peril in their lifetimes. 
I hope that when Republican Mem-
bers of the Senate think about this 
nomination, they will think about 
those faces and what this nomination 
means to them, the hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans who will lose rights 
and fundamental things they need to 
make their lives better because of this 
nomination. It is not about qualifica-
tions. It is about what the American 
people need and want and will an 
unelected body take those rights away 
from them. 
So I hope my colleagues will think 
about that. Take a moment. Take a 
moment to think about it, and then 
think about what it says about this 
sham of a process and the passion that 
we on this side of the aisle feel about 
protecting those people’s rights, that 
we were forced to take the extraor-
dinary step of refusing to participate in 
this process, because while they may 
realize it or not, our Republican major-
ity’s monomaniacal drive to confirm 
this Justice in the most hypocritical, 
the most inconsistent of circumstances 
will forever defile the Senate and, even 
more importantly, curtail the funda-
mental rights of the American people 
for generations to come. Democrats 
will play no part in that.

MORNING BUSINESS 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, for 100 
years, the Rotary Club of Bowling 
Green, KY, has been committed to the 
highest 
standards 
of 
humanitarian 
service. The results of this century of 
engagement can be seen in successful 
projects throughout my hometown of 
Bowling Green, but also abroad, where 
our local Rotary Club has partnered 
with Rotary International to globally 
eradicate polio and to meet other enor-
mous public health and safety needs. I 
was privileged to participate, along 
with one of my sons, in a project to 
bring clean, chlorinated water to an 
underserved community in Guatemala 
and to see, firsthand, the impact that 
the Rotary Club of Bowling Green is 
having in the lives of families and chil-
dren in that country. This is a tremen-
dous organization that deserves our 
recognition. I commend its current 
president, Alan Palmer, his board, and 
the current members—who give gener-
ously of their time, resources, and tal-
ents—for leading this organization into 
a new century of service.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. CARDIN): 
S. 4854. A bill to provide payments 
for home health services furnished via 
visual or audio telecommunication sys-
tems during an emergency period; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today. along with my colleague Sen-
ator CARDIN, to introduce the Home 
Health Emergency Access to Tele-
health Act or Heat Act. This bipartisan 
bill would help ensure that seniors who 
rely on home health care have the 
choice to receive these critical services 
through telehealth during the COVID– 
19 pandemic and future public health 
emergencies. 
COVID–19 
is 
the 
greatest 
public 
health challenge since the flu pan-
demic of 1918 and has claimed the lives 
of more than 200,000 Americans. This 
public health emergency has under-
scored the need for older adults and 
other at-risk populations to have ac-
cess to health care in the home setting. 
Home-based care is crucial to ensuring 
that this pandemic does not create dev-
astating 
long-term 
health 
con-
sequences due to delayed care. The 
highly skilled and compassionate care 
that home health agencies provide are 
an 
important 
component 
of 
this 
inhome care. 
I have been a strong supporter of 
home care since my very first home 
visit, which took place in my home-
town in Aroostook County early in my 
Senate service. This experience gave 
me the opportunity to meet and visit 
with home health patients, where I saw 
first-hand what a difference highly 
skilled and caring visiting nurses and 
other health care professionals make 
to the lives of patients and their fami-
lies. I have been a passionate advocate 
for home care ever since. 
In March, my bipartisan home health 
legislation, the Home Health Care 
Planning Improvement Act, became 
law as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security (CARES) 
Act. This new law will improve the ac-
cess Medicare beneficiaries have to 
home health care by allowing physi-
cian assistants, nurse practitioners, 
clinical nurse specialists, and certified

October 23, 2020 
nurse midwives to order home health 
services. Far too often seniors experi-
ence unnecessary delays in accessing 
home health care. To avoid these need-
less delays, it is common sense that 
other medical professionals who are fa-
miliar with a patient’s case should be 
able to order these services. 
Home health professionals have con-
tinued to provide face-to-face services 
during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency, but this crisis has created 
additional challenges, including the 
need to maintain an adequate supply of 
personal protective equipment to pro-
tect themselves, their patients, and 
their patients’ families. The use of 
telehealth and virtual visits can help 
address these challenges. Unlike other 
Medicare providers, however, home 
health agencies are not eligible to re-
ceive Medicare reimbursement for tele-
health services during the COVID–19 
emergency. 
In May, I led Congress’ first hearing 
examining COVID–19’s devastating im-
pact on seniors. During the hearing, 
Dr. Steven H. Landers, President and 
CEO of the Visiting Nurse Association 
Health Group, testified that, despite 
this lack of Medicare reimbursement, 
his organization has found telehealth 
to be an essential part of providing 
high quality home health care during 
the COVID–19 public health emergency. 
He urged action to ensure that home 
health providers can continue offering 
these critical services remotely. 
Maine home health care providers 
have also shared stories about how 
telehealth is helping them to continue 
caring 
for 
their 
patients 
during 
COVID–19. Through a combination of 
video visits and care calls, one provider 
has been able to care for a woman with 
severe heart and lung disease and keep 
this patient out of the hospital. The 
nurse would speak with the woman by 
phone a couple of times per week to as-
sess any symptoms that needed follow 
up. If the nurse identified an issue dur-
ing the call, she would schedule a video 
visit and also work with the patient’s 
physician to modify medications as 
needed. 
The bill I am introducing today 
would authorize Medicare reimburse-
ment for home health services provided 
through telehealth during a public 
health emergency where telehealth can 
be used appropriately. The services 
would not be reimbursed unless the 
beneficiary consents to receiving the 
services via telehealth. To ensure that 
the Medicare home health benefit does 
not become a telehealth-only benefit, 
Medicare reimbursement would only be 
provided if the telehealth services con-
stitute no more than half of the 
billable visits made during the 30–day 
payment period. 
Home health serves a vital role in 
helping our nation’s seniors avoid more 
costly hospital visits and nursing home 
stays. The COVID–19 emergency has 
further underscored the critical impor-
tance of home health services and high-
lighted how these agencies are able to 
use telehealth to provide skilled care 
to their patients. The Home Health 
Emergency 
Access 
to 
Telehealth 
(HEAT) Act would ensure that seniors 
in Maine and across the country retain 
access to remote home health services 
during the COVID–19 emergency and 
future public health emergencies. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 756—URGING 
THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA 
AND ALL PARTIES TO RESPECT 
HUMAN, CIVIL, AND POLITICAL 
RIGHTS AND ENSURE FREE AND 
FAIR 
ELECTIONS 
IN 
OCTOBER 
2020, AND RECOGNIZING THE IM-
PORTANCE OF MULTI-PARTY DE-
MOCRACY IN TANZANIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 756 
Whereas the United States has an impor-
tant interest in supporting democracy in 
Tanzania and has consistently demonstrated 
support for the people of Tanzania through 
efforts to advance good governance, eco-
nomic growth, and improved access to health 
and education; 
Whereas respect for human, civil, and po-
litical rights and deepening multiparty de-
mocracy are essential to Tanzania’s long- 
term economic prosperity and continued po-
litical stability; 
Whereas the conduct of elections will have 
a significant impact on the trajectory of 
democratic growth in Tanzania, as well as 
its relationship with the United States; 
Whereas Tanzania has held successive 
multiparty elections since 1995, with the 
elections in 2015 being the most competitive 
to date, despite substantial state inter-
ference in political organizing by the opposi-
tion, both during and following the campaign 
period; 
Whereas, since President John Magufuli’s 
election in 2015, the Government of Tanzania 
has adopted and enforced multiple repressive 
laws that restrict media freedoms, and free-
doms of expression, assembly, and associa-
tion, such as the Cybercrimes Act of 2015, the 
Media Services Act of 2016, the Electronic 
and Postal Communications (Online Con-
tent) Regulations Act of 2020, the Written 
Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 3) 
Act, 2018, and the Written Laws (Miscella-
neous Amendments) Act No. 3 of 2020; 
Whereas the Government of Tanzania has 
promulgated onerous regulations that ac-
tively undermine the independent collection, 
dissemination, and publication of statistics 
without government approval, and suspended 
or halted activities by multiple newspapers 
and digital and broadcast media outlets in 
retaliation for publishing content deemed 
critical of the state or officials; 
Whereas state actors have threatened, ar-
bitrarily arrested, and attacked journalists 
with impunity, and some journalists have 
disappeared; 
Whereas in mid-2016, the Magufuli Admin-
istration placed a ban on political party ral-
lies until the 2020 elections; 
Whereas political freedoms were further 
eroded following the amendment of the Po-
litical Parties Act in January 2019, which 
granted 
Tanzanian 
authorities 
sweeping 
powers to regulate the operations of opposi-
tion parties, and private opposition political 
party meetings have been broken up by po-
lice; 
Whereas freedom of association has been 
limited through mandatory registration and 
reporting processes for nongovernmental or-
ganizations that are arbitrary in nature; 
Whereas, in September 2019, the Govern-
ment of Tanzania amended both the Compa-
nies Act and Nongovernmental Organization 
Act, which has severely restricted the ability 
of civil society organizations, particularly 
those focused on democracy and human 
rights, to receive foreign funds; 
Whereas opposition leaders have been 
threatened, intimidated, and physically at-
tacked, and the Magafuli Administration has 
failed to hold perpetrators accountable; 
Whereas President Magufuli’s failure to 
hold Tanzanian government actors account-
able for arbitrary arrests, paired with ac-
tions to limit democratic space for civil soci-
ety, opposition parties, and citizens of Tan-
zania, has undermined the Tanzanian Con-
stitution and the rule of law; 
Whereas the Government of Tanzania has 
rapidly escalated its campaign of repression 
against the opposition in the lead-up to the 
October 2020 elections, through arbitrary and 
partisan legal action against opposition can-
didates and their parties, which undermines 
democratic principles of fair play and poten-
tially calls into question the credibility of 
the country’s October polls; 
Whereas some United States companies op-
erating in Tanzania have reported harass-
ment, corruption, and lack of respect for 
contracts and business operations, which 
threatens future United States business in-
vestment and trade partnerships; and 
Whereas the Government of Tanzania’s 
claim that the Novel Coronavirus (COVID–19) 
has been eliminated in the country, and its 
suppression of information related to the 
pandemic have not only placed citizens’ 
health at risk, but have also violated citi-
zens’ freedom of speech and right of access to 
information: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) urges the Government of Tanzania to 
ensure that the October 2020 elections are 
conducted in a free, fair, credible, trans-
parent, and peaceful manner that enables 
citizens of Tanzania the opportunity to exer-
cise their right to vote; 
(2) urges the Government of Tanzania to 
legally guarantee and respect the rights en-
shrined in its Constitution, particularly the 
rights to freedom of movement, expression, 
information, religion, and association, as 
well as equality, privacy, and personal secu-
rity; 
(3) urges the Government of Tanzania to 
foster a robust, market-led business environ-
ment conducive to continued United States 
trade and investment in Tanzania, including 
respect for the legal and contractual rights 
of United States companies operating in 
Tanzania; 
(4) calls upon the Government of Tanzania 
and President Magufuli— 
(A) to repeal repressive laws that are con-
trary to the principles of good governance, a 
healthy democracy, and the rights enumer-
ated in the Tanzanian Constitution; 
(B) to allow citizens, civil society organi-
zations, and political parties to assemble 
peacefully and express their views freely; 
(C) to immediately lift the ban on political 
activities and allow opposition parties to 
hold political rallies and demonstrations at 
any time, both during and outside of election 
periods; 
(D) to provide transparent, consistent, and 
nonintrusive 
procedures 
for 
nongovern-
mental organizations to register and to en-
able them to carry out programs and other

itor the October 2020 polls without hin-
drance; and 
(5) calls on the United States Government 
to continue to speak out against democratic 
backsliding in Tanzania and hold the Gov-
ernment of Tanzania accountable for re-
specting the rights of its citizens, in accord-
ance with its international obligations and 
the Tanzanian Constitution, including by— 
(A) considering the imposition of targeted 
sanctions and visa restrictions on actors in-
volved in perpetrating or abetting human 
rights abuses; 
(B) leading international partners and in-
stitutions, including those in Africa, in de-
veloping and implementing strategies and 
actions to promote and defend human, civil, 
and political rights and multiparty democ-
racy in Tanzania; 
(C) immediately conducting a review of 
United States Government assistance and 
cooperation with the Government of Tan-
zania for the purposes of reprioritizing such 
assistance should neutral observers deter-
mine that the October 2020 polls do not meet 
internationally accepted standards for cred-
ible elections; and 
(D) demanding the Government of Tan-
zania conduct full and public investigations 
that ensure judicial accountability for acts 
of violence perpetrated against political op-
position, journalists, and members of civil 
society.

AS 
‘‘PAN-
CREATIC 
CANCER 
AWARENESS 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. 
COONS, Mr. JONES, and Mr. BROWN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S.RES. 757 
Whereas pancreatic cancer will kill an es-
timated 47,050 people in the United States in 
2020; 
Whereas pancreatic cancer is the third 
leading cause of cancer-related death in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2020, pancreatic cancer has 
killed two United States icons—Representa-
tive John Lewis and Associate Justice of the 
Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg; 
Whereas an additional 57,600 individuals in 
the United States will be diagnosed with 
pancreatic cancer in 2020; 
Whereas, of those diagnosed with pan-
creatic cancer, 66 percent will die within the 
first year of their diagnosis; 
Whereas persistent healthcare inequities 
and disparities for communities of color 
compound the devastation of pancreatic can-
cer; 
Whereas the incidence rate for pancreatic 
cancer among Black Americans is 20 percent 
higher than that of any other racial demo-
graphic; 
Whereas the pancreatic cancer death rate 
is 17 percent higher for Black men than for 
White men; 
Whereas the lack of pancreatic cancer 
early detection research accelerates the ra-
cial 
unfairness 
in 
the 
United 
States 
healthcare system, with devastating con-
sequences for minorities; 
Whereas pancreatic cancer has no early de-
tection test to diagnose this cancer quickly 
and accurately determine the presence of 
this cancer; 
Whereas, if diagnosed early, the 5-year sur-
vival rate for pancreatic cancer patients is 
above 80 percent; 
Whereas, if pancreatic cancer is detected 
late, the 5-year survival rate drops to less 
than 10 percent; 
Whereas without adequate funding and 
early detection research, pancreatic cancer 
is not discovered until the late stages of this 
horrific cancer when treatment options are 
limited; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, pancreatic 
cancer received its own dedicated research 
program at the Department of Defense under 
the Congressionally Directed Medical Re-
search Programs; 
Whereas, in the Department of Defense Ap-
propriations Act, 2020 (division A of Public 
Law 116–93), Congress appropriated funds to 
the Congressionally Directed Medical Re-
search Programs, with $6,000,000 going to the 
Pancreatic Cancer Research Program; and 
Whereas the 116th Congress has a unique 
opportunity to make a historic investment 
in pancreatic cancer research at the Depart-
ment of Defense: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Pancreatic 
Cancer Awareness Month’’ for the month of 
November, 2020; 
(2) recognizes the critical importance of in-
creasing funding for pancreatic cancer re-
search at the Department of Defense and the 
National Institutes of Health to find effec-
tive treatments for this cancer and reduce 
the disproportionate impact on communities 
of color; and 
(3) supports the efforts of the many advo-
cacy organizations to educate communities 
in the United States about pancreatic cancer 
and the need for more research funding, 
early-detection initiatives, diagnostic tests, 
and effective treatments.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MOTHER 
LEE ESTHER DAVIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Moth-
er Lee Esther Davis. 
‘‘I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise 
shall continually be in my mouth.’’ Psalms 
34:1. 
Mother Lee Esther Davis was born the 5th 
of 10 children to the late Mr. Leroy and Mother 
Josephine Wilson, Sr., on December 27, 1955. 
A native of Bolton, MS, and longtime resident 
of Jackson, MS, Mother Davis transcended 
from Earth to Glory at her home surrounded 
by her family on Friday, October 16, 2020. 
After receiving her education from the Jack-
son Public School System, Lee married the 
late Mr. Levi ‘‘Ham’’ Davis, Jr., on December 
25, 1971, and to this union three daughters 
were born, Debra, LaTanya and Sharon. She 
also had one son, Jeremy. She became gain-
fully employed for several years as a dietary 
aide, and then went on to become a bus driv-
er with the Jackson Public School District be-
fore retiring after 13 years of loyal dedicated 
service. 
As a young child, Lee accepted Christ into 
her life and was baptized and filled with the 
Holy Ghost at the House of Prayer Church 
under the leadership of the late Pastor Doris 
Lee. She continued to serve faithfully at Holy 
Tabernacle as a Church Mother, Prayer War-
rior and member of the Home and Foreign 
Mission under the leadership of Pastor Ivory 
Lee. 
Lee is preceded in death by daughter 
LaTanya Davis and son, Jeremy Davis; one 
sister, Frankie Mae Wilson; and two brothers 
Leroy ‘‘Pete’’ Wilson, II, and Ray Paul Wilson. 
She leaves to cherish her memories and 
carry her legacy two loving and devoted 
daughters, Debra (London) of Pearl, MS, and 
Sharon of Jackson, MS. Six grandchildren: 
Meco 
Shoulders 
of 
Washington, 
DC, 
Jaquavious ‘‘Quay’’ and JaVonn Shoulders of 
Pearl, MS, and Jourdan, Avery and Ivory 
Davis of Jackson, MS. Four sisters: Ida M. 
Byther-Smith and Lida M. Thomas-Ragland of 
Chicago, IL, and Josephine Butler and Angela 
Wilson of Springfield, IL. Two brothers: Clifton 
(Kristina), and Jack Wilson of Springfield, IL. A 
very dear and special companion, Mr. Charles 
Boone, two adopted grandsons, Carl and 
Eeon Black of Muskegon Heights, MI; and a 
host of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cous-
ins and friends. 
Mother Lee Esther Davis was a woman of 
virtue, poise, strength, and wisdom. She stood 
for what was right and never wavered. She 
was the epitome of a Proverbs 31 woman. 
Mother Davis will be missed by many. Sleep 
on faithful servant of God and may your works 
praise you in the gates. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mother Lee Esther 
Davis.

HONORING 
STEVE 
AND 
LINDA 
WASHBURN OF PFLUGERVILLE, 
TEXAS 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 30 years of service and min-
istry of Steve and Linda Washburn with First 
Baptist Church in Pflugerville and their work in 
the Pflugerville community. 
First Baptist Church was founded in 1973 as 
a mission-minded ministry dedicated to shar-
ing a passion for God’s word and leading peo-
ple to faith and salvation in Christ. 
Under the guidance of Pastor Washburn, 
First Baptist Pflugerville has become an inte-
gral part of the community, where a strong 
sense of discipleship has led to the creation of 
many outreach programs—including children 
and student ministries, a food pantry feeding 
thousands in the community each year, sup-
port groups for the hurting, and a church com-
mitted to keeping Christ at the center of the 
family. 
Even as the church has grown, First Baptist 
Pflugerville has remained committed to their 
original mission-minded goals, and through the 
efforts of the congregation, thousands have 
found the joy, peace, and contentment that 
spring from a fulfilling and personal relation-
ship with Jesus. 
For the past 30 years, Pastor Washburn 
and his wife Linda have been a source of 
light, encouragement, and joy for the entire 
membership of First Baptist Pflugerville. Under 
their guidance, the church has seen significant 
change and growth from a membership of 
around 600 to 2,400. This growth allowed the 
church to build its current 1,500-seat worship 
center after outgrowing its first worship center 
built just a few years earlier. These buildings 
were necessary after outgrowing the old cam-
pus even after several years of providing three 
separate Bible study hours and worship serv-
ices each Sunday. 
Pastor Washburn’s commitment to outreach 
and involvement have made him a pillar of the 
Pflugerville community as the ministry of the 
church strives to help and protect vulnerable 
and hurting citizens. His desire to help led him 
to author a book, ‘‘Salt and Light,’’ that Bib-
lically explains many of the issues facing the 
Church and society today. 
On October 25th, 2020, First Baptist 
Pflugerville is saying goodbye to Pastor 
Washburn and Linda as they begin the next 
chapter of their lives in retirement. There is no 
doubt that Pastor Washburn will continue to 
spread the Word of God no matter where re-
tirement leads him. 
I thank both Pastor Washburn and Linda 
Washburn for their down to earth and positive 
leadership of this congregation, and for their 
impact in spreading the Good News of Jesus 
Christ. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our mili-
tary men and women who protect us, and for 
our first responders who keep us safe at 
home.

HONORING THE REVEREND ELLIS 
CLIFTON, JR. 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate and honor the retirement of Rev-
erend Ellis Clifton, Jr. 
Born January 15, 1953, the Reverend Ellis 
Clifton, Jr. is the only child of Reverend Dea-
con Ellis Clifton, Sr., and Marie Clifton. He 
grew up in Inkster, Michigan, and often com-
ments on his childhood, saying, ‘‘I had a 
happy childhood, but it was a different one. 
While others were playing ‘cops and robbers’, 
‘cowboys and Indians’, pretending to be super-
heroes, or playing sports, I was in my back-
yard playing priest.’’ There is no doubt he 
would eventually pursue work in the clergy. 
Reverend Clifton graduated from Robichaud 
High School in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, in 
1970, and graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree 
in Education in 1974, and certification to teach 
students in special education and with learning 
disabilities from Central State University in 
Wilberforce, Ohio. Reverend Clifton taught 
school in Columbus, Ohio, from 1974 until 
1988, when he entered Trinity Episcopal 
School for Ministry. He received his Master of 
Divinity in 1991, becoming the first African 
American graduate of the seminary. 
Before returning to Michigan, Reverend Clif-
ton served as curate and interim pastor in 
Pennsylvania and vicar in Ohio. He was briefly 
the Vicar at Church of the Resurrection in 
Ecorse, Michigan, before eventually settling as 
the 7th rector of St. Clement’s Episcopal 
Church in Inkster. Reverend Clifton’s work has 
gone beyond his service to St. Clement’s, but 
has extended to his surrounding community. 
Reverend Clifton is a lifelong member of the 
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Chaplain and 
Board Member of the National Action Network 
Western Wayne County Chapter, Member of 
the 
Inkster-Citizens 
Action 
Network, 
and 
Chaplain for the Bishop H. Irving Mayson 
Scholarship Fund. He’s also served on the 
Inkster Charter Commission and on Inkster 
Housing Commission until August of 2020. 
Reverend Ellis Clifton, Jr.’s ministerial lead-
ership, commitment to clergy, and service to 
Inkster is extraordinary and a true reflection of 
our great district. Please join me in honoring 
Reverend Clifton, Jr., on his retirement and 
job well done.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JOSEPH I. 
CASTRO 
BEING 
NAMED 
CHAN-
CELLOR 
OF 
THE 
CALIFORNIA 
STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Dr. Joseph I. Castro 
on being named the eighth Chancellor of the 
California State University system. Dr. Castro 
will be the first California native and the first 
Mexican American to hold the chancellorship. 
In his role as Chancellor, he will oversee 23 
campuses and 486,000 students throughout 
our nation’s largest four-year higher education 
system. 
Dr. Castro was born and raised in the small 
city of Hanford, in the heart of California’s 
Central Valley. The grandson of Mexican im-
migrants and the son of a single mother, Dr. 
Castro knows well the challenges so many 
young men and women face in their pursuit of 
higher education. Like many of his students, 
Dr. Castro is a first-generation college grad-
uate. He earned a B.A. in political science, a 
M.P.P. from the University of California, 
Berkeley, and later a Ph.D. in higher-edu-
cation policy and leadership from Stanford 
University. 
Since 2013, Dr. Castro has served as Presi-
dent of California State University, Fresno. 
Under his leadership, Fresno State attained a 
national ranking as one of the top universities 
in the country. The school was also recog-
nized for its commitment and achievements to 
diversity. More than 60 percent of Fresno 
State’s recent graduating class are the first in 
their families to attend a four-year institution. 
As President, Dr. Castro has led by example, 
encouraging Fresno State students, faculty, 
and staff to ‘‘Be Bold’’ in order to meet and 
overcome any challenge that would limit aca-
demic, personal or professional growth. 
As an advocate for Fresno State and the 
California State University system, Dr. Castro 
serves on numerous boards, including the His-
panic Association of Colleges and Universities’ 
Governing Board, WASC Senior College and 
University Commission, Mountain West Ath-
letic Conference Board, and the Stanford Uni-
versity Graduate School of Education Advisory 
Council. Before becoming President of Fresno 
State, he served for 23 years in the University 
of California system. From 2006 to 2013, he 
was Vice Chancellor of Student Academic Af-
fairs and Professor of Family and Community 
Medicine at the University of California, San 
Francisco. 
Earlier in his career, he held faculty and ad-
ministrative leadership positions at four other 
University of California campuses including 
Berkeley, Davis, Merced and Santa Barbara. 
Dr. Castro has received five Excellence and 
Innovation Award from the American Associa-
tion of State Colleges and Universities for his 
accomplishments at Fresno State. In 2018, he 
was named as CSU President of the Year by 
the California State Student Association. In 
2016, he received the Alumni Excellence in 
Education Award from the Stanford University 
Graduate School of Education. Dr. Castro has 
also been honored with the Ohtli Award, which 
is highest honor granted by the Government of 
Mexico to recognize leaders who have em-
powered the lives of Mexican natives in the 
United States. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Dr. Castro for all of his achievements. 
On behalf of a grateful Central Valley and 
State of California, we look forward to his fu-
ture accomplishments and what he will do for 
California 
State 
University 
students 
everywhere.

REMEMBERING JOSEPH ‘‘JACK’’ 
MEEHAN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Joseph 
‘‘Jack’’ Meehan, who passed away recently at 
the age of 88. 
Born and raised in San Francisco, Jack 
graduated from the University of San Fran-
cisco (USF) in 1954. Following service in the 
United States Army, Jack went to USF for law 
school; he earned his law degree in 1959. 
In 1960, Jack joined the Alameda County 
District Attorney’s (ACDA) Office. While there 
he created Point of View, a monthly publica-
tion, and Points and Authorities, a weekly 
video series, to help teach California prosecu-
tors. He was recognized for his accomplish-
ments by being presented with the 1978 Pros-
ecutor of the Year award by the California Dis-
trict Attorneys Association (CDAA). 
In 1981 Jack was appointed Alameda Coun-
ty District Attorney. He was reelected unop-
posed in 1982, 1986, and 1990. He did not 
run for reelection in 1994. 
Jack was affectionately known as the ‘‘Big 
Guy’’ at the ACDA Office, beloved by all of his 
colleagues. His leadership, respect for our 
system of justice, and concern for victims of 
crime will be long-remembered. 
It also should be noted that as district attor-
ney Jack hired a young KAMALA HARRIS, now 
a United States senator from California and 
the Democratic Party’s nominee to be vice 
president of the United States, to be a deputy 
district attorney. Clearly he could spot talent 
when he saw it. 
Jack was well-recognized for his lifetime of 
career success and community service. USF 
awarded him its alumnus of the year award in 
1994, and four years later it created the John 
J. Meehan Alumni Fellowship to honor USF 
alumni who help develop young lawyers. 
CDAA created the John J. Meehan Career 
Prosecutor Award, to recognize lawyers for 
career achievement in criminal prosecution. 
And, in 2003, the Saint Thomas More Society 
of San Francisco present him with its Saint 
Thomas Moore award. 
While Jack had many professional suc-
cesses, it was his family that mattered most. 
He and his wife, Janet, were married for 59 
years, before she died in 2017. They had four 
children—sons John Matthew (‘‘Matt’’), James 
Patrick (‘‘Jim’’), and Mark Emmitt, and a 
daughter, Anne Marie (who passed away in 
1968). 
It was mostly in San Rafael where Jack and 
Janet raised their family. There they hosted 
many a family event, at which Jack showed 
his talents for playing piano and bartending 
that he honed over the years. 
My deepest condolences go out to Jack’s 
many family members and friends. He will be 
greatly missed.

REVEREND DR. ALFRED GORDON 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
and privilege to recognize one of my constitu-
ents, Reverend Dr. Alfred Gordon, who has 
served the City of Mount Vernon, New York 
for more than 50 years in ministry. Reverend 
Dr. Alfred Gordon has served our nation both 
through his service in the United States Ma-
rine Corps and through his work in ministry 
improving the quality of life for the people of 
Mount Vernon, especially our most vulnerable 
populations. In honor of his 86th birthday, it is 
my privilege to acknowledge the work he has 
done to better his community and his contribu-
tion to our nation as a whole. He has set a 
high standard for civic engagement and serv-
ice to one’s community, and he is a well-re-
spected and integral part of the City of Mount 
Vernon. Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize Reverend Dr. Alfred Gordon on this 
special occasion.

BILL

INDIVIDUALS 
WITH 
PRIOR 
SERVICE 
UNDER 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RE-
TIREMENT 
SYSTEM 
TO 
MAKE 
DEPOSITS TOWARDS ANNUITIES 
UNDER THE CIVIL SERVICE AND 
RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND THE 
FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEES 
RETIRE-
MENT SYSTEM, AND FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill to correct a retirement issue for 
several categories of workers who used to be 
under the District of Columbia retirement sys-
tem. 
In 1997, Congress transferred several cat-
egories of workers who participated in D.C.’s 
defined contribution plan from 1987 to 1997 to 
the Federal Employees Retirement System 
(FERS). However, those workers’ service from 
1987 to 1997 was not counted for purposes of 
creditable service or annuity amount in FERS. 
In 2009, Congress gave these employees the 
right to have this service counted for cred-
itable service. 
My bill would correct this last retirement 
issue for these public servants. It would allow 
these workers to buy into the FERS annuity 
amount for the 1987–1997 by paying 1.3 per-
cent of their base pay plus interest, essentially 
the employee contribution for this time, and 
then allowing them the full retirement benefit 
to which they are entitled. 
Our bill is an important step to assisting 
these workers to get the retirement benefits 
they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF RITA 
BERTHAY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Rita ‘‘RiRi’’ 
Lilly Berthay, who passed away on October 6 
after a courageous battle with an extended ill-
ness. 
Rita’s life began on November 5, 1955 in 
Greenville, Mississippi. She went on to grad-
uate from the University of Mississippi with a 
bachelor’s and a master’s degree in social 
work. After her marriage to Michael Berthay in 
1979, she moved to Saltillo where she raised 
her two sons. A devoted Christian and mem-
ber of First United Methodist Church of 
Saltillo, Rita was known for being extraor-
dinarily strong in her faith and an inspiration to 
all who know her. 
Her dedication to serving others was evident 
in her 28 years in social work, mental health, 
and counseling. Rita’s career was her passion 
and purpose. She took great pride in helping 
those in need and felt she never worked a day 
in her life. She was instrumental in imple-
menting Crisis Intervention Training which 
trained local law enforcement how to handle 
mental health issues. Rita also served as CEO 
of the Lifecore Health Group until her retire-
ment this past July. 
Above all, Rita found the greatest joy in car-
ing for and spending time with her family, par-
ticularly spoiling her two granddaughters, Ava 
and Mary. She was selfless and generous, 
and always looking for ways to help others. 
Her life was one of service, grace, and love 
for her family and community and she will be 
greatly missed by all whom she encountered. 
Left to cherish her memory is her husband 
Mike Berthay; sons, Clint and Ryan Berthay, 
as well as many other extended family mem-
bers.

HONORING SANTA CRUZ SHERIFF 
MARCO ANTONIO ESTRADA, SR. 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Santa Cruz County 
Sheriff Marco Antonio Estrada, Sr., for his 
decades of public service to Nogales, AZ. The 
only Hispanic and longest serving Sheriff in 
the State of Arizona is retiring after a com-
bined career of over 50 years in law enforce-
ment. 
A native to Ambos Nogales, Sheriff Estrada 
was born in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. In De-
cember of 1944, his family immigrated to the 
United States and made their home in 
Nogales, Arizona. Sheriff Estrada grew up 
from humble beginnings, and his family often 
struggled to put food on the table. With a tre-
mendous work ethic, drive, and self-education 
through avid reading, he overcame poverty. 
Sheriff Estrada’s law enforcement career 
began in 1966, when he first joined the 
Nogales Police Department as a radio dis-
patcher. He continued to move up the ranks 
with promotions to Desk Sergeant, then serv-
ing as Captain from 1978 up to his retirement 
in 1991. 
In 1992, he decided to continue his public 
service career and ran for The Office of Santa 
Cruz County Sheriff. He was elected and 
sworn in on January I, 1993. Since then, Sher-
iff Estrada has been re-elected for seven con-
secutive terms and is finishing his ‘‘last 
rodeo’’, as he so famously called it, with a dis-
tinguished legacy of service to Santa Cruz 
County. A proud immigrant himself, he always 
promoted the welfare of immigrants and is an 
advocate for the border town. One of his most 
notable accomplishments was the construction 
of a new sheriff’s department and county jail 
named after him: ‘‘Tony Estrada Law Enforce-
ment Center.’’ His long exemplary career in 
law enforcement counts mainly accolades; 
however, as our country currently faces ten-
sions between communities and local law en-
forcement, his greatest accomplishment could 
arguably be the longstanding positive relation-
ship maintained between the local law en-
forcement agency and its community under his 
leadership. As a Sheriff who made it a point 
not only to enforce the law with strength, but 
to also enforce the law with compassion, em-
pathy, integrity, dedication, commitment and 
passion, it’s understandable why residents 
identify Marco Antonio Estrada, Sr., as a Sher-
iff who truly reflects the values of their small 
border town. Sheriff Estrada publicly defended 
those values and the people of Santa Cruz 
County against those who would demean the 
community. 
Sheriff Estrada also understood the impor-
tance of serving and giving back to his com-
munity after hours. He actively volunteers his 
time to many community-based organizations 
that include: United Way of Santa Cruz Coun-
ty (serving as a spokesperson for over three 
decades), the Boys and Girls Club, the 
Nogales Rotary Club, the Kiwanis Club, Way 
of the Heart Promotora Institute, Nogales Elks 
Lodge, is a lifetime member of the Fraternal 
Order of Police, and has always supported 
charitable organizations. 
Congratulations on a job well done and time 
well served. He is a hero to his family and 
community and an example of good policing.

HONORING TOMAS T. ALEJO, JR. 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Tomas T. Alejo, Jr., a 
devoted pastor, educator, activist, and com-
munity leader from the central coast of Cali-
fornia. Tomas will be remembered as a tire-
less advocate for social change in Watsonville 
and Phoenix, Arizona. 
Tomas was born on March 16, 1946, in the 
southern Texas border region of Weslaco to a 
humble migrant farmworker family. Tomas and 
his family migrated from South Texas to Cali-
fornia in the 1950s, where they worked in the 
Salinas, Santa Clara, Central, and Pajaro Val-
leys picking crops. They eventually settled and 
established roots on the Central Coast in 
Watsonville. Tomas attended Gonzales High 
School and graduated from Gilroy High School 
in 1965. From 1966 through 1968, he proudly 
served our nation in the United States Army 
during the Vietnam War. 
Tomas earned his teaching credential from 
San Jose State University and taught for 24 
years at the Santa Cruz County Sheriffs Reha-
bilitation Center in Watsonville. There, he 
trained inmates in the trade of auto body re-
pair and painting to help them positively trans-
form their lives and have employment opportu-
nities upon release. He also taught auto body 
repair and painting classes for six years at 
Hartnell College in Salinas. 
Tomas was also a longtime pastor for the 
Apostolic Church and served five years doing 
missionary work in the poorest parts of South 
Texas and Mexico with his family. He later co-
founded 
Hope 
Ministries 
Church 
in 
Watsonville, where he was heavily involved in 
many 
community 
events 
and 
activities 
throughout his life. Tomas contributed to 
countless policy advocacy efforts and co- 
founded the Annual Watsonville Peace and 
Unity March in 1994 to end gang and domes-
tic violence. Tomas also served as a contract 
negotiator for the United Farm Workers in the 
late 1970s and was invited to lead the opening 
prayer at the California State Capitol in Sac-
ramento in 2014 for the state’s Cesar Chavez 
Day Ceremony. 
During his retirement in Phoenix, Tomas 
was heavily involved in community action de-
fending immigrants. He was especially pas-
sionate about helping the homeless and less 
fortunate. In biblical tradition, Tomas deeply 
believed in the righteousness of defending the 
poor and most vulnerable in our communities. 
Tomas will be remembered for his lifetime of 
community service and virtuous spirit. We, as 
a community, celebrate his legacy and all he 
has done for the central coast of California. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in honoring the life of Tomas T. Alejo, Jr.

RECOGNIZING AND THANKING MR. 
ED PEREZ FOR HIS DEDICATION 
TO THE EISENHOWER MEMORIAL 
COMMISSION 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding work of Mr. Ed 
Perez who has served as the Director of Gov-
ernment Relations for the Eisenhower Memo-
rial Commission. It has been a true pleasure 
and honor to work with Ed many years as I 
have served on the Eisenhower Memorial 
Commission. 
Ed has proven himself to be a great ambas-
sador in interacting with Members of Congress 
and their staff. His passion for this project 
combined with his diplomatic and interpersonal 
skills were invaluable in helping us get to the 
end goal of dedicating an incredible memorial 
to one of our greatest American leaders. 
Above all, Ed is a truly kind person. 
As the commission winds down after com-
pleting this enormous task, I want to person-
ally thank Ed for his great work. He and his 
family can forever look at the monument and 
be reminded of his job well done.

HONORING VINTON POLICE 
OFFICER BRANDON ALTERIO 
HON. BEN CLINE 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Officer Brandon Alterio of the Vinton 
Police Department, who was chosen by his 
peers as Officer of the Year for 2019. 
A graduate of William Byrd High School and 
Liberty University, Alterio embodies the ideal 
of service above self. 
Following a six-year stint in the United 
States Air Force, he joined the Salem Police 
Department, where he served four years be-
fore transferring to Vinton PD last March. 
He made a quick impression on his col-
leagues and the community when he received 
notoriety for selflessly buying a nine-year-old 
boy a bike when he learned that the child’s 
had been stolen. 
When presenting the award to Alterio, the 
Chief of Police said that he was being recog-
nized for his devotion to the town, the agency, 
and the profession. 
The Chief continued stating that Officer 
Alterio had exhibited exemplary skills, a can- 
do attitude, and a desire to succeed in the 
short time he had been with the Department. 
Alterio has served the people of Vinton with 
excellence, compassion, and fairness, and will 
continue to do so. 
I congratulate him on this distinct honor and 
wish him well on his career in law enforce-
ment.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE UNITED NA-
TIONS 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the upcoming 75th anniversary of 
the United Nations and recognize the contin-
ued importance of multilateral action as we 
pursue a more peaceful, prosperous and just 
world. 
On October 24, 1945, less than two months 
after the world emerged from the deadliest 
conflict in human history, the United Nations 
Charter entered into force, formally creating 
the United Nations. The Charter was and con-
tinues to be a visionary document dedicated to 
the indispensable idea that, through diplomacy 
and consultation, states can work together to 
achieve a better world. 
American leadership played a central role in 
the effort to establish the United Nations. Even 
before the United States entered the Second 
World War, President Franklin Roosevelt and 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill issued the 
Atlantic Charter to outline their vision for the 
post-war international order. In the final years 
of the war, individuals like Cordell Hull, Ed-
ward Stettinius Jr., Ralph Bunche and many 
others played crucial roles in shaping the draft 
United Nations Charter. 
Congress was deeply involved as well, with 
Members on both sides of the aisle partici-
pating in the San Francisco Conference. Rep-
resentatives Sol Bloom of New York and 
Charles Aubrey Eaton of New Jersey and 
Senators Tom Connally of Texas and Arthur 
Vandenberg of Michigan helped make the 
case for the United Nations in Congress and 
to the American public. On July 28, 1945, the 
Senate voted to ratify the United Nations 
Charter by an overwhelming vote of 89 in 
favor, 2 against—a dramatic change from the 
rejection of the League of Nations just 26 
years prior. 
Yet the push for a United Nations also came 
from beyond the halls of Washington. In 1943, 
a dedicated, passionate group of Americans 
created the United Nations Association of the 
United States of America (UNA–USA), bring-
ing the discussion of a post-war order to 
homes and communities across the country. 
Thus began a rich history of advocacy for 
American leadership and participation in the 
United Nations that continues to this day, with 
over 20,000 UNA–USA members in over 200 
chapters across the country. 
In the decades since 1945, through the 
most turbulent years of the Cold War, through 
the challenges of decolonization and entering 
the new millennium, the United Nations has 
been center stage for the international com-
munity in addressing issues like conflict and 
peace, economic development, global health, 
gender equality, human rights and more. 
Through the United Nations and the multitude 
of specialized agencies that have emerged to 
coordinate international action, the inter-
national community has come together to 
eradicate smallpox and curb other infectious 
diseases, protect the ozone layer, lift millions 
out of poverty, promote maternal and child 
health, preserve cultural and historical sites 
and so much more. 
Yet, in an era of renewed great power com-
petition, we must not forget nor neglect the re-
sponsibility of the United Nations for inter-
national peace. This duty is enshrined first in 
the preamble of the United Nations Charter in 
its resolution to ‘‘save succeeding generations 
from the scourge of war.’’ In our world today, 
amidst heightened tensions, rising nationalism 
and a growing rejection of multilateralism, we 
cannot afford to forget United Nations Sec-
retary-General Dag Hammarskjo¨ld’s famous 
statement that ‘‘the United Nations was not 
created in order to bring us to heaven, but in 
order to save us from hell.’’ 
No one can deny that there are limits and 
flaws to the United Nations, and examples 
abound of ways in which the organization has 
fallen short. Yet it is also an evolving institu-
tion, reshaping itself to face the challenges 
and meet the demands of an ever-changing 
world. To quote Hammarskjo¨ld again, ‘‘set-
backs in trying to realize the ideal do not 
prove the ideal is at fault.’’ 
The United Nations was America’s answer 
to an uncertain global future in 1945. Since 
then, the United Nations has been a pillar of 
the liberal international order that has bene-
fited not just the United States but the entire 
world as well. 
It is too early to say exactly how future his-
torians will recall 2020. The challenges ahead 
are many, not just this COVID–19 pandemic, 
but also a worldwide economic recession, a 
global refugee crisis, climate change, and 
more. America’s answer to those challenges 
must include the United Nations. It falls upon 
all of us today, as heirs to the legacy of those 
brave and visionary Americans who won both 
the war and the peace after, to continue work-
ing with the United Nations in pursuit of the fu-
ture we want.

REMEMBERING JAMES M. RYAN, 
JR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my cousin James M. Ryan, 
Jr., of Warren, Ohio, who passed away Mon-
day, October 19, 2020, at the age of 51. 
James was born November 11, 1968, in 
Warren, Ohio, the son of James M. Ryan, Sr. 
and the late Linda DeMattio. On May 11, 
1990, he married Tina L. Jones, with whom he 
shared 30 years of marriage and many won-
derful memories. 
To say Jimmy was a devoted husband, fa-
ther and grandfather, who deeply loved his 
family is an understatement. His deep affec-
tion and joy that he got from his family was al-
ways evident to anyone who knew him. He 
loved nothing more than to be surrounded by 
them at a party or family event. Jim was a 
man of deep faith and compiled a list on his 
phone for people he was faithful to pray for. I 
have never witnessed anyone go through a 
battle for their life with the level of faith in God 
that Jim did. It was truly inspiring to watch him 
let go and Let God. He enjoyed hunting, fish-
ing, and coaching his sons in sports. He loved 
watching the Cleveland Browns, Indians, and 
the Ohio State Buckeyes. 
He was self-employed and the caretaker of 
Johnson Community Center. 
Memories of James will be cherished by his 
loving wife, Tina L. Ryan of Warren, OH; fa-
ther, James M. Ryan, Sr.; three sons, Michael 
Ryan, Zachary Ryan and Justin Ryan all of 
Warren, OH; sisters, Amy Machingo and 
Jaime Ryan both of Warren, OH; grandson, 
Aaron Ryan; mother-in-law, Dolores (Ashley) 
Yakubek and father-in-law, William Jones, Sr. 
and Jimmy had a very special relationship and 
bond with my dad, Allen Ryan, Sr., that they 
both treasured dearly. 
In addition to his mother, Linda DeMattio, he 
was preceded in death by his stepfather, An-
thony DeMattio; and maternal and paternal 
grandparents. Jimmy will be missed by so 
many. His spirit and love were a blessing to all 
that knew him. We are all better off for having 
been touched by his life. Godspeed Jimmy.

IN RECOGNITION OF AY YOUNG 
AND THE BATTERY TOUR 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize AY Young, an entertainer, 
singer-songwriter, dancer, producer, entre-
preneur, and leader in the fight for a more 
sustainable world. On September 18th, the Of-
fice of the Secretary General of the United Na-
tions announced that Mr. Young had been 
named one of the U.N.’s seventeen Youth 
World Leaders, a position he will hold for a 
two-year term. Standing out as the only Amer-
ican on that list, Mr. Young was then placed 
on Energy News Network’s annual ‘‘40 Under 
40’’ list, which recognizes young leaders pav-
ing the way for a clean energy economy. 
While these honors have shined an inter-
national spotlight on Mr. Young, his musical 
talents are rooted on street corners in the 
heart of America. 
Mr. Young grew up in Kansas City, Mis-
souri. A home-schooled Eagle Scout, he 
began writing poetry at the young age of four-
teen, drawing attention to topics far beyond 
his years. In fact, his earliest compositions 
brought focus to the ‘‘Troost Divide,’’ a deep 
and painfully visible scar left by decades of 
redlining and a lasting symbol of the residen-
tial segregation and economic disparities that 
persist in Kansas City to this very day. Mr. 
Young and his trademark fedora soon became 
fixtures of Kansas City street corners from the 
River Market to the Plaza. His shows have al-
ways been interactive and engaging, looking 
more like spontaneous parties than standard 
routines. In 2012, Mr. Young appeared on The 
X Factor, receiving a ‘‘Yes’’ vote from all four 
judges. However, despite this noteworthy ac-
complishment, Mr. Young was still unable to 
find a manager or record label willing to carry 
his career to the next rung on the conventional 
ladder to stardom. Unfazed, he went back to 
the street corners, this time not just in Kansas 
City but across the country, garnering a grass-
roots following while opening for the likes of 
Wiz Khalifa, SHAGGY, T-Pain, Flo-Rida, 
Aaron Carter, and Wyclef Jean. But Mr. Young 
wasn’t just busking his way across America to 
earn his keep; this too was simply an opening 
act. After learning that over a billion people on 
Earth lack access to electricity, Mr. Young de-
cided to turn his tour into the start of a much 
deeper, much more difficult, journey. Mr. 
Young’s tour, it turned out, would be powered 
entirely by renewal energy. 
Thus was born the Battery Tour, a global 
movement developed by Mr. Young and his 
enterprising business partner Thor Dietrich. 
Showcasing musical artists alongside innova-
tive new technologies designed to address 
global crises, the Battery Tour takes the forces 
of a musical experience, sustainability edu-
cation, and a humanitarian mission and unites 
them into a whole that is more powerful than 
any of its parts. Mr. Young has hosted and 
performed more than 800 shows around the 
world—each a unique fusion of original solos, 
interactive covers, and personal requests— 
powered only by renewable energy. His per-
formances are pure collaboration—collabora-
tion between artists, collaboration between 
music and technology, collaboration between 
Mr. Young and his audiences. If you have a 
request or want a turn at the mic, he will make 
it happen. Mr. Young calls his fans ‘‘outlets’’ 
because they provide the power that drives 
both his shows and the causes he champions. 
They see a world and a way of life in need of 
drastic change. ‘‘Outlets’’ across the globe 
have faith, I have faith, the U.N. has faith, that 
Mr. Young can help make it happen. 
The Battery Tour is a bold, innovative, and 
powerful idea, aimed at leveraging creative 
passion in pursuit of a societal goal, while 
leveraging a societal goal in pursuit of creative 
development. If the Battery Tour expands its 
reach and proves successful in raising aware-
ness the world over, significant innovations will 
be seen in the realms of sustainable energy, 
music, and live performance. And they’re just 
getting started. Young and Dietrich’s newest 
addition to the Battery Tour global brand is the 
creation of an app that promotes and 
incentivizes small acts of sustainable altruism 
among their many ‘‘outlets.’’ They hope the 
Tour will one day feature a large variety of art-
ists who can each be fully compensated for 
their work as they promote sustainability on 
the world stage. 
Madam Speaker, please join me, a proud 
Fifth District, and ‘‘outlets’’ around the world in 
congratulating Mr. Young on these well-de-
served honors and wishing him luck as he 
goes forth as an ambassador for our country, 
the 193 members of the United Nations, and 
a better, cleaner, more equitable future for all 
of humanity. Let each of us aspire to his ex-
ample and seek to set our talents upon such 
a noble and pressing goal. Our unsustainable 
life is contributing to worldwide inequality and 
condemning future generations to build their 
lives in a world on fire. So, to my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, l say this: if we truly 
want to honor Mr. Young and his leadership, 
it’s time to plug in.

LATING LISA SCHLEHUBER ON 
HER ELECTION TO THE NAFCU 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the role of credit 
unions across the country, and especially in 
Indiana. I’d also like congratulate Indiana’s 
Lisa Schlehuber on her recent election to the 
Board of Directors of the National Association 
of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU). 
Credit unions play a vital role in our nation’s 
banking ecosystem allowing more people to 
access capital, obtain mortgages, and receive 
other financial tools that are otherwise difficult 
to obtain. Additionally, I’ve seen firsthand in 
my own district, how credit unions provided 
vital services during the COVID–19 pandemic 
to ensure that the smallest of businesses re-
ceived the necessary aid to assist during such 
trying times. 
Lisa currently serves as the Chief Executive 
Officer of Elements Financial Federal Credit 
Union, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
She has 37 years of experience in accounting 
and financial management and has served as 
the CEO of Elements since 2005. During her 
tenure as CEO of Elements, the credit union 
has grown by over 60% and now manages 
$1.66 billion in assets and serves 112,000 
members. Recently, Elements was honored as 
one of Indiana’s best places to work. 
Lisa has a wealth of financial services and 
leadership knowledge. Her vision and deci-
sion-making skills will be a valuable addition to 
the NAFCU Board and credit unions for years 
to come. Lisa attended DePauw University 
and is an active member of her community, 
sitting on the local United Way and Chamber 
of Commerce boards. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Lisa Schlehuber and wishing her the 
best of luck in her new role on the NAFCU 
Board of Directors. I look forward to working 
with her and NAFCU members to better serve 
our constituents during these challenging 
times.

Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to 
Tom Bulger and his more than 40 years of 
service to the Metropolitan Transportation 
Commission (MTC), on the occasion of his 
well-earned retirement. 
The MTC is the San Francisco Bay Area’s 
designated metropolitan planning organization 
and the region’s transportation planning, fi-
nancing, and coordinating agency. After begin-
ning his career as a member of the MTC staff, 
Tom soon felt the pull of our nation’s capital 
and moved to Washington, DC, where for 35 
years he has represented MTC as President 
of Government Relations, Inc. During his time 
as MTC’s advocate, Tom has played a key 
role in advancing national transportation pol-
icy. 
Tom’s tireless efforts spanning four decades 
assisted in establishing Surface Transportation 
Program and the Congestion Mitigation and 
Air Quality Improvement Program through the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
Act of 1991 and continued to the present-day 
Fixing 
America’s 
Surface 
Transportation 
(FAST) Act which currently is funding projects 
throughout the country. Tom’s fierce advocacy 
helped secure full funding grant agreements

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRE-
VENTING 
UNWARRANTED 
COM-
MUNICATIONS SHUTDOWNS ACT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to 
introduce the Preventing Unwarranted Com-
munications Shutdowns Act, a bipartisan bill to 
limit presidential powers to control or shut 
down communications networks, including the 
internet. 
The American people rely on the internet for 
nearly every aspect of their personal and pro-
fessional lives and this dependence has only 
increased during the pandemic. As such, inter-
net shutdowns are an extraordinary infringe-
ment of individual rights. Sadly, authoritarians 
in many countries have used internet shut-
downs as a tool to squash rights. The public 
interest group Access Now reports that in 
2019, the internet was shutdown at least 213 
times. 
Section 706 of the Communications Act (47 
U.S.C. 606) currently authorizes the President 
to take control of communications facilities or 
equipment in certain circumstances. While the 
internet is, by design, decentralized and can-
not be ‘shut down,’ this provision leaves open 
the possibility for a presidential order that 
leads to Americans not being able to access 
the internet. 
While this provision is codified as part of the 
Communications Act of 1934, and it was 
amended in 1942 and 1951, the provision di-
rectly traces back to Section 2 of the Radio 
Act of 1912. President Woodrow Wilson used 
the authorities granted by the Radio Act during 
World War I in 1914 and 1918 with respect to 
telephone systems, radio stations, and marine 
cables. Earlier still, in February 1862, Con-
gress gave President Abraham Lincoln the au-
thority to take over telegraph lines during the 
Civil War. 
While historians can debate about whether 
these actions were warranted, they serve as 
an important basis for my rationale that the 
appropriate public policy measure to reform 
Section 706 is not to cut the power com-
pletely, but to add strict checks to it. 
The Preventing Unwarranted Communica-
tions Shutdowns Act limits the President’s au-
thorities and adds checks to any actions taken 
under section 706. In particular, my legislation 
limits the reasons the President may take ac-
tion under Section 706 to ones necessary to 
protect against an imminent and specific threat 
to human life or national security, if such ac-
tion is narrowly tailored and is the least restric-
tive means for the purpose; requires that the 
President notify congressional leaders (i.e., 
Speaker, House Minority Leader, and Senate 
Majority and Minority Leaders), senior execu-
tive branch officials (i.e., Vice President, de-
partment 
heads, 
intelligence 
community 
heads, Joint Chiefs of Staff), and the FCC be-
fore or not later than 12 hours after taking any 
action authorized under Section 706; nullifies 
Section 706 orders 12 hours after issuance of 
the order if the President does not provide no-
tification in the specified time and form; nul-
lifies Section 706 orders 48 hours after the 
President provides notice unless three-fifths of 
each of the House and the Senate vote to 
pass an approval resolution, with an affirma-
tive vote of at least one-quarter of the minority 
party in each chamber; requires a report by 
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
after every Section 706 order, and requires a 
one-time GAO report estimating the impact of 
a communication shutdown; and requires that 
the U.S. government compensate providers 
and customers of providers for any commu-
nications shutdown under Section 706. 
Unchecked executive powers and the emer-
gency authorities of the President under Sec-
tion 7–6 of the Communications Act need to 
be revisited. May there never be in a situation 
where these authorities are needed, but if 
there is, the representatives of the people 
should decide the scope and extent of any 
shutdown, not any single individual. 
I thank my colleague Congressman MORGAN 
GRIFFITH for partnering with me to introduce 
this important, bipartisan legislation, and I ask 
my colleagues to support it.

UNITED STATES AND REPUBLIC 
OF INDIA RELATIONS 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the robust friendship and 
solidarity between the United States of Amer-
ica and the Republic of India. 
Our two nations share a long history of part-
nership in response to the most ardent of 
global challenges. In 2007, Vice President of 
the United States Dick Cheney and Indian 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, along with 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Aus-
tralian Prime Minister John Howard, created 
the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. This 
framework led to the creation of the Malabar 
naval exercise. This agreement has proven to 
be prescient given the Chinese Communist 
Party’s recent malign actions in the South 
China Sea. In recognition of China’s threat-
ening posture, Indian Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi and United States President Trump, 
along with their Japanese and Australian 
counterparts have invested in the Quadrilateral 
Security Dialogue as a commitment to a more 
free and open Indo-Pacific. I urge our G–7 
partners to consider inviting the Republic of 
India into the G–7 to further our multilateral 
cooperation. 
During a previous meeting with the Consul 
General of India in Atlanta Dr. Swati Kulkarni, 
I learned of the recent conflict at the Line of 
Actual Control and the Galwan River. While 
India records countless times where China 
has crossed this border, this increase in ten-
sions resulted in the deaths of Indian soldiers. 
I appreciate Prime Minister Modi’s interest in 
reducing tensions and agree with the recent 
statements from United States Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo regarding the conflict. I 
applaud joint efforts by the United States and 
the Republic of India to combat terrorism and 
urge both countries to find additional areas of 
cooperation. 
Our two nations have grown closer and in-
creased collaboration as a result of COVID– 
19. This global pandemic has shown the world 
that it must do more to secure pharmaceutical 
supply chains and insulate them from harmful 
actors. It is my firm belief that increasing trade 
partnerships between the United States and 
the Republic of India will result in greater pros-
perity for our people. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Consul Gen-
eral for her time and for her sincere desire to 
build a better relationship between the United 
States and the Republic of India.

INDEPENDENCE FOR ARTSAKH 
HON. TONY CA´RDENAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call on the United States government 
to formally recognize the independence of the 
Republic of Artsakh. 
For too long, we have failed as a country to 
state unequivocally that the people of Artsakh, 
a historical part of Armenia populated by Ar-
menians to this day, have a right to self-deter-
mination as an independent republic and it 
has opened the door to violence. 
For weeks, Artsakh has suffered a brutal as-
sault by Azerbaijan and Turkey in the form of 
merciless rocket attacks and bombings. This 
is, in part, the consequence of our past fail-
ures to exert leadership in this region of the 
world. 
We must make clear that we will stand 
against the aggression of Azerbaijan and their 
allies in Turkey when they would wage war 
against a people for seeking self-rule and 
independence, a people for whom the specter 
of genocide still lingers. 
It is time for the United States to correct 
course and make it clear that we stand behind 
the protection of life and preservation of 
human dignity by standing behind the Repub-
lic of Artsakh. As the world’s oldest modern 
democracy, it is our heritage and duty to do 
so.

Garcia, known to friends, family, and commu-
nity members as ‘‘Lali.’’ A cornerstone of the

October 23, 2020 
office holder has improved thousands of lives 
in the Kansas City area across multiple gen-
erations. 
Lali’s ambition throughout her career has 
been clear: ‘‘To make a better life for the His-
panic community through [her] involvement in 
various organizations.’’ Over the last eighty 
years, Lali has accomplished that goal with 
conviction and grace. She began her activism 
at the young age of 13, when she first started 
going to the Guadalupe Center in Kansas City. 
At the time, the Center dedicated most of its 
resources to administering a school and clinic 
for underprivileged immigrants who had settled 
in Kansas City. Even at 13, Lali had a vibrant 
vision for what the Center could become: an 
integral part, a pillar, in the Kansas City His-
panic community. Serving for forty-six years 
on the Center’s Board of Directors, including 
three terms as the Board President, she 
oversaw a massive expansion of the Center, 
among many critical victories. Today, the Cen-
ter has grown to provide many essential serv-
ices for Latinos, including healthcare, edu-
cation, financial assistance, childcare, work-
force development, and much more. Today, 
the Guadalupe Center, in no small part be-
cause of Lali’s contribution, provides opportu-
nities for newly-arrived immigrants to achieve 
their American Dream while also promoting 
pride in their culture and heritage. 
But Lali, ever the visionary, was not satis-
fied transforming just the Guadalupe Center. 
She knew that change would not come for the 
Kansas City Hispanic community until they or-
ganized and voted for elected officials who 
would advocate for them at every level of gov-
ernment. Recognizing this, Lali founded La 
Raza Political Club in 1989. Under her leader-
ship, La Raza worked endlessly to register 
new voters for each election, ensuring for the 
first time a seat at the table for the small but 
vibrant Hispanic community in Kansas City. 
Most Novembers, you could find Lali at her 
polling place, trying to convince everyone in 
her community to vote for a more equal, more 
just, and more promising America. Even this 
year, amidst a global pandemic, she has 
worked with her team to register hundreds of 
young Latino voters in what could be the most 
important election of their lifetime. 
These actions alone would have been 
enough to satisfy most of us. But Lali has 
served Kansas City and the Hispanic commu-
nity in a variety of roles throughout her career, 
and she is always finding new ways to effect 
change. She is a member the Union Cultural 
Mexicana Ladies Auxiliary, a full-time volun-
teer at the Casa Felix Senior Center, and a 
Board member for the Ethics, Human Rela-
tions, and Citizen Complaints Commission. 
She was also appointed to the Guadalajara 
Sister City Commission, as well as the Port 
Authority Board of Commissioners, and has 
served on the Mayor’s Prayer Breakfast Com-
mittee since 1987. I list these accomplish-
ments not to account for everything Lali has 
achieved—an impossible task for such as 
short time. Rather, I highlight her work be-
cause it teaches all of us a lesson about what 
it means to participate in our community. The 
framers of our Constitution knew they were 
drafting a document to govern an imperfect 
nation, plagued by animus and inequality. In 
the preamble of this document, which serves 
as the foundation for our entire system of gov-
ernment, they instructed each subsequent 
generation to use its articles and amendments 
to form a more perfect union. The system re-
lies on passionate, courageous, free-thinking 
Americans like Lali, pushing it towards a more 
just, tranquil, and equitable way of life. The 
arc of the moral universe bends towards jus-
tice, but it doesn’t do it alone. 
Lali recognized early on that if she could up-
lift voices and register voters, she could 
change her neighborhood for the better. If she 
could change her neighborhood, Lali knew she 
could change her city; if she could change her 
city, she could change her state; if she could 
change her state, she could change our na-
tion. Lali represents all that is great about 
America, Madame speaker; she represents 
the audacious notion that one person in one 
city can change the lives of millions who have 
struggled to realize the full rights and protec-
tions of our government. I am eternally grate-
ful that fate brought Lali to Kansas City and 
that I have been able to witness her action, 
advocacy, and affection for others during my 
time in public office. Lali has done more than 
her fair share to make our union more perfect. 
One of the many unfortunate consequences 
of the ongoing public health crisis is the 
missed opportunities to celebrate and enjoy 
one another’s company, whether it is gradua-
tions, bar mitzvahs, naturalization ceremonies, 
or the birthday party of a local hero turning 93 
years young. It is imperative that we take time 
to celebrate life’s milestones. Madam Speaker, 
please join me and Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District as we forever enshrine our 
gratefulness for the work of Lali Garcia in the 
Congressional Record and as we wish her the 
happiest of birthdays. It is my fervent hope 
that we will be celebrating her 94th birthday in 
person, with a celebration fit for a local leg-
end.

CELEBRATING THE MARRIAGE OF 
JIM BERT AND LYDIA LAUDER-
DALE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the 50th wedding an-
niversary of Jim Bert and Lydia Lauderdale of 
Shannon, Mississippi. 
Jim and Lydia attended different high 
schools, with Jim graduating from Shannon 
High School and Lydia graduating from 
Okolona High School. Jim went on to become 
a Mississippi State Bulldog, and Lydia at-
tended Northeast Mississippi Community Col-
lege where she earned a degree in Nursing. 
Jim and Lydia were married on Wednesday, 
October 23, 1970 in Starkville, Mississippi, but 
later made Shannon, Mississippi their home. 
Five years after their marriage, Jim started 
his family business, Shannon Steel Service, 
while also helping his father’s business, Tom 
Lauderdale Paper Company. At the same 
time, Lydia was working in hospitals and nurs-
ing homes all throughout North Mississippi be-
fore retiring as a school nurse for Lee County 
Schools. 
Jim and Lydia are the proud parents of their 
two sons, Bert and Stewart Lauderdale, who 
work alongside Jim and Jim’s brother, Tommy, 
in the family business. They are members of 
Shannon First United Methodist Church, and 
are also proud grandparents of six. 
Their commitment to each other and the 
community is inspiring, and we wish them 
many more years of happiness.

RECOGNIZING MAJOR MICHAEL 
VINACCO 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Air Force Major Michael 
Vinacco on the completion of his Legislative 
Fellowship with my personal office. Major 
Vinacco has been assigned to my staff since 
January 2020 and has done a superb job as 
a trusted advisor for national security, foreign 
operations, and veteran policy issues. 
Major Vinacco was raised in a military family 
and earned his commission from Virginia Mili-
tary Institute in 2008. Prior to being selected 
for his prestigious Defense Legislative Fellow-
ship, he served as a Program Manager for a 
multibillion-dollar Air Force program. Addition-
ally, he has over a decade of experience in 
engineering and aircraft maintenance, to in-
clude a combat deployment to Afghanistan in 
2012. 
During his Fellowship, Major Vinacco was 
instrumental in helping my staff and I develop 
the fiscal year 2021 House defense appropria-
tions bill. His direct contributions will help pro-
vide our nation’s uniformed men and women 
with the resources needed to defend our na-
tion. Additionally, Major Vinacco coordinated 
dozens of engagements with senior depart-
mental officials to include a tour of the South-
west Border with Deputy Secretary of Defense 
Norquist and a tour of Naval Air Station Joint 
Reserve Base Fort Worth. In addition to de-
partmental 
engagements, 
Major 
Vinacco 
served as my connection to the defense in-
dustrial partners that make Fort Worth and 
North Texas our nation’s defense aviation pro-
duction hub. 
Airmen like Major Michael Vinacco are the 
reason our nation’s Air Force is the best in the 
world. On behalf of the 12th District of Texas, 
I offer my congratulations and best wishes to 
Michael, his wife Lisa, and children Luca, 
John, and Zachary, as they continue their mili-
tary journey in service to our great nation.

HONORING EDWARD J. TRACEY

OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, in this the 75th 
anniversary of the end of WWII, I rise to pay 
tribute to Edward J. Tracey. Like so many of 
our courageous WWII veterans, Ed is gone 
but will not be forgotten. Madam Speaker, I 
am confident that the following highlights of 
the contributions Ed Tracey made to the War 
effort will reveal a legacy, not just for the 13th 
District of Ohio, but for the broader impact 
Capt. Tracey had on the victory against tyr-
anny. 
Ed, along with his two brothers and two sis-
ters, grew up at RFD No. 3, a farm located in 
Cortland, Ohio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E984 
October 23, 2020 
Ed began his lifelong love of flying by taking 
lessons from a local flight instructor by the 
name of Ernie C. Hall at Hall’s Airport. Ernest 
‘‘Ernie’’ C. Hall who is widely recognized for 
his long career in aviation, was born near 
Warren, Ohio in 1890. A friend of the Wright 
brothers, Hall built his first powered airplane in 
1909 and flew it in 1911. He began his career 
as a civilian flight instructor in 1913, opening 
a flying school in Pennsylvania in 1915. Dur-
ing World War I he transferred to Call Field in 
Wichita Falls, Texas where he trained over 
500 military pilots for combat. In 1922 Hall re-
located his flight school to Warren, Ohio 
where he taught until his death in 1972. His 
1911 monoplanes have been displayed at the 
Smithsonian’s National Air & Space Museum 
in Washington, D.C., and at the National Mu-
seum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. 
Ed logged a total of 110 Hrs. at Hall’s Airport. 
Ed left the family farm and traveled to Can-
ada to join the Royal Canadian Air Force in 
May 1941, seven months before Pearl Harbor. 
Ed became a Flying Sergeant in the Royal 
Canadian Air Force and trained in the fol-
lowing aircraft: Fleet Finch, Harvard, Tiger 
Moth and the Fairey Battle. Ed logged a total 
of 375 Hrs. in the RCAF from May 1941 
through May 1942 and was awarded the Ca-
nadian War Medal. 
After serving one year in the RCAF, Ed 
transferred to the U.S. Army Air Corps in June 
1942 and was posted to Tyndall Airfield Gun-
nery School near Panama City, Florida for 
combat training. During training at Tyndall 
Field, 2nd Lt. Tracey met 2nd Lt. Clark Gable, 
the ‘‘King of Hollywood’’ and one of the stars 
of the 1939 film classic ‘‘Gone with the Wind.’’ 
After what must have been a night full of 
many stories, most likely related to training 
and the uncertainties that lie ahead, Tracey 
left sporting Gable’s service hat (also known 
as a crusher) and vice versa. They met again 
the next day for the ROTC (Return of The 
Crushers). Ed logged a total of 264 Hrs. in the 
following aircraft from June 1942 through Sep-
tember 1943: O–46A, L–4B, AT–6A, AT–6C, 
BT–13A, O–47A, O–47B, (P–51A, P–51B 
Mustangs), 
A–33, 
AT–9, 
AT–9B, 
P–40L 
Warhawk, (B–25C, B–25D Mitchells), B–26 
Marauder, B–34 Lexington. 
In October of 1943, Ed transferred to the 
522nd 
Squadron—27th 
Fighter 
Bomber 
Group. The 27th supported the 5th Army’s 
drive toward Rome. Ed flew the A–36 Apache, 
the P–40F Warhawk, and the P–47D Thunder-
bolt in combat. The nose Art on his Thunder-
bolt read RFD No. 3—Ed wanted the enemy 
to know where his special deliveries were 
coming from, and there were many. 
January 12, 1944, Ed was on a mission to 
take out enemy gun positions close to the 
front lines in South Central Italy. His A–36 
Apache developed engine trouble near Gaeta 
Point and he had to leave the formation. Ed 
got as far as the Volturno River Valley before 
coming down in a field for a belly landing. 
The impact caused the prop to slice through 
the canopy. Lucky for Ed, his head went down 
and forward, just in time to avoid disaster. Ed 
flew a total of 102 air combat missions from 
October 1943 through August 1944 and 
logged a total of 165 hrs. of flight in the Medi-
terranean Theatre of War. Rome was liberated 
on June 5, 1944. ‘‘ANGELS ON OUR SHOUL-
DERS’’ said Captain Mille (Tom Hanks), in ref-
erence to the P–51 Mustangs in one of the 
last scenes of the movie, ‘‘Saving Private 
Ryan.’’ Many of the Angels of the 27th Fighter 
Bomber Group did not return. 
Captain Tracey transferred to the 3rd Army 
Air Force in July 1944, and trained and pre-
pared students for combat in the P–40 and P– 
51 Mustang. Captain Tracey logged a total of 
362 Hrs. in the following aircraft until his dis-
charge on December 7, 1945: B–17F Fortress, 
P–47D Thunderbolt, BT–13B, C–47A, UC–78, 
(P–40, P–40F, P–40K10, P–40L, P–40N, P– 
40N15, P–40N20, P–40N25, P–40N35, RP– 
40N, RP–40N25 Warhawks), (P–51C, P– 
51C6, P–51C10, P–51D, P–51D20, P–51K5, 
P–51K10 Mustangs). 
All together Captain Tracey served a total of 
one year in the Royal Canadian Air Force and 
three years and seven months in the U.S. 
Army Air Forces. Ed logged 375 hours in the 
Royal Canadian Air Force and 825 hours in 
the U.S. Army Air Forces for a total of 1,200 
hours. Ed logged flight time in a total of 45 in-
dividual aircraft. 
Ed’s love of aviation was not about to end. 
He became a member of the EAA (Experi-
mental Aircraft Association) and built and flew 
his homebuilt Mustang II. 
I ask you and my other distinguished col-
leagues to join me in saluting the legacy of a 
very accomplished WWII combat pilot and in-
structor, Edward J. Tracey.

HONORING BRUCE JOHNSON 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the outstanding achievements of 
Bruce Johnson, who will retire on December 
31, 2020, after 44 years as a distinguished tel-
evision news anchor and reporter. I have 
worked with Bruce Johnson ever since being 
elected to Congress and will miss his heavy 
hitting questions and incisive reporting. 
Bruce Johnson has won 22 Emmys, is a 
member of the Society of Professional Jour-
nalists Hall of Fame, the Washington, DC Hall 
of Fame and will soon be inducted into the 
Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky. He has also received the 
Ted Yates Award and the NATAS Board of 
Governors Award and is a member of the Na-
tional Association of Black Journalists and the 
National Press Club. 
Throughout his career with WUSA9, a CBS 
affiliate in the District of Columbia, Bruce 
Johnson has reported on stories ranging from 
local D.C. news to federal matters, from the 
local real estate market to government shut-
downs and from D.C.’s mistreatment in the 
CARES Act to violence on the streets of D.C. 
During Johnson’s distinguished career, he has 
shed light on difficult topics for his audience in 
D.C. and across the nation. 
Bruce Johnson’s career took him from his 
hometown of Louisville, Kentucky to places as 
far away as Rome, Bangkok, Dakar and 
Tokyo on special assignments for WUSA9. 
Even before the international chapter of his 
career, Johnson made a name for himself in 
D.C. by reporting on notable stories, including 
the 1982 Metro train derailment and the 1977 
Hanafi Siege, in which 142 people were held 
hostage by 12 gunmen leading to the deaths 
of two individuals. 
Bruce Johnson endured a difficult blow from 
a heart attack in 1992 while on assignment in 
Southeast D.C. His journey back to health in-
cluded completing the Marine Corps Mara-
thon. In 2018, he was dealt a second blow 
when he was diagnosed with cancer. He re-
sponded to these illnesses as a true reporter, 
taking Americans along with him to help pro-
vide clarity on difficult experiences. Johnson 
stayed true to his honest reporting even when 
he became the story. He is the author of two 
books. The first, entitled Heart to Heart, was 
inspired by his heart attack, and the second, 
All or Nothing, was an expose´ on the life of 
D.C. basketball player Victor Page. 
I have known Bruce my entire career, and 
I had hoped that he would remain at Channel 
9 as long as I remained in Congress. Bruce 
commented once during an interview that he 
covered my first congressional campaign. 
Having been on his show many times to dis-
cuss issues that affect D.C. residents, I have 
grown to consider Bruce a friend. He has 
helped tell the story of D.C. ’s challenges and 
triumphs and lent his platform and voice to the 
fight for congressional equality for the District. 
Bruce’s demeanor and his down-to-earth, 
relatable storytelling will be missed on the air 
as he goes on to pursue other accomplish-
ments in the next chapter of his life. I ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Bruce Johnson for his distinguished ca-
reer in journalism. I wish him the very best in 
the years to come.

LORRAINE KNUTH’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I am 
most proud today to rise today to recognize 
Ms. Lorraine Knuth, a long-time resident of 
Waukegan, Illinois, who will celebrate her 
100th birthday on October 31. 
I first met Lorraine through Mary Carmody 
at Midwest Veterans Closet where she has 
volunteered for many years. In honor of her 
centenary year, Lorraine has asked for dona-
tions to be made to Midwest Veterans Closet 
to help her construct a new building and ex-
pand their service capacity to our men and 
women veterans in the area. 
To mark her lifetime of service, I wish to 
share Lorraine’s life story today, for it clearly 
embodies so much of the opportunity, perse-
verance, and sacrifice that makes her and our 
nation so special. 
Lorraine was born on October 31, 1920, in 
Langlade, Wisconsin, the seventh of nine chil-
dren. She excelled in school, entering high 
school a year early. During the Second World 
War, Lorraine enlisted in the U.S. Army as 
part of the Women’s Army Corps. After basic 
training at Daytona Beach, Florida, she head-
ed west to Camp Stoneman in northern Cali-
fornia. She served there until the war ended, 
working in the camp hospital as a Special Diet 
Cook. 
After the war, Lorraine met her husband and 
travelled the world through his military service. 
She decided to move to Waukegan after vis-
iting her late sister, who was already living in 
the area. She has lived in the same house for

more than sixty years, where she raised her 
three sons. Today, Lorraine is both a proud 
grandmother and great-grandmother. 
Lorraine is a longtime volunteer with Mid-
west Veterans Closet, and now serves as the 
organization’s Chair. Midwest Veterans Closet 
provides food, clothing, and other household 
items for veterans of all ages in the local area, 
all free of charge. Employment and housing 
assistance are also offered at no expense as 
well. 
In addition to her incredible work at Midwest 
Veterans Closet, in 2017, Lorraine was just 
the fourth woman veteran to participate the 
Lake County Honor Flight trip to Washington, 
D.C. In 2019, she was one of a select group 
of women veterans to be honored by the 
James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center 
Annual Women Veterans Lunch. 
I 
wholeheartedly 
congratulate 
Lorraine 
Knuth on her 100th birthday and thank her for 
her service to our community and nation.

RECOGNIZING THE REPUBLIC OF 
ARTSAKH 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise be-
cause for more than four weeks, Azerbaijan 
and Turkey have been waging war on Artsakh, 
bombarding civilians, churches, and commit-
ting possible war crimes. More than 800 sol-
diers have been killed repelling Azerbaijan’s 
attacks, and dozens of civilians are dead. Esti-
mates are that more than half of the civilian 
population of Artsakh has been displaced, 
sleeping in cars or open fields away from fall-
ing bombs, as winter approaches. 
For decades, through the OSCE Minsk 
Group, the United States has supported a 
peaceful, democratic, and negotiated resolu-
tion to the dispute surrounding Nagorno 
Karabakh, or Artsakh. We have persisted in 
this policy even as Azerbaijan launched count-
less assaults and as their leadership fre-
quently threatened war to redraw the line of 
contact by force, and as they rejected moni-
toring along the line of contact. 
Today, it appears that Azerbaijan and Tur-
key are determined to make good on their 
threats. With bombs, and drones, and Syrian 
mercenaries, Turkey and Azerbaijan are push-
ing ahead with a war that has no end in sight. 
The Armenian people are the grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren of the genocide per-
petrated a century ago by the Ottoman Em-
pire, and the words and deeds of Erdogan and 
Aliyev today call to mind the crimes of one 
hundred years ago. 
We cannot allow history to repeat itself. If 
Azerbaijan and Turkey have determined to 
wage war, the United States, the Minsk 
Group, 
and 
the 
International 
Community 
should make clear that they will not succeed 
in their aims. 
And that if they persist in this violence, we 
must recognize the Republic of Artsakh as an 
independent nation. Doing so would send the 
strongest possible message that we will not 
allow border disputes to be settled by the in-
discriminate and devastating use of force 
against civilian populations. 
Aliyev and Erdogan must be made to under-
stand that if they continue with this war, there 
will be consequences. The United States will 
not stand idly by.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF MR. GENE MOR-
GAN 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today on behalf of Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District, the Kansas 
City community, and the Jackson County 
Democratic Committee. I rise today to honor 
the memory of Mr. Gene Morgan, a lifelong 
Kansas Citian whose dedication to serving 
others will have an enduring impact through-
out our community. 
Scripture says, in 2 Corinthians 9:7, that 
each of us ‘‘must give as he has decided in 
his heart, for God loves a cheerful giver.’’ 
There is no doubt Gene was a cheerful giver 
of his time, energy, and intellect. Gene made 
it a lifelong goal to work on achieving criminal 
justice reform in Kansas City. After seeing 
how substance abuse impacted children in the 
juvenile court system, he was elected Presi-
dent of the Kansas City Community Center. 
Fueled by his unwavering belief that people 
could change for the better and improve their 
lives when given the opportunity, Gene pro-
moted drug rehabilitation and treatment serv-
ices throughout his tenure. As an Adjunct Pro-
fessor in the Criminal Justice Department at 
the Metropolitan Community College, he 
mentored the next generation of advocates 
and prepared them to engage our community 
in discussions on crime prevention and justice 
reform. As a member of the Jackson County 
Community Backed Anti-Crime Tax (COM-
BAT) Commission, he worked tirelessly to en-
sure Kansas City residents could live free from 
the dangers of illegal drugs and violent crime 
through the use of prevention, education and 
treatment services. And as the Parliamen-
tarian and Ward 4 Committeeman for the 
Jackson County Democratic Committee, he 
whole-heartedly supported candidates and 
elected officials dedicated to reforming a sys-
tem that incarcerates too many and rehabili-
tates too few—costing us too much money 
and too many lives. 
Public service has long been a family affair 
for Gene and his wife, Judy, who currently 
serves as the State Representative for the 
24th district in Jackson County. During fifty 
years of fruitful and devoted marriage, Gene 
cheered Judy on as she taught and counseled 
students in the Kansas City Public School Dis-
trict. When Judy decided the best way to con-
tinue serving others was through elected of-
fice, Gene served as her campaign manager 
and treasurer, always by her side lending his 
steadfast support. 
While he was an active participant in poli-
tics, attending countless community events 
and helping elect candidates across our city 
and state, Gene never lost sight of the central 
reason he decided to dedicate his life to public 
service. It was the same reason—the same 
motivational force—that drove him out of bed 
every morning with the verve and optimism to 
find success in the face of adversity. That rea-
son, as anyone who knew him will tell you, 
was his enduring love for the people he 
served. When working the room at a com-
mittee meeting or greeting guests at a fund-
raiser, he always took an extra moment with 
each person to ask them questions about their 
personal lives. He asked these questions not 
to pry or feign sincerity, but because his pas-
sion for service was fueled by an unwavering 
desire to empathize and help people rise 
above the adversity in their lives. If Gene 
heard you were struggling or facing a problem, 
he was the first to lend a helping hand and a 
shoulder to lean on. After learning of his 
death, countless friends, family, and col-
leagues came together to share anecdotes 
about how Gene had positively impacted their 
lives. A common thread, woven through each 
person’s happy memory of Gene, was his 
presence in their lives as a ‘‘true friend.’’ This 
is a title earned through years of continuously 
looking out for others. 
Back in May, Judy was on her way back 
from Jefferson City after honorably rep-
resenting her constituents when she received 
the phone call that too many families are fa-
miliar with, especially during the on-going pub-
lic health crisis. Gene was experiencing pain 
and on his way to the Emergency Room. Judy 
was able to visit with him for a brief period of 
time, before leaving pursuant to COVID–19 
precautions. When informing supporters and 
friends of his condition, Judy explained that 
while she was physically unable to be with 
him, her ‘‘thoughts [were] only with Gene.’’ 
Judy spent the next five months as she had 
spent the previous fifty years—providing un-
conditional love and care for Gene. Sadly, his 
condition worsened until October 9th, when 
his brave battle with cancer came to an end. 
While we mourn Gene’s death, we find solace 
knowing that in the waning months of a life 
well-lived he was never alone, as his beloved 
partner in life and in service was with him in 
person and spirit until his final moments. 
Today, the thoughts of Kansas City, the 
Metropolitan Community College, and the 
Jackson County Democratic Committee are 
with Judy, their daughter Courtney, their son- 
in-law Robert, and their grandchildren Alex 
and Olivia, as they celebrate and remember 
the life and legacy of Gene Morgan. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in honoring Gene’s 
legacy and offering heartfelt condolences to 
his family. In his passing, Gene leaves behind 
a family that is more cohesive because of his 
contribution, a city that is stronger because of 
his service, and a union that is more perfect 
because of his presence.

GLOBAL WILDLIFE TRADE 
BIOSECURITY ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Global Wild-
life Trade Biosecurity Act, a bill that would cre-
ate a diplomatic global effort to ban the sale 
of live and fresh wildlife for human consump-
tion. This policy, and the authorization of cor-
responding programs, would reduce risk and 
increase research of zoonotic diseases, sup-
port reduction of wildlife trafficking, and ex-
pand programs that aim to close wildlife mar-
kets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E986 
October 23, 2020 
This bill also authorizes programs to ad-
dress the demand for live and fresh wildlife for 
human consumption by improving nutritional 
choices and outcomes while protecting critical 
wildlife areas. 
A Whole of Government approach that em-
braces a One Health model is critical to ensur-
ing that we are much better prepared for an-
other zoonotic disease like COVID–19, that we 
understand its risks, and that we can mitigate 
spread from animals to humans. 
My 
legislation 
would create a Global 
Zoonotic Disease Task Force, would require a 
multi-sectoral strategy from USA ID to reduce 
the demand for wildlife consumption through 
food security interventions, and authorizes an 
integrated zoonotic disease program to re-
search, conduct surveillance of priority and un-
known diseases, and prevent spillover through 
behavioral changes. 
I am thrilled to be joined in leading this bill 
with my colleague on the State and Foreign 
Operations 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, 
Congressman JEFF FORTENBERRY. I urge the 
House of Representatives to join me in pass-
ing this important legislation.

HONORING 
ALAN 
TURING 
AS 
A 
DISTINGUISHED 
MATHEMATI-
CIAN AND HERO 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Alan Turing 
was a brilliant English mathematician, founder 
of modern computer science and a World War 
II hero. 
His contributions during the war, especially 
his work alongside others in cryptography, 
were hailed as ‘priceless’ by our own Presi-
dent Eisenhower. By breaking German mili-
tary-codes, Turing helped to quickly win the 
Battle of the Atlantic, without which the Allies 
may not have been able to launch D-Day in 
1944. His efforts helped to shorten the war, 
possibly by years, saving incalculable human 
life. 
Even today, our lives are impacted by his 
work. Turing is credited with creating the 
modem computer concept and helping to 
found computer science by theorizing a pro-
grammable machine capable of computing 
anything computable. 
Yet Turing was more than just a mathemati-
cian, an inventor or a hero. Turing was a gay 
man. Because he was gay, he faced persecu-
tion for merely being who he was. In 1952, 
just seven years after he had helped defeat 
the Nazis, he was prosecuted for being in a 
gay relationship and forced to undergo chem-
ical castration to avoid prison. 
Two years later, in 1954, he died, possibly 
by suicide. He was only 41. 
Turing’s life is a reminder of how brilliant 
anyone could be, no matter what the world 
perceived them or of whom they loved. His life 
also serves as a reminder of the harm and 
costs that accompany discrimination and prej-
udice. We will never know what else Alan 
Turing might have discovered had he been ac-
cepted, and what he might have accomplished 
had his life not been cut so short. We do know 
that the world owes him a great deal of grati-
tude, and for that, we honor him for LGBTQ 
History Month.

RECOGNIZING PROFESSORS PAUL 
R. 
MILGROM 
AND 
ROBERT 
B. 
WILSON, 
LAURATES 
OF 
THE 
NOBEL 
PRIZE 
IN 
ECONOMIC 
SCIENCES 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 23, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring two of my dis-
tinguished constituents who are this year’s re-
cipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Eco-
nomic Sciences, Stanford University Profes-
sors Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson. 
The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic 
Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, more 
commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Eco-
nomics, is given by the Royal Swedish Acad-
emy of Sciences in Stockholm and was estab-
lished in 1968, joining the five original prizes 
established by Alfred Nobel in his 1895 will. 
Professors Milgrom and Wilson are being 
honored for their extraordinary contributions to 
the field of economics in game theory, specifi-
cally for ‘‘improvements to auction theory and 
inventions of new auction formats.’’ They are 
best known for developing the simultaneous 
ascending auction in 1994 for the Federal 
Communications Commission to better allo-
cate licenses for the public’s airwaves (also 
known as spectrum). Since then, spectrum 
auctions have generated over $100 billion for 
the U.S. Treasury and expanded connectivity 
for millions of Americans. Their contributions 
to auction theory have implications in a broad 
range of subjects beyond spectrum allocation, 
including real-time bidding for internet ad de-
livery, fishing quotas, and the renewable en-
ergy market. 
Both professors have had distinguished ca-
reers. Professor Milgrom is the Shirley and 
Leonard Ely Professor of Humanities and 
Sciences in the Department of Economics at 
Stanford University, and he is a Professor, by 
courtesy, at both the Department of Manage-
ment Science and Engineering and the Grad-
uate School of Business. He is also a member 
of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow 
of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, and Senior Fellow at the Stanford 
Institute for Economic Policy Research. Pro-
fessor Milgrom holds a Bachelor’s degree from 
the University of Michigan, and earned a Mas-
ter’s and Doctorate degree from Stanford. 
Professor Wilson is the Adams Distin-
guished Professor of Management, Emeritus, 
at the Stanford Business School. He is also a 
member of the National Academy of Sciences 
and a Fellow and Council Member of the 
Econometric Society. He earned a Bachelor’s, 
Master’s, and Doctorate degrees from Har-
vard, and he has received honorary degrees 
from the University of Chicago and the Nor-
wegian School of Economics. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House to 
join me in congratulating Paul R. Milgrom and 
Robert B. Wilson on receiving this most pres-
tigious award, recognizing their contribution to 
the design of pioneering auctions that have 
impacted economic practices around the 
world. It’s my privilege to represent them, pay 
tribute to their brilliance, and thank them for 
making every American exceedingly proud of 
their accomplishments.
