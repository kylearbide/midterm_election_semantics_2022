PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of the universe, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
For 2 weeks now our Nation is 
marked by ongoing marches and dem-
onstrations. They give testimony to 
our constitutional right and value to 
petition government for change. Local 
governments and States are activated 
to respond to these gatherings, as trou-
bling as they might threaten to be. 
Please 
inspire 
those 
who 
dem-
onstrate, and those who respond, to 
proceed with wisdom, patience, and de-
termination toward forming a more 
perfect union, whose imperfections are 
in high relief. Lord, have mercy. 
Help us as one Nation to confront and 
bring to an end the curse and effects of 
racism. May access to the vote be ex-
panded, empowering and giving voice 
to all citizens so that taking to the 
streets is not needed, and passions can 
be cooled. 
May all those who labor to reform 
policing in our Nation, and who would 
benefit from reform, police depart-
ments and citizens alike, be blessed by 
You, O Lord, with great insight and 
practical sense. May we all move to-
ward a more common weal and sense of 
shared ownership of our communities. 
Bless us all this day, and every day, 
and may all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 15, 2020 
No. 110 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our righteousness, as each 
new day seems to bring the unexpected, 
we thank You for Your power that 
keeps us from stumbling on life’s road. 
Today, give our lawmakers the wis-
dom to find in You their refuge and 
strength. Lord, as they face complex 
challenges, may they plead to You for 
guidance and fellowship. Remind them 
that in the multitude of counselors, 
there is safety. May our Senators plant 
seeds of righteousness in order to reap 
our harvest of goodness and grace. May 
they make You the foundation of their 
hope and joy, as You empower them to 
meet every trial without weariness. 
Lord, have mercy upon the loved 
ones of Rayshard Brooks and the many 
others who are buffeted by the winds of 
despair. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY.) The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
WORLD FOOD PRIZE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
time of year for the last roughly 30 
years, the World Food Prize has an-
nounced a laureate. The laureate an-
nounced this year is Dr. Rattan Lal. He 
will receive the prize for his work on 
soil health at the annual ceremony 
that has taken place in Des Moines for 
the last 30 years in October. 
Often called the Nobel Prize for Agri-
culture, the World Food Prize is award-
ed for exceptional achievements that 
advance human development by in-
creasing the quantity, quality, avail-
ability of, or access to food. The award 
was created by Iowan Dr. Norman 
Borlaug, who is credited with saving 
more lives than any other person who 
ever lived through his pioneering work 
in developing new, more productive 
plant varieties and particularly plant 
varieties free of disease. The Green 
Revolution sparked by Dr. Borlaug 
made it possible for India to feed its 
people. 
Dr. Lal, also from India, is being rec-
ognized for his work, which will be of 
interest to Iowans and others around 
the world. Dr. Lal said: 
Achieving hunger-free humanity, soil deg-
radation neutrality, negative emission farm-
ing, and pollutant-free water are among 
principal challenges which can never be ig-
nored. . . . Sustainable management of soil 
and agriculture is also essential to keeping 
global temperatures within the safe range 
and restoring the environment. 
If people want to know who Dr. 
Borlaug is, he is one of the two statues 
that Iowa has put in Statuary Hall. He 
is one of five people in our country who 
have received a Nobel Peace Prize, the 
Congressional Gold Medal, and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 3 
months ago, States were implementing 
stay-at-home orders as the coronavirus 
spread throughout our country. Three 
months ago, George Floyd was still 
alive, and the killing of Breonna Tay-
lor in Louisville had just begun to re-
ignite a national discussion around po-
licing. 
Our country has confronted what 
feels like several years’ worth of up-
heaval in just 3 months. Small busi-
nesses and childcare centers are trying 
to figure out how to safely reopen. 
Schools and universities are trying to 
plan for the fall. Healthcare profes-
sionals and essential workers are con-
tinuing 
to 
man 
their 
posts, 
help 
strangers, and keep our country going. 
Peaceful protesters have continued to 
express outrage over the killings of 
Black Americans, and our Nation’s po-
lice officers—overwhelmingly good, de-
cent, and brave people who put every-
thing on the line for their neighbors— 
have continued to faithfully serve 
under trying circumstances. 
These are the kinds of challenges our 
Nation should meet with unity, like 
when the Senate wrote and passed the 
historic CARES Act unanimously in 
March. But unfortunately, in some cor-
ners of the country, our Nation’s stra-
tegic reserve of sanity appears to have 
run a little low. We have seen peaceful 
protests hijacked by violent riots. Ap-
parently, rioters thought the best way 
to argue against a strong police force 
was to terrorize innocent people and 
small businesses for nights on end. 
Then, completing the absurd cycle, 
we have seen the far left hold up these 
riots as proof that we should defund or 
disband the police in this country—as 
though the vast majority of Americans 
in the country would not interpret the 
anarchy in precisely the opposite way. 
As I noted last week, we have seen 
some big-city mayors use health re-
strictions to construct constitutionally 
dubious double standards, where mas-
sive protests are blessed and encour-
aged, but small, careful church services 
are still banned. In Seattle, we have

seen the local officials cede several 
blocks to a rag-tag band of demonstra-
tors who call themselves the Capitol 
Hill Autonomous Zone. Fear of the far 
left has literally caused local officials 
to let a chunk of their own city devolve 
into a no-go zone for their own cops. 
Naturally, left-leaning media outlets 
have been quick to shower praise on 
this legacy and slow to amplify reports 
of arson and other unchecked crimes. 
One story from the New York Times 
praised the ‘‘liberated streets’’—liber-
ated, as if spray-painting a boarded-up 
business were the equivalent of the 
Normandy landings. 
Amid all this, our Democratic coun-
terparts in the House of Representa-
tives have mostly continued to keep 
their doors locked and their lights off. 
But here in the Senate, we came back 
in over a month ago. We have taken 
smart precautions, but we have not let 
the people’s business come to a halt. 
Our committees have been overseeing 
the CARES Act and working on other 
essential business, like the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
Our colleagues are considering what 
else might help the country reopen, 
like 
strong 
legal 
protections 
for 
schools, 
colleges, 
employers, 
and 
healthcare workers. 
Under the leadership of Senator TIM 
SCOTT, our conference is developing a 
serious proposal to reform law enforce-
ment in smart ways without lashing 
out needlessly and counterproductively 
at the first responders who are a credit 
to their communities. 
f 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, just 
this week, on the floor, we will com-
plete a major piece of legislation that 
will 
benefit 
generations 
to 
come. 
Thanks to a number of our colleagues— 
particularly the junior Senators from 
Colorado and Montana—the Senate is 
poised to take historic action for the 
future of the Nation’s public lands. 
I haven’t been the only one coming 
to the floor to highlight how my con-
stituents prize our State’s national 
parks, wildlife refuge, and other man-
aged areas—for recreation and for 
many livelihoods. We Kentuckians are 
proud that our Commonwealth is home 
to one of the National Park Service’s 
crowning jewels at Mammoth Cave. We 
are proud of our historic sites like Mill 
Springs Battlefield and our wildlife ref-
uges at the Clarks and Green Rivers. 
And I am proud that the Senate this 
week will provide permanent, steady 
support to maintain these treasures for 
generations to come. 
As we have heard, the same is true 
for Colorado, where entire regional 
economies are driven by outdoor recre-
ation in alpine wonderlands; for Mon-
tana, where Federal and State manage-
ment work hand in hand with local 
sportsmen and Native American Tribes 
to preserve millions of acres of pris-
tine, Big Sky wilderness; for West Vir-
ginia, where 54 of 55 counties have ben-
efited from the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund investment; and for 
Ohio, where the Cuyahoga Valley puts 
parkland in the backyards of millions 
of people. The list goes on and on. 
Public lands hold a unique place in 
the life of every State in America— 
from their natural beauty, to their use 
for recreation, to their pivotal roles in 
local economies. In the communities 
just outside of the gates, public lands 
drive over $40 billion in economic ac-
tivity every year, and they play a big 
part in the entire outdoor recreation 
industry that creates hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in national prosperity 
every year. 
Once again, I am grateful to our col-
leagues who have stewarded the Great 
American Outdoors Act thus far; to 
Senator GARDNER and Senator DAINES 
for their leadership; and to Senators 
ALEXANDER, PORTMAN, MANCHIN, and 
WARNER for their efforts as well to 
steer this strong, bipartisan product 
toward the finish line. I look forward 
to continuing to advance this legisla-
tion today and passing it this week.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of H.R. 1957, which 
the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1957) to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to modernize and im-
prove the Internal Revenue Service, and for 
other purposes. 
Pending: 
McConnell (for Gardner) amendment No. 
1617, in the nature of a substitute. 
McConnell amendment No. 1626 (to amend-
ment No. 1617), to change the enactment 
date. 
McConnell amendment No. 1627 (to amend-
ment No. 1626), of a perfecting nature. 
McConnell Amendment No. 1628 (to the 
language proposed to be stricken by amend-
ment No. 1617), to change the enactment 
date. 
McConnell amendment No. 1629 (to amend-
ment No. 1628), of a perfecting nature. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
morning, the long march for equality 
for LGBTQ Americans took a step for-
ward. The Supreme Court handed down 
a landmark decision that Federal em-
ployment discrimination protections 
do, in fact, extend to LGBTQ Ameri-
cans. Believe it or not, before today, it 
was not a settled legal matter that you 
could sue your employer for firing you 
solely on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion or sexual identity. 
In 2020, in America, it was still OK to 
discriminate against people because of 
their sexual orientation or identity. Is 
that unbelievable that in the 21st cen-
tury it was still allowed? Well, now it 
isn’t because of the Supreme Court, 
and they deserve credit for that case. 
One of the cases that formed the 
basis of today’s ruling originated in my 
home State of New York, where a sky-
diving instructor was fired for admit-
ting his sexual orientation. So, today, 
the Supreme Court did the right thing 
and ruled that workplace discrimina-
tion on the basis of sexual orientation 
is just as unlawful as discrimination on 
the basis of gender, race, or religion. 
Of course, the ruling in no way di-
minishes our efforts here in Congress 
to pass the Equality Act led by my col-
leagues, Senators MERKLEY, BALDWIN, 
and BOOKER, which would be a great 
leap forward on equality that we are 
all looking for. It passed the House 
over a year ago, but it has been gath-
ering dust in Leader MCCONNELL’s leg-
islative graveyard. Senate Republicans 
are still not in the 21st century. They 
must think it is OK to discriminate 
against people because of their orienta-
tion or identity. Unbelievable. But 
maybe now, the fact that even a few 
Justices 
appointed 
by 
Republican 
Presidents believe that it was against 
the law—maybe that will prick the 
hearts of our Republican colleagues 
and Leader MCCONNELL and they will 
allow a vote on the Equality Act here 
on the floor. Even without the Senate 
and its backward ways, it is clear that 
the country is moving in the right di-
rection. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. President, these are not ordinary 
times in America. For 21 straight days, 
hundreds of thousands of Americans 
have taken to the streets to protest po-
lice 
violence 
and 
racial 
injustice. 
Clashes between police and peaceful 
protesters over the past few weeks, in 
which some police departments have 
responded with overly aggressive tac-
tics, have only articulated further the 
need for bold and wide-reaching reform 
of police practices. 
Being killed by police is now the 
sixth leading cause of death for young 
Black men in America. Let me repeat 
that. Being killed by police is now the 
sixth leading cause of death for young 
Black men in America, and that is why 
the House and Senate have drafted leg-
islation, the Justice in Policing Act,

that will deliver comprehensive reform 
to police departments, including a ban 
on choke holds, a ban on no-knock war-
rants in Federal drug cases, a ban on 
racial profiling, and limits on the 
transfer of military equipment to po-
lice departments. Our bill would make 
it a lot easier to hold police account-
able in court for misconduct and insti-
tute several reforms to prevent that 
misconduct in the first place. 
Only a few months ago, the Justice 
in Policing Act might have seemed 
controversial, but in the wake of such 
obvious injustice recorded on iPhones 
throughout the country, there is now 
broad and deep support for the policies 
we Democrats are pushing in the Jus-
tice in Policing Act. 
A recent Reuters poll reported—lis-
ten to this—82 percent of Americans, 
including 7 in 10 Republicans, want to 
ban police from using choke holds; 83 
percent of Americans, including 7 in 10 
Republicans, 
want 
to 
ban 
racial 
profiling; 92 percent of Americans, in-
cluding 9 in 10 Republicans, want Fed-
eral police to wear body cameras; 91 
percent of Americans, including 9 in 10 
Republicans, support allowing inde-
pendent investigations of police de-
partments that show patterns of mis-
conduct; and 75 percent of Americans, 
including 6 in 10 Republicans, support 
allowing victims of police misconduct 
to sue police departments for damages, 
also known as qualified immunity re-
form. 
Now is the time to seek bold and 
broadscale change, not change around 
the margins. Now is the time for 
wholesale reform, not piecemeal re-
form. The Justice in Policing Act takes 
a comprehensive approach, but, at the 
moment, our Republican colleagues 
seem to be on a path toward taking a 
much, much narrower, less inclusive 
approach. That is wrong. 
Some Senate Republicans have en-
dorsed individual proposals in our bill, 
like qualified immunity reform and 
bans on choke holds, but it looks like 
these policies may not be included in 
the Republican bill. While our bill rec-
ognizes that a strong Federal response 
is necessary to bring change to every 
police department in America, the Re-
publicans, it seems, are going to leave 
much of the task up to the States. If 
history has taught us anything, par-
ticularly when it comes to civil rights, 
it is that progress on civil rights has 
been stunted, slowed down, and some-
times stymied by letting the States 
take the lead. 
Let me repeat to my Republican col-
leagues: We need comprehensive and 
bold reform, and we need a commit-
ment from the Republican leader to 
consider broad, strong police reform— 
the Justice in Policing Act—on the 
floor of the Senate before July 4. 
Again, I ask our Republican leader— 
I have asked before: Allow the Justice 
in Policing Act to be on the floor. We 
can debate it. We can amend it. Some 
of you may not vote for it, but the Na-
tion is crying out for debate on a com-
prehensive and strong approach, not to 
cherry-pick one or two items and say 
‘‘See, we have done our job’’ and go 
home. 
This has been a pervasive and deep 
problem in America for decades and 
centuries. To now give it short shift 
and to try and get off the hook would 
be so wrong at the moment when 
Americans are calling for it. The vast 
majority of Republican voters are call-
ing for it. Do we have any courage here 
or any strength to face the issue head- 
on at a time and at a moment when we 
can do it? I hope our Republican 
friends will summon that courage, that 
strength, and that desire to bring real, 
strong, and comprehensive reform. The 
time for waiting is over. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, meanwhile, a global 
pandemic continues to assail our coun-
try and our economy. The COVID–19 
pandemic did not disappear while the 
Nation rightfully turned its attention 
to the issues of racial justice. In fact, 
just as the country was preparing for 
the early stages of reopening, the num-
ber of cases began to spike again in a 
number of States. 
Arizona 
has 
activated 
emergency 
plans to deal with the surge of new pa-
tients. Over the weekend, Florida re-
ported its highest single-day number of 
cases. Twenty-two States are reporting 
increases in the numbers of confirmed 
cases of coronavirus after those num-
bers had been declining. The experts 
tell us that it is not simply because 
there is more testing. There is also 
more coronavirus in many of these 
States. 
A headline in Time magazine sums it 
up: ‘‘America Is Done With COVID–19. 
COVID–19 Isn’t Done With America.’’ It 
is our responsibility to deal with this 
problem. The trends are extremely con-
cerning. 
I have asked the White House to have 
members of the coronavirus task force, 
including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, give 
Senate Democrats a briefing on these 
recent spikes. I have yet to hear back. 
The White House continues to muzzle 
the most knowledgeable people. 
President 
Trump, 
haven’t 
you 
learned that when you don’t face the 
truth, it hurts the country and hurts 
you? You tried to deny that this 
coronavirus was real—it was a hoax; it 
will go away in a few days; there are 
very few cases—and, of course, it rav-
aged our country. 
Now they are doing the same thing. 
President Trump is doing exactly the 
same thing—withholding the experts 
and withholding the truth in hopes 
that things will disappear. That is just 
not how science tells us things work. 
President Trump now seems ready to 
dismiss these issues entirely. It is ap-
palling. He is planning big campaign 
rallies, asking reporters, amazingly, to 
sign waivers not to sue if they contract 
COVID from attending. I guess he wor-
ries that they might get it, but he 
doesn’t care. He wants to have his 
rally. That is the superficiality of this 
President. 
President Trump has also moved 
major parts of the Republican conven-
tion out of North Carolina in order to 
avoid having to respect the most basic 
precautions 
against 
the 
spread 
of 
coronavirus. 
Today, amazingly enough, the FDA 
withdrew the emergency authorization 
of the use of hydroxychloroquine as a 
treatment against COVID. Remember 
how the President of the United States, 
only a few weeks ago, was promoting 
the use of hydroxychloroquine like a 
pharmaceutical salesman, going so far 
as to take the drug himself despite not 
having the disease? Now the FDA says 
that it is not reasonable to believe the 
drug is effective against COVID or that 
its benefit outweighs the ‘‘known and 
potential risks.’’ That is the Presi-
dent’s own department telling him to 
stop it—to stop telling Americans lies 
about the coronavirus and about what 
is good and bad to treat it. It is amaz-
ing. An agency like this one, which 
knows they are not supposed to buck 
the President or face his wrath, still 
felt the obligation to come forward and 
tell 
Americans 
the 
truth 
about 
hydroxychloroquine. 
This should be a warning to all 
Americans. You can’t listen to Presi-
dent 
Trump 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
healthcare, 
whether 
it 
comes 
to 
hydroxychloroquine or anything about 
the coronavirus itself, because the ex-
perts in his own administration so 
often 
contradict 
his 
advice. 
It 
shouldn’t need saying that the Presi-
dent is not a doctor, yet he has been 
issuing 
off-the-cuff 
medical 
advice 
from the White House podium only to 
have the experts scrambling to back-
track weeks later. This is not how a 
leader handles a crisis. This is not even 
how a normal person handles a crisis. 
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have 
relegated the COVID issue to the back 
burner. As the expiration dates for sev-
eral of the programs established under 
the CARES Act quickly approach, 
Leader MCCONNELL has reportedly told 
his caucus not to expect another emer-
gency relief bill until the end of July. 
The emergency unemployment insur-
ance we passed in the CARES Act is 
soon going to run out. The ban on evic-
tions is soon going to expire. State and 
local governments are preparing to 
slash public services and are in dire 
need of Federal support. Cliff after cliff 
after cliff faces us. Economic trouble 
after economic trouble after economic 
trouble is looming upon us very soon. 
Yet all of these problems and all of 
these deadlines seem to mean very lit-
tle to the Republican Senate majority, 
which is taking its sweet time to re-
spond to an urgent and multifaceted 
national crisis. 
What are our Republican friends 
going to tell people whose unemploy-
ment insurance runs out? Tough luck? 
What are our Republican friends going 
to 
tell 
people 
evicted 
from 
their 
homes? Too bad? What are our Repub-
lican friends going to tell the many 
public servants fired because their

States are running out of money and 
we have refused to step up to the plate? 
What are they going to tell the Na-
tion’s parents when schools will not be 
able to open because we haven’t given 
them adequate resources to do so? 
We are going to tell them that the 
Republican majority is asleep at the 
switch during a major national crisis, 
but that will be of little solace. We 
would much rather work together and 
get things done. 
Even on bedrock issues of democracy 
elections, the Republican majority has 
once again been absent. The COVID 
pandemic has made our elections a 
challenge, obviously. In Nevada, South 
Carolina, Wisconsin, and, most re-
cently and most glaringly in Georgia, 
voters have had to overcome signifi-
cant barriers to voting. Senators KLO-
BUCHAR, FEINSTEIN, and PETERS have 
been demanding that Republican chairs 
of their respective committees hold 
hearings on these election issues. That 
would be the bare minimum the Senate 
could do in response to widespread 
election issues. 
Police reform, racial injustice, vot-
ing rights, a global pandemic, massive 
levels 
of 
unemployment—these 
are 
huge issues that demand the attention 
of the U.S. Senate, but Leader MCCON-
NELL and the Republican majority just 
can’t seem to find the time. On issues 
like COVID, racial justice, the econ-
omy, voting, the Republican majority 
is sadly missing in action. 
Instead, Leader MCCONNELL is push-
ing two rightwing judges onto the Na-
tion’s circuit courts: Justin Walker 
and Cory Wilson. 
Mr. Walker is a man of limited judi-
cial experience who has made it very 
clear 
he 
personally 
opposes 
our 
healthcare law. He called the Roberts 
decision to uphold the Affordable Care 
Act indefensible and catastrophic. 
Mr. Wilson, by the same token, called 
our healthcare law illegitimate and 
perverse. That is right, folks. If you 
need healthcare and you are suffering 
because of COVID, well, our Republican 
friends are nominating judges who 
think the law is illegitimate and per-
verse. In the middle of a public health 
crisis, the Republican majority is plan-
ning to confirm rightwing judges who 
oppose our healthcare law. 
Adding insult to injury, Mr. Wilson 
has been one of the leaders in opposing 
and undoing voting rights. Here, at a 
time when people are protesting for ra-
cial equality, the Republican majority 
has the temerity to put on the floor of 
the Senate someone who has spent his 
career trying to limit the rights of peo-
ple, oftentimes minorities, to vote. Mr. 
Wilson has supported restrictive voter 
ID laws and expressed strong opposi-
tion to parts of the Voting Rights Act. 
That is right. In the middle of a na-
tional movement on issues related to 
racial justice, Senate Republicans are 
trying to put a judge on the bench with 
a hostile record on voting rights. 
We all know that when you have the 
Senate majority, it is all about prior-
ities. We are all empowered here on the 
Senate to propose bills and amend-
ments and to ask consent to speak for 
as long as we want, but only Leader 
MCCONNELL gets to decide which bills 
reach the floor, and for the past 2 
months, as the economic pain from the 
coronavirus deepens, as the disease 
starts to come back, as the economy 
runs into trouble after trouble after 
trouble, as long-simmering issues of ra-
cial justice and police brutality propel 
peaceful protesting in our biggest cit-
ies and smallest towns, the Republican 
Senate majority has been out to lunch. 
This week, as Leader MCCONNELL asks 
us to consider more rightwing judges 
for the Federal bench, it could not be 
more apparent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, across 
America, people of all ages, races, and 
backgrounds have continued to show 
up on the streets to speak up and speak 
out against racial injustice. Of course, 
it is their right under the Constitution 
to do so. 
Galvanized by the tragic death of 
George Floyd, they are marching in 
peaceful protests, signing petitions, 
and having frank discussions with their 
families. It is a moment characterized 
by heartbreak and anger over the in-
justices that many Black Americans 
feel are perpetrated on them every day, 
but it is also a time for hope for the fu-
ture as the issue has come front and 
center. Frankly, we have to do some-
thing about it. 
In city halls, State legislatures, and, 
of course, here in the U.S. Capitol, 
there is a newfound sense of energy and 
urgency behind the effort to pass 
meaningful reform. We have an oppor-
tunity to create profound change in an 
area that, for too long, has just been a 
can kicked down the road, and I am op-
timistic we will succeed. 
I told the Floyd family when I talked 
to them before their son, their brother, 
was buried: My hope for you and my 
hope for all of us is that something 
positive will come out of this tragedy. 
Here in the Senate, we are working 
on legislation to respond to these 
events, and the majority leader has 
tasked our friend and colleague from 
South Carolina, Senator TIM SCOTT, to 
lead the effort in our conference. I am 
proud to have been working with him 
closely—and several other colleagues— 
to draft legislation that I think will 
help us begin the first step down that 
path and support America’s police 
forces. 
As we work through potential poli-
cies, it is important to hear feedback 
from my constituents back home, and 
last Friday I had the chance to do just 
that. I reached out to my friend, Dallas 
Mayor Eric Johnson, whom I have got-
ten to know pretty well during his first 
year as mayor. Whether it be Dallas 
tornadoes or the COVID–19 virus or, 
now, discussions about the George 
Floyd killing and racial injustice, we 
have found the opportunity to work to-
gether to support the people of Dallas 
through 
some 
incredibly 
difficult 
times. 
I asked him if he would help me con-
vene a group of leaders in Dallas to dis-
cuss these issues, and by Friday we 
were all socially distancing around a 
large table in city hall in Dallas, TX. 
The mayor and I were joined by Police 
Chief Renee Hall, Dallas County Sher-
iff Marian Brown, Dallas County Dis-
trict Attorney John Creuzot, as well as 
union, community, and faith leaders. 
We had a frank conversation about the 
challenges we are up against as we 
work to repair the broken trust be-
tween law enforcement and some of the 
communities they serve. 
I was able to spend some time talk-
ing about the work we are doing here 
in the Senate and the ideas that could 
be included in any legislation. I talked 
about two specific proposals that I 
have recommended—one being the es-
tablishment of a National Criminal 
Justice Commission. This Commission 
would review the criminal justice sys-
tem from top to bottom and provide 
recommendations 
to 
us, 
something 
that has not happened at the national 
level since 1965. 
I also recommended taking steps to 
ensure more departments and agencies 
are providing deescalation training for 
their officers so, hopefully, officers will 
know how to use these tactics to pre-
vent similar tragedies from occurring 
in the first place. 
But mostly I was there to listen and 
to learn from the men and women with 
decades of experience in protecting, 
serving, and advocating for their com-
munities. 
Chief Hall talked about how policing 
strategies had created a wedge between 
law enforcement and some of the mi-
nority communities and the work it is 
going to take in order to repair that 
trust and eliminate that wedge. She 
noted that Dallas is home to some of 
the best officers in the country and 
that the vast majority of them show up 
for work every day with all of the right 
intentions and attitude, but for the 
small number of officers who don’t, we 
need to be able to identify them quick-
ly and remove them from our police 
forces. 
Thinking about the officer who was 
directly responsible for George Floyd’s 
death, according to published reports, 
he had at least 17 misconduct com-
plaints already lodged against him. 
Now, that should be a red flag for any-
body. 
In any tragedy, you can’t help but go 
through the what-ifs and wonder how 
things might have played out dif-
ferently. What if his supervisors had 
taken action? What if he had been 
fired? What if he hadn’t been available 
to respond to the incident involving 
George Floyd because he was assigned 
to some other duties? 
Well, these are difficult questions to 
ask because the outcome likely would

have been different, but they are the 
types of questions we need to ask in 
order to prevent history from repeating 
itself. 
The major theme of our conversation 
was trust: How do we restore commu-
nities’ trust in law enforcement? Min-
ister Sammie Barry from Dallas West 
Church of Christ made a great point 
about ensuring that police agencies re-
flect the diversity of the communities 
in which they serve. 
Texas is about as diverse a State as 
they come. Our cities are a vibrant 
blend of backgrounds, cultures, and 
skin tones, and our police departments 
should reflect that. 
That is one topic of discussion here 
in the Senate, one I hope we can act on 
in the coming weeks: How do we en-
courage police recruitment of the right 
people who can reflect the commu-
nities in which they serve? 
As Dallas County Sheriff Marian 
Brown said, we all recognize and ac-
knowledge that we have a long way to 
go, and unfortunately there is no 
magic pill to help get us there. Instead, 
we are going to have to roll up our 
sleeves and do the hard work of trying 
to build consensus and solve problems. 
As always, the first step in the proc-
ess is good communication. Honest and 
frank discussions between community 
leaders, law enforcement, and elected 
officials are a great start, but we are 
going to have to do a lot more than 
talk in order to create palpable change. 
I will be the first to admit I don’t 
have all the answers. I don’t think any-
one else does either, but these con-
versations are key to helping each of 
us get closer to finding them. 
I want to thank Mayor Johnson and 
everyone who took time out of their 
busy schedules to participate in our 
discussion last Friday. These men and 
women have provided me with valuable 
insight and ideas about the changes 
that need to be made in order to re-
store public confidence in all of our law 
enforcement agencies. 
I have come back to Washington with 
new ideas based on their feedback, and 
I am eager to continue to work with all 
of our colleagues to deliver real re-
forms for the American people and re-
store that trust which, unfortunately, 
has been strained, if not broken, in 
some communities. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from Washington. 
BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
before I speak about the legislation we 
are going to be voting on shortly, I 
wanted to mention today’s significant 
Supreme Court decision to protect the 
LGBTQ 
community 
and 
Americans 
from discrimination in the workplace. 
This is a very important step for-
ward. Gay and transgender Americans 
should not face discrimination in the 
workplace or live in fear of losing their 
jobs simply because of who they are, 
and it is an important step forward but 
is also long overdue. 
My home State of Washington has 
been a leader on this issue for decades, 
but—just think—until today, June 15, 
2020, we had no nationwide rules 
against firing an employee or harassing 
someone at work for being gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, or trans. That is just wrong, 
and LGBTQ+ Americans still face dis-
crimination in far too many areas of 
life: public accommodations, housing, 
education, and some federally funded 
programs. 
We have proposed legislation that 
would be, I believe, comprehensive civil 
rights and anti-discrimination legisla-
tion to help protect this community. 
The House has passed this legislation, 
and I believe it is time that the Senate 
pass this legislation. 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Repub-
licans should take the Equality Act 
out of the legislative graveyard and get 
it onto the Senate floor. Today I join 
my 
colleagues 
Senators 
MERKLEY, 
BALDWIN, and others who are calling 
for Senate action on this important 
issue. 
Again, I want to emphasize how im-
portant and fundamental I think this 
decision was and how challenging and 
disappointed I am that we have had 
legislation to protect this community 
that we could have passed decades ago. 
H.R. 1957 
Madam President, I also rise to talk 
about the several votes we are going to 
have on public lands coming up, and 
one of them is about a budget point of 
order. 
In my mind, budget points of order 
are about cost. Well, we are here to 
talk about what a good investment 
public land is. 
We have the Grand Canyon. We un-
derstand that. It is a good investment. 
Mt. Rainier, in my home State of 
Washington—a good investment—is an 
iconic mountain, maybe, to some, but 
we in the State of Washington also 
know that it brings in millions of dol-
lars in revenue and millions of visitors. 
That is just what our public lands do: 
They become icons. The preservation of 
the natural world is a good invest-
ment—in my mind, better than roads 
and bridges and buildings—because it 
actually lasts for centuries. Places like 
the Grand Tetons or Denali—which are 
in other States—literally are icons to 
all of us and help us from one genera-
tion to the next. 
Besides being icons, they do pay for 
themselves. That is, the economic re-
turn of public lands is phenomenal. It 
does create, but it generates. It gen-
erates activity that generates income 
to county governments, to State gov-
ernments, and to the Federal Govern-
ment—and lots of private entities are 
involved. 
So hundreds of billions of dollars are 
spent. In fact, $877 billion was part of a 
report that was issued a few years ago. 
You might not think of that right off 
the top of your head because you are 
thinking about some aspect of the out-
doors, and you might not think of it as 
generating dollars, but, OK, try a few 
of the brand names on, whether it is 
REI or The North Face or Columbia 
Sportswear 
Company—or 
just 
your 
local fishing guide who does white-
water rafting or fishing or other out-
door activities. 
These lands are basically generating 
billions of dollars in revenue. So, in my 
mind, the fact that they are receiving 
oil and gas offshore leasing revenue, 
along with getting the benefit of the 
public lands—and generating all of that 
revenue—to me, is very sound fiscal 
policy and a great investment. 
So, to me, the issue isn’t the budget 
point of order as much as it is the ques-
tion of why this program has been 
around for so long and the money 
wasn’t used in the program. Probably 
somewhere around $20 billion has been 
used for other things instead of the in-
tended purpose of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. Maybe it is be-
cause not everybody was on board with 
spending that amount of money for 
public lands, but I think we are here 
today to say there is a new coalition of 
people who are willing to say that, and 
they do see the economic return. 
We are specifically passing a law that 
says that you are going to spend those 
dollars for that and that the other pur-
poses Congress may have decided in the 
past are not the specific purpose but 
that public land is. 
So I am very happy we are making 
this investment that, in my mind, is 
one of the smartest fiscal policies we 
could ever make; that is, to spend 
money not from the taxpayer but from 
these private entities on offshore drill-
ing that goes into something for the 
benefit of the taxpayer and that gen-
erates economic return to all of us. 
I can’t ask for a better tax policy or 
fiscal policy than to use it to preserve 
open space and public land and gen-
erate revenue and help all of us enjoy 
the outdoors. 
As I said, revenue raising from off-
shore leasing and investing in public 
land was exactly what Scoop Jackson 
had in mind when he authored the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
more than 50 years ago, and it is actu-
ally what we should be doing. I am glad 
my colleagues have realized this is the 
right fiscal policy. It is good for us, and 
it is good for America’s future. 
I know that Scoop Jackson would be 
very happy, and I know his son Peter, 
who just passed recently, would also be 
very happy that this correction is 
being made. 
This will be the first time that the 
money is fully used for the intended 
purpose of what the money and revenue 
was put into the fund to do. I am glad 
we are making this milestone happen, 
and I encourage my colleagues to think 
about this fiscal policy. The fiscal pol-
icy that benefits the United States by 
having open space and public lands 
generates $877 billion. 
Yes, if you want another reminder, 
this is a view of downtown Seattle 
from a very famous park, Gas Works 
Park, in the north end of Lake Union.

That park probably wouldn’t be there 
if we didn’t have the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. The idea was, as 
Scoop said, as America urbanized, we 
needed to preserve open space for the 
public to use it. Some of the most 
iconic open spaces across the United 
States have been created for the public 
to enjoy. 
So let’s reaffirm our commitment 
that was always there. Let’s turn down 
the budget point of order and make 
sure that we are making the right in-
vestments and finish moving this legis-
lation to its final passage.

Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
last week we had some great conversa-
tions on the floor of the Senate about 
the Great American Outdoors Act and 
the combination of two important 
pieces of legislation—the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, first author-
ized 55 years ago, and the Restore Our 
Parks Act—both of which would be 
combined in the Great American Out-
doors Act and the most significant 
piece of conservation legislation Con-
gress has passed in nearly 50 years or 
more. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, of course, is funded by taking 
offshore oil and gas revenues, and that 
is how the Restore Our Parks Act 
would be funded as well. Both of them 
would take dollars generated from off-
shore oil and gas production. There are 
a few other ways that it is funded, like 
boat fuel excise tax revenues and oth-
ers, but primarily that is the source of 
funding, and, after a series of formula 
distributions out of the Treasury, the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund is 
appropriated about $1 billion, and even-
tually the Restore Our Parks Act, 
under this legislation, would be appro-
priated dollars as well. 
Ninety-nine percent of the dollars 
used by the Land and Water Conserva-
tion 
Fund 
is 
used 
to 
purchase 
inholdings to complete national parks 
and to work on wildlife refuges and 
other types of important public land 
designations across the country. 
We all know that our national parks 
are suffering from the amount of visi-
tors that they receive. We are grateful 
for the visitors, but that is a tremen-
dous strain on roads and trails and the 
visitor centers across the country. For 
instance, in Rocky Mountain National 
Park, the third most heavily visited 
park in the Nation, there is an about 
$85 million backlog, including trail 
maintenance, visitor centers, the sew-
age systems, the campgrounds, and 
some other challenges that they could 
help fix with the use of these dollars. 
Last week I also talked about some 
important letters we had received, let-
ters of support for the Great American 
Outdoors Act, including a letter from 
the outdoor recreation industry. I ask 
unanimous consent that this letter 
from the outdoor recreation industry 
be submitted for the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 8, 2020. 
DEAR
LEADER
MCCONNELL
AND
LEADER 
SCHUMER: The outdoor recreation industry is 
extremely encouraged by recent announce-
ments that the Senate plans to hold a vote 
on the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) 
in June. As outdoor recreation business lead-
ers, we know investments in recreation ac-
cess and infrastructure are vital to the out-
door recreation industry and economies 
across the country. 
Prior to the COVID–19 outbreak, the out-
door recreation industry contributed $778 bil-
lion in economic output, accounted for 2.2 
percent of United States Gross Domestic 
Product, supported 5.2 million jobs and was 
growing faster than the economy as a whole 
in every indicator. Unfortunately, due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and shutdowns nec-
essary to slow its progression, America’s 
outdoor recreation economy was hindered 
when we needed the outdoors more than 
ever. Outdoor Recreation Roundtable’s April 
survey of the sector shows that 79 percent of 
outdoor businesses have had to lay off or fur-
lough employees, and 89 percent are seeing 
decreased revenue. However, we know there 
is a bright future for outdoor recreation 
ahead, as several sectors of the industry are 
already experiencing rapidly increasing de-
mand. 
These outdoor businesses are the backbone 
of our industry and range from specialty re-
tailers, apparel, gear and vehicle manufac-
turers, outfitters and guides to campground 
and 
marina 
operators. 
They 
are 
often 
foundational to a community’s economy. 
With rising unemployment and Americans 
eager to experience the outdoors, investment 
in our industry’s core infrastructure—public 
lands and waters—will allow our businesses 
to get back to what we do best: stimulate 
local economies, put people back to work, 
and allow Americans to benefit from time 
spent outside. 
This is why we respectfully ask you to pass 
the Great American Outdoors Act as soon as 
possible. 
GAOA will fully fund the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF) at $900 million 
annually, providing more recreation access 
for communities across the country and fuel-
ing more outdoor recreation economic activ-
ity. In a nutshell, if Congress invests the in-
tended amount of $900 million into LWCF 
recreation access projects on local, state and 
federal lands, it will create much-needed 
close-to-home recreation opportunities while 
revitalizing the outdoor recreation economy. 
Additionally, GAOA dedicates up to $9.5 
billion over the next five years to mainte-
nance backlog projects that have been dev-
astating our public lands and waters. Invest-
ing in these projects will improve outdoor 
recreation-related facilities such as docks, 
restrooms, campgrounds, trails, roads and 
more that have deteriorated significantly 
from decades of underfunded maintenance. 
As business leaders, we understand the need 
to make sure customers have good experi-
ences when they visit stores or facilities, it 
ensures they come back again. Funding the 
maintenance backlog will also ensure that 
adequate infrastructure for all types of 
recreation on our public lands and waters ex-
ists so more people who are seeking the ben-
efits the outdoors has to offer can get out-
side 
safely 
and 
grow 
our 
industry 
sustainably. 
Passing GAOA now would stimulate the 
outdoor recreation industry made up of 
thousands of businesses that support com-
munities in all 50 states, support rural 
economies, create jobs to carry out essential 
work, and provide opportunities for millions 
of Americans to recreate on our public lands 
and waters for generations to come. We 
know this vital legislation is slated for a 
vote in the coming weeks and we urge you to 
move as quickly as possible to get this legis-
lation across the finish line. Your support of 
GAOA is a vote for American jobs and 
health, community resiliency and the out-
door recreation economy. Thank you for 
your leadership.

economic activity. This letter from the 
outdoor recreation industry says they 
are extremely encouraged by the Great 
American Outdoors Act, and they note 
that this is an incredible opportunity 
to invest in recreation access and in-
frastructure, both of which are vital to 
the outdoor recreation industry and 
economies around the country. 
Earlier today, we received another 
very important letter—a letter that I 
think a lot of people will find very im-
portant. This letter, dated June 15, 
2020, begins with this paragraph: 
From east to west, America is home to in-
credible lands, waters, and cultural treas-
ures. Now, more than ever, we are relying on 
our public lands to get outdoors, to connect 
with the world, to support jobs, and to 
strengthen our communities. In this time of 
uncertainty, we have been given a once in a 
lifetime opportunity to protect our public 
lands and waters for all generations to come. 
This letter was written by Theodore 
Roosevelt IV. This letter in support for 
the Great American Outdoors Act 
comes from the great-grandson of 
President Teddy Roosevelt. 
Passing the Great American Outdoors Act 
would be taking a page from President Theo-
dore Roosevelt’s book: protecting the quint-
essence of who we are as Americans in the 
stewardship of our natural places, great and 
small. President Roosevelt set conservation 
as a priority—a duty—for a great and far- 
sighted nation in recognition that our na-
tional bounty is the foundation for all else. 
Without it, we cannot prosper. 
I am glad to see strong bipartisan support 
for the GAOA in the House, Senate, and from 
the President. We are counting on you to 
protect and preserve our public lands. And 
we need your continued leadership to secure 
this monumental legislation. 
Sincerely, Theodore Roosevelt IV. 
I have talked often about the legacy 
President Roosevelt left our country 
when it comes to our lands and con-
servation. In fact, the genesis of the 
Great American Outdoors Act comes 
from a meeting Senator DAINES and I 
had, along with the majority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, talking to the 
President in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House about these two pro-
grams, which people like MARK WAR-
NER, RICHARD BURR, ANGUS KING, JOE 
MANCHIN, 
MARTIN
HEINRICH, 
MARIA 
CANTWELL, ROB PORTMAN, and LAMAR 
ALEXANDER worked so diligently on. 
We talked about the legacy Theodore 
Roosevelt has, and now we have this 
letter from his great-grandson securing 
that legacy for this country. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this letter from Theodore 
Roosevelt IV printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 15, 2020. 
DEAR
MAJORITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER, 
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: From east 
to west, America is home to incredible lands, 
waters, and cultural treasures. Now, more 
than ever, we are relying on our public lands 
to get outdoors, to connect with the world, 
to support jobs, and to strength our commu-
nities. In this time of uncertainty, we have 
been given a once in a lifetime opportunity 
to protect our public lands and waters for all 
generations to come. 
I write to you today to urge swift passage 
and enactment of the Great American Out-
doors Act (GAOA)—legislation that will pro-
vide much needed support to the outdoor 
places we all depend on. This bill will fully 
and permanently fund the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF), our nation’s 
most important conservation program, to 
ensure protection and increased access to 
public lands in every state and county in 
America. Additionally, GAOA will fund pri-
ority repairs in our National Parks and on 
other public lands to address an ever-grow-
ing backlog of maintenance needs. 
This outstanding bipartisan legislation 
will ensure every American has access to the 
outdoors, no matter where they live. It will 
also help our communities and nation re-
cover by creating jobs and economic growth 
across the country—in both cities and rural 
areas. Nationally, outdoor recreation con-
tributes roughly $778 billion in consumer 
spending and supports 5.2 million jobs. More-
over, economic analysis shows that every $1 
million invested in LWCF could support be-
tween 16 and 30 jobs, while national park 
funding in GAOA could support 100,000 jobs, 
$17.5 billion in economic output, and con-
tribute $9.6 billion to the US GDP. At a time 
when small businesses are struggling, GAOA 
would provide much needed stimulus to get 
Americans outdoors and back to work. 
Passing the Great American Outdoors Act 
would be taking a page from President Theo-
dore Roosevelt’s book: protecting the quint-
essence of who we are as Americans in the 
stewardship of our natural places, great and 
small. President Roosevelt set conservation 
as a priority—a duty—for a great and far- 
sighted nation in recognition that our nat-
ural bounty is the foundation for all else. 
Without it, we cannot prosper. 
I am glad to see strong bipartisan support 
for GAOA in the House, Senate, and from the 
President. We are counting on you to protect 
and preserve our public lands. And we need 
your continued leadership to secure this 
monumental legislation. 
Sincerely, 
THEODORE ROOSEVELT IV. 
Mr. GARDNER. I know tonight we 
will 
have 
continued 
conversations 
about the legislation and the cost of 
the legislation. There are some who 
will say that this bill isn’t paid for or 
perhaps that the revenues aren’t ac-
counted for properly. I would like to 
speak to the contrary. Again, I will be 
speaking about this later this evening. 
If you look at how this bill, the Great 
American Outdoors Act, is funded, it 
doesn’t cost the taxpayer money. It 
comes from offshore oil and gas rev-
enue. That is revenue generated from 
oil and gas production on Federal land 
in fiscal year 2019, which totaled $11.6 
billion. This is just an example of one 
of the years of funding. 
In 2019, the revenue generated from 
oil and gas was about $11.6 billion; $11.6 
billion went into the Treasury. 
Right off the top of that, $2.4 billion 
went to the States. We don’t change 
that. The $2.4 billion goes to the 
States. This bill does not change that. 
Another $1 billion of that $11.6 billion 
from back in 2019—the same formula 
would apply every year—another $1 bil-
lion went to Tribal entities right off 
the top. 
So $2.4 billion went to States, and an-
other $1 billion went to Tribal entities. 
After that, $1.7 billion of this amount 
of money went to the Reclamation 
Fund. To get this straight, there is 
funding that goes out to the States, 
funding that goes out to Tribal enti-
ties, and funding that goes to the Rec-
lamation Fund. 
Then fourth in line for this, $1 billion 
went to the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. 
A curious thing happened on the way 
to the forum, as they say. Only $495 
million got appropriated to the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. So $1 
billion gets taken out of the money in 
2019, the $11.6 billion, with $1 billion to 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, but only $495 million gets appro-
priated. That is because even though it 
was authorized to get more, that 
money has been syphoned off and spent 
on other things. 
And $150 million went to the Historic 
Preservation Fund. 
That is a total of $5.25 billion from 
2019. That is what we accounted for so 
far out of that revenue: money to the 
States, 
money 
to 
Tribal 
entities, 
money to the Reclamation Fund, $1 bil-
lion to the LWCF fund even though 
only $495 million got appropriated, and 
$150 million to the Historic Preserva-
tion Fund. That left $5.35 billion that 
went directly into Treasury. That is 
the money that would be used—at least 
a portion of it—for the Restore Our 
Parks Act. 
You can see this is paid for. Congress 
just has bad habits that need to be cor-
rected around here. We will have addi-
tional time to have that conversation 
this evening and obviously others 
about the merits of this legislation and 
what it means. 
There has been more and more talk 
around the country about how this 
isn’t just about national parks and it 
isn’t just about national forests; it is 
about our urban parks and urban cen-
ters. Some of our colleagues made pas-
sionate, eloquent statements about the 
need for access in all of our commu-
nities, to make sure we have more ac-
cess for communities across the coun-
try—our urban settings, our rural set-
tings, whether it is a ballpark or some 
other kind of recreation activity at a 
park. 
This is the opportunity for us to get 
to work, with no cost to the taxpayer, 
to do something we can all be proud of. 
I am grateful that Mr. Roosevelt would 
send a letter highlighting the work 
this Congress is doing that can stand, 
generations later, the test of Teddy 
Roosevelt’s leadership and the oppor-
tunity for us to build on the leadership 
of President Roosevelt. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2966 
June 15, 2020 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor today to talk 
about the legislation that is before the 
Senate, which is a great opportunity to 
help our national parks. 
The bill does a number of things that 
people have heard about to help with 
regard to our public lands, with regard 
to fishing access, and with regard to 
community parks. Yet one thing it 
does that is absolutely essential is it 
included the Restore Our Parks Act. 
That is legislation which is necessary 
right now to fix our national parks. 
I say fix our national parks—they are 
our treasure. When people are asked 
about the national parks, they usually 
use that word. It is a treasure. It is a 
great asset of the United States. I 
think Ken Burns said it is ‘‘America’s 
best idea.’’ He did a great documentary 
on the parks, by the way. 
The point is, our national parks are 
spectacular. They are majestic. They 
tell the history of our country. There 
are so many good things about them. 
The problem is that right now, our 
parks are under a huge backlog of 
maintenance 
projects—$12.5 
billion. 
That is way more than the parks’ budg-
et. They just can’t get out from under 
it. It has been happening for years and 
years and years. 
Think about people going back to our 
parks 
this 
summer 
after 
the 
coronavirus hopefully gets better and 
people are able to go to these reopened 
parks. We will probably have huge at-
tendance. When they get there, they 
will find out that a trail is closed be-
cause of erosion, or the bathroom 
doesn’t work because the bathroom has 
deteriorated, or they can’t go to the 
visitors center because the ceiling has 
been leaking, which caused mold on the 
walls, which caused the floors to buck-
le, or the highways and bridges are 
crumbling. This is what is happening in 
our national parks. 
As Members of Congress, we asked 
them to give us a full list over the last 
few years of this because we keep hear-
ing about this, and they have. They 
have talked about $6.5 million of high- 
priority projects and about $6 billion of 
priority projects, and the list continues 
to grow. 
By the way, the costs continue to 
compound. In other words, they get 
worse and worse every year. Just think 
about your own home. If you don’t fix 
the leaky roof I have talked about, you 
will have all these other problems. If 
you can get to it and fix it when it hap-
pens, you will have much lower costs. 
All of us as taxpayers should want to 
fix this maintenance backlog and be 
able to say that not only are these 
parks a treasure, but these parks are 
open, everything is open, and we can do 
a better job in stewardship. This legis-
lation does that. 
Not a penny of the funding, by the 
way, can go toward expansion of the 
parks. I have heard that from some of 
my colleagues—well, you all keep put-
ting money into expanding the parks. 
No, that is not what this is about. This 
is about stewardship. This is about en-
suring that we take better care of what 
we have. I can’t think of a more fis-
cally conservative idea than that. I 
think it is important for us to realize 
that this legislation before us is not 
about expanding anything; it is about 
taking better care of what we have. 
The annual appropriations from Con-
gress to the parks funds the rangers, 
the nature programs, and the basics to 
continue to operate the parks. They do 
not fund these maintenance backlog 
problems or these big projects. We have 
been ignoring them for decades, by the 
way. This is not new. It has built up 
and is getting worse and worse as the 
costs compound. 
Let me give an example. Cuyahoga 
Valley National Park is in Ohio. We 
love Cuyahoga Valley. It is the 13th 
most visited national park in the coun-
try. You may never have heard of it, 
but if you are in the Akron-Cleveland 
area, I hope you go. It is spectacular. 
Guess what. They have a maintenance 
backlog of just over $50 million. Their 
annual budget from the Park Service is 
$11 million. That covers everything. 
That operates the entire park—the 13th 
most visited park in America. It is a 
beautiful park that extends basically 
from Cleveland to Akron. It is beau-
tiful along the Cuyahoga River. It is 
beautiful. It has a tourism train that 
goes through it, a single-track, narrow- 
gauge train. It is just a great place. 
The train tracks are falling apart. That 
is a huge expense that can’t come out 
of this annual budget because you have 
to replace the ties and so on. 
There is a bridge that I saw that is 
crumbling. It is not going to be able to 
be used soon by bicyclists or hikers to 
go over the river because it is falling 
apart. That bridge is a capital expense. 
It takes a lot of funding to do that and 
to do it right. So the legislation before 
us says: Let’s take this on. Let’s get 
started on getting this backlog behind 
us so that we can focus on having the 
most majestic and the most beautiful 
parks in the world here that we can 
continue to be proud of. 
The way we do it is really inter-
esting. We say, OK, we are going to 
continue to have the annual appropria-
tions, and we are going to properly 
fund the parks that way, but for these 
backlog problems, we are going to take 
funding from offshore and onshore oil 
and gas and other energy projects that 
are currently going directly into the 
government, and we are going to take 
no more than half of that funding that 
is unobligated—in other words, not ob-
ligated to any other purpose—and we 
are going to say: Let’s use that fund-
ing, up to a cap every year, to reduce 
about half the backlog over the next 5 
years. It is the priority projects I 
talked about, the $6.5 billion. 
To me, this makes all the sense in 
the world. Again, it is going to save us 
money over time—assuming we want 
our parks to be working, we want the 
trails to be open, we want the business 
centers to be open, which of course we 
do and we must. Our parks are more 
visited than ever, and it is important 
that we have parks that are ready, par-
ticularly when people start to go back 
to the parks this summer. 
Some of my colleagues have come to 
the floor and said: Well, isn’t there an-
other way to do this? I mean, I wish 
there were, but this is a pretty good 
funding source. 
For those who say it is not paid for, 
well, I am telling you what the funding 
source is. Is it is the royalties that 
come off of these energy projects. 
By the way, this is for a good con-
servation cause and a good fiscally con-
servative cause—to get these long-term 
maintenance problems under control so 
that they don’t continue to grow and 
grow and grow. 
I first started on the project over 13 
years ago, which is why it is kind of ex-
citing for me that is finally coming, I 
hope, to fruition here in the Senate, at 
least. 
I was the OMB Director for George 
W. Bush—the Office of Management 
and Budget—and in our budget in 2007, 
we put in place a centennial project for 
the parks. The Park Service celebrated 
its 100th anniversary in 2016, and build-
ing up to that, we wanted to deal with 
this long-term maintenance backlog 
and provide some more funding for the 
parks. 
I worked with the Secretary of the 
Interior at the time—this was, again, 
the George W. Bush administration, a 
Republican administration. I worked 
with Democrats here on the Hill. We 
worked with all the outside groups con-
cerned about the parks and came up 
with a creative way to get public-pri-
vate partnership money in it to provide 
more funding for this long-term main-
tenance problem. We were not success-
ful in getting Congress to take it up 
and to appropriate those funds at the 
time, but I continued working on this. 
A couple years later when I was 
asked to serve on the centennial com-
mission on the parks—I was not in of-
fice at that time. I had left politics— 
thinking forever—but now I am back 
here in the Senate. But on the centen-
nial commission, we analyzed what was 
going on in the parks in connection 
with the centennial coming up, in 2016, 
and what was the No. 1 issue? Of course 
it was this long-term maintenance 
backlog and how do you deal with it 
and the great frustration people felt 
because we just couldn’t get on top of 
it. So I have been at this for some 
time. 
Again, I see that some of my col-
leagues are saying there must be other 
ways to fund this, and some have sug-
gested, well, let’s raise some fees. 
Well, I am the author of the Centen-
nial Act, which was passed about 3 
years ago—on the last day, practically, 
of session in 2016. That legislation ac-
tually took the senior fee, which is the 
lifetime senior pass, and increased it, 
actually quadrupled it, to provide more 
funding for this very purpose and other 
purposes at the parks.

That was not without controversy. I 
can show you some of the letters and 
emails that I got and some of the 
phone calls that we received with re-
gard to increasing the senior pass. But 
we did it for the right reasons—because 
we thought the senior pass was a rel-
atively good deal—which it still is, by 
the way. It is a tremendous deal for our 
seniors. But we decided we were going 
to take some heat on this in order to 
provide more revenue for the park be-
cause we were so frustrated because we 
couldn’t find other sources. 
I am also the author of the Centen-
nial Challenge as part of that legisla-
tion, which allows for the private sec-
tor to provide funding to our parks. 
Again, we did this because we were 
very interested in finding more fund-
ing. The Centennial Challenge Fund is 
a public-private partnership. It re-
quires that every Federal dollar that 
goes into the parks be matched at least 
one-to-one with a private sector dollar. 
And I have been involved with that. I 
have been involved in selling that pro-
gram and encouraging the private sec-
tor to do more. 
Since we passed that in 2008—fiscal 
year 2008—Congress has provided $129 
million in appropriations, which has 
been leveraged by an additional $167 
million in non-Federal funding. In 
other words, it has been more than 
one-to-one. There has been more than 1 
dollar of private sector funding that 
has matched the 1 dollar of Federal 
funding, so that has worked. But, folks, 
it has its limits. We are talking about 
$12.5 billion in the backlog, and the 
numbers I just gave you—we were able 
to raise $167 million in non-Federal 
funding. 
So I would just say to my colleagues 
who say ‘‘Gosh, why can’t you raise 
fees and so on?’’—that has been done. 
I will say also with regard to fees 
into some of our parks, it is not very 
practical. At the Cuyahoga Valley Na-
tional Park, as an example, there are 
literally dozens of entrances to the 
park. I mean, the park is in a suburban 
area through Akron and Cleveland, 
that area, and you can get to the park 
through all sorts of different roads and 
avenues, and there is no grand en-
trance to the park. There is a great 
visitors center, which people are en-
couraged to go to as they enter the 
park, but there are bike trails through 
it, and there is a railroad through it, as 
I talked about, and there are lots of 
roads that come into it. So it is not 
like you are driving into Yellowstone 
Park and you have to go through a des-
ignated entrance. 
So is there more we can do in some of 
these areas to provide additional pay- 
fors to the parks? I am sure there are, 
and I will continue to work on that, 
and I will continue to look at ways to 
do it. But $12.5 billion? It is not going 
to happen without a lot of controversy. 
So this is about being sure we are 
doing what is right for our parks. 
It is also, though, helpful in terms of 
jobs, as you can imagine, because these 
projects are infrastructure. We talk a 
lot about that around here and, typi-
cally we don’t even think about paying 
for it. We just say we are going to do 
an infrastructure stimulus project, as 
an example, as was done back in 2008 
and 2009. 
In this case, these are shovel-ready 
and vetted projects. Again, we have re-
quired, as Congress, for the Park Serv-
ice to tell us what the projects are. So 
I can give you a list for your State. I 
have done that with my colleagues— 
given them the list of what the top pri-
orities are for their States, how much 
money it is, what the project is, how 
you do it. You don’t have to go and get 
the permits that you might have to get 
on non-Federal land because these are 
on national park property, and they 
just keep building up, higher and high-
er, but they are ready. They are ready 
to go. They are also vetted. They also 
don’t have to go through the same 
process that some would if they were 
on non-private land. 
They create a lot of jobs. We just had 
a report that has been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget that 
came out of the Park Service showing 
that the number of jobs that are direct 
jobs related to this national park res-
toration act we are voting on today is 
over 40,000 jobs when you do direct and 
indirect, including suppliers to these 
projects. 
So you have the person who is fixing 
the bridge I talked about or the rail-
road tracks, but who provides the ma-
terial to put in the new railroad ties? 
It is over 100,000 jobs. So over 100,000 
jobs are created just from this legisla-
tion. 
So it is the right thing to do no mat-
ter what, but it also happens to be a 
really opportune time for us to put in 
place some funding that goes directly 
into good-paying, high-quality jobs— 
average pay, $65,000 to $70,000 a year— 
to be able to help with regard to the 
post-coronavirus economic downturn 
we have seen and will see for some 
time. 
So this is good legislation for all 
these reasons. 
There has also been an analysis done 
recently about what happens if you 
don’t fix these parks and the parks 
aren’t able to open. 
There is a $41 billion economic ben-
efit for communities around the parks. 
That is $41 billion a year. Think about 
that. It supports more than 340,000 jobs. 
These are not jobs in the parks them-
selves but surrounding. So these are 
the restaurants and the hotels and the 
outfitters and so on. 
Our national parks are not only a 
great way for us to help create more 
jobs with regard to the infrastructure 
needs that are overwhelming, with 
good stewardship—not expanding one 
acre but just taking better care of 
what we have—but it is also an oppor-
tunity for us to help our economy, to 
help ensure that we are putting people 
back to work in good-paying jobs, and 
help ensure that taxpayers aren’t going 
to foot an even higher bill by not tak-
ing care of that leaky roof that then 
causes the mold on the wall that then 
causes the floor to couple. 
We are going to get this started. Will 
there be need for more funding? Abso-
lutely. Again, some of the ideas I have 
talked to my colleagues about on how 
to find additional funding, I am all 
ears. Again, I have done it. I have 
raised the fees in legislation. I have 
looked at the private sector, and we 
brought in over $150 million of private 
sector money. But this $6.5 billion, 
which is the amount in this legislation, 
to deal with the highest priority infra-
structure projects and problems at our 
parks is absolutely essential. 
Let’s not wait any longer. Let’s get 
this done now and ensure we can con-
tinue to enjoy not just the beauty and 
the history of our national parks but 
also those economic benefits I talked 
about and do so for generations to 
come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, it 
seems clear this body is prepared to 
pass the Great American Outdoors Act. 
It will be doing so without the bipar-
tisan language to strengthen coastal 
resiliency around the country, sending 
a final message to the American people 
that the Senate cares more about 
parks than it does about people. 
Let me just say a couple things first. 
My colleague has just said that this is 
paid for. I almost burst out laughing. It 
is paid for by taking dollars currently 
obligated to go to the U.S. Treasury 
and shuffling them over. That is paid 
for like I am going to take money that 
is going for groceries and instead I am 
going to pay for the movie theater. We 
are going to take money that is spent 
on essentials and spend it on some-
thing that is wonderful, but no one 
would say it is essential. 
And I say that one only needs to fol-
low the money—to follow the money— 
to see that the Senate cares more 
about parks than it does about people. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will spend billions on deferred mainte-
nance—broken toilets, leaky roofs, et 
cetera—in national parks, but, in fact, 
60 percent of this money is going to 
seven States. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund spending shows the disparity 
clearly, spending $17.66 per capita on 
inland States, while just $7.53 on coast-
al States, and is spoken of as an eco-
nomic development tool, raising $40- 
something billion for the communities 
in which the investment is made, 
which tells you why the Senators from 
these seven States are the cosponsors 
of the bill. Who wouldn’t want $40 bil-
lion in economic activity at the ex-
pense of everybody else? 
But who is it at the expense of? 
Forty-two percent of Americans live in 
parishes or counties in coastal United 
States; 85 percent of Americans live in 
those coastal States; and zero percent

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 15, 2020 
of this money is going to address coast-
al 
resiliency—areas 
increasingly 
threatened by rising sea levels and 
flooding, lives being lost, communities 
being upended by catastrophic flood 
events such as hurricanes can cause. I 
have seen it in my State of Louisiana. 
We have seen it on the news. We should 
be painfully aware at this point of the 
devastation hurricanes and other flood-
ing disasters can cause in our society. 
So the Great American Outdoors Act 
spends billions on where people vaca-
tion but absolutely nothing on where 
people live. 
I have been vocal in my opposition to 
the bill in its current form, and the 
reasons for that opposition have been 
misconstrued, so let me please now 
clarify. 
I heard one Senator say that I only 
wanted money for Gulf States. Yes, I 
do want money for Gulf States. Lou-
isiana has been the hardest hit by 
coastal erosion. 
By the way, 90 percent of the funding 
for the Great American Outdoors Act 
comes from energy production off the 
gulf coast. But I want funding for all 
coastal States. 
Louisiana’s wetlands are eroding into 
the gulf at the rate of one football field 
per hour, but we are not alone. Go to 
barrier islands on the eastern coast. Go 
to Alaska and see the communities 
that are dissolving into the ocean. 
Miami property values are falling as 
the Atlantic Ocean rises, threatening 
with greater flooding, causing rising 
insurance rates, and causing lower 
property values. That is Miami Beach. 
Sea Island, GA; Cape Fear, NC; Rhode 
Island; Maine; you name it—each has 
water coming higher than it ever has. 
Wouldn’t it have been great if, as 
these bills passed out of the committee 
together, a coastal resiliency piece of 
legislation had been added to the Great 
American Outdoors Act? But now the 
42 percent of Americans who live on 
the beach, live in a coastal parish or 
county, and the 85 percent who live in 
a coastal State are waiting for some 
help to come later. 
Now, that said, some have said I am 
against giving any money to the na-
tional parks. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. I have stated before 
from this very desk in speeches on this 
issue that I believe that national parks 
are a vital part of the American experi-
ence. Just as one of my colleagues said, 
they provide opportunities for Ameri-
cans to experience a natural environ-
ment and learn about our Nation’s his-
tory. 
I would vote happily for the Great 
American Outdoors Act, giving it bil-
lions, if only we would spend at least a 
little bit—maybe a dime—on coastal 
resiliency for where people live. I am 
not against parks; I am just against 
parks over people. 
As people misstated my opposition, 
they correctly stated the reason they 
do not wish to include my language to 
provide 
protection—coastal 
resil-
iency—for the parishes and counties 
where people live. This is the one true 
thing: Folks are afraid that if the 
coastal resiliency legislation is in-
cluded, the bill would not pass. For 
some, it would be perceived as encour-
aging offshore drilling, that it would 
raise issues of climate change, and, 
again, that it would not pass. 
Well, there are several responses. 
First, if you don’t try, you fail. Henry 
Ford said: Whether you say that you 
can or you say you cannot, you are cor-
rect. Such is the case with this bill. 
If people say that we cannot include 
legislation for coastal resiliency to 
protect parishes and counties where 42 
percent of Americans live, we can’t do 
so because it would not be included in 
the first place. 
Secondly, it was said that the Great 
American Outdoors Act is based on rev-
enue from offshore drilling, and there-
fore folks would not vote for it—again, 
one of those things you have to almost 
laugh at because if people really think 
that, it is either the epitome of hypoc-
risy, or it just shows gross ignorance. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
funded with revenue from offshore oil 
and gas production. So for someone to 
say that, no, folks won’t vote for a 
coastal resiliency bill because it relies 
upon offshore oil and gas revenue, but 
they are to support the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, which relies on off-
shore oil and gas revenue to pay for 
it—again, you just have to laugh. It is 
either hypocrisy, or it is gross igno-
rance. I actually think it is just not 
true; that the real reason the coastal 
resiliency bill is not included is that 
folks are afraid that if it is included, it 
would not pass. 
One of my colleagues who agrees 
with me on this issue said that it is 
kind of like being in a lifeboat and you 
say: We are in; pull up the ladder. Once 
we got this legislation in a form that 
would pass, the folks who wanted it to 
pass, whose States disproportionately 
benefit from this, that they will recog-
nize and realize the economic develop-
ment, they said: Let’s pull up the lad-
der. We don’t care about coastal resil-
iency enough that we are going to ac-
tually include legislation that would 
support it financially. So they had 
their money. They achieved their ob-
jective. The heck with those at risk 
from rising sea levels. The heck with 
those 85 percent of people who live in 
coastal States, the 42 percent who live 
in a coastal parish or county. We will 
get our bathrooms fixed, the potholes 
done. Come visit us. You will abso-
lutely need to because, in the mean-
time, you will be flooding. 
So the idea of getting your funding 
and your bill in place—you are on the 
life raft, and then pulling up the ladder 
brought to mind this image. 
Here you see folks being pulled up a 
ladder. Hurricane Katrina. The wet-
lands south of New Orleans had eroded 
into the ocean. When Katrina hit, it 
was almost a straight shot to those 
levees, and such a straight shot, even-
tually they collapsed. Because they 
collapsed, we had flooding in New Orle-
ans. 
There you see a truck almost com-
pletely submerged. 
There you see somebody who broke 
through their roof so that they could 
get on top of their roof so they could be 
rescued. They are being pulled up be-
cause the people who wrote this bill 
said, No, if we include the coastal resil-
iency, our bill will not pass; therefore, 
we aren’t going to try. Because they 
said, By golly, we are in the life raft 
and being pulled up a ladder, there will 
be many more Americans who will be 
pulled up a ladder, but they will be 
pulled up a ladder by the Coast Guard, 
which will rescue them from a rooftop 
because of rising sea levels—and, there-
fore, flooding and hurricanes—in their 
hometowns. I would like to say that 
this would be a rare event. We have 
seen it increasingly, though. Again, 
since more and more Americans live in 
coastal parishes and counties, this will 
become a bigger and bigger issue. So 
this photo seems appropriate. 
Folks didn’t want to try. They feared 
that caring for Americans and helping 
to prevent an incident such as this 
would imperil the fixing of potholes in 
national parks located disproportion-
ately in seven States. Again, because of 
that, we will have more scenes like 
this—more deaths, more devastation, 
more lives in turmoil, and billions 
upon billions that will be spent on dis-
aster relief because this body will have 
refused to have invested in coastal re-
siliency. If there were ever a case of a 
stitch in time could save nine, it would 
be this. 
Again, folks, ask: Well, what could 
you do with coastal resiliency? 
I will just speak of Terrebonne Par-
ish in South Louisiana, which borders 
the Gulf of Mexico. They recently put 
in a flood wall. There was a high water 
event, and of the 10,000 homes that 
would have been flooded—maybe with 
$1 billion or $2 billion in disaster re-
lief—no flooding occurred because of an 
investment in coastal resiliency. 
Now, we can do it if we try, but if we 
say we are not going to, then we are in 
the life raft that is being pulled up the 
ladder, and we have our money, and 
potholes will be fixed in our home 
States. In the meantime, if you are in 
a parish or a State or a county, we will 
be there afterward to give you money 
through FEMA, but we will not be 
there beforehand to keep you from 
flooding in the first place. This is what 
happens when you put parks over peo-
ple. Perhaps this Senate should reverse 
this and put people over parks. 
At the outset, I said that the Great 
American Outdoors Act is going to 
pass. I see it. They have done their 
work, and it is going to pass. I will just 
go home tonight, frustrated, thinking 
of this picture and how many more we 
have. Yet, if the sponsors of this bill 
who have been all about ‘‘we will be 
with you next time’’ are truly, truly 
wanting to prevent another incident 
like this, then maybe they will join my

bipartisan coalition that advocates for 
either a coastal amendment or some 
legislation in the future. They will 
show that they are as willing to fight 
as hard to save the lives of those who 
live on our coastline as they are to se-
cure the funding to fix broken toilets 
and potholes and leaky roofs. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, we 
have a series of votes today on the 
Great American Outdoors Act, includ-
ing one to adopt the substitute amend-
ment. There are 60 of my Senate col-
leagues who cosponsored this bill, and 
20 more joined us last week, resulting 
in strong, bipartisan votes to begin 
consideration of the bill. These votes 
today will put us within 1 vote of pass-
ing this important bipartisan legisla-
tion. 
Over the last week, many of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle have 
taken to the floor to talk about how 
the Great American Outdoors Act will 
benefit the entire country, and they 
have shared examples of how their 
home States have been positively im-
pacted already by the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. It is a testament 
to the importance of this historic con-
servation legislation that has brought 
so many of us together during such a 
toxic atmosphere. Yet that is the beau-
ty of our Nation’s great outdoors. It 
brings us all together—all walks and 
shapes and political preferences. It 
makes no difference. We all love the 
outdoors, and it is available for every-
one to enjoy in any number of ways, 
whether that be through hunting, hik-
ing, fishing, biking, or just simply by 
soaking in nature. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund has been responsible for helping 
to acquire many of our Nation’s most 
iconic and scenic lands and to provide 
wonderful outdoor recreational oppor-
tunities, but it is important to remem-
ber that it is also used in many ways 
that provide an economic boost to our 
States and counties, whether that be 
through an LWCF grant that allows 
community spaces to be built, like the 
47 community pools the LWCF sup-
ported across my beautiful State of 
West Virginia, or a baseball field in 
Colorado. 
It is also a job creator. A recent anal-
ysis from Boston University shows 
that, at the full funding of $900 million 
annually, the LWCF could support ap-
proximately 15,000 to 28,000 jobs at a 
time when our country needs them 
most. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is a major contributor to the rap-
idly growing outdoor recreation econ-
omy. According to the most recent in-
formation provided by the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis, the U.S. outdoor 
recreation economy accounts for 2.2 
percent, or $427 billion, of our Nation’s 
gross domestic product. Likewise, the 
Outdoor Industry Association has cal-
culated that the outdoor recreation 
economy generates almost $890 million 
in annual consumer spending and sup-
ports over 7.6 million jobs. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund has been able to do wonderful 
things with the funds that have been 
appropriated to date even though those 
appropriations, in recent years, have 
averaged only about half of the author-
ized funding level. In previous years, 
they were even less than that. Just 
imagine what we can achieve for our 
country with the full LWCF funding of 
$900 million per year as the Great 
American Outdoors Act would provide. 
We need to secure this funding be-
cause, since the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund was established 55 
years ago and despite the fact that 
every State, every territory, and al-
most every county in this country has 
benefited from the LWCF, it has only 
been fully funded twice. I say it has 
only been fully funded twice in 55 
years. The passing of the permanent 
LWCF authorization last year was an 
important step, but securing a perma-
nent, dedicated funding source for the 
multiple conservation programs funded 
by the LWCF is the ultimate goal. 
I would be remiss not to acknowledge 
the many Democratic Senators and 
Members of the House, both retired and 
here today, who have been champions 
for LWCF. They have helped to pave 
the way of where we are today—within 
striking distance of realizing the goal 
of permanent, mandatory funding. 
I am incredibly proud, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources, as the 
sponsor of the LWCF Permanent Fund-
ing Act, and as the lead Democrat on 
this bill, to be in good company of 43 of 
my Democratic colleagues who have 
signed onto this legislation. 
As a member of the Committee on 
Appropriations as well, I have heard 
the concerns that this bill sidesteps the 
ability of the committee to oversee 
LWCF expenditures, so I want to take 
a moment to clarify that this isn’t the 
case. The Great American Outdoors 
Act retains congressional oversight 
and involvement in determining how 
the mandatory funding is allocated. 
To quote from the bill: ‘‘Appropria-
tions Acts may provide for alternate 
allocation of amounts made available, 
including allocations by account, pro-
gram, and project.’’ There is similar 
language 
for 
deferred 
maintenance 
spending. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
necessary, however, to ensure that the 
full $900 million each year that is au-
thorized for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund is spent so that we 
don’t end up with what has happened 
over the past 50 years, wherein over $21 
billion has been deposited into the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund but 
has not been used for LWCF purposes. 
It never will be. We will never see that. 
It is in the Treasury. Similarly, the 
Great American Outdoors Act takes 
the necessary step of putting $9.5 bil-
lion 
toward 
deferred 
maintenance 
projects on Federal lands, with 70 per-
cent of that amount dedicated for our 
national parks. This legislation will be 
the most significant reduction ever in 
eliminating a major portion of deferred 
maintenance backlog on our national 
parks and public lands. 
The impact of failing to fund mainte-
nance for so long is clear to see for the 
hundreds of millions of visitors to our 
public lands each year. This includes 
the deterioration of historic buildings 
at Independence Hall; the failing water 
treatment facilities at Yosemite and 
the Grand Canyon; the public access 
roads at our national parks and our 
forests that are in disrepair; and out-
dated and unsafe employee housing. We 
need to do better in taking care of 
these very, very special places. 
The infrastructure projects that will 
be funded through this bill are critical 
to protecting many of our national 
treasures, and like the LWCF funding, 
it will provide a significant benefit to 
the outdoor recreation economy. The 
Great American Outdoors Act will help 
us to be good stewards of our public 
lands while, at the same time, it will 
create thousands of new jobs. It is a bi-
partisan win-win. 
At the end of the day, this is an op-
portunity for us to pass down a legacy 
to our kids, to our grandkids, and to 
generations to come. I believe this will 
be the most impactful nationwide con-
servation legislation since the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund was first 
created over 50 years ago, and 50 years 
from now, I know that this body will be 
remembered for getting this bill across 
the finish line. We have broad, bipar-
tisan support with 60 Senators signing 
on, which is representative of how im-
portant these bills are to every State. 
We have support from the administra-
tion and unwavering support from over 
900 
conservation 
and 
sportsmen’s 
groups throughout the Nation. 
I know that not all of my colleagues 
can support this bill and that others 
would have liked to have seen their pri-
orities added. I also want to mention 
that I know it has been portrayed by 
some that we are doing one instead of 
the other. We are taking care of recre-
ation and outdoors. There might be 
coastal deterioration, and we are very 
concerned about that. Yet I want you 
to know that, since there has been off-
shore drilling, a tremendous amount of 
those resources have gone to the four 
coastal States of Mississippi, Alabama, 
Louisiana, and Texas. Louisiana is the 
only State that has used all of its funds 
for coastal restoration, and I applaud it 
for that. I know how costly that has 
been and how costly it will be, and we 
will help in any way we possibly can. 
It is not an either-or. It is not that

being punished for something else. 
That is not the case whatsoever. We 
are finally getting the funds that were 
basically dedicated 55 years ago that 
never did go to the LWCF, the Land 
Water and Conservation Fund. We have

June 15, 2020 
over $9 billion in our park system that 
needs to be for repairs, and we are 
using these funds in the most pru-
dently possible way we can. We would 
hope that everyone would look at it in 
the most positive way and pass some-
thing that we could all look back on 
and be very, very proud of. 
I know that my commitment, as the 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources, is to work with Senators on 
their priorities. It always has been, and 
it always will be no matter what one’s 
party affiliation—Democrat or Repub-
lican. When you are in a position of 
being a ranking member or of being 
chairman of that committee, you work 
with all of the committee members, 
which helps to ensure the consider-
ation of those committee bills on the 
Senate floor. 
What we saw last week and that I an-
ticipate we will see again today is a 
shining example of Democrats and Re-
publicans coming together to put poli-
tics aside to do what is best for con-
serving the natural resources of this 
great Nation. So I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting yes on 
each of the three votes tonight. They 
are all very, very important. They will 
get us closer to the final passage of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak on the Great American Outdoors 
Act and on the fact that this legisla-
tion will add over $17 billion to our def-
icit over the next 10 years. 
When I first rose to speak on this bill 
and on my amendment to it, I closed 
by saying that if we could not pay for 
even a portion of this bill, then we 
were in worse trouble than I had 
thought. Sadly, I rise today, knowing 
that we, apparently, want such trouble. 
During this fiscal year, we have al-
ready run up a deficit of $1.9 trillion— 
more than twice the size of the deficit 
we ran at the same time last year. We 
also just added $2.4 trillion to our debt 
as the Nation necessarily responded to 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
For the past 2 years, I have been 
working 
on 
and 
consistently 
sug-
gesting a way to responsibly pay for 
deferred maintenance at our national 
parks. I love our national parks and 
have fond memories of visiting our 
first national park, Yellowstone, and 
many other parks when I was younger 
and still today. That is why I offered 
my amendment that would have cre-
ated a paid-for legacy restoration fund 
that would have ensured permanently 
dedicated revenue for our parks and 
their maintenance needs. 
For the longest time, I was told that 
my spending concerns would be ad-
dressed when the bill moved out of 
committee. When the bill moved to the 
floor, I asked that my amendment be 
included in the substitute or that it re-
ceive a vote. It was not included, and 
we did not receive a vote. 
While my amendment did not address 
it, I would also mention that many of 
my colleagues regularly express con-
cern about how we increasingly have 
moved discretionary spending to man-
datory spending. This bill does just 
that with the Land and Water Con-
servation provisions. 
Mandatory spending is always re-
newed and never voted on or evaluated 
again. When the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund was permanently au-
thorized at the start of this Congress, 
we were told that its spending would 
remain subject to appropriations and 
the oversight that goes with that. In-
stead, we are taking away that protec-
tion and increasing mandatory spend-
ing even more without increasing rev-
enue. That means more additional na-
tional debt each year without a single 
vote. 
So here we are today, asking future 
generations to pay for what we are not 
even willing to consider paying for 
when we could have responsibly funded 
the maintenance provisions. We won’t 
even consider my amendment that 
would have a modest charge to foreign 
visitors as part of their visa fees to 
help to address this issue, and that is 
revenue that will be lost forever from 
the tourists because we can only col-
lect the fees when they buy visas. The 
revenues cannot be collected retro-
actively. If we won’t pay for even a 
part of the bill, what will we pay for? 
Congress must stop with gimmick 
spending, wherein we attempt to spend 
the same money twice. That is what 
this bill does. If we keep adding new 
mandatory spending without adding 
new revenue, Congress will be forced at 
some point to eliminate mandatory 
spending or to get new funding streams 
that survive well into the future. Man-
datory spending is the portion of our 
bill that will be covered by this that we 
will not vote on. We will not take a 
look at it again. They say, yes, there 
will be oversight—not on whether we 
spend it, not on where the money 
comes from. There will not be another 
opportunity on that. Therefore, I op-
pose this legislation and oppose adding 
to the already massive debt burden 
being placed on future generations and 
the increase in mandatory spending 
when the solution to charge foreigners 
is available. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, the pending amend-
ment, No. 1617, would violate the Sen-
ate pay-go rule by increasing the on- 
budget deficit. Therefore, I raise a 
point of order against this measure 
pursuant to section 4106(a) of H. Con. 
Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on 
the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
MOTION TO WAIVE A POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver pro-
visions of applicable budget resolu-
tions, I move to waive all applicable 
sections of that Act and applicable 
budget resolutions for purposes of 
amendment No. 1617, and I ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, just 
to talk a little about bit how this bill 
is funded, again, the legislation relies 
on the use of the oil and gas revenues 
from both onshore for part of the bill 
and offshore for other parts of the bill, 
and that has been the tradition of the 
legislation since its passage in 1965 
until 5 years ago, since we have had the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. Of 
course, the new Historic Preservation 
Act provisions rely on these revenues 
as well. 
To give you kind of a run-through or 
an example of how this would have pro-
ceeded in 2019—and thanks to my col-
league Senator ALEXANDER for really 
pointing this out and highlighting how 
this funding works—it would have been 
the total revenues generated from off-
shore production and the revenues that 
the Federal Government would have re-
ceived from that. This gives us, I 
think, a good example of how this 
works. 
The revenue generated from oil and 
gas production on Federal land in fiscal 
year 2019 totaled about $11.6 billion. Of 
that $11.6 billion, $2.4 billion went to 
the States. First out of the gate was 
the $2.4 billion. Now, this may change 
from year to year, but the formula dis-
tribution is the same. So $2.4 billion of 
that went to the States. Another $1 bil-
lion went to Tribal entities. Then an-
other $1.7 billion went to the reclama-
tion funds. 
First, the money comes into the 
Treasury. It goes out to the States. 
Then it goes out to the Tribal entities. 
Then it goes out to the reclamation 
fund. Then $1 billion goes to the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. In this 
last 
year, 
Congress 
appropriated, 
though, to the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund $495 million, and the 
rest of the money got siphoned off and 
went somewhere else. Then $150 million 
went to the Historic Preservation 
Fund, which was a total of $5.25 billion 
in 2019 for this distribution. That left 
about $5.35 billion to go directly to the 
Treasury. 
These dollars that we are using help 
to fund the Restore Our Parks Act to 
catch up with deferred maintenance. I 
think our colleague Senator PORTMAN 
has done an outstanding job of explain-
ing that this deferred maintenance is 
also considered debt. So we are actu-
ally using these dollars that have been 
collected from oil and gas revenues 
that have gone to the Treasury and 
have been distributed out to go to the 
debt and the deferred maintenance 
projects at national parks across the 
country: Colorado National; $85 million 
for Rocky Mountain National Park, $75

million for Mesa Verde; $8 million for 
the Great Sand Dunes; $7 million for 
Black Canyon National Park; and the 
list goes on and on. That is not even in-
cluding the Forest Service, the BLM 
lands, and other efforts by the Bureau 
of Indian Education. That is how this 
revenue would work. 
I also wanted to point this out again 
to my colleagues, some of whom may 
have heard this before and some may 
not have. Today, June 15, 2020, we re-
ceived a letter that was written to Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, Senator SCHUMER, 
Speaker PELOSI, and Leader MCCARTHY 
from Teddy Roosevelt IV. This is the 
great-grandson 
of 
President 
Teddy 
Roosevelt. I will read it here: 
From east to west, America is home to in-
credible lands, waters, and cultural treas-
ures. Now, more than ever, we are relying on 
our public lands to get outdoors, to connect 
with 
the 
world, 
to 
support 
jobs, 
and 
strengthen our communities. In this time of 
uncertainty, we have been given a once in a 
lifetime opportunity to protect our public 
lands and waters for all generations to come. 
I write to you today to urge swift passage 
and enactment of the Great American Out-
doors Act (GAOA)—legislation that will pro-
vide much needed support to the outdoor 
places we all depend on. This bill will fully 
and permanently help fund the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), our na-
tion’s most important conservation program, 
to ensure protection and increased access to 
public lands in every state and county in 
America. Additionally, GAOA will fund pri-
ority repairs in our National Parks and on 
other public lands to address an ever-grow-
ing backlog of maintenance needs. 
The letter goes on and talks about 
the principles of President Roosevelt 
and the public lands protections that 
this Congress continues to build upon, 
standing on the shoulders of those gen-
erations past so that we can preserve 
and protect our generations to come. 
I know it has been said by some of 
the opposition to the legislation that 
there are no people who live in the 
areas where the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and Restore Our Parks 
Act helps, that this goes to protect 
States that apparently don’t have 
enough people to merit it. 
Look, every State in the Union has 
benefited from legislation covered by 
the Great American Outdoors Act. 
Every county—nearly every county— 
across the country has benefitted from 
programs within the Great American 
Outdoors Act. It is not just national 
parks. My town in Colorado, in the 
Eastern Plains, is 40 miles away from 
the Kansas-Nebraska border. We don’t 
have a national park in our county. It 
is several hours to get to Rocky Moun-
tain National Park. But even that lit-
tle town that I live in, in that little 
tiny county in the Eastern Plains of 
Colorado, has benefited from the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund—wheth-
er it was decades ago, the purchase of 
water rights that went along with the 
reservoir, called Bonny Reservoir in 
the Eastern Plains, to help protect 
those water rights or recreation oppor-
tunity for youth. This is a farming 
community. We live in the High Plains. 
There are no mountains around us. 
There are no ski areas around us. Yet 
this has helped us too. It helps all 
Americans. It helps corner to corner 
across this great Nation. 
Tonight, we are going to be given a 
choice and a chance to vote on three 
different efforts. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in waiving the budget 
point of order, as I have laid out in my 
objection and in my request for a waiv-
er. I hope my colleagues will join me in 
the next votes following that—one of 
which will require a simple majority 
and one of which will require, yet 
again, a 60-vote threshold. 
This is an opportunity for us to work 
together on a bipartisan basis—the 
House and the Senate, Republicans and 
Democrats coming together, and with 
the White House. They have announced 
their 
support. 
The 
President 
an-
nounced his support for this legislation 
several months ago. We come together 
to do something that we can build upon 
for this country—the greatest ideas 
this country has ever put forward—our 
public lands, our public places, and 
most special spaces in America. 
In Colorado, Wyoming, Louisiana, 
California, New Mexico, and in every 
State, we see dollars coming in and 
jobs being created because of this legis-
lation—the land that this legislation 
represents and the policies that this 
legislation will cover. 
It is estimated that this legislation 
will create 100,000 jobs—over 100,000 
jobs, quite frankly—just in the na-
tional parks section alone. And the 
way the economy is right now, every 
one of those jobs matters. For every $1 
million that is spent in the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, it supports 
nearly 16 to 30 jobs. For every $1 mil-
lion, it supports another 16 to 30 jobs. 
I think one of the most important 
factors in the jobs analysis is where we 
are at in the country with the eco-
nomic 
crisis 
we 
face. 
When 
the 
coronavirus came into Colorado—that 
first wave, the initial step—it hit our 
Western Slope communities the hard-
est. You had a lot of international visi-
tors coming to ski the best skiing 
areas in the country. You had a lot of 
travelers from the Front Range coming 
up to enjoy the weekend, and it created 
some big challenges from COVID–19 in 
those communities as a result. Some of 
those towns have 20 percent, 22 per-
cent, 23 percent unemployment in the 
immediate aftermath of the pandemic 
and the shutdowns of restaurants and 
hotels, and the ski areas shut down a 
couple of months earlier than they nor-
mally would have. 
Of course, it didn’t just impact the 
winter ski season and the winter recre-
ation season. It impacted the summer 
recreation season. Outfitters who had 
their trips canceled, who had their res-
ervations yanked because you couldn’t 
travel or you couldn’t go out, decided 
it wouldn’t be right to stay at a hotel 
or maybe the hotel was closed. If you 
were out camping, the parks were 
closed as well. I think that became one 
of the reasons why this legislation is so 
important too. It is not just about the 
resources. It is not just about pro-
tecting the public lands. It is about the 
jobs that can be created in these public 
land communities that were hit hard-
est and first by that initial wave of 
coronavirus. 
That is all the more reason I hope my 
colleagues will join me in voting to 
waive the budget point of order, as well 
as the procedural votes that we will 
have this evening and the eventual pas-
sage of the legislation itself, the Great 
American Outdoors Act, which most 
likely will occur sometime Wednesday 
morning, maybe around noon or so. 
I am grateful for the support of peo-
ple like Teddy Roosevelt, great-grand-
son of President Roosevelt. I am grate-
ful for the support of my colleagues 
and the work of Senators HEINRICH, 
MANCHIN, CANTWELL, KING, and WAR-
NER, who have been so diligent across 
the past several months as this legisla-
tion moves its way to passage, and of 
RICHARD BURR, who has been an incred-
ible stalwart champion of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. I thank Sen-
ator ALEXANDER for his work. 
It goes to show you this didn’t hap-
pen alone. It didn’t happen in a vacu-
um. It didn’t happen because one per-
son or one party decided to get behind 
it. It happened because of a group ef-
fort of people in both Chambers and at 
the White House to support it. 
Today, the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce reiterated their support of this 
legislation. The American Petroleum 
Institute 
supports 
this 
legislation. 
Countless environmental and conserva-
tion organizations support this legisla-
tion. Some 850-plus groups support this 
legislation. 
We have an opportunity to do some-
thing good for our country, to do some-
thing good for future generations. 
With that, I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate be 
in a period of morning business, with

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JIM ROLLINS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Springdale 
Public 
School District superintendent Dr. Jim 
Rollins who will step down from his po-
sition at the end of June after decades 
of dedication to students, staff, and the 
community. 
He has spent his career improving 
education and scholastic opportunities 
for students for more than 39 years as 
superintendent. His dedication and pas-
sion for education grew in his years as 
a science teacher in North Little Rock. 
At the same time, he continued to pur-
sue advanced degrees in education at 
the University of Arkansas. He knew 
he wanted to help better the lives of 
students. 
During his tenure as superintendent 
in Springdale, he oversaw tremendous 
growth in the district. Enrollment has 
increased from 5,000 students in 1980 to 
more than 23,000 students today. He 
rose to meet the challenges of the 
flourishing student population by sup-
porting the construction of 22 schools 
and implementing innovative measures 
to provide the diverse student popu-
lation tools to succeed. 
Dr. Rollins has always made students 
a priority and emphasized this to 
teachers and staff with his motto ‘‘We 
Teach Them All.’’ 
He has distinguished himself as a key 
voice in education at the local, State,

and national level and has received 
many well-deserved honors for his 
work. The achievements he has accrued 
during his 50-year career in public edu-
cation include twice being named Ar-
kansas Superintendent of the Year and 
recognition as one of Education Week 
magazine’s 2017 ‘‘Leaders to Learn 
From.’’ Just recently, Dr. Rollins was 
awarded the 2020 Outstanding Alumnus 
Award in Education from the College of 
Education and Health Professionals at 
the University of Arkansas. His service 
as Arkansas’ representative on the U.S. 
Department 
of 
Education’s 
Super-
intendents Task Force is further evi-
dence of his expertise and the high re-
gard his peers and fellow educators 
hold for him. 
I congratulate Dr. Rollins for his out-
standing track record of ensuring stu-
dents have a solid educational founda-
tion to help them succeed in the fu-
ture. I appreciate his friendship and his 
excellent leadership which has resulted 
in academic improvement and growth 
for countless students. I wish him all 
the best in the next chapter of his ca-
reer as president of Northwest Tech-
nical Institute.∑

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL COREY A. 
SIMMONS 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to 
pay tribute to the outgoing commander 
of the 71st Flying Training Wing, 
Vance Air Force Base, OK, Col. Corey 
A. Simmons. Colonel Simmons led a 
wing of nearly 3,000 personnel who con-
ducted critical undergraduate pilot 
training for many of our young Air-
men. 
Corey has quite the resume, begin-
ning when he was commissioned in the 
Air Force in 1998 after he graduated 
from the University of Louisville. He 
earned a graduate degree in 2005 from 
the George Washington University and 
is a graduate of Air Command and 
Staff College. He successfully com-
pleted the SECDEF Executive leader-
ship Development Program and a Har-
vard University National Defense Fel-
lowship. 
In his interactions with both me and 
my staff, Corey always displayed a 
high level of professionalism and ac-
tively worked to advance various ini-
tiatives and reach solutions. He was 
ready and willing to collaborate on a 
task and helped me do my job by mak-
ing sure I knew the current status 
down at Vance. Corey’s leadership in-
stilled confidence in his airmen, and he 
laid critical groundwork for the future 
of the Enid community. 
Corey has been a dedicated leader in 
our Air Force, serving in Air Mobility 
Command as a vice wing commander, 
squadron commander, operations offi-
cer, C–17A instructor pilot, and aircraft 
commander. He has been stationed all 
around the country, but I am sure his 
favorite memories will be of his time 
spent at Altus and Vance Air Force 
Bases in Oklahoma. While Corey is an 
experienced pilot who has spent a re-
spectable amount of time flying. He 
still falls far short of me in terms of 
flight hours, but maybe someday he 
will get close. 
I want to wish Colonel Simmons the 
best of luck in his next assignment at 
Travis Air Force Base in California as 
the commander of the 60th Air Mobil-
ity Wing. This assignment speaks to 
the caliber of leader that he is, and I 
personally am grateful to him, his wife 
Dawn, and his children for their dedi-
cated service to our Nation, to the Air 
Force, and to the Enid community. 
Corey, best of luck.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 617—DESIG-
NATING JULY 22, 2020, AS ‘‘GLIO-
BLASTOMA AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Ms. MCSALLY, Ms. SINEMA, and 
Ms. WARREN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 617 
Whereas more than 13,000 new cases of glio-
blastoma will be diagnosed in the United 
States in 2020; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant (can-
cerous) brain tumor, accounting for 48 per-
cent of all primary malignant brain tumors; 
and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult 
to treat, and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 
10,000 individuals in the United States will 
succumb to glioblastoma every year; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glio-
blastoma patients is only 6.8 percent, and 
the average length of survival for glio-
blastoma patients is estimated to be only 12 
to 18 months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a dis-
ease that affects the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the 
treatment and removal of glioblastoma pre-
sents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the 
brain, the primary organ in the human body 
that controls not only cognitive ability, but 
also the actions of every organ and limb; 
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, 
brain cancer has— 
(1) the highest per-patient initial cost of 
care, with an annualized mean net cost of 
care approaching $150,000; and 
(2) the highest annualized mean net costs 
for last-year-of-life care, with a cost of be-
tween $135,000 and $210,000 per patient, de-
pending on the age and gender of a patient; 
Whereas, although research advances may 
fuel the development of new treatments for 
glioblastoma, challenging obstacles to accel-
erating progress toward new treatments for 
glioblastoma remain, and there are no 
screening or early detection methods; 
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first 
described in medical and scientific literature 
in the 1920s, and despite its devastating prog-
nosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device have 
been approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration to treat glioblastoma since the 
1920s, and the mortality rates associated 
with glioblastoma have changed little during 
the past 30 years; and 
Whereas there is a need for greater public 
awareness of glioblastoma, including aware-
ness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glio-
blastoma patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research and 
treatment advances for glioblastoma: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 22, 2020, as ‘‘Glio-
blastoma Awareness Day’’; 
(2) encourages increased public awareness 
of glioblastoma; 
(3) honors the individuals who have lost 
their lives to glioblastoma, a devastating 
disease, or are currently living with it; 
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the 
long-term prognosis of individuals diagnosed 
with glioblastoma; 
(5) expresses its support for the individuals 
who are battling brain tumors, as well as the 
families, friends, and caregivers of those in-
dividuals; and 
(6) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
tumor research, which is a promising means 
of advancing the understanding and treat-
ment of glioblastoma.

mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 618 
Whereas the brave men and women of the 
Armed Forces, who proudly serve the United 
States— 
(1) risk their lives to protect the freedom, 
health, and welfare of the people of the 
United States; and 
(2) deserve the investment of every pos-
sible resource to ensure their lasting phys-
ical, mental, and emotional well-being; 
Whereas, since the events of September 11, 
2001, nearly 2,800,000 members of the Armed 
Forces have deployed overseas and served in 
places such as Afghanistan and Iraq; 
Whereas the current generation of men and 
women in the Armed Forces has sustained a 
high rate of operational deployments, with 
many members of the Armed Forces serving 
overseas multiple times, placing those mem-
bers at high risk of enduring traumatic com-
bat stress; 
Whereas, when left untreated, exposure to 
traumatic combat stress can lead to severe 
and chronic post-traumatic stress responses, 
which are commonly referred to as post- 
traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘PTSD’’) or post-traumatic 
stress injury; 
Whereas many men and women of the 
Armed Forces and veterans who served be-
fore September 11, 2001, live with mental 
health needs from post-traumatic stress and 
remain at risk for responses to that stress; 
Whereas many post-traumatic stress re-
sponses remain unreported, undiagnosed, and 
untreated due to a lack of awareness about 
post-traumatic stress and the persistent 
stigma associated with mental health condi-
tions; 
Whereas 
post-traumatic 
stress 
signifi-
cantly increases the risk of post-traumatic 
stress responses, including anxiety, depres-
sion, homelessness, substance abuse, and sui-
cide, especially if left untreated; 
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
reports that— 
(1) between 11 and 20 percent of veterans 
who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or 
Operation Enduring Freedom have post-trau-
matic stress in a given year; 
(2) approximately 12 percent of veterans 
who served in the Persian Gulf War have 
post-traumatic stress in a given year; and 
(3) approximately 30 percent of veterans 
who served in the Vietnam era have had 
post-traumatic stress in their lifetimes; 
Whereas public perceptions of post-trau-
matic stress as a mental health disorder cre-
ate unique challenges for veterans seeking 
employment; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans 
service organizations, and the private and 
public medical community have made sig-
nificant advances in the identification, pre-
vention, diagnosis, and treatment of post- 
traumatic stress and the symptoms of post- 
traumatic stress, but many challenges re-
main; 
Whereas increased understanding of post- 
traumatic stress can help eliminate stigma 
attached to the mental health issues of post- 
traumatic stress; 
Whereas additional efforts are needed to 
find further ways to eliminate the stigma as-
sociated with post-traumatic stress, includ-
ing— 
(1) an examination of how post-traumatic 
stress is discussed in the United States; and 
(2) a recognition that post-traumatic stress 
is a common injury that is treatable; 
Whereas timely and appropriate treatment 
of post-traumatic stress responses can di-
minish complications and avert suicides; 
Whereas post-traumatic stress— 
(1) can result from any number of stressors 
other than combat, including rape, sexual as-
sault, battery, torture, confinement, child 
abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane 
crashes, bombings, natural disasters, or glob-
al pandemics; and 
(2) affects approximately 8,000,000 adults in 
the United States annually; 
Whereas traumatic events such as the 
COVID–19 pandemic could— 
(1) increase the number of individuals im-
pacted by post-traumatic stress; or 
(2) exacerbate the responses of post-trau-
matic stress; 
Whereas the diagnosis of PTSD was first 
defined by the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation in 1980 to commonly and more accu-
rately understand and treat survivors of 
physical and psychological trauma, includ-
ing veterans who had endured severe trau-
matic combat stress; 
Whereas the word ‘‘disorder’’ can perpet-
uate the stigma associated with combat 
stress, so the more general term ‘‘post-trau-
matic stress’’ is often preferred; and 
Whereas the designation of a National 
Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month and 
a National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness 
Day raises public awareness about issues re-
lating to post-traumatic stress, reduces the 
stigma 
associated 
with 
post-traumatic 
stress, and helps ensure that individuals suf-
fering from the invisible wounds of war re-
ceive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates— 
(A) June 2020 as ‘‘National Post-Traumatic 
Stress Awareness Month’’; and 
(B) June 27, 2020, as ‘‘National Post-Trau-
matic Stress Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense,

traumatic stress; 
(3) supports efforts by the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of De-
fense to foster— 
(A) cultural change around the issue of 
post-traumatic stress; and 
(B) understanding that personal inter-

resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 620 
Whereas news of the end of slavery did not 
reach the frontier areas of the United States, 
in particular the State of Texas and the 
other Southwestern States, until months 
after the conclusion of the Civil War, more 
than 21⁄2 years after President Abraham Lin-
coln issued the Emancipation Proclamation 
on January 1, 1863; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, 
led by Major General Gordon Granger, ar-
rived in Galveston, Texas, with news that 
the Civil War had ended and the enslaved 
were free; 
Whereas African Americans who had been 
slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19, 
commonly known as ‘‘Juneteenth Independ-
ence Day’’, as inspiration and encourage-
ment for future generations; 
Whereas 
African 
Americans 
from 
the 
Southwest have continued the tradition of 
observing Juneteenth Independence Day for 
more than 150 years; 
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day 
began as a holiday in the State of Texas and 
is now celebrated in 46 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia as a special day of observ-
ance in recognition of the emancipation of 
all slaves in the United States; 
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day 
celebrations have been held to honor Afri-
can-American freedom while encouraging 
self-development and respect for all cultures; 
Whereas the faith and strength of char-
acter demonstrated by former slaves and the 
descendants of former slaves remain an ex-
ample for all people of the United States, re-
gardless of background, religion, or race; 
Whereas slavery was not officially abol-
ished until the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States in December 1865; and 
Whereas, over the course of its history, the 
United States has grown into a symbol of de-
mocracy and freedom around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 19, 2020, as ‘‘Juneteenth 
Independence Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the historical significance of 
Juneteenth Independence Day to the United 
States; 
(3) supports the continued nationwide cele-
bration of Juneteenth Independence Day to 
provide an opportunity for the people of the 
United States to learn more about the past 
and to better understand the experiences 
that have shaped the United States; and 
(4) recognizes that the observance of the 
end of slavery is part of the history and her-

SENATE RESOLUTION 621—DESIG-
NATING 
JUNE 
15, 
2020, 
AS 
‘‘WORLD ELDER ABUSE AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. COLLINS, Mr. WYDEN, 
Mr. TILLIS, Mr. CASEY, and Ms. ERNST) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 621 
Whereas, in 2006, the International Net-
work for the Prevention of Elder Abuse pro-
claimed June 15th of each year as ‘‘World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day’’; 
Whereas approximately 55,000,000 residents 
of the United States, or about 1 in every 6 in-
dividuals, have attained the age of 65 on the 
15th anniversary of World Elder Abuse 
Awareness Day in 2020; 
Whereas elder abuse can come in many dif-
ferent forms, often manifesting as physical, 
sexual, or psychological abuse, financial ex-
ploitation, neglect, and social media abuse; 
Whereas elder abuse, neglect, and exploi-
tation have no boundaries and cross all ra-
cial, social, class, gender, and geographic 
lines, according to the Elder Justice Coali-
tion; 
Whereas more than 1 in 10 individuals in 
the United States over the age of 60 have 
been subjected to abuse each year, with 
many such victims enduring abuse in mul-
tiple forms, according to the American Jour-
nal of Public Health; 
Whereas most reported cases of abuse, ne-
glect, and exploitation of older adults take 
place within private homes, and approxi-
mately 90 percent of the perpetrators in 
elder financial exploitation cases are family 
members or other trusted individuals, ac-
cording to the National Adult Protective 
Services Association; 
Whereas research suggests that elderly in-
dividuals in the United States who experi-
ence cognitive impairment, physical disabil-
ities, and isolation are more likely to be-
come the victims of abuse than those with-
out disabilities; 
Whereas other risk factors for elder abuse 
can include low social support, poor physical 
health, and experience of previous traumatic 
events, according to the National Center on 
Elder Abuse; 
Whereas close to half of elderly individuals 
who suffer from dementia will experience 
abuse during their lifetime, according to the 
Department of Justice; 
Whereas only a small fraction of elder 
abuse cases are reported to the authorities; 
Whereas there is a need to increase funding 
for adult protective services programs with 
the capacity to aid victims, investigate re-
ports of abuse, and actively prevent future 
victimization, particularly during the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic, as the social isola-
tion of elderly individuals due to stay-at- 
home orders only increases the risk of abuse 
and neglect; 
Whereas the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic 
has fueled demand for programs such as 
State long-term care ombudsman programs, 
which help prevent elder abuse and neglect 
in nursing homes and other long-term care 
facilities, where infection prevention and 
control deficiencies pose persistent chal-
lenges; 
Whereas 2020 marks the 10th anniversary of 
the passage of the Elder Justice Act (subtitle 
H of title VI of Public Law 111–148) and the 
3rd anniversary of the passage of the Elder 
Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (Pub-
lic Law 115–70); 
Whereas public awareness of elder abuse 
has the potential to increase the identifica-
tion and reporting of this crime by the pub-
lic, professionals, and victims, and can act as 
a catalyst to promote issue-based education 
and long-term prevention; and 
Whereas private individuals and public 
agencies in the United States must work to-
gether at the Federal, State, and local levels 
to 
combat 
abuse, 
neglect, 
exploitation, 
crime, 
and 
violence 
against 
vulnerable 
adults, including vulnerable older adults, 
particularly in light of limited resources for 
vital protective services: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 15, 2020, as ‘‘World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day’’; 
(2) recognizes judges, lawyers, adult pro-
tective services professionals, law enforce-
ment officers, State long-term care ombuds-
men, social workers, health care providers,

(3) encourages members of the public and 
professionals who work with older adults to 
act as catalysts to promote awareness and 
long-term prevention of elder abuse— 
(A) by reaching out to local adult protec-
tive services agencies, State long-term care 
ombudsman programs, and the National Cen-
ter on Elder Abuse; and 
(B) by learning to recognize, detect, report, 
and respond to elder abuse; and

Ms. CANTWELL, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
SANDERS, Mr. COONS, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. CASEY, and Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR)) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 622 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States provides the 
basis of the freedom of the press and peaceful 
assembly in the United States, stating ‘‘Con-
gress shall make no law. . .abridging the 
freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 
right of the people peaceably to assem-
ble. . .’’; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who recognized 
the importance of the press in a constitu-
tional republic, wisely declared, ‘‘. . .were it 
left to me to decide whether we should have 
a government without newspapers, or news-
papers without a government, I should not 
hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.’’; 
Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
adopted in Paris on December 10, 1948, states, 
‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opin-
ion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference 
and to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas through any media and regardless 
of frontiers.’’; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United 
Nations General Assembly adopted United 
Nations General Assembly Resolution 163 
(2013) on the safety of journalists and the 
issue of impunity, which unequivocally con-
demns, in both conflict and non-conflict situ-
ations, all attacks on and violence against 
journalists and media workers, including 
torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced dis-
appearance, arbitrary detention, and intimi-
dation and harassment; 
Whereas, according to the U.S. Press Free-
dom Tracker, a nonpartisan website led by 
the Freedom of the Press Foundation and 
the Committee to Protect Journalists, not 
less than 328 press freedom violations by 
local and State authorities have been re-
ported by journalists across the United 
States in the course of covering the dem-
onstrations associated with the death of 
George Floyd, a Black man, while he was in 
Minneapolis police custody; 
Whereas Kirstin McCudden, managing edi-
tor of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, de-
scribed the uptick in reports of violations of 
freedom of the press in the United States be-
tween May 25 and June 3, 2020, as ‘‘unprece-
dented in scope without a doubt.’’; 
Whereas Joel Simon, executive director of 
the Committee to Protect Journalists, wrote 
that ‘‘[c]overing protests and demonstra-
tions is vital, both in order to inform the 
public about the demands of the protesters 
and also to hold officials accountable.’’; and 
Whereas more than 100 media and press 
freedom organizations, led by the Reporters 
Committee for Freedom of the Press, signed 
a letter demanding that law enforcement of-
ficers immediately stop attacks against 
credentialed, clearly identifiable journalists 
and stressed that law enforcement officers do 
not have legal immunity when they violate 
clearly established rights under the First 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to the free-
dom of the press and peaceful assembly as 
pillars of democracy in the United States; 
(2) condemns in the strongest terms vio-
lence committed against people of the 
United States exercising their right to free 
speech and peaceful assembly, including 
journalists and members of the media, 
whether that violence is committed by gov-
ernment officials or anyone else; 
(3) condemns in the strongest terms ac-
tions on the part of any local, State, or Fed-
eral authorities to limit, restrict, or in any 
way prevent members of the media from— 
(A) performing their jobs, which contribute 
to the distribution of vital information; 
(B) promoting government accountability; 
(C) defending democratic activity; and 
(D) strengthening civil society; 
(4) recognizes the bravery and courage of 
the journalists of the United States, foreign 
journalists, and members of the media who 
put their own safety at risk in order to cover 
the demonstrations associated with the 
death of George Floyd and bring information 
to the people of the United States and the 
world; 
(5) calls on local, State, and Federal au-
thorities to— 
(A) take steps to ensure that members of 
the media are able to safely perform their 
duties 
without 
interference, 
censorship, 
threats of violence, or physical harm; and 
(B) explicitly exempt the news media from 
any curfew regulations; and 
(6) calls on local, State, and Federal au-
thorities and officials to— 
(A) identify and thoroughly investigate in-
stances in which— 
(i) government officials or members of po-
lice forces have restricted media access to 
the demonstrations associated with the 
death of George Floyd; or 
(ii) violence was perpetrated against mem-
bers of the media during those demonstra-
tions; and 
(B) ensure that the perpetrators of violence 
against the media are appropriately dis-
ciplined and, if appropriate, charged.

PROVIDING 
ASSISTANCE 
FOR 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND 
NATIONALS TAKEN HOSTAGE OR 
UNLAWFULLY OR WRONGFULLY 
DETAINED ABROAD 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 462, S. 712. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 712) to provide assistance for 
United States citizens and nationals taken 
hostage or unlawfully or wrongfully detained 
abroad, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, with an amend-
ment and an amendment to the title. 
(Strike all after the enacting clause 
and insert the part printed in italic.) 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Robert Levinson 
Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Account-
ability Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR UNITED STATES NA-
TIONALS UNLAWFULLY OR WRONG-
FULLY DETAINED ABROAD. 
(a) REVIEW.—The Secretary of State shall re-
view the cases of United States nationals de-
tained abroad to determine if there is credible 
information that they are being detained unlaw-
fully or wrongfully, based on criteria which 
may include whether— 
(1) United States officials receive or possess 
credible information indicating innocence of the 
detained individual; 
(2) the individual is being detained solely or 
substantially because he or she is a United 
States national; 
(3) the individual is being detained solely or 
substantially to influence United States Govern-
ment policy or to secure economic or political 
concessions from the United States Government; 
(4) the detention appears to be because the in-
dividual sought to obtain, exercise, defend, or 
promote freedom of the press, freedom of reli-
gion, or the right to peacefully assemble; 
(5) the individual is being detained in viola-
tion of the laws of the detaining country; 
(6) independent nongovernmental organiza-
tions or journalists have raised legitimate ques-
tions about the innocence of the detained indi-
vidual; 
(7) the United States mission in the country 
where the individual is being detained has re-
ceived credible reports that the detention is a 
pretext for an illegitimate purpose; 
(8) the individual is detained in a country 
where the Department of State has determined 
in its annual human rights reports that the ju-
dicial system is not independent or impartial, is 
susceptible to corruption, or is incapable of ren-
dering just verdicts; 
(9) the individual is being detained in inhu-
mane conditions; 
(10) due process of law has been sufficiently 
impaired so as to render the detention arbitrary; 
and 
(11) United States diplomatic engagement is 
likely necessary to secure the release of the de-
tained individual. 
(b) REFERRALS TO THE SPECIAL ENVOY.—Upon 
a determination by the Secretary of State, based 
on the totality of the circumstances, that there 
is credible information that the detention of a 
United States national abroad is unlawful or 
wrongful, and regardless of whether the deten-
tion is by a foreign government or a nongovern-
mental actor, the Secretary shall transfer re-
sponsibility for such case from the Bureau of 
Consular Affairs of the Department of State to 
the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs created 
pursuant to section 3. 
(c) REPORT.— 
(1) ANNUAL REPORT.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State shall 
submit to the appropriate congressional commit-
tees an annual report with respect to United 
States nationals for whom the Secretary deter-
mines there is credible information of unlawful 
or wrongful detention abroad. 
(B) FORM.—The report required under this 
paragraph shall be submitted in unclassified

essary. 
(2) COMPOSITION.—The report required under 
paragraph (1) shall include current estimates of 
the number of individuals so detained, as well 
as relevant information about particular cases, 
such as— 
(A) the name of the individual, unless the pro-
vision of such information is inconsistent with 
section 552a of title 5, United States Code (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Privacy Act of 1974’’); 
(B) basic facts about the case; 
(C) a summary of the information that such 
individual may be detained unlawfully or 
wrongfully; 
(D) a description of specific efforts, legal and 
diplomatic, taken on behalf of the individual 
since the last reporting period, including a de-
scription of accomplishments and setbacks; and 
(E) a description of intended next steps. 
(d) RESOURCE GUIDANCE.— 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act and

source guidance in writing for government offi-
cials and families of unjustly or wrongfully de-
tained individuals. 
(2) CONTENT.—The resource guidance required 
under paragraph (1) should include— 
(A) information to help families understand

United States nationals unlawfully or wrong-
fully held abroad;

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND LOUIS P. 
SHELDON 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an individual, Reverend Louis P. 
Sheldon, who passed away at the age of 85 
on May 29, 2020 in Orange County, California. 
Born in Washington, D.C. in 1934, Sheldon 
became a Christian in his teens and earned a 
B.S. in history from Michigan State University 
in 1957. Sheldon and his wife, Beverly, mar-
ried on August 24, 1957 and had four children. 
In 1960, Sheldon was ordained a Presbyterian 
minister. He would go on to serve as a pastor 
for churches in North Dakota and California. 
After spending 52 years in the Presbyterian 
church, Sheldon left in 2012 and was ordained 
as an Anglican priest. 
Throughout his life Sheldon was a grass-
roots religious organizer and active advocate 
on many social and religious liberty issues in 
Washington, D.C. On many issues, Sheldon 
built coalitions encompassing hundreds, if not 
thousands, of churches across the nation. He 
was also a vocal proponent of Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas during his nomina-
tion process, organizing the support of many 
churches and religious leaders. 
I had the pleasure of knowing Sheldon 
throughout my time serving in Congress. He 
was a tremendously patriotic man of faith. I 
extend my heartfelt condolences to the Shel-
don family and to all those who knew Rev. 
Sheldon.

HONORING IZAAH KNOX AS THE 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing lzaah Knox, community leader 
and Executive Director of Des Moines’ own 
Urban Dreams, as our Iowan of the Week. 
Service for the betterment of others is more 
than a hallmark of lzaah’s career: it’s his life-
style. He’s the epitome of a ‘‘walk the walk’’ 
leader—involved in all manners of activities in-
tended to educate, empower, and raise up in-
dividuals in his community. 
In his role as Executive Director of Urban 
Dreams, he leads a team of similarly dedi-
cated Iowans within the heart of urban Des 
Moines to provide human service programs to 
the underserved and underrepresented. The 
non-profit offers critical services like outpatient 
substance abuse treatment and OWI weekend 
diversion classes, employment and after- 
school IT programs, community-police rela-
tions initiatives, mental health treatment, and 
nonpartisan voter education. They’re currently 
working on a project to build a community 
park adjacent to the Urban Dreams building so 
neighbors can gather, celebrate, and engage 
with one another. Despite narrow operating 
margins and much to do, lzaah is consistently 
finding ways to strengthen and expand pro-
gramming to serve more Iowans in need. 
Outside of Urban Dreams, lzaah sits on 
many boards and commissions working to 
raise awareness and combat issues of pov-
erty, substance abuse, racial injustice, and 
urban blight. He’s a past chair and current 
commissioner on the Des Moines Human and 
Civil Rights Commission, a Social Capital Tri- 
Chair for the Capital Crossroads project to ad-
dress diversity and inclusion within metro Des 
Moines, and a board member for The Guard-
ian Project to strengthen ties between Des 
Moines Police officers and community mem-
bers. While there are more formal roles to 
mention, I’d rather note how lzaah also 
spends mornings having breakfast with stu-
dents at Des Moines North High School. His 
efforts to make meaningful connections and 
address tough issues head on are leadership 
in action. 
This honor today is hardly the first to recog-
nize the unique determination and impact of 
lzaah Knox. In 2012, he was awarded the 
United States of America President’s Volun-
teer Service Award, and in 2013 he was 
named one of Iowa’s most influential people 
by the Des Moines Register. In 2016 he be-
came one of the Des Moines Business 
Record’s Forty Under 40. Central Iowa is 
watching this leader grow and recognizing his 
accomplishments along the way, and for very 
good reason. 
Our future as a nation depends on the 
strength of our neighborhoods and commu-
nities; that’s never been more evident than 
during these past few months. As COVID–19 
spread, lzaah and the Urban Dreams team 
kept serving those in need by giving away 
free, hot meals in Evelyn K. Davis Park, pro-
viding mental health and substance abuse 
services through telehealth, and meeting in 
smaller groups to continue workforce training. 
And as protesters took to the streets following 
George Floyd’s murder, lzaah has been there 
night after night to protect and support the 
youth voices leading the movement. His 
steady presence and dedication are helping 
guide Des Moines through these uncertain 
times. 
Advocates like lzaah—those who are pas-
sionate about lifelong learning, connecting with 
people, and doing the work—are our most val-
uable agents of change. They push all of us 
to reflect on where we can be giving more of 
ourselves to make things better for those 
around us. We need people like lzaah to keep 
us moving forward. We need organizations 
like Urban Dreams to thrive so the individuals 
they serve can meet their highest potential. 
When we lift up one another, the whole com-
munity does better. That’s something lzaah 
Knox not only understands, but also em-
bodies, and it is my distinct honor to recognize 
him as our Iowan of the Week. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE PLASTIC 
WASTE REDUCTION AND RECY-
CLING ACT 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to introduce the Plastic Waste Reduc-
tion and Recycling Act with my colleague Rep-
resentative GONZALEZ, as well as Chairwoman 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON and Ranking Member 
FRANK LUCAS, who have joined us as leading 
cosponsors of this bipartisan bill. 
Plastic is invaluable in many applications. 
It’s used as a high-performance material for 
medical devices and in safety components for 
automobiles. Plastic is also convenient. It’s a 
mainstay in American households from our 
toothbrushes to food storage to shampoo and 
detergent bottles. Global plastic production in-
creased from 2 million tons per year in 1950 
to 400 million tons annually in recent years. 
What happens to all of the discarded plastic is 
why I am introducing this legislation today. 
We can no longer deny that we face a plas-
tic waste crisis. In 2018, the U.S. woke up to 
the fragile predicament of our plastic waste 
management system. No longer able to ship 
our plastic waste to international markets, U.S. 
cities were forced to cut longstanding recycling 
programs. Instead, they had to resort to incin-
erating recyclables or tossing them in landfills. 
There are plenty of reasons for why and how 
we got here; however, a major factor is be-
cause we failed as a nation to invest in do-
mestic recycling infrastructure and policies to 
account for the growing demand for plastic. As 
a result, today, the U.S. recycles just 9 per-
cent of its plastic waste. 
The Plastic Waste Reduction and Recycling 
Act directs the establishment of a plastic 
waste reduction and recycling research and 
development program to develop a world-lead-
ing U.S. industry in advanced plastics recy-
cling technologies, and unleash the innovative 
potential of our nation to address our plastic 
waste crisis and generate greater value from 
the plastics we do produce. 
This approach has the potential to create 
jobs, develop supply chains, and meet envi-
ronmental needs. 
Most notably, this legislation authorizes re-
search and development across several agen-
cies and a range of topics, including plastics 
that are recyclable by design, next generation 
recycling technologies, upcycling into high- 
value products, and environmental impacts of 
plastic waste. This bill also calls on the Fed-
eral government to develop a strategic plan for 
plastic waste reduction and recycling and plas-
tic waste remediation and to develop partner-
ships with States, local governments, aca-
demia, industry, and international partners to 
achieve those goals. 
Finally, this legislation would help ensure 
U.S. leadership in national and international 
research and standards development for plas-
tics recycling technologies. Advanced sorting

technologies and updated standards are ur-
gently needed for characterizing the multi-
layered plastic packaging materials used 
today. Most consumers are not even aware 
that many of these materials are not easily re-
cycled by most local materials recovery facili-
ties, which just exacerbates the challenges for 
the facilities, even as consumers are trying to 
do their part. 
This bill alone will not solve the plastic 
waste crisis in this country, but it is an essen-
tial and important step. Supporting this bill is 
an investment in our recycling industry and a 
demonstration of our recommitment to Amer-
ican manufacturing jobs and the ingenuity so 
very much needed at this time in our nation’s 
history. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan bill and see it signed into law.

HONORING 
NANCY 
ROSSMAN, 
A 
CHAMPION FOR THE MINNESOTA 
RECOVERY COMMUNITY 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career of Nancy Rossman of the 
Central Minnesota Mental Health Center 
(CMMHC). For over sixteen years, Nancy has 
served as the Program Director for the cen-
ter’s Detox Program and designated Reg-
istered Nurse for their Crisis Program. 
Nancy joined CMMHC in 1972 after com-
pleting her nursing degree at the College of 
St. Benedict in St. Joseph. Since then, Nancy 
has dedicated what can only be described as 
a lifetime of service to CMMHC and the Detox 
Program, acting as a community-based case 
manager to patients in need. 
Nancy’s career spans the Detox Program’s 
whole lifetime, and indeed, Nancy is the pro-
gram’s ‘‘unofficial historian.’’ Her work has not 
only impacted countless patients, but also 
given them the greatest possible gift—a sec-
ond chance at life. 
I congratulate Nancy on her retirement. I 
have no doubt her commitment to CMMHC 
will be touching patients for years to come. I 
thank her and hope she enjoys her well- 
earned retirement.

IN HONOR OF ANTHONY PHILIP 
ANDREOTTI OF CANTON, MASSA-
CHUSETTS 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Anthony (Tony) Philip Andreotti, in 
recognition of his outstanding contributions to 
his hometown of Canton, Massachusetts, and 
to commend him for over 50 years of dedi-
cated service to his community and our coun-
try. 
The son of Angelina and Carmine Andreotti, 
immigrants from Naples, Italy, Tony was born 
on May 22, 1933, on Staten Island in New 
York. The family moved to Canton in 1935 
where Tony attended St. John’s Elementary 
School and graduated from Canton High 
School in 1951. In 1953, Tony was drafted 
into the United States Army, serving in both 
Korea and Japan before he was honorably 
discharged in 1955. Upon completion of his 
military service, Tony attended Burdett College 
in Boston and earned an associate degree in 
accounting in 1957. Subsequently, he worked 
at Norfolk County Trust until 1960 and Crosby 
Valve from 1960 until 1983. In 1981, Tony 
was elected to the Board of Selectmen in 
Canton and also served as Town Treasurer. In 
addition to his elective service, Tony served 
on the Board of Directors at Norwood Hos-
pital, serving as Chairman from 1996 until 
1998. 
Madam Speaker, Tony has made his big-
gest impact by advocating for veterans. He 
was appointed Veterans’ Agent in Canton in 
1999, a position he held for over 20 years. His 
relentless pursuit of benefits for veterans is 
legendary and his accomplishments are many. 
Tony created the Veterans’ Memorial Park at 
Canton Corner Cemetery, consolidating vet-
erans’ monuments dispersed throughout Can-
ton into one location. Tony also organized a 
Legion Walk of Honor in Canton, complete 
with bricks engraved with the names of the 77 
Canton residents who died while serving our 
country during the Civil War, WWI, WWII, the 
Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq 
War. Tony also founded the Fallen Heroes 
Street Sign Program, a local initiative honoring 
the same 77 residents who made the ultimate 
sacrifice. Furthermore, Tony established a Fu-
neral Honor Guard which presides at veterans’ 
funerals 
throughout 
Massachusetts, 
and 
worked tirelessly to ensure that Canton resi-
dents who left high school early to serve in the 
armed forces, received their diplomas upon re-
turning. Quite simply, Tony is perhaps the 
most effective and most dedicated Veterans’ 
Agent in the Commonwealth of Massachu-
setts, if not the entire United States of Amer-
ica. 
Tony has had the good fortune to have 
been married to Patricia for 35 years. They 
are the proud parents of two sons, David and 
James. On October 26, 2019, the Town of 
Canton dedicated the roadway in front of Vet-
erans’ Memorial Park to Tony, naming it 
Andreotti Way. Generations to come will know 
of Tony’s contributions to the Town of Canton. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
join with Tony Andreotti’s family, friends and 
contemporaries to thank him for his remark-
able service to his town of Canton and to the 
United States of America.

IN RECOGNITION OF BATTALION 
CHIEF DAVID LAMBRIX FOR A 
DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER 
WITH 
THE DEARBORN FIRE DEPART-
MENT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Battalion Chief David Lambrix as he cele-
brates his retirement and recognize his many 
years of distinguished service with the Dear-
born Fire Department. His contributions to the 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Battalion Chief David Lambrix joined the 
Dearborn Fire Department as a firefighter on 
September 6th, 1994. Throughout his twenty- 
five years with the force, Lambrix rose through 
the ranks of firefighter, fire lieutenant, and 
captain. In 2017, Lambrix was promoted to 
battalion chief, and has held the position ever 
since. Among his friends, colleagues, and 
peers, Lambrix is recognized as a humble 
leader who strives to make a difference with-
out seeking praise or recognition for any of his 
significant accomplishments. 
Prior to his career with the fire department, 
David Lambrix dutifully served his country. He 
served as an EM2 in the U.S. Navy from 1984 
to 1988 in Alamenda, California. Without a 
doubt, Lambrix understands what it means to 
be an active and loyal community member. He 
devotes himself to causes he believes in and 
has made a difference in all the lives he has 
touched. Lambrix has received numerous hon-
ors and accolades for his outstanding work in-
cluding the Fire Chief Life Saving Award, the 
Perfect Attendance Award, and the Meritorious 
Service Award, among a host of others. Most 
recently, Lambrix was bestowed the John D. 
Dingell Medal of Freedom Memorial Com-
mendation in 2019 for his dedicated career in 
public service and commitment to Dearborn. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the retirement of Battalion 
Chief David Lambrix from the Dearborn Fire 
Department. I am proud to honor his work, ac-
complishments, and significant community im-
pact. We thank him for his outstanding service 
and wish him the best of luck in his future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR MIKE 
WALSH’S 24 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Mayor Mike 
Walsh of De Pere, Wisconsin. 
Mr. Walsh has served his community faith-
fully as mayor since 1996, after 14 years on 
the city’s Park Board. A De Pere native, Mike 
Walsh brought valuable experience and a 
community-based approach with him to the 
mayor’s office that helped him better serve the 
people of his hometown. 
Over the course of Mike Walsh’s 24–year 
tenure as mayor, he revitalized De Pere’s in-
frastructure and recreational sites, drawing on 
his experience from the city’s Park Board. One 
of Mr. Walsh’s most notable accomplishments 
was the creation of the scenic De Pere 
Riverwalk, which led to new housing develop-
ments and increased use of the Fox River 
Trail. Mr. Walsh also facilitated the develop-
ment of both the city’s east and west sides 
and championed the reconstruction of the his-
toric Claude Allouez Memorial Bridge. 
As the City of De Pere’s economy grew 
under Mayor Walsh’s leadership, so did the 
number of people eager to move to the area. 
He oversaw the city’s population growth from 
16,000 in 1990, to 25,000 by the time he left 
office this April. 
Mayor Walsh’s devoted leadership to the 
City of De Pere will be remembered by a 
grateful community. In his retirement, he is 
looking forward to spending more time with his 
grandchildren.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAJOR 
GENERAL CLINTON CROSIER 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize Major General Clinton E. 
Crosier, United States Space Force. 
On Friday, December 20, 2019, President 
Donald Trump signed into law the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2020, creating the sixth branch of the United 
States Armed Forces, the United States 
Space Force. This was a historic moment; a 
watershed step to increasing our ability to pro-
tect and defend the American way of life. I can 
say, without a doubt, this would not have hap-
pened as swiftly and smoothly as it did without 
Clint’s leadership as Director of the DOD 
Space Force Planning Task Force. 
So how did a boy from Iowa grow up to help 
create the Space Force? Well, while he was 
traveling the world with his military family, he 
always had his eyes on the sky. When he 
began his collegiate education at Iowa State, 
he undertook a really easy major, aerospace 
engineering, and then sought out a commis-
sion in the United States Air Force in 1988 
where he ultimately wound up flying satellites 
and launching rockets. 
He quickly earned top honors in multiple 
space training schools and developed satellite- 
commanding processes that became the new 
Air Force standard. He then served in the 
United States Senate where he authored key 
Congressional language that improved the na-
tional space enterprise, and in the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense he was main inter-
face to the National Security Council, charged 
with rebalancing America’s space intelligence 
architecture. As the signature authority for 
dozens of international agreements with Allies, 
he improved United States space capabilities, 
and represented the United States at key 
meetings with North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and United Nations. 
With this breadth of experience, it’s no won-
der he was selected as the lead planner for 
the 
Presidentially-directed 
United 
States 
Space Force, coordinating efforts to shape the 
Congressional authorization of the first new 
military service in 72 years. Together with his 
team, he led the development of; the macro- 
organizational design, the stand-up of the ini-
tial force elements, the funding and manpower 
requirements, and the implementation of the 
policies and processes that governed the es-
tablishment of the United States Space Force. 
His military awards include the Bronze Star 
combat medal for a yearlong deployment to 
the Middle East, the National Reconnaissance 
Office Director’s Gold Medal, the Iowa State 
University Aerospace Engineering Department 
Distinguished Alumni Award, and the Lance P. 
Sijan Leadership award. This career of acco-
lades is only possibly through the incredible 
support of his family: his wife, Mrs. Shelle Cro-
sier, and their three children: Clint, Stephanie 
and Kellie, along with six grandchildren. 
Major General Crosier distinguished himself 
over 33 years of military service, representing 
the United States of America with the highest 
honor and distinction. Major General Crosier, 
as the ‘‘architect of the Space Force,’’ is an in-
spiration for all of us who stand ready to serve 
our great country. We are grateful for his 
unique vision and commitment. I thank Major 
General Crosier. America will continue to de-
fend the highest ground, and the Space Force 
will thrive, because of your noble efforts.

CONGRATULATING RICK KLEVEN 
ON A WELL-EARNED RETIREMENT 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to-
gether with my colleague from Minnesota Rep-
resentative CRAIG
to congratulate Richard 
‘‘Rick’’ Kleven on his retirement at the end of 
June after more than 39 years with Thrivent. 
Throughout his nearly four decades of service 
with Thrivent, Rick has become a pillar of the 
Twin Cities community, leading Thrivent’s gov-
ernment affairs efforts to educate federal and 
state policymakers about the important role 
that fraternal benefit societies play in society, 
helping people achieve financial security and 
live generous lives through important chari-
table and volunteer efforts that include dis-
aster relief, partnering with organizations that 
address housing insecurity, and tens of thou-
sands of individual service projects. These ef-
forts have had a great impact not just in my 
district, but for the entire region and nation. 
Rick’s dedication, commitment, and enthu-
siasm for Thrivent’s unique mission—con-
necting insurance protection with community 
service—has been inspiring to watch and work 
with him on; for me, both during my time serv-
ing in the U.S. Congress and the Minnesota 
state House of Representatives. 
A lifelong Minnesotan and proud ‘‘Iron- 
Ranger’’ who grew up in Grand Rapids, MN, 
Rick is a true Minnesota sports team fan, par-
ticularly a diehard for our Vikings. He received 
his J.D. from the University of Minnesota Law 
School and his B.A. from the University of 
Minnesota—Duluth. Rick has led Thrivent’s 
Government Affairs activities for more than 17 
years, and served previously in a number of 
roles as legal counsel and manager of cor-
porate legal functions within the organization 
through his long arc of service which began in 
1981 when Thrivent was Lutheran Brother-
hood. 
Rick has been a great advocate on policy 
matters on Thrivent’s behalf, but also walks 
the walk of Thrivent’s mission of service— 
something he learned from both of his par-
ents, including his Dad who was awarded 
Itasca County’s Outstanding Senior Volunteer 
of the Year in 2018. Rick has volunteered as 
a Big Brother, served as a board member for 
multiple nonprofit organizations, and epito-
mizes the ubiquitous Thrivent T-shirt that says 
‘‘Live Generously.’’ Recently, he served as 
Chairman of the Board of Gilda’s Club Twin 
Cities, and played a crucial role in helping to 
raise money to build the organization’s club-
house that provides support for people with 
cancer as well as their families and friends. 
Rick also served for 8 years on the board of 
Person to Person, a charitable organization 
that operates Meals on Wheels and various 
other programs to help the needy in the Twin 
Cities area. He also was part of the original 
start-up board of FINNEGANS, the first beer 
company in the world to donate 100 percent of 
profits back to local food shelves. Rick cur-
rently sits on the board of the American Fra-
ternal Alliance, the nationwide coalition of not- 
for-profit fraternal benefit societies. 
I, along with many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, including Representative 
CRAIG who represents Rick’s hometown of 
Eagan, will miss seeing him here in Wash-
ington. I’m sure his friendly face and open 
heart will remain a pivotal part of the Twin Cit-
ies community for a long time to come. We 
wish him all the best and hope in retirement 
he can continue to indulge in his favorite hob-
bies: making the world better for his wife, two 
Aussies, and fellow Minnesotans as well as 
finding even more ways to support Rock n’ 
Roll! Congratulations, Rick—Here Comes the 
Sun.

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ ALAN 
STOCKTON 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual, Bob Stockton, who passed away at 
the age of 66 on May 13, 2020. Bob was a 
loving husband, father, grandfather, and one 
of Riverside County’s most dedicated public 
servants. He will be deeply missed. 
Bob was a southern California native, born 
in San Diego on December 20, 1953, the son 
of Robert and Beverly Stockton. He earned his 
Bachelor of Science degree in Construction 
Engineering from California Polytechnic Uni-
versity, Pomona in 1978. Bob married the love 
of his life, Kelli Tyson, 16 years ago and be-
tween the two of them they have five wonder-
ful children and four grandchildren. Kelli and 
Bob loved to travel, and Hawaii was at the top 
of their list. Some of their greatest adventures 
while traveling include riding a portion of the 
Tour de France route in 2004 and being bap-
tized in the Jordan River in Israel by friend 
and pastor, Matt Brown in 2015. 
To merely say Bob was a tireless advocate 
for Riverside County would not do him justice. 
He served on more organizations that I can 
name here, but they include: the Monday 
Morning Group; the Greater Riverside Cham-
ber of Commerce; Leadership Riverside; Cali-
fornia Baptist University; Path of Life Min-
istries; the American Heart Association; the 
East Hills Chamber; and Western Municipal 
Water District. He also was a leader of his 
son’s Boy Scout troop and ‘‘The Prop Guy’’ for 
his daughter’s dance studio. He managed to 
do all of this while serving as the Vice Presi-
dent and Principal-in-Charge at Rick Engineer-
ing Company. He was, as Rusty Bailey, Bob’s 
friend and the current Mayor of Riverside 
would say, a ‘‘true saint of Riverside.’’ 
Bob’s service to the organizations in our 
community is matched only by his dedication

to the individuals within them. He lived his life 
motto of ‘‘Work Hard, Play Hard, Pray Hard’’ 
each and every day. Bob was passionate 
about training and coaching athletes and help-
ing his friends and family achieve any of their 
goals. He coached the Woodcrest Christian 
Mountain Bike Team and helped train anyone 
who asked in preparation for Ironman chal-
lenges, triathlons, half-marathons, and Cat-
alina SOK runs, to name only a few competi-
tions he loved. When Bob wasn’t racing him-
self, he could be found cheering on the side-
lines for anyone striving to reach their goals. 
I had the pleasure of knowing Bob through 
his service to Riverside County and can per-
sonally attest to the countless lives he 
touched. He was a great American, an es-
teemed leader, a respected mentor and a 
dedicated husband, father, and friend. I extend 
my heartfelt condolences to Kelli, to their chil-
dren, Nathan, Heather, Adam, Travis, and 
Emily, their grandchildren Rages, Winter, Har-
ley, and Easton, and the rest of Bob’s family 
and friends. Although he may no longer be 
with us, he will continue to have a lasting im-
pact on the lives of his family and community.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 
OF MR. THOMAS H. RHODES 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of Mr. Thomas H. 
Rhodes as he celebrates his 100th birthday on 
June 18th. Throughout his life, Mr. Rhodes 
has 
demonstrated 
exemplary 
patriotism 
through his service in World War II, and long-
standing devotion to his family and commu-
nity. 
During World War II, Mr. Rhodes proudly 
served his country as a U.S. Marine and par-
ticipated in several major conflicts including 
the battles of Pearl Harbor, Midway, Peleliu, 
New Britain, and New Guinea. After the war, 
he returned to Central New York to continue 
his service at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, 
New York. Following completion of his military 
service, Mr. Rhodes was honorably dis-
charged as a Sergeant. Today, he remains an 
active member of the Marine Corps League, 
an organization that aims to serve commu-
nities nationwide, preserve the traditions of the 
U.S. Marine Corps, and strengthen bonds be-
tween former servicemembers and their fami-
lies. 
Outside of public service, Mr. Rhodes is 
known for his commitment to his family. He 
was devoted to his late wife, Bridget ‘‘Peggy’’ 
Rhodes, and remains a dedicated father to 
their four children, and proud grandfather to 
12 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren. 
Active in his community, Mr. Rhodes regularly 
appears in Fayetteville and Manlius parades 
and is a life-long member of the Catholic 
Church and the Knights of Columbus. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in recognizing Mr. Thomas 
H. Rhodes’s 100th birthday. Mr. Rhodes’s life 
has been one marked by admirable devotion 
to his family and country. I wish him health 
and happiness in the future. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE 
RESTAURANTS ACT OF 2020 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, there 
is perhaps nothing more central to commu-
nities large and small than their local res-
taurants. Restaurants play host to everything 
from first dates to marriage proposals and 
many of life’s important memories. The focal 
restaurant industry supports Top Chef Mas-
ters, first jobs, and parents working double- 
shifts to give their children a brighter future. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has put all of this in 
jeopardy. 
Since mid-March, the vast majority of inde-
pendent restaurants have closed their doors, 
laid off most of their employees, and are un-
sure what their business model will be after 
the pandemic. While independent restaurants 
employ more than 11 million people, the food 
supply chain touches every corner of the 
country and every congressional district. From 
farm workers and fishermen to truck drivers 
and distributors, the restaurant industry pro-
vides a $1 trillion annual boost to the United 
States; economy, to say nothing of supporting 
tens of millions of livelihoods. 
The restaurant industry has been uniquely 
devastated by the COVID–19 pandemic. This 
is particularly true of independent establish-
ments that account for more than three-quar-
ters of all restaurants and bars in the United 
States. The restaurant sector is the top con-
tributor to unemployment rolls across America. 
In April alone, 5.5 million restaurant workers 
lost their jobs, accounting for 27 percent of 
total job losses in the month. Some of these 
jobs are coming back but many will not return 
without assistance.The National Bureau of 
Economic Research predicts that only 15 per-
cent of restaurants will be able to stay open if 
the COVID–19 pandemic lasts six months. 
The RESTAURANTS Act would establish a 
$120 billion restaurant revitalization fund at the 
Department of Treasury. Funding would be 
available to food service or drinking establish-
ments that are not publicly traded or part of a 
chain with 20 or more locations doing busi-
ness under the same name. The grant values 
would cover the difference between revenues 
from 2019 and projected revenues through 
2020. The first 14 days of the grant’s avail-
ability is only available to restaurants with an-
nual revenues of $1.5 million or fewer, ensur-
ing 
that 
the 
smallest 
restaurants 
are 
prioritized. Additionally, the legislation includes 
administrative funding toward outreach and 
engagement to restaurants owned and oper-
ated by women, Veterans, and people of 
color. A study on this proposal found that the 
fund would generate at least $183 billion in 
primary benefits and $65 billion in secondary 
benefits—more than double the amount of the 
fund. 
In the past three months, Congress has 
demonstrated the political will to pass more 
than $3 trillion of relief to most sectors of the 
economy—the House of Representatives just 
passed an additional $3 trillion of relief. There 
were broad-based programs and there was 
targeted relief for specific industries. Yet res-
taurants have not been a recipient of any tar-
geted relief. We can’t afford not to act. Millions 
of livelihoods, hundreds of thousands of busi-
nesses, and the fabric of our communities is 
at stake.

Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Steve DeBaker and Trout 
Springs Winery for their work in creating the 
Wisconsin Ledge American Viticultural Area 
(AVA) in Northeast Wisconsin. 
Steve DeBaker opened Trout Springs Win-
ery in 2005, establishing it as Brown County’s 
first winery. Trout Springs Winery is Wiscon-
sin’s only licensed fish hatchery, plant nursery, 
and winery all under one roof. After 9 suc-
cessful years in the wine industry, Trout 
Springs Winery was honored by the Wisconsin 
Grape Growers Association as their Winery of 
the Year in 2014. 
An AVA is a special region designated as 
having certain geographic and climatic fea-
tures required for growing wine grapes, and 
the designation is often included on wine la-
bels. Soon after opening Trout Springs Win-
ery, Steve decided to establish the Wisconsin 
Ledge as an AVA. After 4,000 hours of dedi-
cated research, numerous submissions to the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 
and some assistance from the Niagara Es-
carpment Resource Network with the GIS 
mapping process, Steve and Trout Springs 
achieved their goal of establishing the Wis-
consin Ledge as an AVA. 
The Wisconsin Ledge AVA sits on the Niag-
ara Escarpment, a land feature in Wisconsin 
that stretches for more than 650 miles, cre-
ated millions of years ago. It touches 11 dif-
ferent counties in Northeast Wisconsin and 
contains soil and a climate ideal for growing 
grapes. With 22 bonded wineries within its 
scope and 3,800 square miles of land, the 
Wisconsin Ledge has become the 12th largest 
AVA in the world. It has grown into a tourist 
destination for visitors from around the world, 
leading to an annual agritourism increase of 
nearly two million tourists and over $50 million 
in revenue. Steve’s commitment and work to 
developing the Wisconsin Ledge as an AVA 
has legitimized the Northeast Wisconsin as a 
grape growing region. 
Madam Speaker, I am privileged to honor 
Steve DeBaker and Trout Springs Winery as 
the birthplace of the Wisconsin Ledge Amer-
ican Viticultural Area. His dedication and posi-
tive contributions to the Wisconsin agricultural 
industry make Northeast Wisconsin proud.

rising in cities across our country and around 
the world to say enough is enough. People 
from all walks of life are coming together to 
call for real change to address the inequities 
and failures of our systems, to shine a light on 
persistent and systemic racism, and to de-
mand justice for the senseless deaths of Afri-
can American men and women like George 
Floyd, Breanna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. 
Moments like these in history force us to 
confront the sobering truths of who and where 
we are as a nation. Many will have their eyes 
opened to realities and perspectives they did 
not see before, thus beginning or furthering 
their journeys to unlearn deeply engrained be-
liefs and better understand how racism con-
tinues to shape our daily lives. Others still will 
feel emboldened to turn their knowledge and 
empathy into action for the first time. 
And then there are those leaders who have 
been in this fight for much longer. I rise today 
to honor as Iowan of the Week one such lead-
er who has been on the front lines not only of 
recent peaceful protests, but also of the day- 
to-day work of lifting up a community from 
within: Kameron Middlebrooks. 
Kam’s history of activism and accomplish-
ments belie his relative youth. Now in his early 
thirties, he’s already spent half his life advo-
cating for Des Moines’ black community. If you 
mention Kam’s name to someone in central 
Iowa, it’s likely they’ve already heard of him. 
That could be because they went to school to-
gether at Roosevelt High, read about him as 
one of the Des Moines Register’s 15 People 
to Watch in 2019, heard about the work he’s 
done on the Des Moines Human and Civil 
Rights Commission, or for a host of other rea-
sons. As busy as life in Congress keeps me, 
I wonder how Kameron fits everything into his 
day. 
Kam currently serves as President of the 
Des Moines Branch of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People 
(NAACP), an organization he joined in high 
school before becoming its youngest-ever Mid-
western Regional Field Director and success-
fully leading a campaign to register more than 
15,000 people of color to vote across the Mid-
west. He’s owned his own small business, and 
now coaches African Americans interested in 
becoming small business owners through that 
process as minority business coordinator for 
Iowa State University Extension and Outreach. 
He hosts annual trainings at Des Moines’ Eve-
lyn K. Davis Center for Working Families to 
equip participants with essential skills to suc-
cessfully run their own shops. He coordinates 
multiple work groups to address disparities 
among black and white residents of Polk 
County in critical areas like employment, edu-
cation, and housing. And his efforts to create 
a more equitable society without racial dis-
crimination don’t stop there. 
Kam and I spoke on the phone last Monday. 
He’d spent each of the several nights prior at 
peaceful protests until the early hours of the 
morning to make sure the younger generation 
got home safely. When thanked for his work, 
he praised others. When asked what comes 
next, he already had plans for how we can 
empower youth voices and create a stronger 
community. His passion, selflessness, and 
drive were infectious. It’s no surprise he’s 
emerged as someone Iowans are eager to fol-
low. 
Across my state and the country, thousands 
continue to gather day after day to stand to-
gether against injustice. Young leaders like 
Kameron are among them. While it is impera-
tive current elected officials heed their calls for 
action, it is also my hope that the young 
voices powering this movement are inspired to 
stay involved and ultimately become the of-
ficeholders called upon to enact more just and 
equitable policies. 
For many reasons, the people of Iowa are 
fortunate to call Kameron Middlebrooks one of 
our own. I ask today that the House of Rep-
resentatives join me in honoring his continued 
service and leadership by naming him our 
Iowan of the Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. SCOTT 
MENZEL FOR A DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER WITH THE WASHTENAW 
INTERMEDIATE 
SCHOOL 
DIS-
TRICT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Scott Menzel for his 
years of distinguished service to students in 
Michigan and offer my heartfelt congratula-
tions as he begins a new chapter as super-
intendent for the Scottsdale Unified School 
District in Arizona. Although we are all sad to 
see him go, we are proud to celebrate his out-
standing contributions to the Washtenaw Inter-
mediate School District. 
In 2011, Dr. Scott Menzel became the su-
perintendent of the Washtenaw Intermediate 
School District (WISD) and started his tenure 
at a pivotal moment in the community’s his-
tory. In 2012, Willow Run and Ypsilanti 
schools began the consolidation process to 
form a new district. The consolidation, which 
many thought to be impossible, came to fru-
ition thanks to the support of the WISD and 
Menzel’s tenacity, hard work, and commitment 
to education. Prior to his work in the WISD, 
Menzel served as superintendent for Whitmer 
Lake Public Schools from 2002 to 2007. Later, 
Menzel led similar operations at the Livingston 
Educational Service Agency from 2007 to 
2011. 
Throughout all capacities, Menzel has been 
recognized as a humble leader who strives to 
make a lasting and meaningful difference in 
students’ lives. He dedicates himself to causes 
he believes in, and encourages others to dem-
onstrate compassion, service, and excellence. 
Undoubtably, Menzel’s passion for education 
and academic opportunity have left a profound 
impact on the school district, evident in the re-
cent passing of a bond proposal that will help 
construct a new $53.2 million school for spe-
cial-needs students outside of Ann Arbor. 
Moreover, Menzel’s focus on addressing racial 
disparities 
and 
promoting 
racial 
equity 
throughout the district has set a clear example 
for other districts to emulate. He has been an 
avid proponent of My Brother’s Keeper, an ini-
tiative created under the Obama Administra-
tion to address persistent opportunity gaps 
facing young boys and young men of color, 
and his involvement has helped the program 
flourish and grow throughout Michigan. He has 
received numerous honors and accolades for 
his work including the National African Amer-
ican Parent Involvement Day Spirit Award, the 
MASA Regional Superintendent of the Year 
Award, and the White House YMCA Cham-
pion for Change Award, among a host of oth-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Scott Menzel. Menzel has 
helped students develop skills and gain con-
fidence not only needed to succeed academi-
cally, but in life beyond the classroom. He has 
impacted their futures in profound ways, and 
we are all grateful for his commitment to his 
students, his district, and his community. We 
thank him for his service to students in Michi-
gan and wish him the best of luck in Arizona.

GREGORY THOMPSON 
CONDOLENCES 
HON. DAN CRENSHAW 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with deep sadness to mourn the loss of Greg-
ory Thompson, who passed away on Tuesday, 
May 19, 2020 in Woodbridge, Virginia. 
Gregory sadly joins countless Americans 
who fell victim to the COVID–19 pandemic. At 
just 56 years old, his full life was cut far too 
short. 
Gregory served our country in the United 
States Air Force and was a Security Officer at 
the U.S. State Department in Washington, 
D.C. for more than 15 years. 
A self-made man, Gregory was the owner of 
Made to Measure, a custom tailor clothing 
business that he owned with his partner How-
ard Wallace. That’s how I knew Gregory. 
Gregory was kind, warm, and I always en-
joyed our time together. Gregory always took 
on the difficult task of making me look my best 
with a smile, and I am grateful that I had such 
a talented craftsman to take care of me during 
my first year in Washington. 
But much more than a tailor, Gregory was 
a father to Giovanni and a brother to Eliza-
beth, Veneda, Michael, and Walter. He was a 
cherished friend and beloved family member 
to many, all of whom are grieving this pro-
found loss. 
I ask the whole House to join me as we 
mourn the loss of Gregory Thompson and 
offer our sincere condolences to his family, 
friends, and loved ones during this difficult 
time. 
Never Forget.

RECOGNIZING ALEXIS AYANO 
TERAI 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my great appreciation for 
Alexis Ayano Terai, who over the past five 
years has served as Manager of the Congres-
sional Study Group on Japan. 
Through her hard work and dedication, 
Alexis has enriched our nation’s relationship 
with this most critical and important ally. 
The Congressional Study Groups are the 
premier international projects administered by 
the U.S. Association of Former Members of 
Congress. 
They are also one of the most active and 
substantive bipartisan exchanges involving the 
U.S. Congress and the legislative branches of 
allied countries. 
Alexis has been an integral part of the 
Study Group’s outstanding success and her 
kindness to others and commitment to her job 
have been exemplary. 
She has worked tirelessly to help build and 
foster the Congressional Study Group on 
Japan and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance 
and partnership by creating opportunities for 
Members and Congressional staff to exchange 
views with their Japanese counterparts both in 
the U.S. and Japan. 
Among her many accomplishments, Alexis 
helped to develop a myriad of programs fo-
cused on the bilateral relationship with Japan 
and the broader Asia region. 
As Co-chair of the Congressional Study 
Group on Japan, I’ve had the pleasure of 
working with Alexis over the last five years. 
And I know I speak for all of my colleagues in 
the group when I say that Alexis will be 
missed. 
As Alexis pursues her Master’s Degree in 
Asian Studies at Georgetown University, we 
wish her much success and happiness on this 
new path.

HONORING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
UNITED STATES PROBATION OF-
FICER BEN BERRY 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Officer Ben Berry, who re-
tired in April after more than 20 years with the 
U.S. Probation Office. Throughout his career, 
Officer Berry demonstrated a profound com-
mitment to public safety and the improvement 
of the U.S. Probation Office. 
At the beginning of his career in law en-
forcement, Officer Berry served as a United 
States Army Officer, Probation Officer for the 
State of Florida, and a Federal Probation Offi-
cer for the Northern District of Florida. In 
1999, Officer Berry moved to Central New 
York where he took a job working as a U.S. 
Probation Officer in Northern District of New 
York, Syracuse office. Working his way up the 
ranks, he held the position of Senior U.S. Pro-
bation Officer Sentencing Guidelines Specialist 
and was later promoted to Supervising U.S. 
Probation Officer, where he oversaw the In-
vestigations Unit. A proficient marksman, he 
also served as the Lead Firearms Instructor. 
In this role, he trained and certified officers in 
the use of firearms, and helped develop and 
improve the firearms training program. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the career 
of Officer Ben Berry. As a dedicated public 
servant and a leader in the U.S. Probation Of-
fice, I wish Officer Berry the best in his retire-
ment.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR TIM-

HANNA’S 
24 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Timothy Hanna and his 24 
years of service as the Mayor of Appleton, 
Wisconsin. After being elected mayor of his 
hometown in 1996, Mr. Hanna retired this year 
as the longest-serving mayor in the city’s his-
tory, leaving behind a legacy that makes Ap-
pleton the beautiful city it is today. 
During his time as mayor, Mr. Hanna spear-
headed projects like the construction of the 
Fox Cities Performing Arts Center and the Fox 
Cities Exhibition Center, redeveloping Apple-
ton’s downtown area. While these projects in-
vigorated the local economy, Mr. Hanna cites 
establishing programs of diversity and inclu-
sion as his greatest accomplishment in office. 
In one of his first initiatives as mayor, Mr. 
Hanna pursued intercultural relations reform in 
Appleton. In October 1997, Mayor Hanna cre-
ated Appleton’s Diversity and Intercultural 
Center, hiring the first-ever Intercultural Rela-
tions Coordinator. Since then, the Intercultural 
Relations Coordinator has bridged the racial 
and social divides between the various com-
munities within Appleton to create a stronger, 
unified city. 
Mr. Hanna led Appleton through the tragic 
September 11th terrorist attacks, the city’s re-
covery from the Great Recession, and the ini-
tial response to the coronavirus pandemic. His 
strong leadership and commitment to the peo-
ple of Appleton helped them persevere 
through these crises. Mr. Hanna instilled con-
fidence, provided guidance, and inspired his 
citizens to thrive both in times of hardship and 
prosperity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in recognizing Timothy Hanna 
for his service as mayor. His selfless leader-
ship and commitment to the development of 
Appleton serves as an example for every pub-
lic servant. 
HONORING SPEAKER MIKE TURZAI 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Speaker of the Penn-
sylvania 
House 
of 
Representatives 
Mike 
Turzai, who has devoted decades of service to 
our Commonwealth and our Nation. Since tak-
ing office in 2001, Speaker Turzai has cham-
pioned our American values and defended our 
Constitutional rights. 
During Speaker Turzai’s tenure in the Penn-
sylvania House of Representatives, he has 
worked hard to achieve important policy 
wins—such as creating jobs, supporting our 
small businesses, improving workforce devel-
opment, expanding choice in education, re-
forming the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board 
system, and reducing burdensome regulations. 
Speaker Turzai was a consistent champion of 
fiscal conservatism; he opposed tax increases 
and the midnight pay increase. Additionally, he 
has led the Chamber’s pro-life agenda to de-
fend the dignity of life. Before becoming the 
Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Rep-
resentatives, he served in a number of leader-
ship roles in the chamber and propelled com-
monsense, conservative policy forward. 
A lifelong Pennsylvanian, Speaker Turzai 
was raised in Moon Township and graduated 
from Our Lady of Sacred Heart High School. 
He received his bachelor’s degree from the 
University of Notre Dame before earning his 
Juris Doctor from Duke University. In addition 
to his official work, Speaker Turzai has a long 
record of leadership in his community. He and 
his wife Lidia live in the North Hills of Pitts-
burgh with their three sons, Andrew, Stephen, 
and Matthew. 
Upon Speaker Turzai’s retirement from the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives, I 
thank him for his commitment and service to 
our Commonwealth. He represented the val-
ues of his constituents well. As the Turzai 
family begins a new chapter, I wish them 
every continued success.

impactful assignments was as Deputy Director 
for the National Weather Service (NWS) at the 
Remote Sensing Center in Chanhassen, Min-
nesota in 1999. 
When retiring from the NOAA Corps in 
2005, Bill and his wife Kellie thought of no bet-
ter place to raise their daughters and headed

the

caster at the North Central Forecast Center

enjoy retirement with his wife Kellie. 
I thank Bill for 37 years of service to the Na-

in the 17th Annual Capitol Hill Challenge. I 
congratulate Nelson Alvarez and his teacher, 
Donald Wharton Jr., on their passionate com-

vest a hypothetical $100,000 portfolio of

math literacy for public school students in 
every US Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize

HONORING DAMON GUTZWILLER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Sergeant Damon 
Gutzwiller, a Sergeant with the Santa Cruz 
County Sheriff’s Office. Damon will be remem-
bered as a dedicated police officer with a pas-
sion for serving his community, kind friend, 
and devoted husband and father. 
Damon Gutzwiller was raised in Santa Cruz 
County on the central coast of California and 
graduated from Aptos High School. Shortly 
after his graduation, he began volunteering 
with the Santa Cruz Sheriffs Office and was 
hired as a full-time Deputy Sheriff in 2006. 
Sergeant Gutzwiller held many roles during 
his 14–year career at the Santa Cruz County 
Sheriffs Office and was promoted to Sergeant 
last year. Damon distinguished himself to his 
colleagues and those he served across the 
Central Coast for his aptitude at resolving 
tense situations with his calm demeanor, in-
fectious smile, and sense of humor. Above all 
else in his role, Damon’s first priority was to 
selflessly serve the community he called 
home. 
Damon was especially proud of the life he 
shared with his loving partner, Favi, and their 
two-year-old son. Damon was eager to wel-
come another baby to their family later this 
month and looked forward to growing the fam-
ily that he loved and had completely com-
mitted himself to. 
Damon will be remembered as a beloved 
community member, partner, and father. We 
celebrate his service to the Central Coast and 
his life well-lived. Madam Speaker, I ask that 
my colleagues join me in honoring the life of 
Sergeant Damon Gutzwiller.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
OFFICER JOHN M. PRASKEY 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 15, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Officer John M. Praskey, 
who will celebrate 50 years of service in law 
enforcement on June 29, 2020. Throughout 
his career, Officer Praskey has demonstrated 
profound courage and a strong commitment to 
public safety. 
Officer Praskey began his career in law en-
forcement when he graduated from the New 
York State Police Academy on October 30, 
1970. Ascending the ranks in the New York 
State Police, he was promoted to Sergeant in 
September 1978 and again in October 1984 to 
Station Commander. As a State Trooper, he 
has served a leading role in several homicide, 
armed robbery, and attempted murder cases. 
Notably, during the tragic events of September 
11th, 2001, Officer Praskey directed and co-
ordinated New York State Police response ef-
forts in New York City. 
Following his retirement from the New York 
State Police after 34 years, Officer Praskey 
joined the Liverpool Police Department as a 
part-time police officer. With the Liverpool Po-
lice, he has received numerous awards and 
has taken many actions that have garnered 
him the respect of his colleagues and the 
community. In 2006, Officer Praskey was dis-
patched to a house fire on Wyker Circle where 
a man was trapped inside. Arriving ahead of 
the Fire Department, without hesitation, Officer 
Praskey entered the burning house and res-
cued the resident. More recently, in 2018, 
while handling an investigation into a stolen bi-
cycle, he arranged for a bicycle to be donated 
to the victim after learning he depended on it 
for transportation. Similarly, when Officer 
Praskey came across a stranded motorist that 
had run out of fuel, he gave the individual $10 
of his own money for gas. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the career 
of Officer John M. Praskey. As a dedicated 
public servant, I wish Officer Praskey the best 
in his continued service.

mote tourism, provide member services to the 
people of Waconia and stay active in every 
level of politics. 
Kellie has organized and run some of 
Waconia’s most loved events, including Nickle 
Dickle Days, Fourth of July Fireworks and the 
Governor’s fishing opener on Lake Waconia. 
Waconia’s close-knit community would be in-
complete without the multitude of phenomenal 
events that are made possible by Kellie and 
the Waconia Chamber of Commerce. 
I congratulate Kellie and her husband, Bill, 
on her retirement. Although I am saddened by 
her departure from Waconia, I wish her the 
best of luck with her move to Washington 
state.
