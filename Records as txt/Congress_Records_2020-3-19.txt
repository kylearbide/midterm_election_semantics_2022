S1817 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 2020 
No. 53 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father, we place our hope in 
You. May our lawmakers find wisdom 
in Your trustworthy precepts. Guide 
our Senators to live so honorably that 
they will bring glory to Your Name. 
Lord, inspire them to yield their alle-
giance to You, striving always to re-
ceive Your approval. Thank You for 
hearing and answering their prayers, as 
they fervently seek Your wisdom. 
Guide them through the challenges of 
these times. 
Lord, remind us all that we are mere 
sojourners in time, heading for the bet-
ter land of eternity. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
much has been said on the Senate floor 
these past few days regarding our Na-
tion’s response to the coronavirus. But 
this morning, after our prayer to the 
Lord and after the pledge to our Na-
tion’s flag, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to send Iowans’ and our Nation’s 
parents 
my 
commendation 
because 
schools are closing, and as these 
schools close, the work of a parent or 
grandparent is more important than 
ever. I know many children are scared 
or don’t understand why they can’t 
play with their friends, and this puts 
an extra burden on their parents on top 
of all of the other challenges that these 
families have. 
Those of you who are parents are 
raising America’s future, and I want to 
recognize the importance of what you 
do every day. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, President Trump and his 
team announced several new actions to 
help 
contain 
and 
combat 
the 
coronavirus. The President invoked the 
Defense Production Act, laying ground-
work to manufacture more medical 
equipment. The Department of Health 
and Human Services will let medical 
professionals 
practice 
across 
State 
lines. The Department of Defense will 
deploy hospital ships and transfer mil-
lions of respirator masks and thou-
sands of ventilators to HHS. The FDA 
will deepen partnerships with commer-
cial laboratories to expand testing. The 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment will suspend foreclosures 
and evictions on FHA-insured mort-
gages. And the Department of Home-
land Security reached a mutual agree-
ment with Canada to close our north-
ern 
border 
to 
nonessential 
travel. 
These are major steps as we confront a 
major crisis. 
Here in the Senate we are preparing 
to take further bold steps of our own. 
Yesterday, we passed legislation from 
the House that will provide some 
American workers with additional ben-
efits during this emergency. As I ex-
plained yesterday, that legislation was 
hardly perfect. It imposes new costs 
and uncertainty on small businesses at 
precisely the most challenging moment 
for small businesses in living memory. 
So the Senate is even more determined 
that our legislation cannot leave small 
businesses behind. 
Support for small business is one of 
the four key components of the much 
bolder 
proposal 
we 
are 
finalizing. 
Chairman RUBIO and Chairman COLLINS 
have been crafting a major plan to help 
small businesses survive this crisis and 
help workers continue to get paid. 
We are talking about new federally 
guaranteed loans on the order of hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to address 
immediate cashflow problems. This is 
no massive new bureaucracy. We want 
to let qualified small businesses get li-
quidity through familiar institutions— 
their own community banks, credit 
unions, or nationwide lenders. 
As Chairman COLLINS explained yes-
terday, owners will not be able to use 
the funds to give themselves raises or 
increase their own profits. The point is 
to help small business endure, help 
workers keep their jobs, and help both 
businesses and workers emerge from 
this ready to thrive. 
As Chairman RUBIO
explained, the 
portions of these funds that small busi-
nesses use on core expenses, such as 
paying workers and paying their rent 
or mortgage, will convert into grants 
they will not need to pay back. This 
will make sure that even lower profit 
margin Main Street businesses get a 
fighting chance to stay open and con-
tinue paying workers. 
This is straightforward: a rapid injec-
tion of cash to help small businesses

S1818 
March 19, 2020 
through 
this 
turmoil—not 
some 
brandnew program with a long lead 
time but an existing program that has 
been tested. 
The second major pillar of our legis-
lation will be even more straight-
forward: direct financial help for Amer-
icans. Senate Republicans want to put 
cash in the hands of the American peo-
ple. Chairman GRASSLEY and a number 
of our colleagues are finalizing a struc-
ture that will get assistance to individ-
uals and families as rapidly as possible. 
This is no Washington process with a 
thousand cooks in the kitchen, no piles 
of forms for laid-off workers or busy 
families to fill out—money for people 
from the middle class on down, period. 
For laid-off Americans, this infusion 
would complement unemployment in-
surance and could be put toward imme-
diate needs during this crisis. For 
Americans who are still working, the 
money would provide extra certainty 
in this uniquely uncertain time and 
help remind everyone that temporary 
shutdowns at bars and restaurants do 
not mean all commerce has to halt. 
For retirees, the money would com-
plement Social Security and help sen-
iors navigate the unusual routines that 
have suddenly become necessary for 
their own safety. 
This is a form of additional tax relief 
that we want to push to taxpayers 
right away. It is not an ordinary pol-
icy, but this is no ordinary time. The 
American people need help, and they 
need it fast. This will deliver it. 
Now, we believe this rapid assistance 
is crucial, but, more broadly, we need 
to keep as many Americans as possible 
on the job and connected to their em-
ployers. The small business relief will 
help, and so will a number of additional 
tax relief measures, which will be de-
signed to help employers maintain 
cashflow and keep making payroll, pre-
serving employment and protecting 
economic foundations. 
That is also why the third pillar of 
our proposal involves targeted lending 
to industries of national importance. 
Chairman SHELBY, Chairman WICKER, 
and Senator THUNE are leading this 
component. 
Just like small businesses, entire sec-
tors are being crushed—crushed—by 
public health guidance, which is obvi-
ously through no fault of their own. 
For example, our Nation needs airlines. 
Yet they have ongoing maintenance 
costs that do not disappear just be-
cause the government has chased away 
all the customers. We cannot expect 
this key industry to mothball itself 
overnight, then dust off in weeks and 
months and pop right back online as 
the Nation will need and expect. 
So let’s be clear about something. 
From small businesses to key sectors, 
we are not talking about so-called bail-
outs for firms that made reckless deci-
sions. Nobody is alleging a moral haz-
ard here. None of these firms—not cor-
ner stores, not pizza parlors, not air-
lines—brought this on themselves. We 
are not talking about a taxpayer-fund-
ed cushion to companies that made 
mistakes. We are talking about loans, 
which must be repaid, for American 
employers 
whom 
the 
government 
itself—the government itself—is tem-
porarily crushing for the sake of public 
health. 
The fourth piece of our proposal goes 
to the heart of this crisis: the health of 
the American people. Chairmen ALEX-
ANDER and GRASSLEY will be rolling out 
proposals to get resources on the 
frontlines of our fight against the virus 
itself because, to be clear, nothing I 
have laid out so far will represent a 
typical economic stimulus in the way 
that we think of that term. 
Nobody—nobody—expects that em-
ployment figures or the stock market 
or GDP growth will bounce right back 
to where they were a few weeks ago. No 
policy and no amount of money could 
return things to normal overnight. 
There is an underlying medical re-
ality that is driving this disruption. In 
the words of one journalist, this is pri-
marily ‘‘a health crisis—with an eco-
nomic crisis strapped to its back.’’ 
So, yes, our proposal will imme-
diately help American workers, fami-
lies, and businesses. Yes, it will help 
position our economy to thrive once 
again after this public health menace 
is behind us. 
This may not be the last economic 
legislation we pursue, but, fundamen-
tally, we have to beat back this virus. 
We have to beat back this virus. That 
is why our proposal will go even fur-
ther to remove barriers to care, speed 
innovation, fund the hospitals and 
health centers that will treat patients, 
and expand healthcare workers’ access 
to the tools they need, including res-
pirator masks. 
Immediately after we pass this legis-
lation, Congress must begin a bipar-
tisan, bicameral appropriations process 
to address the administration’s new 
supplemental funding request, so we 
can keep funding healthcare and other 
priorities. 
I think every American shares the 
sense that the last several days have 
felt more like several months. Just last 
Saturday, our Nation had fewer than 
3,000 confirmed cases, and 58 Americans 
had lost their lives. Already, the num-
ber of cases has nearly tripled. Trag-
ically, so has the number of deaths. 
The crisis is moving fast; our health 
system is under strain; and our econ-
omy is hurting. 
The legislation I have just laid out 
will not be the last word. As I said, we 
will need to turn right away to a bipar-
tisan appropriations process. This is 
not Congress’s last chance to legislate, 
but it is critical that we move swiftly 
and boldly to begin to stabilize our 
economy, preserve Americans’ jobs, get 
money to workers and families, and 
keep up our fight on the health front. 
That is exactly—exactly—what our 
proposal will do. These are not ordi-
nary policies. This is no ordinary time. 
The American people are strong. They 
are brave. There is no doubt the Amer-
ican people will come through this bat-
tle and then soar to new heights on the 
other side. 
The American people will win this 
fight against this virus. The Senate’s 
job is to give them the tools they need, 
and we are not leaving until we do our 
job. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
the space of less than 24 hours, yester-
day, the number of coronavirus cases 
in my dear home State of New York 
has more than doubled. The spread of 
the virus has been rapid and the con-
sequences severe. The coronavirus is 
slowing our economy to a near stand-
still, promoting widespread layoffs and 
the likelihood of a deep recession that 
will be painfully felt in households 
from coast to coast, from New York to 
California and every other State. 
We are living in a time of public 
emergency—in our healthcare system, 
in our economy, and, indeed, in our so-
ciety itself. Separated from one an-
other, we are going to have to pull to-
gether in spirit. The American people 
have to sacrifice their routines. They 
don’t want to, but we have no choice if 
we want to stay healthy and arrest the 
spread of the disease. 
Our healthcare workers and our first 
responders every day are being asked 
to perform daunting and heroic tasks 
for which we all are already in their 
debt. 
The anxiety, the fear, and the confu-
sion that New Yorkers and Americans 
feel today is palpable, but I would re-
mind them that there has never been a 
challenge too great for our country to 
overcome. I remember the dark days 
after 9/11. So many were prepared to 
write New York City off the map. They 
said no one would live or do business in 
the southern part of Manhattan. They 
said the whole city and its suburbs 
would never come back. 
But we did come back, strongly, 
more resilient than we ever were be-
fore. We can and will do it again—in 
New York and throughout the Nation. 
But we must act urgently and boldly 
now, during what may still be the early 
days of this crisis. 
Regarding the business before the 
Senate right now, yesterday we passed 
the second phase of legislation to re-
spond to the coronavirus, which in-
cluded important provisions to extend

S1819 
March 19, 2020 
paid sick leave, unemployment insur-
ance, and provide free—free, no copays, 
no deductibles—coronavirus testing for 
all Americans. That bill was a first 
step. I am glad it is now done. I am 
glad it got support from both sides of 
the aisle—I believe 90 votes on pas-
sage—and the aid will begin to flow. 
Now, Leader MCCONNELL
has just 
outlined and will soon announce plans 
of what the Senate Republicans believe 
should be included in the third phase of 
legislation to confront the coronavirus. 
We are ready and eager to look at what 
Republicans put together and to work 
with them, but we believe that, what-
ever proposal emerges—and it will be 
bipartisan—it must be a workers-first 
proposal. 
Workers first—that is our motto in 
what we are proposing. That means 
help for all workers: service workers, 
industry workers, factory workers, of-
fice tower workers, small business 
workers, gig workers, freelancers, bar-
tenders, retail workers, airline attend-
ants, and so many more. 
We owe a great deal of gratitude to 
the working people of America, wheth-
er they be blue collar or white collar; 
whether they work in high office tow-
ers, on the farms, or in a local drug 
store; those who clean our buildings 
and streets; those who are still work-
ing to collect the garbage and keep the 
power 
on; 
and, 
of 
course, 
our 
healthcare workers, who are risking 
everything to keep the rest of us safe. 
Workers first—that is the motto that 
I have and I believe Speaker PELOSI 
has, as well, as we Democrats seek 
input into the joint, bipartisan pack-
age that will be put together. Our goal 
is to make sure that no one—no work-
er, no family, no one—loses a paycheck 
or goes into financial ruin as a result 
of the coronavirus. That will take 
strong, bold, immediate action. 
That is why we must work so quickly 
but carefully, as well, to put together a 
bipartisan package. I spoke with Sec-
retary Mnuchin several times. I think 
he is of that view. I have heard that 
Leader MCCONNELL has said he will sit 
down with our Democratic Senators to 
come up with a bipartisan package. 
That is what we must do. 
So let me outline a few of our prior-
ities. First, if there is going to be a 
bailout of any sort of industry, worker 
priorities and worker protections must 
be included. Corporations should not 
get a bailout and then be allowed to 
fire employees or cut their salaries, cut 
their benefits. 
The airline industry just spent bil-
lions and billions in stock buybacks in 
the last 2 years, liquidity that would 
come in handy at a time like this. If 
there is a bailout, there need to be con-
ditions to make sure the interests of 
labor are given priority and that cor-
porations can’t buy back stock, reward 
executives, or lay off workers. 
We cannot repeat the mistake that 
was made in 2008 when the big boys and 
the big girls benefited, and no one else 
did—workers first. 
Second, phase 3 must include a mas-
sive infusion of resources for our 
healthcare system, for hospitals and 
medical supplies. America needs a Mar-
shall Plan for public health and public 
health infrastructure. In the wake of 
World War II, America helped rebuild a 
continent. Right now, we need to re-
build our health infrastructure on a 
continental scale. We need a Marshall 
Plan for our healthcare system. 
Without a massive commitment from 
this Congress, our healthcare system 
will not be able to handle this crisis. 
There are not enough workers, not 
enough supplies, not enough beds, not 
enough State and local funding. There 
is a major concern that, as this virus 
spreads, countless Americans will not 
be able to access or afford treatment if 
they get the coronavirus. 
It goes from the very big—we need 
lots of ventilators—to the smaller. A 
hospital in New York told us that they 
didn’t have enough nasal swabs to con-
duct the coronavirus test. Healthcare 
workers in Washington State are fash-
ioning homemade masks out of vinyl, 
elastic, and double-sided tape. The 
need for ventilators, which will save 
the lives of those who are afflicted by 
the disease in a severe way, is des-
perate. 
Yesterday, President Trump finally 
took our suggestion and invoked the 
Defense Production Act, but what is 
happening now? We don’t know. Who is 
in charge? Which factories are being 
asked to make the ventilators, and 
which factories are being asked to do 
other things as well? We need that kind 
of information, but just as important 
as the information is the urgency of 
getting these things done. 
Machines like ventilators can be the 
difference between life and death. Ac-
cording to one projection, it is possible 
that up to 960,000 Americans will need 
a ventilator during the coronavirus 
pandemic. Right now, only 160,000 are 
available, and only 12,700 are in stock-
piles. 
The President must direct a massive 
mobilization to ramp up ventilator pro-
duction. He also must do so to acquire 
new hospital space. We will be short of 
beds, particularly ICU beds. The Army 
Corps must be involved in helping to 
build temporary hospitals that can 
take on the new burden. We are on the 
verge, unfortunately, if we don’t act 
quickly, 
of 
repeating 
the 
heart-
breaking collapse of the hospital ca-
pacity experienced in Italy. That must 
not be allowed to happen. 
I was glad yesterday that President 
Trump heeded the call by Democrats 
on the Defense Production Act, but we 
need to go further. The President must 
make this an urgent responsibility. 
We need a Marshall Plan for our 
healthcare 
system, 
and 
that 
also 
means getting new workers involved. 
We are going to be short doctors and 
nurses. We have to make sure those in 
the healthcare system can get to work. 
The New York subway system is still 
needed to carry them there, and in 
many other cities they depend on one 
form of mass transit or another. 
The next legislation that we are put-
ting together must include a historic 
commitment 
to 
supporting 
our 
healthcare 
system 
and 
our 
fellow 
Americans who get sick. We cannot get 
this wrong. The stakes are too high. 
And third, phase 3 legislation must 
address the plight of workers and fami-
lies 
struggling 
with 
the 
economic 
ramifications of the virus. Millions and 
millions of American workers have 
been laid off. They didn’t do anything 
wrong—neither did the owner of their 
business—but there are no people com-
ing into the restaurants and the stores 
and the shops. There may be no cus-
tomers for businesses that provide 
services 
or 
goods. 
Storefronts 
are 
closed. The service industry is shedding 
jobs. Small businesses, small busi-
nesses owners who have devoted their 
lifetime to building their businesses 
are on the brink of collapse. The gears 
of American manufacturing are grind-
ing to a halt. There are millions of 
American workers home at night, 
home during the day. They are doing 
the right thing, but now they have no 
income, no idea where the next pay-
check will arrive or when they can re-
turn to work. We must step up to the 
plate immediately and help these suf-
fering workers who don’t have a pay-
check and are worried about how they 
are going to pay the rent, the mort-
gage, buy the food, the necessities, the 
medicines they and their families need. 
Congress must help them. 
We should enact a new form of unem-
ployment insurance. We call it ‘‘em-
ployment insurance.’’ It is really un-
employment insurance on steroids—as-
sistance until these already employed 
Americans can get back to work. Exist-
ing unemployment insurance has a lot 
of failings. It doesn’t cover enough peo-
ple to meet this crisis. So many who 
work part time, who are gig workers, 
and for many other reasons are not 
covered by unemployment insurance— 
our new employment insurance must 
cover them all. 
Second, the payments must be full. 
The payment should be equal or come 
as close to equaling as possible the sal-
aries they got. Most people who get un-
employment insurance don’t get close 
to the percentage they need to live on. 
And third, it must be quick and easy. 
In many States—some by design—it is 
very hard to get employment insur-
ance. You have to go through the 
whole rigmarole. That must end. 
Our new employment insurance—an 
unemployment insurance on steroids— 
must have full payment so lost salaries 
are totally made up for, it must be 
quick and easy to access, and it must 
be broad-based. Democrats will ask for 
that as one of our most important asks 
because that goes to the people who 
need help; that goes to the people who 
are not getting their salaries because 
they have been laid off or furloughed. 
That is the most immediate and quick 
thing to deal with the problem right at 
the level where it exists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1820 
March 19, 2020 
Another must for us is paid sick 
leave. Senators MURRAY
and GILLI-
BRAND have important legislation on 
this issue and want to get this done. 
And for small businesses, there must 
be liquidity. Many of these businesses 
are great businesses. They were doing 
fine until 2, 3 weeks ago, but no cus-
tomers are coming in the door or call-
ing on the phone. In addition to paying 
their workers through our employment 
insurance, we must see that these busi-
nesses have liquidity to pay their in-
surance bills, to pay their mortgages, 
to pay their problems, and deal with 
that so when, God willing—and I am 
confident it will happen—this crisis 
leaves us, they will be able to open 
their businesses stronger than ever be-
fore. 
There are many other things we want 
to get done. Today, Senator WARREN, 
Senator MURRAY, Senator BROWN, and I 
are announcing a bill to cancel—can-
cel—student loan payments during the 
duration of the coronavirus and to pro-
vide a minimum of a $10,000 payoff for 
all student loan borrowers. This is a 
problem that has been going on for too 
long. It is exacerbated by the crisis. We 
have to help the students and those 
with big loans on their backs. That leg-
islation—something like it—should be 
in phase 3 of legislation. 
There are many other things that 
must be done. As we Senate Democrats 
a couple of days ago announced a $750 
billion package—well, there are other 
things that are in there, and there may 
be other things that have to be added, 
but we have to look at this crisis in its 
totality and address it. 
Some have proposed—I have heard 
this coming out of the administration 
and from some of my colleagues—an al-
ternative to these policies: a one-time 
cash payment of $1,000. That might 
help families cover rent, groceries for a 
month, but then what? If we are going 
to do this kind of payment plan—first, 
it cannot be a substitute for the things 
I have mentioned. It must be in addi-
tion. I think there is a general, unani-
mous view on our side that should be 
the case. 
But second, if we are going to do it, 
it has to be bigger, more generous, and 
more frequent than some that I have 
heard proposed from the other side. We 
all know that workers and families 
need assistance, and they are going to 
get it. Democrats want to get that as-
sistance as quickly to the American 
people as possible, and I believe our Re-
publican colleagues do as well. But 
those who want to limit that assist-
ance to a one-time payment of around 
$1,000 given to everybody, for people 
who make $1 million and people who 
make $500 a week, that doesn’t make 
sense. 
The pandemic requires bold, struc-
tural changes to our society’s safety 
net to give people a lifeline for months, 
not just weeks. It requires the kinds of 
things I have mentioned. If we are 
going to go this route, it has to be big-
ger, more generous, more frequent. 
I have taken time to lay out these 
ideas on the floor because—thus far, at 
least—Senate Democrats have not been 
included in discussions with Senate Re-
publicans 
about 
phase 
3. 
Leader 
MCCONNELL is putting together his own 
plan. He is talking to his chairman and 
his Members, and then, he has said, he 
will present it to Senate Democrats or 
even House Democrats. 
As I have said before, if we want to 
get this done quickly, the best way to 
do it is to have a four-corners negotia-
tion: House and Senate, majority and 
minority. If we do it in each step, obvi-
ously—knowing how the Senate and 
the House work—it will take much 
longer. We have to move quickly. 
Make no mistake about it, our entire 
caucus wants to work in a bipartisan 
way to get this done quickly. What we 
are prescribing are some of the things 
we think would do the most good. 
In reference to that, we are living in 
a time of emergency. The typical legis-
lative process takes too long and will 
not work. I believe all parties should be 
in the room from the get-go so that 
any final product can pass as swiftly as 
possible. We are all interested in com-
ing together as quickly as we can. 
Time is of the essence. Let us come to-
gether, construct, and pass this bill as 
soon as we possibly can. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to thank 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader SCHUMER, and 
all of my colleagues who help support 
the Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act. That measure was signed 
yesterday by President Trump. As I un-
derstand 
from 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
work 
is 
underway 
on 
a 
third 
coronavirus package in the form of an 
economic stimulus to provide more 
support to families, businesses, and to 
the healthcare community, including 
our hospitals. 
This morning, I spoke to the Gov-
ernor of Illinois—we have been speak-
ing on almost a daily basis, sometimes 
almost several times a day—and asked 
him about the State of the situation in 
our home State of Illinois. Unfortu-
nately, we are still desperate for test-
ing kits. Illinois has about 5,000 more 
kits that were provided yesterday by a 
private company at the urging of our 
Governor, but we have never seen the 
number of test kits that we believe are 
necessary to measure the current state 
of this coronavirus in our home State 
of Illinois. The official count—and I 
might add that word ‘‘official’’—is that 
we have had 288 Illinoisans infected and 
1 fatality. I believe that the number of 
infections in the official report grossly 
understates the exposure in my home 
State of Illinois. Once more tests are 
administered and we receive the re-
sults, I am afraid we are going to see a 
dramatic increase in that number of re-
ported infections in the State. 
One hundred and twenty-eight new 
cases were announced yesterday in our 
State. It is the largest single 1-day in-
crease since we have been reporting. 
We have 2 additional counties that 
have now been touched out of the 102. 
We are now up to 17 counties with the 
infections. An additional 20 people at 
the DuPage County long-term care fa-
cility tested positive, bringing it to a 
total of 42—30 residents and 12 mem-
bers of that staff—in that one facility. 
Forty-one thousand unemployment 
insurance claims were filed in Illinois 
in the past 2 days. To put that in per-
spective, during the same 2 days last 
year, 4,445 were filed. That is roughly 
10 times the number of unemployment 
claims that have been filed this year. 
As I mentioned, that is 10 times the 
level of the same 2-day period a year 
ago. 
The Department of Labor reported 
this morning that 281,000 people filed 
unemployment insurance claims na-
tionwide last week, and that number is 
likely to grow. Oak Park—just to the 
west of Chicago—is the first town in Il-
linois to issue a shelter-in-place order 
for residents, which will last until 
April 3. Mayor Lightfoot for the city of 
Chicago announced the city would tem-
porarily suspend debt collection prac-
tices and nonsafety-related citations, 
as well as penalties for late payment. 
I might add that we learned last 
night that two Members of the House 
of Representatives have tested positive 
for the virus: Representatives MARIO 
DIAZ-BALART
of 
Florida 
and 
BEN 
MCADAMS
of Utah. Both developed 
symptoms last Saturday, just hours 
after voting on the coronavirus re-
sponse bill with hundreds of other 
Members. 
I have joined with Senator ROB 
PORTMAN of Ohio in proposing that we 
take into consideration the fact that 
we have critically important work to 
do in the Senate, but gathering in 
groups, as we have done historically, 
poses a health risk not just to us as 
Members and our families but to the 
staff as well as their families, the staff 
in the Senate and their families. We 
ought to be more thoughtful in terms 
of our own families and the people who 
work in the U.S. Senate. Yes, do our 
job, but do it in a sensible and thought-
ful way. 
Senator PORTMAN and I are exploring 
possibilities for remote voting by Mem-
bers of the Senate. Why is it required 
that we be physically present on the 
floor, closer to one another, than per-
haps we should be at this moment dur-
ing a public health crisis? Senator 
PORTMAN and I, on a bipartisan basis, 
are trying to find a way to achieve this 
goal and to still protect the integrity 
of the voting process in the U.S. Sen-
ate. Yes, it is new. Yes, it is different. 
Yes, it reflects the 21st century and re-
flects a challenge, the likes of which 
we have never seen. Tomorrow that 
challenge may be another public health 
crisis, some other national emergency, 
or maybe even a terrorist attack.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1821 
March 19, 2020 
Shouldn’t we be ready to make sure 
the Senate can still do its business if it 
is difficult, impossible, or not advised 
for Members of the Senate to come 
physically to the floor and announce 
their vote each time it is needed? We 
believe we should explore this on a bi-
partisan basis, and we are urging the 
leaders on both sides to look at it seri-
ously at this moment. 
I might add as well that Governor 
Pritzker spoke about the issues that 
they are facing and said to me, more 
than once, that we need Federal guid-
ance as to what we should do in our 
State. I want to salute him and the 
other Governors who are doing the best 
they can in drawing their own public 
health conclusions based on the advice 
they have received. 
I would think we need to be sensitive 
to the reality of the hospitals that are 
facing real challenges today that are 
likely to increase. What we have seen 
over the past few weeks from our 
healthcare workers on the frontline is 
nothing short of heroic. The nurses, the 
doctors, the technicians, the lab ex-
perts have done work above and beyond 
their call of duty that we hope for in 
these times of challenging crisis. I 
commend every hospital employee for 
their selflessness and quality work. 
What I am hearing from Illinois 
health officials is that hospitals are 
being stretched to the absolute limit. 
One hospital executive in central Illi-
nois told me that his cashflow runs out 
in a matter of weeks and his hospital 
may be forced to close. In downtown 
Chicago, our academic medical centers 
have activated emergency protocol and 
are burning through protective masks, 
respirators, and other equipment. 
As of Tuesday, three-fourths of the 
2,600 intensive care beds in Illinois 
were already occupied, and 40 percent 
of our 2,100 ventilators were being de-
ployed. 
For the next package that we are 
considering here—CV–3 or phase 3, 
however you characterize it—Congress 
must step in with direct, immediate as-
sistance to recognize the extreme fi-
nancial burden and equipment short-
falls of hospitals and healthcare work-
ers. This has to be priority No. 1, pe-
riod. 
Prior to this coronavirus challenge, 
one in four rural hospitals across 
America were already facing closure. If 
a rural hospital closes in your home 
State—whether it is Nebraska or Kan-
sas or Ohio or Illinois—jobs will leave, 
businesses close, and the community’s 
healthcare needs are in peril. As part of 
the measure that we are presently con-
sidering—this phase 3 or CV–3 meas-
ure—Senator JAMES LANKFORD of Okla-
homa, a Republican, and I are calling 
for inclusion of our rural hospital relief 
act, which will provide immediate re-
lief to the most financially vulnerable 
rural hospitals. These hospitals are the 
backbones of our health system in 
rural America. 
As we know, as well, many people 
soon may lose their jobs, if they 
haven’t already, because of this pan-
demic. In so many cases, losing your 
job means losing your health insur-
ance. That is why I am working to en-
sure individuals who lose their job as a 
result of this coronavirus do not also 
lose their healthcare. Under current 
law, COBRA coverage allows individ-
uals to remain on their employer-spon-
sored health insurance plan after they 
lose their jobs and otherwise become 
ineligible. There is a basic problem 
with COBRA. It costs too much and the 
employee—now 
severed 
from 
their 
work—has to pay 100 percent of the 
premiums with no employer contribu-
tions. Many people just can’t afford it. 
I think it is imperative that Congress 
step up and offer Federal funding to 
cover the costs of COBRA coverage for 
individuals who lose their jobs as a re-
sult of this pandemic. Loss of a job is 
bad enough. We can’t also sit by while 
millions of people lose their health in-
surance. 
Democrats are working on a robust 
funding package to help our U.S. mili-
tary defend our country against this 
pandemic. It includes substantial in-
creases in the capacity of military 
healthcare that will benefit the troops, 
their families, retirees, and members of 
the public. We need more resources to 
provide the National Guard with the 
means to tackle this crisis. As of 
Wednesday, nearly 2,000 Guardsmen are 
active in 54 States and territories. The 
number grows each day. The women 
and men of the National Guard are 
working 
hard, 
distributing 
meals, 
transporting medical professionals, as-
sisting with planning, and much more. 
Our States are paying for this emer-
gency mission work out of their own 
pockets. This is a national emergency. 
States need Federal assistance as the 
role of the Guard is likely to grow. 
Some may be surprised there are just 
over 4,000 beds in the entire military 
medical system. Some projections say 
we will need triple that number, and I 
want to make sure that the funding is 
there if, God forbid, we need it. 
We also need to take immediate ac-
tion to address the threat COVID–19 
poses to inmates and staff in our Fed-
eral prison system. Just yesterday, two 
Federal Bureau of Prison staff tested 
positive for COVID–19. It is only a mat-
ter of time until the virus begins to 
spread within these correction facili-
ties, if it hasn’t already. Despite this 
threat, the Trump administration has 
not requested any additional funding 
for the Bureau of Prisons to prepare for 
overtime costs. We need to make sure 
our Federal, State, and local prisons 
and jails have access to the supplies 
and personnel and resources they need. 
We need to do everything we can to 
safely release or transfer as many in-
mates as possible to home confine-
ment, particularly those vulnerable 
and elderly. 
Our economy is being ravaged by this 
public health epidemic. The Depart-
ment of Labor reported this morning 
that more than 281,000 people applied 
for jobless benefits last week, a 33-per-
cent increase from the previous week. 
Similar grim news has come out of Illi-
nois that has seen unemployment 
claims skyrocket, as I mentioned ear-
lier. These figures show us how serious 
this is for working families, under-
scoring the importance to move quick-
ly and boldly. 
Congress 
must 
immediately 
take 
steps to ensure State unemployment 
trust fund accounts have more re-
sources to get the benefits to those 
who need them. This morning, my Gov-
ernor alerted me to the fact that there 
is a cashflow problem because of these 
claims being made on the unemploy-
ment benefits account. Nationwide, 
small businesses and retailers are clos-
ing their doors—some, we hope, only 
temporarily. Restaurants are moving 
to take-out only or closing up their 
shops altogether. 
This morning, I had a webinar with 
Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. We 
expected about 100 people to partici-
pate, and over 500 did. Small businesses 
across America are very conscious of 
the threats to their continuing busi-
ness by this public health crisis. This is 
going to be a significant hit for a lot of 
small businesses. We have to be there 
to help them. 
I support a proposal that also is 
being led by my Senate colleagues, 
Senators BROWN BENNET, and BOOKER, 
to request that direct cash assistance 
beginning at $2,000 be sent to American 
families in need. This will be a crucial 
lifeline, but it alone can’t help these 
families navigate the crisis. 
I support what Senator SCHUMER said 
earlier about strengthening unemploy-
ment insurance for these same fami-
lies. A second wave of assistance is 
likely to go out. I support that as well. 
I don’t believe this is a short-lived 
crisis. We have to see it through and 
stand by the workers and their families 
all the way. 
In past times of economic crisis, we 
have seen an increase in chapter 11 
bankruptcy filings by businesses. Too 
often, these businesses have been able 
to manipulate the bankruptcy process 
to favor creditors and management 
while leaving the workers high and 
dry. We cannot let this happen again. 
For more than 10 years, I have had a 
bill to reform chapter 11 to improve 
outcomes for workers and retirees, 
most 
importantly, 
by 
doubling 
to 
$20,000 the value of worker wage claims 
that are entitled to priority payment 
in bankruptcy. 
Let’s get that reform done as part of 
the challenge of this crisis. Let’s make 
helping workers the highest priority 
when it comes to business bankruptcy. 
We also need to make clear that com-
panies 
that 
take 
Federal 
bailout 
money can’t turn around and use chap-
ter 11 to try to get rid of their collec-
tive bargaining agreements with their 
workforce. My legislation would pre-
vent this type of gaming. We need to 
get that done as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1822 
March 19, 2020 
If Congress is going to consider 
changes to make the bankruptcy proc-
ess simpler and less painful for busi-
nesses, we ought to do the same for 
workers and families. That includes 
Americans who are currently being 
crushed by student loan debt and face 
their own economic recession even be-
fore this one. If we are talking about 
relieving debts that businesses and in-
dividuals cannot pay, for goodness’ 
sake, how can we ignore the crushing 
student loan debt across America, 
which compromises the futures of the 
thousands of Americans? We need to 
take steps to forgive student debt, like 
for students who were defrauded by for- 
profit colleges—a measure we continue 
to fight Secretary DeVos over—and we 
need to restore dischargeability in 
bankruptcy for student loans once and 
for all. 
In short, bold policy ideas to help 
families during this time are not exclu-
sive to either political party. I look 
forward, as we have in the first two 
measures, to a bipartisan effort and a 
timely effort to respond. America is 
counting on us. Now is the time for us 
to produce. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
REMOTE VOTING 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate my colleague from South 
Dakota giving me a minute to respond 
to the comments of the Senator from 
Illinois about remote voting. I appre-
ciate his joining me today on a bipar-
tisan resolution to say that, during 
times of emergency and crisis, the U.S. 
Senate would be able to vote remotely 
in a secure manner. I think it is time 
for us to turn to this. 
I actually supported such legislation 
back in the House when I was there al-
most two decades ago. At the time, we 
didn’t have, frankly, the electronic 
communications we have today to be 
able to safely vote remotely; now we 
do. We have the ability to do it in a se-
cure way, in an encrypted way—a way 
that would protect the fundamental 
right to vote. I think it is important 
that we move forward with this. 
It is something that would be up to 
the majority leader and the minority 
leader to jointly agree upon. Once they 
agreed upon that, there would be 30 
days. After 30 days, Congress would 
have the vote—the Senate would have 
the vote to continue it. 
I think—not just because of COVID– 
19, where we have an obvious problem 
right now but the threat of terrorism, 
bioterrorism—these sorts of issues, un-
fortunately, are part of our 21st cen-
tury life. We have to be aware of the 
fact that this is possible. 
It is important to me and I think all 
my colleagues that article I be heard; 
that the legislative branch be heard; 
that we have the ability to convene for 
the continuity of government and not 
allow what we would normally do, 
which is perhaps to shift over to article 
II—to the executive branch—or not to 
be addressed at all. 
I thank my colleague from South Da-
kota. I thank Senator DURBIN from Illi-
nois for working with me on this 
project. My hope is we can see a change 
in our Senate rules coming out of this 
process so that we can have the ability 
to do our constitutional duties regard-
less of what is happening with regard 
to the National Capital or the crisis we 
are currently facing with COVID–19. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yes-
terday the Senate passed the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act, which 
is bipartisan legislation that will pro-
vide critical relief to American work-
ers, families, and small businesses. 
Two weeks ago, the Senate passed 
the first phase of Congress’s COVID–19 
response, and that was $8.3 billion in 
funding for coronavirus research, test-
ing, and medical care. Yesterday’s bill 
was the second phase of that response. 
The Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act will ensure that all Ameri-
cans can access coronavirus testing at 
no cost. 
The bill also ensures expanded tele-
health access for Medicare recipients 
during this outbreak, which I strongly 
support. As a resident of a rural State, 
I have long been a supporter of tele-
health for the expanded healthcare ac-
cess it can deliver for rural commu-
nities. The value of telehealth isn’t 
limited to rural States. During an out-
break like this, for example, telehealth 
services can help keep patients—par-
ticularly vulnerable, elderly patients— 
out of doctors’ offices and hospital 
waiting rooms. Patients can use a 
phone call or the internet to check in 
with their doctors for minor com-
plaints or medication followups, in-
stead of having to venture out and be 
exposed to possible coronavirus infec-
tion. I am very pleased that Medicare 
patients will have greater access to 
telehealth services during this out-
break. 
The largest part of the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act focuses on 
providing economic support for fami-
lies during this difficult time. The bill 
makes provisions for paid sick leave 
and paid family and medical leave for 
American workers, particularly for 
those who might not otherwise have 
access to these benefits. It also invests 
additional money in unemployment in-
surance where benefits are available 
for those who need them. 
I am pleased we were able to pass 
this bipartisan bill that the House pro-
duced, but there is more work to be 
done. The House bill touches on only a 
small part of what is needed to help 
Americans weather the storm, which is 
why Senate Republicans are currently 
working to develop the third phase of 
Congress’s response. 
Our legislation will address three pri-
orities: providing direct, immediate as-
sistance to American workers and fam-
ilies; giving our economy, especially 
our small businesses, the necessary 
support to weather the storm; and, of 
course, most importantly, providing 
medical professionals with the re-
sources they need to fight this virus. 
I have been working closely with col-
leagues on the Senate Commerce and 
Finance Committees to develop the 
parts of the legislation that will ad-
dress tax relief, particularly for small 
businesses, and support for industries 
that have been directly impacted by 
this pandemic, including the airline in-
dustry, which has taken a devastating 
hit from this outbreak. 
The Senate will be here as long as it 
takes to get this additional legislation 
to the President’s desk. 
These are difficult days. This is new 
territory for most of us, and there is a 
lot of uncertainty in the air. Ameri-
cans are worried about their own 
health and that of their loved ones. 
They are worried about what this out-
break will mean for their jobs and their 
financial health. It is a difficult time 
for our country. We are going to get 
through this. 
America has faced big challenges be-
fore, and we have come through them 
even stronger. This time will be no dif-
ferent. I see the strength of America 
everywhere I look—in the dedicated 
doctors and nurses putting their lives 
on the line to care for the sick and our 
first responders who are always at the 
forefront of the response to any crisis 
and the truckdrivers and grocery store 
employees and delivery workers who 
keep on doing their jobs in the face of 
the outbreak, ensuring all of us have 
the essentials we need. It is also in the 
thousands of ordinary Americans who 
are stepping up to help their neigh-
bors—running to the grocery stores for 
elderly or sick individuals, providing 
childcare for those who can’t telework, 
and looking out for those who are 
struggling financially. This is what 
will get us through. 
I and my colleagues in Congress will 
continue to do our part to ensure that 
our country has everything it needs to 
weather this crisis and to defeat this 
disease. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1823 
March 19, 2020 
First, we passed an emergency fund-
ing bill to bolster our response in the 
critical early stages of community 
spread. Since it was signed into law 
nearly 2 weeks ago, it has provided 
funding for the personal protective 
equipment our healthcare professionals 
rely on and has supported our commu-
nity health centers and State and local 
health departments. It has also bol-
stered our resources in the race to de-
velop a vaccine, possible treatments, 
and more tests. It has been a strong 
start, but we have known all along that 
it would just be the first step. As the 
scope of this virus continues to grow 
and challenge our country in new ways, 
we are working as quickly as possible 
to respond in realtime. 
As we know, more and more Ameri-
cans are staying home and practicing a 
new 
term, 
a 
new 
phrase—social 
distancing. It is one that I really had 
not heard of before this virus. While 
that is a sign of progress in our fight to 
slow the spread of the coronavirus, it is 
handicapping millions of businesses 
and workers. As travel plans are aban-
doned, as public events are canceled, 
and as restaurants and shops are clos-
ing their doors or scaling back their 
operations, many people are losing 
their jobs and their livelihoods. 
A recent poll found that nearly one 
in five American households has expe-
rienced a layoff or reduced work hours, 
and those who work in the service or 
hospitality industry are particularly 
hard hit. Think about the waiter at 
your favorite local restaurant, the per-
son who cuts your hair, the individual 
who sweeps the aisles after a basket-
ball game, the housekeeper who cleans 
rooms at a hotel. They are among the 
millions of workers across the country 
who are trying to survive this new re-
ality. 
Here in the Senate, we are working 
as quickly as possible to support them. 
Yesterday, we passed a bill to help in-
dividuals and families who face eco-
nomic fallout from this outbreak. We 
improved paid sick leave for those who 
have been impacted by the coronavirus, 
and we have strengthened our food se-
curity for Americans of all ages. We 
also made coronavirus testing free for 
all Americans. No one should be afraid 
to get tested because of the cost. 
For all of the benefits this legislation 
will deliver, it will not address every 
problem. We knew that it would just be 
the second step in a journey of undeter-
mined length. Yet, rather than holding 
that bill up and doing nothing, in order 
to include additional measures we 
would like to see, we worked as quickly 
as possible to put that second phase 
into action, and we then moved on to 
phase 3. 
In building on the first two steps we 
have taken, it is time to make bold 
moves to support our economy. We 
need to be sure it can survive this pan-
demic in the short term and thrive in 
the long term. The American people 
are resilient. We have been through na-
tional disasters, like 9/11 and the huge 
economic meltdown and great reces-
sion of 2008, but in my experience, we 
have never had anything quite like the 
coronavirus pandemic. Yet the Amer-
ican people have always maintained 
their 
good 
attitudes 
and 
worked 
through these crises and have come out 
stronger and better in the end. 
As I mentioned, the shift in our daily 
routines is having a serious impact on 
the businesses we are used to sup-
porting every day in our local commu-
nities. Sadly, those small businesses 
that employ about half of all U.S. 
workers are among the hardest hit. 
Here is the thing. They bear no respon-
sibility for the economic conditions 
they find themselves in. This is some-
thing totally beyond our control. 
The restaurants, the hardware stores, 
the salons, the gyms, and the countless 
other small businesses that are oper-
ated by our neighbors are facing tough 
decisions. Over the last couple of days, 
I have talked about a number of my 
constituents, fellow Texans, who are 
experiencing hardship—one whose rev-
enue is down about 60 percent, one who 
is rotating her employees so each can 
at least get some work, and one who is 
terrified that this could sink the busi-
ness he has worked on for 25 years. 
As we continue working on this third 
phase of the coronavirus response and 
recovery, my top priority is to support 
these small business owners and their 
employees, who have been left with no 
way to collect paychecks, no way to 
provide for their families, and no way 
to provide for the necessities of life. 
Yesterday, Senate Republicans met 
with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and 
discussed wide-ranging proposals to 
provide relief to workers and small 
businesses. There is one thing we all 
agreed on. We need to take immediate 
action to put money directly into the 
hands of these displaced workers. Work 
opportunities may be disappearing for 
some workers, but the expenses don’t 
go away. People need money to buy 
groceries, to pay their bills, and to 
stay afloat until things normalize. 
There are ongoing discussions about 
the most efficient and most effective 
way to get money into the hands of 
those who have been the most nega-
tively impacted, but I want to assure 
all Texans we are working as quickly 
as possible to find the best solution. 
The centerpiece of the phase 3 deal will 
be that of direct aid to American work-
ers who have been displaced, but it 
must also include additional actions to 
protect the integrity of our healthcare 
system. As more and more people are 
being tested and diagnosed, our hos-
pitals and healthcare providers are 
needing additional support so they can 
continue to serve patients. We are 
working to get our healthcare pro-
viders the resources and equipment 
they need so they can continue fight-
ing this virus on the frontlines. 
I thank the majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, for publicly committing 
to keep the Senate here in session until 
we pass legislation that meets these 
high demands—a decision that I fully 
support. 
While the Senate’s work continues, I 
know many Americans are feeling 
some helplessness and uncertainty at a 
time when the best thing you can do 
may be to just stay home. While older 
Americans face a higher risk if they 
come into contact with the virus, every 
one of us has a role we can play in 
beating this virus. 
I reiterate remarks made earlier this 
week by Dr. Deborah Birx, who is co-
ordinating 
the 
White 
House 
Coronavirus Task Force. She continues 
to 
stress 
the 
importance 
of 
millennials—one of the largest genera-
tion cohorts—in saying that this is the 
core group who will stop this virus. 
We all know young people feel bullet-
proof and that their lives will be eter-
nal. Many a time, they don’t under-
stand that they are just as mortal as 
the rest of us. Because these younger 
individuals are at a lower risk of con-
tracting the virus, they think it is fine 
to continue with their normal routines 
as long as they aren’t experiencing 
symptoms. Yet, if they are infected, 
they can still transmit the virus to 
others, especially to the older, more 
vulnerable people in their commu-
nities. 
Dr. Birx has pointed out that we 
often talk about the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ which is the World War II gen-
eration—people like my mom and dad 
and those who answered the call to 
serve and fought for our freedoms. Yet 
now is the time for the younger genera-
tion, the millennials, to answer a dif-
ferent call and take the necessary pre-
cautions to protect that ‘‘greatest gen-
eration,’’ which is among the most vul-
nerable. 
I am proud of the fact that, when 
Texas faces a crisis, whether it be hur-
ricanes or tornadoes that have dev-
astated our State in recent years, Tex-
ans come together and support one an-
other. The truth is, this is also how I 
would describe Americans when they 
react to an attack, whether it be 9/11, 
the great recession of 2008, or now this 
coronavirus. 
This is not a time for us to engage in 
business as usual. This is a time for us 
to come together in a new and very im-
portant but different way. Stay home, 
and take this seriously. We will get 
through this together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1824 
March 19, 2020 
are the responsibility of individuals, 
things like staying at home if you are 
sick—frankly, staying home if you are 
more likely than others to be sick—and 
practicing the kinds of hygiene our 
mothers taught us we should follow all 
along. Personally, I may have set a 
new personal record for just washing 
my hands in the last 2 weeks. I have 
never been averse to washing my 
hands, but I don’t know that I have 
ever washed them half a dozen times a 
day or more before. Those kinds of 
things are left up to us. 
Then there are things that are left up 
to the local level, things like deter-
mining in a local community whether 
things should be open or not and what 
kinds of activities should be the activi-
ties where you draw the lines in terms 
of crowds. That is more likely to be 
better decided at a local level by even 
a State or, more likely, by a mayor or 
a county executive than by somebody 
here in Washington. 
Then at the national level, we are 
moving toward our third package now 
in the last few days to try to deal with 
this. The first package was about $8 
billion, which was really focused on the 
immediate health response—supplies, 
developing a vaccine, trying to figure 
out what the right therapies were, un-
derstanding the things we needed to do 
to further help hospitals get ready and 
to further encourage people to go 
places other than hospitals when that 
worked. All of those things were part 
of that first package. 
The package we sent to the President 
that the President signed last night 
was about $100 billion. By almost any 
standard, it is a huge amount of money 
to put together in just a short period of 
time. That $100 billion, while it contin-
ued to work on the healthcare side, was 
also very focused on just keeping peo-
ple on a payroll if they are on a pay-
roll. That $100 billion focused to a 
great extent on how you keep people 
who have decided they need to be quar-
antined or who were in quarantine by a 
doctor or by a business that, in fact, 
was 
quarantined 
because 
it 
was 
closed—keeping those people on that 
payroll and continuing to keep that 
part of our economy going. 
Today, we move to the third package, 
which is $1 trillion—$8 billion, $100 bil-
lion, now $1 trillion. That $1 trillion is 
designed to continue to do all the other 
things that I talked about but also de-
signed to keep this economy at a point 
where, when we get through this, we 
will be as nearly to where we would 
have been otherwise if at all possible. 
You know, interestingly, here we are 
going into a situation where we are 
trying to protect an economy that 
didn’t have any systemic problems 
with it. It was an economy that was by 
all measures unbelievably good, and 
then suddenly people are encouraged— 
sometimes 
required—to 
back 
away 
from that economy and to cease par-
ticipating in lots of that economy, 
partly because we have encouraged 
part of that economy to cease being 
part of the active economy. 
What do we do there? This is going to 
be a different kind of response, more 
focused in many cases. Where, in the 
past, people have said ‘‘We need more 
of your money,’’ many of the requests 
are ‘‘We just need to have access to 
more money that we can easily pay 
back when we get through this. We are 
willing to have securitized loans. We 
are willing to have lots of things,’’ fig-
uring out how to deal with that liquid-
ity issue. 
Then there are some things we need 
to put in this package that simply the 
government is going to have to look at 
in ways we haven’t looked at before. I 
want to spend a few minutes talking 
about one of those things today, which, 
just frankly, is securing our medical 
supply chain. 
In the past, the idea that we would 
worry about the supply chain would 
not have been at the top of the list of 
the things the American people would 
be thinking needed to be on the first 
list they needed to look at when they 
think about public health, but what we 
see happening now is a direct reminder 
that the medical supplies we use can 
come from all over the world. 
In a pandemic, everybody in the 
world may think they need what you 
think you would have received and ex-
pected to get more than they think 
they should send it to you. 
We depend on manufacturers in other 
countries. Approximately 40 percent of 
the finished drugs and 80 percent of the 
active pharmaceutical ingredients are 
manufactured overseas—primarily in 
China and India. The ongoing global 
coronavirus outbreak has really high-
lighted for the first time in today’s 
supply chain what happens if you 
might not be able to get what you need 
when you need it. It is also a spotlight 
on our supply chain challenges gen-
erally. I think that, as a result of this, 
we are going to look at that sooner 
than we would have, but right now, in 
this bill, I am hoping we include an im-
mediate look because we have quickly 
gone through a series of warning signs 
now that make us understand why we 
need to look at this and look at it now. 
On February 27, the Food and Drug 
Administration announced the first 
coronavirus-related 
drug 
shortage— 
February 27. On March 10, the FDA 
halted its routine overseas inspections 
of drugs and devices. Last week, State 
health departments and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention raised 
concerns about the looming shortage of 
coronavirus extraction kit reagents 
needed to actually conduct the diag-
nostic test, not to mention some con-
cerns about the swab you might need, 
in some cases, to take just the normal 
flu exam. 
It is more and more clear that pro-
tecting our Nation’s medical supply 
chain is both a priority for public 
health and for national security. 
Obviously, the supply chain has be-
come more and more global. Economic 
efficiency makes sense, and being more 
competitive makes sense. It is fine to 
buy things from other countries, but it 
is better if you have multiple options. 
It is better if you have other options, 
including domestic production. That is 
especially true when it comes to vital 
things, like medical devices, medical 
supplies, pharmaceuticals, or the prod-
ucts we need for public health and safe-
ty. 
We see how this is a problem. It is a 
problem that has sort of come upon us 
in this pandemic environment in a way 
that we had not thought we would have 
to deal with before, but we do have to 
deal with it. We are hoping, with this 
bill, this is one of the places we can 
deal with it. 
You know, in our supply chain, gen-
erally, if you are making something 
and it takes 300 parts and you have 299 
of them, you are in really good shape, 
except you can’t make what you hope 
to make because you don’t have that 
one essential 300th part. If you are re-
lying on factories in China or South 
Korea or some other place that have 
shut down temporarily, suddenly your 
factory has become too dependent on a 
partner that is no longer there. 
So a bipartisan group of Senators— 
including myself and Senator ALEX-
ANDER and Senator DURBIN and Senator 
MURRAY—has written legislation to fig-
ure out how to assess our vulnerability 
in the global supply chain for medical 
supplies. We want the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine to look at this issue and to 
look at it now, to look at this issue and 
determine how dependent we have real-
ly become on supplies from other coun-
tries and then to make recommenda-
tions as to what some of our options 
might be. We would also like to hear 
their views on how they can make our 
supply chain more resilient for critical 
drugs and equipment; what kind of 
backup plan we need to always be 
thinking about if our frontline plan 
continues to be that other partner in 
another country; what our quick, go-to 
backup is and how essential it is that 
we have that backup. That would in-
clude asking how we can encourage do-
mestic manufacturers of some things 
to be able to step up and reorient what 
they do when they need it and in a cri-
sis. 
The President, to some extent, ad-
dressed this idea yesterday by talking 
about a defense manufacturing strat-
egy. That defense manufacturing strat-
egy may need to be more robust in 
some areas. Whether it is component 
parts to a medical device or pharma-
ceutical ingredients or simply the 
gloves and masks and swab sticks and 
things 
that 
you 
need 
for 
basic 
healthcare when you are trying to de-
termine what your healthcare environ-
ment is and then deal with it, we need 
to look at it. 
One example may be just, again, the 
daily dependence on the daily protec-
tive equipment that our healthcare 
providers have. We are interested to 
know what we need to do over the next 
60 to 90 days and what we need to do

over the next 2 or 3 years. That is what 
we are going to be asking this commis-
sion to look at, and we want it to look 
at it quickly. 
This is a priority. It has become an 
immediate priority. We need to know, 
as we now look at another one of these 
in a series of epidemics where this has 
been a concern; whether it is Ebola or 
swine flu, or bird flu or Zika or SARS, 
we have had too many of these in too 
short a period of time. And during that 
same period of time, the globalization 
of the supply chain has dramatically 
changed. 
So as we prepare for future hazards, 
we want to ensure that a supply chain 
is in place to allow us to provide the 
kind of healthcare we need, the kind of 
response we need, and the kind of pro-
tection we need. This should be part of 
the bill we send to the President, hope-
fully, between now and no later than 
the end of next week. It is one of the 
things that will begin to move us in a 
better direction and create greater se-
curity—greater health security—as we 
look at our other security concerns. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, like my 
colleague from Missouri, I also rise to 
address the Nation’s response to the 
COVID–19 virus. In particular, I want 
to discuss the next steps we need to 
take at the Federal level to deal with 
this health emergency and the severe 
economic dislocation resulting from it. 
Before I offer my comments, I want 
to offer some thanks. I want to thank 
the Senate staff and all those in the 
Capitol who are working here under 
tough circumstances. 
I notice that the pages are not here, 
and that is because the Senate has 
wisely decided that, while we ought to 
be here doing the people’s business, 
even at some risk to ourselves, the 
young people who would normally be 
here should be home with their fami-
lies. 
I want to thank healthcare workers 
all across the United States. They are 
doing very difficult work right now, 
and they are doing it under very stress-
ful circumstances. So many people who 
work at our healthcare facilities are 
there trying to protect patients. They 
have kids in schools that have been 
closed, and they are grappling with 
where their own children are during 
the day and whether they can find 
childcare during what would normally 
be the school day. I particularly want 
to thank them. 
Finally, I want to thank the Amer-
ican public. I will return to this point 
at the end of my comments. 
We are not an authoritarian nation. 
There are steps that other nations are 
taking with respect to this virus, 
where they can sort of order or quar-
antine in ways that we can’t here. 
What we do here depends upon the con-
sent of the governed, and the guide-
lines about social distancing, for exam-
ple, require some significant sacrifice. 
Overwhelmingly, I see Americans tak-
ing steps to make that sacrifice, and I 
want to thank them. 
I applaud the bipartisan work that 
Congress has done with the White 
House in the past 2 weeks to pass two 
important laws. We passed the supple-
mental appropriations bill, providing 
more than $8 billion to invest in our 
public health response with resources 
for States, territories, and Tribes, in-
vestments in vaccine development and 
testing, and other key health prior-
ities. 
Just yesterday, the Senate passed 
the second piece of legislation to pro-
vide emergency relief for workers and 
their families: paid sick leave, ex-
tended unemployment insurance, and 
other measures. But we still have so 
much more to do, and I am going to be 
very candid about this. 
I offer these thoughts as a former 
mayor and Governor who has overseen 
significant emergency response efforts 
in my city and in my State: hurri-
canes, floods, mass shootings, the H1N1 
epidemic, and the economic collapse of 
2008 and 2009. While those give me a 
perspective on what must be done, I 
have to acknowledge that the current 
challenge is a massive one, arguably 
bigger than any I have seen in my life. 
Because it is so big, it will require un-
usual degrees of innovation and co-
operation, and the need for that inno-
vation and cooperation is urgent. 
I got off a phone call this morning— 
and I am sure all 100 of my colleagues 
are making calls like this. I got on the 
phone with my fellow Virginia Senator, 
Mr. WARNER, to talk to Virginia’s hos-
pitals. Now, Virginia is a State that, 
economically, is pretty well off. It gen-
erally tends to have top-quarter per- 
capita income for a significant metro-
politan area, but the stories from my 
hospitals were just, frankly, shocking. 
They can’t get tests to test patients 
who are presenting with symptoms of 
COVID–19. If they have tests, they 
don’t have the swabs to administer the 
test or they don’t have some of the 
chemical components needed so that 
once a swab is taken, they can run the 
test to determine whether somebody 
has the virus or not. 
They don’t have masks. Hospitals 
were telling me that masks, which 
they would normally buy for about $1 
apiece, are now being charged at $9 
apiece with severely limited quan-
tities. 
Major hospitals in a major metro-
politan area like Northern Virginia, on 
the testing front—one of my hospitals 
said they got enough tests from their 
main supplier to test 40 people. That 
lasted for about 2 days. And when they 
said ‘‘We need more tests,’’ the supplier 
said ‘‘Well, look, we only have so much 
that we can distribute. That is all you 
get.’’ 
When I heard this story, one after the 
next—and I know I live in a nation 
with not only the best healthcare pro-
viders but the best healthcare institu-
tions in the world—I had to ask myself: 
Where am I? Is this the United States 
of America, where a hospital treating 
people on a global pandemic cannot get 
a mask, cannot get a swab, cannot get 
a test? Why are nations like South 
Korea and Australia and the United 
Kingdom so much more able to do 
things this country should be able to 
do? 
I don’t think we should become nor-
malized or just accept that. I think 
this is so profound a question about 
why 
this 
Nation, 
with 
the 
best 
healthcare 
providers 
and 
the 
best 
healthcare institutions in the world, is 
so far behind other nations. So let me 
offer 
these 
recommendations—blunt 
recommendations—for the road ahead. 
First, in the words of the Hippocratic 
Oath, do no harm. The administration 
lost 6 to 8 weeks in responding to this 
crisis—critical time that was used pro-
ductively by other nations—because 
the President continually downplayed 
the threat of COVID–19. 
No American has a louder micro-
phone than he does, and again and 
again he downplayed the threat, sug-
gested it was contained, suggested ev-
eryone would be tested, suggested it 
was a hoax, and suggested the Demo-
crats or the Chinese or the media were 
blowing it out of proportion. Whether 
his comments were due to ignorance or 
a political desire to hide bad news is ir-
relevant. 
I was shocked that the President sub-
mitted a budget to Congress on Feb-
ruary 10, when the virus’s global spread 
was clear to all, that dramatically cut 
funding for key public health agen-
cies—the NIH, CDC, HHS—and our in-
vestments in global partnerships like 
the World Health Organization. The 
White House foolishly eliminated the 
global health security team at the Na-
tional Security Council that was set up 
after the Ebola crisis to practically 
deal with pandemics like COVID–19. 
I remain stunned—stunned—that the 
President’s lawyers are still in court 
all over this country attempting to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act to take 
healthcare 
away 
from 
millions 
of 
Americans. There is never a good 
time—never—to take an ax to the pub-
lic health infrastructure and scheme to 
take away people’s health insurance, 
but there is surely no worse time to do 
it—to take an ax to the public health 
infrastructure and take away people’s 
health insurance—than during a global 
pandemic. 
So my recommendations here are 
pretty 
simple. 
Quit 
lying 
and 
downplaying the threat. Let the trust-
ed scientists and public health leaders 
in your administration take center 
stage. 
In recent days, the President seems 
to have adopted this approach, thank 
goodness, and it is long overdue. Con-
gress should ignore the President’s 
budget that urged foolish cuts to our 
public health infrastructure, and the

March 19, 2020 
administration should cease efforts to 
dismantle the Affordable Care Act. 
One more thing: Quit the inflam-
matory China-bashing. Did this virus 
originate in China? Yes. But, Mr. Presi-
dent, that does not excuse your weeks 
and weeks of tweeting lies and misin-
formation about the virus, while the 
leaders of other nations were taking 
steps to make sure their populations 
could be safe. 
The fact that the virus originated in 
China does not excuse the massive 
missteps that have led to the United 
States being so far behind other na-
tions in the world in the ability to pro-
vide testing—basic testing—to citizens, 
including citizens who have serious 
signs of illness. The President’s deci-
sion to call this the China virus or 
Wuhan virus or other epithets that he 
and members of his team have used are 
a crass effort to deflect blame away 
from the acceptance of responsibility 
that a President should have. 
The buck stops with you, Mr. Presi-
dent. You cannot blame this on anyone 
else. You have to own responsibility. 
You should stop inflammatory China- 
bashing that is exposing Asian Ameri-
cans in this country to prejudice. 
The second thing we need to do is 
continue to focus, first and foremost, 
on managing the public health crisis 
presented by COVID–19. The economic 
dislocation is significant. We are work-
ing on a package with respect to that 
now. I am going to talk about it in a 
minute, but no economic intervention 
will work if the American public con-
tinues to lack confidence in our public 
health response. And a strong public 
health response that will effectively 
manage the spread of this virus and co-
ordinate medical care for those af-
fected will be the single best strategy 
for enabling the economy to get back 
on track. 
To accomplish this public health 
goal, we need to have strong policy at 
the Federal level to make—continue to 
make—science-based recommendations 
on the extent and timing of social 
distancing guidelines. 
We need to overcome the shockingly 
poor start to testing Americans for the 
virus. Testing helps us flatten the 
curve of the infection so that our 
health system is not overwhelmed, and 
it also helps reduce anxiety by giving 
people information about their status 
so they know what to do. 
Americans are used to being tested. 
If we feel ill, we go to a doctor. We get 
a test to see if we have a flu. We get a 
test to see if we have pneumonia. We 
get our children tested to see if they 
have strep throat. We are used to this, 
and when we see it happening around 
the globe, and when we hear the Presi-
dent and Vice President say that ev-
erybody will get tested, but when peo-
ple call their healthcare providers and 
are told that there are no tests or see 
drive-thru testing sites, such as ones 
we had in Hampton Roads, shut down 
after a day and a half because they ran 
out of tests, it tremendously raises 
their anxiety. 
We need to continue the good work 
that is already being done to accelerate 
the development of a safe and effective 
vaccine. We need to make sure that our 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare 
providers 
have the resources they need to treat 
sick people and protect their frontline 
health workers. 
Finally, this is looking down the 
road a bit, but I think it is important 
that we think about it now. Policy-
makers should try to develop the 
science-based criteria that will enable 
them to confidently tell Americans 
when it is time to return to normal so-
cial and economic activity. I remember 
President Bush doing that at some 
point after 9/11. He said: It is now safe. 
It is time for Americans to go back to 
normal, everyday activity. A strong 
signal of that type, when it is war-
ranted by science, will be critical— 
critical—to our recovery. That day 
may be weeks or months away, but de-
veloping the criteria that we can agree 
on that should be the signal for a re-
turn to relevant normalcy is something 
we should all be working on right now. 
Third, we should make full use of 
State and local governments. Polling 
shows that Americans are skeptical 
about what they hear about this virus 
from President Trump and, indeed, 
Washington. But the same poll shows 
that they do have trust in how State 
and local officials are handling this cri-
sis. Use the network of State and local 
officials to communicate clear mes-
sages. Continuously seek their input on 
how their schools, hospitals, nursing 
homes, and local economies are af-
fected. That is what I am doing every 
day, and I suspect every Member of the 
Senate is doing the same thing—con-
ference calls with leaders around my 
State to make sure that we are doing 
the things that are most helpful. And 
we should reality test any legislation, 
especially an economic package, with 
these leaders to make sure it is respon-
sive to the real needs they are seeing 
on the ground. 
Fourth, Congress needs to move 
promptly to pass this strong economic 
package, backstopping the American 
economy 
from 
being 
ravaged 
by 
COVID–19. 
In 2008, structural issues like the ac-
cumulation of debt, bad public policy 
leaving huge swaths of economic trans-
actions unregulated, and predatory 
mortgage practices helped bring down 
not only the American but the global 
financial system. 
Today, the American economy has 
been performing relatively well, and it 
now labors under a severe healthcare 
shock. There is reason to believe that, 
once we get the healthcare strategy 
right, we will be poised for the econ-
omy to resume its upward trajectory. 
But we must provide protection and 
support in the meantime. 
I believe that the focus of an eco-
nomic package should be workers and 
small businesses. They are the most 
vulnerable to the current challenge and 
most in need of intervention. 
This is the message that I am hear-
ing again and again as I talk to Vir-
ginia residents and business leaders. I 
had a wonderful conversation with the 
president of my statewide chamber of 
commerce the other day, and he said 
candidly: Look, more of our members 
are actually medium and large busi-
nesses, but the most important thing 
you can do is focus on the needs of 
small businesses and their employees. 
I appreciated that he was advocating 
even for a business sector that isn’t the 
core of his membership, but this is 
what he was hearing and what I think 
most of us are hearing. 
I support direct cash payments to 
low- and middle-income Americans and 
their dependents to help them through 
this crisis, and it is nice to hear there 
may be some agreement on that. I sup-
port strategies to provide grants and 
loans to small businesses, particularly 
if they use those resources to keep em-
ployees on the payroll. I hope direct 
support to individuals and small busi-
nesses will be the heart of the eco-
nomic package that the Senate, the 
White House, and the House put to-
gether. 
Now, for the larger businesses and in-
dustry sectors who need Federal help, 
we have to stand ready to assist, but if 
we are to invest in these businesses yet 
again, a few years after providing them 
with massive and—in my view—unnec-
essary tax breaks, we must not simply 
rescue them but demand that they re-
form, and our investments must be de-
signed to keep workers on payrolls to 
the maximum extent possible. 
The Business Roundtable, an influen-
tial voice for the business community, 
said last year that businesses need to 
expand their priorities beyond share-
holder concerns and invest in employ-
ees by compensating them fairly, pro-
viding important benefits, and sup-
porting communities they work in. I 
couldn’t agree more. These businesses 
employ many Americans and deliver us 
important goods and services, but if 
American taxpayers are stepping in to 
cover their losses, I think it is fair to 
expect and, indeed, require that these 
businesses channel the benefits toward 
people who are on their payroll, who 
work for wages and salaries, not those 
who live off investment income. 
I will do all I can in the coming days 
to help shape our economic package to 
make it responsive to these goals. 
Fifth—and in this I echo some of the 
comments made by my colleague from 
Missouri—the crisis does raise long- 
term questions that must be addressed 
going forward. We have to have real 
discussions about the virtues and dis-
advantages of global interconnected-
ness. Better travel leads to economic 
growth and a better understanding of 
the world, and it also facilitates the 
spread of viruses. Instantaneous global 
communication networks are an eco-
nomic plus but increase vulnerability 
to cyber attack. 
How do we increase American resil-
ience to these threats without inhib-
iting our economic prospects? There

are elements of our supply chains— 
pharmaceuticals and medical products 
and supplies in particular—that must 
be viewed through a national security 
lens and progressively brought back to 
this country to enhance safety and an 
adequate supply of supplies in times 
like this. 
A second long-term question that has 
been raised for years by my Virginia 
colleague Senator WARNER deals with 
the new reality of how Americans 
work. Many of the people most affected 
by this shock would be part-time and 
gig workers. The safety-net mecha-
nisms that our policies provide for full- 
time workers who get a W–2 every year 
are not as available to the increasing 
percentage of the American workforce 
who are in multiple part-time jobs 
without benefits or who work as inde-
pendent contractors or are otherwise 
self-employed. 
In addition to making sure that the 
economic relief package provides as-
sistance to this large group of Ameri-
cans, we have to examine our work-
force policies so that these workers 
also have a social safety net to fall 
back on during times of crisis. 
Finally, every American needs to do 
their part to confront this crisis. The 
best way to slow the spread of COVID– 
19 and minimize its impact to individ-
uals, to our healthcare system, and to 
our economy is to adhere to science- 
based social distancing and personal 
hygiene recommendations in our ev-
eryday lives. 
Because America is not an authori-
tarian nation, there are some options 
used by other nations that will not 
likely be used here. Our public health 
measures will depend upon the coopera-
tion and adherence of every single per-
son. Sacrifice is hard, but a modest 
sacrifice in the near term can help save 
the lives of people we love. 
So I implore every Virginian and 
every American to follow the rec-
ommendations we get from our public 
health officials and find ways to safely 
reach out and connect with friends and 
family during this challenging time. 
To my colleagues: We must rise to 
meet this challenge. This is one of the 
moments for which we were destined to 
be in the Senate. The people we serve 
are relying on us to calmly and 
promptly address a grave health crisis 
with the tools needed to keep families 
safe and protect the American econ-
omy. It is a serious responsibility. May 
we all live up to it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

SECURING AMERICA’S MEDICINE 
CABINET 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, we 
are continuing to roll out our response 
to the coronavirus and to this pan-
demic, and I want to encourage my col-
leagues to begin to think about how we 
move past this immediate crisis that 
we are in and begin to look toward 
what is going to happen in the future 
with 
our 
supply 
chains 
and 
our 
healthcare delivery systems. 
As we talk about the problems that 
are before us today, let us not forget 
that 3 months from now, 6 months from 
now, a year from now, we need to be 
looking at today and say: Here were 
the lessons learned, and these are the 
steps that we have taken to make cer-
tain that it doesn’t happen again. 
What we have learned and what 
many Americans know is something 
that some of us started working on a 
couple of years back. It was looking at 
the fact that Americans and American 
drug manufacturers rely heavily on 
Chinese companies to produce active 
pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, 
as they are called. We also know that 
bad actors in China are poised to use 
that vulnerability as leverage and to 
use it as a way to disrupt and interrupt 
the supply chain of those active phar-
maceutical ingredients coming into 
our country. 
This is an issue that we cannot wait 
to address. This is something we need 
to do right now. That is why my col-
league 
from 
New 
Jersey, 
Senator 
MENENDEZ, and I introduced the Secur-
ing America’s Medicine Cabinet Act, or 
the SAM-C Act, as a way to encourage 
and increase American manufacturing 
of these active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents. 
Here is what it would do. It would ex-
pand upon the Emerging Technology 
Program, which is housed within the 
FDA, to prioritize issues related to na-
tional security and critical drug short-
ages and bring that pharmaceutical 
manufacturing out of China and back 
into the United States, not in 5 years 
or 10 years but now. It is something 
that we need to do right now. 
In addition, the SAM-C Act author-
izes $100 million to develop centers of 
excellence 
for 
advanced 
pharma-
ceutical manufacturing in order to de-
velop these innovations. These centers 
will be partnerships between institutes 
of learning and the private sector. Cer-
tainly, we have talked a lot about pub-
lic-private partnerships and the neces-
sity of them to move us through this 
crisis, and we have cheered as the 
President has brought private sector 
companies into the White House to 
work with him on addressing these 
issues. 
One thing we have to realize—and 
why this is important that we do it 
now—is that the number of API manu-
facturing facilities in China is still 
growing. China has found a vulnerabil-
ity in our system, and it is continuing 
to exploit that vulnerability. Although 
we don’t yet know down to the precise 
percentage how dependent we are on 
these Chinese APIs, we do know that 
the more Chinese products that flow 
into the United States, the more poten-
tial there is for trouble and the more 
vulnerable our supply chain is. 
The bottom line is that, if we con-
tinue to rely on the Chinese to stay 
healthy, we will be doing so at our own 
peril. So I am asking my colleagues to 
join Senator MENENDEZ and me and 
support this legislation as a part of 
these coronavirus response efforts that 
we are making. 
The 
spread 
of 
the 
Chinese 
coronavirus 
has 
put 
considerable 
strains on our healthcare delivery sys-
tem. Primary care physicians are over-
booked, and potential patients are 
afraid of going to clinics at all for fear 
of putting an elderly or a vulnerable 
person at risk. I am in daily contact 
with physicians’ offices and nurses’ 
practices. I am hearing from those who 
care for the elderly and from care-
givers for those who have complex 
medical conditions, and this is a pri-
mary concern. For that reason, con-
versations here on Capitol Hill have 
turned 
toward 
boosting 
telehealth 
services in order to free up in-person 
appointments for those who need them 
the most. 
I am so grateful that the Vice Presi-
dent and the coronavirus task force 
have made this a priority. We appre-
ciate that. The coverage of these ef-
forts has made telemedicine feel, to 
many, like a new concept, but thank 
goodness we started building the foun-
dation to support healthcare tech-
nology years before COVID–19 spread 
beyond China’s borders. 
As just a little bit of history, back in 
2015, when I was over in the House, I in-
troduced the SOFTWARE Act, which 
was to eliminate redtape that was pre-
venting innovation in healthcare deliv-
ery. The bill ended up being rolled into 
a piece of legislation called the 21st 
Century Cures Act, which we passed 
through the House in late 2015. In 2016, 
it cleared the Senate. 
The SOFTWARE Act directs the FDA 
to come up with a more efficient way 
of approving healthcare software so it 
will not discourage innovation because, 
at that point, that is what we were be-
ginning to see. The redtape would just 
pile up on the new concepts in delivery, 
and by the time one would get ap-
proved, a new generation of technology 
would begin to emerge. 
SOFTWARE’s provisions made it pos-
sible for regulators and the private sec-
tor to bring us a lot of new innova-
tions. We have Teladoc, Noom, Fitbit, 
and hundreds of other healthcare appli-
cations that we carry on our mobile de-
vices. We have also seen many hos-
pitals conduct post-operation care to 
patients once they go home. They are 
entering their data on iPads that are 
specific to their surgeries, and those 
physicians are monitoring their care 
and recoveries. This push for respon-
sible tech policy has gone hand in hand 
with efforts to bring broadband to 
rural and unserved areas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1828 
March 19, 2020 
Last year, I introduced the Internet 
Exchange Act, which enables these 
communities to support the high-speed 
internet connections that the tele-
health software requires. Now, we all 
know that you cannot have access to 
21st century healthcare or emergency 
response without having access to 
high-speed internet. These concepts go 
hand in hand. At a time when we are 
facing a global pandemic and the im-
pact that this has on our country and 
our citizens, we know everyone needs 
that access and should be able to go in 
and access this care. 
Last year, as part of a rural health 
agenda that my team and I developed 
in working with our State and local 
electeds, I introduced the Telehealth 
Across State Lines Act so that we 
could bring healthcare to the patient 
rather than always taking the patient 
to the healthcare. I am so appreciative 
that Administrator Verma, of CMS, is 
paying close attention to this and is 
working carefully to relax some of the 
rules. 
Telehealth Across State Lines would 
lead to the creation of uniform na-
tional best practices for the provision 
of telemedicine across State lines. Sec-
ond, it would set up a grant program to 
expand existing telehealth programs 
and incentivize the adoption of tele-
health by Medicare and Medicaid—two 
things that are needed. 
We have seen these gaps in access to 
care. This is one way we can make cer-
tain that everyone, during these times 
of a pandemic, has access to care. Any-
one who has ever videoconferenced into 
a meeting—and I will tell you that my 
staff has been doing that with employ-
ers and with organizations and with 
citizens around our State—knows this 
is a game-changer during a time when 
people are not able to go in for meet-
ings. 
My support for telemedicine has been 
grounded in more than just conven-
ience. The forethought behind this 
push for telemedicine was to ask: How 
do we make it more accessible? How do 
we make certain the care you are able 
to receive does not depend on the ZIP 
Code in which you live? Right now, as 
we are talking about testing and com-
municating with doctors and being cu-
rious as to if we have symptoms and 
how to treat symptoms, accessibility is 
so important. 
What we have learned from the dan-
gers posed by fears of the Wuhan, 
China, coronavirus and the spreading 
of this virus is that it has made us re-
alize that, actually, telemedicine and 
access to telemedicine makes accessing 
healthcare safer in so many instances— 
for the elderly, for those who are home-
bound, for those with complex medical 
situations. 
My colleagues will recall, during the 
first meeting that our conference had 
with the administration regarding the 
coronavirus response, I specifically 
asked officials with the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services to 
push for the temporary relief of section 
No. 1135 regulations, which would pre-
vent patients from taking advantage of 
telehealth services. Aren’t we grateful 
that this has been lifted? I thank Presi-
dent Trump for green-lighting that. It 
is what you call a win for consumers 
who have a difficult time in getting to 
physicians’ offices. 
It is time for Medicaid and private 
health insurers to get on board and 
cover these telehealth services. For our 
private insurers, it will make it easier 
for those who are covered under their 
insurance plans to get to the care they 
need in a timely manner. For our State 
Medicaid officials, this will involve re-
thinking some of their licensures and 
other procedures. For insurance com-
panies, it will involve making complex 
but responsible business decisions. 
Let’s remember we are all in this 
fight together against the coronavirus. 
We are in this fight together. It is up 
to us to find solutions as to how Amer-
icans are going to be able to access the 
care they need when they need it. We 
need to address these things imme-
diately because this is no longer our 
just talking about convenience or our 
being able to call in to a meeting. The 
coronavirus has evolved into a global 
threat. Technology that can spare peo-
ple from the risk of exposure should 
not be seen as a luxury or only avail-
able to a few. We have the tools we 
need to suppress the transmission of 
COVID–19 in the United States, and we 
have a plan to secure our pharma-
ceutical and our healthcare supply 
chains. 
It is time to get it done. We are the 
United States of America. We can come 
together and respond to this attack by 
this virus. We can defeat it, and we can 
make certain there is a way to provide 
access to healthcare for all Americans 
regardless of the ZIP Codes in which 
they live.

CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
our Nation confronts this health crisis 
and the economic crisis it is spawning, 
Senate Republicans have prepared a 
bold legislative proposal. I am offi-
cially introducing the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act. 
This legislation takes bold action on 
four major priorities that are ex-
tremely urgent and very necessary: 
first, direct financial help for the 
American people; second, rapid relief 
for small businesses and their employ-
ees; third, significant steps to stabilize 
our economy and protect jobs; and 
fourth, more support for the brave 
healthcare professionals and the pa-
tients who are fighting the coronavirus 
on the frontlines. 
Now, just yesterday, by an over-
whelming vote, the Senate passed bi-
partisan legislation that originated 
with the Democratic House of Rep-
resentatives. So I hope this bold, new 
proposal will find a similar degree of 
bipartisan respect and mutual urgency 
on the other side of the aisle and across 
the Capitol. 
I look forward to working with our 
Democratic colleagues and the admin-
istration to complete this important 
work and to deliver for our country. 
Here are the next steps. A group of 
my Republican colleagues is standing 
by to explain this legislation and talk 
with the group’s counterparts: Chair-
man CRAPO and Senator TOOMEY from 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs; Chairman ALEX-
ANDER from the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions; Chair-
man GRASSLEY and Senator PORTMAN 
from the Committee on Finance; Chair-
man RUBIO
from the Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
as well as Senator COLLINS; Chairman 
WICKER from the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation; 
and our majority whip, Senator THUNE. 
These will be our point people. 
I invite all of their Democratic coun-
terparts to join us at the table tomor-
row. These are urgent discussions. 
They need to happen at a Member 
level, and they need to happen starting 
right now. 
I might add that all Republican Sen-
ators, whether they are part of this 
group that I just mentioned or not, 
have been asked to stay in town. We 
are here. We are ready to act as soon as 
an agreement with our colleagues 
across the aisle can be reached. The ad-
ministration has agreed to send the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Director 
of the National Economic Council, and 
the White House Director of Legisla-
tive Affairs, and they will participate 
in these discussions, again, beginning 
tomorrow. 
These bipartisan discussions must 
begin immediately and continue with 
urgency at the Member level until we 
have results. We know this legislation 
will not be the last word. Bipartisan, 
bicameral talks are already underway 
to act on the administration’s request, 
in addition to this, for a supplemental 
appropriation, but we need to take bold 
and swift action as soon as possible. 
We need to take further steps to con-
tinue 
addressing 
our 
Nation’s 
healthcare needs, and we need to help 
protect American workers, families, 
and small businesses from this unique 
economic crisis that threatens to wors-
en with every single day. We need to 
have the American people’s backs. This

legislation is a significant next step, 
and the Senate is not going anywhere 
until we take action. Our Republican 
colleagues are here. They are in town. 
They are ready to act. We look forward 
to meeting with our Democratic coun-
terparts tomorrow. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, all 
100 Senators are hearing from our con-
stituents about the urgency of our act-
ing. If we aren’t hearing about the ur-
gency of our acting, we are hearing 
about the questions they have about 
the future economy, as they read about 
businesses 
being 
in 
trouble, 
res-
taurants shutting down, and schools 
closing. All of these decisions that 
have brought doubt to the minds of our 
constituents have been caused by gov-
ernmental action as a result of the 
virus pandemic, the world health pan-
demic, that has been expressed. 
We have to respond to that, and I 
think the leader has said how urgently 
he takes the response that our con-
stituents expect from us and that we 
have a responsibility for taking action. 
This is an urgent time for us. 
As Americans continue to do their 
part to curb the spread of coronavirus 
and the pandemic that it has been 
called, we are doing our part here in 
the Senate to support Americans, and 
that includes their families and their 
jobs. 
Congress passed two bills quickly to 
step up the government’s ability to 
combat the virus and to provide great-
er security for families whose incomes 
have been disrupted by containment ef-
forts. Those two bills—one signed just 
last night by the President—were very 
bipartisan in these efforts. We need to 
continue that bipartisanship. 
We are now working, as the leader 
just introduced, on a bold and com-
prehensive effort to provide additional 
relief to Americans and our economy in 
this challenging time, to respond to 
the anxiety that the American people 
have that I previously said was caused 
by government—and not just the Fed-
eral Government but State govern-
ments maybe in 50 different ways be-
cause of 50 different States and by 
many local governments in different 
ways, as they felt they needed to take 
action. I have already referred to shut-
ting down restaurants, schools closing, 
et cetera. That speaks to how it affects 
the individuals we are trying to help. 
I am chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, as my colleagues know. I have 
been 
working 
with 
my 
colleagues 
around the clock to find opportunities 
in the Tax Code to reduce stress on 
American taxpayers and the businesses 
that create the jobs and the businesses 
that are probably closed now and their 
workers laid off. 
Our small group of colleagues is 
working to help the American tax-
payers and the businesses so that jobs 
continue. We first adopted a do-no- 
harm approach. We want to ensure that 
routine government processes don’t 
add to the strain that everybody has 
out there. We do this by issuing recov-
ery assistance to American families in 
the form of checks that can go out the 
door in short order. These direct pay-
ments could be as much as $1,200 for in-
dividuals, $2,400 for couples, with addi-
tional assistance to families. Obvi-
ously, the purpose of this is to provide 
immediate relief to folks who are fac-
ing cash flow problems in their fami-
lies as they stay home to stop the 
spread of this virus. 
To avoid in-person meetings with tax 
preparers in the midst of the pandemic, 
we are extending the tax filing dead-
line from April 15 to July 15, and of 
course we all know that the adminis-
tration has already deferred collection 
of taxes until July or later. So this will 
help families defer filing costs and 
avoid meetings that could put folks at 
risk at this time of—who knows how 
far the effect of this virus is going to 
be. The deadline for quarterly esti-
mated tax payments will also be post-
poned for 180 days. 
We encourage those able to lend a fi-
nancial hand by providing additional 
deductions for charitable giving. This 
includes suspending the deduction lim-
itation for cash donations by individ-
uals and easing the limitation on dona-
tions of cash and food inventories by 
businesses. Additionally, for those who 
do not itemize, a new deduction will be 
available for everyone who gives, re-
gardless of how you file your taxes. 
American businesses, as we know, are 
the engine of our economy, and we 
stand ready to help them as well. 
American business men and women are 
our job providers, and we need to make 
sure that they can keep their doors 
open—or if those doors are closed 
today, to reopen them—and that the 
payrolls they have going out to those 
individual workers and families across 
the Nation can be maintained. 
Our proposal includes items to im-
prove cash flow and liquidity for busi-
nesses of all sizes. Businesses, includ-
ing the self-employed, will be able to 
defer their quarterly tax estimates 180 
days and their employer Social Secu-
rity tax payments through 2020. 
We are going to increase the limit on 
interest deductibility. We will speed up 
the recovery of the alternative min-
imum tax credits. We will relax limita-
tions on how companies use losses from 
previous years to reduce their tax bur-
dens. 
These are just some of the many pro-
visions in our proposal to unburden 
businesses, 
particularly 
those 
that 
have liquidity problems, so that they 
can keep employing those who are 
home with their families and helping 
to prevent the spread of the virus. 
I hope nobody tries to tell me or the 
rest of us that we are bailing out busi-
ness. We are in the job of preserving 
jobs. If those jobs have been lost in the 
last 10 days because of this slowdown of 
the economy—almost a shutdown of 
the economy—then we want those jobs 
to be brought back. Workers are unem-
ployed because of government’s deci-
sions—not the employer’s decision, not 
the employee’s lack of hard work, but 
because Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments 
have 
stopped 
interaction 
among people so that we don’t spread 
this virus, and it is because of what the 
World Health Organization has labeled 
a world health pandemic. 
We don’t see it as bad now as we do 
in Italy and other countries in Europe. 
We hope we don’t see it as bad as they 
have, but we just don’t know, and be-
cause we don’t know, people have this 
anxiety. They don’t know about the fu-
ture, and we ought to give some help to 
the future. 
I described to you some of the things 
the Finance Committee is working on. 
I have also joined Senator ALEX-
ANDER and others to assist healthcare 
workers and patients. This portion of 
the package includes several Finance 
Committee provisions to help everyone 
fight the pandemic. For example, we 
are adding additional flexibility to the 
health savings accounts, bolstering 
telehealth services, and boosting Medi-
care payments to healthcare providers. 
We can contain this deadly virus 
without destroying livelihoods or the 
Nation’s economy, but right now, our 
constituents have doubt about that, 
and this proposal the leader has put 
forth is to try to quiet some of that 
anxiety. 
These recommendations take bold 
steps to curb the economic fallout as 
we work as a country to contain this 
pandemic. These proposals won’t be the 
end of the congressional response to 
the coronavirus. I think we made clear 
that this is the third effort—two al-
ready signed by the President of the 
United States—and there will probably 
be more. When people want more than 
what is maybe here, there are going to 
be plenty of opportunities for more. 
I wish I could say we know by a cer-
tain date that this anxiety is going to 
go away and we know this pandemic 
has slowed down enough that we can go 
back to work and start interacting 
with our friends and family to the 
same extent we always have and open 
up the restaurants. 
I stand ready to continue identifying 
targeted relief as necessary to help 
bridge the gap beyond this bill, but we 
need to take this next step and do it 
quickly. 
I want to thank Leader MCCONNELL 
for convening our task forces to quick-
ly provide meaningful relief to fami-
lies, individuals, and all sectors of the 
economy. 
The people I have been working with 
that I thank are Senators JOHN THUNE, 
ROB PORTMAN, PAT TOOMEY, TIM SCOTT, 
TOM
COTTON, and MITT
ROMNEY
for 
working with me on this package. 
Some of those Members are hard-work-
ing Members of the Finance Com-
mittee, and some aren’t on the com-
mittee because we wanted as broad an 
opinion as we could get. I know our 
staffs work literally around the clock, 
so I want to recognize their efforts as 
well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1830 
March 19, 2020 
So many Americans are working day 
and night to provide essential services 
and efforts to combat this outbreak. 
We in Congress must be prepared to do 
the same, and that is why you heard 
the leader a little while ago saying 
that we are going to stay in until we 
get this job done. We ought to applaud 
that type of leadership. 
It is a commitment to keep the Sen-
ate open until we have done our part, 
and I look forward to working with 
Democrats and the administration to 
get this job done without delay. So 
maybe, if we work hard Friday, Satur-
day, and Sunday, we can get a bill to 
the 
President 
next 
week. 
Nobody 
should be going home until we have de-
livered this needed relief. 
We often spoke in World War II about 
the United States being the arsenal of 
democracy. I still remember—I was 
only 9 years old—December 7, 1941. And 
then I remember studying history and 
how we ramped up production for the 
war effort. Can we ramp up production 
of the respirators, protective gear, and 
testing kits we need? Can we do it on 
the same scale we did in World War II— 
a scale that can help us overcome this 
crisis? 
I suppose you all remember the cry of 
‘‘Remember Pearl Harbor’’ to help us 
pull the country together to win that 
war. Can we think of ‘‘Remember 
coronavirus’’ as an effort to pull this 
country together? Because in those 
times, I remember we all pulled to-
gether to—let’s say, just one example— 
we all prided ourselves in planning 
what we called victory gardens. We did 
it in unison, as we sought to defeat the 
Axis powers. Can we pull together in 
the same way to slow the spread of 
COVID–19 until our healthcare system 
catches up with something we never 
anticipated, never could plan for? 
I think this is a test of America’s 
character, just like it was a test of our 
character in World War II to pull to-
gether. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. 
President. I am glad now that the Re-
publican leader and his caucus now 
have a plan, and we look forward to 
working with them to come up with a 
bipartisan product as soon as we can, 
as this crisis grows worse every day. 
We believe we need a bold plan, a 
strong plan. Our plan must put work-
ers—the millions of workers who are 
adversely affected by this crisis—first. 
It includes service and industry work-
ers, 
gig 
workers, 
freelancers, 
bar-
tenders, retail workers, airline attend-
ants, and so many others. 
Our 
plan 
is 
entitled 
‘‘Workers 
First’’—first and foremost. We owe so 
much gratitude to the hard-working 
people of America, and many of them 
are in trouble now through no fault of 
their own. This virus has affected some 
of them, has required others to be 
quarantined, and has caused businesses 
to lay off millions. We must protect 
them, first and foremost. 
So our plan has five basic pillars. Pil-
lar 1 is to bolster the healthcare sys-
tem dramatically. If we don’t beat the 
fight against this virus, if we don’t do 
it as quickly as possible, the economy 
will get worse and worse, no matter 
what we do. So we must work ex-
tremely quickly and massively to bol-
ster our healthcare system. We need a 
Marshall Plan for our healthcare sys-
tem, and that is what we propose. 
We need direct aid to hospitals. The 
larger hospitals in many cities already 
have patients—many patients—in their 
beds. The smaller and rural hospitals 
could well be in danger of closing be-
cause of this crisis. We must bolster 
the hospitals. They need equipment. 
They need ventilators. They need more 
ICU beds. They need masks. A simple 
thing like a nose swab—a hospital told 
me that they can’t do testing because 
they don’t have the nasal swabs. And 
we need the President to marshal the 
Defense Production Act to get all of 
these materials produced on a wartime 
footing—quickly, dramatically, and in 
large numbers. 
The first plank of our plan dramati-
cally bolsters our healthcare system, 
which is being overwhelmed through no 
fault of the hard-working people there 
in this crisis, and it entails so much. 
Healthcare workers have to be able to 
get to the hospitals, to the nursing 
homes, to the other areas. In many 
places, they can’t if there isn’t the 
kind of public transit available or it is 
not working. 
The second part of our plan deals di-
rectly with those who have lost income 
through no fault of their own. It is a 
dramatic bolstering of unemployment 
insurance. We call it ‘‘unemployment 
insurance on steroids,’’ or you might 
even call it ‘‘employment insurance.’’ 
If a worker loses his or her job 
through no fault of their own right 
now, unemployment insurance doesn’t 
cover a whole lot of people. When it 
does, it doesn’t pay them much in 
terms of salary, in terms of the per-
centage of income, and it is often hard 
to get and takes a long time. Our ‘‘un-
employment on steroids’’—our employ-
ment 
insurance—provides 
a 
full 
amount of the wages that workers are 
not being paid, not 20 percent or 50 per-
cent. People desperately need it. They 
desperately need it. 
It is quick and easy to apply for, 
without all of these hurdles that are 
now put in the way, and it applies to 
many more workers than in the past. 
We have talked to business owners— 
large, medium, and small. For many of 
them this is the No. 1 thing they need. 
While they can’t keep their workers on 
the payroll because no money is com-
ing in, these workers will still be there. 
They will be furloughed. They will be 
getting a full salary, and when the 
businesses come back, they will be 
back. 
The third part of our plan is for paid 
leave. We must have paid family leave. 
We must have paid sick leave. COVID 2 
did some of that, but too many people 
are not covered and too many people 
are not covered in a strong, longer 
term way. Senators MURRAY and GILLI-
BRAND, working with the House, have 
put together a very strong package. We 
must have it in this proposal. 
Fourth, I believe—no one has seen 
the proposal. I haven’t seen it, and I 
don’t think anyone has seen the pro-
posal that the leader put on. It had vir-
tually no input from Democrats, but 
we will look at it and read it tonight. 
From what I am told, it provides a 
bailout for a number of industries. 
Again, we have to put the workers 
first. We don’t want these industries to 
go under, but we certainly don’t want 
the dollars that are put there to go to 
corporate executives or shareholders. 
Again, they must go to the workers 
first. If they are getting a bailout, they 
should not cut the numbers of workers, 
the salaries of workers, the benefits of 
workers, or the pensions of workers. 
None of this money should be used 
for corporate buybacks. I am outraged 
that the airline industry in the last 5 
years 
spent 
about 
$40 
billion 
on 
buybacks. They are now saying they 
don’t have enough money. Had they 
not sent the money to the shareholders 
and had it there or used it to bolster 
their workforces, that might not have 
happened. Nor should the money go to 
corporate salaries or corporate gain. 
Part four of our plan says no bailout 
that goes to the people at the top. The 
money should go to the workers. After 
all, that is who we want to protect. 
Every one of us knows the workers in 
these industries. They are hard-work-
ing, decent, honorable people. 
Fifth is help for small business. 
Small business has suffered—the little 
restaurant, maybe it is the small man-
ufacturing business, or maybe it is a 
little service business. They need help. 
Their employees, should they have to 
furlough them, will be taken care of by 
our employment insurance, but they 
still have other costs. We have called 
for forbearance in mortgages. That is a 
big cost that they will continue to 
maintain if they rent space. But they 
will need help with other costs, and we 
provide them money for those costs, 
with the view that the money—those 
loans—could be forgiven if they rehire 
all of their workers once they are back 
on their feet. 
So there are five points, and I know 
that the Speaker of the House agrees 
with these points, the House Demo-
crats agree with these points, and, un-
fortunately, the leader didn’t want 
them included in negotiations, which 
could only prolong the length of time 
before we act. But so be it. 
No. 1, a Marshall Plan for our 
healthcare system and our hospitals. 
No. 2, employment insurance—you lose 
your job, you get your pay. No. 3, paid 
leave—paid family leave, paid sick 
leave. No. 4, any bailouts must be 
workers first. And, No. 5, help for small 
businesses. 
We need to act quickly. We need to 
act in a bipartisan way. I hope the dis-
cussions between the various members

of the committees will proceed quickly 
and in a spirit of compromise, and I 
hope we can come to quick agreement 
with the House, whose majority’s views 
are much closer to ours than this docu-
ment, which I haven’t read, but I have 
heard things about. I haven’t seen it. 
This is a crisis like none we have 
seen. We don’t know how long it will 
last. We don’t know how many people 
will be affected. We do know it is get-
ting worse every day, and we know also 
that, while Americans usually come to-
gether after a crisis—we all certainly 
do, as we did after 9/11—we now must 
be isolated. But we will prevail. We 
will prevail. We will work together. 
Hopefully, each side will give. We will 
come up with a good plan. We will send 
it to the President, and we will help to 
begin the long path to eradicate this 
awful virus that has so afflicted so 
many millions of Americans, one way 
or another. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I agree 
with so much of what the distinguished 
Democratic leader has just said. I was 
coming from one building to the other 
when the distinguished Senator from 
Iowa was speaking, but I know he was 
making the point that I would make at 
this time, too. 
If the distinguished Democratic lead-
er wants to call this a Marshall Plan 
for the coronavirus crisis, I will sub-
scribe to it. I think it is that serious. 
I agree with what the Democratic 
leader said about this economic crisis. 
It is something like we have never seen 
before, and it calls for dramatic action. 
I think that is what the majority lead-
er, Senator MCCONNELL, has proposed. 
I agree with this from my friend from 
New York—that when we try to rescue 
the large corporations, we need to put 
workers first and not be concerned 
about the CEOs and the executives. We 
need to take care of small business. 
So let’s do a Marshall Plan, and let’s 
do it on a bipartisan basis, as Ameri-
cans, because this economic crisis 
knows no party. 
You know, in some instances, when 
there is a crisis we are told to carry on, 
and, in this case, that really isn’t what 
the healthcare professionals have told 
Americans to do. Americans have been 
told and people around the world have 
been told: Stay at home; don’t con-
gregate. 
That is the way our economy oper-
ates. 
So Americans are doing what they 
have been asked to do. We are not fly-
ing. We are not staying in hotels. Occu-
pancy is down to single digits. Res-
taurants are closed. Stores are closed. 
Americans are keeping their children 
home from school. Schools are not 
opening in most areas. Again, the 
American people are acting respon-
sibly, according to what they have 
been told to do by health professionals. 
The public is taking guidance, and this 
is having an enormous toll on our econ-
omy. 
We hope the virus will end soon, but 
we need a rescue package. I am happy 
to join the distinguished Democratic 
leader in calling it a Marshall Plan, he 
would like to. 
The American people bear no respon-
sibility for this act of nature—this act 
of God—that has overtaken much of 
the globe. 
So I have come here today just to say 
that I have been honored to participate 
in the drafting of what Senator MCCON-
NELL, the distinguished majority lead-
er, 
has 
rolled 
out 
today—the 
Coronavirus 
Economic 
Stabilization 
Act. 
I was part of a task force that the 
distinguished majority leader asked us 
to work on. That task force dealt with 
the airline industry. It consisted of 
Chairman SHELBY and Majority Whip 
THUNE. We were happy to develop a 
plan that involves $208 billion, giving 
the Secretary of the Treasury the abil-
ity to provide loans and loan guaran-
tees to eligible businesses that are en-
during financial hardship, including 
the domestic airlines, including the do-
mestic cargo carriers, if they can make 
the case that there is a hardship there. 
During this time of unprecedented 
economic uncertainty, it is critical 
that the airlines and other impacted 
industries have the resources they need 
to continue operations vital to the 
transportation of passengers and sup-
plies, including food and medical equip-
ment. The plan that I participated in 
drafting, which the distinguished ma-
jority leader put forward today, would 
prohibit the Federal funds from being 
used to increase compensation or pro-
vide golden parachutes or that sort of 
thing for the leaders of these distressed 
companies. 
So, again, I subscribe to what Sen-
ator SCHUMER said: Protect the work-
ers. This is no bailout. These are loans 
that we expect to be paid back when 
times are flush again. 
This legislation would take an impor-
tant step in putting our economy back 
on track for the American people. A 
great deal of work has gone into the 
draft, and much work is going to be re-
quired in the future—tonight, tomor-
row, tomorrow night, Saturday, and 
Sunday. We are in the midst of severe 
economic crisis, and I am determined 
to work, on a bipartisan basis, with 
people like my friend who just spoke, 
and with Senator CANTWELL of Wash-
ington, 
my 
distinguished 
ranking 
member. We have penciled in 10 a.m. 
tomorrow morning. I have already been 
on the phone with her, and we are 
going to be dealing with the legislation 
under the jurisdiction of our com-
mittee, the Commerce Committee, and 
I think we are going to be able to work 
as we have on so many other issues—as 
Americans, not as Republicans and 
Democrats—as teammates rising to the 
occasion and answering this crisis as 
Americans have done so many times in 
the past. 
So I simply rise today to say: This is 
a time for us to come together as patri-
ots, as Americans, and take on the 
task that is before us. I look forward to 
a hard weekend of work and a product 
that all Americans can be proud of. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, we, in this 
profession, have a tendency to hyper-
bole, meaning a tendency to stand 
sometimes and talk about how dra-
matic a decision we are about to make 
is or how important something is to 
the country because that is what we 
do, and it is sort of one of the tools of 
this trade. 
I think this is not a time in which it 
is possible to exaggerate the impact of 
what we are confronting. I start by 
saying I think it is a moment that 
should instill in all of us extraordinary 
humility and a reminder that we are 
still mortal beings who cannot and do 
not control all that happens in our 
lives or in the world. 
We are facing a threat that emerges 
not from a human decision or behavior 
but a threat that emerges from the sci-
entific world, the biological world, and 
one that I think we are blessed to live 
in a modern time, in which technology 
allows us to solve problems faster, but 
oftentimes our advances cannot pre-
vent these things. 
I think of the time when there will be 
plenty to look back at—the decisions 
that were made by governments, by 
foreign governments, and by officials. 
Like all things, there will come a mo-
ment of accounting when we can decide 
what was done wrong and what was 
done right so we can learn from what 
was done wrong and replicate what was 
done right. We can learn from the past, 
but we cannot change it. 
The one thing we can influence is the 
future. You can’t entirely control it, 
but we can influence it. We can influ-
ence what we do from this moment for-
ward. And when it comes to this pan-
demic, we can influence not that it is 
here but how long it lasts and how 
impactful it will be. 
One of the real-world impacts of the 
crisis that now confronts us is the im-
pact it is having on jobs. We use that 
term loosely in politics all the time: 
‘‘Jobs.’’ We want to create jobs. We 
value jobs. It is about having more 
jobs. I think sometimes we overlook 
the strong, emotional, and psycho-
logical impact of jobs, of the fact that 
someone wakes up in the morning and 
has somewhere to go, where they are 
productive, and they are rewarded fair-
ly for their productivity. It gives pur-
pose to your days. It gives meaning. It 
gives value. It is why the absence of 
jobs is so toxic and damaging not just 
to the spirit but ultimately to the com-
munity and then to the country. It is a

S1832 
March 19, 2020 
situation we have learned in ordinary 
times, and these are not ordinary 
times. 
We are watching a pace of job loss at 
this very moment that is unprece-
dented, even in some of the deepest 
economic downturns that modern man 
has ever confronted. There is not a sin-
gle person who serves in the Senate, 
works in this building, or, I would 
argue, in our entire society who does 
not know someone who in the last 4 or 
5 days has been told that they no 
longer have a job. Think about that for 
a moment. People who 10 days ago had 
a job in an economy that by all tradi-
tional standards was doing very well 
and now have been told that they do 
not have a job. The people they used to 
work for may no longer exist, and 
there is no certainty about outcomes 
even when this ends. It is impossible to 
exaggerate that. 
What we are learning through this 
crisis is what we all have said we know 
but are now realizing how much it is 
true, and that is, how many of the jobs 
in this country are the result of a 
small business and not of the compa-
nies whose stories are featured in a 
magazine or a newspaper article. It is 
the ones we drive by every single day— 
the laundromat, the dry cleaners, the 
coin cleaners, the bakeries, the coffee 
shops, and everything in between—hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs in every 
community that depend on their very 
existence, and they are disappearing 
right before our eyes. It is not because 
they did anything wrong but because 
government has had to tell them, for 
the reasons of public health that I 
agree with, not only that we cannot go 
there but that their workers can’t go 
there, and in many jurisdictions, they 
cannot even show up. So the urgency to 
address this, I believe, needs no con-
vincing. 
We have, as a starting point, devel-
oped a plan that I think will help, that 
will do what we can, and I want to 
briefly describe it. The plan is basi-
cally this: We need to get money into 
the hands of small business across this 
country as quickly as possible so they 
can keep the workers they have on 
payroll for as long as possible. We aim 
for at least 4, 5, or 6 weeks. This is im-
portant because if you have already 
been told you can’t leave your home, 
and you have already been told you 
can’t go anywhere, and then to also be 
told: And by the way, you have no job, 
and there is no guarantee that there is 
a job for you to go back to when this 
all ends, the trauma is extraordinary. 
That is what millions of people are fac-
ing by the second. 
These are not job losses that are hap-
pening by the week or by the month; 
they are by the second. Right now, 
somewhere in America, someone is 
being told: We are closing, and you 
have no job. And tomorrow will be the 
last time you will get a paycheck for 
the foreseeable future. 
So our plan, ideally, would involve 
the following: Small businesses will be 
able to go to a bank in their commu-
nity. Ideally, in a perfect world, it 
would be the bank they normally use, 
the bank they bank with. Then they 
will very quickly—and I am not talk-
ing about in a matter of weeks; I am 
talking about in a matter of hours and 
days—receive 
an 
infusion 
of 
cash, 
equivalent to about roughly four times 
their monthly expenses on payroll and 
on rent and things of that nature. And 
then a year from now, those businesses, 
if they can show that they used that 
money to keep everyone on staff and 
hired that was working for them before 
this all started and paid them what 
they were paying them, that money 
will be forgiven. It will not be a loan. 
The important point to make about 
this is—I am not talking about an SBA 
loan. I am not talking about going to a 
government building somewhere or a 
tent in a disaster zone and filling out a 
bunch of paperwork. I am talking 
about going to a financial institution, 
preferably the one that you normally 
use, filling out a few quick documents 
to prove that you are a business, and 
receiving a cash infusion directly into 
your account that you can use to meet 
payroll for the next 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks, 
and we have a plan that does it. 
Now, on this matter, we are blessed 
to have partners in this endeavor like 
Senator CARDIN
and others on the 
Small Business Committee who are not 
only some of the hardest working and 
easiest people to work with on these 
matters, but whom we have been work-
ing with on these matters, along with 
our House counterparts, for a couple of 
weeks. Except for a couple of weeks 
ago, we could never have envisioned 
how widespread and how serious this 
dilemma would become. 
We don’t have an agreement at this 
very moment, but I do believe that on 
the general concepts—I speak for no 
one but myself, but it is my impression 
that on the general outlines of what we 
are trying to achieve, there is substan-
tial agreement. 
So we have some work to do. I will be 
in the Senate and here in Washington, 
DC, around the clock until we get this 
done because, as I said at the outset, 
millions upon millions of families and 
their immediate and long-term futures 
are being determined by what we do or 
fail to do. Rarely, if ever, do we truly 
confront issues in the Senate of that 
importance. 
I will close with this: It is hard to re-
move politics from politics. It is hard 
to ask politicians not to be political. It 
is tempting to use even situations such 
as these for the snide remark and the 
potshot, and I imagine you can never 
fully remove it. I would only say this: 
If we don’t address these issues that 
are before us and do so rapidly, those 
potshots will appear trivial in compari-
son. If we don’t address the challenges 
that are before this country now, no 
one can tell you what the future looks 
like because no one alive today has 
ever been there, ever. 
Anyone who believes that what I am 
saying is an exaggeration, what was 
life like in America a week ago today? 
What does it look like now? If this pace 
continues, what will it look like 5 days 
from now or 10 days from now? We 
don’t know, but it will be traumatic 
and potentially catastrophic, so we 
must act. We will have plenty of other 
issues and plenty of days and weeks 
and months ahead to bicker about the 
political issue of the day and to take 
shots at our opponents. 
Now is no time for games. We are fac-
ing the abyss. We are facing cir-
cumstances for which there is no play-
book, for which there is no precedent, 
and for which there is no way to pre-
dict what happens to a society when 
you tell millions of people they can’t 
work, they cannot leave their homes, 
and we cannot tell you how you will 
make a living now or for the imme-
diate future. 
This is no time for games. This is a 
time for those of us who are here to be 
here and to work through this as 
quickly as possible, or we will all pay 
the price, and we will all face those 
consequences. They are so grave, so un-
speakable, and so unimaginable that I 
cannot believe that we will not be able 
to do so and act quickly, swiftly, and 
effectively. I look forward to making 
strong progress. 
Our people need some hope. Our peo-
ple need to believe that their institu-
tions in a moment of crisis can still 
work. We have a chance to do our part 
to instill at least that little bit of con-
fidence at a time of extraordinary un-
certainty. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, be-
fore he leaves the floor, I want to par-
ticularly thank the senior Senator 
from Florida for the extraordinary con-
tribution he is making as we move to-
ward completion of this rescue pack-
age.

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT

there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it stand adjourned under the 
previous order, following the remarks 
of Senator BRAUN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, first of 
all, I would like to thank you for spar-
ing me not having to be in the seat in-
definitely, and I promise I will keep 
this short. 
What a day we have come through. 
Senator CRAMER and I have been here a 
little bit over a year, and I can’t imag-
ine in a little over a year being more 
filled with making this responsibility 
as a U.S. Senator worth every effort it 
took to get here. It finds us in an inter-
esting place. 
I am from Main Street America. I 
spent 37 years building my own com-
pany, a company that three of my four 
kids—along with a great, young execu-
tive team—run now, and here we are. 
We are confronted with coronavirus. 
Now, in a sequence of H1N1, SARS, 
MERS, even a threat from Ebola, this 
looks like it is the one that we have 
heard about for a long time that could 
really test the mettle of our country 
while we are going through it. 
We have listened to the experts, and 
I think that idea of hitting this as hard 
as we can makes sense. You hear about 
flattening the curve. Yes, we need to do 
that. In the process, everything we are 
doing has now been thrown in front of 
probably the strongest economy that 
you could ever imagine. Look how frail 
it can be when something comes along 
that you don’t understand and that you 
fear. 
Over the next 2 to 3 days, we are 
going to be wrestling with something 
that probably is going to be as tough as 
anything we have confronted as a coun-
try. I thought, at first, well, we would 
get through this, especially if it wasn’t 
going to be a real tough thing to get 
rid of. That is not the case. This is 
going to take everything we have. 
What we are doing this weekend ought 
to be based upon the commonality that 
all of us believe we should take care of 
the hard-working individuals who have 
been displaced by this and small busi-
nesses. We have that nucleus to start 
from. 
Of course, it begs the question: What 
do you do about other parts of the 
economy? Well, my feeling is what we 
do tomorrow is not going to be the last 
thing we do to make sure we take this 
on with a full head of steam. 
I am getting input from middle 
America, from my home State, from 
people whom I really trust their judg-
ment. They are saying, yes, we want to 
make sure we do everything and throw 
the kitchen sink at it. We want to 
make sure that we protect the most 
vulnerable—the people who have a pre-
existing condition, mostly elderly—im-
pacted in the State of Washington and 
other places. 
I am increasingly asked the question: 
Do we want to keep plowing forward, 
regardless of what the results are? If 
the economy is starting to show what 
it is showing, which has so much fear 
and anxiety built into it, how long can 
we put up with it? What we are going 
to do this weekend is the first major ef-
fort at restoring confidence in the 
economy. 
I am sure we will come back again 
soon because, like I said earlier, it is 
not the end of it. At some point, we 
need to carefully measure the progress 
we are making against the cause of it 
in the first place and make sure that 
that is working the way we intended it 
to work, which is to make sure that we 
take care of the most vulnerable and 
protect them from the ravages of the 
coronavirus. 
So 10 days, 2 weeks down the road, I 
think we are going to be at a pivotal 
point. We are going to see if the early 
effort has worked. We all pray that it 
does. We are going to see what our ef-
forts are going to yield and generate 
here this weekend, and then I want to 
make sure that, at that pivot point, 
when we need to look at this again, do 
we keep doing what we are doing, or do 
we do what seems to make sense, 
maybe make some adjustments, maybe 
focus on a different approach that does 
not systematically take the patient 
down: a healthy economy. I think we 
all want to accomplish the same thing. 
We are going to start this weekend. 
Please, both sides of the aisle, don’t 
quibble and don’t bicker about some of 
the details because this is urgent. The 
American public expects us to do some-
thing. Then, here in another 10 days to 
2 weeks, we need to look at it again 
and make sure we make the right deci-
sions that really are in the long-term 
interest 
of 
tamping 
down 
the 
coronavirus and not killing a very 
healthy 
patient—our 
economy—that 
now looks like it is hurting. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
1790 
AR-
RIVAL 
OF 
THE 
FIRST 
CAR-
MELITE SISTERS IN THE STATE 
OF MARYLAND 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 19, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the Discalced 
Carmelite Nuns of the Carmel of Port To-
bacco, Maryland, will mark the 230th anniver-
sary this year of their establishment as the 
first women’s religious order in our state. Es-
tablished in 1790, the same year that Mary-
land and the other thirteen states were in the 
process of ratifying the First Amendment guar-
anteeing freedom of worship, the Carmelite 
nuns were Americans who had left for Europe 
years earlier in search of the Catholic religious 
life. With their return, they began a tradition of 
religious orders for women and men of many 
faiths to build and grow in Maryland and in 
America. 
Founded originally as a haven for those fac-
ing religious persecution in Europe, the colony 
of Maryland welcomed many Catholics to its 
shores from its origins in 1634. In the years 
before the American Revolution, Catholics in 
Maryland and elsewhere faced persecution for 
practicing their faith. An absence of any local 
Catholic religious orders for women led a 
number of American women to travel to Eu-
rope to join orders there. Among them were 
Mother Bernardina Matthews and her nieces 
Sister Mary Aloysia Matthews and Sister Mary 
Eleanora Matthews, who had left Maryland in 
their youth. Together with Mother Clare Jo-
seph Dickenson of England, they set off from 
their convent in Hoogstraten, Belgium, on April 
19, 1790, and reached New York on July 2 
after an arduous sea journey. On the evening 
of July 10, they arrived in Port Tobacco, which 
was then the seat of Charles County, Mary-
land. 
From 1790 to 1831, the Discalced Carmelite 
Nuns of the Carmel of Port Tobacco grew 
from these original four to twenty sisters. 
Guided by their spiritual director, Father 
Charles Neale, they followed the rule estab-
lished by Saint Teresa of Avila in the sixteenth 
century, living a life of poverty and prayer, fo-
cusing on contemplation, meditation, and char-
itable works. After Father Neale’s death in 
1823, the convent fell on hard times, and the 
sisters resettled in Baltimore in 1831, where 
they served the population of the growing city. 
Although the Discalced Carmelites eventu-
ally spawned chapters across the northeastern 
United States, only one chapter remains active 
today, serving Maryland. In 1933, a group of 
supporters founded ‘The Restorers of Mount 
Carmel’ to purchase the site of the original 
convent, which was preserved as a historic 
site. In 1976, a group of American Catholic 
missionary women from Great Mills, Maryland, 
were granted permission to move to the site 
and re-establish a religious community there. 
They left in 1982 but were quickly followed by 
the return of Carmelite nuns from elsewhere in 
the country determined to carry on the order 
established in 1790. Since that re-establish-
ment, there have been as many as fifteen 
Carmelite nuns living at the convent, carrying 
on the traditions of their forebears and adding 
to the religious diversity of our state and our 
nation. 
I am proud to represent a state that was 
founded to promote religious tolerance and be 
a welcoming haven to all seeking freedom to 
worship and pursue a better life. Maryland has 
been enriched by its many religious commu-
nities, including the Discalced Carmelite Nuns 
of the Carmel of Port Tobacco, who were pio-
neers at the start of America’s independence. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in congratu-
lating the order on celebrating its 230th year.
