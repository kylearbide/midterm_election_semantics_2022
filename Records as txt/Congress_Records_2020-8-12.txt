PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our refuge and strength, give 
us reverence for Your greatness. Guide 
our Senators around the pitfalls of 
their work, enabling them to have 
hearts sustained by Your peace. May 
they surrender their will to You as 
they trust You to guide their lives. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to re-
ceive Your reproof, with the under-
standing that You chastise those whom 
You love for their good. Make their 
lives productive for the glory of Your 
Name. 
Mighty God, protect the oppressed

evil. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I spoke about the disconnect 
between the discourse here in Wash-
ington and the pain and uncertainty 
that American families are feeling all 
across our country. 
I spoke about the human toll of the 
Democrats’ choice to play politics with 
billions and billions of aid and block it 
all over non-COVID-related wish list 
items. 
It has been clear for some weeks that 
the Speaker of the House and the Sen-
ate Democratic leader are treating this 
crisis like an ordinary political game. 
The New York Times says Speaker 
PELOSI is ‘‘playing hardball.’’ POLIT-
ICO says she is ‘‘taking a huge risk . . . 
as 
she 
remains 
almost 
entirely 
unyielding in her demands.’’ 
More than 160,000 Americans have 
been killed by the worst infectious dis-
ease outbreak in more than a century. 
More than 16 million Americans are 
out of work. An entire school year for 
our kids is in limbo, but Democrats are 
playing political games like this were 
some run-of-the-mill typical negotia-
tion. 
Speaker PELOSI’s own Democratic 
House 
Members 
call 
her 
proposal 
‘‘Washington 
gamesmanship,’’ 
‘‘par-
tisan gamesmanship,’’ and ‘‘playing 
politics.’’ Those are House Democrats I 
am quoting on the House Democratic 
bill. 
Yesterday, literally a few minutes 
after I said on the floor that Democrats 
should stop treating this crisis like a 
game, the Democratic leader came to 
the floor to talk about who ‘‘ran down 
the clock,’’ who ‘‘tossed up an air 
ball,’’ and who ‘‘subbed themselves out 
of the game.’’ 
So, look, the Democrats aren’t tak-
ing this as a serious issue. They aren’t 
acting like this is serious, and the 
American people are hurting in the 
meantime. 
Let’s get outside the beltway and lis-
ten to how this crisis has impacted real 
American families and how the Demo-
crats’ stonewalling continues to hurt 
them. 
Since we passed the CARES Act, I 
have been visiting healthcare facilities 
in my home State of Kentucky—places 
like St. Claire’s Healthcare in More-
head and King’s Daughters Medical

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5392 
August 12, 2020 
Center in Ashland—always wearing a 
mask and social distancing, of course. 
I have thanked the frontline workers 
and heard how the Senate’s last rescue 
package has helped them save lives and 
stay safer themselves while doing it. 
That is because the CARES Act pro-
vided 
$1.3 
billion 
for 
Kentucky 
healthcare providers alone, on top of 
more than $120 million we had already 
sent for testing. 
But Kentucky’s incredible nurses, 
doctors, and hospitals are not finished 
fighting the battle on behalf of their 
communities, and Congress must not 
be finished helping them do it. That is 
why 
Senate 
Republicans 
proposed 
major new investments in health pro-
viders. 
We want to send tens of billions more 
to 
expand 
testing, 
to 
reimburse 
healthcare facilities for unplanned pan-
demic expenses, to speed the develop-
ment and rapid distribution of COVID– 
19 treatments, and to find a vaccine to 
finish this fight once and for all. 
That is what Republicans would like 
to do, but Democrats have about 
blocked all of it over non-COVID-re-
lated, liberal demands. 
Let’s talk about the PPP—the his-
toric program from Chairman COLLINS 
and Chairman RUBIO
that has kept 
Main Street alive and kept millions of 
Americans from losing their jobs. 
This 
program 
has 
been 
trans-
formational for Kentucky. Our small 
businesses and their workers have re-
ceived more than $5 billion of payroll 
support. As the director of the Dare to 
Care Food Bank in Louisville told me 
recently, PPP funding is what has al-
lowed his facility to keep its entire 
workforce—precisely when our commu-
nity needs were the greatest. 
And I heard from the director of a 
Kentucky museum that ‘‘[t]he PPP 
program was the one hope that we had 
to keep our business alive.’’ 
But these small businesses and non-
profits are now nearing the end of that 
help. The PPP had to close its doors 
last Saturday for new applications, and 
many employers are exhausting the 
money they had already received. Our 
country is approaching another small 
business tipping point, and workers 
could begin getting pink slips instead 
of paychecks. 
That is why Senate Republicans 
wrote up plans for another whole round 
of PPP—a full second draw for the 
hardest hit businesses. House Demo-
crats left this out of their bill entirely 
and essentially turned their backs on 
those benefiting from PPP. But Repub-
licans want to keep helping Main 
Street workers. 
One woman-owned small business in 
Northern Kentucky shared: 
We are grateful for the $465,000 in the PPP. 
[But] we have used all of it for payroll and 
employee related costs . . . 18 weeks of ex-
penses. We are seeking [more] financial help 
to keep our most treasured asset, our people, 
employed. 
And the president of an inspection 
company in Louisville says this: 
You have no idea how much this second 
draw on PPP will help us. We were actually 
in the process of figuring out how we were 
going to make it through to our fall work 
season. . . . If we get this, we could make it 
into our season with no layoffs. 
Republicans want to get more aid to 
these workers, but Senate Democrats 
have blocked every bit of it over non- 
COVID-related liberal demands. 
Let’s talk about our university presi-
dents who are worried about testing 
and funding in the fall. Our K–12 school 
boards and superintendents want legal 
protections so they can reopen. 
So Republicans proposed billions for 
education—actually, even more than 
House Democrats in their bill. But now 
Democrats are blocking it all over un-
related, liberal demands. 
Republicans want another round of 
direct checks—direct checks to house-
holds 
across 
Kentucky 
and 
across 
America. 
I just heard from one constituent 
who said: 
With my first one, I was able to get an eye 
exam and new glasses. . . . I appreciate all 
you can do. Some of us are hurting and need 
help. 
I want to put more cash in her pock-
et right now, but Democrats are block-
ing every penny over unrelated, liberal 
demands. 
So do you see the pattern? Kentuck-
ians need more help; Americans need 
more help. The American people are 
not done fighting this virus, and Re-
publicans are not done crafting policies 
to help them. But the difference be-
tween now and March is that Demo-
crats seem to be finished being reason-
able. 
The Speaker of the House and the 
Senate Democratic leader have cut all 
their colleagues—all of them, all of 
their committees—out of negotiations. 
They are doing this alone, and they 
have declared that none of the prior-
ities I have named will see a single 
dime unless—the two of them have de-
clared none of the priorities I have 
named will see a single dime unless 
millionaires in Brooklyn and San Fran-
cisco get a massive tax cut, States get 
a trillion-dollar slush fund to cover 
budget problems long before the pan-
demic, and we tax essential workers to 
pay unemployed people a higher salary 
to stay home. 
Republicans wanted to reach agree-
ment on all these issues where we 
could find common ground and fight 
over the last few issues later. But the 
Speaker and the Democratic leader say 
nothing can move unless every one of 
these unrelated, far-left items tags 
along. 
These two individuals are letting the 
wish lists of wealthy coastal elites 
stand between every working family in 
America and the additional help they 
deserve. 
So maybe in a few moments the 
Democratic leader or somebody on the 
other side will try again to explain how 
this is all some big political game. 
Well, Kentuckians know differently. 
They need results. All of our States 
need results. And Republicans will 
fight until we actually get an outcome.

f 
VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
speak 
about 
the 
latest 
coronavirus emergency aid package, 
but before I do, as a matter of personal 
privilege, I want to offer some com-
ments in praise of a colleague. 
Just as we gather together, regard-
less of party, to mourn when a col-
league dies or be together with a col-
league who is undergoing a challenge, I 
think it is good to gather together and 
acknowledge when something positive 
happens to a colleague, regardless of 
our political affiliation. 
This is the first opportunity on the 
Senate floor to offer a word about Sen-
ator KAMALA HARRIS, one of our col-
leagues, who, in a historic move, was 
asked by another former Senate col-
league, Vice President Joe Biden, to 
join him as his preferred nominee to be 
Vice President of the United States. 
I have come to know Senator HARRIS 
in her 4 years in the Senate, as many of 
us have, through her service on espe-
cially the Judiciary Committee and 
the Intelligence Committee. 
Her public service track record is a 
significant one worthy of praise, from 
her work as a district attorney, first a 
line prosecutor, and then the elected 
district attorney in San Francisco, 
where she focused on trying to keep 
her community safe, to serving as Cali-
fornia’s attorney general, broadening 
the portfolio to include environmental 
justice and consumer protection, and 
now her work in the Senate since 2016. 
What I find so compelling about Sen-
ator HARRIS, in addition to her track 
record of public service during a very 
long career, is her personal story. 
Raised as the child of two immigrants, 
a Jamaican father and an Indian moth-
er, as so many in this country raised as 
children of immigrants, she developed 
a passion to serve and a patriotic love 
of country. 
She is the first African-American 
woman nominee ever to be on a ticket. 
She is the first person of South Asian 
descent ever to be on a ticket. And in 
the year 2020, when we are commemo-
rating the 100th anniversary of the 
amendment that guaranteed women 
the right to vote, I can think of no

greater way to celebrate a centennial 
than for one of our colleagues who is a 
woman to have a chance to break a 
glass ceiling that still has existed, 
whereby no woman in this country has 
ever been a Vice President or Presi-
dent. 
We are so good at so much in this 
country. In fact, we are so good at 
many things with regard to women in 
this country, but we are sort of unique-
ly bad in electing women to higher of-
fice. In Congress right now, 24 percent 
of Congress is women, and that ranks 
us 76th in the world in terms of our 
percentage of women in a national leg-
islative body. We are tied with Afghan-
istan, but we trail Iraq and Mexico and 
many other nations. 
So regardless of how it all works out 
between now and November, and re-
gardless of our own political affili-
ations, this is a good day, I believe, for 
the country and a good day for the 
Senate when 1 of the 100 is recognized 
in such a way and introduced to the 
American public with an opportunity 
to serve at a significant level. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, returning 
to the latest coronavirus emergency 
aid package—currently, the package 
doesn’t exist. There have been no bi-
partisan negotiations on it since last 
Friday. That is disappointing to all of 
us who are here, ready and willing to 
negotiate and vote for a strong bipar-
tisan relief package. 
The House of Representatives passed 
its strong package back on May 15, now 
nearly 3 months ago. Today is August 
12. There was some hope that maybe 
COVID–19 cases were ticking down-
ward. At the end of May, there was 
some hope that maybe the economic 
devastation was reducing, but COVID 
cases did not tick down over the sum-
mer as some had hoped. In fact, they 
have ticked up in many parts of the 
country, and the Senate has not taken 
any votes on the House bill or indeed 
on any bill. That is disappointing. 
More than that, it is disappointing 
for millions of Americans who are in 
the midst of hard times right now. 
They are worried about their own 
health or the health of their loved 
ones. They are worried about whether 
they will receive unemployment bene-
fits or how they will make rent or 
mortgage or how their children will get 
an education. We know in this body we 
can transcend politics as usual to ad-
dress the coronavirus because we did so 
in March by passing the CARES Act, 
even as Members of the body, including 
me, were getting coronavirus as we 
were having those negotiations. Even 
as staffers were getting it, even as Sen-
ate spouses were getting it, we stayed 
at the table and found a bipartisan bill 
that helped us deal with the challenge 
for a few critical months. 
But we are here debating this again 
because the magnitude of the crisis is 
not a crisis of a few months. No, it is 
such that the aid provided thus far is 
running out while Americans’ hard-
ships continue. That is why it is essen-
tial that we not give up and that we 
stay here as long as it takes to come 
through for the American people. 
I have heard some in Congress and, 
indeed, some in this body say about 
more Federal aid for the coronavirus 
response say: I just don’t see the need 
for it. Indeed, the majority leader has 
candidly acknowledged that approxi-
mately 20 Members of the Republican 
caucus will not vote for more aid. Well, 
I want to make the case first that 
there is need for it, and the need is un-
deniable because the circumstances 
that people are living in are dire. 
Last Friday, we found out that the 
unemployment rate in July was 10.2 
percent, which is a number that is 
higher than at any point during the 
2008, 2009 recession. The President 
called these ‘‘Great Jobs Numbers!’’ 
But I don’t see anything great about 1 
in 10 Americans who are in the work-
force not being able to find work. 
More than 30 million Americans are 
collecting unemployment benefits, and 
last week their benefit checks were cut 
by more than 50 percent. In Virginia, 
just as an example, unemployed work-
ers are now receiving a maximum—a 
maximum—of $378 a week. That is not 
enough to pay rent, let alone rent, gro-
ceries, childcare, electric bills, and 
many other costs that families face 
every day. 
Because they lost their jobs and 
other income, millions of Americans 
are now at risk of eviction or fore-
closure. The $600 Federal unemploy-
ment benefit and Federal eviction mor-
atorium were holding this off for many, 
but with those relief measures expir-
ing, families are unable to continue 
paying their August or September 
bills. 
One estimate is that 12 million evic-
tions will be filed by October, and 12 
million is essentially the combined 
population of about 6 or 7 States. There 
could be that many evictions filed by 
October. Just in Virginia there was a 
State-imposed 
eviction 
moratorium 
that lapsed for 5 weeks, and just in 
those 5 weeks, nearly 10,000 evictions 
were filed, potentially forcing people 
out of their homes. 
Three in ten Virginia renters sur-
veyed a couple weeks ago said that 
they were uncertain how they could 
pay August rent, and it was more than 
half of all African-American renters 
surveyed who said that was the case. 
Housing instability is difficult at any 
point in time, but imagine losing your 
housing during a pandemic. What are 
people supposed to do during a pan-
demic? The advice is, if you can stay 
home and don’t go out and don’t be 
with others, that will help keep your 
family safe. But how can you quar-
antine at home if you are in danger of 
losing your home? 
Like the majority leader, who quoted 
from constituents in Kentucky, I am 
hearing from Virginia constituents 
every day. 
From Allison in Henrico: 
I have now exhausted my savings account 
and have rent due, groceries to buy and bills 
to pay. I am now desperate for immediate 
help. 
From Rhys in Mechanicsville: 
I have three children, one with significant 
special needs. My wife cannot work now due 
to covid-19 and the school closures. I am be-
hind on numerous bills, including mortgage, 
utility, and other bills. 
From Dominique in Fairfax: 
My rent is now 3 months behind as well as 
my other bills and I am receiving letters 
[threatening] evictions and services being 
turned off. 
Unfortunately, these examples are 
now not aberrations, but they are com-
mon. We all know people—we all know 
people—who are at risk of losing their 
home 
or 
being 
hungry 
or 
losing 
healthcare or their savings being de-
pleted because of the absence of work. 
So we have to make sure that people 
are not removed from their homes in 
the middle of a health crisis. We need 
to make sure they can continue to pay 
bills until the health crisis is suffi-
ciently addressed and the economy gets 
back to where it was. 
Schools and colleges across the coun-
try are trying to reopen right now. It 
doesn’t matter if it is in person, online, 
or a hybrid model, we want them to re-
open safely right now, and this is the 
time to provide schools with the re-
sources they need to deliver quality in-
struction, not punish them for fol-
lowing public health guidance and 
data. 
Working families are struggling to 
find childcare options. This is critical 
to reopening the economy. Childcare 
providers themselves are struggling. 
Virginia, according to national sur-
veys, is at risk of losing 45 percent of 
its licensed childcare capacity; that is, 
130,000 childcare slots in Virginia with-
out the additional support they would 
need to help them stay viable. If we 
lose childcare capacity, that will have 
a significant consequence in terms of 
the ability of people to go back to work 
so that the economy can start to grow 
again. 
On the nutrition front, we are facing 
an unprecedented rise in food insecu-
rity as thousands of Virginians and 
millions of Americans have newly en-
rolled in the SNAP program. The 
Brookings 
Institute 
estimates 
that 
nearly 14 million children are living in 
food-insecure households—14 
million 
children. That is nearly six times the 
number of children who were food inse-
cure just as recently as 2018, and nearly 
three times as many who were food in-
secure at the peak of the great reces-
sion in 2008 and 2009. 
I bet all of my colleagues have expe-
rienced this because we are all out in 
our States talking to folks. Food banks 
have been slammed with demand they 
have never witnessed before, and it has 
been harder for food banks to get gro-
cery 
access 
because 
grocery 
store 
shelves have also been ravaged because 
people are going to grocery stores 
while restaurants are closed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5394 
August 12, 2020 
What do food banks do with increas-
ing demand and fewer donations from 
grocery stores? The Capital Area Food 
Bank purchased 100 semitruck loads of 
food in April, which is triple what the 
food bank purchased in all of 2019. Just 
in 1 month, they tripled their pur-
chases compared to 2019. The Blue 
Ridge Area Food Bank, which serves 
the western part of Virginia, saw the 
number of new families seeking food 
assistance quadruple from last year, 
just as of May. 
Americans are in a dire state. Their 
basic needs are at stake. We Democrats 
want to address that hardship. We did 
address that hardship in the Heroes 
Act, which we passed in mid-May. We 
want to keep people from losing their 
jobs, being evicted, and going hungry. 
I know there are many Republicans 
who share these same goals, but the 
proposals that have been on the table 
in this body are simply inadequate. 
There are areas that we agree on. Aid 
to 
small 
business 
is 
important. 
Broadband is important because as peo-
ple telecommute or get telehealth or 
get educational content online, they 
have to have access to broadband. Test-
ing is important. Childcare is impor-
tant to open the economy. These are 
important priorities I believe we can 
come together on, but the Republican 
plan that the Senate GOP introduced 
in this body, which the majority leader 
again acknowledges that at least 20 
Members of the caucus will not sup-
port, has large cuts to unemployment 
aid, no State and local government aid 
to prevent layoffs of first responders 
and vital programs and services. 
The majority leader characterized 
State and local government agencies as 
a ‘‘slush fund.’’ I was a mayor. I was a 
Governor. I know what is happening to 
State and local budgets, and when the 
revenues to State and local govern-
ments decline, there is about one place 
they can go, and the one place they can 
go is furloughs, waivers, salary cuts, 
and cutting personnel. 
The overwhelming majority of first 
responders in this country work for 
State and local governments. It is 
never a good time to cut police, fire, 
EMT, ambulance, healthcare workers— 
never a good time—but the worst time 
to do it is in the midst of a global 
health pandemic. It is not a slush fund; 
it is a necessity that the communities 
where people live and work have basic 
services to get through this challenge. 
The Republican proposal has inad-
equate education aid, no aid for the 
eviction tsunami that is facing us to 
provide rent or mortgage assistance, no 
nutrition aid in the SNAP program or 
otherwise to help the 14 million kids 
who, today, are living in food-insecure 
households. 
The Republican proposal did include 
a comprehensive liability shield to pre-
vent anyone from suing if their em-
ployer’s negligence causes a virus out-
break. I thought it was interesting that 
so often on the other side of the aisle 
in this body, when this prospective bill 
has been talked about, that has been in 
the front of the line as if the worry 
about lawsuits is the biggest concern 
that the American people have right 
now. No one in Virginia, when they tell 
me about their concerns, is putting 
worries about lawsuits up at the top of 
the list. We are talking about food, 
hunger, healthcare, and housing. 
The liability shield proposal in the 
GOP goes even further than protecting 
against liability; it wipes out States’ 
abilities to pass safety regulations. 
Virginia became the first State in the 
country to do an emergency temporary 
standard to provide guidance to public 
places and employers about safety 
standards that they could use on the 
job. It is good to get advice about safe-
ty standards because most businesses 
don’t have an NIH or CDC or a health 
department, so advice about standards 
that should be followed in workplaces 
is a great idea. Virginia became the 
first State in the country to do that. 
The Republican liability shield would 
not only give people liability protec-
tions, but it would take away the abil-
ity of the States to do what Virginia 
did to try to create lifesaving protec-
tions for workers and customers. That 
is unacceptable—unacceptable. 
Democrats offered to meet halfway. 
We knew when the Heroes Act passed— 
I mean, we have been around the block 
a few times. It wasn’t as if Senate Re-
publicans were just going to say: That 
is a good idea. We will just vote for it. 
That is not the way things work. The 
Senate Republicans would have their 
proposal just as the House Democrats 
have their proposal. The two proposals 
have dramatically different pricetags. 
The Senate proposal, together with the 
White House, came in the neighborhood 
of $1 trillion and the House proposal 
came in the neighborhood of $3 trillion. 
There is nothing magic about these 
numbers, but it is important to under-
stand that willingness to compromise 
is something Americans expect of us 
right now. Democrats said: OK, you 
have a package that is worth $1 tril-
lion, and we have a package that is 
worth $3 trillion. Let’s split the dif-
ference. We will have to decide how to 
compose the $2 trillion package, but 
let’s split the difference. The White 
House refused. The White House got an 
offer to meet halfway and said: That is 
not what we are going to do. We insist 
on the skinny version. 
The skinny version is inadequate to 
meet the challenge of the moment. 
This is the worst economic contraction 
in the 145 years that we have had meas-
ured quarterly economic growth in this 
country. This is the worst pandemic 
that the United States has dealt with 
since the Spanish flu of 1917 and 1918. A 
narrow bill isn’t enough. 
If you don’t like the Democratic bill 
because you think the pricetag is too 
big, how about meeting us halfway? 
That is the way negotiations so often 
happen. After the White House rejected 
the notion of meeting halfway, the 
President issued Executive orders that 
he claims break through the logjam. 
Like many things the President does, 
though, an analysis of the Executive 
orders demonstrates there is little sub-
stance there. The President proposed a 
deferred payroll tax collection. That 
doesn’t actually give Americans more 
money; it just gives them a larger tax 
bill next year. Because it is a deferral, 
the President cannot lift the obligation 
off either the employers or the employ-
ees. It is also very confusing to em-
ployers to suggest: OK, you should 
defer, but it is likely to start back up 
again. That is very, very hard for em-
ployers, especially small employers, to 
figure out. 
We all know that the payroll tax is 
the main pillar of Social Security, as 
every generation pays into the system 
while they are working so they can 
enjoy retirement with dignity in their 
senior years. President Trump has said 
that this isn’t just a deferral, but if he 
has his way and is reelected, he is 
going to permanently cancel the tax. 
That would undermine retirement se-
curity for all future generations. 
The Executive order with respect to 
housing did actually nothing. It just 
ordered agencies to look into delaying 
evictions and foreclosures, but no as-
sistance and no dollars for those facing 
eviction or for those facing fore-
closures. Look into ‘‘can you delay 
them.’’ 
Governors are already saying that 
the Executive order dealing with unem-
ployment aid is unworkable. It would 
be very difficult for them to recon-
figure their UI systems to do what the 
President has asked them to do and 
asked them to help pay for in the Exec-
utive order. Even if States could figure 
out how to launch a completely new 
system, the benefits would run out in 5 
weeks. 
On the surface, the Executive order 
with respect to student loan relief 
looks like an extension, but if you dig 
into it, that is not what it is. The order 
still leaves out 8 million Federal stu-
dent loan borrowers, and it doesn’t 
even mention whether borrowers’ cred-
it ratings and credit scores will be pro-
tected if they take advantage of what 
is offered to them under the EO. 
What about the millions of students 
who are struggling to financially find a 
way to go back to college, or the 
schools that are trying to find a way to 
still make sure students get an edu-
cation when they reopen, or the work-
ing families that are struggling to find 
childcare? School boards and super-
intendents around the country have 
come with a proposal saying that to 
open schools safely would cost about 
$175 billion, and that is what Demo-
crats have put on the table. That is not 
addressed at all in the Executive or-
ders, even as we stand at the threshold 
of schools reopening. 
In sum, the President’s Executive or-
ders address virtually none of the hard-
ships, solve virtually none of the hard-
ships, and lift virtually none of the 
burdens that Americans are suffering 
through right now. We are having hard

times. We are having hard times, and it 
is our duty to try to address that hard-
ship. 
Democrats 
are 
willing 
to 
com-
promise. When we say, ‘‘Hey, we have a 
plan but we will meet you halfway in 
your plan,’’ and the White House says, 
‘‘No,’’ you know, what are we supposed 
to do? What are we supposed to do? A 
skinny version isn’t sufficient for the 
magnitude of the crisis. 
The Senate Republican proposal has 
some elements that we support, but it 
leaves so many others unaddressed 
that it is not adequate. The Republican 
White House has rejected compromise. 
President Trump’s Executive orders 
are partly illegal, partly unworkable, 
and completely insufficient. It doesn’t 
have to be this way because there are 
many areas on which we can find 
agreement. 
I know many in this body are hearing 
from their home States’ Governors, 
mayors, local governments, colleges 
and universities, school boards and 
housing authorities, food banks, hos-
pitals, and the chambers of commerce. 
You are hearing the same thing that I 
am hearing from Virginians. 
So, as I conclude, it doesn’t have to 
be this way. We can put together a 
good bipartisan deal, but it can’t be a 
‘‘White House my way or the high-
way.’’ It has to be a willingness to 
meet and find compromise between a 
Democratic proposal and a proposal 
that is acceptable to at least some on 
the GOP side and the White House. 
Any large compromise in a divided 
government is bound to be imperfect. I 
am reminded of a quote from FDR dur-
ing the Depression years. You never 
really had to use quotes from the De-
pression because the magnitude of the 
Depression was different than what I 
have experienced during most of my 
life, but now quotes from the Depres-
sion, I think, bear some revisiting. 
Here is what FDR said as the adminis-
tration and Congress, at the time, were 
doing everything they could to figure 
out a way to help out needy Ameri-
cans: ‘‘Better the occasional faults of a 
government that lives in a spirit of 
charity than the consistent omissions 
of a government frozen in the ice of its 
own indifference.’’ 
By now, everybody knows somebody 
who has gotten COVID–19 or somebody 
who has gotten sick or even died or 
somebody who has lost a job or some-
body who is worried about rent or food. 
We all know those people, and many of 
us have experienced this in our own 
families. Are we going to help or are we 
going to be frozen in the ice of our own 
indifference? Let’s surprise the Senate. 
Let’s work together and get this done. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Nevada. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
you know, as I sit and listen to my col-
league from Virginia, I can’t agree 
more. Now is the time, really, for us to 
come together to do what the Senate 
traditionally does best, and that is 
working on the best interests of the 
people across this country who are 
struggling right now. 
Compromise is not a bad word. It is 
time for us to get in a room and really 
do the job that the American public ex-
pects us to do, and that is looking out 
for their best interests at a time when 
we have a healthcare pandemic. Now, 
keep in mind that this is a once-in-a- 
lifetime pandemic—once in a lifetime. 
So that requires us to come together 
and really focus on how we help Ameri-
cans across this country who are strug-
gling right now. They shouldn’t be pe-
nalized. 
We have asked them to stay home 
and shelter in place because we are try-
ing to address how we do the research 
that is necessary for a vaccine. Hope-
fully, one day, we will have that vac-
cine. We need to ramp up the testing 
that is needed so everybody can feel 
safe and comfortable knowing whether 
they have this virus or not or the anti-
body, but we are not there yet because 
more work needs to be done, particu-
larly by this Congress. 
The American public has heard us, 
and they are sheltering in place, they 
are staying home, and they have shut-
tered their businesses. Now, more than 
ever, this country needs the Senate to 
act. 
The House has done its job 2 months 
ago. They worked a comprehensive 
package, and I say ‘‘comprehensive’’ 
because we can’t just pick and choose 
winners and losers here. This isn’t 
what this is about. This is about mak-
ing sure we are bringing relief and 
helping those across this country. Ev-
erybody is impacted. We have promised 
them: If you do what we say and we 
help stem the spread of this virus, we 
are going to have your backs, and we 
are going to take care of you. 
I will say that we have failed at that. 
This administration has failed. We 
have failed at that promise. I know 
when we all go to our offices or we go 
home to our States, we are hearing 
from our constituents. We get emails, 
we get calls, and we get letters. I know 
you all feel the same as I do, and we 
read them and we listen to them. I 
don’t know of one State in this country 
right now where somebody is not suf-
fering from this pandemic who needs 
our help. 
I know that is why I am here, be-
cause we all took the oath. We said we 
are going to be here to work in the best 
interests of our States and this country 
and to make sure that those individ-
uals across this country who pay our 
salaries—those taxpayers—expect us to 
do our jobs and work. And that is what 
I am asking for right now. 
You know, I have been to the floor of 
the Senate this week to talk about the 
struggles that I see in my State. We all 
get letters, and I do want to focus 
today on one. There are so many, and 
that is why a comprehensive package is 
necessary. Right now, I would love to 
talk to you about what I am seeing in 
my home State when it comes to our 
seniors and those who are in need right 
now with funding to help nursing 
homes. 
Let me just start with letters be-
cause I think this is how it starts with 
all of us—calls into our offices and let-
ters coming from our constituents. 
There are two calls that I received. One 
of them was from a daughter who 
called in for her father, who is in a VA 
nursing home in Boulder City, NV, and 
because he isn’t showing symptoms, he 
isn’t getting tested. With so many 
cases there, how is this possible? Where 
are the tests? This is a daughter who is 
concerned for her father, knowing that 
if we just get people tested, there is 
that comfort in knowing whether or 
not you have this virus and whether 
you should be quarantined or how we 
protect you, particularly those in nurs-
ing homes. 
Then, another call I received was 
from a mother. She is also a certified 
nursing assistant at a nursing home, 
and she is telling me that many there 
quit because they don’t have the proper 
PPE. They want to work, but they 
don’t want to expose themselves. So 
what are we doing right now to address 
all of these needs? 
And, listen, there is so much. It is 
overwhelming. I know it. That is why 
we were sent here for the hard deci-
sions, not the easy ones, to make sure 
we are all working in the best interests 
of the people in our States. I know you 
all feel the same way. 
I have to tell you this. There are 
thousands of Nevadans that know the 
anxiety that comes because there is a 
spouse, a parent, or a grandparent in a 
nursing home, and they are unable to 
visit with them or hug their loved ones 
for fear of giving COVID–19. You have 
seen it. You have heard it, and I have 
heard it. Too many loved ones have 
lost their loved ones because of this 
virus, and they were not able to be 
there. 
Do you know who was there with 
them in the nursing home? Those in-
credible heroes on the frontlines, who 
are sacrificing their own health to be 
with them, for those who passed away 
because of COVID–19. There are so 
many factors that raise a coronavirus 
risk for nursing home residents. The 
majority of the residents, as we all 
know, are seniors. Many have under-
lying conditions. They live in closed 
quarters, 
and 
they 
share 
common 
spaces. And we also know this: Resi-
dents and staff of these facilities 
shouldn’t be an afterthought. They are 
a core part of our communities and our 
healthcare system. They are the elders, 
and they are the keepers of our stories. 
We have to do more to protect them. 
We need to protect the workers in 
these homes, too, many of whom be-
long to communities of color and who 
are struggling to provide care to a pop-
ulation with unique needs. 
The reason why I bring this up is be-
cause there is legislation out there to

do just what I am talking about and 
what we need in our communities. It is 
not something new. It has already been 
introduced. My colleague BOB CASEY 
introduced the Nursing Home COVID– 
19 Protection and Prevention Act to 
get nursing and long-care facilities in 
Nevada and across this country more 
PPE, the testing that they need, and 
the staffing to help the staff and those 
who are in those communities. 
These homes need support to slow 
the spread of the virus and to respond 
rapidly when it crops up, using all we 
have learned from combating this virus 
so far. The bill funds teams of nurses 
and other critical staff to lend emer-
gency help at nursing homes with out-
breaks and to bring the best practices 
to bear in helping sick residents. 
This bill ensures folks in my home 
State and across the country are being 
taken care of and that families have 
peace of mind that there is account-
ability for providers and protections in 
place for workers. 
I am hearing from family members 
and loved ones with those in nursing 
homes in my State. I am hearing from 
caregivers and healthcare workers. I 
know all of you are as well, and one 
thing that comes from all these people 
is a feeling of being forgotten. No one— 
no one—in America should feel forgot-
ten right now. It is time for us to come 
together. 
We need to make sure nursing homes 
follow guidelines and that, if they fail 
to do so, they will be held accountable. 
We also must arm them with the tools 
they need to face a virus that has been 
relentless in attacking seniors. We 
should 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
next 
coronavirus package that we should be 
negotiating and working on right now 
does everything it can to support the 
most fragile in our communities be-
cause they are also some of our most 
precious. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I think 
the President of the United States has 
done the things he can do within his 
authority to try to address the issues 
before us, but the truth is, his author-
ity just doesn’t go far enough. 
Now, I have frequently questioned 
the President’s view of how broad the 
Presidential authority is, but in these 
actions he took in the last few days, I 
looked at them carefully, and I think 
he had the authority to do what he did, 
but he would probably be the first to 
admit 
that 
the 
authority 
he 
has 
doesn’t solve the problem the way it 
needs to be solved. 
It is time that the Congress stepped 
up and did its job. You know, in this 
debate with the President, there is the 
article I view of the government. There 
is a reason that the legislative branch 
is article I. There is a reason it is our 
job to pass laws, and there is a reason 
that it is the President’s job to execute 
those laws. Occasionally, the President 
has to act quicker on some emergency 
basis than the Congress, and within the 
fairly narrow ability he has to act on 
this issue, he has tried his best to step 
up where the Congress has failed to 
step up. 
My good friend from Virginia just 
said: Well, the House bill is $3 trillion, 
and the Senate bill is $1 trillion. We 
should figure out how to compromise 
at $2 trillion. Now, I believe in com-
promise. I think it is the essence of de-
mocracy, but compromise actually has 
to be based on some principle of the 
issue you are dealing with. You know, 
if the House bill had been $5 trillion, I 
guess the logic would be that we com-
promise at $3 trillion. If they had 
known that, their bill would have prob-
ably been $5 trillion. 
When the bill was passed, it was de-
scribed by more than one reporter as a 
Democratic wish list or the ultimate 
campaign platform having everything 
in it. It was described by a whole lot 
more than one reporter that about a 
third of their bill had nothing to do 
with COVID, and another third of their 
bill is about the big question of what 
we can do to help State and local gov-
ernment. 
Let’s put that issue aside for a 
minute. It is an issue that clearly the 
House feels strongly about. Clearly, 
there are challenges to governments, 
particularly at the local level, I think, 
and that has to be dealt with in some 
way and maybe not at the $871 billion 
level or whatever they have suggested. 
But that is a different issue that I will, 
first of all, concede is very much part 
of the discussion and should be. 
But if you take out the third of the 
bill that has nothing to do with 
COVID—let’s get that off the table. We 
could have a debate about whether peo-
ple who are in the legal marijuana 
trade should get access to banking, but 
I think you have to work really hard to 
make that a COVID issue. We could 
have a debate about whether the Fed-
eral Government should require every 
State in the country to allow ballot 
harvesting, but I think that is very 
hard to make a COVID–19 issue. 
A third of the bill, according to many 
people who analyzed the bill when it 
came out, has nothing to do with 
COVID. So let’s set aside the other 
third of the bill that deals with State 
and local government, our giving State 
and local government what we don’t 
have to replace money they don’t have. 
I am not going to say that some ele-
ment of that will not be in a final bill, 
but let’s talk about the things we all 
know need to be in the first bill, which, 
in the House bill, were about $1 tril-
lion. 
How do you compromise with the 
House when you agree with them on a 
number and they change the number? 
Getting back to school is a critical 
part of what ought to be happening 
right now. By the way, back-to-school 
money the schools get in December 
will not be nearly as helpful as back- 
to-school money the schools get in Au-
gust. They need the money now. We 
need to see kids back to school, wheth-
er it is distance learning, which takes 
some assets and planning that districts 
need to do more on, or in-person learn-
ing where that is possible, where you 
have more expenses for probably more 
bus routes so you don’t put as many 
people on the same bus, more expenses 
for delayed starting times, and more 
expenses for social distancing in class-
rooms. They need that money now. 
In their bill, the Heroes Act, for ele-
mentary, secondary, and higher edu-
cation, the House put in $100 billion. 
We looked at that carefully. I chair the 
committee 
that 
does 
that 
appro-
priating. I think we know as much in 
our committee as anybody in the Sen-
ate about some of the needs that are 
out there. We thought the number was 
$105 billion. As soon as our bill came 
out, the House decided, no, we really 
need $400 billion. How do you meet 
somebody in the middle when they 
keep changing where the middle is? 
The Heroes Act, which Members on 
the other side of the aisle have repeat-
edly said we should pass and pass im-
mediately, had $100 billion. We had $105 
billion. You would think that would 
have been good enough. We might have 
argued some about the language, but 
there is not much difference on the lan-
guage. The argument is that Repub-
licans never spend enough, according 
to Democrats, and the Democrats seem 
to have no limit on what they are will-
ing to spend, according to us. 
For childcare, there is a critical need 
for people to get both back to school 
and back to work. The childcare sys-
tem is intensely stressed as part of 
what is going on—people who lose their 
jobs and take their children out of 
childcare; people who would prefer, 
after they have figured out how to do 
this a different way, not to put their 
kids back in childcare for a little 
while. I haven’t talked to anybody who 
thinks the childcare system would 
have more than 50 percent of the kids 
willing to come back who were there 
before. So how do you still make 
childcare work? Do you double the 
childcare cost to make up for the fact 
that 50 percent of the kids aren’t 
there? Of course not. That doesn’t work 
at all. 
The House put in the Heroes Act $7.5 
billion for childcare; we put $15 billion 
for childcare. Then the House decides: 
Well, no, we really need $40 billion or 
$50 billion for childcare. It is pretty 
hard to compromise in the middle if 
the middle was somewhere between $15 
billion—and I think, hopefully, our 
number would have prevailed—and $7.5 
billion, and then suddenly the middle is 
somewhere between $50 billion and $15 
billion. 
Let’s be serious here. Let’s get this 
job done. Let’s get kids back to school. 
Let’s get people back to work. Let’s 
get childcare back for kids. Let’s do 
what we can to restore the healthcare 
system 
that 
has 
been

August 12, 2020 
stressed during this, and let’s quit act-
ing like there is this vast disagree-
ment, when the disagreement is way 
more apparent than real. 
If you look at the third of the bill 
that dealt with COVID–19 that the 
House passed, we are very close. We are 
a little ahead of them on testing. Test-
ing absolutely is essential, in my view, 
to get kids back to school and to get 
people back to work. Until we get well 
into the vaccine period, having the vac-
cine and getting that vaccine to people, 
testing is going to continue to be crit-
ical. We have money for vaccines and 
vaccine distribution that I think ex-
ceeds the House bill money. We could 
talk about what is really not a very big 
difference in a $1 trillion bill or some-
thing a little more than that. 
We have said in our bill that, on test-
ing, on vaccines, and on other things, 
we are going to set some priorities. We 
said the Federal Government priority 
is to be sure that everybody gets that 
test in whatever way they can get it as 
quickly as they can get it. We said 
nursing homes, childcare centers, ele-
mentary and secondary education, and 
colleges and universities would be Fed-
eral priorities. Employers are going to 
have to help with some of the work-
place priorities, but we think those are 
the right Federal priorities, and we put 
it in our bill. 
Back to work: You have to have 
childcare, again, to get back to work. 
A second round of PPP: Again, some-
thing the Senator from Virginia agreed 
we need to do. 
Healthcare provider assistance: We 
ask our healthcare providers to do the 
two hardest things you could possibly 
do at the same time; one was stop all of 
the income you can possibly stop—stop 
the so-called elective surgeries. By the 
way, some elective surgeries get less 
elective the longer you wait until you 
have them, and we are seeing some re-
sults of that right now. I think there 
was some logic to stop putting people 
into the hospital, if you didn’t have to, 
or having them in the surgeon’s facil-
ity, if you didn’t have to, until we 
knew what was happening here—and 
not only stop the income but stand 
ready for the worst epidemic your com-
munity may have ever had to deal with 
or may ever have to deal with at any 
time in the future. So maintain your 
full readiness, stop your income. We 
need to come back now for the third 
time and provide money for providers. 
Again, money now is much more valu-
able than money 90 days from now. 
Telemedicine: We finally have woken 
up to what the Federal Government 
should have been doing for a decade 
and embrace telemedicine as part of 
normal office visits that don’t have to 
happen in the office as part of behav-
ioral health. 
Our bill says that CMS, which deter-
mines how Medicare money is spent, 
can’t go back on what they have al-
lowed in the last few months, ever. And 
on some of the things they have al-
lowed, they can’t go back for a signifi-
cant period of time to see how this 
works. 
Broadband: We could deal with this. 
If we are going to have telemedicine 
and telebehavioral health, that kind of 
medicine, as well as other kinds of 
medicines, you need to have access to 
broadband. Kids who are learning re-
motely have to have the same oppor-
tunity as other kids who are learning 
remotely and need to have access to 
broadband. They need it as soon as 
they can get it, whether that is assist-
ance to get hooked up, which is a little 
easier than just access. We have been 
working hard in this Senate and in our 
State legislature in my State to get 
the Missourians who don’t have access 
to high-speed broadband to get that ac-
cess. 
There are areas here that are areas 
we need to be dealing with. Most of 
them, you have to really work hard to 
pretend there is a disagreement. Sure, 
you can decide that your education 
category was really only 25 percent of 
what you really needed, but I think our 
House friends know that is not right, 
and we know that is not right. 
This is probably not the last bill we 
will pass, if it turns out we are incor-
rect on our $100 billion or $105 billion, 
but $100 billion right now to schools 
trying to get started is worth more 
than what $200 billion will be in May. 
Let’s give people the help they need

about whether the President has inad-
equate tools to do what everybody 
knows needs to be done. Certainly, that 
is true. That should be true; that under 
the Constitution, the Congress has to 
do its job. 
Compromise is more than some mid-
dle number between an outrageous 
number and a number that may turn 
out to be not quite big enough. Let’s 
get serious. Let’s get back to work. 
Let’s do our job. Let’s get back to 
school, the country back to work, the 
country back to childcare, and do those 
things we need to do to restore both 
the healthcare system and, more im-
portantly, the health of every Amer-
ican we can possibly help.

VETERANS MENTAL HEALTH CARE 
IMPROVEMENT ACT 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak to a very important 
piece of legislation, which quietly 
passed this Chamber last week. It in-
cluded several provisions I authored 
and offered based upon my experience 
as a physician that specifically pro-
vides mental health support to Amer-
ica’s veterans. 
We all agree, we owe the men and 
women who fought and fight for this 
country a tremendous debt of gratitude 
for the sacrifices they made to preserve 
our freedom. It is dangerous, and our 
servicemembers answer the call. Many 
carry scars from injuries sustained dur-
ing that service. 
But there are scars that we cannot 
see. Service can take a physical toll 
but also a mental one. Too many vet-
erans struggle with mental health 
issues and suicidal thoughts. About 17 
veterans per day from all of our wars 
put together take their own lives. For 
comparison, 22 servicemembers were 
killed 
in 
combat 
in 
Afghanistan 
throughout all of 2019. We are losing 
thousands more veterans at home than 
we are losing fighting men and women 
in the field. That is something to pon-
der. 
We must do a better job of leading 
the mental health needs of veterans. 
Thankfully, this Chamber took a big 
step forward last week when we passed 
the Commander John Scott Hannon 
Veterans Mental Health Care Improve-
ment Act. 
The bill improves outreach to vet-
erans and offers new mental healthcare 
options in five major ways: First, the 
bill bolsters the VA’s mental health 
workforce to serve more veterans. It 
gives the VA direct hiring authority 
for mental health professionals. The 
VA can offer scholarships to mental 
health professionals to work at vet 
centers, and it provides for at least one 
suicide prevention coordinator at every 
Veterans’ Administration Hospital. 
It improves rural veterans’ access to 
mental healthcare by increasing the 
number of locations where veterans 
can access VA telehealth services. It 
also offers grants to non-VA organiza-
tions that provide mental health serv-
ices or alternative treatments to vet-
erans. 
The bill strengthens support and as-
sistance 
for 
servicemembers 
transitioning out of the military by 
automatically giving every service-
member a full year of VA healthcare 
when they leave the military. 
By the way, this came to my mind: It 
turns out that most suicides occur 
within 6 weeks of one of our soldiers or 
sailors or marines leaving the service; 
within 6 months of that departure is 
when they tend to commit suicide. But 
it is about 6 months before they first 
access VA services. We have to have 
this kind of transition point tightened 
and one that makes sure they all know 
they have VA benefits for that first 
year. 
The Veterans Mental Healthcare Im-
provement Act also studies and invests 
in innovative and alternative science- 
based treatment options. It invests in 
research on the impact of living at 
high altitudes, on veterans’ suicide 
risk, and on identifying and treating 
other risk factors for mental health ill-
ness. 
It holds the VA accountable for its 
mental healthcare and suicide preven-
tion efforts. It does this by examining

how the VA manages suicide preven-
tion resources and how the VA provides 
care and information sharing for vet-
erans seeking mental healthcare from 
both VA and community providers. 
This bill takes a strong, evidence- 
based approach to meeting veterans’ 
needs that haven’t always been given 
priority. It is encouraging to me that 
is bipartisan. At a time when we don’t 
appear to agree on very much, we are 
able to deliver for our heroes. 
I am proud to have worked with my 
Democratic colleagues to write bills 
that were included in this package. 
Senator TESTER and I partnered on the 
Promoting Coordination for Veteran 
Suicide Prevention Act. This bill, this 
amendment, ensures that a thorough 
review of veterans who die by suicide 
within 1 year of separation from the 
Armed Services is conducted jointly by 
both the Department of Defense and by 
the VA. 
As I mentioned, most suicides occur 
within 6 months of separating from 
service. If that is the case, then the De-
partment of Defense can do a review of 
what are those risk factors and have a 
warm handoff to the Veterans’ Admin-
istration Hospital. And because we 
made automatic that first year of serv-
ice within the VA, that warm handoff 
can be taken without any impediments 
of is there coverage or is there not. 
There is also going to be a partner-
ship between the mental health and 
suicide prevention experts in both the 
VA and DOD that will contribute to 
improved information sharing and help 
further close the gap in ensuring high- 
quality, seamless care between these 
two Departments, focusing on the serv-
iceperson who has now become a vet-
eran. 
Senator TESTER and I also worked to-
gether on the VA Research Approval 
Efficiency Act. This provision author-
izes the Veterans Administration to le-
verage accredited commercial institu-
tional review boards for use in connec-
tion with VA-sponsored clinical re-
search. Getting the VA commercial op-
tions for approving clinical trials will 
add much-needed efficiencies and begin 
to reduce the disparity with academic 
and other institutions that, today, lead 
in clinical trial administration. 
If we know that our treatments for 
those with mental illness often need to 
be improved, we want to give our vet-
erans access to those improved treat-
ments as soon as possible, but we also 
want to make sure that those treat-
ments suit the needs of the veteran. 
You can only do this by encouraging 
that research activity with full consent 
of the veteran—full consent—by which 
she or he may participate in these 
trials for her benefit, his benefit, but 
also for the benefit of us all. This re-
form enables the VA to increase the 
caliber care it delivers to veterans in a 
variety of clinical areas. 
Senator SINEMA and I introduced the 
Improving Mental Health Care for Vet-
erans Act. This provision requires VA 
and DOD to establish a joint clinical 
practice guideline for treatment of se-
rious mental illness. This common-
sense approach builds on an already ro-
bust library of clinical practice guide-
lines that serve to standardize and re-
inforce treatment procedures in other 
areas. 
Just as a point, if someone is found 
to be well-controlled in a certain med-
ical regimen but then they transition 
to another different care with a dif-
ferent formulary, then all the hard 
work to find just the right clinical 
pharmaceutical treatment program to 
keep the person balanced now has to be 
changed because the second depart-
ment has a different formulary—a dif-
ferent set of drugs with which they 
wish to treat—all the good work done 
here is lost there. 
We wish to eliminate that possibility 
by making sure there is a common set 
of clinical guidelines so that somebody 
with stress is passed off and it is seam-
less, both in terms of the clinical care, 
but also the medicines which they may 
take. 
The passage of the Commander John 
Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health 
Care Improvement Act is the culmina-
tion of a lot of hard work from both 
Democratic and Republican Senators. 
It now goes to the House for consider-
ation. I urge the House to swiftly pass 
this 
legislation 
so 
that 
President 
Trump can sign it into law. 
This bill will have a direct, positive 
impact in the care the VA delivers to 
American veterans. They answered the 
call to serve our Nation; now, Congress 
must answer the call to better serve 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
VETERANS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. I want to take a sec-
ond to thank the Presiding Officer for 
the great work that he is doing on the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee. As the 
Senator just spoke earlier, he is work-
ing hard to take these bills and im-
prove them. Everyone is working to-
gether, and we certainly appreciate the 
fact that the Senator has so much ex-
perience in a variety of different ways 
and has added so much the committee. 
We are very thankful for that. 
I rise today to recognize the signifi-
cant steps that the Senate recently 
took to improve the mental healthcare 
of veterans and save lives with the pas-
sage of the Commander John Scott 
Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act. This moves us one 
step closer to paving a new path for-
ward in suicide prevention and imple-
menting a new strategy that, I believe, 
will give hope and purpose to the men 
and women who live with these invis-
ible injuries. More than 50,000 organiza-
tions nationwide provide suicide pre-
vention services for veterans. These 
nonprofits and community organiza-
tions play a vital role and have taken 
the lead to build effective programs. 
I have heard from veterans how orga-
nizations like the one based in Rogers, 
AR, Sheep Dog Impact Assistance, are 
encouraging them to live their best 
life. I have also seen how outdoor 
therapies like Rivers of Recovery are 
supporting the mental health needs of 
veterans and how veteran service orga-
nizations are stepping up and address-
ing mental healthcare in their commu-
nities. 
We have so many organizations in 
Arkansas and throughout the country 
that are doing a great job in this ca-
pacity. In Mount Home, AR, the Dis-
abled 
American 
Veterans 
chapter 
changed its approach to outreach after 
the region experienced the highest vet-
eran suicide rate in the State, one of 
the highest in the Nation. Members en-
hanced their contact with veterans in 
the area. This connection has saved 
lives and reversed the suicide rate in 
Northern Arkansas. 
It makes sense that we harness the 
ideas and successes of this DAV chap-
ter and other advocates into sound pol-
icy. That is why I joined with Senator 
MARK
WARNER
to champion a new 
strategy that authorizes the VA to pro-
vide grants to nonprofits in their com-
munities, establishing a framework to 
coordinate these efforts and expand 
outreach to more veterans. Addition-
ally, this legislation will enable the VA 
to establish greater partnerships with 
communities to better measure the ef-
fectiveness of ongoing suicide preven-
tion programs. 
I appreciate the leadership of the VA 
Committee Chairman JERRY
MORAN, 
Ranking Member JON TESTER, and the 
assistance of them and their staffs in 
working with me and Senator WARNER 
and our staffs to include our proposal, 
the IMPROVE Well-Being for Veterans’ 
Act, in the comprehensive mental 
healthcare package, again, that we just 
passed in the Senate. I especially want 
to thank Rosie Heiss, Amanda Want, 
and Pat McGuigan, members of my 
staff who spent countless hours and 
worked with numerous groups to find a 
solution to help advance this idea. 
The VA estimates around 20 veterans 
commit suicide each day. That number 
has remained roughly unchanged de-
spite a tremendous increase in funding. 
Interestingly, only 6 of those 20 vet-
erans are receiving healthcare services 
in the VA. By sharing information and 
collaborating 
with 
veteran-serving 
nonprofits and other community orga-
nizations, we can expand our network 
and provide the help the veterans need 
and, ultimately, capture more veterans 
into our VA system. 
VA Secretary Robert Wilkie called 
this approach ‘‘key’’ to unlocking the

NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I 
rise in recognition of seersucker manu-
facturers and enthusiasts across the 
United States. I wish everyone a Happy 
National Seersucker Day. This unique-
ly American fashion has a storied his-
tory dating back to 1909. The first seer-
sucker suit was designed by Joseph 
Haspel at his Broad Street facility in 
New Orleans, LA. Louisiana is proud to 
have played an important part in intro-
ducing the country to seersucker ap-
parel. 
This 
lightweight 
cotton 
fabric, 
known for its signature pucker, has 
been worn and enjoyed by Americans 
across the country during the hot sum-
mer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: 
‘‘Hot is hot, no matter what you do for 
a living.’’ 
In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was es-
tablished by Members of this Chamber 
to honor this unique American fashion. 
I proudly resumed this tradition in 2014 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
and continued this tradition in the 
U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to des-
ignate June 13 as the seventh annual 
National Seersucker Day. I encourage 
everyone to wear seersucker on this 
day to commemorate this traditionally 
American clothing.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO THE 
TREASUREBELLES 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
the women of the TreasureBelles out of 
Treasure County for their efforts to 
promote Montana ag in their commu-
nity. 
The TreasureBelles are made up of 
over 20 women who have made it their 
goal to promote and highlight the im-
portance of beef through various ef-
forts to integrate agriculture into dif-
ferent community organizations and 
events. 
The TreasureBelles enjoy hosting Ag 
Day at the school in Hysham each 
Spring, feeding Lions Club members 
each month, serving food at the annual 
StreetFest, and rallying community 
members together to donate beef for 
student lunches. 
The TreasureBelles are also proud 
members of the Montana Cattlewomen 
Association and the American National 
Cattlewomen Association. 
It is my honor to recognize the 
TreasureBelles for their commitment 
to Montana ag, and I applaud their ef-
forts to serve their fellow Montanans 
in the Treasure County community.∑
