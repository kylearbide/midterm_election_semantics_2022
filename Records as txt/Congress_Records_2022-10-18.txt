PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, following the spate of mass 
shootings this weekend, we add Harri-
sonburg, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; 
Denver, Colorado; and Raleigh, North 
Carolina, to our ever-growing, though 
sadly incomplete, prayer list. We pray 
today for all communities grieving too 
many violent deaths and tragic injuries 
inflicted 
upon 
unsuspecting 
men, 
women, and children, most of whom 
were just going about the business and 
pleasure of their day. 
Hear our prayers as we seek to make 
sense of the senselessness of these 
events. 
Tend to our grief as we look for con-
solation 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
inconsolability 
that 
attend 
these 
crimes. 
Grant us a way forward as we search 
for answers while consumed by count-
less unanswerable questions. 
God, is it true, as St. Augustine as-
sured, that You permit such evil so as 
to transform it to a greater good? 
Give us, then, eyes to see, ears to 
hear, and hearts to believe in this un-
believable promise You offer. 
Then give us wills to live into the 
possibility of this impossible hope and 
to be the visible agents of Your invis-
ible grace. 
Holy God, we lay our finite lives to 
the infinite mercy found in Your name. 
Amen.

HONORING THE 2022 WOMEN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Women of the Year. 
The honorees represent some of the most out-
standing and dedicated women in California’s 
3rd Congressional District. Nominated by their 
peers, these women are recognized for the in-
tegral and crucial roles they play in improving 
the lives of everyone in their communities. 
This year marks the 102nd anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, which guaranteed and pro-
tected women’s constitutional right to vote. In 
securing the right to vote, suffragists broke 
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier to 
women’s full and equal citizenship in our 
country, signaling a new era of equality. Yet, 
even today, women still face significant bar-
riers to their rights and liberties from pay dis-
crimination to criminalizing women’s reproduc-
tive rights. I take heart that each of this year’s 
honorees will be a vital part of the work left to 
be done to realize women’s full equality and 
rights. 
The 2022 Women of the Year are: 
Yvonne Perkins is being honored as one of 
California’s 
3rd 
Congressional 
District’s 
Women of the Year. Yvonne is a devoted 
leader who has been a key part of the Yocha 
Dehe Wintun Nation. She has played an inte-
gral role in embodying the nation’s mission by 
caring 
for 
families 
and 
her 
community, 
strengthening their culture, and promoting self- 
governance and economic independence for 
future generations. Yvonne currently sits on 
the Tribal Council for the Yocha Dehe Wintun 
Nation as well as the Community Fund and 
several other Tribal committees. While working 
in these roles, she has played an important 
part in assisting the Yolo Food Bank fund their 
Yolo Grown program, Holiday Food Events, 
and was integral to the Tribe’s $2.5 million do-
nation to the Capital Campaign which helped 
fund the construction of a new food bank facil-
ity. Her work with the Community Fund main-
tains partnerships with over 400 diverse orga-
nizations throughout the county State, and 
country. Yvonne works to continue a philan-
thropic legacy that has granted more than $38 
million in funding to support programs and ini-
tiatives dedicated to assisting communities in 
need. In every role she has taken, she has al-
ways been a strong advocate for organizations 
serving the needs of the people throughout 
Yolo County. Yvonne is a vital member of the 
community whose leadership and service to 
others are an inspiration to all who meet her. 
Laura Proctor is the Coordinator for Solano 
County’s Project Linus Chapter, and her pas-
sion and hard work have turned this small, but 
dedicated group into a full-scale operation. A 
lifelong crocheter, she has always enjoyed 
making blankets, but Project Linus became a 
place where she could put her hobby to work 
for an important cause. Under her leadership, 
the Solano County chapter of Project Linus 
achieves its mission to ‘‘provide love, a sense 
of security, warmth, and comfort to children 
who are seriously ill, traumatized, or otherwise 
in need’’ through the gifts of new handmade 
blankets, 
lovingly 
created 
by 
volunteer 
‘‘blanketeers.’’ After taking the helm in 2011, 
she set up chapter meetings, collected all the 
blankets made by the local volunteers, and 
distributed them throughout Solano County to 
any organizations that would have contact with 
a child who might be in need. Since the orga-
nization’s inception, over 30,000 blankets have 
been lovingly made by hand, donated, and 
distributed to children throughout Solano 
County. Following the LNU Lightning Complex 
fire that devastated Vacaville in 2020, Laura 
reached out to individual families and provided 
personalized blankets. While Project Linus 
couldn’t rebuild their homes, Laura knew it 
could provide warm comfort during troubling 
times. Laura has worked tirelessly with her 
team of blanketeers to ensure that as many 
children in Solano County and beyond receive 
that comfort. Laura’s commitment and com-
passion are inspiring to all who know her. 
Tonya Racasner is the Supervisory Public 
Affairs Specialist at the 60th Air Mobility Com-
mand at Travis Air Force Base. She guides 
operations for three sections, media oper-
ations, command information, and community 
engagement for Air Mobility Command’s larg-
est mobility wing. Tonya manages a 16-mem-
ber communications team, directly supervising 
six civilian employees, and was instrumental in 
the team earning 18 higher headquarters 
awards as well as 14 Wing Staff Agency acco-
lades. She also serves as an advisor to the 
Commander, senior staff, and external lead-
ers. Tonya is the backbone of critical wing 
civic leader engagements with the commu-
nities surrounding Travis Air Force Base. She 
has actively coordinated more than three 
dozen meetings between base and local lead-
ers, fostering stakeholder support for military 
spousal license reciprocity as well as KC–46 
Pegasus operations. She has led four con-
gressional delegate visits through which she 
has communicated U.S. Air Force quality of 
life issues and promoted the significance of 
the 60th Air Mobility Wing mission to elected 
officials. In 2009, Tonya was appointed as the 
Acting Deputy Director of Public Affairs in ad-
dition to overseeing the Public Affairs budget 
and working as the Chief of the Media Division 
on space programs. She has also volunteered 
with the Solano County Health Department, 
promoting health awareness and resources to 
more than 1,000 health fair attendees. Tonya 
is an invaluable member of the Travis team 
and a critical part of the Solano community. 
Xo´chitl Rodriguez Murillo has distinguished 
herself through her service to Woodland, Yolo 
County, and the State of California. She is 
dedicated to serving our communities and has 
left a lasting impact on future generations. In 
2016, she broke a glass ceiling for the Latinx 
community when she ran for local office and 
became the first Latina to serve as Mayor of 
the City of Woodland. Xo´chitl hoped to be-
come an inspiration to others of her genera-
tion and future generations to run for office. In 
2018, she was instrumental in the passage of 
the City’s first Proclamation in support of the 
LGBTQ+ community, and in 2020 she contrib-
uted to the passage of city and school board 
measures that support individuals throughout 
her community. In 2019, she was appointed 
by Governor Gavin Newsom as Deputy Sec-
retary for Minority and Underrepresented Vet-
erans at the California Department of Veterans 
Affairs. Xo´chitl enjoys public service and advo-
cating for underserved communities. She is 
currently embarking on projects in support of 
Yolo County women, youth development pro-
grams, and public safety. She is invested in 
learning the needs of her community and 
seeking solutions that promote improvements 
in the quality of life of all those she can reach 
through her advocacy. Xo´chitl can often be 
found giving her time to local schools to in-
spire K–12 students; participating in Spanish- 
led presentations to parents seeking local, 
State, and Federal resources; assisting with 
citizenship applications; donating Christmas 
gifts to children of immigrant families; helping 
women get elected to State and local offices; 
volunteering during veteran’s holidays and 
fundraisers; and assisting with efforts to help 
mitigate the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Lisa Rowland Brasher is the President and 
Chief Executive Officer of the Jelly Belly 
Candy Company, a fifth-generation candy 
maker, and the first female to hold both titles. 
Continuing her family’s 151-year tradition of 
candy manufacturing, Lisa has been vital in 
helping the family-owned company grow into 
the worldwide sensation it is today. Over the 
years, Lisa has led company efforts to support 
local and national charities, including the com-
pany’s initiatives to support wounded military 
veterans and their families through the Camo 
Beans charity program. Her strength and per-
severance are infectious, making her an inspi-
ration to all who know her. Her dedication to 
giving back to the community demonstrates 
her selfless nature that serves to enrich the 
lives of those around her. She currently serves 
on the board of the National Confectioners As-
sociation and is a member of the Western 
Candy Conference. Additionally, she is a 
proud supporter of Leaven Kids, a non-profit 
organization benefiting youth in the Fairfield 
community through faith and education. Lisa 
exemplifies Solano County’s fortitude and re-
silience. Her in-depth knowledge and work 
ethic displayed throughout her career is re-
flected in her everyday life, making her an ex-
ceptional leader and role model to others. In 
2018, Lisa was inducted into the Candy Hall of 
Fame, a prestigious honor in the candy manu-
facturing world. In her acceptance speech, 
Lisa stated, ‘‘I am coming to realize that my 
passions and motivations are my strengths. 
That it’s not about filling my dad’s shoes, but 
rather about planting my feet right alongside 
them and adding my own unique leadership to 
our family history.’’ This comment truly rep-
resents Lisa’s courage, commitment to her

family’s legacy, and determination to make her 
mark on her family’s company. 
Dr. Rachel Russo is a Major in the United 
States Air Force, serving as an Active Duty 
trauma surgeon at the UC Davis Medical Cen-
ter while stationed at Travis Air Force Base. 
Since joining the Air Force in 2007 and com-
pleting medical school in 2011, she has be-
come a recognized national leader in trauma 
surgery, earning recognitions such as the 
American College of Surgeons Committee on 
Trauma’s top Military Future Trauma Leader 
and the Elks National Foundation Alum of the 
year. Driven by the experiences of military 
trauma surgeons serving in Operations Iraqi 
Freedom and Enduring Freedom, Dr. Russo 
has spent the last eight years conducting sur-
gical research with the military to develop new 
methods of saving lives on the battlefield and 
here at home. Dr. Russo and her colleagues 
at Travis AFB developed the Partial REBOA 
technique which works to keep patients suf-
fering from internal bleeding alive until they 
reach a surgeon. In 2017, she adapted its use 
for obstetrics, becoming the first in the U.S. to 
use it to save a mother and her unborn child. 
Her approach has been called revolutionary 
and is now used around the world. Dr. Russo 
now works with other hospitals to establish 
programs using this method to stop fatal 
bleeding in pregnant women. She also serves 
as an Assistant Professor of Surgery at UC 
Davis and the Uniformed Services University 
of Health Sciences, an instructor for American 
College of Surgeons courses, and the Surgical 
Director of the Combat Casualty Care Re-
search Program at David Grant Medical Cen-
ter. She is a member of the National 
Healthcare Disaster Expert panel, an Air Force 
Critical Care Air Transport Team leader, and 
contributes to the military’s Joint Trauma Sys-
tem Committee on Surgical Combat Casualty 
Care. Dr. Russo is an individual of exemplary 
character, a loving mother of two, and an in-
credible member of our community. 
Julie Sandino is an active member of the 
Sacramento River Delta community of Walnut 
Grove, a place filled with history, cultural rich-
ness, and diversity. She has a passion for re-
storing and preserving natural habitats and 
historical architecture throughout California, 
devoting her time to bringing special historical 
places back to life. Julie is known for her tal-
ent in developing beautiful venues she enjoys 
sharing with others. Most recently, she and 
her husband have partnered with the Grass-
land Environmental Education Center to offer 
their ranch as a place for students to learn 
about nature, conservancy, and sustainable 
agriculture. Julie is also the Founder and 
President of her own consulting film that has 
provided event coordinating and fundraising 
expertise to a variety of public, private, and 
non-profit organizations for over 30 years. 
Julie has also spent her life dedicated to civic 
engagement, becoming involved in local, 
State, and national initiatives, a value she 
shares with her husband and has proudly 
passed on to her children. The positive impact 
she and her family have had on the Delta 
community and throughout the State of Cali-
fornia will be felt for generations. 
Lynne Secrist is a dedicated community 
servant, educator, and musician whose posi-
tive impact can be felt throughout her commu-
nity. Lynne was a music teacher in the Win-
ters Joint Unified School District for 30 years, 
teaching a range of ages and types of music. 
As well as learning a musical skill, her stu-
dents come away with confidence and a 
sense of belonging due to her encouragement 
and inclusivity. Beyond her teaching, Lynne 
spent years producing ‘‘A Note of Elegance,’’ 
where 
she 
brought 
together 
musicians 
throughout the community to perform and 
raise money to support musical education. 
Lynne’s efforts over the years can be felt in 
Winters’ vibrant music scene, where she has 
organized adult vocal ensembles, community 
choruses 
for 
annual 
holiday 
tree-lighting 
events, and many other cherished musical tra-
ditions in her community. Lynne is also a 
member of the Guerilla Gardeners, a group 
that volunteers their time to beautify public 
spaces. She can also always be found helping 
out at the many festivals enjoyed in Winters 
and leads by example, encouraging others to

Dr. Aimee Sisson’s outstanding work is visi-
ble to all who live, work, attend school, and 
visit Yolo County. In the fall of 2020, Aimee 
became the Yolo County Health Officer and 
guided her county through one of the most 
challenging 
times 
in 
recent 
history. 
As 
COVID–19 therapeutics, antivirals, and vac-
cines became available, Dr. Sisson worked to 
prioritize and protect the most vulnerable, 
while disseminating truthful and accurate infor-
mation, always putting the goal of saving lives 
before all else. Those working alongside her 
on the COVID response teams appreciated 
that she always made time for staff and their 
priorities. She attended daily meetings with 
staff working in key areas such as vaccina-
tions and school safety to provide guidance 
and clarity, as well as to gauge how staff man-
aged high levels of stress. In a time of great 
division in the country, State, and even locally, 
Aimee continually bridged that divide, both at 
the individual level, as well as with partner 
agencies. Her leadership, care, and compas-
sion have never wavered as Yolo County 
moves into the recovery phase of the pan-
demic. She also serves as part of a leadership 
team within the Yolo County Health and 
Human Services Agency, working to support 
staff in recovering from three challenging 
years of pandemic response. In this role, 
Aimee looks for innovations that will have a 
measurable impact on healing staff and im-
proving the work environment of HHSA. She is 
a leader in her workplace and a trusted au-
thority throughout Yolo County. No single per-

19 pandemic response in Yolo County than

tions in the wake of the murders of George 
Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. 
She brought the perspective of her lived expe-
rience as a woman of color and her expertise 
in issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion to 
these conversations that helped countless

the country. Arika has also been a proud

IN RECOGNITION OF KIMBERLY- 
CLARK’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the 150th anniversary of 
Kimberly-Clark, a manufacturing and multi-
national corporation founded in 1872. 
Founded in Neenah, Wisconsin, by John 
Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles Clark, and 
Franklyn Shattuck, the company’s first busi-
ness was operating paper mills. Over the 
years, the company became known for its in-
novation and expansion, and proved to be a 
top competitor in the industry. In the 1950s, 
with booming success Kimberly-Clark ex-
panded internationally, opening countless op-
erations across the globe. All throughout this 
period of expansion, the company continued 
to operate by the founders’ core values of 
quality, service, and fair dealing. I commend 
Kimberly Clark’s revolutionary manufacturing 
capabilities and their continued dedication to 
their work. 
For the past 150 years, Kimberly-Clark has 
understood the basic needs of people by pro-
ducing essential personal care products. Kim-
berly-Clark’s emphasis on innovation has 
evolved into one of the most successful sto-
ries of product development. Kimberly-Clark’s 
creative passion has led to the invention of 
five of their eight major consumer product cat-
egories: facial tissues, paper towels, toilet 
paper on a roll, feminine pads, and disposable 
training pants. Through decades of expansion, 
Kimberly-Clark 
has 
countless 
well-known 
brands such as Andrex, Cottonelle, Depend, 
Huggies, Kleenex, Poise, Pentitude, Scott, and 
U by Kotex, that are a key part of life for peo-
ple in more than 175 countries. I applaud Kim-
berly-Clark for their continued growth and suc-
cess in the industry. 
Since the inception of Kimberly-Clark, they 
have embraced the importance of authenticity, 
accountability, care, and innovation. Operating 
under their Code of Conduct, the team at Kim-
berly-Clark have committed themselves to 
making positive contributions to the people 
they serve around the world. I extend my sin-
cere thanks to Kimberly-Clark for their excep-
tional work and continued growth over the 
past 150 years. 
Kimberly-Clark has been a pillar of the Fox 
Cities for generations, and I thank them for 
their work to continue providing good paying, 
stable jobs for Northeast Wisconsinites in the 
Fox Valley. 
I invite all Members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 150th anniversary of Kim-
berly-Clark. I offer my sincerest congratula-
tions to the entire Kimberly-Clark team and 
wish them lasting success for the future.

KIMBERLY-CLARK 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. GLENN GROTHMAN 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 150 
years ago, four young entrepreneurs—John 
Kimberly, Charles Clark, Frank Shattuck and 
Havilah Babcock—signed a partnership and 
invested a total of $30,000 to build a paper 
mill and established Kimberly, Clark & Com-
pany. Kimberly, Clark & Co.’s resulting Globe 
mill and its 40 employees began making 
newsprint on October 22, 1872. Since then, 
this company has invented five of the eight 
major consumer product categories it offers— 
facial tissue, paper towels, toilet tissue on a 
roll, feminine hygiene pads and disposable 
training pants. Kimberly-Clark is now a global 
consumer 
products 
manufacturer 
whose 
brands include Kleenex, Cottonelle, Depend, 
Kotex, Huggies, and Pull-Ups. Led by CEO 
Mike Hsu, Kimberly-Clark employs more than 
45,000 people and has net sales exceeding 
$19 billion annually. While Kimberly-Clark now 
does business in 175 countries, it still has a 
substantial amount of its manufacturing in 
Wisconsin and has been an incredible com-
munity partner in the local area. Kimberly- 
Clark has donated tens of millions of dollars 
over the decades to local non-profits, as well 
as volunteer hours and countless product do-
nations to help make life better for those in 
need. Again, congratulations to Kimberly Clark 
on 150 years of success. It is an honor to rep-
resent them and so many of their employees 
in Congress. I will continue to advocate for 
pro-business and pro-worker policies in Con-
gress and look forward to seeing where this 
great company goes in the future.

HONORING THE 2022 WOMEN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Women of the Year. 
The honorees represent some of the most out-
standing and dedicated women in California’s 
3rd Congressional District. Nominated by their 
peers, these women are recognized for the in-
tegral and crucial roles they play in improving 
the lives of everyone in their communities. 
This year marks the 102nd anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, which guaranteed and pro-
tected women’s constitutional right to vote. In 
securing the right to vote, suffragists broke 
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier to 
women’s full and equal citizenship in our 
country, signaling a new era of equality. Yet, 
even today, women still face significant bar-
riers to their rights and liberties from pay dis-
crimination to criminalizing women’s reproduc-
tive rights. I take heart that each of this year’s 
honorees will be a vital part of the work left to 
be done to realize women’s full equality and 
rights. 
The 2022 Women of the Year are:

out California and other states. Carol fre-
quently travels to Washington, DC, to meet 
with my colleagues and advocate on this 
issue. She is also passionate about equal pay 
for women, drawing attention to the many 
women who pause or delay their careers to 
care for their children and end up diminishing 
their retirement benefits. This has affected 
countless women who work in education and 
other industries, and Carol continues to fight 
for Social Security reform that would help fill 
that gap. Through her volunteer work, she 
also manages the California Retired Teachers 
Association’s scholarship programs providing 
funds to students in teaching credential pro-
grams. She also continues her work as a sub-
stitute teacher in the Fairfield-Suisun School 
District where she continues to have a positive 
impact on students’ lives. Carol acts as a 
mentor to many and a friend to all and gives 
tirelessly to her community. 
Christine Katzenmeyer is a tireless commu-
nity servant who has exhibited great commit-
ment and dedication to the Dixon Unified 
School District. Her continuous service has 
been unmatched and greatly appreciated by 
teachers and administrators alike. Over the 
years, Christine has served on numerous site 
councils and district-wide advisory committees 
where she works to ensure her community’s 
schools are the best they can be. For 14 
years, she has been a consistent participant in 
the district Destination Imagination program, 
working with individuals and groups on an an-
nual basis to help students discover their po-
tential. Christine has also worked diligently to 
support the Dixon High School Water Polo 
Team by organizing and hosting fundraisers 
for the team as well as annual scholarships 
given to Dixon High School students. Her cur-
rent work as a Solano County COVID liaison 
with both Dixon and Vacaville schools helps 
ensure our students receive the best school 
experience possible during a difficult time. Her 
service to the Dixon community has had an 
impact on countless students and families. 
I congratulate each of them and commend 
them for their work. I am inspired by them and 
firmly believe when women succeed, America 
succeeds!

REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND 
IMPACT OF RICHARD CALMA 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the incredible 
life and legacy of Richard A. ‘‘Rich’’ Calma. 
Rich dedicated his life to serving the Platts-
burgh community and honoring American his-
tory. 
Rich Calma began working at the Advocacy 
and Resource Center in Plattsburgh, New 
York in October of 2000. Rich carried out the 
mission of the Advocacy and Resource Center 
by providing job coaching to people with de-
velopmental and intellectual disabilities. He 
dedicated his life to this incredible service 
agency and worked towards supporting all in-
dividuals to ensure that everyone was able to 
fully participate and be accepted in all aspects 
of life. Rich started his career at the Advocacy 
and Resource Center as an employment spe-
cialist with the Workforce Network, Supported 
Employment Program. He worked his way up 
from being a relief job coach to the position of 
a full time employment specialist. For over 
twenty-one years, Rich was a beloved em-
ployee of the Advocacy and Resource Center, 
while he dedicated his life to serving the 
Plattsburgh community. 
In addition to working at the Advocacy and 
Resource Center, Rich prioritized celebrating, 
remembering, and honoring America’s military 
history. Rich actively participated in the annual 
Battle of Plattsburgh events to ensure the 
North Country’s role in American history con-
tinued to be remembered. He also spent a lot 
of time volunteering at the Air Force Museum 
and Marine recruitment center. 
Rich is a glowing example of the devotion to 
community service that defines the North 
Country. His legacy will live on in the hearts 
of everyone who had the pleasure of knowing 
him. On behalf of New York’s 21st Congres-
sional District, it is my honor to remember and 
celebrate the life of Rich Calma.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MRS. 
BARABARA 
ELLEN 
PALAZZOLO 
MARULLO 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. Barbara 
Ellen Palazzolo Marullo. 
Mrs. Marullo peacefully passed away Octo-
ber 3, 2022, surrounded by her loving family. 
She was born the third of four children on 
April 17, 1941, in Queens, New York to Emma 
and Joe Palazzolo. Four years later, her family 
moved back to her father’s hometown of New 
Orleans where they remained the rest of their 
lives. Barbara was a devout Catholic and be-
lieved in the blessing of family. As a young girl 
she would often spend long moments before 
bed praying for every single family member 
before going to sleep. Her faith remained 
strong until her death and was a hallmark of 
her character and personality. But it wasn’t 
just faith which defined Barbara, she was a 
talented singer. In her senior year at John 
McDonogh High School in the Mid-City neigh-
borhood of New Orleans, Barbara wrote and 
performed the class song for the graduation 
ceremony. So talented was she, that upon 
graduation, Barbara was offered a music 
scholarship to Southeastern University in 
Hammond, Louisiana, but turned it down opt-
ing to work and start a family. Though that 
didn’t quell her desire to continue singing. And 
anyone who knew Barbara, knew faith, family 
and music defined her, and through the years 
she juggled all of them. 
She met her first husband, Jack, in high 
school, and a couple of years later they mar-
ried and started a family. Together they had 
three children, Jay, Gina and Nicolle. During 
this time Barbara continued singing and work-
ing with local bands as the lead singer at local 
music venues and clubs throughout New Orle-
ans. 
As time progressed, thoughts and feelings 
changed and Barbara moved on from her first 
marriage, and eventually met and married her 
second husband A.P. Marullo who brought two 
children of his own from a previous marriage, 
Joey and Anna. With their blended family in 
place, Barbara and A.P. had two more chil-
dren together, Jude and Anthony. Through her 
life Barbara remained committed to her family 
and God, but music was never far from her 
heart. She continued singing in and around 
New Orleans, cut a few records and even per-
formed on live TV during the local segments 
of the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon. 
As time passed, Barbara moved away from 
performing for entertainment, and combined

her love of music, and her devotion to her 
faith, and began singing in church. 
Barbara sang regularly at her parish church, 
St. Peter, in Covington, Louisiana, as a cantor 
and choir member. She also made friends with 
the choir directors at the Catholic churches in 
Gulf Breeze and Pensacola Beach, Florida, 
and sang at Mass with their respective choirs 
during her frequent visits to the beach. Bar-
bara remained independent and active up until 
her time in the hospital before her passing and 
will be most remembered for her God-given 
natural beauty, lovely singing voice, and her 
passion and love she had for her family and 
God. 
Barbara was preceded in death by her 
mother Emma Palazzolo (Campione) and her 
father Joseph Palazzolo; her brother Jerome 
Palazzolo, and her sister Joyce Chiusano 
(Palazzolo), and is survived by her husband 
Anthony P. (AP) Marullo, Jr., her former hus-
band Jack W. Galle´ Sr.; her five children, Jack 
(Jay) W. Galle´, Jr., Gina Bergeron (Galle´), 
Nicolle Polit (Galle´), Jude D. Marullo, and A.P. 
(Anthony) Marullo, III; and her two step-chil-
dren Joey C. Marullo, and Anna M. Marullo. 
Barbara is also survived by four adult grand-
children, 
Brittany 
A. 
Polit, 
Gabrielle 
A. 
Bergeron, Edward C. Bergeron III, and Private 
Second-Class Timothy J. King; nine grand-
children, Elizabeth, Mia, Rocco, Eli, Enzo, Ily, 
Cohen, Gage, and Mila; and two step-grand-
children, Kai and Elise. Barbara is also sur-
vived by her sister, Cynthia Hern (Palazzolo). 
May the Lord cradle His child Barbara; may 
she rest in peace. 
So many people’s lives have been enriched 
because of the love and passion she ex-
pressed in touching them along the way. 
While the grieving process never truly ends, I 
pray that the day will come when her memory 
brings a smile to their face before it brings a 
tear to their eyes. There are no words to de-
scribe how much she was loved, and how 
greatly she will be missed.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
GROUNDBREAKING 
CEREMONY 
OF THE NEW MONROE COUNTY 
EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS 
CEN-
TER 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate today’s groundbreaking of the 
new Monroe County Emergency Operations 
Center (EOC). This center, which combines 
several existing emergency organizations in 
one 28,321-square-foot space, will greatly as-
sist county officials in the Florida Keys to pre-
pare for future natural disasters in our resilient 
community. 
Monroe County’s EOC previously occupied 
the top floor of the Marathon Government 
Center. In 2017, Hurricane Irma forced EOC 
staff to evacuate the center just one day be-
fore it made landfall 30 miles west of Mara-
thon, due to its lack of protections for Cat-
egory 3 and above hurricanes. 
The new EOC’s features include a 20-foot 
first floor elevation, Category-5 hurricane-hard-
ened walls, self-sustaining drinking water for 
up to 72 hours, and emergency power and 
communications systems. In addition, the loca-
tion, at the west end of Marathon International 
Airport, is highly strategic. If Overseas High-
way becomes unusable, the EOC will be able 
to quickly facilitate the dispersal of aid coming 
in through the airfield. This critical infrastruc-
ture will improve the county’s emergency re-
sponse capacity and ensures Monroe County 
will have the necessary tools to maintain resil-
iency and preparedness when natural disas-
ters impact our coast. I am proud that the 
state and federal governments assisted the 
county in securing $30.2 million of the nec-
essary funds to commence the project. 
South Florida’s residents face extreme 
weather every year, and improving hurricane 
resiliency is paramount. This long-overdue fa-
cility—Monroe County’s first dedicated emer-
gency operations center—will act as the cru-
cial hub for all future emergency responses. 
As a lifelong first responder who served as 
Fire Chief of the City of Miami Fire Depart-
ment during Hurricane Andrew and Mayor of 
Miami-Dade County for nine years, I know 
firsthand how important a rapid and effective 
disaster response is. I applaud all the individ-
uals and agencies who worked hard to make 
this center a reality, and I look forward to the 
speedy completion of the project.

HONORING THE 2022 WOMEN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Women of the Year. 
The honorees represent some of the most out-
standing and dedicated women in California’s 
3rd Congressional District. Nominated by their 
peers, these women are recognized for the in-
tegral and crucial roles they play in improving 
the lives of everyone in their communities. 
This year marks the 102nd anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, which guaranteed and pro-
tected women’s constitutional right to vote. In 
securing the right to vote, suffragists broke 
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier to 
women’s full and equal citizenship in our 
country, signaling a new era of equality. Yet, 
even today, women still face significant bar-
riers to their rights and liberties from pay dis-
crimination to criminalizing women’s reproduc-
tive rights. I take heart that each of this year’s 
honorees will be a vital part of the work left to 
be done to realize women’s full equality and 
rights. 
The 2022 Women of the Year are: 
Tracy Lahr is a dedicated and passionate 
teacher who has touched the lives of count-
less students. Several of her students took the 
time to write letters nominating her as a 
Woman of the Year, :describing her as loving, 
thoughtful, kind, supportive, uplifting, encour-
aging, and so much more. Their stories de-
scribe a woman who goes above and beyond 
to engage each and every one of her stu-
dents, providing a supportive presence in their 
life as well as an inspirational force pushing 
them to pursue their passions and excel in 
school and beyond. Tracy teaches Drama, 
Show Choir, and Leadership classes at Lower 
Lake High School where students say she 
never stops working hard on their behalf. She 
encourages students to become involved in 
the performing arts and to grow their leader-
ship skills. Her work makes the school a more 
vibrant place for every student and helps 
many discover new talents and interests. 
Tracy truly cares about the health and well- 
being of each of her students and makes an 
effort to connect with every one of them, offer-
ing support whenever it is needed. Educators 
play such a critical role in our communities 
and the lives of every young person. Tracy is 
an exceptional teacher who is a shining exam-
ple of what it means to be a positive force in 
a student’s life. While her school is surely 
sorry to see her retire from teaching, it is well- 
earned through her years of dedication to her 
students. 
Jill LeVake Abruzzini is an agricultural con-
sultant and youth advocate who is an integral 
member of her community. She is a third-gen-
eration member of California Women for Agri-
culture and has served as a representative for 
the involvement of young women in agriculture 
in a variety of capacities. After graduating col-
lege, Jill went on to become one of the young-
est women Pest Control Advisers in the state. 
As not only the youngest but one of only a 
handful of women in this male-dominated pro-
fession, one of her greatest accomplishments 
in the role has been mentoring other young 
women. She was invited to share her experi-
ences as a panelist for the Grow by FarmHer 
event at the World Ag Expo and served as a 
member of the Cal Poly Crop Science Advi-
sory Board. Over the past two decades, she 
has served in a variety of leadership positions 
and was recently promoted to Western Mar-
keting Manager with Corteva AgriScience, 
overseeing operations in nine western states. 
She has dedicated her entire adult life to help-
ing farmers with their crop protection needs 
and can frequently be found walking orchards, 
advising growers on how to manage pests and 
bring in a healthy crop. In addition to her pro-
fessional accomplishments and active commu-
nity involvement, she has three children who 
share her passions and are active in sports, 
4–H and FFA. Her strong commitment to 
youth in the Yuba-Sutter area is demonstrated 
by her active involvement and leadership in 4– 
H and FFA programs. She serves on the Yuba 
Sutter Junior Livestock Auction Committee 
and has been a Governor appointee to the 
Yuba-Sutter Fair Board for six years. Jill is an 
integral member of the Yuba-Sutter agricul-
tural community and an inspirational mentor 
for young women in agriculture. 
Emily Lo is a dedicated first responder who 
has spent 31 years as a firefighter, excelling 
in a career that has not always welcomed 
women. She immigrated to the United States 
with her family in 1981 and after attending So-
lano Community College Fire Academy, was 
hired by the City of Fairfield Fire Department. 
A year and a half later, she joined the Davis 
Fire Department, where she has served ever 
since. Since then, she has earned an Asso-
ciate of Science in Fire Technology from 
American River College, and a Bachelor of 
Science in Fire Service Management from 
California State University, Sacramento. She 
was promoted to Fire Captain in 2002, and in 
February 2022, after 31 years in the fire serv-
ice, she became the first female and Asian- 
American Battalion Chief in Davis Fire Depart-
ment history. The dedication and strength 
needed to serve for 31 years as a firefighter 
is impressive for anyone, but even more so for

ing in insurance, Courtney worked in the field 
of psychology, helping children on the autism 
spectrum. Motivated by her experiences as a 
single parent and the needs she saw in oth-
ers, she began her passion project, Threads 
to Thrive, an organization that provides busi-
ness attire to men and women who cannot 
otherwise afford professional attire needed for 
interviews and new employment. This assist-
ance helps remove a barrier to employment 
and improves confidence for many community 
members. Courtney also gives her time volun-
teering with a wide variety of other community 
organizations and nonprofits where she is 
known for her hard work and generosity. 
Darelyn Pazdel is a dedicated and pas-
sionate role model to everyone in her commu-
nity. She is the current Director of Workforce 
Inclusion, Community Integration, and Trans-
portation for PRIDE Industries, an organization 
that works to create employment for people 
with disabilities. Darelyn is a fierce advocate 
for people of all abilities, consistently dem-
onstrating her belief that all people have tal-
ent, and that when people of all abilities know 
they are respected and have an opportunity to 
contribute, they can reach their full potential. 
Darelyn has also been a part of the Fairfield 
Suisun Chamber of Commerce for over a dec-
ade where she currently serves as Chair of 
the Board of Directors. Along with the ’amaz-
ing work she does in her professional capac-
ity, she is an advocate for her community and 
gives back in any way she can. Darelyn is 
known as both a champion for small busi-
nesses as well as a strong advocate for indi-
viduals with disabilities in our community. 
I congratulate each of them and commend 
them for their work. I am inspired by them and 
firmly believe when women succeed, America 
succeeds! 
APPRECIATION 
FOR 
THOSE 
IN-
VOLVED IN THE PRESERVATION 
OF 
KETTLE 
CREEK 
BATTLE-
FIELD 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the preservation of the 
American Revolutionary War battlefield site at 
Kettle Creek and to thank all of those individ-
uals involved in this effort over the years. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I have 
been a strong advocate for preserving Amer-
ica’s historic battlefields. I have supported nu-
merous battlefield conservation efforts and 
have pushed for the preservation of the Kettle 
Creek Battlefield. 
During the 115th Congress, I introduced 
H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battle-
fields Act, to reauthorize the Battlefield Land 
Acquisition Grants Program to ensure the suc-
cessful preservation of the Revolutionary War, 
War of 1812, and Civil War battlefields. 
During the 116th Congress, I introduced 
H.R. 306, the Kettle Creek Battlefield Survey 
Act. The legislation would help evaluate the 
significance of the Kettle Creek battlefield site 
and determine its suitability as a designated 
unit of the National Park System. 
America’s preserved battlefields stand as 
magnificent memorials to our Nation’s history 
and the courage of those individuals who gave 
the ‘‘last full measure of devotion’’ to our 
country. People who visit these historical sites 
cannot help but walk away with a greater ap-
preciation of the sacrifices necessary to se-
cure the freedoms we enjoy today. 
Congress has made significant strides in 
preserving the history of America. Unfortu-
nately, too many of our Nation’s founding mo-
ments, including many Revolutionary War bat-
tlefields, are slowly disappearing with the pas-
sage of time. As these places fade away, 
Americans become unaware that many of our 
Nation’s defining moments occurred right in 
their own backyards. 
Kettle Creek Battlefield will not be forgotten 
thanks to the dedication and hard work of so 
many organizations and individuals. 
Located in Wilkes County, Georgia, the Bat-
tle of Kettle Creek occurred on February 14, 
1779. It was a significant victory for the Patriot 
forces during the Southern Campaign of the 
American Revolutionary War. 
Led by Colonel Andrew Pickens, Patriot 
forces made a surprise attack on a large Brit-
ish allied Tory militia marching toward Au-
gusta, Georgia. Despite outnumbering the Pa-
triot forces nearly two to one, the ensuing 
four-hour bloody battle resulted in significant 
casualties for the Tory forces. With the Tory 
forces fleeing the battlefield, a Patriot victory 
was won. This valiant effort by Colonel Pick-
ens and his men stopped any hope of a Brit-
ish advance into the backcountry frontier of 
Georgia. 
One of the notable stories from the battle I’d 
like to share is about an individual named 
Austin Dabney. Despite being a slave, Mr. 
Dabney was a private in the Patriot militia and 
served with honor and distinction until he was 
wounded at the Battle of Kettle Creek. 
And though crippled, after the battle, he re-
turned to servitude. Mr. Dabney’s actions that 
day were not forgotten. In fact, after the war 
in 1786, an official act of the Georgia State 
Legislature emancipated Mr. Dabney and 
granted him 50 acres of land and an annual 
pension. This short statement of Mr. Dabney 
only scratches the surface of his incredible 
story. And yet it’s something that we need 
never forget. 
Efforts to preserve the sacred site of the 
Kettle Creek Battlefield date back nearly one 
hundred years. Many individuals and organiza-
tions, including U.S. Senator Richard Russell 
and the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion, have tried to ensure that this hallowed 
ground, and its priceless stories are not lost to 
time. Thankfully, a few individuals persevered. 
Following a momentous visit by the National 
Park Service Acting Director Dan Smith, the 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior, David Bernhardt, finally designated the 
Kettle Creek Battlefield as an affiliated site of 
the National Park Service on January 14, 
2021. 
With this designation, the National Park 
Service recognized the national significance of 
the Kettle Creek victory and committed to pre-
serving this vital part of history for future gen-
erations. 
This recognition is an enormous win for 
those who have spent years working towards 
this goal. I want to extend a special ‘thank 
you’ to a few individuals and organizations 
who went above and beyond the call of duty 
and helped make this day happen. 
First, I want to thank the community leaders 
of Wilkes County, including the Board of Com-
missioners, for their years of hard work that 
made it possible for Kettle Creek Battlefield to 
receive the recognition it deserves. 
I also want to thank former University of 
Georgia football coach (GO DAWGS!) and 
Civil War historian Vince Dooley and the 
American Battlefield Trust for acquiring 180 
acres of the battlefield to transform these hal-
lowed grounds into an educational, historic 
destination. 
Finally, I want to offer the most significant 
gesture of appreciation to Dr. Joe Harris and 
the Kettle Creek Battlefield Association. The 
incredible efforts of Dr. Harris and the KCBA 
to preserve the battlefield and its stories 
should be an inspirational example of what 
tireless dedication and selfless public service 
will achieve. 
These individuals and countless others from 
across the community, region, the State of 
Georgia, and beyond have made it possible to 
ensure future generations can learn about and 
appreciate this important part of Georgian and 
American history. 
I hope that one day my colleagues in this 
chamber and their constituents will visit the 
storied grounds of what Colonel Pickens de-
scribed as the most significant victory of the 
Southern Campaign and a place where a 
young African American Patriot earned his 
freedom 86 years prior to the end of slavery, 
for I firmly believe they are more than signifi-
cant enough to preserve for future genera-
tions. 
I am proud to have been a part of the effort 
to preserve the history of Kettle Creek. I invite 
my colleagues to join me in celebrating this 
achievement, and I give my heartfelt apprecia-
tion to those individuals that made this mo-
ment possible.

HONORING HENRY TAMARIN 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor the life of Henry Tamarin, an extraor-
dinary labor leader and organizer. He was a 
special mentor and friend to me. Henry 
passed away peacefully at his home in New 
York City on August 26, 2022, at the age of 
77. He was surrounded by his loved ones at 
the time of his passing. 
Henry Tamarin was born in New York City, 
and became an organizer, union leader, and 
union president. He was best known for his 
activism and leadership in Chicago’s labor 
movement. Tamarin, a former member of the 
Chicago Federation of Labor Executive Board, 
came to Chicago in 1999 and was elected 
president of UNITE HERE Local 1 in 2001. He 
served in this role until 2013 when he stepped 
aside and transitioned the local to the next 
generation of leaders. Before arriving in Chi-
cago, Tamarin led UNITE HERE Local 217 in 
Connecticut, and UNITE HERE Local 100 in 
New York City. 
The labor and social justice activism that he 
dedicated his entire life to was evident in his 
youth. On August 28, 1963, Tamarin and his 
father were witness to history as they watched 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. deliver his ‘‘I Have 
a Dream’’ speech at the March on Wash-
ington. Henry’s son Nate said his father called 
it one of proudest moments of his life. 
Tamarin attended Earlham College, and 
later the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where he received his degree. Tamarin orga-
nized, marched, and sat-in for peace and civil 
rights. After college, Tamarin lived in San 
Francisco’s Haight Ashbury district with a 
member of the Grateful Dead. That bit of trivia 
followed Tamarin throughout his career and 
earned him a new level of respect and admira-
tion from generation after generation of union 
staff. 
Tamarin’s activism and passion for working 
people (and his friend John Wilhelm) led him 
to get arrested at a demonstration in support 
of unionized workers at Yale University, which 
led to a lifetime of union work, service and ac-
tivism 
at 
UNITE 
HERE. 
Subsequently, 
Tamarin became UNITE HERE’s trouble-
shooter, with the union sending him to help 
struggling UNITE HERE locals in New Eng-
land, New Jersey, New York, and Chicago. 
When he arrived in Chicago, Tamarin faced 
his biggest challenge and found his greatest 
success when he transformed and revitalized 
UNITE HERE Local 1 by organizing a mem-
ber-driven and worker-led 2002 contract fight 
with 7,000 hotel workers that raised the wages 
of housekeepers from $8.83 to $10.17. 
Throughout his career, Tamarin mentored 
dozens of future labor leaders and activists, 
including Roushaunda Williams, vice president 
of the Illinois AFL–CIO Executive Board; 
Karen Kent, UNITE HERE Local 1’s president 
and 
Tamarin’s 
successor; 
and 
Jose 
Maldonado, president of UNITE HERE Local 
100 in New York City. Henry was indeed a 
‘‘Street Fighting Man’’ as David Moberg re-
ferred to him in his cover article published in 
the Chicago Tribune Magazine on February 
16, 2003. Tamarin led his local unions and 
membership through several strikes, including 
the Congress Hotel strike in Chicago, and the 
Box Tree Restaurant strike in New York City— 
two of the longest strikes in labor history. 
Henry’s passion for the struggle for workers’ 
rights was contagious, and his love and re-
spect for union members authentic. He pa-
tiently taught union members the power of 
strikes, how to defend their contracts, and the 
importance of keeping free speech alive. 
Tamarin was always ready to take the struggle 
to the next level. He was bold and tough, and 
a smart, colorful, and tenacious negotiator. 
When he stepped aside from union service 
in 2015, he stepped into a full life with family, 
friends and travel. He spent time with his 
grandchildren, and continued to organize the 
annual summer trip to Cape Cod with his fam-
ily. He enjoyed deep sea fishing, fly fishing, 
and dining out in his hometown. Henry was 
passionate about travel overseas and only this 
summer had traveled to the south of France. 
Henry leaves behind son Nate and his wife 
Elizabeth; son Nick and his wife Rhea; grand-
children Nicholas, Henry, and Elena; a sister, 
Jean Tamarin and thousands of UNITE HERE 
members, staff, and leaders, whose lives were 
made better because of his life’s work. 
Henry Tamarin will live forever in the hearts 
of his family, friends, and in the hearts of 
UNITE HERE Local 1 & UNITE HERE Local 
100, in UNITE HERE, and in the labor move-
ment.

HONORING THE 2022 WOMEN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Women of the Year. 
The honorees represent some of the most out-
standing and dedicated women in California’s 
3rd Congressional District. Nominated by their 
peers, these women are recognized for the in-
tegral and crucial roles they play in improving 
the lives of everyone in their communities. 
This year marks the 102nd anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, which guaranteed and pro-
tected women’s constitutional right to vote. In 
securing the right to vote, suffragists broke 
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier to 
women’s full and equal citizenship in our 
country, signaling a new era of equality. Yet, 
even today, women still face significant bar-
riers to their rights and liberties from pay dis-
crimination to criminalizing women’s reproduc-
tive rights. I take heart that each of this year’s 
honorees will be a vital part of the work left to 
be done to realize women’s full equality and 
rights. 
The 2022 Women of the Year are: 
Claire Arano is a positive force in her com-
munity who has a passion for helping others. 
For the past 20 years, she has served on the 
Orland Planning Commission, demonstrating 
an extraordinary commitment to her region. In 
her role, Claire successfully helped streamline 
the processes for business and license per-
mits and helped promote economic growth by 
recruiting new businesses and industries to 
the Orland area. As a volunteer in the commu-
nity, Claire works with one goal in mind: shap-
ing the best possible environment for her com-
munity. She has served as President of the 
Orland Chamber of Commerce, the Orland 
Rotary Club, and the Glenn Chorale. In each 
of these positions, she stood out as a leader 
and role model. As a Rotarian, Claire cham-
pioned scholarships for needy students, guid-
ed them to college, and helped many in secur-
ing their first jobs. As President of the Glenn 
Chorale, she established a college scholarship 
program for students who enrolled in a music 
course. Claire continually leads by example 
and puts the needs of others ahead of her 
own. She has a charitable heart and a com-
passionate disposition; she is a tremendous 
asset to the community. 
Jerrylean Baker is a dedicated community 
leader, strong advocate, and shining example 
of a true public servant. She is a proud senior 
citizen and lifelong member of the NAACP 
who advocates for civic engagement, address-
ing health and education disparities, and moni-
toring equal opportunity. Envisioning a society 
where all individuals enjoy life, she serves her 
community with unmatched passion and dedi-
cation. She consistently displays compassion 
and grace when volunteering in her commu-
nity and you will often find her organizing 
clothing and coat drives, packing sandwiches 
for the homeless, and preparing holiday 
meals. She is an incredible advocate on 
issues critical to seniors, fighting for better 
housing and reliable transportation. As a fierce 
advocate for education, Jerrylean devotes her-
self with unparalleled enthusiasm to students 
who have a desire to attend college. Through 
her work with the NAACP, she has been in-
strumental in raising funds for scholarships. 
Jerrylean’s hard work and dedication have en-
riched the lives of countless residents through-
out her community. Jerrylean is an inspiration 
to her family and her community, and she ex-
emplifies the qualities of a tremendous woman 
of compassion, courage, and faith. 
As co-founder of Sunrise Special Services 
Foundation, Annie Barnes has dedicated the 
past twenty years of her life to improving the 
quality of life for those in underserved commu-
nities. Her incredible journey began thirty 
years ago, having faced her own hardships 
while raising her young children, promising 
herself to one day give back by helping those 
in need. Pursuing her dream, she completed 
her college education and became an accom-
plished grant writer while developing programs 
for California Tribes and rural communities. 
Annie secured a position with the Office of 
Rural Health Policy as a Rural Fellow where 
she was recognized by UCLA as a national 
Healthcare Leader. Upon receiving her mas-
ter’s in clinical psychology from UCSF, she 
became an advocate for integrating western 
medical models with traditional healing prac-
tices for Tribal, Latino, and other communities 
of color. Annie’s accomplishments include se-
curing funding for the Inter-Tribal Council of 
California to train communities in violence pre-
vention models and developing programs for 
the prevention of diabetes II complications for 
the Lake County Tribal Health Consortium. 
Annie’s commitment to overcoming chal-
lenges, her positive impact on countless lives 
in her community, and her unwavering advo-
cacy for those in need make her an inspiration 
to all who know her. 
Diane Barney has made an extraordinary 
difference in her community through her ex-
tensive career in journalism and healthcare as 
well as her involvement in civic clubs and pub-
lic service. She has had an outstanding career

Vacaville Reporter, serving the northern So-
lano Community from 1984–2009. During her 
tenure, she focused on every facet of the 
community, reporting on schools, health, gov-
ernment, and social events as well as working 
to balance the role of a local newspaper in in-
forming the public and telling the stories of 
regular people living regular lives. She is now 
the editor of Wellspring, a free health edu-
cation publication that is delivered to 70,000 
Solano residents. Diane has also had direct 
involvement with a host of public initiatives, in-
cluding publicizing free immunization clinics

engaged in her community and is always will-
ing to lend a helping hand from MCing events 
to helping organize fundraisers around town. 
Camille currently works for Habitat for Human-
ity where her giving spirit and the endless en-
ergy she puts into projects serve as an inspi-
ration to both her colleagues and the Yuba- 
Sutter community at large. Camille has an 
amazingly positive attitude, but she also does 
not shy away from discussing life’s struggles, 
and by sharing her own stories and success in 
overcoming adversity, her authenticity and re-
silience inspire others to do the same. Camille 
treats everyone she meets with compassion 
and creates lasting connections with those she 
helps. Camille is the proud mother of three 
sons who have learned to share her same 
passion and dedication for community service. 
Barbara Bulkley is an active member of the 
Dixon community whose positive impact has 
been felt by many. Barbara has been an inte-
gral member of the Soroptimist International of 
Dixon for 31 years. She is a woman who 
works tirelessly behind the scenes to make 
everything run smoothly and successfully. She 
can be found cooking, handling event registra-
tion, setting or cleaning up events, and per-
sonally selling more than half of the Sorop-
timist raffle tickets herself. She is known 
throughout her community for her endless 
generosity, for years she has provided a 
Christmas tree lighting in the Dixon downtown 
area for the entire community. When the 
Dixon Soroptimists had exhausted their emer-
gency budget in helping a community member 
pay rent while they cared for their terminally ill 
child, Barbara stepped in to assist the woman 
with an additional three months of rent. When 
fires ravaged her county, she stepped up and 
donated bottled water to assist the firefighters 
and displaced families. All of these generous 
contributions were made behind the scenes 
while being an active owner of Bulkley Ranch 
with her late husband Bob. All who know Bar-
bara can attest to how much she loves her 
town and cares about helping others. There 
are countless women whose lives have been 
changed as a direct result of Barbara’s gen-
erosity. Her service to others and her commu-
nity is a shining example to everyone she 
meets. 
Dr. Debapriya Chakraborty is a dedicated 
public servant who puts her expertise to work 
creating sustainable and equitable public pol-
icy in her community. Since earning her Ph.D. 
in Economics from UC Irvine, Debapriya has 
led the policy team at the Plug-In Hybrid & 
Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. 
Her research focuses on policy issues related 
to electric vehicles, charging behavior, charg-
ing infrastructure integration, and the effects of 
transportation electrification policy on the en-
ergy market. Debapriya has an invaluable skill 
for bringing together aspects of her research 
into actionable outcomes for policymakers. 
Through her passion and expertise, she has 
been leading the fight against climate change 
by working to make transportation sustainable,

career professionals interested in pursuing a 
career in transportation. She has a passion for 
creating equity and sustainability through pub-
lic policy and is committed to finding a solution 
to one of the world’s most critical challenges. 
Sally Christie has a demonstrated passion 
and commitment to preserving the culture, his-
tory, and agricultural lands of the rich Delta 
community she lives in. Sally is on the advi-
sory committee of the Delta Education Vine-

ture. The work she has done educating future 
leaders will leave a lasting legacy, preserving 
and enhancing the spirit of this Delta commu-
nity. 
Rose Conroy spent her career as a fire-
fighter and has served as a role model for 
women beginning their careers as first re-
sponders and public servants. Rose first 
joined the Davis Fire Department in 1979, ris-
ing through the ranks to become Fire Chief in 
1994. At the time of her appointment, Rose 
became the first woman to lead a professional 
municipal fire department in the State of Cali-
fornia. She led the Davis Fire Department for 
the next 16 years, maintaining the highest 
standards of the profession and instituting in-
novations such as the customer service imme-
diate feedback reporting system after each 
call. As a highly visible woman in an occupa-
tion still dominated by men, her drive and de-
termination led her to break the glass ceiling 
almost 30 years ago. Although Rose retired in 
2010, her legacy lives on in the recent ele-
vation of another female Davis Fire Depart-
ment firefighter who, in February, was pro-
moted to the position of Battalion Chief. 
Rose’s early trailblazing role and her 30 years 
of service are memorialized in the California 
Firefighters Memorial statue in Capital Park, 
Sacramento, where her likeness is the only 
woman among the four firefighters depicted. 
Rose continues her unselfish community serv-
ice, serving as Board Vice President for 
Communicare Health Centers, providing health 
services to tens of thousands of low income 
Yolo County residents. She embraced her role 
as Fire Chief with passion and professionalism 
and continues to have a positive impact 
through her volunteer work. 
Roberta D’Arcy has dedicated her life to 
caring for others through her career as a 
nurse, leading various county health pro-
grams, and through her involvement in the 
community. Her nursing career began in the 
1960s when, at 23 years of age, she became 
Director of Nursing for Yuba County Hospital. 
She later spent seven years at Fremont Hos-
pital in Labor and Delivery while running var-
ious prenatal classes for expecting parents. 
Roberta later became the Detox Program 
Manager in Marysville from 1975 to 1979 and 
in 1980 was presented with the opportunity to 
become jail nurse for the Yuba County Jail. It 
was there that she recognized the severity of 
addiction and how it affected entire families. 
Roberta was instrumental in developing the 
First Steps program in Yuba City, which pro-
vides intensive day treatment services to sub-
stance-abusing mothers. She was also instru-
mental in co-founding the Fathers First pro-
gram in Yuba County, which remains a vital 
tool for fathers who are in recovery, newly out 
of incarceration, or simply in need of support 
in fathering skills. After retiring in 1999, Ro-
berta began work at Harmony Health Family 
Resource Center in Marysville and in later 
years worked in Homeless Services. Her work 
of assisting her community’s most vulnerable 
members has directly changed the lives of 
countless individuals and has made her an in-
dispensable part of the community. 
Anne Davis East has given her time volun-
teering for countless organizations in Yolo 
County and has worked tirelessly to improve 
the quality of life for those in her community 
and beyond. As an original member of the 
Board of Directors for Dinner on Main, Anne 
was instrumental in organizing the very first 
Farm to Fork dinner event in Woodland, high-
lighting the beauty, heritage, and agriculture of 
Yolo County. Additionally, Anne volunteers for 
the chamber of commerce where she’s served 
as a judge for the Holiday Parade and pro-
vided pro bono consulting services to re-es-
tablish the Woodland Downtown Group. As an 
integral member of the community, she also 
participated in the Woodland Redistricting Ad-
visory group. Anne has worked tirelessly to

gage families, helping organize the Big Day of 
Giving which benefited a local girls’ fast pitch 
softball team, working with her church and the 
Woodland Public Library to provide books to 
children, and arranging to have blankets dis-
tributed during the church’s Monday food pro-
gram. Anne’s selflessness is an inspiration to 
many within her community. She is a positive 
role model for children and adults alike, dem-
onstrating what it means to be a generous, 
caring, and passionate member of the commu-
nity. 
Erin Donley Marineau is a passionate leader 
in our community having served five years as 
the Executive Director of Tree Davis. A de-
voted environmentalist, Erin has dedicated 
herself to growing Yolo County’s urban forest 
and supporting the community. She largely ac-
complished her successes by engaging local 
volunteers, partnering with local municipalities, 
and securing the funding necessary to grow 
the urban forest throughout Yolo County. Dur-
ing her five years, Erin and her team of volun-
teers planted thousands of trees and logged in 
tens of thousands of hours of work. Some of 
her many accomplishments include spear-
heading the development of California’s first 
climate-ready landscape tree planting effort. 
This effort included identifying and adopting a 
palette of climate-resilient species of trees. To 
help ensure the adoption’s longevity, Erin col-
laborated with leadership to develop a new 
Climate-Ready Urban Forestry Education Pro-
gram for high school students throughout Yolo 
County that would promote healthier and bet-
ter-suited trees that could withstand the 
changing climate. When Erin found out this 
new program created a supply issue, she ne-
gotiated with horticultural nurseries throughout 
multiple western states to help ensure a 
steady supply of appropriate species and 
quantities for the coming planting season. Her 
knowledge, enthusiasm, and passion for the 
environment have made a lasting impact that 
will be felt in Yolo County and communities 
across the western United States for many 
years. 
Debbie Egidio is the president and CEO of 
the Vacaville Chamber of Commerce and 
serves as chairman of the chamber’s Edu-
cational Foundation. Her leadership has been 
responsible for developing and enhancing the 
success of the 450 businesses in Vacaville 
while attracting new business to the region. 
Debbie is also co-founder of DTS Egidio, a 
local marketing and public relations firm. Be-
fore starting her company, Debbie worked as 
Marketing Director at Triad Communities 
where she provided marketing and public out-
reach for several projects, including the La-
goon Valley Project and the rehabilitation of 
the historic Empress Theatre in downtown 
Vallejo, a $3 million redevelopment project 
that partnered Triad, the City of Vallejo, and 
the 
Vallejo 
Community 
Arts 
Foundation. 
Debbie is a graduate of UC Davis with a 
Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Mana-
gerial Economics and has put her expertise to 
use in many community and industry organiza-
tions throughout her career. Her outstanding 
career accomplishments and dedication to 
serving her community are an inspiration to 
aspiring leaders. 
I congratulate each of them and commend 
them for their work. I am inspired by them and 
firmly believe when women succeed, America 
succeeds. 
HONORING DR. NALO JOHNSON AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Nalo Johnson as Iowan of the 
Week. Dr. Nalo Johnson is a public health ex-
pert who works with community-based organi-
zations, public and private entities, and every-
day Iowans to improve health outcomes for all 
Iowans. 
While growing up in Des Moines, she 
learned firsthand how collaboration was key to 
addressing issues facing her community, and 
that lesson drives her work to this day. 
She got her start in public health while earn-
ing her Ph.D. in American Studies from the 
University of Minnesota, where she focused 
on learning about the economic, social, and 
environmental barriers to health. At the same 
time, her husband attended dental school and 
shared literature on public health issues that 
furthered her interest in the topic. After she 
concluded the program, she knew that her 
life’s mission was to break down those bar-
riers and create healthier communities. 
She later joined the Division Director of 
Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Pre-
vention at the Iowa Department of Public 
Health. There, she worked on the Title V 
Community-Based Doula Project for African 
American Families. This project included a col-
laborative team of Black maternal health ex-
perts that had 3 goals—to improve maternal 
health outcomes and decrease the disparity 
between Black mothers and white mothers, di-
versify the prenatal workforce by having doula 
and lactation certifications, and advocate for a 
systems change to use the program’s data for 
health 
insurance 
reimbursement—including 
Medicaid—for 
using 
doula 
services. 
The 
project is now concluding its first year of work. 
She now serves as the President and CEO 
of the Mid-Iowa Health Foundation, where she 
partners with leading organizations and stake-
holders to view public health challenges 
through an equity lens and tackle those same 
challenges in a culturally-competent and effec-
tive manner. 
Dr. Nalo Johnson says that one of the best 
parts of her job is building relationships with 
local leaders, funding partners, and public 
health systems to bring everyone to the table 
to address the unique needs of communities 
and is excited about the new resources avail-
able to do just that in her new role. 
She is grateful for the support of her fam-
ily—her husband and two children—for always 
being supportive and proud of the work she 
does. 
Dr. Nalo Johnson is a stellar example of 
someone who fights for ALL Iowans, regard-
less of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. 
Her work is critical to the well-being of Iowans, 
and I am so proud to honor Dr. Nalo Johnson 
as the Iowan of the Week. 
HONORING BOB KOVACHICK FOR 
HIS 
TREMENDOUS 
IMPACT 
ON 
THE CAPITAL REGION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bob Kovachick for his remark-
able career and well-deserved retirement from 
WNYT. Over his illustrious fifty-year career, 
Bob had a tremendous impact on all those 
who watched his meteorology reports across 
the Capital Region. 
In 1971, Bob graduated from Lyndon State 
College in Vermont where he received his de-
gree in meteorology. He then launched his ca-
reer at the Universal Weather Service in White 
Plains. After his time in White Plains, he went 
on to gain valuable experience at WTEN in Al-
bany and WTAE in Pittsburgh. 
In 1988, Bob joined WNYT’s First Warning 
weather team as the chief meteorologist for 
NewsChannel 13. This was the beginning of a 
long and rewarding relationship between Bob, 
WNYT, and the Capital Region. Over the 
years, Bob has become a familiar face and 
voice in the homes of many. His weather re-
ports on the nightly news have helped to keep 
families informed, prepared, and safe for dec-
ades. 
In addition to serving as WNYT’s chief me-
teorologist, Bob frequently spoke with various 
organizations on the intricacies of meteor-
ology. Bob prioritized educating and inspiring 
young students and would spend many days 
visiting schools in the Capital Region to dis-
cuss meteorology. Due to Bob’s dedication to 
producing high quality reports, he received the 
American Meteorological Society Seal of Ap-
proval in Television Weathercasting. He is 
also a professional member of both the Amer-
ican Meteorological Society and National 
Weather Association. 
Bob is a shining light in the field of meteor-
ology and serves as an inspiration to others in 
his field. He will be sorely missed on 
NewsChannel 13 broadcasts. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I am honored to con-
gratulate Bob for his monumental career at 
WNYT and thank him for making a lasting im-
pact on the Capital Region.

HONORING THE 2022 WOMEN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Women of the Year. 
The honorees represent some of the most out-
standing and dedicated women in California’s 
3rd Congressional District. Nominated by their 
peers, these women are recognized for the in-
tegral and crucial roles they play in improving 
the lives of everyone in their communities. 
This year marks the 102nd anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, which guaranteed and pro-
tected women’s constitutional right to vote. In 
securing the right to vote, suffragists broke 
through a seemingly impenetrable barrier to 
women’s full and equal citizenship in our

country, signaling a new era of equality. Yet, 
even still today, women still face significant 
barriers to their rights and liberties from pay 
discrimination to criminalizing women’s repro-
ductive rights. I take heart that each of this 
year’s honorees will be a vital part of the work 
left to be done to realize women’s full equality 
and rights. 
The 2022 Women of the Year are: 
Robin Tully is an accomplished business-
woman and dedicated community leader. She 
is the President and Owner of the Tully Con-
sulting Group, where she brings her civil engi-
neering expertise to bear throughout Northern 
California. Robin offers valuable knowledge of 
storm water hydrology, LEED sustainable site 
design, and environmental protection planning. 
Robin also serves as the Chair of the Dixon 
Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. 
Her involvement in the community stretches 
wide, from hosting holiday food drives for 
Dixon Family Services to participating in Toys 
for Tots and providing an annual STEM schol-
arship. Robin is an advocate and supporter of 
youth extracurricular activities for the commu-
nity, sponsoring multiple Dixon sporting teams 
and the Special Olympics event, and is herself

onstrating an extraordinary commitment to 
preserving the essence of life on the Delta. 
Following in her mother’s footsteps, Linda

the Sacramento River Delta’s history. Linda

spiritual character, honest reputation, and 
sound judgment, and serves as a Deacon, 
providing leadership in areas of stewardship 
and mission outreach. Linda is known through-
out the Delta region for the positive impacts 
she’s made, and Walnut Grove wouldn’t be 
the cherished community it is today without 
the contributions of her and her family. 
Chief Master Sergeant Jennifer Wampler 
entered the Air Force in 1993 and now serves 
as the Senior Enlisted Leader at David Grant 
Medical Center on Travis Airforce Base. She 
has served on bases across the country and 
South Korea and deployed in support of Joint 
Task Force Bravo, Operation New Dawn, and 
contingency operations in response to Hurri-
cane Maria. In her current position, she is the 
principal advisor to the commander on all mat-
ters impacting the more than 2,500 personnel 
assigned to David Grant Medical Center. She 
provides operational guidance to the squad-
rons delivering medical care and services to 
over 500,000 active-duty members, retirees, 
veterans, and their families. Her work is critical 
to ensuring David Grant provides safe and re-
liable care to 60th Air Mobility Wing personnel 
and their families. During the COVID–19 Omi-
cron surge, her operational direction was crit-
ical to combating the crisis. She also played a 
pivotal role in coordinating Travis AFB’s par-
ticipation in the FEMA COVID–19 response, 
supporting seven hospitals in California and 
across the nation, treating hundreds of pa-
tients, and contributing to the national pan-
demic response. An exceptional leader, Chief 
Wampler strives to inspire others through 
mentorship and advocacy. She fosters a cli-
mate of empowerment through knowledge by 
hosting leadership discussions, providing guid-
ance to enlisted leaders on mission concerns 
and career development opportunities, serving 
as a guest speaker for the First Tenn Airman’s 
course, and leading the Senior Enlisted Lead-
er Panel at the Non-Commissioned Officer 
Professional Enhancement Seminar. Chief 
Wampler serves her country with honor and 
distinction, and her major awards and decora-
tions include the Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the 
Joint Service Achievement Medal. 
Janice Wiseman is an active member of the 
Sacramento Delta region’s vibrant community. 
She has served her community in several dif-
ferent capacities, including as a Member of 
the Board for the Dr. Paul Barnes Community 
Park and the Jean Harvie Community Center 
as well as a volunteer with Delta Home Tours 
and countless other local organizations. Janice 
also served for over 30 years as a council 
member for her local Parks and Recreation 
department. While raising three children, she 
became actively involved with the school PTA 
and Boosters Club and through her local Ro-
tary Club, Janice opened her home to five for-
eign exchange students, providing them with 
tremendous opportunities to experience the 
culture of American life. Janice is a valued 
member of her community who continues to 
serve with dedication and enthusiasm. 
Kelly Zimmerman is a community advocate 
who goes above and beyond what is asked of 
her. In 2019, Kelly introduced and facilitated 
the newly chartered Soroptimist International 
of South Yuba whose mission is to transform 
the lives and status of women and girls 
through education, empowerment, and ena-
bling opportunities. Kelly also facilitates sev-
eral drives for the Hope Program, which en-
gages businesses to provide pajamas, socks, 
and shoes to families in need throughout Yuba 
County. She also uses her exceptional com-
munity organizing skills to bring about popular 
events such as the renaissance foundation, 
school fundraisers, the annual shred event, 
and many more. She also designs and runs 
the community calendar and puts together an 
annual Women in Real Estate event, bringing 
together over 100 women for a day of inspira-
tion, awards, and relationship-building. This 
past year, when Kelly became aware of a 
community member whose home had a col-
lapsing roof and unlivable conditions, she ral-
lied people together to help their neighbor get 
back in good health and moved into a new 
apartment with furnishings donated by the 
community. This is just one example of the 
way Kelly combines her compassion and drive 
to bring about positive outcomes. Kelly con-
tinuously demonstrates an outstanding com-
mitment to empowering women and serving 
those in need. 
I congratulate each of them and commend 
them for their work. I am inspired by them and 
firmly believe when women succeed, America 
succeeds.
