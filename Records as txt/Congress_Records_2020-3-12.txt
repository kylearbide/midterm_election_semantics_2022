DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable SUZAN K.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of mercy, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House today as they leave for a week of 
constituent visits in their home dis-
tricts. Protect them and all whom they 
encounter 
from 
the 
dangers 
of 
coronavirus infection, and help them to 
be of comfort and encouragement for 
people back home. 
Help them to withstand open criti-
cism when they know what is right be-
fore You and conscience. Often, they 
are characterized by half-truths and at-
tributed motives that are far beneath 
them. Uphold them at such times with 
personal integrity and compassion for 
those most in need. 
Continue to bless those who suffer 
with the virus infection and those 
whose labor is in treating this illness 
and finding effective cure. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

COMMEMORATING LEGACY OF 
HELEN FABELA CHAVEZ 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of International Wom-
en’s Day. 
Throughout our past, many men have 
been recognized for their impact on our 
society; however, it is extremely im-
portant that we recognize the many 
women who fueled social change. 
Helen Fabela Chavez was one of these 
women. 
Helen was born on January 21, 1928, 
in Brawley, California, a city in my 
district. Like many Chicano children 
in the early 20th century, Helen began 
working in the agricultural industry at 
the age of 7. 
After marrying Cesar Chavez in 1948, 
Helen left the workforce to take care of 
her husband and their eight children. 
However, after 10 years, Helen re-
turned to the workforce as the bread-
winner for the family while Cesar Cha-
vez began to establish the National 
Farm Workers Association. 
Helen and other Chicana members 
contributed greatly to the success of 
the union, and she later became the 
treasurer for what became the United 
Farm Workers. 
I want to honor Helen Fabela Chavez, 
a woman who both raised and finan-
cially supported her family while also 
changing history from the grassroots 
up. 
f 
HONORING JACK CAMPBELL 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life 
of Jack Campbell, former commander 
of the Indian Trail VFW Post 2423. 
Sadly, Jack passed away March 10, 
2020. 
At 19 years old and weighing 100 
pounds, Jack was too light to be draft-
ed, but ‘‘things changed,’’ in his words, 
and soon he was in Vietnam. 
Jack’s service to his country did not 
end abroad. Upon returning, he became

commander of VFW Post 2423, captain 
of the Honor Guard, and District 13 
commander for VFW North Carolina. 
Jack was a patriot who valued serv-
ice, the national anthem, and the 
American flag. 
Citizens of Indian Trail have lost a 
pillar of the community. 
May we all look to Mr. Campbell’s 
example: a life well lived, dedicated to 
our country and everything for which 
it stands. 
Jo and I send our thoughts and pray-
ers to his family and loved ones. 
f 
UNITING TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
this week, coronavirus impacted my 
north Jersey community in a heart-
breaking way. 
Our thoughts are with the loved ones 
of Bergen County resident John Bren-
nan, New Jersey’s first life lost from 
coronavirus. Mr. Brennan was a life-
time horse trainer, a fixture at Yon-
kers Raceway, and a remarkable indi-
vidual. 
As of this morning, New Jersey now 
has 22 other presumed positive cases, 
several in my district alone. 
North Jersey’s hospitals and front-
line medical professionals are working 
to contain the outbreak and keep our 
residents safe. I commend our counties 
and hospitals in New Jersey’s Fifth 
District—New Bridge, Valley, Atlantic, 
Hackensack 
Meridian, 
and 
Holy 
Name—for working so hard and work-
ing together and for holding daily calls 
to coordinate efforts to help combat 
the spread of the virus. 
This week, I led members of our con-
gressional delegation to ask the CDC 
when New Jersey should expect to re-
ceive confirmation of our pending pre-
sumed positive cases. We still have not 
received CDC confirmation of the tests 
that have been sent to the agency. 
I know the CDC is working diligently 
to fight this crisis, but gaps in testing 
confirmation hinder our ability to 
mitigate the spread. 
Now is the time for our country to 
come together—our great hospitals, 
the CDC, all levels of government—to 
ensure all Americans are safe. 
There is nothing partisan about this 
moment. We must, as a country and as 
government, come together to fight the 
coronavirus and keep our families safe. 
f 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BEST 
CHANCE 
TO 
MITIGATE 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
from the Oval Office, the President’s 
address 
to 
the 
Nation 
last 
night 
stressed how important decisive action 
is today and in the future to prevent 
the spread of the virus tomorrow. 
I commend the President for his lat-
est measures to keep the country safe 
and to provide for its continued pros-
perity. 
The travel ban from China proved to 
be a lifesaving choice for Americans, 
and I expect the European travel ban 
will provide a similar result and ability 
to hold off even worse results. 
Should 
the 
House 
vote 
on 
a 
coronavirus package today, I would 
like to remind my colleagues that our 
local governments are the best chance 
we have of attacking this virus head- 
on. 
The President has worked diligently 
to provide local public health officials 
the resources they need to mitigate the 
virus, including the rapid release of the 
funds from the emergency supple-
mental we passed last week. 
Our cities and towns know the risks 
that their citizens face the best, and 
Congress should be doing all it can to 
take proper action in aiding them and, 
most importantly, our American citi-
zens. 
f 
EXTEND CENSUS DUE TO 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
today, the Census begins to reach out 
to households across America. 
All communities across the country 
must be counted, particularly those 
that are hard-to-count communities. 
The Census is for everybody. How-
ever, due to the coronavirus pandemic, 
we now face difficult challenges for the 
Census. 
The Census must be extended an ad-
ditional 3 months so we can get an ac-
curate count. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Today we begin the census for fami-
lies across the country. But due to the 
coronavirus pandemic we are going to 
face 
grand 
obstacles. 
The 
Census 
should be extended for 3 months to en-
sure a precise count. 
Hoy comenzamos el conteo del censo 
para familias a trave´s del paı´s pero por 
la creciente epidemia del coronavirus 
vamos a tener grandes obsta´culos. El 
censo debe de ser extendido por tres 
meses para tener un conteo preciso. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York will provide a 
translation of his remarks to the 
Clerk. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KENT 
FOUNTAIN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Kent Fountain for being elected the 
National Cotton Council chairman for 
2020. 
Mr. Fountain is an excellent choice 
for this important role and knows the 
cotton industry inside and out. 
He is the president and CEO of 
Southeastern Gin and Peanut and has 
won 
numerous 
awards, 
including 
Southeastern Ginner of the Year in 
2001 and the Horace Hayden National 
Ginner of the Year in 2016. 
Additionally, Mr. Fountain works as 
the director of Cotton Council Inter-
national, which promotes American 
cotton abroad. 
With cotton being so critical to Geor-
gia’s economy, I am proud that we 
have someone from our State with so 
much expertise leading the national 
cotton industry. 
Kent, congratulations on your elec-
tion. Keep up the good work. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING NASA’S ARTEMIS 
PROGRAM 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to high-
light the NASA ‘‘be an astronaut’’ pro-
gram. 
For the first time in 4 years, NASA is 
accepting applications for a new class 
of astronauts. 
Space exploration is a rich piece of 
modern American history, and thanks 
to the new Artemis program, it will re-
main a part of our future. 
Artemis will send the first woman 
and another man to the South Pole of 
the Moon by 2024 and allow us to estab-
lish a permanent presence on the Moon 
by 2028. 
Our Nation’s astronauts help execute 
a bold vision for science and for explo-
ration. Aspiring astronauts have the 
opportunity to join NASA for this new 
chapter in space exploration. 
Applications 
are 
being 
accepted 
through 
March 
31 
at 
www.USAJOBS.com. U.S. citizens with 
a master’s degree in a STEM field, 2 
years of related experience, and a pass-
ing physical exam are eligible to apply. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all eli-
gible space lovers and travelers to 
apply for this incredible opportunity.

BILL PUTS INTERESTS OF ILLE-
GAL 
IMMIGRANTS 
BEFORE 
RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5518, 
the Access to Counsel Act. 
This bill would provide illegal immi-
grants the right to counsel imme-
diately upon crossing our sovereign 
border, and American taxpayers, by the 
way, would be picking up the tab. 
This legislation doesn’t address the 
humanitarian crisis at the border. It 
doesn’t help women and children being 
exploited by the drug cartels. It doesn’t

fix our broken immigration system. It 
doesn’t secure the border. It doesn’t 
give resources to our law enforcement 
to keep them safe and successful in 
doing that job. 
This bill puts the interests of illegal 
immigrants before the rights of Amer-
ican citizens. 
Furthermore, it will overwhelm an 
already broken court system, charging 
hundreds of millions of dollars to U.S. 
taxpayers, and provide nothing to pro-
tect our citizens and the safety of our 
communities.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
IRAN—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–107) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is 
to continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2020. 
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957 with respect to Iran and to 
maintain in force comprehensive sanc-
tions against Iran to respond to this 
threat.

S1713 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 2020 
No. 48 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, we rejoice that You 
still answer prayers. When we cry to 
You, You continue to be an ever- 
present help during seasons of trouble. 
Lord, we marvel at Your power as we 
rest confident in Your ability to ac-
complish Your purposes. Today, inspire 
our Senators to put their total trust in 
You. May they not fear anything that 
may assail them on every side. Help 
them to remember that there is none 
holy like You, and nothing can com-
pare to Your majesty and might. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
TILLIS). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa 
has had 14 presumptive positive cases 
of COVID–19. My staff and I remain in 
constant communication with Federal 
agencies to ensure that the Federal 
Government 
is 
properly 
managing 
emergency 
threats 
to 
the 
public 
health. I am also in regular touch with 
the Iowa Department of Public Health, 
which is meeting daily with its part-
ners to share information with all 
Iowans. 
While each day brings updates re-
garding COVID–19, what remains con-
stant are the prevention efforts that 
we have all heard about, and just to 
name a couple: washing your hands 
often and covering your cough. 
To find further updates and guidance 
about the COVID–19, please visit my 
website at grassley.senate.gov. 
f 
REMEMBERING BIJAN GHAISAR 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
another matter, in November of 2017, 
Bijan Ghaisar was shot and killed by 
two U.S. Park Police officers. That per-
son was unarmed and in his vehicle. 
The National Park Service oversees 
the U.S. Park Police and still hasn’t 
responded to a letter that Senator 
WARNER of Virginia and I wrote to the 
Park Service last November. 
Now, we all know that Park Service 
officials are very concerned about the 
cherry blossom season. They just had a 
press conference to announce the peak 
dates of this year’s cherry blossom sea-
son. Acting Director Vela needs to take 
his agency’s obligations to respond to 
Senator WARNER’s and my letter and 
other inquiries from Congress as seri-
ously as he takes the weather updates. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
morning, the Senate and House Ser-
geants at Arms announced the suspen-
sion of public tours and nonofficial ac-
cess to the Capitol Complex beginning 
at the close of business today and run-
ning through the end of March. Their 
decision was made in close consulta-
tion with the Attending Physician of 
the U.S. Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan. 
I support the decision of these non-
partisan officers. It follows new guid-
ance from the Washington, DC, Depart-
ment of Health encouraging that all 
nonessential mass gatherings of more 
than 1,000 people be postponed. The 
Capitol Complex welcomes many times 
that many visitors on a typical day, 
particularly at this time of year. 
Congress will continue to do our 
work. Offices will be able to welcome 
constituents and visitors for meetings 
and official business by appointment, 
but in deference to the experts and to 
protect the health of many Americans 
who travel to our Nation’s Capital, 
tourism and nonofficial access to the 
Capitol and the complex will be put on 
pause. 
This virus is challenging our Nation 
in ways that feel unfamiliar to us, but 
our great country is strong, we are 
equipped, and we have overcome far 
greater challenges before. I know the 
entire Congress will look forward to 
welcoming all Americans back to visit 
their beautiful Capitol as soon as pos-
sible. 
In the meantime, we continue to en-
courage everyone to follow the facts, 
listen to the experts, and take smart 
and calm precautions as appropriate. 
Every American can access up-to-date 
recommendations for their own per-
sonal 
circumstances 
at 
www.coronavirus.gov. 
Last night, President Trump ad-
dressed the Nation on the broader, on-
going effort to slow and mitigate the 
spread of the virus here on American 
soil. As I have noted before, the admin-
istration’s early proactive measures to 
repatriate U.S. citizens and restrict 
travel from China bought more time 
for public health professionals to pre-
pare our response, and the funding 
measure that Congress passed last 
week is sending an infusion of new 
funding 
into 
laboratory 
research, 
frontline medical care, and everything 
in between.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1714 
March 12, 2020 
With those critical steps already 
taken, this week brought a further op-
portunity to help communities and 
families face the economic effects of 
the virus spread. Unfortunately, it ap-
pears at this hour that the Speaker and 
House Democrats instead chose to 
produce an ideological wish list that 
was not tailored closely to the cir-
cumstances. One is reminded of the fa-
mous 
comment 
from 
President 
Obama’s first Chief of Staff: ‘‘You 
never want a serious crisis to go to 
waste.’’ Instead of focusing on imme-
diate relief to affected individuals, 
families, and businesses, the House 
Democrats chose to wander into var-
ious areas of policy that are barely re-
lated, if at all, to the issue before us. 
Instead of working within existing 
law and within existing systems to de-
liver targeted relief as officially and ef-
fectively as possible, the Speaker’s pro-
posal would stand up a needless thicket 
of new bureaucracy. They would task 
offices like the Social Security Admin-
istration with standing up brand-new 
bureaucracy that would delay the de-
livery of aid to those who need it. 
As currently drafted, the proposal ap-
pears to impose permanent unfunded 
mandates on businesses that could 
cause massive job losses and put thou-
sands of small businesses at risk. The 
administration was ready to collabo-
rate. The Senate was ready to seriously 
consider a compromise product, but it 
appears that over in the House, left-
wing political messaging may have 
taken priority over the needs of our 
country. 
Certainly, 
this 
is 
dis-
appointing. 
I 
want 
to 
commend 
Secretary 
Mnuchin for his efforts and his contin-
ued conversation. At a minimum, I 
hope that Senate Democrats will not 
block potential requests from our col-
leagues today to pass smaller, non-
controversial pieces of legislation right 
away that would bolster particular as-
pects of the fight against coronavirus. 
The good news is that our Nation’s 
economy remains strong. The Presi-
dent is continuing to take action him-
self. We just passed billions—billions— 
in urgent funding just last week, and 
the Senate will continue to stand ready 
and willing to work toward further bi-
cameral, bipartisan actions when the 
House Democrats decide to get serious. 
f 
USA FREEDOM REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on another matter, yesterday the 
House of Representatives did come to-
gether around a bipartisan agreement 
to renew some critical national secu-
rity tools. The USA FREEDOM Reau-
thorization Act of 2020 will reauthorize 
key authorities granted to intelligence 
and 
national 
security professionals 
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act. 
First and foremost, this means ensur-
ing that the men and women tasked 
with rooting out espionage and stop-
ping terrorist activity on U.S. soil are 
equipped with the powers they need to 
be successful. 
Today, the threats these profes-
sionals confront are as serious and di-
verse as ever. Terrorist groups con-
tinue to wish us harm. Major hostile 
powers like Russia and China remain 
committed to undermining the integ-
rity of American institutions, from our 
infrastructure to our elections. 
The targeted powers reauthorized by 
this legislation are a vital part of the 
efforts to protect American commu-
nities. That is a fact. It is a fact that 
has been reaffirmed time and again by 
Attorneys General and by the numer-
ous reauthorizations granted by Con-
gress. 
This time is no different. We can’t 
mistake the safety and security that 
FISA authorities have helped preserve 
for evidence that they are no longer 
needed. At the same time, we cannot 
mistake a vital process for a perfect 
one. The 2016 election showed us per-
fectly clearly that the authorities 
granted under FISA are in need of tar-
geted reforms to improve account-
ability. That was backed up by the 
findings of the Department of Justice 
inspector general. 
That is why this legislation contains 
a number of specific reforms to address 
the kinds of failures that embarrassed 
the system in 2016: more oversight over 
the practices of the FISA Court, more 
declassification and more compliance 
practices, higher level approval for cer-
tain sensitive applications, and more. 
Our responsibility here is twofold. We 
have to continue equipping our na-
tional security professionals and the 
intelligence community to anticipate, 
confront, and eliminate the threats 
facing our country, and we also have to 
respond to the failures of 2016 with real 
reforms that ensure the public trust is 
handled appropriately. 
This legislation, passed by a bipar-
tisan majority in the House and en-
dorsed 
by 
the 
Attorney 
General, 
strikes the right balance. I am con-
fident that it will pass the Senate as 
well. It is not a question of if this 
passes but when. 
I hope that our colleagues who may 
not choose to vote for this legislation 
will not deny this body the opportunity 
to renew these authorities today to 
prevent any lapse. I hope none of our 
colleagues choose to force these impor-
tant national security tools to tempo-
rarily lapse for the sake of making a 
political point, which will not change 
the outcome. In fact, I hope we can 
renew these authorities today. 
But if we cannot, if some of our col-
leagues choose to object, the lapse will 
only be temporary, similar to past 
short lapses between reauthorizations. 
These national security tools should 
not lapse. They do not need to lapse, 
and I hope none of our colleagues 
choose to unilaterally force them to 
lapse just for the sake of making a 
point. But at least it would only be 
temporary because this bill is going to 
pass, these authorities are getting re-
newed, and that is a great thing for the 
security of our Nation and the safety of 
the American people. I hope it can hap-
pen today.

S1715 
March 12, 2020 
both by the alarming . . . spread and 
severity, and . . . alarming levels of in-
action’’ by the nations of the world. 
Let me repeat that. They were ‘‘deep-
ly concerned both by the alarming lev-
els of spread and severity, and the 
alarming levels of inaction’’ by the na-
tions of the world. 
In my home State of New York, 
members of the National Guard arrived 
in New Rochelle this morning to clean 
institutions and deliver food to the 
more than 120 sick residents within the 
3-mile containment area. Here in the 
Capitol, public tours will be suspended, 
and by the end of the week, the Capitol 
Complex will be restricted to official 
business only. 
Today the House of Representatives 
will take up and pass several measures 
the Speaker and I called for earlier this 
week to alleviate the economic pain 
felt by American workers and families 
who are impacted by the coronavirus, 
including extension of paid sick leave, 
food security insurance, and an expan-
sion of unemployment insurance. The 
legislation will also provide much 
needed help to States like New York 
that are overburdened by Medicaid 
costs. By temporarily modifying the 
FMAP formula, it gives the States the 
flexibility and money they need to 
fight this problem. I have long fought 
for an increase in FMAP funding, and 
this is welcome and needed for New 
York. I am glad it is in the bill that 
Democrats in the House and Senate put 
together. 
Many of the policies I have men-
tioned have been enacted by other 
countries dealing with the coronavirus. 
The policies are targeted at workers 
and families who are directly impacted 
by the virus, which is exactly where 
the focus needs to be, not on bailing 
out oil and gas companies or the cruise 
industry or to regulating banks—some 
of the ideas under discussion at the 
White House, by all reports—but on 
helping the American people cope with 
the crisis. That is job No. 1. 
We can come back and pass addi-
tional targeted measures that deal 
with other economic problems at a 
later date, but in the immediacy of 
today, the policies the House will pass 
will provide much needed help to those 
who need help; it will provide signifi-
cant 
economic 
relief 
by 
pumping 
money into the economy; and it will 
provide some flexibility to the local-
ities, the States, and to the American 
people. The Senate should pass this bill 
immediately following the House, be-
fore the end of the day. 
I plead—I plead—with my Republican 
Senate colleagues to pass this bill now. 
It has been carefully thought out. Its 
programs are directly aimed at people. 
They are not ideological, and it is des-
perately needed to show the American 
people we can do things that actually 
benefit the people who are in trouble 
and actually help move the American 
economy. To not pass this bill today 
would be a dereliction of duty, and I 
plead with Senator MCCONNELL: Put 
the bill on the floor; let there be a 
vote. It will pass, in my judgment. Put 
the bill on the floor. Do not let this 
legislation that the House passed at a 
time of crisis be just another tomb-
stone in your legislative graveyard. 
Of course, the central problem re-
mains—contending with the spread of 
the coronavirus itself. Our testing re-
gime has been completely inadequate. 
We still lag far behind other countries 
in both the number and percentage of 
the population we are testing for the 
virus. There are still not enough kits 
distributed to hospitals and medical 
labs, and the results of those tests are 
not processed fast enough. From one 
end of the country to the other, those 
on the frontlines—whether they be 
healthcare workers, mayors, county 
executives, Governors—are crying out 
for more testing and more speed in 
bringing the results of the tests back 
immediately. 
The 
President 
didn’t 
mention it in his speech. 
I heard from the mayor of New Ro-
chelle, who is now overseeing a 3-mile 
containment area. I asked: What is the 
No. 1 thing you need? He said testing. 
He told me that one of the reasons the 
State of New York had to impose the 
containment area was that it couldn’t 
be determined who was safe to walk on 
the street and who wasn’t because of 
the lack of testing. If they had the 
test, they would know who had the 
virus. Those people could quarantine at 
home, and others could go out and 
about with their lives and shop in the 
stores, go down the streets, and go 
through their normal activities. The 
lack of testing has forced many in con-
tainment areas to quarantine them-
selves when they may not have the 
virus at all. 
The administration must expedite 
the approval of labs that are ready to 
provide testing. It must support the 
use of automatic testing to increase 
the speed and volume, and it must do a 
better job of communicating to hos-
pitals and localities about the number 
of testing kits available. The adminis-
tration needs to get a handle on this 
now. 
It has been well over a month since 
the first case of coronavirus was con-
firmed on our soil, and many places 
around the country were not able to 
test for the coronavirus with the nec-
essary capacity or speed. The most 
glaring emission in this administra-
tion’s long list of problems has been 
the way they approach the coronavirus 
and the lack of testing. We need it now. 
The failure of the administration to 
anticipate problems with testing has 
put us weeks and weeks behind. 
Last night, President Trump gave his 
national 
address 
about 
the 
coronavirus, and testing wasn’t in-
cluded. It was amazing to me. The No. 
1 problem was ignored. 
I 
welcomed 
that 
the 
President 
stressed the need for hygiene. He in-
structed Americans to stay home if 
they felt sick, something he questioned 
in the past. I was glad he is no longer 
calling this a hoax and, at least in his 
speech, not blaming the press or Demo-
crats or somebody else for the problem. 
Blame isn’t going to solve anything. 
Yet, sadly and regrettably, the Presi-
dent’s speech fell far short of what 
Americans needed to hear. The speech 
was almost robotic, lacking any empa-
thy. The President seemed to show lit-
tle concern for Americans impacted by 
the virus or for allies around the world 
fighting it. The President did not say 
how his administration will address the 
lack of coronavirus testing kits, nor 
did he call for a national emergency to 
free up Federal resources to fight the 
virus. Calling for a national emergency 
under the Stafford Act would free up 
lots of FEMA’s resources to help States 
and localities. Why he hasn’t done it is 
a mystery. We need him to do it, and 
do it now. 
So many of the President’s state-
ments in his speech were inaccurate 
and required no fewer than three cor-
rections by the White House in the 
hours after. The President was not 
clear or accurate in describing the ban 
on travel from Europe to the United 
States—that it did not apply to U.S. 
citizens or to cargo. The President’s 
claim that health insurers have agreed 
to 
‘‘waive 
all 
copayments 
for 
coronavirus treatment’’ was also, ap-
parently, inaccurate. At a time of cri-
sis, one would think that the President 
could give a speech that at least had 
the facts right, that there would be 
that care and focus. But, unfortu-
nately, it wasn’t so. 
I 
don’t 
bring 
this 
up 
to 
play 
‘‘gotcha.’’ It is very serious. There are 
many Americans who watched the 
President but may not have seen the 
White House correct his error-laden 
speech. As a result, many Americans 
got bad and confusing information. 
This is very, very unfortunate. At all 
times, but especially during a time of 
crisis, the President must be clear and 
accurate about his policies and guid-
ance. We need leadership that is steady 
and, above all else, competent. These 
weren’t off-the-cuff remarks. This was 
a prepared speech. 
In this moment, with lives in the bal-
ance, Americans must have confidence 
that their President knows what he is 
doing and knows what he is talking 
about. To his detriment and to the Na-
tion’s, sadly, President Trump failed to 
inspire that confidence last night. 
I had hoped the fact that the Presi-
dent delivered a national address was a 
sign that the administration was fi-
nally 
beginning 
to 
treat 
the 
coronavirus with the seriousness it 
needs. That is why it was so discour-
aging that only a few hours later, the 
President was back to his old tricks— 
attacking 
Democrats—when 
we 
all 
know that is not going to solve the 
problem and we all know it is a time to 
bring us together. 
Congress has already passed major 
emergency appropriations to ramp up 
our response to the virus. The Presi-
dent’s early number $2 billion was, for-
tunately, increased significantly by

House and Senate to $8.3 billion. Con-
gress is now working quickly and com-
petently on a second package. It should 
get the same quick response from our 
Republican Senators and pass. 
NOMINATION OF JAMES P. DANLY 
Madam President, today the Senate 
will vote on the nomination of James 
Danly to serve on the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. Less than a 
decade out of law school, Mr. Danly 
lacks the experience of past nominees, 
and it seems his major qualification is 
deep ties to the energy industry. The 
process behind his nomination has been 
extremely partisan and unfair to the 
Senate minority. 
I have tried to work with the Repub-
lican leader to pair Mr. Danly’s nomi-
nation with a Democratic nominee so 
that both would pass the Senate. That 
is what we have always done until 
Leader MCCONNELL
started his ways 
and President Trump became Presi-
dent. 
By law, FERC has seats reserved for 
both 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans. 
Democrats sent our recommendation 
for FERC to the White House over a 
year ago, long before the administra-
tion selected Danly. Yet while the 
White House sent Danly’s name to the 
Senate for confirmation, they have 
held the Democratic nominee and 
given no reason or explanation why. 
Rather than work with my office and 
the White House to fix this problem— 
as every other Republican leader has 
done—and maintain the process of pair-
ing nominees, which has always been 
the tradition whether Democrats or 
Republicans were in the majority, 
Leader MCCONNELL, in his very par-
tisan, pro-energy industry way, is mov-
ing forward with only the Republican 
nominee. 
Leader MCCONNELL has been in the 
minority before. He knows that the 
only way bipartisan boards and com-
missions across the Federal Govern-
ment are filled fairly with consider-
ations for both parties is through co-
operation. If the shoe were on the other 
foot, I am sure the Republican leader 
would be furious with the game the 
White House is playing with our nomi-
nees. 
Our preference would have been to 
clear Danly alongside our Democratic 
nominee, but now, for the sake of fair-
ness and parity, I urge my colleagues 
to vote against his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Alaska. 
NOMINATION OF JAMES P. DANLY 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor this morning to 
speak in support of the nomination of 
Mr. James Danly to serve on the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Mr. Danly has been nominated for the 
remainder of a term that runs through 
June 30, 2023, and for a seat that has 
been open now since former Chairman 
Kevin McIntyre tragically passed away 
from brain cancer about 14 months ago. 
For those who don’t follow the day- 
to-day of energy policy, FERC is an 
independent agency within the Depart-
ment of Energy. It regulates elec-
tricity, hydropower, natural gas, and 
oil pipeline industries. In my view, 
FERC is one of those very, very impor-
tant entities. FERC plays a critical 
role in keeping the lights on and ensur-
ing the delivery of reliable, safe, and 
affordable energy to America’s homes 
and businesses. 
Mr. Danly has an impressive aca-
demic and professional background. He 
is a veteran, having served two tours of 
duty with the Army in Iraq, where he 
received a Bronze Star and a Purple 
Heart, and played a key role in exe-
cuting counterinsurgency efforts dur-
ing the surge. 
After his career with the Army, Mr. 
Danly chose to pursue a very different 
career as a FERC attorney, first prac-
ticing at a major law firm and most re-
cently serving as FERC’s general coun-
sel for the past 21⁄2 years now. 
Mr. Danly’s time at the FERC has 
been very productive. He has my strong 
support to be a Commissioner. This is 
the type of individual who knows his 
stuff, who has a great grasp and a keen 
understanding of these energy-related 
matters. He is well qualified and has a 
deep understanding of the issues that 
will come before him. He understands 
FERC’s mission as an independent and 
an impartial regulator. 
Despite Mr. Danly’s very impressive 
qualifications and experience, I am dis-
appointed that some of my colleagues 
have indicated they will oppose his 
nomination simply because he isn’t 
nominated alongside a Democratic can-
didate. So they will acknowledge that 
he has strong qualifications, that he 
has the expertise and the experience, 
but they are opposing him because 
they are saying he needs to be nomi-
nated alongside a Democrat. To me, op-
posing nominees on that basis alone is 
very troubling. 
It is also incorrect to characterize 
pairing FERC nominees as the norm. I 
think Members should recognize that 
FERC is set up first and foremost to 
avoid the need for pairings. We passed 
a law in Congress in 1990 to stagger the 
five Commissioners’ terms by 1 year 
each. So if nominees are sent to the 
Senate in a timely manner and stay in 
office, we would never need to pair 
them. 
Also contrary to what some have 
suggested, bipartisan pairings are not 
actually the norm. More often, we have 
confirmed individual Commissioners or 
had unbalanced pairings, like Colette 
Honorable in 2014 or the two Repub-
lican Commissioners we confirmed in 
2017 after the Obama administration 
refused to nominate any Republicans 
in 2015 or 2016. 
I also encourage the Senate to recog-
nize that this seat has already been 
paired. In 2017, we paired Mr. McIntyre 
with Rich Glick, who will continue to 
serve through mid-2022. The slot we are 
now considering is to fill the remainder 
of Mr. McIntyre’s term through mid- 
2023. 
The fact is, we have one nomination 
for the Senate right now, not two. We 
have one nomination to consider, and 
this position has been open now for 
some 14 months. It is not fair to tell a 
qualified Republican nominee that he 
has to wait, especially with the seat 
now having been open for more than 1 
year and the term expiring in mid-2023. 
That doesn’t change. 
I would also remind my colleagues 
that nominations are the responsibility 
of the President. It is not on me as the 
chairman of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. It is not on 
Leader MCCONNELL. It is the responsi-
bility of the President. 
The much more recent Democratic 
vacancy at FERC, which was the 
choice of the Democratic leadership in 
this body, is for the Democratic leader-
ship to work out with the White House. 
Send to the White House that nominee 
who can be advanced. 
For those who are concerned about 
the Democratic vacancy, I will share 
this with you. There will be an oppor-
tunity for a pairing later this year. 
Commissioner McNamee has already 
announced that he will not return to 
the FERC for a second term, so there 
will be a vacancy in just a matter of 
months. I have encouraged the admin-
istration to send us both nominees at 
the same time so that the Senate can 
restore FERC to a full complement of 
five Commissioners. We give them a lot 
of work. There is a lot of responsi-
bility. They need a full complement. 
Right now, our opportunity is to con-
firm Mr. Danly. That is who we have in 
front of us. He is the only FERC nomi-
nee we have. He is well qualified for the 
job. He served our country in uniform. 
He now wishes to continue that service 
in a different capacity, and I hope—I 
hope—no one will vote against him on 
party grounds. So I would certainly 
urge the full Senate to support Mr. 
Danly’s nomination. 
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from Alaska. 
ASHLEY JOHNSON-BARR DAY 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the 
Alaska State Senate yesterday passed 
a bill that would establish March 12, 
today, as Ashley Johnson-Barr Day to 
be held each year. 
Ashley Johnson-Barr was a 10-year- 
old beautiful little girl in Kotzebue, 
AK. Ashley was probably one of those 
happy kids who loved purple; thus, I 
have a purple scarf and purple jacket 
today. She was one of those beautiful 
young children growing up in Kotzebue 
who would have gone on to have a 
good, productive life in an Inupiat 
community in the northwestern part of 
the State. But Ashley Johnson-Barr is 
remembered now because, at the age of 
10 years old, she was brutally raped and 
murdered. She was literally taken from 
the kids’ playground there in Kotzebue 
and taken to a location not too many 
miles outside the community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1717 
March 12, 2020 
Her death, the tragedy around the 
circumstance of how she left this 
world, is one that is an open and raw 
and hurtful and horrific scar on Alaska 
and on the communities. It is a re-
minder that in my State—a place of ex-
traordinary beauty, with beautiful peo-
ple—there is a darkness that is very, 
very difficult to talk about. That dark-
ness is reflected in the statistics that 
we see when it comes to sexual assault, 
domestic violence, and more brutal 
acts of murder inflicted, unfortunately, 
in a disproportionate way on our Na-
tive women and our Native children. 
Yesterday in the Senate, we passed 
two measures that I have been working 
on for a period of time. Savanna’s Act 
is 
legislation 
that 
was 
initially 
brought about through the good work 
of my friend, the former Senator from 
North 
Dakota, 
Senator 
Heidi 
Heitkamp. Heidi and I worked on Sa-
vanna’s Act for a period of time. It is 
designed 
to 
improve 
coordination 
among all levels of law enforcement; 
increase data collection and informa-
tion sharing; and empower Tribal gov-
ernments with access to necessary law 
enforcement databases in cases involv-
ing missing and murdered indigenous 
women and girls wherever they occur, 
whether they are in a small, remote 
village or in our population centers. 
Savanna’s law was passed through 
the Senate in the last Congress and got 
stalled out in the House. So I took this 
back up, along with the help of my 
friend from the State of Nevada, Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO. Working with her, 
we have now been successful in moving 
it through the Senate. It traveled with 
another measure—a bill that was spon-
sored by Senator CORTEZ MASTO and 
cosponsored by me. 
The Not Invisible Act improves the 
engagement amongst law enforcement 
Tribal leaders, Federal partners, and 
service providers. We also designate an 
official to coordinate efforts across 
agencies in establishing a Tribal and 
Federal stakeholders’ effort to make 
recommendations to the Department of 
the Interior Department of Justice on 
how we deal with this, how we combat 
this epidemic of disappearance, of 
homicide, violent crimes, and traf-
ficking of Native Americans and Alas-
ka Natives. This is something we have 
been trying to shine the spotlight on. 
We are making significant progress 
and headway in Alaska. Thanks to the 
efforts and the heart of Attorney Gen-
eral Barr, we have seen Federal funds 
come our way. We have seen commis-
sions and a coordination among stake-
holders that is truly unprecedented, 
but we have much, much, much work 
to do. 
On this day, when in Alaska, we are 
recognizing the very short life of a 
beautiful child, Ashley Johnson-Barr. I 
thank my colleagues for working with 
us on these matters—helping us move 
Savanna’s Act and the Not Invisible 
Act—and working together to do more 
as we deal with those who are traf-
ficked, those who are assaulted, and 
those who are violently murdered in 
their homes and in their hometowns. 
We have much work to do, but we have 
good coordination and good coopera-
tion moving forward. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AMERICAN ENERGY INNOVATION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
week, I introduced an amendment to 
the American Energy Innovation Act. 
My amendment addresses a critical 
shortcoming with whistleblower pro-
tections currently available to power 
sector employees and those who are re-
sponsible for maintaining and securing 
our Nation’s electric grid. 
For those who are unfamiliar, the 
electric grid is managed by a patch-
work of public and private entities. Un-
fortunately, that means patchy cov-
erage for energy sector employees 
under our current whistleblower pro-
tection laws. Federal workers are cov-
ered under the Whistleblower Protec-
tion Act, but other workers have to 
rely on State and local laws for protec-
tion if they exist. 
For many on the frontlines, these 
whistleblower protection laws don’t 
exist. Just last year, according to a 
news report, power company employees 
raised concerns about equipment intro-
duced to improve efficiency that they 
believed posed a threat to starting 
wildfires. I hope we all remember the 
fires in California—I think 1 and 2 
years ago or 2 and 3 years ago—with 
terrible destruction, terrible loss of 
life. Eighty-five people in California, I 
think, lost their lives because of that 
type of fire. 
One of these employees raised his 
concern about the threat of this equip-
ment starting wildfires. It was reported 
that he was fired for simply blowing 
the whistle. If it turns out the em-
ployee was fired for blowing the whis-
tle in the interest of public safety, that 
should be unacceptable to all of us. 
As a country, we should be encour-
aging whistleblowers who know of 
threats to the security of our electric 
grid to come forward and report what 
they know. We owe it to them to en-
sure that when they do, they will be

protected—in other words, not lose 
their job. Isn’t that common sense? 
That is exactly what my amendment 
does. My amendment makes it clear 
that power sector employees who re-
port threats to our electric grid are 
protected from retaliation; if they are 
fired, they can file a complaint with 
the U.S. Secretary of Labor. In that re-
gard, this amendment brings whistle-
blower protections for energy sector 
employees in line with more than a 
dozen other whistleblower laws estab-
lished by the Congress in recent years. 
I have been involved in a lot of those 
whistleblower protection laws. 
Next week is Sunshine Week—a time 
when we celebrate the importance of 
transparency and accountability in 
government. With transparency, you 
get accountability, and the public’s 
business ought to be public. The pro-
tection of our citizens from forest fires 
that are a result of bad equipment that 
electric companies are using—if you re-
port unsafe conditions, you shouldn’t 
be fired for it. 
When we think about securing our 
electric 
grid, 
sunlight 
and 
trans-
parency bring accountability, but they 
also bring attention to potential risks 
to our public safety and to our national 
security. They can potentially save 
lives. That is something I am certain 
we can all get behind and should be be-
hind. 
I am very thankful to Senator MAR-
KEY for cosponsoring the amendment 
and for his support of this amendment. 
I strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment as 
well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
SECURING AMERICA’S MEDICINE CABINET ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, on 
Tuesday, my colleague Senator MENEN-
DEZ
and I introduced the Securing 
America’s Medicine Cabinet—or SAM-C 
Act—to 
encourage 
an 
increase 
in 
American 
manufacturing 
of 
active 
pharmaceutical ingredients. These are 
termed APIs. 
We did this because China dominates 
this portion of the pharmaceutical 
manufacturing and given last night’s 
news, I wanted to come back for a mo-
ment and highlight the important 
work that is being done in Tennessee 
and across the country to support our 
Nation’s response to this coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Many Americans are very concerned, 
as they ought to be, about the avail-
ability of testing. As you all know, this 
virus is novel, which means we did not 
have test kits on the shelves before the 
outbreak started. The tests that we do 
have are not instant. When people 
think of an instant test, they think of 
a flu test or a pregnancy test. The test 
that is required for this virus is not an 
instant test, but this is in the works, 
and we do have top scientists at Van-
derbilt University and other institu-
tions who are developing faster tech-
niques, but, for now, any test offered 
must be sent to a lab to be processed 
and analyzed. Although these tests pro-
vide important information, we must 
continue to focus on preventing trans-
mission where we can. 
Some of the other work that is being 
done will help lead us to a faster path 
for antivirals and for vaccines. There is 
work in East Tennessee, right outside 
of Knoxville, at the Oak Ridge Na-
tional Lab. Researchers have been 
using cutting-edge technology to iden-
tify drug candidates for targeting the 
novel coronavirus. They are using 
Summit, which is the world’s fastest 
supercomputer. What they have done is 
feed 
in 
information 
about 
the 
coronaviruses, 
MRSA, 
SARS, 
and 
H1N1—the different viruses—and they 
crunched it down, and they have iden-
tified 77 drug candidates for targeting 
the novel coronavirus that we know is 
COVID–19. Enabled by the screening of 
this database of more than 8,000 known 
drug compounds, the researchers ac-
complished in days what would have 
taken years for scientists to do in the 
lab. 
In my remarks on the floor yester-
day, I went into detail about the dec-
ades-long effort by scientists at Van-
derbilt University’s Denison Lab to 
study coronaviruses. I want to reit-
erate one important point—that all 
across the country, scientists just like 
our friends at Vanderbilt are devel-
oping the antivirals and the vaccines 
that will eventually be used to combat 
multiple strains of virus, not just this 
particular outbreak but in addition to 
this outbreak. 
The United States is a leader in re-
search and development of pharma-
ceuticals. Our labs, talent, and capac-
ity for innovation are the envy of the 
world, but right now we depend heavily 
on Chinese and foreign companies to 
manufacture active pharmaceutical in-
gredients. When this happens, we lose 
control of our supply. 
So while we have all of this great 
work done in Oak Ridge, TN, and we 
have this wonderful work done in the 
Denison Lab at Vanderbilt, we need 
something like the SAM-C Act to en-
able us to have access to these drugs 
and these compounds that they are 
identifying that we need. The SAM-C 
Act will not solve our immediate prob-
lem. Once passed, it will incentivize 
companies that specialize in develop-
ment, manufacturing, and workforce 
training to bring those operations back 
to the safety of U.S.-based labs and in-
stitutes of learning, and it will expe-
dite having the antivirals and the vac-
cines that are needed to prevent this. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
think ahead, offer their support to S. 
3432, and let’s commit to securing our 
pharmaceutical supply chain. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
COASTAL ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would like to talk for a few minutes 
today about my favorite subject, which 
is Louisiana. 
I could talk the rest of the day and 
through the entire weekend about the 
good things about Louisiana, but today 
I want to talk about one of our prob-
lems. It is not just a problem for Lou-
isiana; it is also a problem for the 
United States of America; it is also a 
problem for the American people; it is 
also a problem for energy independence 
for our country. Louisiana is drowning. 
It is drowning because we are washing 
away. Our land is washing into the 
gulf. 
I live about 250, 300 miles north of the 
Gulf of Mexico—sort of in the toe of 
the boot, if you think of Louisiana as a 
boot. If things continue as they are 
going, I may not be alive then, but my 
home—whoever lives in it after I am 
gone—will be gulf front property. Re-
member, my home is 250 to 300 miles 
from the coast. 
Why is that happening? Why is our 
land washing away into the gulf? There 
are a number of reasons. I will mention 
two, in particular. The sea levels in the 
Gulf of Mexico are rising. We can have 
a rigorous debate about the reason for 
that, and I know many smart people 
think it is for this reason and others 
disagree and think it is for that reason, 
but we can’t deny the fact that sea lev-
els are rising whatever the cause. In 
fact, as the gulf meets the southern 
part of my State, it is rising about 12 
to 13 inches every 100 years. 
We have another reason, though, as 
to why my State is washing away—our 
land in southern Louisiana is sinking. 
Why is that? 
The Mississippi Delta, of which Lou-
isiana is a part, is an ecological and 
hydrodynamic masterpiece. What God 
did in creating our State is just breath-
taking. It used to be the Mississippi 
River, which runs right through my 
State, would overflow every year. It 
would deposit its sediment in South 
Louisiana. The water would recede and 
go back into the river channel, but the 
sediment would remain. After thou-
sands and thousands of years, the land 
was built up. Then we leveed the Mis-
sissippi River. I am not saying we did 
the wrong thing by leveeing the Mis-
sissippi River, for we have increased 
the quality of life for a lot of Ameri-
cans and enhanced our economy. When 
we leveed the river, we prevented it 
from overflowing so that it would no

longer deposit sediment, but the sedi-
ment that was already there before we 
leveed the river was slowly sinking. So 
we have sea levels in the gulf rising 12 
to 13 inches every 100 years, and we 
have the land sinking. You don’t have 
to be a senior at Cal Tech to figure out 
we have a problem. That is why our 
land is washing away. 
Now, why is this important? 
It is obviously important for the peo-
ple who live on the land that is wash-
ing away, but it is also important for 
America’s 
energy 
independence 
be-
cause underneath the land that is slow-
ly being washed into the gulf—criss-
crossing that land and extending over 
into Texas and into Alabama—are 
26,000 miles of pipelines that carry oil 
and natural gas that heat American 
homes and generate American energy. 
When that land washes away, those 
pipelines are going to be exposed. 
Do you know what the saltwater is 
going to do to those pipelines? 
It is going to corrode them. When 
that land washes away, those pipelines 
now exposed are going to be exposed to 
ocean currents, and they are going to 
burst. It will not be all at once, but 
they are going to burst, and this coun-
try’s energy independence is going to 
be undermined. 
Do you know how long and how much 
money it will take to move those pipe-
lines? 
I don’t know. I am not sure if there 
are enough ditches to quantify it. 
Let me shift gears and talk about the 
solution as I think I have defined the 
problem. 
We are helping ourselves, and I will 
give you an example. The Morganza to 
the Gulf project doesn’t mean a lot to 
some of you, but trust me—it is a big 
deal to the people of Louisiana and to 
the American people who are familiar 
with it. We have been taxing ourselves 
for 20 years to pay for that project, 
which is part coastal restoration and 
part hurricane protection. We also re-
ceived help from the American people. 
Thank you. Thank you, American 
people, for coming to our aid. 
In 2006, the U.S. Congress passed 
what we call GOMESA. It stands for 
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security 
Act. That is what I mean when I talk 
about GOMESA, and GOMESA is a 
pretty straightforward bill. It says 
that, for all new oil and gas drilling in 
the Gulf of Mexico, the Federal Gov-
ernment and the State government are 
going to share the oil royalties. 
The government, as you know, owns 
the seabeds. We lease them to oil com-
panies, and they drill and produce oil 
and natural gas. In fact, off of Louisi-
ana’s coast, we have wells that produce 
about 16, 17 percent of the Nation’s oil 
and about 3 percent of the natural gas. 
Those oil companies pay royalties to 
the Federal Government, and the roy-
alties flow through the Federal Gov-
ernment to the State government. 
Under GOMESA, the American peo-
ple, 
through 
their 
representatives, 
said: OK. On all new wells that are 
drilled after 2006, Louisiana gets 37.5 
percent of the money that the Federal 
Government gets—but not just Lou-
isiana. We didn’t want to be greedy. We 
asked to have Texas included. We 
asked to have Mississippi included. We 
also asked to have Alabama included so 
it would get 37.5 percent too. Fair is 
fair. The Federal Government gets the 
rest. 
Louisianans have put their money 
where their mouths are. We have dedi-
cated every single penny of that 
GOMESA money to coastal restoration 
in order to try to build up our land 
faster than we have been losing our 
land to the gulf. It has been a losing 
battle, but we have been holding our 
own. To give you an idea of how dra-
matic it has been, since 1930—I think 
1932—Louisiana has lost land the size 
of Delaware. I believe, if you run the 
numbers in terms of square miles, we 
have lost land the size of two Rhode Is-
lands. I think we have lost a football 
field a day. Remember, this doesn’t 
just hurt Louisiana. This hurts Amer-
ica, and it hurts our energy independ-
ence. 
Louisiana has put its money where 
its mouth is. We said: Thank you, 
American people, for passing GOMESA. 
We appreciate the 37.5 percent of the 
oil royalties we are going to get out of 
the Federal Government’s share, and 
we are putting every single penny into 
coastal restoration. 
There is still a basic unfairness be-
cause 20 other States get 50 percent. 
Now, 
these 
States 
aren’t 
coastal 
States. I am happy for them. Don’t 
misunderstand me. These are inland 
States that have Federal lands. When 
oil companies drill on those Federal 
lands and hit oil or hit natural gas, 
those States don’t get 37.5 percent of 
what the Federal Government gets; 
they get 50 percent. That is just not 
fair. Everybody ought to be treated the 
same. Louisiana and Alabama and Mis-
sissippi and Texas are not asking for 
any extra. We call that lagniappe in 
Louisiana. We aren’t asking for any 
extra. We are just asking to be treated 
like everybody else. In Louisiana, we 
are dedicating every single penny—I 
don’t know if I mentioned this or not— 
to solving the coastal restoration prob-
lem, which is not just Louisiana’s prob-
lem but is a problem for the United 
States. 
We have a bill. It is called the 
COASTAL Act. The full name is the 
Conservation of America’s Shoreline 
Terrain and Aquatic Life Act. We call 
it the COASTAL Act. All the COAST-
AL Act would do would be to treat all 
the States the same. Everybody would 
get 50 percent—a 50–50 split. Louisiana 
wouldn’t get more or less than any 
other State. Alabama wouldn’t get 
more or less than any other State. Mis-
sissippi wouldn’t get more or less than 
any other State. Texas would be under 
the same rule. All of the States would 
get 50 percent. 
It would also make one other change. 
When GOMESA was passed, it capped 
the amount of money that Louisiana 
and Mississippi and Alabama and Texas 
could get each year from that 37.5 per-
cent at $500 million a year. Out of basic 
fairness, we are asking that the cap be 
removed if we can pass this bill, the 
COASTAL Act. The quarterback of the 
bill is the senior Senator from Lou-
isiana, Dr. BILL CASSIDY. I am helping 
him all I can as are the Senators from 
Texas and Mississippi and Alabama and 
other States. All we are asking is for 
equality. 
I don’t want to end on a negative 
note by just talking about our prob-
lems. If you haven’t visited Louisiana, 
please come. I have lived in five States 
and a foreign country. I have just never 
lived in a place like Louisiana. It is my 
home, and I know I am biased. God 
blessed 
our 
State, 
and 
in 
having 
blessed us, I think God blessed us a sec-
ond time. 
I mean, look at our location. We are 
at the top of the gulf coast; we are in 
the middle of the Gulf South; we strad-
dle one of the mightiest rivers in the 
entire world. We have more oil and gas 
than most nations do, which we share 
with the American people. My people 
are experts in things like agriculture, 
aquaculture, 
shipbuilding, 
petro-
chemical manufacturing, oil and gas 
exploration, food, timber, healthcare. I 
could keep going. Our people are hard- 
working, God-fearing, and fun-loving. 
I tell my friends Senator CRUZ and 
Senator CORNYN all the time how much 
I love Texas—and I do. Gosh, Texas is a 
great State. Every day, it seems like it 
wins an award. Yet I tell Senator CRUZ 
and 
Senator 
CORNYN—in 
jest, 
of 
course—look, Texas is 51⁄2 times bigger 
than Louisiana, but give us credit as 
we are 101⁄2 times more interesting than 
you are. 
We are just a fun, extraordinary, di-

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Presi-

after chance to get ahead of this 
coronavirus pandemic in the United 
States. He failed. Congress can’t make 
the same mistakes. 
Senators should not leave town. I 
just saw Senator MCCONNELL on the 
floor. It is his decision. One Senator 
from one State can make this decision 
to walk away—to fail to take care of 
the $12-an-hour worker who is sick, 
who has to choose between going to 
work—perhaps getting sicker or per-
haps infecting others—or staying home

and giving up her $12-an-hour, $96-a- 
day job when she struggles with her 
rent. We have put her in that position. 
Senator MCCONNELL, who was stand-
ing right there—his office is just down 
the hall—could make that unilateral 
decision as to whether we stay and ac-
tually do the right thing. The Senate 
has no business leaving. We shouldn’t 
leave town until we pass the House 
package to help workers and to support 
our communities. 
President Trump needs to sign it. We 
need to do our jobs. We need to take 
care of workers who are going to need 
help paying their mortgage, paying 
their rent, and taking care of their 
children if schools close or they get 
sick. 
It is really, really simple. It is why 
we need to pass paid sick days now and 
to shore up unemployment insurance 
funds immediately. 
We know that hundreds of thou-
sands—who knows?—millions of people 
are going to get laid off in the airlines, 
in restaurants, in hotels, in commu-
nities where they depend on these busi-
nesses to pay property tax. We know 
there are going to be lots of layoffs. 
I am not an alarmist. I am not pan-
icky. I think we are going to deal with 
this right. But we need the majority 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, who sits 
right here and runs the Senate, who 
makes the decisions on whether we 
work or don’t work, whether he sends 
us home or keeps us here working— 
Senator MCCONNELL needs to make the 
decision to keep us here, and as soon as 
the House passes this bill, the Senate 
takes it up. 
Paid sick days are one of the most 
important things we can do to stop the 
spread of this virus. We already know 
that our economy is going to get hurt. 
We know the President of the United 
States judges the economy by the 
stock market. He is the first President 
I have ever seen do that, but that is be-
side the point. We also know that the 
stock market is up and down and most-
ly down, and investors are uneasy at 
best. They want more predictability, 
and they are not getting it. But we 
know the most important thing is to 
deal 
with 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
coronavirus. If we can’t contain that, if 
we can’t do anything about that, if we 
can’t stop the spread of this virus, the 
other stuff just doesn’t matter as 
much. 
You start with the spread of this 
virus. The best way to stop the spread 
of the virus is to say to people if they 
are sick: You can stay home, and you 
can get sick pay. Every other rich 
country in the world provides sick pay 
for people who can’t go to work be-
cause they are sick. It is as simple as 
that. If we don’t pass the sick day pol-
icy, if we leave town right now, even if 
we come back next week, which we are 
not 
scheduled 
to—again, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s decision—even if we are 
only gone a week, that is 5 more work-
days of sick people going to work when 
they shouldn’t, getting sicker, infect-
ing others with coronavirus or the flu 
or anything else, or staying home and 
giving up their pay, which they need to 
meet their rent payment. The House 
package takes care of this. Senators 
shouldn’t be leaving this building until 
we get this help to the people we serve. 
People in Ohio and people in Indiana, 
in the Presiding Officer’s State, are 
scared. They are angry, and I am 
angry. 
Many of us have been sounding the 
alarm for years, warning President 
Trump and Leader MCCONNELL, who al-
ways does President Trump’s bidding, 
as if he doesn’t even represent a 
State—he represents the President in 
this body—that the President has made 
us less prepared to handle a crisis like 
this one. 
President Trump tried to gut the 
Centers for Disease Control and the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. 
Think about this: The United States 
of America, as recently as 10 or 15 
years ago, had the best public health 
infrastructure, the best public health 
safety net in the history of the world. 
We have the Centers for Disease Con-
trol. We have the National Institutes of 
Health. 
In Cincinnati, we have the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health—the only one of its kind in the 
world—and we have our county public 
health departments in each of Ohio’s 88 
counties and all over the country. 
We had the best in the world until 
President Trump began to try to gut 
the CDC and the NIH. He refused to fill 
key public health positions. 
Most importantly—this is just unbe-
lievable when you think about it, and I 
know Senator YOUNG, the Presiding Of-
ficer, had concerns about that—he got 
rid of the White House’s entire global 
health security team 2 years ago. Let 
me repeat that. For 2 years, President 
Trump left us without the team that is 
supposed to manage pandemics. Do you 
know what that means? It means that 
there were about 40 people at the White 
House, led by an admiral who was an 
M.D.—an admiral who was also a doc-
tor. His job was to survey the world 
and look around for potential illness 
outbreaks, to look around for potential 
pandemics. It might have been SARS. 
It might have been Ebola. It might 
have been a resurgence of polio. It 
might have been any number of things. 
His job at the White House—we are a 
rich enough country. We can do this, 
and we do it to protect—we care about 
the world. We protect our own people, 
although, as we see, if we don’t, we see 
what happens. His job was to continue 
to look around the world and look out 
for these kinds of pandemics. The 
President fired him. The President 
fired the whole office. The President 
has never replaced them. I sent him a 
letter at the time, more than 600 days 
ago—back in May of 2018—telling him 
to stop dismantling our healthcare in-
frastructure. Now we are all paying the 
price for President Trump’s decision. 
We see the real-time consequences. 
This was unilateral disarmament. We 
unilaterally 
disarmed 
against 
the 
world’s infectious diseases. 
We know that international tuber-
culosis is a problem. We know that 
international HIV/AIDS is a problem. 
We know that international malaria is 
a problem. We work against those. 
Do you know what? One of the things 
I am proudest about in our country is 
what we have done about public health. 
We led the charge to eradicate small 
pox. Small pox killed hundreds of mil-
lions of people over time in this 
world—hundreds of millions. 
We led the charge to eradicate small 
pox—this country did. Then we led the 
charge to eradicate polio all over the 
world. I am old enough to remember 
children—not children anymore—chil-
dren I went to grade school with who 
had had polio. They were recovered, 
but they still limped. They still had 
signs of polio—not crippling signs but 
signs of polio. We did that. 
We took on tobacco in this body— 
Senator DURBIN, Senator BLUMENTHAL, 
Senator MERKLEY, and I and others. 
People smoke at half the rate today 
than they did 50 years ago. It is start-
ing to go back up because of e-ciga-
rettes, but we have had huge public 
health victories in this country. 
Do you know what? We have a Presi-
dent of the United States now and we 
have 
a 
Senate 
Republican 
leader, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, who—well, he cer-
tainly tried to help tobacco, but I 
won’t even talk about that. We have a 
President and we have a Senate major-
ity leader who simply did all they 
could to dismantle the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and NIH. They left us un-
prepared when the President fired the 
global security team at the White 
House that looked out for illnesses. 
Now we have a global pandemic on our 
hands. 
President Trump needs to stop pre-
tending he can lock out a disease by 
putting up walls at the border—that he 
has already allowed to spread—and he 
needs to start making up for all the 
lost time he has wasted, and so does 
Senator MCCONNELL. 
We need to make sure we don’t end 
up with a financial crisis on top of the 
public health crisis. For some of us, 
this feels like deja vu. We have been in 
moments like this before. We have seen 
the market drop. We worried about the 
financial system. We bailed out the 
banks, but we didn’t do anything for 
the workers. That is what this body al-
ways does. 
I am certain Senator MCCONNELL will 
get around to—and President Trump— 
helping corporations that have been 
hurt. There have been corporations 
that have been damaged badly—hotel 
chains, transportation companies, par-
ticularly airlines. They have been hurt 
badly by this. That part is going to get 
worse. I am sure they will open the 
public checkbook to make sure there 
are billions of dollars for these indus-
tries, but we shouldn’t do it until we 
take care of the workers.

S1721 
March 12, 2020 
If we are going to give X number of 
dollars to the airlines, as we probably 
should, most of that money better end 
up in the pockets of the flight attend-
ants, the pilots, the ticket agents, the 
mechanics, the baggage handlers, and 
all of the people who work for the air-
lines whom this body forgets about. 
Yeah, they serve us when we fly, and 
we don’t even know their names. We 
probably know the CEOs’ names, and 
we always help them, but we ought to 
be helping the workers. 
Right now, we have a chance to stop 
this from spiraling out of control. We 
don’t have another 2008 on our hands 
yet, but we have to act now. We don’t 
go home for a week or two or three be-
cause Senator MCCONNELL
has some 
whatever it is that would send us 
home. We need to act now. We need to 
make sure that we focus our efforts on 
preventing this virus from spreading 
and that we don’t have one crisis—the 
healthcare crisis—stacked on top of an 
economic crisis, making the healthcare 
crisis worse. 
We know that job is harder because 
of all the ways President Trump and 
Leader MCCONNELL
have undone the 
many protections we put in place after 
the last crisis. They backed away from 
Wall Street reform safeguards. The 
President had a chance to get ahead of 
this virus and other public health 
threats, and he failed. He had a chance 
to get ahead of financial risks, and he 
failed. 
Luckily, Senator MCCONNELL and the 
President haven’t succeeded in getting 
rid of all of our Wall Street reform pro-
tections. They haven’t succeeded in re-
pealing the Affordable Care Act. Be-
cause of that, because of the work we 
did 
a 
decade 
ago 
with 
President 
Obama, we are in a better position now 
than we were in 2009. But we have to 
come together. We have to rise to this 
challenge. Corporate America needs to, 
too. 
One way we can do that is to suspend 
these stock buybacks. Congress gave a 
huge tax cut to the wealthy in this 
country 2 years ago. Seventy percent of 
the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 
percent. 
I sat in the White House with the 
President and about 10 Senators. The 
President said: You know, everybody’s 
pay is going to go up $4,000, some as 
much as $9,000. Those were the bookend 
numbers he used. He said that if we do 
this tax cut, it is going to trickle down 
and workers are going to get these 
raises. 
Well, it didn’t exactly happen that 
way. But do you know what did hap-
pen? After they got this tax cut, the 
executives 
started 
to 
do 
stock 
buybacks, taking money that should 
have been invested in workers, taking 
money that should have been invested 
in technology and upgrading their com-
panies, but it went to executives—not 
exactly a shock to most of us. That is 
what happened. 
Banks need to invest in their commu-
nities, not invest in their CEOs’ stock 
portfolio. Right now, JPMorgan is in 
the middle of an ongoing $30 billion in 
stock buybacks. Wells Fargo is in the 
midst of a $23 billion stock buyback, as 
if their executives, in all of their crimi-
nality and bad decisions, have earned 
it. That money would be better spent 
investing in small business, in medical 
research, and in relief for people who 
need help. The reason big banks are 
supposed to have that money is so that 
they keep lending and keep commu-
nities afloat when we have crises like 
this. 
It is time for all of us to come to-
gether in the Senate, in the White 
House, in the communities across the 
country, and, yes, on Wall Street. That 
means we don’t leave this building 
until we have done everything we need 
to do to get this epidemic under con-
trol, to get our communities the test-
ing capacity and tools they need to 
manage this crisis, and to support the 
workers who are going to get hurt. 
Leader MCCONNELL’s responsibility— 
I don’t care how he votes in the end— 
is to make the decision to put the 
House bill on the floor so we can vote 
on it, and President Trump, the day he 
gets it, needs to sign it. 
Let’s get help to the people we 
serve—not next week, not 2 weeks from 
now, not tomorrow; let’s do it today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JAMES P. DANLY 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I will 
be voting to confirm Mr. Danly’s nomi-
nation to be a member of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. I am 
doing so because I believe he is well 
qualified for the job. He has been the 
Commission’s general counsel for the 
past 21⁄2 years. He understands the com-
plex legal issues that come before the 
Commission. 
I voted to report Mr. Danly’s nomina-
tion, both last November and again 
last week, on the strength of his quali-
fications, not on politics. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
The position to which Mr. Danly has 
been nominated is one of five seats on 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission. By law, no more than three of 
the five seats can be held by one party. 
Only three of the seats are now filled— 
two by Republicans and one by a Dem-
ocrat. The other Democratic seat has 
been vacant since last August. 
Traditionally, when both a Repub-
lican seat and a Democratic seat have 
been vacant, past Presidents have sent 
nominations to fill both at the same 
time. I am deeply disappointed that 
this has not happened this time. The 
politics involved in this town are out-
rageous. It is truly outrageous that 
even proper decorum, simple civility, 
and just a little bit of procedure are 
not even considered anymore. 
The White House has had a highly 
qualified candidate to fill the Demo-
cratic seat for over a year, who has 
been totally vetted and has gone 
through all the processes that we have, 
but the President and his staff have 
still not sent us her nomination. I 
think they are scared. I hear this be-
cause she is a very, very bright, very 
smart, very articulate, and very intel-
ligent person. She knows the issues, 
and she is well respected in her field. 
By breaking the longstanding prac-
tice of pairing nominations and not 
sending us a nomination for the Demo-
cratic seat, the administration under-
mines the bipartisan structure of the 
Commission. I made a commitment to 
Mr. Danly that I would support his 
nomination because he is well quali-
fied, and I will honor that commitment 
and vote to confirm him. Two wrongs 
don’t make a right here, but this has 
got to stop. 
Both sides have to stand up and say: 
Mr. President, this is a tradition. This 
is what we do. This is customary of 
what has been done, and it gives us a 
five-member FERC, which is extremely 
important for energy in our country 
and the reliability that we depend on. 
But as I told my colleagues on the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee, when we voted on Mr. Danly’s 
nomination, I will not support another 
nominee unless we get both. This has 
to stop, and I am asking my colleagues 
on the Republican side to please help 
us with some kind of structure and 
some kind of procedure back into the 
operation. We need to start acting as a 
Senate and not be guided by the poli-
tics—the toxic politics—and this tribal 
mentality. I want the President to send 
us the nominations so we can have a 
fully functioning committee. 
So with that, I ask all of my col-
leagues, please, let’s vote for the quali-
fications of the person, not the politics 
of the person. Also, let’s make sure we 
have a complete, working Commission 
and not just a partial Commission that 
is overweighted. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Danly nomination? 
Mr. MANCHIN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays.

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, Congress provided billions in 
funding to address the coronavirus out-
break. These funds will help support 
virus research, testing, and medical 
care. Congress is now looking at other 
measures that may be required, includ-
ing measures to address the economic 
impact of the virus. The House may 
consider an economic response measure 
today, but my understanding is that its 
bill does not yet reflect an agreement 
with the White House, which will be 
needed to move any stimulus package. 
I want to echo the leader’s comments 
from yesterday and say that this is not 
a time for partisanship, and it is very 
important that we work together on 
matters related to the coronavirus so 
that we can get needed legislation 
passed in a timely fashion. 
More Americans are testing positive 
for the virus each day—including eight 
people in my home State of South Da-
kota—and it is our responsibility as 
Members of Congress to work together 
to ensure that our country has the re-
sources it needs to combat and defeat 
this disease. 
There is no doubt that things are 
stressful right now. Americans are un-
derstandably worried about their own 
health and the health of their loved 
ones. But we have a lot of dedicated 
people working to keep Americans 
safe, from nurses and doctors to public 
health officials. Everyone is focused on 
making sure we do what we need to do 
to limit the spread of this virus. And 
all of us, of course, can help in that ef-
fort by paying attention to the guid-
ance we are given, whether it is advice 
about washing our hands or avoiding 
large gatherings or a request to stay 
home for a while. 
It is a challenging time, but America 
has been through challenging times be-
fore and emerged from them stronger. I 
am confident that if we pull together, 
that is what will happen again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this 
Women’s History Month, we have the 
opportunity to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the ratification of the 
19th Amendment of the Constitution, 
which gave women the right to vote. 
We recognize the countless women 
who have put their own safety and 
comfort on the line in order to make 
this country more just, democratic, 
and inclusive. These include heroes 
like Margaret Brent, a daughter of 
Maryland who was the first to demand 
a vote for women in the colonial legis-
lature, and Sojourner Truth, who advo-
cated for a more diverse and inter-
sectional women’s suffrage movement. 
Thanks to their bravery and that of 
many other activists, our Nation wit-
nessed the largest expansion of suffrage 
in its history. 
A century later, we ought to cele-
brate that monumental achievement. 
The ability to vote has empowered 
women to demand a government that 
represents them and their interests, 
and they have taken their power seri-
ously. Women have voted in higher 
numbers than men in every national 
election for the last 55 years. In 2018, 
we saw the results that can happen 
when women raise their voices and 
fight for a more inclusive democracy as 
a record 117 women won elections to 
Congress across the United States. 
We cannot overstate how dramati-
cally the adoption of the 19th Amend-
ment has changed our country for the 
better, but it is also incumbent upon us 
to take stock of the progress that still 
needs to be made. 
Just a few years after women won the 
right to vote, a suffragette named 
Alice Paul introduced another criti-
cally important constitutional amend-
ment, one that would go even further 
in guaranteeing the equal status of 
women. It was called the Equal Rights 
Amendment, or the ERA, which reads 
as follows: ‘‘Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex.’’ That is it. It is just 
24 words. Yet those 24 words have the 
power to correct a 250-year silence in 
our Constitution when it comes to rec-
ognizing and protecting women’s equal-
ity. 
The ERA was ratified by the U.S. 
Congress in 1972, and with Virginia’s 
ratification this past January, enough 
States have adopted the amendment to 
meet the threshold for it to be added to 
the Constitution. So what is the hold-
up? Why isn’t it a part of the Constitu-
tion yet? When Congress ratified the 
Equal Rights Amendment, it imposed a 
deadline for State legislatures to rat-
ify. That deadline has passed. 
There should never be a deadline on 
equality. The Constitution does not 
call for time limits for the ratification 
of amendments, and there is precedent 
for amendments being added to the 
Constitution as many as 200 years after 
having first been proposed. 
Most importantly, just as Congress 
had the power to impose and extend 
the deadline by resolution, we have the 
power to remove it through the same 
means. That is why I have introduced a 
resolution with Senator MURKOWSKI to 
remove the ratification deadline for 
the Equal Rights Amendment. Rep-
resentative JACKIE SPEIER introduced a 
companion resolution that has already 
been passed by the House of Represent-
atives. We are closer than ever to mak-
ing the Equal Rights Amendment a re-
ality. 
This measure has historically en-
joyed bipartisan support. The vast ma-
jority of Americans—94 percent of 
them—is in favor of a constitutional 
equality amendment. Perhaps it is be-
cause they understand that this is an 
issue not of politics but of basic human

rights. If you have any doubt about 
that, just look at the rest of the mod-
ern world. Every constitution written 
around the globe since World War II 
recognizes the equal stature of men 
and women. Ours does not. That is 
shameful. 
Among those who are hesitant to 
support the ERA, one of their most 
common arguments is that it is not 
necessary. People argue that women al-
ready enjoy equal rights and protec-
tions in our society, so what is the 
need to write it down? To them, I say 
think again. Although the wage gap be-
tween men and women has narrowed 
over time, it still exists today. In 2019, 
women earned only 79 percent as much 
as their male counterparts for similar 
work. This disparity is even worse for 
women of color. It affects women their 
entire lives, and it affects their retire-
ments. Recent data show that women 
over 65 are twice as likely as men to 
live below the poverty line. We owe it 
to America’s women—to our mothers, 
daughters, sisters, friends, and selves— 
to remedy this societal failure. 
Furthermore, as it stands, women in 
the United States have no Federal re-
course for gender-based violence. Be-
cause of that, the courts have allowed 
police officers to refuse to defend vic-
tims of domestic abuse and have even 
struck down the protections offered by 
the Violence Against Women Act. The 
Equal Rights Amendment would re-
quire the Federal Government to pro-
hibit and penalize this type of discrimi-
nation. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg once 
said that, if she could choose an 
amendment to add to the Constitution, 
it would be the Equal Rights Amend-
ment because she would like her grand-
daughters, when they pick up the Con-
stitution, to see that notion—that 
women and men are persons of equal 
stature—as being a basic principle of 
our society. As a grandfather of two 
granddaughters 
myself, 
I 
couldn’t 
agree more. I want them to know that, 
in America, they will enjoy the same 
protections and opportunities as any-
one else. 
I want every young person to grow up 
understanding that her dreams are 
within reach, that her autonomy is re-
spected, and that her life is significant. 
In order to make that a reality, women 
need more than the right to vote, as 
fundamental as that is; they need a 
promise that they will be free from all 
forms of discrimination and injustice. 
That is why men, women, Republicans, 
and Democrats must come together in 
order to correct that silence in our 
Constitution—a silence that speaks 
volumes. We must all unite to support 
the Equal Rights Amendment. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

f 
HONORING OFFICER BRENT 
SCRIMSHIRE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor Hot Springs Police Officer 
First Class Brent Scrimshire, who was 
killed in the line of duty on Tuesday, 
March 10. 
A native of Malvern, AR, Brent 
Scrimshire graduated from Malvern 
High School and Henderson State Uni-
versity. 
Officer Scrimshire was an exemplary 
member of law enforcement. He had 
served on the Hot Springs police force 
for a number of years and was recog-
nized as the department’s Employee of 
the Quarter just recently in acknowl-
edgment of his unique dedication, work 
ethic, and professionalism. 
Arkansas Attorney General Leslie 
Rutledge also named him the South-
west Region Officer of the Year in 2016, 
which, according to media reports, he 
earned in part because of his lifesaving 
action when he helped to control the 
bleeding of a stabbing victim. 
‘‘Scrim’’ was known for treating his 
brothers in blue, as well as those he en-
countered while doing his job, with 
kindness and dignity. He also enjoyed 
being outdoors, hunting and fishing. 
Officer Scrimshire deeply loved his 
wife and two children, who are now left 
behind to go through life without the 
devoted husband and dad they adored. 
Our hearts break for them, the rest 
of his family and friends, and his entire 
family at the Hot Springs Police De-
partment. His death is a tragic re-
minder of the risks our law enforce-
ment officials face each time they put 
on the uniform. 
I send my deepest condolences to Of-
ficer Scrimshire’s loved ones. We honor 
his service and his sacrifice and pray 
all those fortunate enough to have 
known him will find comfort in his leg-
acy and in the outpouring of love and 
support from so many. 
On behalf of all Arkansans, we cele-
brate Officer Scrimshire’s life and ex-
ample of courageous, willing, and self-
less public service. May he rest in 
peace. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, as the Senate knows now, Lead-
er MCCONNELL
announced that we 
would cancel our State work period so 
we could continue to work on legisla-
tion here in Washington, DC, to help 
families and our communities get 
through the economic effect of the 
coronavirus’s spread. I am glad he 
made that decision, and I look forward 
to continuing to work on those issues 
for the benefit of our constituents and 
the Nation. 
This situation calls for an all-of-gov-
ernment response, and it will allow us 
additional time to hammer out a bipar-
tisan agreement to respond to the rip-
ple effect that this outbreak is having 
in Texas and across the country. 
As we continue our discussions on 
this legislation, I would just urge my 
colleagues that this is a time to put 
partisanship aside and stop playing 
politics, if there ever was one. 
There is actually precedent for that. 
At the height of the Ebola crisis in 
2014, Republicans in the Senate worked 
with our Democratic colleagues and 
President Obama to ensure we were 
ready to treat Texans and other Ameri-
cans who needed care from that par-
ticular disease. 
We need to come together to do the 
same now, not to use the opportunity 
to attack or score political points or to 
try to damage our opponents. Unfortu-
nately, that seems to be the first im-
pulse of some of our friends across the 
Capitol Chamber. 
Most of the public concern is focused 
on the elderly, on cruise ship travelers, 
and those with underlying medical con-
ditions, but we need to think of every 
family, every college student, and to 
make sure that everyone who is wor-
rying about how to make ends meet 
during this particular crisis because 
they had to stay home and miss work 
has their concerns addressed as well. 
This virus could disrupt everyone’s 
daily routine in one way or the other, 
and as we have seen from the departure 
of some of our colleagues for self-quar-
antining, we are truly in this together. 
I am glad we will be staying in ses-
sion to try to bring as much relief and 
reassurance as we can in this uncertain 
time, and I look forward to all of us, 
Republicans and Democrats, the House 
and the Senate and the White House 
working together to get every Amer-
ican ready for what is to come. 
It is not just the Senate that is alter-
ing its plans due to the coronavirus. 
Across the country, serious measures 
are taking place out of an abundance of 
caution to keep the American people 
safe. Some schools are choosing to 
close their doors, nursing homes are 
barring visitors, and major events like 
South by Southwest in Austin are can-
celing. 
On the global scale, we are seeing an 
unprecedented action, including all of 
Italy—some 60 million people—going 
on a complete lockdown. 
For many Americans, it seems like 
this public health crisis has escalated 
incredibly quickly. We went from never 
having heard of this new virus to con-
stant news coverage about its growing 
reach within a matter of weeks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1724 
March 12, 2020 
But this outbreak began long before 
the average American even knew it ex-
isted, and it was no accident that Chi-
nese officials kept the rest of the world 
in the dark. 
One of first people to sound the 
alarm about the novel virus—that is 
what 
they 
call 
it, 
the 
novel 
coronavirus—was 34-year-old Chinese 
doctor Li Wenliang, who, sadly, became 
a victim of the coronavirus. 
On December 30 of last year, after 
seeing several patients who he believed 
at the time to have SARS, another 
type of coronavirus, Dr. Li messaged a 
group of medical school classmates to 
let them know that he had seen some-
thing new and different and potentially 
dangerous. 
Dr. Li told them that these were con-
firmed cases of coronavirus infection, 
but the exact strain was still being 
subtyped. He also urged them to have 
their families and friends take protec-
tive measures, but these messages were 
soon shared much wider than the in-
tended audience, and the Chinese Com-
munist Party and the government 
quickly stepped in to stop this infor-
mation from being spread. Chinese po-
lice reprimanded Dr. Li and several 
others for ‘‘spreading rumors’’ about 
the virus. 
In the Chinese Government’s effort 
to carefully conceal information about 
the rapid spread of symptoms through-
out the city of Wuhan, this amounted 
to a big threat. They continued to take 
extreme measures to assure the Chi-
nese people that there was no need for 
them to be concerned. They even re-
fused to acknowledge the risk of 
human-to-human transmission, which 
is responsible for the global spread of 
this virus. 
While this is a novel coronavirus 
strain, the underlying story is familiar. 
Chinese officials learn about a deadly 
outbreak of a new virus; they try to 
conceal the news; they aren’t trans-
parent with their own people, much 
less other countries; and when the 
word begins to spread beyond their bor-
ders, they try to downplay the serious-
ness, even going so far as to manipu-
late data about the number of cases or 
fatalities. 
We saw this story line play out with 
the bird flu in the late 1990s and again 
with the SARS epidemic in the early 
2000s. This is just the latest example of 
the Chinese Communist Party’s failure 
in the face of a public health crisis. 
They continue to deny the facts and 
put their pride before public safety. It 
is a symptom of a much larger central-
ized censorship that we have come to 
associate with the Chinese Govern-
ment, one that represents a threat to 
the rest of the world. 
Imagine if the situation were dif-
ferent, if the government had listened 
to Dr. Li’s initial warnings, if they had 
reached out to international aid orga-
nizations and asked for assistance, de-
ployed additional resources to hos-
pitals in Wuhan, and told the Chinese 
people to exercise normal caution. 
Now, there is no way to be sure, but I 
imagine the current situation would 
look somewhat different. 
China’s censorship seriously handi-
capped our global response to this new 
virus, and they continue to release in-
consistent and misleading statistics 
about the current state of the virus. 
They have reported that the number 
of new cases continues to decrease, but 
I ask you: How can we possibly trust 
this data? How can we know that this 
isn’t just the latest attempt to down-
play the crisis? 
While China’s lack of transparency 
on the coronavirus has, without a 
doubt, had the greatest global impact, 
it is not the only country guilty of 
misrepresenting the nature of the 
threat in the rest of the world. 
We also suspect massive censorship 
from Iran, which is battling one of the 
world’s largest outbreaks. According to 
the 
Coronavirus 
Resource 
Center, 
which is operated at Johns Hopkins 
University, Iran has more than 9,000 
cases. For reference, out of the more 
than 120,000 cases worldwide, China has 
far and away the greatest number, with 
more than 80,000. Italy is a distant sec-
ond with more than 10,000, but Iran is 
not far behind. 
Just as China sought to keep initial 
reports of the virus quiet and downplay 
the impact, so did Iran. The leadership 
in Iran urged the Iranian people to vote 
in last month’s sham election, saying 
rumors about the virus were being ped-
aled by the United States to suppress 
voter turnout. They mocked the con-
cept of quarantines. They even ex-
ported their masks to China, expecting 
that the coronavirus would have no im-
pact on their country. 
As we predicted then and now know, 
the Iranian leaders were absolutely 
wrong. They are now in the throes of 
trying to control the spread of the 
virus, which has claimed the lives of 
more than 350 people in Iran, and that 
is just the ones we know about. 
It is widely believed that Iran, like 
China, is suppressing data to make the 
situation seem less dire than it really 
is, and it is not just the civilians who 
are being impacted. Yesterday reports 
surfaced that Iran’s Senior Vice Presi-
dent and two other Cabinet members 
have the coronavirus. That comes after 
previous reports of other current and 
former officials being admitted to hos-
pitals and at least two deaths. 
The actions taken by the leaders of 
these countries—Iran and China—have, 
without a doubt, contributed to the 
rapid 
rise 
and 
spread 
of 
the 
coronavirus. They have concealed in-
formation; they have misrepresented 
the facts; and they have lied to their 
own citizens and the global commu-
nity, all in their own self-interest. 
The reflexive censorship from China 
and Iran put the rest of the world at 
greater risk, and it handicapped our 
preparation for ways to address it. 
As our leaders, health officials, doc-
tors, nurses, and scientists continue to 
work around the clock to contain this 
virus, we have to have transparency, 
and we have to know the facts. 
If we are going to have any success 
on a global scale dealing with the 
coronavirus, 
we 
need 
honesty 
and 
transparency from all countries. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 6172 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, they spied 
on the President of the United States. 
They used the apparatus of the U.S. 
Government’s superb intelligence gath-
ering agencies to spy on then-Can-
didate Donald Trump, now President of 
the United States. They did so in a way 
that was entirely predictable, entirely 
foreseeable, and in some ways avoid-
able, if, in fact, we had the right laws 
on the books. We don’t. That needs to 
change. That is why this moment is a 
pivotal moment when three provisions 
in the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act are about to expire this com-
ing Sunday, March 15. 
We have known that this day was 
coming for many years. In fact, it was 
in 2015 when Congress last reauthorized 
the three expiring provisions on any 
long-term basis. The three expiring 
provisions are, of course, known as 
Lone Wolf, Roving Wiretaps, and 215. It 
is to the last of these three sections, 
215, that I am directing most of my re-
marks today. 
Now, 215 is only the beginning and 
not the end of the portion of the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also 
known as FISA, that needs reform. We 
need reform across the board, but the 
expiration of 215 gives us a unique op-
portunity to do that. We reauthorized 
it in 2015, knowing that it would come 
back again for reauthorization in De-
cember of 2019. 
In December of 2019, we were in the 
middle of doing other things, so an 
agreement was made within this body 
that we would extend 215 and the other 
two provisions until this coming Sun-
day, March 15. So absent action by this 
body between now and Sunday, March 
15, those three provisions of law will 
expire. 
Those three provisions of law should 
not have to expire because we ought to 
be able to reform FISA. A number of us 
have been working on this not just for 
days or weeks or months but, literally, 
years. I am now in my 10th year in the 
U.S. Senate. Basically, the entire time, 
I have been working on reforms to 
FISA, figuring out where its weak 
spots are, and warning my colleagues 
years in advance that at some point 
this would be abused.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1725 
March 12, 2020 
We have to remember what happened 
with 
the 
Church 
Committee. 
The 
Frank Church Committee, a few dec-
ades ago in the U.S. Senate, looked at 
the use of intelligence gathering and 
concluded that in every administra-
tion—basically from Wilson through 
Nixon, who was the President imme-
diately before the Church Committee 
did its investigation and issued its re-
port—U.S. intelligence gathering agen-
cies had abused their authority for par-
tisan political purposes basically to en-
gage in political espionage. We know 
that this is dangerous. We know that 
this is bad. We also know that this is 
just the beginning and not the end of 
the opportunities for abuse. 
Consider this: Given the breadth and 
the wide scope on the authority pro-
vided under FISA and given the fact 
that the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Court is able to operate in se-
crecy and, for the most part, without 
any type of appellate review and any 
type of judicial review, these are provi-
sions that are, in fact, vulnerable and 
susceptible to abuse. 
So it is not just the President of the 
United States who has reason to be 
concerned about this. If the President 
of the United States has reason to be 
concerned about it, as he does—he re-
minded us just in the last few hours, 
issuing a statement this morning indi-
cating that he still has concerns with 
FISA and that many Senators are 
pointing out the flaws in the reform 
package passed by the Democratic-con-
trolled House of Representatives ear-
lier this week and that many have en-
couraged him to veto that legislation 
on that basis. But if the President of 
the United States himself has reason to 
be concerned about FISA, what about 
the rest of America? This is just the 
episode that people know about in con-
nection with the abuse that took place 
in the Carter Page investigation. Had 
Donald Trump not become President of 
the United States, we might well still 
not know about this particular in-
stance of abuse. Because of the secret 
manner in which this law operates and 
the failure to provide special protec-
tions for known U.S. citizens, we all 
stand vulnerable—every American cit-
izen, whether they hold office or not, 
whether they are famous or not, 
whether they are rich or poor, regard-
less of their culture, their background, 
or what part of the country they hail 
from. 
So what we are seeking here are a 
few modest reforms to make sure that 
it is a little bit harder to abuse this 
law. We know human beings are flawed 
and fallible, and we have to rely on 
human beings to run governments. It 
would be nice, as James Madison said, 
if men were angels because, as Madison 
wrote in Federalist 51, if men were an-
gels, they wouldn’t need a government. 
And if we had access to angels to run 
our government, we wouldn’t need all 
these rules surrounding the extent of 
the power of government to protect us 
from the inherent risk associated with 
the unjust, excessive accumulation of 
power in the hands of a few. 
But, alas, we are not angels, nor do 
we have access to angels to run our 
government, so we have to rely on 
rules. The rules we are proposing are 
not excessive. They are not extreme. 
They are actually very mild. Among 
other things, we would like to see more 
robust amicus provisions, meaning pro-
visions allowing for a third-party advo-
cate in the FISA Court to be called in, 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
espe-
cially involving a sensitive investiga-
tion—involving, for example, a polit-
ical campaign or a candidate, an office 
holder, a church, a media establish-
ment, something like that that oper-
ates with express constitutional pro-
tection. An amicus ought to be ap-
pointed to represent an absent con-
trasting viewpoint, to represent Amer-
ican citizens where American citizens’ 
rights might be in jeopardy. 
Understanding, as we have since 2015, 
that these provisions would be expiring 
first in December of 2019 and then we 
reauthorized them for a short period of 
time to give us more time to address 
these amendments, I have, for years, 
been working on proposals and revi-
sions to FISA with this specific expira-
tion deadline in mind. 
I have not been, nor have any of my 
colleagues who have concerns about 
this, unreasonable or extreme in our 
demands. In fact, for me, personally— 
and I will not purport to speak for any-
one else in this—for me, personally, I 
would be fine with two of the three pro-
visions being reauthorized without any 
further modification. Lone Wolf and 
Roving Wiretaps—let them get reau-
thorized; that is fine. Let’s deal with 
215 separately. 
Incidentally, section 215—if Sunday 
comes and passes, 215 doesn’t go away. 
It just reverts back to a previous 
version of 215—a previous version that 
still gives the government the ability 
to gain access to some business records 
associated with FISA-ordered targets. 
It is just a narrower category. 
Now, we can argue about whether 
that earlier provision would be ade-
quate. Incidentally, inspectors general 
have looked at this and concluded that 
the 9/11 attacks were not the fault of 
the inadequacy of 215. They were the 
result of mishandling of information 
that they did, in fact, gather and were 
able to gather. 
In any event, I would love to be able 
to have that conversation separately 
with regard to 215 without all three of 
these provisions being held hostage si-
multaneously. I have made that offer. 
That offer has been rejected. 
I also think another appropriate ap-
proach in this circumstance might well 
be to give ourselves a 45-day extension. 
A 45-day extension would give us a lit-
tle bit more time to deal with the 
coronavirus-related crises that we face 
right now and then consider and debate 
and vote on some additional amend-
ments—some amendments that have 
never had the opportunity to see the 
light of day. 
Keep in mind, this provision—getting 
back to the expiring provision that I 
have concerns with, section 215—ex-
isted prior to the moment when it 
reached its current formulation. When 
it existed in that formulation, it really 
did what the government needed it to. 
No one really argued that it had been 
inadequate. There were some people, I 
am told—I wasn’t in the Senate or in 
Congress at the time that it came to 
be. I am told that its advocates in-
cluded Robert Mueller, Jim Comey, 
and others, who just thought it would 
be a good idea to give the government 
more power. 
We have seen since then what hap-
pens when you give Jim Comey and 
Robert Mueller and other people in the 
government more power, and we have 
seen that there are some risks associ-
ated with this, not just if you are a 
President of the United States or a 
candidate for the Presidency of the 
United States, but we know that all 
Americans are potentially vulnerable. 
So we fast forward to earlier this 
week, less than 48 hours ago. We re-
ceived legislation, the legislation that 
was passed by the House of Representa-
tives yesterday. That legislation was 
negotiated 
without 
involvement 
or 
without direct input from anybody in 
this body. The majority leader himself 
has stated publicly that he was not in-
volved in the negotiation of that meas-
ure. That measure was passed within 
about 24 hours after it was introduced. 
It is now coming over here. 
Now, 
I 
am 
not 
saying 
that 
it 
shouldn’t be considered. In fact, I am 
kind of saying the opposite of that. I 
am saying, I am happy to consider it, 
but we need the opportunity to actu-
ally consider it. The world’s greatest 
deliberative legislative body or so it 
calls itself—the Senate—is supposed to 
be the cooling saucer, the cooling sau-
cer where the hot tea spills out and is 
allowed to cool before it is consumed. 
In these circumstances in particular, 
where rights are at stake, rights are at 
stake that are potentially threatened 
by provisions under this bill—this bill 
introduced by Representative NADLER, 
and 
supported 
by 
Representatives 
SCHIFF, 
PELOSI, 
and 
others—which 
hasn’t had the opportunity to be inde-
pendently reviewed in the Senate or to 
be debated or discussed or amended in 
the Senate. That is all I am asking for 
here. 
All I ask is to give us a few weeks. 
Let’s take 45 days. Give the Senate a 
chance to deal with the immediate cri-
ses associated with the coronavirus and 
then a chance for us, in a timely fash-
ion, to review the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff 
bill and consider our own amendments 
to it—bipartisan amendments from 
people who have reached across the 
aisle in an effort to make this bill bet-
ter. 
So it is for those reasons that I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of the Senate bill at the desk pro-
viding for a 45-day extension of FISA. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1726 
March 12, 2020 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; further, that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Democratic lead-
er, the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of H.R. 6172 and that the only 
amendments in order be six amend-
ments offered by the following Sen-
ators: Senator LEE, Senator LEAHY, 
Senator DAINES, Senator WYDEN, and 
Senator PAUL. I further ask that upon 
disposition of the amendments, the 
bill, as amended, if amended, be read a 
third time and the Senate vote on the 
bill, as amended, if amended, with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I want to thank my 
colleague. He has shown more interest 
in this bill today than he has ever in 
the history of tools that keep us safe. 
I remember Paul Harvey on the 
radio. He always came on and said: 
‘‘Now, for the rest of the story.’’ 
Senator LEE has never supported this 
bill, never supported giving any of 
these authorities to law enforcement. 
And let me explain what they are—rov-
ing wiretap and lone wolf. Lone wolf is 
that individual out there who pops up, 
whom we can find, who is not tied to an 
international terrorist group but is 
homegrown. On wiretapping, we are 
going to take roving wiretaps away 
from the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, and we are going to take it away 
for terrorism. But since 1960, they have 
had 
roving 
wiretaps 
for 
organized 
crime—think 
about 
that—and 
then 
business records and their access to 
business records to find those clues 
that we need to keep America safe. 
Senator LEE talked about us holding 
hostage. No, we are not holding any-
body hostage. He is holding the bill 
hostage to get amendments, some of 
which shouldn’t even be considered 
under the reauthorization of section 
215. They are FISA reforms being taken 
up by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
That bill that came over from the 
House—the one supported by PELOSI, 
SCHIFF, and NADLER—is actually a bi-
partisan bill that 63 percent of the Re-
publicans in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives have supported. It is Lead-
er MCCARTHY. I will not go down the 
list of them. But it is easy to make 
this out as the boogeyman. 
But to my colleagues, we don’t play 
national 
security 
risk, 
boogeyman 
games against the American people. 
We err on the side of providing as many 
tools as we possibly can to make sure 
that our oath to keep America safe is 
as robust as it possibly can be. 
Now, why do we need to do this? It is 
because we need to provide law en-
forcement the certainty of knowing 
that they can continue to use these 
tools. If not, we are going to have cases 
that they are working on today where 
they have to stop at midstream and 
start over at some point later on. The 
question is, Will they be able to, or will 
they have lost the coverage they need 
on a certain individual? 
Now, what happens if they are gone? 
Well, we have been there. This is the 
result of trying to create guardrails 
that these agencies operated in. The 
President, under 12333 authority, can 
do all of this without Congress’s per-
mission, with no guardrails, with no 
ability to go in and say: Stay within 
this. 
That authority exists. 
The thing that I hear the most is 
that we want the ability for an amicus 
to go in and represent somebody in 
front of this foreign intelligence court. 
Well, let me tell you something that 
you are never going to be told. The 
court itself has the authority, today, 
to assign an amicus to any case that 
comes before the court. And what bet-
ter judge is there to make a determina-
tion as to whether an individual on 
whom there is an application on for 
FISA coverage than the court itself to 
determine: Is this a person, an indi-
vidual, who needs to be represented by 
a third party? No, it is not good enough 
to let the courts do it; they want to 
make sure that everybody does it. And 
when everybody does it, we slow down 
a process because that is what they are 
there for. We slow down a process that 
is there trying to be ahead of the secu-
rity risk that might have been pre-
vented. 
Personally, I am ready for a big de-
bate. We are going to have it next 
week, and we can have a debate on 
every one of the amendments of Sen-
ator LEE and the list of people he gave, 
and I think that they will be struck 
down. But I am not going to have a 45- 
day extension. I will let us go dark. I 
will let us go dark, and if there is a 
need, 
the 
President, 
by 
Executive 
order, can do it for whatever period 
people think they are willing to let it 
expire. 
I will make every attempt to try to 
get this process of reviewing FISA—not 
215—in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
where it should come out of, where the 
folks on the Judiciary Committee, who 
are experts on the interactions with 
the court, have an opportunity to have 
input. 
These amendments may never come 
out of the Judiciary Committee. They 
may never come out. Yet they want to 
expedite them and bring them right to 
the floor on a bill that is not nec-
essarily appropriate to put them on. 
Why? It is because they know by 
themselves they will never become law. 
They will have a tough time. So they 
will hold up those tools that we use for 
national security in an effort to try to 
get some changes. 
Well, I am holding the changes. This 
is not a straight reauthorization. This 
is a bill that has very carefully been 
crafted by the Attorney General, the 
Speaker of the House, and the minority 
leader of the House. Sixty-three per-
cent of the Republicans and not as 
many a percentage of the Democrats 
supported it. I think it was 270-some 
votes out of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Truthfully, by unanimous consent 
today the Senate should approve what 
they passed, but we will not because 
somebody wants to demand all of these 
amendments. 
So for that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the care, attention, and detail shown 
by my friend and colleague, the distin-
guished senior Senator from North 
Carolina. I do disagree with him for 10 
independent reasons. 
No. 1, as to the suggestion that the 
proponents of the unanimous consent 
request now before this body—that is, 
the very simple, clean reauthorization 
of the expiring provisions for 45 days, 
giving the Senate an opportunity to 
spend just a few weeks to debate and 
consider these amendments after deal-
ing with the coronavirus crisis—he sug-
gested that I, as the proponent of this 
measure, 
have—I 
think 
the 
words 
were—never supported any of these 
tools, never in my entire time in the 
Senate lifted a finger to support these 
tools. That is curious because I was the 
author and lead sponsor of the USA 
FREEDOM Act, which, in 2015, ex-
tended and reauthorized these very 
same provisions. So his first argument 
is factually incorrect. 
No. 2, he points to the lone wolf and 
roving wiretap provisions as things 
that he is concerned about. I under-
stand that they want those. Now, lone 
wolf isn’t used, but it is sort of a secu-
rity blanket. People like knowing that 
it is there within the government, and 
I am willing to let that go. Roving 
wiretaps are used from time to time. I 
am willing to let that go. In fact, I 
have offered repeatedly—and I will 
offer again right now, if it is helpful— 
that I am willing to reauthorize those 
right now without a single modifica-
tion, without a single limit beyond 
what has already been put in for the 
other provisions. I am willing to do 
that free of charge on anything. So 
those arguments are frankly disingen-
uous. 
No. 3, as to the suggestion that I am 
somehow holding this bill hostage, I 
say to the Senator: You, sir, have it 
wrong. You have it precisely backward. 
What I am doing is saying: Let’s pre-
serve the status quo. We have a crisis 
to deal with, with the coronavirus. 
It is of great frustration to me that 
this body, through its majority leader-
ship and through its other leadership 
has known for years—I put them on no-
tice for years, for basically the entire 
time I have been at the U.S. Senate— 
that I am concerned about these provi-
sions. I have made known ever since 
2015, when we reauthorized these provi-
sions at issue, that I would continue to

S1727 
March 12, 2020 
want more reforms. Why we waited 
until the final days before the expira-
tion of that period is beyond my ability 
to understand. But it is factually in-
correct and manifestly unfair to sug-
gest that I am the one holding this hos-
tage. 
I say to the Senator: It is quite the 
other way around, sir. 
As to the suggestion that these are 
FISA reforms, not PATRIOT Act re-
forms, well, yes, they are all part of 
this package that we refer to collec-
tively as the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act. The Senator is right as 
to the provisions, especially the provi-
sion that I am most concerned about, 
section 215, as we call it—section 215 of 
the USA PATRIOT Act. I give him that 
one, but that doesn’t address the sub-
stance of the problem here. 
As to Senator BURR’s argument that 
we should err on the side of keeping 
Americans safe, I absolutely agree with 
that. There is no dispute about that. 
I also agree with the findings of the 
Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight 
Board that concluded a few years ago 
that our privacy and our security are 
not at odds with each other. This is not 
a zero-sum game between those two ob-
jectives. Our privacy is, in fact, part of 
our security. One of the reasons we be-
came a nation, one of the reasons we 
don’t fly the Union Jack or sing ‘‘Hail 
to the Queen’’ or wear wigs and robes 
in court has everything to do with the 
excessive abuse of the rights of English 
subjects, including those on this con-
tinent, while we were existing as Brit-
ish Colonies. Our privacy and our secu-
rity are not at odds with each other. 
They are in fact part of the same cohe-
sive whole. 
No. 6, the argument made by Senator 
BURR that this provides uncertainty 
for law enforcement, well, let me tell 
you why that is the case. The only rea-
son there is uncertainty for law en-
forcement on this, for our intelligence 
community and law enforcement agen-
cies that handle this stuff, has every-
thing to do with the fact that he just 
objected to this unanimous consent re-
quest. 
We could, right now, eliminate their 
uncertainty. We could have, likewise, 
at any point in the months leading up 
to this, at every point in which I would 
have been willing to debate and discuss 
these things. For years I have had re-
forms on the table that we could have 
considered. We could have brought 
those up. We could have done it then. 
It is not me who is creating the un-
certainty for law enforcement. It is in-
stead the unreasonable objection to re-
ceive any of my offers, including pas-
sage of the Leahy-Lee bill, including 
passage of lone wolf and roving wiretap 
independently, including simply ex-
tending and cleanly reauthorizing the 
three expiring provisions for 45 days, 
giving us the chance to consider a 
handful of amendments. 
So I say to the Senator: Don’t talk to 
me about being the one who has cre-
ated uncertainty. That, sir, is you. 
No. 7, Senator BURR argues that a 
President of the United States can do 
all of this, in any event, without the 
three expiring provisions on the books. 
Well, my response to that is that is 
kind of curious. If that were the case, 
why is he fighting so hard for these 
provisions? Why should anyone be con-
cerned about their expiration? He sug-
gests somehow that we would not have 
guardrails—any guardrails in place—if, 
in fact, these were allowed to expire. If 
they were allowed to expire, I am not 
familiar with any authority that would 
provide language identical to that 
found in lone wolf or roving wiretap or 
215. 
So if that is the case, perhaps you, 
sir, would rather have them expire. I 
really don’t know, and I don’t think 
that advances your argument. 
No. 8, the suggestion was made that 
these amicus provisions—which are not 
the limit; they are one of six amend-
ments that I would like to propose and 
I would like the Senate to consider. 
But the FISA Court already has the au-
thority to appoint an amicus. Well, 
this is true. We put that in the USA 
FREEDOM Act in 2015. The court does 
have that authority. That doesn’t 
mean it happens as often as it should. 
In fact, as we saw with the abuse that 
took place in connection with Oper-
ation Crossfire Hurricane targeting the 
sitting President of the United States 
when he was a candidate, in many 
cases, the FISA Court judges are not 
themselves terribly careful. Perhaps it 
would be helpful to have somebody else 
in the room. I don’t know why we 
should be so afraid of that. 
No. 9, to the extent that anyone is 
going to let this program go dark and 
if that concerns you, then you ought to 
agree to this unanimous consent re-
quest. This unanimous consent request 
will result in it not going dark. 
I have made it entirely foreseeable 
that I would want to have amendments 
at least debated, discussed, and consid-
ered before we got to this moment. It is 
not unreasonable for me to ask. I am 
not asking that you accept these 
amendments, 
that 
you 
incorporate 
them into existing law; I am instead 
simply asking that we be given the op-
portunity to vote on them. 
Finally, No. 10, Mr. BURR argues that 
this legislation was carefully crafted 
by the Attorney General, the Speaker 
of the House, and several other officials 
and that some 270 or so Members of the 
House of Representatives voted for 
this. Well, good for them. That is their 
prerogative. I have my own election 
certificate. I serve in a different legis-
lative body. I am aware of no obliga-
tion on my election certificate that re-
quires me to defer to the Pelosi-Nadler- 
Schiff bill. In fact, I refuse to do that. 
It is insulting to this body. 
Had the Founding Fathers wanted to 
create a unicameral legislature, they 
could have done so. Had the Founding 
Fathers wished to create the Senate of 
the 
United 
States 
as 
simply 
a 
rubberstamp that would review what 
the House of Representatives did and 
then have a veto, yes or no, open or 
closed—a binary reaction to what the 
House of Representatives did—they 
could have, they would have, and they 
should have done so. They did not. We 
have our own independent obligation to 
review this legislation. I have done so. 
I find it inadequate. 
I am not demanding that all my 
amendments be accepted as a condition 
precedent for my willingness to keep 
these from going dark. All I am saying 
is that I want the opportunity to have 
amendments 
considered—bipartisan 
amendments—introduced 
by 
several 
Members. 
So I am going to make another re-
quest. I will tone this one down. I will 
modify this one. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of the Senate 
bill at the desk providing for a 45-day 
extension of FISA. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; further, 
that at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader, in consultation with 
the Democratic leader, the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of H.R. 6172; 
and that the only amendments in order 
be five amendments offered by the fol-
lowing Senators: Senators LEE, LEAHY, 
DAINES, WYDEN, and PAUL. I further 
ask 
that 
upon 
disposition 
of 
the 
amendments, the bill, as amended, if 
amended, be read a third time and that 
the Senate vote on the bill, as amend-
ed, if amended, with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BURR. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, you might 
notice a pattern here. This pattern is 
going to continue. This pattern is 
going to continue because this is un-
just. 
This 
is 
unrealistic. 
This 
is 
unsustainable. 
This used to be a body that prided 
itself on being the world’s greatest de-
liberative legislative body. It is a body 
that has its own unique protections at-
tached to it. 
Article I of the Constitution sets out 
the parameters of the Senate, and it 
makes clear that it will consist of ex-
actly two Members representing each 
State. The one and only kind of con-
stitutional amendment that is preemp-
tively unconstitutional, that cannot be 
adopted, is that type of amendment 
that would undo this fundamental, sa-
cred principle of equal representation 
among and between the States in the 
Senate. You cannot do that. 
They did this with a distinct purpose 
in mind: that we would have the ability 
to represent the States as States; that 
we would not be just a roving commis-
sion on what was satisfactory or 
whether the House of Representatives 
had done its homework but that we

March 12, 2020 
would be our own independent legisla-
tive body. We would be betraying our 
oath to the Constitution and those 
whom we represent if we didn’t do this. 
This used to be a place, for that very 
reason—in fact, until quite recently, it 
was a place where any Senator could 
have any amendment considered on 
any legislation. Basic standards of 
collegiality, of decency and respect for 
each other and for the rule of law itself 
convinced Members over centuries—lit-
erally centuries—to defer to each other 
in at least their opportunity to propose 
and vote on amendments. In recent 
years, we have seen this deteriorate. 
We have seen it deteriorate, sadly, 
under the leadership of Republicans 
and Democrats alike. We have seen it 
deteriorate at the expense of the rep-
resentation of each individual State. 
This simply isn’t acceptable, that we 
would get to this point in legislation 
and we would be unable to vote on or 
consider basic amendments to so im-
portant a law. They are asking us to 
reauthorize these expiring provisions— 
provisions with profound implications 
not only for national security but also 
for privacy, which are part of the same 
cohesive whole—and they are asking us 
to reauthorize those until December of 
2023 with only minimal reforms—re-
forms that, I would add, are modest at 
best, that are perhaps well-intentioned 
in some ways, but the Pelosi-Nadler- 
Schiff bill doesn’t cut the mustard. It 
doesn’t do the job. 
I have just asked for six amend-
ments. That was too many. And I have 
asked for five amendments, and that 
was too many. Surely they are not sug-
gesting that we can’t ask for any 
amendments, because if they did, that 
would be patently ridiculous. That 
would be uncollegial. That would be 
uncivil. It would be unsenatorial. So 
we will try this again. We will see what 
we can do with four. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of the Senate 
bill at the desk providing for a 45-day 
extension of FISA. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. Further, 
I ask that at a time to be determined 
by the majority leader, in consultation 
with the Democratic leader, the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of H.R. 
6172 and that the only amendments in 
order be four amendments offered by 
the following Senators: Senators LEE, 
LEAHY, DAINES, WYDEN, and PAUL. I 
further ask that upon disposition of 
the amendments, the bill, as amended, 
if amended, be read a third time and 
that the Senate vote on the bill, as 
amended, if amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BURR. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this is the 
natural product of the American people 
being asked again and again to simply 
accept that this is how things will op-
erate. The American people are told to 
just settle—to settle for budgets that 
don’t balance or come anywhere close 
to it; to settle for a government that 
spies on you, that lies to you, that 
overreaches, and a legislative branch 
that is somehow all too content and 
seemingly eager and willing to allow 
and perpetuate and even expand those 
authorities. 
This is unacceptable. We shouldn’t 
settle. We shouldn’t settle for an over-
reaching government. We should ex-
pect a government that respects the 
letter and spirit of the Fourth Amend-
ment. We shouldn’t settle for a Senate 
in which the rights of individual Sen-
ators—a bipartisan group of Senators 
that has been trying for years to just 
have a vote on a few reasonable amend-
ments—would be shut out. We should 
expect an open, robust debate, discus-
sion, and amendment process. 
Don’t settle for any of this. You 
should expect more. We should all ex-
pect freedom. We should all expect de-
bate and liberty and the protection of 
your fundamental rights as American 
citizens. 
So we will try this again, rolling the 
number down to an absolute bare min-
imum number of three amendments. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of the Senate 
bill at the desk providing for a 45-day 
extension of FISA. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the

following 
Senators: 
Senators 
LEE, 
LEAHY, DAINES, WYDEN, and PAUL. I 
further ask that upon disposition of 
the amendments, the bill, as amended, 
if amended, be read a third time and 
that the Senate vote on the bill, as 
amended, if amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BURR. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. 
LEE. 
Mr. 
President, 
earlier 
today, when the President of the 
United States issued a statement about 
the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill purporting 
to but utterly failing to meaningfully 
reform the three expiring foreign intel-
ligence 
surveillance 
provisions 
at 
issue, the President expressed grave 
concern over the process. He expressed 
grave concern over the content of the 
Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill, which the 
Senate reviewed, voted on, passed with-
out amendment, without adequate de-
bate, violating the House of Represent-
atives’ own 72-hour rule in order to get 
there. Perhaps he was talking about 
that, or perhaps he was talking about 
the fact that the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff 
bill really doesn’t fix the problem. In 
fact, look at the fact that there was 
overt, politically motivated targeting 
that took place against the President 
of the United States. 
Now, look, I know—I know—those 
were different provisions under title I 
of the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act. I get that. But it is still part 
of the same legislative package. It is 
still part of the same set of laws we are 
concerned about here. The only time 
where we have the meaningful oppor-
tunity to take a deep breath and de-
bate, discuss, and possibly amend these 
provisions is when they are set to ex-
pire. 
I referred earlier to the USA FREE-
DOM Act, which I authored and spon-
sored, along with my distinguished 
friend and colleague Senator LEAHY, 
the senior Senator from Vermont, back 
in 2015. That was brought about as a re-
sult of and during the moment when we 
were approaching the expiration of 
these very same provisions. 
That is how we bring about reforms. 
In fact, we brought about some reforms 
in that very legislation that were out-
side the narrow context of the three ex-
piring provisions in question. There is 
no rule, no law etched in stone, written 
into the rules of the Senate, the Con-
stitution, or anything else that tells us 
that we cannot, that we may not, that 
we should not edit or amend or recon-
sider any provision outside the narrow 
expiring provisions that we are facing 
with FISA. Quite to the contrary, we 
have a pattern and practice in the past 
that has established that this is the 
way we do things. 
Look, in fairness, I wish we debated 
and 
discussed 
and 
amended 
these 
things a whole lot more because these 
laws are really messed up. We ought to 
be reviewing them and updating them a 
lot more often—not because the people 
implementing them are bad. Maybe 
some of them are. I don’t know them. 
They have done some bad things, some 
of them. I am sure there are a lot of 
people who have access to these tools 
who 
are 
hard-working, 
well-inten-
tioned, well educated, and highly spe-
cialized. I am even willing to assume 
most of them fit that description and 
wouldn’t ever knowingly, intentionally 
violate that law. But the fact is, the 
law has been violated. There are very 
few instances that we actually know 
about. Why? Well, because this whole 
thing operates under the veil of se-
crecy. 
Sunlight illuminates and it also dis-
infects, and the opposite happens when 
a court—a court charged with the sa-
cred responsibility of determining and 
in some cases limiting the rights of the 
American people, U.S. citizens—oper-
ates in secret. 
I devoted my career, prior to coming 
to the Senate, to litigation, specialized 
primarily in appellate litigation and 
dispositive motions in Federal court. 
One of the great things about the U.S.

March 12, 2020 
court system is the fact that, despite 
its flaws, I would put it up against any 
system of its kind anywhere in the 
world. The reason is, it is done, with 
very, very few, narrow, careful excep-
tions, under the light of day. Rulings, 
decisions, and judgments are made pub-
lic and are subject to appeal, usually 
on multiple levels. That is not how the 
Foreign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Court operates. It operates in secret. 
So that is one of the reasons why we 
really ought to be reviewing and updat-
ing this stuff more often, especially 
when we know there have been abuses. 
We know from the sheer breadth of 
these statutes—some of which were 
written, by the way, in the immediate 
wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As I 
mentioned earlier, I was not then a 
Member of this body. I was not a Mem-
ber of the Senate or of the House of 
Representatives. In fact, I have never 
served over there. The Senate is the 
first place and only place I have ever 
held elected office. I was an adult by 
then, and I was licensed—a practicing 
attorney by then. I remember watching 
as Congress was passing the PATRIOT 
Act and wondering why they were act-
ing so quickly—so hastily—to put so 
many words and so many pages into a 
single bill. 
I remember wondering whether they 
might, in the process of doing that, 
trample over the fundamental rights 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution 
without the American people knowing 
it. This has come to fruition over time, 
and we have seen that it has been 
abused. We know the certainty is—sure 
as we know the sun will come up to-
morrow in the East—that this will con-
tinue to happen. To what extent it con-
tinues to happen or how long it is al-
lowed to is, in many respects, up to us. 
As I said earlier, governments are 
run by human beings. Human beings, 
while 
redeemable, 
while 
generally 
good, are flawed, and they make mis-
takes. But they are much more prone 
to make mistakes when they can do so 
under cover of darkness, when they 
don’t have to answer to anybody. That 
is what is going on here. That is why I 
am so concerned about this one. That 
is why I consider it—I guess I would 
say disappointed. 
It is disappointing that this body, 
some of the most talented people I 
have ever had the pleasure of working 
with—100 Members, from 50 different 
States, each with his or her own story 
or his or her own unique perspective— 
should be asked to succumb to a proc-
ess that doesn’t allow us to have any 
input into a bill like this. 
In this case, it arose in connection 
with the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill—a 
bill that I consider inadequate. It 
draws near to the Constitution with its 
lips, metaphorically speaking, but its 
heart is far from it. It pays loose hom-
age to the notion that American citi-
zens have rights worth protecting. Yet 
its provisions are malleable and easy to 
circumvent. It functions in much the 
same way as carbon monoxide might 
operate in the human bloodstream, 
where the human body might recognize 
something, mistaking it for oxygen. 
That, by the way, is—I am told—why 
carbon monoxide is so deadly. Your 
body will tend to recognize it mistak-
enly for O2 and in some ways prefer it 
to O2, thus, starving the body of actual 
oxygen. 
When we accept something that 
looks like it does the job—and it, in 
fact, doesn’t—it can do a lot of harm in 
the process. Why? Because the Amer-
ican people and their elected Rep-
resentatives in the Senate and the 
House and in the White House then 
have the opportunity to say: Well, it 
looks like that was fixed; we can go on 
to look at something else. 
It is easy to do here because, after 
all, we have no end to problems that we 
can be worrying about. Even if this 
problem disappeared—and any of five 
others that are at the top of the list— 
we would still have thousands of others 
we could worry about. That is exactly 
why it is such a problem. 
To have a bill like the Pelosi-Nadler- 
Schiff bill rammed down our throats 
and to be told that we have to accept 
this, told that the President of the 
United States, who himself has had his 
rights violated, who himself was politi-
cally targeted under the FISA frame-
work—it is insulting to every Amer-
ican that after something like that 
happens—we know it has happened; we 
know it continues to happen; we know 
it will continue to happen—to tell us 
that we have to accept the Pelosi-Nad-
ler-Schiff response to that is simply in-
sulting. 
We shouldn’t put up with it. Presi-
dent Trump shouldn’t put up with it, 
and the American people shouldn’t. It 
is not just Republicans, and it is not 
just Democrats. This is no respecter of 
persons or of political parties. In fact, 
many of my best allies on this issue 
are, and have been, Democrats. Demo-
crats were pretty early to acknowledge 
the flaws in the PATRIOT Act and in 
provisions of FISA. 
Ever since I got here in 2011, I have 
been working across the aisle with Sen-
ator LEAHY, with Senator DURBIN, and 
with others to try to find solutions to 
these problems. 
One of the things that has happened 
in the intervening years—this is my 
10th year in the Senate—is that this 
really has become a bipartisan issue. It 
used to be me and a handful of Demo-
crats and Senator PAUL who worried 
about this. We now have a broad coali-
tion of Republicans and Democrats who 
are concerned about this. They are 
worried about it because if it can hap-
pen to the President, it can happen to 
anyone. 
The American people have been influ-
enced in so many ways by our own his-
tory, and our own history extends back 
many centuries, not just on this con-
tinent but in the United Kingdom. 
After all, it hasn’t been that many 
years since we became our own coun-
try. We existed as colonies for almost 
the same period of time that we have 
existed as a free, independent constitu-
tional Republic. 
In both sets of experiences and in ex-
periences even predating the American 
experiment in its entirety, we have 
seen there are good reasons to require 
things like search warrants. When the 
government wants to get information 
from you, when it wants to search 
through your papers, your possessions, 
your personal effects, or when it wants 
to seize you or your possessions, the 
government really needs to get a war-
rant; it needs to establish probable 
cause supporting that warrant; and it 
needs to outline with particularity the 
things that it wants to search or seize. 
It needs to do so from an independent 
magistrate. 
All of these things matter. They mat-
ter not just because they are in the 
Fourth Amendment, not just because 
they were a good idea when they were 
put in there in 1791, but because long 
before we became a country, these were 
part of the rights of English subjects, 
part of the rights that American colo-
nists had as English subjects and that 
English subjects had even back in Eng-
land. 
They, too, had a government that 
was run by mere mortals. The divine 
right of Kings notwithstanding, the 
mark was also mortal, as were the per-
sons occupying positions in Parliament 
and officers elsewhere in the govern-
ment. That is why, from time to time, 
these rights would be abused. We saw 
instances 
of 
English 
patriots—like 
John Wilkes—whose rights were vio-
lated and who sought legal recourse 
after he was subjected to unreasonable, 
warrantless, open-ended searches and 
seizures. 
John Wilkes became respected on 
both sides of the Atlantic because he 
didn’t put up with it, even though it 
cost him dearly in financial terms, so-
cially, even politically. Even though it 
caused him great pain, he fought; he 
aggressively litigated what had hap-
pened to him. That is one of the rea-
sons he became a hero on both sides of 
the Atlantic. 
We look to heroes on both sides of 
the Atlantic—people like John Wilkes 
who, notwithstanding the fact he was 
an English subject, not an American, 
he understood the English Bill of 
Rights; he understood core rights that 
were incorporated as if by reference by 
the Fourth Amendment but that were 
preexisting long before then. In fact, 
things like the warrant requirement of 
the Fourth Amendment are rights that 
everyone should be entitled to in every 
country. 
It violates logic and reason and prin-
ciples of decency and kindness to sug-
gest that a person can be arrested or 
have his or her house or effects 
searched or seized without due process 
of law and without a validly issued 
warrant bearing particularity backed 
up by probable cause. 
What, then, does this have to do with 
FISA? It has everything to do with 
FISA. It has a lot to do with it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1730 
March 12, 2020 
The Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act, as the name suggests, was 
created not to go after U.S. citizens 
but to go after foreign spies and terror-
ists—not Americans. Sadly, over time, 
as a result of the advocacy of people 
who weren’t all that afraid of Big Gov-
ernment—the advocacy and defense of 
people like Jim Comey and Robert 
Mueller—we got a sort of morphing of 
FISA into something that wasn’t fo-
cused entirely, necessarily, anymore on 
foreign 
intelligence 
gathering, 
on 
agents of a foreign power, on terrorists, 
but could be used even with respect to 
U.S. citizens. This isn’t right. In our 
hearts, we know it is not right. 
In our hearts, we should certainly 
know that it is not right when we have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
consider 
some 
amendments—one of the amendments 
that I have proposed—and a key part of 
the Lee-Leahy reform. We provide 
something that I don’t think would be 
shocking to any American citizen. In 
fact, I think any American citizen 
would be shocked not by the fact of its 
being introduced but by the fact that it 
is not already law. It would say that if 
they want to go after an American—if 
they know that the subject in question, 
the target of their investigation is, in 
fact, an American—there ought to be 
added procedural protections attached 
to their investigation of that person; 
that if they get a court order under 
section 215 allowing them to search for 
and gain access to any ‘‘tangible 
things’’—any of a whole category of 
business records—they really ought to 
have to satisfy a different, slightly 
higher standard than they would if the 
person were a spy from a foreign coun-
try or a foreign terrorist or something 
like that. There are certain rights that 
do inhere in the fact that you are an 
American. That is not unreasonable. In 
fact, I am not sure I know any Amer-
ican citizen outside of Washington, DC, 
who would even have a moment’s pause 
with that, other than to say: Why on 
Earth is that not already law? 
I am also convinced that most Amer-
icans would respond to the beefed-up 
amicus curiae provisions. Remember, 
‘‘amicus curiae’’ is a Latin term that 
means friend of the court. It refers to 
the fact that within the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court, you have 
no jury, you have no opposing counsel, 
you don’t have a court reporter who is 
going to report anything in public. 
You, instead, have total secrecy. Our 
FISA provisions would expand our ami-
cus curiae provisions, would expand the 
circumstances in which the FISA Court 
must appoint a friend of the court—or 
amicus curiae—just to argue the other 
side. This doesn’t even really limit 
their power. It just says: Let’s bring 
somebody else into the room—some-
body else who can be trusted, who has 
security clearance, but who can pro-
vide a different perspective. 
Most Americans—in fact, I would say 
probably every American I know out-
side of Washington, DC—would say 
there is nothing unreasonable about 
that. In fact, what is unreasonable is 
the fact that that would require an 
amendment—a 
change—to 
existing 
law. 
Another one of the provisions that 
we want to amend deals with what we 
call exculpatory evidence. When apply-
ing for a court order from the FISA 
Court under section 215, the govern-
ment should have a responsibility to 
disclose evidence that would be excul-
patory or would show that the person 
being investigated might not have ac-
tually done the thing they did or that 
they might have flawed information on 
their hands. 
We know that some of this has oc-
curred or government agents have gone 
before the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Court and failed to disclose 
meaningful material facts that, if 
known, would have at least been mate-
rial to the court and probably been de-
terminative and resulted in the court’s 
unwillingness to issue the order in 
question. I don’t think I know anyone 
outside of this town who would say 
that is unreasonable to request. 
Senators PAUL and WYDEN have a few 
other amendments. One deals with lim-
iting the government’s ability, through 
section 215, to gain access to your 
browser history and another addressing 
the power of the Attorney General to 
make some of these approvals. Those 
are amendments that have been pro-
posed by Senators WYDEN and DAINES. 
Then we have an amendment from 
Senator PAUL that would propose that 
across the board in all of the different 
provisions of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act—whether it is 215 or 
702 or title I or some other provision— 
that if you are investigating a known 
American citizen, you have a higher 
standard, and you probably need to go 
to a regular court rather than a secret 
Foreign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Court which, in most respects, doesn’t 
even meet the definition of court. 
In response to some of these, oppo-
nents—defenders of the deep state— 
might well glibly conclude: Well, there 
is no reason for you to impose a higher 
standard or for you to impose anything 
remotely resembling probable cause be-
cause, after all, in other contexts, the 
government can gain access to business 
records 
without 
showing 
probable 
cause. 
While this is true in many cir-
cumstances, first of all, it ignores the 
fact that recent jurisprudence from the 
Supreme Court of the United States— 
including from the Carpenter case— 
makes clear that just because some-
thing has a business record maintained 
in the ordinary course of business, that 
doesn’t mean the person to whom it 
pertains has no reasonable expectation 
of privacy in it. In some cases, it 
doesn’t. 
We are no longer dealing with the old 
jurisprudence of Smith v. Maryland, 
unadorned by more recent develop-
ments like Carpenter. Under Smith, 
they were dealing with the collection 
from a pen register—the collection of 
an old-style landline telephone that 
spat out the numbers that were called 
and being called to and from the num-
ber of the line in question. Modern 
business records disclose a heck of a lot 
more personal detail than that. I sus-
pect if Smith v. Maryland—the one 
dealing with the pen register and the 
landline telephone business records—if 
that were decided today, it might well 
have been decided very differently 
today than it would have been then, 
but, certainly, with respect to many 
categories of business records, there is 
a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
There is some expectation of some pri-
vacy buried within that, and we can’t 
conclude otherwise. 
Secondly, separate and apart from 
developments in the law that ought to 
cause us to view with some suspicion 
the government’s open-ended ability 
with a mere subpoena to show rel-
evance to and therefore access to cer-
tain categories of business records—un-
like those circumstances where some-
one could go into a regular court, 
whether a civil or a criminal pro-
ceeding, and get a subpoena based on a 
mere relevance standard without prob-
able cause—in those circumstances, at 
least, there is more of an opportunity 
for somebody to respond. In many 
cases, that somebody might be the cus-
todian of the records of the business 
entity in question, whether it is the 
mobile telephone services operator, the 
internet service provider, or the owner 
of the car rental facility, the storage 
unit facility—whatever it is, there is 
some opportunity for that business en-
terprise to go into court to try to 
quash the subpoena, to argue that the 
government doesn’t, in fact, have a 
need for it; that it doesn’t need to 
produce it to defend its own business 
interests, if not those also of its own 
customers. 
In some circumstances, there is also 
an opportunity for the person in ques-
tion to be notified independently to ob-
ject to or in other ways—one way or 
another—respond to the government’s 
desire to gain access to those business 
records. By contrast, under the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court, you 
don’t have that ability. That is why we 
need special protections here. 
Look, it is not hard for the govern-
ment to have to follow basic principles 
of due process. It is not hard for the 
government to have to show probable 
cause. In most circumstances, this can 
be done in a manner of minutes. No one 
has ever demonstrated, to my satisfac-
tion, why—especially where, as in the 
case of my probable cause amendment, 
with the requirement that they satisfy 
that standard only when they are in 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court and they are going after a record 
pertaining to a known U.S. person—it 
would still allow them to go after other 
records pertaining to other people 
without that knowledge and, if they 
didn’t know someone was a U.S. per-
son, they wouldn’t have to satisfy it. 
But even that is apparently unac-
ceptable to the self-proclaimed masters

of the universe who now dominate the 
Senate and refuse utterly to recognize 
the article VI-mandated expectation 
and constitutional mandate of equal 
representation among the States in the 
Senate. 
This 
is 
unacceptable. 
We 
have 
reached a point where we don’t have 
the expectation that we can rely on 
what comes out of committee because, 
very often, what comes out of com-
mittee isn’t even what is considered 
here. 
We had this Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill 
come out Tuesday night. It was passed 
the next day by the House of Rep-
resentatives. I understand why a sim-
ple majority of the House of Represent-
atives might well decide to defer to 
Speaker PELOSI and JERRY NADLER and 
ADAM
SCHIFF. After all, PELOSI
and 
NADLER and SCHIFF, themselves, run a 
very substantial portion of the Demo-
cratic Party’s operations in the House 
of Representatives. I understand why a 
whole lot of Members would like to 
defer to them. 
What I don’t understand is, No. 1, 
why Republicans in the House of Rep-
resentatives would want to defer to 
PELOSI and NADLER and SCHIFF, nor do 
I understand why—even if some Repub-
licans in the House of Representatives 
would foolishly defer to PELOSI and 
NADLER and SCHIFF—why that in any 
way, shape, or form binds me or anyone 
else in this body to do what PELOSI, 
NADLER, and SCHIFF decided to do. We 
are not a rubberstamp. We are not a 
rubberstamp for the House of Rep-
resentatives. We are certainly not a 
rubberstamp for the deep state. 
This gives me some hope, I suppose. 
This gives me some hope that, given 
the fact that the President of the 
United States is willing to acknowl-
edge that FISA isn’t perfect and that 
the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill passed by 
the House of Representatives yester-
day—without having gone through any 
terribly thorough process and without 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives having had access to it for more 
than about 24 hours when they passed 
it—the fact that the President of the 
United States was willing to openly, 
publicly, today call into question the 
wisdom of the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill 
gives me some encouragement. It gives 
me some encouragement that some of 
my colleagues here in the Senate 
might see fit to claim the privileges at-
tached to their election certificate, to 
recognize that we are not all just func-
tionaries of our respective party lead-
ers in the House and in the Senate; 
that we are answerable to our own con-
stituents to defend the Constitution in 
the manner we deem appropriate and 
necessary under the circumstances. 
I hope—I expect that this body will 
do the right thing. I think it would be 
a shame—I think it is a shame to let 
three of these three provisions expire 
and just let them hang out there with 
the uncertainty that Senator BURR so 
thoughtfully pointed out will be the 
product of these provisions expiring. 
We don’t need to do that. 
We have had years and years and 
years to address this, and we have re-
fused—we have deliberately declined; 
we have been recklessly indifferent 
with respect to the need to reform 
these provisions. If not us, who? If not 
now, when? 
I have no interest in continuing to 
punt this thing over and over again. 
This is like Charlie Brown going after 
that same football with the same Lucy, 
who moves the darn football every 
time he gets close to it. This isn’t ac-
ceptable. I have great confidence in my 
colleagues that a few of us—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—will come 
forward and say: No, not on my watch, 
not anymore. This is not how the Sen-
ate is going to operate. 
This is just within a few days when 
we have seen a few unfortunate things 
happen—things that are themselves 
symptoms of the same underlying prob-
lem. I don’t mean FISA, specifically. I 
am talking about something much 
broader than FISA. I am talking about 
the deviation from the norms of cour-
tesy that have come to define this body 
over the centuries. 
My friend, the distinguished col-
league from Louisiana, Senator KEN-
NEDY, had an amendment he wanted 
considered and voted on last week in 
connection with the Energy bill. I dis-
agreed with that amendment. I would 
have voted against it. In fact, I would 
have voted against it and spoken 
against it on the floor. I really didn’t 
like it, but he had an amendment he 
wanted considered. He was shut out un-
fairly and unreasonably. He was denied 
the opportunity to have that amend-
ment considered. He wasn’t even given 
adequate 
notice 
of 
his 
procedural 
rights that would come into play when 
the person—the Senator who had intro-
duced an amendment—came down to 
the floor to amend her previous amend-
ment and to use it as basically a man-
agers’ package, keeping Senator KEN-
NEDY’s amendment out of that pack-
age, thus effectively denying him the 
opportunity to receive adequate con-
sideration of his own amendment. He 
wasn’t given notice. 
Because he wasn’t given notice, he 
missed out on the opportunity to do 
what he inevitably could have done and 
would have done, so long as he could 
have come down here with 10 other 
Senators—a combined total of 11 Sen-
ators—sustaining him for his proce-
dural right to call for the yeas and 
nays on the original amendment intro-
duced by Senator MURKOWSKI. We could 
have voted on that amendment, and 
she wouldn’t have been able to insert 
that managers’ package on her own 
without that intervening call for the 
yeas and nays on her original amend-
ment. 
This is one of many examples that— 
while probably painfully boring to the 
average American—should be deeply 
disturbing to any American who knows 
about, who cares about, who yearns for 
the freedom that comes from our rep-
resentative government; that expects 
that people elected to make laws will 
actually be participating in that proc-
ess and not simply dictated to by two 
leaders—one Republican and one Demo-
cratic—in each House of Congress. 
Yet another manifestation of that— 
one that has sadly become sort of one 
installment in many series, like a set 
of sequel movies—is what happens basi-
cally every time we have a spending 
bill. 
To cite one example that occurred 
nearly 2 years ago, for many months 
we had been waiting to see when we 
would have the opportunity to debate, 
discuss, amend, and vote on a spending 
bill in the early months of 2018. It 
would be the first real spending bill 
that we had the opportunity to con-
sider since the 45th President of the 
United States was sworn in, in January 
of 2017. We had been told by our respec-
tive party leaders in both Houses of 
Congress to wait for it; you will get the 
chance to review it; you will get the 
chance to debate it and amend it. 
Then, one evening on a Wednesday in 
March of 2018, I received an email. It 
was 8:37 p.m. That email was from Re-
publican leadership addressed to Re-
publican Senators, saying: Attached is 
a spending bill that we are going to be 
addressing. 
I thought: Good. This is what we 
have been waiting for, for months. I fi-
nally get to see it. 
I opened it up. It was 2,232 pages long. 
It spent, as I recall, $1.2 or $1.3 trillion. 
I immediately distributed it to mem-
bers of my staff who worked through 
the night, splitting it up, figuring out 
what 
each 
provision 
meant—recog-
nizing that a 2,232 page Senate appro-
priations bill doesn’t read like a fast- 
paced novel. It doesn’t read like a 
newspaper. It is a very slow and cum-
bersome process, one that involves 
countless cross-references to statutory 
provisions that wouldn’t be recogniz-
able to most ordinary Americans, so it 
takes a lot of time to review it. 
My staff, after working on it through 
the night and through the next day, 
was as shocked as I was to see that the 
House of Representatives passed that 
bill—the same 2,232-page-long bill that 
most Members saw for the first time at 
8:37 p.m. the previous night. The House 
of Representatives passed that bill be-
fore lunch the next day. The Senate— 
this body—convened in the middle of 
the night the following evening and 
passed it with not one amendment, not 
one change from one Member of this 
body. 
When we outsource things to the so- 
called four corners—the Republican 
and Democratic leaders of both Houses 
of Congress—everybody else gets shut 
out. This might be really good for you 
if you are from one of those States rep-
resented by one of those four corners, 
but it is really bad for everybody else. 
I don’t mean that it is bad for the 
Members; I mean every single person 
represented by someone else other than 
those people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1732 
March 12, 2020 
At the end of the day, it is not their 
fault. It is not the fault of the four cor-
ners so much as it is our fault. They 
are doing what they have to do. They 
are doing the job the way they know 
how do it, the way they have learned 
how to do it, the way we have trained 
them to do it, sadly enough. We have 
let them do it that way, so they do. I 
am sure it is not easy to do it that 
way, but it is probably less hard than 
every other way out there. In that re-
spect, I don’t blame them for doing it 
that way. I blame us. 
Shame on us for passing that bill 
without any one of us having had the 
opportunity to read the whole darned 
thing except for maybe four Members. 
Between 435 Representatives and 100 
Senators, you maybe had 4 Members 
total who knew what was in there and 
had control over it. Shame on us for 
passing it anyway. 
After those in the House of Rep-
resentatives see for the first time the 
Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill less than 24 
hours before they vote on it and pass 
it—a bill purporting to reform FISA 
while failing to actually do so in a 
meaningful way—shame on them. If we 
pass it over here, shame on us. The 
shame is especially acute if we don’t 
even try, which is what we are being 
asked to do here. We are being asked to 
defer, to let somebody else do the legis-
lating. 
By the way, just as we were told 
when approaching that spending bill, 
as with most other spending bills in 
the 9 years I have been here, that we 
have to leave them to the experts— 
don’t worry about this; this is for the 
Appropriations Committee’s chairman, 
for the subcommittee chairmen, for the 
majority and minority leaders from the 
two Houses of Congress and basically 
for no one else; leave it to the experts— 
we are now being told to leave it to the 
experts here, which begs the question: 
What meaningful role do we play? Have 
we really rendered ourselves that insig-
nificant that we are not even willing to 
defend our own right to raise our own 
ideas and our own concerns with some-
thing as profoundly significant and po-
tentially impactful on the liberties of 
every single American—old and young, 
White and Black, male and female and 
of any station, rich or poor? These pro-
visions—make no mistake—have the 
potential to affect every single one of 
us. Shame on us if we don’t even try to 
make it better. 
So I am not going to blame this one 
on PELOSI, NADLER, and SCHIFF. They 
can choose to pass an unwise bill, if 
they want to, that doesn’t fix the prob-
lem, but I don’t work for PELOSI or 
NADLER or SCHIFF. I work for the peo-
ple of Utah. I was elected by the voters 
in the sovereign State of Utah, who ex-
pected me to come here and represent 
them. 
By the way, this is an issue that is 
neither liberal nor conservative. It is 
neither Democratic nor Republican. 
This is not a partisan issue. In fact, the 
amendments that I am talking about 
here are bipartisan. This is simply an 
American issue. It is a constitutional 
issue. It is an issue pertaining to and 
inextricably intertwined with the basic 
dignity of the eternal human soul. 
We can’t pass this thing while pre-
tending to be concerned about the 
rights of the American people, not un-
less we at least try to pretend like we 
are doing our job, not unless we at 
least try to pretend like we are trying 
to make it better. Even if you don’t 
think FISA has been abused—if you do, 
by the way, that is absurdly, insanely 
naive, but I respect your right to be 
wrong; I respect your right to agree 
with PELOSI, NADLER, and SCHIFF on 
that front if that is how you feel— 
there have to be other ways in which 
you might acknowledge you can make 
this bill better. 
Maybe you are somebody who trusts 
the government way too much. Maybe 
you are somebody who thinks the gov-
ernment ought to be given more power. 
Maybe you are somebody who trusts 
the government when it makes allega-
tions that somebody is an agent of a 
foreign power or is working for an 
agent of a foreign power or is a ter-
rorist or has had some unkind thoughts 
toward another person. Even if you 
trust the government that much, you 
shouldn’t, and what you would be sug-
gesting would be unconstitutional. Yet, 
even if you were, then shame on you 
for not wanting to make this bill even 
more aggressive toward giving the gov-
ernment power. 
It is simply too grand a proposition 
to suggest that it is mere coincidence 
that the exact, magical combination of 
factors, of provisions that should have 
been included in this law—in the minds 
of every Member of the U.S. Senate— 
happened to materialize under the um-
brella of the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill 
that was passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives yesterday. That is just ab-
surd. I mean, come on. Are you telling 
me that you can’t find a single provi-
sion that you think couldn’t have been 
written better? 
Some in that position of still oppos-
ing it might say: Well, yes, but we have 
other things to do. 
That is true. That is exactly why I 
am trying to provide 45 additional days 
for us to debate and discuss other 
issues first and then to fix FISA later. 
I would be willing to cleanly reauthor-
ize the three expiring provisions so 
that nobody would have to deal with 
any uncertainty and so that the Amer-
ican people would not have to be put in 
jeopardy, neither their security nor 
their privacy, both of which are part of 
the same cohesive, continuous whole. 
Neither one of them has to be under-
mined. Yet that is what they insist we 
do. They insist that. 
So the argument might go: We have 
other things to do. 
Well, if you have other things to do, 
then let’s punt this for 45 days, and 
let’s just agree that we are going to 
vote on some things. Yet that is too 
much for them to suggest. 
To the extent their argument is that 
we are too busy to do this right now, 
then I would ask this question: Why? 
What are you doing right now? What 
better thing does any Member of the 
U.S. Senate have to do right now, at 
this moment, at 4:54 p.m., than to 
stand up and defend and debate the 
rights and the significance of the 
rights of the American people? 
I mean, I genuinely would like to 
know what is so compelling that makes 
it so that we can’t even debate these 
things right now. In fact, in the time I 
have been speaking today, we could 
have easily voted on these very same 
amendments. We could have brought 
them up. We could have, and I would 
have agreed to have limited our debate 
to only a few minutes apiece. As we 
saw during the impeachment trial a 
few weeks ago, we are actually capable 
of casting votes and completing them 
within 6, 7, 8 minutes if we stand at at-
tention or sit at our seats and listen as 
our names are called and then vote. 
What, I would ask, is so compelling? Do 
people have appointments for haircuts 
or manicures? Do they have to go to 
the dog groomers’? I really would like 
to know what is so compelling that 
makes it so we can’t debate something 
as fundamental as how to improve the 
safety and privacy of the American 
people. 
I close by pointing out something 
that my friend and distinguished col-
league, the senior Senator from North 
Carolina, said a few minutes ago about 
the fact of his almost ensuring that the 
program at issue—the program sup-
ported by the three expiring provi-
sions—will go dark by his objecting to 
my series of unanimous consent re-
quests and about the fact that, as a re-
sult of his objection, not only is he es-
sentially guaranteeing these programs 
will now go dark, but he is also guaran-
teeing, when we come back in just a 
few days from now—because whatever 
it is that we have to do in the next few 
days is apparently so important, and I 
really would like to know what that is 
that is so important that we can’t do 
this—we are going to have to turn to 
this when we could have gotten it done 
today instead of turning to other press-
ing issues in front of us, issues dealing 
with 
emergencies 
created 
by 
the 
coronavirus. We could have, should 
have, would have otherwise been able 
to have turned to those things imme-
diately. Instead, we will be stuck on 
this for days. I mean, this can end up 
taking many days—a week or so—if it 
is drawn out sufficiently. 
The program goes dark, and we lose 
the opportunity to debate, discuss, and 
enact other legislation—all because we 
have colleagues who decide they know 
better. It is not so much that they 
know better but that Representatives 
PELOSI, NADLER, and SCHIFF know bet-
ter. It is their bill. Everybody else just 
voted for it. 
Now we are all asked to vote for it, 
and we are told to mind our own busi-
ness, to butt out, because our Big

March 12, 2020 
Brother—the 
brooding, 
omnipresent 
Federal Government—knows better. It 
can be trusted. Trust Big Brother. 
Sure, he is going to spy on you, but his 
intentions are good. Sure, he is going 
to spy on you, but he is really just hop-
ing to go after the bad guys so that you 
don’t have to worry about the fact he is 
spying on your neighbor, on your con-
stituents, on innocent Americans. 
Even if I am wrong—let’s say, for a 
minute, that somehow I am mistaken 
in concluding that any of this will ever 
be abused—you can’t really get around 
the fact that it has been abused. We 
know of circumstances in which it has 
been. We know that the President of 
the United States has himself been the 
target of abuse under this. 
Yet set that aside for a minute. Even 
under the absurd proposition that none 
of this will ever be abused again and 
that PELOSI and NADLER and SCHIFF 
have somehow found the magical for-
mula that will forever guarantee these 
expiring provisions from being abused 
again, why wouldn’t you still want to 
make the bill better? Why would you 
be willing to let those provisions go 
dark? Why would you be willing to 
postpone the consideration of other 
pressing business before the U.S. Sen-
ate? Is it really that important to shut 
out of debate your opponents who hap-
pen to disagree with you? What does 
this say about the next thing we will 
consider or the next thing after that? 
This doesn’t end well. We know it 
doesn’t end well. It never, ever works 
to push U.S. Senators to the point that 
they are told they are not entitled to 
their own opinions; that to the extent 
they have them, they may express 
them but only in a brief period of time; 
and that they then have to run off and 
be good little boys and girls and let the 
adults take over. No. I know that this 
is the way it has been working for a 
while, but it is not going to anymore. 
It is not going to anymore because the 
American people are demanding more. 
They are demanding better. Things 
sometimes have to get a little worse 
before they get better. Unfortunately, 
that is the position in which we now 
find ourselves. They have gotten worse, 
but they have gotten worse in a way 
that the American people are now no-
ticing and are going to say: Don’t do 
this anymore. Don’t lock us out of the 
process. Don’t tell us we don’t matter. 
Don’t tell us that our own elected Sen-
ators can’t have a voice and that they 
won’t get a vote and that they cannot 
debate it. 
The President of the United States 
has been targeted unethically, unlaw-
fully, unscrupulously by the deep state. 
We have the opportunity to fix that, to 
make sure it doesn’t happen to this 
President or any future President or 
any U.S. citizen regardless of how rich 
or poor or powerful or powerless. We 
must fix it. Shame on all of us if we 
don’t. Our oath to uphold, protect, and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States requires this. The American 
people deserve more, and they deserve 
better, and we must provide it.

OFFICER

BRAUN). The Democratic leader. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
SCHUMER BILL 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
moment, Democrats will ask the Sen-
ate’s consent to take up and pass sev-
eral measures that would immediately 
help American workers and American 
families cope with the impacts of 
coronavirus, including paid sick leave 
for workers, emergency unemployment 
insurance, and much needed assistance 
to States overburdened by Medicaid 
costs, known as FMAP. 
These provisions are all included in 
legislation that will soon be passed by 
the House. Many of these policies have 
already been enacted by other coun-
tries dealing more successfully with 
the coronavirus than our country is. 
These policies are targeted directly 
at the workers and families impacted 
by its spread. They are not going to the 
big, wealthy corporations or powerful 
people or wealthy people. They are 
going right at the workers and fami-
lies—average working people who need 
the help. 
Now, the Republican leader this 
morning called these provisions ‘‘an 
ideological wish list.’’ President Trump 
referred to them as ‘‘goodies.’’ 
If helping a construction worker who 
is laid off as a result of the virus is 
part of an ideological wish list, then 
God help those who believe that. If giv-
ing infected workers paid sick leave is 
a goody, then God help those who think 
that. If making sure our States, local-
ities, hospitals, and first responders are 
compensated for their efforts is ideo-
logical, is a goody, those who believe 
those things have lost touch with the 
needs and aspirations of the American 
people, and they need to talk to some 
real people who have been impacted by 
the coronavirus, instead of sitting in 
their ideological towers. 
With the comments made by the 
President and the Republican leader, 
they have revealed their own ide-
ology—that even in a time of public 
crisis and need, the President and the 
Republican leader are more willing to 
entertain corporate tax cuts and bail-
ing out industries than helping Amer-
ican workers and families. 
The Senate should pass these bills 
today. The Republican leader should 
not be sending the Senate home for the 
weekend without taking action to help 
people who are or will soon be really 
hurting. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of the Schumer 
bill that is at the desk, that the bill be 
considered read three times and passed, 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, this con-
cept is under discussion, and it is a 
centerpiece of negotiations between 
the House Democrats and Secretary 
Mnuchin, which are ongoing. 
This Chamber will be in session next 
week to ensure that we are taking 
needed actions to appropriately re-
spond to the coronavirus. 
I object.

tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3497 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 3497, submitted earlier 
today; that the bill be considered read 
three times and passed and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, this con-
cept is also under discussion and the 
centerpiece of negotiations between 
House 
Democrats 
and 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, which are ongoing. 
This Chamber will be in session next 
week to ensure that we are taking 
needed actions to appropriately re-
spond to the coronavirus. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3415 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is 
simple. We need people who are sick to 
stay home if we have any hope of slow-
ing the spread of this virus, but, today, 
one in four private sector workers in 
our country cannot stay home from 
work without losing a day’s pay or po-
tentially a job. 
We have got to fight this virus with 
everything we have—every single one 
of us—and that means we have to have 
policies in place that help people make 
the right choices for themselves, their 
families, and their communities. 
Our bill will give all employees 14 
paid sick days immediately—today, not 
next week, not the week after, today— 
in public health emergencies like this 
one, in addition to allowing them to 
accrue 7, meaning it would help work-
ers and communities right now. 
I urge Senate Republicans: Treat this 
like the public health crisis it is. Allow 
parents, families, businesses, commu-
nities to have the peace of mind to 
know that we are acting today and 
take this urgent needed step. This is 
nothing short of a chance to save lives 
and buy desperately needed time to 
fight this virus. Please don’t waste it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1734 
March 12, 2020 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3415—this is a bill that will allow 
Americans to earn paid sick time so 
they can address their own health 
needs and the health needs of their 
families—that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration, the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, we have a 
paid family leave provision in law al-
ready, and the rules are in place from 
Treasury. We received those in Sep-
tember. I worked on this provision dur-
ing tax reform, and I would certainly 
be happy to work with the Senator 
from Washington and my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle in a bipar-
tisan manner to extend the program 
that we have in law already that will 
help families. This is a public health 
emergency. It is ready. It is there. We 
need to work on it together. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3372 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to call up and pass legislation to 
keep the American people safe. 
The number of coronavirus cases in 
the United States is now over 1,000, in-
cluding 10 confirmed cases in my home 
State of Nebraska. 
In China, there are over 80,000 cases 
and over 3,000 people have died. The 
Hubei Province, which contains the 
city where the virus originated, has 
been under lockdown since last Janu-
ary, quarantining an unprecedented 56 
million people. Italy, a country of 60 
million people, is completely shut 
down. The World Health Organization 
has now declared that this outbreak is 
a pandemic, meaning it will likely 
spread to all countries on Earth. 
Dr. Fauci echoed this yesterday in 
his testimony before the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee. We will 
see more cases, and things will con-
tinue to get worse. 
As the virus spreads, our healthcare 
providers and emergency responders 
are at the forefront of this health cri-
sis. When someone tests positive for 
this disease, our emergency responders 
are the first ones there transporting 
them to the hospital. At the hospitals, 
medical personnel, doctors, nurses, and 
technicians are all working around the 
clock to provide lifesaving care and 
treat this illness. These people—our 
healthcare providers and emergency re-
sponders—need access to the proper 
equipment so they can stay healthy. 
We can take action right here right 
now to make sure that that happens. 
I introduced this bipartisan bill with 
the senior Senator from Arizona. It 
would update our current law to ensure 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers have access to respiratory protec-
tive 
devices, 
specifically, 
standard 
N95s. 
Under current law, the Federal Gov-
ernment can give targeted liability 
protection to people and entities to 
make, distribute, and administer cer-
tain drugs and protective equipment 
that are needed in a public health 
emergency. While surgical N95s are eli-
gible for this protection, standard N95s 
are not. That doesn’t make sense, and 
it doesn’t make sense for two reasons. 
First, these devices are the same 
when it comes to protecting against 
airborne contaminants like we are 
dealing with for coronavirus. Second, 
the CDC has issued guidance listing 
standard N95s among the recommended 
products for use in this emergency. 
That makes it more difficult for the 
people and entities supplying, distrib-
uting, and manufacturing this equip-
ment to do so, and we need to change 
that. 
We need to make sure that these de-
vices are readily available, and this 
legislation has bipartisan support in 
this body, and it has bipartisan support 
in the House. It was introduced by my 
colleague from Nebraska, Congressman 
DON BACON. 
The White House supports it. Vice 
President PENCE said on Tuesday this 
legislation is ‘‘important . . . to ensure 
that our healthcare workers are prop-
erly protected and outfitted.’’ 
I mentioned that this bill has bipar-
tisan support. I want to be clear that 
our hard-fought progress on this legis-
lation would not have been made if it 
weren’t for the tireless work of my 
good friend, the senior Senator from 
Arizona. So I thank her for her efforts 
and her partnership. 
We know that coronavirus is moving 
fast, and we owe it to America’s 
healthcare providers and our first re-
sponders who are fighting to stay 
ahead of this. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions 
Committee 
be 
discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3372 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Fischer substitute 
amendment at the desk be agreed to; 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read the third time and passed; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I certainly ap-
preciate what my colleague from Ne-
braska is trying to do. We are all work-
ing to do what we can to make sure our 
medical professionals, facilities, and 
the public have all the necessary equip-
ment they need to address this pan-
demic. 
My concern with my colleague’s pro-
posal, as I understand it, is that it 
would 
provide 
immunity 
for 
res-
piratory manufacturers from this point 
forward. Yes, this is a public emer-
gency and we need to respond accord-
ingly, and we certainly need to make 
sure that respirators are widely avail-
able, but let’s do this with safety in 
mind. 
I think we can come up with a bill 
that provides a more tailored approach 
to what my colleague is trying to do. 
For example, the House coronavirus 
package 
includes 
language 
which 
tracks the COVID–19 emergency coun-
termeasures declaration issued by HHS 
which would extend countermeasure 
protections through 2024, rather than it 
be open-ended. I hope my colleague will 
work with me to expand access to this 
important equipment, but for now I 
must object. 
I certainly would like to count my-
self as among those who will provide 
bipartisan support for this measure, 
but, for now, because it is totally open- 
ended, I must object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this 
bill is something I think we should all 
agree upon. Other medical device fa-
cilities, manufacturers, currently have 
this protection when there is a public 
emergency. They currently enjoy this 
protection, but this thin band of manu-
facturers, this thin band that provides 
these N95s which our healthcare pro-
viders need—and I talked to my first 
responders and firemen who were here 
this week and told them about this 
bill, and they said: We need this. We 
are transporting people to hospitals. 
In Omaha, NE, the Omaha Fire De-
partment has picked up flights of 
American citizens who were flown from 
China to be at Camp Ashland, a Na-
tional Guard facility between Lincoln 
and Omaha, and quarantined there. 
Fortunately, all were healthy, all were 
fine. 
Omaha also received 15 people from a 
cruise ship, and all those people were 
not fine. These first responders, these 
firemen from Omaha, transported them 
to a world-renowned facility, the Uni-
versity of Nebraska Medical Center, 
but they did not have the proper pro-
tection because we are arguing over 
something that other medical device 
providers currently have protection on 
during a public health crisis. 
I understand that my friends on the 
other side want to make progress on 
this issue and on other issues, but that 
shouldn’t stand in the way of getting 
this done. There is a shortage of res-
pirators, and the U.S. Senate has an 
opportunity to fix it. We have an op-
portunity to ensure the American peo-
ple stay protected and healthy during 
this public health crisis, but my col-
leagues on the other side just stopped 
this from moving forward, and the

March 12, 2020 
American people need to understand 
what just happened here. 
As a result of this objection, I get to 
tell my Omaha firefighters that their 
safety and the health and safety of our 
healthcare providers in Nebraska and 
across this country are at risk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. In response, I certainly 
am not arguing that there is not a need 
for respirators, but let me be very clear 
that this provides immunity for res-
pirator manufacturers from this point 
onward. 
Again, I need to reiterate. This has 
nothing to do with recognizing the 
need for respirators. What I am arguing 
is there should be a timeframe for this 
because this protection is supposed to 
be during a public health crisis, and I 
am saying that the way the House is 
approaching this is, they would like to 
provide this protection for respirator 
manufacturers for a period of 4 years. 
We can certainly evaluate it at that 
point. 
So, clearly, my objection does not 
mean the death knell for this amend-
ment. It means that we should work it 
out so we can provide an appropriate 
timeframe. 
So I, once again, reiterate my objec-
tion to the current form of this amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of a bill that is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the bill be considered 
read three times and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Reserving the right 
to object, the legislation that is offered 
by my colleague is too narrow in scope. 
It does not cover all respirators cur-
rently recommended by the CDC for 
healthcare professionals who are treat-
ing patients with COVID–19. My col-
leagues know that. This is inadequate. 
The legislation that the senior Sen-
ator from Arizona and I have offered 
covers 
all 
CDC-recommended 
res-
pirators. Moreover, our bill is not lim-
ited to this specific public health emer-
gency but rather responsibly addresses 
future public health respirator needs. 
We are looking at what is going to hap-
pen in the future, and right here, right 
now, the Senate does have this oppor-
tunity to address these current emer-
gencies and, yes, future emergencies by 
making sure that we can provide life-
saving equipment to the American peo-
ple. So, accordingly, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, so, once 
again, I repeat that this has nothing to 
do with stopping these respirators for 
this particular crisis to be included as 
necessary equipment under the current 
statute. I do think we ought to be able 
to come together to come up with a 
reasonable approach that can be sup-
ported in a bipartisan way. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. I would suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING CHARLES 
FREEMAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, On April 
29, 1983, Justice Charles Freeman made 
history as the first African-American 
jurist to swear in Chicago’s first, elect-
ed African-American mayor, Harold 
Washington. Justice Freeman went on 
to become the first, and so far the only, 
African-American justice to serve on 
the Illinois Supreme Court. During his 
more than four decades, Justice Free-
man helped shape Illinois’s history 
through his achievements, his jurispru-
dence, and his mentoring of a genera-
tion of new lawyers he guided to the 
bench. On March 2, he passed away, and 
I rise today to honor his memory. 
Charles Freeman was born in Rich-
mond, VA, in 1933. He was descended 
from slaves freed by Quakers before the 
Civil War. As a child, he brought news-
papers to legendary civil rights attor-
ney Oliver W. Hill’s office. His father 
was a hard-working man who loved to 
read and always stressed that he want-
ed Charles and his brother to become 
lawyers. The Freemans lived walking 
distance from Virginia Union Univer-
sity in Richmond, and that is where 
Charles and his brother went to col-
lege. Charles Freeman graduated from 
college in 1954 and served in the U.S. 
Army from 1956 to 1958, stationed in 
South Korea. After his service, he mar-
ried Marylee Voelker and moved to 
Chicago. While in Chicago, he attended 
John Marshall Law School at night, 
and he worked for the Cook County De-
partment of Public Aid. 
After law school, Justice Freeman 
started working as a precinct worker 
for former Representative Ralph H. 
Metcalfe, cofounder of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. Justice Freeman 
befriended Harold Washington while 
helping Metcalfe, and they formed a 
law practice partnership. In 1965, Gov-
ernor Otto Kerner appointed Freeman 
arbitrator for the Illinois Industrial 
Commission administrating workers’ 
compensation cases. In 1973, Governor 
Dan Walker appointed him a commis-
sioner for the Illinois Commerce Com-
mission. 
In 1976, Justice Freeman was elected 
to serve as a judge on the Cook County 
Circuit Court. In 1986, he was elected to 
the Illinois Appellate Court, and 4 
years later, he became the first African 
American elected to the Illinois Su-
preme Court. His peers chose him to 
serve as chief justice in 1997 until 2000. 
As chief justice, Freeman reorganized 
the rotation of appellate judges in the 
First Judicial District. Before, appel-
late judges sat on the same panels for

their entire careers. He helped improve 
the Family Violence Prevention Pro-
gram. Justice Freeman also improved 
the educational program for judges 
statewide and pushed for the creation 
of a special committee to study the 
death penalty and reforms. 
While Justice Freeman was a great 
jurist, his legacy is also reflected in his 
efforts to promote a diverse judiciary. 
He appointed 11 of the 16 African Amer-
icans who have served on the First Dis-
trict Appellate Court since 1990. It was 
important to him that people saw in 
the courtroom judges and lawyers that 
reflected society. He mentored so many 
in the field. 
During his career, Justice Freeman 
received many awards for his service, 
including the Freedom Award from the 
John Marshall Law School, the Sey-
mour Simon Justice Award from the 
Jewish Judges Association, the Earl 
Burrus Dickerson Award from the Chi-
cago Bar Association, and the Ira B. 
Platt 
Award 
and 
the 
Presidential 
Award from the Cook County Bar Asso-
ciation. 
Charles Freeman is survived by his 
son Kevin and daughter-in-law Cami, 
by two grandchildren, and by his broth-
er James. I want to extend my sym-
pathies to his family and loved ones. 
The loss of Justice Freeman is a loss 
for our State and for the whole coun-
try. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NORTHERN ILLINOIS 
UNIVERSITY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize the 125th anniversary 
of the founding of Northern Illinois 
University, or NIU, a renowned institu-
tion with a long record as a public re-
search university and the proud home 
of Huskies. 
Like many great State universities 
across this country, Northern Illinois 
University began as an expansion of 
the normal school program, otherwise 
commonly known as a teachers college. 
Near the end of the 19th century, as our 
Nation’s population continued to expe-
rience rapid growth, the State of Illi-
nois recognized the need to prioritize 
teacher training in Northern Illinois to 
increase access to education in the 
bourgeoning 
community. 
NIU 
was 
founded in DeKalb, IL, in 1895 to help 
more students receive a high-quality 
education, and it still serves those 
same goals today. 
NIU is a university of diversity. 
From its very first day, NIU has 
charted a course of inclusion and acces-
sibility that focused on the students 
and their education. NIU has proven its 
commitment in this area by expanding 
opportunities and pathways to college 
for students from underserved commu-
nities and to those that are the first in 
their family to attend college. Over the 
years, NIU has been at the forefront of 
recognizing the unique challenges of 
these communities and has worked 
tirelessly to identify ways to address 
them as part of its strong commitment 
to students. 
NIU is a university of opportunity. 
Today, nearly three quarters of NIU 
students fall into one or more of the 
following categories: about 45 percent 
of the students are Pell grant-eligible, 
50 percent are students of color, and 50 
percent are first-generation college 
students. I would like to commend NIU 
for its work to make higher education 
more accessible for families from all 
communities and walks of life. 
NIU is a university of excellence. NIU 
has a nationally recognized faculty 
that includes prominent experts and 
leading scholars from a variety of dis-
ciplines, including science, East Asian 
studies, and visual and performance 
arts. After receiving a first-class edu-
cation at NIU, over 200,000 alumni have 
gone on to make a difference in the 
Midwest and across the world, teaching 
people about the value of NIU as they 
do. 
The State of Illinois has been en-
riched by NIU, and I look forward to 
the school’s many contributions in the 
years ahead. It is my distinct honor to 
congratulate President Lisa Freeman 
and the entire NIU community on its 
125th anniversary. 
f 
SUNSHINE WEEK 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate a statement in 
support of Sunshine Week, an annual 
event that spotlights the key need of a 
government-transparency. 
Without 
openness and access to how all levels of 
government spend tax dollars or make 
key decisions, accountability and over-
sight will lack. 
Where 
transparency 
is 
lacking, 
waste, fraud, and duplication tend to 
proliferate. The Government Account-
ability 
Office-GAO-regularly 
cites 
‘‘lack of transparency’’ as a chronic 
problem across many agencies and pro-
grams. This can have serious con-
sequences. This causes increased tax-
payer spending and improper pay-
ments. This hinders competition. In 
turn, a lack of transparency can affect 
everything from public health to our 
national defense. 
Given the profound and far-reaching 
impacts of Federal programs and poli-
cies, the people need to know how their 
tax dollars are being spent. 
Without access to reliable, accurate 
information, how can we be sure good 
decisions are being made when it 
comes to spending the tax dollars of 
hard-working families? Sure that the 
policies we craft in this Chamber are 
working as intended? Sure that our 
limited resources go where they are 
needed most? Sure that the programs 
we create aren’t causing harm? 
Well that is why, as the chairman of 
the Budget Committee, I have focused 
the last several years on enhancing 
transparency and improving both the 
quality and quantity of data available 
for all decisionmakers. I am extremely 
gratified that my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle, along with key orga-
nizations and experts, so often join 
these efforts. 
One step in the right direction is the 
Senate Budget Committee has started 
to publish regular scorekeeping re-
ports. These are available for the pub-
lic on the committee’s website and 
track the budgetary impact of legisla-
tion approved by Congress against cur-
rent spending levels. This helps provide 
other committees, Members of Con-
gress, and taxpayers with ongoing up-
dates about the fiscal implications of 
recently agreed upon legislation. 
In 
addition, 
there 
are 
obviously 
many unknowns when it comes to 
agencies implementing the laws and 
programs already on the books. To ad-
dress this concern, I led a bipartisan 
group of 15 Senators last July, along 
with Senator LANKFORD, to urge the 
White House Office of Management and 
Budget to make a complete list of all 
Federal programs publicly available in 
a central, governmentwide website. 
This would help to identify and elimi-
nate program waste and duplication. 
Because, believe it or not, there is no 
comprehensive list of each and every 
program 
the 
Federal 
Government 
funds. It still isn’t available. 
The fact that legislators and tax-
payers don’t even know how many pro-
grams we have or what they do is trou-
bling, particularly as we continue to 
create and fund new ones. 
In the past, GAO has identified mas-
sive amounts of duplication across the 
Federal Government, including more 
than 12 programs on financial literacy, 
160 Federal housing assistance pro-
grams or activities, 94 green building 
initiatives, 253 crime prevention pro-
grams, 14 diesel emission reduction 
programs, 45 early learning and child 
care programs, and 163 STEM pro-
grams. 
Most recently, GAO’s 2019 annual re-
port on duplication found six different 
government programs engaged in quan-
tum computing research. Clearly, all of 
these programs could be improved by 
some basic coordination or consolida-
tion. 
This simple inventory has been on 
the to-do list for almost a decade. 
There have been previous attempts, but 
those have fallen short. We will con-
tinue working with GAO and OMB 
until the list is actually published. 
Most importantly, last fall, I joined 
with Senator WHITEHOUSE to introduce 
bipartisan budget process reform legis-
lation—the first bipartisan budget re-
forms approved by the Senate Budget 
Committee since 1990. 
The Bipartisan Congressional Budget 
Reform Act would increase trans-
parency in the congressional budget 
process in a number of ways—by hav-
ing Congress develop a fiscal plan that 
is easy to understand and offers the 
public a chance to view if Congress is 
living within its means, encouraging 
other committees to review the pro-
grams in their jurisdiction that are in 
most need of review, directing both 
GAO and the Congressional Budget Of-
fice to review program portfolios-port-
folios are groups of programs with

similar efforts. This has to be done on 
an ongoing basis. 
But that is not all the bill would do. 
We also need to require CBO to review 
and report to Congress on the accuracy 
of its past projections and cost esti-
mates, along with an annual plan out-
lining their efforts to enhance trans-
parency. We need to make public the 
information underlying cost estimates 
of major legislation and reports related 
to the debt-to-GDP ratio agreed upon 
in the budget resolution. We need to re-
quire CBO to provide more information 
to help better understand the true 
costs of our actions by including pro-
jected interest costs in estimates for 
mandatory spending programs, revenue 
changes, and supplemental appropria-
tions bills. 
We need CBO to include 10 years of 
cost estimates for spending subject to 
appropriations, doubling the current 
practice of 5 years. We need to bring 
budget gimmicks into the light. CBO 
would have to produce public estimates 
of appropriations legislation that in-
clude the costs associated with doling 
out money before the revenue comes 
in. We should expose gimmicks like 
budget bait and switch. 
In Washington, we like to say that 
‘‘sunlight is the best disinfectant,’’ and 
that is true, but sunlight does far more 
than disinfect. It lights the way. Open-
ing the books and reforming the budget 
process will help make us better 
equipped to face the enormous fiscal 
challenges looming just ahead. 
f 
AUSTRALIAN WILDFIRES 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, for 
over 100 years, Australia and the 
United States have enjoyed a mateship 
made possible by our mutual commit-
ment to democracy, human rights, and 
the rule of law. 
After signing 1951’s Australia, New 
Zealand, United States Security Trea-
ty, or ANZUS, Treaty, our two nations 
entered into a new level of cooperation 
on military matters; and for the past 15 
years, we have shared our firefighting 
resources with one another. 
In August 2018, over 100 Australian 
firefighters 
rushed 
to 
our 
aid 
as 
wildfires threatened to destroy com-
munities in California, Oregon, and 
Washington. 
When our Australian friends asked 
for support last year as they struggled 
to contain devastating bushfires, we 
were happy to return the favor. 
I am especially pleased today to 
honor two Tennesseans who heard the 
cries for help and, in spite of the dan-
ger, asked, Where do I sign up? 
Janan Hay Sharp, who serves with 
the Forest Service, and Tommy M. 
Barnes, who serves with the National 
Park Service, embody the values that 
set Tennesseans apart: bravery, com-
passion, and an eager willingness to 
lighten another’s load. 
This month, I was happy to support 
S. Res. 527, a resolution led by my 
friends Senator JOHN
BARRASSO
and 
Senator BEN CARDIN recognizing the 
longstanding partnership between the 
United States and Australia and hon-
oring 
firefighters 
like 
Janan 
and 
Tommy, who rushed toward the flames 
to save a friend in danger. 
They are a rare breed indeed, and 
today, I encourage all Tennesseans to 
take a moment to reflect upon their 
bravery and their commitment to a 
very special ally.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ELEANOR ELKIN 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Ms. Eleanor 
Elkin, who passed away at the age of 
103 on December 4, 2019. Eleanor served 
as one of Pennsylvania’s most distin-
guished disability advocates. It is im-
portant that we remember a remark-
able life dedicated to the betterment of 
others. Eleanor transformed the love 
for her family into a life of advocacy 
whose impact will be felt for decades to 
come. 
Eleanor’s commitment to equality 
was evident long before her time as one 
of Pennsylvanian’s most prominent 
disability rights leaders. Born in 1916 
in Philadelphia, she graduated from 
Germantown High School in 1934 and 
married Philip Elkin in 1939. They 
raised two adopted children, Margo and 
Richard. Richard was born with a dis-
ability, and Eleanor came face to face 
with the discriminatory laws experi-
enced by those with disabilities. The 
State of Pennsylvania did not realize, 
however, that it was about to confront 
a true fighter. Jim Wilson, former 
president of the Arc of the United 
States, said it best when he described 
Eleanor as ‘‘a white glove, tenacious 
fighter who would not accept ‘no’ for 
an answer.’’ That fighting spirit served 
Eleanor well when the State put up 
roadblocks to adopting Richard simply 
because he had a disability. When Rich-
ard was 2 years old, he was forcibly 
placed in a State-run institution. Elea-
nor went to court to get Richard back 
home. From that point on, she fought 
for his rights, beginning with a fight 
for him to attend preschool. At a time 
when it was common to deny children 
with disabilities access to education, 
Eleanor 
persuaded 
his 
elementary 
school to create a classroom for him 
and other children with disabilities. 
The numerous obstacles faced by 
Richard convinced Eleanor to expand 
her advocacy beyond her family. She 
was among a group of parents who 
joined together and created The Arc of 
Philadelphia in 1948. She founded a 
mothers’ support group in Bucks Coun-
ty, which became The Arc of Bucks 
County in the 1950’s. She was integral 
to the development of The Arc of Penn-
sylvania, and became the organiza-
tion’s president in the 1960’s. She went 
on to become president of The Arc of 
the United States in 1967 and 1968. 
At a time when the norm was to 
force children with disabilities into in-
stitutions, Eleanor was a leader in the 
fight to bring people with disabilities 
into the community. She partnered 
with the Public Interest Law Center of 
Philadelphia to expand the rights of 
people with disabilities. She helped to 
win a significant victory in 1971 with 
the ruling in PARC v. Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, which overturned a 
Pennsylvania 
law 
that 
permitted 
schools to deny public education to 
children with disabilities. This battle 
established the principles that eventu-
ally led to the Education for All Handi-
capped Children Act in 1975, which is 
now referred to as the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act. 
Eleanor also joined forces with the 
Public Interest Law Center in one of 
the most consequential fights of her 
life, the closure of the Pennhurst State 
School and Hospital. Pennhurst was an 
institution in Pennsylvania for people 
with disabilities that was exposed in 
the 1960’s as a center of abuse and ne-
glect and which came to symbolize the 
shameful belief that people with dis-
abilities should be isolated and hidden 
from view. Eleanor contributed her ad-
vocacy to the landmark 1974 case 
Halderman v. Pennhurst, which ruled 
that the constitutional rights of the 
residents of Pennhurst were being vio-
lated. This was a stark break from the 
common beliefs of the time which af-
forded people with disabilities little re-
spect and even fewer rights. The case 
helped fuel the larger movement away 
from institutions and was an impor-
tant step in the eventual closure of 
Pennhurst in 1987. 
On behalf of the people of Pennsyl-
vania and our grateful Nation, we ex-
tend our belated condolences to the 
family of Eleanor Elkin. Throughout 
her life, she fought for the dignity and 
well-being of people with disabilities. 
Whenever she saw injustice, she also 
saw an opportunity to make the world 
a better place. Celia Feinstein, director 
Emeritus of the Temple Institute on 
Disabilities, said that Eleanor was once 
asked how she would like to be remem-
bered, and Eleanor replied simply that, 
‘‘I don’t know that I need to be remem-
bered as much as I would want to know 
that what I’ve been doing [will] con-
tinue.’’ I have no doubt that thousands 
are ready to continue her work on be-
half of people with disabilities. Penn-
sylvania and all of America are better 
places because of Eleanor’s commit-
ment and extraordinary efforts. We 
may have lost Eleanor Elkin, but we 
will never lose the positive change she 
brought to countless lives and the im-
pact she had on disability policy in our 
country.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CON-
TINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
12957 OF MARCH 15, 1995, WITH 
RESPECT TO IRAN—PM 52 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is 
to continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2020. 
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957 with respect to Iran and to 
maintain in force comprehensive sanc-
tions against Iran to respond to this 
threat.

By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, and Mr. SANDERS): 
S. 3496. A bill to provide for Federal 
financing of short-time compensation 
programs during public health emer-
gencies; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
joined by several of my colleagues in 
introducing the Layoff Prevention Ex-
tension Act and the Preventing Layoffs 
During a Public Health Emergency 
Act. Both bills would renew Federal 
support for State short-time compensa-
tion—or work sharing—programs and 
provide assistance for States to adopt 
and improve existing programs in law. 
The latter bill would specifically acti-
vate financing for work sharing pro-
grams when there is a public health 
emergency. 
The 
coronavirus 
has 
officially 
reached a pandemic level, with an in-
creasing impact on individual lives, 
communities, and businesses across the 
United States. Last week, I was pleased 
that the Senate voted on an over-
whelming bipartisan basis to approve 
nearly $8 billion in supplemental fund-
ing for public health agencies to re-
spond to this outbreak, but that was 
only the down payment. 
While Congress has taken initial 
steps to address coronavirus as a public 
health crisis and stop the spread of 
COVID–19, it is also important to sup-
port the workers, students, families, 
and businesses that are already being 
impacted 
as 
this 
outbreak 
ripples

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1744 
March 12, 2020 
across the economy. In response to a 
reduced workforce due to workers that 
are ill, quarantined, or have new 
caregiving duties, companies that are 
losing business may need to lay off 
workers—even those that are healthy, 
if they are unable to keep their doors 
open. We need to extend emergency UI 
benefits, but just as importantly, we 
should incentivize employers to not lay 
off workers for what we hope will be a 
temporary public health emergency. 
That is where work sharing can play 
a 
critical 
role, 
as 
it 
encourages, 
through the UI system, employers and 
employees to voluntarily reduce hours 
instead of laying people off. The con-
cept of work sharing is simple—it pro-
vides an alternative to help businesses 
that are experiencing a temporary 
slowdown the chance to retain employ-
ees on a less than full-time basis. By 
giving struggling companies the flexi-
bility to reduce hours instead of their 
workforce, work sharing programs pre-
vent layoffs and help employers save 
money on rehiring costs. All the while, 
workers who otherwise would be in 
danger 
of 
losing 
their 
jobs 
com-
pletely—would keep their jobs instead, 
with the UI system making up for lost 
wages. 
According to the Department of 
Labor, work sharing saved approxi-
mately 570,000 jobs in the wake of the 
Great Recession (2008–2015). As part of 
the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job 
Creation Act, Congress enacted my 
Layoff Prevention Act of 2012, which 
provided temporary Federal financing 
for 100 percent of work sharing benefits 
paid to workers. States also received -1/ 
grants for implementation, improved 
administration, and program enroll-
ment efforts. This assistance helped 
save over 130,000 jobs from 2012 to its 
sunset in 2015. Multiple studies have 
found that communities that adopted 
more robust work-sharing programs 
weathered the recession with lower un-
employment rates. But even more jobs 
could have been saved if these pro-
grams had been in place before business 
slowed down. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today would address the current public 
health emergency and help soften the 
blow of future slowdowns. The Pre-
venting Layoffs During a Public Health 
Emergency Act would provide financ-
ing to States with and without formal 
work sharing laws during the period of 
a public health emergency, and up to 
one year after the termination of the 
emergency. The Layoff Prevention Act 
would provide a more permanent solu-
tion to give States an incentive to ex-
pand their work sharing programs to 
prevent future layoffs and blunt eco-
nomic downturns. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and 
Senators WHITEHOUSE and SANDERS in 
supporting passage of both bills to keep 
American workers on the job, save tax-
payers money, and provide employers 
with a practical, positive, and cost-ef-
fective alternative to layoffs.

MEMORATING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE LIBERATION 
OF 
THE 
DACHAU 
CONCENTRA-
TION CAMP DURING WORLD WAR 
II 
Mr. GARDNER (for himself, Ms. 
SINEMA, Ms. MCSALLY, Mr. BENNET, and 
Mr. INHOFE) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 542 
Whereas the Dachau concentration camp, 
established in March 1933— 
(1) was the first concentration camp estab-
lished by the German National Socialist, or 
‘‘Nazi’’, government; and 
(2) operated continuously until the end of 
World War II in 1945; 
Whereas the Dachau concentration camp 
housed Germans who were deemed political, 
racial, or social threats by the Nazi regime, 
including Communists, Social Democrats, 
Jews, Roma, members of the clergy, Jeho-
vah’s Witnesses, and other religious and cul-
tural minorities; 
Whereas, in addition to Germans, prisoners 
at the Dachau concentration camp included 
Poles, Hungarians, Austrians, Italians, Lith-
uanians, Czechs, Slovenes, Belgians, and 
other foreign nationals from countries occu-
pied or invaded by Germany; 
Whereas the Nazis imprisoned more than 
200,000 civilians in the Dachau concentration 
camp and the more than 100 subcamps of the 
Dachau concentration camp; 
Whereas the Nazis murdered tens of thou-
sands of innocent civilians at the Dachau 
concentration camp, one of many camps 
where the Nazis brutally killed millions of 
people, including 6,000,000 Jews, during the 
Holocaust; 
Whereas the Nazis tortured and conducted 
medical experiments on civilian prisoners at 
the Dachau concentration camp, including 
by— 
(1) subjecting the prisoners to pressure ex-
tremes; 
(2) submersing the prisoners in freezing 
water; 
(3) forcing the prisoners to drink salt 
water; and 
(4) infecting the prisoners with malaria; 
Whereas the Nazis subjected civilian pris-
oners at the Dachau concentration camp to 
forced labor— 
(1) first for the initial construction and ex-
pansion of the camp; and 
(2) later primarily for armaments produc-
tion to supply the German military; 
Whereas, following the advance of Allied 
Forces, the Nazi regime began the system-
atic transfer of prisoners from evacuated 
concentration camps to the Dachau con-
centration camp for continued imprison-
ment; 
Whereas, in December 1943, Dwight D. Ei-
senhower was appointed as Supreme Com-
mander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces 
and led the formal coordination of the Allied 
Forces, with the mission to liberate Europe; 
Whereas, on April 29, 1945, the 45th Infan-
try ‘‘Thunderbird’’ Division of the Seventh 
Army of the United States (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘45th Infantry Divi-
sion’’), under the leadership of Lieutenant 
Colonel Felix Sparks, member of the Colo-
rado Army National Guard and Commander 
of the Third Battalion of the 157th Infantry 
Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division, 
along with units of the 42nd Infantry Divi-
sion and the 20th Armored Division, led the 
liberation of the main Dachau concentration 
camp; 
Whereas the 45th Infantry Division— 
(1) was composed of National Guard units 
from Colorado, Oklahoma, Arizona, and New 
Mexico; and 
(2) deployed in June 1943 in support of the 
Allied Forces during World War II; 
Whereas, in the European theater of oper-
ation, the 45th Infantry Division suffered— 
(1) 1,831 deaths in battle; and 
(2) 7,791 casualties; 
Whereas, in 1985, the United States Army 
Center of Military History and the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum honored 
the 45th Infantry Division with recognition 
as a ‘‘liberating unit’’; and 
Whereas commemoration of the liberation 
of the Dachau concentration camp will in-
still in all people of the United States a 
greater awareness of the unspeakable trage-
dies of the Holocaust: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates April 29, 2020, as the 
75th anniversary of the liberation of the Da-
chau concentration camp during World War 
II; 
(2) condemns the crimes against humanity 
committed by the Nazi regime; and 
(3) recognizes the valorous efforts of the 
45th Infantry Division, the 42nd Infantry Di-
vision, and the 20th Armored Division of the 
Seventh Army of the United States in the 
liberation of the thousands of individuals 
imprisoned at the Dachau concentration 
camp.

CELEBRATING AMERICA’S NEWEST 
CITIZENS 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this 
time to congratulate fifty individuals who will 
take their oaths of citizenship on March 13, 
2020. This memorable occasion will be held at 
the United States Courthouse and Federal 
Building in Hammond, Indiana. 
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come 
from countries around the world to the United 
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example 
of what is so great about the United States of 
America—that people from all over the world 
can come together and unite as members of 
a free, democratic nation. These individuals 
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a 
better opportunity for success than here in 
America. 
On March 13, 2020, the following people, 
representing many nations throughout the 
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in 
Hammond, Indiana: Esmeralda Vega, Ghada 
Ramadan, 
Paulette 
Doreen 
Shaw, 
Sara 
Padilla, Javier Garcia, Markus Jaewon Lee, 
Antonia Martinez, Consuelo Murguia de Her-
nandez, Rocelle Clavero Grabarek, Abier 
Abdulhak, Ana Gligorov, Jovelyn Socobos 
Manilag, Noemy Alejandra Cotrez Pavon, 
Maggie L. Dobrodt, Ayad Shakir Mahmood Al 
Mahdawi, Natasha Lynn Rizzotti, Zurizadai 
Luna Williams, Milan Zubic, Rosa Elvira 
Chacon Guerrero, Araceli Flores Santillan, 
Maha F. Abdulqader, Zainab Usman Sheikh, 
Alexandru Colta, Maria R. Palacios, Chandan 
Sevanti Sharma, Marlen del Rosario Carmona 
Villodas, Maria Guadalupe Hernandez, Wissel 
Joseph, 
Martin 
Diaz, 
Maria 
Gonzalez 
Herrejon, Mauricio Hinojosa, Liliana Patricia 
Ruiz Tenorio, Naila Tauseef Khan, Reyna 
Canlas Roldan, Oyata Monono Mwanza, 
Kayode S. Shittu, Lorenzo Aleman Escobedo, 
Hongping Ren, Panteleimon Maillis, Martin Mi-
randa, Susana Maria Fernandez, Chante 
Sarah Latrice Rizzotti, Rosa Fernandez, Edgar 
Maciel, Harry Vasilopoulos, Imran Khan, Elsa 
Patricia Mota, Mika Francine Estacio, Nika 
Markos, and Morella Rivas. 
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or 
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, 
each is inspired by the fact that the United 
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . .of the people, by the 
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that 
the United States is truly a free nation. By 
seeking American citizenship, they have made 
the decision that they want to live in a place 
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment 
of the Constitution, they can practice religion 
as they choose, speak their minds without fear 
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and 
my other distinguished colleagues to join me 
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America 
on March 13, 2020. They, too, will be Amer-
ican citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
We, as a free and democratic nation, con-
gratulate them and welcome them.

BIMBO BAKERIES USA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Bimbo Bak-
eries USA for receiving Commerce City’s Busi-
ness Appreciation 2020 Business of the Year 
Award. 
The Business of the Year Award is given to 
a Commerce City company with a pioneering 
spirit that has shown a history of leadership 
within its industry and the community. A staple 
of Commerce City since 1958, Bimbo Bakeries 
USA has demonstrated longevity and sus-
tained growth within the community. They are 
the corporate arm of the Mexican multinational 
baked goods manufacturer, Grupo Bimbo. 
This facility now employs 132 employees, ten 
of which were hired in 2019. The company re-
cently made a $3,500,000 capital investment 
to its facility, upgrading critical equipment such 
as the hamburger bun line. 
In addition to their growing business, Bimbo 
Bakeries also gives back to the Commerce 
City community, donating to local organiza-
tions and projects such as a greenhouse at 
Lester Arnold High School and Thanksgiving 
dinner at Adams High School. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Bimbo Bakeries USA for this well-deserved 
recognition from Commerce City.

HONORING DILLON J. CARR 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Dillon J. Carr. 
Dillon is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Dillon has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Dillon has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Dillon 
is a Brotherhood member of the Order of the 
Arrow and holds the rank of Firebuilder in the 
tribe of Mic-O-Say. Dillon has also contributed 
to his community through his Eagle Scout 
project. Dillon constructed a butterfly garden, 
bird feeder, and bird bath outside of Life Un-
limited in Liberty, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Dillon J. Carr for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

ANNIVERSARY OF BIRTH OF 
SHAIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the anniversary of the 
birth of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, recognized 
as the ‘‘Founding Father’’ of the nation of Ban-
gladesh. 
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, called ‘‘Mujib,’’ is 
also known as ‘‘Bangha Bandu,’’ a title that 
means ‘‘Friend of the Bengal.’’ In recognition 
of the 100th year since the birth of Sheikh 
Mujib, the government of Bangladesh is cele-
brating March 17, 2020 through March 17, 
2021 as ‘‘Mujib Borsho,’’ or the ‘‘Mujib Year.’’ 
Sheikh Mujib was born on March 17, 1920, 
in the province of Bengal, in what was then 
British India. Just over half a century later, on 
March 7, 1971, he would call for East Pakistan 
to become the independent nation of Ban-
gladesh. He was subsequently arrested, but 
his vision for Bengalis would soon become a 
reality. Following a brutal war for independ-
ence, during which an estimated 300,000 to 
3,000,000 people lost their lives, the nation of 
Bangladesh was born on December 16, 1971. 
Sheikh Mujib was released from prison and 
became the first President of Bangladesh, 
serving in that office from April 17, 1971 to 
January 12, 1972. In January of 1972, he was 
elected Prime Minister of the first Parliament 
of Bangladesh. 
In 1975, Sheikh Mujib and most of his family 
were assassinated. Just two of his daughters, 
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 
Sheikh Rehana, were spared, as they were 
living in what was West Germany at the time. 
The centennial of the birth of the ‘‘Founding 
Father’’ of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib, is deep-
ly meaningful to the people of Bangladesh and 
to those throughout the world with personal 
connections to the country. Events are being 
organized in the United States and around the 
world to commemorate this historical event. I 
encourage my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing those working to honor Bangladesh’s 
history and commemorate this event, including 
Dr. 
MD. 
Rabbi 
Alam, 
Convener 
of 
Bangabandhu Parishad USA and a resident of 
my home state of Michigan. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in standing 
with the people of Bangladesh, and those in

RECOGNIZING DAN OHL OF MALTA 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dan Ohl of Malta for going 
above and beyond to answer the call of duty 
and personally fly blood platelets to his local 
hospital in a time of need. 
Dan loves to fly. He says there’s nothing 
like seeing Montana’s stunning landscape 
from a different perspective. 
As a Montana Highway Patrolman, Dan 
spends a lot of time on the ground, lending a 
hand to fellow Montanans. It wasn’t until this 
past December that his love of flying and help-
ing others came together. 
In December 2019, Phillips County Hospital 
contacted Montana Highway Patrol for assist-
ance delivering blood from Great Falls to their 
clinic in Malta. The troopers came up with a 
plan to use a series of relays to transport the 
blood to Malta but ran into a problem when 
there wasn’t enough staff to execute it. That’s 
when Dan stepped up. 
Dan jumped into action and using his own 
Beach Craft Bonanza 6-seater, started the 
over 200-mile flight to Great Falls to meet the 
Red Cross at the local airport. He says it was 
the most precious cargo, aside from his family, 
he has had on his plane. When he touched 
down in Malta, he met with hospital staff who 
transferred the blood to the hospital. His quick 
delivery of blood saved a life. 
For Dan, this is why he went into serving in 
the Montana Highway Patrol: he wanted to 
help Montanans. Whether he’s on or off duty, 
as a patrolman, he’s called to step up in times 
of need and that’s exactly what he did. 
Madam Speaker, for selflessly helping his 
fellow Montanans, from the air and on the 
ground, I recognize Dan Ohl for his Spirit of 
Montana.

UNIVERSITY 
SCHOOL 
OF 
MEDICINE 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to recognize Southern Illinois University (SIU) 
School of Medicine for celebrating their 50th 
anniversary. 
SIU School of Medicine was established in 
1970 after the Illinois General Assembly 
passed a bill calling for a second state med-
ical school to be established in downstate Illi-
nois and achieved full accreditation in 1972. 
Today, SIU School of Medicine admits 72 of 
the best medical students from around the 
world each year. 
The medical education curriculum offered at 
SIU School of Medicine has brought the 
school national attention. The school’s con-
tinuing medical education program provides an 
extensive schedule of accredited conferences 
and symposia for physicians and other health- 
care professionals in central and southern Illi-
nois. 
I applaud the efforts of SIU School of Medi-
cine, its faculty, and students. They continue 
to provide quality medical education com-
mitted to improving local healthcare. I extend 
my sincere congratulations to SIU School of 
Medicine for a successful 50 years, and I wish 
them continued success going forward pro-
viding quality healthcare services to the resi-
dents of Central Illinois.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Certol Inter-
national LLC for receiving Commerce City’s 
Business Appreciation 2020 Business on the 
Move Award. 
The Business on the Move Award recog-
nizes businesses bringing new employment, 
growth in sales or new capital investment to 
the city in the last year. Founded in 1979, and 
located in Commerce City since 2003, Certol 
International was an early pioneer in the man-
ufacturing of infection prevention products for 
the medical and dental markets. Creating in-
novative products in these markets remains a 
core competency today. The company works 
with distribution partners to ship to customers 
in national and international destinations. 
Certol International operates out of a 46,000 
square-foot building in Commerce City with a 
staff of 38. In 2019, they hired two more em-
ployees and contributed over a million dollars 
in capital investment. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Certol International LLC for this well-deserved 
recognition from Commerce City.

PITTSTON 
FRIENDLY 
SONS’ 
SWINGLE AWARD 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Art Owens, who will receive the 
Francis Swingle Award from the Greater 
Pittston Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. He will be 
honored at the group’s 106th annual gathering 
on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. 
Art was born January 12, 1959 to Sheldon 
and Eleanor Owens in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania. He attended grade school in Wilkes- 
Barre and graduated from E.L. Meyers High 
School in 1979. He earned an associate de-
gree in social science from Luzerne County 
Community College and a bachelor’s degree 
in liberal studies in social services, along with 
a certificate in gerontology from College 
Misericordia. 
Art’s career serving others began in 1975 in 
the dietary department at Mercy Hospital in 
Wilkes-Barre. As the volunteer director, Art 
was integral to the management of the volun-
teer department, developing therapies and 
projects like the Angel/Golden Tree Project. 
During his 20-year career at the hospital, he 
successfully built professional relationships 
with area social service organizations, and 
served on the Policy and Procedure Com-
mittee. Art was also vice president of the 
Mercy Hospital Auxiliary. For his efforts, he re-
ceived the Mercy Leadership Award and the 
Mercy Community/Professional Involvement 
Award. 
In 1996, Art accepted a position with the 
Make-A-Wish 
Foundation 
of 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania as a wish granting director/vol-
unteer supervisor. He continued to make wish-
es come true for critically ill children, advanc-
ing to the position of program services director 
and then vice president of program services. 
He worked to secure over $100,000 in dona-
tions by building relationships with local busi-
nesses and organizations across Northeastern 
Pennsylvania. He recruited, hired, trained, and 
coordinated volunteers in wish granting and 
development during his time with the founda-
tion. 
In 2006, Art transitioned to the Luzerne In-
termediate Unit No. 18, assisting children in 
the Behavioral Health and Rehabilitative Serv-
ices Department. He currently provides serv-
ices to children who attend the Greater Nan-
ticoke Area School District. 
In addition to the Greater Pittston Friendly 
Sons of Saint Patrick, Art is a member of the 
Fraternal Order of Eagles, Aerie 353, and cur-
rently serves on the Scholarship Committee to 
help raise funds for local students to assist 
with college expenses. 
It is an honor to join the Greater Pittston 
Friendly Sons of St. Patrick as they recognize 
Art Owens as the recipient of the Francis 
Swingle Award. He has had a successful ca-
reer in service to his community, and I wish 
him all the best on this St. Patrick’s Day.

then moving on to earn a Master’s in Public 
Health from the University of California, Berke-
ley. Upon receiving her master’s degree, 
Coralyn was admitted to the prestigious As-
sembly Fellowship Program at the California

is currently the Department Administrator for 
PIH Health Good Samaritan Hospital’s Com-
munity Health Education Department and Lac-

sees nutrition, cardiovascular health, stroke, 
perinatal health, breastfeeding, and diabetes. 
Since chronic diseases such as diabetes are 
both common and costly, Coralyn has a long-
standing interest in prevention and educates 
individual patients and their family members in 
creating lifelong healthy habits. As a master’s-

HUNTER CYPRIAN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Hunter Cyp-
rian for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Hunter Cyprian is a student at Standley 
Lake High School and received this award be-
cause his determination and hard work have 
allowed him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Hunter 
Cyprian is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Hun-
ter Cyprian for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

DISABLED VETERANS EDUCATION 
RELIEF ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Disabled Veterans Education Re-
lief Act, which would reinstate VA education 
assistance for disabled veterans in vocational 
rehabilitation and employment (VR&E) training 
in the event their school closes or courses are 
disapproved. Section 109 of the Forever GI 
Bill law extended these protections to students 
using GI Bill benefits but did not include stu-
dents using education benefits under the 
VR&E program. By extending these protec-
tions to the over 100,000 veterans who partici-
pate in the VR&E program every year, our na-
tion will ensure that all veterans can access 
relief when their studies are disrupted by 
school 
closures 
or 
disapproved 
courses 
through no fault of their own. 
The bill requires the VA to protect VR&E 
students on the same basis as their counter-
parts using GI Bill benefits as mandated by 
section 109 of the Forever GI Bill law. These 
protections include the restoration of benefits 
for those affected by school closures or the 
course was disapproved as a result of a modi-
fied policy, regulation, or law. In addition, my 
legislation authorizes the VA to continue pay-
ing subsistence allowances to VR&E students 
through the end of the academic term during 
which such closure or disapproval occurred. 
VA will also be required to notify affected stu-
dents of imminent and actual school closures 
and inform them how the closure will affect 
their VR&E benefits. 
The Act has the support of the Disabled 
American Veterans, American Legion, Para-
lyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of For-
eign Wars, Student Veterans of America, 
AMVETS, Association of the U.S. Navy, Mili-
tary Officers Association of America, National 
Military Family Association, and the Enlisted 
Association of the National Guard of the 
United States. 
The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. BOST, is an 
original cosponsor of the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

a half long outreach effort to unite the Chris-
tian Community. 
Space Coast City Fest was created as a re-
gion-wide campaign to serve churches in the 
community and promote faith-based works. 
Over a period of 18 months, CityFest and

serve our schools, meet the needs of children 
within the foster care system, raise awareness 
& seek solutions for the Opioid crisis, tackle 
homelessness, feed the hungry, and revitalize 
troubled and sometimes forgotten neighbor-
hoods. 
In addition, special events were held to pro-
mote unity among church leaders and spread 
a message of Christian hope. The ReNew 
gathering drew more than 2,000 people for a 
night of worship & teaching, a conference for 
pastors and ministry leaders was attended by 
several hundred church leaders, an edu-
cational forum on community issues, and var-
ious training sessions were offered to church 
members. In the ten days leading up to the 
final festival event, a Christian message was 
shared in several smaller settings including a 
surf camp with Cliff and Damian Hobgood, two 
presentations in area prisons, a luncheon and 
a dinner for women, and a business and civic 
leaders’ luncheon. 
The final event is a family-oriented festival 
at the Space Coast Daily Park next to Viera 
High School on March 28th and 29th. The fes-
tival will host a children’s area and an action 
sports program that includes professional 
BMX, Free-Style Motocross, and skateboard 
demonstrations. The event will wrap up with a 
mainstage program of contemporary Christian 
music bands from around the county, and will 
also include a message of hope from inter-
national evangelist Andrew Palau. Other fea-
tured 
performers 
include 
Adam 
Agee, 
Mandisa, Newsboys United, Blanca, Illusionist 
Jon Michael Hinton, Danny Gokey, and 
Lecrae. Thousands are expected to attend. 
I would like to recognize the hard work of 
the local organizing committee chaired by 
Christopher Burton and Dr. Mike Ronsisvalle 
in partnership with the Luis Palau Association. 
Their efforts over the last 18 months of mobi-
lizing events have greatly impacted our com-
munity and have brought us all together in a 
very special way. It’s notable that the 
$800,000 cost of the Space Coast City Fest 
Celebration was contributed by local churches, 
individuals, and businesses so that it could be 
free to the public. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to please join me in recog-
nizing Space Coast City Fest.

The Economic Development Award for

diums, barges, and large buildings throughout

panded the company’s existing operations in 
Denver and at 6300 Clermont St. in Com-
merce City with a new 234,000 square-foot fa-
cility at 8573 Ulster St. The Commerce City

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor the life of Gerrilynn ‘‘Lynn’’ 
Nishimura, whose leadership in the labor com-
munity has improved the lives of countless 
people in Washington State. 
On February 5, 2020 Lynn Nishimura unex-
pectedly passed away after beginning her re-
tirement that was set to be filled with two 
things she was most passionate about—travel 
and continued service to her community. 
Lynn Nishimura had an admirable career. 
She worked her way up at a variety of banking 
institutions, starting as a teller and retiring as 
a Senior Vice President. After her retirement 
in 2018, Lynn resumed her position as an un-
paid volunteer of the Puget Sound Labor 
Agency as their Executive Director, where she 
had been since 2013. The Puget Sound Labor 
Agency credits Lynn Nishimura for providing 
crucial leadership and steering the organiza-
tion through difficult times with her expertise in 
finance management and her devotion to their 
mission. Lynn Nishimura worked tireless hours 
during her time with Puget Sound Labor Agen-
cy to ensure people got the help they needed, 
from guaranteeing wheelchair ramp installa-
tions were completed to ensuring union mem-
ber hardship assistance would continue to be 
available to the thousands of people who 
needed those services. Lynn is remembered 
for her warmth and fearlessness to rise to 
challenges in order to improve the lives of ev-
eryone around her. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure 
that I recognize the life of Gerrilynn ‘‘Lynn’’ 
Nishimura. Her life and dedication to service is 
a reminder that it only takes one person to 
make lifechanging impacts in a community.

As the CEO of the Center for Prevention of

less devotion to the promotion of the well- 
being of thousands of central Illinoisans has

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF THE REV. PHILLIP R. BYRUM 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the decades of dedicated 
public service of a great North Carolinian, role 
model and man of faith, the Rev. Phillip R. 
Byrum—known to many as Father Phil. 
Born in 1941, Rev Phillip R. Byrum is a na-
tive of Greensboro, North Carolina—son of the 
late Robert and Margaret Byrum. He attended 
Greensboro Public Schools and graduated 
from Greensboro College in 1963 with a de-
gree in philosophy and religion. 
He went on to attend the Episcopal Theo-
logical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
graduating in 1966. He was assigned to St. 
Michael’s Church in Tarboro, North Carolina 
and St. Mary’s Church in Speed, North Caro-
lina. He was ordained to the Priesthood on 
June 24, 1967, at Christ Church in Raleigh, 
North Carolina. 
Father Phil was married to the former Anne 
Stuart Barnette in 1966. They became parents 
to two sons, Robert Stuart, born 1968 and 
John Keith, born in 1970. He is also a proud 
grandfather of seven grandchildren and great- 
grandfather of one. 
Father Phil and his family moved to Albe-
marle, North Carolina in 1969, where he be-
came the Rector of Christ Church. He and his 
family spent a joyful 22 years in this parish, 
with both sons attending local schools, and 
leaving to attend and graduate from University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
Serving with passion and humility, Father 
Phil was a dedicated minister to his congrega-
tion and was heavily involved in many facets 
of community life, as well as the work of the 
Diocese of North Carolina. For many years, he 
chaired the Commission on Liturgy and Music, 
and directed a music and worship camp for 
children on behalf of the Diocese for 19 years. 
He also began a long relationship with the So-
ciety of St. Margaret in Boston, Massachusetts 
where he served as a visiting chaplain to the 
Sisters for many years. 
ln May 1991, Rev. Byrum accepted a call to 
become Rector of St. Timothy’s Church in Wil-
son, North Carolina. Shortly after, a temporary 
assignment stretched into nearly 30 years of 
service as Father Phil was asked to serve as 
priest-in-charge of a historic African American 
church in East Wilson, St. Mark’s Church. 
Father Phil completed his service in ministry 
from St. Timothy’s in 2000, and focused his 
ministry service on St. Mark’s, while also serv-
ing La Iglesia de la Guadalupana, the Span-
ish-speaking church officially recognized as a 
congregation in 1998 and shares St. Mark’s 
facilities. Father Phil devoted his service in 
ministry at St. Mark’s and La Guadalupana 
until his final retirement in 2020. 
Father Phil had the privilege of leading his 
congregations 
at 
St. 
Mark’s 
and 
La 
Guadalupana in serving the community with 
worship services in English and Spanish and 
through community outreach programs such 
as food ministries, tutoring programs, and as-
sistance programs for those facing critical situ-
ations in their lives. 
On February 29, 2020, Father Phil retired 
from active ministry and will continue to live in 
his home community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating and honoring the Rev. 
Phillip R. Byrum as he is recognized for his 
many years of service. His lifelong contribution 
to his congregations and community cannot be 
overstated.

Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. 
Michael A. Evans, a medical expert, an entre-
preneur and a dear friend. Dr. Evans was 
known throughout Indiana and the nation for 
his excellent work in the field of toxicology, but 
he was much more than that. A businessman, 
Mike founded two nationally recognized lab-
oratories in Indianapolis, AIT Laboratories and 
AIT Bioscience. Mike was commended by the 
State of Indiana for his many successes. Hoo-
siers are forever grateful for Mike’s significant 
contributions to the City of Indianapolis and 
the State of Indiana as a whole. 
Michael Evans was born on October 19, 
1943, in New Albany, Indiana. He graduated 
from Our Lady of Providence High School and 
went on to attend St. Joseph’s College where 
he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. 
Upon his graduation, Mike served our nation 
as a platoon sergeant and an Army Ranger in 
Vietnam. Mike was awarded two Purple 
Hearts and a Silver Star Medal for valor in 
combat. 
After returning from his service, Mike earned 
his doctorate degree in toxicology from the In-
diana University School of Medicine. After re-
ceiving his degree, Dr. Evans spent twenty 
years within the field of toxicology working as 
a researcher for government agencies, testi-
fying as an expert witness and training the 
next generation as a professor. Dr. Evans also 
did private research in laboratories including 
those at Indiana University School of Medi-
cine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Illi-
nois Institute of Technology and the University 
of Illinois College of Medicine. 
In 1990, Dr. Evans created AIT Labora-
tories, a toxicology and forensics lab that does 
testing and research for law enforcement, cor-
porations, 
government 
agencies, 
pharma-
ceutical companies, hospitals, physicians, pain 
management professionals, medical exam-
iners, attorneys, and courts of law. He went on 
to serve as the president and CEO until 2012. 
In 2012, Dr. Evans created AIT Bioscience 
which is an integrated bioanalytical contract 
research organization (CRO), supported by a 
state-of-the-art electronic laboratory environ-
ment.

his leadership, the Friendly Sons Scholarship 
was established, and Kevin’s family was an 
original donor to the program. 
He began his career in public safety in 
1978, working as a radio operator/dispatcher 
for the Luzerne County Civil Defense. During 
his 27-year career, Kevin rose to the rank of 
deputy director of the Luzerne County Emer-
gency Management Agency. During those 
years, he oversaw the planning, training, and 
response to all natural and manmade disas-
ters throughout Luzerne County. He concluded

IN RECOGNITION OF 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support to commemorate the 43rd 
anniversary of International Women’s Day. 
On March 8, International Women’s Day, we 
take the time to commemorate the incom-
parable contributions that women and girls all 
around the world have created in order to bet-
ter our communities. 
I am honored to be able to commemorate 
this momentous day with so many other 
women that have devoted their lives to making 
a change in our society. 
We 
commemorate 
women’s 
enduring 
achievements for our world and rededicate 
ourselves to delivering education and oppor-
tunity to girls in every country. 
Our lives have changed because of influen-
tial figures from Arabella Mansfield, America’s 
first female lawyer and philanthropist, Kath-
erine Johnson, mathematician, critical NASA 
employee and revolutionary force of her time, 
Oprah Winfrey, first black multi-billionaire, 
American 
media 
executive 
and 
social 
influencer, and our very own mothers who 
have raised and supported us. 
Women are beginning to leave their mark in 
every industry from corporations, to music, to 
sports, to education, to finances, to enter-
tainers, to the Armed Forces, and to politics. 
The fight of women has always been fueled 
and grounded in the belief in what is possible, 
we have always built a future that we could 
see and believe in and fight for. 
That is why the United States currently has 
the most diverse Congress in history, with 
over one hundred female members whose vi-
sions and values continue the legacy of the 
women that came before and paved the way 
for those who follow. 
That is why a young woman who saw an 
existential crisis spoke up and sparked a revo-
lution to combat climate change on a global 
scale. 
That is why we will never stop advocating 
for the Equal Rights Amendment and Equal 
Pay. 
That is why a woman was selected as the 
Democratic party’s nominee for President of 
the United States; she served as the Nation’s 
first lady, senator from New York, and proudly 
served as Secretary of State. 
That is why we continue to reshape and 
rethink the role of women in society. 
It has been a momentous year for women 
as we thrive in the 21st century. 
We are no longer hidden figures behind a 
man, held back by ambition, or forced to take 
on stereotypic roles of women. 
However, we are still far from reaching the 
equality envisioned in our Constitution. 
The scales of justice held by Lady Liberty 
are not yet balanced, and it is incumbent upon 
all women to continue our fight for equal rights 
under law and in the eyes of society. 
One in 3 women worldwide are victims of 
physical or sexual violence. 
More than 200 million women and girls alive 
today have experienced Female Genital Muti-
lation (FGM). 
Complications from pregnancy and childbirth 
is the number one killer among girls ages 15 
to 19 in the developing world. 
Despite women working longer hours than 
men when both paid and unpaid work is taken 
into consideration, women still earn an aver-
age of 24 percent less than men do world-
wide. 
Women spend one to three hours more on 
housework than men, two to ten times the 
amount of time caring for children and the el-
derly, and one to four hours less per day on 
economic market activities. 
An estimated 63 million young girls world-
wide are out of school. 
Millions of women are still denied funda-
mental rights, but we look to the promise of 
our past and know that our future is bright. 
We will usher in a new era of growth for our 
economies, security for our families, and 
strength for our countries. 
Let us build on the successes of our history, 
protect the rights we have won, and continue 
to march towards a new dawn for women and 
girls around the world. 
Our commitment to the empowerment of 
women and girls also calls us to rededicate 
ourselves to fighting violence against women 
and girls in all spheres of life, from the class-
room to the courtroom to the bedroom and ev-
erywhere in between. 
This year, as we prepare to commemorate 
the centennial of the 19th Amendment, we 
take acknowledgement of this momentous 
achievement that unleashed the power of 
women to have a voice in our democracy, and 
in the process helped deliver transformative 
progress toward a more perfect union for all 
Americans. 
In recognition of the innumerable contribu-
tions and continued leadership of America’s 
women, we will never stop fighting to advance 
the cause of freedom, equality and justice for 
all. 
Today, and always, we reaffirm a vital truth 
that when women succeed, America suc-
ceeds.

RECOGNIZING ESTHER STERLING 
AS CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, in 
celebration of Women’s History Month, it is my 
honor to recognize Esther Sterling as my 
March Constituent of the Month. Ms. Sterling, 
a Holocaust survivor from my district, spent 
her childhood hiding from Nazis in Ukraine. 
Forged from her experience during this dark 
time in history, Ms. Sterling shares her story 
across my district with schools and community 
groups to help ensure that history will never 
repeat itself. 
Esther’s story is one of courage, fortitude, 
and determination. After World War II broke 
out, Esther, her mother, father, and sister 
were sent to the Ghetto of Sambor. When the 
Ghetto was terminated and residents were 
sent to an extermination camp, Esther’s family 
managed to escape with the help of their de-
voted nanny. Just outside their nanny’s apart-
ment, Esther’s father dug a hole beneath a 
coal and wood shack. Most of the time they 
hid within shack, but if there were passersby, 
the family crouched within the hole, breathing 
from air provided by a tube. 
As the war progressed, the German gestapo 
began to round people up for executions. 
Searching for a new place to hide his family, 
Esther’s father was shot. Her mother was 
stricken with grief after her father’s death, and 
as an eight-year-old child, Esther took on the 
responsibility of convincing her mother and 
younger sister to keep fighting for survival. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. Ms. Sterling’s perseverance and tri-
umph during a time of great danger and divide 
is not only inspiring, but encouraging. I am 
honored to recognize her as my Constituent of 
the Month and I thank her for everything she’s 
done to make our community a better place.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT ROG-
ERS, RECIPIENT OF THE FREE-
LAND SONS OF ERIN 2020 CIT-
IZEN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Robert Rogers, who will be 
named the 2020 Citizen of the Year by the 
Freeland, Pennsylvania Sons of Erin. He will 
be honored on Saturday, March 14, 2020 at 
their 85th annual St. Patrick’s Day celebration. 
Robert’s community service in Freeland 
spans three decades, and includes significant 
involvement in local baseball. For the past ten 
years, he has been the manager of the Free-
land Babe Ruth League. Steadfastly dedicated 
to this role, Robert dedicates many hours to 
improving the grounds and maintaining the 
playing field so that it remains in top condition. 
In addition, he recruits players for the league, 
organizes fundraisers, runs the concession 
stand, and coordinates schedules for the Babe 
Ruth League, MMI Preparatory School, Penn 
State Hazleton, as well as the men’s league. 
With his love and knowledge of baseball, Rob-
ert also steps into the role of coach when the 
need arises. Robert has previously served on 
the Board of the Freeland Little League. In ad-
dition to his commitment to the Board, he 
helped install the lights at the field and has 
even cooked concession fare during games. 
Robert’s love for, and commitment to, the 
Freeland community extends beyond baseball. 
He is currently also instrumental to the upkeep 
and maintenance at the Freeland YMCA. Rob-
ert assisted with the recent renovations of the 
foyer and the basement at the YMCA, a 
project where he contributed custom shelving 
and personally completed the refinishing of the 
front desk. A handyman at heart, he is known 
for always going above and beyond his as-
signment. 
Freeland is rife with evidence of Robert’s 
handiwork and dedication to his beloved com-
munity. He has additionally refinished display 
cases at MMI Preparatory School, the pipe 
organ at St. John’s church, and the American 
Legion’s flagpoles on Centre Street. 
It is an honor to join the Freeland Sons of 
Erin in recognizing Robert Rogers as the 2020 
Citizen of the Year. He is a true community 
servant, and all of Freeland has benefited 
from his unending generosity. I wish him all 
the best this St. Patrick’s Day.

The Entrepreneurial Spirit Award recognizes

INTRODUCTION OF THE LEADER-
SHIP 
INSTITUTE 
FOR 
TRANS-
ATLANTIC ENGAGEMENT (LITE) 
ACT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Leadership Institute for 
Transatlantic Engagement (LITE) Act—a bill 
that will create an institute to assist in 
strengthening ties with our allies, protect 
democratic institutions, and support visionary 
leadership on both sides of the Atlantic. 
In the 116th Congress, under my leadership 
as chair, the Commission on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, also known as the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission, has held events on the 
importance of international election observa-
tion, good governance, and focused on demo-
cratic backsliding in particular countries as 
part of our continued commitment to the un-
derlying principles of the Helsinki Final Act 
adopted by the 57 North American, European, 
and Eurasian countries that make up the re-
gion of the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE). 
We identified numerous challenges in west-
ern leadership that are putting our democ-
racies and the transatlantic partnership at risk, 
including as continuing disparities in wealth, 
health, employment, education, justice, and 
other sectors that lead citizens to question 
whether democracy can deliver. Common to 
among these issues is the role leaders can 
play in ensuring laws are equitable, trans-
parent, and enforced; elections are free and 
fair; and laying the groundwork to ensure the 
same protections, rights, and laws, are ex-
tended to all in their constituencies. 
The LITE Act will establish an institute to 
assist western democracies in living up to 
these ideals and restoring faith in democracy, 
by equipping transatlantic policymakers with 
legislative, communications, conflict resolution 
and other leadership tools to strengthen 
democratic institutions in their societies and 
the transatlantic relationship. Given demo-
graphic change on both sides of the Atlantic, 
the activities of LITE, as established by this 
legislation, will also include a focus on inclu-
sive and intergenerational solutions to current 
challenges with the goal of empowering indi-
viduals across generations and from diverse 
backgrounds with the knowledge, tools, oppor-
tunity, and access to fully participate in their 
democracies. In addition, LITE will seek to re-
unify communities by assisting leaders with 
strategies that build resilience against the ex-
ploitation of community grievances that can 
lead to dangerous divisions in our societies. 
In February, we hosted young parliamentar-
ians from the OSCE region here in the U.S. 
Congress to discuss how we can strengthen 
their political inclusion to advance peace and 
security efforts. Last year, we held hearings 
featuring European lawmakers, and on global 
leadership, democracy and public diplomacy. 
These hearings were the capstone in a dec-
ade of events that began in 2009 whereby the 
Commission has convened U.S. and Euro-
pean policymakers under the banner of the 
Transatlantic 
Minority 
Political 
Leadership 
Conference and Transatlantic Inclusion Lead-
ers Network to support increased political rep-
resentation in western democracies. As we 
celebrate the tenth anniversary of these efforts 
that have been pivotal in strengthening inter-
national relations over the past decade, I hope 
you will join me in supporting LITE to further 
codify leadership exchanges and knowledge 
building between diverse and young trans-
atlantic policy makers as a means to sustain 
our democratic futures.

TRIBUTE TO ALEXIS SANCHEZ— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Alexis San-
chez of the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los An-
geles, California. 
As a native Angeleno, Alexis Sanchez is a 
transgender woman and a fearless supporter 
of transgender rights in her community and 
across the country. Ms. Sanchez displays 
powerful personal initiative and leadership as 
an advocate for transgender rights empow-
ering those who may not realize they have a 
voice. Dedicated to public service, she de-
votes her time to community organizing, media 
advocacy, and volunteering to support the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
Alexis serves on the board of directors of 
Still Bisexual, a non-profit that seeks to raise 
bi+ visibility and advocate for mental health re-
sources for bi+ individuals. Ms. Sanchez is in-
volved in planning the City of West Holly-
wood’s Transgender Day of Remembrance 
and advocating for the creation of the first 
Transgender Day of Visibility in Los Angeles. 
Ms. Sanchez is also a member of the City 
of West Hollywood Transgender Advisory 
Board, which is responsible for addressing 
issues concerning transgender rights, as well 
as making recommendations regarding the 
adoption of policies that would benefit the 
community. She has led the City of West Hol-
lywood Transgender Advisory Board delega-
tion that travels to Washington, D.C. to meet 
with Members of Congress and the Congres-
sional LGBT Equality Caucus to discuss the 
importance of the transgender rights move-
ment in federal policy. 
Alexis works within the field of public policy 
to implement change that benefits her commu-
nity. She is an Assistant Program Manager at 
the Institute for Public Strategies, where she 
oversees a program centered on substance 
use disorders within the LGBTQ+ community. 
Alexis is currently collaborating with a coalition 
of state representatives to create a tool for law 
enforcement, researchers, community groups, 
and local municipalities to track methamphet-
amine data and research in the LGBTQ+ com-
munity. 
Ms. Sanchez spends her free time as a vol-
unteer and mentor with Brave Trails, a leader-
ship camp for LGBTQ+ teenagers and is an 
enthusiastic hiker and mountaineer. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Alexis San-
chez.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
MAJOR 
GENERAL DAVID F. WHERLEY, 
JR., DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NA-
TIONAL GUARD RETENTION AND 
COLLEGE ACCESS ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Major General David F. Wherley, 
Jr., District of Columbia National Guard Reten-
tion and College Access Act (NGRCA). This 
bill is named for General Wherley, former 
Commanding General of the D.C. National 
Guard, who, along with his wife, Ann, and 
seven others were tragically killed when Metro 
trains collided on the Red Line on June 22, 
2009. This bill would permanently authorize 
funding for a program that provides grants for 
higher education to members of the D.C. Na-
tional Guard, which is under the control of the 
federal, not the District of Columbia, govern-
ment. I renamed this bill after General 
Wherley because he worked tirelessly with me 
to get funding for the program for many years, 
and because of his devotion to the youth of 
the District and to the National Guard. 
The NGRCA authorizes an education incen-
tive 
program, 
recommended 
by 
General 
Wherley and his successor, Major General 
Errol Schwartz, to stem the troublesome loss 
of D.C. Guard members to other units, includ-
ing National Guards in surrounding states that 
offer 
such 
educational 
benefits 
to 
their 
Guards. I am grateful that Congress has con-
sistently provided funds for the program at our 
request, most recently $413,000 in fiscal year 
2020. Permanently authorizing the program is 
necessary, however, to ensure that D.C. 
Guard members receive the same treatment 
and benefits as other National Guard mem-
bers, particularly those in neighboring states 
that compete with the District for members 
and provide these education benefits. Today, 
the Guard for the nation’s capital has a dimin-
ished ability to compete for regional residents 
if membership in the Maryland or Virginia 
Guards is more economically beneficial. A 
competitive tuition assistance program for the 
D.C. Guard would provide a significant and 
much-needed incentive to help maintain enroll-
ment and level the field of competition. The 
federal government supports D.C. Guard func-
tions and understands it should support this 
small benefit as well, because the appropri-
ators have always funded the D.C. Guard pro-
gram, even without authorization. However, 
depending on appropriations alone leaves the 
D.C. Guard program in a tenuous condition at 
odds with the tuition programs in nearby 
states. Because the program is not controver-
sial, there is no reason not to permanently au-
thorize funding for these D.C. National Guard 
education benefits. 
I appreciate that the appropriators and ulti-
mately Congress have not hesitated to fund 
the education benefits for the D.C. National 
Guard. This support argues strongly for per-
manent authorization. These small education 
benefits have not only encouraged high-quality 
recruits, but have helped the D.C. Guard to 
maintain the force necessary to protect the 
federal presence here, including the possibility 
of a natural disaster or terrorist attack. I am 
pleased to introduce this bill based on the ad-
vice of Guard personnel, who best know what 
is necessary. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

(Monday, March 1) newsletter published a trib-
ute for Richard Wurmbrand of Bucharest, Ro-
mania. This tribute is a reminder to all Ameri-
cans of the tragic true inhumanity of totali-
tarian communism enforced by Soviet Social-
ists. 
THE VOICE OF THE MARTYRS 
THIS SATURDAY . . . 
THE VOICE OF THE MARTYRS 
This Saturday, February 29 (it is a leap 
year), is the anniversary of the arrest and 
imprisonment of Richard Wurmbrand in 1948. 
Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1909, Richard 
was sent to Moscow as an adolescent to 
study Marxism. He was pursued by the So-
viet secret police, and upon his return to Ro-
mania, he became a Comintern for the com-
munist regime. At the outbreak of the sec-
ond World War, he was converted to Christi-
anity and was later ordained, first as an An-
glican and then, as the war was almost over 
and his country occupied by the Soviet 
Union, a Lutheran. In 1944, he began a min-
istry to his Romanian countrymen and to 
Red Army soldiers. As the Soviet regime 
began to control churches, Wurmbrand began 
an ‘‘underground’’ ministry to his people. 
Within a few years, he denounced com-
munism as incompatible with Christianity. 
He was arrested on February 29, 1948, while 
on his way to church. 
Richard Wurmbrand passed through sev-
eral penal facilities and would spend three 
years in solitary confinement, twelve feet 
below ground without light or sound (the 
guards put felt under their shoes). He later 
recounted that he maintained his sanity by 
sleeping by day and staying awake at night 
preaching out loud a sermon to himself. 
Wurmbrand was released from prison in 
1956 after eight and half years. Warned not to 
preach again, he continued to serve the un-
derground churches and was arrested again 
in 1959 and sentenced to 25 years. During this 
second imprisonment, he was beaten and tor-
tured, including mutilation, burning, and 
being locked in a freezer icebox. Later, he re-
counted how his feet were beaten until the 
flesh was exposed, and then the next day 
beaten until the bones were exposed. 
In 1964, Norwegians paid the Communist 
regime 
$10,000 
for 
his 
release, 
and 
Wurmbrand and his wife would eventually 
emigrate to the United States. He died in 
2001 in California. 
During his time in the United States he 
authored almost 20 books and founded The 
Voice of the Martyrs, an organization that 
draws attention to the persecuted church 
worldwide. 
Here is one of Wurmbrand’s famous quotes: 
‘‘I have seen Christians in Communist pris-
ons with fifty pounds of chains on their feet, 
tortured with red-hot iron pokers, in whose 
throats spoonfuls of salt had been forced, 
being kept afterward without water, starv-
ing, whipped, suffering from cold—and pray-
ing with fervor for the Communists. This is 
humanly inexplicable! It is the love of 
Christ, which was poured out in our hearts.’’ 
—Derek W.H. Thomas, Senior Minister.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO EN-
SURE FAIR ACCESS AND OPPOR-
TUNITY TO FEDERAL JOBS FOR 
ALL AMERICANS 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce a bill to ensure fair access 
and opportunity to federal jobs for all Ameri-
cans. 
For close to two decades now, I and many 
of my colleagues have been fighting to in-
crease diversity in the international affairs and 
national security sector. I have called for a di-
versity plan from the Director of National Intel-
ligence, as well as for the Department of State 
and USAID. Last year, the House Armed 
Services Committee held a hearing entitled, 
‘‘Diversity in Recruiting and Retention: In-
creasing Diversity in the Military—What the 
Military Services are Doing.’’ And only last 
week, Senators held an event bringing atten-
tion to the February Report: ‘‘State Depart-
ment: Additional Steps are Needed to Identify 
Potential Barriers to Diversity.’’ My colleagues 
and I have been engaged in these efforts not 
because they are nice or correct, but because 
they are what is in the best interest for the 
survival of our nation. 
The U.S. workforce is becoming more ra-
cially, ethnically, and otherwise diverse, with 
estimates that by 2050 over half of the work-
force will be made up of Americans from di-
verse populations. Jobs across our govern-
ment, whether they are in the military, intel-
ligence, foreign service, health or education 
sectors, will require that we not only hire, but 
also retain a more diverse federal workforce to 
sustain the needs of our country and remain 
a stable democracy. 
To do so, we must have a plan. My bill calls 
for a government-wide diversity and inclusion 
plan that ensures that all branches of govern-
ment are engaged in multi-year strategic plan-
ning that recruits, hires, promotes, retains, and 
supports leadership from America’s diverse 
talent pool in the federal workforce for the 
good of our country. It also calls for a review 
of diversity in government contracting and 
grantmaking, as both are often also pathways 
to government jobs. 
Diversity 
and 
inclusion 
are 
the 
underpinnings of democratic societies. It is 
time that we enforce democratic values by en-
suring all segments of our society have equal 
access and opportunity to contribute to a vi-
brant workforce that is at the heart of our de-
mocracy for the future of our nation.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS 
CLUB 
OF 
NORTHERN 
CHAU-
TAUQUA COUNTY 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 12, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Boys and Girls Club of Northern Chautauqua 
County. This important organization is pro-
viding vital services to the children and fami-
lies of this area, and it is good to recognize 
their work. 
The Boys and Girls Club of Northern Chau-
tauqua County serves hundreds of youths a 
year and has six sites throughout Northern 
Chautauqua County. In 1994, the club was 
founded as a satellite program of the James-
town Boys and Girls Club in Southern Chau-
tauqua County. Space in the Masonic building 
on Central Avenue in Dunkirk was secured for 
the program and Jim Szwejbka became the 
first program director. 
In 1996, the Boys and Girls Club of North-
ern Chautauqua County was incorporated as 
an independent club with Lynn Dorler as the 
first executive director for the club. Since that 
time, the club has provided after school activi-
ties and a positive environment that fosters re-
lationship building, confidence building and a 
focus on healthy lifestyles through a variety of 
programs. 
The club has had a variety of homes over 
the years. In 2006, the club moved to former 
Dunkirk School Number Six on Benton Street, 
had transitioned to the former St. Hyacinth 
School on Lake Shore Drive in 2010 and has 
recently found a new space in the Salvation 
Army building on Central Avenue. 
The work this organization has done in the 
Dunkirk community and beyond has been in-
strumental in the lives of so many children and 
their families. For the past twenty-five years, 
this organization has become a cornerstone in 
youth programming in the area and I can’t wait 
to see what they do in the next twenty-five 
years. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
recognize the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Boys and Girls Club of Northern Chautauqua 
County.

Tina Brown has been teaching at Kennett 
Middle School for 23 years. Every year she 
plans a trip for her students to attend the 
Wreaths Across America ceremony. She has 
also organized trips to treasured archives and 
military memorials throughout the state of Mis-
souri and in the heart of Southeast Missouri 
such as the Stars and Stripes Museum in 
Bloomfield, Missouri. She even brought a 
class out to Washington, D.C. where I had the 
opportunity to meet these young students on 
the steps of the United States Capitol building 
and where her students were able to see the 
Vietnam War memorial. Trips like these are an 
important part of her teaching. They help stu-
dents experience our nation’s history in a tan-
gible, lasting way and educate our future gen-
erations on the world of opportunities ahead of 
them. 
Tina’s phenomenal generosity extends be-
yond the classroom. She was the Chairperson 
of the Gold Star Monument for Dunklin county 
in 2019 and helped organize middle school 
students to raise money for this monument. 
Her efforts were fueled by her firm belief that 
there was a need in the community to recog-
nize the families who have lost loved ones in 
service to our country. The monument is now 
awaiting placement in downtown Kennett, 
where it will be a reminder of those brave lives 
lost and of the compassion and patriotism of 
community members such as Tina. 
I’m inspired not only by Tina’s work but by 
her dedication to our servicemen and women. 
Tina’s brother Frankie died while fighting for 
his country in Vietnam. Frankie was one of the 
brave young men that risked their lives for the 
sake of our country and tragically passed 
away fighting for our freedom. Tina was young 
when her brother died but remembers the pro-
found loss that her family felt with Frankie’s 
passing. By teaching the importance of leader-
ship and patriotism to her students, she hon-
ors his memory and keeps it alive for herself 
and others. 
Tina is retiring from teaching this year to 
spend more time on the farm with her family. 
She will be greatly missed by students, fac-
ulty, and community members alike whose 
lives have been touched by her generosity 
and patriotism, as I have been. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Tina Brown for receiving this 
award.
