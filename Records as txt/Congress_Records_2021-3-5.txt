PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who rules the raging of 
the sea, use our lawmakers to bring 
stability to our Nation through wise 
and knowledgeable leadership. Remind 
them to be quick to listen, slow to 
speak, and slow to anger. Give them 
the wisdom to understand that moral 
rot within a nation can topple its gov-
ernment. 
Lord, inspire our Senators to pursue 
justice, to love mercy, and to work 
with humility. Help them also to re-
member that You rescue the blameless 
from harm. 
And, Lord, give a special blessing to 
Your faithful servants who worked

We pray in Your faithful Name. 
Amen.

THANKING SENATE STAFF 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first and foremost, I want to thank ev-
eryone—everyone on the floor staff 
who worked late into the night and 
into the wee hours of the morning to 
finish reading the Senate amendment 
to the American Rescue Plan. 
The folks who sit up here on the dais 
come to work every day with a very se-
rious job to do, helping the Senate 
come to life and fulfill its purpose 
under the Constitution. I am sure you 
all didn’t expect that part of your job 
this week would entail standing on 
your feet and reading dense legislation 
for more than 10 hours straight. 
I can’t imagine that is anyone’s idea 
of a good time, but, as usual, our staff 
took their additional duties in stride 
and carried them out with profes-
sionalism and grace, finishing around 3 
in the morning, and you are all right 
back on your posts this morning. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you for 
your service, your dedication. You are 
the unsung heroes of this place. 
To all of the critical workers, not 
just those here on the dais—the clerks, 
the stenographers, the Capitol Police 
officers, the floor staff—to all of you: 
Thank you, thank you, thank you for 
your efforts yesterday and every day. 
And as for our friend from Wisconsin, 
I 
hope 
he 
enjoyed 
his 
Thursday 
evening.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a 
year ago this week, Congress began 
work on what would become the 
CARES Act, the opening salvo in a 
yearlong battle against what, at the 
time, was a strange and new disease. I 
don’t think anyone could have antici-
pated that a year hence we would have 
lost more than 10 million jobs and over 
half a million citizens. 
Even as the vaccine makes its way 
across the country, and hope shimmers 
on the horizon, millions of Americans

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1218 
March 5, 2021 
are still struggling with basic neces-
sities. Folks are thousands of dollars 
behind on the rent and utilities. Their 
heat, water and power are getting shut 
off. More than a million Americans on 
unemployment insurance report that 
their kids aren’t getting enough to eat. 
Sometimes the macrostatistics get in 
the way because the top end is doing 
very well, the top 10 percent or 25 per-
cent, but so many other people are 
struggling. And if you just look at a 
big number, you say: Oh, everything is 
getting a little better. It is not for the 
lower half of America. It is not. 
I read about one of my constituents 
recently, 
Allilsa 
Fernandez, 
from 
Queens, who had a job as a home 
healthcare aide lined up at the start of 
the pandemic but couldn’t take it be-
cause of her family’s preexisting med-
ical conditions. Her mother was in the 
hospital with COVID. Her income went 
from $3,400 a month to just $1,000. 
It was a huge, huge loss— 
She said. 
I have medications, my electric bill, the 
phone bill, and [the] other costs. Every day 
you . . . have to make . . . decisions: Am I 
going to eat? 
In America, that should not be the 
case. It shouldn’t be at any time but 
particularly when an evil disease has 
robbed our hard-working people of 
their income, their livelihood. 
‘‘Am I going to eat?’’ And we are sup-
posed to sit here and do nothing? We 
are supposed to say to Ms. Fernandez, 
and so many like her, we are not giving 
you the help you need? 
Ms. Fernandez hasn’t been able to 
pay the rent since April of last year, 
over $16,000 worth. And this bill will 
help people like her, but it will also 
prevent people from getting into Ms. 
Fernandez’s place: people who work for 
State 
and 
local 
governments 
who 
might be laid off, people who work for 
small businesses who might be laid off. 
It is the job of this government, dur-
ing this evil pandemic, to assist Amer-
ican families, businesses, and workers 
like Ms. Fernandez until this pandemic 
is over. It is also our job to prevent 
others from falling into the same awful 
situation that Ms. Fernandez finds her-
self. It is our job to hasten the day 
when Americans can go back to work, 
our country can go back to normal, our 
economy can come roaring back. We 
can reduce that awfully high actual 10 
percent unemployment. That is what 
the American Rescue Plan will do. 
It will send direct checks to Amer-
ican workers and families struggling 
with the cost of groceries, medicine, 
and the rent. The vast majority of 
Americans will get the full $1,400 we 
have asked for. It will help reopen 
schools as quickly and safely as pos-
sible. It will help the hardest hit small 
businesses hang on. It will keep fire-
fighters and teachers and busdrivers 
and sanitation workers on the job. It 
will help American families stay in 
their homes, care for their children, 
put food on the table, and it will give 
our country the resources, the vaccina-
tion and testing, that it needs to crush 
the virus once and for all. 
All told, the American Rescue Plan 
will be one of the largest anti-poverty 
bills in recent history, cutting child 
poverty just about in half. The entire 
country has gotten behind the bill: 
business leaders, mayors, Governors, 
from big cities, small towns, Red 
States, Blue States, Democrat, Repub-
lican. 
The clear majority of the American 
people—Democrats, Independents, and 
Republicans—all support the American 
Rescue Plan. It seems the only group 
in America who doesn’t support the 
American Rescue Plan are Washington 
Republicans. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle say $1.9 trillion is too expen-
sive. Well, my Republican colleagues 
didn’t think it was too expensive when 
they gave nearly the same amount in 
tax breaks to corporations and the 
ultrarich in a healthy economy, not 
one that is struggling. 
My colleagues claim this bill isn’t re-
lated to COVID. What hogwash. It is a 
strange thing to say because most of 
the measures in the bill are exactly the 
same ideas Republicans supported a 
year ago in the CARES Act, which 
passed without a single dissenting Re-
publican vote. 
Direct checks, in the CARES Act; en-
hanced unemployment insurance, in 
the CARES Act; assistance for State 
and local governments, in the CARES 
Act; funding for testing and the vac-
cine, in the CARES Act; aid to schools 
and small businesses, in the CARES 
Act. All of them were in the CARES 
Act, which every Republican voted for, 
and now they are saying the American 
Rescue Plan, which has the basic, same 
structure, is not related to COVID. 
When we passed the CARES Act, we 
all thought that maybe COVID would 
be gone by the summer. It isn’t. We 
need to keep at it in the same way. 
Every single Republican who voted for 
the CARES Act and those ideas a year 
ago, when a Republican was in the 
White House and Republicans con-
trolled the Senate, is now saying no, it 
seems. But now that a Democrat is in 
the White House, now that Democrats 
control the Senate, those same ideas, 
which they supported when Trump was 
President and MCCONNELL was major-
ity leader, are a liberal wish list—same 
ideas. Who the heck are they kidding? 
They have no good answer. 
But let’s face it, we need to get this 
done. It would be so much better if we 
could in a bipartisan way, but we need 
to get it done. 
We are not going to make the same 
mistake we made after the last eco-
nomic downturn when Congress did too 
little to help the Nation rebound, lock-
ing us into a long, slow, painful recov-
ery, where it was years before employ-
ment was back to where it was before 
that crisis. 
We are not, we are not going to be 
timid in the face of big challenges. We 
are not, we are not going to delay when 
urgent action is called for. The Senate 
will move forward today with the 
American Rescue Plan. There will be a 
lengthy amendment process, as the 
rules of the Senate require. The Senate 
is going to take a lot of votes, but we 
are going to power through and finish 
this bill however long it takes. The 
American people are counting on us, 
and our Nation depends on it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll.

I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
today or tonight or tomorrow, Demo-
crats say they will break the bipar-
tisan streak that has defined the pan-
demic response up until now. They are 
dead set on ramming through an ideo-
logical spending spree packed with 
non-COVID-related policies. 
This is just what a leading House 
Democrat admitted they would do back 
at the start of the crisis: Exploit the 
pandemic as ‘‘a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit our 
vision.’’ To give them credit, they 
never hid the ball. That is how you get 
a 628-page bill that costs nearly $2 tril-
lion, but only 9 percent addresses the 
fight against the virus itself and only 1 
percent—1 percent—for the lifesaving 
vaccines that are ending this night-
mare as we speak. 
That is how you craft a bill that does 
nothing to immediately get kids back 
to classrooms. In fact, that spends only 
5 percent of the K–12 school money this 
fiscal year. 
This isn’t a pandemic rescue pack-
age; it is a parade of leftwing pet 
projects they are ramming through 
during a pandemic. 
There is a costly ObamaCare bailout 
that will disproportionately benefit 
wealthier people; payments to farmers 
and ranchers based solely on the demo-
graphics of the recipient without any 
regard to actual need; and a massive 
cash bailout for mismanaged State and 
local governments, multiple times the 
size of COVID needs. 
Instead of pushing back on the anti- 
science bullying from Big Labor that is 
locking kids out of the classrooms, 
they buy into it. 
They want to create generous new 
benefits for parents who are dealing

with school closures but only if they 
are Federal employees. To all the par-
ents without government jobs, no such 
luck. 
There are provisions to let abortion 
providers raid the small business res-
cue funds that were meant for Main 
Street businesses. 
They want to pay people a bonus not 
to go back to work when we are trying 
to rebuild our economy. 
There is an effort to create a 
brandnew, sprawling cash welfare pro-
gram—not the one-time checks but 
constant payments—that ignores the 
pro-work lessons of bipartisan welfare 
reform and which the White House has 
already stated they want to make per-
manent. 
The unrelated liberal policies are 
simply endless. It is like they have for-
gotten we have a pandemic to fight. 
Larry Summers, a top economist in 
both the Clinton and Obama adminis-
trations, says this plan piles way more 
debt on our kids and grandkids than we 
need to spend right now. That is Larry 
Summers, 
Bill 
Clinton’s 
Secretary 
Treasury. Jason Furman, who chaired 
President Obama’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, said the State and 
local bailouts are ‘‘overkill.’’ These are 
liberal economists, Madam President. 
By one analysis, the Democrats’ 
extra cash bonuses for laid-off workers 
who stay home will result in almost 60 
percent 
of 
workers 
earning 
more 
money staying home than they would 
earn from returning to work—more 
money by staying home than they 
would earn from returning to work. 
What a great idea. This isn’t State un-
employment insurance; it is borrowing 
from our kids and grandkids to pay yet 
an additional cash bonus for not work-
ing. 
This would extend deep into 2021, 
when we anticipate serious job growth. 
Just this morning, we had a jobs report 
that shattered expectations, nearly 
doubling the job growth experts had ex-
pected to see. 
This is what the Washington Post 
says about this mess. This is the Wash-
ington Post about this mess that is be-
fore us: 
For policy experts and even members of 
Biden’s own party, the improving picture is 
raising questions about whether the stim-
ulus bill is mismatched to the needs of the 
current moment. 
That is from the Washington Post 
editorial. 
It is mismatched all right because it 
was never designed to meet Americans’ 
needs. The goal was to ‘‘restructure 
things to fit’’ their ‘‘vision.’’ That is 
why there was no bipartisan process 
after a year of completely bipartisan 
COVID bills that we worked on to-
gether. That is why the Senate Repub-
licans who went to the White House to 
propose working together were told: No 
thanks; take it or leave it. 
This is such a poorly targeted rush 
job that Democrats can’t even settle on 
one set of political spin. The White 
House Chief of Staff is going around 
town admitting that they have written 
‘‘the most progressive domestic legisla-
tion in a generation.’’ That is the 
White House Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, 
here in the Senate, Democrats are still 
pretending this is some down-the-mid-
dle proposal and lecturing us for not 
supporting it. They can’t even get their 
stories straight. 
The administration campaigned on 
ushering in a new day of unity and bi-
partisanship, but in 2020, under Repub-
lican leadership, the Senate negotiated 
five rescue bills totaling $4 trillion, 
and none of them got fewer than 90 
votes. That is how this Senate was run 
last year in a time of divided govern-
ment, and now, in this supposed new 
era of healing leadership, we are about 
to watch one party ram through a par-
tisan package on the thinnest margins. 
Go figure. 
Republicans have many ideas to im-
prove the bill, many ideas, and we are 
about to vote on all kinds of amend-
ments in the hopes that some of these 
ideas make it into the final product. 
We are going to try to improve the bill. 
The millions who elected 50 Republican 
Senators will have their voices heard 
loud and clear. 
Our country is already set for a roar-
ing recovery. We are already on track 
to bounce back from this crisis. That is 
not because of this bill; it is because of 
our work last year. This is a trend this 
new Democratic government inherited. 
We are going to come roaring back and 
mostly not because of this bill—in fact, 
in some ways, in spite of this bill. It 
will be because of the bipartisan foun-
dation we laid last year and the 
strength and resilience of our people. 
Democrats inherited a tide that was al-
ready turning. 
We could have worked together to do 
something smart to finish this fight as 
fast as possible. Democrats decided to 
do something else.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will resume consideration of 
H.R. 1319, which the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1319) to provide for reconcili-
ation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 5. 
Pending: 
Schumer amendment No. 891, of a per-
fecting nature. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Vermont. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENTS 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that for the du-
ration of the Senate’s consideration of 
H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021, the majority and Repub-
lican managers of the bill, while seated 
or standing at the managers’ desks, be 
permitted to deliver floor remarks, re-
trieve, review, and edit documents, and 
send email and other data communica-
tions from text displayed on wireless 
personal digital assistant devices and 
tablet devices. 
What do we think about that? 
All right. I further ask unanimous 
consent that the use of calculators be 
permitted on the floor during consider-
ation of the bill; further, that the staff 
be permitted to make technical and 
conforming changes to the bill, if nec-
essary, consistent with the amend-
ments adopted during Senate consider-
ation of the bill. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 972 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To provide for increases in the 
Federal minimum wage) 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment No. 972. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Vermont [Mr. SANDERS], 
for himself and others, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 972 to amendment No. 891. 
Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the reading of the amend-
ment be dispensed with. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of March 4, 2021 under ‘‘Text of 
Amendments.’’) 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
rise to offer an amendment to increase 
the Federal minimum wage from a 
starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 
an hour over a 5-year period. 
As I think you know, Congress has 
not raised the minimum wage since 
2007. The result of that is that half of 
our people are now living paycheck to 
paycheck, and many, in fact, are work-
ing for wages that are much too low in 
order to take care of their families. So, 
to my mind, the American people in 
poll after poll and State after State un-
derstand that we have to raise that 
minimum wage to a living wage of 15 
bucks an hour. I intend to do every-
thing that I can to make that happen, 
and I will be offering that amendment 
this morning.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1220 
March 5, 2021 
Madam President, before I do that, 
let me begin my remarks by explaining 
why this reconciliation bill that we are 
debating today, the American Rescue 
Plan, is so enormously important that 
it must be passed and must be passed 
as quickly as possible, in my view. This 
legislation is the most consequential 
and significant legislation for working 
families that Congress has debated for 
many, many decades. 
Now, why is that? 
The answer is that, as I think all 
Americans know, the last year that we 
have gone through has been, in so 
many ways, the very worst year in our 
lifetimes. That is what it has been. The 
working families of our country today 
are hurting in a way that they have 
not hurt since the Great Depression, 
and they want their government to 
hear their pain and come to their aid, 
and that is not too much to ask. 
There are a lot of folks in this coun-
try—there are estimates of maybe 30 to 
40 percent of Americans—who have lit-
erally given up on democracy. They are 
moving toward authoritarianism. They 
are hurting. Their kids are hurting. 
Their parents are hurting. They look 
to Washington for help in their demo-
cratic society, and they don’t see 
Washington responding. What they see 
year after year are policies which 
make the very, very rich richer, which 
enable large, profitable corporations to 
not pay a nickel in taxes, but for them, 
they face eviction; they face hunger; 
they don’t have healthcare; they can’t 
afford to send their kids to college. 
They are asking: Does anybody—any-
body—in Washington care about their 
lives? 
So what today is about, in a very pro-
found way, is whether or not we stand 
with the working class of this country 
and say: Yes, we live in a democratic 
society. We understand what you are 
going through, and we are going to 
move as aggressively as we can to re-
spond to your pain and improve your 
lives. 
This is not just a healthcare bill. It is 
not just an economic bill. It is not just 
an educational bill. It is perhaps more 
than that. This is a bill which will an-
swer a profound question: Are we living 
in a democratic society, where the U.S. 
Congress will respond to the needs of 
working families rather than just the 
wealthy and large corporations and 
their lobbyists? That is what today is 
about. It is dealing with the pandemic. 
It is dealing with the economy. It is 
dealing with education and so much 
more, but most importantly it is deal-
ing with the issue of whether or not we 
are hearing the pain that is out there 
and if we are responding to it. 
During the last year, as everybody 
knows, over 500,000 Americans have 
died of COVID, and millions more have 
been made ill. Unbelievable. It is unbe-
lievable what we have gone through in 
terms of this terrible pandemic. COVID 
has not only caused massive death and 
illness; it has resulted in a way we 
have never experienced social isola-
tion. That means, all over this coun-
try, we have old people, elderly people, 
in their homes. They can’t interact 
with their grandchildren, with their 
own kids, with their friends. You have 
young people who want to go to school, 
who want to socialize, who want to 
date, who want to do things that young 
people do. They can’t do it and have 
been unable to do it for the last year, 
and that has resulted in a very sharp 
increase in mental illness in this coun-
try—something, by the way, that this 
legislation 
also 
deals 
with. 
Many 
Americans, young and old and middle- 
aged, are now dealing with depression, 
anxiety disorder, addictions. We are 
seeing the growth of addictions and 
even suicidal ideation. So this has been 
just an awful year for people in our 
country and, in fact, throughout the 
world. 
This last year has not only been a 
public health crisis, as bad as that has 
been. The pandemic, as we all know, 
has led to a terrible economic down-
turn, which has resulted in millions of 
Americans losing their jobs and their 
incomes, and it has led to the shutting 
down of something like one out of four 
small businesses in this country. That 
is just an unbelievable number. Go to 
any town in America, and you will see 
its Main Street shuttered down. Thriv-
ing businesses no longer exist. Real un-
employment in this country today is 
now over 10 percent. 
Further, countless Americans face 
the threat of eviction. We have a mora-
torium on evictions, which is the right 
thing, but there is going to be a day 
when that ends. People are saying: I 
am $5,000, $8,000 in debt. What happens 
to me when the moratorium ends? How 
am I going to pay my rent? Am I going 
to be one of the 500,000 people already 
sleeping out on the streets? 
Millions more—and we have seen this 
in Vermont, and I know the Acting 
President pro tempore has probably 
seen it in Minnesota, for it is all over 
this country—are lining up in their 
cars for food, and it is something that 
none of us ever dreamed. It is right in 
my own community of Burlington, 
VT—hundreds of people, while in their 
cars, lining up for food. Many of them, 
never in a million years, would have 
dreamed that they would be in that po-
sition. Today, the level of hunger in 
America is at the highest level it has 
been in decades. 
Then, on top of all of that, we are in 
the midst of a pandemic. People are 
scared to death about coming down 
with COVID. Yet, because of our dys-
functional healthcare system, we have 
over 90 million people who are unin-
sured or underinsured in the midst of a 
pandemic. 
It is not only the public health crisis 
we worry about; it is not only the col-
lapse of our economy that we have to 
worry about; it is what is happening to 
our young people because the pandemic 
has created a massive disruption in our 
educational system, from childcare 
through graduate school. The majority 
of our young people have seen edu-
cation disrupted. Think about all of 
the implications of what that means. It 
is likely that hundreds of colleges in 
America, which were struggling before 
the pandemic, will cease to exist. 
So you have the public health crisis 
with a half a million people dead, an 
economic crisis with real unemploy-
ment at 10 percent and small busi-
nesses going out of business, and an 
educational crisis. 
Meanwhile, in the midst of all of 
that, it is important to note that not 
everybody in this country is hurting. 
What we are seeing, in the midst of 
massive income and wealth inequality, 
is a moment when, in fact, that gap be-
tween the very, very rich and every-
body else is growing wider. Incredibly, 
during this pandemic, over 650 billion-
aires in America have increased their 
wealth by more than $1 trillion. The 
50—five zero—richest people in Amer-
ica now own more wealth than the bot-
tom half of American society, some 160 
million people. 
So the bottom line here is very sim-
ple: In this moment of unprecedented 
crises, the U.S. Senate must respond to 
the pain of working families all across 
this country, and we must respond in 
an unprecedented way, which is what 
this legislation is about. 
Now I want to say a few words about 
some of what is in this bill. This is a 
600-page bill, and I will not read it all 
again. I think our clerks had enough 
fun reading it last night, but I do want 
to summarize some of what is in it. 
Most importantly, what the Amer-
ican people want is, they want to get 
back to a normal life. They want their 
kids to go to school. They want to go 
to work. They want their businesses 
open. And what the American Rescue 
Plan does is enable us to aggressively 
crush this pandemic and enable the 
American people to return to their jobs 
and their schools. 
It will establish a national emer-
gency program to produce the quantity 
of vaccines that we need and get them 
into the arms of our people as quickly 
as possible. Clearly, we are making 
progress in that area. More and more 
people are getting vaccinated. But we 
still have a lot of work to do, and this 
legislation will enable us to do that. 
At a time when so many of our peo-
ple are hurting, this legislation will 
allow us to provide $1,400 in direct pay-
ment to every working-class person in 
this country and to their kids, and this 
is on top of the $600 that we provided 
last month. So if you are out there and 
you are a family of four earning less 
than $150,000 or an individual earning 
less than $75,000, you are going to get 
that check for $1,400, and for that fam-
ily of four, that is $5,600. 
Now, I know that to some that isn’t 
a whole lot of money. You know, 5,600 
bucks ain’t that much. But for a family 
that is struggling right now and can’t 
pay their rent and can’t feed their kids, 
that $5,600 for a family of four could be 
the difference between desperation and 
dignity.

Further, at a time when so many of 
our people are unemployed, this Budget 
Reconciliation Act will provide $400 a 
week in supplemental unemployment 
benefits to over 10 million Americans 
until the end of August. If you are un-
employed right now, you are worried— 
if your unemployment check is your 
only source of income, you are worried 
that it is going to cease, well, it is not. 
This legislation will continue that 
check coming until the end of August. 
This legislation understands that we 
have a childcare crisis in America, and 
we provide the resources to provide 
childcare to 875,000 children. 
And very importantly—we don’t talk 
about this enough—one of the absolute 
disgraces of our economy right now is 
the level of childhood poverty in Amer-
ica, which is one of the highest for any 
major country on Earth. This legisla-
tion will go a long way toward cutting 
childhood poverty. Some studies sug-
gest we are going to cut it in half by 
expanding the child tax credit from 
$2,000 to $3,000 and $3,600 for kids under 
the age of 6. In other words, we are 
about to cut childhood poverty in half 
in this country. 
This 
legislation, 
obviously, 
deals 
with the horror of so many of our peo-
ple facing hunger. We put in very sub-
stantial amounts of money for nutri-
tion assistance for working families, 
for kids, for the disabled, and the elder-
ly. 
This legislation will provide rent re-
lief, utility assistance, and mortgage 
assistance to millions of tenants and 
homeowners who are in danger of evic-
tion and foreclosure. 
This legislation will protect the pen-
sions of many millions of workers who 
are in danger of seeing their retirement 
benefits cut by as much as 65 percent. 
Not only is this $1.9 trillion emer-
gency COVID relief package the right 
thing to do for people from a moral 
perspective, it is exactly what the 
overwhelming majority of the Amer-
ican people want us to do. 
The American people didn’t want us 
to give tax breaks to billionaires. The 
American people did not want, as the 
Republicans fought to do, throw 30 mil-
lion people off the Affordable Care Act. 
The American people didn’t want that, 
but that is what the Republicans tried 
to do under reconciliation. 
Well, we have a different idea. Yeah, 
we are going to use reconciliation, 
which requires only 51 votes. We are 
going to use it, not for tax breaks for 
the rich, not to throw people off of 
healthcare but to provide the help that 
working-class people need all across 
this country. 
Madam President, I am introducing, 
as I mentioned earlier, legislation—an 
amendment—today to raise the min-
imum wage to 15 bucks an hour. 
Because of an unfortunate and, in my 
view, misguided decision by the Parlia-
mentarian, this reconciliation bill does 
not include an increase in the min-
imum wage to $15 an hour. In my view, 
it should have, and I think the Parlia-
mentarian was dead wrong. 
But more importantly, it is an ab-
surd 
process 
that 
we 
allow 
an 
unelected staffer, somebody who works 
for the Senate, not elected by anybody, 
to make a decision as to whether 30 
million Americans get a pay raise or 
not. I don’t care how the Parliamen-
tarian 
rules. 
No 
Parliamentarian 
should have that power. 
If people here want to vote against 
raising the minimum wage, you have 
that right. You want to vote for it, and 
I hope you do, you have that right. But 
we should not shuffle off that responsi-
bility to an unelected staffer. That is 
wrong. 
The amendment I am offering today 
to raise that minimum wage to $15 an 
hour is cosponsored by Majority Leader 
SCHUMER, and I thank him for his 
strong support; Senator PATTY MUR-
RAY, who is the chair of the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee; Senator RON WYDEN, who is the 
chair of the Finance Committee; and 
many others in this Chamber. 
In fact, this amendment is similar in 
many ways to the legislation that I 
have offered which is cosponsored by 38 
Members of the Senate. 
And let us not forget, this legislation 
was passed in the House, and I want to 
thank my friends and colleagues in the 
House Progressive Caucus for their ex-
traordinary leadership on this issue. 
This amendment is supported by 
some 300 national organizations, in-
cluding the AFL–CIO, and virtually all 
of the major unions in our country. I 
want to thank in particular the SEIU, 
one of the great unions in America, 
who have led this effort for years in 
terms of the Fight for $15, where people 
working in McDonald’s and Burger 
King have gone out on strike and said: 
No, we can’t make it on 10 bucks an 
hour, 11 bucks an hour. I want to thank 
the SEIU. 
And this legislation will help workers 
all across the board, but it will signifi-
cantly help women who are unfortu-
nately forced into low-income work 
more than the general population, 
more than men, and it will dispropor-
tionately help African Americans and 
Latinos, who disproportionately are 
forced into low-income work. This leg-
islation is supported not only by 300 or-
ganizations but by groups like the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights. They understand that if 
we are going improve the standard of 
living of the African-American commu-
nity, we ought to raise that minimum 
wage. 
It is supported by the National Orga-
nization for Women because, again, 
this raising the minimum wage is a 
women’s issue in a very significant 
way—not totally, believe me. There are 
a lot of men out there who are working 
for 9, 10, 11 bucks an hour, but dis-
proportionately it impacts women. 
It is supported by Unidos and other 
Latino organizations. It is supported 
by the American Association of Univer-
sity Women, supported by Indivisible, 
Justice for Migrant Women, the Na-
tional Domestic Workers Alliance, and 
the National Women’s Law Center. 
Here is the simple truth, and that is 
that in the richest country in the his-
tory of the world, we can no longer tol-
erate millions of our workers being un-
able to feed their families because they 
are working for starvation wages. And 
that is not what I say, although I do 
say it; it is what the President of the 
United States says. He very, very 
strongly supports raising the minimum 
wage to $15 an hour, and I thank him 
for his support. 
You know, when we look at the econ-
omy, people look at the stock market, 
and they look at a whole lot of indices 
out there, but at the end of the day, we 
have to ask ourselves: What is going on 
in the lives of ordinary people? It is not 
acceptable to me that half of our peo-
ple are living paycheck to paycheck 
and millions of people are trying to get 
by on 9, 10, 11 bucks an hour. And do 
you know what? You can’t do that. You 
can’t do that in Vermont, and you 
can’t do it in California, and you can’t 
do it in Minnesota. You can’t do that. 
Our job is to make sure that we have 
an economy that works for all and not 
just for the few, and in order to do 
that, we are going to have to raise that 
minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. 
Frankly, it is disgraceful that Con-
gress has not passed an increase in the 
minimum wage since 2007. Think of all 
the things that have transpired since 
then. But Congress has not raised the 
minimum wage since 2007. 
The reality is that the minimum 
wage has lost over 30 percent of its pur-
chasing power since 1968. The minimum 
wage is worth a lot less now than it 
used to be. When we increase the min-
imum wage, we will be giving over 32 
million Americans a much needed pay 
raise. 
Let’s be clear. Raising the minimum 
wage to $15 an hour is an enormously 
popular idea. More than 60 percent of 
the American people, in poll after poll, 
support raising the minimum wage. 
Since 1998—this is really amazing. 
You know, I have some friends here 
who are nervous: Oh, my goodness, how 
radical can it be? Should we raise the 
minimum wage? Oh, my God, I am 
scared of the American Restaurant As-
sociation. 
Well, since 1998, every time a State 
has had an initiative on the ballot to 
raise the minimum wage, it has won. In 
conservative 
States, 
in 
progressive 
States, put it on the ballot, it wins. 
Just as one example, in November, 
just this last November, election time, 
Joe Biden lost Florida. Donald Trump 
won Florida by three points. But in 
that same election, the people of Flor-
ida—and I say that to the two Senators 
from Florida—61 percent of the people 
in Florida voted to raise the minimum 
wage to 15 bucks an hour. Florida 
voted for Donald Trump and voted to 
raise the minimum wage to $15 an 
hour. 
Eight 
States—over 
the 
years, 
8 
States and over 40 cities have adopted

March 5, 2021 
laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 
an hour. It is not a radical idea. 
And, as you know, over just a few 
days ago, the House of Representatives 
did the right thing and voted to raise 
the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This 
is not a radical idea. People want it. 
States have done it. The House of Rep-
resentatives has done it, and now it is 
our turn to do what the American peo-
ple want. 
Now, in the last few days, I have 
heard some concerns from my col-
leagues about one part of our amend-
ment, and that is the provision to raise 
the tip wage, which now stands—I want 
everybody to hear that—the tip wage 
for waiters and waitresses and all those 
people who get tips now stands at $2.13 
an hour. No, you did not mishear me— 
$2.13 an hour. That is the Federal min-
imum wage for waiters and waitresses, 
for barbers, for hairstylists, for park-
ing attendants, and others. That tip 
minimum wage has not been raised 
since 1991, 30 years ago. 
You think maybe it is time to raise 
the tip wage from $2.13 an hour, passed 
30 years ago? I think so. The proposal 
in this legislation would raise that tip 
wage from $2.13 an hour to $14.95 over a 
7-year period. 
Now, time and again, our legislation 
gets misrepresented. People say: Oh, 
you are raising the minimum wage to 
$15 an hour tomorrow. No, we are not. 
The tip wage is going to take 7 years. 
For better or worse, that is what it is. 
Now, the National Restaurant Asso-
ciation, a very powerful lobbying orga-
nization, has suggested to Members of 
Congress that this legislation is op-
posed by restaurant workers and would 
be harmful to their interests. This is 
not true. 
One Fair Wage, an organization rep-
resenting service employees, has just 
delivered to the White House a petition 
with 140,000 signatures from service 
workers who are demanding that they 
receive the same minimum wage as 
every other worker in their State. 
Polling among service employees and 
nonservice employees also supports the 
reality that Americans want our wait-
ers and waitresses and other service 
employees to get a fair minimum wage. 
Now, I heard from some people that 
those people who are working in the 
service industry are doing really well, 
you know, and they don’t want an in-
crease in the Federal minimum wage. 
The tips that they are receiving are 
covering all of their needs. ‘‘Leave well 
enough alone,’’ they say. Well, today, 
70 percent of tipped workers are women 
who suffer from three times the pov-
erty rate of the rest of the U.S. work-
force. They are not doing so well. They 
use food stamps at double the rate of 
the general workforce and suffer, by 
the way, from the highest rates of sex-
ual harassment of any industry be-
cause they must tolerate inappropriate 
customer behavior to get the incomes 
that they need. 
Further—and this is important, and I 
want all of my colleagues to hear this. 
The idea of moving tipped wages to the 
same level as the overall minimum 
wage is not a radical idea. It has been 
done in State after State. It already 
exists in seven States in our country, 
including California, Oregon, Wash-
ington, Nevada, Montana, Alaska, and 
Minnesota. I should point out that all 
of those States experienced a growth in 
the number of small businesses and res-
taurants 
after 
they 
abolished 
the 
tipped minimum wage. And guess what. 
Waiters and waitresses in these States 
received more tips, not less, and let’s 
be clear: This pandemic has made a bad 
situation worse for waiters and wait-
resses. 
So, right now, it is absolutely imper-
ative that we raise that minimum wage 
to a living wage for all of our workers 
and that we raise the tipped wage as 
well, which is already law in seven 
States of the country right now. 
And I see the Senator from Cali-
fornia, Mr. PADILLA, and we are de-
lighted that he is joining us. And his 
State has been one of the leaders in 
this country in raising the minimum 
wage, and I would yield the floor to 
him for his remarks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of working men 
and women across the country, and I 
am proud to stand with Senator SAND-
ERS, who has been a champion for 
working people. 
Let me be clear: Raising the min-
imum wage is COVID relief. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted 
the immense underlying inequities in 
our Nation. It has also driven home 
how important essential workers are to 
our society and to our economy. 
Millions of Americans do essential 
work but are not paid a living wage. 
They work as home health aides, as-
sisting elderly family members to meet 
their basic needs with dignity. They 
produce our food, stock our grocery 
shelves, keep facilities clean and safe, 
care for our children, and so much 
more, so that we can go to work. 
They are on the frontlines of this 
pandemic, risking their health, yet 
still struggling to keep themselves and 
their families healthy. They shouldn’t 
also have to struggle to keep a roof 
over their heads and food on their 
table. 
Both of my parents worked jobs that 
are considered essential today. For 40 
years, my father worked as a short- 
order cook. For the same 40 years, my 
mom was a domestic worker. And it is 
people like them all over America who 
work hard, with dignity, yet still 
struggle to make ends meet. That is 
not the American dream—far from it. 
It is finally time that Congress does 
something about it. There is strong bi-
partisan support throughout the coun-
try for raising the minimum wage. I 
am proud to say that my home State of 
California has been a leader in the 
fight for 15, and just this past year, the 
voters of Florida—yes, Florida, the 
State that voted for Donald Trump not 
once but twice—approved a $15 min-
imum wage by a 20-point margin. That 
is because it is Americans, both Demo-
crats and Republicans, who know that 
one of the most straightforward ways 
we can help working people is by rais-
ing the Federal minimum wage to $15 
an hour. 
Now, California is a big State. We are 
a very diverse State, full of diverse 
communities, with local variations in 
cost of living and local business condi-
tions, just like the rest of the country. 
And let me tell you, the sky did not 
fall when California enacted a $15 min-
imum wage. 
Now, I know some of our colleagues 
have argued that raising the Federal 
minimum wage would reduce employ-
ment opportunities for American work-
ers. The facts show otherwise. Forty 
years of studies have found little to no 
significant impact of wage increases on 
employment levels. 
Some of our colleagues have also ar-
gued that eliminating the tipped min-
imum wage nationwide would harm 
earnings for workers. That also has not 
happened. Again, research has found 
that eliminating the tipped minimum 
wage has no significant impact on em-
ployment. 
At the same time, median hourly 
wages for tipped workers are higher in 
equal treatment States like California 
compared to those with a tipped min-
imum wage. 
Madam President, 1.7 million Ameri-
cans make the Federal minimum wage. 
That is a $15,000-a-year income. We 
must be honest with ourselves. No one 
can meet the minimum standards of 
living on a minimum wage of just 
$15,000 a year. 
Now, raising the minimum wage to 
$15 an hour would also help reduce 
some of the gender and racial inequi-
ties in our Nation, as Senator SANDERS 
has referenced, given the overrepre-
sentation of women and minorities in 
jobs that earn the minimum wage. It 
would give them more money to spend 
in their local economy, which in turn 
is good for business. But most impor-
tantly, it will lift hundreds of thou-
sands of families out of poverty. Think 
about that. We have the opportunity to 
lift hundreds of thousands of families 
out of poverty. 
This isn’t just an opportunity, it is a 
moral 
responsibility. 
No 
one 
who 
works a full-time job should live in 
poverty. It is that simple. We must 
stand on the side of hard-working 
Americans. 
I call on my colleagues to continue 
the fight for 15 and pass the Sanders 
amendment to bring justice and pros-
perity for all American workers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, right 
now, the Senate is debating, having 
been started by our colleague Senator 
SANDERS, whether it is OK to pay star-
vation wages in the United States. You

March 5, 2021 
heard that right, starvation wages. Re-
ceiving that starvation wage, single 
moms are skipping meals as they try 
to make rent and buy groceries for 
their family. These moms get paid $7.25 
an hour, often work two jobs, and go to 
bed every night worried that the next 
morning is going to bring financial ca-
lamity. 
Senators, is this OK in a country as 
rich and strong as ours? Here in the 
U.S. Senate, nobody has got to worry 
where their next meal is coming from, 
but that is an everyday struggle for too 
many families across the land. 
Senators, let us think about those 
who are hurting as the vote on the 
Sanders minimum wage amendment 
approaches. It is time for that single 
mom to get a fair wage for a fair day’s 
work, a living wage, not a starvation 
wage. 
There has never been a stronger case 
for a $15 minimum wage than there is 
right now during the pandemic. I think 
about grocery store and pharmacy 
workers, home health aides, food proc-
essing and packing workers, restaurant 
employees interacting with maskless 
customers. So many workers in Oregon 
and across the country are going to 
work in a dangerous environment each 
day. Many of them are Black and 
Latino workers, people from the com-
munities that have suffered the most 
from COVID–19. They have kept our 
country going through the last year. 
I have heard a whole lot of Members 
of the Senate, Democratic and Repub-
licans, talk about those workers as he-
roes of the pandemic. So the question 
is, Will the Senate stand up and give 
those heroes of the pandemic the raise 
they deserve, the raise they have wait-
ed for, for 12 years? 
There are 30 million Americans who 
earn less than $15 an hour. It would be 
closer to 40 million if not for the fact 
that the coronavirus put so many 
Americans out of work. That is just 
immoral and unacceptable. 
Now, if you want to see inequality 
baked into the law, just look at how 
the country treats its lowest income 
workers compared to those at the top. 
The minimum wage has been stuck for 
12 long years, and a flat minimum is 
nothing but a slow-moving pay cut for 
those who make the least. 
Minimum wage workers cannot af-
ford the average rent in any State in 
America, not one. It doesn’t account 
for utilities, food, gas, car payments, 
medical bills, school supplies. Here is a 
fact: Living is expensive for the poor in 
America. Meanwhile, the most well-to- 
do keep winning with their invest-
ments in the stock market. The entire 
Tax Code is rigged to favor the income 
of billionaires over the income of wage- 
earning families. 
Republicans passed the $2 trillion 
Trump tax law promising trickle-down 
benefits. They have been talking about 
that for decades, even though those 
magical benefits never actually trickle 
down. 
The Trump administration actually 
made it A-OK in the eyes of the law for 
corporations to steal from their em-
ployees’ tipped wages. A country that 
aspires to be pro-work should not be 
this anti-worker. 
Members of the Senate might forget 
it now, but minimum wage used to go 
up all the time. It happened 22 times 
since the minimum wage was enacted 
in 1938. Through the fifties, sixties, and 
into the seventies—the post-war period 
that many looked as the boom years of 
the 20th century—the minimum wage 
went up all the time, and Congress ex-
panded the range of workers it covered. 
Now, colleagues, these increases did 
not lead to the end of Western civiliza-
tion back then, and raising the min-
imum wage isn’t going to do it today 
either. That is because—folks might 
want to sit down when I say this—it is 
good for everybody when there are 
fewer poor people in America. This is 
the longest the Congress has gone 
without raising the minimum wage 
since its origin. 
In recent years, the grassroots move-
ment has picked up the slack and made 
a lot of progress in cities and States all 
over the country, including my home 
State of Oregon. But the Congress can-
not wait any longer. The powerful 
could pull the levers around here in a 
hurry, and they get more than their 
share of benefits and attention. Right 
now, the Congress has a chance to 
prove, to actually prove that it is look-
ing after working people, and that 
means raising the minimum wage to 
$15 an hour. Every single Senator says 
they want to incentivize hard work, 
and, folks, a living wage does just that. 
The single mom skipping meals to feed 
her kids deserves better. The Senate 
can do better starting today. 
I appreciate my colleague Senator 
SANDERS leading the effort to raise the 
wage for years and years. As chairman 
of the Senate Finance Committee, I am 
all in with Senator SANDERS on this 
fight. Senators, support our amend-
ment. Give tens of millions of Amer-
ica’s hard-working people a raise. And 
before I yield the floor, I just briefly 
want to provide an update with respect 
to the issue of trying to make sure 
that folks who have been laid off, laid 
off from their jobs through no fault of 
their own, are going to be able to get 
an unemployment benefit where they 
can make rent and pay groceries. 
We are having conversations now, 
bringing people together, I believe, 
around two core principles. One is 
avoiding a cliff in August where you 
would have something like 11 million 
people lose their benefits. We have to 
do that. It defies common sense to have 
a cliff in the middle of August when 
you have the Senate out of session. 
Second, we are making a lot of 
progress on preventing an unemploy-
ment tax surprise. This is a matter 
that Senator SANDERS and I have spo-
ken about at length for weeks. A num-
ber of colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle have a great interest in this. I 
think we have made a lot of headway. 
We will have more to discuss with the 
Senate, but I am really hopeful that 
this can bring all sides of this debate 
together. 
I have personally felt the benefit 
should be $400. It should certainly run 
into September, but I know some of my 
colleagues feel otherwise. So what we 
are looking at is making sure that we 
can get a benefit so that people can 
make rent and pay groceries, that we 
prevent that cliff, and, by God, we sure 
as hell shouldn’t let folks who are un-
employed pay taxes on those unem-
ployment benefits that they secured in 
2020. 
Senator SANDERS and I will continue 
to prosecute this question of tax for-
giveness very strongly as well. I appre-
ciate his leadership. 
I see Senator MURRAY, the chair of 
another important committee with ju-
risdiction over this matter. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Wash-
ington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 
to really thank Senator SCHUMER, Sen-
ator WYDEN, and Senator SANDERS and 
others who are working so hard with 
me on making sure that our relief bill 
includes a much needed raise for our 
workers. 
Democrats and Republicans alike 
have joined together in rightly calling 
our essential workers heroes and the 
backbone of our economy. But despite 
their tireless work and the constant 
risk of COVID exposure, too many of 
these workers are paid wages so low, 
they cannot afford to pay for even 
their most basic needs. 
This pandemic should be a wake-up 
call that these workers whom we all 
call heroes deserve more than $7.25 an 
hour. I urge my colleagues to vote for 
the Sanders amendment in order to 
give a much needed raise to millions of 
workers and end the tipped minimum 
wage and subminimum wage for youth 
workers and workers with disabilities. 
After more than a decade since the 
last Federal minimum wage increase, 
the tides are turning, and there is over-
whelming support for Congress to act. 
So let me be clear. Today’s vote is just 
one step in our fight. We are not going 
to give up. Today we are going to keep 
working to get this historic bill across 
the finish line because right now this 
country is on fire. Republicans’ biggest 
concern seems to be that we might use 
too much water. The reality is, we are 
far from doing too much because we 
will not have done enough until this 
crisis is over, until families across the 
Nation are safe, and until we rebuild a 
stronger and fairer country. 
Anyone who says this bill is too ex-
pensive needs to understand how much 
this pandemic has already cost our 
communities, how much it has already 
taken from families, and how much 
more is at stake if we don’t finally 
bring it to an end. 
They need to listen to public health 
and healthcare workers who have been 
straining to test, to contact trace, to

March 5, 2021 
vaccinate people across the country, 
and to grapple with the trauma of 
fighting 
this 
pandemic 
on 
the 
frontlines. 
They need to listen to parents who 
are asking how they are supposed to go 
to work when they don’t have childcare 
and their kids can’t go to school in per-
son, who wonder how are they going to 
pay rent, how are they going to pay for 
groceries, how are they going to pay to 
keep the heat on, and fearing what will 
happen if they cannot. 
They need to listen to students whom 
this pandemic has robbed of critical 
school resources, as well as opportuni-
ties to grow and thrive and socialize 
with their peers. 
They need to listen to our States and 
our cities and our Tribes and our terri-
tories that have seen their budgets up-
ended. 
They absolutely need to listen to 
people of color, to voices in the Black, 
Latino, and Tribal communities who 
have been hit the hardest by this pan-
demic in every way. 
Anyone who has been listening to the 
American people and anyone who has 
been watching what they have gone 
through understands the danger in this 
moment is not doing too much; it is 
doing too little. 
If Republicans want to talk about too 
much, there are almost 10 million 
fewer people working compared to this 
time a year ago. There are 11 million 
people at risk of eviction and 11 mil-
lion people about to lose their unem-
ployment benefits. That is too much. 
One study says that by June, this 
pandemic will likely have set students 
back 5 to 9 months in math from where 
they could be in a typical year, and 
that setback is even larger for students 
of color. Another notes that as schools 
across the country have shifted to re-
mote learning, that one in four stu-
dents lacks access to internet at home. 
According to the CDC, one in four 
young adults has considered suicide. 
That is too much. 
Since the start of the pandemic, we 
have lost over 650,000 jobs in higher 
education and 1 in 6 jobs in childcare. 
That is too much. 
Across this country, this virus has 
infected over 28 million, left thousands 
of ‘‘long haulers’’ still experiencing 
symptoms, and killed over half a mil-
lion people. That is too much. 
We have to act. We have to. And that 
is why we are fighting to pass the 
American Rescue Plan. This American 
Rescue Plan will send families long- 
overdue direct relief and prevent ex-
panded unemployment benefits, which 
have been a lifeline to so many people, 
from expiring. It will help get vaccines 
in arms faster. It will hire and train 
more public health workers. It will 
ramp up our testing capacity and in-
vest in programs to counter the dis-
proportionate 
harm 
COVID–19 
has 
caused specifically to communities of 
color and Tribes. It will expand afford-
able insurance to more families and 
give schools much needed resources to 
help our students get back to class-
rooms for in-person learning safely. It 
will stabilize our struggling childcare 
sector, which is so critical to helping 
women and working families get back 
to work. It will support small busi-
nesses and help States keep educators 
and firefighters and sanitation workers 
and others on the job. 
So before my Republican colleagues 
worry anymore about the cost of doing 
all that, I hope they take a moment to 
consider the staggering cost of failing 
to do it. There is a reason bold action 
like this plan has the support of Repub-
lican Governors like Jim Justice in 
West Virginia; the support of Repub-
lican mayors like Betsy Price in Fort 
Worth, TX, or Francis Suarez in 
Miami, FL, or David Holt from Okla-
homa City; and, according to a recent 
poll, the support of a majority of Re-
publicans. 
That same poll showed that the 
American people support this package 
by an overwhelming 3-to-1 margin. 
People support this American Rescue 
Plan because the American Rescue 
Plan supports people—workers, fami-
lies, communities—who know firsthand 
the loss and hardship of this last year 
and because they understand the sim-
ple fact that when the house is in 
flames, you do not argue about how 
much of the fire to put out or how 
much water to use or how many lives 
to save; you do whatever it takes until 
the crisis is over and everyone is safe, 
and you do it as fast as you can. That 
is what Democrats are trying to do 
today. That is what this bill is about, 
and I urge every single Member of the 
Senate to support it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
American Rescue Plan, but following 
my colleague from Washington and in 
the presence of the Senator from 
Vermont, I just want to thank them for 
how hard they have fought for an in-
crease in the minimum wage. 
Our State, the State of Washington, 
has led the Nation for many years in 
the highest minimum wage, and it 
didn’t impact our economy. In fact, it 
helped our economy. There are now re-
ports, as we have moved towards $15 
from just a little town, SeaTac, to the 
city of Seattle, to now a plan for our 
entire State to move to $15 over a grad-
ual period of time. 
I urge my colleagues—I urge my col-
leagues to come together with a plan 
that can get us to a $15 minimum wage. 
I know we have it in us. I know we can 
do it. I so appreciate our colleagues 
waging this effort to continue to make 
this a priority for our Nation. 
I can’t tell you enough how much the 
wages, particularly in a place like Se-
attle, are going to matter to people, to 
have a livable wage. I know people here 
have discussed various aspects of this 
program and the plans that are in this 
bill, but I just want them to know that 
the cost of living in a very expensive 
place like Seattle demands that we pay 
workers what they deserve. It also 
means that we deal with big-city prob-
lems like homelessness and deal with 
making investments, and I hope that 
our next infrastructure bill will get to 
that. 
This is not the last time I am going 
to speak about minimum wage, but I 
want our colleagues to know that this 
battle is not over yet and that if we 
want to raise the standard of living in 
the United States, we have to pay a liv-
able wage. 
So I come to talk about the details of 
the rescue plan. This is 1 year since a 
young man from Everett, WA, became 
the first COVID victim in the United 
States of America. Not only did he get 
sick, but many loved ones got sick, 
their families, and they are all waiting 
now for vaccines. So this legislation— 
priority No. 1 for so many Americans 
right now is the COVID–19 vaccine. 
In my State, the State of Wash-
ington, more than 1 million residents 
have been vaccinated, and 6 million 
more are still waiting. Everyone knows 
that demand far exceeds the supply. 
Our healthcare workers are working 
tirelessly, along with other govern-
ment officials, to get shots in the arms 
of individuals. 
That is why this bill is so important, 
because it provides $20 billion to invest 
in vaccine administration and distribu-
tion. That includes launching commu-
nity vaccine centers, deploying mobile 
vaccine units to hard-to-reach areas, 
and continuing to support an increased 
pace of vaccinations. That is job 1 right 
now—get the vaccine into the arms of 
Americans. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant, to continue that effort, but it 
also provides other support, like ex-
tending unemployment benefits for 
millions of Americans who lost their 
jobs through no fault of their own a 
year ago and are now seeing unemploy-
ment benefits expire next week. 
We know what today’s numbers say. 
We still have a very high unemploy-
ment rate in the United States of 
America. So this bill extends the ben-
efit another 5 months, until August 29. 
It is a very prudent measure to con-
tinue to put the resources into the 
American economy. 
It also provides $1,400 stimulus pay-
ments to millions, and it supports new 
efforts for our restaurants, small busi-
nesses, and those devastated by the 
pandemic so they can use this money 
for payroll, rent, utilities, and paid 
sick leave. This is so important, to 
continue to learn from the programs 
that COVID has started and to refine 
them to make them successful for our 
economy. 
This also helps children who are at 
home, helping provide more money for 
E-Rate and broadband connectivity for 
schools and libraries. This is so impor-
tant to individuals. 
It also provides critical dollars for 
Federal health funding to treat Native

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1225 
March 5, 2021 
Americans in urban areas, a commu-
nity that has been very hard hit by the 
pandemic. 
Our economy lost 9.8 million jobs in 
2020, and our current unemployment 
rate, as I just said—we know from this 
data that came out this morning—is 
still too high. We know that, as a re-
sult, 19 million Americans, including 
460,000 Washingtonians, rely on those 
unemployment benefits. If we don’t act 
by March 14, 11.5 million people will 
lose their extended unemployment ben-
efits. So that is why this program is so 
important to get passed today in the 
Senate. 
The restaurants, as we know, have 
been very plagued by this problem, and 
the PPP program has been helpful, but 
I believe this legislation will be even 
more helpful. Since the beginning of 
the 
pandemic, 
110,000 
restaurants 
across our country have closed either 
permanently or for an extended period 
of time, including 2,300 in the State of 
Washington, and some are just strug-
gling to hang on. 
For example, the Black Cypress res-
taurant in Pullman, WA, lost more 
than 1 million in revenue and had to 
lay off workers after the initial PPP 
loan program ran out. In southwest 
Washington, 
restaurants 
like 
the 
Mighty Bowl in Vancouver and the 
Depot Restaurant in Seaview are oper-
ating at 50 percent revenue loss. 
I talked to one of our restaurant 
owners, Wassef Haroun, who operates 
very popular restaurants in Seattle, in-
cluding Mamnoon. He said his res-
taurants have lost 70 percent of their 
revenue compared to 2019. And these 
are people who are hustling to do 
standup, popup windows, and all sorts 
of things to keep the restaurants and 
restaurant employees working. 
So the Paycheck Protection Program 
was critical, and these improvements 
were desperately needed. That is why 
this bill includes a new $25 billion 
grant program for restaurants to ad-
dress those concerns of rent and utili-
ties and sick leave and other things 
head-on. 
The bill also helps with more funding 
for the SBA live venues grant program 
that we have authorized, helping those 
venues stay open. For us in Seattle, 
music is a thing, and we want these 
venues to be there. They are part of 
our history. They are part of our cul-
ture. They are part of a music story 
that really is about, well, just a little 
bit different take on music than maybe 
some other parts of the world. So we 
are very proud of it, and we don’t want 
to lose these facilities, the home for 
growing more music and cultural im-
pacts to our society. 
So one of the hardest hit businesses, 
though, has been businesses with 10 or 
fewer employees in underserved areas, 
like Grays Harbor, Yakima, Ferry 
County, or Pend Oreille. This legisla-
tion allows $10,000 grants from the SBA 
program of Economic Injury and Dis-
aster Loan Program to help with the 
smaller communities and the small 
businesses that have been underserved 
to date by the programs that we have 
passed. 
But for the first time, in this legisla-
tion, there will be support for the avia-
tion supply chain. We are hearing all 
sorts of discussions about supply chain 
shortages and the competitiveness of 
the United States if the United States 
sees that critical supply chain ele-
ments will not be able to be filled, 
whether you are talking about the 
automotive industry or whether you 
are talking about aviation. 
Well, in the previous bills, certainly, 
I can say that the Fed made capital 
available that, certainly, manufactur-
ers—large-scale 
manufacturers—took 
advantage of. Previous bills made 
money available for the airlines to con-
tinue operating, as this legislation does 
as well. And I would say, I think, we 
are probably somewhere between 40 to 
45 percent of the original capacity for 
airlines that we were previous to the 
pandemic, which means we are making 
progress, and that is what we always 
wanted to see—the ability to return 
our economy quickly. 
But in Washington State alone, we 
have 30,000 aerospace manufacturing 
and supply chain jobs that have been 
lost. Our aerospace supply chain is part 
of a juggernaut for our economy. It 
helps us with our gross domestic prod-
uct, and it helps us in containing and 
keeping a workforce that is skilled 
that can work postpandemic. So in this 
legislation, we will be, for the first 
time, making resources available for 
that supply chain. 
I want to thank Senator MORAN and 
Senator WARNER and a slew of other 
Members who worked on providing re-
sources to this supply chain. It will 
help us retain and rehire workers in 
the aviation manufacturing sector. It 
will help us keep highly skilled work-
ers who serve as the backbone of indus-
tries so that our Nation can continue 
to be poised for the recovery. And it 
helps us in making sure that we are 
poised for a strong recovery. We know 
that aviation manufacturing jobs mean 
a lot to our Nation. Finally, we are 
going to help stave off the tide of the 
huge losses that we have seen in that 
sector. 
We are going to help the mom-and- 
pop machine shops. We are going to 
take those who have been working on 
small aircraft parts and landing gears 
and doors and flight controls and help 
them with the impact that they have 
felt in trying to keep a workforce dur-
ing this period of time. 
These are all important priorities for 
us as a nation: the vaccines, the unem-
ployment 
benefits, 
the 
stimulus 
checks, the E-rate program for helping 
students learn at home, the investment 
in the aerospace supply chain. It is im-
portant that we get the dollars out the 
door. This will help us recover. This 
will 
help 
American 
families 
wade 
through the last months of this COVID 
pandemic fight. But, believe me, they 
need the help in the last months. This 
fight is not over, and this will help sus-
tain us. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this leg-
islation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, similar 
to Senator CANTWELL, I want to talk a 
little bit about the small business pro-
visions in the American Rescue Plan 
and the urgency of passing the recov-
ery act as soon as possible. We need to 
act in order to deal with the recovery 
of COVID–19 for our Nation. 
As chair of the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship 
Committee, 
it 
is 
critically important to the health of 
small businesses that we act on the 
American Rescue Plan. Small busi-
nesses are critically important to our 
economy. I think the Members of this 
body understand that. 
Two out of every three jobs in the 
private sector are created through 
small 
companies. 
Innovation 
takes 
place in a much larger amount in small 
companies. Just look at how small 
companies have adjusted to COVID–19. 
We have seen curbside pickup. We have 
seen the use of the online deliveries. 
We have seen ways in which small busi-
nesses have shown that they can figure 
out ways to try to stay alive under any 
circumstances. 
But there is another factor about 
small businesses, and that is that they 
are not as resilient to deal with an eco-
nomic downturn as the larger compa-
nies are. So whenever we go through 
any type of a recession, small busi-
nesses suffer the most. So for all of 
those reasons, it was critically impor-
tant for us to act to help America’s 
small businesses. 
Democrats and Republicans worked 
together to create a way in which we 
could help small businesses during this 
pandemic. It is interesting that the 
very first bill that we passed removed 
the restrictions in regard to the EIDL 
Program so that those businesses that 
suffered as a result of the pandemic 
could qualify for the Economic Injury 
and Disaster Loan Program under the 
Small Business Administration. We did 
that because we realized that govern-
ment was imposing restrictions on 
small businesses in their operations, 
and we had a responsibility to act. 
And then in mid-March of last year— 
not this year, but mid-March of last 
year—we passed the CARES Act, al-
most a year ago. It recognized that this 
pandemic was having a major impact 
on our small businesses. We didn’t real-
ize how long the pandemic would last. 
We thought it would last a few months. 
We certainly did not think it would 
last a full year, and now beyond a year. 
We passed innovative programs in 
order to save small businesses. 
In the one that got perhaps the most 
attention, the PPP program—the Pay-
check Protection Program—we ini-
tially provided $350 billion. I would like 
to think of the CARES Act as, really, a 
Marshall Plan. It was a Marshall Plan 
to deal with COVID–19. It provided the

March 5, 2021 
monies for vaccination, research, test-
ing, and for public health, to help our 
States and local governments, to help 
schools, but it also provided money in 
a major way to help small businesses. 
So $350 billion was initially provided 
through the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram because we realized that rather 
than having to put more money into 
unemployment insurance, wouldn’t it 
be better to keep people on payroll so 
that small businesses can retain their 
essential workforce? And it worked. 
The program was very, very popular. 
But we did more than just the Pay-
check Protection Program. We also ex-
panded the Economic Injury and Dis-
aster Loan Program, or the EIDL Pro-
gram, because we recognized that for-
givable loans of a limited amount of 
money was not enough to carry busi-
nesses over during the pandemic. They 
were going to need longer term loans. 
EIDL is a 30-year low-interest loan, up 
to 30 years. And we also created a new 
program known as the EIDL Advance 
Program, which was cash—it was not a 
loan, not a forgivable loan; it was a 
grant of up to $10,000—because we know 
for many small businesses, particularly 
the most stressed and the most chal-
lenged, taking on another loan was not 
a possibility. So we provided an EIDL 
Advance of up to $10,000. 
We also provided for loan forgiveness 
for those who had existing or had re-
cently taken out 7(a) or 504 loans under 
the Small Business Administration. 
These programs were exceedingly 
popular—so popular that, within just 
about a matter of weeks, we started 
running out of resources. We had ap-
propriated, we thought, a significant 
amount of funds, but we found that $350 
billion went pretty quickly. So we 
came together, and we replenished the 
funds. We put more money into the 
Paycheck Protection Program, and we 
also recognized that we had to provide 
more 
flexibility 
because 
businesses 
were suffering, and they needed more 
ability to be able to use those funds. So 
we granted additional flexibility. 
When we passed the CARES Act, we 
thought this pandemic would be over 
with by last summer. Well, that was 
not the case. So we came back together 
again and recognized we had to do 
more. We passed, as you know, this 
past December in the Omnibus legisla-
tion another round of help for Amer-
ica’s small businesses. This time, it 
was $325 billion of additional help. 
We provided additional eligibility for 
entities that had not qualified before 
for the Paycheck Protection Program, 
and we provided a second round of the 
Paycheck Protection Program. But we 
targeted that second round to those 
small businesses that were in under-
served communities, minority commu-
nities, and the smaller of the small 
businesses. We helped mission lenders, 
such as CDFIs and minority depository 
institutions so that we could really try 
to reach the underserved communities. 
And we established a program for 
shuttered venues. Why? Because shut-
tered venues were shuttered. These 
were institutions that could not oper-
ate because of a government order, and 
we recognized we had to do something 
special in order to deal with that. 
So when you put that all together, 
what happened? Well, we saved a lot of 
small businesses, and we should be 
proud of that record. Seven million 
Paycheck Protection Program loans— 
forgivable loans—were granted for $678 
billion. There were 3.7 million EIDL 
loans given for $200 billion. And we 
were oversubscribed for the EIDL Ad-
vance of $20 billion. So we were able to 
really help, but more is needed. 
When we passed the Omnibus bill in 
December, we recognized that that 
would hold us until March. Well, it is 
now March. We need to act to complete 
the work. 
The Trump administration, in admin-
istering the SBA programs, did things 
that we thought were unacceptable. 
They put a cap on the EIDL loan of 
$150,000. The statute says $2 million. 
Many businesses needed more help 
than was given by the administration 
of the EIDL loan program. The EIDL 
Advance Program was supposed to be 
up to $10,000, but the administration 
administered it at $1,000 per employee, 
making it far less desirable than Con-
gress intended. 
And, quite frankly, the underserved 
communities were not being met at the 
level that we had expected. I say that 
because Senator SHAHEEN and I put a 
provision in the CARES Act, now 
known as page 30, that required the 
SBA to make special efforts to get to 
the underbanked communities because 
we realized the underbanked commu-
nities were going to have difficulty 
getting loans that were forgivable. 
Their own inspector general of the SBA 
said that the SBA did not carry out the 
intent of Congress. So we needed to do 
more to reach those communities that 
were being left behind. 
That is why action is needed. I want 
to compliment the Biden administra-
tion. They have taken administrative 
action to try to help us on this. They 
have opened up for 14 days exclusivity 
under the PPP program for those busi-
nesses that are 20 employees or less. 
The smaller of the small businesses are 
those that are having the most dif-
ficulty surviving in this climate. And 
they had a much more real—by Execu-
tive order or by administrative action, 
they now have a much more realistic 
formula for the self-employed as to 
how much they can receive under a 
PPP loan. They were able to do that 
through Executive action, and they re-
moved 
the 
discriminatory 
nature 
against returning citizens being able to 
qualify for these forgivable loans. 
The Biden administration has taken 
action. Now it is necessary for us to 
take action and come in with the 
American Rescue Plan. We need to pass 
it, $50 billion of additional help di-
rectly—directly—to small businesses to 
make the EIDL Advance really work 
for those in low-income communities 
so they can get their full $10,000 grant 
that we intended them to receive. So 
that we can make that work, we need 
to provide another $15 billion to the 
EIDL Advance Program, targeting it to 
the underserved communities. 
We have a program to help our res-
taurants—why help the restaurants?— 
with $25 billion. Here is the fact. Even 
with the restaurants starting to come 
back, we are 2 million jobs less in the 
restaurant field since the beginning of 
COVID–19—2 million jobs less. The Na-
tional Restaurant Association esti-
mates that 110,000 restaurants have ei-
ther shuttered for good or are shut-
tered today as a result of COVID–19. We 
need to direct help to the restaurant 
community. 
The shuttered venue program needs 
additional support, so an extra $1.25 
billion 
is 
provided 
for 
shuttered 
venues. I will just give you one exam-
ple. The Merriweather Post Pavilion 
located in Howard County, MD—I have 
been there many times—has not oper-
ated since last March. They need help. 
A thousand jobs are dependent upon 
the Merriweather Post Pavilion. 
I am sure every one of my colleagues 
could mention the venues in their own 
State that have been shuttered as a re-
sult of COVID–19 that need that help. 
We provide $7.25 billion for non-
profits, expanding eligibility, and for 
the digital news platforms that need 
help. Johns Hopkins University has 
done a study, and it has shown that the 
employment level in our nonprofit 
community has dropped 1 million jobs 
since COVID–19 occurred. We know the 
great work that they do, how they step 
up and help us anytime, but particu-
larly during a pandemic and during a 
national crisis. They need help, and 
they should be eligible to be able to re-
ceive the help under the Small Busi-
ness PPP program. This bill will pro-
vide that flexibility so they can get the 
help that they need—another reason we 
have to pass the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Then, lastly, let me mention the 
community navigators. There is a mod-
est amount of money here so we can 
have people who can help those who are 
not as sophisticated to be able to get 
the help that they need through a com-
munity navigator. Yes, we have the 
Women’s Business Centers. Yes, we 
have the Small Business Development 
Centers. But we need more help. I 
think the record has shown that. 
Then, lastly, let me say, yes, we need 
to pass the American Rescue Plan for 
the direct help to small businesses, but 
they also need our economy to return 
to some degree of normalcy. That is 
why there is help for opening our 
schools, help for State and local gov-
ernments, help for families with direct 
payments and unemployment insur-
ance, SNAP benefits, COBRA protec-
tion; why the vaccine distribution is so 
important, the Medicaid expansion, 
housing assistance. And I could go on 
and on and on. 
America needs the American Rescue 
Plan, and they need it now. Democrats

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1227 
March 5, 2021 
worked with the Trump administration 
so that we could get help during that 
administration. Republicans need to 
join us in helping the American people. 
Let’s pass the American Rescue Plan, 
and let’s do that as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I rise today to go over 
with our colleagues the importance of 
the American Rescue Plan as it relates 
to small businesses. 
As every member of this Chamber 
knows, small businesses are the growth 
engine 
of 
the 
American 
economy. 
Small businesses are where jobs are 
created—creating two of every three 
new jobs and employing almost half of 
the Nation’s private sector workforce 
during the years leading up to the pan-
demic. 
Just as important as the jobs they 
create, small businesses are where in-
novation happens in our economy. 
They are the entities that are figuring 
out better, more efficient ways of doing 
things. 
Mr. President, we are 1 week away 
from the 1-year anniversary of the his-
toric day on March 11 of last year when 
the World Health Organization de-
clared COVID–19 a global pandemic. 
In the year since, we have seen small 
businesses nationwide struggle, but we 
have also seen their creativity and in-
genuity on display. We have seen the 
restaurants 
that 
have 
moved 
to 
curbside pick-up and online deliveries 
because it is unsafe to have in-person 
dining. 
These small businesses are the reason 
why our economy is performing at the 
level it is, which may not be the level 
we want it to be, but the ingenuity of 
these small businesses have put us in a 
much better position. 
But Mr. President, there is another 
characteristic of small businesses that 
I think we all understand. 
We all understand that they don’t 
have the same degree of resiliency as 
larger businesses, because they operate 
on razor-thin margins, they don’t have 
deep pockets, and as a result, they 
often struggle to find outside financ-
ing. So when our economy hits a bump 
in the road, small businesses suffer the 
most. 
So Mr. President, when the impact 
COVID–19 would have on our economy 
became clear last year, it was particu-
larly important for us to respond to 
help our small businesses so that when 
we get out of this pandemic, when our 
economy returns, our small businesses 
emerge in a position to help our econ-
omy recover, and continue to grow. 
We had to support our small busi-
nesses, because the public health re-
strictions on public gatherings—which 
have saved thousands of lives and kept 
our communities safe—have been espe-
cially challenging for small businesses. 
So Congress had to respond, and we 
did. Our first major response was the 
CARES Act—a bold, bipartisan bill 
that was created to help small busi-
nesses, families, and create a ‘‘Mar-
shall Plan’’ for healthcare, which put 
money into vaccine development, pro-
ducing personal protective equipment, 
and put money into testing and other 
public health measures. 
Because we recognized then, and now, 
that we have a responsibility as the 
federal government to control the pan-
demic. 
So the very first bill we passed in re-
sponse to the pandemic made small 
businesses affected by the pandemic el-
igible for the Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan program. 
Traditionally used to help small busi-
nesses recover from a natural disaster 
like a hurricane or a tornado, EIDL 
provides low interest, long-term—up to 
30 years—loans to help businesses re-
cover. 
IT was important that we include 
EIDL as a tool in the Small Business 
Administration’s toolkit, because we 
knew small businesses would need the 
flexible, patient capital provided by 
EIDL. 
Next we passed the CARES Act, 
which provided more than $370 billion 
in direct aid to small businesses bear-
ing the costs of keeping us safe. 
It created the Paycheck Protection 
Program, a bipartisan program de-
signed to keep employees on payroll. 
And we appropriated $350 billion to the 
program. 
We did this because we recognized at 
the time that while a business could 
lay off workers who could then collect 
unemployment, it would be better to 
keep them on payroll. 
PPP provided an immediate influx of 
aid to small businesses through forgiv-
able loans equivalent to 2 months of 
payroll costs that could be used pri-
marily for payroll, but for other busi-
ness expenses as well. For small busi-
nesses that used the appropriate por-
tion of their PPP loan for payroll, the 
loan would be forgiven. 
To complement EIDL and PPP, we 
created the EIDL Advance grant pro-
gram for those small businesses that 
were unable to take out a loan because 
they were struggling to pay their exist-
ing loans. 
The EIDL Advance program would 
provide grants up to $10,000 for our 
most vulnerable small businesses. For 
many businesses, the grants were a 
lifesaver that provided an immediate 
cash infusion without having to worry 
about additional loans of their books. 
We also created the SBA Debt Relief 
program to cover the monthly pay-
ments on new and existing traditional 
SBA loans, including SBA 7(a) and 504 
loans. 
Mr. President, the CARES Act was 
signed on March 27, and according to 
SBA, more than $340 billion in PPP 
loans were approved by April 16— 
roughly 3 weeks after the bill was 
signed. 
So we had to appropriate additional 
funds for the program due to the de-
mand for the loans. We also made PPP 
more flexible for small businesses in 
recognition of the fact that our Nation 
would be confronting the pandemic for 
months to come and that we would not 
have the pandemic behind us by sum-
mer, as we had hoped. 
PPP, EIDL, EIDL Advance grants, 
and the SBA Debt Relief program 
helped save many small businesses. 
We only need to look at the numbers. 
Since the creation of PPP last 
March, SBA has approved more than 7 
million PPP loans worth more than 
$678 billion. Most of those funds went 
directly to the millions of employees 
at those small businesses to care for 
themselves and their families. SBA has 
approved more than 3.7 million EIDL 
applications 
providing 
loans 
worth 
more than $200 billion. 
The EIDL Advance grant program 
has exhausted its initial $20 billion ap-
propriation. 
In the months since these programs 
have been up-and-running, Mr. Presi-
dent, we have learned many lessons 
that we must now deploy in order to 
finish the job of ensuring that small 
businesses are protected through this 
pandemic. 
We learned that the historic barriers 
that small businesses in underserved 
communities, especially Black- and 
Latino-owned small businesses, do not 
have relationships with the traditional 
banking institutions that make PPP 
loans. 
Senator SHAHEEN
and I were con-
cerned about this as we wrote the 
CARES Act, which is why we put a pro-
vision in the bill that required SBA to 
issue guidance to banks participating 
in PPP to prioritize loan applications 
from underserved small businesses. 
Unfortunately, SBA did not do that, 
which led the SBA IG to issue report 
that found that SBA’s implementation 
of PPP ‘‘did not fully align’’ with the 
Congressional intent of the CARES 
Act. 
In response to SBA’s failure to issue 
that guidance, a group of stakeholders 
advocating on behalf of minority busi-
nesses started a group known as the 
Page 30 Coalition, because the provi-
sion I talked about was on page 30 of 
the CARES Act. 
PPP wasn’t the only program harmed 
by the way it was implemented by the 
Trump administration. 
The Trump administration hindered 
the utility of EIDL by capping loans at 
$150,000, which is far below the $2 mil-
lion cap that is in statute. 
And EIDL Advance grants were made 
less useful to small businesses due to 
the Trump administration’s decision to 
provide EIDL applicants with $1,000 per 
employee for up to 10 employees, in-
stead of the $10,000 grant provided by 
the CARES Act. 
So I was pleased that we finally lived 
up to our overdue responsibility to pass 
more economic aid in December. The 
bipartisan $900 billion relief bill pro-
vided an additional $325 billion in aid 
to small businesses and included provi-
sions to make PPP a more useful pro-
gram for more of our most vulnerable 
small businesses. 
The bill provided $284 billion for first 
and second PPP loans, and it set aside

$15 billion for mission lenders, as well 
as another $15 billion set-aside for cer-
tain 
smaller 
financial 
institutions, 
such as credit unions and farm credit 
institutions. 
The bill also made SBA’s 7(a) and 504 
loan programs more affordable for bor-
rowers and less risky for lenders; those 
programs helped jumpstart the econ-
omy following the Great Recession. 
The bill provided $20 billion for tar-
geted EIDL Advance grants that will 
be provided to small businesses in eli-
gible low-income communities. For 
small businesses in these communities 
that already received an EIDL Advance 
grant, SBA will provide them with the 
difference for a full $10,000 grant. 
And we extended the Small Business 
Debt Relief Program for several more 
months, which freed up cash flow for 
small businesses to use for working 
capital. 
Mr. President, I am proud to share 
that the changes to PPP are already 
yielding results. 
Data from SBA on this current round 
of PPP shows lower loan averages, 
which indicates that more of the small-
er, more vulnerable small businesses 
are receiving loans this time than they 
did during the initial months of PPP. 
I was very proud last week after the 
Biden Administration announced steps 
it was taking to make PPP a more eq-
uitable program and provide relief to 
the many of Black- and Latino-owned 
small businesses that were left out of, 
or underfunded, during previous rounds 
of relief. 
The changes include a 14–day dedi-
cated window for small businesses with 
fewer than 20 employees to apply for 
PPP; an improved loan calculation for-
mula for sole proprietors, independent 
contractors, and self-employed individ-
uals; and the elimination of an unnec-
essary restriction that prevented small 
business owners with a prior non-fraud 
felony conviction from obtaining a 
PPP loan. 
These changes will help many small 
businesses secure the aid they need. 
Now is the time to seize on that mo-
mentum. 
The American Rescue Plan will de-
ploy an additional $50 billion to the 
communities and industries that still 
need help, and are likely to need con-
tinuing support in the months to come. 
Mr. President, this bill is necessary 
right now, because the industries that 
have been hardest hit by the pandemic 
are also the industries that will take 
the longest to resume full operations 
after the pandemic—some of which are 
reliant on large crowds to turn a profit; 
others because they are already strug-
gled to access capital before the pan-
demic, and will only be worse off after 
it. 
It is vital that we provide additional 
funding to these industries, because 
they have accounted for a large portion 
of the jobs lost during the pandemic. 
According 
to 
the 
National 
Res-
taurant Association, as of December of 
last year, 110,000 eating and drinking 
places were closed for business tempo-
rarily, or for good, and the sector fin-
ished 2020 nearly 2.5 million jobs below 
its pre-COVID level. And at the peak of 
initial closures last year, the group es-
timates that up to 8 million restaurant 
employees were laid off or furloughed. 
The live events industry also needs 
additional support, because they are 
the most reliant on large crowds to 
turn a profit, and businesses in the sec-
tor often support hundreds of jobs, both 
directly and through their relation-
ships with other businesses. 
In my home state of Maryland, for 
example, Merriweather Post Pavilion 
in Howard County supports nearly 1,000 
jobs across the State. 
We must also expand support to more 
nonprofits, 
because 
the 
job 
losses 
caused by the pandemic have not been 
limited to the for-profit entities. Ac-
cording to a report from the Johns 
Hopkins University, there are nearly 1 
million fewer nonprofit jobs today than 
there were in February of last year, in-
cluding the 50,000 jobs lost by the non-
profit sector in December. The report 
projects that it will take 18 months to 
regain the nonprofit jobs lost during 
the pandemic. 
It goes without saying that getting 
these jobs back as quickly as possible 
will be key to a swift, robust recovery. 
And enacting the American Rescue 
Plan will help us do just that. 
What these small businesses need 
more of however, are not loans, but 
grants. 
That is why the American Rescue 
Plan includes $15 billion for targeted 
EIDL grants to provide hard-hit, un-
derserved small businesses with in-
creased flexible grant relief, which will 
be particularly helpful for very small 
businesses and sole proprietors. 
This provision is especially impor-
tant for minority-owned businesses, 
which are more likely to be sole propri-
etors and have fewer employees on av-
erage. 
The American Rescue Plan will also 
create a $25 billion dedicated grant re-
lief program for restaurants, and it will 
provide an additional $1.25 billion to 
the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant 
program, which was created by the De-
cember bill. 
The American Rescue Plan will ex-
pand PPP eligibility to additional non-
profits that are providing essential so-
cial services, as well as digital news 
services that are keeping our commu-
nities informed about the pandemic. 
The plan provides SBA with an addi-
tional $1.325 billion in administrative 
funding to implement and scale up 
these grant programs. 
And lastly, the plan provides $175 
million for a community navigator 
pilot program designed to help small 
businesses in underserved and under-
banked 
communities 
access 
the 
COVID–19 resources available to them. 
If we remember from the Affordable 
Care Act, community navigators help 
get information out to hard-to-serve 
communities, and they will help small 
business owners apply for the programs 
that best meet their needs. 
They are a good complement to 
SBA’s existing resource partners, such 
as the Women’s Business Centers and 
Small Business Development Centers. 
Mr. President, President Biden prom-
ised the American people that help is 
on the way, and that is exactly what 
we intend to do by passing the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan into law. 
It is a bold approach, because the 
problems we are facing are so great. We 
must pass this bill immediately. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, a vote- 
arama is upon us. Stay hydrated. Try 
to keep good cheer. We are going to 
have lots of amendments today and 
kind of talk about where we differ on 
certain things, which will be good for 
the country. 
What I hate the most is that we are 
doing a partisan COVID bill for the 
first time as a nation, and I don’t know 
why because on March 5, 2020, 96 to 1, 
we appropriated $8 billion when we had 
just begun to understand what COVID 
was about; March 18, $355 billion, 90 to 
8; March 25, $1.9 trillion. 
So March 5 and 25, we spent well over 
$2 trillion, with the average vote 96 to 
1, 90 to 8, and 96 to 0. In April we spent 
$355 billion by voice vote; September 
30, 2020, $8 billion, 84 to 10; December 
21, 2020, $1.04 trillion, 92 to 6. 
So it is not like we can’t work to-
gether on COVID. You had a Repub-
lican President, you had a Republican 
Senate, and a Democratic House, and 
we were able to come together as a na-
tion. But that is all over now because 
my Democratic colleagues have chosen 
to go another way because they can. 
They have all the power. They have the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House. 
They have chosen to do a $1.9 trillion 
package without any effort at all, in 
my view, to try to find common 
ground. Ninety percent of this money 
has got zero to do with COVID. It is a 
liberal wish list, and every time Sen-
ator SCHUMER says it is not, it makes 
me believe it is. 
So another point for the American 
people: Of all the money I just de-
scribed to you that we appropriated in 
a bipartisan fashion, we haven’t spent 
it all yet, but we are going to spend $1.9 
trillion even though we haven’t spent 
the earlier money. 
Of the administrative actions, we 
have got still $200 billion left to spend. 
Of the legislative appropriations, we 
appropriated $4.1 trillion; we have got a 
trillion we haven’t spent yet, but we 
are going to spend $1.9 trillion more be-
fore we spend what we spent in the 
past. 
The Federal Reserve set aside $5.9 
trillion to help business. They have 
only spent $2.8 trillion, so there is a lot 
more capability there. 
The economy is showing signs of life. 
The vaccine is out. Things are looking

better. It seems to me we would want 
to slow down and wisely spend the 
money not spent before we embark on 
a $1.9 trillion spending spree. 
Most of it doesn’t have much to do, if 
anything, with COVID. They are doing 
it because they can, and there will be a 
lot of amendments talking about bet-
ter ways to spend this money. 
The minimum wage has been dropped 
out, but here is what is in this bill: $20 
million for the preservation and main-
tenance of Native American languages. 
That might be something we want to 
do, but we should go through the ap-
propriations process, have hearings, 
not put it on a COVID bill. 
And $135 million for the National En-
dowment for the Arts. It may be some-
thing we want to do, but not on a 
COVID bill. And $135 million for the 
National Endowment for Humanities. 
Again, the same concept. About $200 
million for the Institute of Museum 
and Library Services. What has that 
got to do with COVID? Nothing. 
PPP loans for labor unions, paid 
leave fund for Federal employees, an 
$86 billion bailout for union pensions. 
What has that got to do with COVID? 
Nothing. And $350 billion for blue 
States. We changed the formula under 
this bill—dramatically different than 
the one we passed 96 to 0. 
So I could go on and on. Money for 
schools. Most of the money in this 
bill—$129 billion for K–12—only $6.4 bil-
lion is to be distributed this year. Most 
of the money is spent from 2022 to 2028. 
Hopefully we will get control of COVID 
by 2028. Again, this is an opportunity 
to spend money on things not related 
to COVID because they have the power 
to do so. 
It is going to be a long day. We are 
going to be talking about reprioritizing 
money. We are going to try to strike 
provisions from this bill, money that 
comes from hard-working taxpayers, 
being spent in a way unrelated to 
COVID. 
So stay tuned. Keep good cheer. Stay 
hydrated. But this is a debate worth 
having, and I regret very much that we 
could not find common ground here. To 
find it, you have to seek it. And this is 
the one area where we were doing a 
pretty damn good job, I thought, work-
ing together as Republicans and Demo-
crats, spending a lot of money because 
there was a need out there. 
Today we are going to spend a lot of 
money, most of it not related to 
COVID, and it is going to be along par-
tisan lines. It is unfortunate, but it is 
the choice my Democratic colleagues 
made. And we are going to hold them 
to that choice. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my 
colleague, the ranking member, Sen-
ator GRAHAM, says: Why?—$1.9 trillion, 
a lot of money. We have spent money 
over the last year. He is right. Why did 
we spend the money? The answer is be-
cause we are facing a series of unprece-
dented crises and because the Amer-
ican people are reaching out to us, and 
they are saying: We are hurting. We 
are in desperate condition, and we need 
help from the Federal Government. 
That is why we are responding. 
Half a million people have died in 
this country from COVID, and many 
millions more have been made ill. And 
what the long-term impact of those ill-
nesses are nobody at this point knows, 
but certainly no one will deny that we 
have a pandemic crisis. 
Our job is to make sure that we 
produce the vaccines that the Amer-
ican people desperately need and that 
we develop an effective mechanism to 
get it into the arms of the American 
people. And the truth is—I want to 
thank the President and his team—we 
have made progress in the last month, 
but we still have a long, long way to 
go. To produce the vaccines, to hire the 
people who will make sure that people 
get those vaccines, inject people with 
the vaccines, it is going to take money. 
Everybody in this Senate and, I as-
sume, in the country wants our kids to 
get back to school. Well, you just can’t 
open the schools unless they are safe. 
Parents are not going to send their 
kids back to those schools. Teachers 
are not going to teach. Childcare work-
ers are not going to provide the care 
that the little ones need. 
And do you know what? To make 
those schoolrooms and school buildings 
safe is going to require resources, but, 
for the sake of our children, we need to 
reopen the schools as quickly as pos-
sible and do it in a safe way. 
There is money in this bill—Senator 
GRAHAM
didn’t mention it—to make 
sure that, this coming summer, school 
districts all over this country have the 
resources 
to 
provide 
strong, 
well- 
staffed summer programs so kids who 
have missed significant amounts of 
school can make up some of what they 
have lost, in addition to getting some 
recreation and associating with their 
fellow young people in a way that is 
safe. 
There was a poll that came out just 
last week. It was rather shocking at 
what it said. It said that 63 percent of 
the American people are living pay-
check to paycheck. 
Senator GRAHAM says: Why are we 
spending all of this money? The answer 
is we don’t believe that children in 
America should go hungry. We don’t 
believe that working people should be 
evicted from their apartments or lose 
their homes. We don’t believe that, in 
the midst of a pandemic, people should 
not be able to afford to go to a doctor. 
So making sure that people have 
those direct payments, yeah, we be-
lieve in that. We believe that if a fam-
ily is struggling today through no fault 
of their own, having lost their income, 
yeah, we are going to get them a check 
for 1,400 bucks and a family of four a 
check for $5,600. 
There are a lot of people in this coun-
try who are doing very well, and they 
are wondering: What is this big deal 
about $1,400? That is not a lot of 
money. You go to a corporate lunch, a 
bunch of people come in, and they can 
spend $1,400 on a lunch. 
But if you are struggling to put food 
on the table for your kids, that $5,600 
for a family of four is life and death; it 
is dignity or desperation. 
People are wondering: How am I 
going to pay the rent that I owe after 
the rent moratorium, the eviction mor-
atorium expires? How am I going to 
feed my kids? How am I going to take 
care of the basic necessities of life? 
So, yes, we are providing $1,400 per 
working-class family because that is 
desperately needed. 
So when the Senator says: Well, why 
are we spending all of this money? The 
answer is because we are living in the 
most difficult moment in the modern 
history of this country and, arguably, 
even a more difficult moment than the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. People 
are hurting, and, in a democratic soci-
ety, government is supposed to respond 
to the people who sent us here. 
Now, I know that there is con-
troversy, and Senator GRAHAM raised 
this issue. Democrats have a majority, 
a bare majority with the Vice Presi-
dent—51 votes. Why are we not working 
with our Republican colleagues? We 
have reached out time and time and 
time again. The President has reached 
out: Work with us. But you have got to 
understand the severity of the crisis, 
and they have not done this. 
Using reconciliation, by the way, as 
the Presiding Officer well knows, is not 
a new idea. When our Republican col-
leagues had the majority, they used 
reconciliation. What did they use it 
for? They used it for massive tax 
breaks for the rich. That is what they 
used reconciliation for. They used rec-
onciliation in order to try to throw 32 
million Americans off the Affordable 
Care Act, something that Trump was 
fervent about. And by one vote—Sen-
ator McCain—we prevented 32 million 
people from losing their health insur-
ance through the reconciliation proc-
ess. 
So our response is, you want unity? 
Well, do you know what? We probably 
have more unity today in America 
around this package than anything 
that I can remember. The polls vary: 
65, 70 percent of the American people 
understand the crisis we are facing. 
They want us to respond. This legisla-
tion is enormously popular, not just 
from progressives, not from moderates, 
but from Republicans, as well, depend-
ing on the poll. 
Forty, fifty percent more Repub-
licans support it because they can’t af-
ford to pay their rent. They can’t af-
ford to go to the doctor. They under-
stand that government has to help. 
So the real question here—and Presi-
dent Biden has raised this issue—is, we 
believe in unity, we believe in bringing 
people together. How does it happen 
that when 40, 50 percent of Republicans 
support this legislation, we can’t get 
one vote from Republicans here? What

March 5, 2021 
is going on? And the answer is, I am 
afraid, that my Republican colleagues 
have moved so far to the right that 
they have lost contact with the needs 
of working families. 
As I said earlier, this legislation is 
not just about dealing with the pan-
demic and healthcare. It is not just 
dealing 
with 
the 
severe 
economic 
downturn that we are facing. It is not 
just dealing with the disruption of edu-
cation in America and so much more. 
It is not just dealing with the worst 
moment in the modern history of this 
country. This amendment, this legisla-
tion, has everything to do with restor-
ing the confidence of the American 
people in democracy and in their gov-
ernment. And if we can’t respond to 
the pain of working families today, we 
don’t deserve to be here. 
Senator GRAHAM said it is going to be 
a long night. Bring it on. We are ready. 
But at the end of the day, we are going 
to do what the American people want, 
what the American people need. We are 
going to pass the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, later 
today the Senate will vote on an 
amendment put forward by Senator 
CARPER and myself dealing with an ex-
tension of enhanced unemployment 
benefits. 
Some Members of the Senate wanted 
to hold the enhanced weekly benefit at 
$300 per week. My preference would 
have been to set it at $400 per week on 
the longest extension possible and then 
later tie benefits to economic condi-
tions on the ground with automatic 
triggers. With the amendment coming 
later today, I believe Members have 
reached a solution that accomplishes 
two key goals. 
First, it is a longer extension of bene-
fits than the House bill that avoids cre-
ating a new August cliff. It would ex-
tend the weekly benefit at $300 per 
week into early October, including pan-
demic benefits for gig workers and the 
self-employed. I have said time and 
again that having an expiration in the 
middle of August, when Senators are 
home, would be a prescription for trou-
ble, and this option avoids the poten-
tial of benefits expiring for millions of 
Americans with no way to extend 
them. 
Second, it would prevent a tax sur-
prise for millions of Americans who re-
ceived unemployment benefits in 2020. 
The first $10,200 of the unemployment 
benefits they received last year would 
be exempt from income tax. People 
who already filed their taxes and found 
out that they owed tax on their unem-
ployment income would be able to file 
an amended return to get back the dif-
ference. 
This will wipe out taxes owed on last 
year’s unemployment income for most 
people who received it, saving them po-
tentially thousands of dollars. That is 
a big economic benefit for the people 
hardest hit by the COVID crash, and 
jobless Americans will also have the 
certainty of enhanced benefits running 
into October. My understanding is, the 
Republican side will offer an amend-
ment that will not prevent this tax 
surprise. 
I am going to keep working on auto-
matic triggers. In my view, that is the 
best way to manage this program going 
forward. But as for this debate, I urge 
all my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DUR-
BIN). The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. The Republicans yield 
back their time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is 
yielded back. 
Mr. SANDERS. I yield back my time 
as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the 
budgetary 
effects 
of 
the 
pending 
amendment, 972, offered by Senator 
SANDERS, are merely incidental to the 
nonbudgetary effects of the amend-
ment. Accordingly, the amendment is 
extraneous. Therefore, I raise a point 
of order against this measure pursuant 
to section 313(b)1(D) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in ac-
cordance with section 904 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 and the 
waiver provisions of all applicable 
budget resolutions, I move to waive all 
applicable sections of that act and ap-
plicable budget resolutions for pur-
poses of amendment No. 972, and I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DUR-
BIN). On this vote, the yeas are 42, the 
nays are 58. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion to waive all 
applicable budgetary discipline with 
respect to the Senator from Vermont’s 
amendment No. 972 is rejected. 
The point of order is sustained and 
the amendment falls. 
The amendment (No. 972) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
agreement that has been reached will 
allow us to move forward with the 
American Rescue Plan, and voting will 
resume shortly. 
Senate Democrats are completely 
united in our belief about how impor-
tant this entire bill is for our fellow 
Americans; for getting the vaccine to 
our people; for reopening our schools; 
for keeping American workers, fami-
lies, and businesses afloat; and for put-
ting our country on the road to a 
strong recovery. 
Now that this agreement has been 
reached, we are going to power through 
the rest of the process and get this bill 
done. Make no mistake, we are going 
to continue working until we get the 
job done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, par-
liamentary inquiry: At what time did 
the previous vote on the Senator’s 
amendment begin? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote 
began at 11:03 a.m. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. How much total 
time elapsed during the floor vote on 
the Senator’s amendment? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven 
hours and 50 minutes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Well, my good-
ness, this has been quite a start, quite 
a start to this fast-track process. They 
were in a big hurry. We started voting

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1231 
March 5, 2021 
on the first amendment, as the Parlia-
mentarian said, right after 11 a.m. The 
Democratic leader held the vote open 
all day so they could try to figure out 
what was going on with their own leg-
islation that they want to pass only 
with their votes. 
Now, the last time we had a long 
string of amendment votes was just a 
couple weeks ago. We considered about 
40 amendments. So if you multiply 11 
hours of scrambling times 40 amend-
ments, you would land at about 440 
hours. That is about 18 days with zero 
breaks. 
So, look, the whole idea behind this, 
I gathered from listening to them over 
the last few weeks, was to use the cri-
sis to jam through what the White 
House Chief of Staff called ‘‘the most 
progressive domestic legislation in a 
generation.’’ A little tougher than they 
thought it was going to be, isn’t it? It 
turned out to be a little bit tougher. 
Well, what this proves is there are 
benefits to bipartisanship when you are 
dealing with an issue of this mag-
nitude. We all remember that we did 
this five times last year. We did it to-
gether. I think there were no more 
than eight votes against any of these 
proposals. We spent about $4 trillion on 
pandemic relief. Every one passed, as I 
said, with 90 or more votes. Not a sin-
gle spectacle like today—not one. 
Exactly 1 year ago, instead of par-
tisan scrambling, we were humming 
with bipartisan work, working on it to-
gether. We had a bipartisan task force 
building the CARES Act from the bot-
tom up. We passed the bill 96 to 0. 
We were prepared to do yet another 
bill on a bipartisan basis. Several of 
our Members went down to the White 
House, sat down with the President, 
laid out a proposal we thought made 
sense given where we were now. But, 
no, they wanted to do it the hard way. 
Wanted to do it the hard way. 
So now they want to begin the vote- 
arama that could have been done in 
daylight because of their own confu-
sion and the challenges of getting to-
gether 50 people to agree on something 
when they could have been doing it 
quicker on a bipartisan basis. 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. President, so rather than start 
the voting at 5 minutes to 11, I move to 
adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow, and I 
ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous 
consent that there be 6 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, every-
body around here agrees that the U.S. 
economy is getting better—there is no 
argument about that—and that work-
ers are needed. Yet, in this massive 
partisan spending bill, a lot of which is 
not even about COVID–19, the Demo-
crats are insisting on a substantial in-
crease to the already extraordinary 
Federal Government add-on to State 
unemployment payments, making it 
harder to get people who can go back 
to work. 
Just this morning, we learned that 
the economy added 379,000 jobs in Feb-
ruary and that the unemployment rate 
dropped to 6.2 percent. The nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office and the 
consensus of economists is that unem-
ployment will continue to trend lower. 
It underscores what the CBO has said 
recently, which is that, without any 
additional stimulus, the economy will 
recover to prepandemic levels by mid-
year, this year—that is June 30—not in 
September as the Democrats’ approach 
would suggest. 
Look at your own States. Employers 
are looking to hire people. ‘‘Help want-
ed’’ signs are up. As the economy starts 
to improve, we want to get people back 
to work. 
Adding to the good news, President 
Biden now tells us that vaccines will be 
available by the end of May for all who 
will want them. That will further kick- 
start the economy. 
Despite the better news, as we under-
stand it, the Democrats’ approach ac-
tually extends the generous Federal 
supplement currently in place until 
September 6—by the way, even a little 
beyond what is in the $1.9 trillion un-
derlying bill. 
I was just told that it has a $31 bil-
lion tax increase that affects the so- 
called passthrough, which is primarily 
small businesses, to pay for a proposal 
to pay people more who are on unem-
ployment insurance. 
The Democrats’ proposal makes it 
even more advantageous to be on un-
employment by changing retroactively 
a longstanding policy that says UI ben-
efits are taxed as income. You make up 
to 10,000 bucks in benefits, tax-free, 
even if you have made up to $150,000 a 
year. Remember, with that 600 bucks a 
week Federal supplement, which is 
what it was for a lot of last year when 
this would have applied, about 70 per-
cent of workers on UI made more than 
they would have at their jobs. Even at 
300 bucks a week, 42 percent of workers 
are making more on UI than they 
would make at their jobs. 
Of the essential workers, think of the 
truckdrivers who are making 25 bucks 
an hour. They are being told ‘‘you have 
to pay your taxes,’’ but those who 
aren’t working not only get the UI ben-
efits, but now, for the first time ever, 
some of that income is actually going 
to be tax-free. So you have to pay your 
taxes, but they don’t. That is not fair. 
The underlying bill and the Demo-
crats’ alternative are going to hurt the 
effort to get people back to work. Our 
amendment would extend UI benefits 
in a responsible manner at the current 
low level of $300 per week through July 
18. According to the CBO, this will save 
over $90 billion in outlays and actually 
raise $600 million in revenue. Why? Be-
cause people will be working. That is a 
good thing. We should want that. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose un-
necessarily lengthening the time of the 
Federal UI supplement that would 
make it even more advantageous to be 
on unemployment and would slow the 
job creation we all want. Our amend-
ment strikes the right balance. It helps 
those who truly need it, promotes bet-
ter stewardship of our taxpayer dollars, 
and encourages those who can return 
to work to do so. I urge its adoption. 
(Applause.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from Or-
egon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, yes-
terday, the Senate learned that there 
were 
745,000 
new 
unemployment 
claims—higher than the worst week of 
the great recession. Yet the Portman 
amendment is a double whammy on 
workers—a much faster cutoff of bene-
fits and absolutely no help with the 
nasty tax surprise millions of working 
families will find when they file their 
taxes in the next few weeks. 
For example, if you have been laid off 
from your job through no fault of your 
own and you are struggling to make 
ends meet, you do not have $1,000 to 
pay a surprise tax bill, and the party 
that claims to be for tax relief for 
working families offers you absolutely 
nothing. 
Since the pandemic, Senate Repub-
licans have been pushing working fami-
lies deeper into an economic hole. We 
have an alternative that doesn’t hang 
working families out to dry, and we 
will be offering it shortly. 
Working families deserve better than 
the Portman amendment. Don’t short-
change those working families tonight. 
I urge opposition to this very flawed 
amendment.

The amendment (No. 1092) was agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1242 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.) 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 1242, and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Maine [Ms. COLLINS], for 
herself and others, proposes an amendment 
numbered 1242 to amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator will proceed. 
Ms. COLLINS. This amendment pro-
vides $650 billion of immediate relief to 
those Americans who need it most. It 
is focused on the COVID crisis before 
us, not on future unrelated spending 
priorities. The amendment provides 
$160 billion to bolster vaccine produc-
tion and delivery, as well as testing 
and 
much 
needed 
support 
for 
healthcare providers. 
It includes $1,400 checks for lower 
and middle-income Americans and ex-
tends unemployment insurance. 
It targets money to reopen schools, 
something that needs to happen as 
soon as possible, and to expand access 
to childcare. 
It has funding for substance abuse 
programs to combat the opioid epi-
demic that has worsened. 
This amendment would save tax dol-
lars. It would save taxpayers more 
than $1.2 trillion while meeting imme-
diate needs. 
The emergency we are facing should 
not be an excuse for funding partisan 
priorities. Instead, we should come to-
gether—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired. 
Ms. COLLINS.—just as we had on the 
five previous bipartisan bills. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont is recognized for 1 
minute. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, given 
the unprecedented series of crises this 
country now faces, the Republican 
amendment simply does not accom-
plish what the American people need or 
what they want. 
Our bill would substantially expand 
the child tax credit and cut child pov-
erty in this country in half. Our bill 
provides a full $1,400 direct payment to 
every working-class adult and their 
kids. Under the Collins amendment, if 
you are a single parent earning $50,000, 
you get zero, nothing at all, while mil-
lions of children would receive just $500 
instead of the full $1,400 payment. 
Our bill provides $130 billion to public 
schools so our kids can get back to 
school and get back safely. The Repub-
lican alternative does not. 
Our plan provides $40 billion to col-
leges and universities, which have al-
ready lost 650,000 jobs, and many 
are—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SANDERS.—cutting down. The 
Republican amendment simply does 
not do what the American people need 
right now. I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote. Oh, I 
raise a point of order. I am sorry. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, I raise a point of order 
that the pending amendment produces 
budgetary changes that are merely in-
cidental to the nonbudgetary compo-
nents of the amendment and therefore 
violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine is recognized. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act, I move to waive, and I ask 
for the yeas and nays.

The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina], for himself and 
Mr. BARRASSO, proposes an amendment num-
bered 1030 to amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
Strike section 9818 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 9818. FUNDING FOR STATE STRIKE TEAMS 
FOR 
RESIDENT 
AND 
EMPLOYEE 
SAFETY IN NURSING FACILITIES. 
Section 1919 of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1396r) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsections: 
‘‘(k) FUNDING FOR STATE STRIKE TEAMS.— 
In addition to amounts otherwise available, 
there is appropriated to the Secretary, out of 
any monies in the Treasury not otherwise 
appropriated, $250,000,000, to remain avail-
able until expended, for purposes of allo-
cating such amount among the States (in-
cluding the District of Columbia and each 
territory of the United States) for such a 
State to establish and implement a strike 
team that will be deployed to a nursing facil-
ity in the State with diagnosed or suspected 
cases of COVID–19 among residents or staff 
for the purposes of assisting with clinical 
care, infection control, or staffing during the 
emergency 
period 
described 
in 
section 
1135(g)(1)(B) and the 1-year period imme-
diately following the end of such emergency 
period. 
‘‘(l) LIMITATION.—The Secretary shall not 
make an allocation under subsection (k) to a 
State unless the State, for each month that 
occurs during the period that begins on Octo-
ber 1, 2020, and ends on the last day of the 1- 
year period described in such subsection, 
provides accurate monthly reporting to the 
Secretary on the number of COVID–19 deaths 
of residents of nursing facilities and skilled 
nursing facilities (as defined in 1819(a)) and 
certifies that such deaths are not included in 
counts of COVID–19 deaths in other settings. 
The Secretary shall rescind any amounts 
previously allocated to a State under sub-
section (k) if the State fails to comply with 
the requirement of this subsection.’’. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent for 
2 minutes of debate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Senator SCOTT will proceed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1234 
March 5, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I have been doing some re-
search as the ranking member of the 
Aging Committee. As of last month, 40 
percent of COVID-related deaths in this 
country were residents or staff of long- 
term care facilities. Lawmakers are 
charged with the responsibility of pro-
tecting the most vulnerable popu-
lations in our country, and those num-
bers represent absolute failure. 
Some 
States 
have 
underreported 
deaths in nursing homes, and some 
public officials made this move inten-
tionally, a clear effort to deceive their 
populations into thinking the situation 
was not as dire. Inaccurate information 
affects 
life-and-death 
decisions 
for 
communities. 
Requiring States to provide accurate 
data is common sense for anyone who 
believes, as I do, that we should have a 
science-based, fact-driven response to 
the pandemic. We should not offer 
more funding to States that have mis-
managed and then covered up their 
pandemic response. It makes no sense. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I urge 
my colleagues to do the right thing and 
vote in favor of this amendment. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
rises in opposition? 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon is recognized for 1 
minute. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-
leagues, 
the 
number 
of 
COVID–19 
deaths among nursing home residents 
and staff is tragic. That is why Presi-
dent Biden’s and the Democrats’ plan 
goes forward with an investment in 
preventing nursing home infections 
and deaths, including more PPE strike 
teams to address infections, testing, 
contact tracing, and more. 
We take a backseat to no one when it 
comes to timely and accurate reporting 
in COVID–19 cases, and deaths will con-
tinue to ensure such reporting. How-
ever, it would be a grave mistake to 
hold hostage this badly needed support 
for strike teams to ensure residents’ 
and employees’ safety in nursing home 
facilities. These funds are essential to 
helping ensure the safety of seniors and 
staff that are at the frontlines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
This amendment, colleagues, is puni-
tive, and it doesn’t further the goal of 
transparency. It would hurt the very 
people we seek to protect. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-
ment. I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent to 
have 30 seconds to respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank 
you, Mr. President. 
I would simply say that what my 
amendment does is it says that you 
can’t lie about the numbers. The bot-
tom line, it simply says that it is very 
important for us to have accurate in-
formation about the deaths in nursing 
homes. The more accurate the informa-
tion, the more likely we are to have 
the best response. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 30 sec-
onds? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon is recognized for 30 
seconds without objection. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on this 
side of the aisle, we have led the fight 
for transparency with respect to the 
kind of information my colleague is 
talking about. That is not what this 
amendment is about. 
This amendment is about making 
sure that President Biden and Demo-
crats can make these necessary invest-
ments in these strike teams that are 
going to ensure more safety in these 
long-term care facilities. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask for 10 seconds to re-
spond to my good friend from Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank 
you, Mr. President. 
I will just simply say that even 
President Biden himself has suggested 
that investigations are warranted into 
this issue. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1030

AMENDMENT NO. 1378 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up 
amendment No. 1378 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1378 to 
amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 6 minutes, even-
ly divided, to discuss this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on this 
side, our goal has been to secure the 
strongest possible protections for job-
less Americans that could pass the 
Senate. This amendment has two es-
sential features that make it far better 
for working families than the Portman 
amendment. 
It ensures that millions of working 
families get their benefits at least 
through September 5. It protects unem-
ployed workers from being hit with a 
big surprise tax bill with no way to pay 
for it. 
Republicans have been standing in 
lockstep against tax relief for Ameri-
cans with a few hundred dollars in the 
bank after demanding billions in write- 
offs for wealthy investors. On the other 
hand, Democrats have led the effort to 
add hundreds of dollars in weekly bene-
fits and covering gig workers and the 
self-employed. 
This is the boldest action the Con-
gress has ever taken—ever taken—to 
support jobless Americans during an 
economic crisis, and at every stage, as 
Democrats 
proposed 
that 
help 
for 
working families, Senate Republicans 
opposed us. This goes back, colleagues, 
to the CARES Act, when Republicans 
had just one amendment. That was to 
gut the jobless protections. 
Finally, the whole process under-
scores the need to stop jumping from 
one economic cliff to another. There 
would be no need to predict the level of 
economic support needed 6 months

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1235 
March 5, 2021 
with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, but tonight it is vital, as the pan-
demic continues, that the Senate pass 
this amendment, an economic lifeline 
for Americans who would strongly pre-
fer to be back at work. 
Instead of attacking Americans as 
lazy individuals who don’t want to 
work, these are responsible adults with 
a strong work ethic who will help us 
build back better in the days to come. 
I strongly urge support for our 
amendment. 
I yield. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time? 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio is recognized. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, let’s 
be clear with what is going on here. 
The Republicans have offered a very 
generous unemployment system, in-
cluding 300 bucks per week, as is the 
current law after March 15, when it 
would otherwise expire, and taking it 
to July 18. 
Now, there is nobody in this Chamber 
that doesn’t see that the economy is 
improving. 
And 
the 
Congressional 
Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan 
group here, has told us that, actually, 
by the middle of this year, we are going 
to be back to the prepandemic level in 
terms of our economy. Every econo-
mist looks at this and says that unem-
ployment is going down. 
I note that my colleague over there, 
from Oregon, said that claims were 
higher last week in terms of unemploy-
ment. The 4-week average is actually 
down, considerably. 
Let me tell you what happened 
today, because I just looked it up. New 
York opened its movie theaters; Vir-
ginia announced they are opening their 
schools; West Virginia opened their 
bars, their restaurants, all businesses; 
Connecticut is opening indoor dining. 
This is happening every day. The econ-
omy is getting better. 
And everybody says—including, by 
the way, Larry Summers, a famous 
Democratic economist, who was Treas-
ury 
Secretary 
under 
President 
Obama—that when you look at what 
happens with regard to unemployment 
insurance, if it is too high, it is a dis-
incentive to work. 
I don’t think Larry Summers is say-
ing people are lazy. I think what Larry 
Summers is saying is that you want to 
have a system that is balanced, where 
you are encouraging people to work. 
There are so many employers in our 
States who are looking for people right 
now, and that is going to continue to 
happen as we open up more. 
Look, our unemployment provision is 
very reasonable; it is very generous— 
taking it through July 18. 
They are taking theirs through Sep-
tember 6. And then they are adding 
this new element that has never been 
in unemployment before, where sud-
denly if you are on unemployment in-
surance, you don’t have to pay taxes, 
but if you are working you do have to 
pay taxes. 
How does that make sense? Don’t we 
want to encourage people to work? I 
think we do. I hope that my colleagues 
will vote down this amendment and 
continue to keep the Portman amend-
ment in place, which, by the way, 
passed this Chamber only about an 
hour and a half ago. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
going to ask for 15 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator 
WYDEN has 45 seconds remaining. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first of 
all, with respect to the facts about un-
employment, every week—every week 
since 
last 
March, 
unemployment 
claims have been higher than the worst 
week of the great recession. And the 
fact is, we have got millions of Ameri-
cans who, every single week, are walk-
ing an economic tightrope. They are 
balancing the food bill against the fuel 
bill and the fuel bill against the rent 
bill. And we want to give them a mod-
est amount of tax relief for the typical 
working person, and the party that 
claims to want to help workers on 
their taxes won’t lift a finger. That is 
why it is so important that this 
amendment pass. 
I yield. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 15 seconds to re-
spond, and then I will stop. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator has time remaining. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, No. 1, 
the 4-week average on unemployment 
claims are actually going the right 
way. Why? Because the economy is 
opening up, folks. If you don’t see that, 
you are not going home to your States 
and talking to your employers. 
Second, we have a situation here 
where the Republicans are saying we 
want to continue the $300 per month— 
or per week after March 15, but let’s 
end it on July 18. If things turn south— 
which no one is predicting, by the way, 
not a single economist—I know a lot of 
us would be willing to work with the 
other side of the aisle to extend, but 
there is no reason to do that at this 
point. 
With regard to your tax cut, it is a 
tax increase. It is a tax increase on 
small businesses. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1378 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
Mr. WYDEN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

section (c). 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I think we 
can all agree we have kids in America 
who need to be in school who haven’t 
been in school over a year now, in some 
cases. 
The science is clear that you can 
open up schools safely. Now, I know 
different districts have different chal-
lenges about opening up. This bill pro-
vides money for everybody to open up. 
We don’t want to change that. We want 
to help every district. 
Under my amendment, every district 
in the country would get money, but 
the more days of the week you are 
open, the more money you are going to 
get, which makes all the sense in the 
world. If you are going to open 4 days 
a week, you shouldn’t have as much 
money as a district that is going to 
open 5 days a week. 
The purpose of the money that is 
being provided is so that schools can 
fund the cost of opening safely. All this 
amendment tries to do is create an in-
centive for these districts to open up 
more days because we do have unions— 
to be fair, not all, but we do have 
teachers unions in this country that 
are saying they are not going back 
until next year, even if they are vac-
cinated, even if all the measures are 
put in place. 
We have a crisis in this country. We 
have seen now a surge in mental health 
problems, with young people showing 
up at hospitals, and across the country, 
it is a terrible situation, not to men-
tion the year of lost learning. This 
amendment incentivizes us to get our 
kids back in school. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the 
only way to safely reopen schools for 
in-person learning and keep them open 
is to provide the $125 billion that is in-
cluded in the American Rescue Plan 
Act for our K–12 schools. This Federal 
funding will support schools in their 
implementing safety protocols that are 
aligned with local public health guid-
ance in order to safely reopen, stay 
open, and help students with learning 
recovery. Our goal is clear. 
Let me make something else clear. 
The amendment offered today to condi-
tion funds on forced school reopenings 
is simply a political show that will, ac-
tually, further disadvantage schools 
that have already suffered the most. If 
we only provide funding to schools that 
are physically open, schools in commu-
nities with high rates of COVID–19 
can’t receive the money they need to 
implement health safety protocols, but 
they will feel the pressure to reopen 
even if it is not safe. So conditioning 
funds actually undermines our ability 
to get students back in the classroom 
safely. 
Let’s 
prioritize 
student 
learning. 
Safe in-person learning is paramount 
so let’s stop wasting time. Let’s pass 
this plan and get the schools the funds 
they need.

ator’s time has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1237 
March 5, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I be-
lieve that every single Member of this 
body agrees that remote learning is 
taking an enormous toll on our stu-
dents, teachers, and our students’ fami-
lies, and that we need to safely get stu-
dents back into the classroom. 
This amendment would ensure that 
educational agencies receiving relief 
funds will within 30 days develop and 
make publicly available a plan for the 
safe return to in-person instruction. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in 
supporting 
this 
commonsense 
amendment to support an objective 
that we all share: getting our students 
safely back in their classrooms. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, last year 
Congress provided nearly $68 billion in 
emergency funding for schools. About 
10 percent of that has been used. This 
bill provides another $126 billion, with 
no requirement that we get kids back 
to school. 
We know they need to be back in 
school. I think this amendment actu-
ally, if applied, almost ensures we 
won’t get back to school this year. 
Thirty days to come up with a plan; 
public comment on that plan. It is the 
middle of March before anybody even 
begins to make—have the 30 days to 
make that plan. We need to get kids 
back to school. The New York Times 
understands that. 
Many States are saying the suicide 
rates, the emergency room mental 
health concerns demand that kids get 
back to school, and not next year but 
they get back to school as quickly as 
they can this year. 
I think this amendment, while I am 
sure offered in good intention, works 
against that, not for it, and I would 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendment.

COVERY FUNDS’’. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
for 2 minutes, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRAHAM. There was a time 
about a year ago when we were to-
gether, and we passed a COVID relief 
bill of $1.9 trillion, 96 to nothing. What 
happened? You all got it now. 
So here is what I want you to know. 
That CARES formula, that bill we 
passed, had an allocation for State and 
local funding that has been changed by 
our Democratic friends, and the biggest 
winners are New York and California. 
So the formula they are using now, 
New York and California wins big. You 
need to check what you are doing be-
cause you are giving a lot of money to 
New York and California because they 
can do it. 
This is a big State bailout. You need 
to check and explain to people back in 
your State why they need more money 
than you do. You are rewarding people 
who have closed down the economy, 
won’t reopen, so I am asking to go 
back to the bipartisan formula, reject 
this partisan formula that rewards 
Democratic blue States at the expense 
of most everybody else in this building. 
So if you don’t know how your State 
is doing, we know how your State is 
doing, and you will hear about it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
nobody on our side likes this amend-
ment, and we urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. It 
would tie the hands of local and State 
government. It would make it more dif-
ficult to rehire or interfere with recov-
ery in our capital cities, so if we could 
all have a resounding ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
Graham amendment, I would appre-
ciate it and yield back further time.

AMENDMENT NO. 1197 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
like to call up amendment No. 1197 and 
ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. TESTER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1197 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To require the President to review 
and approve the Keystone XL Pipeline to 
assist COVID-impacted communities) 
At the end of title X, add the following: 
SEC. 10lll. APPROVAL OF KEYSTONE XL PIPE-
LINE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
President shall review and approve a permit 
for the project of TransCanada Keystone 
Pipeline, L.P., to construct, connect, oper-
ate, and maintain the pipeline and cross-bor-
der facilities at the northern border of the 
State of Montana necessary to import oil 
from Canada to the United States, as de-
scribed in the Presidential Permit of March 
29, 2019 (84 Fed. Reg. 13101 (April 3, 2019)), if 
the President determines that the project 
would create construction jobs and increase 
tax revenues in communities that have been 
economically impacted by COVID–19. 
(b) REVOCATION.—Section 6 of Executive 
Order 13990 (86 Fed. Reg. 7041 (January 25, 
2021)) shall have no force or effect. 
Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 4 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. Senator HOEVEN will 
speak for 1 minute. I will speak for 1 
minute, and I would ask that I be noti-
fied when I run of out of my minute. 
Mr. President, this is the most im-
portant vote of the night. It is 2:41, so 
pay attention here. 
The Keystone Pipeline would create 
good-paying jobs and bring much need-
ed revenue to rural counties in Eastern 
Montana. These counties have been 
hard-hit by the pandemic. They have 
also been hard-hit by trade wars that 
have impacted our agricultural com-
munity. So they need the tax base, and 
this XL Pipeline would give them the 
tax base. 
Look, there is no doubt the pipeline 
needs to be built responsibly with 
American steel to the highest safety 
standards to respect private property 
rights and to include significant con-
sultation with Native American Tribes. 
But the fact is, we have many pipelines 
to go across the border between Canada 
and the United States. This is just one. 
I would ask you to support this 
amendment. 
Senator HOEVEN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank the Senator from Mon-
tana for offering this amendment and 
to speak strongly in support of the 
amendment. 
In 2015, S. 1 authorized the Keystone 
Pipeline. So we have voted on this be-
fore, and we have approved it. We need 
to do it again. 
Look, whether you are for traditional 
sources of energy or renewable sources 
of energy or both, we need the infra-
structure to move it around the coun-
try as safely as possible in an environ-
mentally sound way on a dependable 
basis. That means we need trans-
mission lines, and we need pipelines. 
Let’s come together. Let’s continue 
to build our energy future, not to men-
tion the 11,000-plus jobs directly in-
volved in working on this pipeline. But

for energy independence and energy se-
curity for our country, for good-paying 
jobs, energy is foundational to every-
thing we do in our economy. Let’s sup-
port this amendment. 
I yield back to Senator TESTER. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senator 
MANCHIN be added to this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Biden is right. He canceled the 
Keystone Pipeline because he is listen-
ing to the scientists, and what the sci-
entists are telling us is that we have a 
small number of years—5, 6, 7 years— 
before this country and this world face 
irreparable—I underline the word ‘‘ir-
reparable’’—harm because of climate 
change. 
My friends here talk about creating 
jobs. Well, we all want to create jobs. 
Do you know where the jobs are? The 
jobs are in energy efficiency. The jobs 
are in sustainable energy. That is 
where the jobs of the future are. 
If we love our kids and if we love our 
grandchildren and if we want to leave 
them a country and a planet that is 
healthy and is habitable, yes, this 
country is going to have to lead the 
world, work with the world, in trans-
forming our energy system away from 
fossil fuel. 
I urge opposition to this amendment. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, I raise a point of order 
that the pending amendment is not 
germane and therefore violates section 
305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, in ac-
cordance with section 904 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 and the 
waiver provisions of all applicable 
budget resolutions, I move to waive all 
applicable sections of that act and ap-
plicable budget resolutions for the pur-
pose of amendment No. 1197, and I 
would ask for the yeas and nays.

AMENDMENT NO. 1161 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. CASSIDY. I call up my amend-
ment No. 1161 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. CASSIDY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1161. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To improve the bill regarding 
emergency assistance to non-public schools) 
In section 2002 strike ‘‘that enroll a signifi-
cant percentage of’’ and all that follows 
through the end of the section and insert 
‘‘under the terms and conditions of section 
312(d) of the Coronavirus Response and Relief 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (divi-
sion M of Public Law 116–260).’’ 
Mr. CASSIDY. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 2 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, on a bi-
partisan basis, the December COVID 
relief bill included emergency assist-
ance to private and parochial schools, 
reimbursing for things such as dis-
infectants, technology, and PPE. 
Guidelines prioritize schools serving 
low-income students. The current bill 
has money for private and parochial 
schools but, incredibly, does not allow 
reimbursement for COVID-related ex-
penses in a COVID relief bill. It does 
allow arbitrary guidelines restricting 
which schools are eligible. 
My amendment goes back to the bi-
partisan language agreed to in Decem-
ber, prioritizing schools with low-in-
come students and addressing COVID 
expenses. I urge colleagues to support 
these schools serving 10 percent of 
America’s children, 7 percent of chil-
dren in poverty, to support their fami-
lies. Please support this amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I op-
pose this amendment. It would strike 
two important improvements we made 
to the program that funds private 
schools. 
First, Republicans are critiquing this 
bill for not being targeted enough, but 
this amendment would remove the re-
quirement to target funding to private 
schools that serve significant percent-
ages of low-income students. 
The American Rescue Plan provides 
an additional $2.75 billion for services 
to private schools. And the bottom line 
is, Federal funds shouldn’t be spent at 
expensive 
private 
schools. 
Instead, 
they should be targeted to low-income 
students at private schools like all our 
other education investments. 
The pandemic is disproportionately 
harming students of color and those 
from families with low incomes. While 
these students are already much more 
likely to attend public schools, we need 
to make sure that those who do attend 
private schools are prioritized as well. 
Secondly, this amendment strikes 
the limitation we placed on the funds 
being used for reimbursements at pri-
vate schools. Reimbursements that 
were permitted with the first round of 
funding for this program were in order 
to cover past expenses incurred by pri-
vate schools. Those expenses should be 
reimbursed by that first round. These 
additional funds are intended to pro-
vide services for private schools in the 
future. I ask my colleagues to oppose 
this amendment. 
Mr. CASSIDY. How many seconds do 
I have left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am 
sorry, the Senator has no time remain-
ing. 
Mr. CASSIDY. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 10 seconds, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CASSIDY. This is the exact same 
language that we used in December. It 
targets children with private schools. 
To say that you are going to restrict it 
further than that is merely a way to 
keep the kids from having it. Seven 
percent of kids in poverty go to private 
schools. About 7 percent of this money 
will go to private kids. We should sup-
port the children.

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Grassley moves to commit the bill, 
H.R. 1319, to the Committee on Finance with 
instructions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on 
which the Senate is not in session, with

Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent that there be 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
bill includes an $86 billion no-strings 
bailout 
of 
multiemployer 
pension 
plans. It does not belong in the current 
package. It has nothing to do with 
COVID. The bailout is not coupled with 
any reforms. Consequently, there won’t 
be any long-term sustainability. It is 
just a blank check with no measures to 
hold plans accountable. 
Senator Alexander and I spent the 
last Congress working on a responsible 
proposal to rescue and reform failing 
multiemployer pension plans. Without 
reforms included, the precedent will be 
that taxpayers, not the PPGC, will be 
the ultimate guarantors of private em-
ployer pensions. In that case, the bur-
den on the taxpayers will not be for the 
$86 billion. It will be endless as to how 
much the taxpayers are going to have 
to pay. 
Please vote in favor of my motion to 
commit to consider the reforms nec-
essary to protect the taxpayers and en-
sure the long-term sustainability of 
the multiemployer pension system. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, every 
time banks need help and every time 
large corporate interests need help, 
this body rises to the occasion, but 
when it is a bunch of workers or a 
bunch of small businesses, we are going 
to turn our backs? Unions, chambers of 
commerce, and small businesses—pret-
ty much everyone—agree we need to 
get this done. 
I have listened for years to my col-
leagues’ speeches extolling the value of 
hard work and the virtues of small 
businesses. This is your chance, my 
friends, to live up to your own words 
and help these workers. 
In collective bargaining, they nego-
tiate at the bargaining table. They 
gave up money today to put money in 
pensions for the future. If you support 
working Americans, vote no on this 
motion. Let’s pass a solution which ac-
tually honors the dignity of work.

have any time remaining?

farm loan, and there are billions of dol-
lars’ worth out there, and the other is, 
you must be a member of a favored ra-
cial or ethnic group, including African 
American, Hispanic, Asian Americans, 
and some others. There is no income 
test. There is no asset test. It doesn’t 
matter whether you are rich or poor. 
You don’t have to have experienced 
any harm of any kind whatsoever, in-
cluding from COVID. You just have to 
be the right race. 
The senior Senator from Michigan 
called this provision ‘‘an important 
piece of reparations.’’ This bill is sup-
posed to be about COVID relief and 
helping the people who are adversely 
affected by the economics of the 
lockdown. Instead, we are handing out 
money based exclusively on race. This 
is unconstitutional. It is outrageous. 
My amendment strikes the provision, 
and I urge its adoption. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, con-
trary to the suggestion from my col-
league from Pennsylvania, this provi-
sion has everything to do with COVID– 
19 relief. 
The thing about this terrible pan-
demic is that it has both illuminated 
and exacerbated longstanding dispari-
ties rooted in our racial past, and for 
too long, farmers of color have been 
left to fend for themselves, not getting 
the support they deserve from the 
USDA, making it even more difficult 
for them to recover from this pan-
demic. 
We have an opportunity here to lift 
all of our rural communities by aiming 
the aid where it is needed given our 
historic past, which is very much 
present. So I urge all of my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment that strips 
these communities that have been for-
gotten by our government of the relief 
that they so desperately deserve. It 
will have an adverse effect on the very 
relief that we are trying to provide to 
all rural communities.

AMENDMENT NO. 944 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To distribute funds for public 
transportation 
urbanized 
area 
formula 
grants through the existing formulas) 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 944 and ask that 
it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. FISCHER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 944 to 
amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of March 4, 2021, under ‘‘Text of 
Amendments.’’) 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, my 
amendment would fix the proposed new 
formula that benefits New York at the 
expense of other States. The bill pro-
vides $30 billion for transit on top of 
the nearly $40 billion Congress already 
gave transit in the CARES Act and the 
December COVID bill. 
I oppose the extreme funding, but my 
amendment at least fixes one troubling 
detail. The bill directs $26 billion in 
transit to urbanized areas but gives 30 
percent of that to New York City, near-
ly double of what it would receive 
under the normal formula. By voting 
for this bill, my colleagues from States 
like Arizona, Georgia, and West Vir-
ginia would lose out on transit money 
to New York. 
The bill also has $2.2 billion for FTA 
to allocate based on another new for-
mula that just happens to reward the 
largest urban transit systems. My 
amendment would reinstate the reg-
ular formula. It will ensure transit 
money is at least distributed fairly in-
stead of benefitting one or two cities, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I oppose 
the amendment. Don’t believe the false 
argument that most of the funding 
goes to New York. In New Jersey, they 
get the same treatment as everyone 
else. 
The alternative formula offered by 
the amendment is indefensible. One 
small city would get 2,400 times their 
annual transit budget. 
And think about the workers. Think 
about the drivers and the clerks who 
put themselves dealing with the public 
every single day and the anxiety com-
ing home at night about potentially 
having COVID. The way we treat essen-
tial workers is crucial in this bill. If 
you care about workers and if you care 
about the dignity of work, vote no on 
this amendment. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, do I 
have time? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Could I ask unani-
mous consent for 15 more seconds, 
please? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FISCHER. New York would re-
ceive 30 percent more under this new 
formula compared to the 18 percent 
they have now. For example, Reno, NV, 
would lose $2 million, and other cities 
like that lose as well under this new 
formula. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, may I 
ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds 
also? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you. The transit 
formula in the American Rescue Plan 
Act is the exact same formula devel-
oped with Republicans, some of that 
coming out of the Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs Committee for the 
relief bill we passed in December. This 
formula uses data and not politics to 
allocate funds.

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment 1014 and ask that it be

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1014 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike provisions relating to 
nonprofit entities for the paycheck protec-
tion program) 
Strike section 5001. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent for 2 minutes of debate, 
equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Pay-
check Protection Program was created 
to help small businesses. We should all 
agree that an organization with thou-
sands of employees working in dozens 
of cities across the country is not a 
small business, but this bill has a pro-
vision that would extend small busi-
ness assistance to these kinds of large 
organizations. 
That means that an organization op-
erating in 100 cities across America, 
with thousands of employees, will get 
money that was really intended for 
small 
businesses. 
My 
amendment 
would remove this provision, and I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I oppose 
this amendment. This is a matter of 
basic fairness. 
When we passed the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, it included non-
profits. We didn’t have the cost esti-
mates for all the (c)’s. Originally we 
only included the (c)(3)’s. We added the 
(c)(6)’s during the omnibus. This adds 
the rest of the (c)’s, other than (c)(4)’s, 
with the protection against lobbying 
activities, et cetera, that is in the bill. 
The standards are the same as they are 
for the other nonprofits. This is just a 
matter of fairness. 
Let me just point out, according to 
information that we have received 
from 
a 
Johns 
Hopkins 
University 
study, we have lost over a million jobs 
in the nonprofit sector as a result of 
COVID–19. This bill is needed, and we 
need to be fair to all the nonprofits. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the 
amendment.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Indiana [Mr. YOUNG] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1383 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike the provision estab-
lishing the Emergency Federal Employee 
Leave Fund and appropriate $300,000,000 for 
chemical screening devices for U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection) 
Strike section 4001 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4001. FUNDING FOR NARCOTIC AND OPIOID 
DETECTION. 
(a) 
APPROPRIATION.—In 
addition 
to 
amounts otherwise available, there is appro-
priated to U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion for fiscal year 2021, out of any money in 
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, 
$300,000,000, which shall remain available 
until September 30, 2025, to acquire, deploy, 
operate, and maintain chemical screening 
devices to identify, in an operational envi-
ronment, synthetic opioids and other nar-
cotics at purity levels less than or equal to 
10 percent. 
(b) USE OF FUNDS.—Amounts appropriated 
under subsection (a) may also be used— 
(1) to train users on the equipment de-
scribed in such subsection; 
(2) to provide directors of ports of entry 
with an alternate method for identifying 
narcotics, including synthetic opioids, at 
lower purity levels; and 
(3) to test any new chemical screening de-
vices to understand the abilities and limita-
tions of such devices relating to identifying 
narcotics at various purity levels before U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection commits to 
the acquisition of such devices. 
Mr. YOUNG. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 2 minutes of debate equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, in Feb-
ruary, I met with the President of the 
United States along with nine of my 
colleagues. The objective here was to 
find middle ground on a targeted 
COVID relief package focused on vac-
cine distribution and getting Ameri-
cans back to work and back to school 
as quickly as possible. Instead, we have 
been offered a bloated and wasteful 
spending bill, only 10 percent of which 
actually goes toward COVID-related 
needs. 
Meanwhile, the COVID–19 crisis has 
exacerbated America’s drug epidemic 
with synthetic opioids being the pri-
mary driver of the 38-percent annual 
increase in overdose deaths. 
We know illegal narcotics are coming 
through our southern border at ports of

entry. My unobjectionable amendment 
simply increases funding for Customs 
and Border Protection by $300 million 
for technology to detect fentanyl and 
other drugs of lower purity levels. 
This funding is more than offset by 
reducing funding from a provision 
granting 600 hours of paid leave to Fed-
eral employees—600 hours. That is 15 
weeks of paid leave. So if an employee 
took every day of this paid leave in 
this bloated spending bill starting 
today, that would be by June 18. Oh, by 
the way, we are supposed to all be vac-
cinated by the end of May, according to 
the President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
share my colleague’s interest in sup-
porting the men and women at Cus-
toms and Border Protection, but this 
amendment does the opposite. In fact, 
what it does is strip them of critical 
emergency support to them and other 
frontline Federal employees who are 
working to protect our country. In 
fact, 8,000 of the Federal employees at 
CBP have tested positive for COVID–19. 
Twenty-seven have died. 
Your amendment would strip away 
emergency medical leave for these men 
and women who are protecting us while 
keeping the provisions in the bill that 
provide a 100-percent tax credit to pri-
vate employers to provide up to $511 a 
day in sick leave, a provision I support. 
So here you are targeting the men 
and women who are protecting our 
country at the border and other places 
by stripping them of their ability to 
take sick leave and keeping in the pro-
vision that allows our private sector 
neighbors to provide sick leave. This is, 
unfortunately, just aimed at under-
mining the folks who are helping pro-
tect this country on the frontline. I 
ask my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment. 
Mr. YOUNG. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 30 seconds to respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG. Only in Washington, DC, 
and in the greater Washington, DC, 
area does it make sense to offer paid 
leave in a $1.9 trillion spending bill at 
5:15 a.m. in the morning to last until 
after a pandemic is projected to be 
over. How wasteful could we be with 
our constituent spending? 
Vote for my amendment.

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I just want to

among their colleagues around the 
country.

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I have a 
motion to commit at the desk, and I 
ask that it be reported. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. CAP-
ITO] moves to commit the bill, H.R. 1319, to 
the Committee on Finance with instructions. 
The motion to commit is as follows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mrs. Capito moves to commit the bill, H.R. 
1319, to the Committee on Finance with in-
structions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) in order to fix and enhance our Nation’s 
infrastructure, create jobs, and help our 
economy recover from the COVID–19 pan-
demic, reduce the amounts appropriated for 
the Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund 
and the Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery 
Fund and dedicate such amounts to pay for 
bipartisan surface transportation reauthor-
ization legislation. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, one of 
our top priorities will be the surface 
transportation reauthorization bill. 
Our EPW Committee has already 
kicked off bipartisan efforts to meet 
our 
Nation’s 
transportation 
needs. 
Every State needs the certainty of a 
long-term reauthorization plan to com-
plete projects. Paying for infrastruc-
ture is a difficult challenge. A status 
quo reauthorization bill would require 
at least $70 billion in new funding for 
the highway trust fund, which we all 
know falls short, and we all want to 
make sure that we make robust invest-
ments in our roads and bridges. 
The bill on the floor provides $350 bil-
lion to State and local on top of the 
$150 billion that was provided in the 
CARES Act. This motion instructs the 
Finance Committee to divert some of 
that $350 billion to, instead, help pay 
forward for a bipartisan surface trans-
portation reauthorization bill. Funds 
would still go to our States and local-
ities, but the dollars would be better 
spent on road and bridge projects that 
create a safer and more efficient trans-
portation system. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
motion to commit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to speak 
in opposition, the Capito motion to 
commit the bill to the Finance Com-
mittee instructs the committee to do 
two things. The first is to dedicate 
funds to pay for bipartisan transpor-
tation legislation. The other is to cut 
the funding currently provided in our 
bill to provide relief to State and local 
governments. 
I would like to say that the reason 
we oppose this is that this, colleagues, 
is a false choice. If we are talking 
about major legislation to improve our 
infrastructure, 
including 
roads, 
bridges, airports, broadband, and more, 
count us in. In fact, I think one of the 
first areas we ought to be focusing on, 
if we finish this bill, is infrastructure, 
but this does not have to be at the ex-
pense of relief to State and local gov-
ernments. These two are not mutually 
exclusive, colleagues. We can do both. 
We can address infrastructure and help 
our State and local governments that 
have been hammered by COVID and a 
struggling economy. They have had to 
lay off police, teachers, EMTs, and 
many others. 
I urge opposition to the Capito mo-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

AMENDMENT NO. 1395 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I call up my amendment No. 1395, and 
ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1395 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To fund the procurement of HC– 
130J aircraft by the Coast Guard, and to 
provide an offset by striking National Rail-
road Passenger Corporation grant funding 
for the Northeast Corridor) 
Strike section 7101 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 7101. GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD 
PASSENGER CORPORATION. 
(a) NATIONAL NETWORK APPROPRIATION.—In 
addition to amounts otherwise available, 
there is appropriated for fiscal year 2021, out 
of any money in the Treasury not otherwise 
appropriated, $729,611,840, to remain avail-
able until September 30, 2024, for grants as 
authorized under section 11101(b) of the 
FAST Act (Public Law 114–94) to prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to coronavirus. 
(b) LONG-DISTANCE
SERVICE
RESTORATION 
AND
EMPLOYEE
RECALLS.—Not less than 
$165,926,000 of the amounts made available 
under subsection (a) shall be for use by the 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation 
to— 
(1) restore, not later than 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the frequency 
of rail service on long-distance routes (as de-
fined in section 24102 of title 49, United 
States Code) that the National Railroad Pas-
senger Corporation reduced the frequency of 
on or after July 1, 2020, and continue to oper-
ate such service at such frequency; and 
(2) recall and manage employees fur-
loughed on or after October 1, 2020, as a re-
sult of efforts to prevent, prepare for, and re-
spond to coronavirus. 
(c) USE OF FUNDS FOR STATE PAYMENTS FOR 
STATE-SUPPORTED ROUTES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Of the amounts made 
available under subsection (a), $174,850,000 
shall be for use by the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation to offset amounts re-
quired to be paid by States for covered 
State-supported routes. 
(2) FUNDING SHARE.—The share of funding 
provided under paragraph (1) with respect to 
a covered State-supported route shall be dis-
tributed as follows: 
(A) Each covered State-supported route 
shall receive 7 percent of the costs allocated 
to the route in fiscal year 2019 under the cost 
allocation methodology adopted pursuant to 
section 209 of the Passenger Rail Investment 
and Improvement Act of 2008 (Public Law 
110–432). 
(B) Any remaining amounts after the dis-
tribution described in subparagraph (A) shall 
be apportioned to each covered State-sup-
ported route in proportion to the passenger 
revenue of such route and other revenue allo-
cated to such route in fiscal year 2019 divided 
by the total passenger revenue and other 
revenue allocated to all covered State-sup-
ported routes in fiscal year 2019. 
(3) COVERED
STATE-SUPPORTED
ROUTE
DE-
FINED.—In this subsection, the term ‘‘cov-
ered State-supported route’’ means a State- 
supported route, as such term is defined in 
section 24102 of title 49, United States Code, 
but does not include a State-supported route 
for which service was terminated on or be-
fore February 1, 2020. 
(d) USE OF FUNDS FOR DEBT REPAYMENT OR 
PREPAYMENT.—Not more than $100,885,000 of 
the amounts made available under sub-

ments entered into prior to the date of en-
actment of this Act; and 
(2) to pay required reserves, costs, and fees 
related to such debt, including for loans from 
the Department of Transportation and loans 
that would otherwise have been paid from 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation 
revenues. 
(e) PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT.—Not 
more than $2,000,000 of the amounts made 
available under subsection (a) shall be for ac-
tivities authorized under section 11101(c) of 
the FAST Act (Public Law 114–94). 
SEC. 7101A. COAST GUARD PROCUREMENT OF 
HC–130J AIRCRAFT. 
In addition to amounts otherwise avail-
able, there is appropriated to the Secretary 
of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2021, 
out of any money in the Treasury not other-
wise appropriated, $970,388,160, to remain 
available until September 30, 2024, for the 
procurement of HC–130J aircraft for the 
Coast Guard. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes 
of debate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
there is no reason this bill should in-
clude funding for Amtrak’s Northeast 
Corridor, a woefully mismanaged pub-
lic railway system that benefits very 
few Americans. 
My amendment redirects this waste-
ful spending to strengthen many of the 
core missions of our military. For the 
U.S. Coast Guard, that includes search 
and rescue, drug and migrant interdic-
tion, cargo and personnel transport, 
and maritime stewardship. American 
taxpayer dollars are better spent to 
support this mission and improve the 
defense and security of this Nation 
than to prop up wasteful and mis-
managed transportation systems in 
New Jersey, New York, and Massachu-
setts. 
My amendment directs nearly $1 bil-
lion to the Coast Guard’s Super Her-
cules program to continue their pro-
curement of HC–130Js, a top-of-class 
long range surveillance aircraft which 
will strengthen our national defense 
and border security. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of this 
amendment. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Wash-
ington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the 
sun is coming up in Washington, DC, 
and we have to spend all night debating 
policy and questions to arrive at this 
moment, at 6 a.m., with an amendment 
that is literally robbing Peter to pay 
Paul. This isn’t the idea of a debate. 
The Amtrak and North Corridor Sys-
tem has basically had to reallocate re-
sources. The 457 Corridor, which is one 
of the busiest in the Nation, has over 
750,000 people on that system, but be-
cause of COVID, it has lost revenue. It 
has a 97-percent loss of revenue, and 
now they are making drastic cuts to 
employees and to services that could 
become permanent. 
This simply helps Amtrak and our 
busiest corridor stay in business. We 
will address the Coast Guard needs in 
other legislation. I ask my colleagues 
to vote no. Stop robbing Peter to pay 
Paul. Let’s fix the COVID crisis on our 
transportation system. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1395

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I have a 
motion to commit at the desk, and I 
ask that it be reported. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. COTTON]

The motion is as follows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Cotton moves to commit the bill H.R. 
1319 to the Committee on Finance with in-
structions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) reduce spending by prohibiting any pay-
ment of funds under Coronavirus State and 
Local Fiscal Recovery Funds under title VI 
of the Social Security Act, as amended by 
section 9901 of the bill, to any State or sub-
division thereof that prohibits its employees 
or contractors from— 
(A) sharing law enforcement information 
with the Department of Homeland Security; 
or 
(B) cooperating with lawful requests from 
the Department of Homeland Security to 
hold an individual pending arrest for any 
violation of Federal law. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, my mo-
tion to commit is to send this bill back 
to the Finance Committee to adopt the 
commonsense rule that should have 
been in there from the beginning that 
we are not going to give bailout money 
to sanctuary States and sanctuary cit-
ies. 
Now, to whom are the States and cit-
ies giving sanctuary? Criminal illegal 
aliens. Where is the sanctuary for their 
victims? Why should cities and States 
that refuse to cooperate with Federal 
law enforcement receive Federal bail-
outs? They should not. 
I reserve my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let’s 
face reality. The immigration law sys-
tem in America is broken. If we are 
going to get behind slogans and bumper 
stickers and do something about the 
problems we face in America, we have 
to talk about comprehensive immigra-
tion reform. 
The amendment being offered by the 
Senator from Arkansas brings back an-
other one of the old arguments about 
sanctuary cities. 
Let me tell you what the police chief, 
Art Acevedo of Houston, had to say be-
fore the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
If we are to be tough on crime, we must 
not forget that it begins with trust and co-
operation in our communities. 
He went on to say: 
[I]f we want to be effective and work to 
disrupt the drug cartels, we cannot afford to 
alienate broad spectrums of our community. 
Asking local law enforcement officers to be-
come involved in immigration enforcement 
is counterproductive. 
Vote no on the Cotton amendment. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. The immigration sys-
tem is broken because the Democratic 
Party will not enforce our borders. You 
see that with the Biden border crisis 
right now. We can fix one small part of 
it by stopping Federal bailout dollars 
from going to cities and States that 
refuse to cooperate with Federal law 
enforcement.

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MORAN], for

numbered 1342 to amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide an effective date for the 
modification of revenue requirements for 
proprietary institutions of higher edu-
cation) 
At the end of section 2013, add the fol-
lowing: 
(c) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made under this section shall— 
(1) be subject to the master calendar re-
quirements under section 482 of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1089) and the 
public involvement and negotiated rule-
making requirements under section 492 of 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1098a), except that such negotiated rule-
making shall commence not earlier than Oc-
tober 1, 2021; and 
(2) apply to institutional fiscal years be-
ginning on or after January 1, 2023. 
Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 3 minutes of debate equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. My colleagues, I arise 
here at the request of many veterans 
service 
organizations 
and 
veterans 
across the country who have called for 
a long time for us to protect our mili-
tary and veteran students and close the 
90–10 loophole. 
What was once a partisan discussion 
is becoming a bipartisan discussion, 
and while the American Rescue Plan

S1246 
March 5, 2021 
and we need to ensure we put the pol-
icy back in the perspective of not poli-
tics but the right answer. 
I am thankful to my colleagues Sen-
ators CARPER, CASSIDY, and LANKFORD 
for putting politics aside and working 
on this amendment with me. I also 
want to thank Chairman MURRAY and 
Ranking Member BURR and their staffs, 
as well as the veteran groups and the 
stakeholders, for their help in crafting 
this amendment. 
By providing a 6-month delay before 
the start of a negotiated rulemaking 
process, Congress now has time to 
work together with our veterans serv-
ice organizations and the higher edu-
cation community on a bipartisan plan 
to deliver reasonable and needed pro-
tections for veterans and taxpayers 
alike. 
I ask my colleagues to join us in sup-
port of our bipartisan amendment and 
continue to work with us on a path for-
ward this Congress. 
I yield to the Senator from Delaware. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this 
may be the only bipartisan amendment 
that we will have the chance to vote on 
today. The really good news is that 
there will be a voice vote. 
For the past decade, our Nation’s 
veterans service organizations have 
called on Congress to protect our mili-
tary veteran students and close the 90– 
10 loophole that you have heard about. 
Today, at long last, Congress heeds 
that call by harnessing market forces 
to ensure better educational opportuni-
ties and outcomes for our millions of 
veterans. Those millions of veterans 
and veteran students use their hard- 
earned educational benefits at a vari-
ety of educational institutions in our 
States, including the types of trade and 
vocational schools that my own fa-
ther—maybe your relatives as well— 
used in World War II and Korea and 
Vietnam using the original GI bill. 
Let me be clear. Some for-profit 
schools in this country do a very good 
job working with our veterans, pre-
paring them for lives and careers. Un-
fortunately, we have seen way too 
many that do not, and what we want to 
do with this legislation is to make sure 
that the veterans are protected from 
the bad actors in the for-profit college 
sector, places like ITT Tech and Corin-
thian, places that no longer exist. 
While the American Rescue Plan 
closes the 90–10 loophole, we under-
stand the need to make sure we get 
this right. I am grateful to our col-
leagues, for JERRY
MORAN, and am 
proud to be joining him, along with 
Senators CASSIDY and LANKFORD, in the 
thoughtful, bipartisan approach to a 
contentious issue. 
By providing a 6-month delay before 
the start of the negotiated rulemaking 
process, our amendment gives Congress 
time to work together with our vet-
erans service organizations on a bipar-
tisan plan to strengthen these protec-
tions for our veterans and taxpayers. 
We invite you all to join us in sup-
porting this amendment. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, while the 
Senator from Delaware stole my thun-
der, I believe this amendment can pass 
by voice vote, and I would add the re-
quest that all of the amendments that 
follow this follow the same precedent. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1342 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment (No. 1342) was agreed 
to. 
(Applause.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from Tennessee. 
AMENDMENT NO. 996 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I call up my amendment No. 996 
and ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Tennessee [Mrs. BLACK-
BURN], for herself and others, proposes an 
amendment numbered 996 to amendment No. 
891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike section 9831) 
Strike section 9831. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent for 4 
minutes of debate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this amendment strikes an unfair 
hospital wage index earmark that 
would benefit just three States: Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, and Delaware. It 
would give preferential treatment to 
them for the consideration of the area 
wage index. 
The benefit comes at the expense of 
poor Americans that are living in rural 
areas and make the payout disparities 
between rural and urban hospitals 
worse than they already are. If you 
have rural hospitals in your State and 
you vote against this amendment, 
what you are doing is taking money 
from those hospitals; you are making 
these disparities worse. 
It is a multibillion dollar earmark. 
Get that, a multibillion dollar ear-
mark. It has nothing to do with COVID 
relief and does not belong in this bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask for 1 minute of the 2 minutes. 
This provision is providing funda-
mental fairness so that hospitals in 
every State of this country have the 
resources they need to hire the best, 
most qualified providers. 
Years ago, CMS came up with an ar-
bitrary formula that excluded a series 
of States from a payment policy that 
intended to benefit all hospitals so we 
are not competing for labor unfairly. A 
bipartisan policy that began under 
President Bush continued through mul-
tiple administrations until the Trump 
administration ended it without jus-
tification. 
Making matters worse, our States 
were at the epicenter of the COVID cri-
sis. This provision would simply pro-
vide parity, and it would do so, unlike 
what the Senator is saying, without de-
creasing payments for any other State. 
This is the fairest way to provide 
parity that our States need and to be 
able to deal with the challenges of get-
ting people at a time in which we need 
them the most. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, for 1 minute. 
Madam 
President, 
knowing 
how 
much my colleagues on the other side 
love unelected bureaucrats, I want to 
make sure it is clear that this was a 
unilateral 
decision 
made 
by 
an 
unelected bureaucrat to change the 
way hospitals are compensated. And 
the result, at least in my State, is that 
our hospitals are paid 25 cents per dol-
lar less than the hospital right across 
the border in Massachusetts and 30 
cents per dollar less than the hospital 
right across the border 20 minutes 
down the road in Connecticut. 
Dr. BARRASSO and Dr. CASSIDY can 
understand that a 25-percent hit in hos-
pitals that close together, a 30-percent 
hit between hospitals that close to-
gether, is ridiculous. 
And my friends on the Finance Com-
mittee will remember me showing this 
graph to every Health and Human 
Services witness who showed up. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And none could 
defend it. I ask your support on this. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, to respond to this, I think what 
you just heard from my colleague from 
Rhode Island is what happens with too 
much government interference into 
healthcare. That is what he is com-
plaining about, as we have been up all 
night long working on this bill. There 
is nothing that makes New Jersey, 
Rhode Island, and Delaware more spe-
cial than the other States in this coun-
try. 
If you have rural hospitals, if you 
have—if you vote no on this amend-
ment, you are making the disparities 
worse. And I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the amendment. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask for 15 additional seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. And there is noth-
ing that makes any other State in this 
country more special than our States. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 996 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
have a parliamentary inquiry before I 
begin. 
Parliamentary inquiry: On page 225, 
line 23, it appears that the 7(b) disaster 
loan program allocates $460 million, 
but only $70 million is for the actual 
disaster loans. The other $390 million 
appears to be allocated for administra-
tive costs of the program. 
Could the clerk please read page 225 
line 20 through page 226 line 2 to con-
firm the administrative cost for this 
program is $390 million and the grant 
program itself is only $70 million? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the section of the 
amendment. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
(2) $460,000,000 to carry out the disaster 
loan program authorized by section 7(b) of 
the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)), of 
which $70,000,000 shall be for the cost of di-
rect loans authorized by such section and 
$390,000,000 shall be for administrative ex-
penses to carry out such program. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1031 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
Mr. LANKFORD. I call up my amend-
ment No. 1031 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Oklahoma 
[Mr. 
LANKFORD], for himself and Mr. DAINES, pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1031 to 
amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. LANKFORD. I ask unanimous 
consent for 3 minutes of debate equally 
divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
millions of Americans see a sonogram, 
and they see a child. They count 10 fin-
gers. They count 10 toes. They watch 
that little girl in the womb suck her 
thumb. They see a child. 
Science notes that the DNA of that 
child in the womb is different than the 
DNA of the mom and different than the 
DNA of the dad. It is both confirmed by 
science that is a baby, and it is self-evi-
dent by just looking at her in the 
womb, that is a child. Millions of 
Americans see that. 
Because we have such a divide in this 
Nation where some people see every 
child as valuable and some people see 
only some children as valuable, be-
cause we have had that divide that is 
unresolved in our Nation, we have, for 
decades, in every appropriations bill, 
had the Hyde Amendment, that did not 
force Americans to have to pay for 
abortion procedures for the death of 
children. We have also had that in all 
five COVID bills that we have agreed 
together on in the last 12 months. 
In this partisan bill, mysteriously, 
the Hyde Amendment disappeared and 
suddenly, now, for the first time, 
Americans who profoundly believe that 
children are of great value and should 
be protected will be compelled with our 
tax dollars to pay for the destruction 
of life. 
This simple statement is that we 
should maintain Hyde protections in 
this bill as we have in the previous five 
COVID bills. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it 
is frustrating, but not at all surprising, 
that in the middle of a pandemic, as we 
are working to get urgently needed re-
lief to our families, to our small busi-
nesses, and to our communities across 
the country, some Republicans would 
rather spend time launching political 
attacks on reproductive health. 
That is exactly what this amendment 
is—an effort to expand restrictions on 
abortion that already make it harder 
for women who have low incomes, who 
are often women of color, to exercise 
their constitutionally guaranteed right 
to make their own healthcare choices. 
I oppose this amendment because it 
is completely unnecessary. It is a 
harmful attempt to distract us from 
the work that we are on tonight. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Madam President, I raise a point of 
order that the pending amendment pro-
duces 
budgetary 
changes 
that 
are 
merely incidental to the non-budgetary 
components of the amendment, and it 
therefore violates section 313(b)1(d) of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in the middle of a pandemic, we 
shouldn’t be dealing with abortion 
funding. So, I would say, pursuant to 
section 904 of the Congressional Budget 
Act, I move to waive. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO WAIVE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the motion. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1248 
March 5, 2021 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 969 to amend-
ment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide children with an option 
for in-classroom education instruction if 
the child’s local public school does not 
commit to re-opening to 5-day-a-week, in- 
classroom instruction for the remainder of 
the current school year and the 2021-2022 
school year) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. STATE DIRECT FAMILY GRANT PRO-
GRAM. 
(a) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of this title, not later than 7 
days after the date of enactment of this 
title, each school that is eligible to receive 
grant funding under section 2001 shall submit 
to their respective State Secretary of Edu-
cation, or equivalent State official, a plan to 
re-open and resume regular, full-time, 5-day- 
a-week in-classroom instruction with teach-
ers and faculty physically present for the re-
mainder of the 2020-2021 and for the 2021-2022 
school year in such a manner that meets or 
exceeds the plan for in-classroom instruction 
that was in effect for that school at the start 
of the 2019-2020 school year. 
(b) DIRECT EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FUND.— 
Each State shall establish a State-controlled 
Direct Education Assistance Fund. In the 
event that a school fails to timely submit a 
re-opening plan in accordance with sub-
section (a), the State shall withhold all 
grant funds that would have been provided to 
such school under section 2001, depositing 
such amount into the Direct Education As-
sistance Fund. The State shall administer 
the Direct Education Assistance Fund, using 
the monies deposited therein, to establish 
and operate a grant program to assist fami-
lies with educational costs in order to pro-
vide students with access to alternative edu-
cation for the 2021-2022 school year. The 
State Department of Education shall operate 
the grant program as follows: 
(1) The Department shall establish an ap-
plication process that allows parents to 
apply for an education grant from the 
State’s Direct Education Assistance Fund as 
follows: 
(A) Awards grants from available funds in 
a manner that prioritizes children— 
(i) from schools that have not submitted a 
re-opening plan as required by this section; 
(ii) who are special needs students; 
(iii) who are suffering from depression or a 
similar condition or at risk of suicide due to 
COVID–19-related isolation; or 
(iv) who have a parent (or parents) or 
guardian (or guardians) who work outside of 
the home during regular school hours and 
are not available to assist the child with vir-
tual learning. 
(B) Includes, as part of the application 
form, the opportunity for the parent or 
guardian to submit an education plan for the 
child that— 
(i) as part of an application for a grant for 
direct education assistance, includes the pro-
posed school, if any, that the parent or 
guardian has selected for the child and the 
cost of any fees associated with the applica-
tion, enrollment, or attendance at such 
school; or 
(ii) as part of an application for a grant for 
supplemental education assistance a list of 
any costs which the parent or guardian an-
ticipates will be incurred to purchase items 
listed in paragraph (5)(B). 
(2) The Department shall publicize the 
availability of direct education assistance to 
parents across the State with an application 
period of not less than 45 days and a deadline 
for applications as of a date not later than 
July 1, 2021. 
(3) The Department shall first prioritize 
eligibility for grants awarded from available 
funds to the parents or guardians of children 
between the ages of 5 and 18 who are eligible 
to attend a school that failed to timely sub-
mit a re-opening plan as described herein 
and, if funds remain available in the Direct 
Education Assistance Fund after each pri-
ority student has received a grant, the De-
partment shall make grants from the Fund 
available to the parent or guardians applying 
on behalf of students from other elementary 
and secondary schools in the State. 
(4) The Department shall only award a 
grant to an individual who is the legal par-
ent or guardian of an eligible child provided 
that such individual is also a citizen or na-
tional of the United States or an alien (as de-
fined in section 101(a) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) who is 
lawfully present in the United States. 
(5) The Department will administer the Di-
rect Education Assistance Fund as follows: 
(A) 75 percent of such Fund shall be set 
aside and used to award direct education as-
sistance grants to finance all or a portion of 
the educational costs of a child to attend a 
different school as selected by that child’s 
parent or guardian in an amount not to ex-
ceed $10,000 per grant award. 
(B) 25 percent of such Fund shall be set 
aside and used to award supplemental edu-
cation assistance grants to cover a portion of 
the costs for education such as tutoring serv-
ices, educational classes, or curriculum in-
side or outside of the home, books, instruc-
tional materials, online educational mate-
rials, educational therapies, including edu-
cational therapies and services for students 
with disabilities, and such other educational 
and instructional materials as the child’s 
parent or guardian determines is beneficial 
in-relation to at-home learning, including 
online or virtual schooling or home instruc-
tion. 
(6) All grants shall be awarded not later 
than August 15, 2021. 
(7) The Department shall require that any 
parent or guardian who receives a grant pur-
suant to this section maintain records of 
how any grant funds were spent. 
(8) Grants awarded out of the Fund for di-
rect education assistance shall be distributed 
in an equitable manner among recipients for 
such grants consistent with the priorities 
identified in this section but in an amount 
not to exceed the educational costs identi-
fied within an application and grants award-
ed out of the Fund for supplemental edu-
cation assistance shall be made in an equi-
table manner among recipients for such 
grants in an amount not to exceed the costs 
identified in such application. 
(c) PROHIBITION OF CONTROL OVER NON-PUB-
LIC EDUCATION PROVIDERS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to permit, allow, encour-
age, or authorize any Federal control over 
any aspect of any private, religious, or home 
education provider, whether or not a home 
education provider is treated as a private 
school or home school under State law. 
(2) NO DISCRIMINATION.—No State shall ex-
clude, discriminate against, or otherwise dis-
advantage any education provider, including 
home education provider, with respect to 
programs or services under this section 
based in whole or in part on the provider’s 
religious character or affiliation, including 
religiously based or mission-based policies or 
practices. 
(d) PARENTAL RIGHTS TO USE GRANTS.—No 
State shall disfavor or discourage the use of 
qualifying grants for the purchase of elemen-
tary and secondary education services, in-
cluding those services provided by private or 
nonprofit entities, such as faith-based pro-
viders. 
(e) REPAYMENT.—If a school does not re- 
open and maintain operations consistent 
with the plan submitted under this section, 
the school shall be required to repay all 
monies received under section 2001 to the 
State. 
(f) RETURN TO TREASURY.—Any monies re-
maining in the Fund as of September 30, 2021, 
or if subsequently repaid under subsection 
(e), shall be repaid to the United States 
Treasury not later than June 30, 2022. 
At the end of section 2001(c), add the fol-
lowing: ‘‘An allocation to a State shall be 
made pursuant to the previous sentence only 
if the State has publicly published, by not 
later than 7 days after enactment of this 
Act, a written plan that guarantees each 
child in the State has a local public school 
education option to resume regular, 5-day-a- 
week in-classroom instruction with teachers 
physically present and that identifies by 
name and location which schools will be 
available for regular in-classroom instruc-
tion. Assistance from a grant awarded to a 
State under this section shall only be pro-
vided to a school identified by the State 
under the previous sentence.’’. 
Mr. CRUZ. I ask unanimous consent 
for 2 minutes of debate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, we are 
facing an absolute crisis with our 
schools. Today, only 40 percent of 
school kids in America are attending 
in-person school 5 days a week. 
It has been a year since these COVID 
lockdowns began. Millions of school 
kids are falling behind, and it is falling 
disproportionately on low-income kids, 
on African-American kids, on Hispanic 
kids. 
This bill spends billions of dollars on 
schools and doesn’t require that they 
open. My amendment does something 
very simple. It says if a school is open, 
it gets the new money that is in this 
bill, but if the school is not open 5 days 
a week, then that money goes to the 
parents, up to $10,000 per child, so they 
can get their kids an education. 
We have single moms with kids 
trapped in schools that are not open, 
and this crisis, this body can do some-
thing about. Those kids, if they fall be-
hind, the science and the data tells us 
that they will be behind, potentially, 
for the rest of their lives. We should 
come together in a bipartisan way to 
say: We are going to open the schools, 
and we are going to give hope and relief 
to the kids who are being left behind. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
this is yet another amendment that 
conditions 
funding 
to 
our 
public 
schools under the guise of wanting in- 
person learning, when in reality with-
holding this funding is counter to ev-
eryone’s goal. 
But this amendment goes a step fur-
ther. It strips much needed funds from 
our public schools that want to reopen 
for in-person learning and implement 
safety protocols that are aligned with 
local public health guidance in order to 
create a voucher program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1249 
March 5, 2021 
That is right. This amendment takes 
money from public schools that serve 
90 percent of our students and sends 
those funds to private schools. It is un-
clear to me if our colleague’s goals are 
really about reopening public schools 
or just about advancing long-term ide-
ological goals. 
If we only provide funding to schools 
that are physically open, schools in 
communities with high transmission 
rates of COVID–19 will not receive the 
resources necessary to implement safe-
ty health protocols. Conditioning funds 
undermines our ability to actually get 
our students back into the classroom. 
Let’s stop wasting time and pass the 
American Rescue Plan so those re-
sources can get to our schools and our 
students.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
good morning. 
Now, it looks like we have about 14 
amendments left, and 1 or 2 of those 
may be voice-voted. So I would ask 
that we all stay in our seats so we can 
expedite the process. I would ask that 
we try to accomplish these votes in no 
more than 10 minutes so that we can 
move forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1364 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To provide relief for State and 
local governments based on demonstrated 
need) 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment 1364 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. ROMNEY] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1364 to 
amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes 
of debate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
actually believe that we make better 
legislation if we have two parties work 
together on something. 
In this case, we have crafted a piece 
of legislation that our party hasn’t had 
any involvement in whatsoever. We 
tried. We went to the White House, and 
the President was very gracious in wel-
coming us and listening to us but did 
not accept any of our proposals. So we 
have before us today a piece of legisla-
tion that has the benefit of only one 
party. 
There are some errors in that and 
some things I think we really have to 
look at and try to fix. One of them is 
with regard to States and localities. 
At the time the President put his bill 
out there, there was an assumption 
that States have massive losses associ-
ated with the COVID experience. But 
the data that has come out since then 
has shown that, in fact, the States did 
not have those kinds of losses. Many 
States did not. Twenty-one States are 
seeing a rise in revenue. States like 
Florida don’t need more money. Okla-
homa doesn’t need more money. My 
State of Utah doesn’t need more 
money. California has record surpluses, 
billions of dollars in surplus. Yet, 
under this legislation, California itself 
at the State level gets $26 billion more 
and in total with its localities gets $41 
billion. This is on top of their already 
surplus year. 
Think about that. We are going to be 
asking the American people to allow us 
to borrow money from China and oth-
ers, pass that on to our kids and 
grandkids so that we can send money 
to States like California and mine and 
others that don’t need the money. 
This doesn’t make any sense at all. 
So my amendment does a very simple 
thing. It says: Look, you can spend all 
the money that the President’s plan 
suggests and the way they suggest it, 
but each State’s amount is limited by 
the amount of their revenue loss— 
meaning the gap they had from 2019 to 
2020 and then 2021—as well as any 
COVID expenses, as well as any Med-
icaid expenses that grew. So just limit 
it by how much they need it. That is 
all it does. 
So I ask that people on both sides of 
the aisle just get behind this so that we 
can save probably at least $100 billion, 
to keep money from going to States 
and localities that don’t actually need 
it. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise 
in opposition to the Romney amend-
ment. 
First, colleagues, this amendment 
would be a drastic cut to the relief in 
the bill. Specifically, it would limit the 
number 
of 
firefighters, 
municipal 
workers, and teachers who would actu-
ally get their jobs back in the coming 
weeks and months. 
Second, the amendment doesn’t take 
into account the full impact the pan-
demic has had on State budgets and 
the costs they are going to continue to 
incur in the months ahead. 
Our view is, this is just the wrong 
time to start hacking away at State 
and local funding because the job losses 
are stacking up. As we have heard 
again and again from independent 
economists, those losses are going to 
continue if the Senate doesn’t go big, 
as this bill does. Saving jobs and rehir-
ing laid-off workers is what this por-
tion of the bill is all about. 
So, colleagues, I would strongly urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the Romney amend-
ment. 
I yield. 
Mr. 
ROMNEY. 
Madam 
President, 
may I respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah, without objection. 
Mr. ROMNEY. First of all, those 
States that I described didn’t lay peo-
ple off. They didn’t lay off firefighters. 
They didn’t lay off teachers. They have 
held their teachers. They have held 
their firefighters. My State has actu-
ally paid bonuses to teachers and to 
State workers, they have so much 
money coming in. 
You see, COVID, the pandemic, did 
not hit all the States in the same way. 
So States that need more money, give 
them more money. I am happy to do 
that. But States like mine, Florida, 
Oklahoma, 
Texas, 
California, 
they 
don’t need more money. Why are we 
borrowing more money and sending on 
the burden of debt and interest pay-
ments to our kids and grandkids to 
send money to States that don’t need 
it? 
By the way, we are talking about 
States that don’t have deficits; they 
have surpluses. All of their COVID ex-
penses would be reimbursed under the

proposal that I make. There is no 
COVID expense that is not reimbursed. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Can I have 30 seconds to 
briefly respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. First of all, we can’t 
even really determine the formula that 
is used under the Romney amendment. 
It is clear to us there are going to be 
costs to States as a result of this legis-
lation. 
Colleagues, the reality is, the pan-
demic is a public health nightmare, 
and this provision is designed to spe-
cifically address the challenge of mak-
ing sure that firefighters, municipal 
workers, and others who are respond-
ing day in and day out at risk to them-
selves are going to be able to get their 
jobs back in the coming weeks and 
months. The fact is, this amendment is 
going to reduce the money the States 
have to address those critical needs. 
I urge colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. ROMNEY. I believe I have 10 
more seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator does not have 10 more seconds.

jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1386 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I call up my amendment No. 1386 
and ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Alabama 
[Mr. 
TUBERVILLE] proposes an amendment num-
bered 1386 to amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit funds made available 
under title II to States, local educational 
agencies, and institutions of higher edu-
cation that permit any student whose bio-
logical sex is male to participate in an ath-
letic program or activity designated for 
women or girls) 
At the end of part 1 of subtitle A of title II, 
add the following: 
SEC. 2014. RULE REGARDING ATHLETIC PRO-
GRAMS OR ACTIVITIES. 
As a condition of receiving funds under 
section 2001, 2003, or 2005, a State, local edu-
cational agency, or institution of higher edu-
cation may not permit any student whose bi-
ological sex (recognized based solely on a 
person’s reproductive biology and genetics at 
birth) is male to participate in an athletic 
program or activity that is— 
(1) administered by that State, local edu-
cational agency, or institution of higher edu-
cation, as the case may be; and 
(2) designated for women or girls. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent for 2 
minutes, evenly divided, to debate this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I started my career coaching high 
school football and girls and boys bas-
ketball 45 years ago, just a few years 
after title IX was enacted. It ensured 
young women had the same opportuni-
ties as young men and the same access 
to funding, facilities, and athletic 
scholarships. 
Title IX has given young women the 
long-denied platform that had always 
been afforded to men, and today Amer-
ica’s female athletes are routinely the 
best performing on the world stage. 
My amendment, cosponsored by Sen-
ators GRAHAM and MARSHALL, recog-
nizes title IX’s role in protecting 
women in education and in sports. 
Under this amendment, educational 
institutions would be prohibited from 
receiving funding if biological males 
are allowed to compete in women’s ath-
letics. 
This 
amendment 
safeguards 
fairness and equality for women. This 
amendment will ensure that education 
funding in the bill is properly directed 
to schools that are focused on COVID 
response and recovery rather than 
pushing a liberal agenda. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
this amendment will undermine the 
goals of this bill to provide assistance 
to all educators, all students, and fami-
lies who have struggled through this 
pandemic. It is simply an attempt to 
discriminate against transgender stu-
dents. 
All students, including transgender 
students, benefit from participating in 
sports—to challenge themselves, to im-
prove fitness, to be part of a team. Al-
lowing transgender students to partici-
pate in athletic activities consistent 
with their gender identity in no way 
disadvantages their fellow students. 
For the love of God, can’t we just 
have a little bit of heart and compas-
sion in this world for someone who 
doesn’t look or live exactly like you? 
Instead of focusing on discriminatory 
policies, we should be examining the 
real issues with gender parity in sports 
when it comes to funding and resources 
and pay equity. 
I oppose this amendment because it 
discriminates against transgender stu-
dents. It is a harmful attempt to un-
dermine our work to help students and 
families. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Madam President, I raise a point of 
order that the pending amendment pro-
duces 
budgetary 
changes 
that 
are 
merely incidental to the nonbudgetary 
components of the amendment and vio-
lates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, pursuant to section 904 of the 
Congressional Budget Act, I move to 
waive and ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be joined by a host of my 
colleagues. The motions we are pro-
posing are very simple and should at-
tract wide support. 
Senators on both sides have said this 
must be a bipartisan process, but so 
far, it isn’t. Not once did any of the 11 
Senate subcommittees with jurisdic-
tion over relevant aspects of this legis-
lation meet to consider it—not once. 
What is the purpose of the Senate’s 
system of expert committees if, as we 
consider one of the largest bills ever 
before this body, we are just going to 
act as if the committees never existed? 
We are for pandemic relief. What we 
are not for is a decade-long spending 
spree, rushed through this body, much 
of which has nothing to do with pan-
demic relief. Our motions would simply

send this legislation back to com-
mittee for 3 days so it can be reviewed 
in a bipartisan manner. These motions 
would ensure that the legislation sup-
ports proven bipartisan programs be-
fore launching new programs or spend-
ing more money on programs that are 
already flush with cash. By midweek, 
we would have bipartisan legislation 
with committee input that is targeted 
to timely pandemic relief for those in 
need. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
motions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
in strong opposition to this amend-
ment. There are some people here who 
do not understand the crises facing the 
American people. Sixty-three percent 
of our people today are living paycheck 
to paycheck. Every day that we do not 
vaccinate somebody, there is somebody 
unnecessarily dying. Our kids are not 
in school. We are suffering a mental 
health epidemic. 
This country is demanding that Con-
gress act now and stand up for the 
working families of this country. Peo-
ple are tired of obstructionism. They 
are tired of delays. They want action. 
Let’s do it. 
I yield.

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 
a motion to commit at the desk, and I 
ask that it be reported. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KENNEDY] 
moves to commit the bill, H.R. 1319, to the 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship of the Senate with instructions. 
The motion is as follows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Kennedy moves to commit the bill 
H.R. 1319 to the Committee on Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship of the Senate 
with instructions to report the same back to 
the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day 
on which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) prohibit the provision of assistance by 
the Small Business Administration to an in-
dividual convicted of a felony for actions 
during or in connection with a riot or civil 
disorder that occurred— 
(A) during the 15-year period preceding the 
date of enactment of this Act; or 
(B) on or after the date of enactment of 
this Act. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my 
amendment would prohibit the Small 
Business 
Administration 
from 
pro-
viding any assistance including, but 
not limited to, Paycheck Protection 
Program 7(a) loans or other small busi-
ness assistance to anyone who has been 
convicted during the past 15 years of a 
felony during and in connection with a 
riot, a civil disorder, or another de-
clared disaster. Without order, there 
can be no justice. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I oppose 
this motion to recommit. This moves 
us in the wrong direction. 
We have had bipartisan support rec-
ognizing that those who have been con-
victed of crime, once they paid their 
price, should be able to participate in 
our society. 
The motion to recommit would sug-
gest that someone who may have par-
ticipated in a rally while they were in 
college 15 years ago and has a perfectly 
clear record could be prevented from 
participating in the SBA programs. 
That is moving in the wrong direction. 
I hope we would have strong rejection 
of this amendment. 
Mr. President, I want to correct the 
record or at least clarify the record for 
Senator LANKFORD. He raised the point 
in regard to administrative funds being 
made available to the SBA. There was 
a small amount, $70 million, put into 
the program. That is additional funds. 
The EIDL loan program is $200 billion 
worth of loans, so it is a much larger 
program, and that was just some addi-
tional funds that were being put into 
the program. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
The Senator has 6 seconds. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a 
felony for rioting. We shouldn’t be giv-
ing them money. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO COMMIT 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion.

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1255 
March 5, 2021 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] 
moves to commit the bill H.R. 1319 to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate with in-
structions. 
The motion is as follows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Scott of Florida moves to recommit 
the bill H.R. 1319 to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs of 
the Senate with instructions to report the 
same back to the Senate in 3 days (not 
counting any day on which the Senate is not 
in session) with an amendment, within the 
jurisdiction of such committee, that with-
holds the salaries of all Members of Congress 
during any fiscal year if all 12 appropriations 
bills for a fiscal year are not passed by Con-
gress on or before September 30 of the prior 
fiscal year. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that there be 
2 minutes of debate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
as we can tell, this week, Washington 
is completely dysfunctional, and the 
unwillingness to work together has 
caused 
multiple 
government 
shut-
downs. If Members of Congress cannot 
work together to pass a budget, they 
should not be getting paid. It is pretty 
simple. If we can’t do our jobs, we 
shouldn’t get taxpayer-funded salaries. 
My no budget, no pay amendment 
simply requires Congress to meet ap-
propriations bills deadlines or forgo 
their own salaries until the job is done. 
This is a simple concept. There is no 
reason 
that 
Members 
of 
Congress 
should be held to a different standard 
than American families and businesses 
across 
the 
Nation. 
Accountability 
shouldn’t be controversial. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my 
colleague from Florida may not know 
it, but this is a budget, a $1.9 trillion 
reconciliation budget, which, in fact, 
will turn out to be the most significant 
piece of legislation for working people 
that has been passed in decades. Fi-
nally, Congress is doing its job. Unfor-
tunately, my friends on the other side 
have used delaying tactics, after delay-
ing tactics, and obstruction, obstruc-
tion, obstruction. 
The American people want action. 
They want action now. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this motion.

AMENDMENT NO. 1381 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
(Purpose: To modify the provisions relating 
to the child tax credit and to strike the 
provisions relating to dependent care as-
sistance) 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my 
amendment No. 1381 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the clerk will report the 
amendment by number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE], for 
himself and Mr. RUBIO, proposes an 
amendment numbered 1381 to amend-
ment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent for 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, there is a 
little known feature in our Tax Code 
created by the Tax Code and the way it 
interacts with our senior entitlement 
programs. It is called the parent tax 
penalty. It is very misunderstood, lit-
tle known, but very, very harmful. 
Sadly, the changes made to the child 
tax credit in the reconciliation pack-
age are not the right way forward. 
They don’t directly attempt to fix the 
parent penalty. In addition to this 
problem, the substitute changes to the 
child and dependent care tax credit 
would make the penalty on stay-at- 
home parents in our Tax Code nearly 
seven times worse. 
My amendment with Senator RUBIO 
would ensure that the child tax credit 
is targeted to refunding Americans 
their income and payroll taxes and 
turning the child and dependent care 
tax credit, which discriminates against 
stay-at-home parents, into a young 
child enhancement to provide some ad-
ditional help to parents during those 
critical first 2 years. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
Colleagues, the underlying bill has 
significant improvements in the child 
tax credit. All told, the bill cuts child 
poverty in half. But this amendment 
would set us back. True, it expands the 
child credit in some ways, but to pay 
for these expansions, it dramatically 
cuts 
back 
on 
what 
is 
known 
as 
refundability. 
Here is the problem, colleagues: 
Refundability is what helps the fami-
lies at the lower end of the income 
scale. So to expand the child tax credit 
in several ways, the Lee amendment 
reduces benefits to the working fami-
lies who need them most. 
I want to close by way of saying that 
I will be glad to work with my col-
league from Utah and the Senator from 
Florida. I would also note that the 
other Senator from Utah has been in-
terested in these issues. 
This amendment sets us back be-
cause it reduces benefits to working 
families who need them most. 
I yield back. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1381 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered.

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have a 
motion to commit at the desk, and I 
ask that it be reported. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. COR-
NYN] moves to commit the bill, H.R. 
1319, to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions of the Sen-
ate with instructions. 
The motion to commit reads as fol-
lows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Cornyn moves to commit the bill H.R. 
1319 to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions of the Senate with in-
structions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; 
(2) strike all of the funding under section 
2022 for the National Endowment for the Hu-
manities; and 
(3) provide funding to the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement of the Department of Health 
and Human Services for— 
(A) mitigation of coronavirus transmission 
risk in immigration detention facilities; 
(B) adequate bed space to allow unaccom-
panied alien children— 
(i) to remain in safe and humane custody 
until their immigration court hearings; and 
(ii) to be separated from aliens suspected 
of, charged with, or convicted of criminal of-
fenses. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
United States is facing a brewing hu-
manitarian crisis at the border. At the 
same time, we are experiencing a glob-
al pandemic. This motion will help 
make sure we are prepared. 
In January 2021, the Border Patrol re-
corded about 75,000 encounters on the 
southwest land border. That is a 60-per-
cent increase over the last year, which 
was just before the last major migrant 
surge. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is reportedly projecting that it 
will apprehend 117,000 unaccompanied 
children this year. The Department of 
Health and Human Services and the Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement are strug-
gling to maintain enough bed space to 
shelter all of these unaccompanied 
children transferred into their custody. 
It is estimated the COVID–19 restric-
tions have reduced their capacity by 
about 40 percent. 
The Biden administration has reac-
tivated a facility at Carrizo Springs, 
TX, to handle this influx of unaccom-
panied children, and press reports indi-
cate that an additional facility may be 
necessary. 
So this motion, simply put, would 
commit the bill to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions with instructions to provide ade-
quate funding for the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement to address this brewing 
humanitarian crisis. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Let’s be clear. This is 
a delay tactic intended to stop what we 
are doing here to send the bill to the 
HELP Committee. It would instruct 
the HELP Committee to remove $135 
million in critical funding that will 
help support humanities and cultural 
organizations weather the worst of this 
pandemic. 
Mr. President, the pandemic has dev-
astated our arts and cultural organiza-
tions. Our Nation’s museums, indige-
nous cultural organizations, and local 
education nonprofits are facing signifi-
cant losses in revenue, in layoffs, in 
furloughs. Our cultural organizations 
in rural and urban and suburban areas 
need these resources to continue to 
serve our communities. 
The UAC Program at the Department 
of Health and Human Services is crit-
ical for ensuring the health and welfare 
of unaccompanied children. We abso-
lutely do need to take steps to support 
this program to ensure the well-being 
of children in ORR care. But this 
amendment is merely a delay tactic to 
address the critical issues at hand re-
lated to the COVID–19 crisis. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose the motion.

Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 1162 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by

The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. CASSIDY], 
for himself and Mr. COTTON, proposes an 
amendment numbered 1162 to amendment 
No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To ensure that the 2021 Recovery 
Rebates are not provided to prisoners) 
On page 356, between lines 19 and 20, insert 
the following: 
‘‘(j) SPECIAL RULES WITH RESPECT TO PRIS-
ONERS.— 
‘‘(1) DISALLOWANCE OF CREDIT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), no credit shall be allowed under sub-
section (a) to an eligible individual who is, 
for each day during calendar year 2021, de-
scribed in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of 
section 202(x)(1)(A) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 402(x)(1)(A)). 
‘‘(B) JOINT RETURN.—In the case of eligible 
individuals filing a joint return where 1 
spouse is described in subparagraph (A), sub-
section (b)(1) shall be applied by substituting 
‘$1,400’ for ‘$2,800’. 
‘‘(2) DENIAL OF ADVANCE REFUND OR CRED-
IT.—No refund or credit shall be made or al-

vents $1,400 stimulus checks from going

have all their living and medical ex-
penses paid for by the taxpayer. They 
don’t pay taxes. They don’t contribute 
to the tax base. They can’t be unem-
ployed. In other words, inmates are not 
economically impacted by COVID, and 
inmates cannot stimulate the econ-
omy. But under this bill, Democrats 
are giving prisoners—again, sometimes 
incarcerated 
for 
heinous 
crimes—a 
$1,400 stimulus check. If we eliminate 
these, we save taxpayers $1.9 billion. 
Now, I know my Democratic col-
leagues aren’t going to agree, but this 
spending should be on real needs. Stim-
ulus checks for inmates is nontargeted, 
inappropriate, and is a total waste of 
money. I ask my colleagues to support 
the amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
amendment will cause harm to the 
families of incarcerated individuals, 
joint filers who would receive only half 
of the payment that the families are 
owed while the spouse is incarcerated. 
Given the stark racial disparities in 
our criminal justice system, this would 
cause the most harm to Black and 
Brown families and communities al-
ready harmed by mass incarceration. 
Children should not be forced to go 
hungry because a parent is incarcer-
ated. Relief payments would allow fam-
ilies to replace lost income and pay 
rent and put food on the table. 
The 
Cassidy 
amendment 
sweeps 
broadly, denying recovery of rebates 
not only to incarcerated individuals 
but also to anyone violating a condi-
tion of probation on parole, but the So-
cial Security statute that Senator CAS-
SIDY’s amendment copies from has a 
safety valve giving discretion to allow 
payments to persons because of miti-
gating circumstances. His amendment 
does not. 
I would urge my colleagues to under-
stand what we are facing with our 
criminal justice system today. We need 
to bring more justice to it and caring 
for the families of those who are incar-
cerated. 
Mr. CASSIDY. I will reply, it only 
applies to people incarcerated for a 
year. That is not true.

AMENDMENT NO. 968 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 968 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 968 to amend-
ment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To ensure that the 2021 Recovery 
Rebates are not provided to illegal immi-
grants) 
On øpage 345, strike lines 12 through 16¿ 
and insert the following: 
‘‘(2) any alien who is not lawfully present 
(as such term is used in section 36B(e)(1)), 
‘‘(3) any individual who is a dependent of 
another taxpayer for a taxable year begin-
ning in the calendar year in which the indi-
vidual’s taxable year begins, and 
‘‘(4) an estate or trust.’’. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent for 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, moments 
ago, the Democrats in this Chamber 
just voted to send $1,400 stimulus 
checks to murderers, to rapists, and 
child molesters incarcerated in prison. 
This amendment, just like the one we 
just voted on that Senator CASSIDY and 
I introduced, this amendment before us 
today provides that the stimulus check 
should not go to illegal aliens in this 
country. 
The question for the American people 
to answer is, Should your money, 
should 
taxpayer 
money 
be 
sent— 
$1,400—to every illegal alien in Amer-
ica? This amendment provides that it 
should 
not; 
that 
stimulus 
checks 
should only go to American citizens or 
to people lawfully present. 
Now, Democrats may say their lan-
guage allows for that, but they know 
that the IRS treats someone who is il-
legally present in the United States for 
31 days last year as a resident alien. So 
this corrects that and ensures that ille-
gal aliens are not eligible for taxpayer- 
funded stimulus checks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
statement of the Senator from Texas is 
just plain false—false. Let me be clear. 
Undocumented immigrants do not have 
Social Security numbers, and they do 
not qualify for stimulus relief checks, 
period. 
And just in case you didn’t notice, 
they didn’t qualify in December when 
92 of us voted for that measure, and 
they don’t qualify under the American 
Rescue Plan. Nothing has changed. 
And for you to stand up there and say 
the opposite is just to rile people up 
over something that is not true. 
Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for 
a question? 
Mr. SCHUMER. No. 
Mr. DURBIN. No. It is not true, and 
we know what is going on right now. 
They want to be able to give speeches 
and say the checks go to undocu-
mented people. In the circumstance 
where there is a parent receiving—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. DURBIN.—a check for the child, 
that is it; but no money going to un-
documented people under the American 
Rescue Plan. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, do I have 
any time remaining? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
has expired. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 968

amendment No. 1331 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 1331 to amendment 
No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To limit the expansion of premium 
assistance for households above 500 percent 
of the federal poverty line) 
Strike section 9661 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 9661. IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY BY EX-
PANDING

ASSISTANCE 
FOR CONSUMERS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 36B(b)(3)(A) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended 
by adding at the end the following new 
clause: 
‘‘(iii) TEMPORARY
PERCENTAGES
FOR

AND 2022.—In the case of a taxable year be-
ginning in 2021 or 2022—

(b) 
CONFORMING
AMENDMENT.—Section 
36B(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subparagraph: 
‘‘(E) TEMPORARY RULE FOR 2021 AND 2022.— 
In the case of a taxable year beginning in 
2021 or 2022, subparagraph (A) shall be ap-
plied by substituting ‘500 percent’ for ‘400 
percent’.’’. 
(c) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2020. 
Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent 
for 2 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Welfare for the wealthy, 
that is what we have here. Expanding 
ObamaCare and its premium tax credit 
without limit would allow families 
making up to $500,000 a year to access 
Federal subsidies for health insurance. 
My amendment would limit this expan-
sion so that no individual or family 
making more than 500 percent of the 
Federal poverty line could receive 
them. 
For a family of four, this cutoff 
would happen at around $132,000 a year. 
Any expansion of the ObamaCare pre-
mium tax credit must be temporary 
and limited. 
Look, regardless of how you feel 
about ObamaCare, regardless of how 
you feel about this expansion of it, I 
think we should all be able to agree 
that allowing those who are making 
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year 
to access this form of government as-
sistance, even in a pandemic—perhaps 
especially in a pandemic—is inappro-
priate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition. 
Colleagues, this is what this amend-
ment would do: It would deny premium 
assistance to many middle-class fami-
lies, forcing them to pay more for 
healthcare—the last thing they need in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
Now, in 2020, the average cost of 
health insurance was $17,244 for a fam-
ily of 4. That is a hefty bill to pay 
without assistance for most middle-in-
come families, especially those who 
live in higher cost areas. ACA premium 
tax credits can mean the difference be-
tween affordable health insurance and 
doing without coverage. 
I urge colleagues to oppose the Lee 
amendment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1331 
Mr. LEE. I call for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

Stat. 871; 133 Stat. 1097; 133 Stat. 2659), for 
crop losses in crop year 2020. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent for 2 minutes, equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, you 
folks on the other side of the aisle, the 
House Agriculture Committee voted 
out the bill that Senator WARNOCK suc-
cessfully defended. That same House 
Agriculture Committee voted out a bi-
partisan bill that had the support of 
Congressman FEENSTRA
of Iowa and 
Congresswoman AXNE of Iowa. 
It got out of committee, and then 
you know what? The Rules Committee 
took it out of this bill that came over 
here. So I am asking for the reconsider-
ation of that. 
This amendment does this: It makes 
farmers in Iowa that were hit by the 
derecho wind—and that is a wind that 
you don’t predict like you do a tor-
nado, and it just crops up, 150 miles 
long and 30 miles wide. It destroyed 
855,000 acres of corn, laid it flat. And if 
it was meteoric, you still couldn’t har-
vest it. So most of it was plowed under. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. My time is up al-
ready? I would like to have it consid-
ered, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, to 
my good friend—we work together on 
so many things in agriculture—let me 
first say we all saw the devastation 
caused by the storm across the Mid-
west last year. That is why we have a 
strong crop insurance program in our 
bipartisan farm bill that quickly re-
sponds when disasters strike. 
Iowa producers have already received 
nearly $600 million in crop insurance 
indemnities for damages in 2020. If crop 
insurance can’t meet the need, the 
other opportunity is to consider some-
thing in appropriations. 
It should not be here. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote because it would take away, in 
this amendment, critical funds to re-
pair our broken food supply chain; sup-
port our farmers, our food banks, our 
frontline workers, and our families in 
need. 
We know the supply chain is broken. 
This provision is going to help fix that, 
and I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Don’t 
take money away from here, which is 
so critically needed for farmers and 
ranchers. 
Thank you.

The amendment (No. 902) was re-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1154 TO AMENDMENT NO. 891 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 1154 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MORAN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1154 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To increase the availability of 
amounts for the Veterans Community Care 
program of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs) 
On page 278, beginning on line 18, strike 
‘‘not more’’ and all that follows through the 
period on line 22 and insert the following: 
‘‘not less than $5,000,000,000 shall be available 
pursuant to section 1703 of title 38, United 
States Code, for health care furnished 
through the Veterans Community Care pro-
gram in sections 1703(c)(1) and 1703(c)(5) of 
such title, and not less than $1,250,000,000 
shall be available for construction under 
chapter 81 of such title.’’ 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, amend-
ment No. 1154 is on community care 
funding within the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. The VA has estimated 
that it needs $13.4 billion for medical 
care. This bill provides $14.4 billion in 
care, but it currently limits how much 
money can be spent within that care 
for community care. So we generally 
have all the care within the VA, but 
sometimes people are referred out to 
the community, sometimes there is 
telehealth, and sometimes the care ac-
tually occurs in a VA facility. 
This would eliminate that cap of $4.4 
billion and replace it with spending up 
to $5 billion on community care, the 
amount that it is expected the VA will 
need. Again, this amendment removes 
this arbitrary funding barrier, and it 
also includes additional dollars for 
maintenance at our VA medical cen-
ters. 
I retain the balance of my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise, 
and unfortunately I have to speak 
against this amendment from my good 
friend JERRY MORAN. But here is the 
deal. If you talk to the veterans, they 
like VA care, but there are some cases 
where community care is very, very 
important for them to have, either for 
personal reasons or maybe it is because 
it is closer to where they live. So com-
munity care is also very, very impor-
tant. 
Here is the problem I have with 
Ranking Member MORAN’s amendment. 
This bill sets it at a cap of $4 billion. 
OK. They go over that, they have to 
come to us and ask for permission to 
go over that. Under this amendment, 
they can spend any amount on care, up 
to $5 billion and even more if they so 
choose, without our permission. I want 
JERRY MORAN and myself and others to 
be able to say: Hey, what are you 
spending that money on? Is it really 
being spent to the best advantage? By 
the way, that is not only for commu-
nity care; that is for VA care too. So I 
would like to leave that as a cap in-
stead of a floor. That is why I oppose 
this amendment. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the MIS-
SION Act allows for the veteran and 
the VA to make the decision where the 
care should occur.

AMENDMENT NO. 1233 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
call up amendment No. 1233 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Alaska [Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI], for herself and Mr. PORTMAN, pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1233 to 
amendment No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To use $800,000,000 of the Elemen-
tary and Secondary School Emergency Re-
lief Fund to identify and provide homeless 
children and youth with wrap-around serv-
ices in light of the challenges of COVID–19 
and other assistance) 
In section 2001(b), strike ‘‘shall make 
grants’’ and insert the following: ‘‘shall— 
(1) use $800,000,000 for the purposes of iden-
tifying homeless children and youth and pro-
viding homeless children and youth with— 
(A) wrap-around services in light of the 
challenges of COVID–19; and 
(B) assistance needed to enable homeless 
children and youth to attend school and par-
ticipate fully in school activities; and 
(2) from the remaining amounts, make 
grants 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous 
consent for 2 minutes of debate equally 
divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
this is the amendment we are waiting 
for. This is a bipartisan amendment. 
This is so bipartisan that we have al-
ready agreed to a voice vote, so listen 
carefully. Yes, thank you for that. 
Prepandemic, our public schools had 
identified about 1.5 million kids who 
experience homelessness. That is 2.7 
percent of all public school students. 
So think about what that means. That 
was prepandemic. We know that num-
ber is higher now. 
Our amendment is pretty simple 
here. We reallocate less than 1 percent 
of the funding for the Elementary and 
Secondary School Emergency Relief 
Fund to ensure that homeless youth 
and kids have the resources they need 
to get into and succeed in school. 
In Alaska and around the country, 
the COVID–19 pandemic and economic 
downturn have increased the strain on 
our families and the need for services. 
Too many of the kids have left their 
homes, been pushed out of their homes, 
sometimes many of them to escape a 
dangerous situation. They are dealing 
with the challenges of virtual learning. 
These kids are worrying about where 
to sleep at night, how they are going to 
eat dinner, if they are going to be safe. 
This amendment ensures that these 
kids, no matter the trauma and the 
challenges they face outside of the 
classroom, will have a safe place to 
sleep and access to the wraparound 
services that they need. We have a re-
sponsibility to ensure that this vulner-
able population, many of whom will be 
subject to predation, violence, or traf-
ficking, is not forgotten or left behind. 
I would like to yield to my friend and 
my colleague Senator MANCHIN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also 
proudly rise with my colleague on this 
piece of legislation. 
There is not one of us in this room 
who doesn’t have rising homelessness 
for our children in your State, not one 
of us. We are all experiencing that 
right now. We are 10,000 in the State of 
West Virginia alone. 
These are children—basically, if you 
look at it, it is estimated that there 
are one in four homeless children. That 
is about 420,000 kids who are poten-
tially unidentified and not even con-
nected with a school system, not even 
connected. They are couch surfing. It is 
horrible what is going on. 
I am so proud. This is such a bipar-
tisan piece of legislation. Less than 1 
percent, $800 million, is all we asked 
for to use for this, and everyone sup-
ported it. Thank you very much. I ap-
preciate it. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1233 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I have a 
motion to commit at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. DAINES] 
moves to commit the bill H.R. 1319 to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations with in-
structions. 
The motion is as follows: 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. Daines moves to commit the bill H.R. 
1319 to the Committee on Foreign Relations 
with instructions to report the same back to 
the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day 
on which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would support American jobs and en-
ergy security by directing a portion of the 
funds appropriated for Department of State 
Operations to be used to review and approve 
international cross border permits pursuant 
to Executive Order 13337 (69 Fed. Reg. 25299 
(May 5, 2004)), including the Keystone XL 
pipeline. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this mo-
tion to commit will send this bill back 
to the Foreign Relations Committee to 
include authorization of the Keystone 
XL Pipeline in the final bill. In fact, as 
we saw earlier this morning, the Key-
stone XL Pipeline has bipartisan sup-
port. 
Here is the difference. This morning’s 
amendment vote was a 60-vote thresh-
old. This is a simple majority. This is 
good for union jobs. It is great for our 
rural communities. It reduces emis-
sions. 
It is time to get this done. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, col-
leagues, this amendment is meant for 
one purpose and one purpose only and 
that is to kill the American Rescue 
Plan, to kill all the work that has 
brought us to this moment, to kill the 
$1,400 checks to American families that 
will help them stay in their homes and 
put food on the table, to kill the ex-
tended unemployment checks that mil-
lions are depending upon us not to let 
lapse next week, to kill the ability to 
put more vaccine in the arms of our 
families, to kill the desperate aid that 
small businesses need to stay alive, to 
kill the chance to lift 50 percent of all 
of those children in poverty into the 
sunlit plains of opportunity. 
The Senate has already expressed 
itself today on Keystone. The com-
mittee rule could not accommodate 
this referral in the timeframe offered. 
Enough is enough. It is time to defeat 
this amendment and pass the American 
Rescue Plan.

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Virginia [Mr. WARNER], 
for himself and Mr. RUBIO, propose an 
amendment numbered 1391 to amendment 
No. 891. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To extend the authority for Fed-
eral contractors to reimburse employees 
unable to perform work due to the COVID– 
19 pandemic from March 31, 2021, to Sep-
tember 30, 2021) 
At the end of title IV, add the following: 
SEC. 4015. EXTENSION OF REIMBURSEMENT AU-
THORITY FOR FEDERAL CONTRAC-
TORS. 
Section 3610 of the CARES Act (Public Law 
116–136; 134 Stat. 414) is amended by striking 
‘‘September 30, 2020’’ and inserting ‘‘Sep-
tember 30, 2021’’. 
Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that there be 2 minutes equally di-
vided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WARNER. My colleagues, I think 
this may be the last amendment. It is 
broadly bipartisan. This amendment 
simply continues provisions that were 
included in the earlier COVID relief 
packages. 
It was called section 3610, and it en-
sures that our classified government 
contracting 
workforce—a 
workforce 
that oftentimes takes many years to 
receive top-level security clearance— 
continues to be compensated through 
the balance of the fiscal year. Failure 
to do this would lose this workforce to 
private sector and other competitors 
and seriously put our national security 
at risk. 
I point out this is an independent bill 
of this nature that cleared unani-
mously earlier this week on this side of 
the aisle. 
I yield the balance of my time to 
Senator RUBIO. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. This is important to the 
intelligence community. I ask that no 
one be a fly in the ointment here. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. 
PAUL. 
Mr. 
President, 
this 
amendment is an insult to every cash-
ier at Walmart or bagger at Kroger 
who comes to work every day in per-
son. This amendment is an insult to 
every meatpacker or waiter or waitress 
who comes to work every day in per-
son. 
Supporters of this amendment care 
more about government contractors 
making $100,000 a year than they do 
about the people who serve your food. 
If food servers and grocery store clerks 
can go to work in person, I think gov-
ernment contractors can, too. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHU-
MER], proposes an amendment numbered 1398 
to amendment No. 891. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this 
amendment comes after about 24 hours 
of discussion here as a surprise because 
we are just looking at it for the first 
time. 
But there are two things that are 
very disturbing about it. One is it com-
pletely distorts workers’ compensation 
for Federal employees, which has sub-
stantially increased costs to taxpayers, 
of course. It also sets a terrible prece-
dent in terms of how workers’ comp 
works. 
Workers’ comp, of course, is for peo-
ple who are injured on the job, and you 
have to show you have been injured on 
the job. That is how it works. It is a 
basic principle for workers’ comp. 
In this case, this amendment changes 
the rules to require compensation for 
COVID–19 lost wages no matter how 
risky the Federal employees’ behavior 
might have been outside of the work-
place. In other words, no questions 
asked. If you are a Federal worker and 
you get COVID–19, you get this. 
That is not the way workers’ comp 
works. So this is a big change in work-
force policy and establishes, again, a 
dangerous new precedent in workers’ 
comp policy, generally. 
It also creates a wrong incentive— 
think about it—for the employee and 
for the employer. So we oppose this. 
For Federal workers, the statute is 
very explicit. It says: Federal workers’ 
compensation ‘‘for the disability or 
death . . . resulting from personal in-
jury sustained while in the perform-
ance of . . . duty.’’ 
Second—I ask unanimous consent for 
an additional 30 seconds. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Second, we are just 
finding out there is another $10 billion 
added through this amendment to 
State and local governments. I don’t 
know if everybody was listening when 
Senator ROMNEY gave his explanation 
during his amendment of what is hap-
pening with regard to our States, but a 
lot of our States don’t need the money. 
Some do and some don’t. And there is 
no requirements here that if you have 
got a surplus or if you otherwise don’t 
have COVID–19 expenses that you don’t 
get the money, and yet we are adding 
another $10 billion to that pot through 
this one amendment. So, of course, we 
object to this amendment, and there 
may be other stuff in there too. I hope 
everybody gets a chance to look at it 
because we have not had a chance to do 
so yet. 
But I hope we do not create the 
wrong incentives. I hope we do not cre-
ate this situation where we are sub-
stantially increasing costs to the tax-
payer through changes in workers’ 
comp and adding another $10 billion to 
a category where it has been shown, in 
many cases, not to be needed. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator’s time has expired. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of the technical amendment 
and in very strong support of the over-
all bill, the American Rescue Plan. 
Let’s be clear. This bill that we are 
completing now is the most significant 
piece of legislation that benefits work-
ing people in the modern history of 
this country. Not only are we going to 
go forward to crush this pandemic, to 
rebuild our economy, and to get our 
kids back to school safely, we are going 
to do something even more important. 
We are going to help restore faith in 
the U.S. Government among the people 
of our country. The people are hurting, 
and today we responded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All 
time has expired. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
The amendment (No. 1398) was agreed 
to. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 891, AS AMENDED 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is on agreeing to amendment 
No. 891, as amended. 
The amendment (No. 891), as amend-
ed, was agreed to. 
The amendments were ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of provisions in 
this bill that support socially disadvan-
taged farmers and ranchers. 
One-fifth of all rural Americans—10.5 
million people—are people of color. For 
Black, Native American, Hispanic and 
Latinx, and Asian American farm fami-
lies, their experience in the agricul-
tural economy is markedly different 
than their White counterparts. This 
has been particularly true when it 
comes to the interactions between 
farmers of color and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. This history of 
longstanding systemic discrimination 
against farmers of color is well docu-
mented. Congress has long recognized 
this discrimination against farmers of 
color by USDA and, through various 
mechanisms, has sought to remedy and 
alleviate systemic barriers that pre-
vented socially disadvantaged farmers 
and ranchers from fully participating 
in the American farm economy. How-
ever, those efforts have fallen short, 
and Congress is now providing addi-
tional assistance. 
Various factors have contributed to 
the historic loss of farmland owned and 
operated by farmers of color. According 
to the Economic Research Service, a 
century ago, Black farmers owned 
more than 15 million acres of agricul-
tural land and operated almost 1 mil-
lion farms. A century later, data from 
the 2017 Census of Agriculture indi-
cated that Black farmers own fewer 
than 2.9 million acres, less than a fifth 
of what they owned in 1920. A Tufts 
University 
analysis 
estimated 
the 
value of that lost farmland at more 
than $120 billion in lost opportunities. 
According to a 2019 article in the At-
lantic, ‘‘The Great Land Robbery,’’ in 
the recovery from the Great Depres-
sion, the New Deal Farm Security Ad-
ministration at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture denied loans to poor Black 
farmers that were available to their 
White neighbors. 
In 1830, the Indian Removal Act for-
malized Native American removal as a 
federally sanctioned practice, remov-
ing tens of thousands of original inhab-
itants from their traditional lands 
within existing State borders to land 
west of the Mississippi River. The re-
moval disrupted land ownership and 
tenure and reoriented traditional farm 
production techniques. The Homestead 
Act, enacted in 1862, allowed settlers to 
claim 160 acres of surveyed government 
land. Records in the National Archive 
show that land had been inhabited by 
Native Americans, but Native Ameri-
cans were not eligible to participate in 
the program. 
The California Alien Land Laws of 
1913 and 1920 denied Asian immigrants 
the opportunity to purchase farmland 
or enter into long-term lease contracts 
until a 1952 court decision held the law 
to be unconstitutional. During World 
War II, tens of thousands of first and 
second generation Japanese American 
families were forced off their farms and 
into internment camps. For perspec-
tive, an estimated half of Japanese 
Americans living in California at the 
time were involved in agriculture ac-
cording to a February 12, 2021, article 
in ‘‘Civil Eats.’’ 
Hispanic farmers have faced a par-
ticularly difficult time with discrimi-
nation at the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture because demographic informa-
tion about Hispanic farmers wasn’t 
even collected separately by the Census 
of Agriculture until 1974. According to 
USDA, the Census of Agriculture start-
ed collecting demographic information 
about minority farmers in 1900 and 
published the first record of minority 
farmers in 1920 but neglected to include 
Hispanic farmers. This lack of histor-
ical documentation has resulted in 
many Hispanic farmers being left out 
of critical farm programs and has made 
it difficult to resolve issues of discrimi-
nation and civil rights. A 2001 article in 
the Natural Resources Journal entitled

Culture in Northern New Mexico’’ 
noted additional struggles Hispanic 
farmers and ranchers have had with 
grazing issues and Federal land man-
agement, including USDA programs. 
American institutions both public 
and private have thoroughly docu-
mented this discrimination. Numerous 
reports issued since the Civil Rights 
Era in the 1960s have shown a con-
sistent pattern of discrimination, in 
particular by USDA, against Black, In-
digenous, and other farmers of color. 
Much of the following history was laid 
out by House Agriculture Committee 
Chairman DAVID SCOTT during his floor 
statement in support of the American 
Rescue Plan provisions on February 26, 
2021. 
A 1965 report by the United States Com-
mission on Civil Rights found that Federal, 
state, 
and 
local 
officials 
discriminated 
against Black farmers in agricultural pro-
grams and that this discrimination actively 
contributed to the decline in the Black own-
ership of farmland. 
In 1968, a follow up report from the 
United States Commission on Civil 
Rights found that Black farmers con-
tinued to face discrimination when 
seeking farm loans and other forms of 
assistance. 
In 1970, the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights again found that discrimination 
continued in USDA program administration. 
The 1970 report indicated that prior to 1968, 
no Black farmer had ever been elected to any 
former Agricultural Stabilization and Con-
servation Service committee at the county 
level in the South. In 1970, two out of more 
than 4,100 committee members in the South 
were Black farmers, even though there were 
58 counties in the South, where Black farm-
ers comprised a majority of the farm oper-
ator population. It is hard to view as coinci-
dence then that half a million Black-owned 
farms in the U.S. failed between 1950 and 
1975. 
In 1982, the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights issued another report on the 
rapid decline of Black-operated farms. The 
report noted that between 1970 and 1980, the 
Black farm population declined 65 percent, 
compared to a 22 percent decline in the white 
farm population. The report also documented 
numerous discrimination complaints filed 
against USDA field offices regarding the ad-
ministration of farm loan programs and 
noted that for many of these complaints, 
USDA’s Office of Equal Opportunity inves-
tigated and found equal opportunity viola-
tions at those field offices. The report con-
cluded that racial discrimination was con-
tinuing within the USDA, at USDA head-
quarters, and in the network of field offices 
that implement USDA programs. Instead of 
responding to recommendations of the re-
port, President Ronald Reagan and Agri-
culture Secretary John Block closed the Of-
fice in 1983, and it would remain closed for 
another 13 years until reopened under Presi-
dent Bill Clinton and Secretary Dan Glick-
man in 1996. 
A 1995 U.S. Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) report found that socially dis-
advantaged 
producers 
were 
significantly 
underrepresented on the county and commu-
nity committees of the former Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Spe-
cifically, the report found that while minor-
ity producers accounted for nearly 5 percent 
of the producers eligible to vote for com-
mittee members, minority producers only 
represented 2.1 percent of county committee 
members in the United States. 
In 1997, the USDA formed a Civil Rights 
Action Team to hold nationwide listening 
sessions to hear from socially disadvantaged 
and minority farmers. A report published 
after the listening sessions documented 
Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, and Amer-
ican Indian farmers who told stories of 
USDA hurting minority farmers more than 
helping them. Minority farmers described 
how their discrimination complaints were 
caught in the backlog of appeals or if suc-
cessfully appealed, were given findings of 
discrimination that were not enforced. The 
report acknowledged that discrimination in 
USDA program delivery continued to exist 
to a large degree unabated. 
Also in 1997, the USDA Office of the Inspec-
tor General (OIG) issued a report to the 
USDA Secretary that noted ‘‘a climate of 
disorder within the civil rights staff at the 
Farm Service Agency.’’ It was difficult for 
the OIG to even determine the number and 
status of civil rights complaints at the agen-
cy and department because of that climate. 
A 1998 OIG report noted the OIG had issued 
44 recent recommendations to USDA to im-
prove its civil rights complaints and improve 
relations with minority farmers and stated 
that several of those recommendations had 
yet to be implemented. 
In 1998, the USDA National Commission on 
Small Farms further described and docu-
mented the longstanding discrimination of 
USDA towards socially disadvantaged pro-
ducers. And, it observed that ‘‘discrimina-
tion has been a contributing factor in the de-
cline of Black farmers over the last several 
decades.’’ The Commission’s report also 
notes the ‘‘history of under-allocation of re-
sources to institutions that have served mi-
nority farmers,’’ the ‘‘disgraceful’’ ‘‘failure 
to elect minority farmers to positions on 
Farm Service Agency County Committees,’’ 
and more. 
During the period between 1997 and 2000, 
Black farmers, Native American farmers, 
and Hispanic farmers filed lawsuits alleging 
USDA discriminated against them on the 
basis of race in processing their farm pro-
gram applications and that USDA failed to 
investigate their complaints of discrimina-
tion. 
In 2001, a report by the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights documented the continued dis-
criminatory lending practices against minor-
ity farmers. The Commission found that 
Black farmers waited four times longer than 
white farmers for USDA farm loans. The 
Commission recommended that USDA re-
solve the backlog of civil rights complaints 
and document and alleviate discriminatory 
lending practices. However, USDA continued 
to struggle with resolving its backlog of civil 
rights complaints. 
In a 2005 audit the OIG stated in a report, 
‘‘it took 12 days longer to complete minority 
applications, delinquencies were higher for 
minority borrowers than non-minority bor-
rowers, and minority borrowers were reluc-
tant to enter into Farm Service Agency of-
fices to apply for loans.’’ 
In 2008, GAO reported that USDA’s difficul-
ties in resolving discrimination complaints 
persisted and that the USDA had not 
achieved its goal of preventing future back-
logs of discrimination complaints. 
The 2010 Jackson Lewis report provided 
over 200 recommendations to USDA on civil 
rights issues, including recommendations re-
lated to civil rights issues in USDA’s farm 
lending program and minority farmer access 
to other USDA programs. 
Recent studies and reports continue to 
document the challenges and barriers faced 
by farmers of color due to race or ethnic dis-
crimination or the legacy of such discrimi-
nation. A September 20, 2017, study in the 
Agriculture and Human Values journal de-
scribed the challenges faced by Latinx farm-
ers due to failure of agricultural agencies to 
engage in appropriate outreach or account 
for language barriers. 
Most recently in 2019, a GAO report ob-
served that despite specific preference, so-
cially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers 
had proportionately fewer Farm Service 
Agency direct and guaranteed loans than 
non-socially 
disadvantaged 
farmers 
and 
ranchers. This report found that farmers and 
ranchers of color continued to face more dif-
ficulties in obtaining farm loans and high-
lighted the historic, systemic discrimination 
against such farmers. 
The record of discriminatory conduct 
at USDA, as well as the library of stud-
ies and reports chronicling that dis-
crimination is indeed long and details 
many of the barriers between farmers 
of color and the Department that pre-
vent these farm families from access-
ing the same programs and experi-
encing the same success as their White 
counterparts. 
To address long and well-documented 
history of systemic discrimination, 
successive Congresses have worked in a 
bicameral and bipartisan manner over 
the years to authorize and oversee im-
plementation of programs at USDA. 
During the agriculture credit crisis 
in the 1980s, Congress addressed this 
well-documented systemic discrimina-
tion at USDA and began to target as-
sistance at the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture to ‘‘socially disadvantaged 
farmers or ranchers,’’ a farmer or 
rancher who has been subjected to ra-
cial or ethnic prejudice because of 
their identity as a member of a socially 
disadvantaged group without regard to 
their individual qualities. Congress 
provided support that targeted and 
prioritizes USDA resources to ensure 
farmers of color have the same oppor-
tunities as White farmers. Today, this 
support has grown to include a broad 
range of set-asides, special programs, 
and incentives for socially disadvan-
taged farmers. 
In 1987, Congress passed the Agricul-
tural Credit Act of 1987. Section 617 of 
this bill required the USDA to estab-
lish annual target participation rates, 
on a countywide basis, that would en-
sure that members of socially dis-
advantaged groups receive direct or 
guaranteed farm ownership loans. Con-
gress amended this requirement in 1996 
to ensure that USDA’s implementation 
was consistent with the holding of the 
Supreme Court in Adarand Construc-
tors, Inc. v. Federico Pena, Secretary 
of Transportation, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), 
which held that race-based actions by 
the government is within constitu-
tional constraints when it is necessary 
to further a compelling interest such 
as the ‘‘unhappy persistence of both 
the practice and lingering effects of ra-
cial discrimination against minority 
groups.’’ 
In the 1990 farm bill, Congress took 
additional steps to recognize socially 
disadvantaged farmers and ranchers 
and created a landmark new program, 
the 2501 Socially Disadvantaged Farm-
er and Rancher Outreach program,

which is designed specifically to im-
prove outreach and technical assist-
ance to farmers of color. 
In section 741 of the Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies Ap-
propriations Act, 1999 (7 U.S.C. 2279 
note), Congress took the extraordinary 
step of suspending the application of 
the then-2-year statute of limitations 
regarding Equal Credit Opportunity 
Claims. This allowed claimants in dis-
crimination suits against USDA, in-
cluding Black farmers in Pigford v. 
Glickman and Native American farm-
ers in Keepseagle v. Veneman, to cite 
at times decades-old instances of dis-
crimination to qualify for payments 
under the respective settlements. 
In the 2002 farm bill, Congress cre-
ated the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary for Civil Rights, with statutory 
authority to ensure compliance of all 
civil rights laws and incorporation of 
civil rights activities into the strategic 
planning of the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture. 
A sense of Congress in the 2008 farm 
bill stated that claims and class ac-
tions brought against USDA by so-
cially disadvantaged farmers or ranch-
ers, including Native American, His-
panic, and female farmers or ranchers, 
on racial, ethnic, or gender discrimina-
tion in farm program participation 
should be quickly and fairly resolved. 
Congress reacted to USDA’s discrimi-
natory history and provided $100 mil-
lion to help settle the Pigford discrimi-
nation claims and established a mora-
torium on acceleration and foreclosure 
proceedings by USDA against any 
farmer or rancher who filed a discrimi-
nation 
claim. 
To 
further 
support 
Pigford, Congress provided an addi-
tional $1.15 billion in funding in the 
Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to settle 
the additional claims in the Pigford II 
class action lawsuit. 
The 2014 farm bill created a perma-
nent Office of Tribal Relations under 
the Secretary of Agriculture. 
Because of the continuing and sys-
temic nature of these concerns, the 
2018 farm bill permanently funded the 
section 2501 Socially Disadvantaged 
Farmer and Rancher Outreach Pro-
gram and provided new support to ad-
dress longstanding heirs property and 
farmland ownership issues. Addition-
ally, because Congress recognized that 
discrimination is both pervasive and 
ongoing, the 2018 farm bill also re-
quired the production of several re-
ports by GAO on how both latent and 
overt discrimination manifest in agri-
culture programs, including a report 
specifically on bias-related to loan 
credit issues for farmers of color within 
the socially disadvantaged designation 
to inform Congress for future legisla-
tion. As important as Congress’s ac-
tions have been, the remedies are still 
not enough as there is still ongoing and 
pervasive discrimination leaving so-
cially disadvantaged farmers signifi-
cantly behind. 
Settlements 
resulting 
from 
the 
Pigford and Keepseagle lawsuits, along 
with Garcia v. Vilsack that focused on 
discrimination against Hispanic and 
Latinx farmers, have not provided the 
relief necessary for these farmers of 
color to participate fully in the Amer-
ican agricultural economy. For exam-
ple, the Los Angeles Times reported in 
2012 that payments made to Black 
farmers under the Pigford settlements 
were significantly eroded by State 
taxes, as well as tax debt related to for-
given USDA farm loans. In Keepseagle 
only a very small percentage of poten-
tial claimants even applied. This was 
largely due to the older age of many 
potential claimants and because they 
were difficult to contact. Claims adju-
dication simply was not effective and 
did not adequately remedy the dis-
crimination. 
Specifically in the area of farm lend-
ing, as recently as 2 years ago, two 
GAO reports showed that socially dis-
advantaged farmers and ranchers have 
more difficulty getting loans and cred-
it from USDA. These loans can help be-
ginning farmers break into the busi-
ness and help existing farmers continue 
running their operations. One of the 
GAO reports focused on the specific 
barriers of Tribal farmers accessing 
credit and the other GAO report high-
lights the systemic discrimination that 
has hindered farmers of color for gen-
erations continue today. 
Similarly, a 2019 report from the Na-
tional Young Farmers Coalition on the 
structural challenges facing farmers in 
California shows that while White re-
spondents reported that they had no 
gaps in access to resources like busi-
ness entity choice, credit lending, land 
access and lease development, mar-
keting, policy advocacy, and regu-
latory navigation; non-White respond-
ents reported significantly impaired 
access to those same resources, and Na-
tive American respondents reported re-
ceiving none of the listed resources. 
The Farm Bill Law Enterprise re-
ported that 99.4 percent of USDA’s 
Market 
Facilitation 
Program 
pay-
ments went to White farmers. Simi-
larly, 
the 
Environmental 
Working 
Group reported that nonminority farm-
ers received nearly 97 percent of the 
$9.2 billion provided through USDA’s 
first Coronavirus Food Assistance Pro-
gram in 2020. 
The 
diminished 
relationships 
be-
tween socially disadvantaged farmers 
and USDA as a result of both latent 
barriers and historic discrimination 
limits access of socially disadvantaged 
farmers to USDA’s program, making it 
more difficult or impossible for so-
cially disadvantaged farmers to par-
ticipate in USDA programs. The statis-
tics continue to bear this out: 73 per-
cent of Black farmers, when surveyed 
by the Federation of Southern Co-
operatives/Land Assistance Fund, an 
association of Black farmers and land-
owners, were not even aware of the ag-
ricultural 
aid 
provisions 
of 
the 
coronavirus rescue programs at USDA. 
Congress recognizes the longstanding 
systemic discrimination against farm-
ers of color by USDA. Despite multiple 
congressional efforts to address this 
discrimination, these efforts, taken 
mostly on a case-by case basis, have 
still not remedied the discrimination. 
Congress is now continuing to address 
this 
longstanding, 
widespread, 
and 
well-documented 
discrimination 
against socially disadvantaged farmers 
and ranchers, including systemic bar-
riers preventing socially disadvantaged 
farmers and ranchers from fully par-
ticipating in the American farm econ-
omy, in recognition that our mostly 
case-by-case efforts thus far have not 
done enough. Because of discrimination 
in USDA’s programs, particularly loan 
programs, at USDA, socially disadvan-
taged farmers and ranchers are less 
likely to have the same access to ade-
quate loan servicing and face other 
barriers in USDA programs, as their 
White counterparts. As a result, their 
loans are more likely to be in default 
or in a precarious situation. 
Sections 1005 and 1006 of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan contain narrowly tai-
lored provisions to address the dis-
crimination in credit and other pro-
grams at USDA, the effects of which 
have been magnified by the pandemic, 
as well as programmatic changes to 
support socially disadvantaged farmers 
and ranchers. The sections provide 
funding 
for 
payments 
on 
existing 
USDA direct and guaranteed loans held 
by socially disadvantaged farmers and 
ranchers. In addition, this legislation 
is providing tools and funding for pro-
grams and systemic reforms at USDA 
to undo the systemic racism that has 
prevented socially disadvantaged farm-
ers and ranchers from getting access to 
critical agricultural credit. 
The 
public 
recognition 
of 
long-
standing discrimination against so-
cially 
disadvantaged 
farmers 
and 
ranchers and the accompanying broad 
support for this work along the food 
and agriculture supply chain is over-
whelming and represents every corner 
of American food and farming. More 
than 600 farm, food, and rural organiza-
tions, businesses, equity advocates, and 
legal scholars have sent letters, docu-
ments and issued statements of sup-
port. Notably, each of these letters in-
cludes 
both 
acknowledgment 
that 
these ongoing barriers exist, and a 
great many cite staggering examples of 
the disadvantages many farmers of 
color experience, as well as why the 
provisions contained in sections 1005 
and 1006 of the American Rescue Plan 
are an appropriate remedy for these 
important producers. 
While earlier versions of this legisla-
tion included specific references to the 
longstanding discrimination within the 
Department of Agriculture, as noted in 
Chairman Scott’s February 26, 2021, 
statement for the record, the man-
ager’s amendment in the House Rules 
Committee was purely to ensure that 
these sections would meet the require-
ments of section 313 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 for consider-
ation in the U.S. Senate. Congress in-
cludes these measures to address the

longstanding and widespread systemic

against socially disadvantaged farmers

Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of sections 
1005 and 1006 of the American Rescue 
Plan Act. 
These sections provide loan forgive-
ness and other critical assistance to 
Black farmers and to other farmers 
who are members of racial or ethnic 
groups that have for many decades suf-
fered discrimination by the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture. 
According to USDA data, in 1920 in 
the United States there were nearly 1 
million Black farmers, and they rep-
resented nearly 15 percent of all farm-
ers in our country. Today, as a direct 
result of a brutal legacy of discrimina-
tion by a Federal agency, there are less 
than 50,000 Black farmers left and they 
represent less than 2 percent of all 
farmers in our country. 
It is estimated that during the past 
century, Black farmers have lost be-
tween 15 and 20 million acres of land 
and the hundreds of billions of dollars 
of generational wealth that land rep-
resented. 
The cause of the loss of so much 
Black-owned farmland and the loss of 
so many Black farmers is not a mys-
tery. Federal court decisions, the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, and the 
USDA itself have all told us that a pri-
mary cause of that loss was long stand-
ing, pervasive discrimination by the 
USDA. 
In his opinion in Pigford v. Glick-
man, Federal District Court Judge 
Paul Friedman stated clearly that 
USDA and their county commissioners 
discriminated against Black farmers 
when they denied, delayed, or other-
wise frustrated the applications of 
those Black farmers for farm loans and 
other credit and benefit programs and 
that USDA and the county commis-
sioners bear much of the responsibility 
for the dramatic decline in Black farms 
and Black-owned farmland. 
Judge Friedman wrote his decision in 
1999, but the systemic discrimination 
by USDA against Black farmers and 
other farmers of color by USDA was 
well documented beginning many dec-
ades earlier. 
A 1965 report by the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights found that Federal, 
State, and local officials discriminated 
against Black farmers in agricultural 
programs and that this discrimination 
actively contributed to the decline in 
the Black ownership of farmland. 
In 1968, a follow-up report from the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found 
that Black farmers continued to face 
discrimination 
when 
seeking 
farm 
loans and other forms of assistance. 
In 1970, the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights again found that discrimination 
continued in USDA program adminis-
tration. The 1970 report stated that 
only 2 out of more than 4,100 USDA 
county committee members in the 
South were Black farmers, even though 
there were 58 counties in the South 
where Black farmers comprised a ma-
jority of the farm operator population. 
In 1982, the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights issued another report entitled 
‘‘The Decline of Black Farming in 
America’’ which found that the pre-
vailing practice at the USDA was to 
follow local patterns of racial segrega-
tion and discrimination when providing 
assistance and that longstanding dis-
crimination in USDA programs con-
tributed to the decline in farms oper-
ated by African-American farmers. 
In 1997, the USDA formed a Civil 
Rights Action Team to hold nationwide 
listening sessions to hear from socially 
disadvantaged and minority farmers. A 
report published after the listening ses-
sions 
documented 
Black, 
Hispanic, 
Asian-American, and indigenous farm-
ers who told story after story of USDA 
hurting minority farmers more than 
helping them. This 1997 report ac-
knowledged 
that 
discrimination 
in 
USDA program delivery continued to 
exist to a large degree unabated and 
recommended 92 changes to address ra-
cial bias at the USDA. 
In 1998, the USDA National Commis-
sion on Small Farms further described 
and documented the longstanding dis-
crimination of USDA towards socially 
disadvantaged farmers. USDA stated 
that ‘‘discrimination has been a con-
tributing factor in the decline of Black 
farmers over the last several decades.’’ 
The Commission’s report also notes the 
‘‘history of under-allocation of re-
sources 
to 
institutions 
that 
have 
served minority farmers.’’ 
During the period between 1997 and 
2000, Black farmers, Native American 
farmers, and Latino/Latina farmers 
filed lawsuits alleging USDA discrimi-
nated against them on the basis of race 
in processing their farm program appli-
cations and that USDA failed to inves-
tigate their complaints of discrimina-
tion. But settlements resulting from 
these lawsuits did not provide the re-
lief necessary for these farmers of color 
to participate fully in the American 
agricultural economy. 
On March 2, 2021, a group of full-time 
professors who work in agricultural, 
food law, and related subjects wrote in 
a letter to Majority Leader SCHUMER 
and Minority Leader MCCONNELL that 
these court settlements were severely 
flawed because of the adversarial na-
ture of the settlement process and be-
cause they attempted to define the 
problem in terms of discrete incidents 
of individualized discrimination with-
out correcting the systemic problems 
that led to that discrimination. These 
professors noted that while some farm-
ers received a payment, many re-
mained indebted to the USDA, and the 
system itself remained broken. 
Mr. President, I would ask unani-
mous consent to have this letter print-
ed in the RECORD
following my re-
marks. 
In 2001, we then have a report by the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights docu-
menting the continued discriminatory 
lending 
practices 
against 
minority 
farmers. The Commission found that 
Black farmers waited four times longer 
than White farmers for USDA farm 
loans. The Commission recommended 
that USDA resolve the backlog of civil 
rights complaints and document and 
alleviate discriminatory lending prac-
tices. 
However, USDA continued to strug-
gle with resolving its backlog of civil 
rights complaints. In 2008, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office, or GAO, 
reported that USDA’s difficulties in re-
solving discrimination complaints per-
sisted and that the USDA had not 
achieved its goal of preventing future 
backlogs of discrimination complaints. 
In 2019, a GAO report observed that 
socially disadvantaged farmers and 
ranchers had proportionately less agri-
cultural credit than non-socially dis-
advantaged farmers and ranchers. This 
report found that farmers and ranchers 
of color continued to face more dif-
ficulties in obtaining farm loans and 
highlighted the historic, systemic dis-
crimination against such farmers. 
So now let’s look at where we are 
today. 
USDA spends billions of dollars each 
year to provide much needed support to 
American farmers. The Market Facili-
tation Program and Coronavirus Food 
Assistance Program are recent USDA 
programs designed to bolster the farm 
economy. In both programs the major-
ity of funds went to nonminority farm-
ers. 
For 
example, 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group reported that non-
minority farmers received nearly 97 
percent of the $9.2 billion provided by 
the USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assist-
ance Program. Additionally, the Farm 
Bill Law Enterprise reported that 99 
percent of market facilitation pay-
ments went to nonminority farmers. 
Just last week the USDA stated 
‘‘there is a lot more that needs to be 
done and accomplished at USDA to 
make programming equitable and to 
root out decades of systemic discrimi-
nation that disproportionately affects 
Black, Hispanic, Indigenous and other 
farmers of color.’’ 
Early this week Secretary of Agri-
culture Tom Vilsack recognized the re-
sidual harm that decades of discrimi-
nation have caused to farmers of color 
when he stated: ‘‘Here’s the challenge: 
We’re not only dealing with the spe-
cific issues of discrimination, but we’re 
dealing with the cumulative effect of 
that discrimination over a period of 
time.’’ 
And what is the cumulative effect of 
that discrimination over time? The cu-
mulative effect of all the past systemic 
racism and discrimination is that 
Black farmers and other farmers of 
color were in a far more precarious fi-
nancial situation before the COVID–19 
pandemic hit us, and so many of them 
have simply not been able to weather 
the storm.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1266 
March 5, 2021 
Approximately 13 percent of bor-
rowers with FSA direct loans are cur-
rently delinquent on their loans and 
could lose their farms to foreclosure. 
But for Black farmers, 35 percent of 
those with FSA direct loans are in de-
fault and could soon lose their farms. 
And it is not only Black farmers—ap-
proximately 24 percent of the FSA di-
rect loans to Hispanic, Asian-Amer-
ican, and Indigenous farmers are cur-
rently in default. What this means is 
that we are facing yet another wave of 
foreclosures and potential land loss by 
farmers of color. But the debt forgive-
ness and other assistance in the bill we 
are considering today can prevent this 
and can begin to turn the page on this 
shameful history of discrimination by 
the Federal Government. 
I want to close by giving you one spe-
cific example of the discrimination I 
have been talking about. 
Eddie and Dorothy Wise were resi-
dents of Whitakers, NC. A retired 
Green Beret, Mr. Wise’s dream was to 
own a pig farm, and so in 1991, Mr. Wise 
purchased land and started to raise 
swine. But then came the discrimina-
tory actions by USDA: failure to han-
dle his loan applications in a timely 
manner, denial of loan applications, 
change of interest rates and escalation 
of monthly notes, and other misdeeds. 
In 1997, a loan for improvements to 
the property was approved, but the re-
ceipt of the funds was delayed for 7 
months, and his 400 pigs froze to death, 
destroying his operation. Later, he dis-
covered that his original plan had been 
approved at the State level but that his 
loan officer never told him. 
In the early morning hours of Janu-
ary 20, 2016, at least 14 Federal mar-
shals descended with guns drawn on 
Eddie’s farm and forcibly escorted him 
and his wife, who was still in bed and 
suffering from a debilitating medical 
condition, out of their home and off 
their property. Forcibly evicted from 
their home and their land and forced to 
live in a cheap motel, Dorothy Wise 
died shortly thereafter. The 106-acre 
farm was sold to an adjacent White 
farmer for the miniscule price of 
$260,000, and Eddie Wise had lost the 
one thing that he had always wanted— 
to own a pig farm. 
This story is just one example of the 
discrimination that literally destroyed 
the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
Black farmers and their families over 
the last century. 
Today we have the opportunity to 
take a step towards justice for those 
families. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
sections 1005 and 1006 of the bill before 
the Senate today. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MARCH 2, 2021. 
Re 
Support 
for 
Socially 
Disadvantaged 
Farmers. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Senate Majority Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Senate Minority Leader 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
House Majority Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR LEADER SCHUMER, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCONNELL, SPEAKER PELOSI, AND MINORITY 
LEADER MCCARTHY: We write in support of 
efforts to level the playing field for socially 
disadvantaged American farmers as set forth 
in §§ 1005 and 1006 of the House-passed Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. If enacted, these sections 
will help to correct past injustices and cre-
ate new opportunities to build the diverse, 
resilient food system that we all want and 
need. 
American agriculture’s history began with 
slavery and the forced removal of tribes from 
their land. It continued with myriad abuses, 
including Jim Crow laws, the prohibition of 
minority land ownership, property laws that 
facilitated Black land loss, and deceptive 
practices to entice Hmong farmers to incur 
huge debts to build chicken houses. Each of 
these predatory practices were instituted or 
allowed by U.S. law. At every turn, govern-
ment policies have either intentionally or 
inadvertently served to advantage white 
farmers, creating the category of farmers 
recognized by Congress and the USDA for 
decades as ‘‘socially disadvantaged.’’ 
Cultural traditions in farming in America, 
long romanticized in disregard of their dis-
criminatory consequences, have further con-
tributed to inequities. Farming is built on 
relationships: handshake contracts, neigh-
bors helping neighbors, conversations at the 
local coffee shop. These relationships work 
well if you are a member of the group; if you 
are not, they serve as a persistent barrier to 
success. According to the 2017 Census of Ag-
riculture, of the 3.4 million farmers in the 
United States, 3.2 million, 95.4% are white. 
Only approximately 1.7% are American In-
dian or Alaskan Native; 1.3% are Black; and 
.6% are Asian. For most of these farmers, 
their farms are smaller, their sales are 
smaller, and each year they fall further be-
hind. 
The USDA should have served as the equal-
izer, supporting all farmers and assisting 
those in need. But most often it has not. It 
has instead reflected and perpetuated insti-
tutional racism since its inception. The 
problems experienced by the farmers it has 
disadvantaged have been repeatedly docu-
mented in government reports and investiga-
tions and in writings by scholars, journal-
ists, and others. While some tell of the dec-
ades-long pattern of discrimination, recent 
reports, including a GAO Report released 
just last week, confirm that the barriers still 
exist today, expressly affirming that socially 
disadvantaged farmers still have less access 
to credit than other agricultural businesses. 
Fair Lending, Access and Retirement Secu-
rity, 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(2021) (finding racial and income disparities 
in access to financial services, availability of 
credit, 
and 
the 
ability 
to 
accumulate 
wealth). 
Congressionally enacted farm programs 
have perpetuated and exacerbated the prob-
lem by distorting the farm economy. Federal 
farm programs reward the largest farms the 
most, providing staggering sums of money to 
large landowners who produce the program- 
favored crops. Not only are the vast majority 
of these large landowners white, the pro-
gram-favored crops are not those most often 
produced by socially disadvantaged farmers. 
These government payments distort credit, 
land, input costs, and markets by favoring 
white farmers to the disadvantage of others, 
most of whom are small or beginning farm-
ers. 
The cumulative effect of decades of un-
equal treatment by the USDA coupled with 
farm programs that favor large landowners 
continues to negatively impact the economic 
condition of beginning farmers and small 
fanning operations, creating an extra burden 
for socially disadvantaged farmers. Today, 
disadvantaged farmers generally have less 
access to credit than white farmers, less ac-
cumulated wealth, and smaller farming oper-
ations. 
Congress and the USDA acknowledged this 
racial discrimination and attempted to re-
solve it through the settlement of two land-
mark lawsuits—Pigford and Keepseagle. But 
this approach was severely flawed. These set-
tlements attempted to define the problem in 
terms of discreet incidents of individualized 
discrimination without correcting the sys-
temic problems that led to that discrimina-
tion. The adversarial nature of the settle-
ment process served to further divide. While 
some farmers received a payment, many re-
mained indebted to the government, and the 
system itself remained broken. Providing 
debt relief to disadvantaged farmers, will 
help to correct the longstanding past injus-
tice, wiping the slate clean for USDA to 
start over. Reforming the system will pro-
vide the necessary financial and educational 
infrastructure to finally give these farmers 
an opportunity to compete on an even play-
ing field. 
We depend on our food system, and farming 
is at the heart of that system. Natural disas-
ters and the COVID pandemic have revealed 
significant systemic problems, and climate 
change has and will produce additional chal-
lenges. We need strong regional food systems 
to build the resilience that is necessary for 
our very survival. We need diversity re-
flected in that network. We bemoan the 
aging of our nation’s farmers and the high 
barriers to entry for beginning and would-be 
beginning farmers. The vast majority of 
American farmers are white men over the 
age of 50. We need to open farming to its full 
potential by offering new opportunities for 
diverse farmers, thus benefiting from their 
help in creating a resilient regional food sys-
tem that is always able to meet our food se-
curity needs.

agricultural, food law, and related subjects.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, to 
most people back home in Tennessee, 
‘‘business as usual’’ here in Washington 
means a combination of partisan bick-
ering and reckless spending, usually 
after someone up high decides not to 
let a crisis go to waste. They are used 
to watching this all play out on TV, 
then looking at the receipt and seeing 
a billion dollars’ worth of earmarks 
and pork barrel spending they didn’t 
order. 
Right now, Democrats are doing 
their best to spin the scandal their 
absurb $1.9 trillion bailout bill has 
caused as ‘‘business as usual’’ but Ten-
nesseans aren’t stupid. They know the 
spin is a lie because over the past year 
they have seen what ‘‘business as 
usual’’ looks like when it comes to 
passing COVID relief funding. 
Since last March, the Senate has 
passed five separate relief laws with 
overwhelming bipartisan support, 96–1, 
90–8, 96–0, 100–0, and 92–6. 
But what happened with last month’s 
vote on the budget resolution? Why did 
it end in a tiebreaker? For the same 
reason the House passed their version 
of the bill we are considering today in 
the dead of night. No amount of good 
PR could ever make the American peo-
ple forget that this little exercise the 
Democrats are leading us through has 
almost nothing to do with providing 
emergency COVID relief. 
Nine percent. That is how much of 
this package Democrats want to dedi-
cate to a national vaccination pro-
gram, expanded testing, and public 
health jobs. They slapped a ‘‘COVID 
RELIEF’’ label on one of the largest 
transfers of wealth ever proposed in the 
history of the U.S. Congress and tried 
to sneak it through reconciliation be-
fore anyone caught on. 
This bill is so far over the line that 
my friends across the aisle have spent 
the past week fighting over the very 
provisions House Democrats and the 
White House used to pitch it. The bill 
is fatally flawed, right down to the for-
mula it employs to allocate State fund-
ing. The previous, bipartisan relief 
packages used population to determine 
this. It very straightforward. But this 
time, Democrats ran the numbers and 
decided they could benefit by making 
unemployment rate the deciding fac-
tor. And, wouldn’t you know it, this 
new system disproportionately benefits 
poorly mannaged blue States at the ex-
pense of well-managed red ones. New 
Jersey, New York, and California, 
whose destructive shutdowns led to 
high unemployment rates, will walk 
away with a combined gain of almost 
$9 billion. Tennessee, on the other 
hand, is still one of the best fiscally 
managed States in the country. We will 
lose $164 million for doing the right 
thing. Alabama will lose almost $900 
million. Both Florida and Georgia will 
lose over $l.2 billion each. 
If this body mandates a transfer of 
wealth based solely on Democrats’ de-
sire to clean up their prepandemic mis-
takes, we will scare off investment and 
hamper innovation in every State long 
after we are able to fully reopen. This 
isn’t a hypothetical—leaders on the 
State level know what is coming. Last 
week, 22 Governors, including Ten-
nessee Governor Bill Lee, released a 
joint statement pointing out the fool-
ish premise driving the new formula. I 
would like to associate myself with 
what they said: ‘‘A state’s ability to 
keep businesses open and people em-
ployed should not be a penalizing fac-
tor when distributing funds.’’ 
If this happens, small towns and 
mom-and-pop shops will suffer. Those 
budding tech hubs you hear so much 
about will suffer. The unemployed peo-
ple my colleagues on the left are using 
as leverage against their political ri-
vals will suffer. 
So I would ask my colleagues wheth-
er fulfilling campaign 
promises 
is 
worth what it will cost the families 
and small business owners stuck hold-
ing the bill. And to the Democratic 
Senators representing States losing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1268 
March 5, 2021 
to remind your constituents that you 
voted to send their tax dollars to New 
York and California and Illinois and 
other 
States 
that 
intentionally 
dragged their economies off a cliff. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been a long day, a long night, a long 
year, but a new day has come, and we 
tell the American people: Help is on 
the way. 
When Democrats assumed the major-
ity in this Chamber, we promised to 
pass legislation to rescue our people 
from the depths of the pandemic and 
bring our economy and our country 
roaring back. In a few moments, we are 
going to deliver on that promise. 
This bill will deliver more help to 
more people than anything the Federal 
Government has done in decades. It is 
broader, deeper, and more comprehen-
sive in helping working families and 
lifting people out of poverty than any-
thing Congress has seen or accom-
plished in a very long time. 
The pandemic has affected nearly 
every aspect of American life. So this 
bill spans the gamut and provides sup-
port to every part of our country. For 
Americans who doubted that the gov-
ernment can help them in this time of 
crisis, 
you 
will 
be 
getting 
direct 
checks. Your schools will receive as-
sistance to reopen quickly and safely; 
your local businesses will get another 
lifeline; and the day when you receive 
the vaccine will be a lot sooner. 
The American Rescue Plan will go 
down as one of the most sweeping Fed-
eral recovery efforts in history. It is 
never easy to pass legislation as mo-
mentous as this, but it will all and 
soon be worth it. 
Now, I know that on Saturday morn-
ing the American people aren’t watch-
ing our proceedings here. They are 
probably out walking the dog or sitting 
down at breakfast with the kids. But I 
want them to know help is on the way; 
that their government is going to give 
one final push to get us over the finish 
line. 
I want the American people to know 
that we are going to get through this, 
and someday soon our businesses will 
reopen; our economy will reopen; and 
life will reopen. We will end this ter-
rible plague, and we will travel again 
and send our kids to school again and 
be together again. 
Our job right now is to help our coun-
try get from this stormy present to 
that hopeful future, and it starts with 
voting aye on the legislation before us. 
Vote yes on the American Rescue Plan. 
Vote yes. 
And before I yield the floor, one final 
note. Let us all express our deepest 
gratitude to all of my colleagues who 
went through a long, long period in the 
last day; to the staffs of the commit-
tees and the personnel in Senate offices 
who have worked so hard to put this 
legislation together, and especially let 
us thank the great floor staff: the 
clerks, the cafeteria workers, the cus-
todial staff, and the Capitol Police. 
(Applause, Senators rising. 
This bill includes important support 
for state and local governments, allow-
ing them to not only provide services 
that are needed to fight the pandemic 
and support the economy, but also en-
suring that teachers and first respond-
ers don’t need to be laid off and serv-
ices don’t need to be cut. 
We also know that this crisis is going 
to have lasting consequences for State 
and local budgets, that many of the im-
pacts won’t just be felt this year, but 
going forward given how disruptive the 
last year was. 
So in designing this funding, we split 
the money for localities into two 
tranches, half to be delivered this year 
and half next year. For States, the 
money is delivered up front, with the 
Secretary given the discretion to cali-
brate timing of payments for some 
States based on their unemployment 
rate. For States with lower unemploy-
ment rates, the bill creates a structure 
for Treasury to work with States to 
spread the funding out over the course 
of this recovery. 
That will allow States and localities 
to get the money that they need, but 
over a timeline that will best support 
the economy as it recovers. 
Additionally, below are names of the 
staff who worked tirelessly towards the 
passage of this bill. I want to thank 
them for their service, and I ask unani-
mous consent that their names be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-

Mr. SCHUMER. Many of them have 
worked for as many as 36 hours 
straight. My notes here say: ‘‘Let’s 
give them a round of applause.’’ 
And, of course, one more thank-you 
to my great and wonderful staff. I will 
thank all of them by name at a later 
date because I want them to be awake 
and alert when I do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. The Senate has 
never spent $2 trillion in a more hap-
hazard way or through a less rigorous 
process. 
Voters gave Senate Democrats the 
slimmest possible majority. Voters 
picked a President who promised unity 
and bipartisanship. 
Democrats’ 
response 
is 
to 
ram 
through what they call ‘‘the most pro-
gressive domestic legislation in a gen-
eration’’ on a razor-thin majority in 
both Houses. 
The right path was obvious. We fol-
lowed it five times last year—five res-
cue packages totaling $4 trillion, and 
none of them got fewer than 90 votes. 
The Senate wrote the CARES Act, 
Republicans and Democrats, shoulder 
to shoulder. That was the road to real 
pandemic relief, but Democrats actu-
ally wanted something else. They ex-
plained their intent very clearly: to ex-
ploit this crisis as ‘‘a tremendous op-
portunity to restructure things to fit 
our vision.’’ 
That is how you get this massive bill 
with only 1 percent—1 percent for vac-
cinations, that ignores the science on 
reopening schools, that is stuffed with 
non-COVID-related spending that even 
top liberal economists say is wrong for 
the recovery. 
Democrats inherited a tide that is al-
ready turning—2021 was already set to 
be our comeback year—because of the 
American people’s resilience and the 
bipartisan foundation that we laid last 
year. 
We could have worked together to 
speed up victory, but our Democratic 
colleagues made a decision. Their top 
priority wasn’t pandemic relief. It was 
their Washington wish list. 
So, 
Mr. 
President, 
colleagues, 
I 
strongly recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
bill having been read the third time, 
the question is, Shall the bill pass? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there a sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is 
necessarily absent: the Senator from 
Alaska (Mr. SULLIVAN). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Alaska (Mr. SULLIVAN) 
would have voted ‘‘nay.’’ 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are 
there any Senators in the Chamber 
wishing to change their vote? 
The result was announced—yeas 50, 
nays 49, as follows:

MORNING BUSINESS 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, to-
day’s legislation takes a very impor-
tant step in providing financial assist-
ance to multiemployer pension plans, 
particularly those plans that have al-
ready had to suspend benefits in order 
to save the plans from going insolvent. 
That has been a very painful step for 
some plans in New York because it re-
sulted in retiree benefit cuts of as 
much as 60 percent. 
This legislation will allow those 
plans to restore painful cuts and ensure 
others on the brink do not have to take 
similar steps. 
I will be watching how the adminis-
tration implements this new program 
very closely to ensure plans receiving 
financial assistance under the new pro-
gram are not placed in a worse long- 
term funding position than they are 
today or are projected to be into the 
future. This new program is intended 
to be a long-term solution for these ail-
ing plans, a solution that protects re-
tiree benefits as well as the health of 
the plans themselves. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Sec-
tion 605 of the State and Local section 
of the American Rescue Plan requires 
further 
explanation 
on 
its 
intent. 
Below is the salient language of Sec-
tion 605, Local Assistance and Tribal 
Consistency Fund: 
‘‘(b) AUTHORITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) Payments to eligible revenue sharing 
counties.—For each of fiscal years 2022 and 
2023, the Secretary shall reserve $750,000,000 
of the total amount appropriated under sub-
section (a) to allocate and pay to each eligi-
ble revenue sharing county in amounts that 
are determined by the Secretary taking into 
account economic conditions of each eligible 
revenue sharing county, using measurements 
of poverty rates, household income, land val-
ues, and unemployment rates as well as 
other economic indicators, over the 20-year 
period ending with September 30, 2021. 
‘‘(l) ELIGIBLE REVENUE SHARING COUNTY.— 
The term ‘eligible revenue sharing county’ 
means— 
‘‘(A) a county, parish, or borough— 
‘‘(i) that is independent of any other unit 
of local government; and 
‘‘(ii) that, as determined by the Secretary, 
is the principal provider of government serv-
ices for the area within its jurisdiction; and 
‘‘(iii) for which, as determined by the Sec-
retary, there is a negative revenue impact 
due to implementation of a Federal program 
or changes to such program; and 
‘‘(B) the District of Columbia, the Com-
monwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the 
United States Virgin Islands. . . . ‘‘ 
Folks may wonder: ‘‘What are the 
revenue 
sharing 
counties?’’; 
‘‘Why 
Treasury?’’; and ‘‘How is my new pro-
gram different from existing county 
support programs?’’ 
Let me explain my thinking in put-
ting this language together. In every 
state, but especially the West, there 
are counties with tracts of federal 
lands that have unique impacts on the 
local economy. These counties are re-
ferred to in Section 605 as ‘‘revenue 
sharing counties’’—counties that have 
a direct fiscal relationship with public 
lands and public resources. These coun-
ties help pay for roads, schools, and 
other services that directly benefit 
and, in many cases, support federal 
lands. They get payments for the tax-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1271 
March 5, 2021 
exempt status of those public lands, or 
payments intended to split the revenue 
from the commercial use of public 
lands. This relationship between the 
counties and those lands and extractive 
industries usually means they are 
boom-and-bust counties—falling faster 
into recession and slower to climb out 
of recession when changes occur to par-
ticular federal programs or when, for 
example, a massive global pandemic 
hits without warning. 
I, and many of my colleagues, have 
worked for years on programs attempt-
ing to stabilize those local economies— 
primarily through two laws: the Secure 
Rural Schools and Community Self De-
termination Act, which is largely ad-
ministered by the Secretary of Agri-
culture through the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice and the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment; and the Payment in Lieu of 
Taxes Program, administered through 
the Secretary of the Interior. 
So, why implement a new and sepa-
rate program assigned to the Secretary 
of Treasury? Treasury is the agency 
with the best and most complete 
knowledge of the economic workings of 
our nation. Therefore, it is right up its 
alley to ‘‘tak[e] into account economic 
conditions of each eligible revenue 
sharing county, using measurements of 
poverty rates, household income, land 
values, and unemployment rates as 
well as other economic indicators, over 
the 20-year period ending with Sep-
tember 30, 2021.’’ In addition, my 20 
years of experience in this arena, com-
bined with what I’ve heard from Orego-
nians in rural counties, adds up to the 
conclusion that it is time to try some-
thing new to stabilize the local econo-
mies of these revenue-sharing counties. 
I am not expecting Treasury to do 
this work on its own. I will work with 
the Department, as will my colleague 
and long-time partner on this issue, 
Senator CRAPO. I also fully expect 
Treasury to consult with others in gov-
ernment who have history in this arena 
on the creation of this new formula 
such as the Secretaries of Agriculture 
and Interior, as well as the National 
Association of Counties, state county 
associations, including the Association 
of O&C Counties Oregon, and many 
other groups with a deep understanding 
of these impacts across the United 
States. These entities will help Treas-
ury stand up this new program at 
Treasury because they provide historic 
context to the entirely new program in 
its analysis of the needs of the coun-
ties, for the first time taking into ac-
count economic conditions on the 
ground. The new program will include 
$1.5 billion for eligible counties and 
$500 million for Tribes over the next 
two years. 
So, now that I have covered the ques-
tions of ‘‘What are the revenue sharing 
counties?’’; 
‘‘Why 
Treasury?’’; 
and 
‘‘How is my new program different?’’; I 
want to provide an answer to ‘‘What 
has happened in the revenue sharing 
county to warrant a payment?’’ 
Revenue sharing counties have suf-
fered economic loss due to the imple-
mentation of, or changes in, a federal 
program. For example, necessary envi-
ronmental and wildlife protection laws 
have reduced the revenue sharing pay-
ments to counties that host U.S. For-
est Service lands and timberlands man-
aged by the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
Over the last half century, revenue 
sharing counties have seen their budg-
ets fluctuate wildly based on incon-
sistent 
revenue 
sharing 
payments 
caused, in part, by the boom and bust 
nature of resource extraction indus-
tries. 
Additionally, 
current 
federal 
county payments laws meant to sta-
bilize this cycle, such as PILT and 
SRS, are often inconsistently funded 
and leave counties on an economic roll-
er coaster each year waiting for incon-
sistent reauthorizations. 
The purpose of my new program is to 
help stabilize the budgets and econo-
mies of counties that have historically 
hosted extractive industry on private 
or public lands and where downturns in 
those extractive industries, caused by 
government action, affected the county 
economically and budgetarily. 
Unfortunately, due to the nature of 
the reconciliation process in the Sen-
ate, the final language of the new coun-
ty payments program did not make 
this perfectly clear. Instead, the final 
language referred simply to revenue 
sharing counties, but requires Treasury 
to establish a formula that helps both. 
Let me touch on a couple of the other 
key provisions in the section. First, 
while the money provided is for a coun-
ty to use as it sees fit, a county cannot 
use any of the funds to lobby anyone 
for any reason at any level of govern-
ment. If a county does use the money 
in this unauthorized manner, the coun-
ty must return the improperly used 
money to the treasury. 
The county that takes money under 
this section must report to the Treas-
ury Secretary about the use of that 
money. The Secretary has the discre-
tion to make the reporting require-
ments more detailed. And lastly, if the 
county does not make a timely report, 
then the county must pay a penalty. 
And lastly, let me talk about the 
$500,000,000 in this section destined for 
the Tribes. The section reads: 
‘‘(2) PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE TRIBAL GOVERN-
MENTS.—For each of fiscal years 2022 and 
2023, the Secretary shall reserve $250,000,000 
of the total amount appropriated under sub-
section (a) to allocate and pay to eligible 
Tribal governments in amounts that are de-
termined by the Secretary taking into ac-
count economic conditions of each eligible 
Tribe. 
‘‘(2) ELIGIBLE
TRIBAL
GOVERNMENT.—The 
term ’eligible Tribal government’ means the 
recognized governing body of an eligible 
Tribe. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TRIBE.—The term ’eligible 
Tribe’ means any Indian or Alaska Native 
tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, commu-
nity, component band, or component res-
ervation, individually identified (including 
parenthetically) in the list published most 
recently as of the date of enactment of this 
section pursuant to section 104 of the Feder-
ally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 
(25 U.S.C. 5131).’’ 
This section of the bill would estab-
lish a new Tribal economic stabiliza-
tion fund, which would allow the De-
partment of Treasury to make pay-
ments to Tribal governments for any 
governmental 
purpose 
deemed 
nec-
essary by the Tribe. This language is 
intended for the Department of Treas-
ury to work with the Tribal Govern-
ments defined in the bill to determine 
a formula ensuring equitable distribu-
tion of the funding each year. This 
funding could be used to repair critical 
drinking water infrastructure, fund 
Tribal healthcare services, or other 
critical Tribal needs. 
Madam President, I am thrilled to be 
on the new path of providing stabilized 
aid to these counties. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in stand-
ing up this program.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, sec-
tion 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5, the fiscal 
year 2021 congressional budget resolu-
tion, allows the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee to revise the alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels in the 
budget resolution for legislation con-
sidered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that Amendment 891 fulfills the 
conditions found in section 3001 of S. 
Con. Res. 5. Accordingly, I am revising 
the allocations for the reconciled com-
mittees and other enforceable budg-
etary levels to account for the budg-
etary effects of the amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this 
month we are celebrating Women’s His-
tory Month, which is a time for us to 
look back on history and recognize all 
of the barriers women have overcome, 
honor women’s rights champions, and 
strategize on the work we still have 
ahead of us. Our country has made 
great strides and progress in recent 
decades. We cannot let previous gen-
erations’ hard work and sacrifices go to 
waste. 
Dating back to the 1800s, women’s 
history of philanthropists, suffragists, 
and activists in my home State of 
Maryland is rich. Margaret Briggs 
Gregory Hawkins, born in 1887, was in-
strumental in the long-haul efforts of 
women earning the right to vote. Her 
dedicated efforts for women’s rights 
and civil rights were evident at the 
local level in my hometown of Balti-
more. Through her membership in 
women’s grassroots organizations, such 
as the Druid Hill Branch of the YWCA, 
Civilian Defense Mobilization, and the 
Progressive Women’s Suffrage Club, 
she focused on cultivating meaningful 
relationships, leadership skills, and ad-
vancing civil rights and voting rights 
for women of color. We commemorate 
Margaret this Women’s History Month 
as she is inducted into the 2021 Mary-
land Women’s Hall of Fame. 
Women’s History Month is a time for 
us to remember the fearless women 
who shaped history as we know it. In 
2020, we lost Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Affectionately 
known as the ‘‘notorious RBG,’’ Jus-
tice Ginsburg paved the way for mil-
lions of women in her relentless fight 
for justice and equality. She was a war-
rior in guaranteeing women had a 
sound voice in the arena. Justice Gins-
burg challenged us to ‘‘think about 
how you would like the world to be for 
your daughters and granddaughters.’’ 
While 2020 was tumultuous, it also 
brought anniversaries that are worth 
noting. In August, we celebrated the 
milestone of the 100th anniversary of 
women’s suffrage. The right to vote is 
a central to the heart of our democ-
racy. I cannot think of a better way to 
ring in this milestone than by electing 
our first female Vice President, Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS. 
It was a privilege and a joy to serve 
with my friend KAMALA in the Senate. 
She has been pivotal in women’s his-
tory. Aside from her groundbreaking 
role as our first female Vice President, 
she is the first woman, first South 
Asian American, and first African 
American to serve as attorny general 
in California’s history. When looking 
back on her achievements, she often 
quotes her mother, who would tell her, 
‘‘Kamala, you may be the first to do 
many things, but make sure you are 
not the last.’’ I could not agree more. 
While Vice President HARRIS made 
history and shattered the glass ceiling 
with her election victory this past No-
vember, there is still work we must do. 
The first step in leveling the playing 
field between men and women, today 
and for future generations, is to pass 
the Equal Rights Amendment, ERA. 
Justice Ginsburg once said that if she 
could choose an amendment to add to 
the Constitution, it would be the Equal 
Rights Amendment. That is because 
she would like her granddaughters,

when they pick up the Constitution, to 
see that notion—that women and men 
are persons of equal stature—as a basic 
principle of our society. 
To this day, the Constitution of the 
United States, our Nation’s key docu-
ment and supreme law, does not con-
sider men and women of equal stature. 
For example, the Constitution does not 
protect equal pay under the law. 
Women, especially women of color, are 
earning significantly less than their 
male counterparts for the same work. 
Women make up a majority of the pop-
ulation, yet are underrepresented in 
our government institutions and the 
business world. 
The ERA has reached the necessary 
38-State ratification threshold for this 
landmark legislation to be added to the 
Constitution of the United States. The 
ERA would solidify and protect the 
rights of women where our legislation 
currently falls short. The ERA would 
raise the standard of scrutiny with 
which the courts analyze cases of dis-
crimination on the basis of sex and 
send the vital message that women and 
men are citizens of equal stature in the 
United States. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion in the Senate, S.J. Res. 1, with the 
senior Senator from Alaska, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, that would remove the existing 
deadline and allow us to bring this 
meaningful legislation to the finish 
line once and for all.

CRIS 
ALLEN 
MULTIEMPLOYER 
PENSION 
RECAPITALIZATION 
AND REFORM PLAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
multiemployer 
pension 
system 
has 
been in need of a major overhaul for 
years. More than 300 plans are criti-
cally underfunded. Moreover, the Pen-
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 
PBGC, multiemployer insurance fund, 
which is a backstop for these plans, is 
projected to become insolvent in the 
next 5 years. 
If this occurs, 1.5 million retirees, 
due to no fault of their own, could see 
their hard-earned retirement benefits 
slashed to pennies on the dollar. This is 
unacceptable, and it is one of the rea-
sons that, when I took over as chair-
man of the Senate Finance Committee 
in 2019, I made it a priority to fix the 
failing multiemployer pension system. 
To me, this has always meant helping 
secure the retirement benefits of mil-
lions of retirees and ensuring that this 
retirement system is sustainable over 
the long term. Working with former 
Senator and HELP Committee Chair-
man Lamar Alexander, I immediately 
got to work on a draft proposal, which 
was released for public input and 
stakeholder feedback in November of 
2019. We received numerous comments 
from workers, retirees, unions, employ-
ers, actuaries, academics, plan offi-
cials, and members of the general pub-
lic that helped me refine my approach 
and create a balanced plan. 
Yesterday, 
I 
reintroduced 
this 
version of my plan, which is titled the 
‘‘Chris Allen Multiemployer Pension 
Recapitalization 
and 
Reform 
Act.’’ 
This legislation recognizes that, given 
the severity of the underfunding issue, 
some Federal dollars will be necessary 
to shore up severely troubled plans in 
the short term. But, this limited as-
sistance must be coupled with struc-
tural reforms intended to address the 
root causes of our current situation. 
This includes reforms to multiem-
ployer funding rules to ensure plans 
are adequately capitalized to make 
good on promises made to plan partici-
pants. Furthermore, it would increase 
PBGC oversight of troubled plans and 
enhance transparency for plan partici-
pants. Critically, it also overhauls the 
financing of the PBGC multiemployer 
insurance fund so that it can resume 
its role as the insurer of last resort for 
these plans without additional tax-
payer funding. 
The fundamental tenet of my plan is 
that all stakeholders have a role in fix-
ing the multiemployer pension system. 
The American taxpayer shouldn’t be 
expected to simply write a blank 
check. Stakeholders need to have skin 
in the game if the system is to be sus-
tainable moving forward. 
I understand that this is an ex-
tremely complex situation. There is no 
perfect solution. From the start, I have 
let it be known I want to work with my 
Democratic colleagues to find a bipar-
tisan compromise. In June of last year, 
I came to the floor to plead with my 
Democratic colleagues to come to the 
table in hopes we could work toward a 
bipartisan agreement prior to the end 
of last Congress. Unfortunately, for 
months I heard nothing. Then, with 
only a few weeks left in the 116th Con-
gress, my Democratic colleagues took 
me up on my offer and negotiations 
began in earnest. Several weeks of bi-
partisan negotiations ensued, but there 
simply was not enough time to iron out 
all our differences to ensure we had 
sufficient Member support before the 
end of the year. However, I found our 
discussions constructive. They were fo-
cused correctly on securing the retire-
ment benefits of participants in the 
failing plans in the near term, while 
also ensuring the long-term sustain-
ability of the multiemployer pension 
system without a Federal takeover. 
I hoped our negotiations would pro-
vide a foundation for continuing to 
work toward a bipartisan solution this 
Congress. Instead I am disappointed to 
see that the majority has include an 
unprecedented $86 billion no-strings 
bailout of troubled multiemployer pen-
sion plans in the reconciliation bill 
currently before the Senate. 
As I have discussed, I recognize that 
Federal funds will be needed to solve 
the pension crisis in the short term, 
but it is equally as important that es-
sential reforms are enacted to ensure 
the system can be self-sustaining in 
the long term. Otherwise, taxpayers 
will be perpetually subsidizing a pri-
vate sector system of employee-benefit 
promises. That is exactly what will 
occur if my Democratic colleagues in-
sist on going forward with the reform- 
free bailout included in this package. 
As is, this proposal has been stripped of 
even the most rudimentary of reforms 
or accountability measures. In fact, 
one provision even bars the PBGC from 
issuing regulations to provide for such 
measures. As a result, the proposal is 
likely to breed what economists call 
‘‘moral hazard’’ as plan managers and 
sponsors realize that there are no con-
sequences to underfunding and over-
promising. In the end, the American 
taxpayer will be left footing the bill for 
a private sector retirement system. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
reconsider moving forward with their 
no-holds-bared 
bailout. 
Fundamen-
tally, it does not belong in the current 
package. The issues plaguing the mul-
tiemployer system long predate the 
pandemic and are not COVID related. 
But if it is to be included, at a min-
imum, essential reforms along the 
lines of what I have proposed must be 
included. They are essential to protect 
the American taxpayer and to ensure 
the long-term sustainability of the 
multiemployer system. 
Toward this end, I intend to offer a 
motion to commit the reconciliation 
bill to the Finance Committee with in-
structions to report it back with crit-
ical reforms to ensure multiemployer 
plans are adequately funded and the 
PBGC’s insurance fund is adequately fi-
nanced. Without such reforms, the cur-
rent proposal would set the precedent 
that the American taxpayer, not the 
PBGC, is the ultimate guarantor of pri-
vate-employer pension promises. If this 
is the case, the burden on the Amer-
ican taxpayer will not be the $86 billion 
in this package or even hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. It will be limitless.

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF JUDGE SIDNEY 
R. THOMAS 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I recognize Chief Judge Sidney 
R. Thomas, a dedicated public servant 
who is celebrating 25 years on the Fed-
eral bench on March 11. 
Born and raised in Montana, Judge 
Thomas’s skill as a decisionmaker was 
evident from the start. Even as a high 
school debater, he earned the respect of 
competing schools with the combina-
tion of his success at meets and affable 
spirit. Both his tenacity and good na-
ture would be enduring legacies. Judge 
Thomas went on to attend Montana 
State University and obtain his J.D. 
from the University of Montana School 
of Law. He was twice appointed to the 
Board of Regents of Higher Education 
as a student member. 
After graduating, Judge Thomas en-
tered private practice. A quick learner 
with a deft ability to understand even 
the most complex cases, he became a 
senior partner. During his tenure in 
private practice, Judge Thomas spe-
cialized in commercial litigation, along 
with 
bankruptcy, 
government, 
and 
media law. He further applied his ex-
pertise as the standing bankruptcy

trustee for all bankruptcy cases filed in 
the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Montana’s Billings Division. Judge 
Thomas also helped shape future law-
yers by serving at Rocky Mountain 
College for over a decade as an adjunct 
instructor in law. 
On July 19, 1995, recognizing Judge 
Thomas’s outstanding record, Presi-
dent Bill Clinton nominated him to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. The U.S. Senate confirmed 
Judge Thomas in January 1996, and he 
served as a judge for nearly two dec-
ades, before becoming chief judge on 
December 1, 2014. 
Throughout his impressive career, 
Judge Thomas has earned the con-
fidence of his colleagues and the Amer-
ican people. He is a respected leader 
who is trusted for his sound judgment 
and integrity, as well as beloved for his 
warm personality and wit. These quali-
ties landed Judge Thomas on President 
Barack Obama’s short list of can-
didates to replace Justice John Paul 
Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court in 
2010. 
Thanks to his extraordinary commit-
ment public service, his intelligence 
and legal acumen, and his commitment 
to justice, Judge Thomas is a credit to 
our Nation’s judiciary. His fairness on 
the bench, along with his tireless work 
ethic and compassion, sets a model for 
all of us. 
I applaud his many accomplishments 
and hope my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating Chief Judge Sidney R. 
Thomas on attaining 25 years on the 
Federal bench.

ESSAY CONTEST FINALISTS

The material follows: 
FINALISTS 
ALEXANDER SHRIVER, BRATILEBORO UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, SENIOR 
On November 8th, 2016, the American peo-
ple exercised their most basic democratic 
freedom and decided to elect Hillary Clinton 
as their President. According to CNN Poli-
tics, Clinton won the majority of the 138 mil-
lion votes cast. If U.S. democracy stayed 
true to its ideal of equality, Clinton would 
have been elected. Instead, the 2.9 million 
votes which gave Clinton the edge meant 
nothing—those 
voices 
unheard 
and 
disrespected. Donald Trump was placed in of-
fice. 
Writing the Constitution, the founding fa-
thers struggled to find a fair way to elect a 
President and ultimately created the Elec-
toral College. Instead of relying on a popular 
vote, this system, along with the infamous 
Three-fifths Compromise, was built to ap-
pease the opposition of southern slaveholders 
worried the more populous North would con-
trol the country and outlaw slavery. Since 
its inception, it has contradicted the peoples’ 
decision in five elections, including 2016. 
As horrible as its origins are, some argue 
that the Electoral College still protects the 
interests of smaller states where people 
might not otherwise be heard. They argue 
the antiquated system forces candidates to 
campaign in less populous areas, protecting 
their importance. However, the Electoral 
College does not fulfill this purpose. Con-
sider the areas Donald Trump visited in his 
2020 campaign: he never traveled to states 
like Vermont, Wyoming, North Dakota, 
Rhode Island, or Montana. This is the kind 
of disproportionate attention the Electoral 
College is supposed to prevent, but because 
of their low vote count and poll’s suggesting 
a large polarization towards one candidate, 
these states were not prioritized. 
330 million people live in the U.S., almost 
none of whom have had any sort of inter-
action with a presidential candidate. Most 
citizens learn about presidential campaigns 
through the media, online campaigning, and 
events like nationally televised debates. 
Therefore, even if the Electoral College did 
force equal attention to every state, it 
makes no difference because of the manner 
in which citizens make their voting deci-
sions. 
In the Electoral College, some votes count 
for more than others. Each state has two 
voting delegates from the Senate and at 
least one member in the House of Represent-
atives regardless of their population, auto-
matically giving smaller states more voting 
power. According to the University of North 
Carolina, a vote in Alaska is about 2.42 times 
more valuable than the average vote, while a 
Californian vote is only 87% as valuable as 
the average. Furthermore, in states where 
the vast majority of people vote the same 
way, each individual vote is less important 
than in a more politically diverse state. Be-
cause its original purpose of protecting small 
states is unnecessary, the Electoral College 
only serves to devalue some votes. 
The best solution to promote a more pure 
democracy is to amend the Constitution to 
replace the Electoral College with a popular 
vote. The only factor in determining the 
President would be the will of the people. 
There are many ways the American democ-
racy needs to improve, so let’s start with its 
most fundamental institution. 
STEPHIE SIKI, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR 
ANTIRACISM 
‘‘To be black and conscious of anti black 
racism is to stare into the mirror of your 
own extinctions’’ by lbram X. Kendi. The as-
sassination of George Floyd showed me that 
my life could also be taken away at the 
knees of a police officer. As a black woman, 
it felt as if I had a danger in my chest, that 
I couldn’t pull out, I could only watch it 
bleed for nine and a half minutes. Despite 
the horrendous police brutality, I believe 
that our generation has the power to remove 
racist thoughts, beliefs, and actions in this 
world. The only way to remove racism is to 
become an antiracist. 
My definition of antiracist is someone that 
actively chooses to be against racism. It 
takes learning about structural racism and 
one’s own implicit bias and privilege. Ac-
cording to PNAS, Between the ages of 25 and 
29, black men are killed by police at a rate 
between 2.8 and 4.1 per 100,000. Stephan 
Clark, a young man that was standing in his 
grandmother’s yard, holding a mobile phone. 
The police shot him 20 times, they assumed 
Clark was holding a weapon because his skin 
is seen as a weapon. This type of scenario is 
not the first nor is it the last unless we 
change it as a country. Based on the Na-
tional 
Equity 
Project, 
Structural 
racialization refers to institutional practices 
and structural arrangements that lead to 
racialized inequities Equity is when every 
individual or group of people receives the 
right amount of support based on their 
needs. We need to work on providing racial 
equity in our country. 
Since the minority communities have been 
built to be inferior to be majority commu-
nities, it is hard to survive in a crisis. We 
have to understand the 400 years of night-
mares black people have lived through be-
cause it impacts our lives. Based on The 
Washington Post, black Americans were 37% 
more likely to die from Covid19 than whites. 
As a black woman, this statistic scares me 
because it is implying that my race will be 
the reason I am more likely to die from 
Covid19 and not my health. As a member of 
The Winooski Students for Anti Racism, we 
are demanding that SRO officers be removed 
from our school because of the institutional 
racism the police system was built on. Two 
thousand twenty was the last march to de-
mand BLACK LIVES MATTER, my life mat-
ters. 
We have to mandate Culture and Commu-
nity class for middle and high school. That 
class will focus on teaching students about 
race, racism, identity, equity, biases, privi-
lege, and slavery. We need social workers ac-
companying police officers to a situation be-
lieved to be racially motivated. We also need 
to support anti racist organizations in the 
U.S.A. Encourage states to at least have one 
organization that prioritizes anti racism. In 
order to save the world from this racist pan-
demic, we have focused on targeting racism.∑

local government in all such States. 
‘‘ ‘(C) DISTRIBUTION
TO
NONENTITLEMENT

ment as the population of the nonentitle-

ject to clause (iii).

the 30-day distribution period described in 
such clause that it would constitute an ex-
cessive administrative burden for the State

spect to 1 or more such distributions, the au-

retary shall grant, an extension of such pe-

tended, an authorized officer of the State 
may request an additional extension of the 
distribution period of not more than 30 days.

which an additional extension is requested, 
when the State expects to make such dis-
tribution and the actions the State has 
taken and will take in order to make all 
such distributions before the end of the dis-
tribution period (as extended under sub-
clause (I) and this subclause); and

plan is reasonably designed to distribute all 
such funds to nonentitlement units of local 
government by the end of the distribution 
period (as so extended). 
‘‘ ‘(bb) FURTHER ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.—If 
a State granted an additional extension of 
the distribution period under item (aa) re-

AMOUNTS.—Any 
amounts not distributed to a nonentitlement

riod for the State (as extended with respect 
to the State under subparagraph (C)(ii)), 
such State has failed to make all the dis-
tributions from such payment in accordance 
with the terms of subparagraph (C) (includ-
ing any extensions of the distribution period 
granted in accordance with such subpara-

vided under section 602(b)(3)(B)(iii), and shall 
be deposited into the general fund of the 
Treasury.

priated under subsection (a), the Secretary

which such county is located, and such State 
shall distribute such amount to each unit of

‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days 
after a State receives a payment under sub-
paragraph (B), the State shall distribute to 
each nonentitlement unit of local govern-
ment in the State an amount that bears the 
same proportion to the amount of such pay-
ment as the population of the nonentitle-
ment unit of local government bears to the 
total population of all the nonentitlement 
units of local government in the State, sub-
ject to clause (iii). 
‘‘(ii) DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.— 
‘‘(I) EXTENSION
FOR
DISTRIBUTION.—If an 
authorized officer of a State required to 
make distributions under clause (i) certifies 
in writing to the Secretary before the end of 
the 30-day distribution period described in 
such clause that it would constitute an ex-
cessive administrative burden for the State 
to meet the terms of such clause with re-
spect to 1 or more such distributions, the au-
thorized officer may request, and the Sec-
retary shall grant, an extension of such pe-
riod of not more than 30 days to allow the 
State to make such distributions in accord-
ance with clause (i). 
‘‘(II) ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.— 
‘‘(aa) IN
GENERAL.—If a State has been 
granted an extension to the distribution pe-
riod under subclause (I) but is unable to 
make all the distributions required under 
clause (i) before the end of such period as ex-
tended, an authorized officer of the State 
may request an additional extension of the 
distribution period of not more than 30 days. 
The Secretary may grant a request for an ad-
ditional extension of such period only if— 
‘‘(AA) the authorized officer making such 
request provides a written plan to the Sec-
retary specifying, for each distribution for 
which an additional extension is requested, 
when the State expects to make such dis-
tribution and the actions the State has 
taken and will take in order to make all 
such distributions before the end of the dis-
tribution period (as extended under sub-
clause (I) and this subclause); and 
‘‘(BB) the Secretary determines that such 
plan is reasonably designed to distribute all 
such funds to nonentitlement units of local 
government by the end of the distribution 
period (as so extended). 
‘‘(bb) FURTHER ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.—If 
a State granted an additional extension of 
the distribution period under item (aa) re-
quires any further additional extensions of 
such period, the request only may be made 
and granted subject to the requirements 
specified in item (aa). 
‘‘(iii) CAPPED AMOUNT.—The total amount 
distributed to a nonentitlement unit of local

2020.

EXCESS
AMOUNTS.—Any 
amounts not distributed to a nonentitlement 
unit of local government as a result of the

the end of the 120-day period that begins on 
the date a State receives a payment from the 
amount allocated under subparagraph (B) or, 
if later, the last day of the distribution pe-
riod for the State (as extended with respect 
to the State under subparagraph (C)(ii)), 
such State has failed to make all the dis-
tributions from such payment in accordance 
with the terms of subparagraph (C) (includ-
ing any extensions of the distribution period 
granted in accordance with such subpara-
graph), an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment that remains undistributed as 
of such date shall be booked as a debt of such 
State owed to the Federal Government, shall 
be paid back from the State’s allocation pro-
vided under section 602(b)(3)(B)(iii), and shall 
be deposited into the general fund of the 
Treasury.

‘‘(A) AMOUNT.—From the amount appro-
priated under subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall reserve and allocate $60,100,000,000 of 
such amount to make payments directly to 
counties in an amount which bears the same 
proportion to the total amount reserved

amount shall instead be paid to the State in 
which such county is located, and such State 
shall distribute such amount to each unit of 
general local government within such county 
in an amount that bears the same proportion 
to the amount to be paid to such county as 
the population of such units of general local 
government bears to the total population of 
such county.

the 30-day distribution period described in 
such clause that it would constitute an ex-
cessive administrative burden for the State

spect to 1 or more such distributions, the au-
thorized officer may request, and the Sec-
retary shall grant, an extension of such pe-
riod of not more than 30 days to allow the 
State to make such distributions in accord-
ance with clause (i). 
‘‘(II) ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.—

GENERAL.—If a State has been 
granted an extension to the distribution pe-
riod under subclause (I) but is unable to

clause (i) before the end of such period as ex-
tended, an authorized officer of the State 
may request an additional extension of the 
distribution period of not more than 30 days. 
The Secretary may grant a request for an ad-
ditional extension of such period only if— 
‘‘(AA) the authorized officer making such 
request provides a written plan to the Sec-
retary specifying, for each distribution for 
which an additional extension is requested, 
when the State expects to make such dis-
tribution and the actions the State has 
taken and will take in order to make all 
such distributions before the end of the dis-
tribution period (as extended under sub-
clause (I) and this subclause); and 
‘‘(BB) the Secretary determines that such 
plan is reasonably designed to distribute all 
such funds to nonentitlement units of local 
government by the end of the distribution 
period (as so extended). 
‘‘(bb) FURTHER ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.—If 
a State granted an additional extension of 
the distribution period under item (aa) re-
quires any further additional extensions of 
such period, the request only may be made 
and granted subject to the requirements 
specified in item (aa). 
‘‘(iii) CAPPED AMOUNT.—The total amount 
distributed to a nonentitlement unit of local

2020.

amounts not distributed to a nonentitlement

the date a State receives a payment from the 
amount allocated under subparagraph (B) or, 
if later, the last day of the distribution pe-
riod for the State (as extended with respect 
to the State under subparagraph (C)(ii)), 
such State has failed to make all the dis-
tributions from such payment in accordance 
with the terms of subparagraph (C) (includ-
ing any extensions of the distribution period 
granted in accordance with such subpara-
graph), an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment that remains undistributed as 
of such date shall be booked as a debt of such 
State owed to the Federal Government, shall 
be paid back from the State’s allocation pro-
vided under section 602(b)(3)(B)(iii), and shall 
be deposited into the general fund of the 
Treasury.

‘‘(A) AMOUNT.—From the amount appro-
priated under subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall reserve and allocate $60,100,000,000 of 
such amount to make payments directly to 
counties in an amount which bears the same 
proportion to the total amount reserved

each such county bears to the total popu-
lation of all such entities and shall pay such 
allocated amounts to such counties in ac-
cordance with paragraph (7). 
‘‘(B) SPECIAL RULES.— 
‘‘(i) URBAN COUNTIES.—No county that is an 
‘urban county’ (as defined in section 102 of 
the Housing and Community Development

odic payments made to any taxpayer for any

poses of this section— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this subsection, the term ‘annual 
advance amount’ means, with respect to any 
taxpayer for any calendar year, the amount 
(if any) which is estimated by the Secretary 
as being equal to 50 percent of the amount 
which would be treated as allowed under sub-
part C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 
1 by reason of section 24(d) (after application 
of subsection (i)(1) thereof) for the tax-
payer’s taxable year beginning in such cal-

DEFICIT IN PRIOR PAYMENTS.—In the case of 
any modification of the annual advance 
amount under subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary may adjust the amount of any peri-
odic payment made after the date of such

made before such date was greater than or 
less than the amount that such payment 
would have been on the basis of the annual 
advance amount as so modified. 
‘‘(4) TREATMENT
OF
CERTAIN
DEATHS.—A 
child shall not be taken into account in de-
termining the annual advance amount under

payer 
identity 
(as 
defined

calendar year, and such other information as 
the Secretary determines appropriate. 
‘‘(e) ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.— 
‘‘(1) APPLICATION OF ELECTRONIC FUNDS PAY-
MENT REQUIREMENT.—The payments made by

similar to the rules of subparagraphs (B) and

the income tax laws of the United States for

of such possession. 
‘‘(B) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF ADVANCE 
PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case 
of any possession described in subparagraph 
(B) which makes the election described in 
such subparagraph, the amount otherwise 
paid by the Secretary to such possession 
under section 24(k)(1)(A) with respect to tax-
able years beginning in 2021 shall be in-
creased by $300,000 if such possession has a 
plan, which has been approved by the Sec-
retary, for making advance payments con-
sistent with such election. 
‘‘(ii) AMERICAN SAMOA.—The amount other-
wise paid by the Secretary to American 
Samoa under subparagraph (A) of section

issue such regulations or other guidance as 
the Secretary determines necessary or ap-
propriate to carry out the purposes of this 
section and subsections (i)(1) and (j) of sec-
tion 24, including regulations or other guid-
ance which provides for the application of 
such provisions where the filing status of the 
taxpayer for a taxable year is different from 
the status used for determining the annual 
advance amount.’’. 
(2) RECONCILIATION OF CREDIT AND ADVANCE 
CREDIT.—Section 24 of such Code, as amended 
by the preceding provision of this Act, is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsection: 
‘‘(j) RECONCILIATION
OF
CREDIT
AND
AD-
VANCE CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit 
allowed under this section to any taxpayer 
for any taxable year shall be reduced (but 
not below zero) by the aggregate amount of 
payments made under section 7527A to such 
taxpayer during such taxable year. Any fail-
ure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical 
error and assessed according to section 
6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of payments under section 7527A to the tax-
payer during the taxable year exceeds the 
amount of the credit allowed under this sec-
tion to such taxpayer for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to paragraph 
(1)), the tax imposed by this chapter for such 
taxable year shall be increased by the 
amount of such excess. Any failure to so in-
crease the tax shall be treated as arising out 
of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year 
does not exceed 200 percent of the applicable 
income threshold, the amount of the in-
crease determined under subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such taxpayer for such tax-
able year shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by the safe harbor amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.— 
In the case of a taxpayer whose modified ad-
justed gross income (as defined in subsection 
(b)) for the taxable year exceeds the applica-
ble 
income 
threshold, 
the 
safe 
harbor 
amount otherwise in effect under clause (i) 
shall be reduced by the amount which bears 
the same ratio to such amount as such ex-
cess bears to the applicable income thresh-
old. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE INCOME THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘ap-
plicable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and 
‘‘(III) $40,000 in any other case. 
‘‘(iv) SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.—For purposes 
of this subparagraph, the term ‘safe harbor 
amount’ means, with respect to any taxable 
year, the product of— 
‘‘(I) $2,000, multiplied by 
‘‘(II) the excess (if any) of the number of 
qualified children taken into account in de-
termining the annual advance amount with 
respect to the taxpayer under section 7527A 
with respect to months beginning in such 
taxable year, over the number of qualified 
children taken into account in determining 
the credit allowed under this section for such 
taxable year.’’. 
(3) 
COORDINATION
WITH
WAGE
WITH-
HOLDING.—Section 3402(f)(1)(C) of such Code 
is amended by striking ‘‘section 24(a)’’ and 
inserting ‘‘section 24 (determined after appli-
cation of subsection (j) thereof)’’. 
(4) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.— 
(A) Section 26(b)(2) of such Code is amend-
ed by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end of subpara-
graph (X), by striking the period at the end 
of subparagraph (Y) and inserting ‘‘, and’’,

vance payments).’’.

amended by the preceding provisions of this 
subtitle, is amended by striking ‘‘and 6428B’’ 
and inserting ‘‘6428B, and 7527A’’.

31, United States Code, is amended— 
(i) by inserting ‘‘24,’’ before ‘‘25A’’, and 
(ii) by striking ‘‘ or 6431’’ and inserting 
‘‘6431, or 7527A’’.

credit.’’.

ment of this Act, in addition to amounts

OF
CREDIT
AND
AD-
VANCE CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit 
allowed under this section to any taxpayer 
for any taxable year shall be reduced (but 
not below zero) by the aggregate amount of 
payments made under section 7527A to such 
taxpayer during such taxable year. Any fail-
ure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical 
error and assessed according to section 
6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of payments under section 7527A to the tax-
payer during the taxable year exceeds the 
amount of the credit allowed under this sec-
tion to such taxpayer for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to paragraph 
(1)), the tax imposed by this chapter for such 
taxable year shall be increased by the 
amount of such excess. Any failure to so in-
crease the tax shall be treated as arising out 
of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1).

JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year

income threshold, the amount of the in-
crease determined under subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such taxpayer for such tax-
able year shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by the safe harbor amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.— 
In the case of a taxpayer whose modified ad-
justed gross income (as defined in subsection 
(b)) for the taxable year exceeds the applica-
ble 
income 
threshold, 
the 
safe 
harbor 
amount otherwise in effect under clause (i) 
shall be reduced by the amount which bears 
the same ratio to such amount as such ex-
cess bears to the applicable income thresh-
old. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE INCOME THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘ap-
plicable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and

‘‘(II) the excess (if any) of the number of 
qualified children taken into account in de-
termining the annual advance amount with 
respect to the taxpayer under section 7527A 
with respect to months beginning in such

‘‘(j) RECONCILIATION
OF
CREDIT
AND
AD-
VANCE CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit 
allowed under this section to any taxpayer 
for any taxable year shall be reduced (but 
not below zero) by the aggregate amount of 
payments made under section 7527A to such 
taxpayer during such taxable year. Any fail-
ure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical 
error and assessed according to section 
6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of payments under section 7527A to the tax-
payer during the taxable year exceeds the 
amount of the credit allowed under this sec-
tion to such taxpayer for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to paragraph 
(1)), the tax imposed by this chapter for such 
taxable year shall be increased by the 
amount of such excess. Any failure to so in-
crease the tax shall be treated as arising out 
of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year 
does not exceed 200 percent of the applicable 
income threshold, the amount of the in-
crease determined under subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such taxpayer for such tax-
able year shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by the safe harbor amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.— 
In the case of a taxpayer whose modified ad-
justed gross income (as defined in subsection 
(b)) for the taxable year exceeds the applica-
ble 
income 
threshold, 
the 
safe 
harbor 
amount otherwise in effect under clause (i) 
shall be reduced by the amount which bears 
the same ratio to such amount as such ex-
cess bears to the applicable income thresh-
